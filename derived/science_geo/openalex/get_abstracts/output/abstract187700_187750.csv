https://openalex.org/W2026525843,"The mitochondrial respiratory chain is a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under pathological conditions including myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. Limitation of electron transport by the inhibitor rotenone immediately before ischemia decreases the production of ROS in cardiac myocytes and reduces damage to mitochondria. We asked if ROS generation by intact mitochondria during the oxidation of complex I substrates (glutamate, pyruvate/malate) occurred from complex I or III. ROS production by mitochondria of Sprague-Dawley rat hearts and corresponding submitochondrial particles was studied. ROS were measured as H2O2 using the amplex red assay. In mitochondria oxidizing complex I substrates, rotenone inhibition did not increase H2O2. Oxidation of complex I or II substrates in the presence of antimycin A markedly increased H2O2. Rotenone prevented antimycin A-induced H2O2 production in mitochondria with complex I substrates but not with complex II substrates. Catalase scavenged H2O2. In contrast to intact mitochondria, blockade of complex I with rotenone markedly increased H2O2 production from submitochondrial particles oxidizing the complex I substrate NADH. ROS are produced from complex I by the NADH dehydrogenase located in the matrix side of the inner membrane and are dissipated in mitochondria by matrix antioxidant defense. However, in submitochondrial particles devoid of antioxidant defense ROS from complex I are available for detection. In mitochondria, complex III is the principal site for ROS generation during the oxidation of complex I substrates, and rotenone protects by limiting electron flow into complex III.

The oxidation of either complex I or complex II substrates in the presence of complex III inhibition with antimycin A increases ROS (1Herrero A. Barja G. Mech.

However, the major site of production of reactive oxygen species in mitochondria oxidizing complex I substrates remains unclear. In the pathologic condition of myocardial ischemia, administration of rotenone decreases the production of ROS (8Becker L.B. vanden Hoek T.L. Shao Z.H. Li C.Q. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H2240-H2246PubMed Google Scholar) and ameliorates damage to mitochondria during ischemia in the isolated rat heart (15Lesnefsky E.J. Moghaddas S. Vazquez E. Hoppel C. FASEB J. 2003; 17 (abstr.): 518PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that rotenone inhibition of complex I decreases rather than increases ROS production by mitochondria during ischemia. Myocardial ischemia results in a decrease in oxidation through cytochrome oxidase in intact mitochondria (6Lesnefsky E.J. Moghaddas S. Tandler B. Kerner J. Hoppel C.L. J. Mol. Cell.

Zhang Y. Appelman E.H. Babcock G.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), inhibition of cytochrome oxidase may facilitate ROS production from complexes I or III (22Dawson T.L. Gores G.J. Nieminen A.L. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C961-C967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochrome oxidase inhibition by KCN enhanced myocardial damage during reperfusion (5Ambrosio G. Zweier J.L. Duilio C. Kuppusamy P. Santoro G. Elia P.P. Tritto I. Cirillo P. Condorelli M. Chiariello M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18532-18541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that blockade of electron flow at cytochrome oxidase increased both ROS generation and oxidative damage during reperfusion. Mitochondria and submitochondrial particles commonly are used to study ROS generation. Compared with mitochondria, submitochondrial particles lack matrix antioxidant enzymes (23Raha S. McEachern G.E. Myint A.T. Robinson B.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 170-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and have a mixed orientation of the inner mitochondrial membrane (24Hoppel C. Cooper C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 135: 184-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These features may result in different findings when the production of ROS is compared between mitochondria and submitochondrial particles. In the present study, we used mitochondria and corresponding submitochondrial particles prepared from Sprague-Dawley rat heart to test the following: 1) if blockade of proximal electron flow decreases ROS generation from complex III in mitochondria and submitochondrial particles, 2) if complex IV inhibition enhances ROS generation during the oxidation of complex I or complex II substrates, 3) if matrix antioxidant defense dissipates ROS production from either complex I or complex III. Materials—All chemicals were reagent grade and purchased from Sigma. Supplies for the amplex red assay were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Mitochondria Isolation—The Animal Care and Use Committee for the Louis Stokes Veterans Affairs Medical Center approved the protocol. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (400–500 g) were euthanized, and the hearts from those rats were isolated and put into buffer A (containing (in mm) 100 KCl, 50 MOPS, 1 EGTA, 5 MgSO4·7H2O, and 1 ATP, pH 7.4) at 4 °C. Cardiac subsarcolemmal mitochondria were isolated using the procedure of Palmer et al. (25Palmer J.W. Tandler B. Hoppel C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8731-8739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cardiac tissue was finely minced, placed in buffer A containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and homogenized with a Polytron tissue processor (Brinkmann Instruments) for 2.5 s at a rheostat setting of 6.0. The Polytron homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g, the supernatant was saved for isolation of subsarcolemmal mitochondria, and the pellet was washed. The combined supernatants were centrifuged at 3000 × g to sediment subsarcolemmal mitochondria, which were washed twice and then suspended in KME (100 mm KCl, 50 mm MOPS, and 0.5 mm EGTA). Some of the mitochondria were used for studies of mitochondrial oxidation and H2O2 production, and the remainder was frozen at -70 °C for the preparation of submitochondrial particles. Mitochondrial protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Preparation of Submitochondrial Particles—Subsarcolemmal mitochondria from 2 to 3 rats were pooled together for the preparation of submitochondrial particles. Frozen mitochondria were thawed and diluted with 10 mm MOPS to a concentration of ∼10–20 mg of protein/ml. The mitochondria were sonicated for 20 s in a salt-ice-water bath (-4 °C) at 60% of maximal output in a Branson sonifier, followed by a 2-min interval. After 9 cycles, the suspension was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was decanted and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 45 min (24Hoppel C. Cooper C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 135: 184-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 26Lesnefsky E.J. Gudz T.I. Migita C.T. Ikeda-Saito M. Hassan M.O. Turkaly P.J. Hoppel C.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 385: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The pellet was resuspended in 10 mm MOPS, and the protein concentration was determined. Mitochondrial Oxidative Phosphorylation—Oxygen consumption in mitochondria was measured using a Clark-type oxygen electrode at 30 °C (16Lesnefsky E.J. Tandler B. Ye J. Slabe T.J. Turkaly J. Hoppel C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1544-H1554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria were incubated in solution including 80 mm KCl, 50 mm MOPS, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm KH2PO4, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at pH 7.4. Glutamate was used as substrate, and state 3 (ADP-stimulated), state 4 (ADP-limited) respiration, respiratory control ratios, and the ADP/O ratio were determined (16Lesnefsky E.J. Tandler B. Ye J. Slabe T.J. Turkaly J. Hoppel C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1544-H1554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Detection of H 2 O 2 Production—The rate of H2O2 production in mitochondria and submitochondrial particles was determined using the oxidation of the fluorogenic indicator amplex red in the presence of horseradish peroxidase (2Moghaddas S. Hoppel C. Lesnefsky E.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 414: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The concentrations of horseradish peroxidase and amplex red in the incubation were 0.1 unit/ml and 50 μm, respectively. Fluorescence was recorded in a microplate reader (1420 Victor2, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with 530 nm excitation and 590 nm emission wavelengths. Standard curves obtained by adding known amounts of H2O2 to assay medium in the presence of the reactants (amplex red and horseradish peroxidase) were linear up to 2 μm. Background fluorescence was measured in the absence of submitochondrial particles or mitochondria and presented as fluorescence minus background (pmol/mg of protein/30 min). The addition of superoxide dismutase did not increase the rate of production of H2O2 indicating that under assay conditions, the non-enzymatic dismutation of superoxide to H2O2 was sufficiently rapid and complete. In a typical experiment, mitochondria or submitochondrial particles were incubated at 0.1 mg of protein/ml at 30 °C. H2O2 production was initiated in mitochondria using glutamate (10 mm), pyruvate (2.5 mm)/malate (2.5 mm), or succinate (5 mm) as substrates. Substrates used with submitochondrial particles were NADH (80 μm) or succinate (5 mm). Rotenone (2.4 μm), antimycin A (10 μm), and azide (10 mm) were added into incubation medium to inhibit the activities of complex I, complex III, and complex IV, respectively. Because thenoyltrifluoroacetone caused a high background fluorescence, malonate (2.5 mm), a succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor, was used to block complex II (27Echtay K.S. Murphy M.P. Smith R.A. Talbot D.A. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47129-47135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Stigmatellin (6.6 μm) was used to test whether blockade of complex III at the Qo site, limiting electron flow into complex III, reduced H2O2 generation. The addition of catalase (643 units/ml) decreased fluorescence by 85–90% as expected and was used to dissipate H2O2 in the incubation system. The rate of H2O2 production was linear with respect to mg of mitochondrial protein. Statistical Analyses—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. of the mean. One-way analysis of variance with repeated measurements was used to assess the difference between different inhibitors in mitochondria. A difference of p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Oxidative Phosphorylation—Oxidative phosphorylation was studied in mitochondria with glutamate as the substrate. The state 3 (0.2 mm ADP-stimulated), state 4, and maximal ADP (2 mm)-stimulated respiratory rates (n = 5) were 230 ± 4, 35 ± 3, and 260 ± 6 nAO min-1 mg protein-1, respectively, consistent with previous results (25Palmer J.W. Tandler B. Hoppel C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8731-8739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lesnefsky E.J. Gudz T.I. Migita C.T. Ikeda-Saito M. Hassan M.O. Turkaly P.J. Hoppel C.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 385: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Respiratory control ratio and ADP/O ratio were 7.1 ± 0.8 and 2.78 ± 0.12. These results indicated that mitochondrial respiration was tightly coupled. H 2 O 2 Production in Mitochondria—Oxidizing glutamate, mitochondria generated minimal H2O2 in the absence of inhibitors (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, the complex I inhibitor rotenone did not lead to an additional increase in H2O2 production. Complex III inhibition by antimycin A markedly increased H2O2 production, as expected (11Sugioka K. Nakano M. Totsune-Nakano H. Minakami H. Tero-Kubota S. Ikegami Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 936: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Rotenone inhibition prevented antimycin A-induced H2O2 production in the mitochondria oxidizing glutamate (Fig. 1A). Stigmatellin attenuated the antimycin A-induced H2O2 production in mitochondria oxidizing glutamate (Table I). Azide inhibition did not increase H2O2 by mitochondria in the presence of glutamate (Table II). Catalase dissipated most of the ROS production by antimycin A indicating that the increase in fluorescence measured was because of H2O2 (Fig. 1A).Table IH2O2 generation in mitochondria oxidizing complex I and complex II substrates Values given are mean ± S.E., n = 5.No inhibitorAAAA + stigmatellinGlutamate (10 mm)20±10360±30ap < 0.05 compared to no inhibitor80±10bp < 0.05 compared to antimycin A (AA)Pyruvate (2.5 mm)/malate (2.5 mm)15±5480±60ap < 0.05 compared to no inhibitor70±10bp < 0.05 compared to antimycin A (AA)Succinate (5 mm)/rotenone (2.4 μm)20±10280±20ap < 0.05 compared to no inhibitor80±20bp < 0.05 compared to antimycin A (AA)a p < 0.05 compared to no inhibitorb p < 0.05 compared to antimycin A (AA) Open table in a new tab Table IIH2O2 generation in azide-treated mitochondria and submitochondrial particles oxidizing complex I and complex II substrates Submitochondrial particle data are the average value for triplicate measurements on one pool of submitochondrial particles.

In agreement with the glutamate results, mitochondria oxidizing pyruvate/malate generated minimal H2O2 (Fig. 1B). Inhibition of complex I with rotenone did not increase H2O2 production in mitochondria oxidizing pyruvate/malate compared with the absence of inhibitors (Fig. 1B). Rotenone prevented antimycin A-mediated H2O2 generation in mitochondria oxidizing pyruvate/malate (Fig. 1B), as did stigmatellin (Table I). Azide did not increase H2O2 generation in mitochondria oxidizing pyruvate/malate (Table II). With succinate as substrate, mitochondria produced minimal H2O2 in the presence of rotenone (Fig. 1C). Antimycin A markedly increased H2O2 production in mitochondria oxidizing succinate in the presence of rotenone (Fig. 1C). Malonate, a complex II inhibitor, significantly decreased antimycin A-induced H2O2 generation in mitochondria oxidizing succinate (Fig. 1C). Stigmatellin attenuated antimycin A-induced H2O2 production in mitochondria oxidizing succinate (Table I). Azide did not increase H2O2 generation in mitochondria in the presence of succinate (Table II). H 2 O 2 Production in Submitochondrial Particles—Because submitochondrial particles are unable to oxidize glutamate or pyruvate/malate (24Hoppel C. Cooper C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 135: 184-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), NADH was used as the complex I substrate. In contrast to the situation in mitochondria, rotenone inhibition markedly increased H2O2 production in submitochondrial particles oxidizing NADH (Fig. 2A). Similar to findings in mitochondria, antimycin A markedly increased H2O2 production in submitochondrial particles oxidizing NADH. In submitochondrial particles oxidizing NADH, rotenone/antimycin A produced the same amount of H2O2 as did rotenone alone. Interestingly, stigmatellin only partially blocked antimycin A-induced H2O2 generation in submitochondrial particles oxidizing NADH (Fig. 2A). In contrast to results obtained with mitochondria, azide markedly increased H2O2 production from submitochondrial particles oxidizing NADH (Table II). Antimycin A increased H2O2 production in submitochondrial particles oxidizing succinate, whereas stigmatellin attenuated antimycin A-induced H2O2 production (Fig. 2B). Complex IV inhibition with azide did not significantly increase H2O2 generation in submitochondrial particles oxidizing succinate in the presence of rotenone (Table II). In the present study, we found that the production of reactive oxygen species measured as H2O2 differed substantially in mitochondria and corresponding submitochondrial particles. In intact mitochondria, rotenone inhibition of complex I did not increase ROS production with complex I substrates. In contrast, rotenone markedly increased ROS production in submitochondrial particles oxidizing NADH. Inhibition of complex III with antimycin A increased the production of ROS during the oxidation of complex I substrates in both mitochondria and submitochondrial particles. Rotenone inhibition prevented antimycin A-induced ROS generation in mitochondria oxidizing complex I substrates. However, ROS production during NADH oxidation in the presence of rotenone and antimycin A remained increased in submitochondrial particles. Rotenone blocks complex I near the binding site for ubiquinol, the electron acceptor for complex I (28Okun J.G. Lummen P. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2625-2630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Blockade of complex I at this distal site in the complex increases the reduction of the NADH dehydrogenase site of complex I, increasing electron leak to ROS (12Turrens J.F. Boveris A. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). Thus, rotenone blockade should enhance, not decrease, oxyradical production by complex I. The observation of rotenone-enhanced production of H2O2 in submitochondrial particles oxidizing NADH is consistent with this mechanism and with previous observations (12Turrens J.F. Boveris A. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar, 29Turrens J.F. Freeman B.A. Crapo J.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 217: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The NADH dehydrogenase site of electron leak from complex I is located in the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane (30Grigorieff N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, oxidant production from complex I is directed into the mitochondrial matrix and would either result in mitochondrial damage or be inactivated by matrix-antioxidant enzyme systems (23Raha S. McEachern G.E. Myint A.T. Robinson B.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 170-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 31Arai M. Imai H. Koumura T. Yoshida M. Emoto K. Umeda M. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4924-4933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Thus, in mitochondria, ROS production from complex I is likely to be directed into the matrix and detoxified by matrix antioxidant defense systems (Fig. 3). MnSOD will form H2O2 from superoxide (23Raha S. McEachern G.E. Myint A.T. Robinson B.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 170-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), with H2O2 in turn inactivated by glutathione catalyzed by glutathione peroxidase (31Arai M. Imai H. Koumura T. Yoshida M. Emoto K. Umeda M. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4924-4933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 32Simmons T.W. Jamall I.S. Lockshin R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 158-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) or catalase (33Radi R. Turrens J.F. Chang L.Y. Bush K.M. Crapo J.D. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22028-22034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with mitochondria, submitochondrial particles are largely devoid of matrix antioxidant enzymes and have an inverted membrane orientation (23Raha S. McEachern G.E. Myint A.T. Robinson B.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 170-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 24Hoppel C. Cooper C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 135: 184-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, the NADH dehydrogenase can release superoxide into the bulk solution in the absence of antioxidant defense. The observation that rotenone inhibition significantly increased H2O2 production in submitochondrial particles oxidizing NADH supports the finding that complex I is capable of robust H2O2 production. The finding that rotenone inhibition led to only a minimal increase in H2O2 production in mitochondria suggests that complex I is not the major site of net ROS generation in mitochondria that are oxidizing complex I substrates. Complex III is a key site for ROS generation (11Sugioka K. Nakano M. Totsune-Nakano H. Minakami H. Tero-Kubota S. Ikegami Y. Biochim. Biophys.

Complex III has two centers: the Qo center, oriented toward the intermembrane space; and the Qi center, located in the inner membrane and facing the mitochondrial matrix. Superoxide produced at the Qo center is released into the intermembrane space (14St-Pierre J. Buckingham J.A. Roebuck S.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol.

Antimycin A inhibits complex III at the Qi center and increases superoxide generation from the Qo center, directing oxidants away from matrix antioxidant defense (35Demin O.V. Kholodenko B.N. Skulachev V.P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 21-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Gille L. Nohl H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 37Han D.

Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1998; 63: 634-649PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, antimycin A markedly increased H2O2 generation in both mitochondria and submitochondrial particles oxidizing complex I substrates, supporting the idea that the ROS from the complex III Qo center is basically unaffected by antioxidant defense. In the present study, rotenone inhibition prevented antimycin A-induced H2O2 production in mitochondria oxidizing complex I substrates. Complex II inhibition with malonate attenuated antimycin A-induced ROS generation in mitochondria oxidizing succinate. Stigmatellin blocks electron transport into complex III at the Qo center (34Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) leading to a similar attenuation of ROS produced from the complex in the presence of antimycin A. These results suggest that complex III is the main site for net ROS generation in mitochondria, and blockade of electron flow upstream of complex III minimizes ROS production in mitochondria that are oxidizing complex I substrates. This observation suggests a likely mechanism for the observations that administration of rotenone (15Lesnefsky E.J. Moghaddas S. Vazquez E. Hoppel C. FASEB J. 2003; 17 (abstr.): 518PubMed Google Scholar) or a succinate-dehydrogenase inhibitor (39Ockaili R.A. Bhargava P. Kukreja R.C. Am. J.

Cytochrome oxidase inhibition does not increase ROS production from complex IV (19Babcock G.T. Wikstrom M. Nature. 1992; 356: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 20Babcock G.T. Varotsis C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Varotsis C. Zhang Y. Appelman E.H. Babcock G.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) but leads to increased reduction of redox centers in complex I or complex III, enhancing electron leak and ROS generation from these complexes (22Dawson T.L. Gores G.J. Nieminen A.L. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C961-C967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, azide did not increase H2O2 production in mitochondria oxidizing either complex I or complex II substrates. This observation makes complex IV-driven H2O2 generation from the Qo center of complex III less likely. However, azide increased H2O2 generation in submitochondrial particles oxidizing complex I substrates, yet H2O2 production from submitochondrial particles oxidizing succinate was not increased. This observation suggests that azide probably enhances ROS generation from complex I. Because ROS generated at complex I are released into the matrix as discussed above, azide inhibition of complex IV did not enhance ROS generation in mitochondria. In contrast, inhibition of cytochrome oxidase enhanced ROS generation in submitochondrial particles oxidizing NADH, but not succinate, reinforcing the notion of complex I as the major site of ROS production when the electron-transport chain is inhibited at cytochrome oxidase. By introducing a relative block at the Qo site of complex III, inhibition of cytochrome oxidase may augment the production of ROS from complex I but not from complex III. When cytochrome oxidase is inhibited, cytochrome c is reduced (40Partridge R.S. Monroe S.M. Parks J.K. Johnson K. Parker Jr., W.D. Eaton G.R. Eaton S.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), leading to an increased relative reduction of cytochrome c 1 in complex III (34Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). According to the structure-function model of electron flow through complex III (41Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 42Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar), when cytochrome c 1 is reduced the iron-sulfur protein cannot dock with cytochrome c 1, leading to disruption of oxidation of ubiquinol at the Qo site, effectively blocking electron entry into complex III (34Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A block at the Qo site could attenuate oxyradical production from complex III but increase the relative reduction of complex I, leading, in turn, to leak from the NADH dehydrogenase portion of the complex. This proposed mechanism is consistent with the data in the present study that inhibition of cytochrome oxidase enhances ROS production in submitochondrial particles but not in intact mitochondria with complex I substrates. During myocardial ischemia, complex III enhances the production of reactive oxygen species in myocytes (8Becker L.B. vanden Hoek T.L. Shao Z.H. Li C.Q. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H2240-H2246PubMed Google Scholar) and the intact heart (9Kevin L.G. Camara A.K. Riess M.L. Novalija E. Stowe D.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: H566-H574Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Complex III, probably via oxidative mechanisms, mediates damage to the electron-transport chain in hearts (15Lesnefsky E.J. Moghaddas S. Vazquez E. Hoppel C. FASEB J. 2003; 17 (abstr.): 518PubMed Google Scholar). The results of oxidant production following inhibition of cytochrome oxidase obtained in the present study in non-ischemic cardiac mitochondria, as discussed above, strongly suggest that inhibition of complex IV during ischemia cannot be the sole mechanism of enhanced mitochondrial-mediated production of oxidants during ischemia. Thus, ROS production from complex III during ischemia appears to require an additional defect that increases oxidant production from the Qo site. During ischemia, complex III sustains damage to the iron-sulfur peptide with loss of the electron paramagnetic resonance signal in this key component of ubiquinol oxidation at the Qo site (26Lesnefsky E.J. Gudz T.I. Migita C.T. Ikeda-Saito M. Hassan M.O. Turkaly P.J. Hoppel C.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 385: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Functional alterations of the Qo site can disrupt electron flux in this portion of complex III leading to “bypass reactions” of the Qo site that enhance ROS production (43Muller F. Crofts A.R. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7866-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus, ischemic damage may enhance oxidant production from the Qo site of complex III that is blunted by intervention with rotenone (8Becker L.B. vanden Hoek T.L. Shao Z.H. Li C.Q. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H2240-H2246PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lesnefsky E.J. Moghaddas S. Vazquez E. Hoppel C. FASEB J. 2003; 17 (abstr.): 518PubMed Google Scholar), which limits flow into complex III. Our findings suggest that when complex III is modified to increase oxidant production from the Qo site either by the chemical inhibitor antimycin A (11Sugioka K. Nakano M. Totsune-Nakano H. Minakami H. Tero-Kubota S. Ikegami Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 936: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), or perhaps by ischemic damage (26Lesnefsky E.J. Gudz T.I. Migita C.T. Ikeda-Saito M. Hassan M.O. Turkaly P.J. Hoppel C.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 385: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), that inhibition of electron flow upstream of complex III will decrease ROS generation. Interestingly, stigmatellin did not totally block antimycin A-induced ROS generation in submitochondrial particles oxidizing NADH. This suggests that stigmatellin alone causes ROS generation (23Raha S. McEachern G.E. Myint A.T. Robinson B.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 170-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Stigmatellin blocks electron flow at the Qo site of complex III (34Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and will lead to the accumulation of electrons at complex I, enhancing ROS production from this upstream complex in a similar manner to rotenone. In conclusion, complex III is the primary site for net ROS generation in mitochondria and limiting electron flow into complex III prevents ROS production in these organelles. Complex III is the dominant site because ROS products are directed away from the antioxidant defenses of the matrix. In contrast, complex I releases oxidants in the proximity of defense enzyme systems. Inhibition of cytochrome oxidase enhances the production of ROS from certain upstream sites in the electron-transport chain, surprisingly mostly from complex I.

https://openalex.org/W1999452252,"Following the realization of Bose–Einstein condensates in atomic gases, an experimental challenge is the production of molecular gases in the quantum regime. A promising approach is to create the molecular gas directly from an ultracold atomic gas; for example, bosonic atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate have been coupled to electronic ground-state molecules through photoassociation1 or a magnetic field Feshbach resonance2. The availability of atomic Fermi gases offers the prospect of coupling fermionic atoms to bosonic molecules, thus altering the quantum statistics of the system. Such a coupling would be closely related to the pairing mechanism in a fermionic superfluid, predicted to occur near a Feshbach resonance3,4. Here we report the creation and quantitative characterization of ultracold 40K2 molecules. Starting with a quantum degenerate Fermi gas of atoms at a temperature of less than 150 nK, we scan the system over a Feshbach resonance to create adiabatically more than 250,000 trapped molecules; these can be converted back to atoms by reversing the scan. The small binding energy of the molecules is controlled by detuning the magnetic field away from the Feshbach resonance, and can be varied over a wide range. We directly detect these weakly bound molecules through their radio-frequency photodissociation spectra; these probe the molecular wavefunction, and yield binding energies that are consistent with theory."
https://openalex.org/W2077784911,"Transient protein synthesis inhibition is an important protective mechanism used by cells during various stress conditions including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This response centers on the phosphorylation state of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-2α, which is induced by kinases like protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK) and GCN2 to suppress translation and is later reversed so translation resumes. GADD34 was recently identified as the factor that activates the type 1 protein serine/threonine phosphatase (PP1), which dephosphorylates eIF-2α during cellular stresses. Our study delineates a negative feedback regulatory loop in which the eIF-2α-controlled inhibition of protein translation leads to GADD34 induction, which promotes translational recovery. We show that activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4), which is paradoxically translated during the eIF-2α-mediated translational block, is required for the transactivation of the GADD34 promoter in response to ER stress and amino acid deprivation. ATF4 directly binds to and trans-activates a conserved ATF site in the GADD34 promoter during ER stress. Examination of ATF4–/– MEFs revealed an absence of GADD34 induction, prolonged eIF-2α phosphorylation, delayed protein synthesis recovery, and diminished translational up-regulation of BiP during ER stress. These studies demonstrate the essential role of GADD34 in the resumption of protein synthesis, define the pathway for its induction, and reveal that cytoprotective unfolded protein response targets like BiP are sensitive to the eIF-2α-mediated block in translation.

When mammalian cells encounter physiological or chemical stresses that impinge upon the normal folding of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; ORF, open reading frame; UTR, untranslated region; UPR, unfolded protein response; WT, wild type; MEFs, mouse embryonic fibroblasts; Tg, thapsigargin; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays; PERK, protein kinase R-like ER kinase; ATF4, activating transcription factor-4; CHIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. rapid and complex signal transduction cascades, known collectively as the unfolded protein response (UPR), are put into play that are responsible for a number of cytoprotective measures (1Ma Y. Hendershot L.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 827-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 2Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin.

Sci. 2001; 26: 504-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). If homeostasis of the ER cannot be re-established, apoptotic pathways are activated to destroy the damaged cell in order to ultimately protect the organism (5Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar). The protective components of the UPR include the transcriptional up-regulation of ER chaperones and folding enzymes. These proteins bind to unfolded proteins that begin accumulating in the ER and prevent their aggregation. In addition, the increased expression of the chaperones allows for the rapid refolding of nascent secretory pathway proteins once homeostasis has been re-established. A second protective response is the transient block in protein synthesis (6Brostrom C.O. Brostrom M.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 79-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). This limits the load of proteins being introduced into a hostile environment where they would be unable to fold. The inhibition of protein synthesis is not limited to ER proteins and is responsible for a third aspect of the response, which is the arrest of cells in the G1 phase of cell cycle. The inhibition of the synthesis of the short lived cyclin D1 protein results in a rapid depletion of this protein and a concomitant cell cycle arrest (7Brewer J.W. Hendershot L.M. Sherr C.J. Diehl J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8505-8510Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Finally, the up-regulation of proteins associated with proteasomal degradation helps to dispose of the accumulated unfolded proteins, further reducing the load on the ER (8Friedlander R. Jarosch E. Urban J. Volkwein C. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 9Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). In the past 5 years, many components of the signaling pathways controlling these cytoprotective responses have been described. The ER-localized transmembrane protein, ATF6, encodes a cytosolic transcription factor tethered to an ER luminal “stress sensing” domain (10Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). ER stress allows ATF6 to travel to the Golgi where it is cleaved by the S1P and S2P proteases, thus liberating the cytosolic transcription factor domain (11Ye J. Rawson R.B. Komuro R. Chen X. Dave U.P. Prywes R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1355-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar, 12Shen J. Chen X. Hendershot L. Prywes R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Cleaved ATF6 binds to ER stress response elements in the chaperone promoters and up-regulates their transcription. In addition, three transmembrane ER kinases have been identified that also possess luminal “sensing” domains in addition to their cytosolic kinase domains. Two of the kinases, Ire1α and β (13Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1812-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 14Wang X.Z. Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Jolicoeur E.M. Kuroda M. Ron D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5708-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), are orthologues of the sole ER stress transducer in yeast, Ire1p. Like yeast Ire1p, these proteins possess a unique C-terminal endonuclease domain, which upon activation of the kinase domains targets a specific RNA sequence. Most recently, the XBP-1 transcription factor was shown to be the target of endonuclease activity of the mammalian Ire1 (15Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2981) Google Scholar, 16Shen X. Ellis R.E. Lee K. Liu C.Y. Yang K. Solomon A. Yoshida H. Morimoto R. Kurnit D.M. Mori K.

Nature. 2002; 415: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar). The Ire1-catalyzed removal of 26 nucleotides from XBP-1 mRNA followed by a religation reaction alters the XBP-1 reading frame. The remodeled XBP-1 protein encodes a novel transcription factor with the original DNA binding domain tethered to a new transactivation domain. The targets of spliced XBP-1 are not clear but may be involved in ER-associated degradation (18Yoshida H. Matsui T. Hosokawa N. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The ATF6 transcription factor up-regulates XBP-1 mRNA providing a convergence of the Ire1-ATF6 pathways. The third ER stress-transducing kinase is pancreatic eIF-2α kinase (PEK)/PERK (19Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2533) Google Scholar, 20Shi Y. Vattem K.M. Sood R. An J. Liang J. Stramm L. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7499-7509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which shares homology with the luminal domains of Ire1α and -β but does not encode an endonuclease domain. The target of the kinase activity of PERK is the eucaryotic translation initiation factor, eIF-2α. Phosphorylation of eIF-2α during ER stress interferes with the assembly of the translation initiation complex, thereby dramatically diminishing translation (21Scheuner D. Song B. McEwen E. Liu C. Laybutt R. Gillespie P. Saunders T. Bonner-Weir S. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1165-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar, 22Harding H.P. Zeng H. Zhang Y. Jungries R. Chung P. Plesken H. Sabatini D.D. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). This aspect of the UPR is shared by a number of other cellular stresses, which activate different eIF-2α kinases. Interestingly, although most cellular protein synthesis is shut down, translation of the ATF4 transcription factor is specifically induced. ATF4 is constitutively transcribed in non-stressed cells, even though its transcripts cannot be efficiently translated due to the presence of short open reading frames (5′-ORF) in its 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) that interfere with initiation at the proper start codon. During ER stress, these short ORFs are no longer utilized which leads to a dramatic increase in ATF4 protein synthesis (23Harding H.P. Novoa I.I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). One target of the ATF4 transcription factor is the CHOP promoter (24Ma Y. Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Hendershot L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1351-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 25Fawcett T.W. Martindale J.L. Guyton K.Z. Hai T. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), which appears to play a role in the induction of apoptosis during ER stress. Unlike the up-regulation of ER chaperones, the inhibition of protein synthesis during the UPR and other cellular stresses is transient. This is accomplished by inhibition of the PERK kinase itself and dephosphorylation of eIF-2α. Very recently, it was demonstrated that a constitutively expressed double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) inhibitor, p58IPK, is induced during ER stress and plays an important role in down-regulating PERK phosphorylation later during ER stress (26Yan W. Frank C.L. Korth M.J. Sopher B.L. Novoa I. Ron D. Katze M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15920-15925Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 27Van Huizen R. Martindale J.L. Gorospe M. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15558-15564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). GADD34 was originally identified in a screen for genes induced during growth arrest and DNA damage (28Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Later study reveals that the GADD34 protein directly interacts with the catalytic subunit of type 1 protein serine/threonine phosphatase (PP1) and activates the ability of PP1 to dephosphorylate eIF-2α, allowing most protein synthesis to resume (29Novoa I. Zeng H. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 30Connor J.H. Weiser D.C. Li S. Hallenbeck J.M. Shenolikar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6841-6850Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 31Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Jungreis R. Harding H.P. Ron D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The transcription induction of GADD34 during ER and other cellular stresses is dependent on the presence and activity of the respective eIF-2α kinases (29Novoa I. Zeng H. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). The mechanism of GADD34 induction during cellular stress is not presently known. In this study, we demonstrate that the translational induction of ATF4 in response to eIF-2α phosphorylation is immediately upstream of GADD34 induction. ATF4 null MEFs are unable to induce GADD34 mRNA during ER or other cellular stresses, which leads to prolonged eIF-2α phosphorylation and diminished protein synthesis recovery. ATF4 is able to bind specifically to and trans-activate a conserved ATF site in the GADD34 promoter in a stress-dependent manner. Through the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we further demonstrate that ATF4 directly binds to the GADD34 promoter region encompassing the ATF site in an ER stress-dependent manner. Together, our study delineates an autoregulatory loop in which PERK (or presumably other stress-specific eIF-2α kinases) phosphorylates eIF-2α, in turn inhibits protein synthesis, and allows ATF4 translation. This then leads to GADD34 induction, eIF-2α dephosphorylation, and finally the resumption of protein synthesis. Furthermore, our data revealed that BiP up-regulation at the translational level is significantly diminished in ATF4 null cells where protein synthesis inhibition persists, demonstrating that the cytoprotective UPR targets are not immune to the eIF-2α-dependent translational inhibition and thus underscore the importance of translational recovery early in the response. Isolation, Genotyping, Culture, and Treatment of WT and ATF4 Null Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts—Our ATF4 heterozygous mice were generated by Tanaka et al. (32Tanaka T. Tsujimura T. Takeda K. Sugihara A. Maekawa A. Terada N. Yoshida N. Akira S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and were further maintained by Dr. Adrian F. Gombart, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, who kindly provided our breeding pairs. In keeping with previous reports, homozygous ATF4 null mice are born at significantly less than expected Mendelian ratios and are blind due to the lack of lens development (32Tanaka T. Tsujimura T. Takeda K. Sugihara A. Maekawa A. Terada N. Yoshida N. Akira S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 33Hettmann T. Barton K. Leiden J.M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 222: 110-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Mouse embryos were explanted at day 13.5–14.5 of gestation from ATF4 +/– animals to obtain embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (34Kamijo T. Zindy F. Roussel M.F. Quelle D.E. Downing J.R. Ashmun R.A. Grosveld G. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). MEFs were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 55 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 μg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen). Both the amniotic membrane of the embryo and the cultured MEFs were genotyped as illustrated before (32Tanaka T. Tsujimura T. Takeda K. Sugihara A. Maekawa A. Terada N. Yoshida N. Akira S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) with primer pair “a” and “b” for the WT allele and primer pair “b” and “c” for the mutant allele. a is 5′-AAAGGAATGCTCTGGAGTGGAAGACAG; b is 5′-AAGCAAAGCTAAGCCTCCATCTTGTGC; and c is 5′-ATCGCCTTCTATCGCCTTCTTGACGAG. Passage 5–7 MEFs were plated for experiments and were left untreated, treated with Tg (1 μm), or cultured in media that lacked leucine for the indicated periods of time (components of the minus leucine media are based on Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen 11960) with only leucine left out). Isolation and Analysis of Cytoplasmic RNA—Cytoplasmic RNA was harvested using the Qiagen RNeasy miniprep kit following the protocol provided by the supplier. 1 μg of RNA was used to generate 50 μl of cDNA using a poly(dT) primer (1 mm). Semi-quantitative PCR was performed with the fail-safe PCR system from Epicenter using 2 μl of cDNA, 0.25 mm of each primer pair, 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase, and 33 nm [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) for 18–20 cycles. The PCR products were run on a 4% TBE-acrylamide gel, dried, and exposed to film. For quantification data, each radioactive band was quantified using an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager and normalized to the level of γ-actin transcript measured from the same sample. The linear range was monitored by using serial dilutions (1:5 and 1:25) of the sample that showed the highest radioactive signal in each experimental group. The primer pair for mouse γ-actin was 5′-CCGACGGGCAGGTGATCAC (upstream) and 5′-GAGCAGTTAACTTGAATACAAGG (downstream) and for mouse BiP (GRP78) was 5′-GATTCCAAGGAACACTGTGGTA (upstream) and 5′-CAGTAAACAGCCACTTGGGC (downstream). 20 μg of cytoplasmic mRNA from each experimental group was run on a Northern blot as described previously (35Brewer J.W. Cleveland J.L. Hendershot L.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7207-7216Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The probe for BiP was an 800-bp piece amplified from mouse cDNA with oligonucleotides mentioned above. The probe for ATF4 was a 600-bp piece amplified from mouse cDNA with oligonucleotides 5′-CCAGGGGTTCTGTCTTCCAC and 5′-AGCAAACACAGCAACACAAGCA. The probe for GADD34 was an 825-bp piece amplified from mouse cDNA with oligonucleotides 5′-CCCAGACACATGGCCCCG and 5′-TTGTCTCAGGTCCTCCTTCC. The probe for GAPDH is a human fragment purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Western Blot, Metabolic Labeling, and Immunoprecipitation—For direct Western blotting, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysing buffer and separated on a reducing 10% SDS-acrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with the indicated primary antibody as described previously (24Ma Y. Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Hendershot L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1351-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar): polyclonal rabbit anti-BiP (36Hendershot L.M. Wei J.Y. Gaut J.R. Lawson B. Freiden P.J. Murti K.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), rabbit anti-ATF4, goat anti-Hsc70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz CA), rabbit anti-phosphorylated eIF-2α, and monoclonal mouse anti-total eIF-2α (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA). Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (37Lawson B. Brewer J.W. Hendershot L.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In brief, WT or ATF4–/– MEFs were labeled for 30 min with [35S]methionine and -cysteine (Translabel, ICN, Irvine, CA). Cells were then harvested, lysed directly in Nonidet P-40 lysing buffer, and immunoprecipitated with polyclonal rabbit anti-BiP antiserum before electrophoresing on a 10% denaturing SDS gel. 35S signals were quantified using a Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager. Nuclear Extract Purification, Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay, and Supershift Assay—WT or ATF4 null MEFs treated with Tg (1 μm) for the indicated times were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice before nuclear extracts were purified as described (24Ma Y. Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Hendershot L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1351-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The EMSA reaction was performed as described previously (24Ma Y. Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Hendershot L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1351-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) with 10 μg of nuclear extract, 1 μg of dI-dC, 10-fold excess of cold mutant oligonucleotides, and [γ-32P]ATP-labeled probe (10,000 cpm) or 2 μg of supershift antibody when indicated (polyclonal rabbit anti-C/EBPβ and anti-ATF4 antisera were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The double strand synthetic oligonucleotide probes were annealed and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP as described (24Ma Y. Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Hendershot L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1351-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). A 29-bp CHOP C/EBP-ATF WT probe was designed as described previously (24Ma Y. Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Hendershot L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1351-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Similarly, a 29-bp sequence containing –77 to –53 bp of the mouse GADD34 promoter (5′-GATCGCTCTCCGGTGACGTCAGCACAGCA) was designated mGADD34-ATF. For the mutant oligonucleotides, the GTGACGTCAG sequence of the WT probe containing the ATF site was altered to acttatgtca. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (CHIP) Assay—The CHIP assay was performed with the CHIP kit from Upstate Biotechnology, Cell Signaling Solutions (Lake Placid, NY), and according to the protocol provided by Upstate Biotechnology with the following modifications. Instead of using whole cell lysates, nuclear extracts were harvested from non-stressed and Tg-treated (1 μm, 6 h) NIH3T3 cells using method described before (24Ma Y. Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Hendershot L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1351-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The cross-linked chromatin-protein complexes were sonicated to obtain chromatin fragments with an average length of ∼600–700 bp. Polyclonal rabbit anti-YY-1 antibody was used in the negative control immunoprecipitation, and a polyclonal rabbit anti-ATF4 antibody was used for ATF4 immunoprecipitation (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Two targeted sequences were amplified by 25 cycles of PCR in the presence of 33 nm [α-32P]dCTP. The primer pair used to amplify region A of the mouse GADD34 promoter was 5′-GCTCGGAAATTACGTGAGATCG and 5′-GCGCCAACATCGTCCACGCG. The pair for the amplification of region B was 5′-GGGCAGCCAGGGCTATACTG and 5′-GGTGTACAAGGAGGTCGGAAG. Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase Assay—Sequences encompassing –721 to +130 bp of the mouse GADD34 promoter was cloned into a CAT reporter vector using PCR-based method as mentioned before (24Ma Y. Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Hendershot L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1351-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The ATF site (TGACGTCA) alone was deleted in the mutant promoter construct with the Stratagene Quickchange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Cedar Creek, TX). 1 μg of WT or mutant construct was transfected into COS-1 cells, and cell lysates were analyzed for CAT activity as described before (24Ma Y. Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Hendershot L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1351-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Each experimental group was analyzed in triplicate, normalized against protein concentration, and then repeated twice. The error bars shown in Fig. 6D were calculations of standard deviations for each triplicate experiment. Isolation and Analysis of ATF4 Null Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts—Recently, the stress-induced GADD34 protein was shown to bind to the PP1 phosphatase and activate the dephosphorylation of eIF-2α, thereby triggering the resumption of protein translation during cellular stresses (29Novoa I. Zeng H. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 30Connor J.H. Weiser D.C. Li S. Hallenbeck J.M. Shenolikar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6841-6850Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 31Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Jungreis R. Harding H.P. Ron D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Induction of GADD34 during ER stress and amino acid deprivation stress did not occur in PERK–/– or GCN2–/– cells, respectively, which are defective in the initial block in protein synthesis during ER stress or amino acid deprivation (29Novoa I. Zeng H. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). This suggests the presence of a feedback regulatory loop, in which the eIF-2α kinases block protein synthesis and by an unknown mechanism induce GADD34, which then allows translation to resume. Ron and co-workers (29Novoa I. Zeng H. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar) suggested that this might occur either via a mechanism similar to the induction of ATF4 where small 5′-ORFs that interfere with correct translation initiation are suppressed by the inhibition of protein synthesis thus allowing initiation at the correct site or, conversely, that GADD34 might be a target of the ATF4 transcription factor. To address the role of ATF4 in the activation of GADD34 directly, we isolated WT and ATF4 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) by mating ATF4 +/– mice. To confirm the lack of ATF4 transcription and translation in these cells, cytoplasmic mRNA and whole cell lysates were harvested from WT and ATF4–/– cells that were left untreated or treated with Tg to induce ER stress. The ATF4 transcript was detected using Northern blotting (Fig. 1B), and ATF4 protein expression was detected via Western blotting (Fig. 1A). ATF4 message was detected only in the WT MEFs but not in the ATF4 null MEFs (Fig. 1B). Consistent with published data, ATF4 was constitutively transcribed but not translated in WT cells under non-stressed conditions. ATF4 protein, as detected by Western blotting, was induced in WT MEFs as early as 2 h after Tg treatment but could not be detected even after 8 h of UPR activation in ATF4 null cells (Fig. 1A). When nuclear extracts harvested from either WT or ATF4–/– cells were added in gel shift assays, ATF4 binding was detected only with those from WT cells (Fig. 6C). These data confirm the lack of ATF4 transcripts and protein in our null MEFs both before and after ER stress. The targeted disruption of the ATF4 allele was generated by replacing the second exon of ATF4 gene containing the basic leucine zipper domain, which is essential for the dimerization of ATF4 and DNA binding ability, with the neomycin resistance gene (32Tanaka T. Tsujimura T. Takeda K. Sugihara A. Maekawa A. Terada N. Yoshida N. Akira S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus, even if a partial ATF4 protein was expressed that was not recognized by our antibody, it would not be functional due to the lack of the leucine zipper domain. Induction of BiP Transcription Was Intact in ATF4–/– Cells—To begin characterizing the ER stress response in the ATF4 null cells, we first analyzed the transcriptional up-regulation of the ER chaperone BiP. BiP transcription is a target of the ATF6 transcription factor (38Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and may be partially regulated by Ire1-altered XBP-1 (15Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2981) Google Scholar, 39Lee K. Tirasophon W. Shen X. Michalak M. Prywes R. Okada T. Yoshida H. Mori K. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 452-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) and thus represents a read-out of these arms of the UPR. We harvested cytoplasmic mRNA from WT as well as ATF4–/– cells that had been treated with Tg for the indicated times, and we performed both Northern blotting and semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCRs to detect the BiP transcript (Fig. 1, B–D). As early as 2 h after Tg treatment, an increase in BiP transcripts could be detected in both cells, with BiP mRNA levels continuing to build throughout the time course (Fig. 1B). Results from three independent reverse transcriptase-PCRs were quantified, normalized to the actin signal, and summarized in Fig. 1D, demonstrating that ATF4 null MEFs responded to Tg treatment by inducing BiP transcripts equally well as their wild type counterparts. This verifies that both WT and ATF4 null cells experienced and responded to ER stress as expected and suggests that at least the ATF6-ER stress response element signaling pathway is intact in the null cells. Furthermore, our data directly demonstrate that ATF4 is not required for the induction of BiP transcription during ER stress. Prolonged eIF-2α Phosphorylation in ATF4–/– Cells—To determine whether the PERK activation signal was intact in these cells, we monitored the phosphorylation status of its target protein, eIF-2α, during the course of ER stress using an antiserum that is specific for the phospho-form. WT and ATF4–/– cells were treated with Tg for the indicated periods of time, and protein blots were analyzed (Fig. 2A). The level of total eIF-2α was also measured as a loading control. Phosphorylation of eIF-2α peaked from 0.5 to 1.5 h after Tg treatment in both WT and ATF4–/– cells, although that in the"

PTDs have become widely used as tools for the delivery of high M r polypetides, polynucleotides, or nanoparticles to cells in culture; and even the transfer of cargo molecules to the tissue of live animals has been reported. These cell-permeable peptides are functional when fused in-frame to recombinant polypeptides or when chemically coupled to their cargo. The mechanism responsible for PTD-mediated membrane translocation is controversially discussed and may vary among the various PTDs reported in the literature. Thus direct physical interaction with membrane lipids resulting in vectorial delivery to cells has been proposed for the Antennapedia (Antp) PTD, whereas uptake by the retroviral TAT (transactivator of transcription) protein PTD seems to require cell surface-expressed glycosaminoglycans. The view that PTD-mediated cellular uptake is energy-independent has been dismissed recently as an artifact resulting from fixation of cells. The data reported here agree with and further extend this work. They support the idea that certain PTDs promote cellular uptake via endocytosis and require the expression of negatively charged glycosaminoglycans on the surface of the target cells. Uptake of Antp PTD conjugates or peptide-derivatized liposomes was blocked by heparan sulfate proteoglycans, whereas TAT-mediated uptake was inhibited by both heparin and dextran sulfate. Mutant cells defective for glycosaminoglycan synthesis showed dramatically reduced Antp- or TAT-mediated transmembrane transport confirming the role of these complex polysaccharides in PTD-mediated cellular uptake. The fact that PTDs selectively interact with distinct glycosaminoglycan species has implications for therapeutic applications and may allow targeting of selective tissues that differ in their surface-expressed glycosaminoglycan patterns.

Uptake of charged molecules or high molecular weight compounds into live cells is hampered by the lipophilic nature of the plasma membrane. Thus high amounts of drugs are often required to maintain pharmacologically active concentrations in the target tissue of an organism.

More recently, additional cellular and viral proteins with similar features have been described, such as VP22, a herpesvirus protein involved in regulating transcription, and Antennapedia (Antp) a transcription factor discovered first in insect cells. In all of these proteins, the activity of translocating across cellular membranes is confined to a short stretch of less than 20 amino acids highly enriched in basic residues. These sequences are now called “protein transduction domains” or PTD sequences and act independently from other protein motifs. They have been used both in vitro and in vivo to target proteins, nucleic acid polymers, or nanoparticles (such as liposomes) to cells (reviewed in Refs. 3Fischer P.M. Krausz E. Lane D.P.

The mechanism responsible for PTD-dependent membrane translocation is controversially discussed and may vary among the various PTDs. In recent papers, it has been proposed that Antp peptide-mediated membrane translocation is an energy-independent process and may be a direct consequence of PTD association with membrane lipids (8Vivès E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2068) Google Scholar, 9Derossi D. Calvet S. Trembleau A. Brunissen A. Chassaing G.

This mechanism would require the formation of transient micelles that are subsequently transferred to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane where cargo molecules are then released. This concept has been questioned in the meantime, and it has been demonstrated that PTD translocation at low temperature is an artifact resulting from the fixation of cells (10Richard J.P. Melikov K.

A detailed study of the role of HPSGs in TAT-mediated intracellular transport showed that TAT basic peptide also interferes with the release of newly synthesized HPSGs from cells (17Sandgren S. Cheng F. Belting M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38877-38883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Following this line of work, we investigated the uptake mechanism of Antp and TAT PTD protein complexes. The transport to cells by both PTDs occurred only at 37 °C and depended on the expression of negatively charged glycosaminoglycans on the surface of the target cells. PTD complexes associated first with the cell surface and were then rapidly translocated to cytoplasmic vesicles resembling early endosomes. After prolonged exposure of cells at 37 °C, the material accumulated in intracellular vesicular structures. Liposomes tagged with PTD peptides were similarly internalized within the cells thereby improving their potential use for intracellular drug delivery. Materials—The antibodies for staining lysosomes were G1/139 against human Lamp1 (18Schweizer A. Fransen J.A. Bachi T. Ginsel L. Hauri H.P. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Fluorescent avidin and streptavidin and secondary antibodies were from Southern Biotech (Birmingham, AL). Glycosaminoglycans and dextran sulfate were from Sigma, except for heparin, which was a kind gift from Dr. H. P. Wessel (Hoffman-La Roche). Soybean phosphatidylcholine (SPC) was obtained from L. Meyer (Hamburg, Germany). Cholesterol (Chol) was purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), 2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE) from Sygena (Liestal, Switzerland), and 3,3′-dioctadecyloxa-gcarbocyanine perchlorate (DiO) from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Sulfo-SMCC was purchased from Pierce (Lausanne, Switzerland). The mouse melanoma cell line B16F1 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and Nystatin. Wild type CHO K1, CHO pgs A-677, and CHO pgs A-745 cells were from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were maintained in Ham's F12 medium (20Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Peptide Synthesis—The peptides were synthesized on a Milligen 9050 automated peptide synthesizer (continuous flow), employing the fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl strategy and protocols from our laboratory reported previously (22García-Echeverría C. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1996; 6: 229-232Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 23García-Echeverría C. Stamm C. Wille R. Arz D. Gay B. Lett. Pept. Sci. 1997; 4: 49-53Google Scholar). After completion of the syntheses, the peptide resins were simultaneously cleaved and deprotected with trifluoroacetic acid/water/ethanedithiol (76:4:20, v/v/v) for 3 h at room temperature, and the crude compounds were purified by reverse-phase medium chromatography on a C18 column (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid-water/acetonitrile gradient). The purity of the peptides was verified by reverse-phase analytical high pressure liquid chromatography, and the identities of the final products were assessed by amino acid and mass spectral analyses (matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF)) analyses. The analytical linear gradient was applied over 2.5 min consisting of acetonitrile, 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid and water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid from 1:19 to 3:2 on a Chromolith SpeedROD RP-18e column (50 × 4.6 mm), at a flow rate of 4.0 ml/min; detection at 215 nm; single peak at retention time = 1.45 min (TAT peptide) and retention time = 2 min (Antp peptide). Quantitative amino acid analyses of the peptides revealed the expected amino acid compositions. MALDI-TOF (negative-ion mode) found 2031.5 (calculated 2031.5) for the TAT peptide and 2718.2 (calculated 2718.4) for the Antp peptide. Internalization of TAT and Antennapedia Peptide Complexes in HeLa Cells—HeLa cells were cultured on coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Internalization of peptide complexed with either fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled avidin or streptavidin was performed as follows. A 1-μm solution of biotinylated peptide was preincubated with 1 μm fluorescently labeled avidin or streptavidin at room temperature for 30 min with or without inhibitory glycosaminoglycans (50 μg/ml) in Opti-MEM I. Peptide complexes were added to washed HeLa cells on cover-slips in Opti-MEM I at 4 °C for 30 min. The cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde or incubated in fresh Opti-MEM I prewarmed to 37 °C for the indicated times to follow protein transduction in the cells. The cells were permeabilized with 0.25% Saponin for 3 min for costaining of internalized FITC avidin ·peptide with antibodies recognizing transferrin (a marker for early endosomes (19Vollenweider F. Kappeler F. Itin C. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar)) or Lamp1 (a lysosomal protein (18Schweizer A. Fransen J.A. Bachi T. Ginsel L. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1643-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar)). 1% TRITC-labeled dextran was added as a marker for fluid-phase endocytosis in the corresponding assays. The cells were embedded in gelvatol and analyzed on a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope with epi-illuminescence using a 40× NA 1.4 water immersion lens. Photomicrographs were taken with a Kappa CF 8/1 CCD camera; exposure time was 5 ms for all pictures in the series. Confocal series were acquired with an LSM 410 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The Imaris software (Bitplane AG, Zürich, Switzerland) was used for image analysis. Liposome Preparation and Modification—The liposomes were composed of SPC:Chol:DPPE:DiO at a molar ratio of 1:0.2:0.035:0.004. Small unilamellar liposomes were prepared by sequential filter extrusion of multilamellar liposomal preparations in Soerensen phosphate buffer (SPB, 13 mm KH2PO4, 54 mm NaHPO4, pH 7.4) through Nucleopore membranes (Sterico, Dietikon, Switzerland) of 0.2 μm and 0.1 μm pore diameter with a Lipex extruder (Lipex Biomembranes Inc., Van-couver, British Columbia, Canada). Size and stability of the liposomes were analyzed with a particle sizer (Nicomp Model 370, Santa Barbara, CA). For peptide modification, liposomes in SPB were incubated with crystalline sulfo-SMCC at a molar ratio for amino groups to maleimide groups of 1:5 for 30 min at 30 °C. Excess sulfo-SMCC was removed by dialysis overnight at 4 °C against SPB. 3 mg of PTD peptide or cysteine as a control were incubated with 1 ml of sulfo-SMCC-modified liposomes for 20 h at room temperature in 2 mm tributylphosphine under an argon atmosphere. Nonreacted peptide was removed by dialysis against SPB. Flow Cytometry—Cells (2 × 105 cells in 12-well plates) were grown for 24 h at 37 °C. The medium was removed, and the cells were incubated in serum-free Opti-MEM I for 30 min at 37 °C. Before addition to the cells, PTD ·streptavidin complexes or PTD-derivatized liposomes were preincubated with or without 20 μg/ml polysaccharide at room temperature for 15 min. The cells were incubated with the complex in serum-free Opti-MEM I at 37 °C. Complexes were removed, and the cells were cultured in growth medium as described above for 90 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed with PBS (0.137 m NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 8.09 mm Na2HPO4, 1.76 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), detached from the plates with 10 mm EDTA in PBS, washed in PBS, and either used directly or after fixation in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for flow cytometric analysis. Internalization of PTD complexes or liposomes was determined in a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). 10,000 cells were analyzed per data point, and all experiments were carried out in triplicate. PTD peptide sequences derived from TAT and Antp were SGYGRKKRRQRRRC and SGRQIKIWFQNRRMKWKKC, respectively. They were both chemically synthesized, biotinylated at the N terminus, and carried a C-terminal cysteine residue for chemical coupling to cargo molecules. The Ser-Gly dipeptide at the N terminus was used as a spacer between the peptide and biotin. These peptides were efficiently delivered to cells and could be detected with FITC-labeled avidin or streptavidin in fixed and permeabilized cells as described earlier (8Vivès E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2068) Google Scholar) (data not shown). PTD-mediated cellular uptake was next investigated with FITC-labeled avidin or streptavidin conjugated with biotinylated PTD peptide. Intracellular transport of this complex was studied in a variety of cell lines such as HeLa, B16 melanoma, and CHO cells. Complexes were rapidly taken up by all cell types tested. Figs. 1 and 2 show representative data for HeLa cells. FITC-labeled avidin or streptavidin was first preincubated for 15 min with either biotinylated Antp or TAT peptide followed by incubation with cells at 0 °C. The labeled material accumulated in small patches on the surface of the cells (Figs. 1A and 2A). FITC-labeled avidin or streptavidin did not associate with cells in the absence of PTD peptide or when bound to a peptide lacking a PTD domain (Figs. 1O, 2O, and data not shown). This indicates that membrane binding was a specific event mediated by PTD peptide.Fig. 2Cell binding and internalization of FITC-labeled avidin ·TAT peptide complexes. Treatment and analysis of cells are as described in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cells incubated with FITC-avidin ·peptide complexes were then washed and further incubated at 37 °C in growth medium to induce internalization. As seen in Figs. 1B and 2B, fluorescently labeled material was internalized within minutes and accumulated in vesicular structures resembling early endosomes. These vesicles partially colocalized with TRITC-labeled dextran added during the chase period at 37 °C as a marker for fluid-phase endocytosis (data given in supplemental Fig. A). A marker protein for early endosomes, the transferrin receptor, showed similar localization as avidin ·PTD complexes (data given in supplemental Fig. B). After incubation for 1–3 h at 37 °C, the material was confined to intracellular vesicles (Figs. 1C and 2C). Antp complexes showed partial colocalization with lysosomes (data given in supplemental Fig. B), whereas TAT accumulated in vesicular structures located at the cell periphery (data given in supplemental Fig. C). To prove that PTD complexes were internalized during the chase period at 37 °C, cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Z-sections through cells (Figs. 1 and 2, Z/X and Z/Y) showed that the material was predominantly associated with the extracellular face of the plasma membrane before the chase (Figs. 1D and 2D). Upon extended incubation at 37 °C, both Antp (Fig. 1, F and G) and TAT (Fig. 2, F and G) complexes were transferred to intracellular vesicular structures, whereas after a 10-min chase, most of the material remained on the extracellular surface. Taken together, our data show that both PTDs initially bind to the cell surface in a temperature-independent way where they cluster in small patches on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane. Upon shifting the cells to 37 °C, the material was internalized in intracellular vesicular structures by a mechanism resembling fluid-phase endocytosis. We next investigated the mechanism responsible for PTD-mediated cellular uptake. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were incubated with FITC-labeled streptavidin ·PTD complex for 90 min at 37 °C, washed, removed from tissue culture plates with EDTA solution, washed again in PBS, and submitted to flow cytometric analysis. Fig. 3A shows that heparin inhibited association with and internalization of TAT complexes by 60–70%, whereas uptake of streptavidin ·Antp complex was reduced by 40–50%. Dextran sulfate inhibited uptake of TAT but not of Antp complexes. Other glycosaminoglycans such as chondroitin sulfate A, B, and C and hyaluronic acid had no effect on PTD-mediated cellular uptake (data not shown). No cellular uptake was observed in controls performed with FITC-labeled streptavidin in the absence of PTD peptide (Fig. 3A). It has recently been shown that fixation of cells promotes artifactual association of PTD peptides with cells (10Richard J.P. Melikov K. Vivès E. Ramos C. Verbeure B. Gait M.J. Chernomordik L.V. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 585-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar). To rule this out for our experiments, we analyzed cells incubated with PTD complex before and after fixation by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 3C, the amount of PTD complex bound to cells and inhibition by heparin was not changed. Similar experiments were then performed with PTD-derivatized phosphatidylcholine liposomes. The PTD peptides were coupled via a cysteine residue to maleimide derivatized lipids (24Marty C. Odermatt B. Schott H. Neri D. Ballmer-Hofer K. Klemenz R. Schwendener R.A. Br. J. Cancer. 2002; 87: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, uptake of TAT peptide-modified liposomes was increased 10-fold, whereas Antp-derivatized liposomes were internalized 50 times more efficiently than control liposomes modified with cysteine instead of a PTD peptide. The difference in uptake efficiency presumably results from the fact that TAT-derivatized liposomes tend to form large aggregates that are less well internalized. Uptake of liposomes into CHO cells was blocked by heparin and dextran sulfate but not by other glycosaminoglycans such as chondroitin A (Fig. 3B) or chondroitins B and C and hyaluronic acid (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that cell surface-expressed glycosaminoglycans, in particular HPSGs, are required for TAT and Antp PTD-mediated cellular uptake of proteins and liposomes. Dextran sulfate polymers and heparan sulfates inhibited uptake by TAT, whereas Antp-dependent protein uptake was blocked only by heparan sulfates. This suggests differential binding of these peptides to negatively charged extracellular glycosaminoglycans and also indicates that TAT and Antp PTDs rely on different oligosaccharides for initial membrane binding. PTD-derivatized liposome uptake was indiscriminately blocked by inhibitory polysaccharides such as dextran sulfate and heparin. To corroborate these findings, we investigated PTD uptake into mutant CHO cells deficient in glycosaminoglycan synthesis. Neither Antp nor TAT peptide complexes were efficiently internalized in the mutant cell line (pgs A-745) lacking UDP-d-xylose:serine β-1,3-d-xylosyltransferase (21Lidholt K. Weinke J.L. Kiser C.S. Lugemwa F.N. Bame K.J. Cheifetz S. Massague J. Lindahl U. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2267-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). These cells are deficient in the synthesis of all proteoglycans. A second mutant (pgs A-677) expressing reduced amounts of HPSG because of an ∼10-fold reduction in N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase and glucuronosyltransferase (20Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) showed a reduction in the uptake of Antp but not of TAT ·streptavidin complexes. This suggests that the low amount of HPSG expressed by these cells still allowed PTD-mediated cellular uptake. The data presented here show that the major route for TAT and Antp peptide-mediated cellular uptake of protein molecules and nanoparticles is endocytosis. Uptake by these PTDs was temperature-dependent, indicative of a step requiring energy. The material that initially accumulated on the cell surface in small patches (a process that was temperature-independent) was then followed by internalization in intracellular vesicular structures. The nature of these patches is unclear; they may represent plasma membrane microdomains such as lipid rafts that are enriched in particular membrane proteins carrying, for instance, HPSG polysaccharide chains. The route and kinetics of uptake are similar to those followed by markers for fluid-phase endocytosis such as fluorescent dextran conjugates. Uptake of avidin · or streptavidin ·PTD complexes prepared with either Antp or TAT peptide was blocked by negatively charged high M r glycosaminoglycans. TAT-mediated binding was blocked by heparan and dextran sulfate, whereas Antp-dependent uptake was blocked only by heparan sulfate. This suggests that the basic character of PTDs promotes their interaction with negatively charged complex sulfated glycosaminoglycans exposed on the surface of cells. Uptake of both Antp and TAT PTD-derivatized liposomes was similarly blocked by heparin and dextran sulfate. The fact that cells deficient in glycosaminoglycan synthesis showed reduced PTD uptake further supports this notion. Specificity of the various PTDs for different types of glycosaminoglycans may arise from the positive charge distribution in various PTDs; in other words, high affinity interaction with negatively charged sulfated polysaccharides expressed on the cell surface may require proper alignment with the positive charges on a particular PTD. The possibility that PTDs discriminate between different surface-expressed glycosaminoglycans has been discussed earlier for TAT (12Rusnati M. Tulipano G. Urbinati C. Tanghetti E. Giuliani R.

Kresse H. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Finally, Sandgren et al. (17Sandgren S. Cheng F. Belting M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38877-38883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) recently published work in which they investigated the role of HPSGs in TAT-mediated cellular uptake in detail. Differential interaction of PTDs with glycosaminoglycans might open new possibilities for the delivery of reagents to specific tissues using more selective PTD sequences. Further optimization of PTD peptides might thus improve their translocation efficiency and may even allow the development of tissue-specific PTDs (26García-Echeverría C. Jiang L. Ramsey T.M. Sharma S.K. Chen Y.P. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001; 11: 1363-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The exact localization of cell-associated PTD complexes has not always been critically evaluated in earlier work. We therefore analyzed confocal micrographs such as those shown in Figs. 1 and 2 with an image-processing software. Z-sections of confocal data sets show that fluorescent material initially accumulated in patches on the cell surface, in particular at sites of cell-cell contact. As early as 10 min after shifting cells to a high temperature, fluorescent material appeared in intracellular vesicular structures resembling endosomes. Partial colocalization of PTD complexes with a marker for fluid-phase endocytosis further suggests that uptake is through endocytosis, as proposed earlier (1Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1988; 55: 1189-1193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2352) Google Scholar, 2Mann D.A. Frankel A.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1733-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). 1–2 h after incubation at 37 °C, PTD ·cargo complexes accumulated in intracellular vesicular structures. In the case of TAT, these vesicles were localized close to the cell periphery, whereas Antp PTD complexes showed perinuclear staining partially overlapping with a lysosomal marker. The route of cell entry and the turnover of TAT ·cargo complexes inside cells have also been investigated in detail recently (17Sandgren S. Cheng F. Belting M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38877-38883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These authors showed that cellular uptake of TAT ·PTD complexes was via endocytosis and that the complexes were subsequently targeted to the nucleus. Together with our data, this suggests that TAT and Antp PTDs target their cargo to different cellular organelles. Cellular uptake by Antp PTD sequences has not been investigated in detail so far. It has been proposed that Antp peptide directly interacts with membrane lipids (6Derossi D. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 84-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 9Derossi D. Calvet S. Trembleau A. Brunissen A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar), a finding that we and others have not been able to confirm (27Kramer S.D. Wunderli-Allenspach H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1609: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). 2S. Console, C. Marty, C. García-Echeverría, R. Schwendener, and K. Ballmer-Hofer, unpublished work. We cannot exclude the possibility, however, that the exact route of cell entry and the transfer to intracellular vesicles may differ for various PTDs. It will be of crucial importance for the further development of PTD technology to dissect these pathways for all PTD sequences, as each PTD might be destined for a specific cellular compartment. Liposomes are useful for the delivery of fragile reagents that are rapidly degraded in the bloodstream. The drawback is that the release of the liposomal content into target cells is limited by the slow uptake of these vehicles into cells, and little is known about the mechanism of liposome-mediated drug delivery. It is generally assumed that liposomes release their content upon fusion with intracellular membranes. We show here that uptake of PTD-tagged liposomes is dramatically accelerated when compared with control liposomes. This is in agreement with earlier work where similarly modified liposomes have been shown to be efficiently internalized in cells even at low temperature (28Torchilin V.P. Rammohan R. Weissig V. Levchenko T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8786-8791Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). A detailed analysis of the intracellular localization of liposomes was, however, not performed in this study. Based on the data shown here and on recently published work (10Richard J.P. Melikov K.

Chem. 2003; 278: 585-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar), it is possible that liposomes associated with cells at low temperature (as shown in that study) were actually bound to the cell surface rather than being translocated to cells. In summary, our study extends recently published work (10Richard J.P. Melikov K. Vivès E. Ramos C. Verbeure B. Gait M.J. Chernomordik L.V. Lebleu B. J. Biol.

PTD complexes initially accumulate on the surface of target cells and are subsequently translocated across the plasma membrane upon incubation of cells at 37 °C but not at 0 °C. The earlier proposal that PTD peptides penetrate membranes upon direct interaction with the lipid bilayer, although not formally excluded, seems not to apply for uptake of the high M r cargo molecules used here (Ref. 29Thoren P.E.

https://openalex.org/W2150218627,"Millisecond pulsars are neutron stars that are thought to have been spun-up by mass accretion from a stellar companion. It is not known whether there is a natural brake for this process, or if it continues until the centrifugal breakup limit is reached at submillisecond periods. Many neutron stars that are accreting mass from a companion star exhibit thermonuclear X-ray bursts that last tens of seconds, caused by unstable nuclear burning on their surfaces. Millisecond-period brightness oscillations during bursts from ten neutron stars (as distinct from other rapid X-ray variability that is also observed) are thought to measure the stellar spin, but direct proof of a rotational origin has been lacking. Here we report the detection of burst oscillations at the known spin frequency of an accreting millisecond pulsar, and we show that these oscillations always have the same rotational phase. This firmly establishes burst oscillations as nuclear-powered pulsations tracing the spin of accreting neutron stars, corroborating earlier evidence. The distribution of spin frequencies of the 11 nuclear-powered pulsars cuts off well below the breakup frequency for most neutron-star models, supporting theoretical predictions that gravitational radiation losses can limit accretion torques in spinning up millisecond pulsars."

The oligomer size distributions of aggregate-free, low molecular weight Aβ40 and Aβ42 can be assessed quantitatively using the technique of photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins. This approach revealed that low molecular weight Aβ40 is a mixture of monomer, dimer, trimer, and tetramer, in rapid equilibrium, whereas low molecular weight Aβ42 preferentially exists as pentamer/hexamer units (paranuclei), which self-associate to form larger oligomers. Here, photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins was used to evaluate systematically the oligomerization of 34 physiologically relevant Aβ alloforms, including those containing familial Alzheimer's disease-linked amino acid substitutions, naturally occurring N-terminal truncations, and modifications altering the charge, the hydrophobicity, or the conformation of the peptide. The most important structural feature controlling early oligomerization was the length of the C terminus. Specifically, the side-chain of residue 41 in Aβ42 was important both for effective formation of paranuclei and for self-association of paranuclei into larger oligomers. The side-chain of residue 42, and the C-terminal carboxyl group, affected paranucleus self-association. Aβ40 oligomerization was particularly sensitive to substitutions of Glu22 or Asp23 and to truncation of the N terminus, but not to substitutions of Phe19 or Ala21. Aβ42 oligomerization, in contrast, was largely unaffected by substitutions at positions 22 or 23 or by N-terminal truncations, but was affected significantly by substitutions of Phe19 or Ala21. These results reveal how specific regions and residues control Aβ oligomerization and show that these controlling elements differ between Aβ40 and Aβ42.

An AβPP mutation causing reduction of total Aβ levels accompanied by accelerated Aβ assembly into protofibrils has been linked to early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) in a Swedish kindred (25Nilsberth C. Westlind-Danielsson A. Eckman C.B. Condron M.M. Axelman K. Forsell C. Stenh C. Luthman J. Teplow D.B. Younkin S.G. Naslund J. Lannfelt L. Nat.

These findings support an important role for Aβ oligomers in the etiology of AD and thus make Aβ oligomers attractive therapeutic targets. If effective drug design strategies targeting Aβ oligomers are to be developed, detailed knowledge of the structures and assembly dynamics of these oligomers must be obtained. However, the biophysical and structural characterization of oligomeric Aβ assemblies has been difficult due to their metastable nature. Previously, we demonstrated that the size distribution of Aβ oligomers could be determined quantitatively (26Bitan G. Lomakin A. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35176-35184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 27Bitan G. Kirkitadze M.D. Lomakin A. Vollers S.S. Benedek G.B. Teplow D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

This approach revealed that low molecular weight (LMW) Aβ40, rather than existing in a stable monomeric or dimeric state, as previously suggested (30Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M.

In contrast, LMW Aβ42 produced a distinct oligomer distribution in which the main components were pentamer/hexamer units (paranuclei), which then formed larger oligomers through self-association (27Bitan G. Kirkitadze M.D. Lomakin A. Vollers S.S. Benedek G.B. Teplow D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Here, PICUP was used to determine systematically the effects of primary structure modifications on early Aβ oligomerization. We studied Aβ42 analogues bearing modifications at the C-terminal dipeptide, Aβ40 and Aβ42 analogues containing clinically relevant mutations at or near the central hydrophobic cluster (CHC), N-terminally truncated alloforms of Aβ40 and Aβ42 found in amyloid plaques, and Aβ40 analogues containing substitutions that alter the net charge of the peptide. The results advance our understanding of early Aβ assembly, provide deeper mechanistic insight into the distinct oligomerization behaviors of Aβ40 and Aβ42, and suggest new targets for AD therapy. Peptides and Reagents—Aβ40, Aβ42, and analogues thereof (Table I) were synthesized by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry, purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and characterized by mass spectroscopy and amino acid analysis, as described (32Lomakin A.

Open table in a new tab Isolation of LMW Aβ—LMW fractions of Aβ alloforms were isolated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), as described previously (26Bitan G. Lomakin A. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35176-35184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Briefly, 170 μl of a 2 mg/ml peptide solution prepared in Me2SO was fractionated using a 10/30 Superdex 75 HR column eluted at 0.5 ml/min with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Peaks were detected by UV absorbance at 254 nm. A 10-μl aliquot of each fraction was taken for amino acid analysis a posteriori to determine the peptide concentration. Typical concentrations were 30 ± 10 μm. SEC reproducibly yielded comparable LMW fractions for all of the peptides used. Recent studies (27Bitan G. Kirkitadze M.D. Lomakin A. Vollers S.S. Benedek G.B. Teplow D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar) have shown that LMW Aβ prepared using SEC readily forms paranuclei and higher order oligomers, facilitating study of these assembly processes. For this purpose, SEC was superior to base pretreatment protocols (34Fezoui Y. Hartley D.M. Harper J.D. Khurana R. Walsh D.M. Condron M.M. Selkoe D.J. Lansbury P.T. Fink A.L. Teplow D.B. Amyloid: Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 2000; 7: 166-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Cross-linking and SDS-PAGE Analysis—Freshly isolated LMW peptides were immediately subjected to PICUP, as described (26Bitan G. Lomakin A. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35176-35184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μl of 1 mm Ru(Bpy) and 1 μl of 20 mm ammonium persulfate in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, were added to 18 μl of freshly isolated LMW peptide. The mixture was irradiated for 1 s with visible light, and the reaction was quenched immediately with 10 μl tricine sample buffer (Invitrogen) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Concentration differences caused some variability in the relative abundance of each oligomer but did not alter the overall profile of the oligomer size distribution of each peptide (26Bitan G. Lomakin A. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35176-35184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). To examine further the question of whether inter-peptide oligomerization differences reflected fundamental differences in peptide assembly and not simply the effects of differing peptide concentrations, a series of cross-linking experiments were performed using Aβ40 and Aβ42 at varying concentrations. At all concentrations, from 1–300 μm, the oligomer size distributions of Aβ40 were distinct from those of Aβ42 (data not shown). This confirmed that the assembly differences we observed in the experiments reported here, and in prior work (26Bitan G. Lomakin A. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35176-35184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 27Bitan G. Kirkitadze M.D. Lomakin A. Vollers S.S. Benedek G.B. Teplow D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar), reflected fundamental differences between peptides and not concentration effects. In principle, radical formation may occur at any site along the polypeptide chain. However, the radical would form at, and further react preferentially with, amino acid side-chains that offer stabilization through aromatic or neighboring-group effects (e.g. Tyr, Phe, or Met (35Kotzyba-Hibert F. Kapfer I. Goeldner M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995; 34: 1296-1312Crossref Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The primary factors determining how Aβ is cross-linked are the proximity of a susceptible group to the radical and the lifetime of the radical itself. If the lifetime of the radical is long enough to allow intermolecular cross-linking as opposed to quenching by solvent, then the actual chemical nature of the radical is relatively unimportant. Cross-linked Aβ samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining, as described previously (26Bitan G. Lomakin A. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35176-35184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The nominal total amount of peptide in each lane of the gels was identical. Gels were dried, scanned, and the intensities of the resulting monomer and oligomer bands quantified by densitometry using the program One-Dscan (Scanalytics, Fairfax, VA). The densitometric data for each of the figures is available as supporting online material. The relative amount of each band, as a percentage of all bands, was determined by calculating the quotient of its intensity and the sum of all band intensities and then multiplying by 100. Effects of Structural Modifications at the C Terminus of Aβ42 on Oligomerization—Our previous studies (26Bitan G. Lomakin A. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35176-35184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 27Bitan G. Kirkitadze M.D. Lomakin A. Vollers S.S. Benedek G.B. Teplow D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar) revealed that LMW Aβ40 and Aβ42 had distinct oligomer size distributions. LMW Aβ40 existed as an equilibrium mixture of monomer, dimer, trimer, and tetramer (26Bitan G. Lomakin A. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35176-35184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In contrast, LMW Aβ42 comprised three groups of oligomers: 1) monomer through trimer, displaying decreasing intensity with increasing oligomer order; 2) a Gaussian-like distribution between tetramer and octamer, with a maximum at pentamer and hexamer; and 3) oligomers of M r ∼30–60 kDa, among which two intensity maxima, at dodecamer and octadecamer, were observed (27Bitan G. Kirkitadze M.D. Lomakin A. Vollers S.S. Benedek G.B. Teplow D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). These higher order oligomers appeared to form through self-association of pentamer/hexamer units (paranuclei). The data demonstrated that Ile41 was essential for formation of paranuclei, whereas Ala42 was required for rapid self-association of paranuclei into larger oligomers (27Bitan G. Kirkitadze M.D. Lomakin A. Vollers S.S. Benedek G.B. Teplow D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). To better understand how amino acid side-chain structure in the C-terminal dipeptide of Aβ42 controls oligomerization, seven peptide alloforms (C terminus, Table I) were prepared and their oligomer size distributions were determined by PICUP/SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Substitution of Ile41 by Gly, eliminating both the side-chain and the stereocenter of the Cα group, yielded a distribution that was qualitatively similar to that of Aβ40 (26Bitan G. Lomakin A. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35176-35184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) (cf. Fig. 1, lane 2 and Fig. 2A , lane 1). Monomer through trimer formed in similar amounts, and a rapid decrease in oligomer abundance was observed above trimer, whereas Aβ40 showed abundant tetramer, above which abundances decreased. [Gly41]Aβ42 thus existed in a dynamic equilibrium involving monomer, dimer, and trimer, but not tetramer (the mathematical foundation for this analysis has been published (26Bitan G. Lomakin A. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35176-35184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar)). When Ile41 was substituted by Ala, dimer and trimer were the predominant cross-linking products, a characteristic of Aβ40 distributions. However, in contrast to wild type (WT) Aβ40 distributions, tetramer abundance was low, whereas pentamer abundance was relatively high. This polytonic distribution is characteristic of Aβ42. The oligomer size distribution of [Ala41]Aβ42 thus appeared to be a composite of Aβ40- and Aβ42-like distributions. The majority of the peptide existed as an equilibrium mixture of monomer, dimer, and trimer, as in the case of [Gly41]Aβ42, but the methyl side-chain of Ala41 facilitated limited paranucleus formation. Substitution of Ile41 by Val or Leu led to formation of abundant paranuclei. However, in the oligomer size distribution of [Val41]Aβ42, no oligomers at ∼30–60 kDa were detected. In the distribution of [Leu41]Aβ42 the amount of these high molecular weight oligomers was substantially reduced relative to that of WT Aβ42. Consistent with the low amounts of high molecular weight oligomers, a higher abundance of dimer and trimer were observed for [Val41]Aβ42 and [Leu41]Aβ42 (∼18% dimer and ∼14% trimer for each) relative to WT Aβ42 (∼14% dimer and ∼10% trimer), demonstrating that these oligomers were in equilibrium with tetramer through octamer. Thus, the side-chain in position 41 is involved in the formation and self-association of Aβ42 paranuclei. Examination of the distributions produced by Gly41-, Ala41-, and Val41-substituted Aβ42 reveals a correlation between paranucleus formation and side-chain size. [Val41]Aβ42 and [Leu41]Aβ42, containing iso-propyl and iso-butyl side-chains, respectively, do not facilitate self-association of paranuclei, whereas the sec-butyl side-chain of Ile does. Substitution of Ala42 by Gly or Val had little effect on formation of paranuclei (Fig. 1). However, no high molecular mass oligomers (∼30–60 kDa) were observed for [Gly42]Aβ42, demonstrating a role for the methyl side-chain of Ala42 in the self-association of paranuclei. When the C-terminal carboxyl group was replaced by a carboxamide, a large increase in the abundance of high molecular weight oligomers was seen (Fig. 1). Thus, hydrophobic interactions involving the side-chains in residues 41 and 42 appear to be a driving force in the association of Aβ42 paranuclei into higher oligomers, whereas the C-terminal carboxylate anion moderates this assembly effect.

https://openalex.org/W2012615147,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) is a member of the TNF superfamily that has been shown to induce angiogenesis, apoptosis in tumor cells, and NF-κB activation through binding to its receptor, fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14. We have identified TWEAK as an inducer of constitutive NF-κB activation by expression cloning, and we report here sequential regulation by TWEAK of two separate signaling cascades for NF-κB activation, the NF-κB essential modulator-dependent and -independent signaling pathways. Upon TWEAK stimulation, IκBα is rapidly phosphorylated, generating NF-κB DNA-binding complexes containing p50 and RelA in a manner dependent on the canonical IκB kinase complex. Unlike TNF-α, TWEAK stimulation results in prolonged NF-κB activation with a transition of the DNA-binding NF-κB components from RelA- to RelB-containing complexes by 8 h, and the latter remained active in binding at least until 24 h post-stimulation. This long lasting activation is accompanied by the proteasome-mediated processing of NF-κB2/p100, which does not depend on the NF-κB essential modulator but requires IκB kinase 1 and functional NF-κB-inducing kinase activity. Finally, we show that fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 with a mutation at its TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-binding site cannot activate NF-κB and that TWEAK fails to induce the p100 processing and IκBα phosphorylation in cells deficient for TRAF2 and TRAF5. Our results thus identify TWEAK as a novel physiological regulator of the non-canonical pathway for NF-κB activation."
https://openalex.org/W2050271934,"The high 3He/4He ratio of volcanic rocks thought to be derived from mantle plumes is taken as evidence for the existence of a mantle reservoir that has remained largely undegassed since the Earth's accretion1,2,3. The helium isotope composition of this reservoir places constraints on the origin of volatiles within the Earth and on the evolution and structure of the Earth's mantle. Here we show that olivine phenocrysts in picritic basalts presumably derived from the proto-Iceland plume at Baffin Island, Canada, have the highest magmatic 3He/4He ratios yet recorded. A strong correlation between 3He/4He and 87Sr/86Sr, 143Nd/144Nd and trace element ratios demonstrate that the 3He-rich end-member is present in basalts that are derived from large-volume melts of depleted upper-mantle rocks. This reservoir is consistent with the recharging of depleted upper-mantle rocks by small volumes of primordial volatile-rich lower-mantle material at a thermal boundary layer between convectively isolated reservoirs. The highest 3He/4He basalts from Hawaii and Iceland plot on the observed mixing trend. This indicates that a 3He-recharged depleted mantle (HRDM) reservoir may be the principal source of high 3He/4He in mantle plumes, and may explain why the helium concentration of the ‘plume’ component in ocean island basalts is lower than that predicted for a two-layer, steady-state model of mantle structure."

Moonlight, like sunlight1, scatters when it strikes tiny particles in the atmosphere, giving rise to celestial polarization patterns2. Here we show that an African dung beetle, Scarabaeus zambesianus, uses the polarization of a moonlit sky to orientate itself so that it can move along a straight line. Many creatures use the Sun's light-polarization pattern to orientate themselves3,4, but S. zambesianus is the first animal known to use the million-times dimmer polarization of moonlight for this purpose."

Connective tissues are characterized by an abundant extracellular matrix in which a wide variety of different proteins and proteoglycans assemble into multimolecular complexes, often in the form of networks. The fibrillar collagens are major components (for review, see Ref. 1Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev.

Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), where they join end to end into microfibrils. These subsequently form characteristic thin beaded filaments that are found in a variety of tissues (3Furthmayr H. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. Odermatt E. Engel J. Biochem.

These major constituents provide the basic organization of the extracellular matrix, while other molecules modulate its assembly and structure. The matrilins are a family of oligomeric matrix proteins containing common structural motifs such as vWFA-like domains, epidermal growth factor-like EGF modules and coiled-coil regions (reviewed in Ref. 18Deak F.

All matrilins form homo-oligomers through assembly of coiled-coil structures from a common C-terminal stretch of heptad repeats. In addition, matrilin-1 and -3 form hetero-oligomers in bovine epiphyseal cartilage (21Klatt A.R. Nitsche D.P. Kobbe B. Mörgelin M. Paulsson M. Wagener R. J. Biol.

The LRR (leucine-rich repeat) protein family consists of 12 known extracellular members and the molecules appear to play major roles in modulating the functional properties of the collagen networks (17Heinegård D. Aspberg A. Franzén A. Lorenzo P. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss Inc, New York2002: 271-291Crossref Google Scholar, 30Iozzo R.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Nine of the members are characterized by a core protein with 10 to 11 leucine-rich repeats, surrounded by disulfide-linked loops. Most LRR proteins have an N-terminal extension with specific characteristics. These range from clustered tyrosine sulfate residues, long stretches of aspartate residues, clustered basic amino acids as well as substitution with oligosaccharides or glycosaminoglycan chains. In many cases binding to triple helical collagens has been demonstrated. Decorin, a proteoglycan member of this family, interacts with fibrillar collagens in vitro (31Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27307-27312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and interferes with collagen fibrillogenesis (32Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem.

It has also been shown to interact with collagen VI (34Bidanset D.J. Guidry C. Rosenberg L.C. Choi H.U. Timpl R. Höök M. J. Biol.

Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18947-18952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), another LRR-proteoglycan closely related to decorin. Biglycan is substituted with two glycosaminoglycan chains, often dermatan sulfate, in its N-terminal domain, while decorin carries a single chain (36Fisher L.W. Termine J.D. Young M.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 8653-8661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biglycan does not appear to be involved in the assembly of the fibrillar collagens. However, it was recently shown to bind to the vicinity of the collagen VI N-terminal by its core protein in a glycosaminoglycan-independent manner (35Wiberg C. Hedbom E. Khairullina A. Lamandé S.R.

Furthermore biglycan was demonstrated to induce and catalyze the formation of hexagonal-type collagen VI networks in vitro, a function that depends on its glycosaminoglycan substitution (41Wiberg C. Heinegård D. Wenglén C. Timpl R. Mörgelin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49120-49126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The tissue-specific structures and functions of the extracellular matrix involve complex, and as yet poorly understood, interactions between individual extracellular proteins. The formation of these specific architectural elements is critical for normal tissue development and function. The present study represents a detailed examination of networks of molecules isolated under mild conditions from the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma. We use molecular electron microscopy in combination with immunogold techniques to show that small LRR-proteoglycans together with matrilins form a linkage between collagen VI microfibrils and other macromolecular components in the cartilage extracellular matrix. Preparation of Chondrons—Chondrons were isolated from rat chondrosarcoma tissue by a modification of a previously published method (42Poole C.A. Flint M.H. Beaumont B.W. J. Orthop. Res. 1988; 6: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In short, freshly isolated tumor tissue was dispersed in Nutrient Mixture F-12 (HAM's F 12) (Invitrogen) by passing it through a nylon filter (pore size 50 μm2). The dispersed particles were washed with HAM's F12 on a 25 μm2 pore sized nylon filter. Retained material was resuspended in HAM's F12 and prepared for scanning electron microscopy. Scanning Electron Microscopy—For scanning electron microscopy (SEM), 50 μl of the final suspension was gently drawn onto a wet Millipore filter, pore size 0.22 μm. The whole filter was fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, 0.1 m sucrose, pH 7.4, for two hours at 4 °C. Alternatively, filters were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, for1hat 4 °C, pre-incubated with 0.5% BSA in the same buffer for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently incubated with an antiserum raised against bovine collagen VI for1hat room temperature, washed with 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, and incubated with protein A-gold as described (43Roth J. Bendayan M. Orci L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1978; 26: 1074-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Fixed filter samples were dehydrated for 10 min at each step of an ascending ethanol series and critical point dried in a Balzers critical point dryer. They were mounted on aluminum stubs, gold/palladium coated and examined in a Jeol J-330 scanning electron microscope. Alternatively, immunolabeled filters were coated with a 20 nm carbon layer under rotation prior to SEM. Gold label was detected by recording back scattered electron images at an acceleration voltage of 30 kV and a working distance of 10 mm. Double Immunolabeling of Chondrosarcoma Cells—The Swarm rat chondrosarcoma cell line (44Mukhopadhyay K. Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Garofalo S. Kimura J.H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27711-27719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. J. Kimura (Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit). The immortalized cells were cultured in HAM's F12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 units/ml streptomycin, and 50 μg/ml l-ascorbic acid. For immunolabeling the cells were fixed for 20 min with 3.6% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked by incubation for 30 min with 1% (w/v) BSA in TBS. Immunolabeling was done by consecutive treatment of the slides for 1 h with a mixture of the two appropriate primary antibodies and a mixture of the two secondary antibodies. As secondary antibodies a Cy™3-conjugated affinity-purified donkey anti-chicken IgG (Jackson Immuno) was used in combination with either a Cy™2-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immuno) or a Cy™2-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immuno). All antibodies were diluted in 1% (w/v) BSA in TBS. Purification of Protein Complexes from the Swarm Rat Chondrosarcoma—Tissue was washed with five volumes of ice cold 0.05 m Tris-HCl, 0.15 m sodium chloride pH 7.4 (TBS) containing, 5 mm calcium chloride and extracted twice for 1 h and once overnight at +4 °C in TBS containing 10 mm EDTA (45Mörgelin M. Engel J. Heinegård D. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14275-14284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All buffers contained protease inhibitors (46Oegema T.R. Hascall V.C. Dziewiatkowski D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6151-6159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tissue residues were removed by centrifugation at 10000 × g for 20 min and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100 000 × g for 8 h at +4 °C (Beckman 70.2 Ti). The bottom fraction, enriched in high molecular weight components, was dissolved in TBS at +4 °C for 48 h. Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 10 000 × g for 30 min. Protein complexes in the supernatant were purified further by rate zonal centrifugation in a 12 ml glycerol gradient (10–50%) for3hat200 000 × g in a Beckman SW41 Ti rotor. The tube content was divided into twelve equal fractions and their molecular constituents were analyzed by electron microscopy after negative staining. Preparation of Gold-labeled Proteins and Antibodies—Colloidal gold particles of 4 nm ± 15% were prepared by reduction of HAuCl4 by thiocyanate (47Baschong W. Lucocq J.M. Roth J Histochemistry. 1985; 83: 409-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and conjugated after titration to polyclonal antibodies (against human proN(II)-peptide and murine matrilin-2), polyclonal, affinity-purified antibodies (against bovine biglycan, decorin, chondroadherin, matrilin-1, and against murine matrilin-3 and matrilin-4) and monoclonal antibodies (against human aggrecan). In some experiments, colloidal gold particles with a larger (12 ± 20%) diameter were prepared by reduction of HAuCl4 using sodium citrate (48Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) and conjugated after titration to the above-described antibodies against matrilin-1. The middle fraction from the rate zonal centrifugation was diluted into TBS and incubated with different dilutions of gold-labeled antibodies. As a control, samples were incubated with pre-immune serum under the same conditions. Samples were adsorbed to a 400-mesh carbon coated copper grid, which was rendered hydrophilic by glow-discharge at low pressure in air. The grid was immediately blotted, washed with two drops of water, and stained with 0.75% uranyl formate for 15 s. Samples were observed in a Jeol 1200 EX transmission electron microscope operated at 60 kV accelerating voltage and ×75,000 magnification. Evaluation of the data from electron micrographs was done as described previously (49Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 3-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Antibody specificity was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Samples of TBS/EDTA extracts from chondrosarcoma tissue were digested with chondroitinase ABC prior to electrophoresis by incubation with 50 microunits/μl chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku). Samples were allowed to react at 37 °C for 1–2 h, subjected to ethanol precipitation and resolved in sample buffer with 5% β-mercaptoethanol. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Laemmli (50Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). For immunoblots, the proteins were electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with a dilution of the appropriate antibody. Bound antibodies were detected by using peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-mouse IgG, 3-aminophtalhydrazide (1.25 mm), p-coumaric acid (225 μm), and 0.1% H2O2. Interactions Studied by Surface Plasmon Resonance in the BIAcore™2000 System—Matrilin-1, purified from native extracts of bovine fetal cartilage (51Hauser N. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25747-25753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (200 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 3.2) was covalently immobilized on the BIAcore sensorchip CM-5 (carboxylated dextran matrix) with a 1:1 mixture of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the description of the manufacturer. Remaining active groups on the matrix were blocked with 1 m ethanolamine-HCl (BDH Chemicals) at pH 8.5. The running buffer was 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20 (BIAcore). Studies of interactions were performed in TBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% surfactant P20. Native recombinant biglycan, decorin, and chondroadherin, produced in the human 293 cell line (20–200 nm) were injected over immobilized matrilin-1 at flow rates of 40–50 μl/min. Collagen VI Microfibrils—Collagen VI microfibrils without bound protein complexes were prepared from bovine cornea (52Spissinger T. Engel J. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In short, bovine corneas were cut into pieces and homogenized in Tris/saline buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm calcium chloride and protease inhibitors. The homogenate was digested with collagenase type 1 (Worthington). Not dissolved material was pelleted by centrifugation at 48 000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was applied in 500-μl aliquots onto a 25 ml Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated and eluted with homogenization buffer at 0.2 ml/min. Fractions of 0.5 ml from the void volume containing collagen VI microfibrils were collected and pooled. Recombinant LRR-Proteoglycans/Proteins—Preparation of native recombinant LRR-proteoglycans/proteins in human kidney cells, human HeLa cells, and Chinese hamster ovary cells has been previously described (41Wiberg C. Heinegård D. Wenglén C. Timpl R. Mörgelin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49120-49126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of Complexes in Vitro—Colloidal gold particles were prepared through reduction with thiocyanate (smaller size) or citrate (larger size) as described above. Colloidal gold particles of smaller and larger size were titrated and conjugated to biglycan, decorin, chondroadherin, and matrilin-1, respectively. Gold-labeled proteins were incubated with purified collagen VI microfibrils from cornea, incubated for 15 min in +4 °C and then subjected to negative staining and electron microscopy as described above. Structural Analysis of the Pericellular Matrix of Chondrons and Cultured Chondrocytes—Chondrons, representing single or clustered chondrocytes surrounded by territorial matrix, were purified in an intact form from Swarm rat chondrosarcoma tissue using a modification of a method previously reported for mature cartilage (42Poole C.A. Flint M.H. Beaumont B.W. J. Orthop. Res. 1988; 6: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The high water content and the softness of the tissue allowed isolation of the chondrons by passing tissue samples through nylon filters. Chondrons isolated by this method exhibited the same overall appearance as those isolated from cartilage by Poole et al. (42Poole C.A. Flint M.H. Beaumont B.W. J. Orthop. Res. 1988; 6: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1a). SEM analysis showed that the chondron capsule contains different fibrillar networks where thin microfibrils contrast against thicker fibers (Fig. 1b). The thinner fibrils where identified as collagen VI by immunolabeling and SEM (Fig. 1c). Cultured Swarm rat chondrosarcoma cells deposit a pericellular matrix containing collagen VI microfibrils similar to those found in vivo (Fig. 1, d–f). Immunofluorescence microscopy of the chondrosarcoma cells showed co-localization of collagen VI microfibrils with both matrilin-1 and matrilin-3 (Fig. 2). Since the two matrilins showed extensive co-localization with each other and may well occur in hybrid molecules and hybrid filaments (21Klatt A.R. Nitsche D.P. Kobbe B. Mörgelin M. Paulsson M. Wagener R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3999-4006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 26Wu J.J. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17433-17438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), only matrilin-3 was studied in further double immunofluorescence experiments (Fig. 2). Biglycan and decorin showed localizations partially overlapping with matrilin-3 in pericellular filaments. In addition, matrilin-3 was partially co-distributed with both aggrecan and collagen II.Fig. 2Double immunofluorescence microscopy of chondrosarcoma cells. Cultured cells were double immunostained with specific antibodies against a set of cartilage extracellular matrix components, i.e. collagens II and VI, biglycan, decorin, aggrecan, and matrilins, as indicated in the figure. In all cases co-localization was seen in filamentous structures in the pericellular matrix. The bar represents 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assure that all antibodies used were truly specific, these were tested in immunoblots against extracts of chondrosarcoma proteins and proteoglycans that had been resolved by SDS-PAGE performed under reducing conditions. All antibodies reacted specifically with bands with a mobility characteristic for the corresponding antigen (not shown). Analysis of Isolated Collagen VI Microfibrils by Electron Microscopy—Collagen VI microfibrils were obtained in an intact form by extraction of rat chondrosarcoma tissue with EDTA-containing physiological saline, followed by a differential centrifugation procedure. The fibrils were examined by electron microscopy after negative staining. Collagen VI was visualized as beaded filaments where adjacent tetramers were linked together in the characteristical end-to-end manner (Fig. 3, a and i). These filaments formed complexes with a number of molecules giving their N termini a bulky appearance (Fig. 3a, arrow) compared with the collagen VI microfilaments without bound ligands (Fig. 3h, arrow). The latter filaments were prepared by collagenase digestion of bovine cornea (52Spissinger T. Engel J. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Two different kinds of particles were frequently observed at the N termini of collagen VI derived from the chondrosarcoma (Fig. 3a, insets). The smaller of these consisted of two globular domains connected by a smaller, central domain. The larger was in most cases composed of three globular domains of equal size (Fig. 3a, insets), but also structures made up of four subunits were frequently seen. The molecular identity of the particles was determined using gold-labeled, affinity-purified antibodies. Using this approach, biglycan (Fig. 3b), and decorin (Fig. 3c) were found located to the N-terminal globular domains of collagen VI and represented the smaller kind of particle. The larger molecules, typically bound to the small LRR-proteoglycans, and more distant from the collagen VI filaments, were identified as matrilin-1 (Fig. 3d), matrilin-3 (Fig. 3e), and matrilin-4 (Fig. 3f). Matrilin-2 was never detected as a component of the collagen VI microfibril complexes (not shown). We also identified chondroadherin bound both to the N-and C-terminal globular domains of collagen VI, but we did not observe other proteins interacting with chondroadherin in these samples (Fig. 3g). Reconstitution of Collagen VI Complexes in Vitro—The observations made on native, chondrosarcoma-derived collagen VI complexes were verified in recombination experiments employing highly purified proteins and recombinant native proteoglycans (Fig. 4). Corneal collagen VI microfibrils, free of associated proteins, were mixed with LRR-proteoglycans/proteins in vitro. Recombinant native biglycan, decorin, and chondroadherin were labeled with colloidal gold prior to incubation. Biglycan and decorin bound exclusively to the N-terminal parts of collagen VI, while chondroadherin bound both to the N-terminal and C-terminal portions (Fig. 4, a–c). In addition, matrilin-1 labeled with larger gold particles was found to bind to the collagen VI via biglycan (Fig. 4d) or decorin (Fig. 4e), labeled with smaller colloidal gold, when these molecules were mixed prior to incubation with the corneal collagen VI microfibrils. Analysis of the Interactions between Matrilin-1 and LRR-proteoglycans—The results obtained by electron microscopy indicated that matrilin-1 is able to bind the LRR-proteoglycans biglycan and decorin. This was further supported in binding experiments using purified proteins and proteoglycans and detecting bound proteins by surface plasmon resonance in the BIAcore™2000 system. Matrilin-1 was immobilized to the CM-5 chip and biglycan, decorin or chondroadherin added in the fluid phase (Fig. 5). For biglycan and decorin a concentration-dependent binding to matrilin-1 was observed, while chondroadherin did not interact. The lack of binding of chondroadherin to matrilin-1 is in agreement with the results from electron microscopy, where this LRR-protein was never seen associated with matrilins (Fig. 3g). The binding of native biglycan and decorin to matrilin-1, but not of the structurally releated chondroadherin, demonstrates the specificity of the assay. Identification of Extracellular Matrix Components Interacting with Collagen VI Microfibrils via the LRR-proteoglycan/matrilin Complex—In electron microscopy, the LRR-proteoglycan/matrilin complexes were frequently seen to mediate contacts between the collagen VI filaments and other matrix macromolecules. These peripherally attached molecules were identified as procollagen II (Fig. 6a) and aggrecan (Fig. 6d) by incubation with gold-labeled affinity-purified antibodies prior to negative staining and electron microscopy. Also assemblies in the form of collagen II fibers were shown to bind to collagen VI via the matrilin-biglycan/decorin linkage (Fig 6c). Binding to the various constituents occurred via matrilin-1, which was identified with a gold-labeled antibody (Fig. 6, b, c, and e). Supramolecular assembly of collagen VI molecules into fibrillar networks has been evaluated in detail previously (3Furthmayr H. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. Odermatt E. Engel J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 4Odermatt E. Risteli J. van Delden V. Timpl R. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 7Engvall E. Hessle H. Klier G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), but how these networks are associated with other interstitial network components at the molecular level is still elusive. Although collagen VI has been shown to interact with fibrillar collagens in vitro (6Bonaldo P. Russo V. Bucciotti F. Doliana R. Colombatti A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 34Bidanset D.J. Guidry C. Rosenberg L.C. Choi H.U. Timpl R. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5250-5256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) it has been suggested that other molecules may be involved in the in vivo interaction (53Keene D.R. Ridgway C.C. Iozzo R.V. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the present study we provide evidence for molecular mechanisms by which collagen VI microfibrils can interact with other interstitial extracellular matrix networks. We took advantage of the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma, a comparatively soft cartilaginous tissue, which allows purification of cartilage extracellular matrix components under native conditions. Electron microscopy in combination with negative staining and colloidal gold technology was used to visualize the extracellular matrix structures at high resolution and to identify individual components both in native extracts and reconstituted multimolecular assemblies. For the recombination experiments bovine proteins were used. Identical results were obtained when bovine matrilin-1, CHAD, biglycan, and decorin were used in combination with rat collagen VI (not shown). Despite the species difference the results did in all aspects agree with and confirm the observations made in the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma system. Compared with “naked” beaded microfibrils extracted by limited collagenase digestion (52Spissinger T. Engel J. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) the collagen VI microfibrils, extracted under conditions that preserve native structures, exhibited a variety of globular multidomain proteins surrounding the globular beads of the tetramer junctional complex. Gold-labeled antibodies confirmed that the smaller particles, binding close to the microfibril, were different LRR proteins or protoglycans, whereas the larger particles found more distant from the microfibril were identified as different matrilins. Biglycan and decorin were found in the vicinity of the N terminus, whereas chondroadherin bound close to both the N and C termini. In vitro reconstituted complexes consisting of collagenase-digested microfibrils with added gold-labeled biglycan, decorin, or chondroadherin, looked similar. This is in accordance with previous results showing in vitro binding of biglycan and decorin close to the N-terminal region of collagen VI tetramers (35Wiberg C. Hedbom E. Khairullina A. Lamandé S.R. Oldberg Å. Timpl R. Mörgelin M. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18947-18952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and chondroadherin to both N- and C-terminal globular moieties (41Wiberg C. Heinegård D. Wenglén C. Timpl R. Mörgelin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49120-49126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Native glycosylated biglycan and decorin, but not chondroadherin, interacted with matrilins in both native and reconstituted microfillar assemblies. The interactions were not dependent on glycosaminoglycan chains as neither pretreatment of native biglycan and decorin with chondroitinase ABC, nor the presence of purified chondroitin or dermatan sulfate chains inhibited the assembly (results not shown). Complexes between matrilin-1 and biglycan/decorin were examined in further detail as models for this interaction, where different complexes between LRR-proteoglycans and matrilins were found bound to native collagen VI microfibrils. The finding, that collagen VI is connected to the major constituents of extracellular matrix through the LRR-proteoglycans in complex with the matrilins, is in accordance with the fact that matrilin-1 interacts with both aggrecan and collagen II (27Winterbottom N. Tondravi M.M. Harrington T.L. Klier F.G. Vertel B.M. Goetinck P.F. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 193: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 28Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32247-32252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). By use of electron microscopy we visualized the individual molecules and their interrelations in native complexes extracted from tissue and demonstrate that the major structural entities, collagen II and aggrecan are joined to collagen VI via a complex of matrilins and LRR-proteoglycans. This observation offers new insights into the complex organization of the cartilage matrix and allows us to propose a model of the in vivo organization of the studied molecules (Fig. 7). We conclude that an important role of matrilin-1, biglycan and decorin is to serve as adapter proteins connecting macromolecular networks in the cartilage extracellular matrix. The members of the matrilin family are differentially expressed among and within cartilages. For example, the superficial zone of articular cartilage lacks matrilin-1 and -3 while matrilin-4 is present (54Klatt A.R. Paulsson M. Wagener R. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is likely that matrilin-4 takes over the adapter function in this tissue, but it may be that the levels of matrilin expression influence the kind of macromolecular assemblies formed in a particular tissue compartment. Other members of the matrilin and LRR-proteoglycan families may play similar roles in the tissues where they are expressed. Our study visualizes collagen VI microfibrillar networks, which are connected to collagen II fibrils by biglycan/matrilin-1 complexes as linkers. These linkers also connect a number of procollagen molecules to the collagen VI scaffold. These may represent immobilized nucleation centers for collagen II fibril assembly. It is thus possible that a functional role of such collagen VI microfibril supramolecular assemblies is to act as scaffolds for the formation of the structurally critical fibrillar collagen networks. A further role of the collagen VI network may be to present fibrillogenesis modulators such as LRR proteins in proximity to the growing fibrils. In this way the formation of the collagen VI microfibrillar network in the early stages of tissue formation, or in repair processes such as wound and fracture healing, may play an important instructional role in tissue development, architecture, and homeostasis.

Cell cycle-dependent Cdt1 degradation plays an essential role in DNA replication control, as overexpression of Cdt1 leads to re-replication. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of Cdt1 degradation in mammalian cells. We showed that the F-box protein Skp2 specifically interacted with human Cdt1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The SCFSkp2 complex ubiquitinated Cdt1 both in vivo and in vitro. Down-regulation of Skp2 or disruption of the interaction between Cdt1 and Skp2 resulted in a stabilization and accumulation of Cdt1.

After the onset of S phase, Cdc6 is phosphorylated and exported to the cytoplasm (20Saha P. Chen J. Thome K.C. Lawlis S.J. Hou Z.H. Hendricks M. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell.

In contrast to Cdc6, the protein level of Cdt1 fluctuates during the cell cycle (27Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44905-44911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). It accumulates in early G1 phase of the cell cycle when replication is licensed and disappears at the onset of S phase. The correlation of Cdt1 accumulation and assembly of pre-RCs in early G1 phase suggests that Cdt1 may play an important role in the control of replication licensing in mammalian cells. This idea is further supported by the observation that overexpression of Cdt1 promotes DNA re-replication in p53 deficient cells (28Vaziri C. Saxena S. Jeon Y. Lee C. Murata K. Machida Y. Wagle N. Hwang D.S. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 997-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar).It has been shown that in mammalian cells, while Cdt1 protein level varies during the cell cycle, the mRNA level of Cdt1 remains relatively constant at different cell cycle stages (27Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44905-44911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In the presence of proteasome inhibitors, Cdt1 accumulates in S phase when it is normally absent. This suggests that proteasome-dependent degradation may regulate the Cdt1 level during the cell cycle in mammalian cells. However, the detailed mechanisms of Cdt1 degradation remain unknown.The ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway plays an important role for protein degradation (29Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). The conjugation of polyubiquitin chains to substrates requires enzymes, E1 (a ubiquitin-activating enzyme), E2 (a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme) and E3 (a ubiqutin protein ligase). E3 ubiquitin protein ligases mediate critical steps of substrate recognition. SCF (Skp1-Cul1/Cdc53-F-box protein) complexes represent a well conserved class of E3, which are required for the G1-S phase transition (30Willems A.R. Lanker S. Patton E.E. Craig K.L. Nason T.F.

We found that human Cdt1 is degraded through the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway. The F-box protein Skp2 specifically recognizes and associates with Cdt1, and the SCFSkp2 complex mediates Cdt1 ubiquitination and degradation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—Full-length human Cdt1 and various Cdt1 deletion mutants were subcloned into pCDNA3β, which carries a sequence encoding three copies of the Myc tag added at the N terminus of the inserts (41Chen J. Silver D.P. Walpita D. Cantor S.B. Gazdar A.F. Tomlinson G. Couch F.J. Weber B.L. Ashley T. Livingston D.M. Scully R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 317-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged Cdt1Δ105 coding sequence was excised out from pCDNA3β by NruI and XhoI digestion and inserted into the SnaBI and SalI sites of the retroviral vector pBABE-puro (42Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P.

Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3941) Google Scholar). The target sequence GAGGTGGTATCGCCTAGCG started at nucleotide 411 in the Skp2 open reading frame.Cell Culture and Synchronization—All cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Synchronization of cells in early S phase was achieved by incubating cells with 2 mm thymidine for 24 h.Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and Antibodies—Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis were performed as described previously (45Wu X. Ranganathan V. Weisman D.S. Heine W.F. Ciccone D.N. O'Neill T.B. Crick K.E. Pierce K.A. Lane W.S. Rathbun G. Livingston D.M. Weaver D.T. Nature. 2000; 405: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Protein phosphatase treatment was conducted by incubating cell lysates with 500 units of λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 30 °C.Polyclonal antibody against human Cdt1 (PAS701) was raised against glutathione S-transferase fused C-terminal residues 267–546 of Cdt1. Other antibodies were purchased from different companies: Skp2 (H-435, Santa Cruz), Skp2 (8D9, Zymed Laboratories Inc.), Cul1 (H-213, Santa Cruz), actin (Sigma), Myc tag (9B11, Cell Signaling), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (6C5, Research Diagnostics, Inc.), HA tag (HA.11, Babco).Transfection and Retroviral Infection—293T cells were transiently transfected by a calcium phosphate procedure. 28 μg of indicated plasmids and 2 μg of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-GFP plasmid were used for each transfection. Transfection efficiency was achieved more than 70% as indicated by GFP expression.Recombinant retroviruses were generated as described and infected cells were selected by drug treatment (46Sun P. Dong P. Dai K. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Science. 1998; 282: 2270-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar).In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—293T cells were transiently transfected with HA-Ub with or without FLAG-Skp2. 40 h later, cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate and proteinase inhibitors). Affinity-purified Cdt1 polyclonal antibody was used to immunoprecipitate endogenous Cdt1. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then blotted either with anti-Cdt1 or anti-HA antibodies.In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—Recombinant SCFSkp2 (FLAG-Skp2, HA-Cul1, Myc-Roc, and Skp1) complex was purified from 293T cells 40 h after transfection (37Strohmaier H. Spruck C.H. Kaiser P. Won K.A. Sangfelt O. Reed S.I. Nature. 2001; 413: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The complex was eluted by FLAG peptide in the ubiquitination buffer, and in vitro ubiquitination assay was performed as described previously (40Tedesco D. Lukas J. Reed S.I. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2946-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar).RESULTSEffect of Proteasome Inhibition on Cdt1 Stability and Phosphorylation—Proteasomal function is required for Cdt1 proteolysis in mammalian cells, as Cdt1 is accumulated after treatment with proteasome inhibitors (27Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44905-44911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To measure the stability of Cdt1 before and after the inhibition of proteasome, the proteasome-specific inhibitor MG132 was preincubated with U2OS cells, followed by cycloheximide (CHX) treatment. MG132 treatment led to a dramatic stabilization of Cdt1 (Fig. 1A). At the same time, a slower migrating Cdt1 band, which could be completely abolished by λ-phosphatase treatment, was accumulated (Fig. 1A). This suggested that Cdt1 was degraded by proteasome function and raised the possibility that phosphorylation of Cdt1 might be important for the proteasome mediated Cdt1 degradation.Cdt1 Is Ubiquitinated in Vivo—Since Cdt1 is stabilized by the proteasome inhibitor, we further investigated whether Cdt1 is modified by ubiquitination. Cdt1 was immunoprecipitated from 293T cells with or without MG132 treatment. A ladder of Cdt1 bands, a characteristic of ubiquitination modification, accumulated after MG132 incubation (Fig. 1B). To confirm that the slower migrating Cdt1 bands were indeed derived from the ubiquitin-conjugated Cdt1 species, 293T cells were transiently transfected with HA-Ub (HA-tagged ubiquitin). Endogenous Cdt1 was immunoprecipitated in modified RIPA buffer, and subsequent Western blot analysis using antibody against HA revealed that Cdt1 was modified by HA-Ub (Fig. 1C). Our data suggest that Cdt1 is ubiquitinated in vivo.SCFSkp2 Interacts Physically with Cdt1 in a Phosphorylation-dependent Manner—Cdt1 accumulates in G1 phase, and the protein level dramatically decreases at the G1/S transition. Since Skp2 plays an important role in the G1/S transition (30Willems A.R. Lanker S. Patton E.E. Craig K.L. Nason T.F. Mathias N. Kobayashi R. Wittenberg C. Tyers M. Cell. 1996; 86: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), we investigated whether SCFSkp2 serves as the E3 ligase that targets Cdt1 for degradation.We observed that Cdt1 associated with the SCFSkp2 complex in vivo. We transiently co-expressed Myc-Skp2 or Myc-Skp2 and HA-Cul1 with FLAG-Cdt1 in 293T cells. Immunoprecipitation revealed that FLAG-Cdt1 associated with Myc-Skp2 and Myc-Skp2/HA-Cul1 (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Cdt1 interacts with the SCFSkp2 complex. A, overexpressed Cdt1 interacts with Skp2 and Cul1. Myc-Skp2 and FLAG-Cdt1 or Myc-Skp2, FLAG-Cdt1, and HA-Cul1 were used to co-transfect 293T cells. Anti-FLAG (middle) and anti-Myc (right) immunoprecipitations (IP) were performed, and association was revealed by immunoblotting against Myc, FLAG, and HA. Transfection with Myc-Skp2, FLAG-Cdt1, or HA-Cul1 alone was used as negative controls. Expression of Myc-Skp2, FLAG-Cdt1, or HA-Cul1 was shown by Western blot against Myc, FLAG, and HA using cell lysates (left). B, endogenous Cdt1 and Skp2/Cul1 interact in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. 293T cells were lysed, and immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-Cdt1 antibody either conjugated (α-Cdt1, coupled, lane 1) or not (α-Cdt1, lane 2) to protein A-agarose beads. Rabbit anti-mouse antibody (RαM, lane 4) was used as a negative control. Immunoprecipitation without adding cell lysate was used to indicate a nonspecific band above Skp2 (compare lanes 2 and 4 and lanes 5 and 6). Association of Cdt1 with Skp2 and Cul1 was revealed by immunoblotting against Skp2 and Cul1. Phosphorylation-dependent association was revealed by treating cell lysate with (lane 3) or without (lane 2) λ-phosphatase (pptase) before immunoprecipitation. Cdt1-p (phosphorylated Cdt1). C, the N-terminal region of Cdt1 is required for Skp2 binding. 293T cells were transfected with Myc-tagged wild-type Cdt1 (Wt) and with a series of Myc-tagged N- or C-terminal deletion mutants. The number of amino acids that were deleted from either N or C terminus was indicated. The association of Cdt1 wild type or Cdt1 mutants with Skp2 was revealed by anti-Myc immunoprecipitation (IP), followed by anti-Skp2 immunoblotting. The expression of each recombinant DNA sequence was revealed by anti-Myc immunoblot using transfected cell lysate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further confirm the in vivo association, we immunoprecipitated endogenous Cdt1 by affinity-purified polyclonal Cdt1 antibody. Western blot analysis of Skp2 and Cul1 indicated that endogenous Skp2 and Cul1 co-immunoprecipitated with Cdt1 (Fig. 2B , lane 2). Rabbit anti-mouse antibody (RαM) was used as a negative control (lane 4). Immunoprecipitation performed in the absence of cell lysates showed that the band located above Skp2 was nonspecific, possibly derived from immunoglobulin (Ig) (lanes 5 and 6). Indeed, coupling Cdt1 antibody to protein A beads abolished the nonspecific band (lane 1). Since it was shown that Skp2 bound to phosphorylated target proteins (40Tedesco D. Lukas J. Reed S.I. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2946-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 47Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar), we tested whether the interaction of Cdt1 and Skp2 was phosphorylation-dependent by immunoprecipitation of Cdt1 after incubating cell lysate with λ phosphatase. As shown in Fig. 2B (lane 3), phosphatase treatment dramatically decreased the association of Cdt1 with Skp2/Cul1.To search for regions in Cdt1 that are important for Skp2 binding, a series of Cdt1 deletion mutants, tagged with Myc, were constructed and expressed in 293T cells. Immunoprecipitation using antibody against Myc showed that the N-terminal deletions, as small as 52 amino acids, totally abolished the association of Cdt1 with Skp2, whereas C-terminal deletion mutants were capable of binding to Skp2. This suggests that the first 52 amino acids at the N terminus of Cdt1 are required for Skp2 association.Overexpression of Skp2 Stimulates Cdt1 Ubiquitination in Vivo—The association of Skp2 with Cdt1 prompted us to investigate the role of Skp2 in Cdt1 ubiquitination. 293T cells were transfected with HA-Ub, Myc-Skp2 alone, or co-transfected with HA-Ub and Myc-Skp2. Endogenous Cdt1 was immunoprecipitated in modified RIPA buffer, and ubiquitination of Cdt1 by HA-Ub was revealed by anti-HA Western blot analysis. Overexpression of Skp2 stimulated ubiquitination of Cdt1 in vivo (Fig. 3A). This suggests that Skp2 is a rate-limiting factor for Cdt1 ubiquitination.Fig. 3Skp2 promotes Cdt1 ubiquitination both in vivo and in vitro. A, expression of Skp2 enhances Cdt1 ubiquitination in vivo. 293T cells were transfected with HA-Ub, FLAG-Skp2 alone, or co-transfected with HA-Ub and FLAG-Skp2. Endogenous Cdt1 was immunoprecipitated from transfected cells in modified RIPA buffer. Western blot was performed using anti-HA antibody (top panel) and anti-Cdt1 (bottom panel). B, in vitro ubiquitination of Cdt1 by SCFSkp2. 293T cells were transfected with Myc-Cdt1 and lysed in RIPA buffer. The anti-Myc immunoprecipitates were incubated with or without soluble immuno-purified SCFSkp2 plus Cks1 supplied with purified E1 and E2. Polyubiquitination was assayed by Western blot analysis using antibody against Cdt1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cdt1 Is Ubiquitinated by SCFSkp2 in Vitro—In vitro assays were performed to test the involvement of SCFSkp2 in Cdt1 ubiquitination. 293T cells were co-transfected with the cDNAs encoding the components of the SCFSkp2 complex (FLAG-Skp2, HA-Cul1, Myc-Roc1, and Skp1). The complex was purified by anti-FLAG immunoaffinity purification and eluted by FLAG peptide as described previously (37Strohmaier H. Spruck C.H. Kaiser P. Won K.A. Sangfelt O. Reed S.I. Nature. 2001; 413: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged Cdt1, purified in RIPA buffer from transfected 293T cells, was used as substrate. In vitro ubiquitination reactions were performed with or without the addition of the SCFSkp2 complex (40Tedesco D. Lukas J. Reed S.I. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2946-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, the SCFSkp2 complex was able to ubiquitinate Cdt1 in vitro.The Effect of Skp2 on Cdt1 Stability—The results described above indicate that SCFSkp2 binds to Cdt1 and ubiquitinates Cdt1. To test the effect of the SCFSkp2 complex on Cdt1 stability, we overexpressed Skp2 or the SCFSkp2 complex (Skp2/Cul1/Roc/Skp1) in 293T cells. As illustrated in Fig. 4A, overexpression of Skp2 and the SCFSkp2 complex decreased the abundance of endogenous Cdt1. Treatment with MG132 stabilized Cdt1 in the cells overexpressing Skp2 or SCFSkp2 to a level similar to that in control cells transfected with vector alone (Fig. 4A). Overexpression of Skp2 and SCFSkp2 decreased the Cdt1 protein level to the same extent, suggesting that Skp2 was the limiting factor that regulated Cdt1 degradation.Fig. 4Skp2 regulates Cdt1 stability. A, overexpression of Skp2 decreases Cdt1 protein level. 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-Skp2, SCFSkp2 (FLAG-Skp2, HA-Cul, Myc-Roc1, and Skp1), or vector. Endogenous Cdt1 level was examined by Western blot against Cdt1 before and after MG132 treatment (10 μm, 3 h). Actin was used as a loading control. B, down-regulation of Skp2 results in an accumulation of Cdt1. 293T cells were transfected with pSUPER-siRNA/Skp2. Transfection efficiency was achieved above 70% revealed by expression of co-transfected GFP. Unsynchronized cells (unsyn) or S phase arrested cells (S arrested) by thymidine treatment (2 mm, 24 h) were lysed. Western blot analysis was performed using antibodies against Skp2, Cdt1, and Actin. C, down-regulation of Skp2 stabilizes Cdt1. 293T cells transfected with pSUPER-siRNA/Skp2 or vector alone were synchronized to the early S phase by thymidine treatment (2 mm, 24 h). Cells were subsequently treated with CHX (100 μm) and harvested for Western blot analysis (PAS701) at the indicated time. Actin was used as a loading control. D, association of Cdt1 with Skp2 is required for Cdt1 degradation. 293 cells stably infected with the Cdt1 mutant deleted for the N-terminal 105 residues were synchronized by thymidine arrest (2 mm, 24 h). Cells were lysed at the indicated time after CHX treatment (100 μm). Cdt1 polyclonal antibody PAS701, recognizing the C terminus of Cdt1, was used to examine protein level of both endogenous Cdt1 and Cdt1NΔ105.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also knocked down the expression of Skp2 in vivo using siRNA techniques. Down-regulation of Skp2 led to an accumulation of Cdt1 (Fig. 4B). To exclude the possibility that the accumulation of Cdt1 is a secondary effect of a possible G1 block due to the decrease in Skp2 level, we examined the Cdt1 level when cells were arrested in the early S phase by thymidine treatment. Similar results were obtained with thymidine-arrested cells (Fig. 4B). To determine whether the accumulation of Cdt1 was due to an increase of Cdt1 stability when Skp2 was targeted by siRNA, we measured the half-life of Cdt1. S phase-arrested cells were treated with CHX for various lengths of time prior to harvest, and the Cdt1 level was determined by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 4C, the half-life of Cdt1 was prolonged when Skp2 siRNA was expressed.To determine whether the Cdt1 and Skp2 association is important for Skp2 degradation, we measured the stability of the Skp2-binding defective mutant (Cdt1Δ105) with that of endogenous Cdt1. A 293 cell line that stably expressed Cdt1Δ105 was constructed by retroviral infection. As shown in Fig. 4D, Cdt1Δ105 was significantly more stable than endogenous Cdt1 as revealed by Cdt1 antibody (PAS701) recognizing the C-terminal part of Cdt1.DISCUSSIONOur results suggest that Cdt1 degradation is mediated by SCFSkp2-dependent ubiquitination pathway in mammalian cells. We showed that Cdt1 associated with Skp2, and the SCFSkp2 complex promoted Cdt1 ubiquitination both in vivo and in vitro. This SCFSkp2-mediated ubiquitination was likely to regulate the protein level of Cdt1. Overexpression of Skp2 led to a decrease of Cdt1, whereas down-regulation of Skp2 by siRNA resulted in Cdt1 stabilization. We also showed that a Cdt1 mutant defective in Skp2 binding exhibited greater stability than endogenous Cdt1, suggesting that the association of Cdt1 and Skp2 is important for Cdt1 degradation. Skp2 itself is also a cell cycle-regulated protein (47Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar, 48Marti A. Wirbelauer C.

Cell. 1995; 82: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). It begins to accumulate at late G1 and remains at its maximal abundance in S and G2, while Cdt1 is stable in G1 and degrades at the G1/S transition with the lowest abundance in S and G2 (27Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44905-44911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Such inverse proportionality of Cdt1 and Skp2 is consistent with the finding that Skp2 targets Cdt1 for degradation.Cdt1 is phosphorylated during the cell cycle (27Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44905-44911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Stabilization of Cdt1 by proteasome inhibitors results in an accumulation of phosphorylated Cdt1, suggesting that Cdt1 may be targeted for degradation when it is phosphorylated. We observed that Cdt1 associated with SCFSkp2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. This is consistent with previous observations that Skp2 binds to phosphorylated target proteins (40Tedesco D.

The protein coat usually contains at least one member of the PAT (perilipin, adipose differentiation-related protein, and TIP47) family. Evidence suggests that PAT proteins control access to the lipid they enclose. The protein S3-12, which has sequence similarity to the PAT proteins, was found in a screen for adipocyte-specific proteins. The adipocyte expression of S3-12 and its similarity to the PAT proteins suggest that S3-12 is involved in adipocyte lipid storage. To test this hypothesis, we supplemented 3T3-L1 adipocytes with fatty acids and assessed the distribution of S3-12 by immunofluorescence microscopy. Prior to fatty acid incubation, S3-12 was distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm on punctate structures of heterogeneous size. After 10 min of lipid loading, S3-12 localized to 500-nm structures concentrated at the adipocyte periphery. After longer incubations, S3-12 coated the surface of lipid droplets up to several micrometers in diameter. Initially, these droplets were distinct from those droplets surrounded by perilipin; but by 240 min, most perilipin-coated droplets had some S3-12 on the surface as well. We additionally report that the formation of S3-12-coated droplets 1) required glucose and fatty acids that can be incorporated into triacylglycerol, 2) was blocked by an inhibitor of triacylglycerol synthesis, and 3) was insulin-dependent.

To survive periods of nutrient scarcity, animals have evolved the ability to store energy as neutral lipid during periods of nutrient excess.

PAT proteins are defined by their lipid droplet localization and two conserved domains, the PAT1 and PAT2 domains. PAT proteins have been identified in animals from Dictyostelium to man. Mammals express at least five PAT proteins: three splice variants of perilipin, ADRP, and TIP47 (1Miura S. Gan J.W. Brzostowski J. Parisi M.J. Schultz C.J. Londos C. Oliver B. Kimmel A.R. J. Biol.

S3-12 was identified as a protein induced during adipocyte differentiation (5Scherer P.E. Bickel P.E. Kotler M. Lodish H.F. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Approximately two-thirds of the S3-12 sequence is composed of tandem repeats of a 33-residue motif. This motif is similar to a sequence in the PAT1 domain. Furthermore, S3-12 bears limited similarity to TIP47 and ADRP over the entire sequence. However, nearest neighbor analysis of the PAT protein family puts S3-12 on the most distal branch (1Miura S. Gan J.W. Brzostowski J. Parisi M.J. Schultz C.J. Londos C. Oliver B. Kimmel A.R. J. Biol.

Thus, it has been unclear whether or not S3-12 is a PAT protein. The precise functions of PAT proteins are not known. The best characterized members are the perilipins, which facilitate lipid storage and play an important role in remodeling the adipocyte lipid droplet during lipolysis. A current model proposes that, under non-lipolytic conditions, perilipin surrounds lipid droplets, thereby blocking access of intracellular lipases to the underlying neutral lipids (6Souza S.C. de Vargas L.M.

One of these lipases, hormone-sensitive lipase, is phosphorylated following lipolytic activation and translocates to the lipid droplet surface (12Egan J.J. Greenberg A.S. Chang M.K. Wek S.A.

Acta. 2000; 1483: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This recruitment of hormone-sensitive lipase requires the presence of perilipin that has intact amino-terminal phosphorylation sites (14Sztalryd C. Xu G. Dorward H. Tansey J.T. Contreras J.A. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1093-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Finally, lipolytic activation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes fragments the lipid droplets (6Souza S.C. de Vargas L.M. Yamamoto M.T. Lien P. Franciosa M.D. Moss L.G. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol.

The importance of perilipin to lipid metabolism has been demonstrated in vivo. Consistent with the role of perilipin as a barrier to lipolysis, perilipin knockout mice have reduced triacylglycerol (TAG) in their adipose tissue and are resistant to both diet-induced and genetic obesity (7Martinez-Botas J.

ADRP also may act as a lipolytic barrier around lipid droplets since overexpression of ADRP in cultured cells leads to increased fatty acid uptake (16Gao J. Serrero G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16825-16830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and to increased lipid droplet size and number (17Imamura M. Inoguchi T. Ikuyama S. Taniguchi S. Kobayashi K. Nakashima N. Nawata H. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E775-E783Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Most cells import, esterify, and package fatty acid as TAG in lipid droplets. The events required to synthesize and package neutral lipid into PAT protein-coated droplets are poorly understood. The intracellular location of neutral lipid synthesis remains uncertain (18Khelef N. Soe T.T. Quehenberger O. Beatini N. Tabas I. Maxfield F.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Buhman K.K. Chen H.C. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40369-40372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Furthermore, how neutral lipid gets from the site of synthesis to the core of the lipid droplets is not known. Given the major remodeling events observed when adipocytes are stimulated to release fatty acids, it is likely that remodeling also occurs when adipocytes are stimulated to store TAG. Accommodating and transporting hydrophobic TAGs likely require major changes in the arrangement of adipocyte membranes. Intracellular trafficking of PAT proteins may be important for neutral lipid packaging. For example, cultured cells grown in serum-containing medium without supplemental lipids have few lipid droplets and express little ADRP protein, but such cells express abundant TIP47 as a soluble cytoplasmic protein. Supplementation of the medium with fatty acid induces lipid droplet formation, increases the amount of ADRP protein (2Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Wolins N.E. Serrero G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2249-2263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and causes TIP47 to move onto nascent lipid droplets (4Wolins N.E. Rubin B. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5101-5108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Given the sequence similarity of S3-12 to the PAT proteins, we hypothesized that S3-12 participates in lipid droplet biogenesis. We report that S3-12 associates with the surfaces of nascent lipid droplets under conditions that promote TAG synthesis in a time-, substrate-, and insulin-dependent manner. Reagents—Unless otherwise indicated, reagents were obtained from Sigma. Essentially fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) was purchased from Intergen Co. (catalogue no. 3320; Purchase, NY). Protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Octyl glucoside was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Antibodies—The antibody to perilipin was purchased from Research Diagnostics Inc. (catalogue no. progp29; Flanders, NJ), that to flotillin-2/epidermal surface antigen (ESA) from BD Biosciences (catalogue no. 610383), and that to UCP1 (uncoupling protein-1) from Alpha Diagnostic International, Inc. (San Antonio, TX). The antibodies to the carboxyl termini of flotillin-1 and of S3-12 (S3-12C) were raised in rabbits and affinity-purified against peptides SISQVNHNKPLRTA and GPFTSMPCGQL, respectively, by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). The antibody that recognizes the S3-12 amino terminus (S3-12N) was raised in rabbits and affinity-purified against S3-12 peptide MSASGDGTRVPPKSKG by BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). Fatty Acids—Free fatty acids were solubilized with sodium hydroxide and bound to BSA at a molar ratio of 5.5:1. Immunoprecipitations—Proteins were captured with antibodies bound to protein A-Sepharose beads as described previously (20Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yamada K.M. Current Protocols in Cell Biology Online, Unit 7.2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2003Google Scholar). TAG Measurements—Adipocytes were differentiated and trypsinized as described under “Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy,” replated at their original density, treated as described in the figure legends, washed five times, and harvested in TNET (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100) with 0.5% cholate. To normalize TAG for protein, the protein content of the lysate was measured using the BCA assay (Pierce) with BSA as the standard. TAG was measured with a Trinder kit (catalogue nos. 337–10A and 337–10B; Sigma). Statistical Analysis of TAG Measurements—The amount of TAG measured in adipocytes treated with oleate clearly differed from that measured in the untreated adipocytes and in adipocytes treated with oleate + triacsin C (see Fig. 5A). However, it is not clear from inspection that the (oleate + triacsin C)-treated adipocytes had more TAG than the untreated adipocytes. Because the mean amounts of TAG and S.D. values in the amount of TAG have a large and positive correlation, statistical analysis was performed on log-transformed data. The null hypothesis was tested as follows. For each day's experiment, the measurements from the untreated adipocytes (n = 6) and from the (oleate + triacsin C)-treated adipocytes (n = 6) were subtracted from the mean of the oleate-treated adipocytes (n = 6). These difference scores were used in an analysis of variance using two factors, treatments with two levels, days with three levels, and six observations within each of these six groups (see Fig. 5 legend). Cell Culture—3T3-L1 mouse fibroblasts (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were propagated and differentiated into adipocytes as described (21Frost S.C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2646-2652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adipocytes were maintained in 10% CO2 in “complete medium,” consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (catalogue no. 11965-084; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Immunoblotting—Proteins were resolved on 4–12% NuPAGE gels run in the MES buffer system (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunoreactive proteins were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence with ECL+ (Amersham Biosciences). Molecular mass standards were Precision Plus Dual Color Markers from Bio-Rad. Protein Extraction from Tissue—C57BL/6 mice were asphyxiated with carbon dioxide in a protocol approved by the Animal Care Committee of Washington University. Tissues were harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The tissues were ground in liquid nitrogen and transferred to a tube that contained TNET with 1% octyl glucoside (TNETO) or TNET with 1% cholate (TNETC) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete™ EDTA-free tablet, Roche Applied Science). The ground tissue/detergent homogenate was vortexed for 30 s, incubated on ice for 10 min, vortexed for 30 s, and centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined by the BCA assay as described above under “TAG Measurements.” Immunohistochemistry—Interscapular fat from a C57BL/6 mouse was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, paraffin-embedded, and cut into 4-μm sections for immunostaining. Antigens were unmasked with Nuclear Decloaker (Biocare Medical, Walnut Creek, CA) in the case of S3-12 staining and with citrate buffer (pH 6) in the case of UCP1 staining. Affinity-purified anti-S3-12N antibody was used at 5.5 μg/ml. Primary antibody to UCP1 was diluted 1:400. Secondary antibody was biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Antigen-antibody complexes were detected with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (catalogue no. P0397; Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA), followed by 3,3′-diamino-benzidine (Sigma). Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Tyramide amplification was used for S3-12 (but not UCP1) staining. Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Day 6 3T3-L1 adipocytes were trypsinized, replated at 30–50% of their original density, and allowed to recover for 2 days prior to being used in experiments. Adipocytes were treated as described in the figure legends and then fixed with 2% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min. The coverslips were washed with PBS and then incubated for 60 min with both anti-S3-12N (1.4 μg/ml) and anti-perilipin (diluted 1:10,000) antisera in microscopy buffer (1% BSA and 0.1% saponin in PBS). The coverslips were washed again with PBS and incubated for 30 min with Alexa 594-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (catalogue no. A-21207; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig IgG (catalogue no. A-11073), both diluted 1:1000 in microscopy buffer. Lipids were stained by the addition of 1 μg/ml BODIPY™ 493/503 (catalogue no. D-3922; Molecular Probes, Inc.) added from a 1 mg/ml stock in ethanol. The coverslips were mounted and viewed with a Zeiss Axioplan-2 microscope. Images were captured with a Hamamatsu Orca CCD camera. Image acquisition and post-processing were performed with Northern Eclipse software (Empix, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Scoring Adipocytes for S3-12-coated Lipid Droplets—After adipocytes were treated as described in the figure legends, they were stained for perilipin and S3-12 as described above. Adipocytes in each field were identified by the presence of large perilipin-coated lipid droplets. After adipocytes were identified, the light filters were changed to reveal S3-12 staining. Adipocytes were counted as having S3-12-coated lipid droplets if they had either a well defined ring of peripheral S3-12-staining puncta or S3-12-staining lipid droplets with discernible cores. For each coverslip, 10 fields were counted with an average of 18 adipocytes/field. Preparation of Antisera Specific for S3-12—To generate specific reagents for the subcellular localization of S3-12, we raised antisera against the amino-terminal (S3-12N) and carboxyl-terminal (S3-12C) peptides of murine S3-12. Each of the resulting antibodies immunoprecipitated from murine white adipose tissue (WAT) a single polypeptide of the predicted size of S3-12 (∼150 kDa) that was recognized upon immunoblotting by both antibodies. Neither antibody recognized proteins precipitated by a control rabbit polyclonal antibody to an unrelated protein (flotillin-1). Thus, the anti-S3-12N and anti-S3-12C antibodies specifically recognize the amino and carboxyl termini of murine S3-12, respectively (Fig. 1). S3-12 Protein Expression Is Largely Limited to WAT—The original report of S3-12 showed that S3-12 RNA was highly expressed in WAT, with little or no expression in other tissues (5Scherer P.E. Bickel P.E. Kotler M. Lodish H.F. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Expression in brown adipose tissue (BAT) was not reported. We immunoblotted various tissue lysates for comparison with 3T3-L1 adipocyte expression of S3-12 protein. S3-12 protein was highly expressed in WAT in comparison with 3T3-L1 adipocytes and all other tissues examined. BAT, heart, and skeletal muscle showed detectable but weak expression. It was not clear whether this S3-12 signal was from the brown adipocytes and myocytes or from white adipocytes that may have been interspersed within the BAT or muscle. To address this question, the same membrane was reprobed with an antibody to perilipin, the expression of which is limited to adipocytes (brown and white) and to steroidogenic cells. Heart and skeletal muscle showed a clear S3-12 signal, but no detectable perilipin. This suggests that there is a small amount of non-adipocyte S3-12 expressed in heart and skeletal muscle (Fig. 2A), but we cannot rule out that the S3-12 detected in these tissues was from muscle adipocytes. BAT expressed much less S3-12 compared with WAT, despite similar perilipin expression in samples equally loaded for protein. Thus, it is likely that BAT expresses little or no S3-12 protein. This conclusion is consistent with the immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2B), in which the anti-S3-12N antibody strongly stained WAT, but not BAT. As preadipocytes differentiate into mature adipocytes, they undergo structural and biochemical remodeling. Like the PAT protein perilipin, S3-12 increased dramatically from days 2 to 4, and levels continued to increase through the conclusion of the experiment on day 10 (Fig. 2C). S3-12 Is Not Present on the Large, Perilipin-positive Lipid Droplets of Untreated Adipocytes—We used the anti-S3-12N antibody to probe the subcellular localization of S3-12 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. When these adipocytes were cultured in complete medium as described under “Experimental Procedures,” S3-12 was present most abundantly on cytoplasmic punctate structures that ranged in size from barely resolvable to ∼1-μm diameter (Fig. 3A). The staining intensity of these structures increased with their size. This staining was excluded from the perilipin-positive lipid droplets (Fig. 3, A–C). Lipid Loading of Adipocytes Leads to the Formation of a Discrete Pool of S3-12-coated Lipid Droplets—TAG accumulation can be driven by the addition of esterifiable fatty acids to the media of cells in culture (22Spector A.A. Mathur S.N. Kaduce T.L. Hyman B.T. Prog. Lipid Res. 1980; 19: 155-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). During lipid loading of non-adipocytes such as HeLa cells and MA-10 Leydig cells, the PAT protein ADRP accumulates, and TIP47 moves from the cytosol onto lipid droplets (4Wolins N.E. Rubin B. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5101-5108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). To assess if S3-12 is also affected by lipid loading, we incubated adipocytes in complete medium supplemented with albumin-bound oleate. Oleate supplementation caused time-dependent remodeling events that changed the intracellular distribution of S3-12 as well as lipid droplet size and number. After 10 min of lipid loading, the diffuse punctate staining of S3-12 observed before treatment (Fig. 3A) was replaced by a pattern of discrete, much larger puncta of more uniform size (∼500 nm) and staining intensity (Fig. 3D). These discrete uniform puncta were arrayed in a concentric ring around the perilipin-coated droplets, which surrounded the nucleus. A separate pool of S3-12 was present on puncta within the perilipin ring of droplets (Fig. 3, D–F). At 60 min of lipid loading, the S3-12 structures had increased in size, and many had developed discernible hollow cores. The S3-12 structures and perilipin-coated droplets remained in separate concentric rings at 60 min (Fig. 3, G–I). By 240 min, the S3-12 structures had increased further to several micrometers in diameter (Fig. 3J). Also by this time point, S3-12 staining was clearly apparent for the central pool of perilipin-positive droplets (Fig. 3, J–L). In the 60- and 240-min treatments, we observed that for both pools of lipid droplets, those lipid droplets most proximal to the nucleus were the largest and most intensely stained. The hollow cores seen in the S3-12-positive structures at 60 and 240 min were consistent with these structures being lipid droplets. To investigate this possibility, we incubated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with oleate or palmitate and then co-stained for S3-12 protein and for lipid with the hydrophobic fluorochrome BODIPY™ 493/503 (Fig. 4A). In this experiment, immunodetectable S3-12 surrounded cores that contained lipid, thereby confirming that these structures were lipid droplets. To obtain a quantitative assessment of the oleate effect, we counted 3T3-L1 adipocytes with S3-12-coated lipid droplets in the presence or absence of 1.8 mm oleate in complete medium after 60 min of incubation. In independent experiments (six replicates for each condition) performed on 3 different days, we examined a total of 697 adipocytes. In the absence of oleate, only 1 of 697 adipocytes had S3-12-coated lipid droplets. With oleate present, 92% of the adipocytes contained S3-12-coated droplets at 60 min. Formation of S3-12-coated Lipid Droplets Requires Long Chain Fatty Acids—Fatty acids differ in the rate and extent to which they can be incorporated into TAG (23Guo W. Choi J.K. Kirkland J.L. Corkey B.E. Hamilton J.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We tested whether fatty acids that are poorly incorporated into TAG would also lead to the redistribution of S3-12 to lipid droplets. Loading of adipocytes with the medium and short chain saturated fatty acids butyrate (4:0), octanoate (8:0), and decanoate (10:0), which are poorly incorporated into TAG, did not induce the formation of S3-12-coated lipid droplets (Fig. 4B). As observed with oleate (18:1), incubations with the long chain fatty acids linolenate (18:3) and palmitate (16:0) drove the formation of S3-12-coated lipid droplets (Fig. 4B). However, at the 60-min time point, induction of S3-12-coated lipid droplets by the saturated fatty acid palmitate was less extensive than that induced by the monounsaturated oleate or the polyunsaturated linolenate (Fig. 4B). Incubations with palmitate required 180 min to achieve a similar degree of S3-12 redistribution as that seen with oleate at 60 min (Fig. 4A). Given that palmitate is not as easily incorporated into TAG as oleate (24Listenberger L.L. Han X. Lewis S.E. Cases S. Farese Jr., R.V. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3077-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar), these data, together with the data above relating to fatty acyl chain length (Fig. 4B), suggest that S3-12 coating of lipid droplets may require incorporation of fatty acids into TAG. The coating of lipid droplets by S3-12 is fully reversible. Removal of oleate-supplemented medium and its replacement with lipid-poor medium result in the return of S3-12 to its basal distribution within 3 h (Fig. 4C). Inhibiting TAG Synthesis Blocks the Formation of Oleate-induced S3-12-coated Lipid Droplets—That formation of S3-12-coated droplets was dependent upon fatty acid substrates that can be incorporated into TAG suggested that the genesis of these structures requires new TAG synthesis. To test this hypothesis, we treated adipocytes with triacsin C. Triacsin C inhibits acyl-CoA synthetase-1 and -4. This inhibition largely blocks TAG synthesis, but has less effect on phospholipid metabolism (25Igal R.A. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 26Kim J.H. Lewin T.M. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24667-24673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). At 10 μm, triacsin C greatly reduced oleate-induced TAG accumulation during a 180-min incubation (Fig. 5A). At this concentration, triacsin C prevented oleate-induced S3-12-coated lipid droplet formation (Fig. 5B, compares panels I and II). Triacsin C did not block the nucleation of S3-12 onto discrete uniform puncta (Fig. 5B, panel II) similar to those observed at 10 min of oleate loading in the absence of triacsin C (Fig. 3D). Surprisingly, treatment of adipocytes with triacsin C but without oleate supplementation also showed significant nucleation of S3-12 onto similar puncta (Fig. 5B, panel III). Formation of Oleate-induced S3-12-coated Lipid Droplets Requires Insulin and Substrates for TAG Synthesis—Insulin is the primary anabolic hormone that promotes TAG synthesis in adipocytes. Because of the dependence of S3-12-coated droplet formation on TAG synthesis and on the presence of esterifiable long chain fatty acids, we reasoned that the absence of insulin or of glucose, the other substrate required for TAG synthesis, would prevent the development of these droplets. To examine the role of insulin and glucose, we identified a set of serum-free conditions that produced S3-12-coated droplets in a similar percentage of adipocytes as we had observed in complete medium with oleate supplementation. Specifically, PBS (pH 7.4) supplemented with 2% BSA, 1.8 mm albumin-bound oleate, 25 mm glucose, and 10 nm insulin was sufficient to cause the formation of S3-12-coated lipid droplets in 82% of adipocytes after 60 min (Fig. 6A). In most adipocytes, the combination of oleate and glucose without insulin or of oleate and insulin without glucose was insufficient to drive the formation of S3-12-coated lipid droplets (Fig. 6A). Similar to the results of the experiment performed in the presence of serum (Fig. 5B), triacsin C inhibited S3-12-coated droplet formation under serum-free conditions (Fig. 6A). 1 nm insulin was sufficient to drive significant S3-12-coated droplet formation in the presence of oleate and glucose substrates by 60 min (Fig. 6B). The data in this work reveal a previously unrecognized process of adipocyte lipid droplet biogenesis and maturation. Our major finding is that promotion of TAG synthesis in adipocytes results in the formation of S3-12-coated lipid droplets that initially are distinct from the pool of perilipin-coated lipid droplets. The pool of S3-12-coated droplets was not observed when adipocytes were cultured in lipid-poor complete medium. By 60 min of oleate treatment, there were two distinct populations of lipid droplets: the small peripheral droplets coated by S3-12 but not perilipin and the large perinuclear droplets coated by perilipin but not S3-12. With prolonged incubations, co-staining of S3-12 and perilipin on the more centrally located lipid droplets suggests an additional step in the maturation of S3-12-positive droplets. Our data do not indicate whether the co-staining of S3-12 and perilipin corresponds to fusion of these distinct pools of droplets or to the exchange of coat components. These data extend our understanding of how newly synthesized TAG is packaged and transferred to the mature lipid droplets. Return of S3-12 to its basal diffuse distribution upon removal of oleate from the medium suggests that S3-12 may cycle to and from the lipid droplet depending upon the nutritional status of the adipocyte. The lipid droplets that S3-12 coats in response to lipid loading have properties that suggest they are filled with newly synthesized TAG. First, substrates for TAG synthesis, oleate and glucose, are required for the formation of S3-12-coated lipid droplets. Furthermore, the extent of this formation positively correlates with the ease with which the fatty acid substrate is incorporated into TAG. Second, the anabolic hormone insulin is required for a robust response to these substrates. Third, if TAG synthesis is inhibited with triacsin C, the formation of S3-12-coated lipid droplets is blocked. Fourth, there is a clear time-dependent increase in the size of the structures identified by S3-12. Finally, during the time period when a large number of S3-12-coated lipid droplets form, a large amount of TAG accumulates. These properties of the S3-12-coated lipid droplets suggest that they may correspond to the esterification compartment for TAG synthesis, but this hypothesis remains for future experimental investigation. The dependence of S3-12 lipid droplet formation on insulin is not surprising given the role of insulin as an anabolic hormone that promotes TAG storage in adipocytes at multiple levels. Insulin increases the activity of lipoprotein lipase in adipose tissue (27Sadur C.N. Eckel R.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 69: 1119-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), which increases the amount of fatty acid substrate available for TAG synthesis. Insulin also increases the transport of both glucose and fatty acids into adipocytes by promoting the trafficking of specific glucose (28Cushman S.W. Wardzala L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4758-4762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Suzuki K. Kono T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2542-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar) and fatty acid (30Stahl A. Evans J.G. Pattel S. Hirsch D. Lodish H.F. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 477-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) transporters to the plasma membrane. Insulin also positively regulates the expression of genes involved in TAG synthesis, including acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (31Meegalla R.L. Billheimer J.T. Cheng D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), acyl-CoA synthetases, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (32Weiner F.R. Smith P.J. Wertheimer S. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23525-23528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The overexpression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ1, a target of the thiazolidinedione insulin sensitizers, in transgenic mouse liver has been associated with hepatic lipid accumulation (steatosis) and increased adipocyte-specific gene expression, including that of S3-12 (33Yu S. Matsusue K. Kashireddy P. Cao W.Q. Yeldandi V. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Gonzalez F.J. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 498-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Our data extend these previous findings of the importance of insulin for TAG synthesis and storage by revealing a novel insulin action in the assembly of nascent lipid droplets in adipocytes. It is instructive to place S3-12 in the context of the PAT family. We have now demonstrated that S3-12 functions as a regulated PAT protein in that it associates with lipid droplets in a hormone- and substrate-dependent manner. The PAT family members reported to date can be thought of as consisting of proteins of ubiquitous expression (ADRP and TIP47) or largely adipocyte-restricted expression (perilipin and S3-12). Viewed in another light, PAT family members are either constitutively present on lipid droplets (perilipin and ADRP) or present on droplets only under certain metabolic conditions (TIP47 and S3-12). Future studies will be needed to determine the precise functions of each of the family members in the biogenesis, maturation, and regulation of lipid droplets. Over the past decade, the adipocyte has received considerable attention as an endocrine cell that regulates energy metabolism via secretion of “adipokines” such as leptin, tumor necrosis factor-α, adiponectin, and resistin (34Mora S. Pessin J.E. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2002; 18: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, it is important not to ignore the lipid storage function of the adipocyte. The ability of the adipocyte to efficiently package and store TAG in lipid droplets is critical not only for energy storage, but also for partitioning lipid away from other tissues such as liver, muscle, and pancreas, where lipids may have adverse or “toxic” effects on cellular function with resulting insulin resistance and/or insulin secretory dysfunction (35Unger R.H. Annu. Rev. Med. 2002; 53: 319-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). In this context, elucidation of the mechanisms by which the adipocyte efficiently packages and stores TAG in different adipose depots may reveal underlying causes of obesity- or lipodystrophy-associated lipotoxicity.

However their role in diabetic vascular disease is unclear. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) act via their receptor, RAGE, to play a major role in diabetic complications. In this study, we investigated the effect of AGEs and S100b, a specific RAGE ligand, on the expression of COX-2 and the molecular mechanisms involved in cultured THP-1 monocytes and human peripheral blood monocytes. S100b treatment of THP-1 cells led to a significant 3–5-fold induction of COX-2 mRNA (p < 0.001). COX-2 protein and its product PGE2 were also increased, whereas COX-1 expression was unaffected. In vitro prepared AGE also induced COX-2 mRNA. S100b-induced COX-2 mRNA was blocked by an anti-RAGE antibody and by inhibitors of NF-κB (Bay11-7082), oxidant stress, protein kinase C, ERK, and p38 MAPKs. S100b (4-h treatment) significantly increased transcription from a human COX-2 promoter-luciferase construct (4-fold, p < 0.001). Promoter deletion analyses and inhibition of transcription by an NF-κB superrepressor mutant confirmed NF-κB involvement. This was further supported by inhibition of S100b-induced PGE2 by Bay11-7082. Additionally, S100b-induced adherence of THP-1 monocytes to vascular smooth muscle cells was blocked by the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398, Bay11-7082, inhibitors of ERK and p38 MAPK, and protein kinase C thereby indicating functional relevance. S100b also increased COX-2 mRNA expression in human peripheral blood monocytes from healthy donors. Moreover, COX-2 mRNA levels were clearly evident in monocytes obtained from diabetic patients but not from normal subjects. These results show for the first time that AGEs can augment inflammatory responses by up-regulating COX-2 via RAGE and multiple signaling pathways, thereby leading to monocyte activation and vascular cell dysfunction.

Although COX-2 can lead to the formation of the vasodilatory and protective prostacyclin (PGI2), it also produces the potent inflammatory prostaglandin, PGE2 (3Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys.

Reports show the ability of stimuli to induce transcription of the COX-2 gene via the involvement of cis-acting elements such as AP2, STAT-1, STAT-3, NF-κB, NF-IL-6, cAMP-response element, peroxisomal proliferator response element (PPRE), and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) transcription factors (7Nakao S.

COX-2 and its pro-inflammatory products have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, and it is also induced by oxidized lipids (27Schonbeck U. Sukhova G. Graber P. Coulter S. Libby P.

COX-2 was shown to promote early atherosclerotic lesion formation in low density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice (28Burleigh M.E. Babaev V.R. Oates J.A. Harris R.C. Gautam S. Riendeau D. Marnett L.J. Morrow J.D. Fazio S. Linton M.F. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1816-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Because COX-2 inhibitors also block formation of the protective prostacyclin (PGI2), studies have been performed to determine whether these inhibitors could worsen atherosclerosis (30Pratico D.

Med. 2001; 345: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). COX-2 has also been shown to play a role in islet dysfunction related to the development of Type 1 diabetes. Thus COX-2 and PGE2 are implicated in pancreatic islet β-cell destruction and inhibition of insulin secretion (11Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1379-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 12McDaniel M.L. Kwon G. Hill J.R. Marshall C.A. Corbett J.A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.

Nitric oxide, as well as cytokines associated with islet dysfunction such as IL-1β, can induce COX-2 expression (12McDaniel M.L. Kwon G. Hill J.R. Marshall C.A. Corbett J.A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1996; 211: 24-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although a recent study demonstrated that high glucose can induce IL-1β in human pancreatic islets (32Maedler K. Sergeev P. Ris F. Oberholzer J. Joller-Jemelka H.I. Spinas G.A. Kaiser N. Halban P.A. Donath M.Y. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar), the effects on COX-2 were not examined. High glucose (HG) was shown to enhance IL-1β-induced COX-2 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (33Lee S.H. Woo H.G. Baik E.J. Moon C.H. Life Sci. 2000; 68: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and a very recent report showed that high glucose treatment of endothelial cells increased COX-2 expression and decreased nitric oxide availability (34Cosentino F. Eto M. De Paolis P. Van Der Loo B. Bachschmid M. Ullrich V. Kouroedow A. Gatt C.D. Joch H. Volpe M. Luscher T.F. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The administration of the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 could prevent the onset of diabetes in mice (35Tabatabaie T. Waldon A.M. Jacob J.M. Floyd R.A. Kotake Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of COX-2 protein and its product PGE2 were found in the spinal cord of diabetic rats (36Freshwater J.D. Svensson C.I. Malmberg A.B. Calcutt N.A. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2249-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, very little is known regarding the potential involvement of COX-2 in diabetic vascular complications, diabetic atherosclerosis, or the regulation of COX-2 in monocytes under diabetic conditions. This is a significant issue, especially because evidence now indicates the importance of inflammation in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and diabetes. Furthermore, the mechanisms of altered monocyte prostaglandin production in diabetes are largely unknown. Our present studies provide new information in this connection. Studies with inflammatory cells such as monocytes demonstrate that simulated diabetic conditions in vitro, such as high glucose culture conditions or treatment with advanced glycation end products (AGEs), can induce the expression of inflammatory cytokine and related genes via activation of specific signaling pathways and transcription factors such as NF-κB (37Bierhaus A.

In the present study, we evaluated the hypothesis that AGEs acting via their receptor, RAGE, can lead to increased COX-2 gene expression and activity and subsequent monocyte activation. AGEs are products of non-enzymatic glycation/oxidation of proteins/lipids that accumulate during natural aging and are also greatly augmented in disorders such as diabetes, renal failure, and Alzheimer's disease (42Brownlee M.

The proximity of cells expressing RAGE to lesional areas rich in AGEs suggest that AGE-RAGE interaction can trigger key cell signal transduction pathways and thereby lead to chronic cellular activation and dysfunction associated with diabetes. AGE ligation of RAGE activates oxidant stress, p21 ras, and downstream targets such as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and leads to the activation of transcription factors such as NF-κB (37Bierhaus A.

Although AGE-RAGE interaction has been implicated in inflammatory responses, the effects on COX-2 expression and regulation are not known. In the present studies, we demonstrate for the first time that RAGE ligation by exogenous AGEs or by S100b can lead to potent increases in COX-2 expression and activity in THP-1 monocytic cells, as well as in primary human blood monocytes. COX-2 induction at 4 h was regulated transcriptionally and involved key NF-κB elements on the COX-2 promoter. These results suggest that simultaneous production of cytokines and COX-2 products by HG and AGEs in a diabetic environment can trigger an amplifying inflammatory loop and lead to accelerated vascular complications.

Preparation of Methylglyoxal Modified Albumin (AGE)—Methylglyoxal-modified albumin (40Westwood M.E. Thornalley P.J. Immunol. Lett. 1995; 50: 17-21Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (AGE) was prepared as follows: bovine serum albumin (fraction V; fatty acid-free, low endotoxin) (10 mg/ml) was incubated with 100 μm methylglyoxal (Sigma) in PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 37 °C for 7 days. After incubation, the free methylglyoxal was removed by dialysis against PBS at 4 °C for 24 h. The methylglyoxal modified albumin was then vacuum-dried and dissolved in PBS at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. Aliquoted samples were stored at –70 °C. Cell Culture and Treatments—Human THP-1 monocytic cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured as described (38Guha M. Bai W. Nadler J.L. Natarajan R. J. Biol.

Cells were treated with or without 5–10 μg/ml S100b. In some experiments, THP-1 cells were pre-treated with actinomycin D (transcription inhibitor; 0.1 μg/ml), cycloheximide (protein synthesis inhibitor; 0.5 μg/ml), Bay11-7082 (NF-κB inhibitor; 10 μm), NS-398 (COX-2 inhibitor; 25 μm), AG-490 (Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) inhibitor; 100 μm), SB202190 (p38 MAPK inhibitor; 1 μm), or GFX (PKC inhibitor; 0.5 μm), PD-98059 (MEK pathway inhibitor; 25 μm), or NAC (antioxidant, 100 μm).

Isolation of Human Peripheral Blood Monocytes (PBMC)—50–60 ml of blood from adult volunteers with established Type 1 diabetes and also from normal healthy donors were collected in the presence of anticoagulant in accordance with an approved Institutional Review Board protocol. The blood was diluted with equal volumes of PBS. An equal volume of diluted blood was overlaid on Ficoll-Paque-plus in 1:1 ratio and centrifuged at 400 × g for 20–30 min at 18–20 °C. The leukocyte population was collected from the interface and washed with PBS several times to remove plasma and Ficoll. About 50 million washed cells in 10 ml of RPMI medium containing 10% FCS were plated in 100-mm culture dishes to allow monocytes to adhere on the surface of the dish for 2–3 h. The non-adherent cells (mainly lymphocyte population) were removed, washed with fresh medium, cultured in RPMI medium, and labeled as PBLC. Attached monocytes were washed twice with warm RPMI medium containing 10% FCS and allowed to remain in the dish overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2. During this period the monocytes detach from the dish. They were collected and washed in fresh RPMI medium and labeled as PBMC. Then, about 1 × 105 cells from normal volunteers per well in 6-well plates were treated with S100b for 4 h, and total RNA was isolated as described below.

https://openalex.org/W1964718989,"The Nek family of protein kinases in humans is composed of 11 members that share an amino-terminal catalytic domain related to NIMA, an Aspergillus kinase involved in the control of several aspects of mitosis, and divergent carboxyl-terminal tails of varying length. Nek6 (314AA) and Nek7 (303AA), 76% identical, have little noncatalytic sequence but bind to the carboxyl-terminal noncatalytic tail of Nercc1/Nek9, a NIMA family protein kinase that is activated in mitosis. Microinjection of anti-Nercc1 antibodies leads to spindle abnormalities and prometaphase arrest or chromosome missegregation. Herein we show that Nek6 is increased in abundance and activity during mitosis; activation requires the phosphorylation of Ser206 on the Nek6 activation loop. This phosphorylation and the activity of recombinant Nek6 is stimulated by coexpression with an activated mutant of Nercc1. Moreover, Nercc1 catalyzes the direct phosphorylation of prokaryotic recombinant Nek6 at Ser206 in vitro concomitant with 20–25-fold activation of Nek6 activity; Nercc1 activates Nek7 in vitro in a similar manner. Nercc1/Nek9 is likely to be responsible for the activation of Nek6 during mitosis and probably participates in the regulation of Nek7 as well. These findings support the conclusion that Nercc1/Nek9 and Nek6 represent a novel cascade of mitotic NIMA family protein kinases whose combined function is important for mitotic progression.

These findings support the conclusion that Nercc1/Nek9 and Nek6 represent a novel cascade of mitotic NIMA family protein kinases whose combined function is important for mitotic progression. The NIMA family of protein kinases is named after the Aspergillus nidulans protein kinase encoded by the nimA gene (1Osmani S.A. Ye X.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Mutation of nimA (never in mitosis A) arrests cells in G2 without interfering with p34 cdc2 activation (2Osmani A.H. McGuire S.L. Osmani S.A. Cell. 1991; 67: 283-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), suggesting that the NIMA protein has a central role in the G2/M transition. Moreover, if the G2 arrest of nimA mutants is bypassed by additional mutations, the resulting mitotic cells show aberrant spindle and nuclear envelope organization (3Osmani S.A. Pu R.T. Morris N.R.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1453-1465PubMed Google Scholar), pointing to functions of NIMA beyond the control of mitotic entry. NIMA can induce chromatin condensation and nuclear membrane breakdown in mammalian cells as it does in Aspergillus (3Osmani S.A. Pu R.T. Morris N.R.

Cell. 1995; 81: 413-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), suggesting that these functions are also regulated by protein kinases with similar specificity in vertebrate cells. Eleven protein kinases with a catalytic domain related to NIMA have been identified in the human genome (7Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6075) Google Scholar), and a substantial fraction were first described very recently (8Kandli M. Feige E. Chen A. Kilfin G. Motro B.

The best characterized of these kinases, Nek2, has been implicated in the regulation of the centrosome (13Fry A.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6184-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar); Nek1 and Nek8 mutations have been related to cystic kidney disease (14Upadhya P. Birkenmeier E.H. Birkenmeier C.S.

Development. 2002; 129: 5839-5846Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar); Nek6/7 have been suggested to phosphorylate and activate p70 S6 kinase (16Belham C. Comb M.J. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1155-1167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); and Nek9/Nercc1 has been implicated in the control of mitotic spindle formation and chromosome segregation (10Roig J. Mikhailov A. Belham C. Avruch J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1640-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Nek6 together with its close homolog, Nek7, were purified from rat liver as the predominant kinases capable of phosphorylating in vitro the hydrophobic regulatory site (Thr412) of the p70 S6 kinase in vitro (16Belham C. Comb M.J. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1155-1167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Recombinant Nek6 polypeptide is recovered as an active protein kinase after transient expression in HEK293 cells and activates coexpressed p70 S6 kinase in vivo (as well as directly in vitro) in a manner synergistic with PDK1; nevertheless, recent evidence indicates that Nek6 (and by extension Nek7) is not a physiologic activator of p70 S6 kinase (17Lizcano J.M. Deak M. Morrice N. Kieloch A. Hastie C.J. Dong L. Schutkowski M. Reimer U. Alessi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27839-27849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and thus its roles in cell regulation are unknown. To gain insight into Nek6/7 regulation and function, we sought to uncover the mechanism underlying the activation of the Nek6/7 kinases and to define the regulation of the endogenous enzymes. We find that Nercc1, another NIMA family kinase previously shown to bind Nek6, phosphorylates directly a critical site on the activation loop of both Nek6 and Nek7 and activates these kinases in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, like Nercc1, endogenous Nek6 is activated in mitosis. The ability of Nercc1 to directly activate Nek6 points to the likely operation of a cascade of NIMA-related mitotic protein kinases.

(Lake Placid, NY). HEK293, H4-II-E-C3, HeLa, and U2OS cells were obtained from ATCC. Construction of Expression Plasmids—The mammalian expression vectors PEBG 2T and pCMV5 FLAG encoding wild type and kinase-dead (K74M/K75M) Nek6, the pCMV5 FLAG plasmid encoding different forms of Nercc1 and the bacterial expression vector pGEX KG expressing GST-Nercc1-(732–979) have been described previously (10Roig J. Mikhailov A. Belham C. Avruch J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1640-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 16Belham C. Comb M.J. Avruch J. Curr.

For construction of pcDNA3.1 His6/Myc Nek6, a PCR fragment was generated using pCMV5 FLAG Nek6 as template encoding the open reading frame of human Nek6 lacking the stop codon and surrounded at the initiator methionine by an optimum Kozak sequence. This fragment was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 Myc/His6, allowing Nek6 to be expressed in mammalian cells as a fusion protein with His6 and Myc epitopes at the C terminus. All site-directed mutant Nek6 variants in pcDNA3.1 Myc/His6 were constructed by PCR-mediated overlap extension mutagenesis and subsequently subcloned into pCDNA3.1 Myc/His6. All clones were verified by sequencing. Generation of Rabbit Anti-Nek6 Antisera—A synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of mouse Nek6 (amino acids 2–15) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin was used to immunize rabbits in order to produce anti-total Nek6 antibodies. Phosphospecific antibodies were produced using peptides corresponding to Nek6 residues 194–204 (Cys-GRFFSSETpTAAH (where pT represents phosphothreonine); anti-phospho-Thr202) and 203–214 (Cys-AAHpSLVGTPYYM (where pS represents phosphoserine); anti-phospho-Ser206). Cell Culture, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant and Endogenous Proteins—Maintenance of HEK293 cells and H4-II-E-C3 cells has been described previously (16Belham C. Comb M.J. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1155-1167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% serum. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE™ according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer or buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with Calyculin A (50 nm) and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet/50 ml). Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. To immunoprecipitate recombinant proteins, the corresponding antibodies prebound to protein A/G-Sepharose were incubated with the lysates at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were washed and subsequently used. GST-Nercc-(732–979), Nek7 and Nek6 expression in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 DE3 pLys (Novagen) transformed with the pGEX KG expression vector was induced by incubation with 300 μm isopropyl-1thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 16 h at 25 °C. The purification of this and other recombinant GST-tagged polypeptides from transfected mammalian cells was done using GSH beads using standard protocols. In-gel Kinase Assay—In-gel kinase assay of Nek6 and Nek7 activity was according to Ref. 18Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar. When indicated, 0.2 mg/ml MBP was included in the gel as a substrate. MS Determination of P-sites—Gel bands were excised as digested with trypsin, and resultant peptides were extracted from the gel. An aliquot of peptide was loaded onto a fused silica (360 μm OD, 50 μm ID; PolyMicro) capillary C-18 (ODS) column with a pulled emitter tip (19Martin S.E. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Marto J.A. Anal. Chem. 2001; 72: 4266-4274Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Peptides were HPLC gradient-eluted (0–100% B, where A = 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and B = 70% CH3CN and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and analyzed by a LCQ DECA XP ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). The mass spectrometer was set to data-dependent mode to take MS/MS spectra of the top five most abundant m/z peaks in each MS scan. The MS/MS spectra were searched (Sequest; ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) against a data base containing the protein in order to deduce the sequences. Potential post-translational modifications were also searched (STY = 80 (phosphorylation)). An additional aliquot of each sample was subjected to immobilized metal affinity chromatography to enrich the sample for phosphorylated peptides. Each experiment was performed as previously described (20Ficarro S.B. McCleland M.L. Stukenberg P.T. Burke D.J. Ross M.M. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. White F.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). Briefly, peptides were loaded onto a capillary immobilized metal affinity chromatography column. The column was washed to remove nonspecific binding, and then the peptides were eluted onto a capillary C-18 precolumn. The precolumn was washed with HPLC buffer and then connected to the analytical column described above. The peptides were eluted and analyzed as described above. Sequest peptide sequences were manually confirmed to ensure correct sequence identification. Nek6 Kinase Assay—Immunoprecipitates of recombinant (anti-FLAG or anti-Myc) or endogenous Nek6 were first washed in the extraction buffer containing 0.5 m LiCl three times and twice in kinase buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate). Kinase assays were performed in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 1.5 μg of GST-p70 S6 kinase ΔCT104 (T252A) or MBP (0.2 mg/ml) and initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP (5 μm final concentration at 4000 cpm/pmol). Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of 4× SDS sample buffer. Kinase mixtures were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and Nek6 phosphotransferase activity was determined by excising Coomassie-stained bands corresponding to the substrate and measuring radioactive content by Cerenkov scintillation counting. Two-dimensional Tryptic Phosphopeptide Mapping—HEK293 cells expressing various Nek6-His6/Myc constructs were incubated with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 32Pi for 4 h prior to harvest. The Myc immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, fixation, and staining. The gel slice containing [32P]Nek6 was equilibrated in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5), homogenized, and subjected to several rounds of tryptic digestion until at least 75% of initial [32P]Nek6 was extracted into the supernatant. The dried, salt-free digest was separated by thin layer electrophoresis at pH 1.9 followed by TLC as described previously (21Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Plates were exposed using a PhosphorImager. Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen), further purified using the Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA) RNeasy total RNA isolation kit according to the instruction manual, and quantified using Ribogreen (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). After DNase I treatment, quantitative RT-PCR was performed in duplicate using the Brilliant One-Step quantitative RT-PCR kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) containing SYBR Green I (1:30,000, Sigma), forward and reverse primers (25 nm each), and sample RNA (1 μg). The nucleotide sequences of the primers used were as follows: Nek6-F (5′-CGAAAAGAAGATAGGCCGAGG-3′) and Nek6-R (5′-TGCACCTTCTTCAGAGCCACT-3′) with Nek6-specific product size of 89 bp and TATA box-binding protein (TBP)-F (5′-TGATGCCCTTCTGTAAGTGCC-3′) and TBP-R (5′-GCACGGTATGAGCAACTCACA 3′) with a TBP-specific product size of 101 bp. The thermal cycling conditions comprised an initial RT reaction step at 48 °C for 30 min and 40 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s and 65 °C for 1 min. Accumulation of PCR product was monitored in real time (Mx4000; Stratagene) with appropriate controls. A standard curve was generated for each target, and the amount of each mRNA relative to total RNA was determined using the crossing threshold (Ct) method; the amount of Nek6 RNA was divided by the amount of TBP RNA. Nek6 Activation Requires Phosphorylation of Ser206 in the Activation Loop—Overexpressed wild type FLAG-Nek6 migrates as a doublet on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A), whereas the kinase inactive mutant, FLAG-Nek6 (K74M/K75M) migrates as a single band corresponding in mobility to the more rapidly migrating band of wild type Nek6 (16Belham C. Comb M.J. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1155-1167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Only the slower moving Nek6 band exhibits autophosphorylation in a washed immunoprecipitate, and only this upper band catalyzes MBP phosphorylation after renaturation in an “in gel” kinase assay (Fig. 1A). Treatment of mammalian recombinant Nek6 with protein phosphatase 2A in vitro abolishes Nek6 kinase activity and eliminates the slower migrating band of Nek6 polypeptide on SDS-PAGE (16Belham C.

These features indicate that the activity of recombinant Nek6 is dependent on Nek6 polypeptide phosphorylation, probably catalyzed by another protein kinase. Wild type FLAG-tagged Nek6, immunopurified after transient expression in HEK293 cells, was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and each Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained band of the closely spaced FLAG-Nek6 doublet (Fig. 1B) was excised and digested with tryspin, and the digests were analyzed by liquid chromatography/MS/MS in order to identify sites of phosphorylation. The inactive, more rapidly migrating band yielded a single phosphopeptide surrounding Ser206 in the activation loop, whereas the peptides derived from the slower migrating, active Nek6 band exhibited phosphorylation at Ser206, Thr202, and Ser37, with the peptide segment encompassing Thr202/Ser206 yielding roughly equal amounts of peptides phosphorylated at Ser206 exclusively and those phosphorylated at both Ser206 and Thr202. Peptides phosphorylated at Thr202 exclusively were not observed. We therefore prepared polyclonal anti-phosphopeptide antibodies specific for Nek6 phosphorylated at Ser206 or Thr202 (Fig. 1C, left). An immunoblot of transiently expressed FLAG-Nek6 indicates that detectable immunoreactivity with either antibody was evident only in the upper, more slowly moving band of Nek6 polypeptide (Fig. 1C, right). It is likely that the detection by MS-MS of phospho-Ser206 in the bottom, faster Nek6 band reflects trace contamination by the upper band, a view supported by the finding that mutation of Ser206 to Asp results in a slowing of the Nek6 polypeptide on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). Transiently expressed mutant, inactive Nek6 (K74M/K75M) yielded no phosphopeptides on MS-MS analysis of tryptic digests; the tryptic peptide encompassing Ser206/Thr202 was identified only in its unphosphorylated state. The activity of a variety of Nek6 site-specific mutations was characterized (Fig. 2A). Conversion of Ser206 to Ala reduced Nek6 activity by 98%, and S206D mutant, although upshifted in mobility on SDS-PAGE, exhibited only ∼5–10% of wild type activity. Conversion of Thr202 to Ala or Cys or conversion of the adjacent Thr residues at 201 and 202 both to Ala reduced Nek6 activity by 75–80%, whereas conversion of the nearby pair of Ser at 198 and 199 to Ala had no effect on Nek6 activity. Introduction of a Thr202 → Glu mutation into wild type Nek6 increases the apparent specific activity by ∼20%; however, introduction of Thr202 → Glu into the Ser206 → Asp background increases the low activity of this mutant by ∼3-fold, so that the double mutant (S206D/T202E) exhibits ∼20% of wild type activity. These results indicate that Nek6 activation is absolutely dependent on Ser206 phosphorylation and support the likelihood that phosphorylation at Thr202, although not indispensable or of primary importance, further augments Nek6 activity. The primary role of Nek6 Ser206 phosphorylation is further supported by the findings on two-dimensional 32P tryptic peptide maps of transiently expressed wild type and mutant Nek6 polypeptides (Fig. 2B), which demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser206 is necessary for the phosphorylation of other Nek6 sites. The 32P incorporation in vivo into Nek6 (S206A) is reduced by >80% as compared with wild type Nek6. Moreover, whereas two-dimensional 32P tryptic peptide maps of [32P]Nek6 exhibit a single dominant 32P-peptide, two minor 32P-peptides, and several trace 32P-peptides, maps of [32P]Nek6 (S206A) lack all three of the characteristic 32P-peptides and exhibit only a faint background of the multiple trace, presumably nonspecific, 32P-peptides. The overall 32P incorporation into the Nek6 (T201A/T202A) mutant is also substantially reduced from wild type; however, the 32P-tryptic peptide map of this variant contains each of the three predominant 32P-peptides seen in digests of wild type Nek6, in a proportion similar to that seen in the wild type Nek6. We interpret this pattern to indicate that the mutation of Thr202 affects Nek6 activity primarily by reducing the extent of Ser206 phosphorylation and secondarily by the loss of its own phosphorylation. The persistence of the three major 32P-peptides in the T201A/T202A mutant suggests the occurrence in this mutant of phosphorylation at other sites situated on the same tryptic peptide (i.e. Ser198 or Ser199). In summary, Nek6 activity requires phosphorylation of Ser206 on the activation loop. Ser206 phosphorylation also appears to facilitate Thr202 phosphorylation, which may increase catalytic activity somewhat further. As to the mechanism by which these phosphorylations are accomplished, in vivo, the absence of detectable phosphorylation in the Nek6 ATP site mutant (K74M/K75M) suggests that either Ser206 phosphorylation is catalyzed by intramolecular autophosphorylation or, alternatively, Nek6 (K74M/K75M) interacts poorly with an upstream kinase. The evidence presented next strongly supports the latter explanation, at least in mammalian cells. Nercc1 Binds, Phosphorylates, and Activates Nek6 and Nek7—Recombinant wild type FLAG Nek6 expressed in 293 cells is recovered in association with endogenous Nercc1, another NIMA-related protein kinase (10Roig J. Mikhailov A. Belham C. Avruch J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1640-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). FLAG-Nek6 immunoprecipitates prepared from HEK293 cells invariably reveal the presence of endogenous Nercc1, which is retained despite exhaustive washes of the Nek6 immunoprecipitate (see, for example, Fig. 1B). The tight association between recombinant Nek6 and endogenous Nercc1 indicates a likely functional relationship. We therefore examined further the physical and functional interactions of Nek6 and Nercc1. Transient expression of GST-Nek6 yields substantial recovery of coexpressed wild type FLAG-Nercc1 polypeptide on GSH-agarose pull-downs (Fig. 3A). Wild type GST Nek6 also binds avidly to the catalytically inactive Nercc1 K81M and constitutively active Nercc1 mutant, Δ347–732; these results are consistent with our previous demonstration (10Roig J. Mikhailov A. Belham C. Avruch J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1640-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) that the Nek6 binding site maps between Nercc1 amino acids 732 and 891. Catalytically inactive Nek6 (K74M/K75M) is expressed at much lower abundance as compared with wild type Nek6; nevertheless, when its level of expression is comparable with that of wild type Nek6, it is evident that Nek6 (K74M/K75M) is greatly impaired in its ability to bind Nercc1 (Fig. 3A). Overexpression of wild type Nek6 with the constitutively activated Nercc1 mutant, Nercc1 (Δ347–732) (10Roig J. Mikhailov A. Belham C. Avruch J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1640-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), results in an observable upshift in the electrophoretic mobility of Nek6 (Fig. 3, B and A, lane 3 from left) and in a 2-fold increase in the specific activity of coexpressed Nek6 (Fig. 3B). Thus, active Nercc1 is able to induce Nek6 phosphorylation and activation in vivo; the modest stimulation of Nek6 activity by Nercc1 (Δ347–732) probably reflects the already high basal activity of recombinant overexpressed Nek6. Nercc1 (Δ347–732) also slows the electrophoretic mobility of the coexpressed inactive Nek6 mutant, K74M/K75M (Fig. 3C). Tryptic digests of Nek6 (K74M/K75M) coexpressed with Nercc1 (Δ347–732) exhibited on liquid chromatography/MS/MS considerable phosphorylation at Ser206 and small amounts of peptide phosphorylated at both Ser206 and Thr202; these findings were subsequently confirmed on anti-phosphopeptide immunoblots (Fig. 3C). The ability of coexpressed Nercc1 (Δ347–732) to promote these phosphorylations of Nek6 (K74M/K75M) requires an active Nercc1 catalytic domain. Thus, coexpression of Nek6 with active Nercc1 results in phosphorylation at Ser206 and a modest increase in the already substantial activity of coexpressed recombinant Nek6. We next sought to determine whether Nercc1 could directly phosphorylate Nek6. Immunopurified, recombinant wild type Nercc1 activated in vitro by autophosphorylation does catalyze the phosphorylation of a mammalian recombinant Nek6 (K74M/K75M) substrate at Ser206 (Fig. 4A). This modification occurs, however, with a rather low efficiency, consistent with the very poor binding of Nek6 (K74M/K75M) to Nercc1. Notably, all of the Ser206-phosphorylated Nek6 (K74M/K75M) polypeptide co-precipitates with Nercc1 (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the “stable” binding of Nek6 to Nercc1 is critical for Nercc1-catalyzed Nek6 phosphorylation. We therefore sought to use wild type Nek6 as substrate. Inasmuch as Nek6 overexpressed in mammalian cells shows high levels of Ser206 phosphorylation and kinase activity, we utilized bacterial recombinant GST-Nek6 and GST-Nek7. Surprisingly, GST-Nek6, which expresses poorly in bacteria and is predominantly insoluble, exhibits varying extents of Ser206 phosphorylation and spontaneous kinase activity depending on the batch (data not shown). In contrast, bacterial recombinant GST-Nek7 never showed activation loop (Ser195) phosphorylation or significant kinase activity when purified from bacteria. We examined “inactive” preparations of bacterial recombinant GST-Nek6 and GST-Nek7 for their ability to be phosphorylated and activated by Nercc1 (Fig. 4C). A computer search using the putative motif for Nek6 phosphorylation specificity (17Lizcano J.M. Deak M. Morrice N. Kieloch A. Hastie C.J. Dong L. Schutkowski M. Reimer U. Alessi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27839-27849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) identified several candidate Nek6 substrates; a GST fusion of the extreme carboxyl terminus of Cdc16, which contains several LXXS motifs, was readily phosphorylated by Nek6 and Nek7 but not significantly phosphorylated by active Nercc1. 2J. Roig and J. Avruch, unpublished results. GST-Nek6 and GST-Nek7 were incubated with Mg2+-ATP in the presence or absence of active Nercc1; after 30 min, GST-Cdc16-CT and tracer [γ-32P]ATP were added for an additional 30 min. As shown in Fig. 4C, Nercc1 catalyzes the phosphorylation of Nek6 (Ser206) and the equivalent site on Nek7 (Ser195), resulting in a 20–25-fold activation of Nek6/7 kinase activity. In contrast, Nek7, which is devoid of basal phosphorylation at Ser195 exhibits no ability to catalyze autophosphorylation at Ser195 during this in vitro incubation; Nek6 exhibits a low level of basal phosphorylation at Ser206, which does not change during the incubation with Mg2+-ATP. A similar experiment using active Nercc1 and GST-Nek7 was analyzed using an in-gel kinase assay with MBP as substrate (Fig. 4D); an upshift in Nek7 mobility is evident after Nercc1catalyzed Nek7 phosphorylation, and the “activated” MBP kinase activity co-migrates entirely with the upshifted band of Nek7. Inasmuch as the binding of Nek6 to Nercc1 appeared to be critical for the Nercc1-catalyzed phosphorylation of Nek6 in vitro (i.e. see Fig. 4B), we examined the effect of overexpressing the Nercc1 noncatalytic tail on the activity of coexpressed Nek6. A FLAG-tagged polypeptide consisting of Nercc1 amino acids 347–979 strongly inhibits the activity of coexpressed GST-Nek6 (Fig. 5A), con"

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1787-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In addition to SRCs and DRIPs, other VDR-interacting proteins have been implicated as positive comodulator proteins in this process. Nuclear coactivator-62 kDa (NCoA62) is one such coactivator protein that was isolated as a VDR-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen (18Baudino T.A. Kraichely D.M. Jefcoat Jr., S.C. Winchester S.K. Partridge N.C. MacDonald P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16434-16441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). NCoA62 was independently isolated as a protein that interacts with the v-Ski oncoprotein, and it was termed Ski-interacting protein or SKIP (19Dahl R. Wani B. Hayman M.J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). NCoA62/SKIP exhibits properties consistent with a NR coactivator in that it interacts directly with VDR and other NRs, and it enhances 1,25-(OH)2D3-, retinoic acid-, estrogen-, and glucocorticoid-activated transcription in transient expression assays. However, important differences exist between NCoA62/SKIP and SRCs. For example, NCoA62/SKIP lacks LXXLL type motifs, it interacts with VDR in an activation function-2-independent manner (18Baudino T.A. Kraichely D.M. Jefcoat Jr., S.C. Winchester S.K. Partridge N.C. MacDonald P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16434-16441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and it interacts with VDR through domains that are distinct from the H3–5/H12 surface cleft (20Zhang C. Baudino T.A. Dowd D.R. Tokumaru H. Wang W. MacDonald P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40614-40620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). NCoA62/SKIP also interacts preferentially with the VDR-RXR heterodimer compared with VDR monomer or VDR homodimer (20Zhang C. Baudino T.A. Dowd D.R. Tokumaru H. Wang W. MacDonald P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40614-40620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The mechanism through which NCoA62/SKIP functions to augment VDR-mediated transcription is not well understood, but it probably involves cooperation with other coactivators. For example, NCoA62/SKIP, VDR, and SRC form a ternary complex in vitro, and NCoA62/SKIP and SRCs synergize to augment VDR-activated transcription in transient reporter gene assays (20Zhang C. Baudino T.A. Dowd D.R. Tokumaru H. Wang W. MacDonald P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40614-40620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Studies using dominant negative inhibitors of each coactivator suggest that both NCoA62/SKIP and SRCs are needed for optimal VDR-mediated transcription in cell culture (20Zhang C. Baudino T.A.

Whereas these initial in vitro binding and heterologous expression studies strongly implicate a role for NCoA62/SKIP in nuclear receptor-mediated transcription, data showing that NCoA62/SKIP exists in functionally relevant transcription complexes on native vitamin D-responsive target gene promoters have not been reported. Additional clues to the mechanism of NCoA62/SKIP in VDR- and NR-mediated transcription comes from studies directed at characterizing protein components of the spliceosome as well as interchromatin granules, where many splicing factors reside (21Neubauer G. King A. Rappsilber J. Calvio C. Watson M. Ajuh P. Sleeman J. Lamond A. Mann M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 22Mintz P.J. Patterson S.D. Neuwald A.F.

Science. 2002; 298: 2205-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). These proteomic approaches showed NCoA62/SKIP association with the splicing machinery. In addition, the Schizosaccharomyces pombe ortholog of NCoA62/SKIP was shown to interact with the small subunit of the essential splicing factor U2AF (spU2AF23) (24Ambrozkova M. Puta F. Fukova I. Skruzny M. Brabek J. Folk P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 1148-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The identification of NCoA62/SKIP as a transcriptional coactivator and as a component of the spliceosome suggest that NCoA62/SKIP may function as a coupling factor that links NR-dependent transcription to RNA processing. This hypothesis complements recent studies indicating a tight coupling between NR-mediated transcription and RNA splicing (25Auboeuf D. Honig A. Berget S.M. O'Malley B.W. Science. 2002; 298: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 26Monsalve M. Wu Z. Adelmant G. Puigserver P. Fan M. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 307-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) as well as the recent proposal that NR coactivators, including NCoA62/SKIP, may play integral roles in coupling NR-activated transcription to RNA splicing (25Auboeuf D. Honig A. Berget S.M. O'Malley B.W. Science. 2002; 298: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence points to a close relationship between transcription regulation, RNA splicing, and the nuclear matrix (NM). The nuclear matrix is a complex network of proteins that is thought to provide a structural framework for organizing chromatin and for maintaining the overall size and shape of the nucleus (27Stein G.S. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Montecino M. Choi J. Zaidi K. Javed A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2527-2533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Beyond this critical architectural role, the nuclear matrix is emerging as a functional scaffold that may anchor components of diverse nuclear processes including DNA replication, RNA splicing, and RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. For example, protein components representing sites of replication, transcription, and splicing as well as nascent RNA remain attached to the nuclear matrix following in situ extraction procedures (28Nakayasu H. Berezney R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 29Jackson D.A. Hassan A.B. Errington R.J. Cook P.R.

Sites of active transcription are often associated with RNA splicing factors within discrete nuclear subdomains (32Wei X. Somanathan S. Samarabandu J. Berezney R. J.

Direct evidence for the importance of nuclear matrix targeting in transcription regulation is found in the Runx2/Cbfa1 osteoblast transcription factor. A nuclear matrix targeting signal within the Cbfa1 protein directs it to nuclear matrix-associated foci, and this targeting event is required for transactivation of the osteoblast-specific osteocalcin gene (33Zaidi S.K.

Whereas the significance of the nuclear matrix in these nuclear processes is the subject of continued investigation, these observations support an important role for this scaffold in transcription and splicing events in the cell. In this study, the transcriptional coactivator properties of NCoA62/SKIP and its potential interplay with the splicing machinery in the nucleus were investigated. We identified a nuclear localization signal at the C terminus of NCoA62/SKIP and show that nuclear NCoA62/SKIP is targeted to the nuclear matrix. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation strategies, we show that endogenous NCoA62/SKIP selectively interacts in a 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced manner with the vitamin D-responsive regions of native osteoblast promoters. It becomes associated with these complexes after VDR and SRC entry, suggesting it may function at more distal steps or through different mechanisms than the SRCs. We also provide evidence that NCoA62/SKIP interacts predominantly with RNA splicing factors as well as with putative components of the nuclear matrix. Finally, a dominant negative NCoA62/SKIP selectively blocks splicing of a growth hormone minigene cassette, thus providing functional evidence that NCoA62/SKIP is needed for appropriate splicing in VDR-activated gene expression. Based on these studies, we propose that this dual functional role for NCoA62/SKIP places it at the forefront of proteins that may serve to link transcription regulation by VDR and other NRs to RNA splicing and the spliceosome. Plasmid Constructs—A green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion with the COOH terminus of NCoA62/SKIP (GFP-NCoA62 531–536) was constructed in the pEGFP-Cl vector (Clontech). Complementary oligonucleotides encoding the last 6 residues of hNCoA62/SKIP and the stop codon were annealed and cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pEGFP-Cl. The following primers were used, 5′-AATTCCAAGAAGAGGAGGAAGGAATAGG-3′ and 5′-GATCCCTATTCCTTCCTCCTCTTCTTGG-3′. The construct was verified by DNA sequencing. To generate HA-tagged VDR, human VDR cDNA (encoding residues 4–427) was ligated into EcoRI/EcoRV-digested pCDNA 3.1/HA-B (Invitrogen). GSTNCoA62 157–536 was expressed in the DH5-α strain of Escherichia coli and purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography as described previously (20Zhang C. Baudino T.A. Dowd D.R.

C Yang and Dr. H. Y. Kao, respectively. The VDRE4TKGH minigene construct contains the human growth hormone gene under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter and four copies of a VDRE from the rat osteocalcin gene and was described previously (35Terpening C.M.

Deletion fragments of NCoA62/SKIP were generated by polymerase chain reaction using SG5-NCoA62/SKIP as a template. Primers with unique restriction site sequences (EcoRI and BamHI) were used to amplify selected regions of the NCoA62/SKIP using Vent polymerase, and these were cloned into the CMV-FLAG expression plasmid (Sigma). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfections—COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% charcoal-stripped, heat-inactivated calf bovine serum for 4 days prior to transfection. COS-7 cells were transfected by standard calcium phosphate precipitation procedures as described previously (36MacDonald P.N. Dowd D.R. Nakajima S. Galligan M.A. Reeder M.C. Haussler C.A. Ozato K. Haussler M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5907-5917Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). SaOS-2 cells were plated on 0.5% gelatin-coated coverslips in 6-well tissue culture plates. Cells were grown for ∼24 h after plating in McCoy's 5A supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. ROS 17/2.8 cells were seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates at a density of 8 × 104 cells/well. Cells were grown for ∼24 h after plating in Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Immunofluorescence Studies—Four-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) were used for immunostaining. Slides were pretreated with poly-l-lysine to promote cell attachment. Each chamber received 25,000 COS-7 cells in 0.3 ml of medium. Cells were transfected overnight with the indicated plasmids using calcium phosphate precipitation. Monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), medium was replaced, and proteins were allowed to express for an additional 24 h. Following a 10-min fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, the cells were blocked and permeabilized using PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.3% Triton X-100. Cells were incubated with primary antibody against the FLAG epitope (10 μg/ml M5 antibody from Sigma) or against the HA epitope (20 μg/ml anti-HA tag antibody from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) for 2 h at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and further incubated with a 4 μg/ml concentration of the appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated species-specific secondary antibody Alexa-Fluor 488 or 594 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 1.5 h in the dark. Finally, cells were washed with PBS and mounted with ProLong Antifade reagent (Molecular Probes). Cell staining was visualized using fluorescence microscopy or confocal microscopy. Fluorescence micrographs were obtained with a Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) FX-Microphot microscope, and confocal images were from a Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) LSM 410 confocal laser-scanning microscope using an argon-krypton laser (excitation lines, 488 and 568 nm) and a × 100 Plan-Neofluar oil objective. Confocal sections (0.5 μm in thickness) were taken to localize cellular staining in several planes. To standardize the collection of images, z axis heights of cells were measured, and optical slices were collected through the middle of cells. After adjusting the appropriate exposure times for the brightest samples, all images of cells were collected using the same magnification and exposure times. Nuclear Matrix Localization of NCoA62/SKIP—Cells were grown on 0.5% gelatin-coated coverslips (for in situ immunofluorescence) or in 100-mm tissue culture plates (for biochemical fractionation). For whole cell preparations, cells were immediately fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde (for in situ immunofluorescence) or resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer (for biochemical fractionations). For cytoskeletal (CSK) preparations, cells were extracted twice for 15 min on ice with CSK buffer (10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 300 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm vanadyl ribonucleoside complex) and then fixed or solubilized in SDS-PAGE buffer as described above. For nuclear matrix intermediate filament (NMIF) preparations, following CSK extraction, cells were digested by the addition of digestion buffer (10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 300 mm sucrose, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100) containing 50 units/ml RNase-free DNase I (Roche Applied Science). After 30 min, chromatin and cytoskeletal proteins were removed by a 10-min incubation in digestion buffer supplemented with 0.25 m ammonium sulfate. This solution was removed and replaced with a fresh aliquot for an additional 15 min. Cells were either fixed or solubilized in SDS-PAGE buffer for in situ immunofluorescence or Western blot analysis, respectively. Western Blots—Proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane followed by Western blot analysis. In brief, 5% milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 was used to block nonspecific binding. The blot was subsequently incubated with VDR antibody (anti-VDR C-20 rabbit polyclonal 1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-NCoA62 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:10,000 dilution) and with the secondary antibody (peroxidase anti-rabbit 1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After each antibody incubation, blots were extensively washed in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. For detection, the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used according to the directions of the manufacturer. In Situ Immunofluorescence for the Nuclear Matrix Studies—Detergent-extracted cell preparations and nuclear matrix intermediate filament preparations were incubated with PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin to block nonspecific antibody binding. Anti-NCoA62 antibody was used at a 1:250 dilution and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to fluorescein was used as the secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:300 dilution). After antibody incubations, cells were incubated with a 0.05 mg/ml concentration of the DNA counterstain 4′,6-diamidinophenylindole. Antibody incubations, washes, and DNA counterstaining were performed as described previously (37McNeil S. Zeng C. Harrington K.S. Hiebert S. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. van Wijnen A.J. Stein G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14882-14887Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Microscopic analysis was performed by using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope and a charge-coupled device camera interfaced with the MetaMorph Imaging System (Universal Imaging, Media, PA). Isolation of GST-NCoA62/SKIP-associated Proteins from HeLa Cell Nuclear Extracts—The GST and GST-NCoA62/SKIP fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified with glutathioneagarose as described (20Zhang C.

GST-NCoA62/SKIP was further purified by on a HiLoad Superdex 200 (16/60) column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 400 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT. HeLa cell nuclear extracts (10 mg/ml), prepared by the method of Dignam (38Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar), were kindly provided by Dr. C. M. Chiang. Twenty-five μg of GST-NCoA62/SKIP or GST were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μl of 50% glutathione-agarose in PBS in the presence or absence of 500 μg of HeLa nuclear proteins in a final volume of 110 μl in incubation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 40 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA at pH 8.0, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm DTT, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Subsequently, the beads were washed three times with 0.5 ml of washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40). The beads were boiled in 80 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and each sample was analyzed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver staining. The distinct proteins from HeLa cell nuclear extracts that specifically associated with GST-NCoA62/SKIP were isolated from the gel and subject to protein sequencing for identification by mass spectrometry at The Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Mass Spectrometry—For the protein digestion, the bands were excised from a Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gel and washed/destained in two aliquots of 50% ethanol, 5% acetic acid for 1 h each. The gel pieces were washed in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, dehydrated in acetonitrile, reduced with DTT, and alkylated with iodoacetamide. The gel pieces were then dehydrated in acetonitrile, washed in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, dehydrated again in acetonitrile, and dried in a Speed-Vac. In-gel trypsin proteolysis was overnight at room temperature. The peptides were extracted from the polyacrylamide in 50% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid and evaporated to <20 μl for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. A Finnigan LCQ-Deca ion trap mass spectrometer system with a Protana microelectrospray ion source interfaced to a self-packed 10 cm × 75-μm inner diameter Phenomenex Jupitor C18 reversed-phase capillary chromatography column was used for analysis. The data were analyzed by using all spectra collected in the experiment to search the NCBI nonredundant data base with the search program TurboSequest. All matching spectra were verified by manual interpretation. The interpretation process was also aided by additional searches using the programs Mascot and Fasta as needed. Some samples were also analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. For these analyses, the digest was desalted using a Millipore C18 ZipTip column that was eluted in the MALDI matrix (5 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 2.5% trifluoroacetic acid). Aliquots of the extract (1.5 μl) were spotted on a sample plate and analyzed using a Micromass TofSpec 2E time-of-flight mass spectrometry system. Spectra were typically composed of the summed spectra of ∼150 laser shots. The spectra were internally calibrated using trypsin autolysis peptides, giving mass accuracies that were generally better than 25 ppm.

These findings support and highlight the necessity that Aβ assembly intermediates be included as targets in AD drug development. While the delineation of which assembly intermediate(s) retain toxicity will aid in the rational design of specific inhibitors, screening assays have already identified a number of antifibrillogenic compounds (11Kuner P.

These findings led to the development of a series of peptides incorporating this sequence, which bind to the homologous region of Aβ and block its oligomerization (17Tjernberg L.O. Lilliehook C.

In another study an eleven residue peptide containing three prolines, which have a low propensity to form β-sheets, inhibited Aβ fibril formation (18Soto C. Kindy M.S. Baumann M. Frangione B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Peptides that protect against Aβ neurotoxicity in cell culture have been prepared by combining the Aβ-recognition motif with a disruptive element comprised of charged amino acids (19Ghanta J. Shen C.L. Kiessling L.L. Murphy R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29525-29528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Other inhibitors of Aβ assembly were developed by modifying peptides containing the Aβ-recognition motif with cholyl groups (20Findeis M.A. Musso G.M. Arico-Muendel C.C. Benjamin H.W. Hundal A.M. Lee J.J. Chin J. Kelley M. Wakefield J. Hayward N.J. Molineaux S.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6791-6800Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) or with N-methyl amino acids (21Gordon D.J. Sciarretta K.L. Meredith S.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8237-8245Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The usefulness of this family of peptidic antifibrillogenic agents may depend on reducing their inactivation by proteolysis. One approach to do this is the replacement of l- with d-amino acids, which creates peptide bonds that are resistant to proteases. This approach was evaluated with proline-containing inhibitor peptides and was found to improve the inhibitor stability without altering the antifibrillogenic activity (18Soto C. Kindy M.S. Baumann M. Frangione B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Similarly a cholyl-modified peptide exhibited activity when prepared with d-amino acids (20Findeis M.A. Musso G.M. Arico-Muendel C.C. Benjamin H.W. Hundal A.M. Lee J.J. Chin J. Kelley M. Wakefield J. Hayward N.J. Molineaux S.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6791-6800Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). It is fortuitous that the mirror image conformational change in these peptides, in going from l- to d-forms, did not have a profound negative effect on their potency. This might be expected given the effects of stereochemistry on Aβ assembly (22Esler W.P. Stimson E.R. Fishman J.B. Ghilardi J.R. Vinters H.V. Mantyh P.W. Maggio J.E. Biopolymers. 1999; 49: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and other protein/protein interactions (23Milton R.C. Milton S.C. Kent S.B. Science. 1992; 256: 1445-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In the present study we investigated this question by quantitatively evaluating the effect of l- to d-amino acid substitutions, on the potency of peptide inhibitors of Aβ assembly. We assessed the antifibrillogenic activity using Thioflavin T fluorescence, circular dichroism and electron microscopy. Unexpectedly, we found that the d-enantiomers of these peptides were considerably more potent at inhibiting Aβ fibrillogenesis than the original l-peptides. To confirm this counterintuitive finding, we showed that fibrillogenesis of the enantiomer of Aβ, d-Aβ, was conversely more potently inhibited by an l-enantiomer inhibitor peptide. Most significantly, the d-enantiomers more efficiently blocked Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in neuronal cell cultures. The design and optimization of antifibrillogenic molecules employing the Aβ16–21 recognition motif should therefore take into consideration that its interaction with Aβ displays a heterochiral stereoselectivity. Synthetic Peptides—Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 were prepared by American Peptide Company, Inc., d-Aβ1–40 was prepared by Biosource International, Inc. and peptide inhibitors were prepared by ResGen Invitrogen Corp. Peptides were of ≥95% purity. Peptide inhibitors, with the exception of KKLVFFA, were amidated at the C terminus. Disaggregation of Aβ—Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 were treated to remove aggregates using a modified version of a previously published procedure (24Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). A 2.5 mg/ml solution of Aβ1–40 or Aβ1–42 in HFIP (Aldrich) was degassed in a round bottom flask with nitrogen then sonicated in a bath sonicator (VWR) for 1 h. The solution was then filtered through an Anotop 25 Plus 20-nm filter (Whatman). Aliquots were stored in polypropylene tubes at –80 °C until use. Thioflavin T Fibrillogenesis Assay—An aliquot of Aβ1–40 in HFIP was dried under nitrogen in a polypropylene tube. The Aβ1–40 was dissolved to 80 μm in 0.04 m Tris base, pH 10.5, and sonicated under nitrogen for 15 min in a bath sonicator. An equal volume of 0.3 m NaCl, 0.01% sodium azide solution containing 20 μm ThT (Fluka) was added and the pH adjusted to pH 7.4. A 20-μl aliquot of Aβ1–40/ThT solution was combined with 20 μl of TBSA buffer containing the peptides to be tested, in a 384-well solid white polystyrene microplate (Corning). Microplates were sealed with a plastic sheet and incubated in a PerkinElmer, model HTS 7000 Plus microplate reader at 37 °C. Plates were shaken for 1 min before fluorescent readings every 15 min using bandpass filters of 430 nm (excitation) and 485 nm (emission). In this procedure ThT fluorescence is measured throughout the assembly process, in a similar way to that previously described for monitoring light chain fibrillogenesis in real-time (25Wall J. Schell M. Murphy C. Hrncic R. Stevens F.J. Solomon A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14101-14108Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The presence of ThT during the assembly reaction was previously found not to interfere with the formation of fibrillar Aβ (26LeVine H. II I Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar). We have also observed using CD that 5 μm ThT does not interfere with development of the β-sheet secondary structure in Aβ (data not shown). Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—The incubation conditions were modified for CD studies to permit measurements down to 190 nm. Buffered solutions (5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 μm EDTA) with and without either 10 μml-KLVFFA or d-KLVFFA inhibitor peptide and 20 μm disaggregated l-Aβ1–40 or d-Aβ1–40 peptide were prepared. In addition, 10-μm solutions of d- and l-inhibitor peptides were prepared in the absence of Aβ as controls. All solutions, 100 μl, were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h in sealed 96-well solid black polystyrene microplates (Corning) as described for the ThT assay. Samples were transferred to 0.1-cm path length quartz cuvettes and CD scans were performed immediately and after 48 h using a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter at 37 °C between 190 and 250 nm, with a resolution of 0.1 nm and a bandwidth of 1 nm. The secondary structure content was estimated from the CD spectra using the PEPFIT program (27Reed J. Reed T.A. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 254: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 28Colon W. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 605-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which has been found suitable for use with spectra from peptides such as Aβ (29Hasegawa K. Yamaguchi I. Omata S. Gejyo F. Naiki H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15514-15521Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—The solutions described above were sampled just before CD spectroscopy for preparation of platinum/carbon replicas. A 3-μl aliquot of the solution was placed onto a mica plate, air-dried, and transferred to a Balzers High-Vacuum Freeze-Etch Unit (Model 301). The specimen was shadowed with platinum under a 1.3 × 10–4 Pa vacuum at an angle of 30° and then coated with a carbon film. A replica was removed from the mica by flotation on deionized water and transferred to a 300-mesh transmission electron microscope grid. The grid was examined using a JOEL 2000 FX transmission electron microscope (JOEL) at a magnification of ×21,000. Aβ-induced Neurotoxicity Assays—For the Aβ1–42-induced neurotoxicity assay, primary cultures of rat cortical/hippocampal neurons were established from 18-day-old fetuses. After removal of meninges, cortical/hippocampal tissues were centrifuged, dissociated, and diluted to 0.8–1.0 × 106 cells/ml in Neurobasal B-27 medium (Invitrogen) containing 25 μm glutamate (Sigma), 0.5 mm glutamine (Invitrogen), 25 μm β-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen), and 2% B-27 supplement (Invitrogen). The cell suspension was plated on poly-l-lysine-coated 96-well plates and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humid atmosphere. On day 4 and 7of in vitro culture, the medium (50 μl and 60 μl/well, respectively) was exchanged with fresh pre-warmed glutamate-free Neurobasal B-27 medium (70 μl and 80 μl/well, respectively). To evaluate the protective effect of inhibitor peptides, culture medium was completely removed from the cells and replaced by 50 μl of inhibitor peptide solution (24 or 48 μm) followed by 50 μl of Aβ1–42 (24 μm), both prepared in glutamate-free Neurobasal B-27 medium. The Aβ1–42 solution was not preincubated before addition to the cells. The cells were then incubated for a further 72-h period after which viability was assessed using the WST-1 reagent (Roche Diagnostics). Briefly, 10 μl of WST-1 reagent was added to each well and following incubation for 20–40 min the absorbance was read at 450 nm using a microplate reader (PerkinElmer, model HTS 7000 Plus). For the Aβ1–40-induced neurotoxicity assay human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y, American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in a mixture (1:1) of Eagle's minimum essential medium (Sigma) and Ham's F12 medium (Cellgro), with 1% non-essential amino acids and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). The cells were trypsinized, suspended in the same medium with N2 supplement (Invitrogen), and plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates. Cells were incubated to permit adherence for a 2-h period at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The Aβ1–40 was preincubated for 24 h at 37 °C with or without a 4-fold molar excess of peptide inhibitor and then added to the cells. After incubation for a further 24 h, the cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, 10 μl of MTT labeling reagent was added to each well for 4 h followed by addition of 100 μl of the solubilization solution. Following incubation for 16 h at 37 °C, the absorbance was read at 560 nm using a microplate reader. For both Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–40, the percent cell viability was calculated as being equal to [(A 450 sample – A 450 blank)/(A 450 control – A 450 blank)] × 100. d-Enantiomers of Inhibitor Peptides More Potently Inhibit Aβ Assembly than l-Enantiomers—To evaluate the effect of chirality on the potency of peptide inhibitors of Aβ assembly, two enantiomeric pairs of inhibitor peptides were compared. One of these peptides, KLVFFA, corresponds to the primary sequence of Aβ16–21, an Aβ self-recognition motif (16Tjernberg L.O. Naslund J. Lindqvist F. Johansson J. Karlstrom A.R. Thyberg J. Terenius L. Nordstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). A second peptide, with an additional lysine at the N terminus, KKLVFFA, was also tested, as it was previously demonstrated to bind specifically to peptides containing the Aβ16–21 KLVFF motif (17Tjernberg L.O. Lilliehook C. Callaway D.J. Naslund J. Hahne S. Thyberg J. Terenius L. Nordstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12601-12605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The relative ability of these peptides to inhibit Aβ assembly was assessed using the amyloid specific dye ThT, which increases in fluorescence as Aβ peptides assemble into fibrillar structures (26LeVine H. II I Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar). Both KLVFFA and KKLVFFA inhibited about 16-fold more potently when in the d-form compared with the l-form. l-KLVFFA exhibited antifibrillogenic activity at 400 μm (Fig. 1A), which was similar to that of d-KLVFFA at 25 μm (Fig. 1C). l-KKLVFFA at 400 μm (Fig. 1D) inhibited slightly less effectively than did d-KKLVFFA at 25 μm (Fig. 1F). Three additional related peptide pairs, KIVFFA, KFVFFA, and KVVFFA, were produced by substitutions at the leucine, a residue previously shown to be critical for binding (16Tjernberg L.O. Naslund J. Lindqvist F. Johansson J. Karlstrom A.R. Thyberg J. Terenius L. Nordstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). The results of testing these at 20 μm (KIVFFA and KFVFFA) or at 100 μm (KVVFFA) are presented in Fig. 2. After incubation for 10 h, the d-forms were found to be more inhibitory in each case. We observed that while replacement of the leucine by isoleucine or phenylalanine did not greatly change the inhibitor activity compared with the parent peptide d-KLVFFA, replacement by valine did reduce the inhibition. Replacement by alanine (data not shown) caused a near complete loss of inhibitor activity, consistent with the much reduced binding of 125I-Aβ1–40 to solid phase bound d-KAVFF compared with l-KLVFF reported previously (16Tjernberg L.O. Naslund J. Lindqvist F. Johansson J. Karlstrom A.R. Thyberg J. Terenius L. Nordstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). It is concluded that inhibitor peptides interacting with the KLVFF motif, inhibit Aβ fibrillogenesis more potently when in the d-form.Fig. 2Comparison of inhibitor activity of three enantiomeric peptide pairs. Three enantiomeric peptide pairs were prepared by replacing the leucine of KLVFFA with isoleucine, phenylalanine, or valine. Aβ1–40,20 μm, was incubated as described under “Experimental Procedures” under ThT fibrillogenesis assay, in the presence of 20 μm KIVFFA or KFVFFA enantiomers, or 100 μm of KVVFFA enantiomers. The ThT fluorescence after 10 h of incubation is plotted. The fluorescence of Aβ incubated without inhibitor is shown on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Enantiomeric Aβ (d-Aβ 1–40) Exhibits Reciprocal Chiral Inhibitor Specificity—Enantiomeric proteins exhibit reciprocal chiral specificity with respect to their biochemical interactions (23Milton R.C. Milton S.C. Kent S.B. Science. 1992; 256: 1445-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Aβ synthesized entirely of d-amino acids (d-Aβ) was used to re-assess the effect of l- and d-forms of KLVFFA on Aβ assembly by ThT. As shown in Fig. 3, in the case of d-Aβ assembly, the l-enantiomer of KLVFFA was the more potent inhibitor. d-Peptide Inhibitors Most Effectively Reduce the Transition of Aβ 1–40 to β-Sheet Secondary Structure—Aβ transitions to a β-sheet-rich secondary structure during assembly into amyloid fibrils. We used CD to assess whether the inhibitor peptides could prevent Aβ from adopting a β-sheet conformation, and to determine which enantiomer was the most effective. l-Aβ1–40 before incubation exhibited a CD spectra, which when deconvoluted (27Reed J. Reed T.A. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 254: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) corresponded to a secondary structure of 60% random coil and 40% β-sheet (C of c = 0.96, Fig. 4A). l-Aβ1–40 after incubation in the absence of peptide inhibitors, transitioned to a secondary structure 60% β-sheet and 40% α-helix (C of c = 0.98; Fig. 4A). The presence of 10 μmd-KLVFFA during the l-Aβ incubation prevented this random coil to β-sheet-rich secondary structure transition, maintaining Aβ close to its original conformation, 56% random coil and 44% β-sheet (C of c = 0.92; Fig. 4A). The addition of 10 μml-KLVFFA to the incubation of Aβ1–40 permitted similar structural transitions to those observed when Aβ was incubated alone, which corresponded to 40% β-sheet and 60% α-helix (C of c = 0.98; Fig. 4A). Identical experiments performed using d-Aβ1–40 are presented in Fig. 4B. In this case the CD spectra are mirror images of those produced by l-Aβ1–40. The presence of d-KLVFFA had little effect on the CD spectra of d-Aβ after a 48-h incubation. In contrast, the addition of l-KLVFFA maintained the d-Aβ in a structure similar to that observed before incubation. Comparable results were obtained when similar experiments were performed in TBSA buffer, which contains physiological levels of salt (data not shown). d-Peptide Inhibitors More Potently Reduce Fiber Formation by l-Aβ 1–40—EM was used to determine the effect of the enantiomeric inhibitor peptides on Aβ1–40 fiber formation. l-Aβ1–40 (20 μm) incubated alone (Fig. 5A) or in the presence of 20 μml-KLVFFA (Fig. 5B) formed large fibrillar structures with the characteristic morphology of Aβ amyloid. However, when 20 μmd-KLVFFA was present during the incubation, very few or no fibrillar structures were observed (Fig. 5C). Conversely, when 20 μmd-Aβ1–40 was incubated either alone (Fig. 5D) or in the presence of 20 μmd-KLVFFA (Fig. 5F), numerous densely packed fibrils were observed. In the presence of 20 μml-KLVFFA, d-Aβ1–40 did not form fibrils (Fig. 5E). The d-KLVFFA Inhibitor Peptide Effectively Blocks Aβ Assembly Facilitated by Pathological Chaperones—The effect of the d-KLVFFA inhibitory peptide was tested in an Aβ fibrillogenesis assay in the presence of heparin. This glycosaminoglycan acts as a natural pathological chaperone, facilitating the formation of amyloid fibrils in vitro (30McLaurin J. Franklin T. Zhang X. Deng J. Fraser P.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 1101-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and is believed to play a role in Aβ fibrillogenesis in vivo (13Yang D.S. Serpell L.C. Yip C.M. McLaurin J. Chrishti M.A. Horne P. Boudreau L. Kisilevsky R. Westaway D. Fraser P.E. Amyloid. 2001; 8: 10-19PubMed Google Scholar). In our Aβ assembly assay, heparin increased the ThT fluorescence by 1.8-fold. When the d-KLVFFA peptide was added to the incubations containing both Aβ and heparin, no increase in ThT fluorescence was observed, indicating a complete inhibition of chaperone catalyzed Aβ assembly (Fig. 6). d-Inhibitor Peptides Selectively Protect Against l-Aβ 1–42 and lAβ 1–40 Toxicity in Cell Culture—Aβ1–42 at 12 μm reduced the viability of cultured rat primary cortical neuronal cells to 20 and 29% of that observed in control cells incubated without Aβ1–42 (Fig. 7A). In the presence of 6 or 12 μmd-KKLVFFA, the toxicity of 12 μm Aβ1–42 was significantly attenuated (p < 0.001). The resulting cell viabilities were 91.9% and 123.1% of control cells respectively, with the effect of 12 μm peptide being significantly greater (p < 0.001) than that of 6 μm peptide. In the presence of 6 or 12 μm, of l-KKLVFFA the toxicity of 12 μm Aβ1–42 persisted, and the viability remained similar to that seen without addition of the peptide inhibitors, 29.5% and 29.4% of control cells, respectively. Aβ1–40 at 1 μm reduced viability of SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells to 57.3% of control levels (Fig. 7B). The cell viability in the presence of Aβ1–40 was significantly improved to 75% of control levels (p < 0.001) by the addition of 4 μm D-KKLVFFA, but was not significantly changed, 54%, after the addition of 4 μml-KKLVFFA. Aβ1–40 at 2.5 μm reduced viability to 54.3% of control. This toxicity was prevented by the addition of 10 μmd-KKLVFFA, which resulted in a viability of 75% of control cells (p < 0.001). This was not seen with the addition of 10 μml-KKLVFFA, which resulted in a viability of 52.7%, not different from that seen with 2.5 μm Aβ alone. Full Potency of d-Peptides Requires All d-Amino Acids—We investigated the antifibrillogenic activity of l-KLVFFA after the systematic replacement of each l-residue by its corresponding d-amino acid (Fig. 8A). Each such chiral switch of a single residue resulted in a loss of antifibrillogenic activity except in the case of the N-terminal lysine residue. The greatest losses in activity were observed when the l-amino acids from the central region of the peptide (residues 17 to 20) were substituted. Similarly, all single d- to l-substitutions in d-KLVFFA decreased the potency of the d-enantiomer (Fig. 8B). Again, the greatest loss of potency occurred when the chiral inversion was made at the center of the peptide. d-Peptides Containing the Aβ 16–20 Motif Inhibit Aβ Assembly by Interacting at the Complementary Region of Aβ—Self-recognition of the Aβ16–20 KLVFF motif is believed to take place with the l-enantiomer inhibitor peptides described thus far (17Tjernberg L.O. Lilliehook C. Callaway D.J. Naslund J. Hahne S. Thyberg J. Terenius L. Nordstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12601-12605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 19Ghanta J. Shen C.L. Kiessling L.L. Murphy R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29525-29528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To establish whether this is also the case with the d-enantiomers of peptide inhibitors, a series of overlapping 6 and 7 d-peptides spanning the entire length of Aβ were synthesized and evaluated using the ThT fibrillogenesis assay (Fig. 9). The only peptides found to exhibit inhibitory activity, d-Aβ16–22 and d-Aβ15–20, contained the entire Aβ16–20 sequence. Inhibition of Aβ Assembly by Peptides Containing the KLVFF Aβ-Recognition Motif Is Heterochirally Selective—Protein/protein interactions can be highly stereospecific. For example, the HIV-1 protease cleaves only the naturally occurring l-form of its substrate peptide, thus exhibiting a homochiral specificity. A synthetically prepared d-enantiomer of this HIV-1 protease maintains the homochiral specificity characteristic of the native enzyme, by acting only on the d-form of its substrate (23Milton R.C. Milton S.C. Kent S.B. Science. 1992; 256: 1445-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Analogously, the ribonuclease S-protein specifically binds the l-form, but not the d-form of the S-peptide to form an active complex (31Corigliano-Murphy M.A. Xun L.A. Ponnamperuma C. Dalzoppo D. Fontana A. Kanmera T. Chaiken I.M. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1985; 25: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In other cases, protein/protein interactions exhibit no chiral preference. For example, a synthetic HIV-1 GP41 fusion peptide inhibits HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein mediated-cell fusion both in the d- and l-form indicating that the peptide's chirality is not critical for peptide/peptide interactions (32Pritsker M. Jones P. Blumenthal R. Shai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7287-7292Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Similarly the co-chaperone DnaJ-bound d-peptides and l-peptides with comparable affinities (33Feifel B. Schonfeld H.J. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11999-12002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We show here that inhibitor peptides containing the entire KLVFF Aβ-recognition motif inhibited Aβ assembly with a heterochiral type of stereospecificity. d-Enantiomers of these inhibitor peptides preferentially inhibited the assembly of the natural l-enantiomer of Aβ. Conversely, l-enantiomers of these inhibitor peptides preferentially inhibited the assembly of the synthetic d-enantiomer of Aβ. We have demonstrated this unusual heterochiral specificity in Aβ assembly assays using the amyloid specific dye ThT. We have also observed this specificity in the inhibition of the structural transition of Aβ to β-sheet employing CD and in the inhibition of Aβ fiber formation employing EM. The hetereochiral specificity of the inhibitor peptides was also evident in their biological activity, as the d-peptides more effectively blocked Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in cultured neurons. We have considered alternative explanations for our observations. For instance the possible selective contamination of l-inhibitor peptides by aggregation promoting metal ions such as copper (34Atwood C.S. Scarpa R.C. Huang X. Moir R.D. Jones W.D. Fairlie D.P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1219-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) would cause an apparent reduction in the potency of this enantiomer in our assays. However such a possibility was excluded based on our results showing that the l-peptides had greater potency than the d-peptides, when inhibiting the assembly of d-Aβ1–40. This demonstrated that the lower potency of the l-peptides with l-Aβ1–40, is an inherent characteristic of the interaction, and not attributable to a contaminant. We have considered the possibility that when an inhibitor peptide of opposite chirality is combined with Aβ the resulting solution fails to develop a β-sheet-type spectra because of spectral subtraction rather than because of inhibition of a change in Aβ structure. We do not believe this to be the case here, because we observe a spectrum for the solution of Aβ and inhibitor which exhibits a negative minimum at around 197 nm characteristic of high random coil content. If in the mixture of Aβ and inhibitor of opposite chirality both had converted to a high β-sheet secondary structure, the resulting CD spectra would instead have cancelled each other out, at all wavelengths, producing a flat spectrum at zero mdeg. If the spectral cancellation were not complete, we would have expected some residual positive or negative signal at the 218 nm, characteristic of β-sheet. The results we observe are more consistent with the peptide inhibitors causing a true inhibition of the conversion of Aβ to a high β-structure form. The Aβ 16–20 Region Is the Site of d-Peptide Inhibitor Interaction with Aβ—A previous study reported that peptides containing the KLVFF Aβ-recognition motif interact with Aβ through the homologous primary sequence, in a homochiral-specific manner, when studied using a direct binding assay (17Tjernberg L.O. Lilliehook C. Callaway D.J. Naslund J. Hahne S. Thyberg J. Terenius L. Nordstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12601-12605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In view of this report we questioned whether the d-peptide inhibitors function by interacting with Aβ through this site. To establish whether this indeed was the case, we prepared and tested a series of 20 overlapping 6- and 7-mer d-peptides corresponding to the sequence of Aβ beginning at the N-terminus. From the ThT assay results it was clear that only peptides incorporating the KLVFF motif, namely Aβ15–20 and Aβ16–22, possessed antifibrillogenic activity. This suggests that the d-peptide inhibitors do indeed interact with Aβ via the KLVFF motif, just as do the l-peptides. It remains unclear why a homochiral stereospecificity was observed for the direct binding of Aβ to immobilized peptides containing the KLVFF motif (17Tjernberg L.O. Lilliehook C. Callaway D.J. Naslund J. Hahne S. Thyberg J. Terenius L. Nordstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12601-12605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) while a heterochiral stereospecificity was observed for the antifibrillogenic activity of the inhibitor peptides described in the present report. The replacement of amino acids by their enantiomers causes a local change of secondary structure (35Janek K. Rothemund S. Gast K. Beyermann M. Zipper J. Fabian H. Bienert M. Krause E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5457-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) which we observed resulted in a loss of inhibitor potency (Fig. 8). It is possible that the solid phase attachment of the d-peptide (17Tjernberg L.O. Lilliehook C. Callaway D.J. Naslund J. Hahne S. Thyberg J. Terenius L. Nordstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12601-12605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) in a similar manner restricted its conformation to ones that do not interact with Aβ. d-KLVFFA Inhibits Aβ Assembly Promoted by a Pathological Chaperone—Certain non-Aβ components that are associated with AD plaques promote Aβ assembly and are therefore referred to as “pathological chaperones” (36Wisniewski T. Frangione B. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 135: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 37Ma J. Yee A. Brewer Jr., H.B. Das S. Potter H. Nature. 1994; 372: 92-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Glycosaminoglycans are important examples of such pathological chaperones that induces both β-sheet structure and amyloid fibrils in Aβ (30McLaurin J. Franklin T. Zhang X. Deng J. Fraser P.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 1101-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). For an inhibitor to function effectively in vivo, inhibition of chaperone-mediated fibrillogenesis would be a requirement. d-KLVFFA, when added to incubations promoted by heparin, completely inhibited fibrillogenesis, clearly demonstrating that not only does this peptide inhibit Aβ assembly, it is also effective when a chaperone plays a catalytic role in the process. Further testing would be required to determine whether this inhibitor peptide is active with other pathological chaperones as well. d-Enantiomer Inhibitor Peptides are More Potent Than Are l-Forms at Countering Aβ Neurotoxicity—We found that the d-enantiomer of KKLVFFA was more potent than the l-form in preventing the neurotoxicity of Aβ in vitro. This neuroprotective activity is consistent with the prevention of Aβ assembly by this inhibitor peptide. As the toxicity of Aβ has been shown to require some type of supramolecular assembly, the ability of d-peptides to prevent such intermolecular interactions by Aβ understandably leads to neuroprotection in cell culture experiments. This effect was demonstrable with Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42, the two forms of Aβ prominently found in AD. The greater neuroprotective effect of the d-enantiomer was evident both in primary culture of rat neurons and in cultures of neuroblastomal cells. Although the l-enantiomer failed to exhibit neuroprotective effects under the conditions tested here, a higher concentration could have proven effective. This is suggested by the ability of higher concentrations of the l-inhibitors to prevent the ThT fluorescence of l-Aβ. Indeed, previous studies have reported modulation of Aβ toxicity by l-enantiomeric derivatives containing the KLVFF motif (38Lowe T.L. Strzelec A. Kiessling L.L. Murphy R.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7882-7889Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Showing that d-peptides are more potent than their l-counterparts at reducing Aβ toxicity indicates that they could constitute useful drug leads for therapeutic interaction in AD. We thank Dr. H. Vali (McGill University, Montreal, Canada) for his help with the EM studies and Stéphanie Bastien for her technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2078230814,"The relativistic plasma flows onto neutron stars that are accreting material from stellar companions can be used to probe strong-field gravity as well as the physical conditions in the supra-nuclear-density interiors of neutron stars. Plasma inhomogeneities orbiting a few kilometres above the stars are observable as X-ray brightness fluctuations on the millisecond dynamical timescale of the flows. Two frequencies in the kilohertz range dominate these fluctuations: the twin kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs). Competing models for the origins of these oscillations (based on orbital motions) all predict that they should be related to the stellar spin frequency, but tests have been difficult because the spins were not unambiguously known. Here we report the detection of kHz QPOs from a pulsar whose spin frequency is known. Our measurements establish a clear link between kHz QPOs and stellar spin, but one not predicted by any current model. A new approach to understanding kHz QPOs is now required. We suggest that a resonance between the spin and general relativistic orbital and epicyclic frequencies could provide the observed relation between QPOs and spin."
https://openalex.org/W2090741482,"The mechanism of senescence-associated cytoplasmic induction of p-Erk1/2 (SA-p-Erk1/2) proteins in human diploid fibroblasts was investigated. p-Erk1/2 proteins were efficiently dephosphorylated in vitro by protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (PP1/2A) and MAPK phosphatase 3 (MKP3). Specific activity of PP1/2A and MKP3 activity significantly decreased during cellular senescence, whereas their protein expression levels did not. To investigate possible mechanism of phosphatase inactivation, we measured reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis and found it was much higher in mid-old cells than the young cells. Treating the young cells once with 1 mm H2O2 remarkably induced p-Erk1/2 expression; however, it was transient unless repeatedly treated until 72 h. Multiple treatment of the cells with 0.2 mm H2O2 significantly duplicated inactivation of PP1/2A; however, thiol-specific reagents could reverse the PP1/2A activities, suggesting the oxidation of cysteine molecule in PP1/2A by the increased ROS. When the cells were pretreated with 10 mm N-acetyl-l-cysteine for 1 h, Erk1/2 activation was completely blocked. To elucidate which cysteine residue and/or metal ion in PP1/2A was modified by H2O2, electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry analyses were performed with purified PP1C-α and found Cys62-SO3H and Cys105-SO3H, implicating the tertiary structure perturbation. H2O2 inhibited purified PP1C-α activity by both oxidation of Cys residues and metal ion(s), evidenced by dithiothreitol and ascorbate-restoration assay. In summary, SA-p-Erk1/2 was most likely due to the oxidation of PP1/2A, which resulted from the continuous exposure of the cells to vast amounts of ROS generated during cellular senescence by oxidation of Cys62 and Cys105 in PP1C-α and metal ion(s). The mechanism of senescence-associated cytoplasmic induction of p-Erk1/2 (SA-p-Erk1/2) proteins in human diploid fibroblasts was investigated. p-Erk1/2 proteins were efficiently dephosphorylated in vitro by protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (PP1/2A) and MAPK phosphatase 3 (MKP3). Specific activity of PP1/2A and MKP3 activity significantly decreased during cellular senescence, whereas their protein expression levels did not. To investigate possible mechanism of phosphatase inactivation, we measured reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis and found it was much higher in mid-old cells than the young cells. Treating the young cells once with 1 mm H2O2 remarkably induced p-Erk1/2 expression; however, it was transient unless repeatedly treated until 72 h. Multiple treatment of the cells with 0.2 mm H2O2 significantly duplicated inactivation of PP1/2A; however, thiol-specific reagents could reverse the PP1/2A activities, suggesting the oxidation of cysteine molecule in PP1/2A by the increased ROS.

Decreased growth rate, limited cell division, flat and large cell shapes, and tight binding of the cells to culture dished (1Macieira-Coelho A. Loria E. Berumen L. Adv. Exp. Med.

Ha-Ras mutants that interact preferentially with specific Ras effector proteins are known as V12S35, V12C40, and V12G37 (7White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M.

Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). A distinctive feature of the cellular senescence induced by overexpression of the Ha-ras mutants as well as the replicative senescence in normal human diploid fibroblasts (HDF) is the markedly increased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (p-Erk1/2) without nuclear translocation (10Lim I.K. Hong K.W. Kwak I.H. Yoon G. Park S.C. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2000; 119: 113-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, its biochemical mechanism has not yet been clarified. MAPK activity is tightly regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The activation of the MAPK activity requires the dual phosphorylation of the Ser/Thr and Tyr residues in the T X Y kinase activation motif (11Ahn N.G. Seger R. Bratlien R.L. Diltz C.D. Tonks N.K.

The dual phosphatases are capable of catalyzing the removal of the phosphoryl group from Tyr(P) as well as Ser(P)/Thr(P) residues. The dual specificity phosphatases that specifically dephosphorylate and inactivate the p-Erk1/2 are called MAPK phosphatases (MKPs), and at least 9 mammalian MKPs have been identified so far (18Keyse S.M.

An elegant series of studies have shown that the N-terminal domain of MKP3 can physically associate with Erk1/2 (24Muda M. Theodosiou A. Gillieron C. Smith A. Chabert C. Camps M. Boschert U. Rodrigues N. Davis K. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9323-9329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and this association can activate phosphatase activity of MKP3 present in the C-terminal domain (25Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Moreover, the C-terminal domain of MKP3 is significantly homologous to VHR, one of the MKPs (26Todd J.L. Tanner K.G. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13271-13280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and Erk1/2 proteins are efficient substrates for VHR. MKP3 dual specificity phosphatase is not related to the Ser/Thr protein phosphatases but belongs to the PTP superfamily. There is increasing evidence that relatively few Ser- or Thr-specific protein phosphatases with pleiotropic action participate in cellular regulation. Four major classes of protein phosphatase, type 1 (PP1), type 2A (PP2A), type 2B (PP2B or calcineurin), and type 2C (PP2C), have been identified in mammalian cells (27Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar, 28Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). PP1 occurs in three isoforms (α, β/δ, and γ1) and contains a catalytic subunit (PP1C), regulatory subunit (inhibitor 2), a G subunit, and an M subunit. PP1C binds to two cytosolic thermostable proteins, termed inhibitor-1 (I-1) and inhibitor-2 (I-2), which completely abolish its activity at nanomolar concentrations (29Nimmo G.A. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 87: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The I-1 tightly binds to PP1 both in vitro and in vivo and requires phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase to be inhibitory of a number of phosphoproteins (30Huang F.L. Glinsmann W.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 70: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 31Vulsteke V. Beullens M. Waelkens E. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 157-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation of I-2 at Thr72 by glycogen synthase kinase leads to activation of the enzyme (33Hemmings B.A. Resinkm T J. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1982; 150: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 34DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12144-12152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PP2A is a heterotrimeric enzyme consisting of a 36-kDa catalytic subunit (C), 65-kDa structural subunit (A), and a variable regulatory subunit (B). PP2A is unaffected by the above inhibitors but highly effectively inhibited by low concentrations of okadaic acid (27Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar, 35Wara S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 36Takai A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1988; 9: 563-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). PP2A is active toward most substrates in the absence of divalent cation, whereas PP2B and PP2C have absolute requirements for Ca2+ and Mg2+, respectively (27Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar). There are numerous reports that cellular redox status plays an important role in the mechanisms to regulate the function of growth factors and tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent signal transduction pathways (37Monteiro H.P. Stern A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 38Flohe L. Brigelius-Flohe R. Saliou C. Traber M.G. Packer L. Free Radic. Biol.

Surgery. 1996; 120: 150-158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, ROS such as H2O2 have been shown to be involved in growth factor signaling pathway (43Rao G.N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 713-719PubMed Google Scholar, 44Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar), perhaps as a second messenger. Therefore, PTP appears to be a logical target of H2O2, leading to transient and reversible inactivation of phosphatase activity by oxidizing catalytic cysteine residue to sulfenic acid (45Denu J.M. Tanner K.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). It has been reported that low levels of H2O2 (200 μm) robustly activate Erk1/2 (26Todd J.L. Tanner K.G.

Very recently, a paper (50Genoux D. Haditsch U. Knobloch M. Michalon A. Storm D. Mansuy I.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 970-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) with great relevance to our work has suggested that the PP1 is a molecular constraint on learning and memory and a potential mediator of cognitive decline during aging. It has been shown with tet-O-inhibitor-1 transgenic mice model that the transgene was expressed in the hippocampus and cortex of the mice brain. Because these tissues have been implicated in the memory process, the above observation offers a great credence to the physiological relevance of the PP1-dependent mechanism of forgetting, particularly in aging-related memory decline (51Gallagher M. Rapp P.R. Annu. Rev. Psychol. 1997; 48: 339-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Therefore, in order to investigate the mechanism of SA-p-Erk1/2, enzymatic activities of PP1/2A and MKP3 together with their protein expression levels were evaluated during cellular senescence. Furthermore, the difference of ROS generation between the young and old cells and the effects of ROS on PP1/2A and MKP3 were also elucidated using primary culture of the young, mid-old, and old HDF cells. HDF Cell Cultures—The primary culture of normal HDF was isolated from the foreskin of a 4-year-old boy by the method described previously (10Lim I.K. Hong K.W. Kwak I.H. Yoon G. Park S.C. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2000; 119: 113-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and Ha-ras double mutants (V12S35,V12G37, and V12C40) overexpressing HDF cell lines were also prepared in our laboratory by retrovirus infection (10Lim I.K. Hong K.W. Kwak I.H. Yoon G. Park S.C. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2000; 119: 113-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). HDF cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, catalog number 31600-034) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator. Ha-ras-infected HDF cells were cultured in the media containing hygromycin B (100 μg/ml) during the entire experiment. Confluent cells were transferred to a new dish, and the numbers of population doublings as well as the doubling time were continuously counted. Young, mid-old, and old cells used in the present experiments were defined as the HDF with a doubling time of around 24 h, 10–12 days, and over 2 weeks, respectively. p-Erk1/2 Immunocytochemistry—HDF cells were cultured on a cover glass and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. After washing the monolayer with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.15% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and then blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-p-Erk1/2 antibody (catalog number 9101, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), diluted (1:200) in 2% bovine serum albumin solution, followed by washing with PBS, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) was applied for1hat room temperature. After washing with PBS, the cover glass was mounted with Mowiol mounting medium (Hoechst Celanese, Charlotte, NC) containing antifade agent 1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane (Aldrich). Immunoblot Analyses of Mono- and Di-phosphorylated Erk1/2 Proteins—Young and old HDF cells were solubilized with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin), and 40 μg of cell lysates were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE in 25 mm Tris-glycine buffer. After transferring protein bands to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (catalog number 162-0177, Bio-Rad) at 150 mA for 1 h and 40 min, anti-p-Erk1/2 antibody was applied overnight at 4 °C. For the loading control, anti-α-tubulin (Oncogene catalog number CP06, Boston), anti-Erk1/2 (Cell Signaling catalog number 9102, Beverly, MA), or anti-actin (Sigma, catalog number A-5060) antibodies were used. ECL kit was employed to visualize protein expression levels. In order to elucidate whether the anti-p-Erk1/2 antibody used in our experiments detects both monophosphorylated and dual phosphorylated Erk1/2 proteins or not, purified PP1 (Sigma, catalog number P7937) and PP2A (Calbiochem, catalog number 539508) enzymes were applied to the activated Erk1 (p-Erk1, Stratagene, catalog number 206110) and cell lysates, respectively, and then repeated immunoblot analyses were performed using anti-Thr(P) (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, catalog number 13-9200), anti-Tyr(P) antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., catalog number 05-321) as well as anti-p-Erk1/2 and anti-Erk1/2 antibodies. When investigating the fraction levels of p-Erk1/2 regulated by PP2A in vivo, young and old HDF cells, which were maintained in the serum-free media for 24 h, were treated with 40 nm okadaic acid, a specific inhibitor for PP2A, and the cells were harvested every 4 h until 12 h for immunoblot analysis with anti-p-Erk1/2 antibody. Alkaline Phosphatase Assay—pNPP tablet set (N-1891, Sigma FAST™) purchased from Sigma was used for alkaline phosphatase assay. Each pNPP and Tris Buffer tablets were dissolved in 5 ml of distilled water and used as substrate. Three hundred and fifty μl of a reaction mixture containing 200 μl of the substrate and 150 μl of cell lysate (100 μg), which was prepared in 1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin, was incubated in the dark for2hat room temperature, and the reaction was stopped by cooling down in ice. Absorbance at 405 nm was read, and phosphatase activity was calculated from the standard curve prepared with p-nitrophenol. Protein Phosphatases 1 and 2A Assay—To determine the activity of PP1/2A, cells were washed twice with phosphate-free medium and lysed with a buffer solution, containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, by sonication (Sonic Dismembrator 550, Fisher) twice at level 2 for 10 s. The whole cell lysates were centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was used for the enzyme assay. To separate cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, whole cell lysates were prepared with STM (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm Mg2+) buffer using a Dounce homogenizer, and the lysate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was denoted as the cytoplasmic fraction, and the pellet was resuspended in STM buffer after rinsing the pellet twice. Nuclear fraction was prepared by sonicating the above pellet and centrifuging at 11,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was used as a nuclear fraction. Malachite Green Assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) was mixed with Thr(P) peptide (KRpTIRR (catalog number 12-219) purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., as a substrate. An assay mixture (25 μl) containing 250 μm substrate and 2 μg of the above subcellular fractions was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min, and the reaction was stopped with 100 μl of malachite green phosphate detection solution. The assay mixture was left for another 15 min at room temperature for color development. In order to eliminate phosphate contamination arising from the cell extracts and the reagents, an assay mixture without the substrate or reagent was run for each measurement. Absorbance at 630 nm was read using microplate reader (Benchmark, Bio-Rad). Phosphate released by the enzyme reaction was determined from the standard curve prepared with 0.1 mm KH2PO4 solution. Restoration of Protein Phosphatases 1 and 2A Activity by Thiolspecific Reagents—To investigate the role of ROS played in a significantly reduced PP1/2A activity during cellular senescence, young HDF cells were pretreated once with 1 mm H2O2; since the PP1/2A activity in the mid-old cells had been reduced, most likely due to accumulated H2O2, these cells were not pretreated with H2O2. The cells were washed with phosphate-free medium within 10 min, and the cell lysates were then prepared according to the method described above. To examine whether the H2O2 oxidized the active site cysteine residue in PP1/2A or not, DTT (1 mm), β-mercaptoethanol (0.1%), or NAC (10 mm) was individually added to the young and mid-old cell lysates before the PP1/2A assay. All of the experiments with young and mid-old HDF cells were repeated 3 times. All the thiol reagents were purchased from Sigma. Preparation of MKP3 Antibody—Recombinant MKP3 protein was expressed in the BL21 cells using pGEX4T3-GST-MKP3 cDNA (originally isolated by Muda et al. (20Muda M. Boschert U. Dickinson R.

MKP3 protein (500 μg) mixed with an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant (F-5881, Sigma) was injected subcutaneously into back, footpad, and thigh of New Zealand White rabbits. In 3 weeks, the first booster injection was done with MKP3 protein (500 μg) mixed with equal volume of incomplete Freund's adjuvant (F-5506, Sigma), and the rabbits were sacrificed 1 week after the second booster injected similarly to the first. Whole serum was then obtained, and IgG was purified by incubating the serum with protein A-agarose beads (Invitrogen, catalog number 15920-010). MKP3 Immunoprecipitation-Phosphatase (IP-phosphatase) Assay— IP with anti-MKP3 IgG was performed with young and old HDF cell lysates (300 μg) in a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 1% Triton X-100, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin by the standard method. MKP3-IP-phosphatase assay mixture (200 μl) containing the above MKP3 immunoprecipitates and 50 mm pNPP in 50 mm succinate buffer (pH 7.0) was incubated at 30 °C for 10 h, and the phosphate released was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (E max, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at 405 nm. As a control blank, heat-inactivated cell lysate and reagent were also run for each assay. When comparing the amount of p-Erk1/2 proteins sequestered by MKP3 in young and old HDF cells, whole cell lysates, MKP3 immunoprecipitates, and the IP supernatants after MKP3-IP were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblot analysis was performed against p-Erk1/2 antibody. Measurement of ROS by FACS Analysis—H2O2 generation during cellular senescence was measured by FACS analysis using 50 μm 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2-DCFDA, D-399, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in cell culture system. Young and mid-old HDF cells (old cells were too large to analyze by FACS) were plated in a 60-mm culture dish with 25 and 70% confluence, respectively. The next day, media were changed, and the cells were incubated in complete medium for another 24 h. The cells were then pretreated with 10 mm NAC (Sigma, catalog number A-7250) for 1 h, and H2-DCFDA was added 10 min prior to cell harvest. ROS generation was determined with FACScan (BD Biosciences) by measuring the fluorescence of DCF arising from the oxidation of H2-DCFDA. ESI-MS/MS Analysis—Nano-ESI on a Q-TOF2 mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) was used for sequence analysis of Cys62 and Cys105 containing peptides after in-gel trypsin digestion (overnight at 37 °C). Data were collected for positive ions at m/z 400–2000. For sequence analysis of peptide, once the parent ions"

Targeting of Pax4 expression to the islet lineage in the fetal pancreas depends on a short sequence located ∼2 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site of the PAX4 gene. This short sequence contains binding sites for homeodomain transcription factors PDX1 and hepatic nuclear factor (HNF)1, nuclear receptor HNF4α, and basic helix-loop-helix factor Neurogenin3. In the current study we demonstrate that the HNF1α and Neurogenin3 binding sites are critical for activity of the region through synergy between the two proteins. Synergy involves a physical interaction between the factors and requires the activation domains of both factors. Furthermore, exogenous expression of Neurogenin3 is sufficient to induce expression of the endogenous pax4 gene in the mouse pancreatic ductal cell line mPAC, which already expresses HNF1α, whereas expression of both Neurogenin3 and HNF1α are necessary to activate the pax4 gene in the fibroblast cell line NIH3T3. These data demonstrate how Neurogenin3 and HNF1α activate the pax4 gene during the cascade of gene expression events that control pancreatic endocrine cell development.

The mammalian endocrine pancreas consists of four different cell types, α, β, δ, and PP cells, expressing glucagon, insulin, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide, respectively. During fetal development, the process that guides pancreatic precursor cells to form each of the distinct endocrine cell types involves the sequential expression of a number of pancreatic transcription factors, including Nkx2.2, Nkx6.1, Pdx1, NeuroD1, Neurogenin3, Pax4, and Pax6 (for review see Refs. 1Edlund H.

Neurogenin3 is expressed early in endocrine progenitor cells in the fetal pancreas but not in mature endocrine cells (11Schwitzgebel V.M. Scheel D.W. Conners J.R. Kalamaras J. Lee J.E. Anderson D.J.

Targeted disruption of the neurogenin3 gene in mice results in the total agenesis of endocrine cells (10Gradwohl G. Dierich A. LeMeur M. Guillemot F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The preponderance of α cells suggests that additional factors are important for diverting endocrine precursor cells from the α cell fate to the alternate endocrine lineages. One such factor may be the paired homeodomain transcription factor, Pax4. Mice homozygous for a targeted disruption of the pax4 gene develop α cells but few β or δ cells, demonstrating its role in endocrine cell type differentiation (7Sosa-Pineda B. Chowdhury K. Torres M. Oliver G. Gruss P. Nature. 1997; 386: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Like Neurogenin3, Pax4 expression in the pancreas crests during the period of peak β-cell differentiation in the fetus and is absent from mature islets, demonstrating that it functions only during the development of the endocrine cells (15Smith S.B. Ee H.C. Conners J.R. German M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8272-8280Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Investigation of the mechanisms that control Pax4 expression has provided insight into the factors that lie upstream of Pax4 in the pathway for differentiation of insulin-producing β cells. A previous study of the human PAX4 gene promoter identified a 50-bp region (that is highly conserved in the mouse promoter) (16Xu W. Murphy L.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 170: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) located between –1910 and –1960 bp relative to the transcription start site that is critical for promoter activity (16Xu W.

Removal of this region ablated promoter activity in transgenic mice, and two copies of the region activated the heterologous HSV-TK promoter 12-fold in β cells (18Smith S.B. Watada H. Scheel D.W.

The 50-bp sequence contains several transcription factor binding motifs, including an E box capable of binding bHLH family members such as Neurogenin3 along with sites capable of binding factors including hepatic nuclear factor (HNF) 1The abbreviations used are: HNF, hepatic nuclear factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; HSV-TK, herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase.1The abbreviations used are: HNF, hepatic nuclear factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; HSV-TK, herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase. 1α, HNF4α, and Pdx1. In the current study we investigated the role of the human PAX4 promoter binding factors in controlling PAX4 gene expression. Mutation of the binding sites in the promoter demonstrated that the most influential promoter elements are the HNF1α binding site and the E box. In co-transfection experiments, a combination of HNF1α and Neurogenin3 strongly activates the promoter, but neither factor can activate alone. The activation domains of both factors are necessary for this synergy, and the two proteins physically interact. Neurogenin3 alone is sufficient to induce the endogenous mouse pax4 gene expression in a mouse pancreatic ductal cell line, which may be attributed to endogenous expression of HNF1α in these cells. Remarkably, the combination of Neurogenin3 and HNF1α can stimulate transcription of the endogenous pax4 gene in the non-pancreatic mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3. Cell Culture and Transfection—βTC-3 and α TC1.6 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum and 15% horse serum. NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were split into 6-well plates 24 h prior to transfection with 1 × 106 cells/well for α TC1.6 and βTC3 cells and 5 × 104 cells/well for NIH3T3 cells. 2 μg of reporter construct was used per well; 50 ng of any co-transfected transcription factor cDNA was used per well. The cationic lipid Transfast (Promega) was used for all transfections according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase assays were performed with the Promega luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was corrected for protein concentration. Construction and Purification of Recombinant Adenoviruses—Mouse neurogenin3 cDNA was cloned into the pShuttle vector and a recombinant adenovirus was constructed using the Adeno-X™ expression system (Clontech). A control adenovirus containing the bacterial β-galactosidase gene was a generous gift from Dr. C. Newgard (Duke University, Durham, NC). Adenoviruses were produced, purified, and desalted through a Sephadex G-25 column as described previously (19Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B.

Viral Infection—mPAC (clones L20 and L4S2) and NIH3T3 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 5 × 105 (mPAC) or 5 × 104 (NIH3T3) cells/well and treated the next day at a multiplicity of infection of 10 viral particles/cell with AdCMV-Bgal or AdCMV-Neurogenin3 at 37 °C for 2 h. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in fresh medium for 48 h prior to harvesting. Adenovirus-assisted transfection of NIH3T3 cells was carried out as previously described (21Sander M. Griffen S.C. Huang J. German M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11572-11577Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmid DNA (4 μg) was mixed with 4 μg of 25-kDa polyethylenimine (PEI; Aldrich) in Opti-MEM 1 serum-free medium (Invitrogen) and then combined with the AdCMV-Bgal or Ad-CMV-Neurogenin3 adenovirus. The DNA/PEI/adenovirus mixture was then added to the cells and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h prior to washing with phosphate-buffered saline and culturing in fresh medium. RT-PCR—48 h after virus infection, cells were collected and total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA samples were treated with DNase to remove contamination of genomic DNA. First-strand cDNA was prepared using 3 μg of total RNA, using the Superscript II RT kit and random hexamer primers (Invitrogen) in a total volume of 20 μl according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1 μlofthe cDNA product was used as a template for PCR reactions under the following conditions: an initial incubation at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 25 cycles (Neurogenin3/β-actin) or 35 cycles (HNF1α/Pax4) of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Primer sets were as follows: mouse Pax 4 forward GTGTTGGCTCCAGTTCTTCC and reverse AACCAAACCCTCACCGTGTC; neurogenin3 forward CGCACCATGGCGCCTCATCCCTTGG and reverse CAGAGGATCCTCTTCACAAGAAGTCTGAG; HNF-1α forward GACCTGACCGAGTTGCCTAATG and reverse CCTTGCTGGGGTTTTTTTGC; and β-actin forward TGAGAGGGAAATCGTGCGTG and reverse TGCTTGCTGATCCACATCTGC. PCR samples were analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized under UV light. TaqMan Assay—TaqMan assay was used for quantification of pax4 mRNA levels in infected NIH3T3 cells. First-strand cDNA was generated as described above. PCR amplification of Pax4 and β-actin (as endogenous control) was carried out in separate tubes using 1 μl of cDNA in a PCR mix containing AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (0.75 unit) and buffer (PE Biosystems, TaqMan PCR core reagent kit N808–0228), AmpErase uracyl N-glycosilase (0.5 unit), dUTP (400 um), dNTP (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, 200 μm each), and 5.5 mm MgCl2. The following primers and TaqMan probes were used: Pax4 forward CATCCCAGGCCTATCTCCAAC, reverse CCACATATGAGGAGGAAGCCAC, TaqMan probe TACTGGGACTGCCAATCCCTCCTTCC; β-actin forward CCGGGACCTGACAGACTACCT, reverse GATTTCCCTCTCAGCTGTGGTG, TaqMan probe TCCTGACCGAGCGTGGCTACAGC. TaqMan probes were used at a concentration of 500 nm and PCR primers were used at a concentration of 100 nm in a 50-ul reaction volume. PCR reactions were run in an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system under the following conditions: 50 °C 2 min, 95 °C 10 min, and then 40 cycles 95 °C 15 s, 60 °C 1 min. Data were analyzed using the comparative CT method (Δ Δ CT) as described in the manufacturer's manual (PE Applied Biosystems). Efficiencies of Pax4 and β-actin amplifications were found to be equal in preliminary validation experiments. In Vitro Protein-Protein Interaction Assay—Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21 competent cells via the pPIG plasmid system (22Ohneda K. Mirmira R.G. Wang J. Johnson J.D. German M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 900-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In vitro translated and [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were prepared using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 15 μl of labeled protein were mixed with 1 μg of GST fusion protein bound to 20 μl of glutathione-agarose beads in a total volume of 600 μl of interaction buffer (40 mm HEPES (pH7.5), 50 mm KCL, 5mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40). Samples were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking, and the beads were then washed three times with interaction buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with 25 μl of Laemmli buffer. 15-μl aliquots of the eluted proteins were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, dried by heat and vacuumed and autoradiographed. Plasmid Construction—Deletion mutants of Neurogenin3 and HNF1α were generated by PCR and cloned into BglII and BamHI sites of the eukaryotic expression vector pBat12 (15Smith S.B. Ee H.C. Conners J.R. German M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8272-8280Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) or PCDNA3 (Invitrogen), both of which express the inserted cDNA under the control of the CMV promoter. Mutational Analysis of the PAX4 Promoter—A previous study demonstrated the importance of a 50-bp region within the pax4 promoter for transcriptional activity of the entire promoter, both in transgenic animals and in pancreatic cell lines (18Smith S.B. Watada H. Scheel D.W. Mrejen C. German M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36910-36919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, two tandem copies of the region increased activity of a heterologous promoter 12-fold in the pancreatic β-cell line βTC3 but not in the NIH3T3 fibroblast line, thus exhibiting the same cell specificity as the native promoter. We set out to determine which transcription factor binding motifs within this region were most critical for promoter activity by introducing mutations into the promoter sequences previously shown to bind HNF4α, HNF1α, and pancreatic bHLH factors (E-box sequence). The resulting constructs were transfected into βTC3 cells, and their relative transcriptional activities were determined (Fig. 1). Mutations in either the E box or the HNF1α binding motif ablated the activity of the 50-bp minienhancer when linked to the heterologous HSV-TK promoter, whereas a mutation in the HNF4α site resulted in a less dramatic reduction in promoter activity of ∼50% (Fig. 1). All the constructs tested showed no significant activity above background in either the pancreatic α-cell line αTC1.6 or NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). Cooperativity between HNF1α and Neurogenin3—To compare the relative importance of the pancreatic transcription factors that bind to the critical elements within the minienhancer, NIH3T3 cells were co-transfected with the minienhancer HSV-TK reporter construct and CMV promoter-driven expression plasmids containing cDNAs encoding the transcription factors (Fig. 2). Because the previous study demonstrated that no individual transcription factor was sufficient to activate the heterologous promoter in NIH3T3 cells (18Smith S.B. Watada H. Scheel D.W. Mrejen C. German M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36910-36919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we transfected combinations of the pancreatic transcription factors. HNF1α and the bHLH dimer composed of Neurogenin3 and its ubiquitous partner E47 cooperated in activating the minienhancer; the combination of the two activated the minienhancer to a level more than 20-fold over basal activity. No further increase was produced by the inclusion of other pancreatic transcription factors, including HNF4α and PDX1, neither of which activated the heterologous promoter in any combination with other factors (data not shown). HNF1β, often a heterodimeric partner for HNF1α, was also able to synergize with Neurogenin3/E47, although to a lesser extent than HNF1α (Fig. 2a). The inclusion of both HNF1α and HNF1β gave no greater synergy with Neurogenin3/E47 than HNF1α alone. Similarly, substituting the bHLH proteins NeuroD1 or MyoD for Neurogenin3 resulted in decreased levels of synergy, whereas the bHLH protein Meso1 produced no synergy at all (Fig. 2b). Decreased Synergy in Pancreatic Cell Lines—Synergy was tested further in pancreatic cell lines α TC1.6 and βTC3. In α TC1.6 cells, both Neurogenin3/E47 and HNF1α activated the PAX4 minienhancer ∼1.5-fold; the combination of both factors only activated to a level marginally greater than the sum of the activation produced by each factor alone (Fig. 3a). In βTC3 cells, expression of Neurogenin3/E47 alone was sufficient to induce activation of the minienhancer (∼7-fold), but the addition of HNF1α produced no further activation (Fig. 3a). We hypothesized that the marked effect of Neurogenin3/E47 alone might be due to cooperation with endogenous HNF1α, which is present in α TC1.6 and βTC3 cells but not in 3T3 cells (Fig. 3b). To test this hypothesis, we co-transfected a plasmid expressing a dominant negative form of HNF1α (T547E548fsdelTG/ter) (23Vaxillaire M. Abderrahmani A. Boutin P. Bailleul B. Froguel P. Yaniv M. Pontoglio M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35639-35646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) along with the Neurogenin3/E47 expression plasmids into βTC3 cells. Addition of the plasmid expressing the dominant negative HNF1α mutant eliminated the stimulatory effect of Neurogenin3/E47. Synergy Requires Activation Domains of Both Factors—To map regions of HNF1α and Neurogenin3 required for their synergistic interaction, cDNAs encoding truncated variants of both proteins were engineered and co-transfected as shown into NIH3T3 cells along with the minienhancer reporter construct (Fig. 4a). The carboxyl-terminal proximal region of Neurogenin3, which contains a transcriptional activation domain, is required for synergy, whereas the amino-terminal region is not. HNF1α contains three separate activation domains, all of which are located on the carboxyl-terminal side of the basic helix-loop-helix motif (24Soutoglou E. Papafotiou G. Katrakili N. Talianidis I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12515-12520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Deletion of activation domain II (construct Δ 288–317) appears to have had no effect on synergy (Fig. 4b), but the removal of activation domains I (construct 1–485) or III (construct Δ 288–496) diminished the ability of HNF1α to synergize with wild type Neurogenin3/E47. In addition, the HNF1 dimerization domain, amino acids 1–33, which is required for forming HNF1-HNF1 dimers, is also important for producing full synergistic activation. To determine whether the synergy between Neurogenin3/E47 and HNF1α is associated with a physical interaction between the two factors, we tested the ability of the two proteins to interact in vitro. A chimeric protein consisting of the bHLH domain and carboxyl terminus of Neurogenin3 fused to GST was mixed with 35S-labeled HNF1α. The GST-Neurogenin3 fusion protein was able to bring down the labeled HNF1α protein, whereas the GST protein alone could not, demonstrating that the two transcription factors can physically interact in vitro. Synergistic Activation of the Endogenous pax4 Gene—The human PAX4 minienhancer experiments demonstrate that Neurogenin3/E47 and HNF1α can synergize in an artificial system, but we next asked whether such an interaction could activate the endogenous mouse pax4 gene. Mouse pancreatic ductal cell lines (mPAC L4S2 and mPAC L20) and NIH3T3 cells were infected with an adenovirus expressing Neurogenin3 under the control of the CMV promoter. In both mPAC cell lines, which already express high levels of HNF1α, Neurogenin3 expression alone was sufficient to induce transcription of the endogenous pax4 gene as gauged by RT-PCR (Fig. 5a). In NIH3T3 cells, however, HNF1α was needed in addition to Neurogenin3 to significantly induce expression of the native pax4 gene (Fig. 5b). The current study demonstrates that the function of the critical –1910-bp element of the PAX4 gene promoter depends on two sites, a bHLH binding site (E box) and an HNF1α binding site. The pancreatic transcription factors Neurogenin3 (along with its heterodimeric partner E47) and HNF1 bind to these sites, physically interact, and synergistically activate both the promoter and the endogenous pax4 gene. As has been observed for many other transcription factor interactions (25Antes T.J. Levy-Wilson B. DNA Cell Biol. 2001; 20: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 26Lechner J. Welte T.

Sharma S. Johnson T. Kamps M. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7091-7097Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), we demonstrated a physical interaction between the two proteins and showed that the activation domains of both proteins were required for synergy. Therefore, cooperativity between HNF1α and Neurogenin3 may result from the cooperative recruitment of transcriptional co-activators to the transcription complex on the pax4 gene. Neurogenin3 is not the only pancreatic bHLH factor that can dimerize with E47 and bind the PAX4 promoter E box, 2S. Smith, H. Watada, and M. German, unpublished data. and it seems possible that others, especially neuroD1, could substitute for Neurogenin3 on the PAX4 promoter in vivo. Two observations suggest that Neurogenin3 is the most important bHLH activator of the PAX4 promoter. First, Neurogenin3 and Pax4 have almost identical expression patterns during pancreatic development, with maximum expression between embryonic days 13 and 15 and no expression in mature islets (15Smith S.B. Ee H.C. Conners J.R. German M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8272-8280Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Second, in conjunction with heterodimeric partner E47, Neurogenin3 exhibits a higher affinity for the PAX4 promoter E box than for E boxes from other pancreatic promoters. 3S. Smith, H. Watada, and M. German, submitted for publication. Finally, the current study demonstrates that the Neurogenin3/E47 heterodimer is a better activator of the PAX4 minienhancer than any of the other bHLH dimers tested. Similarly, HNF1β could possibly substitute for HNF1α. HNF1α and HNF1β are related proteins sharing 93% sequence identity in their DNA binding domains, 75% identity in their dimerization domains, and 47% identity in their carboxyl-terminal activation domains (30Rey-Campos J. Chouard T. Yaniv M. Cereghini S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). HNF1α and HNF1β can form homodimers or heterodimers with each other, producing complexes with very similar or identical DNA binding characteristics. Both factors are found in the developing pancreas when Pax4 is present, and both factors can synergize with Neurogenin3 and activate the Pax4 promoter. Both factors are expressed broadly in the early pancreatic bud, although HNF1β may appear earlier (31Coffinier C. Barra J. Babinet C. Yaniv M. Mech. Dev. 1999; 89: 211-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 32Coffinier C. Thepot D. Babinet C. Yaniv M. Barra J. Development. 1999; 126: 4785-4794PubMed Google Scholar). Either or both may play a role in Pax4 expression. The role of the HNF4α binding site adjacent to the HNF1 binding site in the PAX4 promoter remains uncertain. The wild type minienhancer is maximally stimulated by the combination of Neurogenin3/E47 and HNF1α, with no further activation produced from the addition of HNF4α 1 or HNF4α 2 (data not shown). Mutation of the HNF4α site reduced the activity of the minienhancer, but the same mutated minienhancer could still be potently activated by a combination of Neurogenin3 and HNF1α (data not shown). Furthermore, Neurogenin3 and HNF1α alone were sufficient to induce expression of the endogenous pax4 gene in NIH3T3 cells (which have no endogenous HNF4α), although the level of expression is far below the level seen in βTC3 cells. It is possible that the absence of an appropriate ligand or other interacting proteins normally present in vivo could reduce the activity of HNF4α in these assays. We cannot rule out a role for HNF4α in pax4 gene expression. The pancreatic transcription factor PDX1 can also bind to the HNF1 site in the PAX4 promoter. We found no circumstances, however, in which PDX1 could activate the PAX4 promoter by itself or in combination with other factors. In view of the fact that PDX1 is not co-expressed with Neurogenin3 in islet progenitor cells (11Schwitzgebel V.M. Scheel D.W. Conners J.R. Kalamaras J. Lee J.E. Anderson D.J. Sussel L. Johnson J.D. German M.S. Development. 2000; 127: 3533-3542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), some of which also co-express Pax4 (18Smith S.B. Watada H. Scheel D.W. Mrejen C. German M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36910-36919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), it seems unlikely that PDX1 plays a direct role in Pax4 expression during normal development. These data strongly support a model in which HNF1 proteins and Neurogenin3 cooperate in activating Pax4 expression and β-cell differentiation in the developing pancreas and place these factors upstream of Pax4 on an increasingly detailed map of the hierarchy of factors that control islet cell determination and differentiation. Ultimately, our understanding of this pathway may lead to the development of methods for driving progenitor cells to differentiate into pancreatic islet cells for patients with diabetes. The ability of this cascade to function in cells as disparate as pancreatic duct cells and NIH3T3 fibroblasts provides encouraging evidence that this approach to islet cell production may eventually succeed. We thank members of the German, Hebrok, and Vaisse laboratories for helpful comments and criticism. We thank M. Stoffel (Rockefeller University) for providing the mouse HNF1α cDNA, G.

Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified α-actinin, a major F-actin-cross-linking protein, as a binding partner for the C-terminal domain of the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR). Colocalization, co-immunoprecipitation, and pull-down experiments showed a close and specific interaction between A2AR and α-actinin in transfected HEK-293 cells and also in rat striatal tissue. A2AR activation by agonist induced the internalization of the receptor by a process that involved rapid β-arrestin translocation from the cytoplasm to the cell surface. In the subsequent receptor traffic from the cell surface, the role of actin organization was shown to be crucial in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells, as actin depolymerization by cytochalasin D prevented its agonist-induced internalization. A2AΔCTR, a mutant version of A2AR that lacks the C-terminal domain and does not interact with α-actinin, was not able to internalize when activated by agonist. Interestingly, A2AΔCTR did not show aggregation or clustering after agonist stimulation, a process readily occurring with the wild-type receptor. These findings suggest an α-actinin-dependent association between the actin cytoskeleton and A2AR trafficking.

Adenosine is a molecule that plays a regulatory role in the nervous system, acting presynaptically, postsynaptically, and/or non-synaptically (1Sebastiao A.M. Ribeiro J.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 341-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Adenosine mediates its actions through activation of specific G protein-coupled heptaspanning membrane receptors, for which four subtypes have been identified (A1 R, 1The abbreviations used are: R, receptor; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; MEKK1, MEK kinase-1; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.

A2ARs are coupled mostly to Gs proteins (3Marala R.B. Mustafa S.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 266: 294-300PubMed Google Scholar), thus being mainly linked to adenylyl cyclase activation. The role of A2AR in the control of neurotransmitter release has been studied in several brain regions as well as in the peripheral nervous system (4Sebastiao A.M. Ribeiro J.A. Prog. Neurobiol. (Oxf.). 1996; 48: 167-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Compared with the other adenosine receptor subtypes, A2ARs are specially concentrated in the striatopallidal complex (5Ferré S. Fredholm B.B. Morelli M. Popoli P. Fuxe K. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 482-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Using ultrastructural techniques, Hettinger et al. (6Hettinger B.D. Lee A. Linden J. Rosin D.L. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 431: 331-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that A2ARs are mostly localized postsynaptically in dendrites and dendritic spines of rat striatal GABAergic (where GABA is γ-aminobutyric acid) neurons. The membrane expression and localization of A2AR are the result of ligand-mediated clustering, internalization, and receptor trafficking (7Hillion J. Canals M. Torvinen M. Casadó V. Scott R. Terasmaa A. Hansson A. Watson S. Olah M.E. Mallol J. Canela E.I. Zoli M. Agnati L.F. Ibáñez C.F. Lluis C. Franco R. Ferré S. Fuxe K. J. Biol.

There are four α-actinin genes: two non-skeletal muscle isoforms (α-actinin-1 and -4) and two skeletal muscle isoforms (α-actinin-2 and -3) (8Faulkner G. Pallavicini A. Comelli A. Salamon M. Bortoletto G. Ievolella C. Trevisan S. Kojic S. Dalla Vecchia F. Laveder P. Valles G. Lanfranchis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41234-41242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), all of which share a general structure, which can be divided into three functionally distinct domains: the N terminus, which contains two calponin homology domains and which mediates the interaction with actin; a central region composed of four spectrin-like motifs; and the C terminus, which contains EF-hand domains. Recently, the spatial expression of α-actinin-2 in the rat central nervous system was analyzed, revealing that the highest levels of the protein are found in the striatum, cortex, and hippocampus, where it has been shown to interact with the glutamate NMDA receptor (9Dunah A.W. Wyszynski M. Martin D.M. Sheng M. Standaert D.G. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 79: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this study, using a yeast two-hybrid approach and complementary biochemical techniques, we provide evidence for the existence of a physical interaction between A2AR and α-actinin. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that there is a functional association between the actin cytoskeleton and A2AR and more specifically with the receptor internalization process and its membrane agonist-induced aggregation or clustering. Two EcoRI-EcoRI fragments of the C-terminal tail of A2AR were subcloned into the bait vector pHybLexA/Zeo (Invitrogen) and the bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). One fragment coding for amino acids 293–412 (LA2A) was amplified using Taq DNA polymerase (Sigma) and the following primers: FLA2A (5′-TAAGAATTCCGCGAGTTCCGCCAGACC-3′) and RA2A (5′-CCGGAATTCCAAGCCAACCAGAAAGATAAAG-3′). For the second fragment coding for amino acids 322–412 (SA2A), the following primers were used: FSA2A (5′-TAAGAATTCCGGGTCTTGGCAGCTCATGGC-3′) and RA2A. The FLAG epitope was introduced between amino acids 6 and 7 of human A1R using the same PCR mutagenesis approach used for the A2AR-FLAG construct (10Ferre S. Karcz-Kubicha M. Hope B.T. Popoli P. Burgueño J. Gutiérrez M.A. Casadó V. Fuxe K. Goldberg S.R. Lluis C. Franco R. Ciruela F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11940-11945Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). A mutant lacking the C-terminal domain of A2AR was generated using A2AR-FLAG as the template and the following primers: FA2A (5′-CGGAATTCATGCCCATCATG-3′) and RA2AΔCT (5′-GCTCTAGACTAGTAGGCGTAGATGAAGGG-3′). The sequences of the cDNAs and their orientation in the vectors were confirmed by DNA sequencing. β-Arrestin-1-GFP, β-arrestin-2-GFP, and β-arrestin-1(S412D) were kindly provided by Drs. J. L. Benovic, M. G. Caron, and R. J. Lefkowitz, respectively. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—A bait strain was created by transforming pHybLex-LA2A into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain L40 following the manufacturer's instructions (Hybrid Hunter, Invitrogen). The bait strain was cotransformed with a mouse brain cDNA library constructed in the Gal4 activating domain vector pPC86 (Invitrogen), and transformants were plated onto minimal yeast medium lacking histidine, tryptophan, uracil, and lysine and containing 300 mg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) and 5 mm 3-aminotriazole. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 5 days, and yeast colonies that grew on histidine-deficient medium were re-streaked onto fresh selective plates and assayed for β-galactosidase activity following the manufacturer's instructions. Prey plasmids were isolated from yeast and electroporated into Escherichia coli XL-1Blue electrocompetent cells (Stratagene). The 5′-end of each clone was sequenced using a vector primer. To confirm the interaction in yeast, purified prey plasmids and α-actinin-3 2D. J. Blake, manuscript in preparation. were re-transformed with the pHybLex-LA2A bait and with the empty bait vector pHybLexA/Zeo and tested for growth on selective plates and β-galactosidase activity. Other control yeast strains used were the positive control strain containing pHybLexA/Zeo-dystrobrevin and pYESTrp-syntrophin plasmids and the negative control strain containing the empty bait and prey vectors pHybLexA/Zeo and pYESTrp2 (Invitrogen). Liquid β-Galactosidase Assay—1.5 ml of each culture (grown for 48 h at 30 °C) was spun, and the pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgSO4, pH 7.0). A small amount of glass beads (425–600 μm; Sigma) was added, and the mixture was sonicated for 5–10 min. After cell lysis, the samples were spun to pellet the cell debris. 100 μl of supernatant was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube, and 700 μl of Z buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol (27 μl/10 ml) was added. 150 μl of 2.5 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) was added to the sample, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The absorbance was read at 420 nm and refers to the amount of protein present in each sample. HEK-293 cells were grown in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. HEK-293 cells growing in 25-cm2 dishes or 20-mm coverslips were transiently transfected with 10 μg of DNA coding for the proteins specified in each case by calcium phosphate precipitation (11Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested at either 24 or 48 h after transfection. For primary cultures, striatal tissue from Sprague-Dawley rat embryos was treated with trypsin (0.5 g/liter) and EDTA (2 g/liter) solution (Sigma) for 10 min at 37 °C. Trypsinization was stopped by addition of complete medium (DMEM containing Glutamax-I, 10% fetal calf serum, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin), and tissue was gently triturated (10 passages) with a flame-sterilized glass Pasteur pipette. Cells were plated at 4–5 × 104 cells/cm2 in DMEM containing Glutamax-I, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin at 5% CO2 in poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips, and the medium was replaced after 1 h with DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. The next day, the cells were washed with DMEM, and the medium was replaced with serum-free B27-supplemented neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) containing 50 μg/ml gentamycin. The cells were kept at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 2–3 weeks without frequent medium change. SDS-PAGE was performed using 7.5 or 10% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were immunoblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp.) using a semidry transfer system and developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce) as described previously (12Ciruela F. McIlhinney R.A.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). GST, GST-SA2A, and GST-LA2A recombinant fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (Promega) with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) for 3 h at 37 °C and purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (12Ciruela F. McIlhinney R.A.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). 5 μg of each protein was coupled to 100 μl of a 50% (v/v) suspension of glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 4 °C. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) were solubilized in ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) for 30 min at 4 °C. The solubilized material was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatant was precleared with 100 μl of the 50% (v/v) suspension of glutathione-agarose beads for 1 h with constant rotation at 4 °C. After the preclearing, supernatants were transferred to a clean tube containing GST, GST-SA2A, or GST-LA2A coupled to glutathione-agarose and incubated overnight with constant rotation at 4 °C. Subsequently, the beads were washed twice with ice-cold lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40); twice with 0.1% (v/v) of ice-cold RIPA buffer; and once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Then, 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to each sample. Bound proteins were dissociated by heating at 37 °C for 1 h and resolved by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% gels as described above. An antiserum against the GST fusion protein containing amino acids 322–412 (SA2A) of A2AR (designated as anti-CTA2A) was used in this study. Immunization of rabbits and affinity purification of the antisera were performed as described previously (12Ciruela F. McIlhinney R.A.J.

Other primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-calnexin monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories), anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (clone M2; Sigma), anti-α-actinin polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-α-actinin monoclonal antibody (Sigma), and anti-β-arrestin polyclonal antibody Ab186 (1:1000 dilution) (14Penela P. Alvarez-Dolado M. Munoz A. Mayor Jr., F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4390-4396Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The secondary antibodies used were as follows: horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:60,000 dilution; Pierce), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:2000 dilution; Dako Corp.), Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1000 dilution) and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000 dilution; both from Molecular Probes, Inc.), and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:250 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Transfected HEK-293 cells were solubilized with ice-cold RIPA buffer, and lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (2 μg/ml) or anti-CTA2A polyclonal antibody (2 μg/ml) for 2 h. Then, 40 μl of a suspension of protein G or protein A cross-linked to agarose beads (Sigma) was added, and the mixture was incubated overnight with constant rotation at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with ice-cold RIPA buffer; twice with 0.1% (v/v) of ice-cold RIPA buffer; and once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Subsequently, 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to each sample. Immune complexes were dissociated by heating to 37 °C for 1 h and resolved by SDS-PAGE on 7.5 or 10% gels as described above. HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with A2AR-FLAG or A2AΔCTR-FLAG were washed three times with borate buffer (10 mm H3BO3, pH 8.8, and 150 mm NaCl) and then incubated with 50 μg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (Pierce) in borate buffer for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with borate buffer and again incubated with 50 μg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido)hexanoate in borate buffer for 10 min at room temperature, and 100 mm NH4Cl was added for 5 min to quench the remaining biotin. Cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline, disrupted with three 10-s strokes in a Polytron, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. The pellet was solubilized in ice-cold lysis buffer for 30 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was incubated with 80 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h with constant rotation at 4 °C. Beads were washed twice with ice-cold lysis buffer, twice with 0.1% (v/v) of ice-cold lysis buffer, and once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The complexes were dissociated by adding 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, heated at 37 °C for 1 h, and then resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels. The gels were run and immunoblotted as described above. Transiently transfected HEK-293 cells or rat striatal primary cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mm glycine (buffer A) to quench the remaining free aldehyde groups. Cells were permeabilized with buffer A containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Blocking was done using buffer A containing 1% bovine serum albumin (buffer B). Cells were labeled for 1 h at room temperature with the indicated primary antibody, washed for 30 min with buffer B, and stained with the corresponding secondary antibody for 1 h. Coverslips were rinsed for 30 min with buffer B and mounted with Immuno Fluore mounting medium (ICN). An Olympus FV 300 scanning laser confocal microscope was used for observations. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—To identify intracellular proteins interacting with A2AR, the last 120 amino acids of A2AR were fused in-frame with LexA in the pHybLexA/Zeo vector (LA2A) (Fig. 1A) and used to screen a mouse brain cDNA library with the yeast two-hybrid system. Of the 24 clones (from the 2 × 106 total transformants screened that were found to grow on nutritionally deficient plates and activated the β-galactosidase assay), seven were identified as different isoforms of the actin-binding protein α-actinin: three independent clones for α-actinin-1, another three for α-actinin-4, and one clone for α-actinin-2. To discard a false-positive interaction, all four different α-actinin isoforms were transformed again with LA2A and plated along with different negative and positive controls. As shown in Fig. 1A, only those transformants containing the C-terminal tail of A2AR and any of the α-actinins could grow on deficient medium and turned blue in the β-galactosidase assay, as did the positive control dystrobrevin/syntrophin (DB/SYN) (15Benson M.A. Newey S.E. Martin-Rendon E. Hawkes R. Blake D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24232-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). To determine the region of the C-terminal domain of A2AR that interacts with α-actinin, another LexA fusion protein of the last 91 amino acids of the receptor was constructed (SA2A) (Fig. 1B) and tested for its ability to bind α-actinin. This shorter fusion protein could not interact with any of the α-actinin isoforms (Fig. 1, B and C), thus mapping the interacting domain within amino acids 293–321 of A2AR. The interaction of both the LA2A and SA2A constructs and α-actinins was quantitated using a liquid β-galactosidase assay (Fig. 1C), showing the clearly different binding abilities of both A2AR constructs and confirming the region between amino acids 293 and 321 as the α-actinin-interacting domain. α-Actinin Binds to the C-terminal Domain of A2AR—To verify the interaction between α-actinin and the C-terminal tail of A2AR, we tested the ability of naturally expressed full-length α-actinin to associate with GST fusion proteins containing the LA2A and SA2A C-terminal regions of A2AR (GST-LA2A and GST-SA2A). As shown in Fig. 2, an immunoreactive band of 100 kDa corresponding to α-actinin endogenously expressed by HEK-293 cells could be detected in the crude extracts from these cells. This band was observed in pull-down assays when cell lysates were incubated with GST-LA2A fusion protein, but was not detected either with GST-SA2A fusion protein or with GST alone (Fig. 2). This result shows that naturally expressed α-actinin binds specifically to a region in A2AR between amino acids 293 and 321. Interaction of A2AR and α-Actinin in Transfected HEK-293 Cells—The association of A2AR and α-actinin was subsequently studied in transfected HEK-293 cells by double immunolabeling and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. By confocal microscopy analysis of HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with the cDNA coding for A2AR-FLAG, a marked overlap in the distribution of the two proteins was found (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, when the double immunolabeling experiment was performed in HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with the cDNA coding for A1R-FLAG (another adenosine receptor subtype with a shorter C-terminal tail) or with the cDNA coding for a mutant of A2AR lacking the whole C-terminal domain (A2AΔCTR-FLAG), no colocalization with α-actinin was observed (Fig. 3A), suggesting a specificity for the colocalization between A2AR-FLAG and α-actinin. When cell extracts of HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with A2AR-FLAG were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against the FLAG epitope and these immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using an antibody against α-actinin, a band of 100 kDa corresponding to α-actinin was observed (Fig. 3B, lane 4). Interestingly, this band did not appear in immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with the cDNAs coding for LacZ (Fig. 3B, lane 1), A1R-FLAG (lane 2), and A2AΔCTR-FLAG (lane 3). These results demonstrate that α-actinin can interact with full-length A2AR; that the interaction is mediated by the C-terminal tail of A2AR; and that the A2AR/α-actinin interaction is receptor subtype-specific, as A1R did not interact with α-actinin. Interaction of A2ARs with α-Actinin in Rat Striatal Homogenates and Primary Rat Striatal Neurons—To assess the physiological relevance of the A2AR/α-actinin interaction, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with rat striatal homogenates and double immunolabeling with primary cultures of rat striatal neurons. Using soluble extracts from rat striatum that had been shown by Western blotting to contain both α-actinin and A2AR (Fig. 4A, lane 1), anti-CTA2A antibody could immunoprecipitate a band of ∼100 kDa that was detected with α-actinin antibody (lane 2). This band did not appear when protein A-agarose was used for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4A, lane 3), showing that there was no unspecific interaction between α-actinin and the resin. The distribution of α-actinin and A2AR in primary rat striatal neurons was also tested. By confocal microscopy analysis, a similar punctate distribution and a partial colocalization for both proteins were found (Fig. 4B). Colocalization was not general, but it occurred both in the cell body, where the degree of colocalization of A2AR with α-actinin was very high (Fig. 4B, arrows), and at specific aggregates in dendrites (arrowheads). These observations are consistent with the idea that α-actinin and A2AR associate in striatal neurons. Correlation between α-Actinin Binding and A2AR Ligand-induced Trafficking—Because of the role of α-actinin in organizing and cross-linking actin filaments, we analyzed the possibility that the interaction between α-actinin and A2AR reported in this study could be related to the trafficking of the receptor, both its clustering and internalization processes occurring upon agonist stimulation. Although the agonist CGS-21680 (2-p-(2-carboxyethyl)phenethylamino-5′-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine) produces a marked internalization of A2AR (7Hillion J. Canals M. Torvinen M. Casadó V. Scott R. Terasmaa A. Hansson A. Watson S. Olah M.E. Mallol J. Canela E.I. Zoli M. Agnati L.F. Ibáñez C.F. Lluis C. Franco R. Ferré S. Fuxe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18091-18097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), the molecules involved in this process are not well known. For example, the role of β-arrestin proteins in the internalization process of A2AR has not yet been described. Confocal scanning microscopy was used to visualize in cotransfected cells the possible translocation of β-arrestin-1-GFP or β-arrestin-2-GFP from the cytoplasm to the cell surface. Fig. 5A shows that, in the absence of agonist, β-arrestin-1-GFP was homogeneously localized in the cytosol of cells also expressing A2AR-FLAG. Upon stimulation with 200 nm CGS-21680, a rapid (2 min) translocation of β-arrestin-1-GFP to the cell surface was observed. Similar results were obtained when A2AR was cotransfected with β-arrestin-2-GFP (data not shown). To further examine whether A2AR internalization is arrestin-dependent, the receptor was cotransfected with β-arrestin-1(S412D), a mutant with dominant-negative properties with respect to receptor internalization (16Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). To analyze the amount of receptor in the plasma membrane, we isolated cell-surface proteins by protein biotinylation using a membrane-impermeant biotin ester. Proteins isolated by streptavidin-agarose affinity precipitation were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies against the C-terminal tail of A2AR (anti-CTA2A) and the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein calnexin. The absence of calnexin in the streptavidin isolates indicated that the biotin ester had not penetrated into the cell and that it labeled only proteins in the plasma membrane (Fig. 5B, lower panels). As shown in Fig. 5B, the overexpressed arrestin mutant inhibited agonist-induced A2AR internalization, indicating that A2AR is able to recruit β-arrestin proteins to the plasma membrane and that its agonist-dependent internalization process is, as in the case of other G protein-coupled receptors of the same family, β-arrestin-dependent (17Mundell S.J. Matharu A.L. Kelly E. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12828-12836Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18Ferguson G. Watterson K.R. Palmer T.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14748-14761Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The effect of α-actinin in the internalization process subsequent to β-arrestin recruitment was determined by analyzing the need of an intact actin cytoskeleton for receptor internalization. HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with A2AR-FLAG were pretreated with vehicle (Fig. 6, A and B) or with 2 μm cytochalasin D for 2 h (C and D) as described previously (19Peyrollier K. Hajduch E. Gray A. Litherland J. Prescott A.R. Leslie N.R. Hundal H.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). After treatment, cells were incubated with vehicle (Fig. 6, A and C, lane 1) or with 200 nm CGS-21680 (A and C, lane 2) for 2 h at 37 °C. After internalization, receptor recycling was assessed by washing the cells after agonist treatment and further incubation for 1 h at 37 °C with fresh medium (Fig. 6, A and C, lane 3). The results show that the amount of receptor present in the cell surface decreased substantially in cells treated with CGS-21680 (Fig. 6A, lane 2) compared with control cells (lane 1). When the agonist was washed out, the cell-surface expression of the receptor was partially recovered after 1 h (Fig. 6A, lane 3). In contrast, pretreatment of cells with cytochalasin D avoided agonist-induced internalization of A2AR (Fig. 6C, lane 2). Quantitation of the cell surface-associated receptor by densitometric scanning of the immunoreactive bands on the films indicated that agonist treatment or challenge induced an internalization of 74% of the total cell-surface receptor (Fig. 6B). Under the same conditions, when cells were pretreated with the actin-disrupting agent cytochalasin D, the agonist challenge did not induce internalization of the receptor (Fig. 6D). These results indicate that a completely organized actin cytoskeleton is necessary for the agonist-dependent internalization of A2AR. Moreover, the internalization ability of A2AΔCTR, the C-terminal deletion mutant of A2AR that showed neither colocalization nor co-immunoprecipitation with α-actinin (Fig. 3), was tested. After agonist treatment of transiently transfected cells with A2AΔCTR-FLAG, the membrane proteins were isolated (see above) and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-FLAG antibody to detect A2AΔCTR-FLAG (Fig. 7). The results show that the amount of receptor present at the plasma membrane remained invariable after agonist treatment (Fig. 7, lane 2) compared with the untreated cells (lane 1). Again, the absence of calnexin in the streptavidin isolates indicated that the biotin could not penetrate the cell (Fig. 7, lower panels).Fig. 7The C-terminal tail of A2AR is directly involved in its agonist-induced internalization. HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with A2AΔCTR-FLAG were treated with vehicle (lane 1) or with 200 nm CGS-21680 (lane 2) for 2 h at 37 °C. After this incubation period, cells were processed for cell-surface biotinylation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Crude extracts and cell-surface biotinylated"

It is now well established that γ-secretase processing of transmembrane proteins is preceded by proteolysis near the interface of the ectodomain and transmembrane segments that generates a soluble ectodomain that is “shed” and one, or more, membrane-tethered derivatives. In the case of APP, a set of membrane-tethered APP derivatives, termed APP-CTFs, are the substrates for γ-secretase, and intramembranous processing leads to the production of Aβ peptides. Similarly, γ-secretase is responsible for processing of a membrane-tethered Notch1 derivative, termed S2/NEXT, resulting in the generation of a Notch derivative, termed S3/NICD that translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription of target genes (4De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R.

Intrigued by the observation that deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) is a substrate for cleavage by a metalloprotease that leads to “shedding” of the ectodomain segment (12Galko M.J. Tessier-Lavigne M. Science. 2000; 289: 1365-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), we asked whether the resulting membrane-tethered “stub” might be processed by γ-secretase. In the present report, we show that in cultured mammalian cells, the truncated DCC stub is subject to a PS-dependent processing event that is inhibited by a highly potent γ-secretase inhibitor. Moreover, the DCC stub accumulates to high levels in spinal cords of PS1-deficient mice, leading us to postulate that this species is also a substrate for γ-secretase processing in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that the γ-secretase-generated intracellular domain of DCC, termed DCC-ICD, can translocate to the nucleus and that this fragment has an intrinsic transcriptional activation domain. Construct—pSecTagA/DCC encodes c-myc-epitope tagged rat full-length DCC expression plasmid (Fig. 1B). To generate pCMVneo/DCC-GIC, pCMVneo/DCC (13Hedrick L. Cho K.R. Fearon E.R. Wu T.C. Kinzler K.W.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1174-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) was partially digested with BstXI and the fragment encoding Gal4 DNA-binding domain was inserted into the BstXI site located between the transmembrane region and the conserved P1 domain of DCC intracellular domain. The V1117A and V1119A mutant DCC constructs were generated by overlapping PCR-based mutagenesis (14Kim S.H. Leem J.Y. Lah J.J. Slunt H.H. Levey A.I. Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol.

The sequences of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 or N2a cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with vehicle, 50 nm compound E, 10 μm lactacystin or both compound E and lactacystin for additional 24 h.

For luciferase assays, cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of expression plasmid, 167 ng of pG5E1B-luc (15Cao X. Sudhof T.C.

DCC is subject to a metalloprotease-dependent ectodomain shedding event (12Galko M.J. Tessier-Lavigne M. Science. 2000; 289: 1365-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Like DCC, Notch1 is also subject to ectodomain shedding (17Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Saxena M.T. Griesemer A. Tian X. Pan D.J. Ray W.J. Kopan R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 197-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 18Brou C. Logeat F. Gupta N. Bessia C. LeBail O. Doedens J.R. Cumano A. Roux P. Black R.A. Israel A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 207-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar), and in this case, the residual membrane-tethered stub, termed S2/NEXT, is subject to an intramembranous, presenilin-dependent, γ-secretase processing reaction that leads to the production of cytosolic derivatives termed S3/NICD (11Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). A valine residue at the P1′ site is essential for γ-secretase-dependent processing of Notch (11Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar), and a valine residue occurs at a similar position within the transmembrane domains of other γ-secretase substrates (Fig. 1A). Intrigued by the finding that DCC is subject to proteolysis in the ectodomain, coupled with the presence of several valine residues within the transmembrane domain proximal to the cytoplasmic segment, we asked whether DCC might also serve as a γ-secretase substrate. We transiently expressed a myc epitope-tagged full-length rat DCC (pSecTag-DCC; Fig. 1B) into HEK293 cells, then treated cells with 0.5% Me2SO (vehicle), or compound E (19Seiffert D. Bradley J.D. Rominger C.M. Rominger D.H. Yang F. Meredith Jr., J.E. Wang Q. Roach A.H. Thompson L.A. Spitz S.M. Higaki J.N. Prakash S.R. Combs A.P. Copeland R.A. Arneric S.P. Hartig P.R. Robertson D.W. Cordell B. Stern A.M. Olson R.E. Zaczek R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34086-34091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), a highly potent inhibitor of γ-secretase. Treatment of the cells with 50 nm compound E resulted in the accumulation of ∼56–58 kDa, myc antibody-reactive fragments that we refer to as “α” fragments (Fig. 2A, lane 3). As the DCC cytoplasmic tail is degraded by the proteasome (20Hu G. Zhang S. Vidal M. Baer J.L. Xu T. Fearon E.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2701-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), we treated cells with the proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin. Lactacystin treatment of DCC-expressing cells resulted in the accumulation of closely spaced fragments with an apparent molecular weight of between 48–52 kDa (Fig. 2A, lane 4). By virtue of the fact that these fragments accumulate to high levels with lactacystin treatment and are not present in cells treated with the γ-secretase inhibitor, we refer to these γ-secretase-generated, DCC derivatives as DCC-ICD fragments. Treatment with both compound E and lactacystin resulted in the accumulation of α but not DCC-ICD fragments, as expected (Fig. 2A, lane 5). Lactacystin treatment also resulted in the accumulation of an ∼20-kDa myc antibody-reactive fragment (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 5), the production of which was fully abolished upon treatment of cells with the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (data not shown). To determine whether γ-secretase cleavage of DCC occurs in an in vivo setting, we performed Western blot analysis of detergent extracts prepared from the spinal cords of E14.5 wild type and PS1-deficient (22Wong P.C. Zheng H. Chen H. Becher M.W. Sirinathsinghji D.J. Trumbauer M.E. Chen H.Y. Price D.L. Van der Ploeg L.H. Sisodia S.S. Nature. 1997; 387: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) mouse embryos. We observed a prominent species of ∼180 kDa, representing full-length DCC in the spinal cords from wild type embryos (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, we observed ∼54–56-kDa fragments that accumulated in extracts from PS1-deficient mice (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4) that are reminiscent of the α fragments that accumulate in cultured cells treated with the γ-secretase inhibitor (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 5). Although we failed to detect a band corresponding to DCC-ICD in extracts from wild type animals, we surmise that this derivative is generated, but rapidly degraded. In any event, we interpret these collective results to suggest that in the developing spinal cord, DCC is subject to γ-secretase cleavage. To further confirm that the generation of the γ-secretase-generated DCC-ICD fragments is PS-dependent, we transiently expressed DCC in mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells stably expressing either human wild type PS1 (WT.7) or the dominant negative D385A mutant PS1 (D385A.16; Ref. 14Kim S.H. Leem J.Y. Lah J.J. Slunt H.H. Levey A.I. Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43343-43350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Similar to the results obtained in HEK293 cells, treatment of N2a WT.7 cells with compound E (Fig. 2C, lane 3) and lactacystin (Fig. 2C, lane 4) led to the accumulation of α and DCC-ICD fragments, respectively. In contrast, in lysates of N2a D385A.16 cells that transiently express DCC, we observed robust accumulation of α fragments (Fig. 2C, lane 7), and neither lactacystin, nor compound E, had an appreciable effect on stabilization of this fragment (Fig. 2C, lanes 8–10). Taken together, these results indicate that following ectodomain shedding, the membrane-tethered DCC α derivative is subject to PS-dependent γ-secretase cleavage. In the case of Notch, a mutation of the P1′ valine residue results in the marked reduction of transcriptional activation by Notch (11Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar, 21Huppert S.S. Le A. Schroeter E.H. Mumm J.S. Saxena M.T. Milner L.A. Kopan R. Nature. 2000; 405: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). To determine whether the conserved valine residues in the transmembrane domain of DCC are required for γ-secretase processing, we transiently expressed DCC mutants with amino acid substitutions either at valine 1117 or valine 1119 (marked with asterisk in Fig. 1A) in HEK293 cells and examined the accumulation of DCC derivatives in the presence of lactacystin and compound E. Remarkably, both mutants appeared to be processed in a γ-secretase-dependent manner similar to wild type DCC (Fig. 2D, compare lanes 3, 7, and 11 with lanes 4, 8, and 12). These results reveal that valine residues within the DCC transmembrane domain that are immediately proximal to the cytoplasmic segment are dispensable for γ-secretase processing of the DCC α fragment. The sequence, or structural, determinants required for γ-secretase cleavage of DCC remain to be determined. The DCC Intracellular Domain Has Intrinsic Transcriptional Activity—It is well established that γ-secretase cleavage of the membrane-tethered Notch S2/NEXT fragment results in the generation of a soluble Notch S3/NICD fragment that translocates to the nucleus where it is a transcriptional coactivator with RBP-Jκ (11Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). Similarly, the APP AICD derivative forms a transcriptionally competent ternary complex that includes Fe65 and Tip60 (15Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 23Baek S.H. Ohgi K.A. Rose D.W. Koo E.H. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2002; 110: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). To examine whether DCC-ICD has intrinsic transcriptional activity, we transiently expressed a chimera in which the Gal4 DNA-binding domain was inserted between the DCC transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (pCMVneoDCC-GIC; Fig. 1B) along with a luciferase-based reporter gene into HEK293 cells. We obtained considerable transcriptional activation (Fig. 3A) that was largely blocked by treatment of cells with compound E or another unrelated, but potent, γ-secretase inhibitor (compound 1) (24Tian G. Sobotka-Briner C.D. Zysk J. Liu X. Birr C. Sylvester M.A. Edwards P.D. Scott C.D. Greenberg B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31499-31505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The DCC-GIC “ICD” fragments are readily visualized either in the absence, or presence, of lactacystin (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2), and treatment with compound E results in accumulation of the DCC-GIC “α fragment” (Fig. 3B, lane 3), results similar to those obtained with full-length DCC. Thus, the γ-secretase-generated DCC cytoplasmic domain contains elements sufficient to activate transcription of heterologous promoters. In an attempt to determine whether DCC-ICD could be visualized in the nucleus, we expressed a DCC-EGFP chimera in HEK293 cells. We only observed the accumulation of this chimera on the plasma membrane, but not in the nucleus (data not shown). These results suggest that like Notch S3/NICD (11Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar), the transcriptional stimulatory activity of DCC is likely mediated by limiting levels of DCC-ICD in the nucleus.

The finding that the netrin 1 receptor, DCC, is subject to a metalloprotease-mediated ectodomain shedding event (12Galko M.J. Tessier-Lavigne M. Science. 2000; 289: 1365-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and the presence of several valine residues in the DCC transmembrane domain, led us to hypothesize that this molecule might also serve as substrate for γ-secretase. In the present report, we confirm this prediction and offer several insights relevant to the molecular apparatus responsible for intramembranous processing of DCC and the potential functional significance of this processing event. First, we demonstrate that in cultured mammalian cells, the production of the γ-secretase-generated cytoplasmic derivative of DCC, termed DCC-ICD, is inhibited by a highly potent inhibitor of γ-secretase activity, or by the expression of the dominant-negative D385A PS1 mutant, but not by mutations at the conserved valine residues in the transmembrane domain of DCC. The PS-dependent γ-secretase generated DCC-ICD fragments that are highly labile and only detected by the addition of the proteosomal inhibitor, lactacystin. The identity of the amino termini of these fragments is not known. However, it seems somewhat unlikely that the fragments are all generated by intramembranous cleavage events as the difference in molecular weights of the fragments are too broad. Thus, we suspect that differing levels of posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination contribute to the differing mobilities of the fragments. Second, DCC appears to be a bona fide substrate for an ectodomain shedding activity in vivo by virtue of the fact that a membrane tethered α derivative accumulates to high levels in spinal cords of mice with genetic ablations of PS1. Because we have failed to detect DCC-ICD in spinal cords of wild type embryos, we can only hypothesize that the α fragment is a substrate for γ-secretase. Indeed, the absence of detectable DCC-ICD in wild type embryos and accumulation of DCC derivatives in spinal cords from PS1-deficient embryos is very similar to our earlier findings that APP-derived AICD is undetectable in brains of wild type embryos, while α- and β-secretase-generated APP-CTFs accumulate in brains of PS1 deficient embryos (3Naruse S. Thinakaran G. Luo J.J. Kusiak J.W. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. Qian X. Ginty D.D. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Wong P.C. Sisodia S.S. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1213-1221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our preliminary immunocytochemical studies have revealed that commissural axon projections in the developing spinal cord are highly disorganized. It is not clear whether the disorganization of commissural axons is a reflection of defects in γ-secretase processing of DCC, alone, or deficits in intramembranous processing of other axonal molecules involved in migration and cell adhesion, including nectin-1α and N-cadherins. Third, we examined the hypothesis that the γ-secretase-generated DCC-ICD fragments are translocated to the nucleus and activate transcription of a reporter gene. We show that a chimera in which the Gal4 DNA-binding domain is inserted between the DCC transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains is competent to activate transcription of a promoter containing Gal4 binding sites and that the transcriptional activation by DCC was largely blocked by γ-secretase inhibitors. These results indicate that the intracellular domain of DCC acts as a transcriptional activator in mammalian cells and that γ-secretase plays an essential role in the regulation of DCC-dependent transcription. At present, the identity of the factors that regulate translocation and transcriptional activity of DCC-ICD is not known. Future efforts to characterize these factors and the downstream target genes may offer new insights into the signaling pathways responsible for mediating DCC-regulated axonal guidance during development and cell cycle regulation in neoplasias.

https://openalex.org/W2030593951,"We describe the chemoenzymatic synthesis of a variety of monodisperse hyaluronan (β4-glucuronic acid-β3-N-acetylglucosamine (HA)) oligosaccharides. Potential medical applications for HA oligosaccharides (∼10–20 sugars in length) include killing cancerous tumors and enhancing wound vascularization. Previously, the lack of defined oligosaccharides has limited the exploration of these sugars as components of new therapeutics. The Pasteurella multocida HA synthase, pmHAS, a polymerizing enzyme that normally elongates HA chains rapidly (∼1–100 sugars/s), was converted by mutagenesis into two single-action glycosyltransferases (glucuronic acid transferase and N-acetylglucosamine transferase). The two resulting enzymes were purified and immobilized individually onto solid supports. The two types of enzyme reactors were used in an alternating fashion to produce extremely pure sugar polymers of a single length (up to HA20) in a controlled, stepwise fashion without purification of the intermediates. These molecules are the longest, non-block, monodisperse synthetic oligosaccharides hitherto reported. This technology platform is also amenable to the synthesis of medicant-tagged or radioactive oligosaccharides for biomedical testing. Furthermore, these experiments with immobilized mutant enzymes prove both that pmHAS-catalyzed polymerization is non-processive and that a monomer of enzyme is the functional catalytic unit.

Complex carbohydrates play many essential roles in vertebrates, but these molecules are often difficult to isolate or to synthesize in pure form and in large amounts for study. HA, 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronan, hyaluronate, or hyaluronic acid; pmHAS, Pasteurella multocida hyaluronan synthase; GlcUA, glucuronic acid; Tase, transferase; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. a member of the glycosaminoglycan polysaccharide family that includes heparin and chondroitin, is a repeating β4-glucuronic acid-β3-N-acetylglucosamine polymer that is prevalent in the vertebrate body. HA has numerous essential roles in mammals, including modulation of cellular adhesion, signaling, and motility (1Toole B.P. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 2Lee J.Y. Spicer A.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The polymer is thought to be synthesized initially as a chain of ∼105–6 Da (∼103–4 sugars), which then degrades during turnover in the body to generate a variety of smaller polymers. Although the mechanisms are not completely understood, it has been observed that the size of the HA polymer dictates its effect on cells. Various cell-surface receptors or binding proteins, termed hyaladherins, are postulated to sense the presence and the size of HA (3Knudson C.B. Knudson W. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 4Day A.J. Prestwich G.D. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Hyaladherins thought to play important roles include CD44 and RHAMM. Multivalent binding and/or multimerization of receptors may potentially occur with large polymers but not with small chains, resulting in the alteration of various signaling events. Recently, several groups have reported that HA oligosaccharides (∼2–3.5 kDa or ∼10–17 sugars) have extremely interesting effects on cellular behavior. These small sugar molecules induce a variety of cancer cells to undergo programmed cell death or apoptosis (6Zeng C. Toole B.P. Kinney S.D. Kuo J.W. Stamenkovic I. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 7Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38013-38020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). This intriguing finding immediately suggests the use of HA oligosaccharides as an aid to chemotherapy or radiation treatments to reduce tumor load or limit spread (metastasis). HA oligosaccharides were also shown to induce angiogenesis of normal endothelia in several model systems (8West D.C. Hampson I.N. Arnold F. Kumar S. Science. 1985; 228: 1324-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 9Slevin M. Kumar S. Gaffney J. J. Biol.

Such activity may be of utility for enhancing healing of chronic wounds, ulcers, and burns in the future. For these initial anticancer and neovascularization experiments, mixtures of HA oligosaccharides were isolated from partial enzymatic digests of native high molecular weight HA polymer. Unfortunately, the low yields have limited animal studies, and the size(s) of the most potent molecule(s) in the mixture of sugars is not yet known. We describe a new chemoenzymatic synthesis methodology for the preparation of desirable monodisperse HA oligosaccharides of any desired size. Our catalysts are recombinant derivatives of an enzyme that catalyzes the polymerization of the HA polysaccharide, the HA synthase. Naturally occurring HA synthases are dual-action glycosyltransferases that add two different sugars, GlcUA and GlcNAc, to form a polymer chain (11Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 12DeAngelis P.L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), as in Equation 1. nUDP-GlcUA+nUDP-GlcNAc→2nUDP+[GlcUA-GlcNAc]n(Eq. 1) In contrast, the vast majority of the other known glycosyltransferases transfer only one type of monosaccharide to an acceptor molecule. Various HA synthases have been identified and molecularly cloned from vertebrates, Gram-positive Groups A and C Streptococcus bacteria and Gram-negative Type A Pasteurella multocida bacteria. The pathogenic bacteria form extracellular coatings of HA, called capsules, that serve roles including camouflaging the microbe from host defenses and potentially hijacking normal host HA recognition or signaling functions (13DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 9R-16RCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). HA synthases will transfer sugars as in Equation 1 at ∼1–100 monosaccharides/s in vitro to form 104- to 106-Da polymer chains. The native forms of the known HA synthases are thus unsuitable for production of short defined oligosaccharides; it is too difficult to control enzyme activity precisely and reproducibly through kinetic means (e.g. reducing substrate concentration, temperature, and/or reaction time). The Pasteurella HA synthase, pmHAS, sequentially adds single monosaccharides to the nonreducing terminus of the nascent HA chain (14DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26557-26562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This enzyme possesses two independent transferase (Tase) activities in a single polypeptide as shown by mutational analyses of recombinant Escherichia coli-derived pmHAS (15Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 16Jing, W., and DeAngelis, P. L. (2003) Glycobiology, in pressGoogle Scholar). A lesion in one active site leaves the activity in the other unmutated active site relatively unaffected. Therefore, the separate reactions in Equations 2 and 3 are now possible. UDP-GlcNAc+[GlcUA-GlcNAc]n→UDP+GlcNAc-[GlcUA-GlcNAc]n(Eq. 2) UDP-GlcUA+[GlcNAc-GlcUA]n→UDP+GlcUA-[GlcNAc-GlcUA]n(Eq. 3) In this report, we harnessed the two component enzyme activities of the HA synthase, a β3GlcNAc-Tase and a β4GlcUA-Tase, for oligosaccharide synthesis in an immobilized enzyme reactor format. This is the first demonstration of the controlled chemoenzymatic synthesis of any glycosaminoglycan oligosaccharide. Furthermore, we have utilized our strategy to synthesize the longest monodisperse oligosaccharides of any composition hitherto reported without block addition or dendritic schemes. Enzymes and Immobilization—The soluble, truncated dual-action wild-type pmHAS1–703 enzyme was mutated with the QuikChange system (Stratagene) to produce a pair of single-action enzymes: the GlcNAc-Tase pmHAS1–703(D527N,D529N) and the GlcUA-Tase pmHAS1–703(D247N,D249N). The mutant enzymes in the bacterial lysates (15Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) were purified by chromatography on Toyopearl red AF resin (Tosoh) using salt elution (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 m ethylene glycol with 0–1.5 m NaCl gradient in 1 h). The fractions containing the mutant protein (∼90% pure by SDS-PAGE/Coomassie staining) were immobilized by means of their free amino groups to N-hydroxysuccinimide agarose beads (Sigma). Typically, ∼95% of the protein was coupled to the beads after mixing for 4–6hat4 °C. Residual activated esters were quenched with TEG buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1 m ethylene glycol) for 2 h at 4 °C before washing the beads extensively with more TEG. The enzyme reactors (∼18 mg of protein on 4 ml of packed beads in a small glass column) were catalytically active for at least 8 months with storage at 4 °C in TEG buffer with 0.05% sodium azide preservative. Chemoenzymatic Synthesis—In the typical oligosaccharide synthesis, 90 μmol of acceptor oligosaccharide and 110–135 μmol (1.2–1.5 equivalents) of UDP-sugar (final = ∼15 mm) in reaction buffer (TEG plus 17 mm MnCl2) were circulated over an enzyme reactor at room temperature. The tetrasaccharide HA4, the starting acceptor for the synthesis of longer oligosaccharides, was generated by exhaustive degradation of streptococcal HA polymer (Sigma) with ovine testicular hyaluronidase Type V (Sigma) and purified by extensive chloroform extraction, ultrafiltration, and gel filtration chromatography on P2 resin (Bio-Rad). For converting HA4 starting material (with a GlcUA at the nonreducing terminus) into the pentasaccharide HA5, the GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc was transferred with the GlcNAc-Tase reactor as in Equation 2. The reactions were monitored by TLC (silica plates developed with 1-butanol/acetic acid/H2O, 1.5:1:1 for HA4 to HA8 or 1:1:1 for HA8 to HA14) and napthoresorcinol staining (dipped in 0.2% w/v reagent in 96% ethanol, 4% sulfuric acid and followed by heating at 100 °C). Typically, each step of the 90-μmol scale reactions was judged to be complete by TLC within 1 or 2 passes of the mixture through the reactor (∼5- to 10-min contact time), but the reaction mixture was further recirculated for a total of 12 passes (∼1–2 h) to ensure virtually complete oligosaccharide conversion. After the reaction mixture was harvested, the enzyme reactor was washed with a column volume of TEG buffer, and this washing was added to the reaction mixture. A small amount of MnCl2 was added to compensate for the volume increase because of the wash step (final = 17 mm). The next UDP-sugar (in this specific case, UDP-GlcUA) was added to the reaction mixture and then applied to the next reactor (converting HA5 into the hexasaccharide HA6 with immobilized GlcUA-Tase) to perform the reaction of Equation 3. This repetitive synthesis was continued by adding the next appropriate UDP-sugar and switching enzyme reactors. Between each step, the reactors were washed extensively with TEG to remove any residual reaction products retained on the column from the previous step. At the end of the desired synthesis, the reaction mixtures were lyophilized, and the oligosaccharides were desalted by gel filtration on P4 resin (Bio-Rad) eluted with 0.2 m ammonium formate. The major sugar peak was harvested, and the volatile residual salts were removed by lyophilization from water three times. HA20 was prepared starting with purified HA13 from the synthesis above. In this synthesis, for proof of principle and for convenience, all of the required UDP-sugars for the complete synthesis were added at the first step. Oligosaccharide Analyses—For MALDI-TOF MS, the matrix solution (50 mg/ml 6-aza-2-thiothymine in 50% acetonitrile, 49.9% water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 10 mm ammonium citrate) was mixed 1:1 with the samples containing ∼0.1 μg/μl oligosaccharide in water, spotted onto the target plate, and vacuum-dried. The samples were analyzed in the negative ion, reflectron mode on a Voyager Elite DE mass spectrometer (acceleration, 20 kV; low mass gate, 800 Da; delayed extraction, 180 ns). The oligosaccharides were also analyzed by 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with acridine orange staining, as described previously (17Ikegami-Kawai M. Takahashi T. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 311: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Generation of Immobilized Enzyme Reactors—Previously, we produced a soluble form of pmHAS by removing a portion of the carboxyl terminus (residues 704–972), which encodes the putative membrane association region (15Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The good solubility and higher yields allow for the purification of active HA synthase. Mutation of a predicted UDP-sugar substrate-binding amino acid motif, DXD (16Jing, W., and DeAngelis, P. L. (2003) Glycobiology, in pressGoogle Scholar), in either of the two enzyme active sites into NXN converts the dual-action HA synthase into essentially a single-action glycosyltransferase. Mutation of the A1 domain yields a β4GlcUA-Tase, whereas mutation of the A2 domain yields a β3GlcNAc-Tase (Fig. 1A). The pmHAS mutants that contained only a single change in a DXD motif (e.g. DXNorNXD) reported earlier were not suitable for preparative scale synthesis because their HA polymerizing activity could be rescued partially by the high UDP-sugar concentration utilized (16Jing, W., and DeAngelis, P. L. (2003) Glycobiology, in pressGoogle Scholar). On the other hand, the NXN double mutants were virtually inactive as HA synthases at the high substrate levels employed here. Each of the pmHAS NXN mutant enzymes was purified and immobilized covalently onto activated agarose beads in a functional state. The solid-phase catalyst facilitates (i) recirculation of the reaction mixture to assure quantitative sugar addition at every step, (ii) simplified recovery of the oligosaccharide product, and (iii) preservation of the catalyst for subsequent steps. The enzyme immobilized on beads was also more stable than free soluble enzyme over time or heat challenge (data not shown). Chemoenzymatic Synthesis—In the typical oligosaccharide synthesis, 1 eq of the tetrasaccharide HA4 (β4GlcUA-β3Glc-NAc)2 acceptor and 1.2–1.5 eq of UDP-sugar in reaction buffer were circulated over an enzyme reactor at room temperature (Fig. 1B). The reactions were virtually complete after one or two passes of the reaction mixture through a reactor (∼5–10 min), as judged by thin layer chromatography (TLC) (not shown). However, it is very important in any multistep or repetitive synthesis to assure virtual completion of each step to avoid accumulation of a multitude of failure products at the end of the process. Therefore, the reaction mixture was recirculated on a given enzyme reactor for an additional ∼1–2 h. The reaction mixture was then removed from the first enzyme reactor, the next required UDP-sugar was added, and the reaction mixture was recirculated on the next enzyme reactor. No significant runaway polymerization (i.e. multiple sugar additions on a single reactor) was noted with these NXN mutant enzyme reactors even in the presence of both UDP-sugars. No intermediate purification measures were performed during the 8, 9, or 10 sugar addition steps to produce HA12, HA13, or HA14, respectively. The total synthesis time was about 2 days. Cycling the desalted tridecasaccharide HA13 through seven more enzyme reactor steps created a longer oligosaccharide, the 20-mer HA20. The crude reaction mixtures were judged to contain >95–97% of the target product oligosaccharide by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (not shown) and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). Therefore, each enzyme reactor step proceeded to >99.5% completion to achieve the overall observed operating efficiency. The only final purification required was gel filtration chromatography to remove low molecular weight salts, unincorporated precursor sugar, and UDP by-product from the target oligosaccharide. For the larger HA molecules, simple dialysis or ultrafiltration for desalting sufficed. All of the oligosaccharides had the expected masses as measured by MALDI-TOF MS (Fig. 3). The final yields after 10 addition steps at the 90-μmol scale were about 50% because of losses during sample monitoring and slight retention of sugars on the agarose-based reactors in each cycle. The recombinant Pasteurella enzyme, designated a Class II HA synthase, has several unique intrinsic properties that allow chemoenzymatic synthesis of desirable short oligosaccharides. In contrast, all the known Class I HA synthases (streptococcal, viral, and vertebral) are relatively unsuitable for this synthetic task. Only pmHAS will elongate in vitro exogenously supplied oligosaccharides (e.g. HA4) (14DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26557-26562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The Class I HAS are not as well understood as pmHAS, and the two component sugar transferase activities have not been separated in a practical fashion by molecular genetic means. In our dual-enzyme reactor strategy, the final size of the oligosaccharide depends on the number of sugar addition steps employed. Substantial benefits of this scheme are that purification of intermediates is not needed after every step and that high stepwise yields are possible by recirculating the reaction mixture over a given enzyme reactor. An added benefit of utilizing pmHAS derivatives for multistep syntheses is that these enzymes are relatively insensitive to the UDP by-product of the transferase reaction (∼60% inhibition at 15 mm UDP with 1 mm substrates). In contrast, the class I HAS enzymes are greatly inhibited by relatively low concentrations of UDP (>90% inhibition at 0.5 mm UDP with 1 mm substrates). Indeed, the pmHAS mutants are efficient catalysts, as judged by swift reaction times utilizing only 1.2–1.5 molar eq of UDP-sugar per sugar addition step. Other methods for the production of HA oligosaccharides have been reported, but they have shortcomings. Chemical synthesis of carbohydrates is difficult because of the demands of stereoselective (i.e. α versus β glycosidic linkages) and regio-selective (i.e. only one of the multiple functionalities per sugar ring) coupling of sugars. State of the art synthetic strategies utilize multiple protection/deprotection cycles in a variety of toxic and/or flammable solvents with often less than quantitative yields. In contrast, the enzyme is the “perfect” carbohydrate chemist, performing sugar additions with no side-products in aqueous solution. The largest HA oligosaccharide synthesized by chemical means to date was the hexasaccharide (HA6), containing a methoxyphenyl group at the reducing terminus (18Halkes K.M. Slaghek T.M. Hypponen T.K. Kruiskamp P.H. Ogawa T. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 309: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although it is a very nice example, this product is too small for the interesting biological activities described earlier. Another major difficulty of organic synthesis is that the reaction rate for longer oligosaccharide formation is significantly slower than that for shorter sugars. In contrast, the pmHAS-catalyzed reaction rate appears to increase for the longer HA oligosaccharide acceptors (not shown). The cost of UDP-sugars used in chemoenzymatic synthesis, a once ominous barrier, has been significantly lowered recently. Recombinant permeabilized bacterial systems for the production of kilogram quantities of nucleotide-sugars are becoming available (19Koizumi S. Endo T. Tabata K. Ozaki A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 847-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Even though the costs of these fine biochemicals may be higher than simpler organic chemicals and synthetic reagents, the reduced number of reaction steps, the higher overall yields, and the avoidance of toxic materials lowers the overall economic differential between a “standard” and a chemoenzymatic carbohydrate synthesis. As noted earlier, the initial discovery experiments implying that small HA chains had interesting biological properties utilized mixtures of oligosaccharides prepared by partial digestion of high molecular weight HA polysaccharide with degradative enzymes. Such protocols typically suffer from poor reproducibility and low yields of the target species (e.g. one length in the range of HA10–HA20). Some HA chains are cleaved too much (the limit digest is HA4), resulting in inactive fragments, whereas other HA chains are not sufficiently fragmented, resulting in longer molecules which might possibly counteract the desirable effect of the shorter target HA oligosaccharides. Recently, two groups have reported anion-exchange chromatography purification schemes to separate desirable HA oligosaccharides from partial digests (20Tawada A. Masa T. Oonuki Y. Watanabe A. Matsuzaki Y. Asari A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 21Mahoney D.J. Aplin R.T. Calabro A. Hascall V.C. Day A.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, in these reports, only HA-derived materials were isolated, and the processes relied on chromatographic separations which may be difficult to scale up. In addition to being an advance in carbohydrate synthesis, this work also yields basic science knowledge with respect to elucidating the mechanism of GAG synthesis in Pasteurella. Two modes of polymer synthesis are possible: (i) processive (i.e. nascent polymer is retained by the glycosyltransferase until the chain is completed), or (ii) nonprocessive (i.e. nascent polymer is repetitively bound and released by the glycosyltransferase). In our immobilized reactor format, the HA oligosaccharide must be bound transiently to a mutant synthase, extended by one sugar, and released before the oligosaccharide is acted on by a second mutant synthase. The rapidity and the efficiency of our chemoenzymatic synthesis implies that the pm-HAS catalyst elongates the HA polymer in a nonprocessive fashion. To form the long HA polysaccharide chains (∼103 sugars) observed in the Pasteurella bacterial capsule, other proteins or components of the polymer transport apparatus probably assist in vivo with chain retention, because this property does not seem to be an intrinsic characteristic of pmHAS. Previously, we showed that reactions containing a mixture of two mutant enzymes (i.e. a GlcNAc-Tase and a GlcUA-Tase) formed HA polymers relatively efficiently in comparison to wild type (15Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 16Jing, W., and DeAngelis, P. L. (2003) Glycobiology, in pressGoogle Scholar). One explanation for this observation is that two pmHAS monomers actually form the active catalytic species, and the two polypeptides cooperate to perform the reaction; a lesion in any one site would be compensated by employing a pair of molecules. However, based on the success of the reactor synthesis, pmHAS must act as a monomer, because the two mutant enzymes are immobilized in separate locations that cannot physically interact. Our chemoenzymatic route also allows the use of modified acceptor molecules. For example, previously we elongated radiolabeled acceptor (HA4 reduced with borotritide) into longer HA chains (14DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26557-26562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), but the foreign moiety at the reducing terminus of the HA polymer could instead be a drug or another polymer to enhance therapeutic effect. The pmHAS wild-type enzyme and pmHAS-based transferases described here only transfer authentic HA monosaccharides from UDP-sugars; the C4 epimer analogs (i.e. galactose-based) and UDP-glucose do not substitute (22DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Drake R.R. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8454-8458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In the future, we expect that mutant enzymes suitable for reactors will be developed to catalyze the incorporation of unnatural sugars to form new molecules with altered biological activity and/or useful chemical properties. Overall, our chemoenzymatic synthesis platform opens up a wide spectrum of new biomedical applications. The creation of single molecular entities, HA12 through HA20, is the tip of the iceberg of possibilities.

The chondroitin sulfate portion of this receptor is essential for high affinity binding to pleiotrophin. Here, we purified phosphacan, which corresponds to the extracellular domain of PTPζ, from postnatal day 7 (P7) and P12 rat cerebral cortex (PG-P7 and PG-P12, respectively) and from P20 rat whole brain (PG-P20). The chondroitin sulfate of these preparations displayed immunologically and compositionally different structures. In particular, only PG-P20 reacted with the monoclonal antibody MO-225, which recognizes chondroitin sulfate containing the GlcA(2S)β1–3GalNAc(6S) disaccharide unit (D unit). Analysis of the chondroitinase digestion products revealed that GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4S) disaccharide unit (A unit) was the major component in these preparations and that PG-P20 contained 1.3% D unit, which was not detected in PG-P7 and PG-P12. Interaction analysis using a surface plasmon resonance biosensor indicated that PG-P20 had ∼5-fold stronger affinity for pleiotrophin (dissociation constant (KD) = 0.14 nm) than PG-P7 and PG-P12, although all these preparations showed similar low affinity binding to pleiotrophin after chondroitinase ABC digestion (KD = 1.4 ∼ 1.6 nm). We also found that shark cartilage chondroitin sulfate D containing ∼20% D unit bound to pleiotrophin with moderate affinity (KD = 2.7 nm), whereas whale cartilage chondroitin sulfate A showed no binding to this growth factor. These results suggest that variation of chondroitin sulfate plays important roles in the regulation of signal transduction in the brain.

Recent studies reveal that proteoglycans play pivotal roles in various developmental processes such as cell migration, recognition, and morphogenesis (1Lander A.D. Selleck S.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 2Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 3Sugahara K. Kitagawa H.

Accumulating evidence suggests that glycosaminoglycans with specific sequences selectively bind with a wide range of proteins including growth factors, morphogens, and proteases, regulating their biological activities (1Lander A.D. Selleck S.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 2Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 3Sugahara K.

Rev. 2000; 80: 1267-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Although this paradigm is principally derived from the findings on heparan sulfate proteoglycans, increasing evidence suggests that chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans also play such roles (3Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 518-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). PTPζ 1The abbreviations used are: PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; CS, chondroitin sulfate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; P, postnatal day; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ABC, avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex. is a receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase abundantly expressed in the brain as a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (5Maeda N.

S. A. 1994; 91: 2512-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of this receptor is secreted in the brain as a major soluble chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan called phosphacan/6B4 proteoglycan/DSD-1-PG (6Maurel P. Rauch U. Flad M.

The binding of pleiotrophin to PTPζ depends on the chondroitin sulfate portion of this receptor, and removal of chondroitin sulfate resulted in a drastic decrease in the binding affinity and signal transduction (9Maeda N.

Chem. 2001; 276: 15868-15875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This binding was inhibited strongly by squid cartilage chondroitin sulfate E (CS-E) and shark cartilage CS-D, moderately by shark cartilage CS-C, and very weakly by whale cartilage CS-A (9Maeda N.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). An in vitro cell migration assay indicated that pleiotrophin induces migration of cortical neurons (10Maeda N. Noda M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This activity of pleiotrophin was also inhibited by CS-C, -D, and -E but not by CS-A. Furthermore, using an organotypic slice culture system of the rat cerebellum, we revealed that disruption of PTPζ-pleiotrophin signaling leads to the aberrant morphogenesis of Purkinje cells (12Tanaka M. Maeda N. Noda M. Marunouchi T. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2804-2814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The number of Purkinje cells with abnormal dendrites such as multiple and disoriented dendrites markedly increased when cerebellar slices were treated with polyclonal antibodies against PTPζ, chondroitinase ABC, CS-C, CS-D, or CS-E, whereas CS-A was also ineffective in this system (12Tanaka M. Maeda N. Noda M. Marunouchi T. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2804-2814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggested that a specific structural motif containing oversulfated portion in chondroitin sulfate is involved in the high affinity binding between PTPζ and pleiotrophin and their signal transduction. Recently, Deepa et al. (13Deepa S.S. Umehara Y. Higashiyama S. Itoh N. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43707-43716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) report that squid cartilage CS-E interacted with various heparin binding growth factors. CS-E bound strongly to pleiotrophin, midkine, fibroblast growth factor-16 (FGF-16), FGF-18, and heparin binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor with comparable affinities to those of heparin (13Deepa S.S. Umehara Y. Higashiyama S. Itoh N. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43707-43716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Zou et al. (14Zou P. Zou K. Muramatsu H. Ichihara-Tanaka K. Habuchi O. Ohtake S. Ikematsu S. Sakuma S. Muramatsu T. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) also found that chondroitin sulfate artificially enriched with E unit (GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4S,6S)) bound strongly with midkine, which shows a 45% amino acid sequence identity to pleiotrophin, forming a heparin binding growth factor family together with this protein. However, these chondroitin sulfate preparations contained unusually high amounts of oversulfated disaccharide units (more than 60% was E unit), which are only minor components in the brain (15Ueoka C. Kaneda N. Okazaki I. Nadanaka S. Muramatsu T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37407-37413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In fact, Ueoka et al. (15Ueoka C. Kaneda N. Okazaki I. Nadanaka S. Muramatsu T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37407-37413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) report that chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan from embryonic day 18 rat brain contained only 1.7% D (GlcA(2S)β1–3GalNAc(6S)) and 1.2% E units. Thus, to evaluate the contribution of the chondroitin sulfate structure to the signal transduction of phosphacan/PTPζ, it is necessary to use proteoglycan samples purified from the brain. It has been suggested that phosphacan is composed of several subpopulations of molecules bearing chondroitin sulfate chains with different structures (16Rauch U. Gao P. Janetzko A. Flaccus A. Hilgenberg L. Tekotte H. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14785-14801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Clement A.M. Nadanaka S. Masayama K. Mandl C. Sugahara K. Faissner A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28444-28453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In this study we found that the immunological and compositional structure of chondroitin sulfate of phosphacan changed dramatically during development of the brain. Using a BIAcore system we observed that the binding affinity of phosphacan for pleiotrophin highly depends on the structure of chondroitin sulfate, especially on the presence of D unit. Our observations suggest that structural variation of chondroitin sulfate plays important roles in the regulation of signal transduction. Materials—Human recombinant pleiotrophin was purchased from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN). CS-A from whale cartilage (average molecular mass 34 kDa), CS-B from pig skin (average molecular mass 32 kDa), CS-C (average molecular mass 64 kDa) and CS-D (average molecular mass 30 kDa) from shark cartilage, CS-E from squid cartilage (average molecular mass 70 kDa), chondroitinase ABC, chondroitinase AC-II, unsaturated chondro-disaccharide kit, monoclonal anti-chondroitin sulfate A (2H6), and monoclonal anti-chondroitin sulfate D (MO-225) were purchased from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). Heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa (average molecular mass 14 kDa) was obtained from Calbiochem. YMC pack PA-03 column was purchased from YMC Co (Kyoto, Japan). Monoclonal anti-chondroitin sulfate (CS-56), QuantiPro BCA assay kit, and actinase E were purchased from Sigma. Vectastain ABC kit was from Vector Labs (Burlingame, CA). Immobilon membrane and Microcon YM-30 were purchased from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase and Sepharose CL-6B were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. A research grade sensor chip CM5 and an amine coupling kit containing N-hydroxysuccinimide, N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride, and 1 m ethanolamine hydrochloride were purchased from Biacore AB (Uppsala, Sweden). The biosensing system used for surface plasmon resonance measurements consisted of BIAcore 1000 and BIAevaluation software 3.2 (Biacore AB). Phosphacan/6B4 proteoglycan was purified from rat brain as described previously (18Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Oohira A. Noda M. Neuroscience. 1995; 67: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against phosphacan/6B4 proteoglycan (anti-6B4PG) were prepared as described previously (5Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Shintani T. Nishiwaki T. Noda M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry—After ether anesthesia, BALB/c mice were perfused with a solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, via the left ventricle. The solution was washed out from the right atrium, and the brains were dissected out and embedded in paraffin after dehydration through a graded alcohol series. Paraffin-embedded samples were cut into sections 6-μm thick, which were then deparaffinized and equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The sections were incubated sequentially in the following solutions: 1) 2.5% H2O2, PBS for 30 min; 2) 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 4% goat serum, PBS for 30 min; 3) primary antibody solution diluted in 1% BSA, PBS (1:100) for 60 min; 4) biotinylated anti-mouse IgM solution for 60 min; 5) ABC solution for 30 min; and 6) 0.1% diaminobenzidine, 0.02% hydrogen peroxide, PBS. A Vectastain ABC kit was used according to the supplier's protocol. Immunoblotting—Purified phosphacan/6B4 proteoglycan (1 μg) was precipitated with 3 volumes of ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate and then dissolved in 20 μl of the solution containing 30 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm pepstatin A, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The samples were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 2 mIU of protease-free chondroitinase ABC and then mixed with the same volume of 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. The samples were boiled for 5 min and processed for 5% SDS-PAGE, and then the proteins were transferred to Immobilon membranes as described previously (18Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Oohira A. Noda M. Neuroscience. 1995; 67: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The membranes were soaked in 3% BSA, Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 60 min and then incubated in 0.1% BSA, TBS containing a mouse monoclonal anti-chondroitin sulfate A (2H6; 1:100), a mouse monoclonal anti-chondroitin sulfate D (MO-225; 1:100), a mouse monoclonal anti-chondroitin sulfate (CS-56; 1:100), or rabbit anti-6B4PG (1:500). The membranes were washed 3 times with 0.05% Tween 20, TBS and then incubated for 30 min with biotinylated anti-mouse IgM (1:200; for 2H6, MO-225, and CS-56) or biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; for anti-6B4PG). After washing 3 times with 0.05% Tween 20, TBS, the membranes were incubated for 30 min with streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (1:1000). The membranes were washed 3 times with 0.05% Tween 20, TBS and then treated with 0.3 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium, 0.8 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.5. Characterization of Chondroitin Sulfate—Purified phosphacan (100 nmol as hexuronate) was treated with 0.2 m NaOH at room temperature for 24 h. After neutralization with glacial acetic acid, the sample was digested with 5 μg/ml actinase E at 50 °C for 24 h in the presence of 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. After heating at 100 °C for 3 min, the solution was applied to a Sepharose CL-6B column (7 mm × 30 cm), and the chondroitin sulfate was eluted with 0.4 m ammonium acetate. The size of chondroitin sulfate was estimated from the K av values as described by Wasteson (19Wasteson A. J. Chromatogr. 1971; 59: 89-97Crossref Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Analysis of the disaccharide composition of chondroitin sulfate was performed by the method of Yoshida et al. (20Yoshida K. Miyauchi M. Kikuchi H. Tawada A. Tokuyasu K. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) after chondroitinase ABC digestion of the phosphacan preparations. The disaccharide composition of the preparations were also confirmed by the method reported by Kinoshita and Sugahara (21Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Briefly, phosphacan preparations (30 nmol as hexuronate) were incubated with 10 mIU of chondroitinase AC-II in a total volume of 30 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by heating at 100 °C for 1 min. The samples were dried and derivatized with 2-aminobenzamide, and the excess 2-aminobenzamide reagent was removed by paper chromatography. An aliquot of the 2-aminobenzamide-derivative (1 nmol as GlcUA) was subjected to HPLC on an amine-bound silica PA-03 column (4.6 × 250 mm) using a linear gradient of NaH2PO4 from 16 to 530 mm over 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Eluates were monitored by fluorescence intensity with excitation and emission wavelength of 330 and 420 nm, respectively. Immobilization of Pleiotrophin on the Sensor Surface—Pleiotrophin was immobilized on the surface of a CM5 sensor chip by amine coupling, where the primary amino groups on the protein were coupled to the carboxymethylated dextran on a sensor surface. The carboxymethylated dextran surface on the sensor chip was activated by injection of 35 μl of a mixture of N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysuccinimide (0.2/0.05 m). Then 10 μg/ml pleiotrophin in 10 mm maleate buffer, pH 6.0, was injected onto the activated sensor surface. The remaining unreacted sites were blocked by injecting 35 μl of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. The amounts of pleiotrophin immobilized onto the sensor surface were controlled within the range 3000–4500 resonance units by changing the injection time. All steps were carried out in a continuous flow of a solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20 (HBS running buffer) at 5 μl/min. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—All experiments were carried out at flow rate of 20 μl/min at 25 °C. Buffer exchange of phosphacan solution was performed using Microcon YM-30 by repeated concentration and reconstitution with HBS running buffer. The phosphacan preparations (10 μl of a 200 μg/ml solution) were treated with 25 mIU of protease-free chondroitinase ABC for 1 h at 37 °C. Each sample was diluted in HBS running buffer and injected onto the sensor surface. The sensor surfaces were regenerated with 10 μl of 2 m NaCl after a dissociation phase. To correct for the bulk effects and the nonspecific bindings of samples, the equivalent sample solutions were injected onto an untreated sensor surface, and the obtained responses were subtracted from the pleiotrophin-immobilized sensor surface data. The kinetic parameters were evaluated with BIAevaluation software 3.2 using a 1:1 (Langmuir) binding model. Other Methods—Protein concentration was determined using a QuantiPro BCA assay kit using BSA as a standard. Hexuronate concentration was determined as described by Bitter and Muir (22Bitter T. Muir H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5202) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical Localization of Chondroitin Sulfate Epitopes in the Developing Mouse Brain—To analyze systematically the changes in chondroitin sulfate structure during development of the brain, we immunohistochemically stained the mouse brain sections using three kinds of monoclonal antibodies against native chondroitin sulfate: CS-56, 2H6, and MO-225. Among these monoclonal antibodies, MO-225 specifically recognizes tetrasaccharides containing D unit (23Yamagata M. Kimata K. Oike Y. Tani K. Maeda N. Yoshida K. Shimomura Y. Yoneda M. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4146-4152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CS-56 strongly reacts with whale cartilage CS-A and shark cartilage CS-C (24Avnur Z. Geiger B. Cell. 1984; 38: 811-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and 2H6 selectively recognizes whale cartilage CS-A (25Oohira A. Matsui F. Watanabe E. Kushima Y. Maeda N. Neuroscience. 1994; 60: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar); however, the structures of their epitopes are unknown. Fig. 1 shows the immunohistochemically stained sagittal sections from the brains of postnatal day 7 (P7), P12, and P20 mice. 2H6 and CS-56 epitopes were highly expressed in the P7 cerebral cortex, but their expression in this region decreased thereafter (Fig. 1, Cx). On the other hand, the expression of MO-225 epitope was very low in the cerebral cortex during these postnatal ages. In contrast, the cerebellum was strongly stained by MO-225 from P7 to P20 (Fig. 1, Ce). The expression of CS-56 epitopes was also observed in the P7 and P12 cerebellum, but the expression disappeared in the P20 cerebellar cortex. 2H6 epitope was barely detected in the postnatal cerebellar cortex. These results indicated that the chondroitin sulfate structure changes regionally and developmentally in the mouse brain. Similar results were obtained using sections from the rat brain (data not shown), and a detailed description of the immunohistochemical analysis will be reported elsewhere. Purification of Phosphacan Bearing Chondroitin Sulfate with Different Structures—From the immunohistochemical analysis described above, we anticipated that phosphacan bearing chondroitin sulfate chains with different structures could be purified from the rat brain by selecting appropriate regions and ages, because this molecule is the major chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan in the brain. Our expectations were as follows. 1) Phosphacan samples with low content of D unit would be purified from P7 and P12 cerebral cortex. 2) Phosphacan bearing chondroitin sulfate chains with a substantial amount of D unit would be purified from P20 whole brain. 3) These three phosphacan samples would show different overall chondroitin sulfate structures. Fig. 2 shows the immunoblot analysis of phosphacan samples from P7 cerebral cortex (PG-P7), P12 cerebral cortex (PG-P12), and P20 whole brain (PG-P20). Analysis of the purified phosphacan with the polyclonal antibodies against core protein (anti-6B4 PG) indicated that the sizes of native proteoglycan and core glycoprotein were indistinguishable among these preparations (Fig. 2A). Reactivities to CS-56 and 2H6 monoclonal antibodies were highly detected in PG-P7, moderately in PG-P12 and barely in PG-P20 (Fig. 2, B and C). On the other hand, the MO-225 epitope was highly expressed in PG-P20 but was not detected in PG-P7 and PG-P12 (Fig. 2D). Analysis of the disaccharide composition of each preparation indicated that PG-P20 contained 1.3% D unit, which was not detected in PG-P7 and PG-P12 (Table I). The contents of A unit (GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4S)) and C unit (GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(6S)) were variable among these preparations. In particular, the contents of C unit drastically decreased from P7 to P20 (Table I). Despite the large difference in the disaccharide composition, the chain length of chondroitin sulfate and GlcA contents of the each preparation were not significantly different from each other (Table I).Table ICharacterization of chondroitin sulfate on phosphacan/6B4 proteoglycanPhosphacanΔHexA-GalNAcΔHexA-GalNAc(4S)ΔHexA-GalNAc(6S)ΔHexA(2S)-GalNAc(6S)GlcA contentAverage size of CS%nmol/μg proteinkDaPG-P74.363.632.1ND1.717PG-P122.783.214.1ND1.818PG-P206.985.86.01.31.620 Open table in a new tab Analysis of Interaction between Phosphacan and Pleiotrophin with the BIAcore System—Real-time analysis of the interaction between phosphacan and pleiotrophin was performed using the BIAcore system. Various concentrations of phosphacan samples were passed over the CM5 sensor chip containing immobilized pleiotrophin, and the change in response was evaluated as a function of time (Fig. 3). The binding of phosphacan to pleiotrophin was monitored by the increase in the response with time up to 12 min, which corresponds to the association phase. This phase was followed by a dissociation phase generated by the stream flowing over the sensor chip containing only running buffer. The affinity of phosphacan for pleiotrophin was quantified by determining the dissociation constant KD (KD = kd /ka), where kd and ka represent dissociation and association rate constants calculated from the dissociation and association phases, respectively. The sensorgrams of the bindings of PG-P7 and PG-P12 to pleiotrophin were very similar to each other (Fig. 3, A and C), and showed KD values of 0.66 and 0.57 nm, respectively (Table II). PG-P20 exhibited a higher affinity for pleiotrophin (KD = 0.14 nm) than PG-P7 and PG-P12 (Fig. 3E). The association rate constant for the PG-P20-pleiotrophin interaction (ka = 2.0 × 106m–1 s–1) was 3–4-fold faster than those for PG-P7- and PG-P12-pleiotrophin interactions (ka = 5.3 and 6.1 × 105m–1 s–1, respectively) (Table II). On the other hand, their dissociation rate constants were not significantly different from each other (kd = 2.7 ∼ 3.5 × 10–4 s–1).Table IIKinetic parameters for the interaction between phosphacan and pleiotrophinProteinskakdKDRmaxm-1 s-1s-1nmRUPG-P7(5.3 ± 2.6) × 105(3.5 ± 1.7) × 10-40.66 ± 0.09271 ± 26PG-P7-Ch(1.6 ± 0.4) × 105(2.2 ± 0.2) × 10-41.4 ± 0.3533 ± 58PG-P12(6.1 ± 3.1) × 105(3.5 ± 2.0) × 10-40.57 ± 0.11260 ± 6PG-P12-Ch(1.7 ± 0.3) × 105(2.3 ± 0.4) × 10-41.4 ± 0.3504 ± 35PG-P20(2.0 ± 0.5) × 106(2.7 ± 0.8) × 10-40.14 ± 0.05270 ± 26PG-P20-Ch(2.0 ± 0.8) × 105(3.2 ± 0.4) × 10-41.6 ± 0.8525 ± 98 Open table in a new tab When the proteoglycan samples were treated with chondroitinase ABC to remove chondroitin sulfate, their affinities for pleiotrophin remarkably decreased (Fig. 3, B, D, and F), and all the preparations showed similar, relatively low affinity binding to pleiotrophin (KD = 1.4 ∼ 1.6 nm) (Table II). At higher concentrations of phosphacan, the binding of intact proteoglycans reached near equilibrium in the association phase, whereas chondroitinase ABC-treated proteoglycans exhibited a nearly linear increase in responses during the association phase even at the concentration of 1.3 μg/ml (Fig. 3). This was caused mainly by the decrease in the association rate constants of phosphacan-pleiotrophin interaction after chondroitinase ABC digestion (Table II). On the other hand, the values of the dissociation rate constant were barely influenced by the chondroitinase ABC digestion (Table II). All the phosphacan preparations displayed similar values of association and dissociation rate constants after chondroitinase ABC digestion (ka = 1.6 ∼ 2.0 × 105m–1 s–1 and kd = 2.2 ∼ 3.2 × 10–4 s–1). These results indicated that the presence of chondroitin sulfate critically influences the association rate, and the value of this rate constant is regulated by the structural variation of chondroitin sulfate chains. It is noteworthy that the calculated values of R max, which correspond to the maximum responses reached after equilibrium, increased ∼2-fold after chondroitinase ABC digestion of the phosphacan preparations. This might be caused by the decrease in steric hindrance after chondroitinase ABC digestion, where intact proteoglycans cannot efficiently use the ligands immobilized in the carboxymethylated dextran matrix because of their large molecular size. Analysis of the Interaction between Glycosaminoglycans and Pleiotrophin with the BIAcore System—The experiments described above indicated that the structural differences in chondroitin sulfate chains regulate the binding affinity of phosphacan for pleiotrophin. Thus, we analyzed the interaction of various chondroitin sulfate preparations with pleiotrophin using the BIAcore system. The measurements were performed for whale cartilage CS-A, pig skin CS-B, shark cartilage CS-C, shark cartilage CS-D, and squid cartilage CS-E, and these preparations exhibited quite characteristic sensorgrams (Fig. 4). Among these chondroitin sulfate samples, CS-E showed the strongest affinity for pleiotrophin with a KD of 0.76 nm (Fig. 4E and Table III). Deepa et al. (13Deepa S.S. Umehara Y. Higashiyama S. Itoh N.

https://openalex.org/W2036804729,"The dioxin receptor (DR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that is activated upon binding of dioxins or structurally related forms of xenobiotics. Upon binding ligand the DR translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it complexes with the partner protein Arnt to form a DNA binding heterodimer, which activates transcription of target genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism. Latency of the DR signaling pathway is maintained by association of the DR with a number of molecular chaperones including the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90), the hepatitis B virus X-associated protein (XAP2), and the 23-kDa heat shock protein (p23). Here we investigated the role of XAP2 in DR signaling and demonstrated that reduced levels of XAP2 labilize the DR, arguing for a function of XAP2 beyond its reported role as a cytoplasmic retention factor. In addition, we showed that a constitutively nuclear DR is degraded in the nucleus and does not require nuclear export for efficient degradation. We also provided evidence implicating the ubiquitin ligase protein C-terminal hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP) in the degradation of the DR, and we demonstrated that this degradation can be overcome by overexpression of XAP2. XAP2 protection of CHIP-mediated degradation is dependent on the tetratricopeptide repeat domain of XAP2 and suggests a mechanism whereby competition for the C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat acceptor site of hsp90 guides the protein triage decision, the point of determination for either maturation of DR folding or DR degradation.

Members of this protein family are classified by the presence of PAS domains that can accept cellular or environmental signals and/or function as secondary dimerization interfaces (1Huang Z.J.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3528-3539Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). PAS family members respond to various environmental cues including xenobiotics (DR), hypoxia (hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs)), as well as participating in the light entrainment process to regulate the circadian cycle (CLOCK and BMAL). As a consequence of the important signal sensing roles placed upon the bHLH/PAS factors, intricate levels of regulation have been incorporated to control protein activity and transcriptional output. For example, the HIFs are regulated by several hydroxylation events, performed by up to five separate enzymes (prolyl hydroxylases 1–4 and factor inhibiting HIF-1), to regulate HIF protein stability and transactivation capacity (3Ivan M.

Nature. 2002; 418: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (3283) Google Scholar). However, the DR is unique in the family so far in that it is the only member regulated by ligand, which acts to transform the cytosolically localized latent receptor complex into a nuclear DNA-bound complex with the bHLH/PAS heterodimeric partner protein Arnt (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator). This transformation process is regulated in large part by the association of the DR with the molecular chaperone hsp90, which is thought to maintain cytosolic localization by masking the N-terminal nuclear localization sequence of the DR (12Ikuta T.

XAP2 is a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-containing protein, displaying homology to the immunophilin proteins FKBP51 and FKBP52 present in steroid hormone receptor complexes. TPR motifs are 34-amino acid residue repeat regions that form a predominantly α-helical structural unit that acts as a protein-protein interaction domain (27Das A.K. Cohen P.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). As yet, no definite function has been assigned to the immunophilin proteins present in the steroid hormone receptor complexes, although current models posit a role for nuclear trafficking via the cytoskeletal protein dynein, which is reliant on the peptidylprolyl isomerase domain of the protein (28Galigniana M.D. Radanyi C.

Original reports demonstrated an increase in DR signaling in XAP2 overexpression studies in both yeast and mammalian systems. This has subsequently been shown to be a result of increased DR stability (30Meyer B.K. Perdew G.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8907-8917Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 31LaPres J.J.

Overexpression of XAP2 in transient assay systems leads to decreased levels of DR ubiquitination (32Kazlauskas A. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41317-41324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar); however, this mechanism has yet to be fully elucidated. Further studies have suggested a role for XAP2 in maintaining cytoplasmic localization of the DR (31LaPres J.J. Glover E. Dunham E.E. Bunger M.K. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6153-6159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 33Petrulis J.R. Hord N.G. Perdew G.H. J. Biol.

It is proposed that they act by chaperoning hydrophobic patches on client proteins to inhibit aggregation within the cell, in addition to acting as a chaperone to achieve correct folding into a functional three-dimensional structure (35Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). Client proteins can either transiently associate with an ordered succession of components of the chaperone system and then be released upon successful maturation of the protein, or alternatively they can maintain a permanent association with a chaperone (typically hsp90) once the substrate protein has reached maturation. The DR is placed within the latter class of hsp90 substrate proteins. Recently a TPR-containing protein, CHIP (C-terminal hsp70-interacting protein), was isolated from a yeast two-hybrid screen by its ability to interact with the C-terminal region of the molecular chaperone protein hsp70 (36Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). In addition to containing TPR motifs, CHIP contains a U box domain that has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (37Jiang J. Ballinger C.A. Wu Y. Dai Q. Cyr D.M. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42938-42944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) to mediate the degradation of substrate proteins, so far including the GR (38Connell P. Ballinger C.A.

Band V. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13829-13837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). CHIP is proposed to act at the level of protein triage decision making during the maturation of molecular chaperone substrates, i.e. it acts as a crucial component of the process to either continue chaperone-mediated folding of a substrate protein or, if a protein is unlikely to reach the correctly folded structure, it acts to degrade the substrate by ubiquitin-mediated degradation (42Hohfeld J. Cyr D.M. Patterson C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 43Cyr D.M. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms that control this decision making process are poorly understood. Here we investigate the role of XAP2 in the DR activation process. By using cytoplasmic and nuclear localized forms of the DR, in conjunction with antisense XAP2, we show that XAP2 depletion ablates DR transcriptional output by means of increased degradation of the DR. In addition we provide evidence of a role for CHIP in ubiquitin-mediated turnover of the DR, and we show this process requires the TPR domain of CHIP. Overexpression of XAP2 inhibits this degradation, whereas a TPR deletion mutant of XAP2 fails to do so. These data suggest a model for which the protein triage decision process is mediated by a competition between opposing TPR proteins. Plasmids—The DR-NLS/IRES/puro (44Lees M.J. Whitelaw M.L. Mol.

PCR was performed using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and the following conditions: 94 °C 30 s, followed by 30 cycles of (94 °C, 30 s; 60 °C, 15 s; and 72 °C, 3 min) and a final 5-min extension step of 72 °C. XAP2 constructs were subcloned into the pCDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) using EcoRI/XbaI restriction sites, whereas the CHIP constructs were subcloned into pcDNA3 using EcoRI/XhoI restriction sites. Constructs in the pcDNA3 vectors were sequenced to verify sequence integrity. Cell Lines and Cell Culture—Mouse adrenal Y1 cells and the human embryonic kidney transformed cell line 293T were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The 293T/DR cell line was generated in the same manner as the previously described 293T/DR-NLS cell line (44Lees M.J. Whitelaw M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5811-5822Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Transient Transfections—The transient transfection protocol has been described previously (44Lees M.J. Whitelaw M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5811-5822Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) for a period of 24 h followed by an overnight treatment with 10 nm TCDD or vehicle control, after which time extracts were analyzed using the Dual Luciferase Reagent assay system (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions, or analyzed by SDS-PAGE to determine XAP2myc expression. The amount of plasmid DNA transfected into each well was normalized by the addition of empty pEFBOS vector. Transfections were performed a minimum of three times. For transfection of CHIP and XAP2 mutant constructs, 293T cells were transfected in 6-well trays using LipofectAMINE-2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction for a period of 24 h. DNA content was normalized using empty pcDNA3 vector. Immunoblotting and Antibodies—Whole cell extracts and the generation of cytosolic and nuclear extracts for immunoblotting were prepared as described (13Whitelaw M.L. Gottlicher M. Gustafsson J.A. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4169-4179Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 44Lees M.J. Whitelaw M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5811-5822Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The amount of protein loaded for 7.5 (for DR-NLS) or 10% (for CHIP and XAP2 constructs) SDS-PAGE analysis is indicated in the figure legends. Following transfer, membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 10% milk, PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma). Membranes were then incubated with primary antibody overnight followed by washing with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (3 times for 5 min) and a 45-min incubation with either a goat anti-rabbit or rabbit anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Dako). Membranes were washed (3 times for 5 min) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Anti-CHIP polyclonal antibodies (40Imai Y. Soda M. Hatakeyama S. Akagi T. Hashikawa T. Nakayama K.I. Takahashi R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) were a gift from R. Takahashi (Riken Brain Institute, Japan); anti-DR RPT-1 mAb was a gift from Garry Perdew (Pennsylvania State University), and 12CA5 (αHa) and 9E10 (αMyc) mAbs were from the antibody generating facility at IMVS Adelaide, Australia. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Arnt antibodies were generated against thioredoxin fusion proteins containing the final 100 amino acids of human Arnt. Fluorescence Microscopy—For analysis of Rev-GFP localization, Y1/DR-NLS cells were seeded into 6-well trays 24 h before being transfected with 5 μg of the Rev-GFP plasmid using 10 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 per well. Cells were transfected for a period of 6 h, followed by treatment with leptomycin B (LMB) (20 μg/ml final) for 4 h. Cells were then washed twice with PBS, stained with Hoechst stain 33342 diluted in water (2.5 μg/ml final), and visualized with a Nikon TE 300 microscope. In Vitro Interaction Assays—To investigate the interaction between the DR-NLS complex and CHIP or CHIPΔTPR, [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were generated using the T7-coupled reticulocyte translation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reactions contained 10 μl of CHIP or CHIPΔTPR and were incubated with 10 μl of the DR-NLS protein and 80 μl of PBS; Mg132 was added to a final concentration of 50 μm, and reactions were left for 30 min at room temperature with occasional agitation. Following the incubation, the reactions were immunoprecipitated with the 12CA5 mAb (5 μg) in a 500-μl volume of IP buffer (final concentrations of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% milk powder) for 2 h at 4 °C. The complexes were separated by protein A-Sepharose (40 μl of a 1:1 slurry), followed by 2 times for 5 min washes with 500 μl of IP buffer. Proteins were removed from the Sepharose by boiling in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gels were then dried and exposed to film. Characterization of Stable Cell Lines Expressing Cytosolic and Nuclear Localized Forms of the DR—Previous studies investigating the role of XAP2 in DR signaling have only analyzed DR function during overexpression of XAP2. In order to explore the role of XAP2 in the DR activation pathway, we decided to deplete levels of endogenous cellular XAP2 using an antisense strategy and to investigate the effects on wild type DR and a constitutively nuclear form of the DR (DR-NLS). The constitutively nuclear DR contains a heterologous NLS and maintains its latent state bound to hsp90, thus requiring ligand for activation (44Lees M.J. Whitelaw M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5811-5822Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To compare potential differences between the cytosolic and nuclear localized forms of the DR, 293T stable cell lines expressing wild type DR or DR-NLS were generated (Fig. 1A). Immunoblots of whole cell extracts from the engineered cells demonstrate that the DR proteins were successfully expressed (Fig. 1B), and cell fractionation procedures show that the DR-NLS protein is recovered entirely in the nuclear fraction of the cell, whereas the wild type DR is present in both in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions (Fig. 1C). This observation could result as a function of overexpression of the DR overriding the normal cytosolic retention mechanism or, alternatively, could be due to the recent observation that the DR can shuttle between the cytosolic and nuclear compartments of the cell in a variety of cell types (48Singh S.S. Hord N.G. Perdew G.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 329: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 49Richter C.A. Tillitt D.E. Hannink M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 389: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), a phenomenon which is overcome in the DR-NLS protein by virtue of the heterologous nucleoplasmin nuclear localization sequence. Following confirmation of expression of both of the constructs in the stable lines, the cells were characterized for their responsiveness to the prototypical DR ligand, TCDD (dioxin). The cell lines were transfected with the XIXI luciferase reporter plasmid containing XRE sequences from the Cyp1A1 promoter (Fig. 1D). The stable cell lines containing either the wild type or nuclear localized DR gave a robust response to ligand on the XRE-driven reporter (Fig. 1E). In addition, the basal activity of the luciferase reporter was not significantly different between the DR and the DR-NLS construct, reaffirming the inability of the DR-NLS construct to act in the absence of ligand (44Lees M.J. Whitelaw M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5811-5822Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). XAP2 Depletion Abrogates DR Signaling—XAP2 has been suggested previously to play a role in stabilization of overexpressed DR. This model has been derived from several observations, including co-expression of XAP2 and DR in transient transfection assays leading to a 2-fold increase in DR protein levels and induction from DR target genes compared with expression of DR alone (30Meyer B.K. Perdew G.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8907-8917Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 31LaPres J.J. Glover E. Dunham E.E. Bunger M.K. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6153-6159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition, co-expression of XAP2 has been demonstrated to lead to a decrease in ubiquitinated forms of the DR (32Kazlauskas A. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41317-41324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Moreover, XAP2 has been suggested to be involved in the maintenance of a correctly chaperoned DR complex in order for the DR to be capable of interacting with the nuclear import machinery (50Petrulis J.R. Kusnadi A. Ramadoss P. Hollingshead B. Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2677-2685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We decided to address the function of XAP2 in DR signaling by using the 293T/DR-NLS cell line in combination with an antisense-based XAP2 depletion approach, to investigate whether XAP2 depletion can affect signaling through a nuclear localized DR. To this end we generated an expression vector that expressed the non-coding strand of XAP2 mRNA driven by the powerful elongation factor 1α promoter. Increasing amounts of the vector were transfected into the 293T/DR or 293T/DR-NLS cell lines, in combination with the XRE-luciferase reporter gene, pXIXI, for 24 h followed by overnight treatment with TCDD or vehicle control. In the absence of the antisense expression vector, TCDD gave a robust induction for both the DR and DR-NLS constructs (Fig. 2, A and B). Strikingly, with increasing amounts of antisense XAP2 expression vector, the rep"

To explore the nature of ezrin phosphorylation, proteins from resting and secreting gastric glands were subjected to two-dimensional SDS-PAGE. Histamine triggers acid secretion and a series of acidic isoforms of ezrin on two-dimensional SDS-PAGE. Mass spectrometric analysis of these acidic ezrin spots induced by stimulation suggests that Ser66 is phosphorylated. To determine whether Ser66 is a substrate of protein kinase A (PKA), recombinant proteins of ezrin, both wild type and S66A mutant, were incubated with the catalytic subunit of PKA and [32P]ATP. Incorporation of 32P into wild type but not the mutant ezrin verified that Ser66 is a substrate of PKA. In addition, expression of S66A mutant ezrin in cultured parietal cells attenuates the dilation of apical vacuolar membrane associated with stimulation by histamine, indicating that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of ezrin is necessary for acid secretion. In fact, expression of phosphorylation-like S66D mutant in parietal cells mimics histamine-stimulated apical vacuole remodeling. Further examination of H,K-ATPase distribution revealed a blockade of stimulation-induced proton pump mobilization in S66A but not S66D ezrin-expressing parietal cells. These data suggest that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of ezrin plays an important role in mediating the remodeling of the apical membrane cytoskeleton associated with acid secretion in parietal cells.

Ezrin is an actin-binding protein of the ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) 1The abbreviations used are: ERM, ezrin/radixin/moesin; PKA, protein kinase A; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MEM, minimal essential medium; AP, aminopyrine; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase. family of cytoskeleton membrane linker proteins (1Bretscher A. Edwards K. Fehon R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 586-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Within the gastric epithelium, ezrin has been localized exclusively to parietal cells and primarily to the apical canalicular membrane of these cells (e.g. Refs. 2Urushidani T Hanzel D.K. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: G1070-G1081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 3Yao X Forte J.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 103-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Because of its cytolocalization and observed stimulation-dependent phosphorylation, an implied role for ezrin was suggested in the apical surface membrane remodeling associated with parietal cell activation via the protein kinase A pathway. Phosphorylation of ezrin has also been shown to be associated with surface membrane remodeling of A431 cells stimulated by epidermal growth factor, although activation in this case was via protein tyrosine kinase (4Hunter T. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1981; 24: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 5Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Our previous studies showed that gastric ezrin is co-distributed with the β-actin isoform in vivo (6Yao X. Chaponnier C. Gabbiani G. Forte J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 541-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and preferentially bound to the β-actin isoform in vitro (7Yao X. Cheng L. Forte J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7224-7229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, it is still not clear how ezrin is involved in the membrane cytoskeletal dynamics triggered by histamine stimulation. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer monitored by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and chemotaxis assays (8Legg J.W. Lewis C.A. Parsons M. Ng T. Isacke C.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), it has been shown that protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of CD44 and ezrin modulates the interaction between these two proteins in vivo and that this phosphorylation was critical for CD44-directed cell motility, suggesting that phosphorylation of ezrin and its accessory proteins provides means to regulate the membrane cytoskeletal dynamics in response to stimulation. Whereas protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of CD44 was mapped to Ser291, the nature of ezrin phosphorylation is not characterized. Phosphorylation has been proposed to regulate ERM activation, since phosphorylation of ERM proteins correlates with their cytoskeletal association, whereas dephosphorylation of ezrin is parallel to its liberation from actin-based cytoskeleton (e.g. Refs. 9Chen J. Cohn J.A. Mandel L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7495-7499Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar and 10Urushidani T. Hanzel D.K. Forte J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 930: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Ezrin is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon growth factor stimulation (11Gould K.L. Bretscher A. Esch F.S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4133-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 12Fazioli F. Wong W.T. Ullrich S.J. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Di Fiore P.P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1335-1345PubMed Google Scholar, 13Crepaldi T. Gautreau A. Comoglio P.M. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In response to epidermal growth factor, ezrin phosphorylation on tyrosines 145 and 353 is concomitant with an increase in dimer formation, suggesting a causal relationship between phosphorylation and oligomerization (14Krieg J. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19258-19265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Berryman M Gary R. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1231-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, mutations of these tyrosines into phenylalanines does not alter ezrin localization in microvilli, and production of this mutated ezrin does not affect cell morphology (13Crepaldi T. Gautreau A. Comoglio P.M. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been proposed that tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin may serve in signal transduction rather than mediating its cytoskeletal association. This notion was supported by the experiments in which phosphorylation of tyrosine 353 was found to signal cell survival during epithelial differentiation (16Gautreau A. Poullet P. Louvard D. Arpin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7300-7305Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). A phosphothreonine residue, originally identified in moesin (17Nakamura F. Amieva M.R. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31377-31385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), is localized in a conserved COOH-terminal region of ERM proteins (Thr567 in ezrin, Thr564 in radixin, and Thr558 in moesin). Using phosphospecific antibodies, this phosphorylated residue was detected in ezrin, radixin, and moesin from a variety of cells and tissues, and phosphorylated ERM proteins were shown to be present in actin-rich membrane structures (18Nakamura F. Amieva M.R. Hirota C. Mizuno Y. Furthmayr H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 650-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K.

Two kinases, protein kinase C and Rho kinase, and two phosphatases, myosin phosphatase and PP2C, were found in different systems to regulate the phosphorylation status of the conserved C-terminal threonine in ERM proteins (19Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 21Hishiya A. Ohnishi M. Tamura S. Nakamura F. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7594-7603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The primary consequence of phosphorylating the COOH-terminal threonine is thought to regulate ezrin activity. Using an overlay assay, phosphorylation of Thr564 in the radixin COOH-terminal domain impaired its association with the NH2-terminal domain (19Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Similarly, a T558D mutation of moesin, which mimics the phosphorylated state, was shown to alter the intra- and intermolecular interactions of ezrin (24Huang L. Wong T.Y. Lin R.C. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12803-12810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). From the crystal structure, it appears that the phosphorylation of moesin Thr558 weakens the N/C-ERMAD interaction due to both electrostatic and steric effects (25Pearson M.A. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Karplus P.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of an isolated COOH-terminal fragment of ERM proteins does not affect its association with F-actin (19Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 24Huang L. Wong T.Y. Lin R.C. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12803-12810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, expression of Thr → Asp mutant forms of ezrin or moesin potentiates the formation of microvilli-like dorsal projections by growth factors (20Oshiro N. Fukata Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34663-34666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 26Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1497-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), whereas transfection of the nonphosphorylatable T558A moesin inhibits RhoA-induced formation of these structures (20Oshiro N. Fukata Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34663-34666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 27Shaw R.J. Henry M. Solomon F. Jacks T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 403-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To explore the nature of ezrin phosphorylation associated with histamine-mediated stimulation of acid secretion, we carried out mass spectrometric analyses of ezrin phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro to identify a novel phosphorylation site on ezrin. Our studies show that Ser66 is a substrate of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and suggest that phosphorylation of Ser66 by PKA is critical for parietal cell activation. Given the fact that nonphosphorylatable ezrin prevents parietal cell activation, we proposed that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of ezrin provides a link between the activation of PKA to apical membrane cytoskeletal remodeling associated with acid secretion in parietal cells. Reagents—[14C]Aminopyrine and [32P]ATP were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Monoclonal antibody (JL-18) against rGFP was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA), whereas ezrin antibody 4A5 was produced and described by Hanzel et al. (28Hanzel D.K. Urushidani T. Usinger W.R. Smolka A. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: G1082-G1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody 2G11 against the β-subunit of HK-ATPase was described by Chow et al. (29Chow D.C. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1562-C1570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody against phosphoserine and all chemicals were ordered from Sigma. Rhodamine-coupled phalloidin was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). LipofectAMINE 2000 was obtained from Invitrogen. DNA Construction—The bacterial expression vectors containing human ezrin fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) were generous gifts from Dr. Monique Arpin. GFP-ezrin was constructed by ligating an EcoRI-SalI PCR-amplified ezrin cDNA into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). GFP-tagged ezrin mutations S66A and S66D were created by standard PCR methods and a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer's manual using the following primers: S66D (forward), 5′-AAG AAG GTG GAT GCC CAG GAG GTC A-3′; S66D (reverse), 5′-ATC CAG CTT CAG CCA GGT AGG AAA T-3′; S66A (forward), 5′-AAG AAG GTG GCT GCC CAG GAG GTC A-3′; S66A (reverse), 5′-ATC CAG CTT CAG CCA GGT AGG AAA T-3′. The S66D mutant was created to mimic phosphorylated ezrin, whereas S66A was generated as nonphosphorylatable ezrin. All constructs were sequenced in full. Isolation of Gastric Glands and Aminopyrine Uptake Assay—Gastric glands were isolated from New Zealand White rabbits as modified by Yao et al. (30Yao X Thibodeau A. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C36-C46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the rabbit stomach was perfused under high pressure with PBS (2.25 mm K2HPO4, 6 mm Na2HPO4, 1.75 mm NaH2PO4, and 136 mm NaCl) containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgSO4. The gastric mucosa was scraped from the smooth muscle layer, minced, and then washed twice with minimal essential medium (MEM) buffered with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (HEPES-MEM). The minced mucosa was then digested at 37 °C for ∼30 min in a minimal amount (∼20 ml) of HEPES-MEM containing 15 mg of collagenase (Sigma) and 20 mg each of bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Intact gastric glands were collected from the digestion mixture for 10–15 min and then washed three times in HEPES-MEM. In all subsequent gland experiments (aminopyrine uptake assay and two-dimensional SDS-PAGE analysis), glands were resuspended at 5% cytocrit (v/v) in the appropriate buffer for final assay. Stimulation of rabbit gastric glands was quantified using the aminopyrine (AP) uptake assay as modified by Yao et al. (30Yao X Thibodeau A. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C36-C46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, glands were loaded with [14C]aminopyrine followed by treatment with 100 μm cimetidine. Stimulation of glands was achieved with 50 μm IBMX and 100 μm histamine. Gland preparations were incubated for different time intervals at 37 °C with shaking (∼160 oscillation/min) followed by a brief spin to separate the glands from supernatant. The gland pellets were dried and weighed, and aliquots of both the supernatant and pellet were counted in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. These data were used to calculate the AP accumulation ratio (ratio of intracellular to extracellular AP concentration) as described (30Yao X Thibodeau A. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C36-C46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To calculate the stimulation index of AP uptake, the data are expressed as a -fold level of the resting control from each individual time points. Extract Preparation and Two-dimensional Electrophoresis—Gastric glands were either maintained in resting or stimulated states for appropriate intervals as described (6Yao X. Chaponnier C. Gabbiani G. Forte J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 541-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). At the end of treatment, the glands were pelleted and solubilized with lysis buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 2% dithiothreitol, 2% IPG buffer (pH 4–7) (Amersham Biosciences), 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 μm microcystin-LR, 1.5 mm EDTA, and 1.5 mm EGTA). Glandular cell proteins were extracted for 1 h at room temperature followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min. ReadyStrips (pH 3–10) were loaded with 200 μg of whole-cell extract for analytical two-dimensional gels and allowed to rehydrate for 18 h at room temperature. A gradient of 300–3500 V was applied to the strips followed by constant 3500 V, with focusing complete after 80,000 V-h. Prior to the second dimension, strips were incubated (15 min) in equilibration buffer (6 m urea, 2% SDS, 0.375 m Tris (pH 8.8), 30% glycerol), first with 65 mm dithiothreitol (reductive) and second with 243 mm iodoacetamide (alkylating). Equilibrated strips were inserted onto gradient SDS-PAGE gels (8 × 10 cm; 6–16%) followed by electrophoresis. Coomassie Blue-stained gels were preserved by air drying between sheets of moistened cellophane. To probe for the nature of ezrin phosphorylation, aliquots of gastric glands were treated with cimetidine and histamine plus IBMX for different time intervals and harvested for two-dimensional SDS-PAGE. The proteins separated by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE gel were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane probed with an anti-phosphoserine antibody (Sigma). Blots were developed using ECL, and the spot intensities were quantified using a Typhoon PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Preparation of Samples for Mass Spectrometry—Excised two-dimensional protein spots were destained, chopped into small fragments with a razor blade, and subjected to digestion by modified porcine trypsin (50–100 ng/digestion; Promega, Madison, WI) according to Zhou et al. (31Zhou R. Guo Z. Watson C. Chen E. Kong R. Wang W. Yao X. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Peptides were recovered by three extractions of the digestion mixture with 50% acetonitrile plus 5% trifluoroacetic acid and desalted and concentrated using C18 ZipTips (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), eluting peptides in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile/water. All supernatants were pooled and concentrated to 5 μl in a Speedvac and brought back up to 25 μl in 50% acetonitrile, 5% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptide mix was stored at 20 °C until analysis. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometric Identification of Phosphopeptides of Ezrin—Aliquots of unseparated tryptic digests were co-crystallized with cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and analyzed using a MALDI delayed extraction reflectron TOF instrument (Bi-flex; Bruker-Daltons, Framingham, MA) equipped with a nitrogen laser. Measurements were performed in a positive ionization mode. All MALDI spectra were externally calibrated using a standard peptide mixture (Sigma). Data base interrogations based on experimentally determined peptide masses were carried out using mass spectrometry (MS)-Fit, and PSD data interrogation was performed using MS-Tag; both software programs were developed in the University of California San Francisco MS Facility and are available on the World Wide Web at prospector.ucsf.edu. Both the National Center for Biotechnology Information protein data base and Swiss-Prot data base were searched. Search parameters included the putative protein molecular weight and a peptide mass tolerance of 100–200 parts/million. In Vitro Phosphorylation of Ezrin by PKA—Both the GST-wild type ezrin and GST-S66A ezrin proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (pLys), and the purification of the GST fusion proteins was carried out using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Sigma) as described (32Ammar D.A. Zhou R. Forte J.G. Yao X. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: G23-G33Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were suspended in phosphorylation buffer prior to use. To verify whether Ser66 is a substrate for PKA, 5 μg of purified GST-ezrin fusion protein, both wild type and S66A mutant, were incubated with 10 units of the catalytic subunit of PKA (New England Biolabs) in phosphorylation buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 nm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a total volume of 30 μl. Kinase reaction was carried out at room temperature for 15 min and terminated by the addition of 10 μlof4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated by 6∼16% gradient SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, dried, and quantified by a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Culture and Transfection—Primary cultures of gastric parietal cells from rabbit stomach were produced and maintained as described (31Zhou R. Guo Z. Watson C. Chen E. Kong R. Wang W. Yao X. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Separate cultures of parietal cells were transfected with plasmids encoding GFP-tagged wild type ezrin and two mutant forms of ezrin (S66A and S66D) using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 μg of DNA was incubated in 600 μl of Opti-MEM (antibiotics-free) while 6 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 was added and left at room temperature for 25 min. The cultured parietal cells (∼3% cytocrit; 6-well plates) were washed once with Opti-MEM. The DNA-lipid mix was added to the plates and incubated for 4 h, followed by replacement of 1.5 ml of medium B. The transfected cells were then maintained in culture at 37 °C until use for protein expression, partition, immunoprecipitation, or immunofluorescence. For analyzing the exogenous protein expression, transfected parietal cells were harvested 30–36 h after transfection and lysed in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. To analyze the relative level of ezrin associated with cytoskeleton, transfected cells were raised with PHEM buffer (100 mm Pipes, 20 mm Hepes, pH 6.9, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 4 m glycerol) twice followed by incubation of PHEM buffer containing a proteinase inhibitor mixture (pepstatin-A, leupeptin, aprotinin, and chymostatin; final concentration 5 μg/ml for each inhibitor) plus 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 min at room temperature to allow cytosolic proteins to be released into extracellular medium (33Yao X. Anderson K.L. Cleveland D.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The extracted cells were then harvested from a Petri dish and centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 5 min. The resulting pellets, designated as insoluble materials, were solubilized in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, whereas the supernatants, called the soluble fraction, were concentrated with 5% trichloroacetic acid followed by reconstitution in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer as described (30Yao X Thibodeau A. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C36-C46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation of GFP-ezrin proteins, GFP-ezrin-transfected parietal cells were stimulated with histamine plus IBMX for 20 min as described (31Zhou R. Guo Z. Watson C. Chen E. Kong R. Wang W. Yao X. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cells were then harvested and lysed in 1.5 ml of Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100) containing a proteinase inhibitor mixture (pepstatin A, leupeptin, aprotinin, and chymostatin; final concentration 5 μg/ml for each inhibitors) and phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (10 nm). The cell lysates were clarified by using an Eppendorf centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The resulting supernatants were then incubated with 15 μg of GFP monoclonal antibody (JL-18) at room temperature for 2 h followed by the addition of 10 μl of protein A/G beads for an additional 1 h (Pierce). The beads were collected and washed with Tris-buffered saline before boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Immunoprecipitates were then fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting analyses. The blot was first labeled with ezrin antibody 4A5 to verify the efficiency of GFP immunoprecipitation. The blot was then stripped with SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 55 °C for 20 min followed by validation of serine phosphorylation on GFP-ezrin using a phosphoserine antibody. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For cytolocalization of exogenously expressed ezrin, cultured parietal cells were transfected with GFP, wild type GFP-ezrin, and GFP-ezrin mutants (S66A and S66D) and maintained in MEM for 30–36 h. Some cultures were treated with 100 μm cimetidine to maintain a resting state; others were treated with the secretory stimulants 100 μm histamine plus 50 μm IBMX in the presence of SCH28080, a proton pump inhibitor (34Agnew B.J. Duman J.G. Watson C.J. Coling D.J. Forte J.G. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2639-4266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treated cells were then fixed with 2% formaldehyde for 10 min and washed three times with PBS followed by permeabilization in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Prior to application of primary antibody, the fixed and permeabilized cells were blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline followed by incubation of primary antibodies against ezrin (4A5) or GFP. The endogenous and exogenous ezrin proteins were labeled by a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody and counterstained with rhodamine-coupled phalloidin to visualize filamentous actin. Coverslips were supported on slides by grease pencil markings and mounted in Vectorshield (Vector). Images were taken on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescence microscope using a 63 × 1.3 numerical aperture PlanApo objective. Figures were constructed using Adobe Photoshop. Confocal Microscopy—Immunostained parietal cells were examined under a laser-scanning confocal microscope LSM510 NLO (Carl Zeiss) scan head mounted transversely to an inverted microscope (Axiovert 200; Carl Zeiss) with a 40 × 1.0 numerical aperture PlanApo objective. Single images were collected by an average of 10 scans at a scan rate of 1 s/scan. Optical section series were collected with a spacing of 0.4 μm in the z axis through the ∼12-μm thickness of the cultured parietal cells. The images from double labeling were simultaneously collected using a dichroic filter set with Zeiss image processing software (LSM 5; Carl Zeiss). Digital data were exported into Adobe Photoshop for presentation. Measurement of the Diameter of the Apical Vacuoles—The diameter of phalloidin-stained apical vacuoles was measured using LSM 5 software (Carl Zeiss) and a Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescent microscope calibrated with a stage micrometer. When suitable vacuoles were identified, the image was enlarged 3-fold to facilitate accurate placement of a computer-generated cursor over the vacuoles outlined by phalloidin staining. Vacuole diameter was calculated as the mean of the major and minor axis of the F-actin-outlined vacuolar staining. Western Blot—Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 6–16% gradient gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. In some cases, samples were first separated by isoelectric focusing followed by SDS-PAGE on 6–16% gradient gel and subsequently transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Proteins were probed by appropriate primary antibodies and detected using ECL (Pierce). The band intensity was then quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Identification of Phosphoezrin Associated with Parietal Cell Secretion—Separation of ezrin by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis is shown in Fig. 1A for resting and stimulated gastric glands. The Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gel shows that stimulation with histamine plus IBMX resulted in a shift of ezrin spots to more acidic pH, consistent with the stimulation-dependent phosphorylation of ezrin reported previously (e.g. Ref. 10Urushidani T. Hanzel D.K. Forte J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 930: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Stimulation through the histamine/cAMP pathway induced a reduction in the relative intensity of the major alkaline spot (0; estimated pI of 6.7) and a shift toward a series of more acidic isoforms 1, 2, and 3, an estimated pI varying from 6.6 to 6.4, respectively. Treatment with H89, a relatively selective inhibitor of PKA, prevented such shifts in ezrin isotypes on two-dimensional SDS-PAGE (not shown), verifying that the phosphorylation of ezrin is downstream from the activation of protein kinase A. Histamine stimulation induced three acidic ezrin spots separating with a"
https://openalex.org/W1964961766,"Obesity is associated with a number of pathological disorders such as non-insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular diseases. α-Lipoic acid (LA) has been demonstrated to activate the insulin signaling pathway and to exert insulin-like actions in adipose and muscle cells. Based on this similarity LA is expected to promote adipogenesis in pre-adipocytes. Here, however, we report that LA inhibited differentiation of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes induced by a hormonal mixture or troglitazone. Northern blot analysis of cells demonstrated that this inhibition was accompanied with attenuated expression of adipocyte-specific fatty acid-binding protein and lipoprotein lipase. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and Western blot analysis of cells demonstrated that LA modulates transcriptional activity and/or expression of a set of anti- or pro-adipogenic transcription factors. LA treatment of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes also resulted in prolonged activation of major mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways but showed little or no effect on the activity of the insulin receptor/Akt signaling pathway. These findings suggest that LA inhibits insulin or the hormonal mixture-induced differentiation of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes by modulating activity and/or expression of pro- or anti-adipogenic transcription factors mainly through activating the MAPK pathways.

Obesity is closely correlated with the prevalence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Plasma levels of leptin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 1The abbreviation used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; aP2, adipocyte-specific fatty acid-binding protein; AP-1, activator protein-1; C/EBP, CCAAT element-binding protein; CREB, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; IR, insulin receptor; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; LA, α-lipoic acid; LPL, lipoprotein lipase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; p38K, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; PPRE, PPAR-responsive element; TZ, troglitazone; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. α and non-esterified fatty acid are elevated in obesity and substantially contribute to the development of insulin resistance (1Leong K.S. Wilding J.P. Baillieres Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 13: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Obesity is caused not only by hypertrophy of adipose tissue but also by adipose tissue hyperplasia, which triggers the transformation of pre-adipocytes into adipocytes (2Caro J.F. Dohm L.G. Pories W.J. Sinha M.K. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 665-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The program of adipocyte differentiation is a complex process that involves coordinated expression of specific genes and proteins associated with each stage of differentiation. This process is regulated by several signaling pathways (3Torti F.M. Torti S.V. Larrick J.W. Ringold G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Insulin, the major anabolic hormone, promotes in vivo accumulation of adipose tissue (4Zhang B. Berger J. Zhou G. Elbrecht A. Biswas S. White-Carrington S. Szalkowski D. Moller D.E. Zhang B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31771-31774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Structurally unrelated inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), LY294002 and Wortmannin, were shown to block adipocyte differentiation in a time- and dose-dependent fashion (5Xia X. Serrero G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 178: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting that the insulin receptor (IR)/Akt signaling pathway is important in transducing the pro-adipogenic effects of insulin. In contrast, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) suppress the process of adipocyte differentiation (6Font de Mora J. Porras A. Ahn N. Santos E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6068-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 7Camp H.S. Tafuri S.R. Leff T. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 392-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). TNFα is known to exert its anti-adipogenic effects, at least in part, through activation of the ERK pathway (6Font de Mora J. Porras A. Ahn N. Santos E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6068-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38K) is shown to promote adipocyte differentiation (8Engelman J.A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32111-32120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The signals that regulate adipogenesis either promote or block the cascade of transcription factors that coordinate the differentiation process. CCAAT element-binding proteins (C/EBP) β and δ and sterol response element-binding protein 1 (ADD1/SREBP1) are active during the early stages of the differentiation process and induce the expression and/or activity of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a pivotal coordinator of adipocyte differentiation. Activated PPARγ induces exit from the cell cycle, and in cooperation with C/EBPα, stimulates the expression of many metabolic genes such as glucose transporter-4, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) (9Schoonjans K. Peinado-Onsurbe J. Lefebvre A.M. Heyman R.A. Briggs M. Deeb S. Staels B. Auwerx J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5336-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar), and adipocyte-specific fatty acid-binding protein (aP2) (10Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (2000) Google Scholar), thus constituting a functional lipogenic adipocyte. JNK and ERK suppress this process by phosphorylating and thereby attenuating the transcriptional activity of PPARγ (6Font de Mora J. Porras A. Ahn N. Santos E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6068-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 7Camp H.S. Tafuri S.R. Leff T. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 392-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Besides these integral members of the adipogenesis program, other transcription factors such as AP-1 (11Yang V.W. Christy R.J. Cook J.S. Kelly T.J. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3629-3633Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and CREB (12Reusch J.E. Colton L.A. Klemm D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1008-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) are known to promote adipogenesis, whereas nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) suppresses adipocyte differentiation (13Ruan H. Hacohen N. Golub T.R. Van Parijs L. Lodish H.F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1319-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Therefore, the activity and/or the expression of these transcription factors are attractive pharmacological targets for modulating adipocyte tissue formation and deposition. Recent studies have demonstrated that LA facilitates glucose transport and utilization in fully differentiated adipocytes, as well as in animal models of diabetes (14Estrada D.E. Ewart H.S. Tsakiridis T. Volchuk A. Ramlal T. Tritschler H. Klip A. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1798-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 15Eason R.C. Archer H.E. Akhtar S. Bailey C.J. Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2002; 4: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Moini H. Tirosh O. Park Y.C. Cho K.J. Packer L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These insulin-like actions of LA were mainly mediated by activation of IR/Akt signaling pathway. Considering that insulin stimulates adipogenesis, this study was undertaken to investigate whether LA promotes differentiation of pre-adipocytes to mature adipocytes. Reagents—Cell culture reagents including Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Invitrogen. [α-32P]dCTP and [γ-32P]dATP were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and [methyl-3H]thymidine was from Amersham Biosciences. 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Protein A/G-agarose, polyclonal anti-IRβ subunit (C-19), and other antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). R form of α-lipoic acid (LA) was kindly provided by BASF AG (Ludwigshafen, Germany). If not specifically indicated, all other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Cell Culture—3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes (American Type Culture Collection) were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin as described previously (16Moini H. Tirosh O. Park Y.C. Cho K.J. Packer L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Two days after confluence (at a post-confluent stage), adipogenesis was induced by treating cells with a solution containing 5 μg/ml insulin, 0.25 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, which is referred to as a “hormonal mixture.” 20 mm stock solution of LA was freshly prepared in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Oil Red O Staining—After the induction of differentiation, cells were stained with Oil Red O according to Ref. 17Moreno-Aliaga M.J. Matsumura F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar. Briefly, cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 10% formalin in PBS for 1 h; they were then washed three times with water. Cells were stained with Oil Red O (six parts of 0.6% Oil Red O dye in isopropanol and four parts of water) for 1 h. Excess of stain was removed by washing with water, and the stained cells were dried. The stained oil droplets was dissolved in isopropanol containing 4% Nonidet P-40 and were quantified by measuring the absorbance at 520 nm. Northern Blotting—Total cellular RNA was purified from cultured cells using Trizol reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). RNA (10–30 μg) was electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel containing 37% formaldehyde and transferred to Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by capillary transfer. The membrane was fixed using an optimal UV cross-linking procedure and pre-hybridized at 68 °C in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (Clontech). cDNA probes for PPARγ, LPL, and aP2 were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) using a random primer kit (TaKaRa). The blot was then washed twice with 2× SSC (300 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0) containing 0.05% SDS at 25 °C, 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 55 °C and autoradiographed at –70 °C. Immunoblotting—Cells in 100-mm dishes were washed with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and lysed with a lysis buffer, pH 7.2, consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.25% protease inhibitor mixture solution (Sigma). Cytosolic proteins were separated by 8–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunoblotted. The immunoreactive bands were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences). [3H]Thymidine Uptake—Proliferation of the cells was evaluated by a [methyl-3H]thymidine uptake. Post-confluent cells in 12-well culture plates were incubated with LA, insulin, and/or the hormonal mixture for 24 h. Eight h before harvest, 1 μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine was added to each well, and the incubation was stopped by washing the cells with ice-cold PBS containing 5% trichloroacetic acid. The [methyl-3H]thymidine was quantitated using a liquid scintillation counter. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (18Cho K.J. Yun C.H. Yoon D.Y. Cho Y.S. Rimbach G. Packer L. Chung A.S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2000; 168: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with LA, insulin, or the mixture for the indicated time period and lysed with a hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, 1.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5). The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min and lysed in a hypertonic buffer (30 mm Hepes, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 450 mm KCl, 0.3 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Following the lysis, the samples were centrifuged at 14,500 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was retained for use in the DNA binding assay. Two double-stranded deoxyoligonucleotides corresponding to NF-κB, AP-1, CREB, Sp-1 (Promega), PPARγ, and C/EBPα (Santa Cruz) were end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP using T4 kinase (TaKaRa). The nuclear extracts were then incubated with 1 μg/μl poly(dI-dC) and 32P-labeled DNA probe in a binding buffer (100 mm KCl, 30 mm Hepes, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) for 10 min. Thereafter, the reaction mixture was separated in 5% polyacrylamide gel. Following the electrophoresis, the gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. The specificity of each probe was examined by the addition of 100-fold excess of each unlabeled probe. An electrophoretic mobility gel supershift assay was performed to discriminate PPARγ or C/EBPα from other isoforms by incubating the reaction mixture with 1 μg of anti-PPARγ or anti-C/EBPα antibody on ice for 30 min, respectively. Transfection and Reporter Gene Assay—NIH-3T3 fibroblasts cultured on six-well tissue culture plates were transiently transfected with an expression plasmid for mouse PPARγ (1 μg/well) and a reporter plasmid with PPAR-responsive element (PPRE) (1 μg/well) using a LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were supplemented with troglitazone, LA, or insulin, cultured for another 24–48 h, and then lysed in the recommended lysis buffer for luciferase assay. The luciferase activity was determined using the luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. (PPRE×3)-tk-luciferase and mouse PPARγ expression vectors were kindly provided by Dr. Young Yang (Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology). Data Presentation—Data are presented as mean ± S.D. (or S.E.) of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Differences between means were assessed by one-way analysis of variance. The minimum level of significance was set at p < 0.05. α-Lipoic Acid Suppresses the Hormonal Mixture- or Troglitazone-induced Differentiation of 3T3-L1 Pre-adipocytes— 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes initiated their conversion to mature adipocytes 3 days after addition of either the hormonal mixture or insulin alone. Culturing these cells for another 6 days in the normal medium increased the number of fully differentiated adipocytes by 6.9 ± 0.1- or 2.3 ± 0.2-fold in cultures treated previously with the hormonal mixture or insulin alone, respectively (Fig. 1A). Treatment of cells with 5 ng/ml TNFα decreased differentiation by 13.2 ± 6.0%. However, co-treatment of the pre-adipocytes with LA inhibited the hormonal mixture- or insulin-induced differentiation and potentiated the anti-adipogenic effect of TNFα (Fig. 1A). Concordantly, mRNA levels of pro-adipogenic proteins such as aP2 and LPL were decreased by co-treatment with 250 or 500 μm LA and slightly increased by 100 μm LA (Fig. 1B). Troglitazone increases pre-adipocyte differentiation through up-regulation of PPARγ (19Spiegelman B.M. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). In this study, 10 μm troglitazone increased adipocyte differentiation by 5.9 ± 0.1-fold. Co-treatment with 500 μm LA inhibited troglitazone-induced differentiation, which was accompanied with lower expression levels of aP2 and LPL genes (Fig. 2, A and B). These findings suggest that LA acts as a PPARγ antagonist.Fig. 2α-Lipoic acid suppresses troglitazone-induced pre-adipocyte differentiation. Post-confluent 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were treated with 10 μm TZ for 6 days in the absence or presence of indicated concentrations of LA. The cells were then incubated in the normal medium for an additional 3 days. A, morphological changes associated with adipogenesis were photographed (left panel) based on staining cellular triglyceride deposition by Oil Red O, which was expressed as -fold increase compared with untreated cells (right panel). * or ***, significant at p < 0.05 or p < 0.001 compared with untreated cells. #, significant at p < 0.05 compared with TZ-treated cells.

Brasier A.R. McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Consistently, long-term (9 days) treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with 5 ng/ml TNFα significantly de-differentiated the adipocytes by 17.7 ± 3.9%, whereas the presence of insulin maintained cells in the differentiated state. Post-treatment with 500 μm LA for 6 days subsequent to the induction of differentiation by the hormonal mixture promoted de-differentiation by 19.1 ± 8.3 or 23.2 ± 2.3% in the absence or presence of insulin, respectively. LA post-treatment also increased TNFα-induced de-differentiation by 19.6 ± 11.4% (Fig. 3A). Consistently, 6-day treatment with 500 μm LA after treatment with the hormonal mixture decreased mRNA levels of PPARγ, aP2, and LPL (Fig. 3B), indicating that the de-differentiating effect of LA was mediated by down-regulation of expression of these adipogenic factors. However, lower concentrations of LA (100 μm) did not de-differentiate adipocytes but slightly increased mRNA levels of the adipogenic factors, indicating a biphasic mode of LA action. α-Lipoic Acid Regulates Insulin and Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Signaling Pathways—LA is known to increase glucose uptake into fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes by activating the IR/Akt signaling pathway (16Moini H. Tirosh O. Park Y.C. Cho K.J. Packer L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 21Yaworsky K. Somwar R. Ramlal T. Tritschler H.J. Klip A. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In pre-adipocytes, however, LA did not phosphorylate IR and IRS-1 within 30 min, whereas insulin strongly increased phosphorylation of both IR and IRS-1 from 5 min (Fig. 4, A and B) and lasted up to 4 h (data not shown). Moreover, LA transiently activated Akt whereas the insulin-induced Akt activation lasted up to several hours (Fig. 4C). Treatment of pre-adipocytes with 10 nm insulin or 500 μm LA also activated ERK, JNK, and p38K (Fig. 5, A–C). Although LA activated major MAPKs for longer than 30 min, insulin transiently activated them (∼5 min). PD98059, an MAPK/ERK kinase kinase inhibitor, or Wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, abolished the phosphorylation of ERK or Akt, respectively, demonstrating that ERK or Akt activation was dependent on the activity of their upstream kinase, MAPK/ERK kinase kinase, or PI3K, respectively.Fig. 5Effect of α-lipoic acid on mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. Post-confluent pre-adipocytes were serum-deprived for 4 h, when indicated, pretreated with 50 μm PD98059 for 30 min, and were then treated with 10 nm insulin or 500 μm LA for the indicated times. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, and phosphorylation states of ERK (A), JNK (B), and p38K (C) were determined by Western blot analysis of the cell lysates. Each bar indicates mean ± S.E. of the -fold increase compared with the untreated group.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In adipocytes at the early stage of differentiation, LA could not induce a detectable level of IR, IRS-1, and Akt phosphorylation within 60 min (Fig. 6, A and B), whereas LA strongly activated ERK and JNK (Fig. 6C) but not p38K (data not shown). Insulin, on the other hand, strongly activated IR, IRS, and Akt phosphorylation from 5 to 60 min, as well as ERK and JNK at the early stage of differentiation (Fig. 6). α-Lipoic Acid Inhibits Insulin- or Hormonal Mixture-induced Mitotic Clonal Expansion—After growth arrest at confluence, pre-adipocytes re-enter the cell cycle and undergo several rounds of mitosis, referred to as mitotic clonal expansion (22Bernlohr D.A. Bolanowski M.A. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5563-5567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initiation of the clonal expansion involves expression of immediate early genes, fos, jun, myc, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ, to drive confluent 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes from G0 into G1 (23Smas C.M. Chen L. Zhao L. Latasa M.J. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12632-12641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 24MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Insulin or the hormonal mixture promoted the clonal expansion 1 day after initiation of the induction as was evident by an increase in the rate of thymidine uptake (Fig. 7A). When cells were serum-deprived for 4 h, the protein expression of immediate early genes such as c-Fos and c-Jun was not detectable, whereas insulin or the hormonal mixture strongly induced expression of these proteins within several hours (Fig. 7B). LA co-treatment, however, significantly inhibited insulin- or the hormonal mixture-induced clonal expansion and decreased the expression of c-Fos and c-Jun (Fig. 7). Moreover, basal expression of c-Fos, c-Jun, and c-Myc in the presence of 10% FBS was diminished after treatment of cells with LA for 24 h in the absence or presence of insulin or the hormonal mixture (Fig. 7C). Two members of the retinoblastoma family of tumor suppressor proteins p107 and p130 are also known to regulate adipocyte differentiation by regulating its mitotic clonal expansion phase. On a quiescent day 0 preadipocytes, high levels of p130 appear whereas p107 levels are barely detectable. After 24 h of the hormonal mixture stimulation, a significant increase appears in p107 levels with a concomitant decrease in the levels of p130 (25Richon V.M. Lyle R.E. McGehee R.E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10117-10124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In our study, p107, but not p130, is highly inducible by treatment with the hormonal mixture for 24 h, and LA co-treatment decreased the expression of p107 but not p130 (Fig. 7C). These findings suggest that LA inhibits the process of clonal expansion by suppressing the expression of several immediate early genes and some retinoblastoma family members. Regulation of Pro- or Anti-adipogenic Transcription Factor Activities by α-Lipoic Acid—Pre-adipocytes displayed strong NF-κB activity, whereas fully differentiated adipocytes exhibited strong PPARγ and C/EBPα activities, regardless of the presence of FBS in their culture media (Fig. 8A). Fully differentiated adipocytes also displayed higher AP-1 and CREB activities compared with pre-adipocytes, which was further increased in the presence of 10% FBS in the culture media. Sp-1 activity, however, was the same in all groups. Two-h treatment of pre-adipocytes with LA strongly inhibited AP-1, C/EBP, and CREB activities, while increasing NF-κB activity; however, the hormonal mixture induced an opposite response (Fig. 8B). Interestingly, insulin alone also increased NF-κB activity, along with AP-1, C/EBP, and CREB activities. Co-treatment of pre-adipocytes with LA and insulin or the hormonal mixture resulted in increased NF-κB activity and decreased activities of AP-1, C/EBP, and CREB in the nuclear fractions of pre-adipocytes. These findings strongly suggest that LA inhibits insulin- or the hormonal mixture-induced adipocyte differentiation by oppositely regulating nuclear translocation of pro- and anti-adipogenic transcription factors. In adipocytes at the early stage of differentiation, 3 h of treatment with LA strongly inhibited transcriptional activity of PPARγ, C/EBPα, and AP-1, but not Sp-1, in the absence or presence of insulin (Fig. 9A). Pretreatment of cells with PD98059, an ERK inhibitor, or SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, partially reversed inhibition of C/EBPα or PPARγ, C/EBPα, and AP-1, respectively (Fig. 9B). Specific DNA binding activity of PPARγ and C/EBPα was also demonstrated by the super-shift assay using anti-PPARγ and anti-C/EBPα antibodies, respectively (Fig. 9C). Regulation of PPARγ Transactivation by α-Lipoic Acid in NIH-3T3 Fibroblasts—To confirm that the inhibitory effect of LA on PPARγ DNA binding activity affects its transactivation capacity, NIH-3T3 cells were transiently transfected with mouse PPARγ gene and PPRE vector. 20 μm troglitazone, a well known PPARγ agonist, strongly stimulated PPARγ-mediated luciferase activity after 24 or 48 h by 3.5 ± 0.1- or 3.1 ± 0.2-fold, respectively (Fig. 10). Insulin also acted as a weak PPARγ agonist and increased the luciferase activity by 1.5 ± 0.1- or 1.3-fold after 24 or 48 h, respectively. LA alone, however, weakly increased luciferase activity when used at 500 μm for 24 h. On the contrary, co-treatment of cells with LA significantly inhibited troglitazone-induced PPARγ transactivation by 43.9 ± 0.9 or 19.5 ± 4.7% after 24 or 48 h, respectively. These findings demonstrate that LA alone acts as a weak PPARγ agonist, but it is a strong antagonist of PPARγ in the presence of other PPARγ agonists. In this study, we demonstrated that LA inhibits differentiation of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes and that major MAPK signaling pathways mediate collateral actions of LA on clonal expansion and adipocyte maturation by attenuating the expression and activation of the immediate early genes such as c-Fos and c-Jun and by negatively regulating integral members of the differentiation program, PPARγ and C/EBPα. MAPK Signaling Pathways Mediate Actions of α-Lipoic Acid on Adipogenesis—Several lines of evidence indicate that pro-adipogenic transcription factors such as PPARγ and members of the C/EBP family can be negatively regulated by MAPKs. Epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, lipoxygenase-1 metabolites, and prostaglandin F2α were shown to phosphorylate and attenuate transcriptional activity of PPARγ by activating MAPK signaling pathways (26Camp H.S. Tafuri S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10811-10816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 27Hsi L.C. Wilson L. Nixon J. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34545-34552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 28Reginato M.J. Krakow S.L. Bailey S.T. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1855-1858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Similarly, LA treatment of pre-adipocytes inhibited insulin- or the hormonal mixture-induced transcriptional activity of PPARγ and C/EBPα, which was accompanied with strong activation of ERK and JNK. Furthermore, inhibitors of ERK or JNK activity abolished the inhibitory effect of LA on insulin- or the hormonal mixture-induced adipogenesis. On the other hand, LA hardly stimulated phosphorylation of IR or IRS-1 both in pre-adipocytes and in adipocytes at the early stage of differentiation. In particular, upon LA treatment, a transient Akt phosphorylation was detected in pre-adipocytes though it was not detectable in adipocytes at the early stage of differentiation. In contrast, insulin strongly activated IR and IRS-1 and induced long lasting Akt activation in pre-adipocytes and in adipocytes at the early stage of differentiation. Taken together, these findings exclude possible involvement of Akt activation in LA-induced inhibition of adipogenesis and demonstrate that LA down-regulates PPARγ and C/EBPα through activation of MAPK signaling pathways. It should be emphasized that the underlying reason for the observation that LA activates the IR/Akt signaling pathway in fully differentiated adipocytes, but not in pre-adipocytes, might be the number of IRs and the potency of post-receptor signaling events that is known to be dramatically lower in pre-adipocytes. Modulation of Auxiliary Transcription Factors in Adipogenesis by α-Lipoic Acid—Transcriptional activities of AP-1 and CREB were increased in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, as well as after 2 h of treatment with the hormonal mixture in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. AP-1 is involved in transcriptional regulation of aP2 and LPL genes (29Distel R.J. Ro H.S. Rosen B.S. Groves D.L. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1987; 49: 835-844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 30Homma H. Kurachi H. Nishio Y. Takeda T. Yamamoto T. Adachi K. Morishige K. Ohmichi M. Matsuzawa Y. Murata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11404-11411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). CREB appears to stimulate transcription of several adipocyte-specific genes such as aP2, fatty acid synthetase, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (12Reusch J.E. Colton L.A. Klemm D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1008-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). LA, however, strongly down-regulated AP-1 and CREB activities whereas it up-regulated NF-κB activity in pre-adipocytes. Many anti-adipogenic factors such as proinflammatory cytokines (31Renard P. Raes M. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1999; 15: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), TNFα (13Ruan H. Hacohen N. Golub T.R. Van Parijs L. Lodish H.F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1319-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), and endrin (17Moreno-Aliaga M.J. Matsumura F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) are also known to up-regulate NF-κB activity, whereas pro-adipogenic factors such as troglitazone display an opposite effect in 3T3-L1 cells (32Yamasaki S. Nakashima T. Kawakami A. Miyashita T. Ida H. Migita K. Nakata K. Eguchi K. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2002; 129: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Considering that AP-1 (33Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar), CREB (34Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), and NF-κB (35Chakraborti S. Chakraborti T. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) mediate major downstream effects of MAPK signaling pathways, our findings suggest that LA activation of the MAPK signaling pathways leads to the differential regulation of these transcription factors, which eventually results in decreased expression of the adipocyte-specific genes, consequently contributing to the suppression of adipogenesis. MAPK Signaling Pathways Mediate Actions of α-Lipoic Acid on Cell Cycle and Clonal Expansion—In the course of adipogenesis, one of the first events that occur following hormonal induction is re-entry of growth-arrested pre-adipocytes into the cell cycle. In this study, LA was demonstrated to inhibit the process of clonal expansion when induced by insulin or the hormonal mixture, indicating that insulin and LA oppositely regulate cell cycle progression. This differential effect seems to be because of the potency and/or the kinetics of activating of MAPK and IR/Akt signaling pathways. Both insulin and LA activated MAPK signaling pathways in pre-adipocytes. However, insulin, but not LA, also strongly activated the IR/Akt signaling pathway. This observation indicates that progression in the cell cycle and clonal expansion may require activation of both MAPK and IR/Akt signaling pathways. On the other hand, insulin-induced MAPK activation was transient whereas that of LA lasted longer, indicating that duration of MAPK activation might be another important factor in determining the fate of a cell in the cell cycle. Indeed, transient activation of MAPK has been considered as a contributor to cell cycle progression whereas its prolonged activation can result in cell cycle arrest via induction of p21Cip1/Waf1 expression and inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase activity (36Steinman R.A. Hoffman B. Iro A. Guillouf C. Liebermann D.A. el-Houseini M.E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3389-3396PubMed Google Scholar, 37Kim K.Y. Rhim T. Choi I. Kim S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40591-40598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It should be emphasized that JNK is known to activate p53, which triggers activation of several proteins involved in cell cycle arrest such as p21Cip1/Waf1 (38Buschmann T. Potapova O. Bar-Shira A. Ivanov V.N. Fuchs S.Y. Henderson S. Fried V.A. Minamoto T. Alarcon-Vargas D. Pincus M.R. Gaarde W.A. Holbrook N.J. Shiloh Y. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2743-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). This evidence supports the notion that activation of MAPKs mediates the inhibitory effect of LA on the clonal expansion process by suppressing the expression of the immediate early genes. Conclusions—Several PPARγ agonists such as thiazolidinediones have been recommended for the treatment of diabetes by improving insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake (19Spiegelman B.M. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). Treatment with current PPARγ agonists, however, leads to increased adiposity and body weight gain in rodents (39Hallakou S. Doare L. Foufelle F. Kergoat M. Guerre-Millo M. Berthault M.F. Dugail I. Morin J. Auwerx J. Ferre P. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1393-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), which subsequently contribute to the enhanced insulin resistance. In our study, LA at lower concentrations (100 μm) promoted adipogenesis whereas at higher concentrations (250 and 500 μm)it was inhibitory. Importantly, LA inhibited adipogenesis induced by insulin or troglitazone indicating that co-treatment with LA may be beneficial in preventing obesity induced by PPARγ agonists by maintaining optimal adipogenesis. Although LA increases glucose uptake into muscle or adipose tissue by activating the IR/Akt signaling pathway, the underlying mechanism for regulation of adipogenesis by LA appears to be different. Our findings strongly suggest that LA regulates adipogenesis mainly through activation of MAPKs such as ERK and JNK independent of activation of IR/Akt signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1991947898,"Mutations in PKD1 and PKD2, the genes that encode polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 respectively, account for almost all cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Although the polycystins are believed to interact in vivo, the two proteins often display dissimilar patterns and gradients of expression during development. In an effort to understand this apparent discrepancy, we investigated how changes in polycystin-2 expression can affect the subcellular localization of polycystin-1. We show that, when polycystin-1 is expressed alone in a PKD2 null cell line, it localizes to the cell surface, as well as to the endoplasmic reticulum. When co-expressed with polycystin-2, however, polycystin-1 is not seen at the cell surface and co-localizes completely with polycystin-2 in the endoplasmic reticulum. The localization of a polycystin-1 fusion protein was similarly affected by changes in its level of expression relative to that of polycystin-2. This phenomenon was observed in populations as well as in individual COS-7 cells. Our data suggest that the localization of polycystin-1 can be regulated via the relative expression level of polycystin-2 in mammalian cells. This mechanism may help to explain the divergent patterns and levels of expression observed for the polycystins, and may provide clues as to how the function of these two proteins are regulated during development.

A recent study in kidney epithelial cells suggests that both polycystins may also play a role in cilium mechanosensation (16Nauli S.M. Alenghat F.J. Luo Y. Williams E. Vassilev P. Li X. Elia A.E.

Several lines of evidence indicate that polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 interact within the cell. Mutations in either mammalian PKD1 or PKD2, or the Caenorhabditis elegans homologues of these genes, result in almost identical phenotypes, suggesting that the polycystins are part of the same biochemical pathway (17Hateboer N. v Dijk M.A. Bogdanova N.

Additionally, the C-terminal regions of both proteins have been shown to interact in both in vitro and in vivo assays (19Tsiokas L. Kim E. Arnould T. Sukhatme V.P. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6965-6970Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 20Qian F. Germino F.J. Cai Y. Zhang X. Somlo S. Germino G.G. Nat.

Finally, two recent reports have suggested that polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 may form a functional complex within intact cells (21Hanaoka K. Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Piontek K. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P. Guggino W.B. Germino G.G. Nature. 2000; 408: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 22Newby L.J. Streets A.J. Zhao Y. Harris P.C. Ward C.J. Ong A.C.M. J. Biol.

Despite these observations, little is still known about the precise nature of the relationship between the polycystins in the cell, especially in terms of the effect each has on the subcellular distribution of the other. Polycystin-1 is predominantly found in the plasma membranes of cells in culture and in tissues, although some groups also detect it in the cytoplasm in association with intracellular membranes. There is less consensus about the subcellular localization of polycystin-2. Several groups have localized it to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, whereas others have found it in the plasma membrane (reviewed in Refs. 23Arnaout M.A. Annu. Rev. Med. 2001; 52: 93-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar and 24Ong A.C. Exp. Nephrol. 2000; 8: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, the expression patterns of both proteins are often inversely related during development, and polycystin-1 has been shown to relocate from the plasma membrane to the cell interior as an organism matures (25Van Adelsberg J. Chamberlain S. D'Agati V. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F602-F609PubMed Google Scholar). This information is difficult to reconcile with the models favoring interaction of the polycystins, as one would expect that two interacting proteins would manifest similar patterns of expression and localization. In an effort to resolve these issues, we have chosen to focus on the localization patterns of polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 in cultured cells. We find that, when full-length polycystin-1 is expressed alone in a cell line that does not express polycystin-2, it localizes to the cell surface and ER. However, when polycystin-1 is co-expressed with polycystin-2 in the same cell line, it is not found at the cell surface. Rather, it is seen exclusively inside the cell, where it co-localizes with polycystin-2 in the ER. Further experiments, in which the C-terminal tail of polycystin-1 is expressed in COS-7 cells as part of a membrane-anchored fusion protein, confirm that the subcellular localization of polycystin-1 depends on the ratio of polycystin-2 to polycystin-1 expression. Our data are consistent with a titration effect, whereby the localization of polycystin-1 within the cell can be regulated via the relative expression level of polycystin-2. This effect may explain many of the inconsistencies that have been reported in the expression and localization patterns of the polycystins, and may suggest a mechanism whereby the functions of these proteins are regulated during development. Constructs—The PKD1-FL construct is a modification of a full-length mouse PKD1 construct (PKD1-HA) in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). PKD1 cDNA fragments were generated via reverse transcription-PCR on mouse kidney mRNA. The full-length cDNA was assembled by subcloning these fragments together, and a triple HA tag was inserted in frame directly upstream of the stop codon. The PKD1-HA construct was confirmed by direct sequencing, and expression of the construct was demonstrated via anti-HA Western blotting and immunofluorescence. This vector was cut with XbaI (New England Biolabs), and a partial digest was performed with Eco47III (Fermentas) to produce an 18.5-kb fragment. An oligonucleotide encoding the first 27 amino acids of polycystin-1 (including the initiator methionine and the predicted N-terminal signal peptide cleavage site) followed by a triple FLAG tag was then cloned into these sites. To create PKD1-W, a cDNA encoding the C-terminal 112 amino acids of polycystin-1 was subcloned into the HindIII and NotI sites of Bluescript (Stratagene), downstream of the extracellular domain of placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) (gift of S. Uden-friend, Roche Institute of Molecular Biology, Nutley, NJ) and the transmembrane region of the vesicular stomatitis virus major coat glycoprotein (VSV-G). PKD1-W was then subcloned into the KpnI and NotI sites of either pcDNA3.1 or KRSPA (gift of R. Marienfeld, Yale University, New Haven, CT) vector to create the PKD1-W(3) and PKD1-W(K) constructs, respectively. A cDNA encoding the final 49 amino acids of the GABA transporter, GAT2, was similarly subcloned with PLAP and VSV-G into pCB6 (gift of M. Roth, University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX) to create the PLAP-GAT2 construct. All constructs were confirmed by direct sequencing. Creation of PKD2-FL construct has been described previously (26Cai Y. Maeda Y. Cedzich A. Torres V.E. Wu G. Hayashi T. Mochizuki T. Park J.H. Witzgall R. Somlo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28557-28565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Isolation of PKD2 -/- Cells—The cell isolation procedure utilized is a modification of that devised by Van Adelsberg et al. (27Van Adelsberg J. Edwards J.C. Herzlinger D. Cannon C. Rater M. al-Awqati Q. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C1004-C1011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kidneys from a PKD2WS25/- mouse transgenic for the SV40 large T antigen were removed, sliced into 150-μm slices, and incubated for 30 min in 1.5% (w/v) collagenase type IV in Hanks' balanced salt solution at 37 °C. Small clumps were dispersed by aspiration through a 21-gauge needle, centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min, washed with ice-cold PT culture medium (see below), and re-centrifuged as above. The resultant cell pellet was washed with 5 mm glucose in PBS, centrifuged, and resuspended in 5 mm glucose-PBS. The cell suspension was dispersed onto Lotus tetragonolobus agglutinin-coated plates and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Unbound cells were removed by vigorous washing with ice-cold 5 mm glucose-PBS. Attached cells were eluted by adding 10 ml of 150 mm fructose in PBS and incubating for 5 min. The eluted cells were washed with 5 mm glucose-PBS and resuspended in culture medium. PKD2 -/- cells were genotyped for presence of the SV40 large T antigen with the following primers: 5′-AGCGCTTGTGTCGCCATTGTA-3′ and 5′-GTCACACCACAGAAGTAAGGT-3′. Genotyping for PKD2 -/- has been described previously (28Wu G. Markowitz G.S. Li L. D'Agati V.D. Factor S.M. Geng L. Tibara S. Tuchman J. Cai Y. Park J.H. van Adelsberg J. Hou Jr., H. Kucherlapati R. Edelmann W. Somlo S. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—PKD2-/- cells were grown in PT culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, insulin (8.3 × 10-7m), prostaglandin E1 (7.1 × 10-8m), selenium (6.8 × 10-9m), transferrin (6.2 × 10-8m), triiodothyronine (2 × 10-9m), dexamethasone (5.09 × 10-8m), and recombinant γ-interferon (10 units/ml, Sigma)) at 33 °C (permissive conditions). COS-7 cells were grown in α-modified minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. All cells were grown on glass coverslips, and transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were assayed 2 days after transfection. Immunofluorescence—For PKD1-FL and PKD1-FL + PKD2-FL transfections, non-permeabilized cells maintained at 4 °C were incubated for 1 h with anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:200 in surface buffer (0.1% bovine serum albumin/PBS++ (PBS supplemented with 100 μm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2)). Cells were then washed three times in surface buffer and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with anti-mouse Cy5-conjugated Fab secondary antibody at a concentration of 20 μg/ml in surface buffer. This concentration of Cy5-conjugated Fab secondary antibody effectively blocks additional labeling of the mouse primary antibody by subsequent rounds of anti-mouse secondary antibody and is referred to as the “blocking concentration.” After this step, cells were washed three times in surface buffer, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized and blocked in GSDB (16% goat serum (Invitrogen), 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 450 mm NaCl, 0.3% Triton X-100) at room temperature. Anti-HA monoclonal antibody (BabCo) and, if applicable, a mix of anti-polycystin-2 YCC2 and YCB9 polyclonal antibodies (26Cai Y. Maeda Y. Cedzich A. Torres V.E. Wu G. Hayashi T. Mochizuki T. Park J.H. Witzgall R. Somlo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28557-28565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) were then applied for 1 h at a dilution of 1:200 in GSDB. This was followed by three washes in permeabilization buffer (0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS++) and a 1-h incubation in anti-mouse FITC-conjugated Fab and, if applicable, anti-rabbit rhodamine-conjugated Fab secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories), both at a concentration of 15 μg/ml in GSDB. Immunofluorescence for PKD1-W(3/K)/PLAP-GAT2 + PKD2-FL transfections was carried out as described in Fig. 1. Nonpermeabilized cells maintained at 4 °C were incubated with anti-PLAP monoclonal antibody (Chemicon) at a dilution of 1:200 in surface buffer. This was followed by three washes in surface buffer and incubation with anti-mouse Cy5-conjugated Fab secondary antibody in surface buffer at the blocking concentration. Cells were washed three times in surface buffer, and fixed and blocked as above. Anti-PLAP monoclonal, anti-polycystin-2, anti-mouse FITC-conjugated Fab secondary, and anti-rabbit rhodamine-conjugated Fab secondary antibodies were then applied per the conditions listed above. For co-localization studies with markers of cellular compartments, cells were subjected to the same triple label protocol as above, with polycystin-2 detected via an anti-rabbit FITC-conjugated Fab secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories) instead of the anti-rabbit rhodamineconjugated Fab secondary antibody. For cells transfected with PKD1-FL or a PKD1-W construct, calnexin was detected with an anti-calnexin polyclonal antibody (Stressgen) and an anti-rabbit rhodamineconjugated Fab secondary antibody. For cells transfected with PKD2-FL, calnexin was detected with an anti-calnexin monoclonal antibody (Stressgen) and an anti-mouse rhodamine-conjugated Fab secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories). All coverslips were examined using a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope. Quantitation of Construct Expression—The construct of interest was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells grown on duplicate sets of coverslips. On one coverslip, cells were subjected to the appropriate triple label immunofluorescence protocol, described above. The average number of cells per field expressing the transfected construct was determined for 10 fields (magnification, ×63). On the other coverslip, cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, and soluble protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). This membrane was probed with the appropriate antibody (see above), and densitometry analysis was carried out on the relevant band using Labworks Image Analysis Software (UVP). Densitometry figures were then divided by the average number of cells expressing the transfected construct per field to yield a value proportional to the average expression of the construct per transfected cell. This protocol was repeated in triplicate for all constructs. Western Blotting and Co-immunoprecipitation—All samples were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose for blotting with anti-PLAP or anti-polycystin-2 polyclonal antibodies. Primary antibodies were detected with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma) in conjunction with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). For detection of polycystin-2 expression by the mouse proximal tubule cell lines, cells were first washed in PBS++ and then lysed in 1% Triton X-100. The protein concentration of each sample was determined via an albumin protein concentration assay, and equal amounts of each sample were loaded. For the co-immunoprecipitation assay, cells transiently transfected with PKD1-W(3/K) or PLAP-GAT2, and PKD2-FL were washed in PBS++ and lysed in Co-Ip buffer (19Tsiokas L. Kim E. Arnould T. Sukhatme V.P. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6965-6970Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Protein-G beads (Pierce), pre-incubated with anti-PLAP monoclonal antibody (1:100 dilution), were combined with the soluble fraction of the cell lysate and rotated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted and washed three times with Co-Ip buffer, and bound protein was eluted with Laemmli buffer. Pixel Intensity Measurements—Cos-7 cells transiently transfected with PKD1-W(3) or PLAP-GAT2, and PKD2-FL were subjected to the triple labeling immunofluorescence protocol described above. Individual cells were chosen at random, and intensity values for each fluorescence channel were obtained. Our group has shown that the average fluorescence intensity of the Jackson Laboratories anti-mouse Cy5-conjugated Fab secondary antibody is 1.4 times that of the anti-mouse FITC-conjugated Fab secondary when used to detect the same concentration of monoclonal anti-PLAP primary antibody. Thus, all Cy5 intensity values obtained in our pixel intensity study were multiplied by 0.7 so that they could be directly compared with the FITC intensity values. The corrected Cy5 pixel intensity value represents the total amount of PLAP fusion protein at the cell surface, whereas the FITC value represents the total amount of PLAP fusion protein inside the cell. The rhodamine value represents the entire cellular population of polycystin-2. The total PLAP fusion protein expression per cell was obtained by adding the corrected Cy5 value to the FITC value. Polycystin-2 expression values were divided into three categories (“low,” “medium,” and “high”), depending on whether they fell within the bottom, middle, or upper third, respectively, of the rhodamine intensity values collected for all cells. Polycystin-2 Expression Influences the Localization of Polycystin-1 in a Mouse Proximal Tubule Cell Line—To ascertain what role polycystin-2 plays in modulating the subcellular distribution of polycystin-1, a vector encoding the full-length sequence of murine polycystin-1 with an extracellular N-terminal triple FLAG tag and an intracellular C-terminal triple HA tag (PKD1-FL) was transfected into a PKD2 null cell line. This cell line was derived from the proximal tubule of a PKD2 WS25/- mouse, and has been shown to carry a genomic rearrangement on the WS25 allele that results in PKD2 -/- cells (29Wu G. D'Agati V. Cai Y. Markowitz G. Park J.H. Reynolds D.M. Maeda Y. Le T.C. Hou Jr., H. Kucherlapati R. Edelmann W. Somlo S.

Cai, V. Chauvet, V. Rajendran, R. Zeltner, L. Geng, E. D. Avner, W. Sweeney, S. Somlo, and M. J. Caplan, unpublished data. A Western blot of total PKD2 -/- cell lysate confirmed the absence of polycystin-2 expression in this cell line. In contrast, polycystin-2 expression was detected in lysates prepared from a related PKD2 WS25/- cell line that had undergone a WS25 rearrangement to the wild-type PKD2 allele (PKD2 +/-) as well as from a PKD2 -/- cell line transfected with a vector encoding the full-length sequence of polycystin-2 (PKD2-FL) (Fig. 2A). To detect polycystin-1 at the surface of the PKD2 -/- cells, live cells were incubated with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. This was followed by incubation with an anti-mouse Cy5-conjugated Fab secondary antibody at a concentration sufficient to completely saturate the bound FLAG antibody and hence prevent any further binding of anti-mouse secondary antibody (“blocking concentration”). Both steps were carried out at 4 °C to prevent antibody internalization. Cells were then fixed and permeabilized, and intracellular polycystin-1 was detected via incubation in an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and an anti-mouse FITC-conjugated Fab antibody at room temperature. Thus, fluorescent staining visualized on the Cy5 channel revealed the surface population of polycystin-1, whereas staining on the FITC channel corresponded to the entire intracellular population of the protein. In PKD2 -/- cells transfected with PKD1-FL alone, polycystin-1 localized to the plasma membrane, as well as to cytoplasmic and perinuclear structures (Fig. 2B). The intracellular pool of polycystin-1 co-localized with the ER marker calnexin (Fig. 2C). To ensure optimal detection of polycystin-2, antibodies specific for both the N and C termini of the protein (YCC2 and YCB9) (26Cai Y. Maeda Y. Cedzich A. Torres V.E. Wu G. Hayashi T. Mochizuki T. Park J.H. Witzgall R. Somlo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28557-28565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) were combined for use in immunofluorescence studies. When PKD2-FL was transfected into the PKD2 -/- cells, polycystin-2 localized to perinuclear and cytoplasmic structures, which also stained for calnexin (Fig. 2C). This expression pattern was identical to that of endogenous polycystin-2 in PKD2 +/- cells (data not shown). When PKD1-FL and PKD2-FL were co-transfected into the PKD2 -/- cells, polycystin-1 co-localized exclusively with polycystin-2 in the ER and was not detected at the cell surface (Fig. 2B). These results led us to hypothesize that polycystin-2 may play a role in determining the subcellular distribution of polycystin-1. Design of Relatively High and Low Expressing PKD1 Constructs—As most cells express at least low endogenous levels of polycystin-2, we decided to examine whether the relative level of polycystin-2 to polycystin-1 expression determines the subcellular localization of polycystin-1. For this purpose, we utilized COS-7 cells, which express endogenous polycystin-2 and can be transfected at a much higher efficiency than the PKD2 -/- cells. The large size of full-length polycystin-1 precludes it from being expressed at high levels from the PKD1-FL vector. In an effort to obtain a wider range of polycystin-1 expression, we created a fusion protein, polycystin-1w, which includes the final 112 amino acids of the C terminus of polycystin-1. This portion of polycystin-1 has been shown to participate in several of the cell signaling processes that have been attributed to the full-length protein, and contains the domains necessary for polycystin-2 interaction (7Kim E. Arnould T. Sellin L.K. Benzing T. Fan M.J. Gruning W. Sokol S.Y. Drummond I. Walz G. J. Biol.

The fusion protein also includes a transmembrane anchor composed of the ectodomain of PLAP and the transmembrane region of VSV-G. This anchor allows polycystin-1w to span the cell membrane, and encodes no dominant sorting information. Thus, the subcellular localization of the fusion protein is determined solely by the portion of its sequence corresponding to the polycystin-1 C-terminal tail. A control construct, PLAP-GAT2, was created by replacing this region with the C-terminal 49 amino acids of GAT2, an unrelated membrane protein. PLAP-VSV-G fusion proteins containing this region of GAT2 have been shown to localize predominantly at the plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells. 2D. H. Grimm, Y. Cai, V. Chauvet, V. Rajendran, R. Zeltner, L. Geng, E. D. Avner, W. Sweeney, S. Somlo, and M. J. Caplan, unpublished data. Varied levels of expression of polycystin-1w were achieved by subcloning the cDNA encoding it (PKD1-W) into two separate vectors: PCDNA3.1, which contains a cytomegalovirus promoter that drives strong expression, and KRSPA, which contains a weaker RSV promoter. This resulted in the constructs PKD1-W(3) and PKD1-W(K), respectively. To determine the relative polycystin-1w expression level of these constructs, each construct was transfected into duplicate sets of COS-7 cells. The average number of transfected cells was determined via immunofluorescence on one set of cells, whereas the total quantity of fusion protein expressed was determined via densitometry analysis on a Western blot of the total cell lysate from the other set of cells. The densitometry figure divided by the immunofluorescence figure gave a value proportional to the average expression of each construct per transfected cell. In this manner, we were able to demonstrate that, on average, ∼6 times more polycystin-1w per transfected cell is expressed from PKD1-W(3) than from PKD1-W(K) (Fig. 3A). Polycystin-1w Localizes to the Plasma Membrane and Endoplasmic Reticulum—Live COS-7 cells transiently transfected with PKD1-W(3) or PKD1-W(K) were incubated at 4 °C with an anti-PLAP monoclonal antibody, followed by a blocking concentration of anti-mouse"
https://openalex.org/W2057511144,"Mammalian enzymes in late cholesterol biosynthesis have been localized uniformly over the endoplasmic reticulum by enzymatic methods. We report here the first mammalian cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme unequivocally localized at the surface of intracellular lipid storage droplets. NAD(P)H steroid dehydrogenase-like protein (Nsdhl), a mammalian C-3 sterol dehydrogenase involved in the conversion of lanosterol into cholesterol, was localized on lipid droplets by immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation. Nsdhl was localized on lipid droplets even when cell growth exclusively depended on cholesterol biosynthesis mediated by this enzyme. Depletion of fatty acids in culture medium reduced the development of lipid droplets and caused Nsdhl redistribution to the endoplasmic reticulum. Elevating oleic acid in medium induced well developed, Nsdhl-positive lipid droplets, and simultaneously caused a reduction in cellular conversion of lanosterol into cholesterol. Manipulated human NSDHL with a missense mutation (G205S) causing a human embryonic developmental disorder, congenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform nevus and limb defects (CHILD) syndrome, could no longer be localized on lipid droplets. Although the expression of wild-type NSDHL could restore the defective growth of a CHO cholesterol auxotroph, LEX2 in cholesterol-deficient medium, the expression of NSDHL(G205S) failed to do so. These results point to functional significance of the localization of Nsdhl on lipid droplets. Functional significance was also suggested by the colocalization of Nsdhl on lipid droplets with TIP47, a cargo selection protein for mannose 6-phosphate receptors from late endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. These results add to the growing notion that the lipid droplet is an organelle endowed with more complex roles in various biological phenomena."

The structural mechanism for the S-ovalbumin formation has long been a puzzling question in food science and serpin structural biology. On the basis of the commonly observed serpin thermostabilization by insertion of the reactive center loop into the proximal β-sheet, the most widely accepted hypothetical model has included partial loop insertion. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, the crystal structure of S-ovalbumin at 1.9-Å resolution. This structure unequivocally excludes the partial loop insertion mechanism; the overall structure, including the reactive center loop structure, is almost the same as that of native ovalbumin, except for the significant motion of the preceding loop of strand 1A away from strand 2A. The most striking finding is that Ser-164, Ser-236, and Ser-320 take the d-amino acid residue configuration. These chemical inversions can be directly related to the irreversible and stepwise nature of the transformation from native ovalbumin to S-ovalbumin. As conformational changes of the side chains, significant alternations are found in the values of the χ1 of Phe-99 and the χ3 of Met-241. The former conformational change leads to the decreased solvent accessibility of the hydrophobic core around Phe-99, which includes Phe-180 and Phe-378, the highly conserved residues in serpin.

This transformation is a serious problem for food processing, because egg white that includes S-ovalbumin forms a heat-induced gel with poor strength (3Shitamori S. Kojima E. Nakamura R. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1984; 48: 1539-1544Google Scholar). S-ovalbumin is also generated during the development of fertilized eggs (4Hatta H. Nomura M. Takahashi N. Hirose M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2001; 65: 2021-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 5Sugimoto Y. Sanuki S. Ohsako S. Higashimoto Y. Kondo M. Kurawaki J. Ibrahim H.R. Aoki T. Kusakabe T. Koga K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11030-11037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The conversion of native ovalbumin to S-ovalbumin has been accounted for by an elevation of egg white pH due to the release of carbon dioxide through the eggshell, and it can be reproduced in vitro by an alkaline treatment (1Smith M.B. Back J.F. Nature. 1962; 193: 878-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 4Hatta H. Nomura M. Takahashi N. Hirose M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2001; 65: 2021-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To understand the protein thermostabilization mechanism, the structural difference between native ovalbumin and S-ovalbumin has been extensively investigated by spectroscopic and biochemical approaches. The obtained data, however, have been consistent with a variety of models, including deamidation (6Nakamura R. Takemori Y. Shitamori S. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1981; 45: 1653-1659Google Scholar), surface hydrophobicity change (7Nakamura. R. Ishimaru M. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1981; 45: 2775-2780Google Scholar), and secondary structure transition (8Kint S. Tomimatsu Y. Biopolymers. 1979; 18: 1073-1079Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Huntington J.A. Patston P.A. Gettins P.G.W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) mechanisms. As for secondary structure change, studies using far UV CD and Raman spectroscopy have concluded that a small loss of α-helix content and a concomitant increase in β-structure participate in S-ovalbumin formation (8Kint S. Tomimatsu Y. Biopolymers. 1979; 18: 1073-1079Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Huntington J.A. Patston P.A. Gettins P.G.W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), though a latter analysis from a different laboratory has been consistent with the absence of a secondary structure change (10Painter P.C. Koenig J.L. Biopolymers. 1976; 15: 2155-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This conclusion about the secondary structure transition along with alternative evidence have led to the proposal of a widely accepted model for S-ovalbumin formation that includes a partial insertion of the reactive center loop into the proximal β-sheet (9Huntington J.A. Patston P.A. Gettins P.G.W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Huntington J.A. Stein P.E. J. Chromatogr. 2001; 756: 189-198Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar). On the basis of structural similarity (12Hunt L.T. Dayhoff M.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 864-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 13Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), ovalbumin has been grouped as a member of the serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) superfamily. Serpin is a protein with metastable conformation, which undergoes a unique conformational change upon exertion of the inhibitory activity (14Gettins P.G.W. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 15Whisstock J. Skinner R. Lesk A.M. Trends Biochem.

Moyer R.W. Pemberton P.A. Remold-O'Donnell E. Salvesen G.S. Travis J. Whisstock J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33293-33296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar); following the proteolytic cleavage at the P1-P1′ site, the reactive center loop is inserted into the proximal β-sheet, and this insertion accompanies large thermostabilization of the protein (14Gettins P.G.W. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Although ovalbumin is a non-inhibitory serpin that lacks a loop insertion mechanism, its mutant, in which a hinge residue (Arg-339) for the motion of loop insertion is replaced by a less bulky one, is transformed into a significantly thermostabilized form following the canonical P1-P1′ cleavage (17Huntington J.A. Fan B Karlsson K.E. Deinum J. Lawrence D.A. Gettins P.E.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5432-5440Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18Yamasaki M. Arii Y. Mikami B. Hirose M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our crystallographic study has shown that the P1-P1′-cleaved and thermostabilized ovalbumin mutant assumes the fully loop-inserted conformation (18Yamasaki M. Arii Y. Mikami B. Hirose M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The acquisition of the loop insertion ability by the single residue substitution implies that ovalbumin also has the serpin metastable nature in the native form. The metastable nature of ovalbumin has appeared to support the partial loop-inserted model for the S-ovalbumin formation (9Huntington J.A. Patston P.A. Gettins P.G.W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Huntington J.A. Stein P.E. J. Chromatogr. 2001; 756: 189-198Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Some spectroscopic and biochemical studies have, however, strongly suggested the participation in S-ovalbumin formation of a structural mechanism other than the partial loop insertion. First, the results from 31P-NMR have revealed the absence of large conformational change on the reactive center loop; the distances between the phosphate group of Ser-344 and an artificially associated Mn2+ differ by only 0.4 Å for native ovalbumin and S-ovalbumin (19Goux W.J. Venkatasubramanian Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Second, the fully loop inserted, P1-P1′-cleaved ovalbumin mutant R339T is further thermostabilized by the alkaline treatment (20Yamamoto H. Takahashi N. Yamasaki M. Arii Y. Hirose M. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 2003; 67: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The aim of the current study is to reach a crucial conclusion concerning S-ovalbumin structure by the use of crystallographic evidence. Materials—Native ovalbumin was isolated from fresh eggs by crystallization in an ammonium sulfate solution (21Sörensen S.P.L. Höyrup M. C. R. Trav. Lab. Carlsberg. 1915; 12: 12-67Google Scholar). Egg white ovalbumin comprises the three components of A1-, A2-, and A3-ovalbumin, which contain two, one, and no phosphorus atoms, respectively (22Kitabatake N. Ishida A. Doi E. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1988; 52: 967-973Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The major component, A1-ovalubmin, was isolated by ion-exchange chromatography as described (22Kitabatake N. Ishida A. Doi E. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1988; 52: 967-973Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). S-ovalbumin was prepared by incubation of A1-ovalbumin in 0.1 m glycine-NaOH buffer, pH 10, at 30 °C for 7 days. The sample was passed through a Sephadex column (NAP-10, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and subjected to analysis by differential scanning calorimetry and crystallization for structural determination. S-ovalbumin was also produced in eggs that had been stored at 30 °C for one month (1Smith M.B. Back J.F. Nature. 1962; 193: 878-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). S-ovalbumin was isolated from the stored eggs by crystallization in an ammonium sulfate solution in the same way. The isolation of an ovalbumin component by ion-exchange chromatography, however, did not work for S-ovalbumin. For thermostability analysis, therefore, the non-fractionated S-ovalbumin sample was used. Attempts to produce a fine crystal from the S-ovalbumin preparation were unsuccessful. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—Native ovalbumin and S-ovalbumin samples were analyzed for their thermostability with a calorimeter (MCS-DSC, Micro Cal, Massachusetts). Ovalbumin samples were equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and then degassed for 10 min under reduced pressure prior to calorimetric analysis. Crystallization of S-ovalbumin—The solution in the crystallization drop was prepared by mixing 3 μl of protein solution (90 mg/ml, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0) with 3 μl of precipitant solution (48–50% ammonium sulfate filtered, 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0). The droplets were equilibrated against 1 ml of the precipitant solution at 30 °C. Crystals were obtained within 2–3 months. To confirm that the crystals were really from S-ovalbumin and not from native ovalbumin, a few of them were rinsed three times with 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 55% ammonium sulfate, dissolved in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), and then subjected to analysis by differential scanning calorimetry. Data Collection and Refinement—Diffraction data were collected at the SPring-8 BL44XU beamline (Hyogo, JAPAN) using a wavelength of 0.9 Å with an Oxford PX210 CCD detector. A total of 253,412 reflections was collected to 1.8 Å. The data were processed, merged, and scaled with the D*Trek program and truncated with the CCP4 program package (23Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The precession images indicated that the crystal belongs to space group P1. Four molecules were included in an asymmetric unit. The initial model was made by the molecular replacement with the dimmer structure of native ovalbumin resolved at 1.95 Å (24Stein P.E. Leslie A.G.W. Finch J.T. Turnell W.G. McLaughlin P.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1990; 347: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 25Stein P.E. Leslie A.G.W. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 941-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) using Amore in the CCP4 program (26Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Several rounds of restrained least squares refinement was done at 1.9-Å resolution by simulated annealing with molecular dynamics in the CNS program package (27Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). To improve the model, manual model building was carried out using TURBO-FRODO. Eight hundred and seventy-one water molecules having more than 3σ on the Fo – Fo map were then added to the model. The final model was determined with an R-factor value of 0.196 (R free = 0.247) for 99,562 reflections with F > 2σ(F) between 20–1.9-Å resolution. Solvent accessible area was calculated using the NACCESS program (28Hubbard S.J. Thornton J.M. NACCESS Computer Program. Department of Biochemistry, University College, Londoncular Biology1993Google Scholar). Thermostability of S-ovalbumin Utilized for Crystallization—A1-ovalbumin (native ovalbumin) prepared from fresh hen egg white displayed the denaturation temperature of 77.7 °C (Fig. 1, profile a). The ovalbumin sample from the egg white after storage in shell eggs at 30 °C for one month displayed a thermostability peak of S-ovalbumin with increased Tm value of 85.8 °C (Fig. 1, profile b). The isolation of A1-S-ovalubmin from this sample by conventional chromatography did not work. To prepare A1-S-ovalbumin, therefore, we incubated in vitro native A1-ovalbumin in an alkaline condition. The alkaline-treated ovalbumin sample also showed the increased Tm values of 85.5 °C (Fig. 1, profile c), which indicates total transformation of native ovalbumin into S-ovalbumin without the inclusion of the intermediate. It was confirmed that the crystal obtained from this protein sample is indeed that of S-ovalbumin; the solubilized protein crystal displayed essentially the same increased thermostability with a Tm value of 85.1 °C (Fig. 1, profile d). Structural Determinations—The crystal structure of S-ovalbumin was determined at 1.9-Å resolution. The relevant refinement statistics and the final model data are shown in Table I and Table II, respectively. The mode of the crystal packing of the four molecules was very similar for S-ovalbumin and native ovalbumin (24Stein P.E. Leslie A.G.W. Finch J.T. Turnell W.G. McLaughlin P.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1990; 347: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 25Stein P.E. Leslie A.G.W. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 941-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The four molecules of S-ovalbumin were, therefore, assigned according to the native ovalbumin molecules. Molecule A consisted of 383 amino acid residues (positions 202 and 203, missing residues), 252 water molecules, two phosphoserine residues, two N-acetylglucosamine residues, and two sulfate molecules. Molecule B consisted of 385 amino acid residues, 220 water molecules, one phosphoserine residue, one N-acetylglucosamine residue, and two sulfate molecules. Molecule C consisted of 374 amino acid residues (positions 343–353, missing residues), 214 water molecules, no phosphoserine residues, two N-acetylglucosamine residues, and one sulfate molecule. Molecule D consisted of 385 amino acid residues, 185 water molecules, two phosphoserine residues, one N-acetylglucosamine residue, and two sulfate molecules. The C a atoms of the S-ovalbumin molecules were superimposed well with those of native ovalbumin molecules; the root mean square deviation values estimated by TURBO/rigid2 were 0.326 Å for 374 C a atoms of molecule A, 0.332 Å for 362 C a atoms of molecule B, 0.295 Å for 360 C a atoms of molecule C, and 0.288 Å for 377 C a atoms of molecule D.Table ISummary of data collection and refinementData collectionResolution limit (Å)1.8Unit cella62.6b70.9c83.4α87.2β71.7γ75.9Space groupP1Total measurements253,412Unique measurements122,497Averaged redundancy2.2Completeness (%)95.5R sym (%)4.7Refinement statisticsResolution range (Å)20-1.9Used reflections99,562Completeness (%)96.1R-factor (%)19.6R free (%)24.7Root mean square deviationBond length (Å)0.01Bond angles (degrees)1.5 Open table in a new tab Table IIFinal model of the four molecules in the asymmetric unitSegment IdentificationABCDModeled protein residues1-201, 204-3851-3851-342, 354-3851-385Waters252220214185Sulfates2212Carbohydrates2221Averaged B-factor (Å2)29.729.128.127.4 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2a displays the structure of molecule D that has the lowest B-factor value among the four molecules. One of the most important findings was that the reactive center loop of S-ovalbumin assumes almost exactly the same conformation as that of native ovalbumin (24Stein P.E. Leslie A.G.W. Finch J.T. Turnell W.G. McLaughlin P.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1990; 347: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 25Stein P.E. Leslie A.G.W. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 941-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) without any insertion into the proximal β-sheet (Sheet A, Fig. 2a). This clearly excludes the previously hypothesized partial loop insertion mechanism for the S-ovalbumin formation (9Huntington J.A. Patston P.A. Gettins P.G.W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Huntington J.A. Stein P.E. J. Chromatogr. 2001; 756: 189-198Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Comparison with the Native Ovalbumin Structure—When the overall structure is compared by the C a traces, S-ovalbumin displays a very similar conformation to native ovalbumin except for the marked motion of preceding loop of strand 1A away from strand 2A (residues 125–128, Fig. 2b). To our great surprise, Ser-236 was clearly detected as the amino acid residue with the d-configuration by both the 2Fo – Fc and omit maps; the residues exist on the turn from strand 2B to strand 3B, which is exposed to the solvent without making interactions with surrounding residues (Fig. 3a). In addition, Ser-164 and Ser-320 were detected as the d-amino acid residues; the Fo – Fc map of the residues, though less clear than that of Ser-236, allowed the d-configuration only (Fig. 3, b and c). Significant transitions of side-chain conformation were found in Phe-99 on strand 2A and in Met-241 on strand 3B (Fig. 2b). The χ1 value of Phe-99 and the χ3 value of Met-241 were decreased by 111° and 167.9°, respectively, in S-ovalbumin. In addition, slight changes of the side-chain conformation are observed in the residues that surround the side chain of Phe-99, as shown in Fig. 4. The surrounding residues include Ile-32 on helix B, Leu-87 and Ile-90 on helix D, Ile-178 on strand 3A, Met-239 on strand 3B, and Leu-377 on strand 5B. The sum of solvent accessibility of the residues (Ile-90, Thr-91, Tyr-97, Leu-101, Ile-178, Val-179, Phe-180, Met-239, and Phe-378) that make van der Waals contacts with Phe-99 is decreased by 29 Å2 according to the conversion from native ovalbumin to S-ovalbumin. In contrast, there are no significant changes in the surrounding residue conformations around Met-241. The crystal structure, solved here, provides crucial information about the structural mechanism of the S-ovalbumin formation, which has been one of the major unsolved questions in the serpin structural biology and the food science of the egg white protein. Structural Characteristics of S-ovalbumin—Serpins have been shown to increase their thermostability by the insertion of a reactive center loop into the proximal β-sheet; the typical serpin thermostabilization involves the full loop insertion in the P1-P1′-cleaved form (14Gettins P.G.W. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 18Yamasaki M. Arii Y. Mikami B. Hirose M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Kaslik G. Kardos J. Szabó E. Szilágyi L. Závodszky P. Westler W.M. Markley J.L. Gráf L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5455-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and a non-cleaved latent form (14Gettins P.G.W. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 30Lawrence D.A. Olson S.T. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3643-3648Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The crystal evidence presented here clearly demonstrates that S-ovalbumin assumes an alternative class of the thermostabilized serpin structure. The thermostabilized S-ovalbumin structure does not include any loop insertion. This unequivocally excludes the possibility of the previous structural model of S-ovalbumin in which a partial loop insertion is hypothesized to play a central role for the thermostabilization (9Huntington J.A. Patston P.A. Gettins P.G.W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Huntington J.A. Stein P.E. J. Chromatogr. 2001; 756: 189-198Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The overall structure, including the reactive center loop structure, is almost the same as that of native ovalbumin, except for the significant motion of the preceding loop of strand 1A away from strand 2A and the changes in the side-chain conformation of Phe-99 and Met-241 (Figs. 2 and 4). The most striking finding was that Ser-164, Ser-236, and Ser-320 take the d-amino acid residue configuration (Fig. 3). Previous crystallographic and thermodynamic data on ovalbumin stress the crucial participation of a small P14 hinge residue for the loop insertion. The hinge residue corresponds to Arg-339 in wild-type ovalbumin, and loop insertion ability is gained by its replacement by a less bulky residue such as the serine (17Huntington J.A. Fan B Karlsson K.E. Deinum J. Lawrence D.A. Gettins P.E.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5432-5440Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) or threonine (18Yamasaki M. Arii Y. Mikami B. Hirose M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) residue. The native structural characteristic of Arg-339 is retained in the S-ovalbumin crystal structure (data not shown). The absence of the loop insertion in S-ovalbumin is consistent with the conclusion that the presence of a small P14 hinge residue is essential for loop insertion. Configurational Inversions of Restricted Serine Residues— Under alkaline conditions, d-Ser can be generated in two ways; one way is through the dehydroalanine intermediate, and the other is through the C a carbanion intermediate (31Bada J.L. Barrett G.C. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Amino Acids. Chapman and Hall, New York1985: 399-414Google Scholar). The former intermediate is usually derived from a phosphoserine residue through dephosphorylation (31Bada J.L. Barrett G.C. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Amino Acids. Chapman and Hall, New York1985: 399-414Google Scholar). The racemization through a dehydroalanine intermediate is, however, very unlikely, because Ser-68 and Ser-344 are confirmed to be phosphorylated in the present S-ovalbumin structure as in native ovalbumin (24Stein P.E. Leslie A.G.W. Finch J.T. Turnell W.G. McLaughlin P.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1990; 347: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 25Stein P.E. Leslie A.G.W. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 941-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The latter process depends on the electron-withdrawing and resonance-stabilizing capacities of amino acids (31Bada J.L. Barrett G.C. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Amino Acids. Chapman and Hall, New York1985: 399-414Google Scholar). Among all the non-glycine amino acids, Ser has the highest electron withdrawing capacity and the fastest racemization rates (31Bada J.L. Barrett G.C. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Amino Acids. Chapman and Hall, New York1985: 399-414Google Scholar). Therefore, it is very likely that d-Ser was generated through the carbanion intermediate during the alkaline treatment. The production of S-ovalbumin depends on the elevation of pH of egg white in developing fertilized (4Hatta H. Nomura M. Takahashi N. Hirose M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2001; 65: 2021-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 5Sugimoto Y. Sanuki S. Ohsako S. Higashimoto Y. Kondo M. Kurawaki J. Ibrahim H.R. Aoki T. Kusakabe T. Koga K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11030-11037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and stored unfertilized eggs (1Smith M.B. Back J.F. Nature. 1962; 193: 878-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 2Smith M.B. Back J.F. Aust. J. Biol. Sci. 1965; 18: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Another major egg white protein, ovotransferrin, does not undergo any thermostabilization under the same egg white conditions (4Hatta H. Nomura M. Takahashi N. Hirose M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2001; 65: 2021-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Among the 34 serine residues, 31 are confirmed to take the l-configuration; only Ser-164, Ser-236, and Ser-320, which assume the l-configuration in the native ovalbumin, are detected as the d-amino acid residues in the present S-ovalbumin structure (Figs. 2 and 3). The question then arises as to why the configurational inversion occurs on the restricted amino acid residues of ovalbumin. We speculate that the unique inversion is directly related to the serpin-metastable nature of ovalbumin. The native serpin structure has been considered as a kinetically trapped metastable intermediate during protein folding in vivo (32Lee K.N. Park S.D. Yu M.-H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 33Im H. Ahn H.-Y. Yu M.-H. Protein Science. 2000; 9: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Serpins are considered to have many local strains in the native structure (32Lee K.N. Park S.D. Yu M.-H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 33Im H. Ahn H.-Y. Yu M.-H. Protein Science. 2000; 9: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that provide, upon exertion of the serpin inhibitory activity, the driving force for the loop insertion. On the basis of the unique structural characteristics of serpins, it is reasonably assumed that some strained thermodynamic situations in native ovalbumin are released by the configurational inversion, thereby increasing the overall stability of ovalbumin. Mode of Ovalbumin Denaturation and Implications for Thermostabilization—Previous studies of ovalbumin denaturation may provide important insights into the thermostabilization problem in S-ovalbumin. In the presence of a high concentration of urea, ovalbumin is transformed into a randomly coiled, fully denatured state (34Tatsumi E. Takahashi N. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28062-28067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); from this fully denatured state, ovalbumin correctly refolds into the native form under native folding conditions (35Takahashi N. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11565-11572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Onda M. Tatsumi E. Takahashi N. Hirose M. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 37Onda M. Tatsumi E. Takahashi N. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3973-3979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 38Onda M. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23600-23609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The conversion between the native and fully denatured states is, therefore, completely reversible in ovalbumin. Another important point is that, during this reversible interconversion, an intermediate state with partially folded molten globule-like conformation is produced (37Onda M. Tatsumi E. Takahashi N. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3973-3979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 38Onda M. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23600-23609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The reversible interconversion is also confirmed for the thermal denaturation system (39Tani F. Shirai N. Onishi T. Venelle F. Yasumoto K. Doi E. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1491-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Unlike the urea-induced denaturation system, however, ovalbumin denatured at a high temperature assumes molten globule conformation, but the fully denatured one does not (40Tani F. Murata M. Higasa T. Goto M. Kitabatake N. Doi E. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1995; 43: 2325-2331Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These results highlight the importance of the free energy difference between the native and molten globule states as the determinant for ovalbumin thermal stability. The free energy of a protein state depends on its entropy and enthalpy. Possible thermodynamic factors that work singly or in combination for thermal stabilization are the decreased enthalpy and increased entropy for the native state and the increased enthalpy and decreased entropy for the molten globule state. Some of the characteristics of the crystal structure may be related to the decreased enthalpy of the native form of S-ovalbumin. With respect to conformational transition, the motion of the preceding loop of strand1A away from strand2A and the changes in the side-chain conformation of Phe-99 and Met-241 are detected (Fig. 2b). The conformational change in the Phe-99 side chain induces a decrease in the solvent accessibility of the surrounding residues (Ile-90, Thr-91, Tyr-97, Leu-101, Ile-178, Val-179, Phe-180, Met-239, and Phe-378) by 29 Å2. The surrounding residues include Phe-180 and Phe-378, which are two of the 51 conserved residues in the serpin superfamily that are considered important for serpin structural stability (41Irving J.A. Pike R.N. Lesk A.M. Whisstock J.C. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1845-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). These strongly suggest that the rearrangement of the hydrophobic core around Phe-99 strengthens the packing of helix B, helix D, sheet A, and sheet B, which makes a prominent contribution to the structural stability of ovalbumin as a serpin (Fig. 4). The conformational change that comprises the motion of the preceding loop of strand 1A away from strand 2A has also been observed for serpin 1K upon the formation of the Michaelis complex with trypsin (42Ye S. Cech A.L. Belmares R. Bergstrom R.C. Tong Y. Corey D.R. Kanost M.R. Goldsmith E.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 979-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although the thermostabilization by the complex formation has not been experimentally confirmed for serpin 1K, α2-antiplasmin is considered to exert the inhibitory activity by the structural stabilization upon the formation of the noncovalent Michaelis-like complex with a serine proteinase (16Silverman G.A. Bird P.I. Carrell R.W. Church F.C. Coughlin P.B Gettins P.G.W. Irving J.A. Lomas D.A. Luke C.J. Moyer R.W. Pemberton P.A. Remold-O'Donnell E. Salvesen G.S. Travis J. Whisstock J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33293-33296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 43Shieh B.H. Potempa J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13420-13423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The motion of strand 1A might, therefore, correspond to a structural transition that is related to the structural relaxation in serpin. In regard to the configurational inversions of the three serine residues, the present crystal structure cannot be directly related to the decreased enthalpy for the native form; all the Ser-164, Ser-236, and Ser-320 residues reside on the protein surface in either native ovalbumin or S-ovalbumin and do not have any direct interactions with surrounding residues. The molten globule state of ovalbumin is the protein state that has about half of the native secondary structure, some fluctuating nature, and a native-like compact conformation (38Onda M. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23600-23609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The structural situation in which the d-amino acid residues reside on the polypeptide sequence in a non-localized way might result in a modulated non-native conformational state, which works as a thermostabilization factor by increasing the enthalpy and/or decreasing entropy in the molten globule state. The modulated molten globule state might be also related to the poor strength of the thermally induced S-ovalbumin gel (3Shitamori S. Kojima E. Nakamura R. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1984; 48: 1539-1544Google Scholar). Related Spectroscopic and Biochemical Observations—Since the discovery of the thermostabilized S-ovalbumin formation in stored eggs, the underlying structural mechanism has been extensively investigated by spectroscopic and biochemical analyses. The conclusions reached about the participation of a conformational alteration have been controversial. As spectroscopic observations that support the conformational transition, a 2–5% loss of α-helix (9Huntington J.A. Patston P.A. Gettins P.G.W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and a 3–4% increased β-sheet content (8Kint S. Tomimatsu Y. Biopolymers. 1979; 18: 1073-1079Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) have been detected by far UV CD and Raman spectroscopy analyses, respectively. An earlier study by the same Raman spectroscopy has, however, been consistent with the absence of a secondary structure change upon the formation of S-ovalbumin (10Painter P.C. Koenig J.L. Biopolymers. 1976; 15: 2155-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The results from 31P-NMR have also been consistent with the absence of large conformational change, at least on the reactive center loop; the distances between the phosphate group of Ser-344 and an artificially associated Mn2+ differ by only 0.4 Å for native ovalbumin and S-ovalbumin (19Goux W.J. Venkatasubramanian Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The conformational changes found in the crystal structure of S-ovalbumin are very limited and do not include any secondary structure segment. The small conformational change detected by the spectroscopic analyses (8Kint S. Tomimatsu Y. Biopolymers. 1979; 18: 1073-1079Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Huntington J.A. Patston P.A. Gettins P.G.W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) cannot, therefore, be related to the conformational changes found in the crystal structure. Instead, we speculate that the spectroscopic changes are related to the inherent ovalbumin nature that tends to be transformed into the molten globule state under some non-physiological conditions. Most of the egg white ovalbumin molecules are transformed into S-ovalbumin under the commonly employed alkaline conditions (e.g. pH10, 55 °C, 16–24 h). Under the equivalent alkaline conditions for recombinant ovalbumin, however, a much decreased recovery of the S-ovalbumin production has been found (44Arii Y. Takahashi N. Tatsumi E. Hirose M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 1392-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and a better recovery can be attained at a less drastic temperature of 50 °C (20Yamamoto H. Takahashi N. Yamasaki M. Arii Y. Hirose M. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 2003; 67: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These results are probably due to the slightly destabilized nature of the recombinant protein because of the absence of post-translational modification such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, and N-terminal acetylation (44Arii Y. Takahashi N. Tatsumi E. Hirose M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 1392-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the disulfide-reduced form of egg white ovalbumin, which assumes the native conformation with a slightly less stability (45Takahashi N. Koseki T. Doi E. Hirose M. J. Biochem. 1991; 109: 846-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), is almost totally transformed into the molten globule state by the alkaline treatment (46Takahashi N. Tatsumi E Orita T. Hirose M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1996; 60: 1464-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The commonly employed alkaline condition may be therefore a marginal one for maintaining the conformational stability of native egg white ovalbumin. The non-native conformational state seriously loses the CD signal of α-helix in the far UV region (38Onda M. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23600-23609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and tends to make intermolecular interactions through β-sheet formation (10Painter P.C. Koenig J.L. Biopolymers. 1976; 15: 2155-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It seems reasonable to hypothesize that the spectroscopic observations of the 2–5% loss of α-helix (9Huntington J.A. Patston P.A. Gettins P.G.W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and 3–4% increase in the β-sheet content (8Kint S. Tomimatsu Y. Biopolymers. 1979; 18: 1073-1079Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) come from a partial denaturation of native ovalbumin during the alkaline treatment. An alternative observation that S-ovalbumin displays a slightly higher binding capacity against a hydrophobic fluorescent dye, aniline-1-naphthalene-8-sulfonate (7Nakamura. R. Ishimaru M. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1981; 45: 2775-2780Google Scholar), can also be accounted for by the partial denaturation because the molten-globule state of ovalbumin shows a much higher dye binding capacity than native and fully denatured ovalbumin (38Onda M. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23600-23609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The partially loop-inserted conformer model largely depended on the observation that S-ovalbumin received a cleavage by elastase with a 38-fold greater rate than did native ovalbumin (9Huntington J.A. Patston P.A. Gettins P.G.W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Huntington J.A. Stein P.E. J. Chromatogr. 2001; 756: 189-198Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This observation, however, was based on a commercially available, non-purified ovalbumin preparation in which the presence of protein components other than native ovalbumin was detected by differential scanning calorimetry (9Huntington J.A. Patston P.A. Gettins P.G.W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In our re-examination using highly purified ovalbumin, no significant increase in the elastase susceptibility has been detected for S-ovalbumin (20Yamamoto H. Takahashi N. Yamasaki M. Arii Y. Hirose M. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 2003; 67: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Although the reason for this discrepancy about protease susceptibility is not clear, the egg white is a well known source for a variety of potent proteinase inhibitors, including ovomucoid, ovoinhibitor, and ovostatin (47Saxena I. Tayyab S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It would be possible that the apparent higher protease susceptibility of S-ovalbumin (9Huntington J.A. Patston P.A. Gettins P.G.W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) depends on inactivation of contaminated proteinase inhibitor(s) by the alkaline treatment. In conclusion, the crystal structure solved in the present paper clearly demonstrates the participation in the S-ovalbumin formation of a structural mechanism other than the partial loop insertion. This is consistent with our previous observation that the P1-P1′-cleaved, fully loop-inserted ovalbumin mutant R339T is converted to a further thermostabilized form by an alkaline treatment (20Yamamoto H. Takahashi N. Yamasaki M. Arii Y. Hirose M. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 2003; 67: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Despite extensive literature about the conversion from native ovalbumin to S-ovalbumin, no evidence has been shown for the occurrence of the reverse reaction. Furthermore, we observe that native ovalbumin, the intermediate form, and S-ovalbumin refold correctly from the fully denatured state into the corresponding original non-denatured forms as evaluated by a variety of probes, including a thermostability analysis. 1N. Takahashi, M. Onda, K. Hayashi, M. Yamasaki, T. Mita, and M. Hirose, unpublished data. This irreversible nature between native ovalbumin, the intermediate form, and S-ovalbumin upon unfolding/refolding transition strongly suggests the participation of a chemical stepwise process for the S-ovalbumin formation. The present finding of the multiple d-Ser residues in S-ovalbumin, therefore, leads us to hypothesize that the configurational inversion of the amino acid residues plays a central role for the formation of the thermostabilized ovalbumin. The configurational inversions may accompany the observed conformational changes, such as the motion of the preceding loop of strand 1A away from strand 2A and the changes in the side-chain conformation of Phe-99.

https://openalex.org/W1973551603,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae responds to iron deprivation by increasing the transcription of genes involved in the uptake of environmental iron and in the mobilization of vacuolar iron stores. HMX1 is also transcribed under conditions of iron deprivation and is under the control of the major iron-dependent transcription factor, Aft1p. Although Hmx1p exhibits limited homology to heme oxygenases, it has not been shown to be enzymatically active. We find that Hmx1p is a resident protein of the endoplasmic reticulum and that isolated yeast membranes contain a heme degradation activity that is dependent on HMX1. Hmx1p facilitates the capacity of cells to use heme as a nutritional iron source. Deletion of HMX1 leads to defects in iron accumulation and to expansion of intracellular heme pools. These alterations in the regulatory pools of iron lead to activation of Aft1p and inappropriate activation of heme-dependent transcription factors. Expression of HmuO, the heme oxygenase from Corynebacterium diphtheriae, restores iron and heme levels, as well as Aft1p- and heme-dependent transcriptional activities, to those of wild type cells, indicating that the heme degradation activity associated with Hmx1p is important in mediating iron and heme homeostasis. Hmx1p promotes both the reutilization of heme iron and the regulation of heme-dependent transcription during periods of iron scarcity.

Hmx1p promotes both the reutilization of heme iron and the regulation of heme-dependent transcription during periods of iron scarcity. Iron is an essential nutrient for virtually all organisms, yet many organisms thrive in environments where the availability of iron is extremely low. Saccharomyces cerevisiae can survive tremendous changes in the abundance of environmental iron, and the strategies that allow cells to adapt to these changes are only partially understood. Under conditions of iron deprivation, S. cerevisiae expresses a set of genes involved in the acquisition of iron from the environment and the mobilization of iron from intracellular stores. These genes are under the control of the major iron-dependent transcriptional activator, Aft1p (1Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). A related transcription factor, Aft2p, also regulates a subset of the Aft1p regulon, but the role of Aft2p in iron homeostasis is not yet clear (2Blaiseau P.L. Lesuisse E. Camadro J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34221-34226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 3Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Ray E. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14322-14327Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The genes most strongly induced by Aft1p during iron deprivation are the cell wall mannoproteins encoded by FIT1, FIT2, and FIT3, which facilitate iron uptake by increasing the association of iron chelates with the cell wall (4Protchenko O. Ferea T. Rashford J. Tiedeman J. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Philpott C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49244-49250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Uptake of iron compounds at the cell surface can occur through a reductive mechanism that employs members of the FRE family of plasma membrane metalloreductases (5Dancis A. Klausner R.D.

Biol. 1994; 14: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Fre1p and Fre2p reduce ferric iron salts and iron chelates to the ferrous form, whereas Fre3p and Fre4p catalyze the reduction of ferric siderophores (7Yun C.W. Bauler M. Moore R.E. Klebba P.E. Philpott C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10218-10223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Siderophores are low molecular mass compounds secreted by bacteria and fungi that bind ferric iron with exceptionally high affinity. Fre5p and Fre6p have not been functionally characterized, whereas Fre7p is copper-regulated and not an Aft1p target gene (8Martins L.J. Jensen L.T. Simon J.R. Keller G.L. Winge D.R. Simons J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23716-23721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Reduced iron is taken up through a high affinity transport complex consisting of the Fet3p multicopper oxidase (9Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) and the Ftr1p iron permease (10Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Copper loading of Fet3p occurs in a post-Golgi compartment and requires the activities of the Atx1p copper chaperone (11Lin S.J. Pufahl R.A. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

A second, nonreductive system of high affinity iron uptake exhibits specificity for siderophore-iron chelates. S. cerevisiae takes up intact siderophore-iron chelates through the transporters encoded by ARN1, ARN2/TAF1, ARN3/SIT1, and ARN4/ENB1 (13Heymann P. Ernst J.F. Winkelmann G.

The Aft1p regulon includes a set of genes involved in the transport of metals into and out of the vacuole, a site of metal storage. 1C. C. Philpott, manuscript in preparation. The Ftr1p homologue, Fth1p, associates with a Fet3p homologue, Fet5p, and facilitates the mobilization of iron stores from the vacuole (19Urbanowski J.L. Piper R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38061-38070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Smf3p, which exhibits homology to mammalian iron transporters, is also localized to the vacuole and may participate in the mobilization of stored iron (20Portnoy M.E. Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cot1p is a vacuolar transporter involved in zinc homeostasis (21MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D.

Biol. 1992; 12: 3678-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and may serve to sequester other metals taken up under conditions of iron deprivation (23Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The plasma membrane biotin transporter encoded by VHT1 is an Aft1p target, and biotin uptake and synthesis are reciprocally regulated by iron. 1C. C. Philpott, manuscript in preparation. Additional Aft1p targets are two genes of unknown function: TIS11, a member of the CCCH family of zinc finger proteins, and HMX1, which exhibits homology to heme oxygenases. Heme oxygenases are found in a wide variety of organisms including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, where they play important roles in cellular metabolism. Heme oxygenase catalyzes the oxidative breakdown of heme to biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and iron in a reaction that requires three oxygen molecules and seven electrons (24Montellano P.R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In pathogenic bacteria, heme oxygenase activity is important for iron acquisition from host heme and heme proteins (25Wilks A. Schmitt M.P. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In higher plants and cyanobacteria, heme oxygenase is required for the synthesis of the light-harvesting pigments, which contain tetrapyrrols derived from biliverdin (27Cornejo J. Willows R.D. Beale S.I. Plant J. 1998; 15: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 28Davis S.J. Bhoo S.H. Durski A.M. Walker J.M. Vierstra R.D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 656-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Candida albicans expresses a heme oxygenase that is required for the utilization of heme as a nutritional iron source (29Santos R. Buisson N. Knight S. Dancis A. Camadro J.M. Lesuisse E. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Mammals express three isoforms of heme oxygenase and mice deficient in HO-1 are anemic and accumulate iron in liver and renal cells because of a defect in heme iron reutilization (30Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10919-10924Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Carbon monoxide produced by mammalian heme oxygenases can act as a signaling molecule (24Montellano P.R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Unlike C. albicans, S. cerevisiae lacks a high affinity system for heme uptake and is inefficient in the use of heme as a nutritional iron source (31Weissman Z. Shemer R. Kornitzer D. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1551-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Previous investigators have reported that S. cerevisiae lacks heme oxygenase activity, and a recent report indicates that when Hmx1p is overexpressed and purified, it has no heme oxygenase activity, although it does bind heme and exhibits weak peroxidase activity (32Auclair K. Huang H.W. Moenne-Loccoz P. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 28: 340-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Although HMX1 is transcriptionally activated by iron deprivation via Aft1p, the role of Hmx1p in the response to iron deprivation remains unclear. Here we report that deletion of HMX1 resulted in a decrease in heme degradation activity and that Hmx1p was important for heme iron reutilization and the homeostasis of regulatory pools of iron and heme. Yeast Strains, Media, and Plasmids—Strains were constructed in YPH499 (MATa ura3-52 lys2-801(amber) ade2-101(ochre) trp1-63 his3-200 leu2-1) (Yeast Genetic Stock Center, Berkeley, CA). PCR-mediated gene disruption was used to generate deletions of HMX1 (33Schneider B.L. Steiner B. Seufert W. Futcher A.B. Yeast. 1996; 12: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For deletion of HMX1, the YPH499 strain was transformed with a PCR product amplified from genomic DNA isolated from the strain RG4154 (MATa ura3 met-15 his3-1 leu2-1 ylr205cΔ::KANR) (Research Genetics) using the following primers 5′-CCGTGGAATTTGAGCCATGTAAC-3′ and 5′-GCCTCCCATGCAAGAGGGC-3′. Geneticin-resistant clones were selected on YPD plates containing 80 mg/liter G418 (Invitrogen), and transformants were screened by PCR to isolate the hmx1Δ strain. Deletion of FET3 was performed as described (34Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 212: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The HMX1-HA strain, which expresses a triple copy of the hemagglutinin (HA) 2The abbreviation used is: HA, hemagglutinin. epitope at the carboxyl terminus, was constructed by PCR epitope tagging as described using the plasmid pMPY-3×HA (35Schneider B.L. Seufert W. Steiner B. Yang Q.H. Futcher A.B. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and the following primers: 5′-GCGATCTGGGTTCTTTACTTCTTGGTAAAGAGTTTTCTTAGCATAGTAAGGGAACAAAAGCTGGAG-3′ and 5′-TTTTTCTCTTGCTGTTTTTCCTTCCCTATTCTTCATATTTTGATATTACTCTAGGGCGAATTGGGT-3′. Integration of the HA epitope was confirmed by PCR and by Western blotting. HA-tagged Hmx1p was confirmed to be functional by observing that the β-galactosidase activity of a FET3-lacZ reporter plasmid was identical in the HMX1-HA and the congenic HMX1+ strains. Rich medium (YPD) and synthetic defined medium (SD) were prepared as described (36Sherman F. Guthrie C. Fink G. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Vol. 194. Academic Press, New, York1991: 3-20Google Scholar). Defined iron media were prepared as described (37Philpott C.C. Rashford J. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Rouault T.A. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5026-5036Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) using yeast nitrogen base without iron and 1 mm ferrozine, an iron chelator, in addition to the indicated iron supplement. Hemin was added as a complex with bovine serum albumin. The plasmid pHmuO, which carries the HmuO gene of Corynebacterium diphtheriae under the control of the FET3 promoter, was used for expression of HmuO in yeast. Part of the FET3 promoter was amplified by PCR using the following primers 5′-CACACACTCGAGCTTCAAAAGTGCACCCATTTGCAG-3′ and 5′-ACACACGGATCCCATCTAGTTCTAATTTTTTGCTAC-3′ and then digested with XhoI and BamHI. A 0.65-kb DNA fragment carrying the HmuO gene was generated by PCR from plasmid pTH793 (gift of Dr. M. P. Schmitt) (25Wilks A. Schmitt M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 837-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) using the following primers: 5′-CACACAGGATCCATGACCACTGCAACCGCAGGC-3′ and 5′-CACACAGAGCTCCCATGGTTACAGGCCTTTACCCAAATC-3′ and was digested with BamHI and SstI. Both products were ligated into the XhoI and SstI sites of the plasmid pRS404 to yield pHmuO. The plasmid was linearized with BstXI and used to transform the hmx1Δ and YPH499 strains to tryptophan prototrophy. The sequences were aligned using MacVector (Oxford Molecular Group). Immunofluorescence and Western Blotting—The strains were grown to mid-log phase in defined iron medium containing 10 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate to induce the expression of Hmx1p. The cells were prepared for immunofluorescence microscopy as described (18Yun C.W. Ferea T. Rashford J. Ardon O. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Kaplan J. Philpott C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10709-10715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, the cells were disrupted with glass beads, and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 2 min. The membrane fraction was isolated by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 30 min. Western blotting was performed using a 1:5000 dilution of HA.11 as the primary antibody followed by 1:5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Antibody was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Assays—Heme degradation activity was measured by release of 55Fe from 55Fe-hemin as described (38Ferris C.D. Jaffrey S.R. Sawa A. Takahashi M. Brady S.D. Barrow R.K. Tysoe S.A. Wolosker H. Baranano D.E. Dore S. Poss K.D. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The membranes were isolated as for Western blotting, and the protein concentrations were determined in samples solubilized with 3% N-lauroylsarcosine. The 100-μl reaction mixture contained 0.1 mg of membrane protein, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium ascorbate, and 0.4 μm55Fe-hemin in complex with bovine serum albumin (39Tenhunen R. Marver H.S. Schmid R. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6388-6394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reactions were incubated 15 min at 30 °C. 10 μl of 1 mm unlabeled hemin/bovine serum albumin was added to stop the reaction. 40 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid was added to the reaction to precipitate intact 55Fe-hemin and proteins. The samples were incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 15 min, and 50 μl of supernatant was used for liquid scintillation counting. Boiled samples (10 min at 100 °C) of membranes were used as a control for nonenzymatic degradation of 55Fe-hemin. Heme degradation activity was determined after subtraction of nonenzymatic controls and expressed as a percentage of the wild type activity. 55Fe-heme was synthesized as described (40Galbraith R.A. Sassa S. Kappas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12198-12202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from protoporphyrin IX (Porphyrin Products, Logan, UT) and 55FeCl3 (New England Nuclear). Autoradiographs of thin layer chromatography on silica plates (EM Science) confirmed a single band identical to the unlabeled hemin standard. To measure heme and iron content, the cells were grown overnight in SD medium supplemented with 0.4 μm55Fe-ferrichrome. The cells were washed three times with medium without 55Fe-ferrichrome and two times in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4. The cells were disrupted with glass beads in the same buffer, and aliquots of cell lysate were used to determine iron content by scintillation counting. 55Fe-heme was extracted with n-butyl-acetate as described (41Lange H. Kispal G. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18989-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For β-galactosidase assays, the cells transformed with either a FET3-lacZ (gift of D. Winge) or a CYC1-lacZ (gift of A. Hinnebusch) reporter plasmid were grown to mid-log phase in defined iron medium containing the indicated amounts of ferrous ammonium sulfate. β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described (42Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 123-127Google Scholar). Sequence Analysis of Hmx1p—Hmx1p is 21% identical at the amino acid level to human HO-1 and 19% identical to HmuO, the heme oxygenase from C. diphtheriae. HmuO was selected for analysis because it is a well characterized prokaryotic heme oxygenase, and we examined a sequence alignment between Hmx1p, HO-1, and HmuO (Fig. 1). The crystal structure of human HO-1 has been reported, and the amino acid residues involved in heme binding and interaction with cytochrome P-450 reductase have been identified (43Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 44Wang J. De Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20069-20076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although the amino acid residues involved in binding heme and cytochrome P-450 reductase are conserved between HO-1 and HmuO, most of these residues are not conserved in Hmx1p. Specifically, the proximal heme ligand, His-25 in HO-1, is not conserved in Hmx1p, although this protein has been shown to bind heme (32Auclair K. Huang H.W. Moenne-Loccoz P. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 28: 340-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). A somewhat higher level of sequence conservation was observed in the “heme oxygenase motif” that is highly conserved among heme oxygenase family members (24Montellano P.R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). A potential carboxyl-terminal transmembrane domain was observed in Hmx1p, which suggested that it was similar to mammalian heme oxygenases in its localization to membranes. These observations indicated that it was not possible to determine whether HMX1 encoded a heme oxygenase enzyme solely on the basis of its primary structure. Localization of Hmx1p to the Endoplasmic Reticulum and Regulation of Protein Levels by Iron—Bacterial heme oxygenases are soluble proteins of the cytosol, whereas mammalian heme oxygenases are integral membrane proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (24Montellano P.R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We constructed a strain containing three copies of the HA epitope fused to the carboxyl terminus of HMX1 and examined the localization of Hmx1-HA by indirect immunofluorescence and by membrane fractionation and Western blotting. By immunofluorescence, Hmx1-HA was detected at the periphery of the cell and in an intracellular ring-like structure (Fig. 2A). This intracellular structure was confirmed to be the nucleus by staining with DAPI (Fig. 2, B and C). The peripheral and perinuclear distribution of Hmx1-HA in a “signet ring” pattern was identical to the characteristic pattern of proteins located in the endoplasmic reticulum of yeast (45Reilly B.A. Kraynack B.A. VanRheenen S.M. Waters M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3783-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 46Wang Q. Chang A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5972-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 47Baxter B.K. James P. Evans T. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6444-6456Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We confirmed that Hmx1p was localized to membranes by preparing lysates from cells expressing Hmx1-HA, separating the intracellular membranes from the cytosol by centrifugation at 18,000 × g and analyzing the resulting fractions by Western blotting (Fig. 2D). Hmx1-HA was detected predominately in the membrane fraction, and together these data suggested that Hmx1p was an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum, a localization identical to that of mammalian heme oxygenases. HMX1 is transcriptionally activated through Aft1p by iron deprivation,1 cobalt stress (48Stadler J.A. Schweyen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39649-39654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and defective mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster synthesis (49Foury F. Talibi D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7762-7768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and we questioned whether protein levels of Hmx1p would also reflect iron-mediated regulation. Cells of the Hmx1-HA strain were grown in medium containing varying concentrations of iron, the lysates were prepared, and Hmx1p levels were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 2E). Hmx1p was abundant in cells grown in low concentrations of iron, but much less was detected in cells grown in moderate concentrations of iron, and Hmx1p was virtually undetectable at the highest concentration of iron. These data are consistent with a role for Hmx1p in the response to iron deprivation as well as a role during growth in optimal iron conditions. Heme Degradation Activity of Hmx1p—To address whether Hmx1p was involved directly in the degradation of heme, we constructed an hmx1Δ strain and measured the capacity of isolated membranes to catalyze the release of 55Fe from 55Feheme (Fig. 3). Degradation of heme through the heme oxygenase reaction requires reducing equivalents, and ascorbate can provide these to reactions catalyzed by HO-1 (50Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4230-4236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and HmuO (51Chu G.C. Katakura K. Zhang X. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21319-21325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The addition of ascorbate stimulated heme degradation in the wild type strain but failed to stimulate degradation in the hmx1Δ strain. The membranes derived from the hmx1Δ strain exhibited less than half of the heme degradation activity that was present in membranes from wild type cells. These data indicated that Hmx1p functioned in the degradation of heme but also suggested the presence of an additional mechanism for heme degradation in yeast membranes. The Role of Hmx1p in the Utilization of Heme as a Nutritional Iron Source—Although S. cerevisiae lacks a high affinity transport system for heme, exogenous heme can rescue the metabolic defects of yeast carrying mutations in the heme biosynthetic pathway, indicating that heme can be taken up by this species (52Gollub E.G. Liu K.P. Dayan J. Adlersberg M. Sprinson D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2846-2854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated the role of Hmx1p in the utilization of heme as a nutritional iron source by measuring the growth of congenic HMX1+ and hmx1Δ strains in medium containing hemin as the only source of iron. Because hemin samples can contain small amounts of free iron, we inactivated the high affinity ferrous transport system in both strains by deletion of FET3. The addition of hemin to iron-depleted medium stimulated the growth of both the HMX1+ and hmx1Δ strains in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A), indicating that S. cerevisiae can use hemin as an iron source. However, the HMX1+ strain consistently grew to a higher density (Fig. 4A) and exhibited a higher growth rate (Fig. 4B) than the hmx1Δ strain at all concentrations of hemin, indicating that Hmx1p was important for the use of heme as a nutritional source of iron. The Role of Hmx1p in the Maintenance of Regulatory Pools of Cellular Iron—Although heme could serve as a nutritional source of iron for S. cerevisiae, this species typically relies on iron salts or chelates. Therefore, we investigated the role of Hmx1p in the uptake and maintenance of intracellular iron pools when yeast used iron salts or chelates as the nutritional source of iron. We also examined the capacity of the bacterial heme oxygenase, HmuO of C. diphtheriae, to functionally substitute for Hmx1p. We transformed the congenic HMX1+ and hmx1Δ strains with pHmuO or an empty vector and labeled the intracellular iron pools by growth overnight in medium supplemented with 55Fe-ferrichrome. Although all of the strains grew at similar rates, the hmx1Δ strain exhibited a lower level of iron accumulation than the HMX1+ strain, and expression of HmuO in the hmx1Δ strain partially restored iron accumulation (Fig. 5A). These results suggested that the heme degradation activity associated with Hmx1p contributed to the accumulation of intracellular iron. To test whether deletion of Hmx1p affected the regulatory pools of intracellular iron and, thus, the activation of Aft1p, we measured Aft1p activity by transforming the HMX1+ and the hmx1Δ strains with a lacZ reporter construct under the control of the FET3 promoter (Fig. 5B). Aft1p-dependent transcriptional activity is low in cells grown in higher concentrations of iron, but Aft1p activity increases as cells are grown in lower concentrations of iron. Both the HMX1+ and the hmx1Δ strains exhibited higher FET3-lacZ activities as the cells were grown in lower concentrations of iron. However, the hmx1Δ strain consistently exhibited activity more than 2-fold higher than that of the HMX1+ strain, indicating that Hmx1p was involved in maintaining regulatory pools of intracellular iron. To confirm that the heme degradation activity of Hmx1p was required to maintain the iron pools, we measured FET3-lacZ activities in the HMX1+ and the hmx1Δ strains transformed with pHmuO or the empty parent vector (Fig. 5C). Again, the hmx1Δ strain exhibited much higher activity than the HMX1+ strain, and expression of HmuO in the hmx1Δ strain lowered the FET3-lacZ activity to wild type levels, suggesting that the Hmx1p-mediated degradation of heme liberates iron that can be sensed by Aft1p. Expansion of Intracellular Heme Pools in the hmx1Δ Strain—If Hmx1p were involved in the degradation of intracellular heme pools, then the pool of heme subject to turnover would be larger in the hmx1Δ strain than in the HMX1+ strain. We tested this hypothesis by labeling the HMX1+ and hmx1Δ strains with 55Fe-ferrichrome, allowing the 55Fe to be incorporated into heme over a 16-h period of growth, and then measuring the amount of heme extracted from the cells (Fig. 6A). As predicted, the hmx1Δ strain contained a larger amount of extractable heme than did the HMX1+ strain, and again expression of HmuO reduced the heme content of the hmx1Δ strain to the level of the HMX1+ strain. In addition to serving as an oxygen-binding prosthetic group, heme is an important regulatory molecule in S. cerevisiae. Heme activates the transcription factors Hap1p and Hap2/3/4/5p, which promote the transcription of a number of genes involved in respiration and aerobic growth (53Kwast K.E. Burke P.V. Poyton R.O. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 1177-1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We tested whether deletion of Hmx1p affected regulatory pools of heme and the activity of the HAP transcription factors by measuring the activity of a HAP target, CYC1, fused to a lacZ reporter construct, in the HMX1+ and hmx1Δ strains (Fig. 6B). In the HMX1+ strain, CYC1-lacZ activity was low in cells grown in iron-poor medium but increased as the concentration of iron increased. This result suggested that heme levels and heme-dependent transcription increased as the availability of iron increased. In the hmx1Δ strain, CYC1-lacZ activity also increased as the concentration of iron increased, but the level of activity was 2–3-fold higher than in the HMX1+ strain, indicating an increase in heme-dependent transcription in the hmx1Δ strain. An exception was at the highest iron concentration, where CYC1-lacZ activity was similar in the HMX1+ and hmx1Δ strains, a result likely caused by the very low level of Hmx1p expressed in wild type cells at this iron concentration (Fig. 2E). Again, expression of HmuO in the hmx1Δ strain reduced CYC1-lacZ activity to wild type levels (Fig. 6C). Together, these data indicated that Hmx1p was required for the homeostasis of regulatory pools of intracellular heme. Here we have presented data indicating that Hmx1p is involved in the degradation of heme under conditions of iron deprivation. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether Hmx1p is a heme oxygenase enzyme. Previous investigators have reported that S. cerevisiae contains no heme oxygenase activity, that amino acid residues considered essential for heme binding are not conserved in Hmx1p, and that overexpressed, purified Hmx1p has no heme oxygenase activity (32Auclair K. Huang H.W. Moenne-Loccoz P. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 28: 340-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We report here, however, that membranes from yeast contained a heme degradation activity that was dependent on ascorbate and that this ascorbate-dependent activity was lost when HMX1 was deleted. Furthermore, disruptions of intracellular iron and heme homeostasis observed in the hmx1Δ strain were corrected by expression of the prokaryotic heme oxygenase, HmuO. Previous attempts to measure Hmx1p enzymatic activity in yeast employed detergent-solubilized protein, which may have altered activity. Although Hmx1p lacks the conserved histidine that serves as the proximal heme ligand, Hmx1p binds heme, and, in HmuO, mutation of this histidine residue to alanine resulted in only partial loss of heme oxygenase activity (54Wilks A. Moenne-Loccoz P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11686-11692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The heme oxygenase from Neisseria meningitidis displays relatively low sequence conservation with HO-1, and there are significant differences in their crystal structures; however, both enzymes catalyze the same reaction with the same regio-specificity (55Schuller D.J. Zhu W. Stojiljkovic I. Wilks A. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11552-11558Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 56Zhu W. Wilks A. Stojiljkovic I. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6783-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). If Hmx1p were not a bona fide heme oxygenase, it could be acting as a heme chaperone, facilitating degradation by binding heme, and either presenting it to the actual heme oxygenase or making it available for nonenzymatic degradation. In the transcriptional response to iron deprivation, S. cerevisiae expresses a number of genes involved in the mobilization of intracellular stores of iron, and we propose that Hmx1p functions in the reutilization of intracellular heme iron. Exogenous heme was more efficiently utilized as a nutritional source of iron in the strain that expressed Hmx1p than in the strain that did not. Deletion of HMX1 resulted in a higher level of Aft1p activation in iron-depleted cells, indicating that deletion led to greater iron deficiency. These data suggested that heme degradation increased when cells were grown under conditions of iron deprivation, that iron released from degraded heme was reused to meet metabolic needs, and that Hmx1p facilitated these processes. Deletion of HMX1 also resulted in a depletion of intracellular iron and an accumulation of intracellular heme in iron-replete cells. Heme may have a direct effect on the activity of Aft1p, 3J. Kaplan, personal communication. and therefore deletion of HMX1 could alter the “set point” for iron accumulation by raising heme levels. In addition to the recycling of heme iron, Hmx1p may have an important role in lowering the regulatory pools of heme when cells are starved for iron. Two lines of evidence suggest that, under conditions of iron deficiency, respiration is impaired. First, strains carrying a deletion of AFT1 or inactivation of the high affinity ferrous transport complex grow poorly on medium containing nonfermentable carbon sources. Second, wild type strains grow poorly on iron-poor medium containing nonfermentable carbon sources. 4C. C. Philpott and O. Protchenko, unpublished observations. Respiration requires the expression of iron-rich respiratory complexes involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and the cell may gain a survival advantage by diverting this iron to other processes during periods of iron deprivation. Hmx1p may facilitate this metabolic shift by degrading heme and thereby lowering the activity of the heme-dependent transcriptional activators, Hap1p and Hap2/3/4/5p, which activate the genes involved in aerobic growth, including the respiratory cytochromes (53Kwast K.E. Burke P.V. Poyton R.O. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 1177-1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Hmx1p serves the dual purposes of recycling iron and remodeling transcription during periods of limited iron availability.

Regulation of translation can be achieved by modulation of the activity of general translation factors or by specific interactions of regulatory proteins with control sequences located in the 5′- or 3′-untranslated regions (UTR) 1The abbreviations used are: UTR, untranslated region; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; TOP, terminal oligopyrimidine; rp, ribosomal proteins; CNBP, cellular nucleic acid-binding protein; mRNP, messenger ribonucleoprotein; DTT, dithiothreitol; RT, reverse transcription; eEF1α, eukaryotic elongation factor 1α. of mRNAs. The interaction of specific proteins with typical structural elements located in different mRNAs characterizes classes of functionally related mRNAs that are subjected to a concerted control as suggested in the recently proposed hypothesis of the posttranscriptional operons (1Keene J.D. Tenenbaum S.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1161-1167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). A classical example is the interaction of the iron-responsive element-binding protein with the iron-responsive element of different mRNAs for proteins involved in iron metabolism (2Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 655-670Google Scholar). Similarly, in erythroid cells, two different members of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family, hnRNP E1 and hnRNP E2, participate in controlling the stabilization of human α-globin mRNA (3Weiss I.M.

This indicates that one protein in different complexes can participate in different but functionally related post-transcriptional control pathways in the same cell and at the same stage of differentiation.

Dahlberg J.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 793-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, despite the mainly nuclear localization, cytoplasmic functions have been ascribed to La. Several studies have documented that La promotes the translation of certain viral RNA by binding to the 5′-UTR (21Meerovitch K. Svitkin Y.V. Lee H.S. Lejbkowicz F. Kenan D.J. Chan E.K. Agol V.I.

Korneluk R.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 4648-4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 26Kim Y.K. Back S.H. Rho J. Lee S.H. Jang S.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 5009-5016Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The common feature characterizing all of these La binding RNAs is the presence of a stretch of pyrimidine with which La interacts. As mentioned above, La interacts with TOP mRNAs in vertebrates. This class of mRNAs, which includes mRNAs for ribosomal proteins (rp-mRNAs) and for other factors involved in the production and function of the translational apparatus, is characterized by a similar 5′-UTR that starts with a TOP sequence (reviewed in Refs. 27Meyuhas O. Avni D. Shama S. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 363-388Google Scholar and 28Meyuhas O. Hornstein E. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 671-693Google Scholar) and is coordinately regulated at the translational level in a specific growth-dependent manner. This occurs through a modulation of the distribution of TOP mRNAs between translating polysomes and non-translating mRNPs that results in the increased or decreased coordinate synthesis of the corresponding proteins (8Pierandrei-Amaldi P. Campioni N. Beccari E. Bozzoni I. Amaldi F. Cell. 1982; 30: 163-171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29Geyer P.K. Meyuhas O. Perry R.P. Johnson L.F. Mol.

It has been found in amphibian and mammalian somatic cells that the 5′-UTR of TOP mRNAs is responsible for the control (31Mariottini P. Amaldi F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 816-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and that the TOP sequence is the cis element of the regulation, also by cooperating with a downstream region (32Levy S. Avni D. Hariharan N. Perry R.P. Meyuhas O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3319-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Furthermore, reciprocal transfection experiments demonstrated that the mechanisms underlying the control in mammalian and amphibian cells are conserved (33Avni D. Shama S. Loreni F. Meyuhas O. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 3822-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The conservation of the TOP sequence in these mRNAs and their coordinate translation in vivo suggested that some proteins might have a role in the regulation by binding the typical sequences. An extensive in vitro binding analysis was carried out using normal and mutated forms of the 5′-UTR and of the TOP sequence (6Cardinali B. Di Cristina M. Pierandrei-Amaldi P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2301-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 7Pellizzoni L. Lotti F. Rutjes S.A. Pierandrei-Amaldi P. J. Mol.

Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3319-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The outcome of these studies lead to the identification of two proteins: La and the cellular nucleic acid-binding protein (CNBP). These studies, which utilized either extracts or recombinant proteins, determined that La interacts with the TOP sequence both in Xenopus laevis and in mammalian cells while CNBP binds to the downstream region of the 5′-UTR (6Cardinali B.

Acta. 2001; 1521: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Further studies indicated that the 5′- UTR can assume alternative conformations, probably stabilized by the two proteins, compatible with different translational activities (7Pellizzoni L. Lotti F. Rutjes S.A. Pierandrei-Amaldi P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 593-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The role of La in the translational control of TOP mRNAs has been assayed in vivo by functional studies in Xenopus cell lines stably transfected with constructs expressing normal and mutated La. It has been found that this protein has a stimulatory effect on the translation of three endogenous TOP mRNAs, rp-L4 and rp-S1 mRNAs and translation factor eEF1α mRNA, as measured by their association with polysome (38Crosio C. Boyl P.P. Loreni F. Pierandrei-Amaldi P. Amaldi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2927-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Consistent results were obtained in the same study when La-expressing plasmids were co-transfected in human cells together with a plasmid expressing a reporter mRNA carrying a normal or a mutated TOP sequence (38Crosio C. Boyl P.P. Loreni F. Pierandrei-Amaldi P. Amaldi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2927-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Finally, a recent report in which a TOP/La and CNBP-based translation control system was used in mammalian cells (39Schlatter S. Senn C. Fussenegger M. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2003; 83: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) supports these results. Taking into account the above mentioned evidence that La binds the regulatory region of TOP mRNAs in vitro and activates their translation in vivo, we wanted to check whether La was associated with the endogenous mRNAs engaged with polysomes, the cellular compartment devoted to translation. Moreover, we determined the amount of La protein in the cytoplasm to establish whether it is present in this compartment to an extent consistent with binding and translational control of TOP mRNAs. We show that La is present in mRNP complexes engaged in translation and is bound to polysomes via mRNA. Furthermore, we have confirmed an association of La protein with TOP mRNAs in vivo, in agreement with the previous in vitro binding data and with the observed positive role in their translation. Biological Materials—X. laevis adults were purchased from Nasco (Fort Atkinson, WI). Artificially fertilized eggs were obtained from hormone-stimulated X. laevis females according to a previously reported procedure (40Rusconi S. Schaffner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5051-5055Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Jelly coat was removed after fertilization for 5 min with 0.2 m Tris, pH 8.8, and 3 mm DTT, extensively washed with 0.1× Barth solution (41Gurdon J.B. The Control of Gene Expression in Animal Development. Oxford University Press, Oxford1974Google Scholar) and incubated in the same solution containing streptomycin (250 units/ml) and penicillin (250 μg/ml) at 22 °C. Preparation of Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Samples—Groups of oocytes, dissected from a piece of ovary, were defolliculated by hand and kept in 0.2% bovine serum albumin in the Barth solution. Nuclei were dissected by forceps in Barth, 10% glycerol, and 1 oocyte in 1 ml of solution, which was changed with every dissection, and accumulated in ice in 100 μl of TKM homogenization buffer: 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 0.15 m KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, plus 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm DTT, and 100 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), which prevents La cleavage (34Pellizzoni L. Cardinali B. Lin-Marq N. Mercanti D. Pierandrei-Amaldi P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cytoplasms were accumulated in Eppendorf tubes in ice. Oocyte nuclei were homogenized by a pipette tip, and then an appropriate volume of 5× electrophoresis sample buffer was added. Whole oocytes and cytoplasms were homogenized in glass/Teflon homogenizers in the same buffer, centrifuged at 300 × g to remove yolk platelets, and brought to the concentration of electrophoresis sample buffer as above. Stage 35 embryos were washed in 0.1 Barth solution and homogenized in the same solution as the oocytes, and then the sample was prepared for SDS-PAGE as above. Polysome Preparation and Analysis—Stage 35 embryos (30 individuals) were washed several times in sterile 0.1× Barth solution and homogenized in 1 ml of TKM buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm DTT, 50 units/ml RNase inhibitor (Amersham Biosciences), and 100 μg/ml leupeptin. Until homogenization, the temperature was kept at 22 °C to avoid abrupt redistribution of mRNAs between polysomes and mRNPs because of temperature changes and then all of the procedure was carried out in ice. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 10000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant (S10) was collected, and the pellet (P10) was resuspended in 1 ml of homogenization buffer plus RNase inhibitor. Corresponding amounts of S10 and P10 were loaded on 15–50% sucrose gradients in TNaM buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2) and centrifuged for 2 h in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 37,000 rpm at 4 °C to separate polysomes from mRNP particles. Sodium was substituted for potassium in the gradient buffer solution to avoid SDS precipitation during RNA extraction. Gradients were automatically collected, monitoring the optical density at 260 nm, and the fractions were kept in ice. An aliquot of each fraction was precipitated with 1 volume of isopropylic alcohol in the presence of carrier RNA at 3 μg/ml. In scaled up experiments, 1 ml of the P10 fraction was loaded for further purification on sucrose steps in TNaM (1 ml of 19% sucrose on top of 1 ml of 27% sucrose) and centrifuged in polycarbonate tubes in a 65 Ti Beckman rotor at 100,000 × g for1hto pellet polysomes and clean them of contaminating S10 fraction. Sucrose steps were carefully removed in the cold, each pellet (P100) was kept in ice and resuspended in 200 μl of TNaM, 0.5 mm DTT, 50 units/ml RNase inhibitor, and 100 μg/ml leupeptin, and centrifuged at 300 × g for 2 min to remove debris and used for further analysis. All of the manipulations for preparing and analyzing polysomes were carried out in the cold room. EDTA, Micrococcal Nuclease, and High Salt Treatment—For EDTA experiments, six P100 pellets (30 embryos each) were pooled and divided in two parts. One was used as control, the other was made as 30 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and both were incubated for 15 min in ice. The samples then were loaded on 15–30% sucrose gradients in TNaM buffer, the first containing 10 mm MgCl2 and the second containing 10 mm EDTA instead of magnesium. Gradients were centrifuged at 37,000 rpm for 4.5 h at 4 °C to pellet polysomes and separate ribosomal subunits. Gradient fractions of 1 ml were collected while the optical density profile at 260 nm was monitored. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of gradient buffer, and then one-tenth of pellet and one-tenth of gradient fractions were precipitated with 1 volume of isopropylic alcohol in the presence of carrier RNA at 3 μg/ml to be processed for RNA analysis. The remaining part of each fraction was precipitated for protein analysis with 6 volumes of ethanol/acetone/methanol (2:1:1) at –20° in the presence of 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. For nuclease digestion experiments, six P100 pellets were dissolved as indicated above, brought to a final volume of 2 ml with the same buffer, and divided into two parts. One was used as control, and the other was treated with micrococcal nuclease (Amersham Biosciences) at 0.02 units/μl for 20 min in ice in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2. The reaction then was stopped by the addition of EGTA at 3 mm final concentration. Samples were loaded on top of 1 ml of 19% sucrose step in TNaM and centrifuged at 170,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatants and steps were collected, and the pellets were dissolved in 1 ml of TNaM buffer. One-tenth of each fraction was precipitated for RNA analysis, and the remainder was precipitated for protein analysis as described above. Of the protein samples, one-tenth was used for Coomassie Blue staining and the rest was used for Western blot. For high salt treatment, six P100 pellets were dissolved as above for treatment with 0.5 m KCl. Control and treated samples were incubated for 30 min in ice with gentle stirring, and then they were centrifuged and processed as in the micrococcal nuclease experiment with the exception that the supernatants were dialyzed before precipitation for 1 h versus 100 volumes of TNaM plus 0.5 mm DTT and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Immunoprecipitation and RT-PCR Analysis—Polysome pellets (P100) from stage 35 Xenopus embryos were dissolved in TNN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing 650 units/ml RNase inhibitor, 100 μg/ml tRNA, and 200 μg/ml leupeptin and incubated with 30 mm EDTA for 5 min in ice to dissociate ribosomal subunits. Following EDTA treatment, the sample was diluted to 20 mm EDTA and incubated four times for 20 min each at 4 °C rotating with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) to preclear the extract. After preclearing, the sample was divided into four parts. Two were kept as samples before precipitation, and the other two were incubated, respectively, with 3 μg of preimmune IgGs or with affinity-purified anti-La antibodies previously bound to protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed 5 times with TNN-300 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40). The RNAs coimmunoprecipitated with the antibody-antigen complex were eluted by incubating the beads with proteinase K buffer at 55 °C for 30 min (42Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar), extracted with phenol-chloroform, and precipitated with 0.3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and 2.5 volumes of cold ethanol in the presence of 2 μg/ml glycogen (Roche Applied Science) as carrier. Similarly, the RNA from the two non-immunoprecipitated samples was extracted. RNAs were then analyzed by RT-PCR using primers specific for the following mRNAs: rp-L4, (sense) 5′-AGTGAGCAAACTTGCTGGTC-3′, (antisense) 5′-ACATACGTCCACCACGACAC-3′ (43Loreni F. Ruberti I. Bozzoni I. Pierandrei-Amaldi P. Amaldi F. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3483-3488Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); rp-S1, (sense) 5′-TGGTTTCCCTGAAGGAAGTG-3′, (antisense) 5′-ATGATGAAACGGAGGACACC-3′ (44Pellizzoni L. Crosio C. Pierandrei-Amaldi P. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 154: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar); eEF1-α, (sense) 5′-ATGCACCATGAAGCCCTTAC-3′, (antisense) 5′-GGCATATCCAGCACCAATCT-3′ (45Krieg P.A. Varnum S.M. Wormington W.M. Melton D.A. Dev. Biol. 1989; 133: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar); β-actin, (sense) 5′-GGACTTTGAGCAGGAGATGG-3′, (antisense) 5′-CAAGGAAAGATGGCTGGAAG-3′ (GenBank™ accession number AF079161); and CNBP, (sense) 5′-TTGTGATCTGCAGGAGGATG-3′, (antisense) 5′-TTCTGTTCATCAGCGTGCTC-3′ (47De Dominicis A. Lotti F. Pierandrei-Amaldi P. Cardinali B. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 241: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The amplified products were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization using as probes the following specific oligonucleotides corresponding to an internal region of each amplified product labeled at the 5′ end with [γ-32P]dATP: rp-L4, 5′-CCAAACAAGTGCTGAATCGTGGGGA-3′; rp-S1, 5′-GTCTGGCTGTGAGGAGAGCTTGCT-3′; eEF1-α, 5′-AGATTGACCCACCAATGGAAGCTGG-3′; β-actin, 5′-GAGCTATGAGCTGCCTGACGGACAA-3′; and CNBP, 5′-ATTGCCAAGGACTGTAAGGAGCCCAG-3′. Filters were hybridized at 37 °C in 50% formamide overnight and washed at 42 °C in 2× SSC and 0.5% SDS for 1 h and then exposed to 3MM films for autoradiography. Densitometric analysis of the films was carried out by ImageQuant 1.1 software. To identify the linear range of amplification, the RNA from each sample was subjected to a semiquantitative RT-PCR for 20, 25, 30, and 35 cycles using primers specific for the different TOP mRNAs. Following Southern hybridization, the signals obtained for each RNA were quantified. In all of the cases, the 25-cycle reaction proved to be within the linear range of amplification and this condition was used for the experiments. RNA Preparation and Analysis—Precipitates from gradient fractions were pooled as indicated and subjected to RNA extraction with the proteinase K/SDS/phenol-chloroform-isoamylic alcohol procedure and precipitated with absolute ethanol. The precipitates were resuspended, loaded on 0.8% denaturing agarose gel, and analyzed by Northern blot with probes obtained by the random primer method in the presence of 50 μCi of [α-32P]dATP. Hybridization and washing conditions were performed according to standard procedures. Filters were exposed to 3MM films for autoradiography. Protein Analysis—Protein precipitated from gradient fractions were analyzed on 12% acrylamide gels, blotted on nitrocellulose paper (Schleicher & Schuell), and then analyzed by Western blot with rabbit antisera versus Xenopus recombinant La (34Pellizzoni L. Cardinali B. Lin-Marq N. Mercanti D. Pierandrei-Amaldi P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), Xenopus CNBP fragment 159–178 (47De Dominicis A. Lotti F. Pierandrei-Amaldi P. Cardinali B. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 241: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and Xenopus nucleoplasmin monoclonal antibodies (48Wedlich D. Dreyer C. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 254: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) according to Pellizzoni et al. (34Pellizzoni L. Cardinali B. Lin-Marq N. Mercanti D. Pierandrei-Amaldi P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Western blots were revealed with the ECL kit (Pierce). When necessary, quantitation of band intensity was determined with the ImageQuant program. Evaluation of Cytoplasmic La in Xenopus Cells—Since we were interested in a cytoplasmic function of La, we wanted first to have an idea of the amount of La in the cytoplasm and determine whether this was sufficient for binding TOP mRNAs. Experimental determination of La in the cytoplasm has been impaired by the diffusion of La from the nuclei and nuclear breakage during conventional extract preparations from cells (10Wolin S.L. Cedervall T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 375-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). For this reason here we took advantage of the oocyte system, which allows a clean separation of the two-cell compartments. Single defolliculated stage V-VI oocytes were manually enucleated under the microscope and immediately collected in separate dishes. Nuclei, cytoplasms, and whole oocyte extracts were prepared as indicated under “Experimental Procedures” and analyzed by Western blot. The nucleus/cytoplasm separation was checked by reacting the same filter with La antibodies and with antibodies against the abundant nucleoplasmin as a nuclear marker (48Wedlich D. Dreyer C. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 254: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and CNBP as a cytoplasmic marker (49Warden C.H. Krisans S.K. Purcell-Huynh D. Leete L.M. Daluiski A. Diep A. Taylor B.A. Lusis A.J. Genomics. 1994; 24: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) as shown in Fig. 1A. To quantitate the relative amount of La in the compartments, we loaded on the gel the cytoplasmic extract equivalent to 1 oocyte and the nuclear extract equivalent to one-tenth and one-twentieth of one oocyte. Fig. 1B shows, as an example, the results obtained in one of the three experiments performed. The amount of La protein found in a total oocyte extract corresponds to that present in the equivalent amount of nuclear plus cytoplasmic extract (Fig. 1B, lanes 1, 3, and 4), confirming that most of the protein is localized in the nucleus. Quantitation analysis of band intensity of La from nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts of this (Fig. 1B, lanes 2, 3, and 4) and other similar experiments indicated that cytoplasmic La is approximately 2–4% of nuclear La. This value is compatible with data obtained by immunoprecipitation of oocyte nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts (19Simons F.H. Broers F.J. Van Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 224: 224-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although very appropriate to determine the relative amount of La in the cell cytoplasm, the oocyte is not as convenient for our polysome studies as the somatic cells of stage 35 embryos where TOP mRNAs translation is significantly more active than in oocy"
https://openalex.org/W1977997233,"Heparanase is an endo-glucuronidase expressed in a variety of tissues and cells that selectively cleaves extracellular and cell-surface heparan sulfate. Here we propose that this enzyme is involved also in the processing of serglycin heparin proteoglycan in mouse mast cells. In this process, newly synthesized heparin chains (60–100 kDa) are degraded to fragments (10–20 kDa) similar in size to commercially available heparin (Jacobsson, K. G., and Lindahl, U. (1987) Biochem. J. 246, 409–415). A fraction of these fragments contains the specific pentasaccharide sequence required for high affinity binding to antithrombin implicated with anticoagulant activity. Rat skin heparin, which escapes processing in vivo, was used as a substrate in reaction with recombinant human heparanase. An incubation product of commercial heparin size retained the specific pentasaccharide sequence, although oligosaccharides (3–4 kDa) containing this sequence could be degraded by the same enzyme. Commercial heparin was found to be a powerful inhibitor (I50 ∼20 nm expressed as disaccharide unit, ∼0.7 nm polysaccharide) of heparanase action toward antithrombin-binding oligosaccharides. Cells derived from a serglycin-processing mouse mastocytoma expressed a protein highly similar to other mammalian heparanases. These findings strongly suggest that the intracellular processing of the heparin proteoglycan polysaccharide chains is catalyzed by heparanase, which primarily cleaves target structures distinct from the antithrombin-binding sequence. Heparanase is an endo-glucuronidase expressed in a variety of tissues and cells that selectively cleaves extracellular and cell-surface heparan sulfate. Here we propose that this enzyme is involved also in the processing of serglycin heparin proteoglycan in mouse mast cells. In this process, newly synthesized heparin chains (60–100 kDa) are degraded to fragments (10–20 kDa) similar in size to commercially available heparin (Jacobsson, K. G., and Lindahl, U.

A fraction of these fragments contains the specific pentasaccharide sequence required for high affinity binding to antithrombin implicated with anticoagulant activity. Rat skin heparin, which escapes processing in vivo, was used as a substrate in reaction with recombinant human heparanase. An incubation product of commercial heparin size retained the specific pentasaccharide sequence, although oligosaccharides (3–4 kDa) containing this sequence could be degraded by the same enzyme. Commercial heparin was found to be a powerful inhibitor (I50 ∼20 nm expressed as disaccharide unit, ∼0.7 nm polysaccharide) of heparanase action toward antithrombin-binding oligosaccharides. Cells derived from a serglycin-processing mouse mastocytoma expressed a protein highly similar to other mammalian heparanases. These findings strongly suggest that the intracellular processing of the heparin proteoglycan polysaccharide chains is catalyzed by heparanase, which primarily cleaves target structures distinct from the antithrombin-binding sequence. Heparin is a linear polysaccharide synthesized by connective tissue-type mast cells as part of a unique proteoglycan, serglycin. The heparin chains, similar to other glycosaminoglycans, are composed of repeating hexuronic acid (HexUA) 1The abbreviations used are: HexUA, hexuronic acid; AT, antithrombin; HA, high affinity for AT; GlcN, d-glucosamine; GlcUA, d-glucuronic acid; HS, heparan sulfate; IdoUA, l-iduronic acid; LA, low affinity for AT; M-heparin, macromolecular heparin chain; P-heparin, heparanase cleavage products of M-heparin; PAPS, adenosine 3′-phosphate, 5′-phosphosulfate.1The abbreviations used are: HexUA, hexuronic acid; AT, antithrombin; HA, high affinity for AT; GlcN, d-glucosamine; GlcUA, d-glucuronic acid; HS, heparan sulfate; IdoUA, l-iduronic acid; LA, low affinity for AT; M-heparin, macromolecular heparin chain; P-heparin, heparanase cleavage products of M-heparin; PAPS, adenosine 3′-phosphate, 5′-phosphosulfate. and d-glucosamine (GlcN) units that are sulfated at various positions. Heparin is structurally related to heparan sulfate (HS), which is expressed by most mammalian cells but has lower N- and O-sulfate contents. More than half of the HexUA in heparin is l-iduronic acid (IdoUA), whereas generally HexUA in HS is largely d-glucuronic acid (GlcUA) (1Casu B. Lindahl U. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 2001; 57: 159-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The well known blood anticoagulant activity of heparin depends on the occurrence of a specific pentasaccharide sequence in the polysaccharide, which is capable of interacting with the proteinase inhibitor antithrombin (AT) (2Björk I. Lindahl U. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 48: 161-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Although heparin has been used as an anticoagulant in the clinic for a long time, the physiological function of heparin remains unclear. Recent studies suggest an essential role for heparin in the storage and activation of specific proteases in mast cell granules (3Forsberg E. Pejler G. Ringvall M. Lunderius C. Tomasini-Johansson B.

Heparin chains (“macromolecular heparin,” hereon referred to as M-heparin) bound to serglycin-type core peptide can be isolated from rat skin (6Robinson H.C. Horner A.A. Höök M. Ögren S. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6687-6693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or rat peritoneal mast cells (7Yurt R.W. Leid R.W. Austen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 518-521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and range in size from 60 to 100 kDa. By contrast, heparin (“commercial heparin”) recovered from other animal tissues such as pig intestinal mucosa or bovine lung is much smaller (5–20 kDa). The majority of such molecules lack covalently bound peptide, and it is generally assumed that they are generated through a common processing mechanism. Fragmentation of newly synthesized macromolecular heparin was demonstrated in cultured mast cells along with the transfer of the processed products (P-heparin) to intracellular granules (8Jacobsson K.G. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The degradation products were similar in size to commercial heparin. An endo-β-d-glucuronidase capable of degrading M-heparin (6Robinson H.C. Horner A.A. Höök M. Ögren S. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6687-6693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ögren S. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2690-2697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was tentatively implicated in the process. Subsequently, endo-glucuronidase (“heparanase”) activity associated with cleavage of HS chains was demonstrated in a variety of normal and malignant cells (10Oldberg Å. Heldin C.-H. Wasteson Å.

J. 2002; 364: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) claiming the occurrence of several distinct heparanases based on biochemical studies). Early studies with platelet heparanase showed that this enzyme could cleave the glucuronidic linkage in oligosaccharides containing the AT-binding sequence of heparin, such that the cleavage products lacked affinity for AT and hence were devoid of anticoagulant activity (21Thunberg L. Bäckström G. Wasteson Å. Robinson H.C. Ögren S. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10278-10282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the endo-glucuronidase-catalyzed cleavage of M-heparin in mast cells generates P-heparin-type products that retain the AT-binding sequence, the platelet heparanase was assumed to differ from the mast cell endo-glucuronidase. This assumption was supported by the apparent lack of effect of the mast cell enzyme on AT-binding oligosaccharide and by a preliminary comparison of substrate recognition properties of the platelet and mast cell enzymes using microsomal intermediates in heparin biosynthesis as substrates (21Thunberg L. Bäckström G. Wasteson Å. Robinson H.C. Ögren S. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10278-10282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heparanase-mediated cleavage of HS yields fragments of variable size, only a limited proportion of glucuronidic linkages in HS chains being susceptible to degradation. Attempts to define the substrate specificity of heparanase pointed to the importance of sulfation but have otherwise failed to provide a unified picture (22Pikas D.S. Li J.-P. Vlodavsky I. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18770-18777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 23Podyma-Inoue K.A. Yokote H. Sakaguchi K. Ikuta M. Yanagishita M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42488-42495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to identify the mast cell enzyme responsible for the intracellular processing of M-heparin, i.e. the polysaccharide chain constituents of the serglycin proteoglycan. An analysis of mRNA in cultured mastocytoma cells and subsequent cloning of cDNA revealed expression of a homologue of the heparanase found in other tissues. Recombinant heparanase was found to catalyze the two cleavage reactions previously ascribed to separate enzymes (21Thunberg L. Bäckström G. Wasteson Å. Robinson H.C. Ögren S. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10278-10282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), i.e. one converting M-heparin to P-heparin, the other resulting in cleavage of the AT-binding sequence. Due to the relative resistance of this sequence to heparanase, the overall process is evolved to favor generation of P-heparin with retained AT-binding domain. Materials—Columns for gel chromatography, Superose 12™, Superose 6, and Sephadex-30 were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Chemical reagents and equipment were as described in the appropriate sections below. Human Recombinant Heparanase—Human heparanase was cloned and overexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells as reported previously (16Vlodavsky I. Friedmann Y. Elkin M. Aingorn H. Atzmon R. Ishai-Michaeli R. Bitan M. Pappo O. Peretz T. Michal I. Spector L. Pecker I. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). The recombinant enzyme, purified from cell extracts by Mono-S HR 5/5 cation exchange chromatography followed by heparin- and ConA-Sepharose chromatographies, was kindly provided by In-Sight Ltd. (Rabin Science Park, Rehovot, Israel). Polysaccharide Substrates—Rat skin heparin (2.5 mg), prepared as described previously (25Horner A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 231-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was incubated in 0.3 ml of 0.5 m NaOH on ice overnight. The sample was neutralized with HCl and subsequently desalted on a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting free M-heparin chains were radiolabeled by reduction with 1 mCi of NaB3H4 (55 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) in 0.1 ml of 0.1 m NaOH. Following acidification of the reaction mixtures with 4 m acetic acid, samples were neutralized with 4 m NaOH and 3H-labeled M-heparin (∼360 × 103 dpm/μg HexUA) was recovered by gel chromatography on a column (1 × 100 cm) of Sephadex G-50 equilibrated with 0.2 m NaHCO3. Porcine intestinal heparin was N-[3H]acetyl-labeled by partial N-deacetylation followed by N-[3H]acetylation essentially as described previously (26Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) with the exception that the hydrazinolysis reaction time was extended to 2 h. The product had a specific activity of ∼84 × 103 dpm/μg HexUA. Affinity fractionation of labeled saccharides on immobilized AT was done essentially as described previously (27Thunberg L. Bäckström G. Lindahl U. Carbohydr. Res. 1982; 100: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The sample was applied to a 3-ml column of AT-Sepharose and eluted in stepwise fashion with NaCl of different concentrations (see “Results”) in 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed for radioactivity. Components emerging at <0.5 m NaCl were designated low affinity (LA) heparin, whereas fractions retained on AT-Sepharose at 0.8 m NaCl and eluted with 2.0 m NaCl were considered high affinity (HA) heparin. Oligosaccharide Substrates—Radiolabeled heparin oligosaccharides with high affinity for AT were prepared essentially as described previously (27Thunberg L. Bäckström G. Lindahl U. Carbohydr. Res. 1982; 100: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Heparin was subjected to partial deaminative cleavage with nitrous acid, and the products were reduced with NaB3H4. Labeled oligosaccharides of different molecular size were isolated by gel chromatography (Sephadex G-50) and further separated by affinity chromatography on immobilized AT-Sepharose. Two HA preparations were recovered, one (10–12-mer) with a specific activity of ∼1 × 106 dpm/μg HexUA, the other (12–14-mer) with a specific activity of ∼116 × 103 dpm/μg HexUA. Labeled 8-mers were obtained through a “biosynthetic library” strategy recently described for the generation of heparin-related oligosaccharides (28Jemth P. Kreuger J. Kusche-Gullberg M. Sturiale L.

Chem. 2002; 277: 30567-30573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) using capsular polysaccharide from Escherichia coli K5 as starting material. This polymer has the same structure, [4GlcAβ1,4GlcNAcα1] n , as the precursor polysaccharide in heparin/HS biosynthesis (1Casu B. Lindahl U. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 2001; 57: 159-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and is recognized as a substrate for the biosynthetic enzymes (29Kusche M. Hannesson H.H. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) following chemical N-deacetylation and N-sulfation (30Casu B. Grazioli G. Razi N. Guerrini M. Naggi A. Torri G. Oreste P. Tursi F. Zoppetti G. Lindahl U. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 263: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). N-Sulfated K5 polysaccharide was incubated with mouse mastocytoma microsomal enzymes (including GlcUA C5-epimerase and various O-sulfotransferases) in the presence of PAPS under the conditions described previously (28Jemth P. Kreuger J. Kusche-Gullberg M. Sturiale L. Giménez-Gallego G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30567-30573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The resulting modified product was re-isolated and partially cleaved by treatment with nitrous acid. 3H-Labeled oligosaccharides obtained by reduction with NaB3H4 were separated by gel chromatography, and an 8-mer fraction was recovered. The 8-mers were subjected to repeated incubation with enzymes, and PAPS and were finally re-isolated and desalted. Cloning of Mouse Mastocytoma Heparanase—Cultured murine mastocytoma cells (31Jacobsson K.G. Riesenfeld J. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12154-12159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contained >90% mast cells enriched through repeated subculturing (data not shown) and retained the ability to synthesize and process M-heparin as described previously (8Jacobsson K.G. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's description. The cDNA was prepared with First Stranded cDNA synthesis kit for reverse transferase-PCR (Roche Applied Science) and used as a template for PCR cloning of heparanase. PCR primers were designed based on the cDNA sequences of rat and human heparanase. Analysis of Heparanase Activity—Standard incubations of heparanase using radiolabeled saccharide as substrates (∼0.2–6 μm disaccharide unit) and ∼15 ng of protein (∼2.3 nm enzyme) in 100 μl of 20 mm phosphate-citrate buffer, 1 mm CaCl2, 50 mm NaCl, pH 5.4, were used. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Deviations from the standard conditions are defined under “Results” and the legends to figures. After incubation, samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and centrifuged. Supernatants were analyzed by gel chromatography or affinity chromatography. Analytical Procedures—HexUA was determined by the meta-hydroxydiphenyl method (32Blumenkrantz N. Asboe-Hansen G. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (5784) Google Scholar). Concentrations of radiolabeled saccharide preparations were assessed from determinations of specific radioactivity. Molar concentrations of oligosaccharides were calculated based on the number of disaccharide units. Molar concentrations of polysaccharides were obtained from estimated average M r, assuming a disaccharide unit M r of 600. Analytical affinity chromatography on AT-Sepharose was similar to the preparative procedure described above with the exception that the column volume was 0.5 ml and effluent fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. For gel chromatography, columns of Superose 12, Superose 6, and Sephadex-30 were operated according to the manufacturer's instruction in a buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 m NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100. Samples of ∼10 × 103 dpm were generally applied. Anion-exchange high pressure liquid chromatography of oligosaccharides was performed using a ProPac PA1 column (Dionex) equilibrated in NaCl solution, which was adjusted to pH 3 by the addition of HCl. The column effluent was analyzed by on-line scintillation counting. Sequence analysis of N-sulfated oligosaccharides was performed according to the combined chemical/enzymatic degradation scheme described previously (28Jemth P. Kreuger J. Kusche-Gullberg M. Sturiale L. Giménez-Gallego G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30567-30573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 33Kreuger J. Salmivirta M. Sturiale L.

High voltage paper electrophoresis was carried out as described previously (9Ögren S. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2690-2697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using pyridine-acetate buffer, pH 5.3, and Whatman 3MM paper. Gulono-γ-lactone (25 μg) applied in 25 μl of 0.25 m NH4OH (to hydrolyze the lactone to free acid) was used as a standard. Labeled samples were treated in similar fashion. After electrophoresis, the standard was detected by a silver dip procedure (34Smith I. Smith I. Chromatographic and Electrophoretic Techniques. Interscience Publishers, New York1960: 252Google Scholar). Paper strips containing radiolabeled samples were cut into 1-cm pieces that were extracted with water and analyzed by scintillation counting. Digestion of oligosaccharides with exo-β-glucuronidase from bovine liver was performed as described previously (27Thunberg L. Bäckström G. Lindahl U. Carbohydr. Res. 1982; 100: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Deaminative cleavage of heparin-related saccharides at the sites of N-sulfated GlcN residues was achieved by treatment with nitrous acid at pH 1.5 as described previously (35Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Heparanase Cleaves M-heparin to P-heparin—M-heparin was released from the serglycin proteoglycan by alkaline β-elimination and then radiolabeled by reduction with NaB3H4. The product was incubated with heparanase under standard conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”). An analysis of the digest by gel chromatography revealed a single peak with an overall elution pattern similar to that of commercial heparin (peak position indicating ∼15 kDa) (Fig. 1A), and this component remained unaffected through repeated incubation with additional enzyme (Fig. 1A). Affinity chromatography analysis of this product showed no AT-binding-labeled material (data not shown), indicating lack of any AT-binding region between the linkage region to core protein and the site of the first heparanase attack along the M-heparin chain (see Fig. 6). Because the radiolabel was located exclusively at the reducing end of the intact M-heparin chain, these results will reflect only the properties of the fragment released by heparanase from the reducing terminal portion of the chain. To analyze the total cleavage products, the labeled M-heparin was fractionated by affinity chromatography on AT-Sepharose and samples of (end group-labeled) HA- and LA-M-heparin were incubated with heparanase under standard conditions. The digestion products were reduced with NaB3H4 using the same batch of borotritide as employed in the initial labeling of the M-heparin chains. The yield of labeled digestion products was 4–5-fold higher than the amount of starting material, thus indicating the approximate number of cleavage points along the chain. The cleavage product of HA-M-heparin has a similar molecular size as commercial heparin, whereas that of LA-M-heparin was of somewhat smaller average molecular size than commercial heparin (Fig. 1B). Incubation of these fragments with heparanase again did not result in any further decrease in size (data not shown), suggesting end-point degradation under the conditions used.Fig. 6Proposed mode of heparanase action on M-heparin. Heparanase cleaves M-heparin at multiple yet restricted number of sites (arrows in A). The resultant P-heparin fragments may contain (HA-P) or lack (LA-P) the AT-binding sequence (indicated by block structures). GGX, the galactosyl-galactosyl-xylosyl trisaccharide linkage region connecting the M-heparin chain to the serglycin core protein. The AT-binding regions contain a potential cleavage site (arrowheads) that escapes attack by the heparanase during processing of the M-heparin chain. The detailed structure of the AT-binding region (B) shows the glucuronidic linkage cleaved on incubation of AT-binding oligosaccharides with heparanase. R = -H or -SO3–. For additional information see under “Results.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The AT-binding Regions of M-heparin Escape Degradation by Heparanase—The relabeled fragments isolated from the heparanase digest of M-HA-heparin were fractionated by affinity chromatography on AT-Sepharose. Approximately 40% of the products showed high affinity for AT (Fig. 2A), thereby indicating the proportion of heparanase-generated fragments containing the AT-binding sequence. These relations point to an average of 2–3 AT-binding sites in each chain of M-HA-heparin from rat skin. The labeled HA products obtained after heparanase digestion were similar in size to commercial heparin, whereas the LA fragments were somewhat smaller (Fig. 2B). Reincubation of this HA fraction with heparanase had no effect on its affinity for AT (Fig. 2C) nor on its molecular size (Fig. 2D). Notably, the AT-binding sites in rat skin heparin were previously found to contain the critical -GlcUA-Glc-NSO3(3,6-di-OSO3)-sequence (36Horner A.A. Kusche M. Lindahl U. Peterson C.B. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) present also in HA-oligosaccharides derived from commercial heparin. Such oligosaccharides were cleaved upon incubation with heparanase (21Thunberg L. Bäckström G. Wasteson Å. Robinson H.C. Ögren S. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10278-10282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Pikas D.S. Li J.-P. Vlodavsky I. Lindahl U. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42488-42495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In accord with these findings, N-[3H]acetyl-labeled commercial heparin was largely unaffected by incubation with heparanase (data not shown). Repeated incubation with additional 15 ng of enzyme again had no apparent effect, whereas incubation with 5-fold increased amount (75 ng, 11.5 nm) of heparanase resulted in a limited degradation of the polysaccharide (data not shown). Heparin Efficiently Inhibits Cleavage of HA-Oligosaccharides by Heparanase—Previous work indicated that small heparin-derived oligosaccharides containing the AT-binding sequence can be cleaved by digestion with heparanase (21Thunberg L. Bäckström G. Wasteson Å. Robinson H.C. Ögren S. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10278-10282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Pikas D.S. Li J.-P. Vlodavsky I. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18770-18777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). This finding was confirmed in the present study, which also showed cleavage of HA-oligosaccharides to be quite inefficient. Repeated incubation of HA 12–14-mer (∼4.5 μm disaccharide unit, ∼0.7 μm oligosaccharide) with 2.3 nm heparanase thus resulted in cleavage of only about half of the substrate molecules as shown by gel chromatography (Fig. 3A). Incubation with a 5-fold increased enzyme amount gave essentially complete degradation of the oligosaccharide (Fig. 3B). Conversely, decreasing the substrate concentration (∼0.5 μm disaccharide unit, ∼0.1 μm oligosaccharide) likewise afforded extensive degradation (Fig. 4, absence of inhibitor). Although these findings suggest inefficient catalysis, they nevertheless stand in contrast to the apparent lack of effect of heparanase on the commercial heparin-sized HA product primarily excised by the enzyme from M-HA-heparin (Fig. 2, C and D). The main difference between the two potential substrates lies in the extended sequence of highly sulfated saccharide that surrounds the AT-binding domain in the full-sized HA-heparin molecule but is lacking in the HA-oligosaccharide preparations. These adjacent structures might inhibit heparanase action as suggested also by previous observations of inhibitory effects of heparin on heparanase (37Bar-Ner M. Eldor A. Wasserman L. Matzner Y.

Indeed, the addition of 1 ng (∼20 nm disaccharide unit, ∼0.7 nm polysaccharide) of heparin to a standard incubation containing 2.3 nm heparanase led to a ∼50% inhibition of the degradation of HA 10–12-mer (∼0.5 μm disaccharide unit, ∼0.1 μm oligosaccharide); with 10 ng (∼200 nm disaccharide unit, ∼7 nm polysaccharide) of added heparin, inhibition was virtually complete (Fig. 4). This remarkably efficient inhibition, I50 ∼0.7 nm heparin, would explain the relative resistance of the AT-binding sequence in HA-heparin to degradation by heparanase. It should be noted that each heparin chain presumably contains multiple inhibitory enzyme-binding sites.Fig. 4Inhibition by heparin of heparanase-catalyzed oligosaccharide cleavage.

https://openalex.org/W2086644092,"We reported previously that stabilized β-amyloid peptide dimers were derived from mutant amyloid precursor protein with a single cysteine in the ectodomain juxtamembrane position. In vivo studies revealed that two forms of SDS-stable Aβ homodimers exist, species ending at Aβ40 and Aβ42. The phenomenon of the transformation of the initially deposited 42-residue β-amyloid peptide into the amyloid fibrils of Alzheimer's disease plaques remains to be explained in physical terms, i.e. energetically and structurally. We therefore performed spectroscopic analyses revealing that engineered dimeric peptides ending at residue 42 displayed a much more pronounced β-structural transition than corresponding monomers. Specifically, the single chemically induced dimerization of Aβ peptides significantly increased the β-sheet content by a factor of 2. The C-terminal residues Ile-41 and Ala-42 of dimeric forms further increased the β-sheet content by roughly one-third. In contrast to Aβ42, the β-sheet content of the α- and γ-secretase-generated p3 fragments did not necessarily correlate with the tendency to form fibrils, although p3/17–42 had a pronounced thread forming character with fibril lengths of up to 2.5 μm. Electron microscopic images show that forms of p3/17–42 generated smaller granular particles than forms ending at residue 40. We discuss these findings in terms of Aβ1–42 dimers representing paranuclei, which self-aggregate into ribbon-like ordered fibrils by elongation. Based on Aβ42 dimer-specific titers of a polyclonal antiserum we propose that the Aβ homodimer represents a nidus for plaque formation and a well defined novel therapeutic target.

In the secretory pathway, APP is cleaved C-terminal from Aβ residue 16, thus precluding the formation of full-length Aβ1–40/42 but generating 3-kDa fragments, termed Aβ17–40/42 or p3/40/42 (3Haass M.

Furthermore, peptides ending at Aβ42, i.e. Aβ1–42 and Aβ17–42, appear to be a major constituent of the diffuse plaques seen initially in AD and Down syndrome, and they have been proposed to serve as a nidus for the aggregation of the more abundant Aβ1–40 peptides (8Jarrett J.T.

The presence of mixtures of Aβ assemblies, ranging from monomers to insoluble amyloid fibrils, has made it difficult to ascribe amyloidogenicity or toxicity principally to one or another Aβ species. Naturally secreted oligomers of Aβ are believed to have a direct role in AD pathology, both because of their short and long term neurotoxic effects and their ability to give rise to fibrillar assemblies characterized by the adopted β-sheet structure (10Pike C.J.

Fibrillar Aβ has been observed to bind to APP residues His-110, Val-112, and Ile-113 belonging to a common β-strand within the cysteine-rich domain of APP (13Van Nostrand W.E. Melchor J.P. Keane D.M.

The N terminus of Aβ was found to influence the kinetics of aggregation, and increased amyloidogenicity was suggested to correlate positively with N-terminal deletions up to Aβ residue 16 (10Pike C.J.

At least three findings indicate the involvement of the carboxyl third, i.e. the Aβ17–40/42 sequence, in the formation of SDS-stable dimers. First, Aβ residues 1–28 do not form SDS-stable dimers by prolonged incubation (16Kuo Y.M. Webster S. Emmerling M.R. De Lima N. Roher A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1406: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Second, a monoclonal antibody recognizing Aβ residues 17–24 detected SDS-stable Aβ dimers from human brain (17Enya M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Yoshimura M. Shinkai Y. Kusui K. Khan K. Games D. Schenk D. Sugihara S. Yamaguchi H. Ihara Y. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 271-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Third, mutant APP with a single cysteine in the ectodomain juxtamembrane position (i.e. Aβ residue 28 changed to cysteine) spontaneously formed APP homodimers leading to a ∼7-fold higher level of Aβ dimers in the cell culture medium (18Scheuermann S. Hambsch B. Hesse L. Stumm J. Schmidt C. Beher D. Bayer T.A. Beyreuther K. Multhaup G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33923-33929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Possibly, this substitution fitted with the predicted amphipathic interface of the APP α-helical juxtamembrane domain and then enabled the increased Aβ production. To study the effect of this specific mutant on the assembly of Aβ into oligomers and fibrils, we have synthesized two series of covalently cross-linked Aβ peptides, one of which terminates at residue 40 and the other at residue 42. Apparent differences in the aggregation profiles have been examined at a fixed time point by circular dichroism (CD) and electron microscopy (EM). The high content of β-sheet structure in the Aβ42 dimer has been confirmed by Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) mass spectrometry, and a conformation-dependent epitope of Aβ dimers has been detected by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). CD Spectroscopy—Alterations in the secondary structure content of the Aβ-derived peptides were monitored by CD spectroscopy. Spectra were taken using a Jasco J-710 instrument with a PFD-350S temperature control device set at a sensitivity of 10 mdeg, a time constant of 4 s, and a scan speed of 5 nm/min. Typically, peptides were diluted to 100 μg/ml in 1 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, with or without 1 mm dithiothreitol and measured in a 1-mm quartz cuvette, scanning from 240 to 190 nm. Protein concentrations for the calculation of mean residue ellipticity (Θmrw) were determined by amino acid analysis of the sample after measurement. Curves are presented as the signal average of four transients with a similarly signal-averaged base line subtracted. A Fourier transform operation was carried out to remove high frequency noise from the signal. Secondary structure content of the peptides was estimated from the far UV CD spectra as mean residue ellipticity using the PEPFIT program (19Reed J. Reed T.A. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 254: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). EM—Each peptide was dissolved to 1 mg/ml in deionized water (Milli Q, Millipore) supplemented with 5 μl of 25% ammonia solution (measured pH 9.8) and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Aliquots (15 μl) of the aged peptide solutions (1 mg/ml) were applied to freshly glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grids (300 mesh size) and negatively stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate. The negative staining preparations for all peptide samples were done in parallel within a time interval of about 10 min after the incubation period. All staining preparations were performed in duplicate. Grids were examined in a Zeiss EM 10A electron microscope (Oberkochem, Germany) at an acceleration rate of 80 kV. The magnification indicator of the microscope was routinely controlled by using a grating replica. FTIR Measurements—The peptide was dissolved in 10 mm phosphate buffer D2O. The pH was adjusted to 8.7 with DCl and NaOH dissolved in D2O. The solution was incubated at 56 °C for 4 h to reach full proton-deuterium exchange. To remove residual protons, the sample was lyophilized twice and dissolved in D2O again. For measurements, a peptide solution of 30 μg μl–1 in a temperature-controlled CaF2 cell with a path length of 15 μm was used. Spectra were recorded using a Phillips PU 9600 FTIR spectrometer whereby instrument optics and sample compartment were flushed with dry nitrogen gas. Buffer spectra recorded under the same conditions were subtracted from the sample spectra. The position of individual IR transitions in the amide I region between 1,700 and 1,600 cm–1 were resolved by second derivative spectra and by self-deconvolution routines. For secondary structure analysis the spectra were fitted using a set of six Lorentzian line shaped transitions. Chemical Synthesis, Purification, and Analysis of Synthetic Peptides—For solid phase synthesis of Aβ-derived peptides the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) strategy (20Merrifield R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2149-2154Crossref Scopus (6575) Google Scholar, 21Carpino L.A. Han G.Y. J. Org. Chem. 1972; 37: 3404-3409Crossref Scopus (1081) Google Scholar) was applied in a fully automated synthesizer (ABI 433). Peptide chain assembly was performed using in situ activation of amino acid building blocks by 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU). The purified material was analyzed by HPLC and laser desorption mass spectrometry (Vision 2000, Finnigan MAT). Purified peptides were lyophilized and stored at –20 °C until use. The peptides to be cross-linked were allowed to form S-S bonds in 20% dimethyl sulfoxide. After a 12-h incubation, the sample was freeze-dried, dissolved in diluted ammonia, and injected onto a Jupiter 5-μm C4 300 Å reversed phase column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The dimeric fraction was collected, and identity was verified with mass spectrometry again. Concentrations of dissolved peptides were determined by amino acid analysis according to the manufacturer's protocol after hydrolysis with 6 n HCl, 0.1% phenol for 24 h at 110 °C (420A Amino Acid Analysis System, Applied Biosystems). Antibodies and Western Blot—The monoclonal antibody W0-2 recognizing the N-terminal region of Aβ has been used as a control (22Ida N. Hartmann T. Pantel J. Schroder J. Zerfass R. Forstl H.

Polyclonal Aβ17–40 K28C dimer antibodies were raised against the synthetic peptide. Unconjugated peptide was used for rabbit immunizations. Immediately prior to immunization peptide solutions were prepared as described for EM, and complete Freund's adjuvant was added to a final concentration of 500 μg/ml. After 4 weeks, subsequent immunizations were given with incomplete Freund's adjuvant three times at 2-week intervals. Blood samples were collected 10 days after each injection and stored at 4 °C until assayed by SPR with immobilized synthetic peptides. Snap-frozen hemispheres of APP23 (23Sturchler-Pierrat C.

Samples were diluted in 2× SDS sample buffer (8% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Coomassie Blue G, 3 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.45), electrophoresed on 16% Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Novex, San Diego), and proteins were transferred to Hybond nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Aβ was detected after heating the membrane in preboiled phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min to enhance the signal and blocking in 10% non-fat dry milk (W0-2) or 20% horse serum (MX-02) containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Signals were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies followed by ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Tissue Preparation and Immunohistochemistry—APP23 mice (23Sturchler-Pierrat C. Abramowski D. Duke M. Wiederhold K.H. Mistl C. Rothacher S. Ledermann B. Burki K. Frey P. Paganetti P.A. Waridel C.

After removal of the brain, one hemisphere was formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded for immunohistochemical analysis, and the other hemisphere was snap-frozen for biochemical analysis. Immersion fixation was carried out using 4% buffered formalin at 4 °C. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 4-μm paraffin sections according to standard protocols. In brief, sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated. After treatment with 1% H2O2 in phosphate-buffered saline to block endogenous peroxidase activity, sections were heated in a microwave oven in 0.01 m citrate buffer, pH 6.0. Pretreatment with 88% formic acid enhanced immunoreactivity. Sections were treated with fetal calf serum prior to the addition of the primary antibodies to block nonspecific binding sites. This was followed by an overnight incubation with the primary antibody at room temperature. Monoclonal primary antibody G2-10 (1:500) against Aβ40 and polyclonal antibody MX-02 (1:500) against Aβ17–40 K28C dimers were incubated overnight in a humid chamber at room temperature. Staining was visualized using the ABC method, with a Vectastain kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame) and diaminobenzidine as chromogen. Real Time SPR Analysis—Real time binding experiments were performed on a BIACORE system equipped with the upgrade kit (BIACORE) (24Simons A. Ruppert T. Schmidt C. Schlicksupp A. Pipkorn R. Reed J. Masters C.L. White A.R. Cappai R. Beyreuther K. Bayer T.A. Multhaup G. Scheuermann S. Strauss M. Kemmling A. Oehler C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9310-9320Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at 37 °C. The instrument was operated with phosphate-buffered saline as eluent (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.005% Surfactant P-20, pH 7.4). SPR buffers and solutions were filtered and degassed before use. The sensor chip surface was derivatized with 300–3,000 response units (RU) of Aβ peptides. For coupling, 1 volume of a 1 mg/ml peptide solution in diluted ammonia was mixed with 9 volumes of 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 3.2, and was injected at 5 μl/min onto the sensor chip surface activated by N-hydroxysuccinimide and 1-ethyl-3-(3-di-methylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. This was followed by the injection of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 9, for 5 min to quench residual N-hydroxysuccinimide groups. We assessed uniform and standardized engineered Aβ1–42, Aβ1–40, Aβ17–42, and Aβ17–40 homodimers and compared their biochemical and biophysical characteristics with corresponding wild-type “monomers” (set into quotations because freshly dissolved synthetic Aβ always yields a certain ratio of monomers, dimers, and trimers (25Roher A.E. Chaney M.O. Kuo Y.M. Webster S.D. Stine W.B. Haverkamp L.J. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Tuohy J.M. Krafft G.A. Bonnell B.S. Emmerling M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20631-20635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar)). The generation of homodimers was achieved by introducing a Cys at position 28. This approach is based on the following assumptions. First, dimerization of Aβ is not only the first but also an essential step for Aβ fibrillization. Second, although it is distinct from the Aβ dimer in vivo, the K28C substitution is nearly authentic Aβ because this mutation was selected for an enhanced production of Aβ dimers from APP695 K624C-transfected SHSY5Y cells (18Scheuermann S. Hambsch B. Hesse L. Stumm J. Schmidt C. Beher D. Bayer T.A. Beyreuther K. Multhaup G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33923-33929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Secondary structures of Aβ peptides generated by substituting Lys-28 to Cys-28, oxidation, and subsequent purification by HPLC were analyzed together with wild-type peptides by CD spectroscopy and confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy for the Aβ1–42 K28C mutant (Fig. 1). Most strikingly, wild-type and mutant peptides ending at residue 42 displayed an even more pronounced β-structural transition than forms ending at residue 40 (Fig. 1, A versus B). Compared with Aβ1–42 it is apparent that the absence of the C-terminal two amino acids in Aβ1–40 leads to a marked increase in the negative maximum at ∼198 nm (Fig. 1, A and B, blue curves). Deconvolution of CD spectra indicates a β-sheet content of 48%, a content of unstructured coil of 22%, and negligible amounts of α-helix for the Aβ1–42 K28C dimer (Fig. 1A, red curve), for the Aβ1–42 “monomer” (Fig. 1A, blue curve) 23% β-sheet, and 52% random and 18% β-sheet and 70% random for the Aβ1–40 “monomer” (Fig. 1B, blue curve). Dimeric Aβ1–40 K28C (35% β-sheet, 55% unstructured coil) was even superior to “monomeric” Aβ1–42 (23% β-sheet, 52% unstructured coil; Fig. 1B, red curve, versus A, blue curve). To summarize, Aβ K28C dimerization significantly increased the β-sheet content by a factor of 2 for both the 40 and 42 series. To determine the role of Cys-28 in maintaining the conformation, time course CD studies performed under reducing conditions with the Aβ1–42 K28C dimer revealed that its predominant β-sheet structure was unchanged even in the presence of a 50-fold molar excess of dithiothreitol. CD spectra collected within 30 s of mixing were superimposable on spectra at 24 h and the control (Fig. 1C). The reduction of disulfide bonds was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (data not shown). This indicates that treatment of Aβ K28C dimers with dithiothreitol per se was not sufficient for changing the conformation adopted after initial dimerization. To analyze more accurately the high content of β-sheets in the Aβ1–42 K28C dimer, FTIR spectroscopy was applied (Fig. 1D). The overall spectrum of the Aβ1–42 K28C dimer with an absorption maximum for the amide I band at 1,625 cm–1 is typically observed for structures with mainly β-sheet content (26Siebert F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 501-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Analysis of the spectra using a set of 6 Lorentzian line shaped IR transitions revealed a content of 64% β-sheet, 21% random coil, 9% turns, and 6% α-helix. This interpretation is slightly different from the CD spectrum (48% β-sheet, 22% random coil, 30% turns, and 0% α-helix). This inconsistency in regard to absent α-helical frequencies measured by CD spectroscopy is most likely because of the different methodology and has been observed before in other examples of nonhelical protein conformations analyzed by FTIR (26Siebert F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 501-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Amyloid β-peptides 17–40 and 17–42 derived by α- and γ-secretase cleavage of APP are major constituents of diffuse plaques with a fibrillar morphology observed by transmission electron microscopy (10Pike C.J. Overman M.J. Cotman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23895-23898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 27Naslund J. Jensen M. Tjernberg L.O. Thyberg J. Terenius L. Nordstedt C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and were reported to induce neuronal apoptosis (28Wei W. Norton D.D. Wang X. Kusiak J.W. Brain. 2002; 125: 2036-2043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we also analyzed K28C substituted Aβ17–40 and Aβ17–42 by CD. The CD spectra revealed 40% β-sheet for the Aβ17–42 K28C dimer (Fig. 1E) and 28% β-sheet for the Aβ17–40 K28C dimer (Fig. 1F). Most interestingly, the lack of the N-terminal 16 amino acids reduced the β-sheet content by roughly a fifth for Aβ17–42 and Aβ17–40 “monomers” (Fig. 1, blue curves in E and F) compared with full-length peptides. Furthermore, for both the truncated and the full-length forms, the absence of the C-terminal amino acids Ile-Ala had little effect on the secondary structure of the “monomeric” forms but reduced the β-sheet content by roughly one-third for the corresponding K28C dimers (Fig. 1, A and B, E and F, red curves). To compare the amyloidogenic nature of K28C dimeric peptides relative to wild-type Aβ, EM images of mutant and wild-type Aβ1–42/40 and Aβ17–40/42 peptides from freshly dissolved and 24-h aged solutions were generated under identical conditions. Analyses revealed a contrasting morphology for “monomeric” and K28C dimeric fractions. The regulated dimerization of Aβ1–42 K28C improved the characteristic amyloid fibril morphology and underlined the importance of C-terminal amino acids Ile-Ala for fibril formation. Aβ1–42 K28C generated ribbon-like filaments with a smooth contour measuring a 10–40-nm and 5–10-μm length (Fig. 2A). This appearance strongly contrasted with mature fibrils of Aβ1–42 “monomers” (Fig. 2B). Studies on Aβ42 “monomers” and K28C dimers revealed that the Aβ fibril morphology was affected dramatically in the Aβ1–42 K28C dimer. For the wild-type Aβ1–42 the incubation time of 24 h led to the formation of beaded protofibrils with 5–13 nm average diameter and 0.15–1.5 μm length (Fig. 2B), analogous to protofibril dimensions reported previously (29Harper J.D. Lieber C.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 951-959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 30Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8972-8980Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 31Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). A second type of fibrils was of longer filaments of up to 3.5 μm (Fig. 2B). Aβ1–40 K28C dimers (Fig. 2C) and “monomers” (Fig. 2D) showed protofilaments of individual, curvilinear structures of 13–24-nm diameter and <100-nm length for Aβ1–40 “monomers” (Fig. 2D) or 16–20-nm diameter and a protofibril extension up to 600 nm for Aβ1–40 K28C dimers (Fig. 2C). This might be explained by a faster growth process of Aβ1–40 K28C dimers, which might have occurred by starting with dimers. Thus, three significant differences of dimer fibrils were observed. First, the estimated diameter and the length of the Aβ1–42 K28C was three times enlarged compared with the wild-type. Second, the fibrils did not appear beaded but straight. Third, the proportion of protofibrils was much lower, suggesting that the assembly/maturation was much faster or was an irreversible process. In each case, fibrillogenesis of Aβ1–42 K28C must have started with dimers as initial building blocks and further oligomerized to tetramers and higher oligomers as described for the nucleation and growth of wild-type amyloid β-protein fibrils (32Lomakin A. Chung D.S. Benedek G.B. Kirschner D.A. Teplow D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1125-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Dimeric and also the “monomeric” forms of Aβ17–40 and Aβ17–42 polymerized into arrays of filaments (Fig. 3). Aβ17–42 K28C dimers (Fig. 3A), Aβ17–40 K28C dimers (Fig. 3B), and “monomeric” Aβ17–40 (Fig. 3C) formed granular particles with apparent diameters ranging from 10 nm for the Aβ17–42 K28C dimers, 13 nm for Aβ17–40 K28C dimers, and up to 21 nm for the Aβ17–40 “monomers.” Protofibril lengths of 60–100 nm and mature fibrils of 300 nm for the Aβ17–42 K28C dimer, uniform fibrils of 130–180 nm for the Aβ17–40 “monomer,” and of 200–400 nm for the Aβ17–40 K28C dimer were observed. “Monomeric” Aβ17–42 exhibited the smallest apparent diameter (5–10 nm) but the most pronounced thread forming character with fibril lengths of up to 2.5 μm (Fig. 3D), suggesting that Aβ17–42 fibrils grow by virtually irreversible binding of “monomers” to fibril ends. Strikingly and in contrast to full-length peptides the K28C mutation had a growth-arresting effect on particles, which was more pronounced for Aβ17–42 than for Aβ17–40. This can be best explained by the Cys-28 mutation, which might rather promote a parallel aggregation than an anti-parallel aggregation of Aβ17–40/42. Next, we asked whether conformational changes of dimerization at the N- and C-terminal ends of the K28C peptides could be monitored by immunoreactivity. To produce antisera specific for conformational epitopes of the Aβ K28C dimer, rabbits were immunized with unconjugated freshly dissolved Aβ17–40 K28C dimers. The target antigen choice of the N-terminally truncated peptide was led by the following considerations. First, the majority of antibodies in mice immunized with Aβ fibrils are directed against the N-terminal 12 residues of Aβ and are capable of cross-reacting with the “monomeric” peptide (33Town T. Tan J. Sansone N. Obregon D. Klein T. Mullan M. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 307: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Second, the monoclonal antibody 4G8 recognizing Aβ residues 17–24, which was described to label naturally occurring SDS-stable Aβ dimers on the blot preferentially (17Enya M. Morishima-Kawashima M.

Although expressed at high levels in the kidney, mutations in CFTR result in little or no apparent kidney dysfunction. In an effort to understand this phenomenon, we analyzed ΔF508 CFTR maturation and function in kidney cells under conditions that are common to the kidney, namely osmotic stress. Kidney cells were grown in culture and adapted to 250 mm NaCl and 250 mm urea. High performance liquid chromatography analysis of lysates from kidney cells adapted to these conditions identified an increase in the cellular osmolytes glycerophosphorylcholine, myo-inositol, sorbitol, and taurine. In contrast to isoosmotic conditions, hyperosmotic stress led to the proper folding and processing of ΔF508 CFTR. Furthermore, three of the cellular osmolytes, when added individually to cells, proved effective in promoting the proper folding and processing of the ΔF508 CFTR protein in both epithelial and fibroblast cells. Whole-cell patch clamping of osmolyte-treated cells showed that ΔF508 CFTR had trafficked to the plasma membrane and was activated by forskolin. Encouraged by these findings, we looked at other features common to the kidney that may impact ΔF508 maturation and function. Interestingly, a small molecule, S-nitrosoglutathione, which is a substrate for gamma glutamyltranspeptidase, an abundant enzyme in the kidney, likewise promoted ΔF508 CFTR maturation and function. S-Nitrosoglutathione-corrected ΔF508 CFTR exhibited a shorter half-life as compared with wild type CFTR. These results demonstrate the feasibility of a small molecule approach as a therapeutic treatment in promoting ΔF508 CFTR maturation and function and suggest that an additional treatment may be required to stabilize ΔF508 CFTR protein once present at the plasma membrane. Finally, our observations may help to explain why ΔF508 homozygous patients do not present with kidney dysfunction.

The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) 1The abbreviations used are: CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; CF, cystic fibrosis; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TMAO, trimethylamine N-oxide; GPC, glycerophosphorylcholine; GSNO, S-nitrosoglutathione; IMCD, inner medullary collecting duct; ANOVA, analysis of variance; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; GGT, γ-glutamyltranspeptidase. protein is a cAMP-regulated chloride channel expressed in epithelial cells. Mutations within this protein cause cystic fibrosis, a disease of altered electrolyte transport and dehydration of secretions. The hallmark of CF is the accumulation of thick mucous secretions and frequent colonization of Pseudomonas bacterium within the lungs. Lung function deteriorates with age, and lung pathology is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Other organs affected by this disease are the pancreas, the intestines, and the liver. Interestingly, whereas CFTR is expressed in the kidney, CF patients show little or no kidney dysfunction. Indeed, Dr. di Sant'Agnese, who first identified abnormally high sodium chloride in the sweat of CF patients, also noted “the disassociation between increased electrolytes in the sweat and the low sodium and chloride levels in urine during the periods of low salt diet or heat waves appears to be a unique characteristic of CF” (1di Sant'Agnese P.A. Doershuk C.F. Cystic Fibrosis in the 20th Century. AM Publishing Ltd., Cleveland, OH2001: 17-35Google Scholar). In other words, the ability of the kidney to regulate sodium chloride levels in the urine of CF patients appeared normal. The most prevalent mutation associated with the disease is the deletion of a phenylalanine residue at position 508 (ΔF508 CFTR) (2Kerem B. Rommens J.M. Buchanan J.A. Markiewicz D. Cox T.K. Chakravarti A. Buchwald M. Tsui L.C. Science. 1989; 245: 1073-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (3248) Google Scholar). Loss of this single amino acid results in a failure of the newly synthesized protein to move out of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to its finale locale at the plasma membrane (3Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). This failure is due to the synthesis of a protein that apparently cannot fold properly. Consequently, the protein is retained in the ER and degraded by the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway (4Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 5Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Validation for the idea that the ΔF508 CFTR mutation leads to improper folding is supported by the facts that: 1) misfolding of the protein can be corrected by lowering the temperature of cells expressing the mutant protein (6Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar), 2) correct folding of the protein can occur upon addition of protein stabilizing agents, such as glycerol and TMAO (7Brown C.R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 635-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), and 3) once corrected, the ΔF508 protein can traffic to the plasma membrane and function as a cAMP-regulated chloride channel (6Denning G.M.

Physiol. 2001; 281: L52-L57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During osmotic stress, yeast and sharks increase the intracellular levels of glycerol and TMAO, respectively, two cellular osmolytes known to protect proteins from denaturation under harsh environmental conditions and as mentioned above, effective in correcting ΔF508 CFTR protein folding (10Yancey P.H. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N. Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (3031) Google Scholar, 11Somero G.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: R197-R213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, mammalian systems have their own set of osmolytes, including sorbitol, myo-inositol, betaine, taurine, and glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC) (12Garcia-Perez A. Burg M.B. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 1081-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 13Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F983-F996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These compounds typically accumulate to high concentrations in the kidney medulla as part of the normal physiological process of concentrating urine. In contrast to other organs of epithelial origin, the kidney is considered unaffected in ΔF508 CFTR homozygotes. Therefore, we hypothesized that osmolytes that are synthesized and accumulated within kidney medulla might promote the proper folding and function of the ΔF508 CFTR protein and therefore help explain why ΔF508 CF patients do not present with kidney dysfunction. The iso-osmotic renal cortex also expresses CFTR, but unlike the renal medulla, the absence of disease phenotype cannot be explained by elevated osmolality. Recently, Zaman et al. (14Zaman K. McPherson M. Vaughan J. Hunt J. Mendes F. Gaston B. Palmer L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) reported that S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) promotes the maturation of endogenous wild type and ΔF508 CFTR maturation, although functional data were not presented. Interestingly, GSNO is a substrate for γ-glutamyltranspeptidase, (15Hogg N. Singh R.J. Konorev E. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) a transmembrane protein expressed at high levels in the lumen of the renal cortical proximal kidney (16Curthoys N. Lowry O. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 162-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Curthoys N. Kuhlenschmidt T. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2099-2105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Tate S. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3329-3333Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Here we show that GSNO promotes ΔF508 maturation and restores function while having no effect on wild type CFTR maturation. Thus, our results point to two possible mechanisms, intracellular osmolyte accumulation and hydrolysis of GSNO, carried out by the kidney, as potential explanations why CF patients exhibit little or no kidney dysfunction. Cell Culture and Adenovirus Infections—All cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Mouse inner medullary collecting duct cells (mIMCD3) isolated from the terminal one-third of the IMCD (19Rauchman M.I. Nigam S.K. Delpire E. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F416-F424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. 3T3 cells stably transfected with either the wild type or ΔF508 CFTR plasmid (20Berger H.A. Anderson M.P. Gregory R.J. Thompson S. Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. Mulligan R. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1422-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. For osmotic adaptation experiments, cells were gradually adapted to increasing concentrations of equimolar NaCl and urea over a 3-week period to a final concentration of 250 mm NaCl and 250 mm urea. Cells were maintained at this concentration for an additional 2–3 weeks before the initiation of experiments. For cellular osmolyte treatments, the compounds were added directly to the growth medium of the cells at the concentrations indicated in the text. Expression of either wild type or ΔF508 CFTR using recombinant adenovirus (Ref. 21Howard M. Jiang X. Stolz D.B. Hill W.G. Johnson J.A. Watkins S.C. Frizzell R.A. Bruton C.M. Robbins P.D. Weisz O.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C375-C382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; ΔF508 adenovirus, purchased from Dr. J. Wilson, University of Pennsylvania) was carried out as described previously (21Howard M. Jiang X. Stolz D.B. Hill W.G. Johnson J.A. Watkins S.C. Frizzell R.A. Bruton C.M. Robbins P.D. Weisz O.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C375-C382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours post-infection, 2 mm sodium butyrate was added to the cells to increase transcription of the CFTR cDNA. Eighteen hours later, cells were either harvested for biochemical analysis or used for whole-cell patch clamping. Immunoblotting—Cells were washed twice in calcium free phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA supplemented with protease inhibitors (Calbiochem). The lysates were clarified at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. An aliquot of the supernatant was sampled for protein determination (BCA, Pierce), while the remaining sample was adjusted to 1X Laemmli sample buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 7.5% glycerol) and heated at 37 °C for 20 min. Equal amounts of total protein were loaded on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. Following SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with a monoclonal antibody specific for the CFTR protein (0.3 μg/ml M3A7, Upstate Biotechnology) and an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody at 1:5,000. CFTR protein was visualized by chemiluminescence. Radiolabeling and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were incubated in methionine-free medium for 15 min prior to the addition of 50 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine for 4 h in either the absence or presence of 100 μm GSNO. Increasing the concentration of GSNO resulted in an increase in ΔF508 CFTR protein maturation and thus increased levels of [35S]methionine incorporated into the nascent protein. This enabled better detection of the newly synthesized ΔF508 CFTR protein during the pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation experiments. After 4 h of labeling, the cells were washed and one set of plates was harvested immediately for immunoprecipitation. To the remaining plates, the medium containing the radiolabel was removed and the cells washed with fresh medium and then incubated in medium containing 1 mm cold methionine for 4 h in either the absence or presence of GSNO and then harvested as described above. CFTR was immunoprecipitated from each sample (after being adjusted for equal protein concentration) at 4 °C overnight with 2 μg each of M3A7 and L12B4 (Upstate Biotechnology). Protein G-Sepharose was added to the lysate for 1 h at 4 °C, pelleted at 5,000 × g for 10 s, and washed twice with RIPA (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate in phosphate-buffered saline) buffer. The immune complexes were incubated with 2× Laemmli sample buffer for 30 min at 37 °C, the beads pelleted, and the supernatant then loaded onto a 7.5% gel. Proteins were visualized by fluorography. Patch Clamping—Cells were whole-cell patch-clamped at 37 °C as described previously (22Illek B. Fischer H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L902-L910PubMed Google Scholar). On the stage of an inverted microscope cells were bathed in (in mm): 136 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 127 HCl, 1.7 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 Hepes, 10 glucose, 500 mannitol, pH 7.3. Patch pipettes were filled with (in mm): 130 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 130 HCl, 10 EGTA, 1 MgCl2, 2 Hepes, 1 glucose, 500 mannitol, 5 Mg-ATP, 0.1 Li-GTP, pH 7.3. Single isolated cells were randomly selected for patch clamping. Only seals >10 GΩ were used. After establishing the whole cell configuration the membrane potential (Vm) was continuously clamped to –40 mV. The access resistance (Ra) and the cell membrane capacitance (Cm) were measured using the current transients caused by a 10-mV voltage pulse. Ra = 15 ± 1.2 mΩ (n = 104) and was not affected by the different treatments. Current-voltage (I-V) step protocols before and after addition of 20 μm forskolin were applied, from a resting potential of –40 mV, from –100 mV to +40 mV, and the resulting currents were recorded. Larger voltage jumps reduced the success rate of experiments due to seal breakage and were generally not performed. Whole cell conductance (Gc) was calculated as the slope between –40 and –20 mV. For the calculation of the specific membrane conductance (Gm in picosiemens/picofarad) Gc was corrected for Ra and normalized to Cm. Quantitative effects of different treatments were compared with factorial ANOVAs followed by Bonferroni-corrected t tests. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Calculations were done with StatView, version 4.5 (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). Determination of Cellular Osmolyte Concentration—Control cells (mIMCD3) and hyperosmolar-adapted cells (HT500) were grown on 10-cm plates. Intracellular osmolyte concentrations were determined via HPLC analysis using a modified protocol as described by Rauchman et al. (19Rauchman M.I. Nigam S.K. Delpire E. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F416-F424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in 7% perchloric acid and the lysates centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min. The acid insoluble pellet was resuspended in a 0.5 n NaOH solution and used for subsequent protein analysis using the BCA assay. The acid soluble material was adjusted to neutral pH and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 s. The supernatant was serially filtered through a C8 Sep-Pak column and a 0.45-μm HV filter, lyophilized, and resuspended in HPLC mobile-phase solution and loaded onto an HPLC column. Osmolytes were measured by refractive index. Chemicals and Reagents—Forskolin (Calbiochem) was made as a 20 mm stock in Me2SO and used at 20 μm. GSNO (Sigma), prepared as a fresh stock each time, was dissolved in water at 10 mm and used at 10 μm. Osmolytes (Sigma) were dissolved in medium at 1 m and used at 300 mm. Hyperosmotic-adapted Kidney Cells Accumulate Osmolytes— Mouse inner medullary collecting duct (mIMCD3) cells were cultured under iso-osmotic or hyperosmotic conditions. Cells were stepwise adapted to hyperosmotic conditions by the addition of a 50 mm solution of sodium chloride and urea every 4 days. The final concentration of sodium chloride and urea added was 250 mm each, and therefore, the cells are referred to as HT500 (hypertonic 500 mm, 750 mosmol). The cells retained a number of phenotypic characteristics typical of the kidney, such as tolerance to hyperosmotic conditions for long periods of time with minimal adverse effects on DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis (19Rauchman M.I. Nigam S.K. Delpire E. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F416-F424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Santos B. Pullman J. Chevaile A. Welch W. Gullans S. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F564-F574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adaptation to the hyperosmotic conditions resulted in a significant increase in the intracellular levels of several osmolytes in the kidney cells, in particular, sorbitol, glycerophosphorylcholine, taurine, and myo-inositol (Fig. 1A, filled bars). These changes in the levels of the osmolytes are consistent with levels seen in the kidney medulla, a segment of the kidney routinely exposed to hyperosmolarity (13Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F983-F996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, no increase in betaine was observed in mIMCD cells adapted to 750 mosmol. On the other hand, Rauchman et al. (19Rauchman M.I. Nigam S.K. Delpire E. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F416-F424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) observed an increase in betaine in mIMCD cells adapted to 910 mosmol, while Peterson et al. (24Peterson D.P. Murphy K.M. Ursino R. Streeter K. Yancey P.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F594-F600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that betaine does not increase in the inner medulla of rats subjected to a high protein diet e.g. a diet that increases urea levels in the kidney. Hyperosmotic-adapted Kidney Cells Exhibit Proper Maturation and Functional ΔF508 CFTR—Having established conditions that increase osmolyte levels in the mIMCD3 cells, we tested whether the accumulation of these osmolytes would have any effect on the maturation of the ΔF508 CFTR protein. The rationale based on previous studies showing that osmolytes such as glycerol and TMAO, when added to cells, correct the folding and trafficking of ΔF508 CFTR (7Brown C.R. Hong-Brown L.Q. Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. Welch W.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 8Sato S. Ward C.L. Krouse M.E. Wine J.J. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 635-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Control mIMCD3 cells maintained in iso-osmotic growth medium, and HT500 cells maintained in hyperosmotic growth medium were infected with a recombinant adenovirus expressing either wild type or ΔF508 CFTR. Neither mock-infected mIMCD3 cells nor mock-infected HT500 cells synthesized any detectable CFTR protein, as determined by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 4, respectively). Infection of the mIMCD3 and HT500 cells with a recombinant adenovirus expressing wild type CFTR resulted in the synthesis and detection of both the immature core-glycosylated B band and the mature fully glycosylated C band (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 5). Expression of the ΔF508 CFTR protein in mIMCD3 cells resulted in the appearance of only the core-glycosylated protein (band B), as is normally seen in cells expressing the ΔF508 mutant (Fig. 1B, lane 3). In the ΔF508 CFTR-infected HT500 cells, however, an increase in the amount of the core-glycosylated B band, as well as the processing of a portion of the protein to the mature form (C band) was observed (Fig. 1B, lane 6). Interestingly, ΔF508 CFTR expressed in the HT500 cells exhibited multiple electrophoretic species as evidenced by a smear of bands with slower mobility as compared with the immature B band. At the present time, the exact basis for this heterogeneous collection of CFTR species is not clear. Others, however, have similarly shown the mature CFTR protein to exist as a “broad smear” (5Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R.

Thus, it appears that hyperosmotic conditions promote the proper processing of at least a portion of the mutant ΔF508 CFTR protein, but have no apparent effect on the maturation of wild type CFTR. To test whether the hyperosmotic stress resulted in the synthesis and folding of a functional ΔF508 CFTR protein, the HT500 cells were whole cell patch-clamped to quantify forskolin-stimulated chloride transport. Whole-cell currents were measured under conditions selective for chloride currents in the presence of 20 μm forskolin (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 1C shows typical examples of current step responses recorded from mock-infected and ΔF508 CFTR-infected HT500 cells. HT500 cells expressing ΔF508 CFTR showed large forskolin-activated chloride currents. Measured currents were time- and voltage-independent (Fig. 1C) and showed linear current-voltage relationships (Fig. 1D). Fig. 1E summarizes the calculated specific membrane conductances (G). Thus, whole-cell patch-clamping demonstrated that ΔF508 CFTR expressed in HT500 cells showed significant function, exhibiting typical CFTR-specific characteristics, i.e. chloride selectivity, activation by forskolin, and linear current-voltage relationships. Individual Osmolytes in Fibroblast Cells Promote the Maturation of Functional of ΔF508 CFTR—Having shown that hyperosmotic stress both increases the levels of different osmolytes and promotes the maturation of ΔF508 CFTR, we tested whether the individual osmolytes themselves were effective in correcting ΔF508 misfolding and, thereby, would restore chloride channel function. If so, this would indicate that the osmolytes themselves, rather than some other effect due to salt and urea adaptation of renal cells, can help promote ΔF508 CFTR protein maturation. For these experiments, we utilized 3T3 fibroblasts stably expressing ΔF508 CFTR under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (20Berger H.A. Anderson M.P. Gregory R.J. Thompson S. Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. Mulligan R. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1422-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Using these cells, we previously showed that two other osmolytes, glycerol and TMAO, were effective in correcting the misfolding of the ΔF508 CFTR mutant (7Brown C.R. Hong-Brown L.Q. Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. Welch W.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Denning et al. (6Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar) used these cells to show that incubation at low temperatures (e.g. 27 °C) also corrected the misfolding of ΔF508 CFTR protein. Cells were incubated in growth medium containing the individual osmolytes for 3 days at a concentration of 300 mm, after which the cells were lysed and CFTR expression examined by Western blot (Fig. 2A). Cells not incubated with osmolytes nor stimulated with the general transcriptional activator, sodium butyrate, and cells stimulated with sodium butyrate alone to increase CFTR transcription showed little or no ΔF508 protein in the cells maintained at 37 °C (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). Treatment with the osmolytes myo-inositol, sorbitol, or taurine resulted in a portion of the ΔF508 CFTR protein being correctly folded and processed to the mature form (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–6). Sorbitol treatment elicited the highest levels of the mature form of the protein (Fig. 2A, lane 5), while betaine had little or no effect on ΔF508 CFTR maturation (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Curiously, betaine itself proved to be somewhat toxic to the fibroblast cells with the cells appearing rounded after 3 days of incubation with 300 mm betaine (data not shown). This result is consistent with a previous study showing betaine is toxic to renal cells when added alone to the extracellular medium but is nontoxic when added in conjunction with urea (27Yancey P.H. Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: R198-R204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of the cells at 27 °C along with the osmolytes revealed a synergistic effect on ΔF508 maturation. When incubated at 27 °C, low levels of the immature form of ΔF508 CFTR were now evident and increased upon addition of the general transcriptional activator, sodium butyrate (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). Note as well, and consistent with previous reports showing ΔF508 CFTR folding to be temperature-sensitive, the appearance of the mature form of the protein (band C) in those cells maintained at the lower temperature. When the cells growing at 27 °C now were treated with the various osmolytes, significant amounts of mature ΔF508 CFTR (band C) were observed (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–6, 27 °C). Similar to the situation at 37 °C, addition of betaine (300 mm) to the cells proved to be somewhat toxic after 3 days of incubation (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Thus, ΔF508 CFTR maturation in 3T3 cells can be rescued by either lowering the temperature of the cells or by the addition of various cellular osmolytes. Moreover, osmolyte treatment along with a lower growth temperature resulted in a synergistic enhanced effect on the maturation of the mutant protein. To determine whether the osmolyte-corrected ΔF508 CFTR protein was in fact functional, the 3T3 cells were whole-cell patch-clamped. The cells were incubated in myo-inositol, taurine, TMAO, or sorbitol (300 mm each) for 3 days, and whole cell currents were measured under conditions selective for chloride currents (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 2B shows examples of current step responses recorded from the unstimulated cells (top panels) or from the forskolin-stimulated cells (bottom panels) incubated in the absence or presence of the osmolytes. Wild type CFTR-expressing 3T3 cells showed typical CFTR-mediated chloride currents after forskolin stimulation (Fig. 2B, right panels). Untreated ΔF508 CFTR expressing cells, either without or with forskolin stimulation, showed no chloride currents (Fig. 2B, left panels). In contrast, 3 days of treatment with the different osmolytes resulted in the appearance of large forskolin-activated chloride currents. All measured currents were time- and voltage-independent (Fig. 2B) and showed linear current-voltage relations (Fig. 2C). Fig. 2D summarizes the specific conductance (Gm) from 47 patch-clamped cells. Treatment with myo-inositol, but not any of the other osmolytes, resulted in a significant increase in Gm in the absence of forskolin stimulation. As a control for the effects of myo-inositol on basal currents we used its isomer scyllo-inositol. Cells incubated with scyllo-inositol showed no increase of basal Gm , but upon forskolin stimulation did exhibit an increase in Gm (data not shown). In cells treated with myo-inositol, TMAO, or sorbitol,"

Arachidonic acid or 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), a non-metabolized analog of arachidonic acid, induced a time-dependent inhibition of Na+ transport. These effects were also observed by co-expression of a calcium-independent or a calcium-dependent PLA2. Channels with a truncated α, β,or γ C terminus were not inhibited by arachidonic acid or ETYA. Furthermore, mutation of Tyr618 in the PY motif of the β subunit abrogated the inhibitory effect of ETYA, suggesting that intact PY motifs participate in arachidonic acid-mediated ENaC inhibition. Analyses of channels expressing a series of β subunit C-terminal truncations revealed a second region N-terminal to the PY motif (spanning residues βVal580–βGly599) that allowed for ETYA-mediated ENaC inhibition. Analyses of both ENaC surface expression and ENaC trafficking with mutants that either gate channels open or closed in response to [(2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl] methanethiosulfonate bromide, or with brefeldin A, suggest that ETYA reduces channel surface expression by inhibiting ENaC exocytosis and increasing ENaC endocytosis.

ENaC is formed by three subunits, termed αβγ, arranged with a subunit stoichiometry of 2α:1β:1γ (1Kosari F. Sheng S. Li J. Mak D.O. Foskett J.K. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13469-13474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 2Firsov D. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Rossier B.C. Schild L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), although an alternative 3α:3β:3γ stoichiometry has been proposed (3Snyder P.M. Cheng C. Prince L.S. Rogers J.C. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The three subunits are similar in overall structure, with intracellular N and C termini, two transmembrane spanning domains, and a large extracellular domain. Several hormones, such as aldosterone, arginine vasopressin, insulin, as well as selected kinases, modulate ENaC activity. ENaC activity can be regulated by two distinct mechanisms: (i) changes in single channel gating properties (i.e. open probability) or (ii) changing the number of Na+ channels in the apical membrane. The number of Na+ channels expressed at the cell surface reflects a balance of delivery of channels to the plasma membrane and internalization of channels from the plasma membrane. Arachidonic acid is found in the sn-2 position of membrane phospholipids, where it can potentially be liberated by the deacylating action of different lipases. Arachidonic acid and its metabolites have been implicated in the regulation of a number of important physiologic processes in the kidney, including water and Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion (4Bonventre J.V. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 404-412PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is the principal enzyme responsible for arachidonic acid production in most mammalian cells (5Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Dennis E.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). PLA2 can be classified in reference to its intracellular (calcium-independent (iPLA2) or calcium-dependent (cPLA2)) or extracellular (secretory (sPLA2)) localization. iPLA2 is a membrane-associated enzyme that has been implicated in phospholipid remodeling and signal transduction (6Winstead M.V. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 28-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Overexpression of iPLA2 increased the spontaneous release of fatty acids including arachidonic acid (7Murakami M. Shimbara S. Kambe T. Kuwata H. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14411-14423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The 85-kDa cPLA2 is a ubiquitously expressed enzyme and is the only PLA2 that preferentially hydrolyzes the sn-2 position of phospholipids to produce arachidonic acid. The liberation of arachidonic acid occurs by activation of cPLA2 in response to several agonists and cell-specific intracellular signals that involve G-proteins, increases in cytosolic Ca2+, and activation of kinases such as mitogen-activated protein kinases and protein kinase C (8Hirabayashi T. Shimizu T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 124-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 9Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16709-16712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Recent findings suggest the participation of PLA2s in the control of trafficking and surface expression of integral membrane proteins including the α and β subunits of Na+, K+-ATPase, and aquaporin-2 (10Chibalin A.V.

Rosenzweig A. Brown D. Bonventre J.V. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 983-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Early work in toad urinary bladder suggested a regulatory effect of PLA2 and prostaglandin synthetase on transepithelial Na+ transport under both control and aldosterone-stimulated conditions (12Yorio T. Bentley P.J. Nature. 1978; 271: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, the epithelial cell line A6 derived from Xenopus laevis kidney, grown on non-permeable supports, expressed apical Na+ channels that were regulated by the activities of phospholipase and lipoxygenase enzymes (13Cantiello H.F. Patenaude C.R. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. Ausiello D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21624-21628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study reported that inhibition of PLA2 by the addition of aristolochic acid to the apical bath increased amiloride-sensitive transepithelial Na+ transport in A6 cells and was associated with a reduction in the production of arachidonic acid. 5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), a non-metabolized analog of arachidonic acid, antagonized this effect through a reduction in ENaC open probability (14Worrell R.T. Bao H.F. Denson D.D. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C147-C156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the addition of blockers of PLA2 or cyclooxygenase to the basolateral bath inhibited transepithelial Na+ transport. This decrease in Na+ transport was reversed by prostaglandin E2 (14Worrell R.T. Bao H.F. Denson D.D. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C147-C156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Matsumoto P.S. Mo L. Wills N.K. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 160: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The oocyte expression system has been extensively used to study ENaC regulation and to identify regions within ENaC involved in gating and trafficking. We used this system to explore mechanisms by which arachidonic acid regulates ENaC. We demonstrated that both arachidonic acid and ETYA induced a time-dependent reduction in the functional expression of ENaC by reducing surface expression of channels in association with altering the rates of delivery and internalization of functional channels. Furthermore, we have identified two distinct C-terminal domains that were required for ETYA-mediated inhibition of ENaC surface expression. DNA Constructs—Point mutations or truncations of mENaC subunits were performed by site-directed mutagenesis with the sequential PCR method using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (16Sheng S. McNulty K.A. Harvey J.M. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44091-44098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). PCR-amplified fragments containing the desired mutations were ligated into wild type mENaC cDNA. C-terminal truncations were generated by the introduction of stop codons at the desired positions. Mutants that were generated included αH613X, βR564X, βV580X, βE600X, βS620X, βY618A, and γR583X. βmENaC was tagged with the FLAG reporter octapeptide in the extracellular loop between Thr137 and Arg138 as described by Firsov et al. (17Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). PCR-amplified fragments were sequenced by automated DNA sequencing at the University of Pittsburgh Sequencing Facility to confirm the desired mutation or insertion. Mouse iPLA2 (GenBank™ accession number BC003487) and mouse cPLA2 cDNAs (GenBank™ accession number BC003816) were obtained from Openbiosystems (Livermore, CA). Oocyte Expression—cRNAs for α, β, and γ mENaC subunits, iPLA2 and cPLA2, were synthesized with T3, T7, or SP6 mMessage mMachine™ (Ambion, Austin, TX). Stage V–VI X. laevis oocytes were pretreated with 1.5 mg/ml type IV collagenase and injected with 0.5–2 ng/subunit of mENaC cRNAs. Some oocytes were co-injected with mENaC cRNAs and with either 0.1–5 ng of iPLA2 cRNA or with 5 ng of cPLA2 cRNA. Injected oocytes were maintained at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline (MBS) (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 15 mm HEPES, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, pH 7.4) supplemented with 10 μg/ml sodium penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate. Two-electrode Voltage Clamp—Two-electrode voltage clamp (TEV) was performed using a GeneClamp 500B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Data were acquired through Clampex 7.0 using a DigiData 1200 interface at 1 kHz and stored on a hard disk of a 233-MHz Pentium II PC. Pipettes had resistances of 0.5–5 megohms when filled with 3 m KCl. Oocytes were maintained in a recording chamber with 1 ml of bath solution and continuously perfused with TEV solution containing (in mm) 110 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.54 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. Oocytes currents were allowed to stabilize over 10 min before reagent addition. Only oocytes with stable currents during the stabilization period were used in TEV experiments. After this period, a series of voltage steps (500 ms) from -140 to +60 mV in 20-mV increments were performed every 2 min. Mean currents between 100 and 500 ms were calculated at a clamp potential of -100 mV. ENaC-mediated Na+ currents were defined as the current difference in the absence and presence of amiloride (100 μm) or benzamil (100 μm) in the bath solution. Arachidonic Acid Release—Oocytes were co-injected with ENaC (2 ng/subunit) with our without iPLA2 (5 ng). Oocytes expressing ENaC currents were sorted 14–16 h after injection by TEV and incubated for 20 h in 6-well plates (31 oocyte/well) in MBS supplemented with 1 μCi/ml [3H]arachidonic acid (ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) in a total volume of 3 ml/well, to allow [3H]arachidonic acid to be incorporated into the cellular lipid pool. Oocytes were then transferred to fresh wells and were washed four times with 6 ml of MBS supplement with 0.5% (w/v) bovine albumin (fatty acid-free, Sigma). Three additional washes were performed over 15 min. The release of [3H]arachidonic acid from oocytes was measured by placing groups of 10 oocytes in 3 ml of MBS supplement with 0.5% of bovine albumin (fatty acid-free). After 30 min, the incubation media were removed, and fresh media were added. This was repeated at 60 and 120 min. Oocytes were then homogenized in 3 ml of fresh media. Radioactivity in the incubation media and in the cell lysate was measured by scintillation counting. The release of 3H was expressed as the percentage of the total radioactivity. Cell Surface Expression—Experiments were performed essentially as described previously (18Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 2 ng/subunit of αβγ wild type, αβ-FLAG-γ, or αβ-FLAG-Y618A-γ mENaC. Oocytes expressing ENaC currents were sorted 18–24 h after injection by TEV. Forty two to 48 h after injection oocytes were incubated for 20 min in vehicle (Me2SO) or ETYA (50 μm) in MBS. Oocytes were blocked for 30 min in MBS supplement with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (MBS/BSA) and then incubated for 1 h with MBS/BSA supplement with 1 μg/ml of a mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma) at 4 °C. Oocytes were then washed at 4 °C for 1 h in MBS/BSA and incubated with MBS/BSA supplemented with 1 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase coupled secondary antibody for 1 h at 4 °C (peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure F(ab′2) fragment goat anti-mouse IgG, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Cells were extensively washed (12 times over 2 h) at 4 °C and transferred to MBS without BSA. Individual oocytes were placed in 100 μl of SuperSignal Elisa Femto (Pierce) and incubated at room temperature for 1 min. Chemiluminescence was quantitated in a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Rate of ENaC Exocytosis—Covalent modification of the αβγG542C mutant by [(2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl] methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET, Toronto Research Chemicals, North York, Ontario, Canada) resulted in a large (>90%) reduction in whole cell Na+ currents (19Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Bucher D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28484-28490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The subsequent delivery of unmodified intracellular channels resulted in an increase in ENaC-mediated Na+ currents. Oocytes expressing αβγG542C were perfused with TEV solution for 4 min, and then accessible cysteine residues were modified for 4 min by perfusion with a TEV solution containing MTSET (1 mm). Cells were then perfused with TEV solution with or without ETYA (50 μm). ENaC-mediated Na+ currents were subsequently determined by perfusion with TEV solution containing benzamil (100 μm) to block ENaC currents. Rates of ENaC Internalization—To examine ENaC removal from plasma membranes, oocytes were injected with αS580Cβγ. Covalent modification of this mutant by MTSET resulted in a channel open probability that approached 1 (20Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Kieber-Emmons T. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1326-1334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and subsequent decreases in whole cell Na+ currents should reflect channel internalization. Oocytes expressing αS580Cβγ were perfused for 4 min in TEV solution, and subsequently for 4 min with a TEV solution containing 1 mm MTSET to modify accessible cysteine residues. Oocytes were then perfused with a TEV solution with or without ETYA (50 μm) for 20 min. ENaC-mediated Na+ currents were then blocked by perfusion with TEV solution containing benzamil (100 μm). A second assay used to examine whether ETYA enhanced rates of channel internalization was based on the interruption of delivery of newly synthesized channels to the plasma membrane by brefeldin A (BFA) (21Shimkets R.A. Lifton R.P. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25537-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Thirty h following co-injection of oocytes with αβγ cRNAs, amiloride-sensitive currents were measured by TEV. Oocytes were incubated with vehicle (Me2SO) alone or with BFA (5 μm) in the presence or absence of ETYA (10 μm). Amiloride-sensitive currents were recorded at 0, 1, 3, and 5 h following addition of vehicle or BFA (±ETYA). Isolation of Oocyte Plasma Membranes—Oocyte membranes from 250 stage ν–VI oocytes were purified essentially according to the method of Perez et al. (22Perez G. Lagrutta A. Adelman J.P. Toro L. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1022-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with the addition of 2× 500 × g spins of the homogenate to remove yolk and granules. Alkaline phosphodiesterase I, a plasma membrane-localized enzyme, showed an ∼30-fold enrichment over homogenate. Membranes were either used fresh or flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Fluorescence Anisotropy—Oocyte plasma membranes were incubated in 10 μm diphenylhexatriene (DPH) for several minutes at room temperature and then placed on ice and kept dark. Fluorescence polarization measurements on probe-equilibrated membranes (100 μl) were performed at 20 °C in 2 ml of buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, on an SLM Aminco Bowman Series 2 fluorometer equipped with stirring and software controlled automated prism polarizers. Anisotropy measurements were made following 20-min incubations at room temperature with either Me2SO control (1:1000 dilution) or freshly made drugs (final concentration 50 μm) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 354 and 428 nm, respectively. Anisotropy values were calculated by AB2 software supplied with the fluorometer. Statistics—Data were expressed as the mean ± S.E., unless otherwise indicated, where n equals the number of independent experiments analyzed. Electrophysiological data were analyzed with Clampfit 8.1 (Axon Instruments), and statistical comparisons were performed using GraphPad Instant 3.05 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego). Arachidonic Acid Regulates ENaC Expressed in Xenopus Oocytes—TEV was performed in Xenopus oocytes expressing αβγ mENaC to examine mechanisms by which arachidonic acid influences amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport. Inhibition of PLA2 by perfusion with aristolochic acid (100 μm) significantly increased amiloride-sensitive currents by 19.1 ± 0.4% (n = 9, p < 0.0001 versus control) after 10 min (Fig. 1, A and B). Changes in amiloride-sensitive currents were independent of clamp voltage (Fig. 1C). In contrast, perfusion with either arachidonic acid (50 μm) or ETYA (50 μm) induced a time-dependent reduction in amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents (Fig. 2). Amiloride-sensitive currents measured after 20 min of perfusion, relative to amiloride-sensitive currents determined immediately prior to perfusion, were 0.89 ± 0.03 (n = 11) in control oocytes, 0.64 ± 0.03 (n = 16) in ETYA-treated oocytes (p < 0.001 versus control) and 0.58 ± 0.07 (n = 8) in arachidonic acid-treated oocytes (p < 0.001 versus control). Because ETYA inhibits both the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism (23Salari H. Braquet P. Borgeat P. Prostaglandins Leukot.

Relative amiloride-sensitive currents measured in αβγENaC-expressing oocytes after 20 min in TEV solution alone (0.89 ± 0.03, n = 11) were not significantly different from relative amiloride-sensitive currents measured in ENaC-expressing oocytes after 20 min in TEV solution plus vehicle (Me2SO 1:1000 dilution, 0.84 ± 0.04, n = 8, p = not significant). Changes in amiloride-sensitive currents in response to ETYA or arachidonic acid were independent of the clamp voltage. Fig. 3B shows amiloride-sensitive I/ν curves obtained before and after treatment of oocytes with ETYA. No changes in reversal potential or induction of rectification of amiloride-sensitive sodium currents were observed following treatment of ENaC-expressing oocytes with ETYA or arachidonic acid (data not shown).Fig. 2Time-dependent inhibition of amiloride-sensitive whole cell Na+ currents by arachidonic acid and ETYA. Whole cell currents were recorded in oocytes expressing αβγ mENaC and perfused with the TEV bath solution alone (circle, n = 11) or with the TEV bath solution supplemented with arachidonic acid (50 μm, square, n = 8) or ETYA (50 μm, triangle, n = 16) at time = 0 min. Amiloride (100 μm) was added to the bath at time = 20 min, and relative amiloridesensitive currents (at -100 mV) were plotted as a function of time. Initial amiloride-sensitive whole cell currents (time = 0 min) were -8.18 ± 1.19 μA (control), -8.04 ± 1.71 μA (arachidonic acid), and -6.44 ± 0.80 μA (ETYA). Statistically significant differences are indicated as *, p < 0.05 (control versus arachidonic acid) and p < 0.01 (control versus ETYA); **, p < 0.01 (control versus ETYA and control versus arachidonic acid); +, p < 0.001 (control versus ETYA and control versus arachidonic acid). Statistical comparisons were performed by Kruskal Wallis test (nonparametric ANOVA) followed by Dunn's multiple comparisons post test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Inhibition of ENaC by ETYA. A, representative recordings in an oocyte expressing αβγ ENaC before (control), 20 min after addition of ETYA (50 μm), and after amiloride (100 μm). Whole cell currents were obtained by clamping the oocyte in 20-mV steps from -140 to 60 mV. B, current/voltage (I/ν) relationship of amiloride-sensitive whole cell currents in ETYA-treated oocytes. Whole cell amiloride-sensitive currents from oocytes expressing ENaC were recorded before (circle) and after (triangle) 20 min of perfusion with ETYA (50 μm) (n = 16). Amiloride-sensitive currents were determined by subsequent perfusion with 100 μm amiloride.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Co-expression of iPLA 2 or cPLA 2 Inhibits ENaC-mediated Na + Currents—iPLA2 and cPLA2 are implicated in the liberation of arachidonic acid from the sn-2 position of membrane phospholipids under physiological conditions (5Balsinde J.

We performed an [3H]arachidonic acid-release assay to determine whether iPLA2 is functional when co-expressed with ENaC. Oocytes co-injected with ENaC and iPLA2 showed a 23.6 ± 3.9% increase (at 120 min) in the release of [3H]arachidonic acid, when compared with oocytes injected with ENaC alone (p < 0.001, n = 5–6, Fig. 4A). These data suggest that iPLA2 is functional when expressed in oocytes. To determine whether co-expression of iPLA2 and ENaC reproduces the inhibitory effects of arachidonic acid and ETYA on ENaC activity, oocytes were co-injected with αβγENaC cRNAs and increasing amounts of iPLA2 cRNA. After 18 h amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents were determined, and currents were normalized to control oocytes expressing αβγENaC alone. A dose-dependent reduction in amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents was observed in response to increasing amounts of iPLA2 cRNA injected. Relative amiloride-sensitive whole cell currents measured in oocytes co-injected with αβγENaC and 5 ng of iPLA2 cRNAs were 68.0 ± 6.9% of the current measured in oocytes expressing αβγENaC alone (p < 0.05; n = 50–68; see Fig. 4B). Co-injection of oocytes with αβγENaC cRNAs and 5 ng of cPLA2 cRNA also led to a significant reduction in expression of amiloride-sensitive whole cell current, compared with oocytes expressing αβγENaC alone (relative amiloride-sensitive whole cell currents: 0.72 ± 0.07 (ENaC + cPLA2) versus 1.00 ± 0.07 (ENaC); p < 0.01, n = 54). ENaC C-terminal Domains Are Required for Arachidonic Acid-mediated Inhibition of Na + Currents—To identify domains in ENaC that are required for arachidonic acid-mediated channel down-regulation, deletions of the C-terminal intracellular regions of each subunit (αH613X, βR564X, or γR583X) were generated. Expression of mENaCs with C-terminal deletions of the α, β, or γ subunit prevented the arachidonic acid or ETYA-mediated inhibition of ENaC currents (Fig. 5), suggesting that regions present in the C terminus of each subunit are involved in arachidonic acid-mediated channel down-regulation. One possible candidate is the PY motif, PPPXYXXL, a conserved tract present in the three ENaC subunits that interacts with WW domains within the ubiquitin protein ligase Nedd4 (26Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar) and facilitates channel ubiquitination and endocytosis (27Rotin D. Kanelis V. Schild L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F391-F399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This tract also has a hydrophobic internalization motif, YXXL, as defined previously (28Snyder P.M.

To examine further the role of the PY motif in arachidonic acid-mediated ENaC downregulation, αβY618Aγ was expressed in oocytes. Previous studies have shown that this mutation abrogates Nedd4 binding to ENaC and reduces rates of ENaC internalization from the plasma membrane (29Goulet C.C. Volk K.A. Adams C.M. Prince L.S.

ETYA did not significantly inhibit amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents in oocytes expressing αβY618Aγ (n = 11, p = not significant, Fig. 6). A series of C-terminal truncations of the β subunit (βν580X, βE600X, and βS620X) were generated and co-expressed with wild type α and γ mENaC to define further the regions involved in arachidonic acid-mediated regulation of ENaC (Fig. 6). No significant inhibitory effect of ETYA on amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents was observed in oocytes expressing a C-terminal deletion of the terminal 19 amino acids of the β subunit (βS620X) that truncates the β subunit just beyond Tyr618 and within the YXXL motif (n = 8, p = not significant, αβS620Xγ (+ETYA) versus αβγ (-ETYA)). Surprisingly, deletion of 20 additional residues (βE600X) of the β subunit restored ETYA-mediated inhibition of ENaC (n = 15, p < 0.01), whereas the inhibitory effect of ETYA was not observed with deletion of the C-terminal 59 amino acids (βν580X, n = 6, p = not significant).Fig. 6Identification of domains within the intracellular C terminus of βmENaC that are involved in ETYA-mediated channel inhibition. TEV was performed in oocytes expressing αβγ, αβY618Aγ, or a series of C-terminal truncations, including αβR564Xγ, αβν580Xγ, αβE600Xγ, and αβS620Xγ. At time = 0 oocytes were perfused with the TEV bath solution alone or supplemented with ETYA (50 μm). Amiloride-sensitive currents were determined 20 min following addition of treatment and were normalized to currents determined at time = 0. Initial whole cell amiloride-sensitive currents (time = 0 before addition of reagents) were -7.01 ± 0.76 μA (αβγ (wild type)), -9.83 ± 1.68 μA (αβY618Aγ), -10.43 ± 2.25 μA (αβR564Xγ), -9.90 ± 2.78 (αβg=n\580Xγ), -10.30 ± 1.62 (αβE600Xγ), and -16.39 ± 1.84 μA (αβS620Xγ).

https://openalex.org/W2003676718,"Escherichia coli 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase is an iron-sulfur flavoenzyme required for the metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids with double bonds at even carbon positions. The enzyme contains FMN, FAD, and a 4Fe-4S cluster and exhibits sequence homology to another iron-sulfur flavoprotein, trimethylamine dehydrogenase. It also requires NADPH as an electron source, resulting in reduction of the C4-C5 double bond of the acyl chain of the CoA thioester substrate. The structure presented here of a ternary complex of E. coli 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase with NADP+ and a fatty acyl-CoA substrate reveals a possible mechanism for substrate reduction and provides details of a plausible electron transfer mechanism involving both flavins and the iron-sulfur cluster. The reaction is initiated by hydride transfer from NADPH to FAD, which in turn transfers electrons, one at a time, to FMN via the 4Fe-4S cluster. In the final stages of the reaction, the fully reduced FMN provides a hydride ion to the C5 atom of substrate, and Tyr-166 and His-252 are proposed to form a catalytic dyad that protonates the C4 atom of the substrate and complete the reaction. Inspection of the substrate binding pocket explains the relative promiscuity of the enzyme, catalyzing reduction of both 2-trans,4-cis- and 2-trans,4-trans-dienoyl-CoA thioesters.

Inspection of the substrate binding pocket explains the relative promiscuity of the enzyme, catalyzing reduction of both 2-trans,4-cis- and 2-trans,4-trans-dienoyl-CoA thioesters. Metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids requires auxiliary enzymes in addition to those used in β-oxidation. After a given number of cycles through the β-oxidation pathway, those unsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs with double bonds at even-numbered carbon positions contain 2-trans,4-cis double bonds that cannot be modified by enoyl-CoA hydratase. Therefore, an auxiliary enzyme, 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (DCR 1The abbreviations used are: DCR, 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase; TMDh, trimethylamine dehydrogenase; SAD, single wavelength anomalous; OYE, old yellow enzyme.1The abbreviations used are: DCR, 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase; TMDh, trimethylamine dehydrogenase; SAD, single wavelength anomalous; OYE, old yellow enzyme.; EC 1.3.1.34), is used that utilizes NADPH to remove the C4-C5 double bond (1Dommes V. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1781-1788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2You S.Y. Cosloy S. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16489-16495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DCR is unusual in that it lacks stereospecificity, catalyzing the reduction of both natural fatty acids with cis double bonds, as well as substrates containing trans double bonds (3Cuebas D. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14140-14144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two structurally unrelated forms of DCR have been isolated, both of which use NADPH as reducing equivalents to catalyze reduction of a 2,4-dienoyl-CoA to an enoyl-CoA. The Escherichia coli enzyme contains both FMN and FAD noncovalently bound to a single polypeptide, reducing the substrate by a hydride transfer mechanism in which reducing equivalents from NADPH are supplied indirectly to substrate (1Dommes V. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1781-1788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It functions as a monomer, having a molecular mass of 73 kDa, and has been shown recently to contain a 4Fe-4S cluster (4Liang X. Thorpe C. Schulz H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 380: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The enzyme produces 2-trans-enoyl-CoA (1Dommes V. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1781-1788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which can be incorporated into the β-oxidation pathway. In contrast, three homologous eukaryotic forms have been identified, two mitochondrial and one peroxisomal. Two of these lack flavin and iron-sulfur cofactors but are homotetramers with a total molecular mass of 124 kDa. (The third has not been characterized.) The substrate is reduced by a direct hydride transfer mechanism from NADPH to form trans-3-enoyl-CoA (1Dommes V. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1781-1788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, eukaryotic DCR requires another auxiliary enzyme, Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase, to convert trans-3-enoyl-CoA to trans-2-enoyl-CoA (1Dommes V. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1781-1788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which can be subsequently fed into the β-oxidation pathway. Lastly, eukaryotic DCR has been shown to metabolize fatty acids with double bonds at odd as well as even positions (5Smeland T.E. Nada M. Cuebas D. Schulz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6673-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 6He X.Y. Shoukry K. Chu C. Yang J. Sprecher H. Schulz H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas there is currently no evidence to support this for the E. coli enzyme. In addition to DCR from E. coli, sequence analysis shows both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria to have open reading frames encoding for DCR-like proteins; for example Yersinia pestis and Streptomyces coelicolor proteins have 72 and 62% sequence identities, respectively, with E. coli DCR. These conserved residues include the four cysteine residues that coordinate the iron-sulfur cluster and the cofactor binding sequence motifs. E. coli DCR also shares homology with a large family of TIM barrel-containing flavoenzymes, including the single-domain TIM barrel enzyme NADH oxidase from Thermoanaerobium brockii, which shares a 30% identity and much larger multi-domained proteins such as trimethylamine dehydrogenase (TMDh) from Methylotrophus methylophilus; this enzyme also contains a 4Fe-4S cluster and shares a 26% sequence identity with DCR spanning the entire length of both polypeptides (7He X.Y. Yang S.Y. Schulz H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A preliminary report on the structure of a functional homolog of DCR, 2-enoate reductase from Clostridium tyrobutyricim, has been presented (8Steinbacher S. Stumpf M. Weinkauf S. Rohdich F. Bacher A. Simon H. Chapman S. Perham R. Scrutton N. Flavins and Flavoproteins 2002. Agency for Scientific Publications, Berlin2002: 941-949Google Scholar). This enzyme shares a 32% sequence identity with E. coli DCR, binding FMN, FAD, and a 4Fe-4S cluster; however, 2-enoate reductase differs from DCR because it functions as a dodecamer, uses NADH rather than NADPH as an electron source, and reduces 2-enoates that are not activated by conjugation to CoA. Because the 2-enoate reductase structure reported lacks a bound substrate analog, little is known about its enzyme mechanism, including how the flavin and iron-sulfur cofactors participate in electron transfer from NAD(P)H to substrate. To this end, the crystal structure of E. coli DCR has been solved in the presence of substrate and gives insights into the catalytic and electron transfer mechanisms of prokaryotic forms of DCR. Protein Purification—Protein was expressed and purified as described previously (7He X.Y. Yang S.Y. Schulz H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmid pNDH, which encodes E. coli DCR, was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. Cells were cultured in Luria broth medium and induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside before being pelleted and resuspended by sonication into a 20 mm phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.4, including 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The suspension was centrifuged, and the supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column (Sigma). A 100 mm phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.4, including 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol was used to elute protein, which was subsequently transferred to a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences). Protein was eluted with a 20 mm phosphate buffer solution containing 5 μm 2-trans,4-trans-decadienoyl-CoA and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol; the free ligand was removed by passing through another DEAE-cellulose column. Protein was stored at –80 °C in 20% glycerol, 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Protein Crystallization—Purified protein was crystallized by vapor diffusion using the hanging-drop method (9McPherson A. Crystallization of Biological Macromolecules. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 176-196Google Scholar), with the reservoir solution containing 30% polyethylene glycol 5000 monomethyl ether, 0.2 m sodium acetate, 0.1 m ammonium sulfate, and 0.1 m 2-(N-morpholino)ethane sulfonic acid, pH 6.5. Precipitant solution containing 18% polyethylene glycol 5000 monomethyl ether, 180 mm sodium acetate, 90 mm ammonium sulfate, and 90 mm 2-(N-morpholino)ethane sulfonic acid, pH 6.5, was mixed with protein at 15 mg/ml in a 1:1.5 volume ratio. Protein in storage solution was thawed and concentrated in the presence of a 2-fold molar excess of NADP+ before crystallization set-up. Rod-shaped crystals having a yellow/brown color appeared within about 1 week, reaching a maximum size of 40 × 40 × 500 μm. No cryoprotectant was used before flash cooling the crystals in liquid nitrogen. Crystals typically diffracted to 2.2 Å. Two heavy atom derivatives of DCR were used for phasing; first, a mercury derivative was made by co-crystallizing protein in the presence of a precipitant solution containing 10% saturated mercuric acetate. An osmium derivative was obtained by soaking crystals in reservoir solution containing 100% saturated osmium hexachloride for 10 min. In both cases, no additional cryo-protectant was used prior to cryo-cooling. Data Collection and Structure Determination—A complete native data set of DCR was collected in-house using an R-AXIS IIC image plate equipped with a Rigaku RU 200 generator, an MSC X-stream cooling system set at –180 °C, and Osmic blue confocal mirrors. High resolution data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne, IL), beam-line 14-BM-C. Data were processed using the HKL suite of programs (10Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38555) Google Scholar). Difference Patterson map analysis was performed in XtalView (11McRee D.E. Practical Protein Crystallography. Academic Press, San Diego1999Google Scholar), and phases were calculated using either SHARP (12La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar) (for single wavelength anomalous (SAD) phases) or SOLVE (13Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar) (for multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering phases). Cross-Fourier calculations for locating additional heavy atom sites were done using PHASES (14Furey W. Swaminathan S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 590-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), and phase combination of SAD and multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering phases was carried out using CNS (15Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kuntsleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16963) Google Scholar). The resulting phases were improved by density modification using SOLOMON (16Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar), as implemented in SHARP, with subsequent inclusion of partial structure. Model building was initially done using Xfit (11McRee D.E. Practical Protein Crystallography. Academic Press, San Diego1999Google Scholar), with the final stages in O (17Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13010) Google Scholar). Multiple cycles of refinement were performed in CNS, with rigid body refinement, simulated annealing, and positional refinement used in the initial stages, and positional and B-factor refinement during later stages of refinement. Water molecules were included near the end of refinement, initially using the program DDQ (18van den Akker F. Hol W.G. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 206-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), followed by manual addition in the O graphics program. Structure-based sequence alignment was performed using INDONESIA, 2Madsen, D., Johansson, P., and Kleywegt, G. J. Web address: xray.bmc.uu.se/~dennis. using the Levitt and Gerstein method (36Levitt M. Gerstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5913-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), followed by some manual adjustments. Electrostatic and surface calculations were performed using GRASP (19Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5315) Google Scholar). Electron transfer pathway calculations were made using HARLEM (20Curry W.B. Grabe M.D. Kurnikov I.V. Skourtis S.S. Beratan D.N. Regan J.J. Aquino A.J. Beroza P. Onuchic J.N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Structure Determination—Native crystals diffracted to 2.4 Å using the in-house x-ray source, with data collected at the synchrotron extending to 2.2 Å. The mercury derivative diffracted in-house to 2.7 Å, and the osmium derivative to 2.4 Å at the synchrotron. The Harker sections of the native anomalous difference Patterson map from in-house data showed a strong peak, above 10 σ, corresponding to the 4Fe-4S cluster; however, the resolution was insufficient to resolve individual iron peaks. SAD phasing was performed in SHARP using the four iron atoms from an ideal 4Fe-4S cluster, which were positioned to give the best visual agreement with the Patterson map. The phases were modified in SOLOMON, and the resulting map showed clear density indicating a large TIM barrel domain in the structure, with traceable density outlining two additional domains extending into other parts of the molecule. Cross-Fourier analysis of mercury and osmium derivatives showed them to contain one and two heavy atom sites per asymmetric unit, respectively. These data were scaled and phased in SOLVE using both isomorphous and anomalous components, then combined with the SAD phases from SHARP using the “combine” CNS script, prior to performing density modification in SOLOMON. These steps resulted in minor improvements in electron density for a medium-sized and a small domain, with the most pronounced improvement around what was subsequently shown to be the FAD moiety in the small domain. An initial Cα-atom trace was made, and this model was included in a further round of solvent flattening using SigmaA phase combination (21Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr.

Open table in a new tab Overall Protein Structure—The overall fold of the enzyme is composed of three domains: an N-terminal TIM barrel (residues 1–368) which binds FMN, the 4Fe-4S cluster, and the substrate; a flavodoxin-like fold (residues 369–467 and 626–671) which binds FAD; and an NADP(H)-binding domain (residues 468–625) (Fig. 1). These domains will be referred to as the N-terminal, middle, and C-terminal domains, respectively. There are two disordered regions including residues 370–372 and residues 452–455, both of which form part of the loops on the surface of the protein; however, both N and C termini are well defined, with the C terminus ending as an α-helix. The arrangement of the three domains and the overall polypeptide fold resemble that seen in TMDh (22Lim L.W. Shamala N. Mathews F.S. Steenkamp D.J. Hamlin R. Xuong N.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15140-15146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structure-based sequence alignment with TMDh shows DCR to have an α-helical insert in the C-terminal domain, which forms part of the protein's surface (Fig. 2). A large loop, which forms part of the dimer interface of TMDh in the C-terminal domain (residues 607–630), is missing in DCR, as is the C-terminal extension. Superimposition of DCR with one monomer of TMDh gives an r.m.s. deviation of ∼1.5 Å over 467 Cα carbon atoms (corresponding mostly to residues within the N-terminal and middle domains), showing that the high degree of sequence similarity extends to structural similarity. The FMN and 4Fe-4S cofactors that appear in both proteins are spatially conserved, and the bound ADP of TMDh occupies the same spatial position as the ADP portion of FAD in DCR. The conserved cysteine residues (334, 337, 341, and 353) coordinate the four iron atoms of the iron-sulfur cluster (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Structure-based sequence alignment of DCR (dcr) with TMDh (tmdhase). Their corresponding secondary structure elements are included. The resulting sequence alignment was fixed, and the sequence of enoate reductase (eno_red) was included to improve accuracy of the alignment with DCR. Black and white boxes show identical and homologous residues, respectively. Gray boxes indicate cysteine residues that coordinate the iron-sulfur cluster; the two black chevrons highlight the catalytic residues of DCR. The figure was generated using ESPript (33Gouet P.

This density could be fitted with one molecule of substrate, 2-trans,4-trans-decadienoyl-CoA (used for elution from the affinity column during protein purification), which was included in the model for subsequent rounds of model building and refinement. However, what was surprising during the mid-stages of model building was that the density bifurcated in the middle of the acyl chain. Further rounds of model building and refinement showed this fork to stem from the C5 atom of the acyl chain of the substrate, and that the C4-C5 double bond had been reduced by β-mercaptoethanol (included during protein purification and also in the storage buffer). The strong electron density in the [|Fo | – |Fc |] map corresponding to the sulfur atom of β-mercaptoethanol allowed correct placement of the remaining acyl chain and of β-mercaptoethanol, showing the product to have R-configuration at the chiral center (carbon 5). Fig. 3A shows an OMIT map confirming bifurcation at the C5 atom. The carbon-carbon double bond of substrate that is reduced during catalysis (atoms C4-C5 of the acyl chain) is sandwiched between the si-face of the isoalloxazine ring of FMN, centered around atom N5, and two residues of the polypeptide chain, Tyr-166 and His-252. The phenolic oxygen atom of Tyr-166 is about 3.5 Å away from the C4 atom of substrate, whereas the Cϵ atom of the imidazole ring of His-252 is in van der Waals contact with the C2 and C3 atoms of substrate, and its Nϵ atom forms a hydrogen bond to Tyr-166. These residues form part of a binding pocket illustrated in Fig. 3B. Interactions between substrate and protein at the catalytic site are outlined in Figs. 4 and 5A.Fig. 5Balls-and-sticks representation of the binding sites of substrate (A), FMN (B), and FAD (C). For clarity, only those residues that form hydrogen bonds with the ligand/cofactor are shown; those residues that form significant van der Waals interactions are discussed in the text. For simplicity, the diagram shows a flattened projection with water molecules removed. The figure was generated using LIGPLOT (34Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M.

The catalytic residue His-252 forms a hydrogen bond with the pantothenate region of the substrate, with the Nδ atom of the imidazole ring being 3.1 Å from the N4 atom of the pantothenate region. Three additional hydrogen bonds are formed between the protein and the pantothenate moiety of the substrate; a carbonyl backbone contact from His-252 to N8, the indole ring of Trp-577 to O9, and the guanido group of Arg-255 to O10, respectively. The ADP moiety of substrate is bound to a relatively basic region on the protein's surface, with the 3′-phosphate in close proximity to Arg-580 and Lys-566; the latter residue forms a salt bridge. However, the high B-factors (∼95 Å2) of the phosphate atoms suggest that this is a relatively weak association. The adenine ring is sandwiched between Pro-122 and Arg-255 and forms a hydrogen bond from the N6 atom to the guanido group of Arg-175, whereas the pyrophosphate linkage is exposed to solvent. The α-adenylic phosphate forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond to the O10 atom of the pantothenate chain. Glu-164 forms a hydrogen bond to the thioester carbonyl oxygen atom of the acyl chain, which may promote the positive character of the C5 atom of the acyl chain through resonance of the conjugated double bonds. FMN Binding Site—As seen in Fig. 1, the FMN cofactor is well buried within the protein's core. The si-face of the isoalloxazine ring is centered against the C3 atom of the acyl chain of substrate, with atoms C2 and C4 in van der Waals contact distance with the N10 (3.6 Å) and N5 (3.4 Å) atoms of FMN, respectively (Fig. 4). Met-25 is positioned on the opposing re-face of the isoalloxazine ring. Fig. 5B shows residues that interact with the FMN cofactor. Unlike TMDh in which the isoalloxazine ring of FMN is tethered to the polypeptide through a covalent bond between Cys-30 and the C6 atom of FMN, the FMN of DCR is not covalently attached to the enzyme; His-26 replaces the thiol residue of TMDh (Fig. 2). The ribityl chain forms hydrogen bonds with the guanidinium group of Arg-214 and the backbone carbonyl oxygen atom of Ser-24. The guanidinium group of Arg-214 also hydrogen bonds with the O2 atom of the isoalloxazine ring, as does the amide side chain of Gln-100. The N3 atom of the isoalloxazine ring forms a hydrogen bond to an amide group of Gln-100, and the O4 atom hydrogen bonds to the backbone nitrogen atom of Gly-58. Oxidized FMN is able to hydrogen bond to the backbone nitrogen atom of His-26 from the N5 atom of the isoalloxazine ring. The phosphate group is surrounded by backbone nitrogen atoms of Arg-288, Ala-310, and Arg-311. The guanido group of Arg-311 also forms hydrogen bonds to the phosphate. FAD Binding Site—Similar to FMN, the isoalloxazine ring of FAD is well buried; however, the ribityl and pyrophosphate moieties project to the protein surface such that the adenosine region is exposed to solvent (Fig. 1). The isoalloazine ring is positioned such that the two phenyl groups of Phe-412 and Phe-424 and the methyl side chain of Ala-415 are on its si-face, with the phenyl groups pointing edge-on to the plane of the isoalloxazine ring, and the nicotinamide and adjacent ribose ring of NADP(H) are on its re-face. There are no hydrogen bonds between protein or water molecules and the ribityl chain of FAD (Fig. 5C); however, the O3′ atom of the ribityl chain forms a hydrogen bond with the β-adenylic phosphate group in the pyrophosphate linkage. Both phosphate groups of the pyrophosphate linkage make several hydrogen bonds with backbone nitrogen atoms, Ala-384, Gln-411, and Gly-648, with the γ-amide side chain of Gln-411 also forming a hydrogen bond to the α-adenylic phosphate. Both hydroxyl groups of the adenosyl ribose ring form hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate of Asp-403, whereas the N1 and N6 atoms of the adenine ring form hydrogen bonds with backbone atoms of Val-448. NADP(H) Binding Site—Superimposition of the DCR structure with that of glutathione reductase shows that the middle and C-terminal domains of DCR resemble the N-terminal and middle domains of glutathione reductase (23Karplus P.A. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 701-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), having an r.m.s. deviation of 1.6 Å for ∼43% of Cα carbon atoms in the two domains of glutathione reductase. The superimposition shows both FAD and NADP(H) occupying spatially conserved sites. During the mid-stages of model building of DCR, there was sufficient electron density above the re-face of the FAD flavin moiety to allow NADP+ to be included in the model. Unfortunately, however, it was not possible to accurately position the nicotinamide ring because there was not enough electron density to unambiguously fit the ring. Subsequent rounds of refinement failed to improve density surrounding this part of the molecule, although the well-defined electron density of the adjacent ribose ring and the surrounding peptide limits positioning of the nicotinamide ring to a small area. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the A- or B-side of the nicotinamide ring interacts with the re-face of the FAD isoalloxazine ring. Electron Transfer Pathway— Fig. 4 shows the arrangement of cofactors and substrates found in the crystal structure. The relative positions of the electron source (NADPH) and the electron sink (substrate) suggest that electrons from NADPH must travel through FAD, 4Fe-4S, and FMN to reduce substrate. Inter-cofactor distances appear substantially short enough to allow rapid electron transfer, with the FAD to 4Fe-4S minimal distance being 8.6 Å between N3 of the isoalloxazine ring and the nearest iron atom, sufficiently below the 14 Å electron tunneling limit proposed by Page et al. (24Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar). The distance between the iron-su"

To elucidate the mechanism for CCR5 activation, this coreceptor was expressed in yeast coupled to the pheromone response pathway and a constitutively active mutant (CAM) was derived by random mutagenesis. Conversion of Thr-82 in the highly conserved TXP motif in transmembrane helix 2 to Pro, His, Tyr, Arg, or Lys conferred autonomous signaling activity in yeast and mammalian cells. This substitution also imparted constitutive signaling to CCR2 in yeast and mammalian cells, but not CCR1, CCR3, CCR4, CXCR2, or CXCR4. The CCR5-CAM, but not the CCR2-CAM had a reduction in ligand binding affinity. Whereas the amplitude of calcium mobilization induced by RANTES stimulation was lower in the CCR5-CAM than the wild-type (WT) receptor, MCP-1 induced a higher signal in the CCR2-CAM than in CCR2-WT. The chemotactic response of CCR5-CAM(T82P) to RANTES was similar to that of CCR5-WT, but CCR5-CAM(T82K) was dramatically decreased. The chemotactic response of CCR2-WT and CCR2-CAM(T94K) were similar. These findings extend insight into the role of the TXP motif in the mechanism for CCR5 signaling. CCR2, the receptor most closely genetically related to CCR5, shared a similar signaling mechanism, but other receptors containing the TXP motif did not. The expression of CCR5 and CCR2 in yeast and the availability of variants with autonomous signaling represent critical tools for characterizing receptor antagonists and developing approaches to block their role in human diseases.

Some envelope glycoproteins demonstrate weak CCR5 signaling and have low level replication, which can be augmented by activating CCR5 with physiologic ligands (24Arthos J. Rubbert A. Rabin R.L.

The mechanism for GPCR signaling has been shown to involve re-orientation of hydrophobic helices and consequent alteration in the conformation of the cytoplasmic domains (25Hubbell W.L. Cafiso D.S.

Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). The structural basis for the dynamic equilibrium between inactive and active conformations is best understood for rhodopsin. Although some insight into the mechanism for ligand binding has been developed, understanding of the mechanism for CCR5 activation is limited. Mutation of the Pro residue in a highly conserved sequence TXP in transmembrane domain (TM2) 2 of CCR5 has been shown to render the receptor refractory to conformational activation by ligand binding (27Govaerts C. Blanpain C. Deupi X. Ballet S. Ballesteros J.A. Wodak S.J. Vassart G. Pardo L. Parmentier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13217-13225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In order to gain insight we have functionally expressed human CCR5 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae coupled to the pheromone response pathway by a hybrid Gα subunit. CCR5 variants with autonomous signaling activity were selected using this system. A randomly generated constitutively active mutant (CAM) contained a conversion of Thr-82 to Pro in the TXP sequence in TM2. This CCR5 mutant also demonstrated constitutive signaling in mammalian cells. Analogous mutations conferred autonomous signaling to CCR2, but not CCR1, CCR3, or CCR4. The conformational shift in CCR5 induced by activating mutations in Thr-82 resulted in decreased binding affinity to its ligands, but the analogous substitution in CCR2 did not alter the binding of MCP-1. Exposure of the CCR5 and CCR2 CAMs to their respective ligands activated cytosolic mobilization of calcium ions. These findings provide insight into the mechanism for CCR5 and CCR2 activation and furnish valuable reagents for developing a new generation of antagonists. Strains, Cell Lines, and Plasmids—For expression in yeast open reading frame (ORF) of human CCR5 or other chemokine receptors, was cloned into the yeast expression vector Cp4258 and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CY12946 was transformed as described previously (28Zhang W.B. Navenot J.M. Haribabu B. Tamamura H. Hiramatu K. Omagari A. Pei G. Manfredi J.P. Fujii N. Broach J.R. Peiper S.C. J. Biol.

For mammalian expression, CHO cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-CCR5 or CCR2 constructs and single cell clones were derived by immunofluorescent sorting (MoFlo, Cytomation, Fort Collins, CO) with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 227R (ICOS, Bothell, WA) or anti-human CCR2 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), respectively. Recombinant RANTES Production—The ORF encoding the mature protein human RANTES was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pPICZαA shuttle vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using unique restriction sites, EcoRI and XbaI. Pichia Pastoris were transformed with the linearized vector by electroporation. Colonies with high level expression were selected on 1000 μg/ml Zeocin YPDS plates. The protein was targeted for secretion into the culture medium and purified to homogeneity by cation exchange HPLC using an UNO™ S1 column (Bio-Rad), followed by reversed phase HPLC using a MICROSORB-MV™ C4 column (VARIAN, Walnut Creek, CA). Construction and Screening of CCR5 Mutant Library—The CCR5 ORF was subjected to random mutagenesis by PCR in the presence of manganese resulting in a mutation rate of 0.1–0.3%. This mutant library was transformed into the histidine auxotrophic CY12946 yeast strain and functionally expressed upstream of the pheromone response pathway as previously described (28Zhang W.B. Navenot J.M. Haribabu B. Tamamura H. Hiramatu K. Omagari A. Pei G. Manfredi J.P. Fujii N. Broach J.R. Peiper S.C. J. Biol.

Autonomous CCR5 activation of FUS1-HIS3 reporter gene allows selection of these colonies on histidine deficient medium. Plasmid DNA from positive colonies was extracted, sequenced, and retransformed into yeast for further characterization. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange kit (Invitrogen). Yeast Receptor Activation Assay—Ligand-induced or autonomous receptor activation in yeast strains carrying a FUS1-HIS3 reporter gene was evaluated by growth on histidine-deficient medium. Receptor activation in yeast strains carrying a FUS1-lacZ gene was performed using a fluorescein di-β-d-galactopyranoside (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described previously (28Zhang W.B. Navenot J.M. Haribabu B. Tamamura H. Hiramatu K. Omagari A. Pei G. Manfredi J.P. Fujii N. Broach J.R. Peiper S.C. J. Biol.

The experimental data were normalized using β-galactosidase activity of nonstimulated wild-type (WT) CCR5. Ligand Binding and Displacement—CHO cells stably expressing CCR5 or CCR2 variants were incubated with 0.1 nm125I-MIP-1α or 125I-MCP-1 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) in the presence of incremental concentrations of RANTES (Leinco Tech., St. Louis, MO), MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and MCP-2 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) for CCR5, or MCP-1 (PeproTech) for CCR2 as described previously (21Navenot J.M. Wang Z.X. Trent J.O. Murray J.L. Hu Q.X. DeLeeuw L. Moore P.S. Chang Y. Peiper S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1181-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All binding experiments were conducted on ice to prevent ligand-induced receptor internalization. The affinity was calculated using Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) and is expressed as the EC50 ± S.D. averaged from the results obtained in three independent experiments and based on duplicate samples of each concentration. [35S]GTPγS Binding Assay—The [35S]GTPγS binding assay was carried out essentially as described (28Zhang W.B. Navenot J.M. Haribabu B. Tamamura H. Hiramatu K. Omagari A. Pei G. Manfredi J.P. Fujii N.

Briefly, 7 μg of cell membranes were preincubated with 40 μm GDP (Sigma) in the absence (basal binding) or presence of an agonmist for 30 min at 30 °C before addition of [35S]GTPγS (Amersham Biosciences) to a final concentration of 0.25 nm. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm GTPγS (Sigma). After incubating for another 30 min, reactions were terminated by rapid filtration through GF/C filters (Whatman Inc., Clifton, NJ). Bound radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Cells were treated with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) for 14–16 h to uncouple the Gi/oα from the receptors. The percentage of specific binding was calculated as 100 × (sample cpm – nonspecific cpm) ÷ (basal cpm – nonspecific cpm). The values are the means ± S.E. of triplicate samples, and the results are representative of four independent experiments. Calcium Mobilization—CHO cells were loaded with 2 μg/ml fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes). Agonist-dependent increases in cytoplasmic calcium were determined as described (21Navenot J.M. Wang Z.X. Trent J.O. Murray J.L. Hu Q.X. DeLeeuw L. Moore P.S. Chang Y. Peiper S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1181-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The results are representative of two independent experiments. Chemotaxis Assay—Cells were resuspended in MEMα medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. The cell density was adjusted to 2 × 106 cells/ml and 100 μl was added to the top chamber of 24-well transwell apparatus (6.5-mm diameter, 8.0-μm pore size; Corning Inc., Corning, NY). Agonist was added to the lower chamber. The plates were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells that passed through membranes into the lower chamber were collected and counted by flow cytometry. The chemotactic index was determined as a ratio of cells in lower chamber in the presence versus in the absence of agonist. The results are representative of three independent experiments. Derivation of CCR5 CAMs in Yeast—CCR5 was expressed in yeast coupled to the pheromone response pathway by a hybrid Gα subunit, as previously described for CXCR4 (28Zhang W.B. Navenot J.M. Haribabu B. Tamamura H. Hiramatu K. Omagari A. Pei G. Manfredi J.P. Fujii N. Broach J.R. Peiper S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24515-24521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Histidine auxotrophic yeast strains expressing human CCR5 and a pheromone-responsive FUS1-HIS3 reporter gene grew in the absence of histidine when exposed to RANTES (Fig. 1A), demonstrating that the receptor was functional and linked to the pheromone response pathway. High concentrations of RANTES were required to activate CCR5 signaling in yeast, but chemokines that do not bind CCR5 had no effect at any concentration (data not shown). Control cells (Fig. 1A) and yeast strains expressing CXCR4 (data not shown) were not stimulated to grow in the absence of histidine when exposed to RANTES, establishing the specificity of the system. This was confirmed by the ability of RANTES to activate human CCR5 in parallel experiments in yeast strains containing a FUS1-lacZ reporter gene, resulting in expression of β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 2A, see inset).Fig. 2Characterization of CCR5 signaling variants in yeast and mammalian cells. A, analysis of FUS1-lacZ reporter gene in yeast indicated that T82P and T82K mutations conferred constitutive activity while T82G had an inhibitory effect on RANTES-induced CCR5 signaling (-▪- CCR5; -▴- T82P; -·- T82K; -·- T82G; -×- Cp4258). Inset shows the response of CCR5-WT to incremental doses of RANTES, but the absence of effect on the control strain transformed with vector alone. B, expression level of CCR5 mutants in CHO cells was determined by flow cytometry with 227R mAb. Staining with irrelevant IgG1 antibody was used as a negative control. C, [35S]GTPγS binding of CCR5 mutants in CHO cells showed increased association of Gα subunits with T82P and T82K mutants, but not the T82G mutant, in the absence of agonist. The results are representative of four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In order to derive CCR5-CAMs, the CCR5 ORF was randomly mutated by PCR in the presence of manganese at a mutational rate of 0.1–0.3% and these cDNA pools were screened for the ability to confer histidine-independent growth in the histidine auxotrophic yeast strain containing the FUS1-HIS3 reporter gene. Screening of over 105 recombinant events for growth in the absence of histidine and CCR5 ligands yielded three clones with an A to C substitution resulting in the T82P mutation. No other activating mutation was identified among 18 autonomously growing clones that were sequenced. Yeast cells expressing CCR5(T82P) grew in histidine free medium in the absence of RANTES and this was not significantly altered by the addition of this ligand, as shown in Fig. 1B. The proliferation of cells expressing the CCR5-CAM without ligand stimulation was greater than that of those expressing CCR5-WT grown in the presence of 1 μm RANTES. Cells expressing CCR5-WT did not grow in the absence of RANTES. The specificity of WT receptor and CCR5-CAM coupling to pheromone response pathway was confirmed by inhibition of yeast proliferation with 3-amino-1, 2,4-triazole, a competitive inhibitor of histidine production (data not shown). Amino acid substitutions that confer CCR5 autonomous signaling were determined by saturation mutagenesis of Thr-82. As shown in Fig. 1C, substitution of Thr-82 with Lys or Arg resulted in high levels of basal β-galactosidase expression in yeast cells containing the FUS1-lacZ reporter gene. Conversion of Thr-82 to His, Tyr, or Pro, but not Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Met, Trp, Asp, or Glu, resulted in CAM activity, albeit at lower levels. Exposure of CAMs to RANTES did not result in additional activation of receptor signaling. Activation of β-galactosidase expression in yeast cells expressing CCR5(T82K) or CCR5(T82P) was not significantly altered by exposure to RANTES at concentrations up to 10 μm (Fig. 2A). CCR5 CAMs Selected in Yeast Are Active in Mammalian Cells—The authenticity of the activated conformation of the CCR5-CAMs selected in yeast was determined by analysis of signaling in mammalian cells. CHO transfectants expressing CCR5-WT or the T82P, T82K, or T82G mutants were prepared by lipofection and cell sorting. Staining of the transfectants with 227R, a mAb to the N-terminal extracellular domain of CCR5, revealed that all were expressed on the surface of CHO cells at similar levels, as shown in Fig. 2B. The autonomous signaling activity of the CCR5-CAMs was determined in [35S]GTPγS binding experiments (Fig. 2C). This response was inhibited by pertussis toxin (data not shown). Membrane fractions from CHO transfectants expressing CCR5(T82P) or CCR5(T82K) have basal levels of [35S]GTPγS binding that were ∼2–3-fold higher than that of transfectants expressing the WT receptor or CCR5(T82G). Exposure to incremental concentrations of RANTES demonstrated that CCR5(T82P) was more sensitive to ligand activation than the WT receptor and the other CCR5 mutants in some experiments (Fig. 2C). The Role of TXP in Autonomous Signaling is Common to CCR5 and CCR2—Since the TXP sequence in TM2 is highly conserved in receptors for C-C and C-X-C chemokines, the analogous Thr residue in other C-C receptors was substituted with Pro or Lys to determine whether it conferred autonomous signaling. As shown in Fig. 3A, introduction of Thr → Pro or Thr → Lys conversions in CCR1, CCR3, and CCR4 had no effect on the expression of β-galactosidase activity in yeast cells containing a FUS1-lacZ reporter gene. In contrast, yeast cells containing CCR2(T94K), but not CCR2(T94P) demonstrated elevated basal levels of β-galactosidase activity. CCR2(T94K) was expressed in CHO transfectants to establish that the conformation induced by this mutation also conferred autonomous coupling to G proteins in mammalian cells. Transfectants expressing CCR2-WT or the T94K mutation were prepared by lipofection and cell sorting. The respective tranfectants expressed CCR2-WT and CCR2(T94K) at similar levels on the cell surface, as shown in Fig. 3B. The authenticity of the signaling phenotype of the CCR2-CAM was determined in [35S]GTPγS binding experiments. This response was inhibited by pertussis toxin (data not shown). Membrane fractions from transfectants expressing CCR2(T94K) had a 30–40% higher basal level of [35S]GTPγS binding than those from transfectants expressing CCR2-WT. Levels of [35S]GTPγS binding induced by stimulation of CCR2(T94K) transfectants with incremental concentrations of MCP-1 were ∼2-fold higher than that observed in transfectants expressing CCR2-WT, including the maximum level of activation. Conformational Changes in Extracellular Domains of CCR5, but not CCR2, CAMs—Ligand binding experiments were performed to determine whether the altered orientation of transmembrane helices induced by the activating mutations influences the conformation of extracellular domains. To minimize the effect of receptor internalization induced by the ligands, the experiments were conducted at 0 °C. The binding of 125I-MIP-1α by CCR5 mutants was characterized in homologous and heterologous displacement experiments. The EC50 of MIP-1α binding to CCR5(T82P) (0.9 nm) was identical to that of the WT receptor in homologous displacement experiments (Fig. 4A). In contrast, parallel experiments demonstrated that the binding of CCR5(T82K) to 125I-MIP-1α (17.2 nm) was dramatically decreased. The EC50 of MIP-1α binding to CCR5(T82G) (3.2 nm) was intermediate between that observed with CCR5-WT/CCR5(T82P) and CCR5(T82K). Heterologous displacement of 125I-MIP-1α binding to these CCR5 variants by RANTES is shown in Fig. 4B. CCR5(T82P) and CCR5(T82G) demonstrated a decrease in the affinity of RANTES displacement in comparison to the WT receptor (EC50 = 2.6 nm and 2.1 nm versus 0.4 nm, respectively). The loss of affinity of CCR5(T82K) for RANTES was even more pronounced (51.6 nm) than observed for MIP-1α. The results for the displacement of 125I-MIP-1α by MIP-1β illustrate a similar trend with MIP-1β having the highest affinity for CCR5-WT (3.9 nm) and the lowest for CCR5(T82K) (20.7 nm), even though in that case the difference was only about 5-fold (Fig. 4C). When MCP-2 was used to displace 125I-MIP-1α, its binding to CCR5(T82G) was similar to CCR5-WT (6.3 nm versus 4.0 nm). In contrast CCR5(T82P) showed about 3-fold decrease of affinity for this ligand. The T82K mutation resulted in an almost complete loss of binding of MCP-2 (ab"

Previous work (Kalinec, F., Zhang, M., Urrutia, R., and Kalinec, G. (2000) J. Biol.

Cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) 1The abbreviations used are: OHCs, outer hair cells; ACh, acetylcholine; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; dn, dominant-negative.1The abbreviations used are: OHCs, outer hair cells; ACh, acetylcholine; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; dn, dominant-negative. undergo reversible changes in length when electrically stimulated. This electromotile response results from a membrane-based force generator mechanism associated with conformational changes and rearrangement of a voltage-sensitive integral membrane protein (1Kalinec F. Holley M.C. Iwasa K. Lim D.J. Kachar B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8671-8675Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The OHC motor protein has been recently identified as a novel anion transporter (SLC26A5-prestin) (2Zheng J. Shen W. He D.Z.Z. Long K.B. Madison L.D. Dallos P. Nature. 2000; 405: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar), with voltage sensitivity conferred by the intracellular anions chloride and bicarbonate (Ref. 3Oliver D. He D.Z.Z. Klöcker N.

The vectorial component to the forces generated in the OHC plasma membrane is provided by the cortical cytoskeleton, an actin-spectrin meshwork placed immediately underneath the plasma membrane and connected to it through thousands of 25-nm-long rod-like structures (pillars) (5Holley M.C. Kalinec F. Kachar B. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 569-580PubMed Google Scholar, 6Holley M.C. Dallos P. Popper A.N. Fay R.R. The Cochlea. Vol. 8. Springer-Verlag Inc., New, York1996: 386-434Google Scholar). It has been recently demonstrated that OHC electromotility is necessary for the correct work of the cochlear amplifier, the active process that enhances sensitivity and frequency discrimination of the mammalian ear (7Liberman M.C. Gao J. He D.Z.Z. Wu X. Jia S. Zuo J. Nature. 2002; 419: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Cochlear amplification is maximal at low signal levels (∼0–5-db sound pressure level), decreases proportionally to increases in signal intensity, and becomes inhibited at sounds of ∼80 db (4Dallos P. Fakler B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 8Ruggero M.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1992; 2: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This “automatic gain control” is crucial for extending the dynamic range of the auditory system because it provides the cochlea with the ability to amplify very faint sounds and to process the loudest without suffering permanent damage (9Patuzzi R. Dallos P. Popper A.N. Fay R.R. The Cochlea. Vol. 8. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New, York1996: 186-257Google Scholar). The direct association between cochlear amplification and OHC electromotility suggests that this gain control may be provided by the modulation of the OHC electromotile response. OHCs must undergo continuous mechanical changes to optimize the sensitivity and frequency selectivity of the cochlea (10Murugasu E. Russell I.J. Audit. Neurosci. 1995; 1: 139-150Google Scholar, 11Russell I.J. Cody A.R. Richardson G.P. Hear. Res. 1986; 22: 199-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 12Russell I.J. Kossl M. J. Physiol.

We used the term “mechanical homeostasis” for the process of constant adjustment of control parameters that automatically bring OHCs near the optimal working point for each condition. However, the cochlea may be challenged by variations of 12 orders of magnitude in sound intensity in fractions of 1 s. Therefore, in addition to the homeostatic mechanism of continued regulation, OHCs may require a “reset” switch for fast inhibition of signal amplification to protect the cochlea from sudden bursts of high intensity noise. Although little is known about the nature of the homeostatic control, a strong inhibitory effect on the gain of the cochlear amplifier has been associated with acetylcholine (ACh) released by efferent terminals innervating OHCs (14Murugasu E.

Recent experimental evidence suggests a role for Rho GTPases in the regulation of OHC electromotility (16Kalinec F. Zhang M. Urrutia R. Kalinec G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28000-28005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms controlled by these enzymes remain to be determined. We have focused our attention on RhoA and its downstream targets ROCK, known to regulate dynamic reorganization of cytoskeletal proteins (17Amano M. Fukata Y. Kaibuchi K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), and adducin, a cytoskeletal protein that promotes actin-spectrin binding and that caps the fast-growing ends of actin filaments (18Matsuoka Y.

Chem. 1999; 82: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the cellular mechanism of homeostatic control of OHC electromotility involves Rho-mediated cytoskeletal changes without affecting the prestin motors. In addition, we demonstrate that the molecular machinery underlying this phenomenon requires the activation of ROCK-dependent and ROCK-independent pathways. These results extend our understanding of the mechanisms by which Rho GTPases regulate OHC electromotility, reveal a key role for the cytoskeleton in this phenomenon, and suggest that ROCK may serve as a molecular target for modulating the function of the cochlear amplifier. Immunolabeling—Guinea pigs (200–300 g) were euthanized following the procedures and protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For plastic sections, guinea pig cochleae were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA), decalcified in 8% EDTA for 4 weeks, and embedded in celloidin following standard procedures. Sections were labeled with biotinylated secondary antibodies that react with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin molecules (Dako LSAB+System AP, Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA). For confocal observation, whole-mount preparations and isolated OHCs were processed as described previously (16Kalinec F. Zhang M. Urrutia R. Kalinec G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28000-28005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Anti-ROCK I (C-19), anti-ROCK II (C-20), anti-α-adducin (C-15), anti-phospho-Thr445 adducin, and anti-phospho-Ser726 adducin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were used as primary antibodies. Blocking peptides were used in pre-adsorption (negative control) experiments. Samples were observed with Zeiss Axiovert 135 and LSM-410 laser confocal microscopes with a ×40 C-Apo (numerical aperature of 1.2) objective. Western Blotting—For Western blot analyses, total cell homogenates from guinea pig cochlea, lung, and brain were homogenized and lysed in 50 mm Tris buffer solution (pH 7.4) containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm vanadate, 0.1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (10 μl/ml), and 10 mg/ml aprotinin (3 μl/ml). Samples were then mixed with loading buffer (0.04 g of SDS, 0.002 g of bromphenol blue, 1 ml of β-mercaptoethanol, 4 g of sucrose, and 10 ml of stacking buffer (all from Sigma)), boiled for 5 min and centrifuged. The supernatant was stored at –20 °C. Cochlear and positive control samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (30 μg of protein/lane), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with the primary antibodies. The reaction was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using a peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). Competition studies were performed with the antibodies and blocking peptides mentioned above. Adducin Phosphorylation—Guinea pig cochleae (n = 18) were opened in Leibovitz L-15 medium (Invitrogen), and the spiral was exposed by removing the bony shell. Six samples were preincubated for 30 min with the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (10 μm; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), which is known to be incorporated into cells by carrier-mediated facilitated diffusion (20Ishizaki T. Uehata M. Tamechika I. Keel J. Nonomura K. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 976-983PubMed Google Scholar). Next, ACh (Sigma) was added to six samples (three preincubated with Y-27632 and three untreated) at a final concentration of 100 μm. Simultaneously, LPA (Sigma) was added to six other samples (three preincubated with Y-27632 and three untreated) at a final concentration of 10 μm. After 10 min, all of the treated samples plus the six without any treatment (controls) were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde and labeled as described above using either anti-phospho-Thr445 adducin or anti-phospho-Ser726 adducin as the primary antibody. In similar experiments, additional guinea pig cochleae were incubated with ACh and LPA for periods of 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 min. Electromotility Measurements—OHCs were isolated by microdissection, suspended in Leibovitz L-15 medium in a perfusion chamber on an Axiovert 135 inverted microscope stage, and patch-clamped as previously described (16Kalinec F. Zhang M. Urrutia R. Kalinec G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28000-28005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes were filled with internal perfusion buffer (120 mm KF, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgATP, 0.1 mm NaGTP, and 10 mm HEPES) adjusted with Trizma (Tris base) to pH 7.4 (control) or with internal perfusion buffer plus glutathione S-transferase (100 μg/ml; Calbiochem), C3 (100 μg/ml; Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO), Y-27632 (10 μm), and dominant-negative (dn) Rac1 and dnCdc42 (100 μg/ml; kindly provided by Dr. J. Silvio Gutkind, NIDCR, National Institutes of Health) or combinations of these compounds at identical concentrations. After being patch-clamped, cells were permitted to stabilize under their new mechanical conditions for 8–10 min. In those experiments not involving ACh, cells were electrically stimulated with bursts of three depolarization (+50 mV)/hyperpolarization (–145 mV) cycles (3 Hz) to elicit electromotility. The cell response was recorded on videotape and analyzed off line. In those experiments involving ACh, Leibovitz L-15 medium (negative control) and ACh (100 μm) were delivered to the basolateral wall of the cells (∼0.15 μl/s) using a computer-controlled perfusion system (DAD-12, ALA Scientific Instruments, Westbury, NY) as previously described (16Kalinec F. Zhang M. Urrutia R. Kalinec G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28000-28005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The electrical and structural integrity of every OHC was continuously evaluated through the whole experiment. The osmolarity of every solution used in these experiments was controlled and adjusted with glucose to 300 ± 2 mosmol with a μOsmette 5004 freezing-point osmometer (Precision Systems Inc., Natick, MA). Experiments were fully recorded on videotape and analyzed off line. Changes in electromotile amplitude were measured with a resolution better than 0.1 μm as described (21Frolenkov G.I. Kalinec F. Tavartkiladze G.A. Kachar B. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1665-1672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A total of 245 cells were included in the experiments. Nonlinear Capacitance Measurements—Membrane capacitance was evaluated during electromotility experiments and before and after ACh perfusion. We followed the transient analysis of currents protocol originally developed by Santos-Sacchi (22Santos-Sacchi J. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3096-3110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, OHCs were electrically stimulated with 15-mV stair steps from a holding potential of –145 to +50 mV. Capacitance function was fitted to the first derivative of a two-state Boltzmann function relating nonlinear charge to membrane voltage (23Santos-Sacchi J. Kakehata S. Takahashi S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 510: 225-235Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Because membrane stress may affect capacitance measurements, special care was taken to diminish potential effects of uncontrolled intracellular pressure changes during evaluation of capacitance and electromotility. Data were statistically analyzed by analysis of variance techniques using StatView Version 4.1 and SuperAnova (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA). Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. Expression of ROCK and Adducin in the Guinea Pig Cochlea—There are two closely related isoforms of ROCK, ROCK I (p160ROCK and ROK-β) and ROCK II (Rho kinase, Rho-associated kinase, and ROK-α) (17Amano M. Fukata Y. Kaibuchi K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). ROCK I is expressed at high levels in heart, kidney, skeletal muscle, pancreas, lung, and liver, but it is nearly absent in brain. In contrast, ROCK II is abundantly expressed in brain and weakly in lung (17Amano M. Fukata Y. Kaibuchi K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that both isoforms are expressed in the guinea pig cochlea at levels that appear to be higher for ROCK I than for ROCK II (Fig. 1). Confocal microscopy of isolated cells demonstrated that both ROCK I and ROCK II immunolocalize primarily at the OHC cortex (Fig. 2). This localization is consistent with the previously reported distribution of RhoA in these cells (16Kalinec F. Zhang M. Urrutia R. Kalinec G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28000-28005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Antibodies against α-adducin, a marker for the actin-spectrin cytoskeleton and a target of ROCK, showed that this protein is also expressed in guinea pig cochlea (Fig. 1) and labeled OHCs with a pattern similar to that of ROCK I and ROCK II (Fig. 2). Thus, these results suggest that, similar to their upstream activator and downstream target, ROCK kinases localize primarily either immediately adjacent to or at the areas involved in OHC electromotility.Fig. 2Immunolocalization of ROCK I, ROCK II, and α-adducin in guinea pig cochlea. Labeling of plastic-embedded guinea pig cochleae with anti-ROCK I (a), anti-ROCK II (b), and anti-adducin (c) antibodies suggested abundant expression of these proteins in OHCs (arrows). Confocal images of isolated OHCs (d–f) indicated that ROCK I, ROCK II, and adducin localized primarily at the cell cortex. As negative controls, isolated OHCs were incubated with antibodies preadsorbed with their corresponding blocking peptides (g–i). Scale bars = 50 μm (a–c) and 10 μm (d–i).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Homeostatic Regulation of OHC Electromotility—Given the abundant expression of ROCK in OHCs, we hypothesized that ROCK inhibition might result in changes in the mechanical properties of these cells and consequently in their electromotile response. To test this hypothesis, we inhibited the function of ROCK and RhoA in isolated OHCs using either pharmacological or molecular approaches and investigated their effect on cell electromotility. To inhibit RhoA-mediated signaling pathways, we used C3 exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum, which ADP-ribosylates RhoA (but not Rac and Cdc42) at Asn41, thereby blocking RhoA-mediated signals (24Aktories K. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 282-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). ROCK activity was controlled with the synthetic compound Y-27632, which inhibits both ROCK I and ROCK II with high specificity by competing with ATP for binding to the kinases (20Ishizaki T. Uehata M. Tamechika I. Keel J. Nonomura K. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 976-983PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated the electromotile response of OHCs to different concentrations of either C3 or Y-27632 (Fig. 3). Both C3 and Y-27632 affected the electromotile response of isolated guinea pig OHCs. For instance, Fig. 3 (upper panel) shows that OHC electromotile amplitude decreased progressively up to 70% of the control value (70.7 ± 5.7%; p ≤ 0.01) as the C3 concentration was increased up to 100 μg/ml. In contrast, 100 μm Y-27632 decreased electromotile amplitude up to 30% of the control value (31.1 ± 11.4%; p ≤ 0.001) (Fig. 3, lower panel). However, cells receiving 100 μm Y-27632 showed signals of deterioration and yielded more variable results (Fig. 3, lower panel). The cellular damage observed in this experiment likely reflects a toxic effect of the drug rather than the pharmacological effect that is usually observed at lower concentrations. Therefore, we used concentrations of 100 μg/ml for C3 and 10 μm for Y-27632 in all subsequent experiments. To address whether C3 and Y-27632 work cooperatively and/or synergistically, we subsequently measured electromotile amplitude in OHCs co-perfused with these two compounds. Fig. 4a shows that whereas the electromotile amplitude of untreated (control) cells was 3.5 ± 0.1% of the total cell length in these experiments, C3 (100 μg/ml) and Y-27632 (10 μm) decreased it to 2.6 ± 0.2% (p ≤ 0.01) and 2.7 ± 0.2% (p ≤ 0.01), respectively. Co-perfusion of C3 and Y-27632 decreased electromotile amplitude to 2.8 ± 0.2%, a value that was not significantly different from that observed with either C3 or Y-27632 alone (Fig. 4a). These results suggest that RhoA and ROCK work “in series” and that a RhoA/ROCK-mediated signaling cascade might be antagonizing a parallel pathway that decreases OHC electromotility. To investigate whether these results might be associated with the existence of a parallel pathway mediated by other small GTPases, we used previously characterized dominant-negative constructs of Rac1 (dnRac1) and Cdc42 (dnCdc42) (16Kalinec F. Zhang M. Urrutia R. Kalinec G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28000-28005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4b, electromotile amplitude did not change when OHCs were co-perfused with dnRac1 + C3 or dnRac1 + C3 + Y-27632. In contrast, replacement of dnRac1 with dnCdc42 resulted in a significant reduction in OHC electromotile amplitude. Although these results appear to suggest a role for Cdc42 in the electromotile response of OHCs, Fig. 4 (compare a and b) provides a different interpretation. Co-perfusion with dnRac1 indeed abolished the effect of C3 and C3 + Y-27632, returning the amplitude of the OHC electromotile response to control values (from 2.6 ± 0.2 to 3.4 ± 0.1% for C3 (p ≤ 0.01) and from 2.7 ± 0.2 to 3.6 ± 0.2% for C3 + Y-27632 (p ≤ 0.01)). In contrast, dnCdc42 did not significantly change the response of OHCs to C3 or C3 + Y-27632 (from 2.6 ± 0.2 to 3.0 ± 0.1% and from 2.8 ± 0.2 to 2.6 ± 0.2%, respectively). These results indicate that Rac1 (but not Cdc42) might be associated with the pathway antagonized by the RhoA/ROCK-mediated signaling cascade. ACh-activated Signaling Pathway—Subsequently, we asked whether the RhoA/ROCK-mediated pathway could be the same ACh-activated pathway previously reported as regulating OHC electromotility (16Kalinec F. Zhang M. Urrutia R. Kalinec G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28000-28005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We found that external stimulation with ACh did not change the electromotile response of isolated OHCs internally perfused with C3. Whereas C3 alone decreased electromotile amplitude from 3.5 to 2.6% of the total cell length, ACh stimulation left the amplitude statistically unchanged (2.5 ± 0.1%) (Fig. 5). In contrast, the electromotile amplitude of OHCs internally perfused with the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 was increased ∼22% by ACh, bringing the response back to control values (from 2.7 ± 0.2 to 3.4 ± 0.1% of the total cell length; p ≤ 0.025). Importantly, this ACh-induced significant increase was abolished by co-perfusion of Y-27632 and C3 (2.7 ± 0.2) (Fig. 5). Altogether, these results suggest that the signaling cascade activated by ACh would be mediated by RhoA, but not by ROCK. Therefore, it would not be the same pathway involved in the homeostatic control of OHC electromotility. Next, we wondered whether adducin could help us to confirm that the ACh-activated pathway is indeed ROCK-independent. It has been suggested that phosphorylation of adducin by ROCK at Thr445 (phospho-Thr445 adducin) facilitates the recruitment of spectrin to F-actin and promotes the assembly of the actin-spectrin cytoskeleton beneath the plasma membrane (25Fukata Y. Oshiro N. Kinoshita N. Kawano Y. Matsuoka Y. Bennett V. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). On the other hand, protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of adducin at Ser726 (phospho-Ser726 adducin) would inhibit the recruitment of spectrin to F-actin, inducing the disassembly of the actin-spectrin meshwork (25Fukata Y. Oshiro N. Kinoshita N. Kawano Y. Matsuoka Y. Bennett V. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Using antibodies that label phosphorylated forms of this protein, we found a pool of both phospho-Thr445 adducin and phospho-Ser726 adducin in untreated isolated OHCs (Fig. 6, a and b). Importantly, preincubation of guinea pig cochleae with Y-27632 for 30 min inhibited adducin phosphorylation at both Thr445 and Ser726 (Fig. 6, c and d). To investigate whether adducin is involved in the ACh-activated pathway, guinea pig cochleae were incubated with ACh for 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 min, fixed, and labeled with anti-phospho-Thr445 adducin and anti-phospho-Ser726 adducin antibodies. We found that ACh did not significantly increase the amount of labeled adducin (Fig. 6, e–h), confirming that ACh activates a ROCK-independent pathway. As a positive control, we replaced ACh with LPA. LPA activates a signaling pathway involving Gα13, RhoGEF-115, and RhoA (34Neves, S., Ram, P., and Iyengar, R. (2002) Science's STKE http://stke.sciencemag.org/cqi/CM/CMP_8809.Google Scholar). Subsequently, RhoA activates ROCK and protein kinase C, resulting in the phosphorylation of adducin at Ser726 (via protein kinase C) and at Thr445 and Thr480 (via ROCK). In contrast to ACh, just 2 min of incubation with LPA was enough to greatly increase the amount of phospho-Thr445 adducin and phospho-Ser726 adducin (Fig. 6, i and j), and both LPA-induced responses were abolished by preincubation with Y-27632 (Fig. 6, k and l). Interestingly, we found stronger labeling of phospho-Thr445 adducin in the hair bundle than in the OHC body (Fig. 6a, inset). In contrast, labeling of phospho-Ser726 adducin was homogeneous (Fig. 6b). Because the actin-spectrin cytoskeleton is not a major component of the OHC hair bundle, these results suggest that adducin might be functioning there as an actin-capping protein (18Matsuoka Y. Li X. Bennet V. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 884-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), modulating the renewal of actin in the stereocilia (26Schneider M.E. Belyantseva I.A. Azevedo R.B. Kachar B. Nature. 2002; 418: 837Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Regulation of OHC Electromotility Is a Prestin-independent Process—Finally, we measured voltage-dependent nonlinear capacitance (Cm) in isolated OHCs to explore whether the observed variations in electromotile amplitude could be associated with changes in the performance of prestin. Cm results from the movement of electrical charges across the plasma membrane associated with conformational changes in the motor proteins (4Dallos P. Fakler B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In addition, a positional shift of the voltage peak value (V pk Cm) indicates the existence of indirect effects (i.e. changes in cell turgor) that modify the operating point of the motors (27Kakehata S. Santos-Sacchi J. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 2190-2197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 28Wu M. Santos-Sacchi J. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 166: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 29Takahashi S. Santos-Sacchi J. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 169: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 30Takahashi S. Santos-Sacchi J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; 441: 506-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In a first series of experiments, we found that up to 30 min of incubation of isolated OHCs with Y-27632 did not induce significant changes in either Cm or V pk Cm (data not shown). Next, we measured Cm before and after external stimulation with ACh (Fig. 7). In agreement with a recent report by Frolenkov et al. (31Frolenkov G.I. Mammano F. Belyantseva I.A. Coling D. Kachar B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5940-5948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we did not detect any significant effect of ACh on untreated OHCs (Fig. 4b). Similar results were obtained in OHCs internally perfused with Y-27632 despite the significant increase in electromotile amplitude induced by ACh in these cells (Fig. 7c). Thus, we conclude that neither the pathways involved in mechanical homeostasis nor the one activated by ACh affects the performance of the motor proteins in a direct manner. An indirect effect on prestin mediated by changes in OHC turgor is also unlikely because we did not observe any shift in V pk Cm (Fig. 7, b and c). Because cell turgor is sensitive to ion flux and to changes in surface potential and membrane tension, a side effect of the treatment on these parameters may also be ruled out. In this study, we have provided evidence emphasizing the importance of prestin-independent processes in the control of OHC electromotility. We defined pathways that link distinct Rho GTPases to the remodeling of the OHC cytoskeleton. A ROCK-dependent pathway would be continuously adjusting the electromotile response of the OHC to optimize the sensitivity and frequency selectivity of the cochlea. A ROCK-independent pathway (activated by ACh) functions as a reset system to bypass the homeostatic mechanism and returns the cell to a mechanical equilibrium. These findings are integrated in the tentative model illustrated in Fig. 8. This model predicts that the gain of the OHC electromotile response is controlled by the RhoA/ROCK-regulated inhibition of a potent, constitutively active, amplitude-decreasing signaling cascade mediated by Rac1. On the other hand, the complete inhibition of the Rac1-mediated pathway would result in the largest electromotile response compatible with both the structural and functional parameters of the force generator mechanism and the mechanical load working on the system. This safety feature minimizes the risk of stereocilium damage and deafness associated with an uncontrolled increase in electromotile amplitude, thus protecting the auditory system against acoustic trauma. OHC Mechanical Homeostasis—The cochlear amplifier increases the dynamic range of the cochlea by enhancing the vibration of the basilar membrane. Continuous operation (responding and adapting to a fluctuating input) demands a feedback mechanism for automatic (homeostatic) control (10Murugasu E. Russell I.J. Audit. Neurosci. 1995; 1: 139-150Google Scholar, 11Russell I.J. Cody A.R. Richardson G.P. Hear. Res. 1986; 22: 199-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 12Russell I.J. Kossl M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 435: 493-511Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Russell I.J. Kossl M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1992; 336: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Demonstration that OHC electromotility is necessary to explain cochlear amplification (7Liberman M.C. Gao J. He D.Z.Z. Wu X. Jia S. Zuo J. Nature. 2002; 419: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) leads naturally to the association of homeostatic regulation of the cochlear amplifier with the parallel homeostatic regulation of the OHC electromotile response. The results summarized in Figs. 3 and 4a clearly indicate that C3 and Y-27632 (inhibitors of RhoA and ROCK, respectively) modify the electromotile response of untreated isolated OHCs. Note that the C3 and Y-27632 dose-response curves do not show a clear saturation in their effect on the OHC electromotile response (Fig. 3). Inhibition achieved with higher doses of these agents may be unreliable, however, as suggested by the toxic effect of 100 μm Y-27632 described above. Nonetheless, inhibition of ∼40% of OHC electromotility such as reported here significantly supports the participation of RhoA and ROCK in the regulation of this phenomenon. Because C3 and Y-27632 (used either alone or jointly) decreased OHC electromotile amplitude, we hypothesized that this effect could be mediated by the inhibition of a RhoA/ROCK-mediated signaling cascade regulating an amplitude-decreasing pathway (Fig. 8). The experiments with dnRac1 and dnCdc42 described in Fig. 4b support this hypothesis and suggest that this amplitude-decreasing pathway would be mediated by Rac1, but not Cdc42. What could be the structural target for these signaling pathways mediated by members of the Rho family of small GTPases that control OHC electromotility? Three potential molecular mechanisms may be envisioned. First, Rho-mediated signals could be directly targeting the membrane-embedded molecular motors. The conformational changes in the individual motor molecules or the number of them participating in the response, for instance, could be selectively altered. Second, Rho-mediated signals could be inducing cytoskeletal changes that modify the OHC mechanical response only by changing the mechanical load on the molecular motors. Finally, these potential Rho-mediated cytoskeletal changes could be influencing the performance of the membrane-embedded motors either directly or indirectly through changes in other parameters such as membrane tension. Our measurements of voltage-dependent nonlinear membrane capacitance, both during homeostatic regulation and when activated by ACh, clearly implicate the cytoskeleton as the only target for the RhoA-mediated signaling cascade. These results also suggest that a significant indirect effect on the performance of the membrane-embedded molecular motors (mediated by changes in membrane tension or ion flux, for instance) is unlikely. Adducin experiments provided indirect support to the hypothesis that the cytoskeleton is the essential structure involved in the homeostatic regulation of OHC electromotility. ROCK activation by RhoA induces phospho-Thr445 adducin and phospho-Thr480 adducin, promoting the recruitment of spectrin to actin filaments, the formation of the actin-spectrin cytoskeleton, and its connection to the plasma membrane via ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin-protein family) proteins (25Fukata Y. Oshiro N. Kinoshita N. Kawano Y. Matsuoka Y. Bennett V. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In contrast, protein kinases C and A inhibit this activity and induce the disassembly of the actin-spectrin cytoskeleton by generating phospho-Ser726 adducin (18Matsuoka Y. Li X. Bennet V. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 884-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 32Matsuoka Y. Li X. Bennet V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 485-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The finding in untreated OHCs of phospho-Thr445 adducin and phospho-Ser726 adducin suggests that the OHC cortical cytoskeleton is dynamically regulated, with continuous assembly and disassembly of the actin-spectrin meshwork. Together, the experiments reported here indicate that the activation of a RhoA/ROCK-mediated pathway induces both adducin phosphorylation and regulation of OHC electromotility. These data also suggest that future research aimed at defining the role of adducin and adducin-associated proteins in the biology of OHCs will contribute significantly to the better understanding of OHC electromotility. In addition to promoting actin-spectrin association, adducin is known to act as an actin-capping protein (18Matsuoka Y. Li X. Bennet V. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 884-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Like spectrin recruitment activities, adducin actin capping is activated by ROCK-mediated phosphorylation and is inhibited by protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation (32Matsuoka Y. Li X. Bennet V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 485-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Kachar and co-workers (26Schneider M.E. Belyantseva I.A. Azevedo R.B. Kachar B. Nature. 2002; 418: 837Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) described recently that the actin filaments forming the core of hair cell stereocilia are continuously remodeled. Complete remodeling is achieved every 48 h by addition of actin monomers to the stereocilium tips. The strong labeling of phospho-Thr445 adducin in the hair bundle of untreated OHCs (Fig. 6a, inset) suggests that actin renewal could be another homeostatic process regulated by a ROCK-mediated pathway involving adducin. Regulation of OHC Electromotility by ACh—The dynamic range of the mammalian cochlea is ∼120 db from the softest to the loudest sounds the cochlea can detect without permanent damage. This means that the cochlea can withstand sound pressures that are one million times greater in amplitude and therefore with 1012 more energy than sounds at the threshold of detection (9Patuzzi R. Dallos P. Popper A.N. Fay R.R. The Cochlea. Vol. 8. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New, York1996: 186-257Google Scholar). It survives because the mechanical sensitivity and amplification are progressively reduced as the sound level increases. A self-regulated homeostatic response may be insufficient, however, to protect the cochlea from sudden bursts of high energy noise. ACh released by the efferent terminals innervating OHCs could be required to disengage this automatic gain control and to rapidly inhibit amplification in response to changes in the auditory input that may result in cochlear damage. The results summarized in Fig. 5 suggest that ACh influences OHC electromotility by activating a signaling pathway mediated by RhoA, but not by ROCK. Adducin experiments supported this hypothesis by showing that ACh did not increases ROCK-mediated phosphorylation at Thr445 (Fig. 6, e–h). Therefore, this ACh-activated pathway is different from those involved in OHC mechanical homeostasis. Because ACh reverses the decrease in electromotile amplitude induced by ROCK inhibition, we envision this ACh-activated pathway as a reset system able to move the cell quickly back to a mechanical steady state, ensuring the inhibition of the cochlear amplifier when necessary to protect the auditory system from acoustic trauma. If ACh would always increase OHC electromotile amplitude, why did we not detect any ACh-induced electromotile increase in untreated isolated OHCs? According to the proposed model (Fig. 8), the upper value for the ACh-induced increase in OHC electromotile amplitude should be equal to the biggest response compatible with structural and functional parameters of the force generator mechanism and the external and internal mechanical load working on it. Therefore, an isolated OHC (no external mechanical load) in complete mechanical equilibrium with the medium (lowest internal load) would respond to a given stimulus with the biggest possible electromotile amplitude for that condition. In consequence, the amplitude in the control group would be near the upper limit for the electromotile response under our experimental conditions, and it could not be further increased by ACh. Thus, the ACh effect would be evident only in isolated cells not in mechanical equilibrium or unable to reach it by a particular treatment. This was the response observed, for instance, in OHCs treated with the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632, for which the ACh effect was to bring the amplitude back to control values (Fig. 5). Conclusions—We have provided evidence that the small GTPase RhoA and its downstream target ROCK are crucial for the mechanical homeostasis and regulation of the electromotile response of cochlear OHCs. Our results support a model in which a RhoA/ROCK-mediated signaling cascade would be able to inhibit a Rac1-mediated parallel pathway that decreases OHC electromotile amplitude. Higher levels of inhibition would result in bigger OHC electromotile amplitude, providing a safe and reliable automatic control for the cochlear amplifier. In this model, ACh should be able to inhibit the cochlear amplifier by resetting OHC electromotile amplitude to values corresponding to mechanical equilibrium. OHC electromotility regulation would be associated with cytoskeleton reorganization, without changes in the performance of the membrane-embedded molecular motors.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants, unable to synthesize CL because of a null allele of the CRD1 gene (encodes CL synthase), have been reported with different phenotypes. Some mutants, when grown on a nonfermentable carbon source at elevated temperatures, exhibit mitochondrial DNA instability, loss of viability, and significant defects in several functions that rely on the mitochondrial energy transducing system (ETS). These mutants also lack the immediate precursor to CL, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), when grown on glucose as a carbon source. Other mutants show reduced growth efficiency on a nonfermentable carbon source but much milder phenotypes associated with growth at elevated temperatures and increased levels of PG when grown on glucose. We present evidence that mitochondrial DNA instability, loss of viability, and defects in the ETS exhibited at elevated temperatures by some mutants are caused by the reduced expression of the PET56 gene in the presence of the his3Δ200 allele and not the lack of CL alone. We also found that PG is present and elevated in all crd1Δ strains when grown on glucose. A supermolecular complex between complex III and complex IV of the mitochondrial ETS detected in wild type cells was missing in all of the above crd1Δ cells. The level of components of the ETS was also reduced in crd1Δ cells grown at elevated temperatures because of reduced gene expression and not reduced stability. These results suggest that all phenotypes reported for cells carrying the his3Δ200 allele and lacking CL should be re-evaluated.

When compared with a wild type CRD1 (gene encoding CL synthase) strain, Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants lacking CL synthase (crd1Δ, null in the expression of this enzyme) grow slower and to a lower cell density at the optimal temperature of 28–30 °C on a nonfermentable carbon source such as glycerol/ethanol (4Chang S.C.

These mutant strains lacking CL have elevated levels of phosphatidylglycerol (PG), the precursor of CL, when grown on a nonfermentable carbon source. However, there has been disagreement with regard to several other phenotypes reported for crd1Δ strains when grown on glucose as a carbon source or at elevated temperatures on glucose or glycerol/ethanol. In some genetic backgrounds, crd1Δ strains contain little if any PG when grown on glucose at any temperature (5Tuller G. Hrastnik C. Achleitner G. Schiefthaler U. Klein F. Daum G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 8Jiang F. Ryan M.T. Schlame M. Zhao M. Gu Z. Klingenberg M. Pfanner N. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22387-22394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Because neither PG nor CL is required for growth of yeast on glucose, such conditions have been suggested as a model for studying yeast lacking these anionic lipids (8Jiang F. Ryan M.T. Schlame M.

When some crd1Δ strains were grown at elevated temperatures for extended periods of time, they displayed increased mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) instability, reduced oxidative phosphorylation capacity, reduced function of the ADP/ATP translocator, loss of viability, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased mitochondrial membrane permeability (6Jiang F. Gu Z. Granger J.M. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8Jiang F. Ryan M.T. Schlame M. Zhao M. Gu Z. Klingenberg M. Pfanner N. Greenberg M.L. J.

Mileykovskaya E. Voelker D.R. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14933-14941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).A likely possibility for the phenotypic differences among crd1Δ strains is the genetic backgrounds in which this mutation was placed. We noted that crd1Δ strains also carrying the his3Δ200 allele displayed significantly more severe phenotypes at elevated growth temperatures (6Jiang F. Gu Z. Granger J.M. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8Jiang F. Ryan M.T. Schlame M. Zhao M. Gu Z. Klingenberg M. Pfanner N. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14933-14941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The his3Δ200 allele is a complete deletion of the gene that extends into the common promoter element for the HIS3 gene and the divergently expressed PET56 gene (11Struhl K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8419-8423Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). This deletion results in an 80% reduction in expression of mRNA for the Pet56p. Pet56p is imported into the mitochondria where it catalyzes the formation of 2′-O-methylguanosine at a specific nucleotide in the peptidyl transferase center of the RNA of the large mitochondrial ribosomal subunit (12Sirum-Connolly K. Mason T.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1886-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Null mutants in PET56 are defective in assembly of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit and do not grow on nonfermentable carbon sources, but partial loss of PET56 expression results in slowed growth, mtDNA instability, and loss of cell viability at elevated temperatures (12Sirum-Connolly K. Mason T.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1886-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13Rieger K.J. Kaniak A. Coppee J.Y. Aljinovic G. Baudin-Baillieu A. Orlowska G. Gromadka R. Groudinsky O. Di Rago J.P. Slonimski P.P. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1547-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) similar to the properties of crd1Δ strains containing the his3Δ200 allele (8Jiang F. Ryan M.T.

We report here that many of the severe phenotypes ascribed to cells lacking CL, particularly when grown at 37 °C, are because of a synergistic interaction of the crd1Δ mutation with the reduced expression of the PET56 gene in a his3Δ200 background. In addition, we report the presence of elevated PG levels in crd1Δ strains when grown on glucose. Finally, the lack of a supermolecular complex between complex III (cytochrome bc 1 complex) and complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase complex) of the inner mitochondrial membrane, originally detected in a crd1Δ his3Δ200 background (9Zhang M. Mileykovskaya E. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43553-43556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), is because of lack of CL and not the genetic background.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—YPH500 (ade2–101, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, lys2–801, trp1Δ63, ura3–52, MATα) (14Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and YZD2 (ade2–101, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, lys2–801, trp1Δ63, ura3–52, crd1Δ::HIS3, MATα) with the entire CRD1 open reading frame disrupted as described previously (9Zhang M. Mileykovskaya E. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43553-43556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) were used in this study. The complete CRD1 coding sequence was replaced in DL1 (his3–11,15, leu2–3,112, ura3–251,328,372, MATα) to make the crd1Δ::HIS3 strain YZD5. YZD5 was constructed by homologous recombination with a polymerase chain reaction product of the HIS3 gene flanked by 5′ and 3′ regions that lie outside of the CRD1 gene coding sequence. Amplification was accomplished from HIS3-containing plasmid pRS303 (14Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with primers 5′-ATCGGGAGTATACAATATTTACAATTGAAAAAATATAGAAAGGAGGCAATTGAGAAACAAGCAGGCCTGGTAGCATAGTTTGGTCCCTAATAATTTAGTCtgatgcggtattttctccttacg-3′ and 5′-GTTGATTTAGTGTATTTTCCACTACATAAAAACTAAAAAACATTCAAAATGAAAAGTCAGGACCCTTTTCAAAAAGGATCGCAATTAatgcggcatcagagcagattgta-3′ (regions flanking CRD1 homology are in capital letters, and HIS3 homologous regions are in lowercase letters). Yeast transformation was carried out using the Alkali-Cation™ yeast transformation kit (Bio 101, Inc.). A crd1Δ derivative was selected on histidine drop-out minimal medium plates containing glucose. Genomic polymerase chain reaction with three sets of primers confirmed the disruption. The crd1Δ derivative (HSD2) of strain HMD22 (ura3–52, leu2–3,112, lys2, his3ΔHindIII, arg8::hisG, cox2::ARG8m, MATa) (kindly provided by Dr. Thomas Fox, Cornell University) was constructed in a similar manner. In HMD22, the coding sequence of the mtDNA-encoded COX2 gene was replaced with the chromosomally encoded ARG8 gene that was recoded for translation in the mitochondrial matrix (15Green-Willms N.S. Butler C.A. Dunstan H.M. Fox T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6392-6397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) thus generating PCOX2-ARG8m.The plasmid pLPY6 (carrying PET56 in plasmid pRS315 (14Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), LEU2, ARS/CEN) was kindly provided by Dr. Thomas Mason (University of Massachusetts, Amherst) and transformed into yeast strains with the Alkali-Cation™ yeast transformation kit. Transformants were selected on yeast nitrogen base leucine drop-out medium containing glucose. The plasmid pCL1 (PCOX4 -lacZ, URA3, 2μ and ColE1 origin) was derived from pMA109 (16Anderson M.S. Lopes J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26596-26601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A 1.5-kb DNA fragment, including the promoter and encoding the 5′-mRNA upstream untranslated leader (UTL) along with the initiation codon of COX4, was isolated by polymerase chain reaction and ligated to the open reading frame of lacZ thus generating PCOX4-lacZ.Cell Viability and Retention of the Mitochondrial Function Assays— Cells with different genotypes were grown at 37 °C in rich media (1% yeast extract and 2% peptone) plus either a fermentable (YPD, 2% glucose) or nonfermentable (YPEG, 1% ethanol and 3% glycerol) carbon source for 100 h. An equal number of cells determined by microscopy was then plated at 30 °C either on YPD to determine cell viability independent of loss of mitochondrial function, or on YPEG to assess mitochondrial function. The number of colonies formed on YPD was taken as the number of viable cells in the culture. The ratio of the number of cells that formed colonies on YPEG versus the number on YPD plates was used as an index of retention of mitochondrial function and mtDNA stability.Phospholipid Analysis—To prepare phospholipids for analysis by mass spectrometry, cells were grown at 30 °C in YPD to late exponential phase and homogenized with a solution of CH3OH, CHCl3, 0.1 n HCl (10:5:4) in a Mini-Beadbeater™ (BioSpec Products) at maximal setting for 5 min. Mitochondria were also isolated from cells as described below, and the phospholipids were extracted using the above mentioned solvents. Extracted lipids were analyzed by mass spectrometry as described previously (17Ostrander D.B. Sparagna G.C. Amoscato A.A. McMillin J.B. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38061-38067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).In Vivo Labeling of Mitochondrial Translation Productions—In vivo pulse-labeling of mitochondrial translation products with [35S]methionine was done essentially as described in Ref. 18Fox T.D. Folley L.S. Mulero J.J. McMullin T.W. Thorsness P.E. Hedin L.O. Costanzo M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 149-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar. Briefly, cells were grown at 30 °C in standard minimal medium containing 1% ethanol, 3% glycerol to mid-log phase, collected, resuspended in the same volume of fresh medium pre-warmed to 37 °C, and incubated for an additional 2 h at 37 °C. After cycloheximide treatment for 5 min, [35S]methionine was added. Labeling was stopped after 1 h by adding chase solution (1% casamino acids, 2 mg/ml Na2SO4). Cells were broken using a Mini-Beadbeater™, and crude mitochondria were collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pellets were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis. Radioactivity was quantified using a phosphorimaging device (Bio-Rad).Blue Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (BN-PAGE)—Sample preparation and BN-PAGE were carried out essentially as described previously (9Zhang M. Mileykovskaya E. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43553-43556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Briefly, mitochondria (75 μg of protein) were solubilized with 1% digitonin-containing buffer. After solubilization, samples were centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 30 min. Sample buffer (1.5 μl of 5% (w/v) Serva Blue G in 500 mm aminocaproic acid) was added to the supernatant, and electrophoresis was carried out in a 4–8% polyacrylamide gradient mini-gel (8.7 × 13.3 cm). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose sheets for Western blot analysis and located using monoclonal antibody (Molecular Probes) specific for Cox3p (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 3 of complex IV) or polyclonal antibody (from Dr. Gottfried Schatz, Biozentrum, Basel, Switzerland) specific for Cobp (cytochrome b subunit of complex III). Final detection was with secondary antibodies linked to horseradish peroxidase using chemiluminescence (Pierce) and a Bio-Rad FX. High molecular weight markers from Amersham Biosciences were used as standards.β-Galactosidase Assay—β-Galactosidase activity was assayed as described previously (19Shen H. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11638-11642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In brief, yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Cells were disrupted in a Mini-Beadbeater™. β-Galactosidase activity was analyzed in cell lysates and calculated as Miller units.Other Methods—The isolation of mitochondria was accomplished essentially by the method of Glick and Pon (20Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) from cells grown in YPD or YPEG. Protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 4–20% gradient Ready Gels and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose sheets for Western blot analysis as described previously (21Ostrander D.B. Zhang M. Mileykovskaya E. Rho M. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25262-25272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Antibodies specific for porin or Cox1–4p were purchased from Molecular Probes, and antibody against Arg8p was provided by Dr. Thomas Fox. After treatment with the designated antibodies, protein bands were visualized by chemiluminescence and detected with a Bio-Rad FX.RESULTSGrowth Rate and Final Cell Density of crd1Δ Strains—Cells with different genotypes were grown at 30 or 37 °C in either YPD or YPEG. Growth rates for crd1Δ strains carrying either the his3-11,15 allele or the his3Δ200 allele were nearly the same as their respective isogenic CRD1 strains when grown on glucose as a carbon source at 30 °C (Fig. 1A). However, strains carrying his3–11,15 (DL1 and YZD5) grew much faster and reached higher final cell densities than strains carrying his3Δ200 (YPH500 and YZD2). CRD1 and crd1Δ strains carrying his3–11,15 also showed no growth differences on glucose at 37 °C (Fig. 1B). However, in the his3Δ200 background there was a significant reduction in growth rate and final cell density attained by crd1Δ cells when grown in YPD at 37 °C compared with the parental CRD1 cells. In both his3 genetic backgrounds, CRD1 cells grew considerably faster and to a higher final cell density than crd1Δ cells when grown in YPEG at 30 °C as has been observed previously (5Tuller G. Hrastnik C. Achleitner G. Schiefthaler U. Klein F. Daum G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 7Jiang F. Rizavi H.S. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 9Zhang M. Mileykovskaya E. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43553-43556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), but strains carrying his3–11,15 exhibited better growth than their corresponding CRD1 and crd1Δ cells with the his3Δ200 allele (Fig. 1C). When grown in YPEG at 37 °C, crd1Δ cells were even more severely compromised in both genetic backgrounds (Fig. 1D).Cell Viability and Retention of the Mitochondrial Function— Because strains carrying the his3Δ200 allele (and thus also the pet56 defective) grew much poorer than cells that were wild type for PET56 (his3–11,15 allele), we investigated whether the difference was because of reduced cell viability and/or mtDNA instability for the his3Δ200-containing strains. The results in Fig. 2 are the average of three individual experiments showing the percentage of plated cells that formed colonies and were, therefore, viable after 100 h at 37 °C. CRD1 cell viability, when grown in YPD as measured by the number of colonies formed as a percentage of cells plated to YPD medium, ranged from 85 to 95% and was set at 100%. In some cases, cells grown in YPEG showed a higher plating efficiency resulting in an apparent viability over 100%.Fig. 2Cell viability after prolonged growth. The indicated strains were grown at 37 °C in YPD or YPEG for 100 h. An equal number of cells grown in YPD was plated at 30 °C either on YPD agar plates (first bar in each set) to determine cell viability independent of loss of mitochondrial function or on YPEG agar plates (third bar in each set) to assess mitochondrial function. Similarly, cells grown in YPEG were plated for growth at 30 °C either on YPD agar plates (second bar in each set) to assess cell viability or on YPEG agar plates (fourth bar in each set) to assess mitochondrial function. The data are an average of three separate experiments with the error bars indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)There was little statistical difference in viability between crd1Δ and CRD1 cells with a high transcription level of PET56 (YZD5 and DL1, respectively) when grown in YPD and plated on YPD plates (Fig. 2, first bar in each strain set), whereas crd1Δ cells (YZD2) with a low transcription level of PET56 showed a 40% reduction in cell viability compared with its CRD1 parental strain (YPH500). When grown in YPEG at 37 °C and plated on YPD plates at 30 °C (Fig. 2, second bar in each strain set) to determine cell viability independent of loss of mitochondrial function, YZD5 maintained almost the same viability as the parental strain DL1. On the other hand, YZD2 showed 70% reduced viability compared with its wild type parental strain (YPH500), which maintained high viability. YZD2 (pet56) grown at 37 °C either in YPD (Fig. 2, third bar in each strain set) or YPEG (Fig. 2, fourth bar in each set) showed a dramatic loss of mitochondrial function as evidenced by low plating efficiency (<2%) at 30 °C on YPEG. Even YPH500 (pet56) maintained only 40% viability under these conditions as compared with DL1 and YZD5 (PET56), which showed little or no loss of mitochondrial function. When YPH500 and YZD2, carrying the his3Δ200 allele with its associated defective pet56, were supplied with a plasmid-borne copy of PET56, cell viability for both the CRD1 and crd1Δ strains was significantly increased particularly when they were plated on YPEG for which mitochondrial function is required.The stability of mtDNA during growth in YPEG at 37 °C was determined by comparing the ratio of colonies formed at 30 °C on YPEG versus YPD plates. A lower ratio indicates decreased mtDNA stability. These ratios were high for his3–11,15 PET56 strains (DL1 background) but were significantly reduced for his3Δ200 pet56 strains (YPH500 background) with the latter crd1Δ strain even more compromised than its CRD1 parental strain (Fig. 3). When the latter strains were supplied with a plasmid-borne copy of PET56, the ratios were significantly increased indicating that mtDNA stability was increased. Analysis of cells for plasmid retention by plating to minimal media with or without leucine indicated that about 80% of the cells had retained the PET56-containing plasmid (data not shown). This is probably the reason that there was not complete complementation of YPH500 and YZD2 by the plasmid as shown in Figs. 3 and 4.Fig. 3Assessment of mtDNA stability after growth in YPEG. The indicated strains carrying either the CRD1 or crd1Δ allele were grown in YPEG at 37 °C for 100 h. An equal number of cells from each culture was then plated on YPD and YPEG agar and grown at 30 °C, and mtDNA retention was calculated as the number of colonies formed on YPEG plates divided by the number of colonies formed on YPD plates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Steady state levels of ETS protein subunits in mitochondria isolated from CRD1 and crd1 Δ strains. DL1 (lane 1), YZD5 (lane 2), YPH500 (lane 3), and YZD2 (lane 4) were grown in YPEG at 37 °C for 46 h. Mitochondria were isolated, and 20 μg of protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for the indicated proteins. The mitochondrial outer membrane protein porin was used to verify that the same amount of mitochondria (lanes 1 and 3 versus lanes 2 and 4, respectively) was loaded to each lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Reduced Levels of ETS Proteins in crd1Δ Cells—The steady state levels of the Cox1–4p subunits of cytochrome c oxidase and the Cobp subunit of cytochrome bc 1 were determined in crd1Δ cells relative to CRD1 cells grown at 37 °C in YPEG. Crd1Δ cells (Fig. 4, lane 2) with the his3–11,15 background showed reduced levels of the mtDNA-encoded subunits Cox1–3p and Cobp as well as the nuclear-encoded Cox4p relative to the CRD1 parental strain (Fig. 4, lane 1). However, in crd1Δ his3Δ200 cells there was almost no detectable Cox1–3p, Cobp, and Cox4p as shown by Western blotting (Fig. 4, lane 4 versus lane 3). Relative to the internal control (Porin), the absolute amount of ETS proteins was lower in YPH500 than in DL1.A similar pattern was observed if the capacity of mitochondria to synthesize protein after growth at 37 °C was tested in whole cells with different genetic backgrounds. [35S]Methionine incorporation was followed in the presence of cycloheximide, which specifically inhibits nuclear-encoded protein synthesis. Crd1Δ cells in the his3–11,15 background showed reduced ability to synthesize mitochondrial-encoded proteins at 37 °C when grown in YPEG as compared with the parental strain, whereas crd1Δ his3Δ200 cells completely lost the capacity of mitochondria to synthesize protein after only 2 h at 37 °C (Fig. 5); overexposure as shown in lane 5 indicates that trace amounts of protein translation products were present in YZD2. This is consistent with mtDNA instability in YZD2 when grown at 37 °C.Fig. 5Reduced level of mitochondrial protein synthesis in crd1Δ cells. DL1 (lane 1), YZD5 (lane 2), YPH500 (lane 3), and YZD2 (lanes 4 and 5) were pre-grown at 30 °C in standard minimal medium with ethanol/glycerol and labeled at 37 °C with [35S]methionine in the presence of cycloheximide as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Crude mitochondria were isolated, and 30 μg of mitochondrial protein were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. Quantification of the radioactivity was performed by using a phosphorimaging device (Bio-Rad). The positions of various mitochondrial-encoded proteins (23Cameron V.L. Fox T.D. Poyton R.O. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2033875148,"The cytochrome P450 CYP2B19 is a keratinocyte-specific arachidonic acid epoxygenase expressed in the granular cell layer of mouse epidermis. In cultured keratinocytes, CYP2B19 mRNAs are up-regulated coordinately with those of profilaggrin, another granular cell-specific marker. We investigated effects of the CYP2B19 metabolites 11,12- and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) on keratinocyte transglutaminase activities and cornified cell envelope formation. Keratinocytes were differentiated in vitro in the presence of biotinylated cadaverine. Transglutaminases cross-linked this substrate into endogenous proteins in situ; an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantify the biotinylated proteins. Exogenously added or endogenously formed 14,15-EET increased transglutaminase cross-linking activities in cultured human and mouse epidermal keratinocytes in a modified in situ assay. Transglutaminase activities increased ∼8-fold (p ≤ 0.02 versus mock control) in human keratinocytes transduced with adenovirus particles expressing a 14S,15R-EET epoxygenase (P450 BM3v). The physiological transglutaminase substrate involucrin was preferentially biotinylated in situ, determined by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry. P450 BM3v-induced transglutaminase activation was associated with increased 14,15-EET formation (p = 0.002) and spontaneous cell cornification (p ≤ 0.001). Preferential involucrin biotinylation and the increased cornified cell envelope formation provided evidence that transglutaminases mediated the P450 BM3v-induced cross-linking activities. These results support a physiological role for 14,15-EET epoxygenases in regulating epidermal cornification, and they have important implications for epidermal barrier functions in vivo.

In the outer epidermis, the stratum granulosum gives rise to the stratum corneum. These two cell layers form a functional unit or boundary layer (1Menon G.K. J. Invest.

Granular keratinocytes comprise the most terminally differentiated, viable cell layer (stratum granulosum) of the epidermis. Their major functions are to synthesize barrier lipid precursors and to undergo two complex processes, cornification and differentiation-induced programmed cell death (4Wertz P.W. van den Bergh B.

This insoluble structure acquires functional significance as granular cells undergo programmed cell death. The regulation of these processes is poorly understood, and genetic defects resulting in abnormal CEs are associated with skin diseases and defective epithelial barrier functions (9Ishida-Yamamoto A. Iizuka H. Exp. Dermatol. 1998; 7: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Granular keratinocytes in mouse epidermis express the cytochrome P450 CYP2B19, which has epoxygenase activity toward arachidonic acid (10Keeney D.S.

Pentland A. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1446-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), but the CYP gene products involved are not yet known, and the physiological significance of epidermal EET synthesis has remained obscure. P450 epoxygenases are widely expressed in mammalian tissues and are the catalytic source of EETs (14Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Harris R.C. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 163-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate arachidonic acid is normally present in cellular glycerophospholipids, where it is released by arachidonic acid-selective lipases and serves as precursor in metabolic and signal transduction pathways. Mechanisms explaining EET biological activities are not yet clearly defined, and specific cellular receptors have not been characterized. Studies of vascular and renal cells showed that EETs function as intracellular signaling molecules regulating cell growth and differentiated cell functions (14Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Harris R.C. J.

We report evidence indicating that this 14,15-EET epoxygenase functions to regulate epidermal cornification. Cutaneous P450 epoxygenases provide new investigative approaches to elucidate the complex mechanisms regulating keratinocyte cornification. Cell Culture—Epidermal keratinocytes were isolated by trypsinization (24Dlugosz A.A. Glick A.B. Tennenbaum T. Weinberg W.C. Yuspa S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) from outbred mice (<3 days old, CD-1 strain; Charles River) or discarded, human newborn foreskins. Keratinocytes were maintained in 6-well plates as primary cultures (mouse) or passaged three or four times (human). Proliferating cultures were fed every other day with 2 ml of complete Epi-life medium (0.06 mm Ca2+; Cascade). Differentiation was induced at ∼70% confluence (day 0) by adjusting Ca2+ in complete keratinocyte growth medium (Clonetics) to 0.125 mm (mouse) or 1.4 mm (human). Differentiating cultures were fed daily, and drugs were added as indicated. The transglutaminase inhibitor cystamine and amiloride were from Sigma. Arachidonic acid (NuCheck) in ethanol was mixed with 2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (10 μl/ml medium; Sigma) when used as medium supplement (25Marcelo C.L. Rhodes L.M. Dunham W.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 103: 564-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Epoxy fatty acids were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. Proliferating cultures were infected with recombinant adenovirus particles at 60–70% confluence, for 20 ± 2 h. Virus particles were removed by washing twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), and the cells were refed with differentiation medium (day 0). Mock-transduced cultures were treated identically but received no virus particles. Recombinant Adenoviruses—Replication-defective, recombinant adenoviruses (serotype 5; Ad5) were generated by homologous recombination in 293A cells (Qbiogene) as described (26Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Open reading frames encoding P450 BM3v (27Graham-Lorence S. Truant G. Peterson J.A. Falck J.R. Wei S. Helvig C. Capdevila J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1127-1135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and β-galactosidase were subcloned into the plasmid pACCMV.pLpA under control of a cytomegalovirus promoter (28Gomez-Foix A.M. Coats W.S. Baque S. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25129-25134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). P450 BM3v is a mutated (F87V) form of P450 BM3 originally constructed in the Peterson laboratory (27Graham-Lorence S. Truant G. Peterson J.A. Falck J.R. Wei S. Helvig C. Capdevila J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1127-1135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). P450 BM3v encodes a cytochrome P450 domain fused to a P450 reductase domain, and it functions as a self-sufficient 14S,15R-EET epoxygenase. Recombinant virus particles were subjected to three rounds of plaque purification. The absence of wild type virus particles was evaluated by PCR (29Zhang W.-W. Koch E.E. Roth J.A. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 444-447PubMed Google Scholar), using Ad2 genomic DNA (Invitrogen) as the positive control template. Virus particles were purified from 293A cell lysates using a single cesium chloride gradient and desalted on P10 Sephadex columns (Amersham Biosciences) (26Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Viral expression of recombinant proteins was confirmed by Southern blot, PCR, and Western immunoblotting using rabbit anti-β-galactosidase (1:2000; Eppendorf 5 Prime Inc.) and rabbit anti-P450 BM3v. Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated. Western Immunoblot Analyses—6-Well culture plates were washed twice with DPBS. Protease inhibitors were added (Complete Mini; Roche Applied Science), and cells were scraped in 800 μl of 9 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.026% 2-mercaptoethanol. After one freeze-thaw, samples were sonified (3 × 8 s using a microtip; Branson Ultrasonics Sonifier 250). Urea-insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (5 min, 10,000 rpm). Equal amounts of protein (8–10 μg/lane; BCA assay kit; Pierce) were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and electrotransferred in glycine buffer containing 10% methanol for 16 h at 35 V and 4 °C (Mini-Protean II; Bio-Rad). Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in 3% milk buffer (3% nonfat dried milk in DPBS) and incubated with antibody diluted in 0.5% milk buffer for ≥2 h or overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies were anti-human (Biogenesis) or anti-mouse (Covance) involucrin at 1:3000 and anti-guinea pig transglutaminase type II (Ab-3, clones CUB 7402 and TG100 at 1:200; Neomarkers). Data were visualized by chemiluminescence using HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Renaissance kit; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and Eastman Kodak Co. X-Omat AR film. Endogenous Epoxyeicosatrienoic Acids—Human keratinocytes were treated as described for adenoviral gene transfer experiments, scraped in the culture medium, and immediately chilled on ice. Triphenylphosphine was added as a peroxide-reducing agent, and the cells were disrupted by sonification and homogenization (Brinkman Polytron homogenizer; 5 × 5-s with 7-mm generator). Organic extracts of the disrupted cells were purified and quantified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry, as described (30Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Dishman E. Karara A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 31Capdevila J.H. Dishman E. Karara A. Falck J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The contents of 14,15-EET and the summed contents of 11,12- and 8,9-EET were measured; 5,6-EET could not be measured reliably by this assay. In the absence of chaotropic agents, there was significant insoluble material in the disrupted cells prior to organic extraction. This made protein determinations unreliable, so the data were expressed as ng of EET recovered (4-P100s/treatment). In Situ Transglutaminase Enzyme Activities—In situ transglutaminase activities were measured in differentiating keratinocyte cultures by modifying the conventional in situ assay (32Hiiragi T. Sasaki H. Nagafuchi A. Sabe H. Shen S.C. Matsuki M. Yamanishi K. Tsukita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34148-34154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cells were differentiated in the continuous presence of 2 mm biotinylated cadaverine (5-(biotinamido) pentylamine, 50 mg/1.5 ml DPBS; Pierce). Since this cell-permeant transglutaminase substrate competes efficiently with endogenous transglutaminase substrates, transglutaminase-mediated protein biotinylation is controlled by transcriptional and posttranslational regulatory mechanisms and the metabolic conditions existing in the differentiating keratinocytes. Cell lysates were harvested and Western blotted as described. Streptavidin-HRP (1:8000–10,000; Pierce) was used to visualize biotinylated proteins electrotransferred to membranes. For the in situ ELISA (33Zhang J. Lesort M. Guttmann R.P. Johnson G.V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2288-2295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), triplicate wells in 96-well assay plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 0.2 μl of cell lysate diluted into 100 μl of Tris buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.3). The wells were washed with buffer three times and blocked for 1 h with 150 μl of 3% milk buffer (3% nonfat dried milk in Tris buffer). Wells were washed again and incubated with 100 μl of streptavidin-HRP for 4 h (1:1000 in 0.5% milk buffer). Wells were washed again and incubated with 150 μl of TMB peroxidase substrate for 5–15 min (Kirkegaard & Perry). Reactions were stopped by adding 150 μl of 1.5 n HCl. Absorbance values measured at 450 nm (A 450) were linear with respect to μg of protein, and the data were expressed as A 450/μg. The limit of detection (A 450) was calculated as the mean + 2 S.D. values for lysates containing no exogenous biotin. Norbiotinamine and ϵ-biotinoyl-l-lysine were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The data represent cumulative cross-linking activities, measured as the cellular content of biotinylated protein that accumulated from day 0 until cell lysis. Protein Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization (MALDI) Mass Spectrometry—Proteins were separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Bio-Rad). Excised protein bands were equilibrated in 100 mm NH4HCO3, reduced with dithiothreitol (3 mm in 100 mm NH4HCO3, 60 °C for 30 min), and alkylated with iodoacetamide (6 mm in 100 mm NH4HCO3 for 30 min in the dark). Gel slices were then equilibrated and dehydrated with 50% acetonitrile, 100 mm NH4HCO3, and the liquid was discarded after 15 min. They were further dehydrated with acetonitrile and rehydrated with 20 μl of 25 mm NH4HCO3 containing 0.02 μg/μl modified trypsin (Promega), and trypsin digestion was carried out overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted with 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, dried by vacuum centrifugation, and reconstituted in 10 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were then desalted and concentrated into 2–3 μl of 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid using ZipTipC18 pipette tips (Millipore Corp.). Samples (1 μl) were mixed with an equal volume of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix and applied to a target plate. MALDI-time-of-flight mass spectrometry was carried out using a Voyager 4700 mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) operated in reflectron mode. The mass spectrum was calibrated to within 50 ppm using trypsin autolytic peptides in the samples (m/z = 842.50 and 2211.09 daltons). Ions ([M + H]) corresponding to peptide masses were entered into the MASCOT data base search algorithm (available on the World Wide Web at www.matrixscience.com), which compared the data against proteins present in the NCBI nr data base (allowing for complete carbamidomethylation of cysteine). Cornified Cell Envelopes—CEs were counted in keratinocyte cultures that cornified spontaneously during in vitro differentiation (n = 3 P60s/treatment) (34Rice R.H. Leigh I. Watt F. Keratinocyte Methods. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1994: 157-165Google Scholar). Cells in each dish were trypsinized and resuspended in 1 ml of DPBS, and duplicate aliquots (175 μl) were adjusted to 2 mm EDTA to minimize clumping. These cells were centrifuged (4000 × g, 5 min), resuspended in 1.5 ml of dissociation buffer, and boiled for 5 min. The dissociation buffer was 2% SDS, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Detergent-insoluble CEs were cooled, centrifuged, and resuspended in 50 μl of normal saline. The CEs were visualized by phase-contrast microscopy and counted in a hemacytometer. Total cells and total CEs per dish were calculated, and the data were expressed as total CEs/total cells × 100. To count ionophore-inducible CEs, duplicate aliquots of resuspended cells were adjusted to 1.8 mm Ca2+. Cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with gentle rocking after adding X537A to 50 μg/ml (generously provided by Robert Rice) (34Rice R.H. Leigh I. Watt F. Keratinocyte Methods. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1994: 157-165Google Scholar); then they were treated exactly as described for spontaneous CEs. Analyses of Messenger RNAs—Poly(A)+ RNAs were isolated using a Fast Track kit (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription and PCR were performed as directed (RNA PCR kit; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For ribonuclease protection assays, total RNAs and [32P]UTP-cRNAs were hybridized as directed (RPA III kit; Ambion). Protected fragments were visualized using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Isotopic counts associated with protected fragments were quantified using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences) and were linear with respect to μg of RNA. Gene-specific oligonucleotides (Table I) were used to determine which transglutaminases were expressed in differentiating keratinocytes. The reverse transcription-PCR products were concentrated under vacuum, size-fractionated on agarose gels, and visualized with ethidium bromide. They were evaluated based on predicted sizes and actual DNA sequences.Table IGene-specific oligonucleotides used to amplify cDNAs encoding transglutaminase isoformsTypeSense (5′-3′)Antisense (5′-3′):IGCA GCT GGA GAT GGC ACC ATCCCA CTG GGA TGA TCA CGT GIIGTT GTT GTC CCA GCG (T/G)CC CAGAGC TTT GTG CTG GGC CAC TTCIIITGG AAA AAA TCT GGC TTC AGGTA GTA CAC ATC CAC ACT GAGVAGC TAC CAT GGC CCA AGG GCT AGCGT CTG GCG CGT TGT TCC AG Open table in a new tab The CYP2B19 Metabolite 14,15-EET Activates Keratinocyte Transglutaminases—The CYP2B19 metabolites 11,12- and 14,15-EET are present in measurable quantities in fresh mouse epidermis (11Keeney D.S.

The Cyp2b19 gene is expressed in the outer epidermis, and its cell type-specific and (late) differentiation-specific expression patterns are known (10Keeney D.S.

Cyp2b19 is first activated transcriptionally in fetal mouse epidermis (approximately embryonic day 15) in the same cell layers as profilaggrin, and this expression persists throughout postnatal development. These in situ hybridization results showed that, like profilaggrin, mouse CYP2B19 is a specific marker for granular keratinocytes. This was corroborated by Northern blot analyses of mouse keratinocyte cultures showing that differentiation induced the coordinate expression of CYP2B19 and profilaggrin mRNAs (11Keeney D.S. Skinner C. Travers J.B. Capdevila J.H. Nanney L.B. King Jr., L.E. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32071-32079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Between 48 and 96 h, ∼15–20-fold increases in mRNA levels were achieved, measured by ribonuclease protection assays (Fig. 1). From these expression studies, it seemed unlikely that CYP2B19 would function to induce keratinocyte differentiation, because its up-regulation does not precede other granular cell-specific gene products temporally or spatially. We hypothesized that CYP2B19 regulates integral cell functions in keratinocytes, having already acquired a terminally differentiated phenotype. Granular keratinocytes in the outer epidermis express CE component proteins and catalytically active transglutaminases (9Ishida-Yamamoto A. Iizuka H. Exp. Dermatol. 1998; 7: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 35Michel S. Demarchez M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1988; 90: 472-474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transglutaminases cross-link the scaffold proteins involucrin, loricin, and many others, forming insoluble CEs (8Kalinin A.E. Kajava A.V. Steinert P.M. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 9Ishida-Yamamoto A. Iizuka H. Exp. Dermatol. 1998; 7: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We measured effects of CYP2B19 metabolites (11,12- and 14,15-EET) on in situ cross-linking activities as keratinocytes actively differentiated in vitro. This distinction is important because in vitro cross-linking activities (i.e. occurring in disrupted or fractionated cells) are not governed by normal transcriptional and post-translational control mechanisms; nor are they subject to the hormonal and metabolic milieus that regulate transglutaminase isoforms in cells (36Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 37Gibson D.F.C. Ratnam A.V. Bikle D.D. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 154-161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Biotinylated cadaverine was the transglutaminase substrate, and in situ cross-linking activities were measured as the content of biotinylated proteins that accumulated intracellularly. Human keratinocytes differentiated in the presence of 14,15-EET (2 μm) contained more biotinylated proteins at day 4 and day 6 of treatment compared with the vehicle (Fig. 2). The 14,15-EET regioisomer appeared more biologically active than 11,12-EET, suggesting that keratinocytes discriminate between structurally similar CYP2B19 metabolites. The 14,15-EET Epoxygenase P450 BM3v Activates Keratinocyte Transglutaminases—We examined whether keratinocyte transglutaminases were activated by 14,15-EET biosynthesized by an epoxygenase overexpressed in epidermal keratinocytes. We infected proliferating cells with adenovirus particles expressing P450 BM3v (Ad-BM3v), a self-sufficient 14S,15R-EET epoxygenase, and induced differentiation immediately after virus removal (day 0). P450 BM3v was detectable by Western immunoblotting for 3 weeks in transduced human keratinocytes (not shown). As controls, we infected keratinocytes with a β-galactosidase-expressing control virus (Ad-βgal) or no virus (mock). In human keratinocytes, Ad-BM3v increased in situ transglutaminase activities, compared with controls (Fig. 3A). Like 14,15-EET (Fig. 2), transglutaminase activation was apparent within 4 days. At day 4, the content of biotinylated proteins in P450 BM3v-expressing keratinocytes averaged ∼8-fold greater (p = 0.01; n = 5), compared with mock cultures (Fig. 4A). At day 4 and day 6, endogenous 14,15-EET in the P450 BM3v-expressing keratinocytes averaged ∼25–37-fold greater (p = 0.002), compared with controls (Fig. 4B). No differences were observed among treatments in the levels of endogenous 8,9-plus 11,12-EET. These data show that P450 BM3v was catalytically active and generated 14,15-EET from endogenous arachidonic acid in the differentiating keratinocytes. The increased 14,15-EET formation could explain the increased cross-linking activities in P450 BM3v-expressing cells.Fig. 4Human keratinocytes expressing P450 BM3v formed more 14,15-EET and more biotinylated proteins, whether biotinylated cadaverine or norbiotinamine was used as substrate. Human keratinocytes were treated as described in Fig. 3. Biotinylated cadaverine was the substrate for the in situ transglutaminase assays, except in C and D, where norbiotinamine or biotinylated lysine is indicated. Biotinylated proteins were quantified by ELISA (A 450/μg of protein) and expressed as percentages of the mock control values (A and C) or as normalized absorbance values (D). Endogenous EETs were measured by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (B). M, mock; B, Ad-BM3v; G, Ad-βgal; d4, day 4; d6, day 6. Results of statistical analyses (one-tailed t tests) were the following: A, on day 4, M versus B, p = 0.013; M versus G,"

This information is important for understanding the conformational changes GrpE undergoes on binding to DnaK. Nascent proteins in the cell sometimes require the assistance of one or more protein complexes named molecular chaperones to fold correctly (1Martin J. Hartl F.U. Curr. Opin. Struct.

The Hsp70 affinity for unfolded proteins is regulated by nucleotide binding to its nucleotide binding domain (NBD), which has a molecular mass of about 45 kDa (5Gething M.J. Sambrook J.

The Hsp70 C terminus forms the substrate binding domain (SBD), which is capable of binding hydrophobic amino acid residues and has a molecular mass of about 20 kDa (8Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C.

J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 25-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of GrpE in the Hsp70 chaperone machinery is shown by the following: it is essential for bacterial viability at all temperatures (14Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar), GrpE acts as an exchange factor that releases nucleotides bound to DnaK (12Szabo A. Langer T. Schroder H. Flanagan J. Bukau B. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10345-10349Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), and it is important for DnaK recycling (11Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). The first indication that GrpE was a homodimer came from cross-linking studies with glutaraldehyde (15Osipiuk J. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4821-4827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, analytical ultracentrifugation experiments (16Schönfeld H.J. Schmidt D. Schröder H. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2183-2189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) showed that GrpE has a dimeric structure with an elongated shape that binds DnaK with 2:1 stoichiometry. The crystallographic high resolution structure of residues 34–197 of Escherichia coli GrpE (EcGrpE34–197) complexed with the E. coli DnaK-NBD (EcDnaK3–383) corroborates that GrpE forms a dimer and shows that only one of the subunits, known as the proximal monomer, binds to Hsp70 (17Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F.U. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). In this structure, the GrpE dimer is asymmetric because the proximal monomer adopts a more open conformation than the distal monomer. Knowing whether this asymmetric conformation remains while GrpE is free in solution is necessary for understanding this protein structure-function relationship in the cell. The GrpE C-terminal domain, EcGrpE141–197, is β-structured and binds to the DnaK-NBD causing the release of ADP from the NBD (17Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F.U. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The function of the GrpE N terminus remains to be understood fully. The GrpE40–86 domain forms a long coil-coiled α-helical structure (17Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F.U. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) and may function as a thermosensor because it appears to be responsible for the GrpE thermal transition at physiological temperatures (18Gelinas A.D. Langsetmo K. Toth J. Bethoney K.A. Stafford W.F. Harrison C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). GrpE appears to be the only component of the Hsp70 chaperone machinery which undergoes a thermal transition at a physiologically relevant temperature (19Grimshaw J.P. Jelesarov I. Schönfeld H.J. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6098-6104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The GrpE89–137 domain forms a four-helix bundle (17Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F.U. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) and likely acts as the stabilization center for dimerization (18Gelinas A.D. Langsetmo K. Toth J. Bethoney K.A. Stafford W.F. Harrison C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). GrpE is present in eukaryotes (20Naylor D.J. Stines A.P. Hoogenraad N.J.

Biol. 2001; 24: 85-92Crossref Google Scholar), and it is generally assumed that they share high structural similarity with their prokaryote homologs. Thus, it is important to characterize the structure and function of GrpE from diverse organisms to test this hypothesis. The sequence of human mitochondrial GrpE (23Choglay A.A. Chapple J.P. Blatch G.L. Cheetham M.E. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 267: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) is represented in Fig. 1 along with the E. coli GrpE sequence showing that they share about 30% identity. The mitochondrial form of human GrpE is expressed as an immature protein that matures when its mitochondrial signaling peptide is lost. Human GrpE was cloned and expressed in E. coli and purified by ion exchange chromatography and preparative molecular exchange chromatography. The secondary structure characterized by circular dichroism (CD) showed that the protein is folded. Temperature-induced unfolding followed either by CD or by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that human GrpE unfolding is only partially reversible, whereas E. coli GrpE exhibits reversible unfolding up to 60 °C (19Grimshaw J.P. Jelesarov I. Schönfeld H.J. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6098-6104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Analytical ultracentrifugation data indicate that the protein has the molecular mass of a dimer, and the calculated sedimentation coefficient agrees with the value expected for a protein with an elongated shape. The elongated shape was also derived independently from small angle x-ray scattering analysis (SAXS). The hydrodynamic parameters derived from SAXS data agree with those determined by analytical ultracentrifugation. Our envelope models are similar to the envelope of the crystallographic structure of E. coli GrpE bound to the DnaKNBD determined by Harrison et al. (17Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F.U. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The low resolution structure generated from our SAXS data in solution suggests that GrpE is a symmetric dimer when not bound to DnaK. The implications of our conclusions concerning human GrpE conformational changes in structure-function relationships of this co-chaperone are discussed. Cloning, Expression, and Purification—The human cDNA IMAGE clone (GenBank accession number BE614754) was used for cloning the mitochondrial GrpE (Mt-GrpE#1, GenBank accession number Q9HAV7). Two primers were used to amplify the cDNA by PCR and to create the restriction enzyme sites NdeI and XhoI for cloning into pET23a vector (Novagen). The 5′-primer (5′-TCTCCCCGGCATATGTGCACAG-3′) containing the NdeI restriction site was designed to anneal downstream to the mitochondrial peptide signal, eliminating this sequence in the recombinant protein. The correct cloning was confirmed by DNA sequencing using an ABI 377 Prism system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). These procedures created the pET23aHMGrpE#1 vector, which was transformed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) for protein expression by adding 0.4 mmol/liter isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside at A 600 = 0.8. The induced cells were grown for 5 h and harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 2,600 × g. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mmol/liter KCl, 10 mmol/liter EDTA, 15 ml/liter medium), disrupted by sonication in an ice bath, and centrifuged as described above. The supernatant was dialyzed against equilibration buffer (25 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmol/liter DTT) and then submitted to ion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose resin using an ÄKTA FPLC (Amersham Biosciences). Human GrpE was eluted in 100 mmol/liter NaCl, dialyzed against the second equilibration buffer (25 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 1 mmol/liter DTT) and loaded on a HiLoad Superdex 200pg molecular exclusion column using an ÄKTA FPLC. The degree of purification of human GrpE was estimated by SDS-PAGE (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and its concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using the calculated extinction coefficient for denatured proteins (25Edelhock H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar, 26Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—CD measurements were recorded on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter with temperature controlled by Peltier Type Control System PFD 425S. Human GrpE was resuspended in 10 mmol/liter phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and 1 mmol/liter β-mercaptoethanol at a final concentration of 20 μmol/liter. Data were collected at a scanning rate of 50 nm/min with spectral band width of 1 nm using a 1-mm path length cell at increasing temperatures (for details, see Fig. 3 legend). CDNN Deconvolution software (version 2; Bioinformatik.biochemtech.uni-halle.dee/cdnn) was employed for secondary structure prediction. All buffers used were of chemical grade and were filtered before use to avoid scattering from small particles. DSC—The measurements of human GrpE thermal denaturation were done both in an N-DSC III differential scanning calorimeter (Calorimetry Sciences Corp.) and in a VP-DSC Differential Scanning Calorimeter (MicroCal), which gave similar results. The measurements were performed with protein concentrations of 7, 45, and 130 μmol/liter and in two sets of buffers; 25 mmol/liter Hepes pH 7.6, 50 mmol/liter KCl, 5 mmol/liter MgCl2; and 25 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, 150–500 mmol/liter NaCl, 1 mmol/liter β-mercaptoethanol. The scan rate was varied from 0.5 to 1.5 °C/min, and the temperature measurement range was from 10 to 100 °C. The reversibility of unfolding was tested by performing several consecutive up and down scans and by scan rate variation. Base lines were run several times in all of the conditions mentioned above. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed with a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. The protein was tested in concentrations of 50, 100, and 200 μg/ml in 25 mmol/liter Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.5, with 150 mmol/liter NaCl and 0.5 mmol/liter DTT, with no apparent aggregation. The sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out at 20 °C, 40,000 rpm (AN-60Ti rotor), and the scan data acquisition was taken at 230 nm. The sedimentation equilibrium experiments were made at 20 °C at speeds of 7,000, 9,000, and 11,000 rpm using the AN-60Ti rotor. Scan data acquisition was done at 230 nm. The analysis involved fitting a model of absorbance versus cell radius data by nonlinear regression. All fits were done with the ORIGIN software package (MicroCal Software) supplied with the instrument. The van Holde-Weischet (27van Holde K.E. Weischet W.O. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1397-1403Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar) (sediment coefficient plot), Second Moment (28Goldberg R.J. J. Phys. Chem. 1953; 57: 194-202Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and the Sedimentation Time Derivative (g(s*) integral distribution) (29Stafford W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 478-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) methods were used to analyze the sedimentation velocity experiments. The methods used for analyzing both velocity and equilibrium experiments allow the calculation of the apparent sedimentation coefficient s, the diffusion coefficient D, and the molecular weight M. The ratio of the sedimentation to diffusion coefficient gives the molecular weight; M=sRTD(1-Vbarρ)(Eq. 1) R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. The software Sednterp (www.jphilo.mailway.com/download.htm) was used to estimate protein partial specific volume (Vbar = 0.7432 ml/g), buffer density (ρ = 1.0052 g/ml), and buffer viscosity (η = 0.01poise). The Self-association method was used to analyze the sedimentation equilibrium experiments using several models of association for human GrpE to fit the data. The distribution of the protein along the cell, obtained in the equilibrium sedimentation experiments, was fitted with the Equation 2 (30Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), C=C0expM(1-Vbarρ)ω2(r2-r0)2RT(Eq. 2) where C is the protein concentration at radial position r, C 0 is the protein concentration at radial position r 0, and ω is the centrifugal angular velocity. SAXS—Small angle x-ray scattering experiments were performed at the SAS beam line of the LNLS synchrotron radiation facility, Campinas, Brazil (31Kellermann G. Vicentin F. Tamura E. Rocha M. Tolentino H. Barbosa A. Craievich A. Torriani I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 880-883Crossref Google Scholar). Measurements were make with a monochromatic x-ray beam with a wavelength λ = 1.488 Å for a sample-detector distance of 840 mm covering the momentum transfer range 0.01 < q < 0.44 Å-1 (q = 4πsinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle). The scattering intensity was recorded using a one-dimensional position-sensitive x-ray detector. The scattering curves produced by the protein solutions of either 5.0 or 19.4 mg/ml and of the solvent (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mmol/liter DTT) were collected in many short (90 s) frames to monitor radiation damage and beam stability. The data were normalized to account for the natural decay in intensity of the synchrotron incident beam and corrected for inhomogeneous detector response. The scattering intensity produced by the buffer was subtracted, and the difference curves were scaled to equivalent protein concentration. To determine the molecular mass of human GrpE, a 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (66 kDa) solution was used as a standard. The molecular mass of human GrpE was inferred from the ratio of the extrapolated I(0) value of human GrpE to that of bovine serum albumin. Because there was no negative region in the pair distribution function, we can safely conclude that all solutions studied were in the “dilute” state, i.e. no interferences of scattering amplitudes were produced by the interaction of different isolated scattering objects. Models and Computer Programs—The distance distribution function p(r) and the radius of gyration R g of the human GrpE protein were evaluated from the corrected and normalized SAXS curves by the indirect Fourier transform program GNOM (32Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2987) Google Scholar, 33Svergun D.I. Stuhrmann H.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 736-744Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A constant was subtracted from the experimental data to ensure that the intensity at higher angles decayed as q –4 following Porod's law for a two-electron density model (34Porod G. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small-angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, London1982: 17-51Google Scholar). The value of the constant was derived automatically from the outer part of the curve using a linear fit to q 4I(q) versus q4 plots by the shape determination program DAMMIN (35Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar), which will be described later. This procedure reduces the contribution from scattering because of the short range fluctuations of the internal protein structure and yields an approximation of the “shape scattering curve” (i.e. the scattering intensity produced by the excluded volume of a particle with a spatially constant density). The low resolution shape of GrpE was obtained from the experimental SAXS data with an ab initio method implemented in DAMMIN (34Porod G. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small-angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, London1982: 17-51Google Scholar). A sphere of diameter D max was filled by a regular grid of points corresponding to a dense hexagonal packing of small spheres (dummy atoms) of radius r 0 ≪ D max. The structure of the dummy atom model (DAM) is defined by a configuration X, assigning an index to each atom corresponding to solvent {0} or solute particle {1}. The computed scattering intensity curve of the DAM is compared with the intensity curve determined experimentally and the model is progressively modified by successive minimization trials of a function f(X) defined as follows, f(X)=χ2+αP(X)(Eq. 3) where χ is the discrepancy between the experimental and modeled SAXS intensity functions given by the following, χ=1N-1∑j=1NI(qj)-Iexp(qj)σ(qj)2(Eq. 4) where N is the number of experimental points, I exp(qj) is the experimental intensity, and σ(qj) is the standard deviation in the jth point. In Equation 3, α is a positive constant, and P(X) is an added penalty function that avoids solutions with loose bounds or disconnected structures. The DAMMIN program searches for a compact interconnected configuration χ, minimizing the function f(X) defined by Equation 3. Starting from the initial configuration corresponding to a sphere with a radius r = D max/2, where D max is the maximum diameter determined by the GNOM program, filled with small spheres (dummy atoms) with r 0 ≪ R, a simulated annealing algorithm is employed for the minimization procedure (35Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). DAMMIN finally generates the best structure model containing a fraction of the initial small dummy atoms and also yields the SAXS intensity of the resulting model. The coordinate set of positions for E. coli GrpE was obtained from Protein Data Bank (1DKG) (17Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F.U. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Relative positions of the domains were found with an automated procedure that iteratively rotates their envelope functions to minimize the discrepancy with the ab initio low resolution structure. The models were displayed using the program MASSHA (36Konarev P.V. Petoukhov M.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 527-532Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). R g, maximum intraparticle distances (D max), envelope functions, and scattering curves were calculated from these atomic coordinates by the CRYSOL program taking into account the influence of the hydration shell (37Svergun D. Barberato C. Koch M.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2790) Google Scholar). SUPCOMB (38Kozin M.B. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 33-41Crossref Scopus (1093) Google Scholar) was used to superimpose ab initio low resolution models onto crystallographic structures. The HydroPro program (39Garcia de la Torre J. Huertas M.L. Carrasco B. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 719-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar) was used to estimate the translational diffusion coefficient Dt , the R g, the sedimentation coefficient s, and tip-to-tip distance from the ab initio model generated by SAXS data at 20 °C. The HydroPro software was set up with radius of the atomic elements of 3.5 (from ab initio development), sigma factors from 5 to 8 (as indicate by supplier) and minibeads radius (SIGMIN and SIGMAX) from 6 to 2 Å after initial evaluation of the two extremes. The parameters Vbar, ρ, and η were estimated using the software Sednterp (www.jphilo.mailway.com/download.htm). The translational friction ratio or Perrin factor P, which indicates the relation of the frictional coefficient of the human GrpE particle to a sphere of the same molecular weight (f/f 0), was estimated by Solpro software (40Garcia de la Torre J. Carrasco B. Harding S.E. Eur. Biophys. J. 1997; 25: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The SWISS-MODEL program (41Guex N. Peitsch M.C.

Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 658-660Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar) was used for modeling the human GrpE by homology with the crystal structure of E. coli GrpE (residues 34–197) (17Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F.U. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) as the model for human GrpE48–191 (residues 48–191). The program PredictProtein (44Baldi P. Brunak S. Frasconi P. Pollastri G. Soda G. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) was used to estimate the secondary structure of the N-terminal region (1–50 amino acids) of human GrpE, which was missing in the model generated by the SWISS-MODEL program. The N-terminal and its respective secondary structure prediction were loaded on software HyperChem (www.hallogram.com/index.html) for modeling and geometry optimization. This N-terminal model was then linked to the initial model (human Grp-E48–191) generated by SWISS-MODEL program and fitted in the bead model generated from SAXS data. After geometry optimization this whole model was analyzed in terms of tip-to-tip distance, radius of gyration, diffusion and sedimentation coefficients, and Perrin factor prediction using the HydroPro software simulating the same conditions as the experimental data were obtained. Cloning, Expression, and Purification—Human and E. coli GrpE amino acid sequences are shown in Fig. 1 for comparison, the two proteins have about 53% similarity and 30% identity. During the cloning of the human GrpE cDNA two sequence changes were made to allow recombinant expression of the functional protein in strain BL21(DE3). First, the cDNA 5′-sequence that codes for the mitochondrial peptide signal sequence was deleted. In human cells this peptide is removed from the protein when it reaches the mitochondria, but the bacterial host does not have the machinery to make this deletion. Without this modification, our expressed recombinant GrpE would have an N-terminal portion that is not present in the mitochondrial GrpE. This change causes the first residue in the mature protein to be leucine, which is not recognized as a start codon by strain BL21(DE3), thus the second change replaced this codon for a methionine codon. DNA sequencing confirmed the correct cloning and sequence of this mutated cDNA (data not shown). Human GrpE was expressed in a soluble state and in large amount, and the purification procedure resulted in a single protein band with the expected molecular mass (21.5 kDa) in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). Purified human GrpE shows no sign of impurities or degradation, is soluble (even in water), and folded (see below). Secondary Structure Analysis by CD and Thermal Analysis—CD spectropolarimetry was used to assess the protein secondary structure content as a function of temperature (Fig. 3, a and b). Analysis of the global shape of the far UV CD spectra indicates that human GrpE is folded and soluble, allowing measurements down to near 180 nm. The far UV CD spectrum shows characteristics of a highly α-helical protein, and analysis by the CDNN Deconvolution software indicates that about 55% of the protein is in this form (Fig. 3a). The CDNN software used the whole spectrum from 260 to 180 nm for secondary structure analysis, thus the calculation benefits from the good CD signal at low wavelengths. Increasing temperature causes the protein to unfold; there is a slight change in the CD signal at 222 nm from 4 to 50 °C and a more accentuated change above 50 °C (Fig. 3b). This temperature dependence is verified by DSC, the protein started to unfold at about 50 °C (Fig. 4). The unfolding of human GrpE is not completely reversible even if the protein is heated to only 50 °C as shown by both CD and DSC experiments (Figs. 3b and 4). The unfolding measured by DSC shows at least two unfolding events, one with a mi"
https://openalex.org/W2088514972,"The interactions of χ-conopeptide MrIA with the human norepinephrine transporter (hNET) were investigated by determining the effects of hNET point mutations on the inhibitory potency of MrIA. The mutants were produced by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in COS-7 cells. The potency of MrIA was greater for inhibition of uptake by hNET of [3H]norepinephrine (K i 1.89 μm) than [3H]dopamine (K i 4.33 μm), and the human dopamine transporter and serotonin transporter were not inhibited by MrIA (to 7 μm). Of 18 mutations where hNET amino acid residues were exchanged with those of the human dopamine transporter, MrIA had increased potency for inhibition of [3H]norepinephrine uptake for three mutations (in predicted extracellular loops 3 and 4 and transmembrane domain (TMD) 8) and decreased potency for one mutation (in TMD6 and intracellular loop (IL) 3). Of the 12 additional mutations in TMDs 2, 4, 5, and 11 and IL1, three mutations (in TMD2 and IL1) had reduced MrIA inhibitory potency. All of the other mutations tested had no influence on MrIA potency. A comparison of the results with previous data for desipramine and cocaine inhibition of norepinephrine uptake by the mutant hNETs reveals that MrIA binding to hNET occurs at a site that is distinct from but overlaps with the binding sites for tricyclic antidepressants and cocaine.

Tricyclic antidepressants are competitive inhibitors of the NET, and this property contributes to their efficacy in the treatment of conditions such as depression (3Bönisch H. Brüss M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 733: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Studies on chimeras between the human NET (hNET) and the highly homologous dopamine transporter (DAT) have provided evidence that the sites involved in the selective inhibition by the tricyclic antidepressants of NET relative to DAT involves the region spanning transmembrane domains (TMDs) 6-8 of the putative 12 TMD topology predicted for these transporters (4Buck K.J. Amara S.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 1030-1037PubMed Google Scholar, 5Giros B. Wang Y.-M. Suter S. McLeskey S.B. Pifl C. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15985-15988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, interactions of tricyclic antidepressants with the NET have been further investigated in a study in which point mutations were introduced into the region spanning TMDs 6-8 of hNET by replacing amino acids in hNET with those found in human DAT (hDAT) (6Roubert C.

It was also shown that the identified sites are not important determinants of substrate transport (6Roubert C. Cox P.J. Brüss M. Hamon M. Bönisch H. Giros B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8254-8260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, TMDs 6-8 are not the only regions important for determining tricyclic antidepressant interactions with the NET. Point mutations of other amino acids in TMDs 2 and 5 and in the first IL of the hNET have also been shown to cause reductions in the affinities for the NET of tricyclic antidepressants, and in some cases, of cocaine (7Paczkowski F.A.

Recently, the χ-conopeptide MrIA, isolated from Conus marmoreus, has been identified to be a non-competitive inhibitor of [3H]norepinephrine uptake by the NET (13Sharpe I.A. Gehrmann J. Loughnan M.L.

This activity contrasts with the competitive inhibition of NET transport of norepinephrine by tricyclic antidepressants. In the present study, we investigate MrIA binding to hNET by examining the influence on the inhibitory potency of MrIA of point mutations in regions that have been proposed to be involved in determining the affinity of the tricyclic antidepressants for the hNET (see Fig. 1) (6Roubert C.

The results of this study have implications for NET structure/function relationships, which are presently poorly defined. Chemicals—(-)-[ring-2,5,6-3H]Norepinephrine (NET-678, 1917 Bq/pmol), [ring-2,5,6-3H]dopamine (NET-673, 2190 Bq/pmol), and [1,2-3H(N)]5-hydroxytryptamine creatinine sulfate ([3H]5-HT, NET-498, 888 Bq/pmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The χ-conopeptide MrIA (supplied by Xenome Ltd, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia) was obtained by solid phase peptide synthesis and purified by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography to >95% purity as previously described (13Sharpe I.A.

The drugs used in the study were as follows:1-{2-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)methoxy]ethyl}-4-(3-phenylpropyl)piperazine dihydrochloride (GBR12909, Research Biochemicals Incorporated, Natick, MA); 3′,4′-dihydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone (U-0521, donated by Pharmacia and Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI); dopamine hydrochloride (Sigma); 5-HT creatinine sulfate (Sigma); nisoxetine hydrochloride (donated by Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN), norepinephrine bipartite (Sigma), pargyline hydrochloride (Sigma), and paroxetine hydrochloride (donated by GlaxoSmithKline, Uxbridge, Middlesex, United Kingdom). Stock solutions of 2.5 mm χ-MrIA (MrIA-NH2) were prepared in water, quantitated by amino acid analysis, and stored at -20 °C in polypropylene tubes. Stock solutions of norepinephrine (10 mm), 5-HT (10 mm), and dopamine (100 mm) were prepared in 10 mm HCl, and stock solutions of U-0521 (1 mm), GBR12909 (100 μm), and all of the other drugs (10 mm) were prepared in water. All of the dilutions were prepared on the day of the experiment in Krebs/HEPES buffer (composition in mm: NaCl 125, KCl 4.8, MgSO4 1.2, KH2PO4 1.2, CaCl2 1.3, HEPES 25, glucose 5.55, ascorbic acid 1.02, U-0521 0.005 (to inhibit catechol-O-methyltransferase), and pargyline 0.001 (to inhibit monoamine oxidase), pH 7.4) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 (SV40-transformed African Green monkey kidney cells, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere on standard plastic cultureware in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) to obtain complete medium. COS-7 cells were subcultured onto 12-well culture plates. The cells were transiently transfected with the cDNA of hNET (donated by Professor S. Amara, Vollum Institute, Portland, OR), hDAT (donated by Professor M. Caron, Duke University, Durham, NC), human serotonin transporter (hSERT, donated by Professor R.

Uptake Assays—Culture medium was removed from the transiently transfected COS-7 cells, and they were then washed twice with 1 ml of Krebs/HEPES buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C. The cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with 0.5 ml of Krebs/HEPES buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin in the absence or presence of 0.07-21.3 μm MrIA and inhibitors to determine nonspecific uptake (1 or 10 μm nisoxetine for wild type and mutant hNETs, 1 μm GBR12909 for hDAT, or 1 μm paroxetine for hSERT). [3H]Norepinephrine, [3H]dopamine, or [3H]5-HT (10 nm) was then added for 2 min. The cells were washed three times with Krebs/HEPES buffer at 0 °C and lysed (750 μl of 0.1% Triton X-100 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 37 °C for 60 min). Determination of the protein content by the Lowry method (17Lowry O. Rosebrough N. Farr A. Randall R. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was carried out on duplicate samples of 75 μl of the lysate, and the 3H content of 500 μl of the lysate was determined by the addition of 1.5 ml of Starscint scintillation medium (Packard, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) and liquid scintillation counting. Samples (50 μl) of the [3H] solutions were taken to determine the specific activity of the incubation solutions. Data Analysis—[3H]Amine uptake was calculated using the results of the Lowry protein determination and the liquid scintillation counting. Specific uptake of [3H]amine was calculated as the difference between uptake in the absence (total uptake) and presence (nonspecific uptake) of nisoxetine, GBR12909, or paroxetine as appropriate. IC50 values for inhibition of [3H]norepinephrine or [3H]dopamine uptake by MrIA and the Hill slopes for the curves were calculated by non-linear regression analyses of data for percentage inhibition of specific [3H]norepinephrine or [3H]dopamine uptake versus log drug concentration for each individual experiment according to a sigmoidal model (Prism 3, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The IC50 value for MrIA is equal to its K i value (18Cheng Y. Prusoff W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12293) Google Scholar), because MrIA is a non-competitive inhibitor of norepinephrine uptake by hNET (13Sharpe I.A. Gehrmann J. Loughnan M.L. Thomas L. Adams D.A. Atkins A. Palant E. Craik D.J. Adams D.J. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 902-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Arithmetic means ± S.E. or geometric means and 95% confidence limits of uptake data or kinetic parameters were calculated as indicated under “Results.” Hill slopes were compared with a slope of 1.0 using the Student's t test (Instat 3, GraphPad). The significance of differences between values was determined by one factor analysis of variance (ANOVA, repeated measures where appropriate) followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison tests (Prism 3) on absolute or log data or by Student's t test as indicated under “Results.” Selective Inhibition of hNET by MrlA—The uptake of [3H]norepinephrine and [3H]dopamine by hNET was determined in the presence of increasing concentrations of MrIA (Fig. 2). The inhibition curves had Hill slopes that were not significantly different from 1. The K i value of MrIA obtained from these data with norepinephrine as substrate (1.89 μm, 95% confidence limits: 1.76, 2.02 μm, n = 5) was significantly less (p < 0.001) than that with dopamine as substrate (4.33 μm, 95% confidence limits: 3.55, 5.43 μm, n = 4). MrIA, over the concentration range that caused up to 80% inhibition of [3H]norepinephrine uptake by hNET, had no effect on [3H]dopamine uptake by hDAT or on [3H]5-HT uptake by hSERT (Fig. 2), confirming the lack of effect of MrIA at these related monoamine transporters. Influence of hNET Mutants on Inhibition of Norepinephrine Uptake by MrIA—COS-7 cells transiently expressing wild type hNET or hNET mutants were screened for inhibition of [3H]norepinephrine uptake by MrIA in three series of experiments. In view of the highly selective inhibition of hNET compared with hDAT by MrIA (Ref. 13Sharpe I.A. Gehrmann J. Loughnan M.L. Thomas L. Adams D.A. Atkins A. Palant E. Craik D.J. Adams D.J. Alewood P.F.

Neurosci. 2001; 4: 902-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar and this study), the first two series of experiments investigated the effects of mutations that resulted in amino acid exchanges of residues of the hNET to those of the hDAT in ELs 3 and 4, IL 3, and TMDs 5-8 (Fig. 3, A and B). Inhibition by MrIA was significantly greater than that of hNET for K303C (EL 3), E377G-E382D-A384P (EL 4), and S399P (TMD 8), less than that of hNET for F316C-D336T (mutations in TMD 6 and IL 3), and was the same as hNET for the other 13 mutations in these regions including the F316C and D336T point mutants and the double mutant S399PG400L (Fig. 3). In the third series of experiments using a different batch of MrIA, the effects of point mutations to alanine or other amino acids in TMDs 2, 4, 5, and 11 and in IL 1 on the inhibition of [3H]norepinephrine uptake by MrIA were investigated. These studies indicated that there was less inhibition of the mutant than that of wild type hNET by MrIA for L114A and L114S in TMD 2 and G123A in IL 1 (Fig. 4). No significant differences from hNET were observed for the remaining 10 mutants examined (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Inhibition of [3H]norepinephrine uptake by MrIA in COS-7 cells transiently expressing hNET or hNET with point mutations in IL 1 or TMDs 2, 4, 5, or 11.

The values for percentage inhibition of specific norepinephrine uptake by 0.355 μm MrIA are shown as arithmetic means ± S.E. (n = 3). The horizontal line shows the inhibition of hNET by MrIA.

The Hill slopes of the inhibition curves were not significantly different from 1 except for K303C, which showed a small increase. K i values of MrIA are also shown in Table I for the two mutants that showed significantly different inhibition by MrIA compared with hNET in Fig. 3B, and these values were calculated from the data in Fig. 3B, assuming a Hill slope of 1. The K i values of MrIA for inhibition of the seven mutant NETs all differed significantly from those for the inhibition of hNET with three mutations in ELs 3 and 4 and TMD 8, causing an increase in MrIA potency, and four mutations in IL 1, TMD 2, and TMD 6 + IL 3, causing a decrease in MrIA potency (Table I). In Table II, the effects of the point mutations of hNET on the inhibitory potency of MrIA are compared with their effects on the inhibitory potencies of desipramine (DMI) and cocaine and the apparent affinity of dopamine determined from previous studies in our laboratories.Table IKi values of MrIA for inhibition of norepinephrine uptake in COS-7 cells expressing wild type and mutant hNETshNET mutantnK i of MrIAHill slopeμ mhNET81.72 (1.51, 1.95)0.99 ± 0.04E377G-E382D-A384P30.77 (0.39, 1.52)ap < 0.001, for comparison of log K i values with the hNET control (one factor ANOVA, p < 0.001 followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison tests).K303C30.90 (0.72, 1.11)ap < 0.001, for comparison of log K i values with the hNET control (one factor ANOVA, p < 0.001 followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison tests).1.21 ± 0.03bp < 0.05, for comparison of Hill slope with 1 (Student's t test).S399P30.96 (0.87, 1.06)ap < 0.001, for comparison of log K i values with the hNET control (one factor ANOVA, p < 0.001 followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison tests).1.01 ± 0.13F316C-D336T32.82 (1.15, 6.92)ap < 0.001, for comparison of log K i values with the hNET control (one factor ANOVA, p < 0.001 followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison tests).G123A33.47 (2.23, 5.40)ap < 0.001, for comparison of log K i values with the hNET control (one factor ANOVA, p < 0.001 followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison tests).1.03 ± 0.19L114A35.05 (3.11, 8.21)ap < 0.001, for comparison of log K i values with the hNET control (one factor ANOVA, p < 0.001 followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison tests).0.96 ± 0.08L114S316.7 (16.0, 17.5)ap < 0.001, for comparison of log K i values with the hNET control (one factor ANOVA, p < 0.001 followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison tests).1.24 ± 0.10a p < 0.001, for comparison of log K i values with the hNET control (one factor ANOVA, p < 0.001 followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison tests).b p < 0.05, for comparison of Hill slope with 1 (Student's t test).

Ther. 1999; 290: 761-767PubMed Google Scholar), MrIA was more potent as an inhibitor of norepinephrine uptake than as an inhibitor of dopamine uptake by hNET. It appears that the potency of MrIA inhibition of hNET is influenced by the nature of the amine being transported. One possible explanation of these results could be that the binding of MrIA is linked to NET gating, which is more efficiently modulated by norepinephrine than dopamine as indicated, for example, by the higher maximal rate of transport of norepinephrine than dopamine (7Paczkowski F.A. Bryan-Lluka L.J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 97: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 19Graefe K.-H. Bönisch H. Trendelenburg U. Weiner N. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology.

However, the data from the current study do not provide conclusive evidence for this proposal. To identify where MrIA acts on NET, we examined the effect of exchanging residues that differ between NET and DAT on the potency of MrIA inhibition. Because MrIA is a non-competitive inhibitor of norepinephrine uptake by hNET (13Sharpe I.A. Gehrmann J. Loughnan M.L. Thomas L. Adams D.A. Atkins A. Palant E. Craik D.J. Adams D.J. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 902-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) but a competitive inhibitor of tricyclic antidepressant binding to the NET (26Sharpe I.A. Palant E. Schroeder C.I. Kaye D.M. Adams D.J. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40317-40323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we specifically examined whether MrIA and tricyclic antidepressant binding sites overlapped by determining the influence on MrIA potency of substituting amino acid residues in TMDs 5-8 of hNET with their corresponding residues from hDAT. This region of the NET has been recognized in NET/DAT chimera studies as being responsible for the translocation of substrates and cosubstrates (4Buck K.J. Amara S.G. Mol.

Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1404-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and specific residues in TMDs 6 and 7 have recently been identified to contribute to the binding of tricyclic antidepressants (6Roubert C. Cox P.J. Brüss M. Hamon M. Bönisch H. Giros B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8254-8260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The simplest explanation of the competitive inhibition of norepinephrine uptake by tricyclic antidepressants but non-competitive inhibition by MrIA is that the MrIA binding site may be partially overlapping the tricyclic antidepressant binding site but separate from the site of interaction of substrates with the NET. The separation of conotoxin, substrate, and tricyclic antidepressant binding sites on the NET is further supported by the finding that several hNET mutations, including G117A, G123A, F316C-D336T, and the mutations of T268 and Y271, resulted in differing effects on the apparent affinities of the conotoxin, MrIA, the tricyclic antidepressant, DMI, and the substrate, dopamine (Table II). A comparison of the influence of 30 mutations of the hNET on MrIA, DMI, and cocaine potencies and on the apparent affinity of dopamine is given in Table II. Of the mutants examined, 23 had no effect on MrIA potency. 11 of these mutants also had no influence on DMI or cocaine potency, and 16 had no influence on the apparent affinity of dopamine, including 12 mutants that did not change the potencies of any of the tested compounds. Of the remaining mutants, only the L114A and L114S mutants in TMD 2 concomitantly reduced (3-10-fold) the potencies of MrIA, DMI, and cocaine but these mutations caused increases in the apparent affinity of dopamine. In contrast, the G123A mutation in IL 1 caused a 2-3-fold reduction in MrIA and cocaine potencies but had no effect on DMI potency and caused a similar increase in apparent affinity of dopamine. The double mutant F316C-D336T in TMD 6/IL 3 caused a small (1.6-fold) reduction in MrIA potency but a more marked reduction in DMI potency and no effect on that of cocaine or on the apparent affinity of dopamine. Surprisingly, three other mutations (K303C in EL 3, S399P in TMD 8, and E377G-E382D-A384P in EL 4) enhanced MrIA potency by ∼2-fold without having any effect on DMI or cocaine potency or dopamine apparent affinity. The five TMD 5 mutations were of particular interest in that they had no influence on MrIA potency, reduced both DMI and cocaine potencies, and increased the apparent affinity of dopamine compared with hNET. These results confirm previous findings that the binding sites for substrates, DMI, and cocaine are overlapping but not identical (6Roubert C. Cox P.J. Brüss M. Hamon M. Bönisch H. Giros B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8254-8260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Paczkowski F.A. Bryan-Lluka L.J. Brain Res. Mol.

Brain Res. 2002; 108: 40-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and support the idea that the MrIA binding sites are also not identical to but show some overlap with those for NET substrates and inhibitors. The non-competitive inhibition of norepinephrine transport by MrIA, which is a polar and positively charged peptide, indicates that MrIA binds to an allosteric binding site located in the extracellular region of the NET and that this binding does not change the affinity of norepinephrine for the NET but reduces its rate of translocation from outside to inside. Two mutants in EL 3 and EL 4 (K303C and E377G-E382D-A384, respectively) enhanced MrIA binding, suggesting that MrIA binding spans these loops which are within the region between TMD 6 and TMD 8 proposed to be involved in the substrate translocation process (20Buck K.J. Amara S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12584-12588Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Two models have been proposed to explain substrate transport by Na+-dependent monoamine transporters such as the NET. In the “alternating model”, binding of norepinephrine (and the cosubstrates Na+ and Cl-) leads to a conformational change of the NET enabling release of norepinephrine (and the cosubstrates) from the transporter on the inside of the membrane. The empty carrier then turns outward to complete the transport cycle (see Refs. 22Harder R. Bönisch H. J. Neurochem. 1985; 45: 1154-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar and 23Bönisch H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 259-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This model implies that the NET forms a type of channel that is closed on one side and is open on the other side. Recently, an open-channel model for coupled substrate and Na+ transport by the Na+-dependent monoamine neurotransmitter transporters, such as NET and SERT, has been proposed based on the assumption that the transporters form a long narrow pore enabling translocation analogous to single-file diffusion (24DeFelice L.J. Adams S.V. Ypey D.L. Biosystems. 2001; 62: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). If EL 3 and EL 4 form part of the extracellular section of such a pore, non-competitive inhibition of norepinephrine transport by MrIA could be explained if MrIA occludes the pore of the channel. Leucine 114 in TMD 2, close to its junction with IL 1, also influences MrIA (and DMI and cocaine) potency for inhibition of hNET. If pore occlusion is indeed the mechanism by which MrIA inhibits substrate transport by hNET, the pore needs to be of sufficient size to allow MrIA to enter the pore at a sufficient distance to be influenced by amino acid residues in the intracellular part of this TMD. The results of this study show that MrIA interacts with hNET mostly at residues that differ from those where DMI and cocaine bind. Thus, the competitive inhibition of tricyclic antidepressant binding by MrIA (26Sharpe I.A. Palant E. Schroeder C.I. Kaye D.M. Adams D.J. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40317-40323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) most probably occurs via steric overlap with DMI and MrIA interacting at distinct sites on the NET, but the binding of DMI precludes MrIA access, and vice versa. That MrIA and tricyclic antidepressants have separate binding sites is not unexpected given the differences in the mode of action of these two classes of inhibitor for inhibition of noradrenaline uptake (non-competitive and competitive, respectively). Additional interactions remain to be identified to explain fully how MrIA binds to the NET without interacting at DAT. Additional interacting residues are also likely to account for a 25-fold selectivity gap between the affinities of DMI for NET and DAT, presently unexplained by the data obtained with NET mutants (6Roubert C. Cox P.J. Brüss M. Hamon M. Bönisch H. Giros B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8254-8260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Identification of these interacting residues may reveal additional regions of overlap among MrIA, DMI, cocaine, and substrate binding sites and perhaps reveal additional structural features that are important for the function of the NET.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 6171-6177PubMed Google Scholar), and iron provides a link between Nramp1 and the differential regulation of iNos. If the genetic regulation of iNos, through allelic Nramp1, also occurs at the level of transcription factors such as NF-IL6, then it could be hypothesized that cytosolic iron levels are decreased in functional Nramp1 allele compared with non-functional allele cells. This of course assumes that transcription factors will sense iron within the cytosol rather than the lumen of an intracellular vesicle into which Nramp1 pumps divalent cations. Analyses of iron regulatory protein-1/2 activities and iron-regulated gene expression in RAW264.7 cells and Nramp1G169 transfectants support this concept (8Baker S.T. Barton C.H. Biggs T.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), as does work by Beaumont (18Beaumont, C.

Barton C.H. Biggs T.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As Nramp1 expression is positively modulated by divalent cations and redox stress, we proposed a negative autoregulatory control mechanism. Our more recent work has been directed to studies on the Nramp1 promoter (19Bowen H. Biggs T.E. Baker S.T. Phillips E. Perry V.H. Mann D.A. Barton C.H. Biochem. Soc.

Previously, we reported that the murine Nramp1 gene is under negative control of c-Myc (19Bowen H. Biggs T.E. Baker S.T. Phillips E. Perry V.H. Mann D.A. Barton C.H. Biochem. Soc.

Vidal S. Cellier M. Lepage P. Malo D. Gros P. Genomics. 1995; 27: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) as the target sequence for this repression activity. The repression of Nramp1 by c-Myc is consistent with our earlier studies (8Baker S.T. Barton C.H. Biggs T.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and work of others (7Kuhn D.E. Baker B.D. Lafuse W.P. Zwilling B.S. J.

Studies also revealed that Nramp1 antagonizes cellular proliferation, as ectopic Nramp1 expression reduces growth rates by an iron-dependent mechanism (20Bowen H. Biggs T.E. Phillips E. Baker S.T.

Hänel F. Eilers M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5672-5686Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), indicate that gene repression mediated by c-Myc, for cell cycle progression, occurs through its interaction with Miz-1. Miz-1 has 13 zinc fingers and binds at some initiator elements to positively regulate gene expression (29Peukert K. Staller P. Schneider A. Carmichael G. Hänel F. Eilers M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5672-5686Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Miz-1 interacts with the helix-loop-helix domain of c-Myc to mediate the gene repression, and the inhibitory mechanism is proposed to involve competition for binding the p300/CBP coactivator (29Peukert K. Staller P. Schneider A. Carmichael G. Hänel F. Eilers M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5672-5686Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Repression of the Nramp1 promoter by c-Myc can be overcome with ectopic expression of Miz-1 (20Bowen H. Biggs T.E. Phillips E. Baker S.T. Perry V.H. Mann D.A. Barton C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34997-35006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, some Nramp1 promoter constructs are poorly stimulated by Miz-1, whereas others demonstrate strong Miz-1-induced activation. In this study, we examine the murine Nramp1 promoter and the sequence requirements for Miz-1 induction. We identify a non-canonical E box within the Nramp1 promoter that functions as a suppressor of basal promoter activity and transactivation by Miz-1. Our previous results revealed that a small promoter fragment could be strongly induced by Miz-1. This was subsequently found to contain a consensus Sp1-binding site or GC box. Deletion and substitution mutagenesis of this GC box rendered the promoter refractory to the influence of Miz-1, but not to c-Myc-mediated repression.MATERIALS AND METHODSReporter Constructs—The clones used in this study were prepared as described previously (20Bowen H. Biggs T.E. Phillips E. Baker S.T. Perry V.H. Mann D.A. Barton C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34997-35006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and were taken from a genomic clone isolated from a C57/BL6/CBAF1J FixII library (Stratagene). The sequence of the fragment relevant to these studies has the GenBank™/EBI accession number AJ458183, and the identification of putative transcription factor-binding sites was as described (20Bowen H. Biggs T.E. Phillips E. Baker S.T. Perry V.H. Mann D.A. Barton C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34997-35006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Clones pHB4, pHB6, and pHB8 and mutants thereof correspond to 5′-restriction endonuclease cleavage sites XbaI (-1555 bp), HindIII (-868 bp), and SphI (-71 bp) and a 3′-synthetic BamHI site at +100 bp. Constructs pHB20, pHB21, pHB22, and pHB23 were prepared from synthetic oligonucleotides (Oswel, Southampton, UK) with similar 3′ termini at +34 bp and 5′-ends at -71, -34, +7, and -17 bp, respectively. Inserts were cloned into pBLCAT3 or pGL3-Basic (Promega) and sequenced (Oswel).Transient Transfection Assays—Transfections were performed in either COS-1 cells or the murine macrophage-like line RAW264.7 using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. pCMV-Miz-1 expression plasmid was provided by Frank Hänel (Hans Knoll-Institut for Naturstoff-Forschung, Heidelberg, Germany), and p300/CBP was provided by Issay Kitabayashi (National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan). CAT activities from extracts of transfected COS-1 and RAW264.7 cells were assessed by standard techniques, quantitated by phosphorimaging, and normalized by the activity of a CAT gene expressed from the pHu-β-actin promoter-1-neo plasmid, pLKCat2 (the parental plasmid was provided by Peter Gunning, Cell Biology Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, Westmead, Australia). Internal transfection controls involved the use of pGL3-Control (Promega). All transfections were repeated at least twice, and the results represent the means of at least three data points. Protein was determined by the micro-BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) or Bio-Rad protein assay reagent.RNA Interference Assay—RNAi was undertaken using the pSilencer-1 vector (Ambion Inc.) to direct expression of the relevant hairpin double-stranded sequence from the U6 RNA polymerase III promoter. RNAi target sequences were selected from the human Miz-1 sequence (GenBank™/EBI accession number Y09723). Each candidate target sequence was analyzed by BLAST search to ensure the hit would be unique to the Miz-1 RNA. Target oligonucleotides were synthesized (AL1, 5′-AAGGCCGAGATCAGCAAAGTTCAAGAGACTTTGCTGATCTCGGCCTTTTTTTT-3′; and AL2, 5′-AATTAAAAAAAAGGCCGAGATCAGCAAAGTCTCTTGAACTTTGCTGATCTCGGCCTTGGCC-3′), annealed, and cloned into pSilencer between the ApaI and EcoRI sites using standard molecular cloning techniques. Recombinant plasmid DNA was prepared and tested for silencing activity against a Miz-1-EGFP chimeric mRNA expressed from pEGFP-N3 (Clontech) as an N-terminal fusion of Miz-1 with GFP. Control silencing experiments were performed in COS-1 cells transiently transfected with the Miz-1 chimera-expressing pEGFP plasmid and the pSilencer plasmid DNA. The mean fluorescence of cells expressing GFP was assessed by flow cytometry. First, control transfectants were analyzed to ascertain background fluorescence; from these data, gates were established to exclude untransfected cells. Data were obtained from transfected cells that were above this threshold, and changes in this number of cells as a result of pSilencer-Miz-1 RNAi cotransfection were used to assess the efficacy of the silencing vector. Specificity was assessed either using the empty vector pSilencer plasmid, a vector containing an unrelated insert, or using pSilencer-Miz-1 against the parental pEGFP vector. A similar plasmid-based silencing construct against mouse Miz-1 was generated from the published sequence (26Herold S. Wanzel M. Beuger V. Frohme C. Beul D. Hillukkala T. Syvaoja J. Saluz H.-P. Haenel F. Eilers M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 14: 509-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (255) Google Scholar).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—This was undertaken on extracts from RAW264.7 cells following the Upstate Biotechnology protocol. Each precipitation was undertaken on extracts from 0.5–1 × 106 cells using 1 μg of antibodies against Miz-1 and Sp1 (N-17 (sc-5984) and H-225 (sc-14027), respectively; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and c-Myc (Ab-3; Calbiochem). Immunoprecipitates were purified by phenol/chloroform extractions, and Nramp1 promoter sequences were identified by PCR (25 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min and 50 °C for 1 min) using primers CAGGAAGGACCAGAAATCGGA and TGAGTAAGAGTGGGAACCCACG, which amplify a 269-bp product. Products were fractionated on a 2% agarose gel using a 1-kb DNA ladder as a size marker (Invitrogen).RESULTSCell-specific Expression of the Nramp1 Promoter—A schematic diagram of the constructs used in this study is shown with representation of the key transcription factor-binding sites described in this study (Fig. 1a), identified as indicated previously (20Bowen H. Biggs T.E. Phillips E. Baker S.T. Perry V.H. Mann D.A. Barton C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34997-35006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Analysis of the Nramp1 promoter by transient transfection assays revealed that an ∼1.6-kb 5′-flanking region DNA fragment directed expression, but deletion mutagenesis revealed that the basal activities of shorter constructs were greater. When data from COS-1 and RAW264.7 cells were compared following normalization against a human β-actin control promoter, despite the reduced transfection efficiency of RAW264.7 cells compared with COS-1 cells (∼5000-fold), the Nramp1 promoter was expressed preferentially in RAW264.7 cells by 10–20-fold, depending on the particular promoter constructs compared (Fig. 1b).An E Box Element Represses Basal Nramp1 Promoter Function—The data in Fig. 2a show comparable deletion profiles for both COS-1 and RAW264.7 cells. Similar results were also obtained when data were normalized to the activity of a co-transfected luciferase reporter construct in COS-1 cells (Fig. 2b). In all sets of data (Figs. 1 and 2), an apparent increase in promoter activity was observed upon deletion from pHB4 (-1555 bp) or pHB6 (-868 bp) to pHB8 (-71 bp), a decrease to pHB20, and a further increase for pHB21 and pHB23. As described previously (20Bowen H. Biggs T.E. Phillips E. Baker S.T. Perry V.H. Mann D.A. Barton C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34997-35006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), all constructs were inhibited by co-transfection with a c-Myc expression plasmid, indicating that the site of c-Myc repression maps to the Inr element within the minimal core promoter. The shortest construct tested in both cell types, pHB22, was inactive as expected. The increase in promoter activity upon deletion from pHB6 (-868 bp) to pHB8 (-71 bp) suggests that some repressor element lies within this region. A series of further deletion mutants, prepared from -868 to -403 bp, revealed that the repressor must be located 3′ of -403 bp and that situated here is a non-canonical E box element (CAACTG), -130 to -125 bp, termed E6. c-Myc can bind to these non-canonical sites with affinities equal to or less than those for canonical sites (30Blackwell T.K. Kretzer L. Blackwood E.M. Alt F.W. Eisenman R.N. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this E box was responsible for the observed reduced basal promoter activity in longer plasmid constructs, it was mutated by two-step PCR. Mutant expression constructs in the context of pHB4 and pHB6 were generated and termed pHB4M6M and pHB6M6M (see Fig. 1a). Plasmid constructs were introduced into both RAW264.7 and COS-1 cells by transfection, and levels of the reporter gene were determined. Our results indicated that mutation of E6 in the context of pHB4 increased basal promoter activity by 8–10-fold to levels that were indistinguishable from those of pHB8 (Fig. 3a). These levels were significantly greater than those of pHB4. In the context of pHB6, mutation of E6 resulted in a 10–20-fold increase in reporter gene activity (Fig. 3b).Fig. 2Comparative deletion analysis of the Nramp1 promoter in COS-1 and RAW264.7 cells. a, COS-1 (closed bars) and RAW264.7 cells (open bars) were transfected as described under “Materials and Methods” with the indicated plasmid constructs. Data are presented as the percentage conversion of substrate to product relative to the activity of a human β-actin control promoter reporter. b, the experiment was the same as described for a for COS-1 cells. Cells were cotransfected with a luciferase control promoter plasmid (pGL3), and data are shown normalized and non-normalized to the luciferase reporter activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Effect of the E6 mutation on Nramp1 promoter activities. a, COS-1 cells (closed bars) and RAW264.7 cells (open bars) were transfected as described under “Materials and Methods” with pHB4, pHB8, or the E6 mutant pHB4M6M. b, the conditions were the same as described for a, except that the promoter constructs were based on pHB6. Results for both are presented as the CAT conversion relative to pHB4 (a) and pHB6 (b).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Attenuation of Miz-1 Function by an E Box Element—As a result of the increased basal activity of the mutant constructs pHB4M6M and pHB6M6M, we wished to investigate whether the mutations would influence responsiveness to Miz-1. Our previous data had revealed that pHB4 is weakly responsive to the inductive effects of Miz-1 compared with pHB20 (20Bowen H. Biggs T.E. Phillips E. Baker S.T. Perry V.H. Mann D.A. Barton C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34997-35006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Transfections into COS-1 cells showed that mutation of E6 resulted in the acquisition of responsiveness to induction by Miz-1, 5–6-fold induction with 0.2 μg of Miz-1 (Fig. 4a); data are shown for an E6 mutant in the context of pHB6. The results from a Miz-1 titration experiment comparing pHB4 and pHB4M6M are shown in Fig. 4b. For pHB4, 0.5 μg of Miz-1 resulted in an 8-fold induction of reporter gene activity, whereas for pHB4M6M, 0.2 μg of Miz-1 produced an ∼50-fold increase in reporter gene activity under the same experimental conditions. Both constructs were responsive to Miz-1; however, the highest activity attained in the mutant construct was 10-fold greater than that of pHB4.Fig. 4Response of Nramp1 promoter constructs and E box mutants to transactivation by Miz-1 and p300. a, data are shown for COS-1 cells transfected with the indicated constructs and 0.2 μg of Miz-1 expression plasmid. Results are presented as the CAT activities relative to Miz-1-untreated cultures. b, Miz-1 was titrated with pHB4 and pHB4M6M as indicated. Results are presented as the level of CAT activity for 25 μg of cytosolic protein over a 3-h incubation period. c, promoter constructs were transactivated as indicated with 0.5 μg of p300/CBP expression plasmid. Results are presented as activities relative to p300/CBP-untreated cultures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Attenuation of p300 Coactivation by an E Box Element— Another feature of Miz-1 is its requirement for the coactivator p300, and the interaction between p300 and Miz-1 is inhibited by c-Myc (29Peukert K. Staller P. Schneider A. Carmichael G. Hänel F. Eilers M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5672-5686Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In view of our data suggesting that pHB4M6M and pHB6M6M are more active and responsive to Miz-1 compared with pHB4 and pHB6, we tested whether the responses of these constructs to p300 were also modulated. The data revealed that pHB6M6M was more responsive to p300 (Fig. 4c) and that pHB6 was induced 2-fold by 0.5 μg of p300, whereas pHB6M6M was induced 6.5-fold, indicating that E6 probably potentiates repression to endogenous c-Myc, but that the site is not absolutely required since inhibition by c-Myc occurs with the smallest active promoter construct that lacks any E box elements (20Bowen H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 34997-35006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).A GC Box Is Required for Nramp1 Transactivation by Miz-1—The smallest promoter construct we tested in previous work (pHB21) that was also responsive to Miz-1 contains an Inr element(s) and a consensus Sp1-binding site or GC box. We wanted to test whether the Inr element(s) identified are responsible for the stimulatory effects on Miz-1 and the inhibitory effects on c-Myc, as studies have also revealed that GC-rich elements can mediate c-Myc repression (31Feng X.-H. Liang Y.-Y. Liang M. Zhai W. Lin X. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 133-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). A number of constructs were prepared: first, an Sp1 deletion mutant (pHB23) and Sp1 site substitution mutants in the context of pHB4 and pHB8, termed pHB8Sp1M and pHB4Sp1M, respectively (see Fig. 1a). The data shown in Fig. 5a for pHB23 and other wild-type deletion constructs confirm that the consensus Sp1-binding site or GC box is not required for c-Myc inhibition, suggesting that the Inr elements alone are responsible. Analysis of pHB4, pHB20, and the corresponding consensus Sp1-binding site mutants (pHB4Sp1M and pHB23) revealed the GC box as a potential inhibitory element in COS-1 cells. Its removal"

This is the case for L20, which binds to two distinct sites of its mRNA that both resemble its binding site on 23 S rRNA. In the present work, we report an NMR analysis of the interaction between the C-terminal domain of L20 (L20C) and both its rRNA- and mRNA-binding sites. Changes in the NMR chemical shifts of the L20C backbone nuclei were used to show that the same set of residues are modified upon addition of either the rRNA or the mRNA fragments, suggesting a mimicry at the atomic level. In addition, small angle x-ray scattering experiments, performed with the rRNA fragment, demonstrated the formation of a complex made of two RNAs and two L20C molecules. A low resolution model of this complex was then calculated using (i) the rRNA/L20C structure in the 50 S context and (ii) NMR and small angle x-ray scattering results. The formation of this complex is interesting in the context of gene regulation because it suggests that translational repression could be performed by a complex of two proteins, each interacting with the two distinct L20-binding sites within the operator.

Ribosome assembly is a complex process in which proteins must assemble onto the ribosomal RNA in an ordered fashion. This process has been extensively analyzed for bacterial ribosomal subunits, using in vitro reconstitution studies. In the case of Escherichia coli large 50 S subunit, it has been shown that nine “core proteins” L1, L3, L4, L9, L10, L11, L20, L23, and L24 bind directly to the 23 S rRNA, independently of other proteins (1Rohl R. Nierhaus K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 2Herold M. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8826-8833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other 50 S ribosomal proteins depend upon those primary binders for attachment to the large ribosomal subunit. Interestingly, several of these core proteins, namely L1, L4, L10, and L20, are also involved in the feedback regulation that allows the coordinated expression of the various ribosomal components (3Yates J.L.

A similar situation is also observed for the small ribosomal subunit where regulatory ribosomal proteins are also primary 16 S rRNA binders. Most bacterial ribosomal protein genes are clustered in polycistronic operons, the expression of which is controlled at the translational level (9Nomura M. Gourse R. Baughman G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 75-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 10Lindahl L. Zengel J.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 297-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 11Keener J. Nomura M.

One cistron encodes a regulatory ribosomal protein that binds to the messenger RNA, thereby shutting off the translation of the downstream ribosomal protein cistrons. In the classical Nomura model, it is assumed that the protein-binding site on the mRNA, the translational operator, is structurally similar to its binding site on the rRNA. Molecular mimicry between the two target RNA sites would then be used to adjust the translation of ribosomal proteins to the level of transcription of the rRNA; in the presence of excess unbound rRNA, the repressor ribosomal protein would be displaced from its mRNA, thereby allowing translation to proceed. So far, in E. coli, the molecular mimicry between the translational operator on the mRNA and the rRNA has been demonstrated in the case of L1, through mutagenesis of either target sites (12Said B. Cole J.R. Nomura M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 22: 10529-10545Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and of S8 where direct binding to both RNAs has additionally been shown (13Gregory R.J. Cahill P.B.F. Thurlow D.L. Zimmermann R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). More recently, detailed studies were performed on the feedback control mechanism of S15 from various bacterial species. In E. coli, S15 translational operator is a pseudoknot structure (14Philippe C. Portier C. Mougel M. Grunberg-Manago M. Ebel J.P. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas in Thermus thermophilus and Bacillus stearothermophilus it is a three-helix junction, as in the binding site for S15 in central domain of the 16 S rRNA (15Serganov A. Polonskaia A. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Patel D.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1898-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16Scott L.G. Williamson J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, in all three cases there appears to be a common recognition pattern, a bipartite recognition motif with a conserved G(U/G)C in one of the two subsites (15Serganov A. Polonskaia A. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Patel D.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1898-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16Scott L.G. Williamson J.R. J. Mol.

Biol. 2002; 320: 963-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This motif is also involved in S15 binding to the 16 S rRNA, as seen in the crystal structures (18Nikulin A. Serganov A. Ennifar E. Tishchenko S. Nevskaya N. Shepard W. Portier C. Garber M. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Nikonov S. Dumas P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 19Agalarov S.C. Sridhar Prasad G. Funke P.M. Stout C.D. Williamson J.R. Science. 2000; 288: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), thereby confirming the molecular mimicry model. In E. coli, the case of L20, one of the four 50 S repressor proteins, is quite puzzling because of the unique nature of its translational operator organization. The L20 gene is part of the IF3 operon, which comprises infC, rpmI, and rplT, encoding translation initiation factor IF3 and ribosomal proteins L35 and L20, respectively. L20 represses the translation of rpmI (8Lesage P. Truong H.N. Graffe M. Dondon J. Springer M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which in turn prevents the translation of its own gene through translational coupling (20Lesage P. Chiaruttini C. Graffe M. Dondon J. Milet M. Springer M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 366-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Regions of the rpmI leader sequence important for translational control have been identified by a combination of genetic, mutational, and footprinting experiments. They are composed of two independent structures, a pseudoknot structure that involves long range RNA-RNA interactions and overlaps the rpmI ribosome-binding site and initiation codon (site 1) (21Chiaruttini C. Milet M. Springer M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4402-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and an imperfect stem structure located in the infC-rpmI intergenic region (site 2) (22Guillier M. Allemand F. Raibaud S. Dardel F. Springer M. Chiaruttini C. RNA (New York). 2002; 8: 878-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both sites are apparently independently bound by L20, and both are required for repression of expression of L35 and L20 (22Guillier M. Allemand F. Raibaud S. Dardel F. Springer M. Chiaruttini C. RNA (New York). 2002; 8: 878-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This peculiar “dual-site” organization of the operator raises a number of questions. (i) How many L20 molecules are required to bind to each site? (ii) Why is simultaneous binding required for repression? (iii) What is the mechanism allowing the cross-talk between the two sites? The three-dimensional structures of free and ribosome-bound forms of L20 have been reported recently (23Raibaud S. Lebars I. Guillier M. Chiaruttini C. Bontems F. Rak A. Garber M. Allemand F. Springer M. Dardel F. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 24Harms J. Schluenzen F. Zarivach R. Bashan A. Gat S. Agmon I. Bartels H. Franceschi F. Yonath A. Cell. 2001; 107: 679-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). They reveal a segmented organization, with a globular C-terminal domain (L20C), which interacts with helices 40 and 41 of the 23 S rRNA (25Noller H.F. Kop J. Wheaton V. Brosius J. Gutell R.R. Kopylov A.M. Dohme F. Herr W. Stahl D.A. Gupta R. Woese C.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6167-6189Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and a highly cationic N-terminal domain, which is disordered in the free state and folds as a long helical shaft within the ribosome, penetrating deeply into the 50 S subunit (24Harms J. Schluenzen F. Zarivach R. Bashan A. Gat S. Agmon I. Bartels H. Franceschi F. Yonath A. Cell. 2001; 107: 679-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been shown that, by itself, L20C from E. coli is able to act as a translational repressor in vivo (23Raibaud S. Lebars I. Guillier M. Chiaruttini C. Bontems F. Rak A. Garber M. Allemand F. Springer M. Dardel F. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, the N-terminal domain of L20 appears to be dispensable for the control of rpmI and rplT expression. The present work reports the study of the interaction of L20C with either its target site on the 23 S rRNA or one of its two binding sites within the translational operator of rpmI, using heteronuclear NMR and SAXS. 1The abbreviations used are: SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; TROSY, transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy; L20aa, A. aeolicus L20 protein. Both selected RNA fragments interact specifically with L20C, and the two complexes involve similar residues within the protein, indicating a common binding site. The observed complexes are however significantly larger than expected, and the SAXS data suggest that it is a dimer of complexes, i.e. 2 proteins + 2 RNAs. This indicates that L20C has the intrinsic capacity to dimerize RNA and sheds new light on the translational control mechanism. In the case of the rRNA-protein complex, a low resolution structural model of this dimer could be constructed from both the NMR and SAXS data, yielding some structural indications on how L20 could interact with both sites on its messenger RNA. Protein Expression and Purification—The plasmid pET42aL20aaΔN was constructed as follow: pBL20aaΔN 2M. Guillier, F. Allemand, H. Springer, and C. Chiaruttini, manuscript in preparation. was digested by BsrGI-XbaI, and the DNA fragment carrying L20C was transferred into pET42a (Novagen). The resulting plasmid was transformed into BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus (Stratagene). For expression and labeling of L20C, BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus/pET42aL20aaΔN was grown at 37 °C in Martek-9 N medium (Spectra Stable Isotopes) supplemented with Celtone-N (2 g/liter) and the appropriate antibiotics. When the A 600 turbidity reached 0.5, L20C expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and protein production was allowed to proceed for 4 h. Typical cultures (0.5 liter) yielded ∼2 g of cells (wet weight). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 10 ml of 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and disrupted by sonication. Cell debris were spun down, and the soluble extract was concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (70% saturated). The sample was first submitted to a gel filtration column (Superdex 75 prep-grade 2.6 × 60 cm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, at room temperature. The presence of L20C within the collected fractions (4 ml each) was monitored by analyzing aliquots on SDS-PAGE. The pooled fractions (24 ml) were then diluted 2.5 times with H2O to lower the ionic strength. An ion-exchange chromatography step was then performed on an SP-Sepharose column (Hiload 2.6 × 10 cm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. L20C was eluted using a 0.2–1.5 m linear NaCl gradient in the same buffer (300 ml). The purified protein was then dialyzed against 20 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.6, and concentrated with a Centricon YM-3 (Millipore) The overall yield was 8 mg of purified L20C per liter of culture. RNA fragments corresponding to the rRNA and oRNA target sites (Fig. 1) were purchased from Dharmacon Research, deprotected as indicated by the supplier, and dialyzed extensively. tRNA3Lys was purified as described previously (26Tisne C. Rigourd M. Marquet R. Ehresmann C. Dardel F. RNA (New York). 2000; 6: 1403-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). NMR Titration—The NMR experiments were carried out on a Bruker DRX600 Avance spectrometer. NMR titrations were performed using a 420-μl sample at a final L20C concentration of 0.6 mm in buffer 20 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 6.6. One molar equivalent of RNA was lyophilized and suspended in 80 μl of the same buffer. Aliquots of this solution were added stepwise to the labeled L20C to perform a several point titration. RNA/L20C molar ratios used were 0.5:1, 0.6:1, 0.8:1, and 1:1. The pH was checked after each step and remained within 0.1–0.2 pH units of the starting value. NMR spectral changes were monitored by recording TROSY experiments (27Pervushin K. Riek R. Wider G. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12366-12371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2077) Google Scholar) at 303 K. The assignment of the L20C residues in the complex was derived from a three-dimensional NOESY-TROSY experiment (28Zhu G. Kong X.M. Sze K.H. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) with a mixing time of 80 ms, also at 303 K. NMR data were processed with the Gifa software (29Rouh A. Delsuc M.A. Bertran G. Lallemand J.Y. J. Magn. Reson. 1993; 102: 357-359Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Gel Filtration and SAXS Experiments—The complex was formed as described above, by stepwise addition of the RNA to the protein solution, and monitored by NMR. The complex recovered from the NMR tube (6.5 mg in 0.5 ml) was submitted to a gel filtration step (Sephacryl S-100 HighPrep 2.6 × 60 cm, Amersham Biosciences) running at 0.1 cm/min in 20 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 6.5, at 4 °C. Fractions (3.6 ml) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and urea-PAGE for protein and RNA content, respectively. The combined complex fractions (36 ml) were then concentrated to 5 mg/ml by ultrafiltration using ultrafree 5K cells (Millipore). SAXS measurements were performed using the synchrotron radiation beam line D24 at the DCI storage ring of LURE (Laboratoire pour l'Utilization du Rayonnement Électromagnétique, Orsay, France). The instrument, the data acquisition system (30Boulin C. Kempf R. Koch M.H.J. McLaughlin S.M. Nuclear Instrumt. Methods. 1986; 249: 399-407Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and the evacuated measuring cell (31Dubuisson J.M. Decamps T. Vachette P. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 49-54Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have been described. Measurements were performed in a quartz capillary (diameter ∼1.5 mm) maintained at the constant temperature of 20 °C on solutions of free rRNA and L20C-RNA complex in 20 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 6.5. Samples were at a macromolecular concentration close to 5 mg/ml. Eight frames of 100 s each were recorded using a position-sensitive proportional detector covering the range of modulus of the scattering vector s from 0.0016 to 0.03 Å–1 (s = 2 sinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle, λ is the radiation wavelength, and λ = 1.488 Å). Eight frames of 200 s each were also recorded with the corresponding buffer. Frames were visually inspected to check for x-ray damage; none was found. Data were scaled to the transmitted intensity, before computing the average and standard deviation of each measurement and subtracting the scattering from the corresponding buffer. The scattering pattern of a 5 mg/ml solution of bovine serum albumin was also recorded, and the value of the intensity at the origin I(0)/c (where c is protein concentration in mg/ml) was used as a reference to derive an estimate of the molecular mass of the samples studied. The structural parameters were calculated using the following standard procedures. The radius of gyration and the intensity at the origin were derived from a Guinier analysis of the scattering intensities at s < s max = x/(2πRg) (32Guinier A. Fournet G. Small Angle Scattering of X-Rays. Wiley Interscience, New York1955Google Scholar) (x = 1.3 for the RNA, x = 1.55 for the complex) shown in Equation 1, ln[I(s)]=ln(I(0))-(4π2Rg2/3)s2(Eq. 1) The distance distribution function p(r) corresponds to the distribution of distances between any two volume elements within one particle. It has been determined using the indirect transform method as implemented in the program GNOM (33Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2968) Google Scholar). This function provides an alternative estimate of the radius of gyration derived through Equation 2, Rg2=∫r2p(r)dr2∫p(r)dr(Eq. 2) Scattering intensities were computed from the atomic coordinates of L20C, rRNA, and their complexes by using the program CRYSOL, which takes into account the hydration water by introducing a 3-Å thick border layer surrounding the molecule (34Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2778) Google Scholar). The calculated scattering profile is fitted to the experimental pattern using only two adjustable parameters, the average displaced solvent volume per atomic group and the contrast of electron density of the border layer with respect to bulk solvent Δρ b = ρ b – ρ0, to minimize the discrepancy shown in Equation 3, χ2=1N-1∑i=1NIe(Si)-I(Si)σ(Si)2(Eq. 3) where N is the number of experimental points, and Ie (si) and σ(si) denote the experimental scattering curve and its standard deviation, respectively. Molecular Modeling—In the following text, “complex” refers to the L20C-rRNA fragment complex (1 protein + 1 RNA duplex), and “dimer” designates the dimer of complexes (2 proteins + 2 RNA duplexes). The structure of the complex between L20C and the rRNA fragment was modeled as follows: coordinates from L20C and the rRNA fragment were extracted from Deinococcus radiodurans 50 S ribosomal subunit structure (24Harms J. Schluenzen F. Zarivach R. Bashan A. Gat S. Agmon I. Bartels H. Franceschi F. Yonath A. Cell. 2001; 107: 679-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar) (the latest Protein Data Bank entry 1NKW was used, because the original 1KC9 entry contained a 3-residue shift in the chain tracing within L20). Because only the Cα atoms of the protein were included in this structure, the complete coordinates from L20C from Aquifex aeolicus (23Raibaud S. Lebars I. Guillier M. Chiaruttini C. Bontems F. Rak A. Garber M. Allemand F. Springer M. Dardel F. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1GYZ) were then substituted for the D. radiodurans protein, after least square fitting Cα atom positions of the four α-helices composing the fold. Non-polar hydrogen atoms were removed, and the docked complex was energy-minimized in XPLOR (35Brünger A.T. A System for X-Ray Crystallography and NMR, X-PLOR Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) using the CHARMM force field (36Brooks B. Bruccoleri R. Olafson B. States D. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13964) Google Scholar) in order to remove bad van der Waals contacts. The sampling of allowable dimer conformations was performed using XPLOR. (i) The L20C-RNA complex structure was translated so that its center of mass coincided with the origin of the Cartesian coordinates. (ii) A random axis going through the origin was generated. The L20C-RNA complex structure was duplicated in place, and the second complex was rotated by 180° about this random axis. (iii) A random unit vector, perpendicular to the rotation axis, was then generated, and the second complex was translated by 100 Å along this axis, a distance sufficient to ensure that both dimers were no longer in contact with each other. (iv) The second complex was then moved back stepwise along the translation axis, until it came back in contact with the first complex. Contact between the two complexes was detected by monitoring the van der Waals term of XPLOR energy function. After these steps, a random dimer conformation was obtained in which the two contacting complexes were related by a 2-fold symmetry axis. For each random dimer thus generated, the following three geometrical parameters were computed: the radius of gyration; the minimum distance between L20C in the first complex and the RNA in the second complex (the bridging distance); and the minimum distance between the C-terminal helix of L20C (residues 102–118) in the first complex and the closest atom in the second complex (either from L20C or from the RNA (the C-terminal distance). When the resulting dimer geometry met the constraints, i.e. the three geometrical parameters fell within preset intervals, the coordinates were written to a file; otherwise the dimer was rejected. The set of randomly generated dimers that fitted the imposed geometrical constraints (compliant dimers) was then clustered into families, based on their root mean square deviation computed over all atoms. Any two dimer structures that exhibited a global pair-wise root mean square deviation under 6 Å were considered neighbors. This neighboring relationship could be used to partition the set of compliant dimers into disjoint geometric clusters. In order to investigate the recognition of rpmI translational operator, we decided to focus on the C-terminal domain of the protein, L20C, which corresponds to the second half of the sequence, starting approximately at the single tryptophan residue in the middle of the protein. Interaction studies were thus not conducted with the full-length L20 for the following reasons. (i) The C-terminal domain suffices to repress rpmI expression (23Raibaud S. Lebars I. Guillier M. Chiaruttini C. Bontems F. Rak A. Garber M. Allemand F. Springer M. Dardel F. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). (ii) In the crystal structure of D. radiodurans 50 S subunit (24Harms J. Schluenzen F. Zarivach R. Bashan A. Gat S. Agmon I. Bartels H. Franceschi F. Yonath A. Cell. 2001; 107: 679-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar), the C-terminal domain of L20 interacts tightly with a discrete region of the 23 S rRNA, at the junction between helices 40 and 41 (25Noller H.F. Kop J. Wheaton V. Brosius J. Gutell R.R. Kopylov A.M. Dohme F. Herr W. Stahl D.A. Gupta R. Woese C.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6167-6189Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), which exhibits similarities with the rpmI translational operator (22Guillier M. Allemand F. Raibaud S. Dardel F. Springer M. Chiaruttini C. RNA (New York). 2002; 8: 878-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). (iii) It was suspected that the strongly basic and unfolded N-terminal domain would make spurious electrostatic contacts with the RNA fragments, yielding to nonspecific aggregation of the sample, a phenomenon indeed observed in preliminary experiments (not shown). Preliminary studies were conducted with the L20C domain from E. coli, in order to study the cognate systems, E. coli L20/E. coli rRNA and mRNA. However, both the full-length L20 and the L20C domain from E. coli appeared unstable and gave poor quality NMR spectra (not shown). As we previously solved the solution structure of the A. aeolicus L20 protein (L20aa), which is highly homologous to its E. coli counterpart (∼66% sequence identity). it was decided to use the L20aa protein to study the interaction with E. coli 23 S rRNA and rpmI mRNA. Furthermore, the expression of E. coli rpmI gene can be regulated in trans by L20aa.2 Such a heterologous regulation ability had already been demonstrated in E. coli for L4 proteins from various bacterial species (37Zengel J.M. Vorozheikina D. Li X. Lindahl L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 1105-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Finally, L20aa is able to complement a null mutant of L20 from E. coli. 2 Thus, L20aa is a suitable model for structural studies, as it has been shown to be able to substitute for both E. coli L20 functions in vivo: translational control and ribosome assembly. The L20C domain from A. aeolicus was expressed from a recombinant construct; the first 5 codons of the gene were retained and fused to the C-terminal domain, two residues upstream from the tryptophan, yielding the following N-terminal sequence: MRVKGRLW, where the underlined residues correspond to the start of L20C sequence. The protein, which is 67-residues long, was expressed and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In a preliminary NMR study, three-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy [15N,1H] HSQC and three-dimensional NOESY [15N,1H] HSQC spectra were recorded on the 15N-labeled domain. Interestingly, even in the absence of its N-terminal part, the L20C domain folding remains intact, as evidenced by an almost identical [15N,1H] HSQC pattern and very similar NOE cross-peaks, although the lines were significantly sharper as expected for a smaller protein. The complete chain tracing from Trp59 to Gln118 was verified and allowed the identification of a few additional amide groups (Fig. 2A, W59, I60, E87, and R90, full-length L20aa numbering), which were broadened to base line in the full-length protein. Therefore, the NMR structure and the complete sequence-specific NMR assignments of L20C provided a basis for structural studies of the interactions between L20C and its RNA substrates. Two RNA fragments were designed according to the L20C-binding sites, either on the 23 S rRNA (rRNA) or site 2 on the rpmI translational operator (22Guillier M. Allemand F. Raibaud S. Dardel F. Springer M. Chiaruttini C. RNA (New York). 2002; 8: 878-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (oRNA). Both sites, which were previously reported to be structurally similar, were constructed by assembling two partially complementary synthetic oligoribonucleotides (Fig. 1). The operator sequence (oRNA) top helix was further stabilized by two additional GC base pairs. After annealing of their strands, the two RNA fragments (rRNA, 42 nucleotides; oRNA, 41 nucleotides) were analyzed by NMR in the absence of magnesium ions. The imino region of the one-dimensional proton spectra of the rRNA and the oRNA display 10 and 11 resonances, respectively (not shown), in good agreement with the predicted RNA secondary structures. In addition, the two-dimensional NOESY spectrum of the oRNA reveals a strong cross-peak between two imino protons characteristic of a U:G wobble pair, as expected from the predicted interaction between G21 and U30 (Fig. 1, oRNA). Most of the base and anomeric protons of the two rRNA stems were assigned using two-dimensional NOESY in H2O and 2H2O. The NOE connectivities between base H8/H6 and ribose H1′ indicate classical A-form RNA stems as expected from the secondary structures (not shown). Thus both RNAs fold according to the predicted secondary structure, even in the absence of magnesium. All further experiments were performed at 303 K, as it appeared to be the highest temperature at which all imin"

These results thus suggest that the direct interaction of SAP-1 with Lck results in inhibition of the kinase activity of the latter and a consequent negative regulation of T cell function.

The balance between protein-tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is precisely determined by the action of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) 1The abbreviations used are: PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; TCR, T cell antigen receptor; SH, Src homology; LAT, linker of activated T cells; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; pAb, polyclonal antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EcoR, ecotropic receptor; pNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; WT, wild type; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.

Cell Signal. 1996; 8: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), although the molecular mechanisms by which activities of these enzymes are coordinately regulated remain largely unknown. Protein-tyrosine phosphorylation plays central roles in signal transduction by the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) (7Cantrell D. Annu. Rev.

The earliest biochemical events known to be elicited by engagement of the TCR are activation of the Src family PTKs Lck and Fyn (9Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 10Samelson L.E. Phillips A.F. Luong E.T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4358-4362Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). In human T cells, the TCR-mediated activation of Lck results from autophosphorylation of this enzyme on Tyr394. In contrast, phosphorylation of Tyr505 near the COOH terminus of Lck by the Src family kinase Csk negatively regulates Lck activity (11Bergman M. Mustelin T. Oetken C. Partanen J. Flint N.A.

Activated Lck or Fyn mediates the phosphorylation of CD3 and the ζ chain, which are the signal-transducing subunits of the TCR (7Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 8Samelson L.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 371-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). These modifications occur within immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs and direct the recruitment of ZAP-70, a Syk family PTK, to the TCR through interaction with its tandem Src homology 2 (SH2) domains (12Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The consequent activation of ZAP-70 results in the phosphorylation of various adapter proteins including LAT (for linker of activated T cells), SLP-76, Vav, and phospholipase C-γ (7Cantrell D. Annu.

In contrast to protein-tyrosine phosphorylation, the role of protein-tyrosine dephosphorylation in TCR-mediated signal transduction has been only partially resolved (14Cloutier J.F. Veillette A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). SHP-1, a cytoplasmic PTP that contains two SH2 domains, negatively regulates the TCR-mediated signaling pathway (15Plas D.R.

Immunity. 2001; 14: 669-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, PEP and PTP-PEST, which are related cytoplasmic PTPs, also negatively regulate TCR-mediated signaling (18Gjorloff-Wingren A. Saxena M. Williams S. Hammi D. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3845-3854Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 19Davidson D. Veillette A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3414-3426Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Whereas PEP appears to cooperate with Csk to inhibit TCR signaling, PTP-PEST dephosphorylates Shc, p130 Cas , Pyk2, and focal adhesion kinase (7Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 8Samelson L.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 371-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 14Cloutier J.F. Veillette A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The receptor-like PTP CD148, also known as DEP-1 (20Ostman A. Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9680-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 21Honda H. Inazawa J. Nishida J. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1994; 84: 4186-4194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), negatively regulates the TCR-mediated signaling pathway by catalyzing the dephosphorylation of LAT (22Tangye S.G. Wu J.

In contrast, CD45, another receptor-like PTP, dephosphorylates Tyr505 of Lck and thereby increases its activity and promotes TCR signaling (25Thomas M.L. Brown E.J. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 406-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which the activity of Lck is down-regulated through protein-tyrosine dephosphorylation in vivo and the identity of the PTPs that mediate such regulation remain unknown, however. SAP-1 (for stomach cancer-associated protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1) was originally identified as a PTP expressed in a stomach cancer cell line (26Matozaki T. Suzuki T. Uchida T. Inazawa J. Ariyama T. Matsuda K. Horita K. Noguchi H. Mizuno H. Sakamoto C. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2075-2081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is a transmembrane-type PTP with a single catalytic domain in its cytoplasmic region and eight fibronectin type III-like domains in its extracellular region (26Matozaki T. Suzuki T. Uchida T. Inazawa J. Ariyama T. Matsuda K. Horita K. Noguchi H. Mizuno H. Sakamoto C. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2075-2081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A “substrate-trapping” approach identified p130 Cas , a prominent focal adhesion-associated component of the integrin signaling pathway, as a likely physiological substrate of SAP-1 (27Noguchi T. Tsuda M. Takeda H. Takada T. Inagaki K. Yamao T. Fukunaga K. Matozaki T. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15216-15224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of SAP-1 resulted in the dephosphorylation of several additional focal adhesion-associated proteins, including focal adhesion kinase and paxillin, as well as in the impairment of reorganization of the actin-based cytoskeleton (27Noguchi T. Tsuda M. Takeda H. Takada T. Inagaki K. Yamao T. Fukunaga K. Matozaki T. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15216-15224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), suggesting that SAP-1 regulates the latter process. Overexpression of this PTP also inhibited cell proliferation, an effect that was mediated in part either by attenuation of growth factor-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase or by caspase-dependent apoptosis (27Noguchi T. Tsuda M. Takeda H. Takada T. Inagaki K. Yamao T. Fukunaga K. Matozaki T. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15216-15224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 28Takada T.

Although most of these observations were made with cultured fibroblasts, together with the reduced expression of SAP-1 in advanced cancer (29Seo Y. Matozaki T. Tsuda M. Hayashi Y. Itoh H. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), they suggest that this enzyme functions as a suppressor of cell growth. SAP-1 mRNA has been detected in most tissues examined but is especially abundant in the spleen. 2H. Okazawa and T. Matozaki, unpublished data. To explore the biological role of SAP-1 in the immune system, we have attempted to identify molecules that interact with the cytoplasmic region of this protein. We now show that this region of SAP-1 binds directly to Lck. Furthermore, overexpression of wild-type SAP-1 resulted in down-regulation of the kinase activity of Lck and thereby negatively regulated TCR-mediated T cell functions. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) to SAP-1 (26Matozaki T. Suzuki T. Uchida T. Inazawa J. Ariyama T. Matsuda K. Horita K. Noguchi H. Mizuno H. Sakamoto C. Kasuga M. J. Biol.

The mouse mAb (154A7) to SAP-1 was also generated by using a recombinant immunoglobulin-Fc fusion protein, which contained three fibronectin-type III-like domains of SAP-1 in its extracellular region (amino acids 1–250), as an antigen. The detail for the preparation of this recombinant protein will be described elsewhere. The mAb was purified from culture supernatants of the hybridoma by column chromatography on protein A-Sepharose 4FF (Amersham Biosciences). Two mouse mAbs (anti-T112 and anti-T113) to CD2 (31Meuer S.C. Hussey R.E. Fabbi M. Fox D. Acuto O. Fitzgerald K.A. Hodgdon J.C. Protentis J.P. Schlossman S.F. Reinherz E.L.

Mouse mAbs to CD3 (OKT3), or to the Myc epitope tag (9E10) were purified from the culture supernatants of hybridoma cells. A mouse mAb to Lck, rabbit pAbs to Lck, rabbit pAbs to LAT, and a mouse mAb (4G10) to phosphotyrosine were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. Rabbit pAbs to human Src autophosphorylated on Tyr416 that also recognize the autophosphorylation sites of other Src family PTKs, including Lck, were from Cell Signaling Technology. Rabbit pAbs to MAP kinase and to active MAP kinase (pTEpY) were from Promega; rabbit pAbs to ZAP-70 and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse mAb (PY20) to phosphotyrosine were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; and a mouse mAb to CD247 (TCR ζ chain) was from COSMO BIO. A fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated mouse mAb to CD69 for flow cytometry was obtained from BD Pharmingen. Goat antibodies to mouse immunoglobulins were obtained from Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc. Plasmids for Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and Transient Transfection—The expression vectors pBTM116HA and pCIneo-myc were kindly provided by Y. Takai (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). To generate a yeast bait vector (pBTM116HA-SAP-1-cyto) encoding the cytoplasmic region of SAP-1 (amino acids 778–1117), we performed the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the pRC/CMV vector containing the full-length SAP-1 cDNA (27Noguchi T. Tsuda M. Takeda H. Takada T. Inagaki K. Yamao T. Fukunaga K. Matozaki T. Kasuga M. J. Biol.

The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and SalI and then inserted into pBTM116HA. To generate a yeast prey vector (pACT clone 15Δcat) that encoded a central portion of human Lck (amino acids 154–242), we performed PCR with a partial Lck cDNA (clone 15) as a template, the sense primer 5′-CTATTCGATGATGAAGATACCCCACCAAACCC-3′, and the antisense primer 5′-AAACTCGAGTCACGTCTCCCTGGGAACC-3′. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and then inserted into the vector pACT2. The plasmid pACT Lck-cat, which encodes the catalytic domain of Lck (amino acids 243–509), was also prepared in the same manner as was pACT clone 15Δcat but with the sense primer 5′-AAAGAATTCGGGAGAGCGAGAGC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-GTGAACTTGCGGGGTTTTTCAGTACGA-3′. To generate the pCIneo-myc-SAP-1-cyto vector, which encodes the Myc epitope-tagged cytoplasmic region of SAP-1, for transient transfection, we excised the cDNA fragment encoding this region of SAP-1 from pBTM116HA-SAP-1-cyto by digestion with EcoRI and SalI and subcloned it into the corresponding sites of pCIneo-myc. A pCLS vector containing the full-length human Lck cDNA (32Ohta M. Morita T. Shimotohno K. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1990; 81: 440-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), which was kindly provided by K. Shimotohno (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan), was also used for transient transfection of COS-7 cells. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and Interaction Assays—For yeast two-hybrid screening, a human spleen Matchmaker library in pACT2 (Clontech) was screened as described previously (33Hata Y. Butz S. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain L40 was sequentially transfected with the bait vector pBTM116HA-SAP-1-cyto and the cDNA library with the use of lithium acetate. Transformants were selected on plates lacking histidine, uracil, tryptophan, and leucine. Positive clones were then picked after incubation for 4–6 days at 30 °C and assayed for β-galactosidase activity by the filter method. Extrachromosomal DNA was isolated by the glass bead method from the yeast clones that grew in the absence of histidine and were also β-galactosidase-positive. Prey plasmids were rescued in Escherichia coli HB101 cells, which were selected on M9 plates containing proline (50 μg/ml) and ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Interaction of the prey and bait was examined again by retransfection of yeast cells with bait and prey vectors together, followed by selection on plates lacking histidine and assay of β-galactosidase. Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, and Stimulation—COS-7 cells were maintained under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). COS-7 cells (∼1 × 106 in a 100-mm dish) were subjected to transient transfection with 2 μg of pCIneo-myc-SAP-1-cyto and with 2 μg of pCLS containing Lck cDNA by exposure to the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche). After 48 h, cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis as described below. For stimulation of the TCR, Jurkat cells (∼1 × 107) were incubated first for 30 min on ice with the mAb OKT3 (10 μg/ml) and then for 5 min at 37 °C with goat antibodies to mouse immunoglobulins (20 μg/ml). For CD2 stimulation, Jurkat cells (∼1 × 107) were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with the combination of anti-T112 and anti-T113 (1:100 dilution of ascites fluid). Cell lysates were then prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—COS-7 cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then lysed on ice in 1 ml of an ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 140 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and 1 mm sodium vanadate. Jurkat cells were lysed on ice in 500 μl of an ice-cold lysis buffer identical to that used for COS-7 cells with the exception that 1% Nonidet P-40 was replaced by 1% Brij 97 also containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm sodium vanadate. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. In brief, the supernatants were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose beads (20 μl of beads) (Amersham Biosciences) conjugated with various antibodies. The beads were then washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis with various antibodies. Immune complexes were detected with an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Protein Binding Assay—For assay of the interaction of SAP-1 with Lck in vitro, a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic region of wild-type SAP-1 (GST-SAP-1-WT) was generated and purified as described previously (26Matozaki T. Suzuki T. Uchida T. Inazawa J. Ariyama T. Matsuda K. Horita K. Noguchi H. Mizuno H. Sakamoto C. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2075-2081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Jurkat cells (∼1 × 107) were lysed on ice in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm sodium vanadate, and the lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were incubated for 5 h at 4 °C with GST-SAP-1-WT or GST, each of which was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (10 μg of protein/15 μl of packed beads; Amersham Biosciences). The beads were then washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer, suspended in SDS sample buffer, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with pAbs to Lck. Retrovirus Production and Infection—Full-length cDNAs for wild-type SAP-1 or a catalytically inactive SAP-1 mutant (SAP-1-C/S), in which Cys1022 was replaced by serine (27Noguchi T. Tsuda M. Takeda H. Takada T. Inagaki K. Yamao T. Fukunaga K. Matozaki T. Kasuga M. J. Biol.

Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by T. Kitamura) were maintained under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, puromycin (1 μg/ml) (Sigma), blasticidin (10 μg/ml) (Invitrogen), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells (∼2 × 106) were transiently transfected with 3 μg of pMX-puro vectors with the use of FuGENE 6. Fresh medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS) was added to the cells 16 h after transfection, and supernatants (6 ml) were harvested after incubation for an additional 24 h. Jurkat cells expressing the ecotropic receptor (J.EcoR cells) were kindly supplied by T. Saito (Chiba University, Chiba, Japan) (36Yamasaki S. Nishida K. Hibi M. Sakuma M. Shiina R. Takeuchi A. Ohnishi H. Hirano T. Saito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45175-45183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Expression of EcoR in human cells confers susceptibility to infection by the pMX-puro-derived retroviruses, which normally infect only rodent cells (36Yamasaki S. Nishida K. Hibi M. Sakuma M.

Parental J.EcoR cells were infected with each retrovirus-containing culture supernatant supplemented with Polybrene (10 μg/ml) (hexadimethren bromide, Sigma). The culture medium was refreshed 24 h after infection and was replaced by serum-supplemented RPMI 1640 containing puromycin (2 μg/ml) after incubation for an additional 24 h. Colonies were then isolated after 14 days. Several cell lines expressing SAP-1-WT or SAP-1-C/S were identified by immunoblot analysis of cell lysates with pAbs to SAP-1. Assay of PTP Activity—The PTP activity of SAP-1 immunoprecipitated from Jurkat cells with the mAb 3G5 was assayed with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) as a substrate as described previously (26Matozaki T. Suzuki T. Uchida T. Inazawa J. Ariyama T. Matsuda K. Horita K. Noguchi H. Mizuno H. Sakamoto C. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2075-2081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, J.EcoR cells (∼1 × 107) stably expressing SAP-1-WT or SAP-1-C/S were lysed on ice in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and aprotinin (10 μg/ml). Postnuclear cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 2 μg of mAb 3G5 prebound to protein G-Sepharose beads, after which the beads were washed twice with 1 ml of WG buffer and twice with 1 ml of PTP assay buffer (40 mm Mes-NaOH (pH 5.0), 1.6 mm dithiothreitol) before incubation for 30 min at 30 °C with 200 μl of PTP assay buffer containing 25 mm pNPP. The reaction was terminated by addition of 200 μl of 1 m NaOH, and absorbance at 410 nm was measured. Duplicate samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis with pAbs to SAP-1 to determine the amount of SAP-1 protein in the immunoprecipitates. In Vitro Dephosphorylation Assay—Jurkat cells were stimulated with pervanadate (100 μm Na3VO4, 10 μm H2O2 in phosphate-buffered saline) for 10 min at 37 °C, after which postnuclear cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with pAbs to Lck as described above. The resulting precipitates were washed three times with ice-cold dephosphorylation buffer (100 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA). A GST fusion protein of the catalytically inactive mutant SAP-1-C/S was generated and purified as previously described (27Noguchi T. Tsuda M. Takeda H. Takada T. Inagaki K. Yamao T. Fukunaga K. Matozaki T. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15216-15224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were incubated with 20 μg of GST-SAP-1-WT, GST-SAP-1-C/S, or GST in 400 μl of dephosphorylation buffer first for 1 h at 4 °C and then for 30 min at 30 °C. Reaction mixtures were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with pAbs to phosphorylated Tyr416 of Src. CD69 Expression—For the assay of CD69 expression, Jurkat cells (1 × 106) in 24-well plates were stimulated for 16 h either with immobilized OKT3 or with the combination of 1 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and 0.5 μm ionomycin. Cells were then stained with an FITC-conjugated mAb to CD69 and analyzed by flow cytometry with an Epics XL instrument (Beckman Coulter). Cell Migration Assay—Cell migration was assayed with a Transwell apparatus (Corning) as described previously (37Weber K.S.C. Ostermann G. Zernecke A. Schroder A. Klickstein L.B. Weber C. Mol. Biol.

In brief, the cell suspension (∼2 × 106 cells in 100 μl) was transferred to a polycarbonate filter (pore size, 8 μm; Corning) in the upper compartment of the apparatus, and 500 μl of culture medium were placed in the lower compartment. The apparatus was then placed for 3 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. The number of cells that had migrated into the lower compartment was then counted in triplicate with a hemocytometer. Each experiment was performed in triplicate wells. Quantitative Image Analysis—Intensity of an immunoblot band was determined by densitometric analysis that was performed using NIH Image version 1.62. Interaction of the Cytoplasmic Region of SAP-1 with Lck— To identify proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic region of SAP-1, we screened a human spleen cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid method with this region of SAP-1 (residues 778–1117) as the bait (Fig. 1A). Nine positive clones were obtained, among which three contained Lck cDNA and one contained a cDNA for CrkII, an adapter protein that is tyrosine-phosphorylated by Src family PTKs (38Matsuda M. Tanaka S. Nagata S. Kojima A. Kurata T. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Among the Lck clones, one (clone 9) contained a full-length cDNA whereas the other two (one of which is clone 15) encoded a COOH-terminal region of Lck (amino acids 154–509) containing a portion of the SH2 domain and the kinase domain (Fig. 1B). We further analyzed the precise region of Lck that was responsible for binding to the cytoplasmic region of SAP-1 by yeast two-hybrid analysis. We found that the region of Lck comprising residues 154–242 bound to the cytoplasmic region of SAP-1, whereas the region comprising amino acids 243–509 did not, suggesting that the middle portion of Lck (residues 154–242) is responsible, at least in part, for binding to SAP-1 (Fig. 1B). We next examined whether the cytoplasmic region of SAP-1 interacts with Lck directly in vitro. Lysates of human Jurkat T cells, which express endogenous Lck, were incubated with an immobilized GST fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic region of SAP-1 (GST-SAP-1-WT) or with GST alone. Lck specifically bound to GST-SAP-1-WT but not to GST (Fig. 2A). We then examined the binding of Lck to SAP-1 in COS-7 cells transfected with expression vectors for full-length Lck and the Myc epitope-tagged cytoplasmic region of SA"
