https://openalex.org/W1965339474,"The response of female boll weevils to males, Anthonomus grandis Boheman, in laboratory bioassays can be reproduced by exposure to a mixture of compounds I, II, and either III or IV, all isolated from male weevils and their fecal material. The same response was elicited by mixtures of tile synthesized coimpounds. Compound I is (+)-cis-2-isopropenyl-l-methylcyclobtutaneethanol; II, cis-3,3-dimethiyl->(1,beta)cyclohexaneethanol; III, cis-3,3-dimethlyl->(1,alpha)-cyclohexaneacetaldehyde; and IV, trans-3,3-dimethyl->(1,alpha)-cyclohexanecetaldehyde."
https://openalex.org/W1989864553,"Laughing gull chicks between 6 and 13 days old responded to the calls of their own parents with orientation toward the sound, approach, increased locomotion, and vocalization. In response to the same kinds of calls from other adults they tended to orient away from the sound, withdraw, and sit or crouch. Chicks as young as 6 days can identify their parents from individual characteristics in the calls of adult gulls."
https://openalex.org/W1969198174,Meander patterns produced by ancient sediment feeders can be simulated by digital computer with x-y plotter output. Change in input constants (with a single program) produces variation comparable to genetically controlled behavioral differences between species and genera.
https://openalex.org/W2026931651,"Silica is present in significant amount in mature guard and subsidiary cells of stomata, in trichomes and silica cells, and in the walls of long eidermal cells of Avena. No silica was detectable in cork cells of cork-silica cell pairs. Silica must be accumulated in these specialized epidermal cells quite rapidly."

https://openalex.org/W2026791773,"Stable and radioactive isotope studies of ancient corals and mollusks from a fossil atoll in the Afar Rift indicate that final separation of the Afar Depression from the Red Sea occurred not earlier than 32,000 years ago. Desiccation followed within a few thousand years. The events recorded in the Afar Rift illustrate the processes occurring in the incipient stages leading to the formation of an oceanic body by rifting of a continental block."
https://openalex.org/W1986828508,"A structure for ""polywater"" is proposed. It consists of hydrogen-bonded clusters of water molecules lying at the vertices of rhombic dodecahedra. This structure contains features which are less unattractive than those which are part of several earlier models."
https://openalex.org/W1976321326,The volume of sediment off the Atlantic Coast of the United States is at least six times as great as that off the Pacific Coast. This disparity is readily accounted for if the continent is drifting westward and has overrun large volumes of sediment on a former Benioff zone. Such an overrunning is also consonant with many features of the geology of the western United States.
https://openalex.org/W2071017609,A first attempt to measure directly the magnetic polarity of submarine basalts dredged from the Reykjanes Ridge indicates that the first two magnetic anomalies over the ridge resulted from a reversal of the earth's magnetic field. Volcanic criteria were used to determine the orientation the samples had before they were dredged from the sea floor.
https://openalex.org/W2006216433,"Rocket-borne radiometer determinations of ozone distributions by absorption of ultraviolet sunlight show anomalous effects near 3000 angstroms. The instrument uses four 40-angstrom filters in the spectral region between 2650 and 3300 angstroms. At altitudes below 40 kilometers, signals from filters centered near 3000 angstroms appear reduced at least 25 percent below calculated values. However, at higher altitudes an unpredicted sharp increase in signals is observed. These effects are inconsistent with ozone absorption and cannot be ascribed to instrument characteristics. A previously unobserved absorption band of an atmospheric constituent, possibly the metastable excited states of molecular oxygen O2(1Δg) or O2(1 σg+), can account for the anomalous effects."
