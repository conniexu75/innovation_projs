https://openalex.org/W2062491099,"An outstanding goal in quantum information science is the faithful mapping of quantum information between a stable quantum memory and a reliable quantum communication channel. This would allow, for example, quantum communication over remote distances, quantum teleportation of matter and distributed quantum computing over a 'quantum internet'. Because quantum states cannot in general be copied, quantum information can only be distributed in these and other applications by entangling the quantum memory with the communication channel. Here we report quantum entanglement between an ideal quantum memory--represented by a single trapped 111Cd+ ion--and an ideal quantum communication channel, provided by a single photon that is emitted spontaneously from the ion. Appropriate coincidence measurements between the quantum states of the photon polarization and the trapped ion memory are used to verify their entanglement directly. Our direct observation of entanglement between stationary and 'flying' qubits is accomplished without using cavity quantum electrodynamic techniques or prepared non-classical light sources. We envision that this source of entanglement may be used for a variety of quantum communication protocols and for seeding large-scale entangled states of trapped ion qubits for scalable quantum computing."
https://openalex.org/W1985693611,"A large number of synthetic and natural compounds self-organize into bulk phases exhibiting periodicities on the 10-8–10-6 metre scale1 as a consequence of their molecular shape, degree of amphiphilic character and, often, the presence of additional non-covalent interactions. Such phases are found in lyotropic systems2 (for example, lipid–water, soap–water), in a range of block copolymers3 and in thermotropic (solvent-free) liquid crystals4. The resulting periodicity can be one-dimensional (lamellar phases), two-dimensional (columnar phases) or three dimensional (‘micellar’ or ‘bicontinuous’ phases). All such two- and three-dimensional structures identified to date obey the rules of crystallography and their symmetry can be described, respectively, by one of the 17 plane groups or 230 space groups. The ‘micellar’ phases have crystallographic counterparts in transition-metal alloys, where just one metal atom is equivalent to a 103 - 104-atom micelle. However, some metal alloys are known to defy the rules of crystallography and form so-called quasicrystals, which have rotational symmetry other than the allowed two-, three-, four- or six-fold symmetry5. Here we show that such quasiperiodic structures can also exist in the scaled-up micellar phases, representing a new mode of organization in soft matter."

https://openalex.org/W1986015396,"Most animals reproduce until they die, but in humans, females can survive long after ceasing reproduction. In theory, a prolonged post-reproductive lifespan will evolve when females can gain greater fitness by increasing the success of their offspring than by continuing to breed themselves. Although reproductive success is known to decline in old age, it is unknown whether women gain fitness by prolonging lifespan post-reproduction. Using complete multi-generational demographic records, we show that women with a prolonged post-reproductive lifespan have more grandchildren, and hence greater fitness, in pre-modern populations of both Finns and Canadians. This fitness benefit arises because post-reproductive mothers enhance the lifetime reproductive success of their offspring by allowing them to breed earlier, more frequently and more successfully. Finally, the fitness benefits of prolonged lifespan diminish as the reproductive output of offspring declines. This suggests that in female humans, selection for deferred ageing should wane when one's own offspring become post-reproductive and, correspondingly, we show that rates of female mortality accelerate as their offspring terminate reproduction."

https://openalex.org/W2147115561,"Increased vascular permeability is a key feature of inflammatory conditions. In severe infections, leakage of plasma from the vasculature induces a life-threatening hypotension. Streptococcus pyogenes, a major human bacterial pathogen, causes a toxic shock syndrome (STSS) characterized by excessive plasma leakage and multi-organ failure. Here we find that M protein, released from the streptococcal surface, forms complexes with fibrinogen, which by binding to beta2 integrins of neutrophils, activate these cells. As a result, neutrophils release heparin binding protein, an inflammatory mediator inducing vascular leakage. In mice, injection of M protein or subcutaneous infection with S. pyogenes causes severe pulmonary damage characterized by leakage of plasma and blood cells. These lesions were prevented by treatment with a beta2 integrin antagonist. In addition, M protein/fibrinogen complexes were identified in tissue biopsies from a patient with necrotizing fasciitis and STSS, further underlining the pathogenic significance of such complexes in severe streptococcal infections."
https://openalex.org/W1967846737,"Amazonian rainforests are some of the most species-rich tree communities on earth. Here we show that, over the past two decades, forests in a central Amazonian landscape have experienced highly nonrandom changes in dynamics and composition. Our analyses are based on a network of 18 permanent plots unaffected by any detectable disturbance. Within these plots, rates of tree mortality, recruitment and growth have increased over time. Of 115 relatively abundant tree genera, 27 changed significantly in population density or basal area--a value nearly 14 times greater than that expected by chance. An independent, eight-year study in nearby forests corroborates these shifts in composition. Contrary to recent predictions, we observed no increase in pioneer trees. However, genera of faster-growing trees, including many canopy and emergent species, are increasing in dominance or density, whereas genera of slower-growing trees, including many subcanopy species, are declining. Rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations may explain these changes, although the effects of this and other large-scale environmental alterations remain uncertain. These compositional changes could have important impacts on the carbon storage, dynamics and biota of Amazonian forests."

https://openalex.org/W1978955250,"Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated responses, which are induced by the lipid A portion of lipopolysaccharide, are important for host defense against Salmonellae infection. A variety of different data indicate that the acylation state of lipid A can alter TLR4-mediated responses. The S. typhimurium virulence gene product PhoP/PhoQ signals the presence of host microenvironments to regulate the expression of a lipid A 3-O-deacylase, PagL, and a lipid A palmitoyltransferase, PagP. We now demonstrate that 3-O-deacylation and palmitoylation of lipid A decreases its ability to induce TLR4-mediated signaling. Deacylated lipid A, deacylated and palmitoylated lipid A, palmitoylated lipid A, and unmodified lipid A species were purified from Escherichia coli heterologously expressing PagL and/or PagP. The purified lipid A preparations showed spectra of a single lipid A species on mass spectrometry and gave a single band on thin layer chromatography. The activity of purified lipid A species was examined using human and mouse cell lines that express recombinant human TLR4. Compared with unmodified lipid A, the modified lipid A species are 30–100-fold less active in the ability to induce NF-κB-dependent reporter activation. These results suggest that the lipid A modifications reduce TLR4-signaling as part of Salmonellae adaptation to host environments.

Innate immune responses, such as secretion of cytokines by macrophages, are induced by an array of microbial components including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TLC, thin layer chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight; HEK, human embryonic kidney; U, unmodified; D, deacylated; P, palmitoylated; DP, deacylated and palmitoylated; luc, luciferase; Pag or pag,PhoP-activated gene. 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TLC, thin layer chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight; HEK, human embryonic kidney; U, unmodified; D, deacylated; P, palmitoylated; DP, deacylated and palmitoylated; luc, luciferase; Pag or pag,PhoP-activated gene. (1Beutler B. Rietschel E.T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). LPS-hyporesponsive mutant mice, C3H/HeJ, are highly susceptible to infection by Gram-negative bacteria such as Salmonella typhimurium (2O'Brien A.D. Rosenstreich D.L. Scher I. Campbell G.H. MacDermott R.P. Formal S.B. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 20-24PubMed Google Scholar) and Escherichia coli (3Cross A.S. Sadoff J.C. Kelly N. Bernton E. Gemski P. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 2021-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), suggesting the importance of LPS-induced responses for host defense against bacterial infection. It has been shown that a point mutation in the cytoplasmic portion of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is responsible for the LPS hyporesponsiveness of C3H/HeJ mice (4Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.-Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoil P. Layton B. Beutler B.

Med. 1999; 189: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). Involvement of TLR4 in LPS-induced signaling was unequivocally demonstrated by the generation of TLR4-deficient mice (6Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Ogawa T. Takeda Y. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3749-3752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, MD-2, a molecule that physically associates with extracellular portion of TLR4, has been shown to be essential for TLR4-dependent LPS signaling (7Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1746) Google Scholar, 8Nagai Y. Akashi S. Nagafuku M. Ogata M. Iwakura Y. Akira S. Kitamura T. Kosugi A. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). The TLR4·MD-2 complex directly interacts with LPS (9Akashi S. Saitoh S.-i. Wakabayashi Y. Kikuchi T. Takamura N. Nagai Y. Kusumoto Y. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Adachi Y. Kosugi A. Miyake K. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 10Visintin A. Latz E. Monks B.G. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48313-48320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), especially with its hydrophobic membrane anchor portion of lipid A (9Akashi S. Saitoh S.-i. Wakabayashi Y. Kikuchi T. Takamura N. Nagai Y. Kusumoto Y. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Adachi Y. Kosugi A. Miyake K. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), suggesting that the TLR4·MD-2 complex is an essential component for LPS recognition. Lipid A is the bioactive component of LPS that is also known as endotoxin (11Raetz C.R.H. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3356) Google Scholar). The structure of lipid A is relatively conserved among different pathogenic bacteria. Lipid A of E. coli and S. typhimurium is a β,1′-6-linked disaccharide of glucosamine phosphorylated at the 1 and 4′ positions and acylated at 2, 3, 2′, and 3′ positions with R-3-hydroxymyristate. The OH groups of the R-3-hydroxymyristate chains that are attached at positions 2′ and 3′ are further acylated with laurate and myristate, respectively (Fig. 1) (11Raetz C.R.H. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3356) Google Scholar). S. typhymurium synthesizes enzymes in response to environmental conditions that perform covalent modifications of lipid A (11Raetz C.R.H. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3356) Google Scholar). Changes in lipid A acylation require the two component regulatory system PhoP/PhoQ (12Guo L. Lim K.B. Gunn J.S. Bainbridge B. Darveau R.P. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Science. 1997; 276: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), which is essential for Salmonellae virulence for mice (13Miller S.I. Kukral A.M. Mekalanos J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5054-5058Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) and humans (14Hohmann E.L. Oletta C.A. Killeen K.P. Miller S.I. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 173: 1408-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). PhoQ is a sensor histidine kinase that responds to environmental conditions, which include those within mammalian tissues, such as macrophage phagosomes and those that destabilize the bacterial membrane such as magnesium-limited growth medium and exposure to antimicrobial peptides (15Scherer C.A. Miller S.I. Groisman E.A. Principles of Bacterial Pathogenesis. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2001: 265-333Crossref Google Scholar, 16Bader M.W. Navarre W.W. Shiau W. Nikaido H. Frye J.G. McClelland M. Fang F.C. Miller S.I. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In response to specific environmental signals, PhoQ phosphorylates PhoP, leading to the activation or repression of over 40 different genes (15Scherer C.A. Miller S.I. Groisman E.A. Principles of Bacterial Pathogenesis. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2001: 265-333Crossref Google Scholar) including the genes involved in lipid A modifications such as the PhoP-activated gene pagL (17Trent M.S. Pabich W. Raetz C.R.H. Miller S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9083-9092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and pagP (18Guo L. Lim K.B. Poduje C.M. Daniel M. Gunn J.S. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Cell. 1998; 95: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 19Bishop R.E. Gibbons H.S. Guina T. Trent M.S. Miller S.I. Raetz C.R.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5071-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). PagP encodes a palmitoyltransferase that is located in the bacterial outer membrane (19Bishop R.E. Gibbons H.S. Guina T. Trent M.S. Miller S.I. Raetz C.R.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5071-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). It transfers palmitate from glycerophospholipids in the inner leaflet of the outer membrane to the outer leaflet, which is almost exclusively composed of lipid A. This remodeling of the outer membrane increases bacterial resistance against antimicrobial peptides (18Guo L. Lim K.B. Poduje C.M. Daniel M. Gunn J.S. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Cell. 1998; 95: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Previously, when a heterogeneous mixture of modified LPS species from S. typhimurium was analyzed for proinflammatory responses, a reduction in LPS-induced cytokine production was observed in human umbilical cord endothelial cells (12Guo L. Lim K.B. Gunn J.S. Bainbridge B. Darveau R.P. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Science. 1997; 276: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). This finding suggested that bacterial cell surface remodeling upon infection of a host, i.e. specific LPS modification, might benefit the bacteria by reducing host innate immune responses. Consistent with this possibility, synthetic palmitoylated lipid A (P-lipid A) had reduced signaling in human macrophage-like cell lines (20Tanamoto K.-i. Azumi S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3149-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). PagL has been shown to encode lipid A 3-O-deacylase located in the outer membrane, but the biological function of the 3-O-deacylation is unknown (17Trent M.S. Pabich W. Raetz C.R.H. Miller S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9083-9092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Salmonellae are intracellular pathogens, and they are unique among enteric bacteria in having pagL in its genome, suggesting a specific function of PagL in Salmonellae pathogenesis. A possible function of pagL is modulation of lipid A recognition by the TLR4·MD-2 complex. To address this issue, we purified 3-O-deacylated lipid A species and show here that 3-O-deacyltion of lipid A decreases its activity to induce cellular signaling through TLR4. Materials—All of the chemicals were reagent grade or better. Restriction endonucleases and DNA modifying enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and Invitrogen. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) Silica Gel 60 and HPTLC plates were from EM Science (Gibbstown, NJ). Oligonucleotides were prepared commercially by Invitrogen. QiaPrep spin miniprep kit and QiaQuick gel extraction kit were from Qiagen. p-Anisardehyde was from Sigma. Plasmids—The PagL coding region was amplified from pWLP21 (17Trent M.S. Pabich W. Raetz C.R.H. Miller S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9083-9092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) by PCR with Pfu Turbo (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers used for the PCR were PagL-N-NcoI (5′-ATCATGCCATGGGCATGAAGAGAATATTTATATAT-3′) and PagL-C-term (5′-CGCGGATCCTCAGAAATTATAACTAATTGA-3′). The PagP coding region was amplified from pLG18 (18Guo L. Lim K.B. Poduje C.M. Daniel M. Gunn J.S. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Cell. 1998; 95: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) by PCR with primers PagP-N-term (5′-TCAATTAGTTATAATTTCTGAAGGAGGAATTCACCATGATCATCAGAAAGTATTTTCTT-3′) and PagP-C-PstI (5′-GAACTGCAGTCAAAACTGGAAACGCATCCAG-3′). The amplified DNA fragments containing PagL or PagP were linked by PCR with primers PagL-N-KpnI (5′-CCATGGTACCCATGAAGAGAATATTTATATAT-3′) and PagP-C-PstI. The linked reaction product was cloned into KpnI/PstI sites of pBAD24 (21Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3941) Google Scholar), and the resulting expression construct was named pBAD24-PagL-PagP. The PagP coding region was amplified from pLG18 (18Guo L. Lim K.B. Poduje C.M. Daniel M. Gunn J.S. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Cell. 1998; 95: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) by PCR with primers PagP-N-KpnI (5′-CCATGGTACCCATGATCATCAGAAAGTATTTTC-3′) and PagP-C-PstI. The reaction product was cloned into KpnI/PstI site of pBAD24 (21Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3941) Google Scholar) under control of the arabinose PBAD promoter, and the resulting expression construct was named pBAD24-PagP. The inserts of the expression constructs were verified by sequencing at the biochemistry DNA sequencing facility at University of Washington. Purification of Lipid A Species—For the preparation of deacetylated lipid A (D-lipid A) and deacetylated and palmitoylated lipid A (DP-lipid A) species (Fig. 1), E. coli strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene) was transformed with pBAD24-PagL-PagP. The transformant was cultivated at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin until A600 = ∼0.5, and then expressions of recombinant PagL and PagP were induced by the addition of l-(+)-arabinose (2 mg/ml). After cultivation for 4 h in the presence of arabinose, cells were collected. Preparation of lipid A was performed as described previously (22Zhou Z. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18503-18514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The prepared lipid A was dissolved in chloroform/methanol (4:1, v/v) and applied in a line to Silica Gel 60 TLC plates (EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ). The plates were developed in n-propanol/water/28% ammonium hydroxide (75:5:25, v/v). The bands containing lipid A species were transiently visualized by spraying water, and then a band (Rf = ∼0.22) that contains both D-lipid A and DP-lipid A species was scraped off of the plates. Extraction of lipid A species from silica gel was performed as described previously (22Zhou Z. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18503-18514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Extracted lipid A species were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (4:1, v/v) and applied in a line to Silica Gel 60 TLC plates. The plates were developed in chloroform/pyridine/88% formic acid/methanol/water (60:35:10:5:2, v/v), which was previously used for analysis of lipid A species (23Que N.L. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28006-28016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The bands containing D-lipid A or DP-lipid A species were extracted from silica gel as described above. Identification of lipid A species was performed by mass spectrometry (see below). For the preparation of U-lipid A and P-lipid A (Fig. 1), XL1-Blue strain was transformed with pBAD24-PagP. Induction of recombinant PagP and preparation of lipid A were performed as described above. The prepared lipid A was dissolved in chloroform/methanol (4:1, v/v) and applied in a line to Silica Gel 60 TLC plates. The plates were developed in chloroform/pyridine/88% formic acid/methanol/water (60:35:10:5:2, v/v). The bands containing lipid A species were extracted from silica gel as described above. Quantification of lipid A species was performed by measuring the amount of phosphate as described previously (24Rouser G. Siakotos A.N. Fleischer S. Lipids. 1966; 1: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. 140 μl of 70% perchloric acid were added to dried samples. After incubation at 150 °C for 1 h, 800 μl of water/1.25% ammonium molybdate/10% ascorbic acid (5:2:1, v/v/v) was added to the sample mixture and incubate at 100 °C for 5 min. Absorbance at 820 nm then was measured. Potassium phosphate was used as standard for quantification. From a 2,000-ml culture of E. coli transformed with pBAD24-PagL-PagP, 16.6 μg of D-lipid A and 15.7 μg of DP-lipid A species were purified. From a 100-ml culture of E. coli transformed with pBAD24-PagP, 10.8 μg of U-lipid A and 23.6 μg of P-lipid A species were purified. Mass Spectrometry (MS)—Samples were dissolved in 20 mg/ml 5-chloro-2-mercaptobenzothiazole matrixes in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). Spectra were obtained in the negative reflection mode using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) Bruker BiflexIII mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Inc., Billerica, MA). Each spectrum was the average of 200 shots. Lipid A from S. typhimurium Re-mutant (Ribi Immunochem Research, Inc., Hamilton, MT) was used as an external mass calibrant. Mammalian Cell Lines and Cell Culture—A mouse pro-B cell line, Ba/F3, stably expressing epitope-tagged human TLR4, epitope-tagged human MD-2, and p55Igκluc, a NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter construct, was a generous gift from Dr. K. Miyake (7Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1354-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) were introduced into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell line. The transformant was purified by limited dilution and was named 293/hTLR4/hMD2. 293/luc, a HEK293 cell line introduced with p55Igκluc, was established previously (30Kawasaki K. Gomi K. Nishijima M.

Luciferase Assay—100 μl of cell culture in a well of 96-well dish (Costar, Cambridge, MA) were lysed by the addition of 25 μl of 5× cell culture lysis reagent (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was measured using 20 μl of lysate and 100 μl of luciferase assay substrate (Promega). The luminescence was quantified with a luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems, Oak Ridge, TN). Purification of 3-O-Deacylated and/or Palmitoylated Lipid A Species—Four species of differently acylated lipid A are generated by the modifications catalyzed by PagL and/or PagP (Fig. 1). We here named these species unmodified lipid A, deacylated lipid A, palmitoylated lipid A, deacylated and palmitoylated lipid A as U-lipid A, D-lipid A, P-lipid A, and DP-lipid A, respectively (Fig. 1). To generate and purify the lipid A species, a heterologous E. coli expression system was established. E. coli XL1-Blue strain was transformed with pBAD24-PagL-PagP, a PagL and PagP expression construct, or pBAD24-PagP, a PagP expression construct. Lipid A species of the strains were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. The negative-ion spectrum of lipid A prepared from E. coli transformed with pBAD24-PagL-PagP demonstrated major peaks at m/z 1571.9, 1798.4, 1810.5, and 2036.9 (Fig. 2A), and their structures were interpreted as D-lipid A, U-lipid A, DP-lipid A, and P-lipid A, respectively (Fig. 1) (17Trent M.S.

The negative-ion spectrum of lipid A prepared from E. coli transformed with pBAD24-PagP demonstrated major peaks at m/z 1798.2 and 2036.7 (Fig. 2B), and their structures were interpreted as U-lipid A and P-lipid A, respectively (Fig. 1) (18Guo L. Lim K.B. Poduje C.M. Daniel M. Gunn J.S. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Cell. 1998; 95: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). These results show that the 3-O-deacylated and/or palmitoylated lipid A species are generated by the heterologous E. coli expression system. D-lipid A and DP-lipid A species were prepared from E. coli transformed with pBAD24-PagL-PagP, and U-lipid A and P-lipid A species were prepared from E. coli transformed with pBAD-PagP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The negative-ion spectrum of each lipid A preparation demonstrated a major peak at m/z 1810.2, 1571.7, 1798.3, and 2036.7, and their structures were interpreted as DP-lipid A, D-lipid A, U-lipid A, and P-lipid A, respectively (Fig. 3A). In addition, minor peaks, m/z values of which are +22 or -28 of that of the major peak (Fig. 3A), such as m/z 1832.2 and 1782.1 in DP-lipid A (m/z 1810.2) preparation were observed (Fig. 3Aa). The +22 peaks were interpreted as sodium adducts. To ensure that individual lipid A species were isolated, 1 μg of the prepared lipid A species was analyzed by TLC under the solvent system that was used for the final purification step. Each lipid A preparation showed a single band with similar intensity (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these results indicate that each of the lipid A species, U-, D-, P-, and DP-lipid A, was purified. 3-O-Deacylated and/or Palmitoylated Lipid A Species Show Decreased Ability to Induce NF-κB Activation through TLR4 — To investigate the biological effect of 3-O-deacylation and/or palmitoylation of lipid A in S. typhimurium, we examined whether the modification(s) of lipid A changed its ability to induce NF-kB activation through TLR4. Mouse pro-B cell line Ba/F3 and HEK293 cell lines, both of which confer LPS responsiveness by expressions of TLR4 and MD-2 (7Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), were used for the analysis. Purified U-lipid A induced TLR4-MD-2-dependent NF-κB activation on Ba/hTLR4/hMD2 and 293/hTLR4/hMD2 cells (Fig. 4A). Ba/hTLR4/hMD2 and 293/hTLR4/hMD2 cells then were stimulated with various concentrations of the purified lipid A species, U-, D-, P-, and DP-lipid A. The Ba/hTLR4/hMD2 cell line showed ∼10-fold induced reporter activation on 0.1 ng/ml U-lipid A, 3 ng/ml P-lipid A, 3–10 ng/ml D-lipid A, or 10 ng/ml DP-lipid A stimulation (Fig. 4B), suggesting that modified lipid A species are from 30- to 100-fold less active in induction of Ba/hTLR4/hMD2 cell NF-κB activation. To further confirm this result, 293/hTLR4/hMD2 cells were also tested. These cells show ∼5–10-fold induced reporter activation on exposure to 10–30 ng/ml U-lipid A or 1,000 ng/ml of D-lipid A, P-lipid A, or DP-lipid A stimulation, indicating that modified lipid A species are from 30- to 100-fold less active in induction of 293/hTLR4/hMD2 cell NF-κB activation. (Fig. 4C). In this paper, we purified lipid A species modified by the S. typhimurium PhoP/PhoQ-regulated outermembrane enzyme, PagL and/or PagP. Using the purified lipid A species, we demonstrated that Salmonellae lipid A 3-O-deacylation by PagL and palmitoylation by PagP reduces the activity of lipid A in inducing cellular signaling through TLR4. These results are consistent with the results reported by Hajjar et al. (31Hajjar A.M. Ernst R.K. Tsai J.H. Wilson C.B. Miller S.I. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) that indicate that lipid A species from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which consistently express a 3-O-deacylase, are less active than hexa-acylated lipid A from E. coli for induction of signaling through human TLR4. Recently, using synthetic lipid A mimetics, Stover et al. (32Stover A.G. da Silva Correia J. Evans J.T. Cluff C.W. Elliott M.W. Jeffery E.W. Johnson D.A. Lacy M.J. Baldridge J.R. Probst P.

Chem. 2004; 279: 4440-4449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) described that a hexa-acylated structure may be optimum for human TLR4 signaling, perhaps by adopting a conical-like structure that has been postulated to be associated with agonist activity. Our results are consistent with their results in that penta-acylated D-lipid A and heptaacylated P-lipid A are less active than hexa-acylated U-lipid A. However, our results also indicate that a hexa-acylated DP-lipid A is less active than U-lipid A. These results suggest that TLR4-dependent lipid A signaling is not simply related to the number of fatty acids but also to their location and length on the glucosamine backbone. This work also suggests that inactivation of lipid A by 3-O-deacylation and palmitoylation of lipid A to reduce TLR4-signaling could be an important strategy of pathogenic Salmonellae. Recent results with synthetic lipid A mimetics indicate that different structures can stimulate different gene expression profiles (32Stover A.G. da Silva Correia J. Evans J.T. Cluff C.W. Elliott M.W. Jeffery E.W. Johnson D.A. Lacy M.J. Baldridge J.R. Probst P. Ulevitch R.J. Persing D.H. Hershberg R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4440-4449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition to the potential benefit to intracellular Salmonellae of reduction in TLR4-signaling, deacylation of lipid A could also result in an alteration of the pattern of host cell gene expression in infected cells. Therefore, such modifications of lipid A by PagL and/or PagP may enable S. typhimurium to escape maximum recognition by TLR4·MD-2 complex and alter host cell responses that could promote intracellular survival."

Development of the mammalian embryo relies upon nutritive functions fulfilled by the visceral endoderm and then by the liver (1Meehan R.R. Barlow D.P. Hill R.E. Hogan B.L.M. Hastie N.D. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1881-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A part of these functions is accomplished by nutrient carrier proteins of the albumin gene family, a multigene locus expressed by the liver and subject to precise developmental controls.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5481-5484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In 1988, our group circumscribed a proximal AFP promoter element essential to AFP gene activity in hepatocytes, and distinct from promoter components regulating the other albumin loci (4Guertin M.

The AFP-specific activator was then identified as orphan receptor fetoprotein transcription factor (5Bernier D. Thomassin H. Allard D. Guertin M. Hamel D. Blaquière M. Beauchemin M. LaRue H.

NR5A2 in the nuclear receptor nomenclature, Ref. 9Nuclear Receptors Nomenclature CommitteeCell. 1999; 97: 161-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar); also referred to as LRH1 or CPF). FTF belonged to a primitive class of nuclear receptors and emerged as a critical lead to connect AFP gene activation with early embryonic growth and differentiation processes. Subsequent studies indicated that developmental FTF functions even preceded its activation of the AFP locus in hepatocytes. In situ hybridization analysis in the mouse at embryonic day 8–9 showed abundant FTF transcripts in the foregut endoderm, before liver morphogenesis (10Rausa F.M. Galarneau L. Bélanger L. Costa R.H. Mech. Dev. 1999; 89: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Characterization of the FTF gene promoter also revealed a cluster of regulatory motifs conserved in distant species and potential targets of cell lineage specification factors (11Paré J.-F. Roy S. Galarneau L. Bélanger L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13136-13144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Among these were three proximal binding sites for GATA factors, known to be essential for visceral endoderm function (12Narita N. Bielinska M. Wilson D.B. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 13Morrisey E.E. Tang Z. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Jiang F. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3579-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Furthermore, three HNF genes important to liver differentiation, HNF1α, HNF4α, and HNF3β, were found to each contain double FTF-binding sites in their proximal promoter and to be activated by FTF in transfection assays (11Paré J.-F. Roy S. Galarneau L. Bélanger L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13136-13144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, a pivotal role was suggested for FTF in a transcriptional cascade using determination factors to activate FTF in prehepatic endodermal cells, and then using FTF to drive AFP and other effectors of the hepatic program. Besides functions in early development, FTF was expected to maintain important nutritive roles in the adult, FTF being maintained at high levels in liver, intestine, and acinar pancreas. A landmark finding was the identification of FTF as one factor that binds and regulates the CYP7A1 gene promoter, the rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids (BA) (14Nitta M.

A model emerged whereby FTF would act as a “competence” factor driving the BA pathway, subject to negative feedback regulation by interaction of FTF with orphan receptor SHP, activated by the BA receptor FXR and by FTF itself (15Lu T.T.

Here we document an FTF-lacZ gene knockout in the mouse, delineating FTF expression sites at all developmental stages and confirming crucial developmental and metabolic FTF functions from early embryogenesis to adulthood. We also identify a promoter DR4 regulatory element directly connecting FTF gene regulation with hormonal and metabolic homeostasis. FTF Gene Inactivation—A 7.5-kb SpeI mFTF gene fragment encompassing exons 4–6 was retrieved from a mouse 129/SV genomic library screened with rat FTF cDNA (11Paré J.-F. Roy S. Galarneau L. Bélanger L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13136-13144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The 7.5-kb fragment was used to generate a knockout vector carrying a lacZ gene inserted in-frame into mFTF exon 4. Briefly, a 4-kb lacZ fragment was derived from vector pCH110 (Amersham Biosciences) using PstI, S1 nuclease, and KpnI, and spliced into pSVK3 (Invitrogen) pretreated with EcoRI, Klenow, and KpnI. Recombinant pSVK3-lacZ was digested with SmaI/XbaI and ligated with the 5′-end mFTF gene fragment obtained with BglII (which cuts exon 4 at position 462 in the sequence shown in Ref. 6Galarneau L.

This placed lacZ (with a stop codon and polyadenylation signal at its end) in phase with the N-terminal portion of mFTF exon 4, interrupting the FTF sequence upstream from the first zinc finger of the DNA binding domain (11Paré J.-F. Roy S. Galarneau L. Bélanger L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13136-13144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). An MC1-neo cassette was ligated to the 3′-BglII mFTF fragment and inserted downstream from lacZ in the opposite polarity, and an MC1-tk cassette was inserted at the 5′-SpeI end of the FTF gene fragment. The construct was then used for electroporation into ES cells. This knockout vector predicted that an FTF-lacZ allele would transcribe a 4-kb FTF-lacZ mRNA in all FTF-permissive cells (i.e. from either the mFTF promoter 5′-flanking exon 1, or any other putative promoter elements between exons 1 and 3) (11Paré J.-F.

For gene targeting in embryonic stem (ES) cells, mouse WW6 (129SV) ES cells (23Ioffe E. Liu Y. Bhaumik M. Poirier F. Factor S.M. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

ES cells were electroporated with FTF-lacZ plasmid DNA linearized with NotI, and cultured on neomycin-resistant STO fibroblasts for 14 days in selection medium containing 200 μg/ml G418 and 2 μm ganciclovir. Resistant colonies were genotyped by Southern blot using a mFTF probe flanking the SpeI site in intron 3 and detecting a 3.8-kb StuI fragment from the wild-type FTF allele and a 7.8-kb fragment from the mutant allele. Four ES clones carrying the lacZ-FTF allele were injected into mouse MF1 blastocysts which were then transferred to pseudopregnant C57BL/6J × CBA mice. The chimeric male progeny (129SV × MF1) was crossed with MF1 females to establish germ line transmission, and subsequent breeding was maintained in the 129SV × MF1 genetic background. Mice were housed in filter-topped microisolator cages, under 50–70 air changes per hour and 10:14 h dark/light cycle, and fed on Teklad standard chow TD2018. Neonatal mice were genotyped using tail DNA, by Southern blot as above or by PCR with neo gene primers 5′-GGGATCGGCCATTGAACAAGATGG-3′ and 5′-CGTAAAGCACGAGGAAGCGGTCAG-3′. Embryos from E9.5 onward were genotyped by Southern blot using yolk sac DNA. At E7.5 and E8.5, whole-embryo DNA was used with PCR primers from FTF exon 4 (5′-flanking the BglII lacZ insertion site) (ATGGTGAATTACTCCTATGATGAAG) and FTF exon 5 (GTAGGGACATCGTTTTCTCTGCC), generating a 1.7-kb product only from a wild-type FTF allele; the FTF primers also amplified a 204-bp segment from the FTF pseudogene (11Paré J.-F.

At E5.5 and E6.5, we used in situ hybridization (below) to distinguish FTF-/- embryos from FTF+/+ or FTF+/- embryos. In Situ Hybridization—Conditions were adapted from Aubin et al. (25Aubin J.

Embryos were fixed 15–20 h in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, dehydrated in ethanol and toluene, and embedded in paraffin. Whole mount sections (8 μm) were treated with xylene, ethanol and 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, and then treated for 7.5 min with proteinase K (20 μg/ml in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA), washed with PBS and treated again with 4% paraformaldehyde and PBS. This was followed by a 10-min incubation in 0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1 m triethanolamine, pH 8.0, washes in PBS, saline, and water, and dehydration in ethanol gradients (30–100%). Slides were then overlaid with 150 μl of 1:1 mix of formamide (Fisher Super Pure) and hybridization buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1.2 m NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 2× Denhardt's, 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 200 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Hybridization was conducted with 5 × 106 cpm of riboprobe overlaid on tissue sections in 75 μl of a 2:2:1 mix of hybridization buffer:formamide: 50% dextran sulfate and overnight incubation at 65 °C with a coverslip. Slides were then washed twice at 50 °C with 5× SSC and 10 mm dithiothreitol, once at 65 °C with 2× SSC, 50% formamide, and 20 mm dithiothreitol, followed by RNase A treatment (50 μg/ml), washes at 65 °C in 2× SSC and 50% formamide then at room temperature in 2× SSC and 0.1× SSC, and dehydration in ethanol gradients in 0.3 m NaOAc, pH 5.5. Slides were embedded in a Kodak emulsion and left 2–4 weeks in a dark dessicator at 4 °C. They were developed with the Kodak D19 reagent and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. LacZ Activity—Expression from the FTF/lacZ transgene was monitored by β-galactosidase staining on whole embryos or cryostat tissue sections, essentially as described by Larochelle et al. (27Larochelle C. Tremblay M. Bernier D. Aubin J. Jeannotte L. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 214: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Embryos were fixed 5–30 min at 4 °C with 0.2% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed three times with PBS, and stained 15–20 h at 30 °C in 4 mm K4Fe(CN)6·3H2O, 4 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml X-gal in PBS. Morulae and blastocysts were treated with 0.5% Pronase 10 min at 37 °C before fixation. For tissue sections, organs were incubated overnight in 30% sucrose in PBS and embedded in OCT before freezing. Microarray Analysis—Liver gene expression profiles were established in 2–4-month-old male FTF+/- and FTF+/+ mice (groups of 4–6 littermates from 4 or 5 litters) fed a normal diet or a diet supplemented with cholesterol or cholic acid (below). Total liver RNA was purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), quantitated by spectroscopy and pooled (equal amounts of RNA from each mouse). RNA labeling, hybridization, and image analysis were performed at the McGill University Genome Quebec Innovation Center, using the Affymetrix U74Av2 and 430A GeneChip arrays and GENECHIP data processing software (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Fold changes in mRNA levels were calculated for fluorescence intensities greater than 250. Northern Blots—Total liver RNA was purified with guanidine thiocyanate (28Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar), and poly(A)+ RNA was isolated with the Oligotex mRNA Maxi Kit (Qiagen). Poly(A)+ RNA (15 μg) was run on a 1% agarose/10 mm guanidine thiocyanate gel, transferred onto a positively charged nylon membrane (Roche Applied Science), and hybridized with FTF, SHP, CYP7A1, and GAPDH cDNA probes PCR-labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Roche Applied Science). mRNA bands were detected with a chemiluminescence kit (Roche Applied Science) and quantitated with IMAGEQUANT (Molecular Dynamics). Quantitative PCR—Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to determine the relative expression levels of liver FTF, SHP, CYP7A1, c-Jun, HNF1α, and HNF4α mRNAs. Total RNA (5 μg) was reverse-transcribed with oligo(dT) primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was carried out with 0.5% of the reverse transcription product in a 20-μl reaction volume of Platinum SYBR Green qPCR superMix UDG (Invitrogen), using the Light-Cycler 1.2 instrument and software (Roche Applied Science) and the following sets of primers: FTF forward, 5′-CCTATGATGAAGATCTGGAAGAGC-3′; FTF reverse, 5′-GTTTTCTCTGCGTTTTGTCAATTT-3′; SHP forward, 5′-AGCTGGGTCCCAAGGAGTAT-3′; SHP reverse, 5′-CTTGAGGGTAGAGGCCATGA-3′; CYP7A1 forward, 5′-TCCTTGAATATCCGGACAGC-3′; CYP7A1 reverse, 5′-TGGTCTTTGCTTTCCCACTT-3′; c-Jun forward, 5′-TCCCCTATCGACATGGAGTC3′; c-Jun reverse, 5′-TGAGTTGGCACCCACTGTTA-3′; HNF1α forward 5′-GCCTCCTCTTCCCAGTAACC-3′; HNF1α reverse 5′-GGAGCAGCAGTGTCAATGAA-3′; HNF4α forward 5′-TCCCAACAGATCACCTCTCC-3′; HNF4α reverse 5′-AGGAGCAGCACGTCCTTAAA-3′; GAPDH forward 5′-ACCCAGAAGACTGTGGATGG-3′; GAPDH reverse 5′-CACATTGGGGGTAGGAACAC-3′. Each reaction was carried out in triplicate and repeated at least twice. Relative mRNA expression levels were calculated by ΔΔCT analysis, using GAPDH mRNA for internal normalization. Electromobility Shift and Scatchard Assays—Saturation electromobility shift analyses were conducted in 2-month-old FTF+/+ and FTF+/- mice, as described before (6Galarneau L. Paré J.-F. Allard D. Hamel D. Lévesque L. Tugwood J.D. Green S. Bélanger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3853-3865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Livers were pooled from five or more littermates per group, and tested in parallel. Five micrograms of total nuclear protein was incubated 30 min on ice with 0.9–9 nm 32P-labeled FTF probe TGTTCAAGGACA (from the AFP gene promoter) (6Galarneau L. Paré J.-F. Allard D. Hamel D. Lévesque L. Tugwood J.D. Green S. Bélanger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3853-3865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and FTF-bound and free double-strand probes were resolved by PAGE and counted with a phosphorimager. Nonspecific binding (50-fold excess cold oligo) was subtracted, and net counts were used to obtain a Scatchard plot. EMSA analysis of the DR4-like sequence at position +6/+21 in the mFTF gene promoter was carried out with mFTF probe -1AGACATGGTTTACAGCAGGTCATAC+24 (probe F), its mutated version AGACATcaTTTAgAGCAttTCATAC (mF oligo), and DR4 elements from the CYP7A1 promoter (TGCTTTGGTCACTCAAGTTCAAGTTAT) (oligo 7A) (17del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3587-3593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the ABC1 promoter (GCGCAGAGGTTACTATCGGTCAAAGCC) (oligo AB) (29Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28240-28245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). EMSAs used 3 μg of total nuclear proteins from adult rat liver and 0.2 ng of 32P-labeled F probe, coincubated 30 min at 4 °C with 20-fold molar excess of cold competitors. For EMSA-antibody assays, nuclear proteins were preincubated 1 h at 4 °C with 1 μl of antiserum against LXRα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology C19x), RXR (SCB ΔN197x, reacting against RXR α, β, and γ), TR (SCB FL-408x, reacting against TR α1 and β1), or FXR (SCB Q-20x). EMSA for HNF1 and HNF4 used probes GCTTAATCATTTCTT and GCAGGTGACCTTTGCCCAGCGCC and their mutant (lower case letters) version GCTTggTCATTTCTT and GCAGcTGcCCgTTtCgCAGCGCC. Western Blots—Western blot assays were used to determine the relative amounts of FTF, HNF1α, HNF4α, and C/EBPα proteins in liver nuclei from rats fed a high-cholesterol diet or treated with thyroid hormone (T3) (below). Total liver nuclear proteins (pooled from 5 rats) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Blotted membranes were blocked in TBS (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 m NaCl, 5% w/v nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Tween-20) 1 h at room temperature under agitation, and incubated 1 h with antisera against mouse FTF (1:1000 dilution in TBS), rat C/EBPα (1:10,000), human HNF4α (1:10,000) (Santa Cruz 6556x), or mouse HNF1α (1:1000) (BD Biosciences H69220). Membranes were washed four times in TBS and incubated for 1 h with a 1:10,000 TBS dilution of secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). After four more washes in TBS, reactions were developed using the Amersham Biosciences Enhanced Chemiluminescence System, and signals were quantitated using the NIH Image software. Samples from high cholesterol and T3 groups were analyzed in triplicate sets of 10 or 20 μg of nuclear proteins against standard curves run in parallel with 2.5–25 μg of liver nuclear proteins from control groups. Transfection Assays—Transfection assays were conducted with FTF reporter vector 4F-CAT, which carries mFTF gene segment -3.9 kb to +79 bp cloned into pBluescript SK-CAT (11Paré J.-F. Roy S. Galarneau L. Bélanger L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13136-13144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Point mutations were introduced in the FTF DR4-like element using PCR (11Paré J.-F. Roy S. Galarneau L. Bélanger L. J. Biol.

Cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (Wisent) (DMEM/FBS). Cells (106, in DMEM/FBS) were plated in 6-cm dishes and transfected 24 h later with 5 μg of 4F-CAT reporter vector, 2–5 μg of transcription factor expression vector (pSG5-hRXRα, pCMX-hLXRα, pCMX-T3Rβ) (pSG5 or pCMX vectors were used for reference transfections), and 2.5 μg of pCMV-lacZ as an internal standard. Transfected cells were washed after 16 h with HEPES pH 7.3 and cultured in DMEM/FBS without or with ligands (9-cis-retinoic acid (1 μm), 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (10 μm), or 3,3′,5-triiodothyronine (100 μm)) (Sigma). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and CAT activity was measured by thin layer chromatography and phosphorimaging. Wild-type and mutant 4F-CAT constructs were also assayed as stable transfectants in Morris McA-RH7777 rat hepatoma cells (variant 7777.6) (4Guertin M. LaRue H. Bernier D. Wrange O. Chevrette M. Gingras M.-C. Bélanger L. Mol. Cell.

Diets and Hormone Treatment—Serum cholesterol levels and liver gene expression profiles were analyzed in adult male FTF+/+ and FTF+/- mice (5 or more per group) fed for 5 days on 2% cholesterol diet Teklad TD86295 against control diet Teklad 7001, or fed for 5 days on 1% cholic acid diet Teklad TD00629 against control diet Teklad TD94045. Cholesterol was measured on a Beckman Coulter LX-20 analyzer with reagent 467825; group values were compared by Student's two-tailed unpaired t test. Changes in liver FTF levels were assessed in male Fisher rats (75–100 g, 5 per group) fed for 5 days on 2% cholesterol TD86295 diet versus control M/R7001 diet, and in male Sprague/Dawley rats (300 g, 5 per group, fed on regular Teklad chow TD97350) 5 or 24 h following intraperitoneal injection of 375 μg/kg triiodothyronine (Sigma) or saline vehicle. FTF Transgenic Mice—To assess FTF effect on CYP7A1 expression in vivo, we used a transgenic mouse line expressing FTF under the control of an inducible promoter. This system will be documented in detail elsewhere. Briefly, mFTF cDNA was ligated at its 5′-end with a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope sequence, and the HA-FTF cDNA was cloned in the NruI site of SK+-derived vector MT5′/3′ (30Palmiter R.D. Sandgren E.P. Koeller D.M. Brinster R.L. Mol. Cell.

MMR also promotes apoptosis in cells with severe DNA damage (7Li G.-M. Oncol. Res. 1999; 11: 393-400PubMed Google Scholar). Defects in MMR increase the mutation rate genome-wide and cause hereditary and sporadic cancers, including hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (8Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

Although there is only a single form of MutS or MutL in E. coli, at least two forms of MutS (MutSα and MutSβ) and three forms of MutL homologs (MutLα, MutLβ, and MutLγ) have been found in human cells, and each of them is a heterodimer (37Li G.-M. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: D997-D1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Human MMR activities that play roles similar to E. coli MutH, helicase II, and DNA ligase have not yet been identified. It is clear that the human MMR is more complex than the E. coli reaction, and as a result, it has not yet been reconstituted in vitro. To identify new MMR components, we undertake a fractionation and reconstitution approach and report here the purification and characterization of a novel MMR activity. The novel protein was identified as HMGB1 (the high mobility group box 1 protein), a non-histone chromatin protein that facilitates protein-protein interactions and bends DNA molecules (38Muller S.

Evidence is presented that HMGB1 interacts physically with MutSα and is required at or prior to excision of the mispaired nucleotide during MMR. Fractionation of HeLa S3 Nuclear Extracts—Unless otherwise indicated, fractionation and chromatography were performed at 4 °C. Cell nuclear extracts were prepared from HeLa S3 cells (purchased from the National Cell Culture Center, Minneapolis, MN) as described (13Holmes J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The nuclear extracts were fractionated into two fractions by two-step ammonium sulfate precipitation as described (29Ramilo C. Gu L. Guo S. Zhang X. Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. Li G.-M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 2037-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, the nuclear extracts were first adjusted to 35% ammonium sulfate, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation. The supernatant was removed and adjusted to a final concentration of 65% ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation. The precipitates from both the 35 and 65% cuts, designated FI and FII, respectively, were resuspended in and dialyzed against buffer A (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 0.1 m KCl. FI was adjusted to a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml using buffer B (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 0.5 m NaCl. The diluted sample was loaded onto a single-stranded DNA cellulose column (3 mg of DNA/g of cellulose; Sigma), and the column was washed with buffer B containing 0.5 m NaCl until the flow-through tested negative for protein by Bradford assay (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar). The bound proteins were eluted from the column with buffer B containing 2.0 m NaCl. The flow-through and the bound fractions, designated as SS1 and SS2, respectively, were pooled, concentrated with 35% ammonium sulfate, dialyzed against buffer A containing 0.1 m KCl, and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The protein fractions were aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. Purification of FII-RPA Complementing Activity—HeLa nuclear extracts (300 mg) were adjusted to a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml with buffer A containing 0.05 m KCl. The diluted samples were loaded onto a phosphocellulose P-11 column (Whatman, 4.5 × 5.3 cm2) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.05 mm KCl. The column was washed with 60 ml of equilibration buffer and eluted stepwise with buffer A containing 0.35 m and 0.42 m KCl. The FII-RPA complementing activity, which eluted at 0.42 m KCl, was pooled and desalted through five connected HiTrap desalting columns (Sephadex G-25; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.12 m KCl and 10% glycerol. The complementing fractions (∼50 ml) were loaded onto a 1-ml Amersham Biosciences HR5/5 Mono Q column equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.12 m KCl and 10% glycerol. The column was then developed with a 30-ml linear gradient of KCl (0.12–0.5 m) in buffer A containing 10% glycerol. The FII-RPA complementing activity was eluted at ∼0.38 m KCl. The Mono Q pool was concentrated by spin column (Millipore) and applied onto an Amersham Biosciences Superdex 200 (S200) gel filtration column (24 ml) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.15 m KCl and 10% glycerol. The column was developed with the same buffer, and nearly homogenous complementing activity (∼85 μg) eluted with volumes of 15–16.5 ml. Mismatch Substrates and Repair Assays—DNA heteroduplexes used in this study contained a strand break either 5′ (5′ substrate) or 3′ (3′ substrate) to the mismatch (Fig. 1). The 5′ substrates were derived from f1MR phage series by hybridizing Sau96I-linearized double-stranded DNA of an f1MR phage with ssDNA of another phage as described previously (42Parsons R. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Fang W.H. Papadopoulos N. Jen J. de la Chapelle A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Modrich P. Cell. 1993; 75: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). A G-T mismatched heteroduplex containing a 36-nt gap 5′ to the mismatch was also constructed in a way similar to the construction of the nicked substrate, except that the gap was created by digesting f1MR3 double-stranded DNA with Sau96I and DrdI (Fig. 1, SspI fragment) before annealing with f1MR1 ssDNA. The 3′ G-T substrate was derived from the M13mp18-UKY phage series by hybridizing PstI-linearized double-stranded DNA from M13mp18-UKY1 with ssDNA from M13mp18-UKY2 as described (43Guo S. Presnell S. Yuan F. Zhang Y. Gu L. Li G.-M. J. Biol. Chem. February 9, 2004; 279: 16912-16917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In all cases, the mismatch was replaced in overlapping recognition sites for two restriction endonucleases (Fig. 1), so that the correction of the mismatch can be monitored by these restriction enzymes. Unless otherwise specified, MMR complementation assays were performed in reactions containing a receptor (30 μg of FII and 150 ng of RPA), 2–4-μl individual column fractions, 100 ng (24 fmol) heteroduplex DNA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm ATP, and 0.1 mm dNTPs in the presence or absence of 0.5 μl of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) as described (13Holmes J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, the DNA samples were recovered by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation and digested with restriction enzymes to score repair. The reaction products were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by UV illumination for reactions without [α32P]dCTP or by autoradiography for reactions with [α-32P]dCTP. Repair rate (relative repair) was calculated by dividing the amount of repair products in individual complementation reactions with the amount of repair products in the reaction containing 50 μg of HeLa nuclear extracts, where ∼40% of heteroduplexes (100 ng) are repaired. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—All of the immunoprecipitation steps were performed at 0–4 °C as described (32Gu L. Hong Y. McCulloch S. Watanabe H. Li G.-M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Nuclear extract (400 μg) was incubated with 5 μl of protein A-positive Staphylococcus aureus for 30 min and recovered by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 2 min). The clarified nuclear extract was added to a reaction containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm glutathione, 0.1 m KCl, and 1 μg of double-stranded f1MR3 DNA (homoduplex) or G-T heteroduplex DNA, followed by an overnight incubation with 3 μg of antibodies against HMGB1 (BD Transduction Laboratories), MLH1 (PharMingen) or MSH2 (Oncogene Sciences). After incubation with 15 μl of prewashed protein A-Sepharose (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h, the precipitates were recovered by centrifugation (350 g, 2 min), washed three times with fresh Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm NaVO4), and resuspended in 1.5× SDS loading buffer. The samples were resolved in 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Fisher). The membranes were blotted with antibody against MSH2, MLH1, or HMGB1. Bound antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence using a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). Co-immunoprecipitation-Western blot (IP-Western) was also performed using purified MutSα, MutLα, and the FII-RPA complementing activity. The procedure for these experiments was identical to that of the IP-Western analysis described above using crude nuclear extracts. MutSα and MutLα were purified from HeLa nuclear extracts as described (15Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 19Li G.-M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1950-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Recombinant RPA and HMGB1—The RPA expression vector was kindly provided by Dr. Marc Wold (University of Iowa), and the RPA protein was purified as described (29Ramilo C.

Gene (Amst.). 1998; 225: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 46Bianchi M.E. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 104: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 47McKinney K. Prives C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6797-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The HMGB1 expression vector, a gift from Dr. Carol Prives (Columbia University), was transformed into bacterial strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS for expression. One liter of culture was induced with 0.75 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside when the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6. The cells were induced for 6 h at 28 °C and harvested for protein isolation. The recombinant protein was purified by chromatography using a 5-ml HiTrap chelating nickel column and a Mono Q column. Purified HMGB1 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and detected by silver staining. The recombinant protein was a single major polypeptide with a molecular size of ∼30 kDa by silver staining (see below). Peptide Sequencing—Peptide sequencing was performed at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility using microcapillary reverse-phase HPLC nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry on a Finnigan LCQ DECA quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. The FII-RPA complementing activity was electrophoresed through 12% polyacrylamide in the presence of SDS, and the protein was excised from the gel after staining with Coomassie Blue. The protein was digested by trypsin in situ, tryptic peptides were separated by microcapillary HPLC, and selected fractions were sequenced using mass spectrometry as described (48Chittum H.S. Lane W.S. Carlson B.A. Roller P.P. Lung F.D. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10866-10870Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Purification of a Novel Protein by Complementation of an MMR-deficient HeLa Fraction—A complementation assay for heteroduplex repair was developed to identify novel proteins for MMR in vitro. MMR-deficient HeLa cell fractions were isolated by fractionating HeLa nuclear extract using ammonium sulfate precipitation and ssDNA cellulose column chromatography. This procedure yielded fractions SS1, SS2, and FII, which have been previously characterized (29Ramilo C. Gu L. Guo S. Zhang X. Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. Li G.-M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 2037-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These fractions contain many known MMR components (e.g. SS1 and FII contain MSH2, MLH1, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen), but each fraction alone and each combination of two fractions are deficient in MMR in vitro. SS2 can be substituted by purified recombinant RPA, a human ssDNA-binding protein that protects template DNA and facilitates mismatch excision and DNA resynthesis in human MMR (29Ramilo C. Gu L. Guo S. Zhang X. Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. Li G.-M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 2037-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To identify novel MMR components, column fractions were assayed for their ability to stimulate MMR in the presence of FII and RPA (referred to as FII-RPA). An FII-RPA complementing activity was identified in the eluate from a phosphocellulose column. The activity was purified to near homogeneity using Amersham Biosciences Hi-Trap Desalting (Sephadex G-25), Mono Q, and Superdex 200 (S200) column chromatography (Table I). The peak of activity co-eluted from the S200 column with a single ∼30-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 2A).Table IPurification of FII-RPA complementing activityFractionTotal proteinSpecific activityYieldmgpmol/mg%INuclear extract3000.26100IIPhosphocellulose15.66.8136IIISephadex G-2514.1NDaND, not determined.NDIVMono Q0.364521VSuperdex 2000.08512013a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Fig. 2B shows restoration of MMR to FII-RPA by the 30-kDa protein from the S200 column in repair of a G-T mismatched heteroduplex with a 5′ strand break (5′ G-T; Fig. 1). As expected, little repair was detected when FII-RPA was incubated with the G-T heteroduplex. However, repair activity increased significantly (∼10-fold) when 100 ng or more of the S200 fraction were added to FII-RPA. Similar results were observed with other heteroduplex DNA substrates including base-base mismatches and small insertion/deletion mispairs with a strand break either 5′ or 3′ to the heterology (Table II). These results suggest that the 30-kDa protein in the S200 fraction is required for bi-directional repair of base-base and insertion/deletion mismatches during MMR in vitro.Table IIFII-RPA complementing activity is required for MMR in vitroMismatchRelative repair rate- S200 fraction+ S200 fractionBase-base5′ G-T0.050.553′ G-T0.040.525′ T-T0.030.515′ C-C0.030.58Small insertion/deletion5′ CA0.030.405′ TG<0.020.453′ CTG<0.020.42 Open table in a new tab The FII-RPA Complementing Activity Is HMGB1—The molecular size of the FII-RPA complementing factor does not match previously characterized MMR proteins. Therefore, tryptic peptide sequencing by mass spectrometry was carried out to determine the identity of the 30-kDa protein in the active S200 fraction. Twenty-seven unique tryptic peptides were sequenced as described (48Chittum H.S. Lane W.S. Carlson B.A. Roller P.P. Lung F.D. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10866-10870Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and the peptide sequences were used to search the NCBI nonredundant protein sequence data base using BLAST. This search revealed a perfect match for each of the individual peptides analyzed to the internal regions of the high mobility box group 1 protein (HMGB1) (Table III). Many of the peptides overlapped because of incomplete digestion in arginine and/or lysine-rich protein regions. This result indicates that the FII-RPA complementing activity is probably the HMGB1 protein.Table IIIIdentification of FII-RPA complementing activityPeptideSequenceHMGB1 residues1MSSYAFFVQTCR13-242HPDASVNFSEFSK31-433KHPDASVNFSEFSK30-434KKHPDASVNFSEFSK29-435FEDMAK60-656GKFEDMAK58-657EKGKFEDMAK56-658TYIPPK77-829TYIPPKGETK77-8610TYIPPKGETKK77-8711FKDPNAPK89-9612KFKDPNAPK88-9613RPPSAFFLFCSEYR97-11014RPPSAFFLFCSEYRPK97-11215GEHPGLSIGDVAK115-12716GEHPGLSIGDVAKK115-12817IKGEHPGLSIGDVAK113-12718IKGEHPGLSIGDVAKK113-12819LGEMWNNTAADDK129-14120LGEMWNNTAADDKQPYEK129-14621KLGEMWNNTAADDKQPYEK128-14622LGEMWNNTAADDKQPYEKK129-14723DIAAYR158-16324YEKDIAAYR155-16325EKYEKDIAAYR153-16326GVVKAEK174-18027KGVVKAEK173-180 Open table in a new tab Confirmation of the identity of the FII-RPA complementing activity as HMGB1 was based on several independent lines of evidence. First, the electrophoretic mobility of the FII-RPA complementing activity on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel was similar to that reported for HMGB1 (49Jayaraman L. Moorthy N.C. Murthy K.G. Manley J.L. Bustin M. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Second, an HMGB1 antibody specifically recognized the peak fraction from the S200 column (Fig. 3A, lane 3). Third, the HMGB1-depleted HeLa nuclear extract contained little MMR activity, but the addition of the FII-RPA complementing factor restored MMR to the depleted extract (Fig. 3B), Fourth, the FII-RPA complementing activity was heat-stable, a characteristic of HMGB1 (49Jayaraman L. Moorthy N.C. Murthy K.G. Manley J.L. Bustin M. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3C, although purified hMutSα was capable of restoring MMR to extracts (lane 8) of the hMSH2-deficient NALM-6 cell line (lane 7) (50Gu L. Cline-Brown B. Zhang F. Qiu L. Li G.-M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5758-5764Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the protein heated at 95 °C for 5 min failed to rescue MMR in the NALM-6 extract (lane 9). However, both heated (Fig. 3C, lanes 5 and 6) and unheated (Fig. 3C, lanes 3 and 4) peak fraction from the S200 column restored MMR to FII-RPA at the same level, indicating that heating at 95 °C had no effect on the MMR restoration ability of the S200 fraction. Finally, strong ratification of the identity of the FII-RPA complementing activity as HMGB1 came from testing recombinant human HMGB1 protein (rH-MGB1) purified from bacteria. As shown in Fig. 3D, His-tagged rHMGB1 was capable of complementing the FII-RPA fraction in repair of a G-T substrate. Taken together, we conclude that the FII-RPA complementing factor is HMGB1. HMGB1 Participates in Repair Initiation/Excision—The MMR reaction can be divided into initiation, excision, and resynthesis, and the structure of the DNA substrate changes at each of these stages. Individual MMR components play a specific role in one specific stage of the repair reaction. To explore the specific role of HMGB1 in MMR, the structure of repair intermediates of a G-T heteroduplex containing a 36-nt gap 5′ to the mismatch was analyzed in reactions containing FII-RPA in the presence or absence of HMGB1 using Southern blot analysis (43Guo S. Presnell S. Yuan F. Zhang Y. Gu L. Li G.-M. J. Biol. Chem. February 9, 2004; 279: 16912-16917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 51McCulloch S.D. Gu L. Li G.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The gapped heteroduplex of this kind has been recently shown to be a better substrate for the in vitro MMR (52Iams K. Larson E.D. Drummond J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30805-30814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After incubation of the substrate with the protein mixtures, DNA samples were digested with restriction enzymes SspI and HindIII, and the products were subjected to Southern blot analysis (Fig. 4A). As expected, three major bands, 744, 544, and 414 nt, were detected in a reaction containing an MMR competent HeLa nuclear extract (Fig. 4A, lane 2). The 414-nt band was derived from a homoduplex product that is sensitive to HindIII as a result of the repair of the gapped heteroduplex by the HeLa extract. The 744-nt DNA fragment is an unrepaired ligated DNA substrate, and the 544-nt fragment is an unrepaired unligated DNA substrate; both of these DNA fragments are resistant to HindIII. Similar analysis was carried out in the presence of FII-RPA but lacking HMGB1. A very small amount of 414-nt product was detected in this reaction (Fig. 4A, lane 3). However, ∼50% of the DNA substrate was either unchanged (i.e. 544-nt species) or converted to products slightly faster migrating than 544 nt or migrating between 544 and 414 nt (Fig. 4A, lane 3). The latter species are likely to be unrepaired unligated reaction intermediates that have been partially excised. However, these putative reaction intermediates decreased, and the 414-nt repair product increased when purified HMGB1 (the S200 fraction) was added to the reaction (Fig. 4A, lanes 4–6). Similar analysis was used to examine the role of HMGB1 in 3′ substrate repair. As shown in Fig. 4B, FII-RPA could only convert a limited amount (7%) of heteroduplex to homoduplex (i.e. molecules sensitive to NsiI (lane 2)), but the amount of the NsiI-sensitive species in reactions supplemented with HMGB1 increased to more than 24% (lanes 3 and 4). Given the fact that FII-RPA is capable of conducting MMR-associated DNA resynthesis (29Ramilo C. Gu L. Guo S. Zhang X. Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. Li G.-M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 2037-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and that there was no detectable small (<496 nt) excision intermediates in the reaction containing only FII-RPA (Fig. 4B, lane 2), the deficiency in the reaction is not at the step of DNA synthesis but at or prior to the step of excision. Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that HMGB1 is involved in bi-directional MMR at or prior to the mismatch excision. It is noteworthy that background repair/excision was observed in the reaction containing FII-RPA only (Fig. 4, A, lane 3, and B, lane 2), and this could be due to the presence of a limiting amount of HMGB1 in FII. A quantitative Western blot analysis indeed revealed that FII contains ∼20% of the total HMGB1 in HeLa nuclear extracts (data not shown). HMGB1 Physically Interacts with MutSα—The results presented above suggest that HMGB1 plays a role in initiation/excision of MMR. Human MutS and MutL homologs are also required for this process, raising the possibility that HMGB1 and MutS and/or MutL interact with one another. This idea was tested using IP-Western analysis with HeLa nuclear extracts. Antibody against HMGB1 was incubated with HeLa nuclear extracts in the presence or absence of homoduplex or heteroduplex DNA, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against MSH2 and MLH1. As shown in Fig. 5, MSH2 and MLH1 co-precipitate with the HMGB1 antibody, especially in the presence of heteroduplex (lane 2). HMGB1 was also co-precipitated by anti-MLH1 antibody (data not shown). Unfortunately, the available MSH2 antibody was not suitable for immunoprecipitation. To determine whether HMGB1 interacts with MSH2 or MLH1, or both, IP-Western was carried out using the HMGB1 antibody in the presence of purified proteins HMGB1 and MutSα or HMGB1 and MutLα. The HMGB1 antibody precipitated MSH2 regardless of the presence of DNA substrates (Fig. 5, lanes 4–6) but did not pull down MLH1 (Fig. 5, lanes 7–9). A gel shift analysis revealed that HMGB1 does not bind homoduplex or a G-T heteroduplex DNA under the immunoprecipitation conditions (data not shown), ruling out the possibility that the co-precipitation of HMGB1 and MutSα is due to their independent abilities to interact with a common DNA substrate. These observations suggest that HMGB1 and MutSα specifically interact with each other during in vitro MMR. This interaction appears to be stimulated by heteroduplexes, as judged by the fact that a strong interaction between these two proteins was observed only in the presence of heteroduplex DNA in crude nuclear extracts, although the specificity of the interaction was lost with homogeneous proteins in the presence or absence of heteroduplex DNA (Fig. 5). This study demonstrates that HMGB1 is required to reconstitute MMR in vitro. In this system, HMGB1 is essential for bi-directional repair of both base-base and insertion-deletion mispairs. As a well characterized member of the HMG box protein superfamily, HMGB1 has been shown to play important cellular roles in transcription, cellular signaling, inflammatory response, and tumor metastasis (38Muller S. Scaffidi P. Degryse B. Bonaldi T. Ronfani L. Agresti A. Beltrame M. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4337-4340Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 39Bustin M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 5237-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 53Scaffidi P. Misteli T. Bianchi M.E. Nature. 2002; 418: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (3302) Google Scholar). However, previous studies did not anticipate a role for HMGB1 in MMR. On the other hand, although the searching in human cells for homology to E. coli MMR proteins has largely been successful and has identified human homologs of MutS, MutL, exonuclease I, RPA, and polymerase δ, E. coli MMR does not appear to require a functional equivalent of human HMGB1, indicating that human MMR has higher complexity than E. coli MMR and involves nontraditional MMR components. This observation is consistent with the fact that a substantial fraction of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer kindreds do not appear to be mutants of known human MMR genes (10Lynch H.T. de la Chapelle A. J. Med. Genet. 1999; 36: 801-818PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate that HMGB1 is involved in the in vitro MMR at or prior to the step of excision, as judged by the fact that the addition of HMGB1 to FII-RPA converted species between the 544-nt marker and the 414-nt marker to the repair products (414-nt species) (Fig. 4). However, how HMGB1 facilitates the excision is not clear. It is well known that HMGB1 can bend DNA (40Ohndorf U.M. Rould M.A. He Q. Pabo C.O. Lippard S.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 54Stros M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10355-10361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55Grasser K.D. Teo S.H. Lee K.B. Broadhurst R.W. Rees C. Hardman C.H. Thomas J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), can recognize some unusual DNA structures including cisplatin-modified DNA (56Zamble D.B. Lippard S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 435-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), and promotes protein-protein interactions (38Muller S. Scaffidi P. Degryse B. Bonaldi T. Ronfani L. Agresti A. Beltrame M. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4337-4340Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 39Bustin M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 5237-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). One or all of these properties could be required for MMR. It is also known that the binding of a mismatch by MutS and its homologs is associated with bending of the DNA substrate at the mismatch site (57Obmolova G. Ban C. Hsieh P. Yang W. Nature. 2000; 407: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 58Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is highly likely that the role of HMGB1 in MMR is to enhance heteroduplex bending by MutS homologs so that the DNA substrate is more accessible to attack by helicase(s) and/or nuclease(s). This could explain the requirement for HMGB1 in the repair of both 5′ and 3′ heteroduplexes (Table II). Although direct evidence for HMGB1-induced enhancement of DNA bending is lacking, this possibility is strongly supported by our co-IP experiments, where HMGB1 and MutSα physically interact each other, and the interaction is enhanced in the presence of a heteroduplex DNA (Fig. 5). In addition to co-IP experiments, the interaction between HMGB1 and MutSα is also supported by a possible interaction domain for HMGB1 in MutSα. MSH6, a subunit of MutSα heterodimer, seems to contain a putative HMGB1 interaction domain, based on a recent study by Dintilhac and Bernues (59Dintilhac A. Bernues J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7021-7028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), who showed that HMGB1 interacts with other proteins through many short peptide motifs that have no apparent homology or similarity. For example, the motifs PXXPXP and WXXW (where X can be any amino acid) can interact with box A and box B of HMGB1, respectively. Peptide TLTTPIL is another peptide that is recognized by HMGB1 box A (59Dintilhac A. Bernues J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7021-7028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A similar sequence, TLTTPAL, is present in E. coli MutS (amino acids 189–195), and the equivalent residues in human MSH6 are SKTLRTL (amino acids 631–637). If TXXXL functions as a consensus motif for the binding of HMGB1, MutSα interacts with HMGB1 via the MSH6 subunit. Interaction of MutSα with other proteins, e.g. proliferating cell nuclear antigen (33Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 34Kleczkowska H.E. Marra G. Lettieri T. Jiricny J.

It is also possible that HMGB1 acts as a molecular chaperone to recruit MMR proteins for early steps of MMR because the removal of a mismatch requires a coordinating interaction among MutS homologs, MutL homologs, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, DNA helicase(s), and exonuclease(s). Interestingly, although we did not detect a direct interaction between MLH1 and HMGB1, human PMS1, a heterodimeric partner of MLH1 in MutLβ, contains an HMG box domain (60Fleck O. Kunz C. Rudolph C. Kohli J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30398-30405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, the function of the HMG box domain of PMS1 in MMR remains unclear. Additional experiments are needed to clarify the precise role of HMGB1 in human MMR.

Using a synthetic rolling circle DNA substrate, we demonstrate that a block to the lagging-strand polymerase does not compromise helicase or leading-strand polymerase activity. In fact, lagging-strand synthesis also continues. Thus, the blocked lagging-strand enzyme quickly dissociates from the block site and resumes synthesis on new primed sites. Furthermore, studies in which the lagging polymerase is continuously blocked show that the leading polymerase continues unabated even as it remains attached to the lagging-strand enzyme. Hence, upon encounter of a block to the lagging stand, the polymerases functionally uncouple yet remain physically associated. Further study reveals that naked single-stranded DNA results in disruption of a stalled polymerase from its β-DNA substrate. Thus, as the replisome advances, the single-stranded DNA loop that accumulates on the lagging-strand template releases the stalled lagging-strand polymerase from β after SSB protein is depleted. The lagging-strand polymerase is then free to continue Okazaki fragment production. Replication forks are constantly subjected to events that lead to fork stalling, stopping, or collapse.

Rapid duplication of genomic DNA is performed by a multi-protein complex referred to as the replisome (reviewed in Ref. 1Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992Google Scholar). In the bacterium Escherichia coli, the replisome comprises the DnaB helicase and DNA polymerase III (PolIII) 1The abbreviations used are: PolIII, polymerase III; NTP, nucleoside triphosphate; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; TFII, tailed form II duplex minicircle. 1The abbreviations used are: PolIII, polymerase III; NTP, nucleoside triphosphate; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; TFII, tailed form II duplex minicircle. holoenzyme, which replicates both strands of the parental duplex DNA. The holoenzyme component of the replisome is itself a multiprotein machine organized into distinct subcomplexes (2Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 171-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 3O'Donnell M. Jeruzalmi D. Kuriyan J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R935-R946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The polymerization and editing functions reside in the core subcomplex, comprising the α, ϵ, and θ subunits. The β clamp is a ring-shaped dimeric protein that encircles DNA and binds core, thereby endowing the polymerase with high processivity via topological linkage to the DNA template. The clamp loader complex uses the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to open the clamp and load it onto a primed site.The holoenzyme also contains, as part of the clamp loader complex, two copies of the τ protein. The τ protein, in addition to its role in the clamp loading reaction, also serves as the “organizing center” of the entire replisome (3O'Donnell M. Jeruzalmi D. Kuriyan J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R935-R946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The two τ proteins each bind a core polymerase, thus allowing simultaneous synthesis of the leading and lagging strands by a single holoenzyme particle (4Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19833-19841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

Cell. 1996; 86: 877-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In addition, τ binds the DnaB helicase, coupling the helicase to the polymerase (6Yuzhakov A. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 86: 877-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 7Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 643-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Thus when working in front of a moving polymerase, the normal rate of unwinding, ∼35 bp/s, is markedly increased to ∼1000 bp/s, the speed required for chromosomal replication (7Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 643-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The organization of these proteins at a replication fork is illustrated in the scheme of Fig. 1.Although this machinery seems to be optimized for the task of rapidly copying long stretches of DNA, the life cycle of a cell is filled with events that are potentially catastrophic to the replisome. The DNA template may be damaged or broken, resulting in stalling or collapse of the replisome (reviewed in Refs. 8Kuzminov A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar and 9Cox M.M. Goodman M.F. Kreuzer K.N. Sherratt D.J. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Nature. 2000; 404: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar), and the DNA is always bound by a myriad of proteins, such as repressors or transcription complexes, that could interfere with replication fork progression (10Liu B. Alberts B.M. Science. 1995; 267: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Indeed, Cox et al. (9Cox M.M. Goodman M.F. Kreuzer K.N. Sherratt D.J. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Nature. 2000; 404: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar) have estimated that 10-50% of all replication forks may be subject to collapse in one generation of a single cell. Because cell survival requires duplication of the entire genome, a stalled or collapsed replisome must be reactivated. Replication restart reestablishes a replication fork and allows the cell to complete the task of copying the genome (reviewed in Ref. 11Courcelle J. Hanawalt P.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 611-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).What happens to the replication machinery when it encounters a block is a question that has been addressed from different directions using a variety of methods. Early observations on the pattern of DNA synthesis in vivo after UV irradiation of E. coli revealed that newly synthesized DNA was discontinuous, with the average size of the fragments approximating the distance between UV lesions (12Rupp W.D. Howard-Flanders P. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 31: 291-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). These fragments were shown to be repaired by a RecA-mediated recombinational repair pathway (13Rupp W.D. Wilde 3rd, C.E. Reno D.L. Howard-Flanders P. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 61: 25-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), and subsequent work implicated the involvement of the RecF pathway in this repair process (13Rupp W.D. Wilde 3rd, C.E. Reno D.L. Howard-Flanders P. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 61: 25-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 14Courcelle J. Crowley D.J. Hanawalt P.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 916-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although those experiments were performed in vivo with randomly generated DNA lesions, which precluded assignment of the contribution of leading versus lagging strand lesions to the blocking of the replication fork, the formation of gaps suggested some fraction of DNA lesions are skipped over by the replication machinery.Bypass of replication blocks by the replisome conflicts with several pieces of biochemical evidence from studies addressing strand-specific polymerase inhibition. Studies of the phage T7 replisome demonstrated that shutting down the lagging-strand polymerase by incorporation of a strand-specific dideoxy nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) precursor also halted synthesis by the leading-strand polymerase (15Lee J. Chastain 2nd, P.D. Kusakabe T. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In the T4 system, a similar study reported that the leading-strand polymerase also shuts down when the lagging-strand polymerase is blocked (16Salinas F. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7196-7201Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Another viral system, the eukaryotic herpes simplex virus, has also been reported to show “communication” between the polymerases such that blocking one enzyme also shuts down the other (17Falkenberg M. Lehman I.R. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3896-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Finally, because chromosomal replicases are dimeric to replicate both strands of the parental duplex, “communication” between the twin polymerases is often regarded as a signature feature of genomic replicases (18Benkovic S.J. Valentine A.M. Salinas F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 181-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar).The present study addresses this apparent dilemma using the E. coli replisome as a model for a cellular replicase. A recent in vitro study of strand-specific blocking of the E. coli replication fork on an oriC-containing plasmid showed fork bypass in response to a lagging strand block (19Higuchi K. Katayama T. Iwai S. Hidaka M. Horiuchi T. Maki H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 437-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Here we use a complementary approach to examine the properties of the E. coli replisome in response to a blocked lagging-strand polymerase and to elucidate the mechanism for fork bypass of the lagging strand block. We find that encounter with a lagging strand-specific block, either an abasic lesion or dideoxy NTP incorporation, does not affect progression of the replication fork, a result in contrast to that seen in the phage systems but consistent with the recent E. coli in vitro study (19Higuchi K. Katayama T. Iwai S. Hidaka M. Horiuchi T. Maki H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 437-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Further, we show that when the lagging stand polymerase is blocked, it does not detach from the leading-strand enzyme. Hence, the twin polymerases remain physically coupled, but functionally uncoupled, allowing the replication fork to continue. The blocked lagging-strand polymerase efficiently recycles from the site of the block, allowing Okazaki fragment synthesis to resume as leading strand replication progresses. Finally, we study the mechanism for this recycling of the blocked lagging-strand polymerase. Primase is not directly required for this process, but ssDNA, which would accumulate as the fork continues ahead of the stalled lagging-strand polymerase, is capable of dislodging the stalled polymerase from the β clamp on DNA. SSB-coated ssDNA is much less efficient than naked ssDNA in releasing the stalled polymerase, indicating that depletion of SSB protein may trigger release of the lagging-strand enzyme.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Labeled nucleotides were from PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences; unlabeled nucleotides were from Amersham Biosciences. T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, and restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs. Gel-purified DNA oligonucleotides were from Invitrogen or Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), Inc. The abasic oligonucleotide was synthesized and purified by IDT Inc. Singly primed M13 ssDNA was prepared as described previously (29Stukenberg P.T. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1994; 78: 877-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 30Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). Buffer A is 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm ATP and 8 mm MgCl2. Ligase kinase buffer is 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm ATP, and 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin.Minicircle DNA Preparation—Oligonucleotide substrates for the tailed form II duplex minicircle DNA (TFII DNA), with the sequence shown in Fig. 1A, were constructed in two steps. First, the 100-mer ssDNA circle was prepared by annealing 5′-phosphorylated linear 100-mer with a 20-mer scaffolding oligonucleotide complementary to the 5′ and 3′ 10 bases of the 100-mer. Annealing was performed at concentrations of 70 nm 100-mer and 140 nm 20-mer and was achieved by warming the DNAs to 37 °C in a 50-ml solution of ligase kinase buffer followed by slow cooling to room temperature. 6000 Units of ligase were added, and the reaction was incubated overnight at 16 °C. After ethanol precipitation, circular product was gel purified from a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Ligation efficiencies were typically 50-75%, and final yields of circular product were typically 20-35% with respect to input 100-mer. The second step was construction of the linear 140-mer complementary to the 100-nucleotide circle. This was accomplished by joining two 70-mers. The 5′-phosphorylated 70-mers were annealed by bridging the 5′ and 3′ 10 bases of the two oligonucleotides with a 20-mer scaffold. Annealing was performed at a concentration of 15 μm of each 70-mer and 37.5 μm 20-mer in 450 μl of ligase kinase buffer. Ligation was performed overnight at 16 °C using 4000 units of DNA ligase; after ethanol precipitation, the ligated product was purified from a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel. Ligation efficiencies were typically 30-50%, and final yields were typically 15-30%. To prepare the TFII substrate, a 5:1 molar ratio of 140-mer:100-mer in a solution of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, and 30 mm sodium citrate was heated to 95 °C and slowly cooled to room temperature. The duplex TFII was purified from a 10% native polyacrylamide gel. For the abasic TFII DNA template, the DNA strands have sequences identical to that in Fig. 1A, except that the circle has dT residues in place of dAs; the linear 140-mer template has dA residues in place of dTs. The leading strand abasic residue is located on the circular strand 10 nucleotides upstream of the 3′ terminus of the complementary strand (i.e. the polymerase will encounter the lesion after adding 90 nucleotides). The abasic site on the lagging-strand template is directly opposite the position used to place the lesion on the leading strand.Proteins—Subunits of PolIII holoenzyme (α, ϵ, θ, τ, γ, δ, δ′, χ, ψ, and β) were purified as described previously (20Onrust R.

Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). DnaB, DnaG, and Ssb were purified as described previously (6Yuzhakov A. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 86: 877-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). PolIII core was reconstituted by mixing α, ϵ, and θ subunits and then purifying core from unbound proteins by chromatography on MonoQ, as described previously (22Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some experiments required use of an exonuclease-deficient polymerase (D12A, E14A substitutions in the ϵ protein). This enzyme has been used previously and behaves in a processive fashion like wild-type holoenzyme (25Leu F.P. Georgescu R. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 315-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 26Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3017-3020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). PolIII* (all holoenzyme subunits except β) was reconstituted as follows. A mixture of γ and τ (2.5:1 molar ratio) were incubated for 90 min at 15 °C, followed by addition of δ, δ′, χ, and ψ (3-fold molar excess of each subunit over the τ protein) and incubated a further 60 min. Clamp loader with τ2γ1δδ′χψ composition was resolved from other species as described previously (23Pritchard A.E. Dallmann H.G. Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6536-6545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a 1-ml MonoS column developed with a 0-0.5 m NaCl gradient. To form PolIII*, the τ2γ1δδ′χψ clamp loader was incubated with a 2-fold excess of core (2 core:1 τ ratio) and PolIII* was purified from excess core by MonoQ anion exchange chromatography, as described previously (20Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Naktinis V. Turner J. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13348-13357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For preparation of 3H-labeled PolIII*, the above procedure was repeated except the core was reconstituted using 3H-labeled θ subunit that was labeled by reductive methylation as described previously (24Kelman Z. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Rolling Circle Replication Reactions—DnaB helicase was assembled on the minicircle TFII DNA template by incubating 100 fmol of DNA with 4 pmol of DnaB (as hexamer) in 15 μl of buffer A for 30 s at 37 °C, followed by PolIII* (100 fmol) and β subunit (350 fmol) with 60 μm dGTP and dATP, then incubated for a further 6.5 min. Replication was initiated by adding 1 μg of Ssb, 60 pmol of DnaG, 50 μm concentrations of each of the four riboNTPs and 60 μm concentrations of dTTP and dCTP to a final volume of 25 μl. Leading and lagging-strand synthesis was monitored in separate reactions containing either [α-32P]dTTP (leading) or α [32P]dATP (lagging) to a specific activity of 3000-5000 cpm/pmol. All reactions were quenched upon addition of an equal volume of 1% SDS/40 mm EDTA stop solution. DNA synthesis was quantitated as described previously (4Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19833-19841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by spotting reactions onto DE81 filters and washing with ammonium formate/sodium pyrophosphate solution. Alkaline gel analysis was performed using 0.6% agarose gels developed in 300 mm NaOH/6 mm EDTA for 17-20 h at 30-40 V. Gels were neutralized and fixed in 7% trichloroacetic acid, dried, and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak) for analysis. In reactions that used a DNA oligonucleotide to replace primase, DnaG was omitted and a DNA 15-mer with sequence 5′-GGC GAA ACC AGG GCC-3′ was included at a final concentration of 1 μm. In time course reactions using a strand-specific polymerization block, ddTTP (leading strand block) or ddATP (lagging strand block) was added to a final concentration of 24 μm.Replisome Dilution Assays—Rolling circle replication was initiated as described above, except that no radioactivity was present. At the indicated time after initiation, 2 μl of the reaction was removed and added to 98 μl of buffer A prewarmed to 37 °C containing identical concentrations of all reaction components but lacking TFII DNA, DnaB, and PolIII*. The β-subunit concentration was maintained after dilution, because this protein is used stoichiometrically during replication fork progression. Ssb protein was omitted from the dilution mixture in reactions with primase but was included in the dilution mixture when oligonucleotide was used to prime the lagging strand. Dilution mixtures were also supplemented with [α-32P]dTTP or [α-32P]dATP (10,000-15,000 cpm/pmol). Incubation was continued for 15 min after dilution, or as indicated, and then reactions were quenched as above. Quantitation and gel analysis of reaction products was also as described above. In control reactions that assess the efficacy of dilution, DNA and helicase were mixed at the same concentrations as those used in the normal procedure for 7 min at 37 °C and then diluted 1:50 into prewarmed buffer A containing 60 μm dGTP and dATP. PolIII* was added at the diluted concentration (2 fmol in a 25-μl reaction volume), and reactions were initiated as above.Disruption of PolIII-β-DNA Complex by ssDNA—Stable initiation complexes consisting of PolIII*, β, and primed ssDNA were formed in a 5-min reaction with 100 fmol of PolIII*, 370 fmol of β dimer, 30 fmol of singly primed M13 ssDNA, and 1 μg of Ssb in buffer A with 60 μm dGTP and dCTP as described previously (28Stukenberg P.T. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13384-13391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide DNA (5′-CTG CTC CGG TTG CTG TTG CCC TGG CTG GCT TAG ATT ACT GGT TGC TGT GCC TGC TTT TGC-3′), or other DNA as indicated, was added either 5 s before or 5 s after initiation of DNA synthesis by addition of 60 μm dATP and 20 μm [α-32P]dTTP (specific activity, 10,000-20,000 cpm/pmol). For reactions using SSB-coated DNA, the DNA was preincubated with 5 μg of SSB for 5 min at 37 °C before adding to the stalled polymerase. Reactions proceeded for 20 s and then were quenched as described above. Total DNA synthesis was quantitated by spotting reactions onto DE81 filters as above. RFII formation was quantitated using a Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager after electrophoresis on an 0.8% agarose gel developed in 1xTBE.Gel Filtration Assay for PolIII Stability—Size exclusion chromatography using BioGel A-15 M (Bio-Rad) resin was performed as described previously (28Stukenberg P.T. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13384-13391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Reactions measuring PolIII* stability on singly primed DNA were performed in a 75-μl reaction volume of buffer A. 500 fmol of γ complex was incubated with 1 pmol of gapped duplex DNA along with 2 pmol of β (as dimer) and 10 μg of Ssb protein for 5 min at 37 °C. At this point, 500 fmol of 3H-labeled PolIII* (exonuclease-deficient) was added, along with NaCl, to a final concentration of 100 mm. Reactions were incubated for a further 5 min, at which time 10 μl of solution containing water or 750 pmol (as molecule) ssDNA 60-mer was added. Reactions were incubated for a further 2 min and then applied to a 5-ml column of BioGel A-15 M resin equilibrated in buffer A (lacking ATP) containing 150 mm NaCl. Columns were developed at room temperature and 35 fractions of 180 μl each were collected. Radioactivity in each fraction was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting, and recovery of total radioactivity was typically 85-95%.RESULTSMinicircle-based Analysis of the E. coli Replisome—The initial experiments for this study are based on the minicircle DNA template depicted in Fig. 1A, which consists of a 100-mer circular duplex DNA with a 5′ ssDNA tail on one strand. Each strand is composed of only three of the four dNTPs; therefore, synthesis can be individually monitored on each strand by following incorporation of either [α-32P]dATP or [α-32P]TTP. Fig. 1, B and C, illustrates that the replisome functions on the minicircle substrate to produce concurrent leading and lagging-strand synthesis. Fig 1B shows a time course of product accumulation as well as an alkaline gel analysis of the products of rolling circle replication. Leading strand replication products, represented by [32P]dTTP incorporation, are high molecular weight species that migrate near the position of the gel wells. Lagging strand products, represented by [32P]dATP incorporation, run as a broad smear, reflecting the discontinuous mechanism of Okazaki fragment synthesis. Experiments to address the protein requirements of leading and lagging-strand synthesis show that as expected, both leading and lagging strand replication require holoenzyme and helicase (data not shown). Primase and Ssb protein are not required for the leading strand, but lagging strand replication requires these proteins. No Okazaki fragments are produced when primase is omitted, and lack of SSB results in abnormally short (<500 bp) Okazaki fragments (data not shown).Fig. 1C shows a dilution experiment, which confirms that the replication forks in this system are produced by a single holoenzyme that synthesizes both leading and lagging strands. The replisome is assembled on the minicircle DNA; after synthesis is initiated, an aliquot of the reaction is diluted 1:50 into a mixture identical to the original reaction except lacking the TFII DNA substrate, PolIII*, helicase, and SSB. Radiolabeled nucleotide is present only in the post-dilution mixture; therefore, only replisomes that survive dilution will provide a product. Control reactions in which helicase-loaded DNA templates are reacted with PolIII* under dilute concentrations show no product accumulation (t = 0 lanes). Reactions diluted after initiation (t+2′ lanes) however, show a product distribution identical to that of the undiluted control reactions, as expected for a replication fork with physically coupled leading and lagging-strand polymerases. The resistance of the replisome to dilution, the similar rates of leading and lagging strand incorporation, and the strand-specific protein requirements together indicate that the minicircle DNA substrate used here is fully competent in supporting replication fork progression by a single holoenzyme that synthesizes both strands in concert with helicase movement.With the minicircle replication fork system described above, the fate of the replication fork fate after halting either the leading- or lagging-strand polymerase can be addressed. Studies in various phage replication systems have shown that encounter of a replication block by either the leading- or lagging-strand polymerase results in the inactivation of the other polymerase, even though it is not blocked (15Lee J. Chastain 2nd, P.D. Kusakabe T. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 16Salinas F. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl.

A. 2000; 97: 3896-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have performed similar experiments, and several others, to determine whether the E. coli replisome exhibits the same behavior. First, we took advantage of the synthetic nature of this system to place an abasic lesion on the lagging-strand template as a block to the lagging-strand enzyme. After this, we made use of the fact that the lagging strand can be blocked specifically by inclusion of ddATP in the reaction.Holoenzyme Response to an Abasic Site on the Lagging Strand—To examine whether the E. coli replication fork is halted upon encounter of the lagging-strand polymerase with an abasic site, we constructed a minicircle substrate with a single abasic site located on the lagging-strand template. Replication reactions were performed as described above, and synthesis of the leading and lagging strands were followed in individual reactions using strand-specific radiolabels. If the lagging-strand enzyme is blocked by the lesion and communicates with the leading-strand enzyme, one may expect the leading-strand enzyme to halt synthesis. However, the result in Fig. 2A shows that leading-strand synthesis is unaltered relative to a control reaction using an undamaged minicircle substrate.Fig. 2A lagging strand abasic lesion does not stop the replisome. The diagram at the top left illustrates the replisome with the lagging-strand polymerase blocked at an abasic site lesion on the lagging-strand template. The diagram at the top right illustrates the results in which the abasic site is bypassed. A, leading-strand synthesis is monitored using [32P]dATP on a minicircle that either contains an abasic site on the lagging strand (circles) or lacks an abasic site (squares). B, lagging-strand synthesis is monitored using [32P]dTTP on substrate that either contains an abasic site (circles) or lacks an abasic site (squares). In both A and B, DNA synthesis on a template containing the same abasic site at the identical position on the leading strand is shown (triangles), to confirm the efficacy of the abasic lesion as a polymerase block.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We were surprised to find that, overall, lagging-strand synthesis was not significantly affected even when the lagging-strand template contains the abasic blocking lesion (Fig. 2B). The efficacy of the abasic site block is demonstrated in control reactions using a template with the abasic site placed at an identical position on the leading-strand template. As shown by the dashed lines of Fig. 2, A and B, the minicircle template with the lesion on the leading strand supports no DNA synthesis by either the leading- or lagging-strand polymerase over the time frame of the reaction.How is the stalled lagging-strand polymerase freed from a block site, allowing it to continue Okazaki fragment synthesis? The mechanism by which this occurs will be examined in detail later in this report. First, we wished to determine whether the leading-strand polymerase remains active when the lagging-strand enzyme is permanently blocked.Holoenzyme Response to a Lagging-strand Block—To address the effect of blocking a"
https://openalex.org/W2117499182,"The enzymatic hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond is central to numerous biological processes. Glycoside hydrolases, which catalyze these reactions, are grouped into families based on primary sequence similarities. One of the largest glycoside hydrolase families is glycoside hydrolase family 5 (GH5), which contains primarily endo-acting enzymes that hydrolyze beta-mannans and beta-glucans. Here we report the cloning, characterization, and three-dimensional structure of the Cellvibrio mixtus GH5 beta-mannosidase (CmMan5A). This enzyme releases mannose from the nonreducing end of mannooligosaccharides and polysaccharides, an activity not previously observed in this enzyme family. CmMan5A contains a single glycone (-1) and two aglycone (+1 and +2) sugar-binding subsites. The -1 subsite displays absolute specificity for mannose, whereas the +1 subsite does not accommodate galactosyl side chains but will bind weakly to glucose. The +2 subsite is able to bind to decorated mannose residues. CmMan5A displays similar activity against crystalline and amorphous mannans, a property rarely attributed to glycoside hydrolases. The 1.5 A crystal structure reveals that CmMan5A adopts a (beta/alpha)(8) barrel fold, and superimposition with GH5 endo-mannanases shows that dramatic differences in the length of three loops modify the active center accessibility and thus modulate the specificity from endo to exo. The most striking and significant difference is the extended loop between strand beta8 and helix alpha8 comprising residues 378-412. This insertion forms a ""double"" steric barrier, formed by two short beta-strands that function to ""block"" the substrate binding cleft at the edge of the -1 subsite forming the ""exo"" active center topology of CmMan5A."
https://openalex.org/W1989846327,"Glycogen synthase is post-translationally modified by both phosphate and O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes exposed to high concentrations of glucose, O-GlcNAc contributes to insulin resistance of glycogen synthase. We sought to determine whether O-GlcNAc also regulates glycogen synthase in vivo. Glycogen synthase activity in fat pad extracts was inhibited in streptozotocin (STZ)-treated diabetic mice. The half-maximal activation concentration for glucose 6-phosphate (A(0.5)) was increased to 830 +/- 120 microm compared with 240 +/- 20 microm in control mice (C, p < 0.01), while the basal glycogen synthase activity (%I-form) was decreased to 2.4 +/- 1.4% compared with 10.1 +/- 1.8% in controls (p < 0.01). Glycogen synthase activity remained inhibited after compensatory insulin treatment. After insulin treatment kinetic parameters of glycogen synthase were more closely correlated with blood glucose (A(0.5), r(2) = 0.70; %I-form, r(2) = 0.59) than insulin levels (A(0.5), r(2) = 0.04; %I-form, r(2) = 0.09). Hyperglycemia also resulted in an increase in the level of O-GlcNAc on glycogen synthase (16.1 +/- 1.8 compared with 7.0 +/- 0.9 arbitrary intensity units for controls, p < 0.01), even though the level of phosphorylation was identical in diabetic and control mice either with (STZ: 2.9 +/- 1.0 and C: 3.2 +/- 0.8) or without (STZ: 12.2 +/- 2.8 and C: 13.8 +/- 3.0 arbitrary intensity units) insulin treatment. In all mice the percent activation of glycogen synthase that could be achieved in vitro by recombinant protein phosphatase 1 (230 +/- 30%) was significantly greater in the presence of beta-d-N-acetylglucosaminidase (410 +/- 60%, p < 0.01). This synergistic stimulation of glycogen synthase due to codigestion by protein phosphatase 1 and beta-d-N-acetylglucosaminidase was more pronounced in STZ-diabetic mice (310 +/- 70%) compared with control mice (100 +/- 10%, p < 0.05). The findings demonstrate that O-GlcNAc has a role in the regulation of glycogen synthase both in normoglycemia and diabetes."

The hallmark of retroviral replication is the copying of a dimeric RNA genome into double-stranded DNA by reverse transcriptase prior to integration in the host cell genome (reviewed in Ref. 1Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1997: 121-160Google Scholar). The dimeric genome of the retrovirus allows reverse transcriptase to switch between the two templates during replication, resulting in a strong recombination potential and fast evolution of drug-resistance (reviewed in Ref. 2Temin H.M.

Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 48: 29-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TAR hairpin that is the focus of this report is recognized at the three-nucleotide bulge region by the viral Tat protein (4Dingwall C. Ernberg I. Gait M.J. Green S.M. Heaphy S. Karn J. Lowe A.D.

The binding of Tat to TAR facilitates binding of cyclin T1 and cyclin-dependent protein kinase-9 to the distal loop of TAR, which concurrently induces transcriptional elongation by hyperphosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase II (reviewed in Ref. 6Karn J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 235-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). It is believed that dimerization of the RNA genomes is initiated through intermolecular base-pairing between the palindromic loop sequences of two DIS hairpins, forming a kissing-loop complex or loose dimer (7Skripkin E. Paillart J.C. Marquet R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4945-4949Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). This complex can, under appropriate conditions, be converted into a more stable tight dimer by extended base-pairing (7Skripkin E. Paillart J.C. Marquet R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4945-4949Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), a process that is potentiated by the addition of the nucleocapsid (NC) (8Muriaux D. De Rocquigny H. Roques B.P.

Rein A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4251-4256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the subsequent reverse transcription step of the viral replication cycle, the dimeric genome provides a template for the reverse transcriptase that utilizes a tRNALys3 primer annealed to the primer binding site sequence (reviewed in Ref. 1Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1997: 121-160Google Scholar). The cDNA synthesis proceeds until it reaches the 5′ end of the genome, which forms the so-called minus-strand strong-stop DNA. The presence of a repeated R-region in both ends of the genome enables the extending polymerase to switch templates to the 3′ terminal R-region (10Gilboa E. Mitra S.W. Goff S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1979; 18: 93-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Because of the diploidity of the RNA genome, this transfer may occur either as an intramolecular or as an intermolecular event (11van Wamel J.L. Berkhout B. Virology. 1998; 244: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the TAR structure at the 5′ end of the genome plays an important role in template switching, although the molecular explanation for this observation remains unclear. It has been suggested that the minus-strand strong-stop DNA, complementary to the TAR stem loop, can form a kissing-loop interaction with the TAR RNA in the 3′ end of the genome and that this interaction facilitates the first-strand transfer (12Jeeninga R.E. Huthoff H.T. Gultyaev A.P. Berkhout B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5472-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Berkhout B. Vastenhouw N.L. Klasens B.I. Huthoff H. RNA. 2001; 7: 1097-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). By using a combination of bioinformatics, biochemistry, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques, we show that a phylogenetically conserved palindrome in the TAR RNA forms stable dimers independently of the DIS sequence when exposed to the NC protein. The interaction between two TAR hairpins, which we characterize here, provides a molecular explanation for the observed role of TAR in packaging and reverse transcription of the viral RNA. Phylogenetic Analysis—The search for evolutionary conserved RNA palindromes in the HIV-1 leader sequence was done using a modified version of the RNA secondary structure prediction algorithm, Pfold (14Knudsen B. Hein J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3423-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). This program uses a statistical method to find RNA structures given a multiple alignment of related RNA sequences and their evolutionary history. The initial analysis was done using an alignment of 20 divergent leader sequences (15Damgaard C.K. Andersen E.S. Knudsen B. Gorodkin J. Kjems J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 307-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The bioinformatic analysis of the structural model shown in Fig. 1C was based on 300 unique and unambiguous TAR sequences from the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database (available on the World Wide Web at hiv-web.lanl.gov/). Plasmids—The parental construct used in this study was generated by PCR amplification of the first 744 nucleotides of the full-length clone of HIV-1 HXB2 (GenBank™ accession no. K03455) and cloned into pUC18 with a T7 promotor. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce mutations in the TAR and DIS palindromes. The various HIV-1 subtype and HIV-2 constructs have been described previously (16Andersen E.S. Jeeninga R.E. Damgaard C.K. Berkhout B. Kjems J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3020-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 17Damgaard C.K. Dyhr-Mikkelsen H. Kjems J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). pHIV-1-C2-TAR that was used for footprinting was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the subtype C2 construct. An extra G was inserted at position-1 and GGG after position 58 to generate an SmaI restriction site. pYES2-His was generated by inserting a HindIII-XbaI-digested fragment (AGCTTACCATGGCTCATCATCACCATCACCATGGATCCCCGGGAATTCCTTGAT, coding strand) into a HindIII-XbaI-digested pYES2 vector (Invitrogen), generating a sequence encoding a 6× His-tag upstream of a BamHI-SmaI-EcoRI multiple cloning site. pYES2-His-Gag was generated by inserting a BamHI-EcoRI restriction fragment of pET-GTH-Gag (18Jensen T.H. Jensen A. Kjems J. Gene. 1995; 162: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) into a BamHI-EcoRI-digested pYES2-His plasmid. RNA Preparation—The constructs were linearized with HindIII to obtain templates for transcription of the TAR sequences (nucleotides 1-81). The HIV-1 C2 TAR used for footprinting was transcribed from pHIV-1-C2-TAR linearized with SmaI, which generated a blunt-ended TAR stem with an extra G·C base pair at the proximal end. The HIV-2 TAR transcript (nucleotides 1-140) was transcribed from pHIV-2 linearized with MseI. To obtain templates for transcription of the entire leader and 409 nucleotides of the Gag open reading frame (nucleotides 1-744), the constructs were linearized with BamHI. Large scale RNA transcription was performed by using 2 μg of linearized plasmid in 20 μl reactions with 80 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 7.5 mm rNTP, 10 units/ml yeast inorganic PPase, 20 units ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega), and 2 units T7 polymerase incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The samples were treated with DNaseI for 15 min prior to purification on 4% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The RNA was either internally or 5′ end-labeled according to Kjems et al. (19Kjems J. Egebjerg J. Christiansen J. van der Vliet P.C. Analysis of RNA-protein Complexes in Vitro. Elsevier Science B. V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands1998: 26Google Scholar). Protein Preparation—Synthetic NCp7 (71 amino acids) from the HXB2 strain was a generous gift from Jean-Luc Darlix. His-tagged Gag protein was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (JEL1) transformed with pYES2-His-Gag growing in YEPR medium (20 g/liter peptone (Difco), 10 g/liter yeast extract, 20 g/liter raffinose (Sigma)). Cells were grown to an A600 = 6, supplemented with 2% galactose (Sigma) and grown for an additional 16 h. Pelleted cells were frozen as pills in liquid nitrogen and ruptured in a bead beater (20 × 15 s) and extracted in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole. After centrifugation and filtration through a 45 μm cellulose acetate filter, the extract was incubated with 0.5 ml of nickel-NTA agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed three times in 4 ml of extraction buffer containing 20 mm imidazole and eluted in 4 × 0.5 ml extraction buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The eluate was dialysed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol before use. RNA Treatment—The NC treatment and removal were basically done as described by Muriaux et al. (8Muriaux D. De Rocquigny H. Roques B.P. Paoletti J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33686-33692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A volume of 10 μl of 200 nm RNA was denatured at 85 °C for 5 min and snap-cooled on ice for 5 min. Identical results were obtained for slowly renatured RNA (data not shown). RNA transcripts were incubated in NC buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.2 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C for 15 min with 5 μm NCp7 or Gag, corresponding to ∼100% coating of 100 nm RNA (20You J.C. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31491-31495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation, the reactions were placed on ice for 2 min, then at 25 °C for 2 min. SDS was added to 0.2% and left at room temperature for 5 min. For gel migration assays, the NC protein was removed by phenol extraction, with two steps of phenol with 0.1% SDS, one step of phenol/chloroform, and a last step of chloroform. NC samples for AFM analysis were diluted to 1 ng/μl and highly purified by phenol extraction, with three steps of phenol with 0.1% SDS, two steps of phenol/chloroform, and a last step of chloroform. Gel electrophoresis was conducted at 5W for 3 h at room temperature in 6 or 3.5% native polyacrylamide gels containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 90 mm borate, and 1 mm EDTA. Enzymatic Probing—The RNA used for enzymatic probing was treated as described above, but with 500 nm C2 SmaI RNA and 4.1 μm NC protein. Enzymatic probing experiments were done according to Kjems et al. (19Kjems J. Egebjerg J. Christiansen J. van der Vliet P.C. Analysis of RNA-protein Complexes in Vitro. Elsevier Science B. V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands1998: 26Google Scholar) using 5 ng of 5′ end-labeled RNA in 10-μl reactions with 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.17 units/μl RNasin (Promega), and 5 μg of rRNA as competitor. The mixture was incubated on ice with 1 μl of H2O (negative control), RNase T1 (1-10 units/ml), RNase T2 (2-10 units/ml) or RNase V1 (10-50 units/ml). RNase T1 cleaves 3′ to guanosines (Gp↓) in single-stranded RNA. RNase T2 cleaves preferentially 3′ to adenosines (Ap↓) in single-stranded RNA. RNase V1 cleaves non-specifically 5′ to phosphates (N↓p) in double-stranded RNA. The RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and ethanol-precipitated. Alkaline hydrolysis ladder was prepared by incubating end-labeled RNA in alkaline hydrolysis buffer (100 mm NaHCO3/Na2CO3, pH 9.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 μg/μl tRNA) at 96 °C for 5-10 min. AFM—The samples were prepared on freshly cleaved mica surfaces that were immersed in a 0.06 mg/ml spermine (free base, Aldrich) solution for 10 min, rinsed in RNase-free water, and dried under a N2-stream. This procedure resulted in a spermine layer of 4 Å in thickness and a root-mean-square roughness of about 0.2 nm. 1 μl of RNA solution (1 ng/μl) was deposited onto the spermine-mica. After 1 min, the sample was rinsed in RNase-free water and then gently dried under N2. AFM imaging was done with a Molecular Imaging PicoScan AFM operated in “MAC” mode (magnetically oscillated) under ambient conditions. We used cobalt back-coated silicon cantilevers with spring constants of 0.5-1 N·m. The size of the RNA molecules was determined after calibration of the scanner with gratings obtained from MikroMasch; vertical dimensions were determined with a TGZ01 grating set, and lateral dimensions were determined with a TGX01. Because some of the loops are slightly distorted, we calculate the loop diameter as (½ × (a2 + b2))½, where a and b are the minor and major axes of the ellipse. The results were obtained from averaging 25 dimer loops. TAR Contains a Phylogenetically Conserved Palindrome—To identify potential dimerization sites, we searched for evolutionary conserved palindromes (self-complementary sequences) in an alignment of 20 divergent HIV-1 leader sequences using a bioinformatics approach (14Knudsen B. Hein J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3423-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 15Damgaard C.K. Andersen E.S. Knudsen B. Gorodkin J. Kjems J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 307-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This algorithm predicted the presence of three significant palindromes, two of which are strongly supported by sequence variations among divergent HIV-1 strains (Fig. 1A). In addition to the previously characterized DIS palindrome (7Skripkin E. Paillart J.C. Marquet R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4945-4949Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), we found that a 10-nucleotide sequence in the distal part of the TAR hairpin can potentially base-pair with another TAR hairpin through eight Watson-Crick base pairs and two G·U wobble base pairs (Fig. 1B, red stem). This sequence is conserved in 78% of 300 different TAR sequences from the HIV-1 database, reflecting in part the requirement of proper Tat function. Interestingly, 18% of the HIV-1 sequences contain substitutions conserving the intermolecular base-pairing potential if C·A base pairs are included (Fig. 1C). The C·A base pair has been demonstrated in other RNA structures and has unique symmetrical properties (21Kolb F.A. Engdahl H.M. Slagter-Jager J.G. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Westhof E. Wagner E.G. Romby P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5905-5915Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 22Masquida B. Westhof E. RNA. 2000; 6: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The TAR intermolecular stem can be extended eight base pairs further by allowing one mismatch on each side (Fig. 1B, blue sequences). This extension is also supported by phylogenetic evidence with a high frequency of C·A base pairs (Fig. 1C, blue stem). These observations suggest that there is a strong phylogenetic pressure to conserve the intermolecular base-pairing potential between two TAR structures. TAR Dimerization Is Mediated by the Palindrome and the NC Protein—We investigated the dimerization capacity of wild-type and mutant TAR hairpins in a gel retardation assay (Fig. 2, A and B). The TAR RNA with the central wild-type (WT) palindrome (GAGCUC38) does not spontaneously form dimers, but upon transient incubation with NC protein from HIV-1 HXB2, it forms two dimer species with an efficiency of ∼50% (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). Because the NC protein is a proteolytic product of the Gag polyprotein, we tested the ability of purified Gag from HIV-1 HXB2 to induce dimerization, but found no activity in the TAR dimerization assay (result not shown). Next we tested the importance of the palindromic sequence in the TAR RNA. Mutating A34→U in the palindrome (Fig. 2A, TAR1, GUGCUC38) eliminates dimerization, whereas restoring the palindromic nature of the sequence by an additional mutation, U37→A (Fig. 2A, TAR2, GUGCUC38), allows dimers to form (Fig. 2B, lane 3 and 4). The increased dimerization capacity of the TAR2 restoration mutant compared with WT TAR is most likely due to the concomitant destabilization of the TAR stem and exposure of the palindrome. This interpretation is consistent with the observation that a triple mutant (Fig. 2A, TAR3), where an additional mutation of A26→U in TAR2 restores the stem, dimerizes with an efficiency comparable with WT TAR (Fig. 2B, lane 5). The importance of the whole TAR composition is further evidenced by the observation that the deletion of the bulged A16 (TAR4) completely eliminates dimer formation (Fig. 2B, lane 6). This deletion enables the formation of a 16-base-pair uninterrupted stem that probably renders the TAR helix too stable for NC to unwind and expose the palindrome. We suggest that the chaperone activity of the NC protein is required to expose the partially hidden palindrome within the TAR stem. Evidence for a Two-step Progression of TAR Dimerization— The TAR dimer forms two structurally distinct complexes in the gel retardation assay, which most likely represent an intermediate kissing-loop (KL) complex and an extended duplex (ED) structure (Fig. 2B, lower and upper dimer bands, respectively; see model in Fig. 1B). This assignment is based on the observation that the TAR3 mutant that destabilizes the extended base-pairing (Fig. 1B, blue stem) also inhibits the formation of the ED (Fig. 2B, lane 5). The RNA sequences, which are liberated upon ED formation, may potentially form a secondary parallel duplex within the ED dimer, thus further increasing the stability of the dimeric TAR complex (Fig. 1B, green stem). This interaction is also consistent with nucleotide substitutions in divergent HIV-1 strains (Fig. 1C, green stem). Hence, our data are compatible with the model that the progression from an initial KL to an ED structure involves the formation of two parallel duplexes with two three-way junctions. The observation of trimer and tetramer, but no higher order TAR complexes, raises the possibility that the exposed sequences marked with green in Fig. 1B alternatively can interact with other TAR molecules or dimers (Fig. 2B, lane 2). To confirm the phylogenetic conservation of the TAR dimer experimentally, we performed the dimerization assay using a set of five TAR RNAs from divergent HIV-1 subtypes and one from HIV-2 (Fig. 2, C and D). All subtypes tested can form TAR dimers, albeit with variable efficiencies (> 20%). Notably, TAR from subtype C1, C2, and AE forms dimers with 60-80% efficiency (Fig. 2D), which for the AE strain may reflect the substitution of two G·U base pairs for two G·C pairs in the dimer, and for the C1 and C2 strains, a destabilization of the TAR stem (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, when comparing C1 and C2, a single substitution in the distal loop of TAR (U30→C) alters the ratio between the ED and KL forms, suggesting that this nucleotide plays an important role in the progression of KL into the ED form. Moreover, comparing the two subtype B strains (HXB2 and LAI), we reproducibly saw a lower yield of ED formation for LAI, which may be explained by the unique C23→ U substitution in the green stem characteristic for the ED form (compare Fig. 2B, lane 2 to Fig. 2D, lane 2). HIV-2 also forms dimers in the presence of HIV-1 NC (Fig. 2D, lanes 7 and 8), consistent with the fact that this virus also contains a conserved RNA palindrome in the TAR hairpin. 2E. S. Andersen, unpublished observation. After having established that the TAR hairpin alone can form dimers, we investigated the role of TAR in dimerization of a more extended region spanning the 5′ part of the HIV-1 genome (nucleotides 1-744). Incubation of this RNA with the NC protein induces the formation of higher order RNA-protein complex unable to enter the gel (Fig. 2E, lane 1). When incubating the HIV-1 RNA in buffer without NC, dimerization occurs inefficiently in a DIS-dependent manner (Fig. 2E, lane 2 and 3). Incubation of the WT RNA with NC followed by phenol extraction leads to an increased amount of dimer (Fig. 2E, lane 4). Disrupting the TAR palindrome in the TAR1 mutant does not alter the dimerization efficiency probably because the dimerization can occur via the DIS palindrome. The TAR2 mutant RNA forms mostly multimers, suggesting that the increased TAR dimerization capacity of this mutant may favor TAR and DIS dimerization between different HIV-1 RNA molecules (Fig. 2E, lane 6). The TAR3 mutant dimerizes to a similar extent as wild-type (Fig. 2E, lane 7). Analyzing all of the TAR mutants in the absence of a functional DIS palindrome yielded a dimerization pattern that is very similar to what was observed for the TAR hairpin alone, except that the overall dimerization level was clearly reduced (Fig. 2E, lanes 8-11). This shows that, although the DIS constitutes the major dimerization site, the extended HIV-1 RNA can dimerize in the absence of DIS and that this dimerization is clearly dependent upon the integrity of the TAR palindrome. Moreover, the absence of any detectable dimer species in the mutant lacking both functional TAR and DIS palindromes (Fig. 2E, lane 9) implies that no other dimerization signals are present in the leader. Probing the TAR-TAR Interaction—We next used enzymatic probing to investigate the structures of monomeric and dimeric TAR RNAs from HIV-1 subtypes B-HXB2 (data not shown) and C2 (Fig. 3). The ladder subtype forms dimers very efficiently under the probing conditions (Fig. 3A) and, therefore, allows a better distinction between the two forms. A comparison of the probing results from the WT TAR hairpin with and without NC-treatment reveals a dramatic structural reorganization of the distal loop upon dimerization. A significant increase in double-strand specific RNase V1 cleavage at positions U30↓G31↓G32↓ accompanied with a clear reduction of single-strand specific T1 and T2 RNase cleavages at G31↓G32↓G33↓ and U30↓G31↓G32↓G33↓, respectively, clearly supports the role of the palindrome in intermolecular annealing (Fig. 3B; lanes 3-5 and 7-9, summarized in Fig. 3C). Another significant structural change occurs in the bulged region. The T2 RNase cleavages at C23↓ and U24↓ within the bulge were strongly reduced upon dimer formation as one would expect from the model (Fig. 3B, lanes 4 and 8). Accordingly, G25 and G27, which are base-paired in the monomer stem, become moderately accessible to single-strand specific RNase T1 in the dimer (Fig. 3B, compare lane 3 and 7). However, the observed induction of T1 RNase cleavage at 27G↓ was completely absent when probing subtype B. Therefore, we favor a model in which G42-U45 is base-paired to A26-C29 (Fig. 3C, blue stem in the dimer), although it is possible that C44-U45 alternatively can bind A14-G15. We conclude that the probing data on the monomer and dimer TAR RNA is compatible with the structural model shown in Fig. 1B. Direct Visualization of Intermolecular Linkages in HIV-1 Dimerization—AFM has previously been used to study the association of proteins with double-stranded RNA (23Henn A. Medalia O. Shi S.P.

Virol. 2001; 82: 1503-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To image the dimer linkage region of HIV-1 RNA at the single-molecule level, we applied AFM to the RNA spanning nucleotides 1-744 of the HIV-1 genome. RNA constructs, containing wild-type or mutated TAR palindromes, were transiently incubated with or without NC protein and deposited on a spermine-treated mica surface. The AFM images of the NC-treated WT RNA exhibited distinct circular structures with a diameter of 65 ± 15 nm that were assigned as RNA dimers based on length measurements (Fig. 4, A and B). Notably, AFM imaging of either RNA that contains the disruptive TAR1 mutation in the palindrome or RNA that is incubated without NC protein revealed no circular structures (Fig. 4, C and D). RNA with mutations in the DIS palindrome always yielded AFM images in which the RNA appeared partially aggregated without sign of circular structures (data not shown). This shows that the TAR palindrome and the NC-incubation is important for formation of the circular structure, and the most likely interpretation of this result is that the circular structure is formed through intermolecular linkages involving the TAR and the DIS palindromes (Fig. 4E). TAR is known to be a multifunctional region involved in transcriptional activation, packaging, and reverse transcription of the HIV-1 genome (3Berkhout B. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 48: 29-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we show that, in addition, the TAR hairpin harbors a dimerization signal that is induced by the NC protein. Based on the appearance of two dimeric TAR complexes with different mobility in a native gel, we propose a model implying that dimerization occurs in two steps. Our phylogenetic study, mutational analysis, and enzymatic probing data suggest that the initial KL interaction involves 10 base pairs. In a second step, this interaction was extended by four base pairs on either side, followed by the formation of a second parallel helix, which resulted in two three-way helical junctions. In this two-step process, 20 base pairs were broken and 28 new ones were formed, making the reaction thermodynamically favorable. The required chaperone activity of the NC protein may reflect that the TAR palindrome is situated partly in a helical region and not readily available for initial intermolecular base-pairing. The two-step dimerization reaction resembles the dimerization of the DIS stem-loop that also proceeds from an initial loose dimer that involves kissing of the distal loops into an extended dimer where the DIS stem dissociates and becomes engaged in intermolecular base-pairing (7Skripkin E. Paillart J.C. Marquet R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4945-4949Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The TAR dimerization model also bares some resemblance to the suggested structure of the CopA·CopT complex, which is functional in bacterial plasmid-replication control where a loop-loop interaction progresses to form a four-way helical junction (21Kolb F.A. Engdahl H.M. Slagter-Jager J.G. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Westhof E. Wagner E.G. Romby P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5905-5915Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the non-canonical A·C base pair, which is observed with high frequency in the TAR dimer complex, is also found in the CopA·CopT and other related complexes (28Kolb F.A. Westhof E. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Wagner E.G. Romby P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and might provide special symmetrical properties in the topology of these characteristic knot-structures. The TAR dimerization efficiency of the different HIV-1 subtypes varies between 20-80%. Differences in the dimerization efficiency have also been observed for the DIS hairpin when analyzing different subtypes (16Andersen E.S. Jeeninga R.E. Damgaard C.K. Berkhout B. Kjems J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3020-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The HIV-1 subtypes may thus adjust the dimerization capability of individual sites to obtain a certain over-all stability of the dimeric genome in a cooperative manner. The AFM analysis indicated that the TAR-TAR interaction, together with the dimer linkage site in the DIS region, is responsible for the formation of ∼65 nm circular dimeric structures. Because the length of the RNA strand between the TAR and DIS palindromes is 216 nucleotides, we estimate the length per nucleotide to be 0.47 ± 0.11 nm within the RNA circle. This value is in agreement with previous x-ray and AFM studies of single-stranded homopolymer RNA (29Saenger W. Cantor C.R. Principles of Nucleic Acid Structures. Springer, New York1984: 298-330Google Scholar, 30Hansma H.G. Revenko I. Kim K. Laney D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and is smaller than the length of a fully extended nucleotide backbone (0.6 nm/nucleotide). Therefore, a significant proportion of the RNA spanning the loop region must be single-stranded. The circles observed by AFM resemble the structures visualized by electron microscopy in RNA isolated from virus particles by Höglund et al. (31Höglund S. Ohagen A. Goncalves J. Panganiban A.T. Gabuzda D. Virology. 1997; 233: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). They speculated that the 5′ end interaction involves the palindrome crowning the poly(A) hairpin (Fig. 1A). However, this sequence was subsequently shown not to be important for dimerization in vivo (32Laughrea M. Shen N. Jette L. Darlix J.L. Kleiman L. Wainberg M.A. Virology. 2001; 281: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the light of our results, the circles observed by Höglund et al. may also involve the TAR-TAR interaction. NC is produced by proteolytic cleavage from the Gag precursor protein during maturation of the viral particle. The finding that the TAR-TAR interaction is dependent upon the NC protein may therefore ensure that TAR dimerization does not occur during synthesis of the HIV-1 RNA in the infected cell, where TAR has to fulfill its role in enhancing transcription through binding of the viral Tat and cellular proteins (reviewed in Ref. 6Karn J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 235-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). During virion assembly or immediately after budding from the host cell, the NC protein is released and becomes closely associated with the RNA genome. At this stage, NC can facilitate structural rearrangements that stabilize the TAR dimer into an extended duplex structure. This may serve as an additional element to stabilize the RNA dimer at the packaging step. TAR dimerization may also function to bring together the TAR elements, which are positioned at each end of the HIV-1 RNA genome. Our observation of tetrameric TAR complexes may even suggest that all four TAR copies present in the virus particle can become associated. Association of the TAR sequences located at the termini of the HIV-1 genome could facilitate the essential transfer of the minus-strand strong-stop DNA transcription unit from the 5′ to the 3′ R region in the genome (10Gilboa E. Mitra S.W. Goff S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1979; 18: 93-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). This model is in agreement with recent reports (16Andersen E.S. Jeeninga R.E. Damgaard C.K. Berkhout B. Kjems J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3020-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 33Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4710-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) showing that RNA template dimerization strongly increases template switching by reverse transcriptase and that the native structure of HIV-1 RNA extracted from virus particles is required for the first-strand transfer (34Berkhout B. Das A.T. van Wamel J.L. Virology. 1998; 249: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, the NC protein might play an important role in setting the stage for reverse transcription of the HIV-1 genome. The importance of the TAR dimerization for viral replication remains to be studied. If crucial, the unique structural properties of the TAR dimer may provide a novel therapeutic target for inhibiting several fundamental steps in the replication cycle of HIV-1.

https://openalex.org/W1984645442,"The experiments in this study were undertaken to determine whether inhibition of calpain activity in skeletal muscle is associated with alterations in muscle metabolism. Transgenic mice that overexpress human calpastatin, an endogenous calpain inhibitor, in skeletal muscle were produced. Compared with wild type controls, muscle calpastatin mice demonstrated normal glucose tolerance. Levels of the glucose transporter GLUT4 were increased more than 3-fold in the transgenic mice by Western blotting while mRNA levels for GLUT4 and myocyte enhancer factors, MEF 2A and MEF 2D, protein levels were decreased. We found that GLUT4 can be degraded by calpain-2, suggesting that diminished degradation is responsible for the increase in muscle GLUT4 in the calpastatin transgenic mice. Despite the increase in GLUT4, glucose transport into isolated muscles from transgenic mice was not increased in response to insulin. The expression of protein kinase B was decreased by ∼60% in calpastatin transgenic muscle. This decrease could play a role in accounting for the insulin resistance relative to GLUT4 content of calpastatin transgenic muscle. The muscle weights of transgenic animals were substantially increased compared with controls. These results are consistent with the conclusion that calpain-mediated pathways play an important role in the regulation of GLUT4 degradation in muscle and in the regulation of muscle mass. Inhibition of calpain activity in muscle by overexpression of calpastatin is associated with an increase in GLUT4 protein without a proportional increase in insulin-stimulated glucose transport.

These studies indicate that a reduction in calpain activity caused by calpain inhibitors induces a state of insulin resistance in isolated muscle strips (14Sreenan S.K. Zhou Y.P. Otani K. Hansen P.A. Currie K.P.M. Pan C.Y. Lee J.P. Ostrega D.M. Pugh W. Horikawa Y. Cox N.J. Hanis C.L. Burant C.F. Fox A.P. Bell G.I. Polonsky K.S. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2013-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Pancreatic islets exposed to calpain inhibitors for 4–6 h demonstrated increased glucose-induced insulin secretion, whereas longer periods of exposure induced significant defects in insulin secretory responses to glucose and other secretagogues (14Sreenan S.K.

These studies are limited by the fact that all experiments were conducted in vitro, and nonspecific effects of the calpain inhibitors, although unlikely, cannot be completely excluded. To examine the effects of inhibiting calpain activity using another in vivo experimental system, we produced transgenic mice that overexpress the endogenous calpain inhibitor, calpastatin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of MCK-hCAST Transgenic Mice—Full-length human calpastatin (hCAST) 1The abbreviations used are: hCAST, human calpastatin; GLUT4, glucose transporter 4; MEF, myocyte enhancer factor; mMCK, mouse muscle-specific creatine kinase; EDL, extensor digitorum longus; WT, wild type; CsTg, calpastatin overexpression transgenic. corresponding to the 673-amino acid isoform described in GenBank™ accession number 1611327A was obtained using human pancreatic islet cDNA as template and amplified with forward and reverse primers 5′-TGG TGC AAC CAG CAA GTC TTC-3′ and 5′-GGA TGT TCA GAG ACT CAA C-3′, respectively. The PCR product was subcloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and the sequence of the insert confirmed. The insert was excised by digestion with EcoRI and cloned into the EcoRI site of the mouse muscle-specific creatine kinase (mMCK) promoter-bovine growth hormone (bGH) polyadenylation signal vector (15Zhu X. Hadhazy M. Groh M.E. Wheeler M.T. Wollmann R. McNally E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21785-21790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The 4.28-kb mMCK-hCAST-bGH was excised from the vector by digestion with HhaI and purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation (Fig. 1). Transgenic mice were generated by microinjection of transgene DNA into the pronucleus of fertilized single-cell C57BL6 embryos at DNX Transgenic Sciences (Princeton, NJ). Animals were housed in a room maintained at 23 °C with a fixed 12-h light-dark cycle and given free access to Purina chow and water. After an overnight fast, mice were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (5 mg/100 g body weight), and the soleus, epitrochlearis, extensor digitorum longus (EDL), and other muscles were excised. All experimental procedures were approved by the Washington University Animal Study Committee.DNA, RNA, and Protein Analysis—The mMCK-hCAST transgene was detected in transgenic mice by PCR analysis of tail DNA using forward and reverse primers 5′-GGC AAC GAG CTG AAA GCT CAT C-3′ and 5′-CAG TGA TAC CAG CAA CAC TCT CTC CAC C-3′. Total RNA was isolated from skeletal muscle using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and suspended in Dnase- Rnase-free distilled water (Invitrogen). Mouse GLUT4 mRNA levels were determined by competitive RT-PCR using GLUT4 forward primer plus nested forward primer 5′-TCA ATG CCC CAC AGA AGG TGT CAA TGG TTG GGA AGG AAA AGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AAC CAG AAT GCC AAT GAC GAT G-3′ as described previously (34Garcia-Roves P.M.

Protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. The membranes were probed with the following primary antibodies: polyclonal anti-CAST (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), anti-GLUT1 and -GLUT4 (a generous gift from Dr. Mike Mueckler, Washington University), anti-MEF 2A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-MEF 2D (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) as well as anti-insulin receptor β subunit, anti-insulin receptor substrate-1, anti-insulin receptor substrate-2, monoclonal anti-Akt/PKB, and anti-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, all from Upstate Cell Signaling Solution, Lake Placid, NY. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA), and reagents for enhanced chemiluminescence were obtained from Amersham Biosciences.Physiological Studies—Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests were performed following a 4-h fast. Blood was sampled from the tail vein prior to and 30, 60, and 120 min after injection of dextrose intraperitoneally (2 g/kg body weight). For glucose transport studies, epitrochlearis, soleus, and EDL muscles were removed and allowed to recover from dissection by incubation in 2 ml of Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KHB) containing 8 mm glucose, 32 mm mannitol, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 35 °C in a shaking incubator. This was followed by 30 min of incubation in the same medium with or without a maximally effective insulin concentration (2 microunits/ml). The gas phase during the incubation was 95% O2, 5%CO2. The muscles were then washed for 10 min in KHB containing 40 mm mannitol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and insulin (if it was present in the previous incubation) to remove glucose from the extracellular space. Muscles were then transferred to 1.5 ml of KHB containing 3 mm 2-deoxy-d-[1,2-3H]glucose (2DG) (1.5 μCi/ml), 36 mm [14C]mannitol (0.2 μCi/ml), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and insulin (if it was present in the previous incubation). Extracellular space and intracellular 2DG concentration were then determined as described previously (16Young D.A. Uhl J.J. Cartee G.D. Holloszy J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16049-16053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Measurement of Muscle Weight—The soleus, EDL, tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and quadriceps muscles were dissected out using a consistent surgical approach. The muscles were weighed immediately following dissection after blood had been removed from the muscle surface.Measurement of Muscle Glycogen Content—Glycogen content was measured in perchloric acid extracts of muscle by the amyloglucosidase method (17Passonneau J.V.

Unlabeled hGLUT4 was prepared by using 20 μm Met in the coupled transcription and translation reaction. Four microliters of the coupled transcription and translation reaction was incubated with 1.7 units of recombinant rat calpain-2 (Calbiochem) in 20 μl of calpain cleavage buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Calpain was activated by addition of CaCl2 to 5 mm. Cleavage was terminated after 5 and 30 min by addition of 20 μl of SDS-sample buffer (0.125 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.2 m dithiothreitol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue). Samples were heated at 55 °C for 15 min and analyzed on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography or Western blotting. The Western blot was developed using a polyclonal anti-GLUT4 antibody generated using a cytoplasmic 12-amino acid C-terminal peptide from mouse GLUT4 (Alpha Diagnostic, San Antonio, TX).RESULTSGeneration of Transgenic Mice Overexpressing Calpastatin in Muscle—We obtained five founders (two females and three males). Human calpastatin was expressed in muscle (soleus and EDL) from all five founders. The founder used to generate the mice used in the present experiments showed a substantially greater level of calpastatin expression (∼20-fold) than the other founders, which all showed a similar level of overexpression. All transgenic mice were heterozygous. All were used around 4 months of age.Calpastatin Expression by Western Blot—Overexpression of human calpastatin in muscles was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 2). Although human calpastatin was not expressed in muscle from WT mice, substantial expression was detected in transgenic (CsTg) mice.Fig. 2Muscle calpastatin expression. Overexpression of human calpastatin in muscles of CsTg but not WT mice was confirmed by Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Mouse Body Weight and Glucose Tolerance—The body weights of male WT mice averaged 28.1 ± 0.6 g compared with 31.2 ± 0.5 g for the CsTg group (p <0.01, 8 mice per group, 23–25 weeks old). For the female mice, body weight averaged 21.8 ± 0.3 g for the WT group and 23.2 ± 0.4 g for the CsTg group (p <0.01, n = 16 per group, 23–25 weeks old). Differences in the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test between the WT and the CsTg mice (WT versus CsTg: 182.3 ± 6.9 mg/dl versus 197.9 ± 9.3 mg/ dl at fasting, 189.3 ± 7.0 mg/ dl versus 198.3 ± 10.0 mg/ dl at 2 h after injection) were not statistically significant.Insulin Action in Muscle from CsTg Mice—The increase in 2-deoxy-d-[1,2-3H] glucose transport in response to a maximally effective insulin concentration (2 microunits/ml) was not significantly different in muscles from CsTg mice as compared with the WT controls in either EDL (Fig. 3), soleus (data not shown), or epitrochlearis (data not shown). Basal rates of glucose transport were also not different.Fig. 3Insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose transport. EDL muscles were incubated in the absence or presence of insulin (2 microunits/ml). Values shown are means ± S.E. for seven muscles per group. There were no significant differences between the WT and the CsTg mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)GLUT4 Glucose Transporter Expression—As shown in Fig. 4, GLUT4 protein content of EDL, soleus, triceps, and tibialis anterior muscles was increased more than 3-fold in CsTg mice. The magnitude of insulin-stimulated muscle glucose transport is normally directly proportional to muscle GLUT4 content. This relationship is evident when muscle fiber types with different GLUT4 contents are compared (19Henriksen E.J. Bourey R.E. Rodnick K.J. Koranyi L. Permutt M.A. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: E593-E598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in muscles that have undergone an adaptive increase in GLUT4 protein (20Weinstein S.P. Watts J. Haber R.S. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 21Ren J.M. Semenkovich C.F. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C146-C150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ren J.-M.

Thus, the finding that stimulated glucose transport was the same in the CsTg as in the WT muscles despite 3-fold increases in the GLUT4 protein indicates that the increase in GLUT4 protein associated with calpastatin overexpression did not cause the expected increase in glucose transport in response to stimulation by insulin.Fig. 4Measurement of immunoreactive GLUT4.

Zheng D. Jones J.P. Olson A.L. Dohm G.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, GLUT4 mRNA was significantly decreased in muscles from CsTg mice (Fig. 5), suggesting that the increase in GLUT4 protein was mediated by a post-transcriptional mechanism. Further support for this hypothesis is provided by the finding that MEF 2A and MEF 2D protein levels were decreased ∼50% in the CsTg muscles. Expression of GLUT4 in striated muscle is dependent on binding of a MEF 2A-MEF 2D heterodimer to the GLUT4 promoter (24Mora S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16323-16328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We have found that stimuli that induce increased GLUT4 expression also result in increases in MEF 2A and MEF 2D (25Ojuka E.O. Jones T.E. Nolte L.A. Chen M. Wamhoff B.R. Sturek M. Holloszy J.O. Am. J.

If this hypothesis is correct, one might also expect to see an increase in GLUT1 protein because its amino acid sequence is similar to that of GLUT4 (26Mueckler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). We, therefore, measured the GLUT1 protein level and found that it was also increased in skeletal muscle of the CsTg mice. Although highly significant (controls, 1.04 ± 0.14 versus CsTg, 1.66 ± 0.14 arbitrary units, mean ± S.E. for 16 muscles per group, p <0.004), the magnitude of the increase was smaller than that of GLUT4.Muscle Glycogen—Glucose transport is the primary ratelimiting step that determines the rate and extent of muscle glycogen accumulation (27Ren J.M.

Increases in muscle GLUT4 are, therefore, generally associated with an increase in muscle glycogen content (20Weinstein S.P. Watts J. Haber R.S. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 21Ren J.M. Semenkovich C.F. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C146-C150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ren J.-M.

Muscle glycogen concentrations were significantly increased in muscles of the CsTg mice, 20.4 ± 0.9 μmol/g EDL WT muscle compared with 46.0 ± 2.7 μmol/g EDL CsTg muscle.Effect of Muscle Glycogen Depletion on Glucose Transport— Accumulation of glycogen in muscle may induce insulin resistance. To determine whether the increase in glycogen in muscles from CsTg mice was masking an increase in muscle glucose transport in CsTg muscles, we exposed muscles to hypoxia for 80 min, a maneuver that reduces glycogen. The glucose concentration in the incubation medium for the CsTg muscles was also reduced compared with the incubations for the WT muscles (2 and 8 mm glucose, respectively). This approach markedly reduced glycogen concentrations to ∼7 μmol/g muscle wet weight. However, even after a reduction in muscle glycogen there were no significant differences in glucose transport induced by 2 microunits/ml insulin and hypoxia in the EDL and the soleus muscles of the CsTg compared with the WT mice (data not shown). Thus, the increase in GLUT4 resulting from calpain inhibition was not associated with a parallel increase in muscle glucose transport.Proteins of the Insulin Signaling Pathway—As a next step in our investigation of the mechanism responsible for the relative insulin resistance of the CsTg muscles, we measured the levels of some of the proteins of the insulin signaling pathway. Expression of the insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase proteins was similar in skeletal muscle of the transgenic and wild type mice (Fig. 7). However, there was a remarkable (∼60%) decrease in protein kinase B in skeletal muscle of the CsTg mice (Fig. 7). This finding could explain why insulin-stimulated glucose transport is not increased in CsTg muscle despite a ∼3-fold increase in GLUT4.Fig. 7Measurement of immunoreactive insulin receptor (IR), insulin receptor substrates (IRS) -1 and -2, protein kinase B (PKB), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K).

The recombinant hGLUT4 has a mass of 43.7 kDa, and incubation with activated calpain-2 generated a protein with an estimated mass of 37.2 kDa (Fig. 8A). This fragment was not identified by an antibody that binds to an epitope at the C terminus of GLUT4 (Fig. 8B), suggesting the calpain-2 cleavage site is located in the C-terminal portion of GLUT4. The mass of the cleavage product suggests that the calpain-sensitive site is about 60–70 residues from the C terminus.Fig. 8Human GLUT4 is cleaved by calpain-2 in vitro. A, 35S-labeled recombinant hGLUT4 was incubated with calpain-2 for 5 and 30 min. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. B, unlabeled recombinant GLUT4 was incubated with calpain-2. The GLUT4 protein was identified by Western blot using an anti-C-terminal GLUT4 antibody (αGLUT4). The arrowhead indicates the GLUT4 fragment generated on incubation with calpain-2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Effects on Muscle Mass—To determine whether overexpression of calpastatin affected muscle mass, muscles were systematically weighed in 23–25-week-old mice. Weight of EDL and soleus muscles was increased 12% (EDL, males), 33% (EDL, females), 17% (soleus, males), and 19% (soleus, females), respectively (Fig. 9A). Similar increases in mass were present in the other muscles, including the tibialis anterior (42% in males, 47% in females), gastrocnemius (13% in males, 14% in females), and quadriceps (21% in males, 14% in females) (Fig. 9B). Total muscle protein was increased in proportion to muscle weight in EDL (WT versus CsTg: 1.96 ± 0.10 mg versus 2.40 ± 0.10 mg, p <0.01) and soleus (WT versus CsTg: 1.58 ± 0.08 mg versus 1.85 ± 0.10 mg, p <0.05).Fig. 9Muscle weight.

Phosphorylation of serine residue 301 promotes ubiquitination and rapid degradation of the E2 protein by the proteasome pathway. To understand the mechanism through which phosphorylation regulates the intracellular levels of this unique papillomavirus regulatory protein, we have carried out an extensive mutational analysis of the region surrounding the phosphorylation sites of the E2 protein. Our results indicate that casein kinase II phosphorylates serine 301. However, phosphorylation of serine 301 is not a sufficient recognition motif for proteasomal degradation; other residues that directly surround the phosphorylation sites are crucial for E2 degradation. The phenotypes of E2 proteins mutated in this region indicate that phosphorylation of serine 301 induces a conformational change that leads to degradation of the E2 protein. In support of this model, circular dichroism studies of the conformational tendencies of peptides from this region indicate that phosphorylation at position 301 decreases the local thermodynamic stability of this region. Thus, this region appears to have evolved to display a marginal local thermodynamic stability that can be regulated by phosphorylation, leading to targeted degradation of the E2 protein.

Papillomaviruses are small DNA viruses that infect epithelia and cause persistently infected lesions known as papillomas or warts. The viral genome is maintained as a multicopy episome in the infected, dividing basal cells. The productive stage of the viral life cycle is highly dependent on epithelial differentiation; genome amplification, late gene expression, and capsid assembly occur only in the more differentiated cells of the epithelium. A subset of human papillomaviruses are associated with development of cervical carcinoma; however, bovine papillomavirus, type 1 (BPV-1), 1The abbreviations used are: BPV-1, bovine papillomavirus, type 1; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; TFE, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; CK2, casein kinase II; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: BPV-1, bovine papillomavirus, type 1; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; TFE, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; CK2, casein kinase II; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. has historically served as a molecular prototype for genetic analysis of the virus. BPV-1 encodes for several E2 gene products. These proteins are crucial for the viral life cycle, participating in several functions such as transcriptional regulation, viral DNA replication, and genome maintenance and segregation. The E2 protein activates transcription by binding to enhancer sequences in the viral genome (1Hawley-Nelson P. Androphy E.J. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and supports initiation of viral DNA replication by cooperatively binding with the E1 protein to the viral origin of replication (2Mohr I.J. Clark R. Sun S. Androphy E.J. MacPherson P. Botchan M.R. Science. 1990; 250: 1694-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). E2 mediates viral genome segregation by binding the viral genomes and tethering them to the cellular mitotic chromosomes (3Skiadopoulos M.H. McBride A.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2079-2088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lehman C.W. Botchan M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4338-4343Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 5Ilves I. Kivi S. Ustav M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4404-4412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length E2 protein contains two conserved functional domains as follows: the N-terminal transactivation domain of ∼200 amino acids, and a C-terminal DNA binding and dimerization domain contained in the last 100 amino acids (reviewed in Ref. 6McBride A.A. Myers G. Myers G. Baker C. Munger K. Sverdrup F. McBride A. Bernard H.-U. Human Papillomaviruses. Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM1997: III54-III99Google Scholar). These domains are separated by a flexible hinge region that is not well conserved among papillomavirus E2 proteins. The E2 protein has two major phosphorylation sites, mapped to serines 298 and 301, located in the region of the hinge that is directly adjacent to the DNA binding and dimerization domain (7McBride A.A. Bolen J.B. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5076-5085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A minor phosphorylation site has also been mapped in the hinge at serine 235 (8Lehman C.W. King D.S. Botchan M.R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3652-3665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The major phosphorylation sites, 298 and 301, are found in a sequence of E2 that scores highly as a PEST sequence. These sequences are rich in proline, glutamate, aspartate, serine, and threonine and are found in many proteins with short half-lives and thus are believed to play a role in protein turnover (9Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of serine 301 targets E2 for rapid turnover by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (10Penrose K. McBride A.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6031-6038Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Substitution of serine 301 to alanine results in a protein with an increased half-life and reduced levels of ubiquitination (10Penrose K. McBride A.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6031-6038Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This, in turn, results in a virus that maintains episomal viral genomes at a much higher copy number than that of the wild type genome (11McBride A.A. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6528-6534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an important regulatory role in the cell by specifically degrading proteins. Proteins are marked for degradation by the addition of ubiquitin moieties to specific lysine residues (reviewed in Ref. 12Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). Three main classes of enzymes are involved in the conjugation of ubiquitin to a substrate: an E1 ubiquitin activation enzyme, an E2 ubiquitin carrier protein, and an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The E3 ubiquitin ligase confers specificity to the system by its ability to recognize protein substrates for targeted degradation. Proteins can be constitutively recognized or conditionally targeted by the ubiquitin pathway. In some cases, the specific E3 ubiquitin ligase must be modified before it can interact with its target protein, and in others, the E3 ligase requires the use of ancillary or docking proteins to interact with their targets. An example of the latter E3 ligase is another papillomavirus protein, E6, which is required to mediate an association between the ubiquitin ligase E6-AP and the target protein, p53 (13Scheffner M. Werness B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1129-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3410) Google Scholar). Finally, E3 ubiquitin ligase recognition can be triggered by post-translational modification of the substrate protein. In the case of BPV-1 E2 protein, phosphorylation at residue 301 results in enhanced protein degradation. Phosphorylation could trigger this recognition in a number of ways: the phosphorylated region of the E2 protein could be directly recognized by a specific ubiquitin ligase; alternatively, phosphorylation could induce a conformational change that exposes either a ubiquitin ligase recognition site or a lysine that is normally masked for ubiquitin conjugation. In this study, we have carried out an extensive mutational analysis of the region surrounding the E2 phosphorylation sites to understand how phosphorylation targets E2 for recognition and degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. We demonstrate that casein kinase II (CK2) can phosphorylate serine 301. However, the ubiquitin ligase responsible for recognition and degradation of E2 does not directly recognize phosphoserine 301; phosphorylation most likely induces a conformational change that is important for recognition and subsequent degradation of E2. Cell Culture—CV-1-derived lines, expressing the E2 proteins from an inducible metallothionein promoter, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. These cell lines were generated by transfection of a series of pMEP-E2 plasmids using Superfect (Qiagen). Hygromycin B-resistant colonies containing episomal plasmids were pooled and used for all experiments. Plasmids—E2 genes expressing either wild type or mutated E2 proteins from the inducible metallothionein promoter were cloned in the pMEP-4 plasmid (Invitrogen), as described before (10Penrose K. McBride A.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6031-6038Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To generate these plasmids, the KpnI to StyI region of E2 was reconstructed with synthetic oligonucleotides encoding the sequence of choice in an intermediate cloning vector containing a portion of the BPV-1 genome. Mutations were made using the most conservative base changes and were verified by DNA sequencing. The KpnI to StyI region (nucleotides 3460–3535) of E2 was reconstructed with synthetic oligonucleotides to yield plasmids containing wild type E2, E2R291A, E2Q292A, E2E293A, E2E294A, E2E295A, E2E296A, E2Q297A, E2P299A, E2D300A, E2T302A, E2E303A, E2E304A, E2E305A, E2P306A, E2V307A, E2T308A, E2L309A, E2P310A, E2A293–296, E2Δ293–296, E2A303–305, E2Δ303–305, E2A293–296,A303–305, E2E303P, E2E304P, E2E305P, E2insA299–300, and E2insAA299–300. The resulting KpnI to BamHI BPV-1 fragments from the intermediate plasmids were replaced for the equivalent region in the pMEP-E2 vector, as described previously (10Penrose K. McBride A.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6031-6038Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In these plasmids the pMEP vectors contain BPV-1 sequences 2608–4208. For plasmids pMEP-E2S301D, pMEP-E2S301E, pMEP-E2S298A,E304Q, E2EEE(S290E,S298E,S301E) and E2E304Q, the mutations were generated as described above, transferred to the BPV-1 genome, and the KpnI to BamHI fragment transferred from here to the pMEP-E2 plasmid. To generate plasmids pMEP-E2S290A, pMEP-E2S298A, and pMEP-E2AAA (S290A,S298A,S301A), the KpnI (nucleotide 3460) to BamHI (nucleotide 4451) fragments containing the amino acid substitutions were obtained from existing constructs (7McBride A.A. Bolen J.B. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5076-5085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11McBride A.A. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6528-6534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bastien N. McBride A.A. Virology. 2000; 270: 124-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This series of DNAs contains BPV-1 sequences 2608–4451. To generate plasmids to express E2 in vitro in an Escherichia coli lysate, the NheI to BamHI fragments from pMEP-E2, pMEP-E2S301A, and pMEP-E2S298A,E304Q were sub-cloned into the corresponding sites of pET-23a in vitro expression plasmid (Novagen). To optimize for expression in E. coli, the initiation region of E2 was reconstructed with an optimal ribosome-binding site by inserting double-stranded oligonucleotides 5′-TATGGAGACAGCATG-3′ between the NdeI and SphI sites. Protein Expression and Extraction—E2 protein expression was induced in hygromycin-resistant CV-1 cell lines by treatment for 2 h with 1 μm CdSO4. For pulse-chase analysis, CdSO4 was removed after induction, and cells were treated with 25 μg/ml cycloheximide and 25 μg/ml emetine. Where proteasome inhibitors were used, cells were treated with 20 μm MG132 (Calbiochem) either during induction or during the treatment with 25 μg/ml cycloheximide and 25 μg/ml emetine (Sigma). For standard SDS-PAGE analysis, cellular protein was extracted in 2% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2 mm NaF, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Samples for isoelectric focusing were extracted in 8 m urea, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm NaF, and 1× Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture. Total protein concentrations were measured using a BCA protein assay (Pierce). The stability of each E2 protein was assayed at least three times. SDS-PAGE, Two-dimensional Isoelectric Focusing, and Western Blotting—For standard SDS-PAGE analysis, 10 μg of protein was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto Immobilon P membranes (Millipore). For two-dimensional isoelectric focusing, 20 μg of protein was separated on pH3–7NL Immobilon dry strips using the IPGphor system (Amersham Biosciences) using standard procedures. Following isoelectric focusing, the Immobilon strips were equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, and separated in the second dimension, as described above. Western blotting was performed following standard protocols using anti-E2 monoclonal antibody B201 (obtained from Elliot Androphy) followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Pierce). E2 proteins were detected using chemiluminescence reagent Super Signal Dura (Pierce). Images were collected on a Kodak Imagestation 440CF using Kodak One-dimensional Image Analysis software. The phosphorylation status of each protein was assayed at least three times. Kinase Assays—In vitro kinase assays were carried out using various E2 substrates. Synthetic peptides spanning residues 283–311 of the E2 protein were kinased for 30 min with either CK1 or CK2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) in a reaction containing 0.2 mm peptide, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 50 μm ATP, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Similar assays were carried out with GSK-3, cdc-2, MAPK, and DNA-dependent protein kinases. Full-length E2 proteins translated in vitro from pET23-E2 plasmids in E. coli extracts (Roche Applied Science RTS system) were also used as substrates for CK2, as was E2 protein expressed in mammalian CV-1 cells from pPAVA viruses as described previously (7McBride A.A. Bolen J.B. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5076-5085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using conditions similar to those described for synthetic peptides. Phosphorylation of full-length E2 protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Incorporation of 32P into peptides was analyzed after separation on 20% polyacrylamide SDS/Tris-Tricine gels. Phosphorylated peptides were detected using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Fifty micrograms of unlabeled peptides were separated on the same gel and detected by silver stain. Peptide Synthesis and Purification—Peptides representing amino acids 283–311 of E2 were obtained through the NIAID peptide facility (National Institutes of Health) and were purified by reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography. All peptides were dissolved in water to a concentration of ∼500 μm and stored at -70 °C. Quantification of the peptides was carried out by absorbance at 220 nm in HCl. The peptides are named according to the phosphorylated residue (E2283–311, E2283–311S298P; and E2283–311S301P). Circular Dichroism—Circular dichroism spectra of peptides were obtained using a Jasco J-815 instrument. Cell paths were either 0.1 or 1 mm, and protein concentration, pH, and temperature are indicated in the experiment. Five far-UV scans were averaged, and the buffer base line was subtracted from all spectra registered. Where indicated, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (ICN) was added. Temperature was kept within ±0.1 °C, using a peltier device. For the fraction of α-helical secondary structure (fα) content of the peptides we used Equation 1 (15Rohl C.A. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8435-8442Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). fα=[θ]222exp−[θ]222coil[θ]222max−[θ]222coil(Eq. 1) where [θ]222exp is the measured ellipticity value at 222 nm; [θ]222coil is the tabulated ellipticity for random coil, and [θ]222max is the ellipticity corresponding to a 100% helical peptide (16Sanz J.M. Jimenez M.A. Gimenez-Gallego G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1923-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Serine 301 Targets BPV-1 E2 for Degradation by the Proteasome—The BPV-1 E2 transactivator protein has a half-life of ∼40 min (10Penrose K. McBride A.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6031-6038Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 17Hubbert N.L. Schiller J.T. Lowy D.R. Androphy E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5864-5868Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We have shown previously (10Penrose K. McBride A.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6031-6038Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) that substitution of the phosphoacceptor serine residue 301 with alanine leads to an increase in half-life and reduced levels of ubiquitination. To assess further the stability of the E2 species, the phosphorylation status of E2 was analyzed when proteasomal degradation was blocked with the inhibitor MG132. These experiments were carried out using CV-1 cells that stably maintain Epstein-Barr virus-derived extrachromosomal vectors, which express E2 from an inducible metallothionein promoter. As described previously, these cell lines can be induced to express E2 at levels that exhibit appropriate nuclear localization and turnover of the E2 protein (10Penrose K. McBride A.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6031-6038Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). CV-1 cells were induced to express both wild type E2 protein and E2 with a serine to alanine substitution at residue 301 (E2 S301A). Phosphorylation of E2 does not produce a mobility shift on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and therefore phosphorylated species must be separated by isoelectric focusing and detected by Western blot using a monoclonal antibody directed against E2. As shown in Fig. 1, panel A, three species of wild type E2 protein were observed when they were separated by size and charge. The most abundant species corresponds to unmodified E2; the middle species corresponds to phosphorylation on one residue (but does not distinguish between serine 298 and serine 301), and the most acidic species furthermost to the left corresponds to E2 containing two phosphorylated residues. We have shown previously (7McBride A.A. Bolen J.B. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5076-5085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by phosphate labeling that the more acidic species correspond to phosphorylated forms of E2 protein. As shown in Fig. 1, panel C, the number of phosphorylated species is reduced to one in the E2 S301A protein, and the abundance of both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated species is increased. Treatment with MG132 should result in the accumulation of the most rapidly turned over species, and as predicted, an accumulation of phosphorylated species was observed (Fig. 1, panels B and D). This is most dramatic in the wild type E2 protein (Fig. 1, panel B). This confirms that the phosphorylated species of E2 are more rapidly degraded by the proteasome than unmodified E2 and supports the hypothesis that phosphorylation of serine 301 targets E2 for degradation by the proteasome. Mutational Analysis of the PEST Region of BPV-1 E2—To understand exactly how E2 is targeted for degradation by the proteasome, an extensive mutational analysis of the region surrounding the phosphorylation sites was carried out, and the resulting E2 proteins were assayed for phosphorylation and protein stability. For this analysis, the previously mapped serine phosphoacceptors at positions 298 and 301 were substituted with both neutral and negatively charged residues that could potentially substitute for phosphoserine. In addition, kinase consensus sequences present in this region of E2 were targeted for mutation, and stretches of negatively charged amino acids toward the N terminus and C terminus of the phosphorylation sites were deleted or substituted with alanine residues. To determine whether conformation of the region C-terminal to the phosphorylation sites is critical in determining the stability of the protein, proline substitutions were made to disrupt any inherent structure in this region. Finally, each residue from residue 286–310 was individually substituted with an alanine residue. The mutations generated are illustrated in Fig. 2. CV-1 cell lines expressing each mutated E2 protein were established, as described above. To understand how phosphorylation of serine 301 targets BPV-1 E2 for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome, the phosphorylation status and stability of each of the mutated E2 proteins were analyzed. Phosphorylation Status of Mutated E2 Proteins—To determine the phosphorylation status, E2 expression was induced in CV-1 cell lines, and protein extracts were separated by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing and were detected by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody directed against E2. As described for Fig. 1, the wild type E2 protein displays three species; the most basic species corresponds to unmodified protein; the middle species corresponds to phosphorylation on one residue (either serine 298 or serine 301); and the most acidic species corresponds to the fully phosphorylated protein (both serine 298 and 301 phosphorylated). The phosphorylation status of the mutated E2 proteins is shown in Fig. 3. A CK2 Consensus Sequence Is Crucial for Phosphorylation of Serine 301—We have shown previously that substitution of serine 301 with alanine eliminates phosphorylation of this site and stabilizes the protein. In this study, serine 301 was also mutated to glutamic and aspartic acid to determine whether a negatively charged side chain can substitute for phosphoserine at position 301. As shown in Fig. 3, substitution of residue 301 with alanine, glutamic acid, or aspartic acid resulted in loss of at least one phosphorylated species. The strongest consensus for well characterized protein kinases that could modify serine 301 is CK2. The CK2 consensus is (S/T)XX(D/E) where S/T is the phosphorylation site, and there is an absolute requirement for a negative charge at the +3 position (18Meggio F. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 401-409PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether CK2 is responsible for phosphorylation of serine 301, the kinase consensus site was destroyed by substituting glutamine for glutamate at residue 304 in the crucial +3 position (E2E304Q). As can be seen in Fig. 3, this substitution also eliminated at least one phosphorylated E2 species, confirming that CK2 is responsible for phosphorylation of residue 301 in vivo. It has been shown that an environment of negatively charged residues enhances phosphorylation by CK2 (18Meggio F. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 401-409PubMed Google Scholar), and notably this region of the E2 protein is strongly acidic. Deletion or substitution of the stretches of acidic residues toward the N terminus (293–296) and/or C terminus (303–305) of residue 301 was found to decrease E2 phosphorylation, providing further evidence that CK2 is responsible for modification of serine 301. Serine 298 Can Be Phosphorylated by an Alternative Kinase—Serine 298 is also a major phosphorylation site of E2 (7McBride A.A. Bolen J.B. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5076-5085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, mutation of this residue has no phenotype in measurements of E2 function that have been tested so far (11McBride A.A. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6528-6534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown previously, substitution of serine 298 with alanine eliminates one phosphorylated E2 species (Fig. 3) (7McBride A.A. Bolen J.B. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5076-5085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, serine 298 does not contain a strong consensus for any particular kinase. Serine 298 could be a substrate for CK2 phosphorylation if serine 301 is phosphorylated, thus providing a negative charge at the +3 position. However, E2S301A retains the ability to be phosphorylated at one site; therefore, at least under these conditions, residue 298 must be modified by a different kinase. Disrupting the spacing between serines 298 and 301 by inserting two alanine residues between proline 299 and aspartate 300 (E2insAA299–300) should abolish CK2 phosphorylation of serine 298; however, this protein is fully phosphorylated. Therefore, another kinase must have the ability to phosphorylate residue 298. Serine 298 is also a potential CK1 site, which requires a stretch of negative charges N-terminal to the phosphoaccepter site with a crucial negative charge at the -3 position (19Flotow H. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3724-3727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alanine substitution or deletion of the glutamate stretch N-terminal to the phosphorylation sites (293–296) greatly reduces phosphorylation of E2. The decrease in phosphorylation could be the direct result of eliminating the CK1 consensus for serine 298, but this analysis does not allow us to distinguish between phosphorylation of residues 298 and 301. Another explanation for the effect of mutation of the glutamate group (residues 293–296) is that the presence of the negative charges N-terminal to the phosphorylation sites could also increase CK2 phosphorylation, which is enhanced with increasing numbers of negatively charged amino acids in the surrounding region. Furthermore, when serine 298 is phosphorylated, serine 301 could be a potential CK1 site. CK1 was first classified as a phosphate-directed protein kinase with the requirement for a phosphorylated serine (pS) or threonine (pT) at the n-3 position ((pS/pT)XXS) (20Flotow H. Graves P.R. Wang A.Q. Fiol C.J. Roeske R.W. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14264-14269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, for the same reasons listed previously for synergism of CK2 phosphorylation between the phosphorylation sites, there must be additional or alternative mechanisms to phosphorylate these sites in vivo when the second phosphorylation site is removed by mutation or the spacing between the sites is changed. Serine 298 is also contained in a very minimal consensus motif for cyclin-dependent kinases (an SP motif). However, alanine substitution of proline 299 should eliminate such phosphorylation, and on the contrary, phosphorylation of both sites is greatly increased. However, it remains possible that a proline-directed kinase does modify residue 298 in the wild type E2 protein, but when the proline is removed then 298 becomes phosphorylated by an alternative mechanism. E2 Mutations That Increase Phosphorylation—Notably, some mutations resulted in dramatically enhanced levels of the doubly phosphorylated protein (the most acidic species); these were substitutions of proline 299 or threonine 302 with alanine, and to a lesser extent substitution of aspartate 300 with alanine (Fig. 3). This enhancement could be explained either as an enhancement in kinase recognition or an increase in stability of the double-phosphorylated protein so that it now becomes the predominant species. The results of the stability experiments described below (Fig. 5) indicate that the latter situation is likely, as each of these proteins has increased stability. Proteins in which the serine 301 phosphorylation site has been replaced by an acidic residue, S301E and S301D, also show enhanced phosphorylation on the remaining serine 298 site. This could also be because of increased protein stability and/or enhancement of serine 298 phosphorylation by the presence of a negative charge at the +3 position. E2 Is Phosphorylated in Vitro by CK1 and CK2—To determine further which kinases are able to phosphorylate the E2 protein, a series of in vitro kinase assays were carried out by using different sources of E2 protein as substrates. To confirm that serine residue 301 is a CK2 substrate, full-length E2 protein was translated in vitro in E. coli lysates and used as a substrate for CK2. As shown in Fig. 4, panel A, wild type E2 was phosphorylated by CK2, and this was dependent on a serine residue at 301; substitution with alanine eliminated phosphorylation. Destruction of the serine 301 CK2 consensus site by substitution at the +3 position (E2E304Q) also eliminated phosphorylation, as did a combination of this mutation and an alanine substitution"

In this study we show that, in addition to the glucose signaling pathway, regulation of HXT1 expression also requires the HOG pathway. Deletion of components in the glucose signaling pathway or in the HOG pathway results in impaired HXT1 expression. Genetic analyses showed that, whereas the glucose signaling pathway regulates HXT1 through modulation of the Rgt1 transcription factor, the HOG pathway modulates HXT1 through regulation of the Sko1-Tup1-Ssn6 complex. Coordinated regulation of the two signaling pathways is required for expression of HXT1 by glucose and in response to osmostress. Expression of the HXT1 gene, which encodes a low affinity glucose transporter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is regulated positively in response to glucose by the general glucose induction pathway, involving the Snf3/Rgt2 membrane glucose sensors, the SCF-Grr1 ubiquitination complex and the Rgt1 transcription factor.

Coordinated regulation of the two signaling pathways is required for expression of HXT1 by glucose and in response to osmostress. Yeast cells are able to adjust cellular metabolism, gene expression, and growth in response to environmental stimuli. For example, the presence of glucose, the most preferable carbon source, is able to elicit a complex metabolic response based in two major levels: i) allosteric modification of different enzymes and ii) regulation of gene expression. Transcriptional regulation varies from inhibition of expression (glucose repression) to activation of transcription (glucose induction) (see Refs. 1Gancedo J.M. Gancedo C. Zimmermann F.K. Entian K.D. Yeast Sugar Metabolism. Technomic Publishing Co., Basel, Switzerland1997: 359-377Google Scholar, 2Gancedo J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 334-361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ozcan S.

Some of the genes induced in response to glucose encode for glycolytic enzymes, ribosomal proteins, and glucose transporters. Expression of the low affinity glucose transporter HXT1 has been used as a model to study the process of transcriptional activation by glucose (3Ozcan S. Johnston M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 554-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical studies have defined several components that are involved in the regulation of HXT1 expression. Glucose availability in the surrounding media is assessed by the membrane glucose sensor proteins Snf3 and Rgt2. This signal is then transmitted to the SCF-Grr1 ubiquitination complex (5Li F.N. Johnston M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5629-5638Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 6Kishi T. Seno T. Yamao F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), which finally modulates the activity of Rgt1, a transcription factor that belongs to the Cys6-Zinc cluster protein family, which acts as a transcriptional repressor in the absence of glucose (3Ozcan S. Johnston M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 554-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Mosley A.L. Lakshmanan J. Aryal B.K. Ozcan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10322-10327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Additional components of the glucose induction pathway are Std1 and Mth1, two proteins that modulate negatively HXT1 expression (3Ozcan S. Johnston M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 554-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lakshmanan J. Mosley A.L. Ozcan S. Curr. Genet. 2003; 44: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); recent studies indicate that Std1 and Mth1 may interact with the C-terminal tails of the glucose sensors Rgt2 and Snf3 and with Rgt1 (9Schmidt M.C.

Spielewoy N. Kalashnikova T.I. Guaderrama M. Zhu Q. Chang H.C. Wittenberg C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3230-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Moreover, data from several laboratories suggest the existence of an additional uncharacterized transcription factor, different from Rgt1, that regulates HXT1 gene expression (7Mosley A.L. Lakshmanan J. Aryal B.K. Ozcan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10322-10327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Exposure of yeast cells to increases in extracellular osmolarity results in the activation of the Hog1 MAPK 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MNNG, N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation. pathway. Activation of the Hog1 MAPK induces diverse osmo-adaptive responses such as regulation of gene expression. Genome-wide transcriptional analyses showed that a great number of genes are regulated by osmotic stress in an HOG1-dependent manner. Among these, there are genes that encode proteins implicated in carbohydrate metabolism, general stress protection, protein production, and signal transduction (reviewed in Ref. 13Hohmann S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 300-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). Several transcription factors have been reported to lie downstream of the MAPK, regulating different subsets of osmostress-responsive genes by different mechanisms. The general stress response transcription factors Msn2/Msn4 and the transcriptional regulator Hot1 are important for the recruitment of the Hog1 MAPK to stress-inducible promoters (14Alepuz P.M. Jovanovic A. Reiser V. Ammerer G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 767-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 15Alepuz P.M. de Nadal E. Zapater M. Ammerer G. Posas F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2433-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). On the other hand, modification of Smp1, a member of the MEF2 family of transcription factors, by Hog1 is important to modulate its transcriptional activity (16de Nadal E. Casadome L. Posas F. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Sko1, a member of the ATF-CREB family, inhibits transcription of several osmostress-inducible genes through recruitment of the general co-repressor complex Tup1-Ssn6 (17Marquez J.A. Pascual-Ahuir A. Proft M. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2543-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18Proft M. Serrano R. Mol. Cell.

Sko1 is phosphorylated by the Hog1 MAPK upon stress, and this is crucial to switch Sko1-Tup1-Ssn6 from a repressor to an activator complex (20Proft M. Pascual-Ahuir A. de Nadal E. Arino J. Serrano R. Posas F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 21Proft M. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1307-1317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In this work we show that regulation of HXT1 expression is achieved by two independent transcription factors, Rgt1 and Sko1, controlled by the glucose induction and HOG signaling pathways, respectively. Thus, induction of HXT1 gene expression in response to glucose and in response to osmotic stress (provided glucose was present) requires the coordinated activity of two independent signaling pathways that converge at the promoter level of HXT1.

Sanz P. Yeast. 2001; 18: 1309-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The HXT1 expression cassette (HXT1 promoter fused to Escherichia coli lacZ gene) was subcloned into plasmids pRS313(HIS3), pRS314(TRP1), and pRS316(URA3) (24Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids pEG202-Rgt1 (LexA-Rgt1) and the corresponding empty vector pEG202 were described in a previous study (11Tomas-Cobos L. Sanz P. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Plasmid pSH18–18 (6lexAop-lacZ) was described previously (25Kuchin S. Treich I. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7916-7920Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To perform promoter analysis, PCR-generated DNA fragments containing several regions of the HXT1 promoter up to the ATG were cloned into YIp358R(URA3) or YIp368R(LEU2) (26Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 45: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). To analyze internal promoter regions, different stretches from the 5′ upstream region were amplified by PCR and inserted into the CYC1-lacZ reporter construct pJS205 (27Schuller H.J. Hahn A. Troster F. Schutz A. Schweizer E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Plasmid pUC-rgt1Δ::URA3 was constructed in the following way. Plasmid pUC-Rgt1 (11Tomas-Cobos L. Sanz P. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was digested with BglII and dephosphorylated with calf intestinal phosphatase. In this way we removed a central 2806-bp region of RGT1, leaving 444 and 335 bp at 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, as flanking regions. A BamHI fragment from plasmid YDp-U (28Berben G. Dumont J. Gilliquet V. Bolle P.A. Hilger F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), containing the URA3 selection marker, was subcloned into the BglII sites of the former plasmid to give pUC-rgt1Δ::URA3, which was digested with BamHI and SalI to obtain a linear fragment that was used in the disruption experiments. Enzyme Assays—Cells growing exponentially in 2% raffinose plus 0.05% glucose were pulsed with either 0.4 m NaCl (final concentration), 2% glucose (final concentration) or a combination of 0.4 m NaCl and 2% glucose (final concentration). At times 0 and 60 min, aliquots were taken from the cultures, and the β-galactosidase activity was assayed in permeabilized cells and expressed in Miller units as in Ref. 29Ludin K. Jiang R. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6245-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar. Values are means from three to four independent transformants (S.D. < 15% in all cases). TUP1-deficient strains flocculate and, thus, β-galactosidase activity was assayed in yeast extracts as in a previous study (30Sanz P. Alms G.R. Haystead T.A. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1321-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and expressed in Miller units/mg of protein. Invertase activity was assayed in whole cells as described in a previous study (31Goldstein A. Lampen J.O. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 42: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis—Preparation of protein extracts was essentially performed as described (30Sanz P. Alms G.R. Haystead T.A. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1321-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The extraction buffer was 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF and contained 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (Cell Signaling Technology) polyclonal antibodies were used to follow Hog1 phosphorylation. Isolation of HXT1-LacZ Reporter Repressors—LC91 (MATa ura3 leu2 trp1 his3 rgt1::KAN YIp358R HXT1-URA3) and LC99 (MATα ura3 leu2 his3 rgt1::KAN YIp368R-HXT1-LEU2) were mutagenized with N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) as described in a previous study (32Posas F. Witten E.A. Saito H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5788-5796Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in YPD (yeast extract, peptone, dextrose) at 30 °C to A600 of 0.3, washed in Tris-maleate buffer (pH 6.0), and resuspended in 1/5 of the original volume in the same washing buffer. Then, cells were incubated with a solution of 30 μg/ml MNNG in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) for 60 min at 30 °C. After washes with 1% sodium thiosulfate, cells were grown in YPD, at 30 °C for 4 h. Mutagenized cells were plated on minimal medium plates containing X-gal (∼1000 colonies/plate). After incubating at 30 °C for 4 days, positive clones were isolated. Mutant cells were then classified into complementation groups. Three mutants that represented the larger complementation groups were transformed with a yeast YCp50-genomic library. Positive clones were selected by their ability to block HXT1 expression. Plasmids that complemented the corresponding mutations were isolated and sequenced. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitation PCR assays were performed as described previously (14Alepuz P.M. Jovanovic A. Reiser V. Ammerer G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 767-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In all ChIP experiments, yeast cultures were grown in raffinose to early log phase (A600 0.6–1.0) before cells were exposed to 2% glucose or osmotic stress. The HOG Pathway Regulates HXT1 Gene Expression by Glucose and Osmostress—Expression of the HXT1 low affinity glucose transporter is regulated by glucose availability, being inhibited when glucose levels are scarce and activated in the presence of the sugar (see Ref. 3Ozcan S. Johnston M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 554-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for review). As shown in Fig. 1, cells growing exponentially in 2% raffinose showed very low levels of HXT1 expression (measured as a transcriptional fusion of the HXT1 promoter to the lacZ gene, encoding β-galactosidase enzyme; see “Experimental Procedures”). After a pulse of 2% glucose, expression of HXT1 was induced, in agreement with what it has been reported previously (see Ref. 3Ozcan S. Johnston M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 554-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for review). However, HXT1 induction rate was higher when cells were subjected simultaneously to 2% glucose plus 0.4 m NaCl (Fig. 1). Similar results were obtained when 1 m sorbitol was used instead of NaCl (data not shown). These results were in agreement with data from microarray analyses that indicated that HXT1 expression was enhanced after treatment with 0.4 m NaCl (33Posas F. Chambers J.R. Heyman J.A. Hoeffler J.P. de Nadal E. Arino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17249-17255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), 1 m NaCl (34Yale J. Bohnert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15996-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), or 1 m sorbitol (35Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3763) Google Scholar) in the presence of glucose. It is worth noting that no induction of HXT1 expression was observed if cells were subjected only to osmotic stress in the absence of glucose (Fig. 1). To determine if the HOG pathway was responsible for over-induction of HXT1 expression in response to glucose plus osmotic stress, we analyzed HXT1-lacZ expression in a hog1Δ mutant strain (Fig. 1). To our surprise, HXT1 expression was not induced even by glucose alone, indicating that the Hog1 protein kinase was required not only to overinduce HXT1 expression by glucose plus osmostress but also to regulate HXT1 expression by glucose. The absence of induction by glucose in a hog1Δ mutant was not due to a delay in the rate of induction, because when cells were grown overnight in 2% glucose, hog1Δ mutant cells still showed very reduced levels of HXT1 expression in comparison to wild type cells (data not shown). A recovery in the induction of HXT1 by glucose was obtained if hog1Δ mutants were transformed with a plasmid carrying a wild type Hog1 kinase, but not with a plasmid with a catalytically inactive form (Hog1KS-KN) (data not shown), indicating that the activity of the Hog1 kinase was necessary to allow induction of HXT1 expression by glucose. In contrast to HXT1, expression of HXT2, encoding an intermediate-affinity glucose transporter that is repressed by glucose, was not affected in a hog1Δ strain (data not shown), indicating that the action of Hog1 was specific on HXT1 expression. Snf1 protein kinase activity affects negatively HXT1 expression (11Tomas-Cobos L. Sanz P. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that the absence of Hog1 kinase could stimulate the activity of the Snf1 kinase and then inhibit HXT1 expression, we studied the activity of Snf1 protein kinase in a hog1Δ mutant by analyzing the regulation of the expression of SUC2 (a glucose repressed gene) and found that it was similar to wild type (Table II). More importantly, induction of HXT1 expression by glucose in a double hog1Δsnf1Δ mutant was similar to the hog1Δ mutant (Table II). These results indicated that the defect in the induction of HXT1 by glucose in hog1Δ cells was not related to the activation of Snf1 protein kinase and that the Hog1 MAPK played a crucial role in the regulation of HXT1 induction by glucose.Table IISnf1 protein kinase is not activated in a hog1Δ mutantStrain(HXT1-lacZ) β-galactosidase(SUC2) invertaseunitsWild type100.4<1snf1Δ114.8<1hog1Δ10.4<1snf1Δ hog1Δ13.2<1 Open table in a new tab Osmostress Caused by Extracellular Glucose Results in Hog1 Activation and Induction of HXT1 Gene Expression—To analyze whether only the Hog1 MAPK or the integrity of the HOG pathway was needed for the induction of HXT1 by glucose, we followed HXT1 expression in mutants on several components of the HOG pathway. As shown in Fig. 2A, deletion of the PBS2 MAPK kinase or simultaneous deletion of the three MAPK kinase kinases of the HOG pathway, STE11, SSK2, and SSK22, abolished induction of HXT1 by glucose. Thus, the integrity of the main core of the HOG pathway is required for HXT1 induction by glucose. Two upstream sensing mechanisms activate the core of the HOG pathway, the Sln1 “two-component” osmosensor and a second mechanism that involves the Sho1 transmembrane protein (36de Nadal E. Alepuz P.M. Posas F. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Mutations in the Sho1 branch (double sho1Δste11Δ mutant) did not alter HXT1 expression (Fig. 2A). However, mutants in the Sln1 branch of the HOG pathway (ssk2Δssk22Δ or ssk1Δ (data not shown)) showed a clear defect in the induction of HXT1 by glucose (Fig. 2A). It is worth noting that, on the later strains, induction of HXT1 was similar to wild type only when both glucose and NaCl were added (Fig. 2A). These results indicate that induction of HXT1 expression by glucose is mediated by the Sln1 branch of the HOG pathway. Activation of the Hog1 MAPK by phosphorylation has been described to occur in response to osmostress (see the introduction). To test whether glucose “per se” or the osmotic stress caused by the addition of 2% glucose to the medium was responsible for Hog1 activation, we followed Hog1 phosphorylation in response to the addition of sugar. As shown in Fig. 2B, addition of 2% (110 mm) glucose or 2% galactose to raffinose growing cells induced Hog1 phosphorylation to the same extend as treatment with 110 mm NaCl. Moreover, addition of higher concentrations of glucose or galactose led to higher levels of Hog1 phosphorylation (data not shown). As expected, phosphorylation of Hog1 by sugar occurred in wild type cells but not in pbs2Δ cells (Fig. 2B). Time course experiments showed that phosphorylation of Hog1 by glucose was transient (Fig. 2C), as it has been described for NaCl (13Hohmann S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 300-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). Thus, Hog1 activation is caused by an increase in extracellular osmolarity caused by the addition of sugar, not necessarily restricted to glucose. Because the presence of glucose was always necessary to stimulate HXT1 expression and because in the absence of an active HOG pathway no induction of HXT1 was observed (Figs. 1 and 2), we suggest the possibility that the addition of 2% glucose to raffinose growing cells would elicit two different signals, one that would be transmitted through the glucose induction pathway (see below) and another, where glucose would act as an osmolite that would activate the Sln1 branch of the HOG pathway, more sensitive to osmotic changes in the environment (13Hohmann S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 300-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). Induction of HXT1 Expression upon Glucose Plus Osmotic Stress Depends on the Integrity of the Glucose Signaling Pathway—Induction of HXT1 by glucose depends on the glucose signaling pathway (3Ozcan S. Johnston M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 554-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Then, we wanted to test whether integrity of the glucose signaling pathway was required to allow overinduction HXT1 in response to glucose plus osmostress. Inactivation of the membrane glucose sensors Snf3 and Rgt2, and the SCF-Grr1 ubiquitination complex abolished HXT1 expression by both glucose and osmostress (Fig. 3A). In contrast, deletion of the MTH1 and STD1 genes, known regulators of Rgt1 transcriptional repressor (8Lakshmanan J. Mosley A.L. Ozcan S. Curr. Genet. 2003; 44: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), resulted in constitutive expression of HXT1. However, in the double std1Δmth1Δ mutant, osmostress but not glucose, was able to induce HXT1 expression at even higher levels in a Hog1-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Thus, integrity of the main core of the glucose signaling pathway (Snf3/Rgt2 and SCF-Grr1) is essential to allow over-induction of HXT1 in response to glucose plus osmostress. If repressing properties of Rgt1 are avoided (std1Δmth1Δ mutants), then the HOG pathway may overinduce HXT1 expression in response to osmostress. Deletion of RGT1 repressor resulted in a mild deregulation of HXT1 expression in absence of glucose and no further induction by glucose (Ref. 3Ozcan S. Johnston M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 554-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 3B). In contrast, a clear induction of HXT1 expression was observed by NaCl alone or by glucose plus NaCl (Fig. 3B). These effects were dependent on the presence of Hog1 kinase, because in the double rgt1Δhog1Δ mutant no induction of HXT1 was observed under any condition (Fig. 3B). Thus, in the absence of the Rgt1 transcriptional repressor, activation of the HOG pathway by osmostress leads to full HXT1 induction, even in the absence of glucose. An alternative explanation for the results presented so far was that the function of Rgt1 could be regulated directly by the Hog1 kinase. However, this was unlikely, because when we tested the transcriptional properties of a LexA-Rgt1 fusion, these were similar in both wild type and hog1Δ mutant (Table III).Table IIITransactivating properties of Rgt1 are not affected in a hog1Δ mutant(6lexAop-lacZ) β-galactosidaseLexALexA-Rgt1unitsWild type<11940hog1Δ<12133 Open table in a new tab Regulation of HXT1 Expression by the HOG and Glucose Signaling Pathways Is Exerted at Different Sites on the HXT1 Promoter—As shown above, induction of HXT1 by glucose and osmostress requires the activation of two independent signaling pathways, glucose induction and HOG pathways. To identify sequences in the upstream control region of HXT1 that are important for regulation by any of these pathways, we investigated the expression of a set of segments of the HXT1 promoter fused to the lacZ gene, in cells growing in raffinose and then pulsed with glucose, NaCl, or glucose plus NaCl, as above (Fig. 4). Insertion of a fragment of ∼200 bp (from –223 to ATG) to the YIp358R reporter vector gave high levels of β-galactosidase activity in any of the conditions tested, whereas insertion of larger fragments (–1200 to ATG or –821 to ATG) resulted in strong repression under basal conditions (raffinose-growing cells) and strong induction in response to glucose or to glucose plus NaCl (Fig. 4B). These results indicated that regulation of HXT1 expression consists mainly of a derepression process. Because we observed a similar derepression pattern when we assayed a fragment containing from –821 to ATG in comparison to full-length HXT1 promoter (from –1200 to ATG), we sugges"

It is cleared from nucleoli following exposure to drugs stabilizing covalent DNA intermediates of the enzyme (e.g. camptothecin) or inhibiting RNA polymerases (e.g. actinomycin D), an effect summarily attributed to blockade of rDNA transcription. Here we show that two distinct mechanisms are at work: (i) Both drugs induce inactivation and segregation of the rRNA transcription machinery. With actinomycin D this leads to a co-migration of RNA-polymerase I and topoisomerase I to the nucleolar perimeter. The process has a slow onset (>20 min), is independent of topoisomerase I activity, but requires the N-terminal domain of the enzyme to colocalize with RNA polymerase I. (ii) Camptothecin induces, in addition, immobilization of active topoisomerase I on genomic DNA resulting in rapid nucleolar clearance and spreading of the enzyme to the entire nucleoplasm. This effect is independent of the state of rRNA transcription, involves segregation of topoisomerase I from RNA polymerase I, has a rapid onset (<1 min), and requires catalytic activity but neither the N-terminal domain of topoisomerase I nor its major sumoylation site.

Thus, nucleolar/nucleoplasmic partitioning of topoisomerase I is regulated by interactions with RNA polymerase I and DNA but not by sumoylation. The mechanism that distributes DNA-topoisomerase I (topo I) 1The abbreviations used are: topo I, topoisomerase I; ActD, actinomycin D; CPT, camptothecin; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; GFP, green fluorescent protein; rDNA, ribosomal DNA; SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin. between nucleoli and nucleoplasm has been a controversial issue over a decade. Topoisomerase I catalyzes topological changes in the DNA by cutting one strand of the double helix and allowing rotation of the other (1Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2192) Google Scholar). This mechanism releases torsion stress in DNA double helices that is created by e.g. RNA synthesis. Thus, topo I is a crucial cofactor for the transcription of nucleoplasmic genes (2Stewart A.F. Schutz G. Cell. 1987; 50: 1109-1117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and rDNA (3Muller M.T. Pfund W.P. Mehta V.B. Trask D.K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1237-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 4Zhang H. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1060-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The latter task seems to dominate, because topo I is concentrated in the nucleoli, and, of the three nucleolar components, it is preferentially found in the fibrillar centers, a restriction in localization that is lost when the N-terminal domain of the enzyme or parts of it are lacking (5Christensen M.O. Barthelmes H.U. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35932-35938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Topoisomerase I is thus placed in the vicinity of rDNA, RNA polymerase I, and rDNA transcription, which are also restricted to the fibrillar centers of the nucleolus (6Cheutin T. O'Donohue M.F. Beorchia A. Vandelaer M. Kaplan H. Defever B. Ploton D. Thiry M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3297-3307PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleolar positioning of topo I is highly susceptible to exogenous perturbation. The enzyme is lost from fibrillar centers, when cells are cultured at an inappropriate temperature (5Christensen M.O. Barthelmes H.U. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35932-35938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It is also lost from nucleoli in response to camptothecin and related compounds that inhibit the religation step of the DNA cleavage-religation mechanism and thus stabilize the enzyme in covalent DNA intermediates (7Danks M.K. Garrett K.E. Marion R.C. Whipple D.O. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1664-1673PubMed Google Scholar, 8Buckwalter C.A. Lin A.H. Tanizawa A. Pommier Y.G. Cheng Y.C. Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1674-1681PubMed Google Scholar). Because such compounds also inhibit RNA synthesis (9Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 1129-1136PubMed Google Scholar) and because direct inhibitors of RNA polymerase I such as actinomycin D (10Perry R.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1963; 29: 400-406Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar) also remove topo I from the nucleoli, it has been proposed that the same cellular mechanism (i.e. loss of rRNA synthesis) is responsible for nucleolar clearance of topo I in response to both types of inhibitors (8Buckwalter C.A. Lin A.H. Tanizawa A. Pommier Y.G. Cheng Y.C. Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1674-1681PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mao Y. Mehl I.R. Muller M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1235-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This implies ongoing rDNA transcription to be crucial for the positioning of the enzyme in the nucleolus. Recently, we have put forward an alternative hypothesis formed on the basis of our finding that topo I is very mobile in a living cell. It roams the entire nuclear space and exchanges rapidly between nuclear compartments. Camptothecin reduces the mobility of topo I by more than 10-fold. Moreover, it acts preferentially on topo I in the nucleoplasm, where the enzyme is normally more mobile than in the nucleoli. Thus, partitioning of topo I between nucleoli and nucleoplasm seems in general governed by mobility gradients within the cell nucleus, with nucleolar accumulation reflecting the enzyme's lesser mobility in the nucleoli, and relocation to the nucleoplasm in response to camptothecin reflecting attenuation of the enzyme at nucleoplasmic sites, where it is actively processing genomic DNA (12Christensen M.O. Barthelmes H.U. Feineis S. Knudsen B.R. Andersen A.H. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15661-15665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, this simple explanation was disputed, because camptothecin also stimulates modification of topo I with small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO) (13Mao Y. Sun M. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4046-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and mutational silencing of the major target site of topo I for this modification (K103R,K117R,K153R) enhances nucleolar accumulation of the enzyme and abolishes its nucleolar clearance in response to camptothecin (14Rallabhandi P. Hashimoto K. Mo Y.Y. Beck W.T. Moitra P.K. D'Arpa P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40020-40026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This has been interpreted as an indication of an active and directed transport of topo I between nucleoli and nucleoplasm that is triggered by the attachment of SUMO to (sumoylation of) the enzyme. Another study suggested moreover, that a N-terminal fragment of topo I is fully capable of undergoing nucleolar clearance in response to camptothecin despite being catalytically inactive (11Mao Y. Mehl I.R. Muller M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1235-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which entirely contradicts our concept of catalytic enzyme-DNA interactions playing a role in this process. In summary, three mechanisms have been proposed for the partitioning of topo I between nucleoli an nucleoplasm: (i) (dis-)attachment to/from nucleolar sites of rDNA transcription, (ii) differences in enzyme mobility that are linked to DNA-catalysis, and (iii) a directed nucleolar import/export mechanism controlled by sumoylation of the enzyme. To determine which of these mechanisms is most appropriate, we have investigated here the nucleolar/nucleoplasmic partitioning of various biofluorescent topo I constructs that are active or not, and that contain the major sumoylation site or not. Moreover, we have compared the impact of the topo I poison camptothecin and the RNA polymerase inhibitor actinomycin D on the localization of these constructs. Constructs and Cell Culture—Construction and characterization of cell lines supporting stable expression of GFP-topo I, GFP-topo IPhe-723, GFP-topo I190–765, and GFP-topo I1–215 has been documented in previous studies (5Christensen M.O.

Silencing of the major sumoylation sites of topo I (14Rallabhandi P. Hashimoto K. Mo Y.Y. Beck W.T. Moitra P.K. D'Arpa P. J. Biol.

The active site mutant (GFP-TIPhe-723) was modified to express triple K103R,K117R,K153R point mutations by replacing a 3′-terminal restriction fragment of the topo I reading frame with the corresponding fragment of GFP-TIK103R,K117R,K153R, thereby generating GFP-TIPhe-723,K103R,K117R,K153R. To fuse GFP to the C terminus of the N-terminal domain of topo I as described previously (16Mao Y. Okada S. Chang L.S. Muller M.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4538-4543PubMed Google Scholar), the N-terminal topo I fragment (TI1–215) was inserted into the vector pMC-EGFPP (17Christensen M.O. Larsen M.K. Barthelmes H.U. Hock R.

All new constructs were checked by DNA sequencing and stably expressed in the human embryonal kidney cell line HEK 293 (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Culture, Braunschweig, Germany) as described previously (5Christensen M.O.

Like in these previous studies, we have ascertained that all constructs are not overexpressed in relation to endogenous topo I, that the chimeric genes are not rearranged, and that green fluorescence of the cells could be unambiguously assigned to constitutive expression of the intended proteins. For inhibition of RNA polymerase I transcription, cells were incubated with 0.05 μg ml–1 actinomycin D. For induction of topo I cleavage complexes, cells were incubated with 20 μm camptothecin. Immunoblotting of Topoisomerase I—Cells in suspension were cultured in the absence or presence of 20 μm camptothecin for 20 min at 37 °C. For the detection of SUMO conjugates, cells were subjected to alkaline lysis and nuclease digestion as described (18Desai S.D. Li T.K. Rodriguez-Bauman A. Rubin E.H. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5926-5932PubMed Google Scholar, 19Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Vazquez-Abad D. D'Arpa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24159-24164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). For band depletion assays, whole cell lysates were prepared by adding an equal volume of 2-fold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 8 m urea, 20% glycerol, 0.04% bromphenol blue, 10 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg ml–1 aprotinin, 10 μg ml–1 pepstatin A). Material equivalent to 5 × 105 cells was then applied to each slot of an SDS-gel (9% (Fig. 1B) or 5.5% polyacrylamide (Fig. 2, A and B)). After electrophoresis, proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore, Bedford, MD). The membranes were subsequently blocked with PBS containing 2% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20, and then incubated for 1 h with mouse monoclonal antibodies against GFP (Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany) diluted with the same buffer. After washing, the filters were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG diluted with PBS containing 2% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20. Following extensive washing with the same buffer, labeled protein bands were visualized with the ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany).Fig. 2Topoisomerase I localization is not affected by mutational silencing of the major sumoylation sites.A, camptothecin-induced nucleolar de-localization of catalytic active topo I. Epifluorescent images of living cells expressing GFP chimera of full-length human topo I (GFP-TopoI) and point mutants of the major sumoylation sites K117R (GFP-TIK117R), K103R,K117R (GFP-TIK103R,K117R), and K103R,K117R, K153R (GFP-TIK103R,K117R,K153R) were acquired before (middle left) and after (middle right) exposure to camptothecin (20 μm CPT, 5 min). Corresponding phase contrast images are shown on the left. Camptothecin-induced sumoylation of GFP-topo I was assessed by GFP-directed immunoblotting (right). Cells untreated (lane 1) or treated with camptothecin (20 μm CPT, 20 min) (lanes 2 and 3) were subjected to alkaline lysis and then neutralized. In lane 3, samples were incubated in addition with Staphylococcus nuclease S7 to release topo I from covalent DNA-linkage. Unmodified GFP-topo I is marked by arrows and sumoylated enzyme moieties are marked by asterisks. B, sumoylation has no effect on the nuclear distribution of catalytic inactive topo I. Cells expressing GFP-chimera of wildtype topo I (GFP-TopoI), the active site mutant (GFP-TIPhe-723), or the active site mutant also bearing a triple-point mutation of the three major sumoylation sites (GFP-TIPhe-723,K103R,K117R,K153R) were cultured under the microscope, and phase contrast images (top) and images of corresponding green fluorescence (middle) were recorded. Sumoylation (bottom) was assessed as in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Life Cell Imaging—For confocal imaging and fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we used a Zeiss LSM 510 inverted confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a CO2-controlled on-stage heating chamber and a heated 63×/1.4 numerical aperture oil-immersion objective. Culturing of cells at 37 °C under the microscope was crucial for obtaining consistent data of localization and mobility of topo I, whereas erratic results were obtained, when native cell specimen were analyzed at ambient temperature (5Christensen M.O. Barthelmes H.U. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35932-35938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For FRAP measurements, fluorescent images of a single optical section were taken at 1.6-s time intervals before (n = 5) and after bleaching of a circular area at 20-milliwatt nominal laser power with three iterations. Imaging scans were acquired with the laser power attenuated to 0.1–1% of the bleaching intensity. For quantitative analysis of FRAP, fluorescence intensities of the bleached region and the entire cell nucleus were measured at each time point. Data were corrected for extracellular background intensity and for the overall loss in total intensity as a result of the bleach pulse itself and of the imaging scans. The relative intensity of the bleached area, Irel, was calculated according to a previous study (20Phair R.D. Misteli T. Nature. 2000; 404: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). For epifluorescence imaging of living cells at 37 °C, we used a Zeiss Axiovert 100 inverted microscope equipped with an on-stage heating chamber (ΔTC3 from Bioptechs, Butler, PA), a heated 63×/1.4 numerical aperture oil-immersion objective system, a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Sensys, Photometrics Ltd., München, Germany), and an additional 4-fold magnification lens. Immunohistochemistry—For immunostaining of RNA polymerase I, cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated microscopic glass slides, permeabilized with 0.07% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 s at 37 °C, and then fixed with PBS containing 2% Paraformaldehyde (15 min, 4 °C). All subsequent steps were carried out at ambient temperature. After washing with PBS, the cell samples were blocked for 1 h with PBS supplemented with 2% BSA and 5% goat serum. To stain RNA polymerase I, the cell samples were then incubated for 1 h with human autoimmune serum S18 (21Reimer G. Rose K.M. Scheer U. Tan E.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) diluted 1:800 in PBS. After washing with PBS, bound antibodies were visualized by incubation for 1 h with Cy3™-conjugated goat anti-human F(ab′)2 fragments (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) diluted 1:1000 in PBS. Characteristics of the Experimental Setup—The topo I constructs outlined in Fig. 1A were constitutively expressed as N-terminal GFP fusions in human 293 cells (5Christensen M.O. Barthelmes H.U. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35932-35938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Christensen M.O. Barthelmes H.U. Feineis S. Knudsen B.R. Andersen A.H. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15661-15665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To determine the catalytic activity of the constructs in the cell, we assessed camptothecin-inducible immunoband depletion (22Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 351-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1920) Google Scholar). Before immunoblotting, cells were treated with camptothecin, which stabilizes covalent topo I·DNA intermediates. Because these intermediates are too large to enter the gel, the active fraction of the enzyme becomes depleted from the blot. As summarized in Fig. 1B, full-length topo I (GFP-topo I) became efficiently depleted (compare lanes 1 and 2), as did topo I lacking the first 190 amino acids (GFP-TI190–765, lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, the active site mutant (GFP-TIPhe-723, lanes 3 and 4) and the N-terminal domain alone (GFP-TI1–215, lanes 7 and 8) were not depleted. Using these constructs, we were thus able to compare the cellular behavior of the full-length human enzyme (GFP-topo I), retaining the major sumoylation site (Fig. 1A, black box) and being catalytically active in the cell, with two constructs also retaining the major sumoylation site but not being active in the cell (GFP-TIPhe-723 and GFP-TI1–215), and with a construct being active in the cell but lacking the major sumoylation site (GFP-TI190–765). Camptothecin-induced Nucleolar Depletion of Topoisomerase I Depends on Catalytic Activity but Not on the N-terminal Domain of the Enzyme—Fig. 1C shows from top to bottom representative fluorescence images of cells expressing GFP-topo I, GFP-TIPhe-723, GFP-TI190–765, or GFP-TI1–215 and their response to camptothecin treatment. The cells were cultured under the confocal microscope during observation. Each row shows the same cell, which was first imaged by transmitted light (left) and confocal sectioning of GFP-fluorescence at mid plane (middle). Then, cell culture was maintained for 5 min in the presence of 20 μm camptothecin, and the same cell was visualized again by confocal sectioning of green fluorescence (right). It can be seen that, in the absence of camptothecin, constructs GFP-topo I, GFP-TI190–765, and GFP-TI1–215 all accumulated in the nucleoli, whereas GFP-TIPhe-723 showed a more equal partitioning between nucleoli and nucleoplasm, which has previously been attributed to a lesser mobility of the mutant in the nucleoplasm (12Christensen M.O. Barthelmes H.U. Feineis S. Knudsen B.R. Andersen A.H. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15661-15665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As that may be, Fig. 1C clearly shows that nucleolar/nucleoplasmic partitioning of topo I is independent of catalytic activity, because GFP-TI1–215 (inactive) and GFP-TI190–765 (active) both accumulated in the nucleoli in the same fashion as full-length topo I (GFP-topo I). As previously described (5Christensen M.O. Barthelmes H.U. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35932-35938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and also notable here in Fig. 1C, GFP-topo I and GFP-TI1–215 accumulate at the fibrillar centers of the nucleolus, whereas GFP-TI190–765 exhibits a more homogeneous nucleolar pattern. Fig. 1C demonstrates also that the construct lacking most of the N-terminal domain (GFP-TI190–765) was cleared from the nucleoli in response to camptothecin to the same extent as full-length topo I (GFP-topo I), whereas the catalytically inactive constructs GFP-TIPhe-723 and GFP-TI1–215 were both not cleared from the nucleoli. Thus, nucleolar clearance of topo I in response to camptothecin seems to occur irrespective of the presence of the first 190 amino acids, whereas it clearly requires catalytic activity. Silencing of the Major Sumoylation Sites Neither Affects Nucleolar Localization of topo I nor Its Nucleolar Depletion in Response to Camptothecin—The results shown in Fig. 1C indicate catalytic activity as the sole determinant of nucleolar depletion of topo I in response to camptothecin, which is in clear contrast to previous observations by others suggesting sumoylation of lysine residues 103, 117, and 153 to play a crucial role in this process (14Rallabhandi P. Hashimoto K. Mo Y.Y. Beck W.T. Moitra P.K. D'Arpa P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40020-40026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This contradiction could be due to the fact that we have investigated here huge truncations of topo I, whereas the conflicting data were obtained by silencing just the relevant sumoylation sites in the full-length enzyme by point mutations. To exclude such truncation artifacts, we have repeated the experiments with cell lines stably expressing GFP fusions of full-length topo I, in which one (GFP-TIK117R), two (GFP-TIK103R,K117R), or all three major sumoylation sites (GFP-TIK103R,K117R,K153R) described previously (14Rallabhandi P. Hashimoto K. Mo Y.Y. Beck W.T. Moitra P.K. D'Arpa P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40020-40026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) were silenced by point mutations. Fig. 2A shows images of these cells cultured at 37 °C under the microscope during observation. GFP fluorescence of the same set of cells is shown before (0′-CPT) and after culturing for 5 min in the presence of 20 μm camptothecin (5′-CPT). In the absence of camptothecin, all constructs accumulated in the nucleoli and concentrated at the nucleolar fibrillar centers, irrespective of the point mutations silencing the sumoylation sites (Fig. 2A, middle left column). It should also be noted that silencing the sumoylation sites did not disrupt binding of the enzyme to the nucleoli organizer regions of the akrocentric chromosomes during mitosis (data not shown). Thus, modification of topo I at the three major sumoylation sites seems not to affect topo I localization in the absence of camptothecin. Most notably, we found that GFP-TIK117R, GFP-TIK103R,K117R, and GFP-TIK103R,K117R,K153R were cleared from nucleoli upon exposure to camptothecin in the same fashion as the nonmutated enzyme GFP-topo I (Fig. 2A, middle right column). In keeping with the data obtained with the deletion mutant GFP-TI190–765 (Fig. 1C), these observations suggest that sumoylation at the three major acceptor sites does not play a role in nucleolar depletion of topoisomerase I in response to camptothecin. To demonstrate that GFP-topo I becomes indeed sumoylated in response to camptothecin in the cell line used in this study and that sumoylation is abolished by silencing the major acceptor sites, we subjected the cells to alkaline lysis followed by GFP-directed immunoblotting (Fig. 2A, right column). All constructs were catalytic active, as evidenced by depletion of the GFP-linked topo I (compare lanes 1 and 2). S7 nuclease treatment of the neutralized cell lysate released a ladder of evenly spaced, slower migrating SUMO conjugates of GFP-topo I (right column, top, lane 3, asterisks). The incidence of SUMO conjugates was drastically reduced by silencing of Lys-117 (compare lanes 3 in top and middle top panel), and it was completely abolished by silencing of two or all three major sumoylation sites (lanes 3 in middle bottom and bottom panel). Thus, we ascertained in the cell line employed in this study that GFP-topo I is sumoylated in response to camptothecin and that sumoylation is abolished by mutational silencing of the major sumoylation target sites described previously (14Rallabhandi P. Hashimoto K. Mo Y.Y. Beck W.T. Moitra P.K. D'Arpa P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40020-40026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Horie K. Tomida A. Sugimoto Y. Yasugi T. Yoshikawa H. Taketani Y. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7913-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that the active site mutant topo IPhe-723 is permanently sumoylated in a camptothecin-independent manner (23Horie K. Tomida A. Sugimoto Y. Yasugi T. Yoshikawa H. Taketani Y. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7913-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To test whether this accounts for its aberrant nuclear/nucleolar partitioning (Fig. 1C and Ref. 12Christensen M.O. Barthelmes H.U. Feineis S. Knudsen B.R. Andersen A.H. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15661-15665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we silenced the three major sumoylation sites in addition to the active site. The resulting quadruple mutant GFP-TIPhe-723,K103R,K117R,K153R was not sumoylated (Fig. 2B, bottom right), as opposed to the active site mutant GFP-TIPhe-723, which exhibited the expected, camptothecin-independent type of sumoylation (Fig. 2B, bottom middle). Thus, silencing of the major sumoylation sites does not restore proper nucleolar positioning to the active site mutant of topo I (compare right and middle images in the top section of Fig. 2B), and its aberrant nuclear/nucleolar partitioning cannot be attributed to constitutive sumoylation at these sites. In summary, the data in Fig. 2 rule out that sumoylation of amino acids Lys-103, Lys-117, and Lys-153 of topo I determines the partitioning of the enzyme between nucleoli and nucleoplasm or triggers its nucleolar clearance in response to camptothecin. On the contrary, these data suggest that sumoylation and nucleolar clearance of topo I occur independent of each other, although both effects are induced by camptothecin. Actinomycin D-induced Nucleolar Relocation of Topoisomerase I Requires the N-terminal Domain of the Enzyme but Not Its Catalytic Activity—To determine the role of ongoing rDNA transcription in the nuclear positioning of topo I, we monitored cells expressing GFP-topo I, GFP-TIPhe-723, GFP-TI190–765, or GFP-TI1–215 under a confocal laser scanning microscope, added actinomycin D to the culture medium at concentrations sufficient to completely arrest rDNA transcription (10Perry R.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1963; 29: 400-406Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and took serial confocal scans every 20 min (Fig. 3A). The first column shows full-length topo I (GFP-topo I). The topmost image (0′-ActD) was recorded immediately before adding actinomycin D. It shows the normal nucleolar localization of the enzyme, which remained largely unaltered during the first 20 min of exposure to the drug (compare 0′-ActD with 20′-ActD). Ho"

In this study, the checkpoint clamp is designated as Rad17/3/1 and the clamp loader is designated as RFC-Rad24. DNA-independent interactions of the checkpoint clamp loader with its clamp have been studied. Rad17/3/1 and RFC-Rad24 interact in the absence of DNA (6Shiomi Y. Shinozaki A. Nakada D. Sugimoto K. Usukura J. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 9Bermudez V.P. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Cesare A.J. Maniwa Y. Griffith J.D. Hurwitz J. Sancar A.

A. 2003; 100: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). As previously observed with PCNA and RFC, the formation of a stable Rad17/3/1·RFC-Rad24 complex was strongly enhanced by ATP binding but did not require its hydrolysis (12Gerik K.J. Gary S.L. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1256-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Loading of the Rad17/3/1 clamp around partial duplex DNA can be mediated by either ATP or ATPγS; however, ATP hydrolysis was required to release the clamp from the clamp loader and permit sliding of Rad17/3/1 across double-stranded DNA (8Ellison V. Stillman B. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: 231-243Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 10Majka J. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The nature of the DNA substrate for this system has been a matter of discrepancy. We determined that yeast Rad17/3/1 is loaded onto partial duplex DNA with either 5′- or 3′-recessed termini and can even be loaded onto double-stranded DNA ends (10Majka J. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, loading on a normal template-primer substrate, i.e. with a 3′-recessed terminus, was most efficient. The human 9/1/1 clamp could be loaded onto DNA nicks as well as gapped DNA (9Bermudez V.P. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Cesare A.J. Maniwa Y. Griffith J.D. Hurwitz J. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1633-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In one study, a decided preference for 5′-recessed termini was measured (8Ellison V. Stillman B. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: 231-243Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar), whereas the opposite preference was determined in another study (7Zou L. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13827-13832Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In vivo, the single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA is essential for recruitment of Rad17/3/1 to sites of DNA damage (7Zou L. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13827-13832Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In vitro, RPA was also required for efficient loading of the checkpoint clamp in some but not in other studies (7Zou L. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13827-13832Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 8Ellison V. Stillman B. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: 231-243Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 9Bermudez V.P. Lindsey-Boltz L.A.

Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The RPA dependence for clamp loading may be a reflection of the presence of extended single-stranded DNA regions in the substrate DNA. DNA substrates with very small gaps or nicks served as excellent loading templates in the absence of RPA (9Bermudez V.P. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Cesare A.J. Maniwa Y. Griffith J.D. Hurwitz J. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1633-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 10Majka J. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), whereas substrates with more extended regions of single-stranded DNA required RPA for loading (7Zou L. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13827-13832Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have investigated the role of ATP in the checkpoint clamp-clamp loader system. Previous studies with RFC and PCNA have shown that the ATP-binding domains in Rfc2, Rfc3, and Rfc4 are both essential and sufficient for clamp loading. In contrast, the ATP-binding domain in Rfc1 is dispensable for clamp loading in vitro and rfc1-K359E mutants (with a mutation in the conserved lysine of the Walker A motif) show virtually no defects in vivo (13Schmidt S.L. Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34784-34791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 14Schmidt S.L. Pautz A.L. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34792-34800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the analogous lysine → glutamic acid mutation in the RAD24 gene results in a complete loss of function phenotype for the DNA damage checkpoint (15Naiki T. Shimomura T. Kondo T. Matsumoto K. Sugimoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We have determined that ATP binding to Rad24 is essential for complex formation with the Rad17/3/1 clamp and the observed in vivo that defect can be directly interpreted as a failure to load the clamp. Plasmids and DNA—All plasmids for overexpression of wild-type RFC-Rad24 and Rad17/3/1 have been described previously (10Majka J. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Plasmid pBL766-E (2 μm ori URA3 GST-rad24-K115E) containing rad24-K115E was made by swapping a restriction fragment containing the mutation from plasmid YlpT-Rad24-K115E (a gift of Dr. Ken Sugimoto) into pBL766 (15Naiki T. Shimomura T. Kondo T. Matsumoto K. Sugimoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Plasmids pBL422-4R (2 μm ori URA3 RFC2 RFC3 rfc4-K55R RFC5) and pBL422-4E (2 μm ori URA3 RFC2 RFC3 rfc4-K55E RFC5) were made by swapping in appropriate restriction fragments from pBL410-R and pBL410-E, respectively (13Schmidt S.L. Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34784-34791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 14Schmidt S.L. Pautz A.L. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34792-34800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For each plasmid, the region that had undergone restriction fragment swapping was completely sequenced to confirm that only the intended mutations were introduced. The oligonucleotides used in the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis and ATPase assays were A9 (5′-ccagtgaattcgagctcggtacccgctagcggggatcctcta-3′) and complementary oligonucleotides 5′-20 (5′-accgagctcgaattcactgg-3′) and 3′-20 (5′-tagaggatccccgctagcgg-3′). For attachment to SPR chips, the A9 oligonucleotide was biotinylated either at the 3′ or 5′ terminus and attached to streptavidin-coated chips (see below). Expression and Purification of RFC-Rad24 Protein Complexes—For overproduction of RFC-Rad24K115E, S. cerevisiae strain BJ2168 (MATa:ura3–52, trp1–289, leu2–3,112, prb1–1122, prc1–407, pep4–3) was used. Yeast cells were co-transformed with plasmids pBL766-E and pBL422 and grown and induced in a 35-liter fermentor by using conditions and media described previously (10Majka J. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). After a 3-h induction with galactose, methylmethane sulfonate was added to a final concentration of 0.01% followed by a further 2 h of growth. As a host for RFC-Rad24-4E or RFC-Rad24-4R protein expression the strain PY94 (Mata ade2–1, his3–11,15, ura3–1, trp1–1, leu2–3,112, can1–100, RFC4Δ::kanMX6 with pBL 620 (Bluescript CEN ARS RFC4 TRP1)) was used. The strain was transformed with plasmid pBL422-RFC4R or pBL422-RFC4E, and transformants were grown for several generations on selective media for the pBL422 plasmids only. After plating on selective media, isolates that had lost pBL620 were readily identified. This indicates that expression of rfc4-K55R and rfc4-K55E from the galactose-inducible GAL1–10 promoter on the multicopy plasmid was sufficient to permit growth, even though the cells were grown on glucose-containing media. These isolates were then transformed with plasmid pBL766 and grown and induced as described for the RFC-Rad24K115E complex described above. RFC-Rad24 mutants were purified using a protocol described previously for the wild-type protein (10Majka J. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The chromatographic properties and purity of each mutant complex were comparable to wild type, indicating that the mutations did not cause severe folding and/or protein-protein association problems (Fig. 1). The mutant RFC-Rad24 proteins (0.1–5 μg) were analyzed by SDS-10% PAGE (Fig. 1) and stained with Sypro Red (Amersham Biosciences), and relative bands intensities were determined by phosphorimaging analysis. The molar ratio of Rfc5: (Rfc2+Rfc3):Rfc4 (Rfc2 and Rfc3 were poorly separated) were 1:2:1 with <10% variation from complex to complex. The molar ratio of Rad24 to Rfc2–5 was 0.9:1 for all of the complexes. A 32P-labeled Form of Rad17/3/1—The RAD17 gene in plasmid pBL764 was modified at the BamH1 site by insertion of an oligonucleotide specifying the MLRRASVGS peptide sequence preceding the natural methionine codon of the RAD17 gene, giving plasmid pBL764-PKA. The modified clamp (Rad17PKA/3/1) was purified from a yeast overexpression system as described previously (10Majka J. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Rad17PKA/3/1 (10 μg) was labeled in a 30-μl reaction with 50 μCi of carrier-free [γ-32P]ATP and 5 units of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (catalytic subunit) for 30 min at 30 °C according to manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). The factor was purified from unincorporated radioactivity by G25 gel filtration. Analysis of the Checkpoint Complexes and Their Interactions—Glycerol gradient centrifugation of 25 μg of wild-type or mutant RFC-Rad24 with or without 25 μg of Rad17/3/1 was performed in a 5-ml 10–30% glycerol gradient in buffer C (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing either 1 mm ATP or 50 μm ATPγS in an SW65 rotor (Beckman) at 4 °C for 20 h at 50,000 rpm. The protein in 180-μl fractions was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-10% PAGE. Carbonic anhydrase (2.8 S), bovine serum albumin (4.3 S), alcohol dehydrogenase (7.4 S), β-amylase (8.9 S), catalase (11.3 S), and ferritin (17.6 S) were used as sedimentation markers. ATPase Assays—Assays of 25 μl were performed in buffer C supplemented with 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The assays contained 50 nm RFC-Rad24, 100 nm Rad17/3/1 or PCNA, 50 μm [α-32P]ATP, and 1 μm effector DNA. After 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 min at 30 °C, 5-μl aliquots were removed from the reaction and quenched with 2 μl of 50 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) SDS, and 20 mm each ADP and ATP. 2 μl were spotted on a polyethyleneimine cellulose sheet and dried. The sheet was washed in water for 10 min, rinsed in ethanol, dried, and developed in 0.5 m LiCl/1 m formic acid. The sheet was dried and subjected to PhosphorImager analysis. DNA-Protein Interaction Analysis—Surface plasmon resonance was performed in a BIAcore X apparatus. Buffer C containing 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin was the running buffer used in the analysis. DNA chips were prepared as described and contained ∼50–100 resonance units of biotinylated DNA attached via streptavidin to a CM5 chip. The interaction between RFC-Rad24 mutants and Rad17/3/1 with DNA was monitored at 20 °C by injecting, at a flow rate of 30 μl/min, 80 μl of the protein factors and ATP or ATPγS at the indicated concentration over a DNA chip. The dissociation constant of the ATP-dependent DNA·RFC-Rad24·Rad17/3/1-binding reaction was determined by plotting the initial binding rates against the ATP concentration and fitting the data to a simple Langmuir binding model: Vmax = [ATP]/(KD + [ATP]). Gel Filtration Analysis of Clamp Loading—150 fmol of double-stranded circular Bluescript DNA with a single-stranded gap of 82 nucleotides (at the XhoI-SacII sites) was incubated with 250 fmol of wild-type or mutant RFC-Rad24 and 2 pmol of [32P]Rad17/3/1 in buffer A (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.8, 75 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) and varying ATP concentrations at 23 °C for 3 min and then loaded onto a 5-ml BioGel A5m column equilibrated in buffer A. The radioactivity in each 6-drop fraction was determined in a scintillation counter. Complex Formation between RFC-Rad24 and Rad17/3/1— RFC-Rad24 forms a stable equimolar complex with Rad17/3/1, which can be isolated by gel filtration or glycerol gradient centrifugation, but only if the complex is formed in the presence of ATP or the non-hydrolyzable analog ATPγS (10Majka J. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Rad17/3/1 alone does not bind DNA, and RFC-Rad24 shows weak binding to DNA in the presence of ATP. Therefore, the strong interaction with DNA observed when RFC-Rad24, Rad17/3/1, and ATP are present must indicate that RFC-Rad24 forms an ATP-dependent complex with Rad17/3/1 prior to interaction with DNA (10Majka J. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This property should allow us to quantitatively determine the ATP-dependent interaction between RFC-Rad24 and Rad17/3/1 indirectly by measuring DNA binding in a quantitative manner. We carried out a series of titration experiments in which protein binding to partial duplex DNA was measured by SPR. The interaction between the checkpoint factors and DNA was monitored in the presence of saturating ATP or ATPγS (see also Fig. 5) by injection of low and constant concentration (3 nm) of one complex and increasing concentrations of the other factor. Fig. 2, panels A and C, shows binding curves obtained at a constant concentration of the RFC-Rad24 clamp loader and increasing concentrations of the Rad17/3/1 clamp in the presence of saturating ATPγS or ATP, respectively, whereas panels B and D represent binding isotherms at a constant concentration of Rad17/3/1 complex and increasing concentration of RFC-Rad24. Similar shape and response amplitude for each pair of the corresponding binding curves not only confirms that the checkpoint factors form a complex prior to DNA binding but also allows us to make a quantitative determination of the KD value of the RFC-Rad24·Rad17/3/1 complex of 2.5 ± 0.5 nm, either with ATP or ATPγS present. This KD value compares well with that of 1.3 nm for the RFC·PCNA complex in the presence of ATP or ATPγS, which was determined under the same solution conditions (16Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34768-34775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). All of the additional kinetic experiments in this study used 50 nm RFC-Rad24 and 100 nm Rad17/3/1 to ensure extensive complex formation between clamp loader and clamp.Fig. 2Quantitation of interactions between RFC-rad24 and Rad17/3/1. The binding of RFC-Rad24 and Rad17/3/1 to DNA was studied using a 5′-recessed DNA substrate attached to a BIAcore CM5 via a biotin-streptavidin linkage (see inset). A–D, the checkpoint factors were injected at a constant 3 nm concentration of RFC-Rad24 and increasing concentrations of Rad17/3/1 (A and C) or at a constant 3 nm concentration of Rad17/3/1 and increasing concentrations of RFC-Rad24 (B and D) and either 100 μm ATPγS or 1 μm ATP. RFC-Rad24 with Rad17/3/1 but no nucleotide showed a response of <3 response units (R.U.). RFC-Rad24 without Rad17/3/1 but with ATP or ATPγS showed a response of <10 R.U. These curves have been subtracted in the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Purification of RFC-Rad24 Mutants—To further investigate the role of the ATP-binding domains in RFC-Rad24 for checkpoint clamp loader function, we purified three mutant complexes with mutations in the conserved lysine of the Walker A motif (17Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar). The rad24-K115E mutation results in a complete loss of function phenotype (15Naiki T. Shimomura T. Kondo T. Matsumoto K. Sugimoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A K55R mutation in the RFC4 gene displays a mild checkpoint defect, whereas the K55E mutant shows no phenotype (14Schmidt S.L. Pautz A.L. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34792-34800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Additionally, a rfc2-K71R mutation shows a checkpoint defect but the very poor growth of yeast cells containing this mutation, particularly when RAD24 was overexpressed, prohibited cell growth for biochemical purposes (results not shown). The mutant complex containing Rad24-K115E was overexpressed in a wild-type yeast background because the presence of the GST tag on Rad24-K115E allowed it to be purified away from chromosomally expressed wild-type Rad24. However, the complexes with mutant Rfc4 were overexpressed in a RFC4 deletion background (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The mutant complexes were purified by glutathione-affinity chromatography followed by viral protease treatment to remove the GST domain and finally by Mono S chromatography as described previously for the wild-type complex (10Majka J. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Similarly, to the wild-type RFC-Rad24 complex, all three mutants formed approximately stoichiometric complexes containing equimolar amounts of Rad24 and each of the four Rfc2–5 subunits (Fig. 1) (see also “Experimental Procedures”). The Rfc4K55E subunit in the mutant complex migrated slightly faster than wild-type Rfc4 (13Schmidt S.L. Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34784-34791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The proper subunit stoichiometry of the complexes together with their conserved chromatographic properties suggest that the mutations did not substantially alter folding and/or stability of the affected subunits. ATPase Activity of the RFC-Rad24 Mutants—All of the mutant complexes showed ATPase activity. The ATPase activity of the mutants, however, was reduced to ∼30–60% of that of wild type (Fig. 3). The ATPase of wild-type RFC-Rad24 is significantly inhibited in the presence of Rad17/3/1 but stimulated when both the clamp and substrate DNA are present, indicative of active clamp loading (10Majka J. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, the ATPase activity of all three mutants studied is neither significantly decreased by the presence of the checkpoint clamp nor increased by the clamp together with effector DNA, suggesting a defect in the interaction with the clamp and in clamp loading. Our earlier study revealed that the ATPase activity of RFC-Rad24 is strongly stimulated by PCNA (∼2.4-fold), yet the ATPase is not further stimulated when effector DNA is also present, suggesting an interaction between the two complexes but one that does not lead to productive clamp loading (Fig. 3) (10Majka J. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We observed that the mutant complexes were also stimulated by PCNA (∼1.5–2-fold), but no further stimulation was observed when DNA was also present. Therefore, ATP binding to both the Rad24 and Rfc4 subunits is essential for inhibition of the ATPase by Rad17/3/1 and for stimulation of the ATPase by both Rad17/3/1 and DNA; however, the apparently transient interactions between RFC-Rad24 and PCNA do not require an intact ATP-binding domain in the Rad24 subunit and even occur when the ATP-binding domain in Rfc4 is mutated as observed previously (13Schmidt S.L. Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34784-34791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). ATP-dependent Complex Formation between RFC-Rad24 and Rad17/3/1—The replication clamp loader RFC efficiently binds and loads PCNA onto DNA even with an inactivating K359E mutation in the conserved lysine of the ATP-binding site of Rfc1 (13Schmidt S.L. Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34784-34791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To test whether RFC-Rad24 also does not require ATP binding to the large subunit Rad24 for interaction with its clamp, we conducted a velocity sedimentation analysis to analyze complex formation. Contrasting to the wild-type clamp loader, RFC-Rad24K115E failed to form a detectable complex with Rad17/3/1 in the presence of 1 mm ATP or 100 μm ATPγS (Fig. 4D, data shown only for ATPγS). The K55R and K55E mutations in the ATP binding motif of Rfc4 also caused a failure to detect a complex by glycerol gradient centrifugation between mutant RFC-Rad24 and Rad17/3/1 in the presence of 1 mm ATP or 100 μm ATPγS (data not shown). These data indicate that a stable ATP-dependent complex between RFC-Rad24 and Rad17/3/1 clamp can only be formed when the ATP-binding sites of both Rad24 and Rfc4 are functional. Defective Clamp Loading by Mutant RFC-Rad24 —The velocity sedimentation experiments (Fig. 4) revealed that mutant RFC-Rad24 does not form an isolatable complex with Rad17/3/1. However, transient complexes might still be formed, which could be competent for loading onto partial duplex DNA. To test this hypothesis, we used SPR to detect loading. In this assay, a 3′-recessed partial duplex DNA substrate was used to which the wild type RFC-Rad24·Rad17/3/1 system had been shown to display the highest affinity (Fig. 5) (10Majka J. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The mutant RFC-Rad24K115E complex was completely defective for loading Rad17/3/1 onto this DNA substrate, either with 1 mm ATP or 100 μm ATPγS (Fig. 5B). Surprisingly, clamp loader complexes containing the Rfc4 ATP-binding domain mutants K55R and K55E, which did not appear to form stable complexes with Rad17/3/1, were able to load Rad17/3/1 onto the DNA albeit with much lower efficiency than wild type (Fig. 5, A, C, and D). In this assay, the mutant Rfc4K55E complex showed a substantial higher activity than the Rfc4K55R complex.

https://openalex.org/W1987738314,"The bacterial response to nutritional deprivation, called the stringent response, results in the introduction of the specific nucleotide guanosine-3′,5′-(bis) pyrophosphate (ppGpp). This nucleotide interacts with RNA polymerase and alters its action so that transcription from certain promoters is inhibited, whereas transcription from others seems to be activated. The exact mechanism of transcriptional stimulation by ppGpp in vivo remains unknown. A passive control model has been proposed according to which transcription inhibition during the stringent response at several very active promoters, like those for rRNA and tRNA genes, makes more free RNA polymerase (RNAP) molecules available for transcription at promoters with weak binding affinities for RNAP, thus leading to their passive activation. Among promoters whose transcription is activated by ppGpp in vivo is the histidine operon promoter (hisGp). However, in vitro it is only possible to demonstrate this effect in a coupled transcription-translation system. Here we demonstrate, using another in vivo ppGpp-stimulated promoter, the phage λpaQ promoter, that activation by ppGpp in a defined in vitro system is direct. A systematic study of ppGpp effects on the stimulation of paQ revealed that, as in the case of promoters inhibited by this nucleotide, ppGpp decreases the half-life of paQ open complexes. Our results also indicate that the equilibrium binding affinity of RNA polymerase to paQ seems not to be affected in the presence of ppGpp. Our data indicate that the mechanism underlying ppGpp stimulation of paQ is due to an increased rate of productive open complex formation. The bacterial response to nutritional deprivation, called the stringent response, results in the introduction of the specific nucleotide guanosine-3′,5′-(bis) pyrophosphate (ppGpp). This nucleotide interacts with RNA polymerase and alters its action so that transcription from certain promoters is inhibited, whereas transcription from others seems to be activated. The exact mechanism of transcriptional stimulation by ppGpp in vivo remains unknown. A passive control model has been proposed according to which transcription inhibition during the stringent response at several very active promoters, like those for rRNA and tRNA genes, makes more free RNA polymerase (RNAP) molecules available for transcription at promoters with weak binding affinities for RNAP, thus leading to their passive activation. Among promoters whose transcription is activated by ppGpp in vivo is the histidine operon promoter (hisGp). However, in vitro it is only possible to demonstrate this effect in a coupled transcription-translation system. Here we demonstrate, using another in vivo ppGpp-stimulated promoter, the phage λpaQ promoter, that activation by ppGpp in a defined in vitro system is direct. A systematic study of ppGpp effects on the stimulation of paQ revealed that, as in the case of promoters inhibited by this nucleotide, ppGpp decreases the half-life of paQ open complexes. Our results also indicate that the equilibrium binding affinity of RNA polymerase to paQ seems not to be affected in the presence of ppGpp. Our data indicate that the mechanism underlying ppGpp stimulation of paQ is due to an increased rate of productive open complex formation. When exposed to nutritional deprivation, bacteria respond quickly and efficiently to changing environmental conditions. This is accomplished in part by shutting down those physiological processes whose persistence is not necessarily energetically favorable for survival, such as translation. To shut down protein synthesis, stable RNA synthesis (i.e. rRNA and tRNA) is inhibited. Such action is mediated by a small transcription effector molecule, guanosine-3′,5′-(bis)pyrophosphate (ppGpp), 1The abbreviations used are: ppGpp, guanosine-3′,5′-(bis)pyrophosphate; RNAP, RNA polymerase. 1The abbreviations used are: ppGpp, guanosine-3′,5′-(bis)pyrophosphate; RNAP, RNA polymerase. and this general response to starvation and environmental stress is called the stringent response (for review, see Ref. 1Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. Neidhart F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar). ppGpp interacts with RNA polymerase, probably at an interface between the β and β′ subunits (2Chatterji D. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 3Toulokhonov I.I. Shulgina I. Hernandez V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 266: 5991-5999Google Scholar), and alters its action so that transcription from certain promoters, such as those for stable RNAs, is inhibited, whereas other promoters seem to be activated or unaffected. Not surprisingly, many promoters stimulated by ppGpp direct the transcription of amino acid biosynthesis operons. Among them is the histidine operon promoter of Salmonella typhimurium, hisG, which has been studied extensively (4Stephens J.C. Artz S.W. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4389-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 5Riggs D. Mueller R.D. Kwan H.S. Artz W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 6783-6789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To explain the ppGpp-dependent activation mechanism, a general passive control model has been proposed (8Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) wherein transcription inhibition at very strong promoters, like those for rRNA and tRNA synthesis, results in making more free RNA polymerase molecules available for transcription at promoters with a low affinity for this enzyme, thus leading to their passive activation. In contrast to the passive model, it was shown by Choy (7Choy H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6783-6789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) that, in a mixed template in vitro transcription system containing both positively and negatively controlled promoters, transcriptional inhibition and stimulation mediated by ppGpp are independent of each other, thus supporting a direct and active mode of positive transcription control by ppGpp. Still, the conclusion of Choy was based on studies employing an S-30 cell extract and, hence, whether ppGpp interacts directly with RNA polymerase to stimulate transcription or whether another factor participates in this process remained unknown. In this study we investigated in vitro the phage λpaQ promoter, a promoter previously uncharacterized for ppGpp stimulation in vitro, but which was previously shown to be stimulated by ppGpp in vivo (9Slominska M. Neubauer P. Wegrzyn G. Virology. 1999; 262: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We found that, in a defined in vitro system, transcription initiating from paQ is increased 50–60% in the presence of ppGpp in single-round transcription experiments. A systematic study of paQ stimulation by ppGpp in vitro revealed that, as in the case of promoters inhibited by this nucleotide, ppGpp decreases the half-life of the open complexes. In addition, our results indicate that promoter binding of the RNA polymerase to paQ is not affected by ppGpp. Rather, our data suggests that ppGpp increases the rate of formation of competent open transcription complexes. Our results clearly demonstrate that effect of ppGpp on λpaQ is direct, and, thus, this promoter's activation in vivo cannot be attributed solely to passive control and does not necessarily require any additional cellular factor. DNA Template Preparation—The λpaQ promoter region (-103 to +39 bp) was generated by PCR using wild-type λ DNA as a template and the primers 5′-GGCAATCTCTGCATCTTGCC-3′ (λpaQ3) and 5′-CACAAGGTATCGGGGAAATACC-3′ (λpaQ11). Following treatment with T4 polynucleotide kinase, the DNA fragment was inserted into pHG86 (10Giladi H. Igarashi K. Ishihama A. Oppenheim A.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which had been digested previously with SmaI. The resulting plasmid, called pKPpaQ39, served as the template in the PCR reactions wherein primers λpaQ3 and pUC1 (5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′; pUC19 universal primer) were used. The 285-bp PCR fragment thus obtained was used in the in vitro transcription reactions (the full-length run-off transcript produced in such reactions was 182 nucleotides long). Nucleotides and Enzymes—Deoxynucleotides, restriction enzymes, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and TaqDNA polymerase were purchased from MBI Fermentas. T4 DNA ligase and the RNA polymerase (RNAP) holoenzyme were obtained from EpiCentre Technologies. Nucleotides for in vitro transcription experiments were from Amersham Biosciences, and nucleotides for ppGpp synthesis, as well as heparin and poly(dI-dC), were from Sigma. ppGpp was synthesized and purified as described previously (11Cashel M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 57: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Cashel M. Kalbacher B. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 254: 2309-2318Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). [α-32P]CTP and [α-32P]ATP were purchased from ICN. For sequencing reactions the fmol® DNA cycle sequencing kit (Promega) was used. Protein Purification—The CII protein was prepared and purified as described (13Shotland Y. Shifrin A. Ziv T. Teff D. Koby S. Kobiler O. Oppenheim A.B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3111-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In Vitro Transcription Assay—In vitro transcription assays were performed in the total reaction volume of 20 μl at 37 °C using 10 nm template and 60 nm RNAP in a transcription buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mm KCl, 100 μm ATP, 100 μm GTP, 100 μm UTP, and 10 μm CTP (10 μCi/reaction [α-32P]CTP) and either 250 μm GDP or 250 μm ppGpp. RNAP was pre-incubated with GDP or ppGpp for 7 min at room temperature prior to the addition of KCl, followed by a 2-min incubation at 37 °C, and the reaction was started by mixing RNAP with template DNA and NTP substrates. Transcription was terminated after 10 min by the addition of an equal volume of stop and loading solution (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol). Samples were analyzed on a 7 m urea, 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gel and quantified by phosphorimaging on a Bio-Rad molecular imaging system. In experiments in which CII protein was used (37 nm final concentration), 50 mm KCl was employed. Open Complex Stability and Promoter Escape Assays—RNAP (60 nm) and a DNA template (10 nm) were incubated with 250 μm GDP or ppGpp at room temperature for 7 min in the transcription buffer, followed by 30 min of incubation at 37 °C with 20 mm KCl. After the addition of heparin (100 μg/ml final), aliquots (10 μl) were removed and added to 10 μl of an NTP mix containing 100 μm ATP, 100 μm GTP, 100 μm UTP, 10 μm CTP (10 μCi/reaction [α-32P]CTP), and 100 μg/ml heparin in transcription buffer. Reactions were chased for 7 min, stopped by adding an equal volume of loading buffer, and analyzed as described above. For the promoter escape assays, after 30 min of incubation at 37 °C with 20 mm KCl the NTPs mix was added simultaneously with heparin (100 μg/ml final) to the whole reaction mixture, and, at indicated times, samples (5 μl) were removed and terminated immediately by the addition of stop buffer. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—RNAP (0–180 nm) was pre-incubated with 250 μm GDP or ppGpp for 7 min at room temperature in the transcription buffer, followed by the addition of KCl (20 mm final), incubation at 37 °C for 2 min, and the addition of an α-32P-end-labeled DNA template (1 nm). After 5 min of incubation at 37 °C in the presence of a paQ template, poly(dI-dC) was added (100 μg/ml final), and the incubation was continued for another 5 min. Then, native loading buffer (30% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol) was added (one-sixth of the reaction volume), and the samples were loaded immediately on a running 3.5% polyacrylamide native gel and resolved using 0.5× Tris-boric acid-EDTA electrophoresis buffer. DNaseI Footprinting Assay—RNAP (100 nm) was pre-incubated with 250 μm GDP or ppGpp for 7 min at room temperature in the transcription buffer, followed by the addition of KCl (20 mm final). After 5 min of incubation at 37 °C, 32P-end-labeled DNA template (1 nm) was added. At varying times following the addition of DNA, 20-μl samples were removed and DNase I (7.5 ng/reaction) was added, followed by 5 min of incubation at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA (25 mm final), concentrated by vacuum evaporation, and an equal volume of loading buffer was added (80% formamide, 6 m urea, 10 mm NaOH, 2 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol). The samples were resolved on 7 m urea, 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gels, run in parallel with sequencing reactions obtained by using pKPpaQ39 as a template and 32P-end-labeled λpaQ14 primer (5′-GTGGGATTAACTGCGCGT-3′) as sequencing primer. KMnO4 Footprinting Assay—RNAP (60 nm) was pre-incubated with 250 μm GDP or ppGpp for 7 min at room temperature in the transcription buffer, followed by the addition of KCl (20 mm final). After 5 min of incubation at 37 °C, DNA template (10 nm) was added. At indicated times, 30 μl samples were removed and mixed with concentrated KMnO4 (0.3 m final), followed by 4.5 min of incubation at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched by the addition of 6 μl of 14.7 m β-mercaptoethanol, and the DNA was purified by using the High Pure PCR product purification kit (Roche Applied Science). Then, using a 32P-end-labeled λpaQ14 primer, primer extension was performed using Taq polymerase under the following cycling conditions: 1) initial denaturing at 94 °C for 2 min; 2) 35 cycles of denaturing at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 52 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 45 s; and 3) final extension at 72 °C for 4 min. Equal volume of the loading buffer was then added, and the samples were processed as described for the DNase I footprinting assay. Activation of the λpaQ Promoter in a Defined in Vitro System—To elucidate ppGpp-mediated transcriptional activation mechanism in vivo, during the stringent response many attempts to investigate this phenomenon in vitro have been made. However, these attempts were never successful in a defined transcription system, and only when using a coupled transcription-translation system for the hisG promoter was such activation observed in vitro (7Choy H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6783-6789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Here, we decided to investigate in vitro a promoter that was shown previously, by the use of promoter-lacZ fusions, to be activated by ppGpp in vivo, namely λpaQ (9Slominska M. Neubauer P. Wegrzyn G. Virology. 1999; 262: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It was long thought that in vitro transcription initiating from λpaQ absolutely requires the presence of the CII activator protein (14Hoopes B. McClure W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3134-3138Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15Ho Y.S. Rosenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 260: 11838-11843Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). It was suggested that, in the absence of this protein, RNA polymerase is capable of only a weak promoter interaction, leading perhaps to the formation of a closed complex, but not an active open complex. However, we find that the CII requirement holds true only when using a template containing the λpR′ promoter in addition to λpaQ (data not shown). This was the case in earlier work on this promoter in which a fragment of the phage λ DNA containing both promoters was used (14Hoopes B. McClure W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3134-3138Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15Ho Y.S. Rosenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 260: 11838-11843Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Presumably, because λpR′ is a strong promoter (16Kainz M. Roberts J.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 808-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), most of the RNA polymerase molecules bind preferentially at this site instead of to λpaQ. When we employed a PCR template constructed to contain λpaQ but exclude λpR, transcription was observed in the absence of CII. Thus, we investigated the ppGpp-mediated transcriptional activation in vitro, which was previously reported in vivo (9Slominska M. Neubauer P. Wegrzyn G. Virology. 1999; 262: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), both in the presence and absence of the CII protein. The in vitro transcription reactions were carried out in a standard transcription buffer containing the DNA template at 10 nm concentration, RNA polymerase (60 nm), and nucleotides (100 μm) (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). We found that, in this defined in vitro system, transcription initiating from λpaQ is enhanced by 25–60% in the presence of ppGpp when compared with experiments in which GDP was used at the same concentrations as a control (Fig. 1). These experiments were performed in the absence of CII and employed multiple round reactions. We conclude that ppGpp-mediated activation of paQ is direct and promoter-specific. The degree of activation was salt-dependent (Fig. 1). Because the greatest degree of activation observed was achieved at 20 mm KCl, we used this salt concentration in all subsequent experiments. The level of ppGpp-mediated activation of the λpaQ promoter was dose-dependent; however, above 50 μm ppGpp the transcription level appears saturated (Fig. 2). In all subsequent experiments, a saturating level of 250 μm ppGpp or GDP (in control experiments) was used. In addition, we were concerned that the addition of ppGpp might be leading to an indirect effect of adding contaminating ATP and/or GTP (present as 10% contaminants in our ppGpp preparation, data not shown), which would account for the observed stimulatory effects, especially considering that paQ initiates with ATP. However, we titrated ATP in the presence of ppGpp or GDP and chose a concentration of 100 μm ATP for all subsequent experiments, because this concentration was saturating for paQ transcription and was unaffected by the addition of contaminating ATP within the ppGpp preparation (data not shown). When similar experiments were performed in the presence of the CII protein, transcription initiating from λpaQ seemed to be slightly inhibited rather than activated (Fig. 2). Here, the inhibition was also dose-dependent, reaching ∼25% inhibition at the highest ppGpp concentration (750 μm) investigated. However, because the aim of this work was to elucidate the mechanism of the activation of the λpaQ promoter by ppGpp, subsequent experiments were performed in the absence of CII, where ppGpp-dependent transcription activation could be observed. Effect of ppGpp on Stability of Open Complexes at the λpaQ Promoter—Barker et al., (17Barker M.M. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) demonstrated that ppGpp decreases the stability of the open complexes of all promoters tested and furthermore hypothesized that ppGpp inhibits only those promoters that form intrinsically short-lived complexes. Our previous report concerning the ppGpp-sensitive promoter λpR (18Potrykus K. Wegrzyn G. Hernandez V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43785-43791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was in contrast with the hypothesis of Barker et al. (17Barker M.M. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), i.e. λpR forms very stable open-complexes and yet is inhibited by ppGpp. In our previous study, we found that although ppGpp destabilizes open complexes formed at the ppGpp-inhibited promoter λpR to a minor extent, overall these complexes remain very stable, even in the presence of ppGpp, and that this effect on open complex stability was not responsible for the observed transcription inhibition of λpR by ppGpp (18Potrykus K. Wegrzyn G. Hernandez V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43785-43791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated what the effects would be in the case of a ppGpp-activated promoter. RNA polymerase-promoter complexes were pre-formed on λpaQ DNA templates (by incubation under conditions specified under “Experimental Procedures”) in the presence of excess enzyme pretreated with either ppGpp or GDP (control experiments). This was followed by the addition of heparin to prevent re-association of RNA polymerase with the template DNA. The reactions were subsequently chased with nucleotides at different times to determine the relative level of promoter occupancy by measuring the level of the λpaQ-specific transcripts produced. We found that, as in the case of other promoters, ppGpp destabilizes open complexes formed at λpaQ. We estimated that the average lifetime of the paQ open complex was ∼30 min in control experiments, whereas in the presence of ppGpp it was decreased to ∼8 min (Fig. 3). This result is also indicative that the model proposed by Barker et al. (17Barker M.M. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) needs modification, because here we encounter a paradox wherein a ppGpp-activated promoter's open complexes are more destabilized by ppGpp (∼3.75-fold) than by a ppGpp-inhibited promoter, λpR (lifetime decreased from 1 h to 30 min (18Potrykus K. Wegrzyn G. Hernandez V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43785-43791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)). It should be noted here that, in the presence of CII, the lifetime of the open complexes was estimated to be ∼15 min in control experiments and ∼10 min in the presence of ppGpp (data not shown). This suggests that the mechanism of paQ activation by CII does not rely on open complex stabilization, because CII itself decreases the lifetime of such complexes (30 min in the absence of CII and 15 min in its presence). Effect of ppGpp on λpaQ in Single Round Transcription Assays—We then investigated whether ppGpp had an effect on λpaQ transcription under single round conditions. RNA polymerase-λpaQ complexes were pre-formed at 37 °C, and single-round transcription assays were performed by the simultaneous addition of heparin and NTP substrates. The rate of accumulation of full-length products was determined with increasing lengths of time in the presence or absence of ppGpp (Fig. 4). In control experiments it took ∼12 s for the polymerase to leave the promoter region and ∼1 min to achieve full-level transcription saturation. However, in the presence of ppGpp, the lag in full-length transcript production was ∼30 s, and it took 2 min to achieve the final transcription level, an ∼2-fold effect in both cases. Still, the final transcript level in the presence of ppGpp was ∼1.5-fold higher than that obtained in the absence of ppGpp (Fig. 4). This apparent delay in promoter escape is likely attributable to the well documented effect of ppGpp on the rate of transcription elongation (19Vogel U. Jensen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16236-16241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), wherein it was observed that the rate of elongation was slowed to half in the presence of ppGpp. We also found that the amount of abortive transcripts formed in the presence of ppGpp was not observably changed when compared with experiments performed in the presence of GDP (data not shown), a finding that is consistent with the general effect of ppGpp to slow transcript elongation rates because this effect would give the results observed in Fig. 4 without leading to the expectation that abortive transcription should increase. Despite the apparent slowing of transcription elongation rates by ppGpp, the final level of paQ transcripts was 50% higher, which is exactly the level of transcription activation observed originally (Fig. 1). Considering that this is observed under single round conditions, it likely results from a 50% apparent higher promoter occupancy. These results led us to suppose that the observed promoter activation results not simply from the difference in promoter occupancy but rather from the difference in productive promoter occupancy, i.e. the number of transcription complexes formed that are competent for productive RNA synthesis. This then led us to hypothesize specifically that the isomerization rate of the conversion of closed into productive open transcription complexes at paQ could be affected by ppGpp (see below). Effect of ppGpp on Binding of the RNA Polymerase to λpaQ—We then investigated a possible effect of ppGpp on RNA polymerase binding to the λpaQ promoter region. No effect was observed in the equilibrium level of binary complexes formed due to either varying ppGpp concentrations or varying RNA polymerase concentrations, as assessed by either electromobility shift assays or DNase I footprinting (data not shown). Effects of ppGpp on the Rate of Open Complex Formation— Because binding studies revealed no quantifiable effects of ppGpp on RNA polymerase binding, we proceeded to investigate possible qualitative effects of ppGpp on the rate of open complex formation at paQ. First, we determined whether there is a difference in the time necessary to establish transcriptionally active open complexes in the presence of ppGpp or GDP. To do this, RNA polymerase was pre-treated with ppGpp or GDP at room temperature in transcription buffer, followed by the addition of KCl and incubation at 37 °C for 2 min. Then, template DNA was added and, at indicated times, samples were withdrawn, and single round transcription was initiated by the simultaneous addition of NTP substrates and heparin. The reactions were chased for 9 min and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This was done in the presence and absence of the CII activator protein. The results obtained are shown in Fig. 5. Two distinct transcripts in the early time points are observed as a doublet (denoted by the asterisk in Fig. 5 in the panel labeled -CII), likely representing two distinct initiation sites that are being produced from two distinct open complexes (RPOC) that utilize different transcription start sites; however, at later times, all of the transcription seems to be initiated from a single site, which is consistent with the partitioning of the closed complex into one of two RPOC complexes through a common intermediate complex, RPCC(i). In the presence of CII activator protein, all transcription, even at the earliest time point, is initiated from a single start site (Fig. 5, +CII, also denoted by an asterisk) that corresponds to the upper transcript band in the absence of CII. The two transcripts observed (Fig. 5, -CII) here likely arise from the paQ promoter, because one of them (the upper band in Fig. 5, -CII) appears to be >20-fold enhanced when CII is added, and CII binding sites are located directly adjacent to paQ. In addition, point mutations in the core promoter sequences of paQ abolish the production of both transcripts (data not shown). It is apparent from these results (Fig. 5) that the two transcripts, arising presumably from two distinct open complexes (RPOC), are not present in equal amounts and are produced only in the absence of CII. The upper band in the doublet appears to be more abundant compared with the lower band; for example, compare the band intensities in the doublet at 15 min in the +GDP control in Fig. 5 with the +ppGpp at the 15-min time point. With increasing time the lower band diminishes, and the upper band becomes predominant. In the presence of ppGpp this partitioning appears to favor the RPOC, producing the upper band; for example, compare the doublet at ∼5 min in the presence of ppGpp with the doublet at 15 min in the presence of GDP. Perhaps this reflects the presence of an intermediate complex leading to the formation of multiple transcriptionally active open complexes and, thus, suggests that ppGpp affects the partitioning and conversion of the closed complex into a specific type of open complex on paQ. It should be noted here that, in the presence of the CII protein, no intermediate complexes were observed and that the “final” single transcript was observed to be present in the first 20 s of the experiment. This observation suggests further that λpaQ stimulation by CII results from a quick conversion to this single initiation complex and, thus, implies that the effect of ppGpp in the absence of CII is to increase the rate of formation of this final complex; in other words, ppGpp mimics the presence of CII at paQ. To test the hypothesis that ppGpp enhances the rate of open complex formation at paQ directly, we performed KMnO4 footprinting assays in which we investigated the time necessary to form open complexes in the presence of ppGpp or GDP. RNA polymerase was pretreated with ppGpp or GDP in transcription buffer, followed by the addition of salt, and the sample was warmed to 37 °C. Then, paQ template DNA was added, and, at indicated times, samples were withdrawn and treated with KMnO4, followed by primer extension (Fig. 6). The results of one permanganate footprinting assay are shown in Fig. 6. It is clear that, in the presence of ppGpp, open complexes are formed more rapidly when compared to the control reaction with GDP (Fig. 6C). The detection of the first open complexes is already apparent in the first 20 s of the experiment in both cases; in the presence of ppGpp ∼60% more of such complexes were formed, but on the average (three experiments), stimulation was ∼20–30%. As a control for sample-to-sample variation, quantification of footprint reactivities was normalized to nonspecific reactivities (present ± RNAP) observed at a position far removed from the promoter. Such difference persists until the 10th minute of the experiment, where the number of the open complexes reaches more or less the same level and no differences are detectable (Fig. 6C). These results support the hypothesis that ppGpp affects the rate of formation of productive open complexes at this promoter. Although the stringent response is a global regulatory process, and it has been known for over 30 years that the stimulation of certain promoters occurs in amino acid starved-cells (1Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. Neidhart F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar), the mechanism of this stimulation has remained obscure. A current model of how this mechanism operates is the passive regulation model (8Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 17Barker M.M. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Never before has activation by ppGpp been demonstrated in a well defined in vitro transcription system. Here, we investigated transcriptional stimulation of the bacteriophage λpaQ promoter. Our results indicate that such activation is direct and, at least in the case of this promoter, no additional effectors are necessary. Thus, the model of passive control may need further modification. Clearly, direct stimulation of promoter activity by ppGpp is possible. It has been implied by Barker et al. (17Barker M.M. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) that ppGpp destabilizes the open complexes formed at all promoters; however, only those promoters forming intrinsically unstable or “short lived” open complexes are inhibited. We demonstrated, however, that although open complexes formed at λpaQ are destabilized by ppGpp, transcription is actually stimulated and not inhibited by this promoter. Although the proposed model of Barker et al. (17Barker M.M. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) may hold true for the rrn promoters that form extremely unstable open complexes, the generalization of this model to the behavior of all promoters needs to be re-evaluated in the light of the behavior of paQ, which can be directly stimulated by ppGpp. Our studies reveal that binding of the RNA polymerase to paQ seems not to be affected by the presence of ppGpp. Rather, our data seems to indicate that ppGpp affects the rate of formation of productive open transcription complexes (Fig. 6). We suggest the presence of an intermediate closed complex, RPCC(i) which partitions into one of two transcriptionally active open complexes; the presence of an intermediate complex between closed and open complexes was originally proposed by Buc and McClure to explain kinetic properties of the lacUV5 promoter (20Buc H. McClure W.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2712-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Here we propose the existence of such an intermediate closed complex at 37 °C, whereas the intermediate complex observed by Buc and McClure was only observed at lower temperatures because of the entropic requirement for conversion of the intermediate closed complex to the open complex on placUV5 (20Buc H. McClure W.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2712-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). This intermediate closed complex is apparent on paQ, but only in the absence of the CII activator; in the presence of CII no intermediate is formed, as evidenced by the immediate formation of a single RNA species (Fig. 5), and in the presence of ppGpp this intermediate is still formed but is more readily partitioned into an open complex that has a higher efficacy for RNA synthesis (Figs. 5 and 6). The presence of a similar intermediate closed complex between closed and open complexes was recently observed in vivo on lac promoter variants fused to AraC activation sites (21Lutz R. Lozinski T. Ellinger T. Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3873-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and, similar to the observations made here, the appearance of intermediate promoter complexes was abrogated by the action of the AraC activator protein, which led to direct conversion of closed into open promoter complexes, as is apparent here when the CII activator is included (Fig. 5, +CII). Thus, ppGpp appears to affect the isomerization rate of the conversion of the closed complex into the open complex most likely by stabilizing an intermediate closed complex (RPCC(i)), which partitions into one of two open complexes, RPOC1 or RPOC2 (Fig. 7); the partitioning into RPOC1 is favored in the presence of ppGpp and leads directly to the formation of a stable, highly active initial transcribing complex ITC1, whereas in the absence of ppGpp the intermediate complex is not stabilized and, thus, more is converted into an inactive closed promoter complex. Thus, the main effect of ppGpp at this promoter is to lower the rate of the back reaction from the open to the closed promoter complex as outlined in Fig. 7, allowing more of the intermediate closed complex to accumulate, which, in turn, leads to a higher probability of forming highly productive open complex 1. It should be mentioned that these results, together with our previous results (18Potrykus K. Wegrzyn G. Hernandez V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43785-43791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), are consistent with our overall hypothesis that the incoming infecting phage assesses the levels of ppGpp as a means of monitoring the physiological state of the host at the moment of infection and responds appropriately. The paQ-derived transcript is an antisense RNA that inhibits expression of the Q gene, coding for an anti-terminator protein that is indispensable for expression of late phage genes (including cell lysis genes) during lytic development (14Hoopes B. McClure W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3134-3138Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15Ho Y.S. Rosenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 260: 11838-11843Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Thus, λpR inhibition, investigated in vivo (9Slominska M. Neubauer P. Wegrzyn G. Virology. 1999; 262: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19Vogel U. Jensen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16236-16241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lutz R. Lozinski T. Ellinger T. Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3873-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and in vitro (18Potrykus K. Wegrzyn G. Hernandez V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43785-43791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and λpaQ activation, both mediated by high intracellular levels of ppGpp, would contribute to the lysogeny pathway in phage development. Internally consistent with this hypothesis, also, is the CII-independent, ppGpp-mediated stimulation of λpaQ that we observed here, because the cII gene is the first gene in the λpR transcription unit, and its expression would be inhibited because of ppGpp-inhibitory regulation (18Potrykus K. Wegrzyn G. Hernandez V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43785-43791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Vogel U. Jensen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16236-16241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), obligating all “downstream” genetic regulatory events to be CII-independent. The modest level of activation observed (50–60%) here for the λpaQ promoter is significantly less than the estimated 20-fold activation observed on the hispG promoter in vitro using an 30 S cell extract (5Riggs D. Mueller R.D. Kwan H.S. Artz W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9333-9337Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The reason for this modest versus robust activation by ppGpp when comparing λpaQ expression to that of his may lie in the physiological role played by ppGpp in these two cases. In the case of his activation by ppGpp, histidine biosynthesis must be induced to a level sufficient to provide for histidine prototrophy. In the case of his induction during an amino acid starvation, protein synthesis is simultaneously restricted severely because of the accumulation of deacylated tRNAs, and, likewise, the translation of his mRNAs is severely hampered under amino acid starvation conditions. Thus, a dramatic induction of hispG promoter activity may be necessary to achieve a sufficient level of his mRNAs for adequate translation and production of the histidine biosynthetic enzymes. In the case of the λpaQ promoter, the produced transcript acts as an antisense RNA; thus, translation of paQ RNA is not required for its action. Therefore, a much lower level of induction may be necessary for effective paQ transcript levels to be achieved to give a particular physiological outcome, in this case, the implementation of the lysogeny over the lytic pathway. In addition, the lysis versus lysogeny decision is governed by such a tightly regulated genetic program that only small difference in the genetic output of any particular gene involved in this regulation may be sufficient to tip the balance in favor of one or the other outcome; thus, the 50% activation of paQ by ppGpp may represent such a case. Another major difference between ppGpp induction of the his operon and λpaQ is the fact that his promoter induction requires the addition of an S30 cell extract for the ppGpp effects to be observed, whereas paQ seems to respond to ppGpp in the absence of an S30 extract. The reason for this difference may be a direct extension of the λ genetic program. The λ phage can be viewed formally as a parasitic or rogue genetic element within the context of its bacterial host. As such, it has evolved the capacity to operate semi-independently of the host in as much as it still responds to the availability of host factors for processes such as replication and, in this case, the physiological state of the host as gauged by the level of ppGpp. That is to say, once the phage has “assessed” the physiological state of the host via ppGpp levels, it then implements its response independently of additional host factors and, thus, direct ppGpp-mediated paQ stimulation may simply reflect the nature of the phage to operate as an autonomous genetic element. Clearly, the phage employs host regulatory systems specifically for its development, and a direct stimulation of transcription from the paQ promoter by ppGpp may be beneficial under certain conditions. Although in this report we demonstrate for the first time that ppGpp can directly activate transcription in the absence of any other factors apart from RNA polymerase, it remains to be elucidated whether such a mechanism is specific only for phage promoter(s) or whether it also operates similarly at certain promoters present on the bacterial chromosome. We are grateful to Drs. Mike Cashel and Agnieszka Szalewska-Palasz for helpful suggestions with ppGpp purification."
https://openalex.org/W2082142146,"In WEHI-231, a representative immature B cell line, Ca2+ entry is paradoxically augmented by treatment with 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), a blocker of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor and of nonselective cation channels (Nam, J. H., Yun, S. S., Kim, T. J., Uhm, D.-Y., and Kim, S. J. (2003) FEBS Lett. 535, 113–118). The initial goal of the present study was to elucidate the effects of 2-APB on membrane currents, which revealed the presence of novel K+ channels in WEHI-231 cells. Under whole-cell patch clamp conditions, 2-APB induced background K+ current (IK,bg) and hyperpolarization in WEHI-231 cells. Lowering of intracellular MgATP also induced the IK,bg. The IK,bg was blocked by micromolar concentrations of quinidine but not by tetraethylammonium. In a single channel study, two types of voltage-independent K+ channels were found with large (346 picosiemens) and medium conductance (112 picosiemens), named BKbg and MKbg, respectively. The excision of membrane patches (inside-out (i-o) patches) greatly increased the Po of BKbg. In i-o patches, cytoplasmic MgATP (IC50 = 0.18 mm) decreased the BKbg activity, although non-hydrolyzable adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate had no effect. A pretreatment with Al3+ or wortmannin (50 μm) blocked the inhibitory effects of MgATP. A direct application of phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphosphate (10 μm) inhibited the BKbg activity. Meanwhile, the activity of MKbg was unaffected by MgATP. In cell-attached conditions, the BKbg activity was largely increased by 2-APB. In i-o patches, however, the MgATP-induced inhibition of BKbg was weakly reversed by the addition of 2-APB. In summary, WEHI-231 cells express the unique background K+ channels. The BKbgs are inhibited by membrane-delimited elevation of phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphosphate. The activation of BKbg would hyperpolarize the membrane, which augments the calcium influx in WEHI-231 cells.

Immune responses are initiated and regulated by the physical interactions of receptors and ligands on lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells. In addition to the external factors, intrinsic changes of lymphocytes would participate in shaping the ongoing responsiveness of cells. An important intrinsic determinant of responsiveness could be the membrane potential (Vm) that is mainly determined by the potassium permeability of cell membrane and transmembrane gradient of [K+]. K+ channels, besides setting resting Vm, play critical roles in various cellular functions (1Ashchroft F.M. Ion Channels and Disease, Academic Press, San Diego2000: 97-159Crossref Google Scholar). Among them, the modulation of calcium signals by providing electrical driving force has been suggested as an essential role of K+ channels (1Ashchroft F.M. Ion Channels and Disease, Academic Press, San Diego2000: 97-159Crossref Google Scholar, 2Verheugen J.A. Vijverberg H.P. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In human primary T cells, two kinds of K+ channels, the voltage-gated K+ channels Kv1.3 and the calcium-activated K+ channel IKCa1 (hSK4), are found to play such a role; Kv1.3 channels are essential for activation of quiescent cells, and signaling through protein kinase C pathway enhances expression of IKCa1 channels that are required for proliferation (3Ghanshani S. Wulff H. Miller M.J. Rohm H. Neben A. Gutman G.A. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37137-37149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 4Liu Q.-H.

Besides Vm regulation, K+ channels also regulate the loss of intracellular K+, which is a prerequisite step in the normotonic- or the Fas-mediated apoptosis (5Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1307-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 6Yu S.P. Canzoniero L.M.T. Choi D.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In contrast to the studies in T cells, the characteristics of K+ channels and their roles in B cells have been rarely investigated, and the types of reported K+ channels are restricted to the voltage-dependent (Kv) and Ca2+-activated (KCa) channels (7Partiseti M. Choquet D. Diu A. Korn H. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3361-3368PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lewis R.S. Cahalan M.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 623-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). A distinctive feature of the immune system is the balanced fine-tuning between growth and death by apoptosis. In bone marrow, the immature B cells with membrane-bound immunoglobulins reactive to autoantigens are arrested in the cell cycle and eliminated through the process of apoptosis, a crucial step preventing autoimmune diseases. In contrast, the mature B cells, once activated by specific antigens, undergo a second round of proliferation and selection in the secondary lymphoid organs to differentiate into memory B cells (9King L.B. Monroe J.G. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 176: 86-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 10Kurosaki T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).

The BCR ligation activates a series of protein-tyrosine kinases. Several of them (e.g. Syk and Btk) are involved in the activation of phospholipase Cγ, producing IP3 that subsequently mobilizes intracellular Ca2+ stores via the IP3 receptor (9King L.B. Monroe J.G. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 176: 86-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 10Kurosaki T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 14Marshall A.J. Niiro H. Yun T.J. Clark E.A. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 176: 30-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The resulting decrease in the Ca2+ content of intracellular stores triggers store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), which is required for the tonic increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) (8Lewis R.S. Cahalan M.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 623-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 15Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). In our previous study, the increase in [Ca2+]c by SOCE was compared between cell lines Bal 17 (mature B cells) and WEHI-231 (16Nam J.H. Yun S.S. Kim T.J. Uhm D.-Y. Kim S.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In WEHI-231 cells, the increase in [Ca2+] is paradoxically augmented by an application of 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB) that has been reported as a blocker of SOCE channels in other cells (17Bootman M.D. Collin T.J. Mackenzie L. Roderick H.L. Berridge M.J. Peppiatt C.M. FASEB J. 2003; 16: 1145-1150Crossref Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The unexpected effects might imply a 2-APB-activated Ca2+-permeable channels in WEHI-231, as recently identified in basophilic leukemia cells (18Braun F.-J. Aziz O. Putney Jr., J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1304-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that 2-APB indirectly enhances the Ca2+ influx via increasing the electrical driving force (i.e. membrane hyperpolarization). In the latter case, the K+ conductance of the WEHI-231 cell membrane would be increased by 2-APB. To address such hypotheses, it is essential to measure directly the membrane currents of WEHI-231 cells and examine the effects of 2-APB. Therefore, in this study, the initial goal was to elucidate the membrane conductance of WEHI-231 cells that is positively regulated by 2-APB. To our surprise, the patch clamp study indicates the presence of novel background K+ channels with very large unitary conductance (>340 pS) that are positively regulated by 2-APB. In addition, background K+ channels with medium size conductance (112 pS) are also present in WEHI-231 cells. Our experimental results also demonstrate that the large conductance K+ channels are negatively regulated by cytoplasmic ATP via phosphorylation of phosphoinositides in a membrane-delimited manner. Cells—Mouse B lymphocytes with properties of immature B cells (WEHI-231) and mature B cells (Bal 17) were grown in 25 mm HEPES RPMI 1640 media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). All cells were incubated at 37 °C in 95% O2, 5% CO2. Electrophysiology—Cultured cells were transferred into a bath mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (IX-70, Olympus, Osaka, Japan). The bath (∼0.15 ml) was superfused at 5 ml/min, and voltage clamp experiments were performed at room temperature (22–25 °C). Patch pipettes with a free-tip resistance of about 2.5 megohms were connected to the head stage of a patch-clamp amplifier (Axopatch-1D, Axon Instruments). Liquid junction potentials were corrected with an offset circuit before each experiment. Unless mentioned otherwise, a conventional whole-cell clamp was achieved by rupturing the patch membrane after making a giga-seal. In the perforated whole-cell patch clamp, a stock solution of nystatin in dimethyl sulfoxide (15 mg/ml) was added to the pipette solution, yielding a final concentration of 0.15 mg/ml. A steady-state perforation was usually achieved within 5 min after making a giga-seal. pCLAMP software version 7.0 and Digidata-1200A (both from Axon Instrument) were used for the acquisition of data and the application of command pulses. The resting membrane potential described in this study was measured under the zero-current clamp condition of the whole-cell patch clamp. Voltage and current data were low pass filtered (5 kHz) and stored using a digital tape recorder (DTR-1205, Biologic, Claix, France). Current traces were stored in a Pentium-grade computer and analyzed using pCLAMP software version 6.0 and Origin version 6.1 (Microcal Software Inc., Northampton, MA). Single channel activities were recorded at 10 kHz in cell-attached (c-a) and inside-out (i-o) configurations using fire-polished glass pipettes (final resistance, 8–9 megohms). Recordings were performed at room temperature with Axopatch-200B (Axon Instruments). The voltage and current data were low pass filtered at 2 kHz and stored for later analysis using Fetchan and pSTAT version 6.0 software (Axon Instruments). Data were analyzed to obtain an amplitude histogram and open probability (Po). Data were represented as mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used to test for significance at the level of 0.05. Experimental Solutions—The MgATP-free pipette solution for whole-cell patch clamp contained (in mm) 135 KCl, 6 NaCl, 10 HEPES, and 5 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, with a pH of 7.2 (titrated with KOH), and the final [K+] reached about 140 mEq/liter. To examine the effects of intracellular ATP on membrane currents, either MgATP or Na2ATP was added, as mentioned under “Results.” The normal bath solution for the whole-cell patch clamp contained (in mm) 145 NaCl, 3.6 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.3 CaCl2, 5 glucose, and 10 HEPES, with a pH of 7.4 (titrated with NaOH). In some experiments testing the K+ selectivity of channels and the effects of pharmacological blockers, high KCl bath solution was used (in mm): 140 KCl, 5 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.3 CaCl2, 5 glucose, and 10 HEPES, with a pH of 7.4 (titrated with KOH). The pipette solution for cell-attached (c-a) patch clamp contained (in mm) 140 KCl, 5 NaCl, and 5 HEPES with a pH of 7.4 (titrated with KOH). The pipette solution for i-o patch clamp and the bath solution for c-a and i-o patch clamp contained (in mm) 145 KCl, 1 EGTA, and 5 HEPES with a pH of 7.4 (titrated with KOH). To confirm the ion selectivity of recorded channels under the i-o recordings, the KCl of bath solution (cytoplasmic side) was totally replaced by NaCl, and the pH was titrated with NaOH. Phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) was initially delivered as a chloroform solution. The chloroform was evaporated with a stream of N2 to leave a filmy residue of PIP2. Recording solution was mixed with this residue and then sonicated for >30 min on ice in the dark. Wortmannin was first dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) to a concentration of 100 mm as a stock solution and was used at a concentration of 50 μm in the bath solution for i-o experiments. Considering the short half-life in the solution, the effect of wortmannin was tested within 2 h after dissolution. PIP2 was purchased from Avanti (Alabaster, AL). KR-252a was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). All the other chemicals and drugs used in this study were purchased from Sigma. Preparation of Cytosolic Fraction—WEHI-231 cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline without CaCl2 and MgCl2 (Invitrogen). Then cells were centrifuged again for 2 min at 1000 rpm. The pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of bath solution for i-o patch clamp study (see above). Cells were homogenized for 5 min in ice by using a pestle. Homogenized cells were then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C (model 5415R, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The supernatant was placed in a test tube and diluted with the bath solution for i-o patch clamp. The experiment was done within 1 h after obtaining the cytosolic fraction. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Sigma), and the final concentration of protein was 2.8 mg/ml. Background K+ Conductance in WEHI-231 Cells—As the first step in examining the effects of 2-APB on the membrane currents and membrane potential of WEHI-231 cells, the nystatin-perforated whole-cell clamp was applied to preserve unknown cytosolic components other than monovalent ions. After achieving steady-state perforation, hyperpolarizing or depolarizing step pulses from the holding voltage of –60 mV were applied (100 ms, from –100 to +60 mV, 20-mV interval). On step depolarization, a delayed activation of outward current superimposed upon the instantaneous background component was observed (Fig. 1A). Brief current to voltage relations (I/V curve) were also obtained by depolarizing ramp pulses (from –90 to 60 mV, 0.1 V/s), which showed a voltage-dependent increase of slope conductance at depolarized membrane voltages above –20 mV (Fig. 1B). The application of 2-APB (50 μm) markedly increased the instantaneous component of membrane conductance and hyperpolarized the Vm from –43.5 ± 1.63 to –68.5 ± 2.35 mV (n = 12). From the I/V curves, it is evident that 2-APB increased the membrane conductance at negative as well as positive clamp voltages, and the curve reversed its direction at around –70 mV, close to the K+ equilibrium potential, suggesting an activation of background-type K+ conductance (IK,bg). For reasons yet unknown, the amplitude of IK,bg varied between WEHI-231 cells from different culture passages. In general, the amplitude of maximum IK,bg tended to decrease with the lapse of culture date. Therefore, throughout the present study, care was taken to compare the effects of experimental conditions with the responses of control cells on the same date of culture. In the next experiments, the conventional whole-cell clamp was applied to control the intracellular environment more precisely (e.g. excluding the possibility of Ca2+ increase). A striking feature of WEHI-231 cells was that an outward current increased spontaneously after breaking in the patch membrane and dialyzing with MgATP-free KCl solution. On making a whole-cell configuration, the initial resting membrane potential was fluctuating around –30 mV, which hyperpolarized spontaneously to –75.0 ± 1.56 mV within 5–6 min after the break-in (n = 13). During the experiment, the membrane voltage was intermittently clamped at –60 mV, and ramp pulses (Fig. 1, C and D) were applied to monitor the changes in the membrane conductance. The slope of spontaneously developed membrane conductance was basically voltage-independent (Fig. 1C, n = 5), same with the IK,bg activated by 2-APB (Fig. 1, A and B). After full activation of IK,bg by the dialysis with the MgATP-free pipette solution, 2-APB had no further effect (n = 2, data not shown). The intracellular dialysis with di-sodium ATP (Na2ATP, 3 mm) without adding Mg2+ similarly increased the amplitude of IK,bg (Fig. 1C, n = 5). In contrast, no development of outward current was observed when 3 mm MgATP was included in the pipette solution (Fig. 1C, n = 4). These results suggest that the development of IK,bg is suppressed by cytoplasmic MgATP that can be used as a substrate for kinases in WEHI-231 cells. In Fig. 1D, we tested whether 2-APB could overcome the inhibition of IK,bg by MgATP. With 3 mm MgATP in the pipette, a bath application of 2-APB increased the outward current (n = 5). However, the increase was much smaller than the effects obtained in the nystatin-perforated conditions. The voltage independence and K+ selectivity of the above background currents were confirmed more precisely. After the steady-state development of outward current under MgATP-free conditions, the extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]ext) was increased in a stepwise manner, and the I/V curve was obtained by ramp pulses from –90 to +60 mV (Fig. 1E). With symmetrical K+ concentrations in the pipette and the bath solution, the I/V curve became almost linear, confirming the voltage-independent background activity of K+ channels in WEHI-231 cells. Also, the reversal potential was right-shifted reflecting that a highly potassium-selective conductance was induced. In contrast to the above results in WEHI-231 cells, no such IK,bg was observed in Bal 17 cells, a mature B cell line from mouse. The Bal 17 cells were voltage-clamped using the patch pipettes containing MgATP-free KCl solution, and various levels of depolarizing step pulses were applied. A prolonged dialysis with MgATP-free solution (>5 min) induced an increase of outward current only at highly depolarized clamp voltages (>40 mV) without shifting the reversal potential of the I/V curves (Fig. 1F). In this state, the application of 2-APB did not evoke IK,bg but reduced the currents at depolarized clamp voltages (Fig. 1F). The IK,bg Is Resistant to TEA but Sensitive to Quinine/Quinidine—Tetraethylammonium (TEA) is an ion channel blocker with broad effects on various classes of K+ channels. In WEHI-231 cells, after dialyzing with MgATP-free pipette solution over several minutes to develop IK,bg, a bath application of 10 mm TEA weakly decreased the outward currents only at depolarized clamp voltages (>0 mV), and the reversal potential was not shifted (Fig. 2A). The resistance of IK,bg to TEA and its voltage independence were similar to the properties of the recently identified K+ channels with two tandem pore-loop domains (K2P channels) (19Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F793-F801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Goldstein S.A.N. Bockenhauer D. O'Kelly I. Zilberberg N. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). All the cloned K2P channels were resistant to TEA, whereas some subtypes showed variable sensitivity to quinine (quinidine) or to Ba2+ (19Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F793-F801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the next experiment, therefore, the effects of quinine and quinidine on the IK,bg were examined. After confirming the full activation of IK,bg and membrane hyperpolarization under MgATP-free conditions, all extracellular Na+ was substituted to K+ (140 mm KCl), which revealed inward K+ currents at negative membrane voltages. The brief I/V curves were obtained with ramp-pulse protocols (from –90 to +60 mV, 0.1 V/s, 5-s interval), and various concentrations of blockers were applied to the bath (Fig. 2B). Both quinine and quinidine displayed inhibitory effects on IK,bg in a completely reversible manner. The effects of quinine and quinidine were voltage-dependent; both agents blocked IK,bg more effectively at positive voltages than at negative voltages. The concentration-response curves were obtained at –60 and at +60 mV, where the half-inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of quinine were 30.5 and 9.8 μm, respectively. Similarly, the IC50 values of quinidine were 51.7 and 6.2 μm at –60 and at +60 mV, respectively (Fig. 2, C and D). We also tested the effects of Ba2+, a nonselective K+ channel blocker, on IK,bg. The blocking effects of Ba2+ were relatively weak and more effective at negative membrane voltages, opposite to the effects of quinine or quinidine (Fig. 2, E and F). As some types of K2P channels are sensitively regulated by extracellular pH and the stretch of cell membranes (19Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F793-F801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Goldstein S.A.N. Bockenhauer D. O'Kelly I. Zilberberg N. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), it was tested whether the extracellular acidification or osmotic stress affects IK,bg. An acidification of bath solution to pH 6.5 decreased the peak amplitude of outward currents by 21 ± 1.8, 45 ± 9.6, and 54 ± 9.6% of control at +60, 0, and –40 mV, respectively (data not shown). Thus the inhibitory effect by extracellular acidification was weakly voltage-dependent; a larger inhibition was observed at the negative clamp voltage. In another experiment, to exert an osmotic stress, 30 mm extracellular NaCl was replaced with 60 mm sucrose and regarded as an isotonic control. To apply hypotonic and hypertonic stimuli, 60 mm sucrose was omitted (–60 mosm) or newly added (+60 mosm, total 120 mm sucrose) for 3 min, respectively. Although not directly shown here, concomitant swelling or shrinkage of cells was clearly observable. However, neither the hypertonic shrinkage nor the hypotonic swelling had significant effect on IK,bg. Also, when the development of IK,bg was suppressed with 3 mm MgATP in the pipette solution, the hypotonic swelling could not induce IK,bg (data not shown). Single Channel Recording of the Background K+ Channel—In the c-a condition with KCl (140 mm) pipette solution, single channel activities with large amplitudes of unitary currents were observed in WEHI-231 cells (Fig. 3A-a). The Po was initially very low but was greatly increased by the excision of membrane into MgATP-free KCl solution (Fig. 3A-b, see also Fig. 3C). When the K+ in the cytoplasmic side was totally replaced with Na+, the outward channel current at the positive clamp voltage was abolished (Fig. 3A-c), which confirmed the K+ selectivity of this channel. In the i-o conditions, the I/V relation under symmetrical KCl showed a weak inward rectification (Fig. 3B, closed circles). The slope conductance was 346 pS at negative voltages, and the Po was similarly high at both positive and negative membrane voltages (Fig. 3C). In the c-a recording with KCl pipette solution, presumably symmetrical K+ gradient across the patch membrane, the I-V curve was same with the one obtained under the i-o conditions (data not shown). In some cases of c-a recording, the KCl concentration in the pipette solution was reduced to 8.5 mm by an isomolar replacement with NaCl. With the low K+ pipette solution (i.e. low [K+]ext), the reversal potential of I-V curve was –70 mV, again indicating the K+-selective permeability of the 346 pS K+ channel (Fig. 3B, open circles, n = 4). From these results, we designated the background K+ channel with a maximum slope conductance of 346 pS as BKbg. The BKbg were observed in 95 cases out of total 480 trials of i-o patches. Although the i-o recording of BKbg was done in Ca2+-free conditions with 1 mm EGTA, the size of unitary conductance suggested that the BKbg might be related with maxi-K, the large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels. However, an inclusion of iberiotoxin (500 nm), a well known blocker of maxi-K, in the pipette solution of c-a patches did not block the BKbg (n = 4, data not shown). Also, the involvement of recently found Na+-activated K+ channels with unitary conductance of 141 pS, Slick channel (21Bhattacharjee A. Joiner W.J. Wu M. Yang Y. Sigworth F.J. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11681-11691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was excluded because an increase of [Na+] to 50 mm in cytoplasmic bath solution had no effect on BKbg activity (n = 5, data not shown). In addition to BKbg, K+ channels with smaller conductance, designated MKbg (medium conductance background K+ channels), were observed at both positive and negative clamp voltages (Fig. 4). In the i-o conditions, the I-V curve of MKbg also showed a weak inward rectification with maximum unitary conductance of 112 pS at negative membrane voltages (Fig. 4A). The replacement of cytoplasmic K+ with Na+ completely abolished the channel activity, proving the K+ selectivity of MKbg (Fig. 4B). Although the unitary conductance was larger at negative voltages, the Po of MKbg was ∼2-fold higher at +60 mV than at –60 mV (Fig. 4C). The MKbgs were observed in 46 cases out of a total 480 trials of i-o patches. Because the unitary conductance of MKbg was similar to that of TREK-2 channels (22Bang H. Kim Y. Kim D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17412-17419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), it was tested whether the acidification of intracellular pH or membrane stretch facilitates the activity of MKbg. However, the intracellular acidification (pH 6.0) inhibited MKbg (n = 4, Fig. 4D), and the membrane stretch by a negative pressure (–40 cm of H2O in the pipette) had no effect (n = 3, Fig. 4E). Inhibition of BKbg by Intracellular MgATP—As mentioned above, the excision of membrane patches yielded a large increase of the Po of BKbg, suggesting the washout of “inhibitory” cytosolic components. Because the whole-cell current (IK,bg) was sensitive to MgATP in the cytoplasmic solution, we tested the effects of MgATP on the K+ channels under the i-o conditions. The Po of BKbg decreased dramatically with the application of MgATP (1 mm) to the cytoplasmic side, which was completely reversed by washout (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the di-sodium form of ATP (Na2ATP) had no effect on BKbg activity (n = 3, data not shown). BKbg activity was not affected by AMP-PNP (1 mm), a non-hydrolyzable analogue of ATP (Fig. 5B). These results suggest a phosphorylation-dependent regulatory mechanism for the inhibition of BKbg. Moreover, the application of ATPγS (1 mm), which is commonly used for permanent phosphorylation of substrates, exerted a non-washable inhibition of BKbg (Fig. 5C). Because the commercially available AMP-PNP and ATPγS are provided as lithium salts, 0.5 mm MgCl2 was added along with the application of AMP-PNP or ATPγS in the above experiments. The application of Li2ATPγS (1 mm) had no effect on BKbg activity (n = 2, data not shown). The current trace of Fig. 5C demonstrates a representative case where both BKbg and MKbg were present in the same patch of membrane. In contrast to the non-reversible inhibition of BKbg, it was evident that the activity of MKbg was persistent in the prese"

Although the amino acid sequences of these motifs are highly conserved between closely related organisms, variation across broader evolutionary distances suggests that only a few residues in each motif are indispensable for polymerase function. To test this, we constructed libraries of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) containing random single amino acid replacements in motif B of reverse transcriptase (RT), and we used selection in culture to assess RT function. Despite the nearly absolute constancy of motif B in vivo, virus replicating in culture tolerated a range of conservative and nonconservative substitutions at 10 of the 11 amino acid positions examined. These included residues that are invariant across all retroviral subfamilies and highly conversed in diverse retroelements. Several mutants retained wild type infectivity, and serial passage experiments revealed replacements that were neutral or even beneficial to viral fitness. In addition, a number of the selected variants exhibited altered susceptibility to the nucleoside analog inhibitors AZT and 3TC. Taken together, these data indicate that HIV-1 tolerates a range of substitutions at conserved RT residues and that selection against slightly deleterious mutations (purifying selection) in vivo masks a large repertoire of viable phenotypic variants. This mutational flexibility likely contributes to HIV-1 evolution in response to changing selection pressures in infected individuals.

This mutational flexibility likely contributes to HIV-1 evolution in response to changing selection pressures in infected individuals. Replicative DNA and RNA polymerases catalyze the transfer of genetic information from parent to progeny. In response to diverse biological requirements, polymerases have evolved with varied substrate specificities, mechanisms of initiation, and associations with other replication proteins (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 553, 689-636, 730Google Scholar). This is clearly evident in bacterial and animal viruses, which exhibit wide ranging host environments and replication strategies. Thus, different viral polymerases initiate synthesis from RNA, DNA, or protein primers; require viral or host accessory factors; and preferentially incorporate dNTP, rNTP, or nucleotide analog substrates (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 553, 689-636, 730Google Scholar). Despite these biochemical differences, viral polymerases are structurally very similar (2Steitz T.A. J. Biol.

The active site motifs A, B, and C are virtually superimposable in all known structures of replicative DNA- and RNA-dependent polymerases (Fig. 1A). Conservation of this core architecture presumably reflects a fundamental requirement for template-directed nucleotidyl transfer. Motifs A and C form antiparallel β sheets that position catalytic aspartates at the active site, and motif B packs against this structure (2Steitz T.A. J. Biol.

This loop is absent in structures of DNA-dependent polymerases, which instead possess a single, continuous α-helix in this region (3Hansen J.L. Long A.M. Schultz S.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal portion of the motif B helix is common to both RNA- and DNA-dependent polymerases, although these two classes of polymerases share little sequence similarity in this region (3Hansen J.L. Long A.M. Schultz S.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The strong structural conservation of motif B in RTs and RDRPs suggests that amino acid residues in this region are critical for polymerase function and viral replication. Two lines of evidence support this suggestion. First, biochemical analyses of mutant RTs and RDRPs have identified a number of amino acid replacements in motif B that severely compromise polymerase activity (7O'Reilly E.K. Kao C.C. Virology. 1998; 252: 287-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 8Gao H.Q. Boyer P.L. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Mol.

Second, the primary sequence of motif B is strictly conserved in independent virus isolates; in human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), this region is nearly invariant (16Kantor R. Machekano R. Gonzales M.J. Dupnik K. Schapiro J.M. Shafer R.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Motif B sequences are also highly conserved between members of a particular viral family (e.g. retroviruses) (Fig. 1B, top). However, alignments of RT sequences from distantly related retroelements reveal variation in this region (Fig. 1B, middle), and further variability is apparent when RTs are compared with RDRP sequences, since only a single glycine is absolutely conserved across all families (Fig. 1B, bottom). A similar pattern of sequence variation occurs in motifs A and C (17Doolittle R.F. Feng D.F. Johnson M.S. McClure M.A. Q. Rev. Biol. 1989; 64: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 18Poch O. Sauvaget I. Delarue M. Tordo N. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3867-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that the majority of residues in conserved motifs can accept mutations that preserve essential polymerase functions and, by extension, viral replication. In this study, we used a biological approach to determine the functional importance of individual amino acid sites in motif B of HIV-1 RT. Pools of HIV-1 variants with random single amino acid replacements in motif B were constructed and then passaged in culture. Replication-competent viruses selected from these pools included mutants with substitutions at highly conserved positions, and several variants exhibited altered susceptibility to nucleoside analog inhibitors. We also identified a variant that outgrew the wild type strain during the course of serial passage, demonstrating that mutations in a conserved polymerase element are occasionally adaptive in character. Our data, together with recent studies of other polymerases (19Kim B. Hathaway T.R. Loeb L.A. J. Biol.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5969-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 24Graur D. Li W.-H. Fundamentals of Molecular Evolution. Second Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2000: 41Google Scholar) conceals a number of viable RT variants with unique phenotypes. The potential impact of this plasticity on the evolution of HIV-1 variants in vivo is discussed. Plasmids, Cells, and Viruses—All mutant strains and random virus pools were derived from pR9, a full-length HIV-1 proviral clone containing NL4-3 (gag, pol, and env) and HXB2 (5′- and 3′-LTRs) sequences in which all open reading frames are intact (25Swingler S. Gallay P. Camaur D. Song J. Abo A. Trono D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4372-4377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To facilitate manipulations of the pol gene, we used a modified version of pR9 that lacks an ApaI site in the plasmid backbone (kindly provided by Dr. Uta von Schwedler, University of Utah). pR9Δpol was created from this modified pR9 by replacing the central ApaI/EcoRI fragment (HIV-1NL4-3 nt 2010-5743) with an ApaI-ATCGATGCGGCCGC-EcoRI synthetic linker (unique ClaI and NotI sites are underlined and italicized, respectively). pBS-pol was created by subcloning the same ApaI/EcoRI fragment into pBluescript II KS(-) (Stratagene). This fragment includes the entire HIV-1 pol gene (encoding RT) and portions of gag and env. pBS-polam (containing an amber stop codon substitution at RT position 154) and pBS-polClaI (containing a unique ClaI site insertion, GATCGAT, at RT codon 152) were generated from pBS-pol by site-directed mutagenesis (Muta-Gene phagemid mutagenesis kit; Bio-Rad). 293tsA1609neo (293T) (26Pear W.S.

Random Mutagenesis—Plasmid libraries randomized at individual codons in RT motif B were constructed by degenerate oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis starting with pBS-polam (for Gly152, Lys154, Pro157, and Gln161 mutant pools) or pBS-polClaI (for the remaining mutant pools). The oligonucleotides (Operon) spanned HIV-1NL4-3 nucleotides 2971-3030 for pools randomized at sites Val148-Gln151, 2982-3029 for Gly152, 2977-3034 for Trp153 and Gly155, 2991-3030 for Lys154, 2982-3038 for Ser156, and 3002-3043 for Pro157 and Gln161. Individual sites were randomized using two or three preparations of oligonucleotides, each containing slightly different mixtures of degenerate mutant sequences at the target codon. The sequences at each codon were as follows: Val148, HNN/NVN; Leu149, NVN/RNN; Pro150, NDN/DNN; Gln151, NBN/DNN; Gly152, HNN/HHN/NHN; Trp153, NNH; Lys154, BNN/BNY/NNY; Gly155, HNN/NHN; Ser156, NWN/SNN/VNR; Pro157, NDN/DNN; Gln161, NBN/DNN (where N represents A/T/G/C; D is A/G/T; B is C/G/T; H is A/C/T; V is A/C/G; R is A/G; Y is C/T; and S is C/G). These resulted in the exclusion of wild type amino acid codons, as well as variants L149F, Q151H, K154M, S156C, S156W, and Q161H, from the oligonucleotides used for random mutagenesis. For amino acid positions Gly152, Lys154, Pro157, and Gln161, separate mutagenesis reactions were conducted for each mutant oligonucleotide preparation, and the products of these reactions were maintained as separate libraries and pools in subsequent cloning and virus production steps. For the remaining amino acid positions, single mutagenesis reactions were conducted by mixing equal amounts of each oligonucleotide preparation prior to mutagenesis. Products from the mutagenesis reactions were electroporated into ElectroMAX DH10B E. coli (Invitrogen), plasmids were isolated from pools of >104 independent transformants, and ApaI/EcoRI fragments from the pools were cloned into pR9Δpol (Fig. 2A). The resulting full-length pR9 mutant libraries were purified from pools of >104 independent transformants using the Endo-Free Maxiprep kit (Qiagen). Mutant pR9 libraries derived from pBS-polClaI were additionally digested with ClaI, transformed back into E. coli, and reisolated. This step increased the proportion of mutants in the final plasmid pools from 5-40 to ≥90%. Transfections—To prepare wild type virus stocks and random virus pools, CaPO4-pR9 DNA coprecipitates were prepared with 10 μg of plasmid DNA as described (41Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar) except that the 2× BBS buffer was replaced with 2× HEPES-buffered saline (270 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm Na2HPO4·2H20, 11 mm dextrose, 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.05). 293T cultures were seeded into 10-cm plates and grown to ∼25% confluence prior to the addition of the CaPO4-DNA coprecipitates. Following a 3-h incubation, culture supernatants were aspirated, 2 ml of 10% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 min. Cells were then rinsed twice with 6 ml of PBS, 10 ml of DMEM were added to each plate, and the cultures were returned to the incubator. Culture supernatants were harvested ∼42 h after transfection, filtered through 0.4-μm syringe filters, and stored in 1-ml aliquots in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen for subsequent analysis. Stocks of individual HIV-1 mutants were produced by transfection of 293T cells as described above, except that the glycerol shock step was omitted. Cultures were instead treated with chloroquine at a final concentration of 25 μm in DMEM immediately before adding the DNA/CaPO4 mixtures. Supernatants were aspirated and replaced with fresh medium 1 day later and then harvested and frozen the following day as described above. The titers of wild type stocks produced by either protocol typically ranged from 2 × 105 to 5 × 105 focus-forming units (FFU)/ml for frozen stocks and 1 × 106 to 4 × 106 FFU/ml for fresh preparations. Infectivity Assay—Single-round infectivities were determined using HeLa-P4 indicator cells (27Charneau P. Mirambeau G. Roux P. Paulous S. Buc H. Clavel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). HeLa-P4 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 0.5 × 104 cells/well 1 day prior to infection. Serial dilutions of virus were prepared in DMEM containing 20 μg/ml DEAE-dextran (Sigma), and 25 μl of each dilution were added to separate culture wells. Following a 3-h incubation at 37 °C, 175 μl of DMEM were added to each well, and the plates were returned to the incubator. Stocks containing low titers were assayed in 24-well plates to increase the accuracy of the assay. In this case, each well received 2 × 105 cells, 200 μl of virus stock, and 1 ml of medium following the 3-h incubation period. After 40 h of growth, cultures were fixed and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal; Promega). In this time frame, infected cells appeared as isolated groups of 2-5 contiguous blue cells, indicating that the majority of foci were derived from a single cycle of virus replication. Titers from the focal assay were normalized against HIV-1 capsid p24 concentration (DuPont HIV-1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) to determine the infectivity of mutants relative to wild type virus. The infectivity of the wild type virus was 880 ± 180 FFU/ng p24 (means ± S.E.) for frozen stocks and 4500 ± 1100 FFU/ng p24 for fresh supernatants. A variant containing the RT-inactivating D185A mutation served as a negative control and yielded 0.014 ± 0.004 FFU/ng p24 from frozen stocks. Serial Passage Protocol—Supernatants from 293T cultures transfected with pR9 mutant libraries were used to initiate each serial passage experiment (Fig. 2B, input virus pools). HeLa-P4 cells were seeded at 105 cells/10-cm plate in DMEM and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Infection was initiated by the addition of 104 infectious particles (in 2 ml of DMEM containing 20 μg/ml DEAE-dextran), followed by incubation at 37 °C for 2-4 h. An additional 6 ml of DMEM was then added to each plate, and incubation was continued overnight. The monolayers were then washed three times with 6 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and cultures were replenished with 8 ml of fresh medium, which was changed again after 2 days of incubation. On the fifth day after infection, culture supernatants were harvested, passed through 0.4-μm filters, and treated with 420 units of DNase I (Worthington) at 37 °C for 20 min after adding MgCl2 to a final concentration of 10 mm. Viral particles were concentrated by layering 1 ml of culture supernatant onto a 250-μl cushion of 20% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline, followed by centrifugation at 15,500 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. Pelleted virions were resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (7 m urea, 0.35 m NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 1% SDS) and stored at -20 °C for subsequent RNA extraction and RT-PCR amplification. The remaining unconcentrated culture supernatants were frozen in 1-ml aliquots in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen. Titers were determined as described above, and the process was repeated to initiate the next passage. Thus, a “passage” is defined as one cycle of infection, incubation, and harvest. The 5-day incubation period corresponds to ∼5-10 cycles of wild type HIV-1 replication (assuming a replication rate of 1-2 days-1) (42Resch W. Ziermann R. Parkin N. Gamarnik A. Swanstrom R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8659-8666Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Viral RNA Extraction—Viral lysates (100 μl; see above) were thawed on ice, and 100 μl of TE, pH 8, was added to each tube. Samples were extracted twice with equal volumes of acidic phenol (pH 4) and back-extracted at each step by the addition of 100 μl of TE, pH 8, to the organic phase. The resulting aqueous phases were then extracted twice with equal volumes of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1). Viral RNA was precipitated with 300 μl of 100% isopropyl alcohol followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. Samples were pelleted by centrifugation at 15,500 × g, washed with 300 μl of 70% EtOH, resuspended in 20 μl distilled H2O, and stored at -20 °C. If products were observed in control RT-PCRs that lacked RT (see below), the corresponding RNA samples were subjected to a second DNase I treatment to remove contaminating plasmid or proviral DNA. Samples (8 μl) were digested with 1 unit of amplification grade DNase I (Invitrogen) for 15 min at room temperature in 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4. Reactions were quenched by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 2.5 mm and then heat-inactivated at 65 °C for 10 min. The resulting products (1 μl/reaction) were then added to RT-PCR mixtures and amplified as described below. RT-PCR—RT-PCR was performed in thin-walled tubes (Robbins) using the Access RT-PCR system (Promega) in 50-μl reactions containing a 200 μm concentration of each dNTP, 1 mm MgSO4, 5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, 5 units of Tfl DNA polymerase, 10 μl of 5× avian myeloblastosis virus/Tfl buffer, 50 pmol each of primers H3 and BH1 (see below), and 1 μl of extracted viral RNA. Primers BH1 (5′-TATGGATCCCTTTTAGAATCTCCCTGTTTTCTGCC-3′, BamHI site underlined) and H3 (5′-AGTCAAGCTTGGATGGCCCAAAAGTTAAACAATGGCC-3′, HindIII site underlined) amplified a 0.8-kb fragment corresponding to nucleotides 2597-3483 of HIV-1NL4-3. Thermocycling conditions in an MJ Research PTC-100 thermocycler were as follows: 48 °C for 45 min, 94 °C for 2 min; then 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 2 min; and ending with 68 °C for 7 min. Control reactions lacking RT were performed and analyzed in parallel to ensure that amplification was RNA-dependent. When required, viral RNA samples were subjected to a second DNase I treatment to remove contaminating plasmid or proviral DNA (see above). RT-PCR products were sequenced either directly (to quantify fitness) or after subcloning (to identify individual mutants) using primer pNL1 (5′-GACTTCAGGAAGTATACTGC-3′) and Big Dye Terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems). Molecular Cloning and Sequencing—RT-PCR products were digested with BamHI and HindIII (Promega), ligated into pBluescript II KS(-) (Stratagene), and electroporated into ElectroMAX DH10B E. coli (Invitrogen) for blue/white screening. Individual white colonies were picked and mixed into 25 μl of RT-PCR mixture as described above, but without avian myeloblastosis virus RT, and the 0.8-kb pol fragment (nt 2597-3483) was amplified using the Access RT-PCR system (Promega) and primers H3 and BH1. Thermocycling conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 3 min; then 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 2 min; and ending with 68 °C for 7 min. The resulting PCR products were purified using the Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), resuspended in a final volume of 50 μl of distilled H2O, and sequenced using primer pNL1. Quantitation of Relative Fitness—RT-PCR products derived from culture supernatants were directly sequenced as mixed pools without subcloning, and the resulting chromatogram tracings were used to determine the relative frequencies of mutant and wild type genomes at different passage intervals. Peaks that unambiguously represented the wild type sequence were identified at specific nucleotide positions for each motif B codon (except Gly152, Trp153, and Gln161; see legend to Fig. 4B). Wild type and mutant peak heights were measured at the informative nucleotide position of each codon and used to calculate relative fitness (43Holland J.J. de la Torre J.C. Clarke D.K. Duarte E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2960-2967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the expression fn = Mn/(Wn + Mn), where fn is the relative frequency of mutants at passage n, W represents the peak height for the wild type nucleotide, and M is the sum of all mutant peak heights at the informative nucleotide position. fn/f1 ratios were plotted as a function of passage number, and the slopes of the resulting fitness vectors were calculated by linear regression (Statview 4.0). The F test was used to determine whether these slopes were significantly different from the neutral case (slope = 0). Drug Susceptibility Assays—Virus suceptibilities to 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT; Sigma) and (-)-β-2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine (3TC; kindly provided by Dr. Raymond Schinazi, Emory University) were determined by measuring the dose-dependent reduction of infected foci in 96-well HeLa-P4 microcultures. HeLa-P4 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 0.5 × 104 cells/well and incubated overnight. The following morning, culture wells were dosed with varying concentrations of AZT or 3TC, and plates were then returned to the incubator for an additional 3 h. During this period, virus stocks were diluted to 4000 FFU/ml in DMEM containing 20 μg/ml DEAE-dextran. Supernatants in the m"
