Yet, pDC responses to certain single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses occur only after live viral infection. We present evidence here that the recognition of such viruses by TLR7 requires transport of cytosolic viral replication intermediates into the lysosome by the process of autophagy. In addition, autophagy was found to be required for the production of interferon-α by pDCs. These results support a key role for autophagy in mediating ssRNA virus detection and interferon-α secretion by pDCs and suggest that cytosolic replication intermediates of viruses serve as pathogen signatures recognized by TLR7."
https://openalex.org/W1985982697,"Predictions of ecological response to climate change are based largely on direct climatic effects on species. We show that, in a California grassland, species interactions strongly influence responses to changing climate, overturning direct climatic effects within 5 years. We manipulated the seasonality and intensity of rainfall over large, replicate plots in accordance with projections of leading climate models and examined responses across several trophic levels. Changes in seasonal water availability had pronounced effects on individual species, but as precipitation regimes were sustained across years, feedbacks and species interactions overrode autecological responses to water and reversed community trajectories. Conditions that sharply increased production and diversity through 2 years caused simplification of the food web and deep reductions in consumer abundance after 5 years. Changes in these natural grassland communities suggest a prominent role for species interactions in ecosystem response to climate change."

All known drugs of this class are 5-HT2A receptor (2AR) agonists, yet closely related 2AR agonists such as lisuride lack comparable psychoactive properties. Why only certain 2AR agonists are hallucinogens and which neural circuits mediate their effects are poorly understood. By genetically expressing 2AR only in cortex, we show that 2AR-regulated pathways on cortical neurons are sufficient to mediate the signaling pattern and behavioral response to hallucinogens. Hallucinogenic and nonhallucinogenic 2AR agonists both regulate signaling in the same 2AR-expressing cortical neurons. However, the signaling and behavioral responses to the hallucinogens are distinct. While lisuride and LSD both act at 2AR expressed by cortex neurons to regulate phospholipase C, LSD responses also involve pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric Gi/o proteins and Src. These studies identify the long-elusive neural and signaling mechanisms responsible for the unique effects of hallucinogens.

Throughout history, naturally occurring hallucinogenic substances such as psilocybin and mescaline have been recognized for their capacity to alter perception, emotion, and cognition (Nichols, 2004Nichols D.E. Hallucinogens.Pharmacol. Ther. 2004; 101: 131-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). All such hallucinogenic compounds (HCs) exhibit high affinity for 5-HT2A receptors (2AR) (Gonzalez-Maeso and Sealfon, 2006Gonzalez-Maeso J. Sealfon S.

Genetic or pharmacological inactivation of 2AR signaling blocks the behavioral effects of HCs in a variety of species, including mice, rats, and humans (Fiorella et al., 1995Fiorella D. Helsley S.

Taken together, these findings indicate that 2AR activation is necessary for the psychoactive effects of HCs. The demonstration that HCs elicit their psychoactive effects via 2AR activation has not resolved the fundamental paradox that 2AR activation is a universally shared property of HCs and that 2AR activation is required for HC effects, but yet not all 2AR agonists exhibit hallucinogenic activity. Indeed, nonhallucinogenic compounds (NHCs) such as lisuride and ergotamine share significant structural similarities and comparable agonist activities at 2AR (Egan et al., 1998Egan C.T. Herrick-Davis K. Miller K. Glennon R.A. Teitler M.

Several of these structures have also been implicated in HC effects (Nielsen and Scheel-Kruger, 1986Nielsen E.B. Scheel-Kruger J.

However, the neuronal substrates that mediate hallucinogen effects remain obscure. Our previous study of two HCs, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI), suggests the hypothesis that HCs induce a characteristic, 2AR-dependent regulation of gene expression in mouse somatosensory cortex (SSC) (Gonzalez-Maeso et al., 2003Gonzalez-Maeso J. Yuen T. Ebersole B.J. Wurmbach E. Lira A. Zhou M. Weisstaub N. Hen R. Gingrich J.A. Sealfon S.C. Transcriptome fingerprints distinguish hallucinogenic and nonhallucinogenic 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor agonist effects in mouse somatosensory cortex.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8836-8843PubMed Google Scholar). By extending our previous biochemical studies to a large group of diverse chemicals, we provide a basis for predicting hallucinogenic potential from effects in mouse. We find that HC and NHC 2AR agonists differ in their regulation of signaling and physiology in the same neurons in vivo and in vitro. By using a genetic strategy to restore specifically 2AR-signaling capacity to cortical neurons in htr2A−/− mice, we show that the unique signaling and neurobehavioral effects of HCs do not result from their previously proposed regulation of subcortical-cortical circuits, but are intrinsic to 2AR-expressing cortical pyramidal neurons. We formulate a new model for the mechanism of action of HCs. The responses to HC and NHC 2AR agonists have predominantly been studied in rats, primates, and humans. The effects of these drugs in mice have been less well studied. Because hallucinogens require 2AR activation, we sought to verify that HCs and NHCs exhibit affinities to mouse 2AR that are comparable with those seen in other experimental models. When assayed by displacement of [3H]ketanserin from membranes prepared from mouse cortex (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data), all agonists displayed affinities that were consistent with rat and human values (Hoyer et al., 1994Hoyer D. Clarke D.E. Fozard J.R. Hartig P.R. Martin G.R. Mylecharane E.J. Saxena P.R. Humphrey P.P. International Union of Pharmacology classification of receptors for 5-hydroxytryptamine (Serotonin).Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 157-203PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the 2AR signaling system in mice presents a tractable model system to study the effects of HCs. Behavioral animal models cannot capture the perturbations of perception, cognition, and mood produced by HCs in humans. However, rodents might exhibit behavioral proxies of human hallucinogenic effects. Systemic administration of HCs in rats and nonhuman primates elicits several unconditioned effects: changes in exploratory behavior (Adams and Geyer, 1985aAdams L.M.

Screening hallucinogenic drugs: systematic study of three behavioral tests.Psychopharmacologia. 1975; 42: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To identify a mouse model of acute hallucinogenic potential, we examined a variety of responses produced by several HCs and NHCs (Figure S2). Among the behavioral measures assayed, only two were elicited by HCs and not NHCs: the ESR and HTR. Other measures such as locomotion, rearing, grooming, and basal body temperature changes were inconsistently affected by HCs and NHCs (Figure S2 and Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplemental Data). The HTR and ESR were both dependent upon the presence of 2AR signaling capacity, even at a high dose of DOI (Figure S2). However, the ESR was not elicited by every HC and was not normally distributed among individual mice—proving to be an “all or nothing” response. In contrast, HTR was reliably and robustly elicited by all HCs tested. Furthermore, HTR was not produced by NHCs, and was absent in htr2A−/− mice. All 2AR agonists studied [DOI, 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOM), 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenyl)-2-aminopropane DOB (DOB), psilocin, mescaline, LSD, ergotamine, R-lisuride, and S-lisuride] penetrate the CNS after systemic administration. However, only the drugs with hallucinogenic potential in humans (Nichols, 2004Nichols D.E. Hallucinogens.Pharmacol. Ther. 2004; 101: 131-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) activated a significant HTR in htr2A+/+ mice, but not in htr2A−/− mice (Figure 1A). The NHC 2AR agonists (ergotamine, R-lisuride, and S-lisuride) were inactive in both genotypes (Figure 1A). Thus, the HTR was used as a mouse behavioral proxy of human hallucinogenic potential in subsequent studies. Consistent with psychoactive effects of certain 2AR agonists in humans, the HTR was produced only by the HCs, a subset of drugs with 2AR agonist properties. To explain this finding, we reasoned that HCs might interact with 2AR to recruit specific signaling pathways not activated by NHCs. To test this hypothesis, we compared HC- and NHC-activation of multiple signal transduction pathways. Because signal transduction cascades ultimately regulate gene transcription (Ruf and Sealfon, 2004Ruf F. Sealfon S.C. Genomics view of gonadotrope signaling circuits.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 15: 331-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we assessed HC and NHC signaling by measuring the “downstream” transcriptome responses elicited by HCs and NHCs in mouse SSC, a responsive and reliable tissue for assessing the cellular responses of HCs (Gonzalez-Maeso et al., 2003Gonzalez-Maeso J. Yuen T. Ebersole B.J. Wurmbach E. Lira A. Zhou M. Weisstaub N. Hen R. Gingrich J.A. Sealfon S.C. Transcriptome fingerprints distinguish hallucinogenic and nonhallucinogenic 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor agonist effects in mouse somatosensory cortex.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8836-8843PubMed Google Scholar, Scruggs et al., 2000Scruggs J.L. Patel S. Bubser M. Deutch A.Y. DOI-Induced activation of the cortex: dependence on 5-HT2A heteroceptors on thalamocortical glutamatergic neurons.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8846-8852PubMed Google Scholar). We quantified the in vivo induction of 19 transcripts regulated by HCs and NHCs in htr2A+/+ and htr2A−/− mice (Tables S3 and S4). Each agonist elicited a differential and reproducible response. To assess the predictive value of these gene induction responses on behavior, we used principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce a 19-dimensional signaling space (reflected by gene transcripts) to two axes (Figure 1B). Plotted in this way, the transcriptome responses of HCs and NHCs predicted their behavioral effects in htr2A+/+ and htr2A−/− mice and their hallucinogenic potential in human (Figure 1B). We selected the most informative signaling response markers for distinguishing 2AR activation, as well as HC from NHC by statistical significance (Tables S5 and S6). Regulation of c-fos tracked with agonist activity at 2AR, and induction of egr-2 and egr-1 most robustly predicted behavioral activity of HCs in mouse (Figure 1C and Tables S7 and S8). The effects of HCs and NHCs on transcriptome activation indicated that these compounds interact with 2AR to activate distinct signaling pathways. This interpretation implies that the genes induced by HCs and NHCs should be regulated in neurons expressing 2AR. To test this idea, we prepared primary cultures of cortical neurons from htr2A+/+ and htr2A−/− mouse embryos. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), we found that both LSD and R-lisuride induced c-fos expression in neurons expressing 2AR mRNA, while only LSD (but not R-lisuride) induced egr-2 expression in 2AR-expressing neurons (Figures 2A and 2B). FISH studies of primary cultures derived from htr2A−/− mice showed no induction of these transcripts by LSD or R-lisuride. We also studied the role of neuronal action potentials in HC signaling by determining transcriptome responses in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX). The suppression of cell firing by TTX did not affect the activation of gene transcripts in cortical primary culture, thus indicating that neuronal circuitry could not be involved in the induction of egr-1 and egr-2 mRNAs. This result indicates that LSD activation of egr-1 and egr-2 is intrinsic to neurons with 2AR signaling capacity (Figure S3). We next used FISH to study whether the different HC and NHC 2AR-mediated responses also occurred in the same neurons in vivo. Consistent with other studies (Lopez-Gimenez et al., 2001Lopez-Gimenez J.F. Vilaro M.T. Palacios J.M. Mengod G. Mapping of 5-HT2A receptors and their mRNA in monkey brain: [3H]MDL100,907 autoradiography and in situ hybridization studies.J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 429: 571-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), 2AR expression was most intense in layer V (Figures 2C and 2D), and was also observed in layers II/III (Figures S4 and S5). The 2AR agonist marker c-fos was induced in layers II/III and V by both LSD and R-lisuride. Nearly all c-fos-positive cells expressed 2AR mRNA (Figure 2C and Figure S5). LSD induced the HC-specific marker egr-2 in layer V 2AR-positive neurons (Figure 2D), but not in layers II/III (data not shown). R-lisuride did not induce egr-2 in SSC. No induction of c-fos or egr-2 was observed in htr2A−/− mice injected with either LSD or R-lisuride (Figure S6). To establish that the different response patterns obtained with HCs and NHCs could not be explained by differences in drug efficacy, we examined the induction of several transcripts in vitro and in vivo in response to a range of LSD and R-lisuride doses. As seen in Figure 3, R-lisuride induced c-fos at doses ranging from 1 to 10 μM in vitro and 0.4 to 0.8 mg/kg in vivo. R-lisuride did not induce egr-1 or egr-2 at any dose tested. In contrast, LSD induced c-fos, egr-1, and egr-2 at doses ranging from 1 to 10 μM in vitro and from 0.24 to 0.96 mg/kg in vivo. These data show that R-lisuride cannot induce egr-1 or egr-2 at drug doses up to 10-fold greater than those sufficient to induce c-fos. Transcriptome regulation was absent at all doses tested in htr2A−/− mice and primary cortical cultures from htr2A−/− mice. To determine whether the HC-signaling signature reflects distinct changes in neuronal physiology, we examined the HC and NHC effects on voltage-gated currents in SSC slices prepared from htr2A+/+ and htr2A−/− mice. We used standard whole-cell patch-clamp recordings on individual layer V pyramidal neurons to study the voltage-gated currents in the pyramidal neurons in the presence of TTX. A voltage ramp from −110 mV to −30 mV activated a wide range of ionic currents in these cells that was altered by the application of HCs in most of the cells from htr2A+/+ and htr2A−/− mice. Since the changes in current were heterogeneous, we subtracted the HC responses from baseline responses in the same neuron (Figure 4B and Figure S7). The resulting HC-induced responses were divided into three groups based on their magnitude: small (including no change), medium, and large (see Table S9). Small and medium currents were observed in cells from both htr2A+/+ and htr2A−/− mice, indicating that they were 2AR-independent. However, large currents were only observed in cells from htr2A+/+ mice treated with LSD (Figures 4B and 4D and Table S9). These LSD-induced large currents were seen in approximately 25% of the cells tested, and exhibited an average charge of 334 ± 97 C and a reversal potential of −67.5 ± 2.4 mV, suggesting that they represented the sum of several different currents. This large current was never observed with R-lisuride (Figures 4C and 4D). Our findings demonstrate that both LSD and R-lisuride require a functional 2AR to generate their signaling profiles. R-lisuride displaces [125I]LSD with high affinity from 2AR-expressing membrane preparations (Figure 4A), suggesting that they compete for the same binding site. However, we reasoned that it is possible that LSD and R-lisuride might interact with receptor targets other than 2AR, which would explain their distinct effects on signaling and behavior. To test this possibility, we first studied whether R-lisuride demonstrated competitive and/or additive effects with LSD in different measures. We found that R-lisuride blocked the LSD-induced large currents in SSC neurons (Figures 4C and 4D). Furthermore, we observed that pretreatment of mice with R-lisuride prevented LSD-mediated induction of egr-1 and egr-2 in vivo, whereas the induction of c-fos was unaffected (Figure 4E). The combined effects of LSD and R-lisuride administration on c-fos induction were not additive, a result incompatible with a model where each drug stimulates c-fos through different receptors. Furthermore, LSD-induced HTR (Figure 4F) was prevented when the animals were first pretreated with R-lisuride. These pharmacological data suggest that R-lisuride and LSD target the same population of 2AR to induce distinct effects on electrophysiology, intracellular signaling, and behavior. Lisuride is not simply a 2AR agonist, but also interacts with a variety of central monoamine receptors, including dopamine and 5-HT1A receptors. These other receptors have been proposed as candidates targeted by lisuride that may integrate with 2AR signaling to prevent the induction of hallucinogenic response (Callahan and Appel, 1990Callahan P.M.

In order to evaluate the potential role of dopaminergic receptors in the modulation of the responses to LSD elicited by R-lisuride, we tested the cellular response in SSC in vivo and the behavioral response induced by LSD after preinjection with SKF82958 or quinpirole, D1-like and D2-like receptor agonists, respectively. Neither of the dopaminergic agonists alone induced egr-1 or egr-2 in mouse cortex (Figure 5A), nor did they affect HTR (Figure 5B). The expression of c-fos was unaffected by quinpirole, whereas c-fos was induced by SKF82958 (Figure 5A). The combined effects of SKF82958 and LSD administration on c-fos induction were additive, which was opposite to the effects of coadministration of R-lisuride and LSD (see above). When combined with LSD, neither SKF82958 nor quinpirole affected the induction of the HC-specific egr-1 or egr-2 genes (Figure 5A). Furthermore, the LSD-induced HTR was not affected by either SKF82958 or quinpirole (Figure 5B). These results suggest that the effects of LSD and lisuride arise from interaction with the same 2AR target, and that their effects do not result from activity at dopamine receptors. Lisuride is a full agonist in modulation of [35S]GTPγS binding in membranes of CHO cells expressing 5-HT1A receptors (McLoughlin and Strange, 2000McLoughlin D.J. Strange P.G. Mechanisms of agonism and inverse agonism at serotonin 5-HT1A receptors.J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Several behavioral assays have also confirmed the high efficacy of lisuride at 5-HT1A receptors (Millan et al., 1991Millan M.J. Bervoets K. Colpaert F.C. 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A receptors and the tail-flick response. I. 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin HBr-induced spontaneous tail-flicks in the rat as an in vivo model of 5-HT1A receptor-mediated activity.J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Biochem. Behav. 1998; 59: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that coactivation of 5-HT1A receptors (htr1A) and 2AR by lisuride could explain why lisuride acts as a 2AR agonist, yet lacks hallucinogenic properties (Marona-Lewicka et al., 2002Marona-Lewicka D. Kurrasch-Orbaugh D.M. Selken J.R. Cumbay M.G. Lisnicchia J.G. Nichols D.E.

We tested this hypothesis by examining the behavioral effects of LSD and R-lisuride in htr1A+/+ and htr1A−/− mice. Because both of these compounds are 2AR agonists, coactivation of 5-HT1A receptors by LSD or R-lisuride should attenuate their hallucinogenic properties. Thus, the behavioral responses to each compound should be augmented in the htr1A−/− mice. As shown in Figure 5C, this was not the case. There was no significant effect of genotype on the behavioral response to either R-lisuride or LSD. Taken together, our results suggest that neither dopamine nor 5-HT1A receptor activation functionally antagonize 2AR-dependent effects mediated by R-lisuride, and indicate that R-lisuride and LSD interact with the same molecular target to induce distinct effects on electrophysiology, intracellular signaling, and behavior. HCs and NHCs induce different transcriptome responses in cortical neurons that express 2AR. We next investigated the signaling cascade responsible for the unique transcriptional responses elicited by HCs. 2AR activates phospholipase C-β (PLC-β) via heterotrimeric Gq/11 proteins, leading to increased accumulation of inositol phosphates and intracellular calcium mobilization (Barnes and Sharp, 1999Barnes N.M. Sharp T. A review of central 5-HT receptors and their function.Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1083-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (2607) Google Scholar). We first examined the role of this pathway in the HC-specific responses in primary cortical cultures by studying the gene responses after pretreatment with the PLC-β inhibitor U73122. Inhibition of PLC-β eliminated the gene response obtained by either LSD or R-lisuride (Figure 6A). These results suggest that the classical Gq/11-PLC-β 2AR signaling pathway is required for the response to HCs, but is not unique and specific to HCs. We previously discovered that the neuroprotective effects of some agonists acting at the dopamine D2 receptor result from the capacity of these agonists to regulate a signaling pathway in addition to the classical Gi/o protein pathway that is known to couple with that receptor (Nair and Sealfon, 2003Nair V.D. Sealfon S.C. Agonist specific transactivation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathway mediated by the dopamine D2 receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 47 (Published online September 11, 2003): 47053-47061https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M303364200Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The classical PLC-β response is regulated by both HCs and NHCs acting at 2ARs. HCs elicit unique 2AR-dependent gene, signaling pattern, and behavioral responses (see above). We speculated that the HC 2AR complexes might cause regulation of an additional signaling pathway that is not affected by NHC 2AR complexes. Some reports have implicated pertussis toxin- (PTX-) sensitive Gi/o proteins in the cellular responses mediated by 2AR (Kurrasch-Orbaugh et al., 2003Kurrasch-Orbaugh D.M. Parrish J.C. Watts V.J.

To explore the consequences of Gi/o protein inhibition on the 2AR-induced transcriptome changes, the cortical primary cultures were pretreated with PTX. While PTX did not affect the gene responses to R-lisuride, it greatly attenuated the responses elicited by LSD (Figure 6B). These results suggest that the gene response elicited by LSD requires a coactivation of Gi/o and Gq/11 proteins that is unique to HCs. In several cell types, Gi/o protein-regulated phosphorylation networks involve Gβγ subunit-mediated activation of Src (Banes et al., 1999Banes A. Florian J.A. Watts S.W.

Here, we show that only a modest change in the 1918 influenza hemagglutinin receptor binding site alters the transmissibility of this pandemic virus. Two amino acid mutations that cause a switch in receptor binding preference from the human α-2,6 to the avian α-2,3 sialic acid resulted in a virus incapable of respiratory droplet transmission between ferrets but that maintained its lethality and replication efficiency in the upper respiratory tract. Furthermore, poor transmission of a 1918 virus with dual α-2,6 and α-2,3 specificity suggests that a predominant human α-2,6 sialic acid binding preference is essential for optimal transmission of this pandemic virus. These findings confirm an essential role of hemagglutinin receptor specificity for the transmission of influenza viruses among mammals."

The appearance of marker bands in the time-resolved spectra indicates that the dimers are fully formed ∼1 picosecond after ultraviolet excitation. The ultrafast appearance of this mutagenic photolesion points to an excited-state reaction that is approximately barrierless for bases that are properly oriented at the instant of light absorption. The low quantum yield of this photoreaction is proposed to result from infrequent conformational states in the unexcited polymer, revealing a strong link between conformation before light absorption and photodamage."
https://openalex.org/W2094919375,"Decisions based on the timing of sensory events are fundamental to sensory processing. However, the mechanisms by which the brain measures time over ranges of milliseconds to seconds remain unclear. The dominant model of temporal processing proposes that an oscillator emits events that are integrated to provide a linear metric of time. We examine an alternate model in which cortical networks are inherently able to tell time as a result of time-dependent changes in network state. Using computer simulations we show that within this framework, there is no linear metric of time, and that a given interval is encoded in the context of preceding events. Human psychophysical studies were used to examine the predictions of the model. Our results provide theoretical and experimental evidence that, for short intervals, there is no linear metric of time, and that time may be encoded in the high-dimensional state of local neural networks."
https://openalex.org/W2002285022,"The 66-kilodalton isoform of the growth factor adapter Shc (p66 Shc ) translates oxidative damage into cell death by acting as reactive oxygen species (ROS) producer within mitochondria. However, the signaling link between cellular stress and mitochondrial proapoptotic activity of p66 Shc was not known. We demonstrate that protein kinase C β, activated by oxidative conditions in the cell, induces phosphorylation of p66 Shc and triggers mitochondrial accumulation of the protein after it is recognized by the prolyl isomerase Pin1. Once imported, p66 Shc causes alterations of mitochondrial Ca 2+ responses and three-dimensional structure, thus inducing apoptosis. These data identify a signaling route that activates an apoptotic inducer shortening the life span and could be a potential target of pharmacological approaches to inhibit aging."
https://openalex.org/W2018051749,"Plants constantly monitor environmental fluctuations to optimize their growth and metabolism. One example is adaptive growth occurring in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Here, we demonstrate that GH3-mediated auxin homeostasis is an essential constituent of the complex network of auxin actions that regulates stress adaptation responses in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Endogenous auxin pool is regulated, at least in part, through negative feedback by a group of auxin-inducible <i>GH3</i> genes encoding auxin-conjugating enzymes. An <i>Arabidopsis</i> mutant, <i>wes1-D</i>, in which a <i>GH3</i> gene <i>WES1</i> is activated by nearby insertion of the <sup>35</sup>S enhancer, exhibited auxin-deficient traits, including reduced growth and altered leaf shape. Interestingly, <i>WES1</i> is also induced by various stress conditions as well as by salicylic acid and abscisic acid. Accordingly, <i>wes1-D</i> was resistant to both biotic and abiotic stresses, and stress-responsive genes, such as pathogenesis-related genes and <i>CBF</i> genes, were upregulated in this mutant. In contrast, a T-DNA insertional mutant showed reduced stress resistance. We therefore propose that GH3-mediated growth suppression directs reallocation of metabolic resources to resistance establishment and represents the fitness costs of induced resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2088853419,"Posttranslational modifications of the histone octamer play important roles in regulating responses to DNA damage. Here, we reveal that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rtt109p promotes genome stability and resistance to DNA-damaging agents, and that it does this by functionally cooperating with the histone chaperone Asf1p to maintain normal chromatin structure. Furthermore, we show that, as for Asf1p, Rtt109p is required for histone H3 acetylation on lysine 56 (K56) in vivo. Moreover, we show that Rtt109p directly catalyzes this modification in vitro in a manner that is stimulated by Asf1p. These data establish Rtt109p as a member of a new class of histone acetyltransferases and show that its actions are critical for cell survival in the presence of DNA damage during S phase."

However, the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that catalyzes global H3-K56 acetylation has not been found. Here we show that regulation of Ty1 transposition gene product 109 (Rtt109) is an H3-K56 HAT. Cells lacking Rtt109 or expressing rtt109 mutants with alterations at a conserved aspartate residue lose H3-K56 acetylation and exhibit increased sensitivity toward genotoxic agents, as well as elevated levels of spontaneous chromosome breaks. Thus, Rtt109, which shares no sequence homology with any other known HATs, is a unique HAT that acetylates H3-K56."
https://openalex.org/W2024970900,"Dengue virus (DV) is a positive sense RNA virus replicating in the cytoplasm in membranous compartments that are induced by viral infection. The non-structural protein (NS) 4A is one of the least characterized DV proteins. It is highly hydrophobic with its C-terminal region (designated 2K fragment) serving as a signal sequence for the translocation of the adjacent NS4B into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. In this report, we demonstrate that NS4A associates with membranes via 4 internal hydrophobic regions, which are all able to mediate membrane targeting of a cytosolic reporter protein. We also developed a model for the membrane topology of NS4A in which the N-terminal third of NS4A localizes to the cytoplasm, while the remaining part contains three transmembrane segments, with the C-terminal end localized in the ER lumen. Subcellular localization experiments in DV-infected cells revealed that NS4A resides primarily in ER-derived cytoplasmic dot-like structures that also contain dsRNA and other DV proteins, suggesting that NS4A is a component of the membrane-bound viral replication complex (RC). Interestingly, the individual expression of DV NS4A lacking the 2K fragment resulted in the induction of cytoplasmic membrane alterations resembling virus-induced structures, whereas expression of full-length NS4A does not induce comparable membrane alterations. Thus, proteolytic removal of the 2K peptide appears to be important for induction of membrane alterations that may harbor the viral RC. These results shed new light on the role of NS4A in the DV replication cycle and provide a model of how this protein induces membrane rearrangements and how this property may be regulated.

More than 50–100 million cases of dengue fever are reported annually in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, where the mosquito vectors Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are endemic. Of these patients, ∼1% develop more severe and often lethal symptoms called dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome (1Gubler D.J. Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 100-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). Flaviviruses are enveloped viruses that contain a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity ∼11 kb in length. This RNA contains a type I cap at its 5′-terminus (2Cleaves G.R. Dubin D.T. Virology. 1979; 96: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and is translated by the host cell translation machinery in close association with cellular membranes, giving rise to the 3391-amino acid long polyprotein. The structural components of the virus (proteins C, prM, and E; see Fig. 1A) are encoded in the 5′ one-fourth of the genome, whereas the non-structural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5; see Fig. 1A) are encoded in the remainder of the genome (3Chambers T.J. Hahn C.S. Galler R. Rice C.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). Processing of the polyprotein into the individual components is carried out by a combination of different host cell enzymes and the cytoplasmic viral NS2B-3 protease complex (4Amberg S.M. Nestorowicz A. McCourt D.W. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3794-3802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cahour A. Falgout B. Lai C.J. J.

In addition to its protease activity NS3 also contains an RNA helicase and nucleotide triphosphatase activity important for the replication of the viral RNA (7Warrener P. Tamura J.K. Collett M.S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 989-996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wengler G. Czaya G. Farber P.M. Hegemann J.H. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), which seems to occur in close association with virus-induced cellular membrane structures designated viral replication complexes (RCs) (9Mackenzie J.M. Khromykh A.A. Jones M.K. Westaway E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 10Westaway E.G. Mackenzie J.M. Kenney M.T. Jones M.K. Khromykh A.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6650-6661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the other NS proteins seem to be directly or indirectly involved in viral RNA replication as well. NS5 is a multifunctional protein containing an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity and a methyltransferase activity involved in capping of progeny viral RNA genomes (11Koonin E.V. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 12Tan B.H. Fu J. Sugrue R.J. Yap E.H. Chan Y.C. Tan Y.H. Virology. 1996; 216: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The role of NS1 in viral replication is not understood as yet, but it has been reported that mutations in NS1 affected the initiation of minus-strand RNA synthesis (13Lindenbach B.D. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9608-9617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Muylaert I.R. Galler R. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 291-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Not much is known about the functions of the hydrophobic flavivirus proteins NS2A, NS4A, and NS4B. It has been suggested that they contribute to the inhibition of the interferon-α/β (IFN-α/β) response (15Guo J.T. Hayashi J. Seeger C. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 1343-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 16Liu W.J. Wang X.J. Mokhonov V.V. Shi P.Y. Randall R. Khromykh A.A. J.

A. 2003; 100: 14333-14338Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NS2A may target the viral RC to membrane organelles (9Mackenzie J.M. Khromykh A.A. Jones M.K. Westaway E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and NS4B may modulate viral replication via an interaction with NS3 (19Umareddy I. Chao A. Sampath A. Gu F. Vasudevan S.G. J. Gen. Virol. 2006; 87: 2605-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus far, the small hydrophobic protein NS4A (∼16 kDa) is only poorly characterized, and its proper function for the viral replication cycle is still unknown. The observations that Kunjin virus (KUNV) NS4A localizes to the presumed sites of RNA replication and polyprotein processing (9Mackenzie J.M. Khromykh A.A. Jones M.K. Westaway E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and that an interaction between NS4A and NS1 is required for RNA replication (20Lindenbach B.D. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4611-4621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that flavivirus NS4A is involved in some steps of viral RNA amplification, perhaps by anchoring replicase components to intracellular membranes. The N terminus of NS4A is generated in the cytoplasm by the viral two-component protease NS2B-3, whereas the C-terminal 23 amino acid residues of NS4A seem to act as a signal sequence for the translocation of NS4B into the lumen of the ER (see Fig. 1A). This signal sequence (designated the 2K fragment) is removed from the N terminus of NS4B by the host signalase in the ER lumen. Signalase cleavage at the 2K-4B site requires a prior NS2B-3 protease-mediated cleavage at the so called 4A/2K site just N-terminal of the 2K fragment (21Lin C. Amberg S.M. Chambers T.J. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2327-2335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that the KUNV NS4A-2K precursor can induce intracellular membrane rearrangements, which may form the scaffold for the viral RC (22Roosendaal J. Westaway E.G. Khromykh A. Mackenzie J.M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 4623-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet clear how NS4A associates with cellular membranes, or how it induces membrane rearrangements. Answering these questions requires characterization of the NS4A membrane topology and intracellular targeting. In this report, we investigated the subcellular localization of DV NS4A and characterized both its membrane association and membrane topology in detail. Our experiments clearly show that DV NS4A is part of the viral RC and colocalizes with other viral proteins and RNA. We developed a model of the NS4A membrane topology, which could explain how this protein induces membrane alterations in a regulated manner. Cells and Viruses—Cell monolayers of the human hepatoma cell line Huh-7 (23Nakabayashi H. Taketa K. Miyano K. Yamane T. Sato J. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 3858-3863PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, non-essential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calfserum (DMEM complete). Huh-7/T7 cells, constitutively expressing the T7-RNA-polymerase (24Appel N. Pietschmann T. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3187-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), were grown under the same conditions, but 5 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) were added to the medium. For the infection of Huh-7 cells, the DV2 (New Guinea C strain; kindly provided by Progen Biotechnik GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) was used at a multiplicity of infection of 2–4. The virus was diluted in DMEM containing 2% fetal calf serum, and cells were incubated for 4 h at 37°C with occasional rocking. After 4 h, the inoculum was replaced by complete DMEM, and cells were incubated for various times. Transfection—DNA constructs were transfected into Huh-7/T7 cells using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Antibodies—The following primary antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-dsRNA antibody (English & Scientific Consulting, Szirak, Hungary), rabbit polyclonal calreticulin- and calnexin-specific antibodies (both Stressgen, Victoria, Canada), mouse monoclonal anti-p230 and mouse monoclonal anti-GM130 antibody (both obtained from BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany), rabbit anti-GFP antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), mouse monoclonal anti-DV2 E-antibody (ATCC), and mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). The secondary antibodies used in immunofluorescence microscopy were goat antibodies conjugated to AlexaFluor 546 and AlexaFluor 488 (Molecular Probes). Cellular DNA was stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI; Molecular Probes). The secondary antibodies used in Western blot analyses were mouse or rabbit secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). For the generation of the anti-NS4A antiserum New Zealand White Rabbits were immunized with a mixture of synthetic DV NS4A-specific peptides over a period of 3 months. For immunofluorescence studies, the obtained monospecific polyclonal antisera were purified by affinity purification as described previously (25Miller S. Sparacio S. Bartenschlager R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; Google Scholar). Plasmid Constructs—Standard molecular biology techniques were used for cloning (26Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). All plasmids were confirmed by restriction and sequence analysis using an ABI 310 sequencer and the Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing kit version 1.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City). The full-length DV2 NGC strain cDNA (a kind gift from Andrew Davidson, School of Medical Sciences, Bristol, UK) served as a template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based amplification of the required DV genes. A previously described modified version of pTM-eGFP (25Miller S. Sparacio S. Bartenschlager R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; Google Scholar) served as the vector for the generation of pTM-NS4A-eGFP fusion constructs expressing different NS4A fragments fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). The restriction sites NcoI and AgeI were used for the insertion of PCR fragments encoding for the different NS4A regions. For the construction of pTM-eGFP-glyc encoding an N-glycosylation acceptor site (Asn-Ser-Thr-Ser-Ala) fused in-frame to the C terminus of eGFP, eGFP-glyc was amplified by PCR using the modified pTM-eGFP as a template, the sense primer 5′-CACGATAATACCATGGCAGCG-3′, and the antisense primer 5′-TGCTAGTACTAGTTAGGCGAGGTCGAATTCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCG-3′. The obtained PCR fragment was digested with AgeI and SpeI and inserted into pTM-eGFP digested with the same restriction enzymes. PCR fragments encoding for the different NS4A regions were amplified using appropriate oligonucleotides and inserted into pTM-eGFP or pTM-eGFP-glyc via the restriction sites NcoI and AgeI. For the generation of pTM expression constructs encoding for NS4A either containing or lacking the 2K sequence the corresponding regions were amplified by PCR and inserted into pTM (27Moss B. Elroy-Stein O. Mizukami T. Alexander W.A. Fuerst T.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 91-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) using the restriction sites NcoI and SpeI. Microscopy—Confocal fluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (25Miller S. Sparacio S. Bartenschlager R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; Google Scholar). For cryoimmuno-EM transfected Huh-7/T7 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in PHEM buffer (240 mm Pipes, 100 mm Hepes, 8 mm MgCl2,40mm EGTA; pH 6.9). Cells were scraped off the dish, pelleted, and incubated in 2.3 m sucrose overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, cell pellets were mounted on silver pins, flash-frozen, and stored in liquid nitrogen. The specimens were sectioned with a Reichert Ultracut S ultramicrotome with a Reichert FCS cryoattachment using a Diatome diamond knife (Diatome, Biel, Switzerland). Immunocytochemical labeling of thawed cryosections was performed as described by Griffiths et al. (28Griffiths G. Simons K. Warren G. Tokuyasu K.T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 466-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). EM specimens were examined using a Zeiss 10C transmission electron microscope. Membrane Floatation and Membrane Dissociation Assay— Cells were transfected or infected as described above. At 8-h post-transfection or 24-h postinfection, cells were harvested, and membrane floatation or dissociation assays were performed as described previously (25Miller S. Sparacio S. Bartenschlager R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; Google Scholar). In brief, Nycodenz (Axis Shield, Oslo, Norway) was added to postnuclear cell lysates to a final concentration of 37.5% (w/v), loaded under a 5% to 35% Nycodenz discontinuous gradient, and centrifuged to equilibrium in a Beckmann TLS-55 swing-bucket rotor at 100,000 × g for 20 h. After centrifugation, fractions were collected from the top to the bottom of the density gradient. Equal volumes of samples from each fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described above. For membrane dissociation assays, postnuclear lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min to pellet membranes and their associated proteins. Pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 1 m NaCl, 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.5, or 1% Triton X-100, incubated on ice for 30 min, and fractionated in Nycodenz gradients as described above. Western Blot Analysis—Samples were loaded onto a 12% polyacrylamide-SDS gel, and proteins were electrophoretically separated. After transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose membrane, blots were incubated in blocking solution (5% milk powder and 0.5% Tween 20 in PBS) overnight at 4 °C. Incubation with the primary antibody was performed in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were washed three times for 10 min in washing solution (0.5% Tween 20 in PBS), incubated for 1 h with the secondary antibody in blocking solution, and washed again in the same way. Antibody-protein complexes were detected using the ECL™ plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Metabolic Labeling, Immunoprecipitation, and Deglycosylation— Four hours after transfection of 5 × 105 Huh-7/T7 cells, they were washed, incubated for 30 min in DMEM without methionine and cysteine, and subsequently incubated for 3–6 h in the same medium containing 100 μCi of [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine per ml (Expre35S35S protein labeling mix; PerkinElmer, Boston). Cells were then washed two times with PBS, and eGFP-fusion proteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation from cell lysates. In brief, cells were lysed with 1 ml of NPB (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), centrifuged for 15 min at 20,000 × g, and supernatants were incubated overnight with a polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP antibody coupled to protein-G-Sepharose beads. After several washes with NPB, deglycosylation was performed with a fraction of the immunocomplex using PNGase F (New England Biolabs, Schwalbach, Germany) as recommended by the manufacturer. Beads were resuspended in protein sample buffer, boiled 5 min at 95 °C, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Protein Sequence Analyses and Transmembrane Segment (TMS) Prediction—Protein sequence analyses were performed with the following programs: ConPredII, TMAP, TMHMM II, TMpred, and SOSUI. DV NS4A Localizes to the Putative Sites of Viral RNA Replication—As a first step in the characterization of DV NS4A, we determined its subcellular localization in infected Huh-7 cells at different time points postinfection (p.i.) by using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM) and a newly developed DV NS4A-specific peptide antibody (see “Experimental Procedures”). No fluorescence was observed by staining uninfected cells, confirming the specificity of the antiserum (Fig. 1B, panel d). At 14 h p.i. NS4A localizes to cytoplasmic reticular structures that were mainly enriched in the perinuclear region (Fig. 1B, panel a), whereas at 24 h p.i. a dot-like staining pattern was observed in the cytoplasm of the infected cells (Fig. 1B, panel b). A similar pattern was found at 38 h p.i. with a clearly increased number of cytoplasmic foci (Fig. 1B, panel c). The observed distribution of DV NS4A bears resemblance to the previously described distribution of E, NS3, and NS4B in DV-infected cells (19Umareddy I. Chao A. Sampath A. Gu F. Vasudevan S.G. J. Gen. Virol. 2006; 87: 2605-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 25Miller S. Sparacio S. Bartenschlager R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; Google Scholar). These proteins appear to be localized within or in close proximity to the viral RCs. We therefore determined whether NS4A also localizes to these cytoplasmic structures by using colocalization experiments. At 24 h p.i. we detected NS4A and E in exactly the same cytoplasmic foci, arguing that NS4A could be a component of the viral RC (see Fig. 2, panels p–r). This assumption was corroborated by the fact that the staining pattern observed for NS4A overlapped completely with the dot-like staining pattern of dsRNA (Fig. 2, panels j–l) that is formed as an intermediate of viral RNA replication. dsRNA also colocalizes with the ER marker calnexin in DV-infected cells (Fig. 2, panels m–o), which was otherwise found in cytoplasmic reticular structures in non-infected cells (Fig. 2, panels d–f). These results show that DV2 infection of Huh-7 cells leads to a redistribution of the ER, which did not affect the cis- and trans-Golgi (Fig. 2, panels s–x). In conclusion, we found that DV NS4A colocalizes with dsRNA and viral proteins to the sites of RNA replication in infected cells. These putative membrane-bound RCs most likely are ER-derived or reside in very close proximity to ER membranes. DV NS4A Lacking the 2K Sequence Induces Cytoplasmic Dot-like Structures—The C-terminal 23 residues of NS4A encode for a signal sequence important for the translocation of NS4B into the ER lumen (21Lin C. Amberg S.M. Chambers T.J. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2327-2335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While this work was in progress, it was reported that expression of uncleaved KUNV NS4A-2K induces membrane rearrangements resembling KUNV-induced structures. Removal of the 2K domain significantly reduced membrane rearrangement and resulted in the redistribution of NS4A to the Golgi apparatus (22Roosendaal J. Westaway E.G. Khromykh A. Mackenzie J.M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 4623-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To analyze if also DV NS4A is able to induce dot-like structures we investigated its subcellular localization in cells expressing a full-length DV NS4A-eGFP fusion protein by using confocal IFM. In the wild-type NS4A-2K-4B precursor, prior processing at the 4A-2K site by the viral NS2B-3 protease is required before the host cell signalase can cleave at the 2K-4B site. To make sure that NS4A in the NS4A-eGFP fusion protein is not cleaved off from the C-terminal reporter by the host signalase, we constructed a fusion protein in which the 2K-4B signalase cleavage site was mutated (designated NS4Amut-eGFP). The comparison of NS4A-eGFP and NS4Amut-eGFP expressed in transfected cells by Western blot analyses revealed that with both proteins the reporter was not cleaved off from the NS4A fusion partner (data not shown). Thus, we used the more authentic NS4A-eGFP protein for all further analyses. When eGFP was expressed alone in Huh-7/T7 cells it was distributed rather evenly throughout the cell (Fig. 3, panel a). However, when eGFP was fused to the C or N terminus of NS4A, the subcellular localization of eGFP was altered compared with overexpression of eGFP alone, but both fusion proteins exhibited a comparable reticular staining pattern with some enrichment in the perinuclear region (see Fig. 3, panels b and c). The same reticular staining pattern was found in cells analyzed at later time points post-transfection and also with HA- or Myc-tagged NS4A-proteins (data not shown), excluding the possibility that the observed distribution is an artifact because of the fusion to eGFP. Colocalization experiments with cellular marker proteins revealed that NS4A-eGFP colocalized perfectly with the ER marker calreticulin (Fig. 3, panels d–f). However, in contrast to cells transfected with KUNV NS4A (22Roosendaal J. Westaway E.G. Khromykh A. Mackenzie J.M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 4623-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), no membrane rearrangements were visible in DV NS4A-eGFP-expressing cells. Because 2K is cleaved off from NS4A during polyprotein processing, we wanted to analyze the subcellular localization of mature NS4A lacking the 2K domain. To this end, we constructed a plasmid encoding for the N-terminal 127 residues of DV NS4A fused to eGFP and analyzed its localization in transfected cells. Surprisingly, the reticular staining pattern was observed very rarely (in less than 5% of transfected cells) and instead nearly all NS4A(-2K)-eGFP was detected in distinct dot-like structures distributed throughout the cytoplasm (see Fig. 3, panel g). The same structures were also found by using an antibody directed against the ER protein calreticulin, indicating that the expression of NS4A lacking the 2K domain induced rearrangement of ER membranes (Fig. 3, panel h). In contrast, distribution of the trans-Golgi marker p230 and the cis-Golgi marker GM130 was not affected (Fig. 3, panels j–o). The different staining patterns observed in cells expressing NS4A-eGFP and NS4A(-2K)-eGFP were not due to different expression levels of these two fusion proteins as determined by Western blot analyses (data not shown). To make sure that the fusion of eGFP to the C terminus of NS4A(-2K) does not alter the true localization and function of the viral protein, we also constructed an expression plasmid encoding for NS4A(-2K) with an N-terminal eGFP fusion. Cells transfected with this construct showed the same dot-like structures as observed for NS4A(-2K) with the C-terminal eGFP fusion (data not shown). Therefore we concluded that the induction of dot-like structures by NS4A(-2K) is not an artifact of the fusion to eGFP. For a more detailed analysis of the morphological changes induced in DV NS4A(-2K)-eGFP-expressing cells, immunoelectron microscopy (EM) studies were performed. As expected from the IFM, full-length NS4A was found nearly exclusively in cisternal structures reminiscent of the ER (Fig. 4A, panel a). In contrast, NS4A(-2K) was concentrated in large accumulations of intracellular membranes (Fig. 4A, panel b) that were not visible in cells transfected with full-length NS4A. These structures were often found to be surrounded or adjacent to the ER (not shown). A minor portion of NS4A(-2K) was also detectable in ER- and intermediate compartment-derived structures (data not shown). In agreement with the IFM (Fig. 3) these results confirm that expression of DV NS4A lacking its C-terminal 2K fragment is able to induce the formation of cytoplasmic membrane alterations that are likely ER-derived because they contain calreticulin (as seen by IFM). However, in full-length NS4A, the C-terminal 2K domain appears to block the induction of these membrane rearrangements. Fully Processed DV NS4A Predominates in Infected Cells— Our microscopic studies using recombinant DV NS4A indicate that NS4A is able to induce membrane alterations only after removal of the C-terminal 2K fragment. To investigate whether unprocessed NS4A-2K or processed NS4A lacking the 2K peptide is the predominant species in infected cells, lysates of cells infected with DV2 were analyzed by NS4A-specific Western blot. For comparison, NS4A either containing or lacking 2K was analyzed in parallel on the same gel. The size of NS4A in infected cells matched exactly the size of recombinant NS4A lacking 2K. Surprisingly, recombinant full-length NS4A appeared as a double band corresponding in molecular weight to full-length NS4A and NS4A lacking 2K (Fig. 4B). The origin of the smaller protein is not known so far, but it is possible that partial cleavage at the 4A-2K site might be carried out by an as yet unknown cellular protease. Nevertheless, the results of our experiments show clearly that the predominant NS4A species in infected cells is NS4A without 2K. This finding supports our model that NS4A lacking 2K is the molecule responsible for the induction of membrane alterations. DV NS4A Is Integrated into Cellular Membranes Independent from 2K—DV NS4A is very hydrophobic and therefore expected to associate with cellular membranes (9Mackenzie J.M. Khromykh A.A. Jones M.K. Westaway E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). However, biochemical data on the membrane association of this protein are lacking. To characterize the intracellular membrane association of NS4A, we first performed equilibrium density gradient centrifugation experiments of post-nuclear lysates of DV-infected cells and of cells transfected with an NS4A-eGFP-encoding plasmid. Postnuclear lysates were subjected to floatation gradient centrifugation, and proteins contained in gradient fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. Under these conditions membrane-associated proteins are enriched in fractions of low density (LD) as indicated by the distribution of t"

In the nematode Caeonorhabditis elegans , gustatory and olfactory neurons regulate aging and longevity. Using the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster , we showed that exposure to nutrient-derived odorants can modulate life span and partially reverse the longevity-extending effects of dietary restriction. Furthermore, mutation of odorant receptor Or83b resulted in severe olfactory defects, altered adult metabolism, enhanced stress resistance, and extended life span. Our findings indicate that olfaction affects adult physiology and aging in Drosophila , possibly through the perceived availability of nutritional resources, and that olfactory regulation of life span is evolutionarily conserved."

https://openalex.org/W1964785871,"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) have both been implicated in cognitive control, but their relative roles remain unclear. Here we recorded the activity of single neurons in both areas while monkeys performed a task that required them to switch between trials in which they had to look toward a flashed stimulus (prosaccades) and trials in which they had to look away from the stimulus (antisaccades). We found that ACC neurons had a higher level of task selectivity than PFC neurons during the preparatory period on trials immediately following a task switch. In ACC neurons, task selectivity was strongest after the task switch and declined throughout the task block, whereas task selectivity remained constant in the PFC. These results demonstrate that the ACC is recruited when cognitive demands increase and suggest a role for both areas in task maintenance and the implementation of top-down control. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) have both been implicated in cognitive control, but their relative roles remain unclear. Here we recorded the activity of single neurons in both areas while monkeys performed a task that required them to switch between trials in which they had to look toward a flashed stimulus (prosaccades) and trials in which they had to look away from the stimulus (antisaccades).

These results demonstrate that the ACC is recruited when cognitive demands increase and suggest a role for both areas in task maintenance and the implementation of top-down control. A remarkable aspect of primate behavior is the ability to switch rapidly between different tasks. Cognitive flexibility of this type allows humans and animals to successfully cope with the demands of a swiftly changing environment and is an integral element of intelligent behavior. Anatomical and physiological studies have suggested that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) are involved in this executive control (Duncan, 2001Duncan J. An adaptive coding model of neural function in prefrontal cortex.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 820-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, Miller and Cohen, 2001Miller E.K. Cohen J.D. An integrative theory of prefrontal cortex function.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 167-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (8430) Google Scholar). Both areas are closely interconnected (Bates and Goldman-Rakic, 1993Bates J.F. Goldman-Rakic P.S. Prefrontal connections of medial motor areas in the rhesus monkey.J. Comp. Neurol. 1993; 336: 211-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, Paus et al., 2001Paus T. Castro-Alamancos M.A. Petrides M.

Cingulate cortical cells projecting to monkey frontal eye field and primary motor cortex.Neuroreport. 2004; 15: 1559-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), suggesting that they may be involved in similar cognitive functions. Indeed, functional neuroimaging studies have shown a strikingly similar recruitment of the PFC and ACC in a multitude of cognitive tasks, including response conflict, task novelty, working memory, episodic memory, and problem solving (Duncan and Owen, 2000Duncan J. Owen A.M. Common regions of the human frontal lobe recruited by diverse cognitive demands.Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 475-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar). Several studies have attempted to dissociate the roles of ACC and PFC in cognitive control (Liston et al., 2006Liston C. Matalon S. Hare T.A. Davidson M.C. Casey B.J.

Dissociating the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex in cognitive control.Science. 2000; 288: 1835-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2867) Google Scholar), but the relative contributions of these areas remain unclear. One hypothesis proposes that the PFC is involved in the implementation of task control, whereas the ACC is involved in conflict monitoring (Botvinick et al., 2001Botvinick M.M. Braver T.S. Barch D.M.

Cohen J.D. An integrative theory of prefrontal cortex function.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 167-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (8430) Google Scholar). According to this model, the PFC provides top-down bias signals to other brain areas that implement the task-appropriate mapping between inputs and outputs. In this conceptualization, the ACC detects conflict when a stimulus coactivates two competing response processes. This conflict signal then leads to an increase in the top-down control in the PFC that is necessary for the maintenance of task set. Although well supported by a large number of human fMRI studies, single-neuron studies in monkeys have failed to find conflict-related signals in the ACC (Ito et al., 2003Ito S. Stuphorn V.

Performance monitoring by the anterior cingulate cortex during saccade countermanding.Science. 2003; 302: 120-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, Nakamura et al., 2005Nakamura K. Roesch M.R. Olson C.R. Neuronal activity in macaque SEF and ACC during performance of tasks involving conflict.J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 93: 884-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Instead, these studies have demonstrated a role of the ACC in performance monitoring with many neurons showing different activity between either correct and incorrect responses or rewarded and unrewarded behavior. A recent model proposes that the ACC does not signal conflict or error performance per se, but more general error-likelihood (Brown and Braver, 2005Brown J.W. Braver T.S. Learned predictions of error likelihood in the anterior cingulate cortex.Science. 2005; 307: 1118-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). According to this model, the ACC is activated when more cognitive control is required due to an increase in task demands. A common situation in which task demands increase is when subjects have to switch from one task to another, especially if the two tasks require competing stimulus-response associations. Task switching is commonly considered to be an example of executive processing, and as such, a large body of psychological research has investigated this behavior in human subjects (Allport et al., 1994Allport A.

In addition, lesion and inactivation studies in monkeys have demonstrated impairments in task switching following both PFC (Dias et al., 1996Dias R. Robbins T.W. Roberts A.C.

To investigate the unique contributions of the PFC and ACC to task maintenance and task switching, at the level of individual neurons, we recorded single-neuron activity in both the lateral prefrontal cortex (areas 9 and 46) and the anterior cingulate cortex (area 24c) (Figure 1A). Monkeys were trained to either generate a prosaccade or an antisaccade in response to a briefly presented peripheral visual stimulus (Munoz and Everling, 2004Munoz D.P. Everling S. Look away: the anti-saccade task and the voluntary control of eye movement.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). The PFC and ACC have both been shown to be involved in performance of the antisaccade task by a number of studies (Condy et al., 2006Condy C. Wattiez N. Rivaud-Pechoux S. Tremblay L. Gaymard B.

The tasks alternated without notice after 30 correct responses. In order to continue obtaining reward, the monkeys had to switch to the other task (Figure 1B). To successfully perform this paradigm, the animals had to engage and maintain the current task set over a block of trials and perform a task switch once the previous behavior was no longer rewarded. Here we report different time courses of neural activity in the ACC and PFC consistent with the hypothesis that the activation of neurons in the ACC leads those in the PFC following a task switch. Figure 1C (left) shows the monkeys' performance before and after a task switch. Monkeys performed prosaccades at ∼90% and antisaccades at ∼80% before the task changed. The last trial before a switch was always performed at 100% because in our task design prosaccade and antisaccade blocks always alternated after the 30th correct trial in a block. Performance dropped to almost 0% for switches from prosaccades to antisaccades and to ∼10% when switching from antisaccades to prosaccades. This is not surprising as the animals received no advance warning of the task switch and therefore continued to execute the previously rewarded behavior. Performance recovered rapidly following a switch, with the next trial already being at chance (50% correct) and the second trial after a task switch at ∼70%–80%. Within five to ten trials, performance recovered to a level similar to that prior to the task switch. There was almost no effect of the task switch on the reaction times of prosaccades and antisaccades, with the exception of the first trial after a switch, which was associated with prolonged reaction times for pro- and antisaccades (Figure 1C, right). We recorded the activity of a total of 174 PFC neurons (124 in monkey R, 50 in monkey W) and 198 ACC neurons (95 in monkey R, 103 in monkey W) in two monkeys over the course of 87 experimental sessions. Many PFC and ACC neurons showed task-selective activity, which we defined as a difference in mean discharge rate between correct prosaccade and antisaccade trials. Examples of neurons with task-selective activity are shown in Figure 2. Consistent with findings in other cortical and subcortical brain areas (Amador et al., 2003Amador N. Schlag-Rey M. Schlag J.

Here we focus on these task-related differences in preparatory neural activity. We compared the activity of each recorded PFC and ACC neuron between the two tasks during the preparatory period (see Experimental Procedures). In this initial analysis, 23% (46/198) of the ACC neurons and 30% (51/174) of the PFC neurons showed task-related differences in their preparatory activity (see Note 1 in the Supplemental Data available online). Consistent with a previous report (Everling and Desouza, 2005Everling S. Desouza J.F. Rule-dependent activity for prosaccades and antisaccades in the primate prefrontal cortex.J. Cogn.

There was also no difference in the level of preparatory activity between prosaccade and antisaccade trials in the population of PFC neurons (Figure 3A, top; p = 0.54, paired t test). We also did not find a clear task preference for ACC neurons (28/46, or 60%, preferred antisaccades and 18/46, or 40%, preferred prosaccades; p = 0.14, χ2 test).

Dashed lines indicate the time of stimulus onset. All data are based on correct prosaccade and antisaccade trials collapsed across all blocks. The remainder of our analysis focused on the 51 PFC (36 from monkey R, 15 from monkey W) and 46 ACC neurons (26 from monkey R, 20 from monkey W) that showed significant differences in preparatory activity between prosaccade and antisaccade trials. To investigate the nature of these differences in preparatory activity, we quantified the relative time courses of task selectivity in the two areas by performing Receiver Operating Characteristics analyses (ROC, see Experimental Procedures). ROC values over the duration of a trial are shown for each individual PFC (Figure 3B, top) and ACC neuron (Figure 3B, middle). Some neurons exhibited task selectivity throughout the entire trial, while others exhibited selectivity only shortly before stimulus presentation. A comparison of the onset times of task selectivity did not reveal any differences between the sample of PFC and ACC neurons (p = 0.24). Next, we investigated task selectivity as a function of the number of correct trials after a task switch for the population of PFC neurons (Figure 4A, left) and ACC neurons (Figure 4A, right). This comparison revealed striking differences in the onset and strength of task selectivity throughout a block of trials between neurons in the two brain regions. We could not account for these differences on the basis of behavioral performance, as the level of performance was similar across the recording sessions in which we recorded PFC and ACC activity (see Figure S1). The population of PFC neurons showed a constant magnitude of task selectivity throughout the block of trials. We tested the effects of trial number following a task switch on neural selectivity by dividing the task blocks into consecutive sub-blocks of five correct trials each (Figure 4B, left panel) and comparing the overall task selectivity between the six sub-blocks with a repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA, see Experimental Procedures). This analysis revealed no differences in task selectivity throughout the block for PFC neurons [F(5,250) = 1.0; p = 0.42]. The population of ACC neurons, however, showed strong task selectivity immediately following a task switch, which then decreased throughout the block (Figure 4B, right panel). An ANOVA confirmed a significant main effect of sub-block following task switch on task selectivity for ACC neurons [F(5,225) = 5.68; p < 0.0001]. These differences in the neural activity between ACC and PFC neurons were also evident in single neurons (Figure S2) and in their population activity (Figure S3). Both monkeys showed a similar pattern of task selectivity throughout the block (Figures S4 and S5). There were no differences between prosaccade and antisaccade neurons (Figures S6 and S7). The differences in the maintenance of task selectivity between PFC and ACC neurons seemed to be partly related to a different onset pattern of task selectivity. The population of PFC neurons showed a fairly constant onset of task selectivity at around 350 ms prior to peripheral stimulus onset, whereas the population of ACC neurons displayed a gradual increase in the onset of task selectivity over the block of trials. We confirmed these differences by determining the onset time of significant differences in task selectivity for each neuron in the six sub-blocks of five trials with a bootstrap analysis (see Experimental Procedures). PFC neurons exhibited similar onset times for the six sub-blocks, with a slight trend toward earlier onset times in task selectivity as the blocks progressed (Figure 4B, left). In contrast, task selectivity started progressively later in ACC neurons over the block (Figure 4B, right). In addition, the number of cells discriminating between pro- and antisaccade trials remained at around 80% in the PFC but dropped from about 80% to ∼55% in the ACC. A repeated-measures ANOVA on the onset times in the six sub-blocks showed no main effect for PFC neurons [F(5,250) = 1.73; p = 0.13] but a significant main effect for ACC neurons [F(5,225) = 6.26; p < 0.00005]. Both monkeys showed a similar pattern of task selectivity throughout the block (Figures S5 and S6; Note 3). There were no differences between prosaccade and antisaccade neurons (Figures S6 and S7). We also computed task selectivity and onsets of task selectivity for ACC and PFC neurons in the five correct trials immediately before a task switch (black lines in Figures 4B and 4C). The level of task selectivity dropped in the PFC and increased in the ACC following a task switch (Figure 5A). No differences in task selectivity were observed between ACC and PFC neurons in the trials 6 to 30 following a task switch. Likewise, the onset of task selectivity started later in the PFC and earlier in the ACC following a task switch (Figure 5B). This pattern reversed toward the end of a block, with an earlier onset of task selectivity in the PFC than the ACC from trials 16 to 30. The need to switch to the other task was conveyed to the monkeys by the omission of reward. The first trials in a new block were therefore always error trials. To compare the effect of performance on task selectivity in the PFC and ACC, we computed ROC values for error trials, correct trials that followed an error trial, and correct trials that followed a correct trial (see Experimental Procedures). We included all error trials and all correct trials in this analysis. A large number of the errors, however, occurred following a task switch (Figure S1). Figure 6 shows that task selectivity was low on error trials in the PFC (left panel, red line) and the ACC (right panel, red line). On the next correct trial following a task switch, task selectivity was still low in the PFC (left panel, blue line) but showed a strong increase in the ACC (right panel, blue line). The differences in task selectivity between error trials and correct trials following an error were not significant in the PFC (paired t test, p = 0.54) but they were significant in the ACC (paired t test, p < 0.0002). Trials that followed a correct trial showed a strong task selectivity in the PFC (left panel, green line) and ACC (right panel, green line). Task selectivity was different between correct trials that were preceded by an error trial and correct trials that were preceded by a correct trial in the PFC (paired t test, p < 0.0000005) but not the ACC (paired t test, p = 0.97). The same pattern was observed for both monkeys (Figure S8; Note 2). An influential model of cognitive control proposes that the anterior cingulate cortex monitors conflict during stimulus processing and response selection and recruits the prefrontal cortex during preparatory periods for top-down control processes (Hopfinger et al., 2000Hopfinger J.B.

Cohen J.D. An integrative theory of prefrontal cortex function.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 167-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (8430) Google Scholar). This model is largely based on human fMRI studies. To date, a single study has compared the response properties of single PFC and ACC neurons (Niki and Watanabe, 1979Niki H. Watanabe M. Prefrontal and cingulate unit activity during timing behavior in the monkey.Brain Res. 1979; 171: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Here, to our knowledge, we report the first systematic comparison of preparatory activity in PFC and ACC neurons while monkeys performed a task-switching paradigm. We found that the level of task selectivity was significantly higher in ACC than in PFC neurons during the preparatory period on trials immediately following a task switch. Moreover, ACC neurons exhibited a significant level of task selectivity during the preparatory period on the first correct trial following a response error that was absent in PFC neurons. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that task-selective differences in preparatory neural activity in the ACC lead those in the PFC following a task switch and response errors. The conflict-monitoring hypothesis (Botvinick et al., 2001Botvinick M.M. Braver T.S. Barch D.M. Carter C.S. Cohen J.D. Conflict monitoring and cognitive control.Psychol. Rev. 2001; 108: 624-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (5140) Google Scholar) is an influential model that has been proposed to account for the relative roles of different brain areas in the implementation of cognitive control. This model has been supported by fMRI studies that have shown increased levels of activity in the ACC during tasks such as the Stroop task (Carter et al., 2000Carter C.S. Macdonald A.M. Botvinick M. Ross L.L. Stenger V.A. Noll D. Cohen J.D. Parsing executive processes: strategic vs. evaluative functions of the anterior cingulate cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 1944-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar), which engender conflict by coactivating incompatible response processes. More specifically, conflict monitoring proposes the ACC acts as a conflict detector and recruits the PFC to engage control mechanisms (van Veen et al., 2001van Veen V. Cohen J.D. Botvinick M.M. Stenger V.A. Carter C.S. Anterior cingulate cortex, conflict monitoring, and levels of processing.Neuroimage. 2001; 14: 1302-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, Kerns et al., 2004Kerns J.G. Cohen J.D.

A prediction of this model is that the PFC is activated during preparatory periods, whereas the ACC monitors for conflict during stimulus processing and response selection (Hopfinger et al., 2000Hopfinger J.B.

Sea surface temperature (SST) records from Moroccan sediment cores, extending back 2500 years, reveal anomalous and unprecedented cooling during the 20th century, which is consistent with increased upwelling. Upwelling-driven SSTs also vary out of phase with millennial-scale changes in Northern Hemisphere temperature anomalies (NHTAs) and show relatively warm conditions during the Little Ice Age and relatively cool conditions during the Medieval Warm Period. Together, these results suggest that coastal upwelling varies with NHTAs and that upwelling off northwest Africa may continue to intensify as global warming and atmospheric CO 2 levels increase."
https://openalex.org/W2071626387,"Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is a key compound in global sulfur and carbon cycles. DMS oxidation products cause cloud nucleation and may affect weather and climate. DMS is generated largely by bacterial catabolism of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), a secondary metabolite made by marine algae. We demonstrate that the bacterial gene dddD is required for this process and that its transcription is induced by the DMSP substrate. Cloned dddD from the marine bacterium Marinomonas and from two bacterial strains that associate with higher plants, the N 2 -fixing symbiont Rhizobium NGR234 and the root-colonizing Burkholderia cepacia AMMD, conferred to Escherichia coli the ability to make DMS from DMSP. The inferred enzymatic mechanism for DMS liberation involves an initial step in which DMSP is modified by addition of acyl coenzyme A, rather than the immediate release of DMS by a DMSP lyase, the previously suggested mechanism."

We found that the inversion symmetry can be broken by absorption of a linearly polarized photon, which itself has inversion symmetry. In particular, the emission of a photoelectron with subsequent dissociation of the remaining H + 2 fragment shows no symmetry with respect to the ionic H + and neutral H atomic fragments. This lack of symmetry results from the entanglement between symmetric and antisymmetric H + 2 states that is caused by autoionization. The mechanisms behind this symmetry breaking are general for all molecules."

A structure-insensitive regime arises for redox partners coupled through dynamically averaged multiple-coupling pathways (in seven of the nine derivatives) where heme-edge coupling leads to the multiple-pathway regime. A structure-dependent limit governs redox partners coupled through a dominant pathway (in two of the nine derivatives) where axial-ligand coupling generates the single-pathway limit and slower rates. This two-regime paradigm provides a unified description of electron transfer rates in 26 ruthenium-modified heme and blue-copper proteins, as well as in numerous photosynthetic proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1966418219,"Excitotoxicity mediated by glutamate receptors plays crucial roles in ischemia and other neurodegenerative diseases. Whereas overactivation of ionotropic glutamate receptors is neurotoxic, the role of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), and especially mGluR1, remains equivocal. Here we report that activation of NMDA receptors results in calpain-mediated truncation of the C-terminal domain of mGluR1alpha at Ser(936). The truncated mGluR1alpha maintains its ability to increase cytosolic calcium while it no longer activates the neuroprotective PI(3)K-Akt signaling pathways. Full-length and truncated forms of mGluR1alpha play distinct roles in excitotoxic neuronal degeneration in cultured neurons. A fusion peptide derived from the calpain cleavage site of mGluR1alpha efficiently blocks NMDA-induced truncation of mGluR1alpha in primary neuronal cultures and exhibits neuroprotection against excitotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. These findings shed light on the relationship between NMDA and mGluR1alpha and indicate the existence of a positive feedback regulation in excitotoxicity involving calpain and mGluR1alpha."
https://openalex.org/W2038467044,"We show that composite materials can exhibit a viscoelastic modulus (Young's modulus) that is far greater than that of either constituent. The modulus, but not the strength, of the composite was observed to be substantially greater than that of diamond. These composites contain bariumtitanate inclusions, which undergo a volume-change phase transformation if they are not constrained. In the composite, the inclusions are partially constrained by the surrounding metal matrix. The constraint stabilizes the negative bulk modulus (inverse compressibility) of the inclusions. This negative modulus arises from stored elastic energy in the inclusions, in contrast to periodic composite metamaterials that exhibit negative refraction by inertial resonant effects. Conventional composites with positive-stiffness constituents have aggregate properties bounded by a weighted average of constituent properties; their modulus cannot exceed that of the stiffest constituent."
https://openalex.org/W2061286602,"Seven-transmembrane receptor (7TMR) signaling is transduced by second messengers such as diacylglycerol (DAG) generated in response to the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein Gq and is terminated by receptor desensitization and degradation of the second messengers. We show that beta-arrestins coordinate both processes for the Gq-coupled M1 muscarinic receptor. beta-Arrestins physically interact with diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs), enzymes that degrade DAG. Moreover, beta-arrestins are essential for conversion of DAG to phosphatidic acid after agonist stimulation, and this activity requires recruitment of the beta-arrestin-DGK complex to activated 7TMRs. The dual function of beta-arrestins, limiting production of diacylglycerol (by receptor desensitization) while enhancing its rate of degradation, is analogous to their ability to recruit adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterases to Gs-coupled beta2-adrenergic receptors. Thus, beta-arrestins can serve similar regulatory functions for disparate classes of 7TMRs through structurally dissimilar enzymes that degrade chemically distinct second messengers."
https://openalex.org/W2086519850,"The canonical Wnt-beta-catenin signaling pathway is important for a variety of developmental phenomena as well as for carcinogenesis. Here, we show that, in hippocampal neurons, NMDA-receptor-dependent activation of calpain induced the cleavage of beta-catenin at the N terminus, generating stable, truncated forms. These beta-catenin fragments accumulated in the nucleus and induced Tcf/Lef-dependent gene transcription. We identified Fosl1, one of the immediate-early genes, as a target of this signaling pathway. In addition, exploratory behavior by mice resulted in a similar cleavage of beta-catenin, as well as activation of the Tcf signaling pathway, in hippocampal neurons. Both beta-catenin cleavage and Tcf-dependent gene transcription were suppressed by calpain inhibitors. These findings reveal another pathway for beta-catenin-dependent signaling, in addition to the canonical Wnt-beta-catenin pathway, and suggest that this other pathway could play an important role in activity-dependent gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2128923688,"Caveolae, small invaginations in the plasma membrane, contain caveolins (Cav) that scaffold signaling molecules including the tyrosine kinase Src. We tested the hypothesis that cardiac protection involves a caveolin-dependent mechanism. We used in vitro and in vivo models of ischemia-reperfusion injury, electron microscopy (EM), transgenic mice, and biochemical assays to address this hypothesis. We found that Cav-1 mRNA and protein were expressed in mouse adult cardiac myocytes (ACM). The volatile anesthetic, isoflurane, protected ACM from hypoxia-induced cell death and increased sarcolemmal caveolae. Hearts of wild-type (WT) mice showed rapid phosphorylation of Src and Cav-1 after isoflurane and ischemic preconditioning. The Src inhibitor PP2 reduced phosphorylation of Src (Y416) and Cav-1 in the heart and abolished isoflurane-induced cardiac protection in WT mice. Infarct size (percent area at risk) was reduced by isoflurane in WT (30.5+/-4 vs. 44.2+/-3, n=7, P<0.05) but not Cav-1(-/-) mice (46.6+/-5 vs. 41.7+/-3, n=7). Cav-1(-/-) mice exposed to isoflurane showed significant alterations in Src phosphorylation and recruitment of C-terminal Src kinase, a negative regulator of Src, when compared to WT mice. The results indicate that isoflurane modifies cardiac myocyte sarcolemmal membrane structure and composition and that activation of Src and phosphorylation of Cav-1 contribute to cardiac protection. Accordingly, therapies targeted to post-translational modification of Src and Cav-1 may provide a novel approach for such protection."
https://openalex.org/W2024302505,"Cellular cytidine deaminases APOBEC3 family is a group of potent inhibitors for many exogenous and endogenous retroviruses. It has been demonstrated that they induce G to A hypermutations in the nascent retroviral DNA, resulting from the cytosine (C) to uracil (U) conversions in minus-stranded viral DNA. In this report, we have demonstrated that the result of C to U conversion in minus-stranded DNA of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) could trigger a degradation of nascent viral DNA mediated by uracil DNA glycosylases-2 (UNG2) and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE). Since antiviral activity of APOBEC3G is partially affected by UNG2 inhibitor Ugi or UNG2-specific short-interfering RNA in virus-producing cells but not target cells, the virion-associated UNG2 most likely mediates this process. Interestingly, as APE-specific short-interfering RNA can also partially inhibit the anti-HIV-1 activity of APOBEC3G in virus-producing cells but not in target cells and APE molecules can be detected within HIV-1 virions, it seems that the required APE is also virion-associated. Furthermore, the in vitro cleavage experiment using uracil-containing single-stranded DNA as a template has demonstrated that the uracil-excising catalytic activity of virion-associated UNG2 can remove dU from the uracil-containing viral DNA and leave an abasic site, which could be further cleaved by virion-associated APE. Based upon our observations, we propose that the degradation of APOBEC3G-edited viral DNA mediated by virion-associated UNG2 and APE during or after reverse transcription could be partially responsible for the potent anti-HIV-1 effect by APOBEC3G in the absence of vif.

It is closely related to APOBEC1, a cytidine deaminase that causes a specific cytosine to uracil change in the apolipoprotein B mRNA, and to an activation-induced deaminase (AID) enzyme that causes hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes (12Navaratnam N. Sarwar R. Int. J. Hematol. 2006; 83: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The similarities of the catalytic domains in these proteins strongly suggest that APOBEC3 edits the nucleic acids of various retrotransposons. Among these cytidine deaminases, APOBEC3G is the most extensively studied enzyme. It can be efficiently incorporated into human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 4The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; UNG2, uracil DNA glycosylases-2; AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic; APE, AP endonuclease; siRNA, short-interfering RNA; RT, reverse transcription; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. particles and causes extensive cytosine to uracil conversion in the viral minus-stranded DNA during reverse transcription (2Zhang H.

Two consequences could occur after the C to U conversion. First, uracil in minus-stranded DNA could be excised by recruited uracil DNA glycosylase-2 (UNG2), a host DNA repair enzyme. The resulting abasic site could be further cleaved by apurinic/apyrimidinic endonucleases (APE). The vif-defective viruses generated from the restrictive cells are unable to effectively process reverse transcription, or the completed reverse transcripts are readily subjected to degradation in the target cells, which is consistent with this hypothesis (3Mangeat B.

Second, C to U conversion in minus-stranded DNA could lead to G to A hypermutation in the plus-stranded DNA. These double-stranded DNA harboring G to A hypermutation would encode viral proteins containing aberrant premature stop codons or mutated proteins and would lead to accumulated genomic damage in viral replication (13Yu Q.

In this report, we have designed a series of experiments to test the first hypothesis. We have shown that in the presence of inhibitors of cellular UNG2 or APE, respectively, the antiviral activity of APOBEC3G can be decreased. Our findings suggest that DNA repair enzymes encapsidated within the virions directly participate in the degradation of uracilated-viral DNA induced by APOBEC3G and that this degradation process is correlated to the antiviral activity of APOBEC3G. Plasmid Construction—An infectious HIV-1 clone with a deletion in the vif region (234-bp deletion), pNL4-3Δvif, and APOBEC3G expressing vectors pcDNA3-APOBEC3G and pSLX-GFP were constructed previously (2Zhang H. Yang B. Pomerantz R.J. Zhang C. Arunachalam S.C. Gao L. Nature. 2003; 424: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). The DNA of Ugi was PCR-amplified from pZWtac1 with a 5′-primer containing a MluI site and a 3′-primer containing a XhoI site and a c-Myc tag encoding EQKLISEEDL (18Wang Z.G. Smith D.G. Mosbaugh D.W. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 99: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The PCR product (∼260 bp) was digested with MluI and XhoI. The resulting DNA fragment was inserted into the pSLX vector to generate pSLX-Ugi-Myc. The APE DNA was amplified by RT-PCR from mRNA extracted from 293T cells with primers containing EcoRI or XhoI sites. The 3′-primer also contains a c-Myc tag. The RT-PCR product was then digested with EcoRI and XhoI followed by insertion into the pSLV vector to generate pSLX-APE-Myc.

The luciferase-specific siRNA or GFP-specific siRNA served as negative controls. Conversely, the siLentGene U6 cassette RNA interference system (Promega) was used to generate U6 promoter-controlled APE-specific siRNAs. The APE siRNA pool was designed by the Dharmacon siDESIGN program. Based upon the protocol, various oligonucleotides were designed as the downstream primers: oligonucleotide 1A (for antisense RNA), 5′-CAA AAA CTG TAA AAA GCC TAT GCC GTA AGA AAC CGG TGT TTC GTC CTT TCC ACA AGA-3′; oligonucleotide 1S (for sense RNA), 5′-CAA AAA CTG TAA AAA GGT TTC TTA CGG CAT AGG CGG TGT TTC GTC CTT TCC ACA AGA-3′; oligonucleotide 2A, 5′-CAA AAA CTG TAA AAA GTT ACC AGC ACA AAC GAG CGG TGT TTC GTC CTT TCC ACA AGA-3′; oligonucleotide 2S, 5′-CAA AAA CTG TAA AAA GCT CGT TTG TGC TGG TAA CGG TGT TTC GTC CTT TCC ACA AGA-3′; oligonucleotide 3A, 5′-CAA AAA CTG TAA AAA GCA TTA GGT ACA TAT GCT CGG TGT TTC GTC CTT TCC ACA AGA-3′, oligonucleotide 3S, 5′-CAA AAA CTG TAA AAA GAG CAT ATG TAC CTA ATG CGG TGT TTC GTC CTT TCC ACA AGA-3′; oligonucleotide 4A, 5′-CAA AAA CTG TAA AAA GGA ACT TGC GAA AGG CTT CGG TGT TTC GTC CTT TCC ACA AGA-3′; oligonucleotide 4S, 5′-CAA AAA CTG TAA AAA GAA GCC TTT CGC AAG TTC CGG TGT TTC GTC CTT TCC ACA AGA-3′. The sequences of APE are labeled bold. These various downstream primers were used for PCR amplification, along with the upstream primer and the template supplied by manufacturer. The PCR products were then inserted into the vectors to generate plasmids expressing various sense and antisense siRNAs, controlled by the U6 promoter. After transfection into 293T cells, these sense and antisense transcripts would complement each other and form various double-stranded siRNAs. Viral Infection—Viral stocks were produced in 293T cells by transfection with 2 μg of pNL4-3Δvif and 2 μg of pNL4-3Δvif plus 1 μg of pcDNA3-APOBEC3G, respectively, or in combination with the vectors expressing various genes such as Ugi or GFP, as well as various siRNAs, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Viruses in the supernatants were harvested at 48 h after transfection. After treatment with RQ1 DNase to remove input plasmids, the viruses were passed through a 0.45-μm filter and further quantitated with HIV-1 p24 via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The viral infection was then performed with HLCD4-CAT as the target cells, which contain stably integrated, silent copies of the HIV-1 LTR promoter linked to the CAT gene. At 48 h after infection, the infected cells were harvested and subjected to CAT analysis, as described previously (2Zhang H. Yang B. Pomerantz R.J. Zhang C. Arunachalam S.C. Gao L. Nature. 2003; 424: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Cytidine Deaminase Assay—HIV-1Δvif viruses were harvested from the supernatant of 293T cells at 48 h after transfection, filtered by a 0.45 μm filter, and purified by rate-zonal sedimentation followed by equilibrium density centrifugation, as described previously (19Zhang H. Zhang Y. Spicer T.P. Abbott L.Z. Abbott M. Poiesz B.J. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1993; 9: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The isolated viruses were further washed by cold phosphate-buffered saline and ultracentrifuged for 1 h at 25,000 × g. The viruses were then quantified by p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection and mixed with a lysing buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 40 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Conversely, various oligodeoxynucleotides were 5′-32P-labeled through incubation with T4 kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The sequences for various oligonucleotides were modified from previous designs (13Yu Q.

The purified deoxyoligonucleotides (105 cpm) were incubated with 1 μg (p24 antigen equivalent) of viral lysate in buffer R (40 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 40 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol). After incubation for 4 h at 37 °C, the reactions were then terminated by extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). The extracted deoxyoligonucleotides were then electrophoresized on 15% Tris-borate-EDTA-urea PAGE gel and followed by direct autoradiography. A 32P-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide oligo(U) that contains a dU instead of a dC at position 18 (see Fig. 4A) was treated with 5 units of UNG2 and subsequently 2 n NaOH in parallel to serve as a size marker for the cleaved products. Virion-associated UNG2 and APE Catalytic Activity Assay—The lysate of HIV-1 virions (1 μg of p24 antigen equivalent) prepared as described above was mixed with 105 cpm 5′-32P-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide oligo(U) with and without recombinant UNG2 or APE (Novus Bio) at various concentrations in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm ATP. After incubation for 2 h, the cleaved products were electrophoresized on 15% Tris-borate-EDTA-urea PAGE and followed by direct autoradiography. Immunoblotting Analysis—The lysate of 293T or HLCD4-CAT (3–5 μg totally protein) or the lysate (100–250 ng of p24 antigen equivalent) of purified HIV-1Δvif viruses were subjected to detecting UNG2, APE, or Ugi-Myc. After electrophoresis in SDS-PAGE gel, rabbit polyclonal anti-UNG2 antibody (a gift of Dr. G. Slupphaug), mouse monoclonal anti-APE antibody (Novus Biologicals), and mouse anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) were used, respectively, for detecting different proteins. Quantitative PCR Analysis of HIV-1 Reverse Transcripts—The HIV-1Δvif and HIV-1Δvif/APOBEC3G viruses were produced in 293T cells with and without co-transfected with Ugi-expressing vectors or APE-specific siRNA (SMARTpool) (100 nm). C8166 cells were infected with normalized viruses. After 24 h, cellular DNA was extracted and amplified by PCR with various primer pairs followed by Southern blotting analysis, as described in previous studies (22Zhang H. Dornadula G. Pomerantz R.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2809-2824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gag region was detected by the primer/probe set SK38-SK39/SK19, and the RU5-PBS-5NC region was detected by the primer/probe set M667-M661/SK31. Expression of UNG2-inhbitor Ugi or UNG2-specific siRNA in Virus-producing Cells Can Partially Block Antiviral Activity of APOBEC3G—It has been demonstrated that virion-associated APOBEC3G can convert dC to dU in newly synthesized minus-stranded viral DNA. The dU in newly synthesized viral DNA could be removed by virion-associated UNG2 and leave an abasic site in the DNA chain. This abasic site could be further cleaved by APE. If this hypothesis is correct, inhibition of viri-on-associated UNG2 could lead to less abasic site(s) in newly synthesized viral DNA chains and less degradation of newly synthesized viral DNA, and subsequently, less viral infectivity. Therefore we employed Ugi, a bacteriophage-encoded short polypeptide that can tightly bind to the DNA-binding site of UNG2, to inhibit the catalyzing activity of UNG2 in either virus-producing cells or viral target cells (23Bennett S.E.

Canard B. Querat G. Sire J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 479-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We have transfected Ugi-expressing vector in virus-producing 293T cells or viral target cells (HLCD4-CAT), respectively. The Ugi protein can be detected in 293T cells (Fig. 1A, middle left panel). Its expression does not affect the expression of UNG2 in cells and the incorporation of UNG2 into virions (Fig. 1A, upper panel). Ugi can also be found in HIV-1Δvif virions, possibly because Ugi forms a strong complex with UNG2 in the virus-producing cells and subsequently is packaged into the virions (Fig. 1A, middle right panel). As shown in Fig. 1B, the viruses generated from HIV-1Δvif in the presence of APOBEC3G do not have any infectivity (lane 2). However, when vectors expressing Ugi were transfected to 293T virus-producing cells, the infectivity of HIV-1Δvif in the presence of APOBEC3G can be partially rescued (lane 8). The vector only (cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter) or GFP-expressing vector cannot rescue the virus infectivity (lanes 4 and 6). Conversely, transfection of the vector expressing Ugi-Myc into HLCD4-CAT, the virus target cells, cannot significantly rescue the viral infectivity, indicating that UNG2, which removes dU in the minus-stranded viral DNA, comes from virus-producing cells (Fig. 1C). To verify these observations, we have simultaneously performed similar experiments six times, and the results have been shown in Fig. 1D. The level of viral infectivity rescued by Ugi expression at different ratios to APOBEC3G (1:1, 0.5:1, and 0.25:1) in 293T cells is significantly higher than that without Ugi expression (Fig. 1D, lanes 5, 6, and 7 versus lane 2)(p < 0.001, t test). However, the level of viral infectivity rescued by Ugi expression in HLCD4-CAT cells is not significantly higher than that without Ugi expression (Fig. 1D, lane 8 versus lane 2). These quantitative data further demonstrate that Ugi at various concentrations is able to partially rescue the infectivity of HIV-1Δvif in the presence of APOBEC3G. To confirm that APOBEC3G protein in our experimental system is not overexpressed, we have compared the APOBEC3G expression that resulted from transfection with various amount of APOBEC3G-expressing plasmid with the concentration of APOBEC3G in “non-permissive” primary CD4 T-cells and “permissive” Supt-1 T-cells. Fig. 1E demonstrates that the APOBEC3G expression in our experiment (1 μg of APOBEC3G-expressing plasmid) is lower than the APOBEC3G expression in primary CD4 T-cells, the native target cells for HIV-1 replication. If a very low amount of APOBEC3G-expressing plasmid (0.01 μg) is transfected into 293T cells to generate APOBEC3G protein (Fig. 1E), we have also found that the expression level of APOBEC3G is as low as that in Supt1 T-cells. This amount of APOBEC3G cannot significantly inhibit the infectivity of HIV-1Δvif viruses (Fig. 1F). To further verify that the inhibition of UNG2 in virus-producing cells can rescue the infectivity of HIV-1Δvif in the presence of APOBEC3G, we transfected UNG2-specific siRNA (SMARTpool) into the virus-producing cells. As indicated in Fig. 2A, UNG2-specific siRNA can effectively decrease the expression of UNG2 in 293T cells. When transfected into 293T virus-producing cells, it can also significantly rescue the infectivity of HIV-1Δvif in the presence of APOBEC3G (Fig. 2B, lane 6 versus lane 3). However, transfection into HLCD4-CAT, the viral target cells, cannot effectively rescue the viral infectivity (Fig. 2B, lane 9). Viral Infectivity Suppressed by APOBEC3G Can Be Partially Rescued by APE-specific siRNA—The excision of uracils from DNA by UNG2 results in abasic sites in the minus-stranded viral DNA. The abasic sites could be subsequently cleaved by APE. However, there is no direct evidence showing that the cellular APE participates in the degradation of uracilated-DNA in any viruses. To test the possible involvement of APE in APOBEC3G-induced cDNA degradation, the APE-specific siRNAs (SMARTpool) was chemically synthesized and transfected to 293T cells, and its potent APE-suppressing activity was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 3A). To determine the cells in which APE plays a role, APE-specific siRNA was transfected into 293T virus-producing cells or HLCD4-CAT target cells before viral infection. The viral infectivity was analyzed by CAT assay, as described above. APE-specific siRNA could partially rescue the viral infectivity blocked by APOBEC3G when co-transfected into virus-producing cells (Fig. 3B, lane 6), whereas having much less effect in HLCD4-CAT target cells (Fig. 3C, lane 6). These results indicate that APE is involved in the degradation of APOBEC3G-edited viral DNA. Again, this result was further confirmed by multiple experiments, using either the chemically synthesized SMARTpool of APE-specific siRNA or the U6 promoter-driven APE-specific siRNA pool (Fig. 3D). Our data suggest that APE in virus-producing cells, like UNG2, should be encapsidated in viruses and directly participates in the degradation of newly synthesized viral DNA. With an immunoblotting assay, APE was indeed detected in purified HIV-1Δvif viruses (Fig. 3E). Uracil-containing DNA Can Be Degraded by Virion-associated UNG2 and APE Enzymes—It has been proven that APOBEC3G deaminates the single-stranded oligonucleotide in vitro (13Yu Q. Konig R. Pillai S. Chiles K. Kearney M. Palmer S. Richman D. Coffin J.M. Landau N.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). To examine the cytidine deaminase activity of APOBEC3G in vitro, we have used a similar system. Oligonucleotides containing cytidine from one to five were incubated with the lysate of Δvif/APOBEC3G viruses (Fig. 4A). We found that the cleaved fragments were clearly detected when 5′-32P-labeled single oligonucleotides containing more than two cytidines were incubated with the lysate from HIV-1ΔVif viruses containing APOBEC3G (Fig. 4B). This result indicates that all the required elements for dC to dU deamination, removal of dU from the oligonucleotide and cleavage of the abasic site, are all enclosed in the virions. To further determine whether the viri-on-encapsidated UNG2 and APE are catalytic, we developed an experiment to monitor the virion-associated UNG2 and APE enzymatic activity by the similar method previously described (27Chen R. Le Rouzic E. Kearney J.A. Mansky L.M. Benichou S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28419-28425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this experiment, 5′-32P-labeled uracil-containing oligodeoxynucleotide (oligo(U)) was treated by the viral lysate. If both the virion-associated UNG2 and the virion-associated APE are catalytically active, we assumed that a short length broken DNA fragment should be separated by denaturing PAGE gel without the addition of UNG2 and APE. As shown in Fig. 4C, when 5′-32P-labeled uracil-containing DNA was incubated only with the lysate from Δvif/APOBEC3G viruses or Δvif viruses, the degraded products were clearly detected (lanes 3 and 8), suggesting that the virion-associated UNG2 and APE have the enzymatic ability to degrade the uracil-containing DNA. As additional recombinant UNG2 can enhance the degradation (Fig. 4C, lanes 4, 5, 9, and 10), the virion-associated UNG2 is likely not sufficient to catalyze the removal of dU. However, the addition of APE did not significantly improve the digestion rate (Fig. 4C, lanes 6, 7, 11, and 12), suggesting that virion-associated APE is sufficient to cleave the abasic site. Furthermore, to test whether the uracil excision catalytic activity of virion-associated UNG2 can be inhibited by virion-associated Ugi, viral lysate from Ugi-co-transfected Δvif/APOBEC3G viruses were prepared, and a similar experiment as described in the legend for Fig. 4C was performed. As shown in Fig. 4D, the cleaved products were much less when uracil-containing oligodeoxynucleotide was incubated with the lysate of Δvif/APOBEC3G/Ugi viruses (Fig. 4D, lane 3) than that with the lysate from Δvif/APOBEC3G viruses (Fig. 4D, lane 2). Inhibition of UNG2 and APE Significantly Decrease APOBEC3G-induced Degradation of Newly Synthesized Reverse Transcripts—It has been shown that the newly synthesized viral DNA by reverse transcription was very low in Δvif viruses from non-permissive cells (3Mangeat B. Turelli P. Caron G. Friedli M. Perrin L. Trono D. Nature. 2003; 424: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 14von Schwedler U. Song J. Aiken C. Trono D. J.

To examine the effect of UNG2 and APE inhibitors upon the viral DNA synthesis of HIV-1Δvif/APOBEC3G viruses in the target cells, a semiquantitative PCR was used (22Zhang H. Dornadula G. Pomerantz R.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2809-2824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Chen K. Huang J. Zhang C. Huang S. Nunnari G. Wang F.X. Tong X. Gao L. Nikisher K. Zhang H. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 7645-7657Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). HIV-1Δvif/APOBEC3G viruses were generated from 293T cells with and without various co-transfections. These viruses were then allowed to infect C8166, a CD4 T-cell line. At 24 h after infection, cellular DNA was extracted and amplified by PCR. The late part of minus-stranded DNA (gag region) and plus-stranded DNA (RU5-PBS-5NC region) of Δvif/APOBEC3G viruses were monitored. Fig. 5 indicates that the DNA accumulation of ΔVif/APOBEC3G viruses significantly decreased (lanes 2 and 4). However, Ugi- or APE-specific siRNA can significantly rescue the accumulation of viral DNA (Fig. 5, lanes 6 and 10), indicating that UNG2 and APE are involved in the degradation of APOBEC3G-edited viral DNA. To prove the possible involvements of UNG2 and APE in the antiviral function of APOBEC3G, we have blocked the enzymatic activity of UNG2 and APE, respectively, by the UNG2 inhibitor Ugi, UNG2-specific siRNA, or APE-specific siRNAs. Our data have shown that after catalytically enzymatic activity or expression of UNG2 or APE is decreased in virus-producing cells rather than in virus-targeting cells, the antiviral activity of APOBEC3G is partially inhibited. These findings demonstrate that most of the uracil bases in minus-stranded DNA generated by APOBEC3G will be first removed by excision of virion-associated UNG2 and then degraded by virion-associated APE before integration. This hypothesis is supported by the early observations that less full-length viral DNA is synthesized during the reverse transcriptions of Δvif/APOBEC3G viruses (3Mangeat B. Turelli P. Caron G. Friedli M. Perrin L. Trono D. Nature. 2003; 424: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 14von Schwedler U. Song J. Aiken C. Trono D. J.

Our data suggest that the subsequent degradation pathway perhaps plays a role in the antiviral activity of APOBEC3G.

https://openalex.org/W2012538868,"In eukaryotes, termination of messenger RNA (mRNA) translation is mediated by the release factors eRF1 and eRF3. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism, we have identified a member of the DEAD-box protein (DBP) family, the DEAD-box RNA helicase and mRNA export factor Dbp5, as a player in translation termination. Dbp5 interacts genetically with both release factors and the polyadenlyate-binding protein Pab1. A physical interaction was specifically detected with eRF1. Moreover, we show that the helicase activity of Dbp5 is required for efficient stop-codon recognition, and intact Dbp5 is essential for recruitment of eRF3 into termination complexes. Therefore, Dbp5 controls the eRF3-eRF1 interaction and thus eRF3-mediated downstream events."

Thus, its local concentration at sites of vascular injury or inflammation can be very high relative to normal plasma levels (13Robbie L.A. Young S.P. Bennett B. Booth N.A. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 77: 510-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 14Robbie L.A. Booth N.A. Brown A.J. Bennett B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Structurally, PAI-1 represents an example of the general serpin property of conformational plasticity. PAI-1 exists in multiple conformational states, including active, latent, proteasecomplexed, and cleaved forms (15Lawrence D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Active PAI-1 decays to the latent form with a half-life of 1-2 h at 37 °C, and exposure to denaturants can partially return the latent form to the active state (16Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biological significance of the latent form remains unknown. Like latent PAI-1, the cleaved form is also inactive, but unlike latent PAI-1 this form cannot be reactivated. The labile nature of PAI-1 appears to be critical for its function as a protease inhibitor, and like other serpins, PAI-1 acts as a “suicide inhibitor” that reacts only once with a target protease. This is because during serpin inhibition the protease cleaves the serpin reactive center loop (RCL) to the point of an acyl·enzyme intermediate, and this cleavage is coupled with a major conformational rearrangement of the serpin involving RCL insertion into β-sheet A of the serpin forming an SDS-stable acyl·enzyme complex, in which the PAI-1 structure resembles the cleaved form (17Lawrence D.A.

The association of PAI-1 with these syndromes has led to the suggestion that PAI-1 may contribute to the pathology of disease. However, the mechanistic role that PAI-1 plays in disease development is not clear and is likely to be complex, because PAI-1 can act through at least two distinctly different pathways, either by modulating fibrinolysis through the regulation of plasminogen activators, or by influencing tissue remodeling through the direct regulation of cell migration (31Stefansson S.

These studies indicate that inhibition of PAI-1 activity is efficacious; however, the mechanism of action of this clinically relevant small molecule PAI-1 inactivating drug was not shown. Using PAI-039 as a molecular tool to investigate the inactivation of PAI-1, we have identified a mechanism suggesting the existence of a novel pool of PAI-1 vulnerable to inhibition by compounds that interact at the vitronectin binding domain. PAI-039 was synthesized and characterized for chemical identity and purity at Wyeth Research (Collegeville, PA). Stock solutions were prepared in 100% Me2SO prior to dilution in assay buffer. Human native vitronectin, recombinant human wild-type PAI-1 (either non-glycosylated, expressed, and isolated from Escherichia coli or glycosylated, expressed, and isolated from insect cells), and rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against human PAI-1 were from Molecular Innovations (Southfield, MI). High molecular weight human uPA was from Laboratories Serono S.A. (Aubonne, Switzerland). The chromogenic uPA substrate, pGlu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide, was from Sigma, and the chromogenic tPA substrate, Pefachrome tPA, was from Centerchem Inc. (Norwalk, CT). Polystyrene 96-well Microtest Falcon plates were from BD Biosciences. All supplies and reagents for SDS-PAGE were from Bio-Rad. All supplies and buffers for binding assays with Biacore 3000® sensor chips were from Biacore AB (Uppsala, Sweden). All other chemical reagents used in the study were from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). Direct PAI-1 Activity Assay with Chromogenic tPA/uPA Substrates—All direct chromogenic assays with purified human PAI-1 and site-directed mutants were performed as described previously (53Gorlatova N.V.

For determination of the effect of vitronectin on drug activity, 40 nm PAI-1 was incubated in 200 μl of assay buffer, either alone (control), or with 200 nm vitronectin, or 4 μm bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 23 °C, after which 10 μl of each sample was added to microtiter plate wells containing 80 μl of PAI-039 in assay buffer for final concentrations before substrate addition of either 80, 60, 40, 30, 20, 10, 5, or 0 μm PAI-039. The assay plate was briefly mixed on the plate reader, and then the mixture was incubated at 23 °C for 15 min. Next 10 μl of 50 nm uPA was added to each well, the plate was mixed briefly again, and the mixture was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C before adding 100 μl of substrate. The plate was then incubated at 37 °C for 5 min before reading ΔA405 in kinetic mode for 10 min at 37 °C. The data were plotted against the drug concentration and fit to an IC50 equation (background corrected) using the GraFit Software program (Erithacus Software Ltd., Horley, UK). Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—Direct binding of PAI-039 to PAI-1 and PAI-1 to native human vitronectin was monitored using a Biacore 3000® optical biosensor (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Purified recombinant human latent and active PAI-1 were immobilized at the level of ∼5000 response units (RU), passing working solutions of 20 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, through flow cells on the first chip. The second chip was immobilized with native vitronectin at the level of 600 RU under the same conditions. The reference flow cell surfaces were immobilized with ovalbumin at the level of 5000 RU on the first chip and 600 RU on the second chip, and both served as controls for nonspecific drug binding. Remaining binding sites on the chip surfaces were blocked by 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. All binding reactions were performed in standard HBS-P (0.01 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.005% v/v surfactant P20) buffer, pH 7.4 (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden), containing 10% of Me2SO as running buffer. Binding of PAI-039 to PAI-1 was monitored at 25 °C at a flow rate of 30 μl/min for 2 min, followed by 2 min of dissociation with running buffer. Chip surfaces were regenerated with a 1-min pulse of 2 m NaCl, prepared in running buffer, followed by 2-min washing with running buffer to remove the high salt solution. All injections were performed using the Wizard Customized Application program in an automated mode. Control runs included the binding of several monoclonal antibodies raised against the human PAI-1·tPA complex. Direct binding of PAI-039 to immobilized PAI-1 was measured using 100× dilutions of working solutions in running buffer over a range of concentrations (0.1 to 50 μm). The binding of active and PAI-039-reacted human PAI-1 to vitronectin was studied at 10 nm PAI-1 and 0.08-50 μm PAI-039. All binding experiments were done at least twice and were corrected for background and bulk refractive index by subtraction of the reference flow cell and running buffer responses. All collected data were analyzed with BIAevaluation 3.1 Software (Biacore, AB, Sweden). For binding of PAI-039 to immobilized PAI-1, the apparent affinity was calculated from an equilibrium analysis of the maximum response (RU) at each drug concentration using single binding site model. The inhibition of PAI-1 binding to vitronectin by PAI-039 was analyzed by reacting a constant amount of PAI-1 with increasing concentrations of PAI-039 prior to SPR analysis, and determining the concentration of PAI-1 competent to bind vitronectin from the slope of the association phase of the binding curves. This analysis accurately measures the concentration of PAI-1 able to bind vitronectin, because our previous experiments performed with increasing concentrations of purified active PAI-1 in the absence of PAI-039 have shown that there is a linear relationship between the slope of the initial association phase of PAI-1 binding to vitronectin and the concentration of active PAI-1 (not shown). Reversibility Assay—PAI-1 (9 nm) was incubated in an assay plate, with 80 μm PAI-039 or vehicle in assay buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) at 23 °C for 15 min prior to dilution. The concentrated PAI-1-PAI-039 or PAI-1-vehicle solutions were then serially diluted, 2-fold in parallel, in assay buffer. UPA (10 μl of 100 nm) was then added to each well after dilution of PAI-1-PAI-039 (final volume 100 μl), and the assay plate was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min before adding substrate. After substrate addition the assay plate was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min before reading ΔA405 in kinetic mode for 10 min at 37 °C. The percent restoration of PAI-1 activity at each dilution was calculated from the ratio of the activity in the PAI-039-treated samples to the activity in control samples treated with vehicle only. The final concentrations were PAI-1 (in nm): 4.5, 2.25, 1.125, 0.56, and 0.28; PAI-039 μm: 40, 20, 10, 5, 2.5; and uPA: 5 nm. SDS-PAGE Analysis—16 μl of vehicle or PAI-039 (10, 20, 40, and 80 μm final concentration) diluted in assay buffer were incubated with 2 μl of PAI-1 (500 nm final concentration) for 15 min before addition of 2 μl of uPA or tPA (400 nm final concentration). Samples were then reacted for 5 min at 37 °C, after which 40 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) with β-mercaptoethanol was added to each sample. The samples were boiled for 3 min and separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel run at 200 v for 45 min. The gels were rinsed three times in dH2O prior to Coomassie staining and destaining in dH2O. Gels were scanned using an Epson Expression 1680 flatbed scanner. Molecular Docking—The previously determined structure for the active form of PAI-1 (PDB code: 1B3K) was used as an initial template. This is a stable mutant of PAI-1 that has four mutated residues N150H, K154T, Q319L, and M354I (55Berkenpas M.B. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All hydrogens and the four mutated residues were first minimized using the AMBER force field (56Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. Singh U.C. Ghio C. Alagona G. Profeta S. Weiner P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 765-784Crossref Scopus (4895) Google Scholar). Next PAI-039 was docked to PAI-1 using the induced fit docking protocol developed by Schrodinger. Induced fit docking is based on the docking program Glide with the refinement module in Prime (Schrodinger, Inc.), which was reported to accurately predict ligand binding modes and concomitant structural changes in a receptor. Compounds were initially docked using Standard Precision Glide at reduced van der Waals scaling against three types of proteins: (i) R1, original active form of PAI-1; (ii) R2, the active form of PAI-1 with Arg-76 mutated to Ala; or (iii) R3, the active form of PAI-1 with Arg-118 mutated to Ala. After initial docking, prime refinement and scoring were performed on the initial constructed protein-ligand complex. The residues with in 5 Å of ligand poses were treated as being flexible. Both protonation states of carboxylic acids were considered for PAI-039. Site-directed Mutagenesis—To identify the PAI-1 binding site for PAI-039, a variety of site-directed mutants was constructed using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) as described before (53Gorlatova N.V. Elokdah H. Fan K. Crandall D.L. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16329-16335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Based upon computer modeling, the following amino acid residues were chosen for substitution by alanine: Arg-76, Tyr-79, Lys-80, Thr-93, Thr-94, Asp-95, Phe-114, Arg-118, Thr-120, Lys-122, and His-143. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing throughout the entire PAI-1 coding region of mutant plasmids isolated from three clones of each individual mutant. The functional characterization of these mutants was based on the IC50 of PAI-039 determined by direct chromogenic assay and by SPR analysis of vitronectin binding. PAI-039 Binds to PAI-1 and Inhibits Its Anti-proteolytic Activity against Both tPA and uPA—To examine the capacity of PAI-039 to block PAI-1 inhibitory activity, single step chromogenic assays were performed. For this analysis, purified recombinant PAI-1, either glycosylated or non-glycosylated, was preincubated with increasing concentrations of PAI-039 followed by the addition of uPA or tPA, and the remaining PAI-1 inhibitory activity was determined. These data are shown in Fig. 1, which demonstrates a dose-dependent inhibition of PAI-1 activity by PAI-039 with calculated IC50 values for PAI-1 inactivation by PAI-039 from 9 to 12 μm in this assay system (Table 1). The inhibition profile was similar regardless of the PAI-1 target enzyme, or the glycosylation state of PAI-1, indicating that the effect is specific for PAI-1 and independent of the protease.TABLE 1IC50 values for the inhibition of PAI-1 activity by PAI-039 calculated for the reaction of non-glycosylated and glycosylated PAI-1 with either uPA or tPA in the direct chromogenic assays shown in Fig. 1PAI-1ProteaseIC50μmNon-glycosylatedtPA11.4 ± 0.6uPA9.7 ± 0.9GlycosylatedtPA12.3 ± 1.2uPA8.8 ± 0.8 Open table in a new tab Direct binding studies of the interaction between PAI-1 and PAI-039 were also performed using SPR analysis. For these studies PAI-1 in either the active or latent conformation was coupled to a sensor chip, and the binding of PAI-039 was determined in a Biacore 3000®. These data indicate that PAI-039 binds to PAI-1 in the active conformation (Fig. 2A); however, no specific binding is observed with PAI-1 in the latent conformation (inset, Fig. 2A). Fig. 2A shows the SPR binding curves for PAI-039 to PAI-1, and Fig. 2B shows a plot of the maximal binding of PAI-039 at equilibrium versus the PAI-039 concentration. Fitting the data in panel B with a single binding site model yields an apparent Kd for the binding of PAI-039 to active PAI-1 of ∼15 μm. PAI-039 Binding to PAI-1 Is Reversible—The SPR data in Fig. 2A also demonstrate that the binding of PAI-039 to PAI-1 is reversible, because the drug rapidly dissociates from PAI-1 during the wash phase. Therefore, to determine if the inactivation of PAI-1 by PAI-039 is also reversible, experiments were performed where PAI-1 was incubated with PAI-039 in the absence of plasminogen activators at a concentration that fully inactivates PAI-1 when plasminogen activators are present. After this preincubation step, the samples were diluted to the PAI-039 concentrations indicated in Fig. 3 and reacted with uPA. The restoration of PAI-1 anti-protease activity was then determined in a chromogenic assay as in Fig. 1. These studies demonstrate that the dilution of PAI-039 in the reaction mixtures restored PAI-1 inhibitory activity to levels consistent with the final concentration of drug in each sample (Fig. 3). This indicates that, like the binding of PAI-039 to PAI-1, its ability to block PAI-1 activity is also reversible in the absence of plasminogen activators. PAI-039 Blocks Covalent Complex Formation and Converts PAI-1 to a Substrate for PAs—In the absence of drug, PAI-1 forms stable covalent complexes with uPA or tPA of 93-105 kDa, respectively (Fig. 4, A and B). After pretreatment with increasing concentrations of PAI-039, the intensity of these higher molecular mass bands with both PAs decreased, indicating a reduction in complex formation due to drug-induced PAI-1 inactivation (Fig. 4, A and B). Associated with the loss of high molecular weight complexes is a concomitant increase in the intensity of the band representing the cleaved, substrate form of PAI-1. This suggests that the predominant mechanism of inactivation by PAI-039 is to block productive inhibition of PAs by inducing turnover of the complex and cleavage of PAI-1 by the PAs as a substrate. At the highest PAI-039 concentration tested (80 μm) there was a reduction in the cleaved PAI-1 band compared with the 40 μm dose. This suggests that at high PAI-039 concentrations, well above the IC50 and Kd values, PAI-039 blocks PAI-1 activity by an alternate mechanism. The nature of this secondary mechanism is not clear; however, it is unlikely that this was due to the induction of a conformational change in PAI-1 to the latent form by the drug at these concentrations, because the data in Fig. 3 above indicated that even at these high concentrations of PAI-039 the inactivation of PAI-1 was reversible, whereas the conversion of PAI-1 to the late"
https://openalex.org/W1993984202,"Mutations in the Aptx gene lead to a neurological disorder known as ataxia oculomotor apraxia-1. The product of Aptx is Aprataxin (Aptx), a DNA-binding protein that resolves abortive DNA ligation intermediates. Aprataxin catalyzes the nucleophilic release of adenylate groups covalently linked to 5′ phosphate termini, resulting in termini that can again serve as substrates for DNA ligases. Here we show that Aprataxin acts preferentially on adenylated nicks and double-strand breaks rather than on single-stranded DNA. Moreover, we show that whereas the catalytic activity of Aptx resides within the HIT domain, the C-terminal zinc finger domain provides stabilizing contacts that lock the enzyme onto its high affinity AMP-DNA target site. Both domains are therefore required for efficient AMP-DNA hydrolase activity. Additionally, we find a role for Aprataxin in base excision repair, specifically in the removal of adenylates that arise from abortive ligation reactions that take place at incised abasic sites in DNA. We suggest that Aprataxin may have a general proofreading function in DNA repair, removing DNA adenylates as they arise during single-strand break repair, double-strand break repair, and in base excision repair. Mutations in the Aptx gene lead to a neurological disorder known as ataxia oculomotor apraxia-1. The product of Aptx is Aprataxin (Aptx), a DNA-binding protein that resolves abortive DNA ligation intermediates. Aprataxin catalyzes the nucleophilic release of adenylate groups covalently linked to 5′ phosphate termini, resulting in termini that can again serve as substrates for DNA ligases. Here we show that Aprataxin acts preferentially on adenylated nicks and double-strand breaks rather than on single-stranded DNA. Moreover, we show that whereas the catalytic activity of Aptx resides within the HIT domain, the C-terminal zinc finger domain provides stabilizing contacts that lock the enzyme onto its high affinity AMP-DNA target site. Both domains are therefore required for efficient AMP-DNA hydrolase activity. Additionally, we find a role for Aprataxin in base excision repair, specifically in the removal of adenylates that arise from abortive ligation reactions that take place at incised abasic sites in DNA. We suggest that Aprataxin may have a general proofreading function in DNA repair, removing DNA adenylates as they arise during single-strand break repair, double-strand break repair, and in base excision repair.

Recently, it was shown that Aprataxin resolves abortive DNA ligation intermediates (8Ahel I. Rass U. El-Khamisy S.F. Katyal S. Clements P.M. McKinnon P.J. Caldecott K.W. West S.C. Nature. 2006; 443: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), such as those that arise at “dirty” single-strand breaks formed by oxygen radical attack. Abortive ligation leads to the covalent attachment of an AMP moiety to the 5′ terminus at the break site. Aprataxin repairs these lesions by catalyzing the nucleophilic release of 5′-adenylate groups from the single-strand breaks, resulting in the restoration of 5′ phosphate termini that can be efficiently rejoined.Aprataxin protein has three distinct domains: an N-terminal FHA domain, a central histidine triad (HIT) domain, and a C-terminal domain with a zinc finger motif (3Moreira M.C. Barbot C. Tachi N. Kozuka N. Uchida E. Gibson T. Mendonca P. Costa M. Barros J. Yanagisawa T. Watanabe M. Ikeda Y. Aoki M. Nagata T. Coutinho P. Sequeiros J. Koenig M. Nat.

The catalytic HIT domain (Fig. 1A, upper sequence) is responsible for adenylate hydrolase activity (8Ahel I. Rass U. El-Khamisy S.F. Katyal S. Clements P.M. McKinnon P.J. Caldecott K.W. West S.C.

Finally, although the C-terminal domain of Aprataxin has been implicated in possessing general DNA binding capacity (11Kijas A.W. Harris J.L. Harris J.M. Lavin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13939-13948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the importance of the zinc finger motif (lower sequence) for DNA binding, DNA adenylate binding, and DNA de-adenylation activity has not been addressed. Here, we define the substrate specificity of Aptx and show that the zinc finger motif plays an important role in DNA adenylate recognition and hydrolysis. Furthermore, we show that Aptx fulfills a more general proofreading function in DNA repair, extending beyond the repair of dirty oxidative single-strand breaks.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProteins—Human Aprataxin was PCR-amplified from a HeLa cDNA library (Invitrogen) and cloned into pET41 using the SpeI and BamHI restriction sites. This plasmid expressed recombinant Aptx with an N-terminal GST and a C-terminal His8 tag. The mutants AptxH260A, AptxC319A,C322A, and AptxH260A,C319A,C322A were generated using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Wild-type and mutant GSTAprataxinHis proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus RIL cells at 30 °C for 2 h following induction with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were lysed and Aprataxin purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare).Recombinant human DNA ligase III-XRCC1 complex was a gift from Dr. Tomas Lindahl. T4 DNA ligase was from New England Biolabs and human DNA polymerase β from Trevigen.DNA Substrates—Oligo 1, 5′-ATTCCGATAGTGACTACA-3′; oligo 2, 5′-TGTAGTCACTATCGGAATGAGGGCGACACGGATATG-3′; oligo 3, 5′-CATATCCGTGTCGCCCTC-3′; oligo 4, 5′-CATATCCGTGTCGCCCTCATTCCGATAGTGACTACA-3′; oligo 5, 5′-TGTAGTCACTATCGGAAT-3′; and abasic oligo 1 with a 5′-deoxyribosephosphate (dRP) residue, 5′-dRP-TTCCGATAGTGACTACA-3′, were purchased from Sigma and purified by denaturing gel electrophoresis. 5′-32P labeling was carried out using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (GE Healthcare). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (New England Biolabs) and [α-32P]ddATP (GE Healthcare) were used for 3′-32P labeling.5′-32P-labeled oligo 4, alone or annealed to oligo 2, was used in DNA binding assays. The nicked substrate was prepared by annealing 5′-32P-labeled oligo 1 with oligos 2 and 3. 5′-32P-labeled oligo 1 was adenylated as described (8Ahel I. Rass U. El-Khamisy S.F. Katyal S. Clements P.M. McKinnon P.J. Caldecott K.W. West S.C. Nature. 2006; 443: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), purified and used as AMP-single-stranded DNA, or annealed with oligo 5 to create AMP-double-stranded DNA or oligos 2 and 3 to create AMP-nicked DNA.For the abasic nicked DNA substrate, abasic oligo 1 was 3′-labeled using [32P]ddATP and annealed with oligos 2 and 3. The abasic nicked DNA was then adenylated with human DNA ligase III-XRCC1, and the adenylated 18dRP oligo1 was repurified and annealed with oligos 2 and 3 to form the final substrate. For the nicked control, oligo 1 (in this case synthesized with a terminal 5′-phosphate) was 3′-32P-labeled and the adenylated nicked substrate was prepared essentially as described (8Ahel I. Rass U. El-Khamisy S.F. Katyal S. Clements P.M. McKinnon P.J. Caldecott K.W. West S.C.

After 1 or 2 min of incubation at 37 °C, reactions were stopped by addition of formamide and heated for 3 min at 90 °C.

Incubation was for 2 min at room temperature. Reactions were stopped by addition of formamide loading buffer, and denatured DNA was analyzed by 10% denaturing PAGE followed by autoradiography. For time course experiments, reactions (25 μl) contained 50 nm DNA and 0.2 nm Aptx. DNA was analyzed by 10% denaturing PAGE and quantified using a Storm 840 phosphorimaging system (GE Healthcare). Hydrolysis reactions using whole cell extracts were performed as described (8Ahel I. Rass U. El-Khamisy S.F. Katyal S. Clements P.M. McKinnon P.J. Caldecott K.W. West S.C. Nature. 2006; 443: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 40 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5% glycerol.DNA Binding Assays—Binding reactions (15 μl) contained DNA (50 nm) and Aprataxin in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 30 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5% glycerol. Where indicated, reactions contained 300 ng of poly[dI·dC]. Incubation was for 10 min at room temperature. Reactions were then put on ice and analyzed immediately by 4% non-denaturing PAGE using 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA as the running buffer at 4 °C followed by autoradiography.RESULTSSubstrate Specificity of Aprataxin—It was shown previously that Aprataxin acts upon adenylated nicked duplex DNA to remove covalently bound AMP, leaving a 5′-phosphate at the nick that can be ligated to a proximal 3′-OH group (8Ahel I. Rass U. El-Khamisy S.F. Katyal S. Clements P.M. McKinnon P.J. Caldecott K.W. West S.C. Nature. 2006; 443: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). To further characterize the DNA de-adenylation activity of human Aprataxin and to define the specific contribution of each domain of the protein, we used a mutational analysis approach to produce four forms of Aprataxin: 1) the wild-type protein (Aptx), 2) an active site mutant AptxH260A with a non-functional HIT domain, 3) AptxC319A,322A, which is mutated for the critical cysteine residues in the putative C-terminal zinc finger motif, and 4) AptxH260A,319A,322A, in which the mutation in the active site HIT domain is combined with mutations in the zinc finger motif (Fig. 1, A and B). For direct comparison, all proteins carried an N-terminal GST tag and a C-terminal His8 tag, which allowed their purification to near homogeneity (Fig. 1C). They will hereafter be referred to by their protein name and respective mutation(s). Control experiments have shown that the specific activity of GST- and His-tagged wild-type Aprataxin on adenylated DNA is comparable with that of untagged Aprataxin (data not shown).First, we compared the activity of wild-type Aprataxin on single- and double-stranded DNA. In these experiments, each substrate contained the same 32P-labeled adenylated 18-mer oligonucleotide, and de-adenylation was monitored by its increased mobility through a denaturing gel following removal of covalently bound AMP. We found that Aprataxin acted preferentially on duplex DNA containing an adenylate residue at the 5′ terminus of a nick (Fig. 1D, lanes 9–12) or double-strand break (lanes 5–8) compared with adenylated single-stranded DNA (lanes 1–4). Time course experiments using limiting enzyme concentrations showed that the de-adenylation activity with double-stranded DNA was ∼3× greater than that observed with single-stranded DNA (Fig. 1E).To determine whether Aprataxin exhibits a different binding affinity for the various DNAs, we carried out electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Aprataxin bound linear (Fig. 2, lanes 6–8) or nicked (lanes 10–12) duplex DNA more tightly than single-stranded DNA (lanes 2–4), consistent with previous studies (11Kijas A.W. Harris J.L. Harris J.M. Lavin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13939-13948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2DNA binding by Aprataxin. Reactions contained single-stranded DNA, double-stranded DNA, or nicked DNA and Aprataxin (50, 250, and 500 nm) as indicated. Protein-DNA complexes were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and detected by autoradiography. Roman numerals mark the position of three distinct protein-DNA complexes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out using nicked duplex DNA substrates, we observed three distinct protein-DNA complexes (designated I, II, and III). These complexes were observed with both nicked duplex (Fig. 3, lanes 2–4) and adenylated nicked duplex (lanes 15–17) DNA. Given that Aprataxin is catalytically active under the conditions of this assay and de-adenylation occurs (data not shown), it was necessary to carry out similar reactions with AptxH260A, containing an inactivating mutation in the HIT domain. Using AptxH260A we observed enhanced complex formation with the nicked adenylated substrate (compare lanes 8–10 with lanes 21–23). Furthermore, in contrast to complexes formed by wild-type Aptx, we found that the protein-DNA complexes formed between AptxH260A and the adenylated substrate were resistant to competition with a 30-fold excess of poly[dI·dC] (lanes 24–26). We also found that the poly[dI·dC] converted complexes III and II to the least retarded complex I. Control reactions with catalytically active Aptx, and with AptxH260A and unadenylated nicked duplex DNA, showed that complex formation was competed away by the presence of poly[dI·dC] (lanes 5–7, 11–13, and 18–20). Based on these results, we suggest that complex I represents Aprataxin bound at the site of the nick, an interaction that is stabilized by the adenylate moiety, and that complexes II and III are formed by the binding of Aprataxin to flanking regions of DNA. Poly[dI·dC] competes away the general DNA binding but is unable to disrupt the specific complex formed between catalytically inactive AptxH260A and its target, the adenylated residue.FIGURE 3Specific interaction of Aprataxin with adenylated residues. Reactions contained the indicated nicked or adenylated nicked substrates and either wild-type or catalytically inactive AptxH260A (50, 250, and 500 nm). Poly[dI·dC] was present where indicated. Protein-DNA complexes were analyzed as described in Fig. 2 legend.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These results show that Aprataxin has the ability to bind duplex DNA, possibly enabling the protein to scan the genome for sites of adenylation. When such a site is encountered, Aprataxin forms a high affinity complex that (with wild-type protein) leads to rapid de-adenylation.Binding of Aptx to Duplex DNA Is Mediated by the C-terminal Zinc Finger—To date, the precise role of the putative zinc finger motif of Aprataxin has not been established. We therefore assessed the contribution of the zinc finger to DNA binding by carrying out site-directed mutagenesis to convert the zinc-coordinating cysteines (residues Cys-319 and Cys-322) to alanine. A comparison of AptxH260A with AptxH260A,C319A,C322A showed that disruption of the zinc finger resulted in a significant loss of DNA binding activity (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 6). Similar results were obtained with AptxH260A,C319A,C322A and the nicked DNA adenylate, although in this case some residual binding was observed (lanes 9 and 12). Residual binding to the nicked adenylated DNA resulted in the formation of complex I only, indicating that this complex results from a specific interaction with the adenylated residue at the nick.FIGURE 4The zinc finger motif of Aptx is required for substrate recognition and hydrolysis. A, electrophoretic mobility shift assay reactions contained wild-type or mutant Aptx and linear, nicked, or adenylated nicked DNA as indicated. Poly[dI·dC] was included in the reactions of lanes 10–12. Protein-DNA complexes were analyzed as described in the Fig. 2 legend. B, DNA deadenylation reactions contained wild-type Aptx or the zinc finger mutant AptxC319A,C322A with adenylated nicked duplex DNA. Products were analyzed by denaturing PAGE and detected by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Taken together, the results shown in Figs. 3 and 4 show that Aprataxin forms a stable complex with nicked adenylated DNA that is resistant to competition when challenged by excess duplex DNA. The stability of this complex is dependent upon the C-terminal zinc finger of the protein.Efficient De-adenylation Requires the Zinc Finger Motif—When the zinc finger mutant AptxC319A,C322A was analyzed for its ability to promote de-adenylation, we observed a near 100-fold reduction in activity compared with wild-type Aprataxin (Fig. 4B). This result demonstrates that the zinc finger domain is important for efficient hydrolysis of DNA adenylates. Even though the catalytic domain of AptxC319A,C322A is intact, the loss of its zinc finger DNA binding module renders Aptx inefficient.Adenylated Abasic Nicks Constitute a Novel Substrate for Aptx—Previously, we showed that Aprataxin acts upon nicked adenylated DNA substrates such as those that might be produced by abortive ligation reactions that take place at sites of oxidative damage (8Ahel I. Rass U. El-Khamisy S.F. Katyal S. Clements P.M. McKinnon P.J. Caldecott K.W. West S.C. Nature. 2006; 443: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). An additional and important target substrate might also arise from premature ligation of nicked abasic sites (AP sites) resulting from the removal of damaged bases by monofunctional DNA glycosylases such as human UNG, SMUG-1, MPG, TDG, and MYH, followed by AP endonuclease 1 incision. To test this hypothesis, we first determined whether abortive ligation reactions occurred at base excision repair (BER) intermediates and therefore synthesized a model substrate with a dRP residue at the 5′ terminus of the nick. When incubated with human DNA ligase III-XRCC1 complex, we found that ligation of the abasic nick took place (Fig. 5A, lanes 2–3) with an efficiency that was ∼5–10 times below that observed with normal nicked DNA (lanes 7–8 and data not shown). Similar results were observed with T4 DNA ligase (lanes 4–5 and 9–10) as described previously (12Goffin C. Bailly V. Verly W.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 875-8771Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 13Bogenhagen D.F. Pinz K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7888-7893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, in reactions containing human DNA ligase III-XRCC1 and the abasic substrate, we also observed abortive ligation reactions culminating in the accumulation of DNA adenylates (indicated as AMP-18dRP in Fig. 5A, lanes 2–3).FIGURE 5Actions of Aprataxin with adenylated abasic nick substrates. A, human DNA ligase III-XRCC1 complex promotes the ligation of abasic nicked DNAs, but abortive ligation reactions give rise to adenylated products. Ligation reactions, containing 3′-32P-labeled abasic nicked or control nicked DNA substrate, with T4 DNA ligase or human DNA ligase III-XRCC1, were incubated for 1 min (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) or 2 min (lanes 3, 5, 8, and 10). Products were analyzed by denaturing PAGE and detected by autoradiography. The abasic 18-mer and the ligation product containing the abasic 18-mer are marked with dRP. B, ligation reactions containing human DNA ligase III-XRCC1 and abasic nicked DNA substrate were incubated for 1 min. Wild-type Aptx (10 nm) was present in the reaction shown in lane 3. Products were analyzed by denaturing PAGE and detected by autoradiography. C, hydrolysis reactions contained wild-type Aptx and adenylated nicked or abasic nicked DNA as indicated. Products were analyzed by denaturing PAGE and detected by autoradiography. D, adenylated abasic nicks (50 nm) were treated with whole cell extracts (1 μg of total protein) from normal and AOA1 lymphoblastoid human cell lines (Ap1 and Ap3) as indicated. Incubation was for 5 min at 37 °C, and the products were analyzed by denaturing PAGE and detected by autoradiography. E, reactions contained adenylated abasic nicked DNA (50 nm) with wild-type Aptx (2 nm) or polymerase β (20 nm) as indicated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1% glycerol, 20 μm each of dCTP, dGTP, dATP, and dTTP. Incubation was for 15 min at 37 °C, and the products were analyzed by denaturing PAGE and detected by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test whether these DNA adenylates lacking a 5′-terminal base at the nick serve as a substrate for Aptx, ligation reactions with human DNA ligase III-XRCC1 were supplemented with Aptx (Fig. 5B). In these reactions, we did not observe the presence of any DNA adenylates but instead observed an increase in ligation products (lane 3). These results indicate that without the actions of Aprataxin, abortive ligation events at BER intermediates could lead to a relatively high incidence of DNA adenylate formation.When the efficiency of AMP hydrolysis by Aprataxin at normal and abasic nicks was compared, we found that the abasic DNA adenylate served as a substrate for Aptx and was hydrolyzed with an efficiency that was ∼5 times lower than that observed with normal adenylated nicked DNA (Fig. 5C, compare lanes 2–4 with 6–8). Taken together, these data lead us to suggest that abortive ligation reactions that take place at BER intermediates may require Aprataxin for efficient repair and restoration of the DNA backbone. This notion is supported by the observation that adenylated abasic nicks persist in whole cell extracts prepared from the AOA1 patient cell lines Ap1 and Ap3 (Fig. 5D, lanes 3 and 4), while AMP hydrolysis can be observed in normal extracts (lane 2). In agreement with this, we found that human DNA polymerase β, which is known to add dNTPs to 3′ termini at dRP sites (14Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 445-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), is unable to utilize its lyase activity to remove adenylated dRP termini (Fig. 5E, lane 2).DISCUSSIONIn this work we have shown that Aprataxin forms specific complexes with nicked adenylated DNA and promotes the repair and restoration of 5′ termini that are adenylated by abortive ligation reactions. The actions of Aprataxin are essential in non-replicative cells, such as neuronal cells, which otherwise as a consequence of oxidative damage would accumulate adenylates that may pose a block to the transcriptional machinery. Analyses of the DNA binding capacity of Aprataxin revealed that the protein binds undamaged duplex DNA in agreement with previous observations (11Kijas A.W. Harris J.L. Harris J.M. Lavin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13939-13948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, competition studies using catalytically inactive AptxH260A showed that the protein forms a specific and stable complex with nicked adenylated duplex DNA. The binding and de-adenylation of single-stranded DNA was less than that observed with duplex substrates.As far as we are aware, Aprataxin is the only enzyme capable of de-adenylating AMP-DNA substrates. However, like other members of the HIT superfamily, Aprataxin can act upon AMP-NH2 or AppppA, but the catalytic activity observed with these substrates is 3–4 orders of magnitude less than that observed with adenylated DNA (8Ahel I.

Lavin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13939-13948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is therefore our opinion that the neurological disorder (AOA1) associated with Aprataxin loss relates to the loss of DNA de-adenylation activity.Taken together with our previous observations (8Ahel I.

Nature. 2006; 443: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), the data presented here indicate that adenylates present in duplex DNA are the physiological substrates for Aprataxin. The specific action of Aptx on damaged duplex DNA is consistent with observations showing that Aptx associates with the DNA ligase III-XRCC1 and DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 complexes (4Clements P.M.

https://openalex.org/W2142850371,"It was recently discovered that subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations of cortical neurons can precisely repeat during spontaneous activity, seconds to minutes apart, both in brain slices and in anesthetized animals. These repeats, also called cortical motifs, were suggested to reflect a replay of sequential neuronal firing patterns. We searched for motifs in spontaneous activity, recorded from the rat barrel cortex and from the cat striate cortex of anesthetized animals, and found numerous repeating patterns of high similarity and repetition rates. To test their significance, various statistics were compared between physiological data and three different types of stochastic surrogate data that preserve dynamical characteristics of the recorded data. We found no evidence for the existence of deterministically generated cortical motifs. Rather, the stochastic properties of cortical motifs suggest that they appear by chance, as a result of the constraints imposed by the coarse dynamics of subthreshold ongoing activity."

However, even when RecO and RecR proteins are provided at optimal concentrations, the loading of RecA protein is surprisingly slow, typically proceeding with a lag of 10 min or more. The rate-limiting step in RecOR-promoted RecA nucleation is the binding of RecOR protein to ssDNA, which is inhibited by SSB protein despite the documented interaction between RecO and SSB. Full activity of RecOR is seen only when RecOR is preincubated with ssDNA prior to the addition of SSB. The slow binding of RecOR to SSB-coated ssDNA involves the C terminus of SSB. When an SSB variant that lacks the C-terminal 8 amino acids is used, the capacity of RecOR to facilitate RecA loading onto the ssDNA is largely abolished.

Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 560-603Google Scholar). Formation of the active filament requires ATP and Mg2+ ion. When bound to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), 3The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; RMPs, recombination mediator proteins; SSB, single-stranded DNA-binding (protein); DTT, dithiothreitol; RPA, replication protein A. 3The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; RMPs, recombination mediator proteins; SSB, single-stranded DNA-binding (protein); DTT, dithiothreitol; RPA, replication protein A. RecA hydrolyzes ATP (kcat = 30 min–1). The active filament can promote the exchange of DNA strands between homologous DNA molecules in vitro (7Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RecA filament formation occurs in at least two distinct phases (8Pugh B.F. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 479-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Filament nucleation occurs first and involves the binding of one or a few RecA protomers to DNA. Nucleation is the rate-limiting phase in filament formation and can, itself, be broken down into several discernible steps (8Pugh B.F. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 479-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Filament nucleation is followed by filament extension in the 5′ to 3′ direction along the DNA (9Register III, J.C. Griffith J. J.

Extension is rapid and occurs via cooperative addition of RecA monomers to the 3′ proximal end of the filament. RecA filament disassembly requires ATP hydrolysis and also occurs in the 5′ to 3′ direction (12Bork J.M. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol.

RecA filament growth in the 3′ to 5′ direction has not been observed under conditions in which RecA-mediated ATP hydrolysis occurs. RecA activity is regulated at many levels. RecA transcription is controlled by the LexA repressor protein (13Defais M. Devoret R. Encyclopedia of Life Sciences.

Finally, E. coli possesses many protein factors that directly inhibit or promote recombination (18Kuzminov A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Proteins that regulate RecA activity exert their control primarily by affecting the kinetics of filament formation and disassembly. Proteins that facilitate the formation of the filaments of RecA-class recombinases are called recombination mediator proteins (RMPs) (19Beernik H.T.H. Morrical S.W. Trends Biochem.

Other proteins inhibit RecA filament formation (the RecX protein) or stabilize intact RecA filaments (the DinI protein) (29Drees J.C. Lusetti S.L. Chitteni-Pattu S. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. Mol.

For example, the DinI protein inhibits the RecA-mediated autocatalytic cleavage of UmuD protein (33Yasuda T. Morimatsu K. Kato R. Usukura J. Takahashi M. Ohmori H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1192-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), a reaction required to activate DNA polymerase V (34Schlacher K. Pham P. Cox M.M. Goodman M.F. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 406-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Similarly, the Bacillus subtilis RecU protein can inhibit the ATPase activity of that organism's RecA protein (35Carrasco B. Ayora S. Lurz R. Alonso J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3942-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). RMPs and other regulators often interact and compete. The RecF protein, for example, antagonizes the activity of the RecX protein (26Lusetti S.L. Hobbs M.D. Stohl E.A. Chitteni-Pattu S. Inman R.B. Seifert H.S. Cox M.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These interactions provide a complex network for RecA filament control, the understanding of which is expanding as experiments progress (26Lusetti S.L. Hobbs M.D. Stohl E.A. Chitteni-Pattu S.

During the extension phase of RecA filament formation, SSB protein has a positive effect by removing the DNA secondary structure that would otherwise limit filament extension (37Kowalczykowski S.C. Clow J. Somani R. Varghese A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, when SSB is prebound to ssDNA, it creates a significant kinetic barrier to RecA nucleation (27Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30005-30013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Umezu K. Chi N.W. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3875-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Overcoming this barrier is the function of the RMPs (18Kuzminov A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 751-813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30005-30013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Umezu K. Chi N.W. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3875-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The E. coli RecF, RecO, and RecR proteins have all been implicated genetically in the nucleation of RecA filaments onto SSB-coated ssDNA. The phenotypes of mutations in the three genes are very similar, defining them as an epistatic group (5Clark A.J. Sandler S.J. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 20: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 38Smith G.R. Genome. 1989; 31: 520-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Mutations in all three genes are suppressed by recA441 and recA803 mutations (39Wang T.C. Chang H.Y. Hung J.L. Mutat. Res. 1993; 294: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In vitro, the same RecA441 (previously tif; E38K, I298V) and RecA803 (V37M) proteins exhibit an enhanced capacity to displace SSB and bind ssDNA (40Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 861-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 41Madiraju M.V. Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Clark A.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10529-10535Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, a gene in bacteriophage λ called ninB or orf (described further below) has been identified that can replace recF, recO, and recR functions in lambda recombination (42Sawitzke J.A. Stahl F.W. Genetics. 1992; 130: 7-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Sawitzke J.A. Stahl F.W. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6730-6737Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In vivo, mutant bacteria missing any of the recFOR functions exhibit a delayed activation of the SOS response that might reflect slow formation of the RecA filaments required to facilitate LexA cleavage (44Madiraju M.V. Templin A. Clark A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6592-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 45Whitby M.C. Lloyd R.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). E. coli strains in which SSB is overexpressed exhibit a recFOR-like phenotype (46Moreau P.L. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2493-2500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), again suggesting that these proteins function together in overcoming the barrier to RecA filament nucleation represented by SSB. However, when utilized in vitro, the RecO and RecR proteins appear necessary and sufficient for the nucleation of RecA on SSB-coated ssDNA (10Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 27Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30005-30013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of RecF protein has a neutral or inhibitory effect under most experimental conditions (10Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 26Lusetti S.L. Hobbs M.D. Stohl E.A. Chitteni-Pattu S. Inman R.B. Seifert H.S. Cox M.M. Mol.

The one exception to this trend is a report of a RecF enhancement in reactions involving gapped DNAs (28Morimatsu K. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1337-1347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). We have concentrated here on the function of the RecOR protein complex. The recO gene was discovered in a genetic screen for genes involved in hfr recombination (48Kolodner R. Fishel R.A. Howard M. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1060-1066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RecO protein (27 kDa) contains an oligonucleotide-binding fold (OB-fold) in its N-terminal domain and binds both single- and double-stranded DNA (49Leiros I. Timmins J. Hall D.R. McSweeney S. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 906-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 50Luisi-DeLuca C. Kolodner R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 124-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). RecO catalyzes the annealing of complementary oligonucleotides and can also catalyze invasion of duplex DNA by a complementary ssDNA (50Luisi-DeLuca C. Kolodner R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 124-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 51Kantake N. Madiraju M. Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15327-15332Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The RecR protein has no known intrinsic enzymatic or DNA binding activities, although the RecR homologs in Deinococcus radiodurans and B. subtilis both bind to DNA (52Alonso J.C. Stiege A.C. Dobrinski B. Lurz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1424-1429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Lee B.I. Kim K.H. Park S.J. Eom S.H. Song H.K. Suh S.W.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7313-7322Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The C-terminal TOPRIM domain of RecR has been implicated as the interaction site with both RecO and RecF, suggesting that these proteins may compete for RecR binding (56Honda M. Inoue J. Yoshimasu M. Ito Y. Shibata T. Mikawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18549-18559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The competition between RecF and RecO for RecR protein binding has been documented in vitro (47Bork J.M. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7313-7322Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). RecR increases the apparent affinity of both RecO and RecF for DNA (27Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30005-30013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 54Webb B.L. Cox M.M.

Cell. 1997; 91: 347-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The RecO and RecR proteins work together as RecA mediators. Stimulation of RecA binding to SSB-bound ssDNA does not occur in the presence of either RecO or RecR protein alone (10Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 27Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30005-30013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Morimatsu K. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1337-1347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The original model for RecOR-facilitated nucleation of RecA filaments onto SSB-coated ssDNA (RecAOR nucleation) calls for RecOR interaction with SSB and recruitment of RecA by the RecOR complex followed by filament nucleation (27Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30005-30013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RecR protein (and probably RecO protein) remains bound to ssDNA after RecA nucleation in vitro and does not inhibit DNA strand exchange reactions (47Bork J.M. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7313-7322Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). At least two types of mechanisms for RecAOR nucleation can be envisioned. RecOR might stimulate RecA nucleation by creating a suitable DNA binding site on SSB-coated ssDNA. The generation of such a site would permit RecA to nucleate onto the ssDNA through the steps employed when SSB is absent. Another possible mechanism for stimulation involves a RecOR-mediated activation of the intrinsic capacity of RecA to displace SSB and nucleate on ssDNA. This mechanism, which assigns more importance to a RecA-RecOR interaction, is suggested by the greatly enhanced capacity of the RecAΔC17 mutant protein to displace SSB in the absence of RecOR (17Eggler A.L. Lusetti S.L. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16389-16396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These two pathways are not mutually exclusive. Regardless of the mechanism of RecOR action, the rate at which RecA nucleates onto SSB-coated ssDNA in the presence of RecOR is surprisingly slow. Even though the effect of RecOR is dramatic, by decreasing the lag in RecA protein binding from 40+ min to ∼10, the remaining 10-min lag for the functional RecOR complex appeared slow for an activity that must efficiently repair replication forks. The molecular basis of that 10-min lag is the focus of this report. Enzymes and Reagents—The wild-type RecA protein was purified as described previously (16Lusetti S.L. Shaw J.J. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16381-16388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The E. coli RecO (10Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) were purified using established protocols as was the wild-type D. radiodurans SSB protein (58Eggington J.M. Haruta N. Wood E.A. Cox M.M. BMC Microbiol. 2004; 4: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The E. coli RecF protein was overexpressed by transforming pBLW20 (54Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31397-31404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) into E. coli strain STL2669 (a generous gift from Susan T. Lovett) (16Lusetti S.L. Shaw J.J. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16381-16388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and the resultant strain was cultured at 37 °C in LB medium with appropriate antibiotics to an OD of 1.0. Overexpression of RecF protein then was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.4 μm. The culture was incubated for 3 h before the cells were harvested. RecF protein was purified using the protocol established by Webb et al. (54Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31397-31404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The concentration of each protein was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using their respective extinction coefficients: ϵ280 = 2.23 × 104 m–1 cm–1 for RecA and all RecA mutants (59Craig N.L. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8039-8044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); ϵ280 = 2.3 × 104 m–1 cm–1 for RecO (51Kantake N. Madiraju M. Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl.

BMC Microbiol. 2004; 4: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The RPA protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was a generous gift from Patrick Sung. Its concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient ϵ280 = 8.8 × 104 m–1 cm–1 (62Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). All bacterial protein concentrations are reported in terms of monomers, including SSB. RPA concentrations are reported in terms of heterotrimers. Unless otherwise noted, all reagents were purchased from Fisher and were of the highest grade available. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was purchased from Gold Bio Technology. DTT was obtained from Research Organics. Tris base was obtained from Research Products International. Phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase, ATP, lactate dehydrogenase, potassium glutamate, β-mercaptoethanol, and NADH were purchased from Sigma. Purification of SSBΔC8—The plasmid encoding the SSBΔC8 protein was prepared by PCR using wild-type E. coli ssb gene as a template. The SSBΔC8 mutant was created using a primer designed to replace amino acid 170 of the wild-type ssb gene with a stop codon and a primer complementary to the wild-type N terminus. The PCR product was cloned into pET21A to generate pEAW393 and transformed into BL21(DE3). SSBΔC8 protein expression was induced at 37 °C by the addition of 1.0 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when cultures reached 1.0 A600. After harvesting, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.3), 200 mm NaCl, 15 mm spermidine trichloride, 1 mm EDTA, 10% sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. The cells were lysed by adding lysozyme to 200 μg/ml for 30 min followed by sonication. Sodium deoxycholate was added dropwise to 0.05% and incubated for 30 min with slow stirring. SSBΔC8 was precipitated by the addition of ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 150 mg/ml and further purified by heparin FF and S-100 chromatography. SSBΔC8 was stored in a storage buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.3), 500 mm NaCl, 50% glycerol, 1 mm DTT. DNA Substrates—Bacteriophage ϕX174 circular single-stranded DNA (virion) was purchased from New England Biolabs. ϕX174 RF I supercoiled circular duplex DNA was purchased from Invitrogen. Full-length linear duplex DNA was generated by the digestion of ϕX174 RF I DNA (5386 bp) with the XhoI restriction endonuclease under the conditions suggested by the enzyme supplier. The digested DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) followed by ethanol precipitation. Circular ssDNA from bacteriophage M13mp8 (7229 nt) was prepared using previously described methods (63Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. Advances in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980: 116-125Google Scholar, 64Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 20-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (3416) Google Scholar, 65Neuendorf S.K. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8276-8282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of M13 ssDNA were determined by absorbance at 260 nm, using 9.25 mm–1 A260–1 as the extinction coefficient. All DNA concentrations are given in μm nucleotides. RecA ATP Hydrolysis Assay—The DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity of RecA protein was observed via a coupled spectrophotometric enzyme assay (66Morrical S.W. Lee J. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1482-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 67Lindsley J.E. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9043-9054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Absorbance measurements were taken with a Varian Cary 300 dual-beam spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature controller and 12-position cell chamber. The cell path length and band pass were 0.5 cm and 2 nm, respectively. The regeneration of ATP from ADP and phosphoenolpyruvate driven by the oxidation of NADH can be followed by a decrease in absorbance. Although the absorbance maximum for NADH occurs at 340 nm, absorbance was measured at 380 nm to remain within the linear range of the spectrophotometer for the duration of the experiment. Concentrations of NADH were calculated using an extinction coefficient of ϵ380 = 1.21 mm–1 cm–1 at 380 nm. Rates of ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis and lag times (τ) were measured at 37 °C in a reaction mixture (450 μl) containing 25 mm Tris-OAc (pH 7.5, 80% cation), 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 3 mm ATP, and 1 mm DTT. An ATP regeneration system (3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase) and a coupling system (3 mm NADH, 10 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 3 mm potassium glutamate) was also included. The final pH after the addition of all reaction components was 7.6. Concentrations of DNA and proteins, as well as orders of addition, are reported in the text and in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8. The figures indicate “RecOR” when these proteins were added to reactions as a mixture. When a protein was omitted from a reaction, the appropriate storage buffer was added to compensate for volume and storage buffer components. The storage buffer for wild-type RecA includes 20 mm Tris-Cl (80% cation), 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% (w/v) glycerol, and 1 mm DTT. RecF, RecO, and RecR proteins were stored in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 60% (w/v) glycerol, and 1 mm DTT. The SSB protein was stored in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.3), 500 mm NaCl, 50% (w/v) glycerol, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol.FIGURE 2RecAOR filaments promote DNA strand exchange. Reactions carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures” contained 4 μm RecA protein, 3 μm circular M13mp8 ssDNA, 3 mm ATP, 0.3 μm SSB, and (where indicated) 1 μm RecR protein and 0.1 μm RecO protein. A, ATPase traces reflecting different orders of addition. Adding RecA protein prior to SSB essentially eliminates any lag in the achievement of steady state in the ATPase assay. Characteristic lags seen when SSB is added first are exacerbated if RecOR is not present. B, if RecA is added prior to SSB, DNA strand exchange is efficient in the presence or absence of RecOR. C, if RecA protein is added after SSB, DNA strand exchange is delayed, particularly so if RecOR is not present. D, quantitation of the data shown in B and C. Filled markers, RecA added before SSB either with (square) or without (diamond) RecOR. Open markers, SSB added before RecA either with ("

Endofin, a member of the FYVE domain protein family, has been suggested to regulate membrane trafficking. In this study, we report that endofin functions as a scaffold protein to facilitate TGF-β signaling. Overexpression of endofin FYVE domain-deletion mutants inhibited TGF-β-induced expression of CAGA-luciferase. Knockdown of endogenous endofin expression by RNA interference specifically led to reduction of the transcriptional responses of TGF-β, but had no effect on BMP- or Wnt1-induced reporter expression. Furthermore, in endofin small interfering RNA-expressing stable cells, TGF-β-mediated expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and p21Cip1 was significantly reduced, and TGF-β-promoted apoptosis was also impaired. We further showed that endofin could interact with Smad4 and TGF-β type I receptors. Reduction of endogenous endofin expression resulted in a decrease of TGF-β-induced Smad2 phosphorylation and Smad2-Smad4 complex formation. Together, our findings suggest that endofin facilitates TGF-β signaling as a scaffold protein to promote the R-Smad-Smad4 complex formation by bringing Smad4 to the proximity of the receptor complex.

They signal through specific cell-surface transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors, known as type I and type II receptors. Ligand binding promotes the formation of the receptor complex where the type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor. The activated type I receptor in turn phosphorylates the downstream effectors, the receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), which then form a complex with Smad4. In the nucleus, the Smad complex regulates the expression of TGF-β-targeted genes (1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3975) Google Scholar, 2Heldin C.H.

Several scaffolding proteins have been suggested to mediate TGF-β signal transduction through their interaction with the receptor complexes and/or the Smads (7Moustakas A. Souchelnytskyi S. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4359-4369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One example is SARA (Smad anchor for receptor activation), a FYVE domain-containing protein that interacts directly with non-activated Smad2/3 and the TGF-β receptors complex, thus forming a bridge between the receptors and R-Smad and assisting the specific phosphorylation of Smad2/3 by the type I receptor (8Tsukazaki T.

Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). SARA has also been suggested to target the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 to receptor complexes and negatively modulate type I receptor activity (11Bennett D. Alphey L. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent study showed that SARA is required for targeting to the spindle machinery of a subtype of endosomes containing Dpp and its receptor Tkv to ensure the equal segregation of Dpp signaling to two daughter cells (12Bokel C. Schwabedissen A. Entchev E. Renaud O. Gonzalez-Gaitan M. Science. 2006; 314: 1135-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate) is another FYVE-domain-containing protein and can facilitate Smad2 activation in cooperation with SARA (13Miura S. Takeshita T. Asao H. Kimura Y. Murata K. Sasaki Y. Hanai J.I. Beppu H. Tsukazaki T. Wrana J.L. Miyazono K. Sugamura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9346-9355Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), whereas both SARA and Hrs are reported to attenuate TGF-β signaling in T cells (14Kunzmann S. Wohlfahrt J.G. Itoh S. Asao H. Komada M. Akdis C.A. Blaser K. Schmidt-Weber C.B. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The FYVE domain is a motif known to bind phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and can specifically recruit the FYVE-domain-containing proteins to early endosomes where they are enriched with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (15Gillooly D.J. Simonsen A. Stenmark H. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In addition, several other adaptor proteins are also implicated in facilitating TGF-β signaling by linking the receptor complex with R-Smads, Disabled2 (16Hocevar B.A. Smine A. Xu X.X. Howe P.H.

These studies collectively suggest that the scaffolding protein-facilitated interaction between TGF-β receptors and Smad proteins is an important regulatory mechanism in TGF-β signaling and it might provide an explanation for the complicated cell context-dependent specificity of TGF-β responses. Endofin (endosome-associated FYVE-domain protein) is closely related to SARA and shares about 50% identity in the carboxyl-terminal 800-amino acid region related to SARA. It was shown that endofin is targeted to early endosomes by its FYVE domain and colocalized with SARA (21Seet L.F. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42445-42454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Overexpression of endofin induced aggregation of endosomes, suggesting that endofin is involved in endosome trafficking regulation (21Seet L.F. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42445-42454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Seet L.F. Hong W. J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 4670-4679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence that either mislocalization of endofin or knockdown of endofin expression resulted in reduction of transcription responses of TGF-β. Endofin interacts with both the TGF-β type I receptor TβRI/ALK5 and Smad4 and facilitates TGF-β signaling. Reduction of endogenous endofin expression attenuated TGF-β-induced apoptosis and impaired TGF-β-promoted association of Smad2 and Smad4. Therefore, these results suggest that endofin may act as a scaffold protein to promote the R-Smad-Smad4 heterocomplex formation by bringing Smad4 to the vicinity of the receptor complex. Cell Culture and Establishment of Stable Cell Lines—HepG2 and Hep3B cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and antibiotics in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere. HEK293T and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. At 48 h after transfection with anti-endofin siRNA expressing plasmids, stable transfectants were selected with 0.3 μg/ml of puromycin (Sigma) for 14 days. Individual clones were picked and amplified with 0.2 μg/ml of puromycin and cells were collected for analysis of endogenous endofin mRNA levels. Luciferase Reporter Assay—Cells were co-transfected with luciferase reporters and the indicated plasmids, as well as Renilla luciferase (20 ng) as an internal control. One day after transfection, cells were seeded into 24-well plates and treated with TGF-β1 (100 pm unless otherwise indicated) in minimal essential medium containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum for 20 h. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were harvested, and the luciferase activity of cell lysates was determined using a luciferase assay system (Promega) as described by the manufacturer. Total light emission during the initial 20 s of the reaction was measured in a luminometer (Berthold Lumat LB 9501). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—HEK293T cells and Hep3B cells were transfected with the indicated constructs or empty vector by using the calcium phosphate method or Lipofectamine (Roche). At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were lysed. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (24Zhang L. Gao X. Wen J. Ning Y. Chen Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8607-8612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0) for 60 min. The cells were then incubated with primary antibodies for 3 h, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for an additional 40 min. The nuclei were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). Images were obtained with the confocal Olympus fluoview 500 microscope. Reverse Transcription (RT)-Polymerase Chain Reaction—At 48 h post-transfection, total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was further treated with DNase I (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Reverse transcription was carried out in 20-μl volumes containing 1.5 μg of total RNA using the reverse transcription system (Promega). The final cDNA volume was diluted to 100 μl and used in PCR amplification for endofin or β-actin, respectively. 1.5–2 μl of cDNA were amplified in a 25-μl reaction volume, containing 0.4 mm dNTPs, 2.5 μl of 10× LA Taq buffer, 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Takara), and 0.3 pm primers. Following 94 °C incubation for 2 min, 32 cycles of amplification for endofin or 24 cycles of amplification for β-actin was performed at 94 °C for 20 s, 56 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 19 s. The endofin primers were sense 5′-AATGGTACAAATAACTCCAGAG-3′ and antisense 5′-CTTTAGAAAGTAGAACACCTCG-3′; β-actin, sense 5′-CGAGAAGATGACCCAGATC-3′ and antisense 5′-AGCTTCTCCTTAATGTCACG-3′; plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, sense 5′-GAGACAGGCAGCTCGGATTC-3′ and antisense 5′-GGCCTCCCAAAGTGCATTAC-3′; p21, sense 5′-TGTCCGTCAGAACCCATG-3′ and antisense 5′-TGGGAAGGTAGAGCTTGG-3′; Bax, sense 5′-ATGGACGGGTCCGGGGAGCAG-3′ and antisense 5′CATGATGGTTCTGATCAGTT-3′; Bim, sense 5′-GCCTTCAACCACTATCTCA-3′ and antisense 5′-ATCCAGCTCGGTGTCTTCT-3′; Bcl-XL, sense 5′-CTGCGGTACCGGCGGGCATT-3′ and antisense 5′-TCCAAGGCTCTAGGTGGTCA-3′; DAPK1, sense 5′-TCTCCTCAGCCAAGGGTGTT-3′ and antisense 5′-GGATGAAGAGTCCTCGGTGC-3′. Real Time PCR Analysis—In real time PCR, 3 μl of cDNA was amplified in a 25-μl reaction volume, containing 0.4 mm dNTPs, 2.5 μl of 10× LA Taq buffer, 1.25 μl of 20× SYBR Green I buffer (OPE, Shanghai, China), 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Takara), and 0.4 pm primers. Reaction was performed in Mx3000P™ Real-time PCR system (Stratagene). PCR was performed as for RT-PCR. Each sample was run in triplicate from two biological repeats. Data were analyzed as described previously (25Wang Z. Ren L. Zhao X. Hung T. Meng A. Wang J. Chen Y.G. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 7523-7527Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Apoptosis Analysis—Cells were treated with 200 pm TGF-β1 for 48 h in medium containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum and then collected by trypsinization. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to monitor the green fluorescence of the FITC-conjugated annexin V (530 ± 30 nm) and the red fluorescence of DNA-bound propidium iodide (630 ± 22 nm) with FACSCaliber (BD Biosciences). All data were analyzed with Cell Quest. The FYVE Domain of Endofin Is Important for Its Subcellular Localization and TGF-β Signaling—SARA was suggested to promote TGF-β signaling and mislocalization of SARA affects its ability for regulation of TGF-β signaling. As endofin is closely related to SARA, we attempted to investigate whether endofin plays a role in TGF-β signaling. To this end, we generated a FYVE-domain deletion mutant of endofin and examined its subcellular localization by immunofluorescence. As shown in Fig. 1A, wild-type endofin was distributed in the cytoplasm as punctate spots and co-localized with EEA1, an early endosome marker, and deletion of the FYVE domain (endofin-dFYVE) led to a diffuse distribution in the cytoplasm. These data are consistent with the early report that the FYVE domain is required for the early endosomal localization of endofin (21Seet L.F. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42445-42454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Then, we asked whether endofin has any effect on TGF-β signaling with Smad3-responsive reporter CAGA-luciferase (26Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Although overexpression of wild-type endofin marginally increased TGF-β-induced expression of the CAGA-luciferase reporter in human hepatoma Hep3B cells, overexpression of endofin-dFYVE effectively suppressed the transcriptional response of TGF-β (Fig. 1B). A similar result was obtained in human hepatoma HepG2 cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the FYVE domain of endofin is critical for its localization in early endosomes and the correct subcellular localization of endofin seems to be important for cellular responses to TGF-β. Knockdown of Endofin Expression Attenuates Cellular Responses to TGF-β—As overexpression of endofin has a limited effect on the TGF-β-induced expression of CAGA-luciferase in Hep3B and HepG2 cells, it implies that endogenous endofin in these cells might be sufficient for TGF-β signal transduction. To directly test this possibility, we first examined endofin mRNA expression in several cells lines by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2A, ENDOFIN was highly expressed in the cells examined, except A549, where ENDOFIN expression was moderate. To investigate the significance of endogenous endofin in mediating TGF-β signaling, we generated two small hairpin siRNA expression constructs, Sh-1 and Sh-2, to knockdown endofin expression. To examine the efficacy and specificity of these siRNAs, we transiently transfected the empty vector pSUPER, nonspecific siRNA (Sh-NS), Sh-1 or Sh-2 into HEK293T cells that express endofin and have high transfection efficiency. Total RNA was extracted 48 h after transfection and quantitative real time PCR analysis was carried out to determine endofin expression. Sh-1 and Sh-2 specifically and efficiently reduced endogenous endofin mRNA levels (Fig. 2B), whereas pSUPER and Sh-NS had no effect. To further confirm the efficiency of these siRNAs, Myc-endofin and Myc-Smad3 were transfected into HEK293T cells together with siRNA constructs. Protein expression was determined by anti-Myc immunoblotting. Both Sh-1 and Sh-2 efficiently abrogated the expression of co-transfected Myc-endofin but had not effect on Myc-Smad3 expression (Fig. 2C). Next, the effect of Sh-1 and Sh-2 on TGF-β signaling was examined with the reporter CAGA-luciferase in Hep3B cells. The TGF-β-induced expression of CAGA-luciferase was attenuated by transient expression of Sh-1 or Sh-2 (Fig. 2D). A similar result was obtained in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, knockdown of endofin expression by Sh-2 also decreased the TGF-β-induced expression of the Smad2-responsive reporter ARE-luciferase (Fig. 2F). To determine whether endofin is also required for BMP signaling, Hep3B cells were transfected with siRNA constructs and the Smad1-responsive reporter BRE-luciferase (27Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Like the nonspecific siRNA (Sh-NS), anti-endofin Sh-2 had no effect on BMP-induced expression of BRE-luciferase (Fig. 2G). Similarly, Sh-2 did not influence BRE-luciferase expression induced by the constitutively active BMP type I receptor BMPRIB(QD) (data not shown). Moreover, Sh-2 had no effect on Wnt-mediated lymphoid enhancer factor-1-luciferase expression (Fig. 2H). Therefore, Sh-1 and Sh-2 siRNA can reduce endofin expression, and reduction of endogenous endofin expression leads to decreased cellular responses to TGF-β but has no effect on BMP or Wnt signaling, suggesting that endofin specifically modulates TGF-β signaling. Endofin Mediates TGF-β Signaling in the Physiological Condition—To further confirm the regulatory role of endofin in TGF-β signaling, we established cell lines derived from Hep3B cells that stably expressed nonspecific siRNA Sh-NS (Hep3B-Sh-NS) or anti-endofin siRNA Sh-2 (Hep3B-Sh-2). The quantitative real time PCR analysis revealed a dramatic reduction of endofin expression in Hep3B-Sh-2 cells (Fig. 3A). We next performed reporter assays in Hep3B-Sh-NS and Hep3B-Sh-2 cells to examine their responses to TGF-β. Consistent with the above results, the TGF-β-induced expression of CAGA-luciferase in Hep3B-Sh-2 cells was much lower than in Hep3B-Sh-NS cells (Fig. 3B), indicating that endogenous endofin plays an important role in mediating effective TGF-β signal transduction. We next investigated whether endofin is important for the expression of TGF-β target genes by quantitative real time PCR. Both plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and p21Cip1 are well known TGF-β targets (28Keeton M.R. Curriden S.A. van Zonneveld A.J. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23048-23052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Datto M.B. Yu Y. Wang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Reduction of endofin expression apparently attenuated TGF-β-induced expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and p21Cip1 in Hep3B-Sh-2 cells (Fig. 3C), supporting the importance of endofin in TGF-β-activated transcription. To study the role of endofin in a more physiologically relevant condition, we compared TGF-β-induced apoptosis in these two cell lines. After cells were treated with 200 pm TGF-β for 48 h, the cells were harvested for apoptosis assay. As shown in Fig. 3D, TGF-β treatment resulted in about 40% cells undergoing apoptosis in Hep3B-Sh-2, significantly lower than the ones in Hep3B-Sh-NS (50%). Furthermore, about one-half of the apoptotic cells in Hep3B-Sh-2 were in the early stage of apoptosis, whereas most of the apoptotic cells in Hep3B-Sh-NS were in the late stage of apoptosis (41 versus 17% in Hep3B-Sh-2), indicating a postponed response to TGF-β in Hep3B-Sh-2 cells lacking endofin. We further examined several genes that regulate apoptosis. Pro-apoptotic Bim and anti-apoptotic Bcl-XL, all of which are the Bcl-2 family members, have been implicated to mediate TGF-β-induced apoptosis as they are up-regulated by TGF-β (30Ohgushi M. Kuroki S. Fukamachi H. O'Reilly L.A. Kuida K. Strasser A. Yonehara S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10017-10028Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 31Inman G.J. Allday M.J. J.

Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that the TGF-β-induced expression of BIM or TGF-β-suppressed expression of Bcl-XL were impaired in Hep3B-Sh-2 cells (Fig. 3E). We also found that the TGF-β-up-regulated expression of pro-apoptotic BAX was attenuated in Hep3B-Sh-2 cells. These data are in agreement that endofin mediates TGF-β-induced apoptosis. DAPK1 was also suggested to mediate TGF-β-promoted apoptosis (33Jang C.W. Chen C.H. Chen C.C. Chen J.Y. Su Y.H. Chen R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), but we found no difference of its expression between Hep3B-Sh-NS and Hep3B-Sh-2 cells (Fig. 3E). Endofin Forms Complexes with Smad4 and TβRI—To elucidate the mechanism whereby endofin modulates TGF-β signaling, we tested whether endofin associates with components of the TGF-β pathway by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Myc-endofin was co-transfected either alone or together with FLAG-Smads into HEK293T cells. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibody. Endofin was found to interact with Smad4 only (Fig. 4A, top panel). As a control, SARA specifically bound to Smad2. Similar results were obtained in a reverse immunoprecipitation-immunoblotting experiment (second panel). Furthermore, when anti-Smad4 antibody was used for immunoblotting of endofin immunoprecipitants, Smad4 was detected regardless of whether exogenous Smad4 was expressed (Fig. 4B), indicating that overexpressed endofin could also interact with endogenous Smad4. SARA interacts with Smad2 via its Smad-binding domain (SBD) in the middle of its sequence (8Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 9Wu G. Chen Y.G. Ozdamar B. Gyuricza C.A. Chong P.A. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Shi Y. Science. 2000; 287: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment revealed that endofin contains a less-conserved SBD region (data not shown). To investigate whether this putative SBD is involved in Smad4 binding, we co-expressed Myc-endofin (wild-type or dSBD lacking the putative SBD) together with FLAG-Smad constructs in HEK293T cells. As shown in Fig. 4C, Smad4 interacted with both endofin wild-type and dSBD, indicating this putative SBD region does not mediate Smad4 binding. It was reported that SARA associates with the TβRI receptor via its carboxyl terminus (8Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Because endofin shares a high similarity with SARA in their carboxyl-terminal regions, we explored whether endofin interacts with TGF-β receptors. HEK293T cells were transfected with FLAG-endofin either alone or together with HA-tagged type I receptors. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody. The results shows that endofin strongly interacted with TβRI, BMP receptors BMPRIA and BMPRIB, activin receptor ActRIB, and TGF-β receptor ALK1, but not to ALK2 (Fig. 4D). Similar results were obtained in a reverse immunoprecipitation-immunoblotting experiment (Fig. 4E). To further examine whether the carboxyl-terminal region is important for endofin to associate with receptors, the amino-terminal region (1–886) of endofin was tested for interaction with receptors. As shown in Fig. 4F, no apparent interaction was detected between endofin-(1–886) and TβRI or BMPRIB. Endofin Facilitates Smad Complex Formation—As endofin interacts with TβRI, we then asked whether it is involved in Smad2 activation. To this end, we examined whether endofin knockdown affects TGF-β-induced Smad2 phosphorylation. Hep3B-Sh-NS and Hep3B-Sh-2 cells were treated with different concentrations of TGF-β1, and cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-phosphorylated Smad2 antibody. Knockdown of endofin expression by Sh-2 significantly impaired Smad2 phosphorylation when the cells were treated with 100 or 200 pm TGF-β1 although this effect is less obvious in the presence of 300 pm TGF-β1 (Fig. 5A). Reduced Smad2 phosphorylation was also observed in Hep3B-Sh-2 cells treated with TGF-β1 for various times (data not shown). The above data that endofin can associate with both Smad4 and TβRI receptor suggests that endofin might bring Smad4 to the vicinity of the TGF-β receptor complex to facilitate R-Smad-Smad4 complex formation. To test this hypothesis, we examined the TGF-β-induced formation of endogenous Smad2-Smad4 complex in Hep3B-Sh-2 cells. Cells were harvested for anti-Smad2 immunoprecipitation and anti-Smad4 immunoblotting after a 1-h TGF-β treatment. As shown in Fig. 5B, TGF-β treatment led to the association of Smad2 with Smad4 in Hep3B-Sh-NS cells, whereas Smad complex formation was hampered in Hep3B-Sh-2 cells. These data indicate that endofin plays an important role in promoting Smad heterocomplex formation. The essential components to transduce TGF-β signaling are relatively limited and only the receptors and Smad proteins are required for the canonical TGF-β/Smad pathway. However, this pathway is known to be modulated by many other proteins. Several scaffold or adaptor proteins have been suggested to facilitate Smad activation by the receptors. In this study, we characterized the FYVE domain-containing protein endofin in regulation of TGF-β signal transduction. Our data showed that deletion of the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-binding FYVE domain in endofin caused its subcellular mislocalization from early endosomes to a diffuse distribution in the cytoplasm and reduced the TGF-β-dependent transcriptional responses. Knockdown of endogenous endofin expression by RNA interference attenuated TGF-β-induced expression of CAGA-luciferase and apoptosis. Furthermore, we showed that endofin interacted with TβRI and Smad4 and interference of endogenous endofin expression impaired Smad2 phosphorylation and Smad2-Smad4 complex formation. Our findings suggest that endofin might facilitate TGF-β signaling through recruiting Smad4 to the TGF-β receptor complex and thus assisting the association between Smad4 and the receptor-activated Smad2. Clathrin-mediated receptor endocytosis has been suggested to contribute to Smad-mediated signal transduction of TGF-β family members (34Di Guglielmo G.M. Le Roy C. Goodfellow A.F. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar, 35Penheiter S.G. Mitchell H. Garamszegi N. Edens M. Dore Jr., J.J. Leof E.B. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2006; 26: 7791-7805Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Like SARA, endofin is localized in early endosomes. Therefore, endofin may assist TGF-β signaling after ligand-activated receptors are internalized to early endosomes where endofin recruits more Smad4 to and facilitates association of receptor-activated Smad2 with Smad4. This is consistent with our finding that inhibition of endofin expression only attenuated but not completely blocked TGF-β signaling. In this sense, endofin may function as a facilitator but not an essential component for TGF-β signaling. Facilitation of the signaling Smad complex formation by endofin may be required for efficient TGF-β signaling. Interestingly, like TRAP1 and its related protein TLP (18Wurthner J.U. Frank D.B. Felici A. Green H.M. Cao Z. Schneider M.D. McNally J.G. Lechleider R.J. Roberts A.B. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4465-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), endofin specifically interacts with Smad4 but not with other Smad proteins. TLP is also localized on the plasma membrane and the punctate vesicle-like structures although it is unclear if it is on the early endososme membranes. Overexpression of TLP suppresses TGF-β-induced expression of the Smad3/4 SBE-luciferase reporter, whereas it enhances Smad2/4-mediated transcription of ARE-luciferase. Therefore, TLP was proposed to balance Smad2 signaling versus Smad3 signaling (19Felici A. Wurthner J.U. Parks W.T. Giam L.R. Reiss M. Karpova T.S. McNally J.G. Roberts A.B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4465-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Similar to TLP, endofin is not involved in BMP signaling. However, unlike TLP, endofin seems to promote both Smad2 and Smad3 signaling as knockdown of its expression impairs the Smad2-Smad4 complex formation, the expression of ARE-luciferase whose activation was mediated by Smad2/4, and the expression of CAGA-luciferase that is regarded to be activated by Smad3/4. Although endofin bound to Smad4 as well as BMP type I receptors, it did not participate in BMP signaling as inhibition of endofin expression by siRNA had no effect on the expression of BMP-responsive reporter BRE-luciferase. One possibilities is that BMP-mediated Smad1/5 activation occurs at the plasma membrane (40Hartung A. Bitton-Worms K. Rechtman M.M. Wenzel V. Boergermann J.H. Hassel S. Henis Y.I. Knaus P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7791-7805Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). SARA specifically interacts with Smad2 and Smad3 and was proposed to facilitate Smad2/3 phosphorylation by bringing the R-Smads to the signaling receptor complex (8Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 9Wu G. Chen Y.G. Ozdamar B. Gyuricza C.A. Chong P.A. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Shi Y. Science. 2000; 287: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Although endofin shares a high homology with SARA at the carboxyl terminus and both of them are localized in early endosomes, unlike SARA, endofin binds to Smad4 but not to Smad2/3. However, endofin might fulfill scaffolding functions together with SARA to promote R-Smad-Smad4 complex formation. Consistent with this, knockdown of endofin expression attenuated Smad2-Smad4 complex formation. Although endofin does not interact with Smad2/3, knockdown of its expression mitigated TGF-β-induced Smad2 phosphorylation. This could be because endofin and SARA form a heterocomplex and together they coordinate R-Smad activation. Indeed, our immunoprecipitation-immunoblotting assay revealed that endofin is able to interact with SARA (data now shown). Endofin was implicated in regulation of membrane trafficking by recruiting TOM1 and clathrin to endosomes (22Seet L.F. Hong W. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 575-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Seet L.F. Liu N. Hanson B.J. Hong W. J. Biol.

It waits to be determined whether endofin controls the activity or turnover of TGF-β receptors and other cell surface receptors. We are grateful to the RIKEN Institute for endofin (KIAA0305) cDNA."

In this study, we found that nSMase2 is palmitoylated on multiple cysteine residues via thioester bonds. Site-directed mutagenesis of cysteine residues to alanine indicated that two cysteine clusters of the enzyme are multiply palmitoylated; one cluster is located between the two hydrophobic segments, and the second one is located in the middle of the catalytic region of the protein. When overexpressed in the confluent phase of MCF-7 cells, wild-type nSMase2 was strictly localized in the plasma membranes, and the cysteine mutants of each palmitoylated cysteine cluster were seen not only at the plasma membrane but also in some punctate structures. Furthermore, mutation of all potential palmitoylation sites resulted in a dramatic reduction in the plasma membrane distribution and an increase in the punctate structures. The palmitoylation-deficient mutant was directed to lysosomes and rapidly degraded. Palmitoylation had no effect on enzyme activity but affected membrane-association properties of the protein. Finally, the catalytic region of nSMase2 where palmitoylation occurs was found to be localized at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane.

Ceramide, a bioactive sphingolipid, is involved in the regulation of diverse cellular functions, including cell growth, apoptosis, and differentiation (1Hannun Y.A. Luberto C.

Jaffrezou J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). To date, three classes of SMase, acid, neutral, and alkaline, have been identified that are clearly distinguished by catalytic pH optimum, cation dependence, primary structure, and subcellular localization (3Tani M.

Recent advances have resulted in molecular identification of at least three distinct nSMases in mammals, nSMases1, -2, and -3 (6Tomiuk S. Hofmann K. Nix M. Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5895-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The enzyme is a membrane-bound protein and has two highly hydrophobic segments near the NH2-terminal region, both of which are thought to function as transmembrane domains. In contrast to nSMase1, nSMase2 possesses in vivo SMase activity when overexpressed in mammalian cells (11Marchesini N. Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13775-13783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A number of studies using culture cell lines have focused on potential signaling roles of nSMase2. Studies in MCF-7 cells have shown that nSMase2 is up-regulated during cell growth and is required for cells to undergo confluence-induced cell cycle arrest (12Marchesini N. Osta W. Bielawski J.

Bacterial SMase, which has remote sequence similarity with eukaryotic nSMases, has provided important information on the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme with preservation of key catalytic amino acid residues between the bacterial and eukaryotic enzymes (21Tamura H.

Site-directed mutagenesis analyses of mammalian nSMase1 and the yeast nSMase, Isc1p, revealed that these key amino acid residues are essential for catalytic activity of the enzyme as well as bacterial SMases (24Rodrigues-Lima F.

In contrast to the accumulated evidence for the catalytic mechanism of nSMases from molecular aspects, there is little information about other primary features, post-translational modifications, or subcellular localization and topology of the protein. nSMase2 strictly localized at the plasma membrane in the confluence phase of MCF-7 cells and in primary hepatocytes when overexpressed (12Marchesini N.

In this study, we found that nSMase2 is palmitoylated via thioester bonds, and this post-translational modification has crucial roles for determination of subcellular localization and life span of the protein. This is the first report of posttranslational analysis of nSMase2. The significance of this modification is discussed. Materials—[choline-methyl-14C]Sphingomyelin was provided by Dr. Alicia Bielawska (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC). [9,10-3H]Palmitic acid (50 Ci/mmol) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. The scintillation mixture Safety Solve was from Research Products International. Other chemicals were from Sigma. Culture media were obtained from Invitrogen. Cell Culture and cDNA Transfection—MCF-7 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. For cDNA transfection, MCF-7 cells were plated in 6-well plates or 35-mm glass bottom microwell dishes at a density of 2.3 × 105 cells/well and cultured for 24 h. Transfections were done using Effectene® transfection reagent (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer. After transfection, cells were cultured for an additional 24 h and used for activity assays, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence analyses. To obtain tetracycline-inducible stable cell lines, MCF-7 cells were first transfected with pcDNA6/TR vector (Invitrogen) and selected in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 7 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen). The blasticidin-resistant cells were then transfected with the expression construct pcDNA4-NSM2 or pcDNA4-Cys3A5A and selected in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen), and 7 μg/ml blasticidin. The antibiotic-resistant clones were screened for expression of nSMase2 by immunofluorescence analysis using anti-Myc antibody. A representative clone, termed NSM2-Tet-On or CYS3A5A-Tet-On, was chosen and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% Tet System Approved FBS (Clontech) and 7 μg/ml blasticidin. nSMase Activity—MCF-7 cells transfected with plasmids were washed twice with PBS and lysed by syringe passage in buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Post-nuclear supernatants were prepared by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min and used for enzyme assays. One hundred μm [cholinemethyl-14C]sphingomyelin (10 cpm/pmol) was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with an appropriate amount of cell lysate in 100 μl of reaction mixture (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 50 μm phosphatidylserine). The reaction was stopped by adding 500 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and the resulting 180-μl upper phase was mixed with 4 ml of Safety Solve (Research Products International) for liquid scintillation counting. Preparation of Rabbit Polyclonal Antibody against nSMase2—The antibody was prepared by the Medical University of South Carolina antibody facility. Briefly, a synthetic oligopeptide corresponding to the 337-353 amino acids (RRRHPDEAFDHEVSAFF) of the human nSMase2 (this sequence is identical to the 335-351 amino acids of the mouse enzyme) was used for immunization. Antiserum was affinity-purified over a cyanogen bromide-activated agarose column bound with the same oligopeptide. Protein Determination, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blotting—Protein content was determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Samples for gel electrophoresis were combined with 5× SDS sample buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and separated by SDS-PAGE. For Western blotting, following separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) containing 3% dried milk. Proteins were identified by incubating with anti-V5 (0.2 μg/ml; Invitrogen) or anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1 μg/ml; Ambion) in 3% dried milk/PBS-T at 4 °C for overnight. Secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1:10,000, were incubated in 3% dried milk/PBS-T at room temperature for 1 h. Finally, proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) with exposure to CL-X Posure™ film (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation—The cells were lysed with 100 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1% SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol and were boiled for 5 min. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was mixed with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100. The mixture was incubated with 1 μg of anti-V5 antibody at 4 °C for 12 h, and then 10 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. The precipitate was spun down by centrifugation, washed with PBS five times, and then suspended in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer. After boiling for 5 min, the sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting analysis as described above. In Vivo [3H]Palmitic Acid Labeling—MCF-7 cells grown on a 6-well plate were transfected with plasmids and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Culture medium was then changed to 1.5 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, cells were labeled with 100 μCi of [3H]palmitic acid (50 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.) at 37 °C for 3 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS, and V5-tagged nSMase2 was immunoprecipitated using anti-V5 antibody and protein A/G-agarose as described above. Immunoprecipitates, suspended in SDS sample buffer containing 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, were boiled for 3 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography using the fluorographic reagent EN3HANCE™ (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 1% of respective cell lysates was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-V5 antibody as described above. Preparation of Soluble and Membrane Fractions—MCF-7 cells transfected with plasmids were washed twice with PBS, suspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)), and sonicated. After removal of cell debris by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, cell lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. Occasionally, the cell lysates were treated with an equal volume of buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% Tween 20, or 0.5% deoxycholate for 1 h on ice before centrifugation. The resulting supernatant and pellet were used as soluble and membrane fractions, respectively. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Transfected cells were cultured on cover glass and then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After being rinsed with PBS and 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS, cells were permeabilized by 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. After treatment with blocking buffer (2% FBS in PBS) for 15 min, the samples were incubated with anti-V5 (3 μg/ml; Invitrogen), anti-Myc (2.4 μg/ml; Invitrogen), anti-Giantin (1:300 dilution; Abcam), or anti-Lamp1 antibody (2 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with blocking buffer at room temperature for 2 h followed by secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. All confocal images were taken with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510 Meta; Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Each microscopic image is representative of 20 fields over at least three experiments, and all images were taken at the equatorial plane of the cell. Raw data images were cropped in Adobe Photoshop® 7.0 for publication. Plasmid Construction—Wild-type mouse nSMase2 tagged with V5 at the COOH terminus (pEF6NSM2) was constructed by PCR using a 5′ primer with an XhoI restriction site (5′-TCCGCTCGAGAATGGTTTTGTACACGAC-3′) and a 3′ primer disrupted stop codon (5′-CGCCTCCTCTTCCCCTGCAGACA-3′) and subcloned into pEF6/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). To generate a construct expressing the GFP-fused nSMase2 (NSM2GFP), pEF6NSM2 was treated with XhoI and EcoRV and subcloned into pEGFP-N2 (Clontech), which was treated with XhoI and SmaI. Tetracycline-inducible wild-type nSMase2 (pcDNA4-NSM2) or Cys3A5A mutant (pcDNA4-Cys3A5A) was constructed by PCR using a 5′ primer with a KpnI restriction site (5′-GGGGTACCATGGTTTTGTACACGACCCCCTTTCCT-3′) and a 3′ primer with an XhoI restriction site disrupted stop codon (5′-TTTCCGCTCGAGTGCCTCCTCTTCCCCTGCAGACAC-3′) and subcloned into pcDNA4/TO/myc-HisA (Invitrogen). Point mutants of nSMase2 were constructed by fusing the NH2- and COOH-terminal fragment of the enzyme. The NH2-terminal fragments were amplified by PCR using a 5′ primer containing the sequence of pEF6/V5-His TOPO vector (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′), 3′ primers (see supplemental Table 1), and pEF6NSM2 as a template. The COOH-terminal fragments were amplified by PCR using 5′ primers (see supplemental Table 1) and a 3′ primer (5′-CGCCTCCTCTTCCCCTGCAGACA-3′). These fragments were extended with Pfx50™ DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), digested with SpeI and EcoRI, and subcloned into pEF6NSM2. The sequences of all constructs were verified with an ABI377 DNA sequencer. nSMase2 Is Palmitoylated via Thioester Bonds—Several membrane proteins have lipid modifications, and palmitoylation is one of these important lipid modifications. To determine whether nSMase2 is palmitoylated, MCF-7 cells overexpressing nSMase2 with a V5 tag at the COOH terminus were labeled with [3H]palmitic acid, and the protein was immunoprecipitated using anti-V5 antibody and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and fluorography. As shown in Fig. 1A,[3H]palmitic acid was incorporated into a 76-kDa protein that co-migrated with nSMase2 on Western blotting, whereas no labeled proteins were detected in mock-transfected cells. In many cases, covalent attachment of palmitic acid into proteins occurs through a thioester bonds to Cys residues (26Smotrys J.E. Linder M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 559-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The thioester is cleaved by treatment with weak nucleophiles such as neutral hydroxylamine. Hydroxylamine treatment removed the entire incorporated label from nSMase2, demonstrating that the acyl moiety on the enzyme was attached via a thioester bond (Fig. 1B). Identification of Two Palmitoylated Cys Clusters in nSMase2—There is no well defined consensus sequence for palmitoylation other than a requirement for Cys. Palmitoylation frequently occurs at Cys residues arranged in clusters (26Smotrys J.E. Linder M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 559-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). We found three Cys clusters in the mouse nSMase2 amino acid sequence as follows: a cluster containing three Cys residues, Cys53, Cys54, and Cys59 (Cys3 cluster), which are located between the two hydrophobic segments; two Cys residues, Cys125 and Cys132 (Cys4 cluster); and four Cys residues, Cys392, Cys395, Cys396, and Cys400 (Cys5 cluster), which are located in the middle of the putative catalytic region of the protein (Fig. 2A). Many proteins are also palmitoylated at Cys residues near the NH2 terminus (26Smotrys J.E. Linder M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 559-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). In nSMase2 there are two Cys residues, Cys12 (Cys1 position) and Cys27 (Cys2 position) in the NH2-terminal region (Fig. 2A). To determine whether these Cys residues are involved in palmitoylation, we created Cys to Ala mutants of each Cys cluster as well as in combinations (Table 1, all constructs used in this study are shown in Table 1). All mutants were tagged with V5 at their COOH terminus. These mutants were transfected into MCF-7 cells, labeled with [3H]palmitic acid, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography or Western blotting using anti-V5 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2B, although all mutant proteins were expressed in the cells, the incorporation of [3H]palmitic acid into each protein was quite different. The mutation of Cys1, -2, or -4 positions to Ala (Cys1A, Cys2A, or Cys4A mutant) did not have significant effects on the incorporation of [3H]palmitate. On the contrary, 3H-palmitoylated Cys3A and Cys5A mutants (mutated Cys3 or Cys5 positions to Ala, respectively) were observed but far less than the wild-type protein. Furthermore, the Cys3A5A combination mutant almost completely lost the incorporation of 3H palmitoylation (Fig. 2B). These results clearly indicated that nSMase2 is palmitoylated in Cys residues of two Cys clusters of the protein.TABLE 1Identification of the different nSMase2 mutants used in this studyNamePosition of mutation (Cys to Ala)Fusion tag (COOH terminus)Wild typeNoneV5NSM2GFPNoneGFPCys1A10NSALS14V5Cys2A25FPAYW29V5Cys3A52PAALQLFAT60V5Cys4A124FAFATANVAL133V5Cys5A391GAHGAANFKALN402V5Cys3A5A52PAALQLFAT60391GAHGAANFKALN402V5GFP-tagged Cys3A5A52PAALQLFAT60391GAHGAANFKALN402GFPCys5A-C53A52PACLQLFCT60391GAHGAANFKALN402V5Cys5A-C54A52PCALQLFCT60391GAHGAANFKALN402V5Cys5A-C59A52PCCLQLFAT60391GAHGAANFKALN402V5Cys5A-C53A,C54A52PAALQLFCT60391GAHGAANFKALN402V5Cys5A-C54A,C59A52PCALQLFAT60391GAHGAANFKALN402V5Cys5A-C53A,C59A52PACLQLFAT60391GAHGAANFKALN402V5Cys3A-C392A52PAALQLFAT60391GAHGCCNFKCLN402V5Cys3A-C395A52PAALQLFAT60391GCHGACNFKCLN402V5Cys3A-C396A52PAALQLFAT60391GCHGCANFKCLN402V5Cys3A-C400A52PAALQLFAT60391GCHGCCNFKALN402V5Cys3A-C395A,C396A52PAALQLFAT60391GCHGAANFKCLN402V5 Open table in a new tab Effect of Palmitoylation on the Localization of nSMase2—Generally, protein palmitoylation appears to play an important role in subcellular trafficking of proteins, in modulating protein activity, and/or in protein-protein interactions (26Smotrys J.E. Linder M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 559-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). We initially examined whether palmitoylation affects the subcellular localization of the enzyme in the confluence phase of MCF-7 cells. As reported previously, wild-type nSMase2 was localized at the plasma membrane when overexpressed in the confluent culture of MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3A, panel a). Cys1A, Cys2A, and Cys4A mutants showed similar expression patterns to the wildtype protein (Fig. 3A, panels b, c, and e). However, the Cys3A and Cys5A mutants were seen not only in the plasma membrane but also in some punctate structures (Fig. 3A, panels d and f). The Cys3 and -5 double mutant (Cys3A5A) showed a very different distribution, displaying a dramatic reduction in the plasma membrane distribution and an increase in the punctate structures (Fig. 3A, panel g). To eliminate the possibility that this altered localization was somehow caused by the presence of the Ala residues, we also constructed Cys to Ser mutants of each or both Cys clusters. The Ser mutation also caused a dramatic reduction in the [3H]palmitic acid labeling of the proteins and resulted in identical localization to the Ala mutants (data not shown). To avert the possibility that extreme and transient overproduction of a membrane protein would affect its localization, we also isolated stable transfectant clones using a tetracycline-inducible expression system. As shown in Fig. 3B, tetracycline-induced wild-type protein was strictly expressed in plasma membranes, whereas the Cys3A5A protein hardly expressed in the plasma membranes. To confirm the role of palmitoylation in the subcellular localization, 2-bromopalmitate, an inhibitor of protein palmitoylation (27Webb Y. Hermida-Matsumoto L. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 261-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), was used. As shown in Fig. 3C, treatment with 2-bromopalmitate resulted in a dramatic reduction of the plasma membrane distribution of tetracycline-induced wild-type protein. Taken together, these results indicate that the lack of palmitoylation in nSMase2 greatly affects its subcellular localization. Identification of Palmitoylated Cys Residues in nSMase2—Next, we investigated which Cys residue is palmitoylated in each Cys cluster of nSMase2. To identify the specific palmitoylated amino acid in the Cys3 position, Cys to Ala mutations of Cys in the Cys3 cluster (Cys54 and Cys59, Cys53 and Cys59, or Cys53 and Cys54) were conducted using the Cys5A quadruple mutant as the receiving strain (Fig. 4A and Table 1). These mutants were overexpressed in MCF-7 cells and labeled with [3H]palmitic acid. It was found that [3H]palmitic acid incorporated into all three mutant proteins but at significantly reduced levels (Fig. 4A, compare 3rd to 5th lanes with 2nd lane). These results indicate that the three Cys residues in the Cys3 cluster are palmitoylated (Fig. 4A), and thus contribute to the overall palmitoylation. Likewise, Cys to Ala mutations in the Cys5 cluster were introduced in the background of the Cys3A triple mutant (Fig. 4B and Table 1). Point mutation of Cys395 or Cys396 in the Cys3A mutant showed that these Cys residues were still palmitoylated, whereas mutation of both Cys395 and Cys396 caused almost total loss of palmitoylation (Fig. 4B), indicating that these contiguous Cys residues serve as palmitoylation sites in the Cys5 cluster. In summary, these results suggest that each Cys cluster of nSMase2 is multiply palmitoylated and contributes to the overall palmitoylation. To investigate which Cys residue in the Cys3 and Cys5 clusters is important for the plasma membrane localization of nSMase2 in MCF-7 cells, each Cys residue in the clusters was changed individually to Ala. In this experiment, point mutation analysis was conducted in the Cys3 position using the Cys5A mutant or the Cys5 position using the Cys3A mutant (Fig. 5 and Table 1). In the point mutation analysis of the Cys3 position, there were no differences in subcellular localization between Cys5A and Cys5A-C59A (Fig. 5, panels b and e), whereas point mutation of Cys53 or Cys54 to Ala resulted in an increase in the distribution of intracellular punctate structures and a decrease in the plasma membrane localization (Fig. 5, panels c and d). The Cys53 and Cys54 double mutation resulted in a predominant punctate distribution, similar to that seen with Cys3A5A mutant (Fig. 5, panels f and m), indicating that Cys53 and Cys54, but not Cys59, in the Cys3 cluster are important for plasma membrane localization of nSMase2. For the Cys5 cluster, although point mutation of Cys392 or Cys400 of Cys3A did not exert significant effects on the plasma membrane localization (Fig. 5, panels g, h, and k), the distribution of punctate structures of the Cys3A-C395A or -C396A was increased compared with that of Cys3A"

The importance of fucosylation has recently been underlined by identification of the monogenetic inherited human disease “congenital disorder of glycosylation IIc,” also termed “leukocyte adhesion deficiency II.” Due to defective Golgi GDP-fucose transporter (SLC35C1) activity, patients show a hypofucosylation of glycoproteins and present clinically with mental and growth retardation, persistent leukocytosis, and severe infections. To investigate effects induced by the loss of fucosylated structures in different organs, we generated a mouse model for the disease by inactivating the Golgi GDP-transporter gene (Slc35c1). Lectin binding studies revealed a tremendous reduction of fucosylated glycoconjugates in tissues and isolated cells from Slc35c1-/- mice. Fucose treatment of cells from different organs led to partial normalization of the fucosylation state of glycoproteins, thereby indicating an alternative GDP-fucose transport mechanism. Slc35c1-deficient mice presented with severe growth retardation, elevated postnatal mortality rate, dilatation of lung alveoles, and hypocellular lymph nodes. In vitro and in vivo leukocyte adhesion and rolling assays revealed a severe impairment of P-, E-, and L-selectin ligand function.

The diversity of these phenotypic aspects demonstrates the broad general impact of fucosylation in the mammalian organism. The covalent attachment of oligosaccharide moieties to newly synthesized proteins comprises one of the most frequent but also complex forms of co- and posttranslational protein modifications, which has been found in nearly all living organisms (1Spiro R.G. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 43R-56RCrossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Glycan structures affect the physicochemical properties and the function of proteins in a variety of biological processes, including folding, solubility, sorting, proteolytic stability, and receptor-ligand interactions. In mammalian organisms, the biosynthesis of the oligosaccharide chains requires a broad spectrum of glycosyltransferases, glycosidases, transport proteins, and 13 different monosaccharides (2Sears P. Wong C.H. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 1998; 54: 223-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 3Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (5004) Google Scholar, 4Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). Due to its variability of binding types (α-1,2-, α-1,3-, α-1,4-, and α-1,6-fucosylation have been described), the monosaccharide fucose plays an important role in the microheterogeneity of oligosaccharide structures (5Staudacher E. Altmann F. Wilson I.B. Marz L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 216-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Fucose residues are predominantly linked to peripheral parts of N-, O-, and lipid-linked oligosaccharides, thereby building cap structures, which have been observed in many surface-localized and secreted proteins, but also modify the core of some N-linked glycans. Fucose covalently attached to serine, and threonine residues can be elongated by further glycosyltransferases of regulatory function for signaling molecules, such as Notch (6Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). The fucosylation of mammalian glycoproteins is catalyzed by at least 11 different fucosyltransferases. They show high specificity for their glycan acceptor substrates and their common donor substrate GDP-fucose (7Martinez-Duncker I. Mollicone R. Candelier J.J. Breton C. Oriol R. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 1C-5CCrossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The GDP-fucose-specific transporter SLC35C1, which is located in the Golgi membrane, translocates GDP-fucose from the cytosol into the Golgi lumen (8Puglielli L. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35596-35600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), where it serves as donor of fucose for fucosyltransferase-catalyzed reactions during the modification of glycans (Fig. 1). Recently, we and others could underline the crucial importance of SLC35C1 by identification of the monogenetic autosomal recessive inherited human disease “congenital disorder of glycosylation IIc” (CDG-IIc, 6The abbreviations used are: CDG-IIc, congenital disorder of glycosylation IIc; ES, embryonic stem; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast(s); HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; AAL, A. aurantia lectin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PP-HEV, Peyer's patch high endothelial venule(s); HEV, high endothelial venule(s); RFF, rolling flux fraction. also termed “leukocyte adhesion deficiency II,” OMIM 266265), caused by defective transporter activity of SLC35C1, thereby leading to severely impaired Golgi-localized fucosylation of glycoconjugates (9Körner C.

CDG-IIc patients suffer from mental and growth retardation, facial stigmata, and recurrent bacterial infections with persistently elevated peripheral leukocyte levels (13Marquardt T. Brune T.

Pediatr. 1999; 134: 681-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Some CDG-IIc patients were partially treatable with an oral fucose therapy (14Marquardt T. Lühn K.

Blood. 2003; 101: 1705-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Effects of hypofucosylation have been described in a variety of mouse models defective for fucosyltransferases as well as for the FX protein, an enzyme that is important for the de novo synthesis of GDP-fucose (Fig. 1). Mice deficient for the fucosyltransferases Fut1 and Fut2, respectively, which are expressed in the male and female reproductive tracts, show deficiencies for the respective fucosyl residues, but neither morphological abnormalities nor infertility has been reported (16Domino S.E. Zhang L. Gillespie P.J. Saunders T.L. Lowe J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8336-8345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Fut9 mutant mice are deficient for stage-specific embryonic antigen 1 but also develop normally (17Kudo T. Kaneko M. Iwasaki H. Togayachi A. Nishihara S. Abe K. Narimatsu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4221-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The fucosyltransferases Fut4 and Fut7 catalyze the α-1,3-linked attachment of fucose in the course of the biosynthesis of sialyl Lewis X, a structural element of E-, P-, and L-selectin ligands. On the basis of single and double deficient mice, it could be shown that Fut4 and Fut7 control the selectin-dependent process of leukocyte recruitment and lymphocyte homing in a collaborative manner (18Weninger W.

The most recently generated mouse model for a defective fucosyltransferase describes the loss of Fut8 activity. The mice exhibit a lack of α-1,6-linked core fucose and present with growth retardation, high postnatal mortality, and lung abnormalities (20Wang X. Inoue S. Gu J. Miyoshi E. Noda K. Li W. Mizuno-Horikawa Y. Nakano M. Asahi M. Takahashi M. Uozumi N. Ihara S. Lee S.H. Ikeda Y. Yamaguchi Y. Aze Y. Tomiyama Y. Fujii J. Suzuki K. Kondo A. Shapiro S.D. Lopez-Otin C. Kuwaki T. Okabe M. Honke K. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15791-15796Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In contrast to the above mentioned fucosyltransferases, which are located in the Golgi, the O-fucosyltransferases POFUT1 and POFUT2 are localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where they catalyze the attachment of O-linked fucose residues (e.g. of POFUT1 to the Notch receptor) (21Luo Y. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11289-11294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A deficiency for POFUT1 causes prenatal lethality at embryonic day 10 (22Shi S. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5234-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Finally, a knock-out of the FX protein has been reported (23Smith P.L. Myers J.T. Rogers C.E. Zhou L. Petryniak B. Becker D.J. Homeister J.W. Lowe J.B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 801-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This 3,5-epimerase/4-reductase is implicated in the conversion of GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose (Fig. 1). FX-/- mice are characterized by partial embryonic lethality, retarded development, persistent diarrhea, infertility, and leukocytosis. However, the loss of fucosylated structures and resulting symptoms can be compensated by a fucose diet, leading to GDP-fucose supply via a salvage pathway (Fig. 1). Despite the numerous insights from these different models with hypofucosylation in confined contexts, many fucose-dependent biological events remain unknown. Here we present for the first time the generation and characterization of a knock-out mouse model for Slc35c1, which mimics the pathological situation in CDG-IIc patients and should lead to a complete loss of fucosyl residues attached to glycoconjugates generated in the Golgi. Targeted Disruption of the Murine Golgi GDP-fucose Transporter in Embryonic Stem Cells—A cDNA fragment obtained by PCR, with primers designed according to a mouse expressed sequence tag clone homologous to the human nucleotide sequence, was used to screen a commercially available cosmid genomic library (strain 129/ola; Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum für Genomforschung, RZPD). An EcoRI fragment of 11.3 kb containing exons 1 and 2 was used to construct a targeting vector generating a total knock-out of the murine Golgi GDP-fucose transporter. The reading frame was interrupted inside the first exon by insertion of a neomycin resistance cassette into a SnaBI restriction site. Embryonic day 14.1 embryonic stem (ES) cells were cultured on mitomycin C-treated feeder layers of primary murine embryonal fibroblasts (MEF) derived from transgenic neomycin-resistant mice (Transgenic Research Facility, Stanford University, Stanford, CA) in knock-out Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, minimal essential medium nonessential amino acids, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1,000 units/ml recombinant leukemia inhibitory factor (ESGRO; Chemicon, München, Germany). 25 μg of linearized targeting vector was electroporated into 107 ES cells by using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser (230 V, 500 microfarads). ES cells were then diluted onto feeder layers and cultured with 180 μg (active form)/ml G418 for 10 days. DNA derived from selected G418-resistant clones was screened by Southern blot analysis and verified by PCR and sequencing analysis for correct homologous recombination. Generation of Slc35c1-/- Mice—Two different clones of targeted ES cells were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts to generate chimeras, following standard protocols (24Hogan B. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986: 188-196Google Scholar, 25Hogan B. Beddington R. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 89-204Google Scholar). Agouti colored offspring from matings of chimeric male mice with C57BL/6 female mice indicated germ line transmission. Heterozygous mice were back-crossed for at least four generations with wild type C57BL/6 mice. All reported experiments were performed with F2 progeny from 129Sv/C57BL/6 intercrosses because of a substantially higher recovery of Slc35c1-/- animals as compared with uniform C57BL/6 or 129Sv background (data not shown). Mice were kept under conventional conditions with food and water ad libitum. Experiments were conducted according to institutional ethical guidelines for animal experiments and safety guidelines for gene manipulation experiments. Genotyping of Targeted ES Cells and Mice—DNA from ES cells and tail biopsy specimens was purified by Proteinase K digestion followed by ethanol precipitation. For Southern blot analysis, genomic DNA was HincII-digested, and a probe of 693 bp homologous to an external region in the 5′-direction of the targeting vector was generated by PCR with primers GFT-F1 (5′-GCG TTG CAA GTT CAG CCG AG-3′) and GFT-R3 (5′-CCA GCT CGC AGG CCG TTG C-3′). This probe was used to identify the HincII fragments of the wild type allele of 4.25 kb and the knock-out allele of 1.85 kb, respectively. PCR analysis was done by multiplex PCR with primers GFT-F1, GFT-R2 (5′-CCG TCG ACG GTA TCG ATA AGC-3′), and GFT-R1 (5′-GTG TGT TGG TCA AGA GTG TAA CCT ATG-3′), amplifying a 2.3-kb wild type fragment and a 1.8-kb knock-out fragment, respectively. Preparation of Golgi-enriched Membrane Fractions from Liver—Golgi-enriched membrane fractions from mouse liver were prepared as described (26Leelavathi D.E. Estes L.W. Feingold D.S. Lombardi B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 211: 124-138Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Livers were homogenized twice in 3.5 ml of 0.25 m sucrose. After centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the postnuclear supernatant was collected, layered on 5 ml of 1.3 m sucrose, and centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. Golgi-enriched membranes were collected at the 0.25-1.3 m sucrose interphase, and enrichment was quantified by galactosyltransferase activity as described (27Brändli A.W. Hansson G.C. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16283-16290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Import of GDP-[14C]fucose and UDP-[3H]galactose—Transport of GDP-[14C]fucose and UDP-[3H]galactose into membrane vesicles was carried out as described (10Lübke T. Marquardt T. von Figura K. Körner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25986-25989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For each reaction, 400 μg of protein were used. Primary Cell Culture—For preparation of fibroblasts from mouse embryos, heterozygous mice were mated. Females were checked for vaginal plugs and sacrificed at 12.5 days postcoitum. Embryos were removed from the uterus and amniotic cavity under sterile conditions. After removal of heart and liver and tissue for genotyping, tissues were minced and trypsinized. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Hepatocytes were prepared by linear in situ perfusion and EDTA dissociation as described (28Meredith M.J. Cell. Biol. Toxicol. 1988; 4: 405-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were enriched using a Percoll gradient (58%, v/v), plated on collagencoated plastic culture dishes, and cultured for 48 h in Williams E medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 μm insulin, and 1 μm dexamethasone before use for experiments. Mouse mesangial cells were prepared from glomeruli by differential sieving according to a modified protocol as described (29Krakower C.A. Greenspon S.A. Am. Med. Assoc. Arch. Pathol. 1951; 51: 629-639PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, glomeruli from kidneys of two mice for each preparation were isolated by sequential sieving through sieves with 45- and 20-μm mesh diameter, respectively. Following collagenase treatment (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany), glomeruli with cell outgrowths were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing d-Val (PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany), supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Single cell suspensions of murine spleen cells were prepared by mechanical disaggregation and lysis of erythrocytes. Granulocytes were prepared as follows. Bone marrow cells were prepared from femur and tibia bones, passed through a 70-μm mesh, and layered on a Histopaque 1077/Histopaque 1119 double gradient (Sigma). Cells were pelleted according to the manufacturer's protocol and taken from the interphase between the Histopaque solutions. Cells were washed twice in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS; Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) before being used in flow cytometry or adhesion assays. Cytochemical Staining with Aleuria aurantia Lectin (AAL)—MEF were cultured for 24 h in medium without and supplemented with 10 mm fucose (Sigma). Histochemical staining was carried out as described (11Lübke T. Marquardt T. Etzioni A. Hartmann E. von Figura K. Körner C. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Histology and Lectin Histochemistry—Tissues were fixed in 0.5 m PBS, 4% formaldehyde and embedded in paraplast. Lungs were inflation-fixed at 25-cm H2O pressure. Sections were stained with hematoxylin/eosin. For lectin histochemistry, sections were treated with biotinylated lectins and counterstained with streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Flow Cytometry—Flow cytometry was performed according to standard protocols (14Marquardt T. Lühn K. Srikrishna G. Freeze H.H. Harms E. Vestweber D. Blood. 1999; 94: 3976-3985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biotinylated AAL and Maackia amurensis lectin II (Vector Laboratories) were used at 10 μg/ml and detected with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Streptavidin-phycoerythrin alone or AAL + 75 mm l-fucose (Sigma) served as negative controls. E-selectin-, P-selectin-, and VE-cadherin-Fc constructs were published before (30Hahne M. Jager U. Isenmann S. Hallmann R. Vestweber D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 31Gotsch U. Borges E. Bosse R. Boggemeyer E. Simon M. Mossmann H. Vestweber D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 583-588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, splenocytes were cultured with 10 mm l-fucose (Sigma) for 24 h before they were analyzed in flow cytometry. Cell Adhesion Assays under Static Conditions—Adhesion assays were performed in 96-well flat bottom plates (Maxisorp, Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) coated with 50 μl of E-selectin-Fc, P-selectin-Fc, or VE-cadherin-Fc (10 μg/ml) diluted in HBSS. Subsequently, plates were blocked with 10% fetal calf serum in HBSS for 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed twice with HBSS before 2 × 105 granulocytes were added in 200 μl of HBSS. The plates were kept at 4 °C for 20 min under mild rotation (80 rpm). Wells were washed three times with the same buffer, and remaining cells were fixed with HBSS containing 2% glutaraldehyde (Sigma) at 4 °C for 30 min and evaluated by computer-aided image analysis with NIH Image 1.55 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Each condition was tested in triplicates. Bound cells from four areas of each well were counted. Nonspecific binding was tested by allowing cells to bind in the presence of 5 mm EDTA. Peyer's Patch Preparation and Intravital Microscopy—The functional blocking mAb MEL-14 (rat IgG2a) against L-selectin and PS/2 (rat IgG 2b; 30 μg/mouse) against α4 integrin were purified from hybridoma supernatants (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). The P-selectin-blocking mAb RB40.34 (rat IgG1, 30 μg/mouse) was from Prof. D. Vestweber (32Bosse R. Vestweber D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 3019-3024Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The surgical preparation of Peyer's patch high endothelial venules (PP-HEV) for the observation of leukocyte rolling was performed as described previously (33Bargatze R.F. Jutila M.A. Butcher E.C. Immunity. 1995; 3: 99-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 34Wagner N. Löhler J. Kunkel E.J. Ley K. Leung E. Krissansen G. Rajewsky K. Müller W. Nature. 1996; 382: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Briefly, after opening the peritoneal cavity and locating a Peyer's patch on the small intestine, leukocytes were stained in vivo by systemic injection of 0.15 ml of 1.5 mg/ml rhodamine 6G (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Three minutes after injection, leukocyte rolling in PP-HEV was observed by intravital epifluorescence microscopy (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) using a flash illumination system (60/s; Strobex, Chadwick Helmuth, Mountain View, CA). Each venule was observed for 60 s. Venules with diameters between 14 and 34 μm were observed and recorded via a CCD camera (CF 8/1; Kappa, Gleichen, Germany) on a Panasonic S-VHS recorder. Data Analysis of Intravital Experiments and Statistics—Vessel diameter and vessel segment length of postcapillary venules or HEV were measured using an image processing system (35Klyscz T. Junger M. Jung F. Zeintl H. Biomed. Tech. (Berl.). 1997; 42: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). An empirical factor of 0.625 was used to convert centerline velocities to mean blood flow velocities (36Lipowsky H.H. Zweifach B.W. Microvasc. Res. 1978; 15: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To assess centerline blood flow velocities in HEV, 1-μm diameter fluorescent YG microspheres (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) were injected systemically, and blood flow velocity was measured by frame-to-frame displacement of the bead (three microspheres per venule). Wall shear rates (γw) were estimated as 4.9 (8vb/d), where vb is the mean blood flow velocity and d is the diameter of the vessel (37Long D.S. Smith M.L. Pries A.R. Ley K. Damiano E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10060-10065Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 38Smith M.L. Long D.S. Damiano E.R. Ley K. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 637-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Rolling leukocyte flux fraction was defined as the percentage of rolling leukocytes relative to all leukocytes passing through the same venule per time unit. Due to the preferential delivery of leukocytes to the terminal capillaries in microvascular networks (39Ley K. Pries A.R. Gaehtgens P. Pfluegers Arch. 1988; 412: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 40Ley K. Meyer J.U. Intaglietta M. Arfors K-E. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: H85-H93PubMed Google Scholar), leukocyte rolling flux is consistently higher than the product of the flow rate and the systemic leukocyte concentration. Therefore, we set the flux fraction in venules of Peyer's patch from untreated control mice at 100% and expressed flux fractions of mAb-treated controls and untreated and mAb-treated Slc35c1-/- mice relative to control. Individual leukocyte rolling velocities were measured from video recordings by analyzing 5-15 leukocytes/venule and measuring frame-to-frame displacement of rolling leukocytes. The Sigma Stat 2.0 software package (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analysis. Vessel diameters, leukocyte rolling flux fractions, leukocyte rolling velocities, and shear rates between groups and treatments were compared with one-way analysis of variance on ranks (Kruskal-Wallis) with a multiple pairwise comparison test (Dunn's test). Leukocyte counts and differentials were compared with Student's t test or by the Wilcoxon rank sum test as appropriate. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05, indicated by an asterisk. Preparation of [2-3H]Mannose-radiolabeled Glycopeptides—MEF, hepatocytes, and mesangial cells in 6-cm dishes were labeled with 125 μCi of [2-3H]mannose for 20 h in the presence or absence of fucose. Glycoproteins were extracted sequentially as described (41Körner C. Lehle L. von Figura K. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The resulting glycoprotein pellet was dissolved in TBS and subjected to digestion with 400 μg/ml Pronase (Roche Applied Science) for 10 h at 50 °C. Lens culinaris Affinity Chromatography—Radiolabeled glycopeptides were subjected to lectin affinity chromatography on a column containing agarose-bound L. culinaris lectin (Sigma) as described (42Cummings R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 66-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). After binding of the samples to the column for 1 h at 4 °C, unbound material was eluted with 20 ml of Tris-buffered saline. Elution was carried out with 100 mm methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside (Sigma), followed by collection of 20 further 1-ml fractions. Generation of Slc35c1-deficient Mice—The murine protein Slc35c1 (NCBI accession number NP_997597) shows 87% identity (as calculated by BLAST at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/) with the human ortholog SLC35C1 (NCBI accession no. AAK51705). Orthologs from other species show identities of 95% (Rattus norvegicus, accession number XP_230292), 60% (Caenorhabditis elegans, accession number AAK50396), and 52% (Drosophila melanogaster, accession number Q9VHT4) with Slc35c1. Analysis of protein topology (with TMpred, available on the World Wide Web at www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_form.html) predicts 10 transmembrane domains with both termini exposed to the cytosol (as in the human ortholog, the highly hydrophilic transmembrane domains 4 and 9 are missed by standard algorithms). The Slc35c1 gene consists of two exons and is expressed in all organs, with the strongest signal in liver (data not shown). Translation of the cDNA results in a protein with a molecular mass of 40 kDa, corresponding to results from Puglielli and Hirschberg (8Puglielli L. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35596-35600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), who have purified and characterized the rat Slc35c1 ortholog from liver. This also had a molecular mass of 39 kDa and was present as a homodimer in the medial Golgi compartment. For homologous recombination-mediated inactivation of the murine Slc35c1 locus in ES cells, a targeting vector corresponding to 11.3 kb of a genomic region, including both exons, was prepared. The open reading frame was interrupted by insertion of a neomycin resistance cassette into an early region of the first exon (Fig. 2A) downstream of the sequence region encoding the third transmembrane domain. Additionally, by this cloning strategy, a stop codon inside the cassette was generated. Two independent positive ES cell clones, identified by Southern blot analysis with an external probe and by PCR analysis followed by sequencing (data not shown), were used for microinjection into C57BL/6 blastocysts. Chimeric males crossed with wild type C57BL/6 females gave rise to heterozygous progeny (Slc35c1+/-). Genotype analysis was performed by PCR with two alternative reverse primers (Fig. 2B). Mice with homozygosity for the mutated allele (Slc35c1-/-) used in these experiments were generated by heterozygous intercrossing (after ascertainment of the same phenotype concerning physical and biochemical aspects, progeny from one of the two injected ES cell clones was used for the reported experiments). In RNA extracts from several tissues of Slc35c1-/- animals, no transcript was detectable (data not shown). Loss of GDP-fucose Import Activity and Fucosylated Glycans—Import activity of nucleotide sugars into the Golgi apparatus was assayed in Golgi enriched vesicles prepared from liver homogenates.

https://openalex.org/W2156607612,"GAT is an N-acetyltransferase from Bacillus licheniformis that was optimized by gene shuffling for acetylation of the broad spectrum herbicide, glyphosate, forming the basis of a novel mechanism of glyphosate tolerance in transgenic plants (Castle, L. A., Siehl, D. L., Gorton, R., Patten, P. A., Chen, Y. H., Bertain, S., Cho, H. J., Duck, N., Wong, J., Liu, D., and Lassner, M. W. (2004) Science 304, 1151-1154). The 1.6-Å resolution crystal structure of an optimized GAT variant in ternary complex with acetyl coenzyme A and a competitive inhibitor, 3-phosphoglyerate, defines GAT as a member of the GCN5-related family of N-acetyltransferases. Four active site residues (Arg-21, Arg-73, Arg-111, and His-138) contribute to a positively charged substrate-binding site that is conserved throughout the GAT subfamily. Structural and kinetic data suggest that His-138 functions as a catalytic base via substrate-assisted deprotonation of the glyphosate secondary amine, whereas another active site residue, Tyr-118, functions as a general acid. Although the physiological substrate is unknown, native GAT acetylates d-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid with a kcat/Km of 1500 min-1 mm-1. Kinetic data show preferential binding of short analogs to native GAT and progressively better binding of longer analogs to optimized variants. Despite a 200-fold increase in kcat and a 5.4-fold decrease in Km for glyphosate, only 4 of the 21 substitutions present in R7 GAT lie in the active site. Single-site revertants constructed at these positions suggest that glyphosate binding is optimized through substitutions that increase the size of the substrate-binding site. The large improvement in kcat is likely because of the cooperative effects of additional substitutions located distal to the active site.

Glyphosate (N-phosphonomethylglycine) is a widely used herbicide that acts nonselectively through inhibition of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) 4The abbreviations used are: EPSP, 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate; GAT, glyphosate N-acetyltransferase; GNAT, GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase; AcCoA, acetyl coenzyme A; CoA, coenzyme A; GPJ, glyphosate; 3PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; NAG, N-acetylglyphosate; 3PG, 3-phosphoglyceric acid; AP3, 2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid; AP4, 2 amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid; AP5, 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; AMPA, aminomethylphosphonate; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; PDB, Protein Data Bank. 4The abbreviations used are: EPSP, 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate; GAT, glyphosate N-acetyltransferase; GNAT, GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase; AcCoA, acetyl coenzyme A; CoA, coenzyme A; GPJ, glyphosate; 3PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; NAG, N-acetylglyphosate; 3PG, 3-phosphoglyceric acid; AP3, 2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid; AP4, 2 amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid; AP5, 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; AMPA, aminomethylphosphonate; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; PDB, Protein Data Bank. synthase in the aromatic biosynthesis pathway (2Padgette S.R.

Its efficacy against all plant species, low cost, low mammalian toxicity, and benign environmental impact favor its use in crops that have a transgenic tolerance mechanism (3Franz J.E. Mao M.K. Sikorski J.A. Glyphosate: A Unique Global Herbicide. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1997Google Scholar). The predominant transgene currently in use encodes a bacterial EPSP synthase that is nearly insensitive to inhibition by glyphosate (2Padgette S.R. Re D.B. Barry G.F. Eichholtz D.E. Delanny X.

We reported an alternative strategy for glyphosate resistance involving enzymatic conversion of glyphosate to N-acetylglyphosate (NAG) (1Castle L.A. Siehl D.L. Gorton R. Patten P.A. Chen Y.H. Bertain S. Cho H.J. Duck N. Wong J. Liu D. Lassner M.W. Science. 2004; 304: 1151-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Because the acetylated form of glyphosate has low affinity for the active site of EPSP synthase, it is nonherbicidal. Three variants of an enzyme that catalyzes N-acetylation of the secondary amine of glyphosate were discovered from Bacillus licheniformis. These GAT 5Optimum™ GAT™ is the trademark name that Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc., uses to identify its glyphosate ALS tolerance trait. 5Optimum™ GAT™ is the trademark name that Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc., uses to identify its glyphosate ALS tolerance trait. enzymes are 17 kDa in size, are most active at pH 6.8, and have a Km for acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) of 1-2 μm. The native enzymes are very poor catalysts for acetylation of glyphosate, with a kcat of 5.3 min-1 and Km,GPJ of 1.3 mm (for ST401 GAT, referred to hereafter as native GAT). 6The GenBank™ accession numbers for the sequences contained herein are as follows: B. licheniformis ST401 GAT, AX543338; R7 GAT, AY597417; R11 GAT, AY597418; B. subtilis YITI, CAA70664; Bacillus cereus GNAT, NP_830505; Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus GNAT, NP_967337; Chloroflexus aurantiacus GNAT, ZP_00018467; Exiguobacterium sibiricum GNAT, ZP_00538687; Listeria inocua GNAT, CAC98097. 6The GenBank™ accession numbers for the sequences contained herein are as follows: B. licheniformis ST401 GAT, AX543338; R7 GAT, AY597417; R11 GAT, AY597418; B. subtilis YITI, CAA70664; Bacillus cereus GNAT, NP_830505; Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus GNAT, NP_967337; Chloroflexus aurantiacus GNAT, ZP_00018467; Exiguobacterium sibiricum GNAT, ZP_00538687; Listeria inocua GNAT, CAC98097. The B. licheniformis enzymes belong to a diverse family of largely uncharacterized bacterial N-acetyltransferases sharing between 30 and 64% amino acid identity to native GAT (Fig. 1). Despite extensive screening of biological amines, including amino acids, nucleotides and antibiotics, the physiological substrates for the native enzymes are unknown (4Siehl D.L. Castle L.A. Gorton R. Chen Y.H. Bertain S. Cho H.J. Keenan R. Liu D. Lassner M.W. Pest Manag. Sci. 2005; 61: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).To develop gat as a transgene for glyphosate resistance in crops, we subjected the three B. licheniformis enzymes to 11 rounds of gene shuffling and obtained optimized variants with up to a 4,500-fold increase in catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) relative to the native enzyme. This was achieved through a combination of improvements in kcat (190-fold) and Km,GPJ (24-fold). When introduced into plants, optimized gat genes confer robust tolerance to glyphosate (1Castle L.A. Siehl D.L. Gorton R. Patten P.A. Chen Y.H. Bertain S. Cho H.J. Duck N. Wong J. Liu D. Lassner M.W. Science. 2004; 304: 1151-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar).To gain insight into the molecular mechanism of glyphosate N-acetylation by GAT, we determined the structure of a 7th round GAT variant (termed R7 GAT) in ternary complex with AcCoA and the competitive inhibitor 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) and in binary complex with oxidized CoA. We also carried out a detailed kinetic analysis of the activity of native, optimized, and site-directed mutants of GAT against a panel of substrate analogs. Together, these data allow us to propose a detailed mechanism for glyphosate N-acetylation by GAT. Furthermore, comparison of the native and optimized enzymes provides insight into the structural basis of the activity enhancements achieved through gene shuffling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneral—Glyphosate, acetyl coenzyme A, coenzyme A, aminomethylphosphonate, glycine, N-methylglycine, 3-phosphoglycerate, phosphoenolpyruvate, dl-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid, and dl-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid were obtained from Sigma. d- and l-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acids were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis. N-Acetylglyphosate was synthesized by Gateway Chemical Technology, St. Louis. N-Methylaminomethylphosphonate was purchased from AKos Consulting, Basel, Switzerland. Phosphonoacetate was purchased from ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH. 4-Phosphonobutyrate was purchased from Lancaster Synthesis, Inc., Pelham, NH. Phosphonopyruvate was synthesized by Chemical Synthesis Services, Craigavon, UK.Mutagenesis, Protein Expression, and Purification—Native and variant GAT enzymes were prepared as described (1Castle L.A. Siehl D.L. Gorton R. Patten P.A. Chen Y.H. Bertain S. Cho H.J. Duck N. Wong J. Liu D. Lassner M.W. Science. 2004; 304: 1151-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Briefly, gat genes were expressed in Escherichia coli from a pQE80 vector (Qiagen), modified to remove the His6 tag. GAT was purified from cell lysates by affinity chromatography on coenzyme A-agarose (Sigma) and gel filtration chromatography on Superose 75 (Amersham Biosciences).Site-directed mutagenesis of the R7 gat gene in pQE80 was performed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Oligonucleotide pairs containing the substituted nucleotides were purchased from Operon Biotechnologies, Inc. All resulting plasmids were sequenced to verify that only the intended mutation was present in the coding region. Double mutants were obtained by successive application of the site-directed mutagenesis protocol.Protein concentrations were calculated from measurements of absorbance at 205 nm (Emg/ml = 30.5) after buffer exchange (NAP-5 column, Amersham Biosciences) into 50 mm Na2SO4. The extinction coefficient was determined by the procedure of Scopes (5Scopes R.K. Protein Purification: Principles and Practice.3rd Ed. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York1994: 46-47Google Scholar), in which extinction, cm-1 (mg/ml)-1 = 27 + 120 (A280/A205).Kinetic Analysis—Apparent Km values for glyphosate and the compounds in Table 3 were determined as described previously (4Siehl D.L. Castle L.A. Gorton R. Chen Y.H. Bertain S. Cho H.J. Keenan R. Liu D. Lassner M.W. Pest Manag. Sci. 2005; 61: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) in a continuous spectrophotometric assay in which cleavage of the thioester bond of AcCoA is monitored at 235 nm in a Spectramax Plus384 plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Reaction mixtures contained 25 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 10% ethylene glycol, varied concentrations of acceptor substrate and saturating AcCoA (167 μm). The Spectramax software was programmed to convert change in absorbance to reaction velocity, μm/min, and to return parameters of the Lineweaver-Burk transformation of the Michaelis-Menten equation. The kcat value was calculated from Vmax and the concentration of GAT. The apparent Km value for AcCoA was determined from initial rate measurements at saturating glyphosate, using mass spectrometric detection of NAG, as described (4Siehl D.L. Castle L.A. Gorton R. Chen Y.H. Bertain S. Cho H.J. Keenan R. Liu D. Lassner M.W. Pest Manag. Sci. 2005; 61: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and the Lineweaver-Burk method.TABLE 3Substrate specificity of native, R7 and R11 GAT, performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” Open table in a new tab The pH versus kcat profiles were fit to the equation, kcat, app = kcat/(1 + 10(pK1-pH) + 10(pH-pK2)), where pK1 is the dissociation constant for the ionizable group that promotes the reaction in its deprotonated form, and pK2 is the dissociation constant of the ionizable group that promotes the reaction in its protonated form.For R7 and R11 GAT, Ki values for the competitive inhibitors NAG, CoA, 3PG, and phosphoenolpyruvate were determined from slope re-plots of double-reciprocal plots in which AcCoA was fixed at 167 μm; the glyphosate was varied, and inhibitor was supplied at a selection of fixed concentrations. For native GAT, the Ki value for CoA was also determined as above. For all other enzyme and inhibitor combinations, Ki values were determined from a single concentration of inhibitor using the equation Km,app = Km + Km/Ki [I]. Inhibitor concentrations were as follows: 2 mm NAG, 50 μm 3PG, 10 μm phosphoenolpyruvate, 15 μm phosphonopyruvate with native GAT; 20 μm phosphonopyruvate with R7 and R11 GAT; and 5 μm phosphonoacetate and 2 mm phosphonobutyrate with all enzymes.Crystallization and Data Collection—Purified R7 GAT was buffer-exchanged and concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. For crystallization the protein was incubated in the presence of 2 mm AcCoA alone or with 2 mm AcCoA and 20 mm 3PG. Crystals were obtained overnight by hanging drop vapor diffusion against a crystallization solution containing 100 mm NaOAc, pH 4.6, 150-300 mm ammonium sulfate, and 20-25% PEG4000. The crystals were mounted in nylon loops, after first transferring them to cryoprotectant comprising 100 mm NaOAc, pH 4.6, 25% PEG4000, and 20% glycerol supplemented with 2 mm AcCoA and 250 mm ammonium sulfate (binary complex) or 2 mm AcCoA, 50 mm 3PG, and 50 mm ammonium sulfate (ternary complex). Data were measured at 100 K at beamline 5.0.2 of the Advanced Light Source (ALS, Berkeley, CA) using an ADSC Q210 CCD detector. Although the crystals diffract to high resolution, as evidenced by the low Rsym and high 〈I/σI 〉 values in the highest resolution shell, the detector geometry limited the data collection to 1.6 Å. All data were processed using MOSFLM (6Leslie, A. G. W.

A. 2005; 102: 8887-8892Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) as the starting model, after removing ligands and water molecules, and applying a random positional displacement to all atoms. Inspection of initial Fo - Fc difference maps revealed clear electron density for cofactor and 3PG in the ternary complex and cofactor and an active site sulfate ion in the binary complex. The electron density for the acetyl group of AcCoA in the ternary complex is weak, suggesting rotational disorder. The acetyl group was modeled (and subsequently refined) into the density in the chemically reasonable orientation in which its carbonyl oxygen points toward the backbone amides of Gly-74 and Met-75. There is also evidence for a minor (∼30% occupancy) active site configuration in which 3PG is replaced by a sulfate ion and an additional water molecule. We did not observe convincing electron density for the acetyl group of AcCoA in the binary complex structure. Based on careful inspection of Fo - Fc difference maps, we modeled the cofactor as oxidized CoA, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the bound species is AcCoA with a rotationally disordered acetyl group. No evidence for transfer of the acetyl group to the thiol of Cys-108 was observed, either kinetically or in the electron density maps of either structure. Refinement was carried out in REFMAC5 (9Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13776) Google Scholar), and COOT (10Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22799) Google Scholar) was used for model building. The use of anisotropic B-factors in the final stage of refinement was supported by a >1% drop in Rfree and Rcryst for both data sets. All amino acids except for the N-terminal methionine, which is disordered, are included in the final models. PyMOL was used to generate all structure figures (11DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the PDB with accession numbers 2JDC (binary complex) and 2JDD (ternary complex).RESULTSStructural Overview of GATGeneral Fold—We determined the 1.6-Å crystal structure of an optimized GAT (R7) in ternary complex with AcCoA and a competitive inhibitor, 3PG, and in binary complex with oxidized CoA (Table 1). Attempts to obtain a ternary complex with glyphosate were unsuccessful, presumably because of the low affinity of glyphosate for R7 GAT in the presence of ammonium sulfate, which was required for crystallization. GAT is a compact enzyme (Fig. 2A) with approximate dimensions of 43 × 40 × 38 Å. The crystal packing suggests that GAT functions as a monomer, in agreement with gel filtration results. Despite low primary sequence homology, the overall fold identifies GAT as a member of the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily (12Neuwald A.F. Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). GAT shows the closest structural similarity to YJCF (PDB code 1Q2Y; 19% sequence identity; 1.9 Å r.m.s.d.), a distantly related protein of unknown function from Bacillus subtilis, and more modest similarity to the well characterized aminoglycoside 6′-N-acetyltransferase Aac(6′)-Ii, (PDB code 1B87; 16% sequence identity; 2.7 Å r.m.s.d.)

Substitutions located within 5 Å of either ligand are shown in blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cofactor-binding Site—The interactions between cofactor and GAT are similar to those observed throughout the GNAT superfamily (15Dyda F. Klein D.C. Hickman A.B. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 81-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 16Vetting M.W. de Carvalho L.P.S. Yu M. Hegde S.S. Magnet S. Roderick S.L. Blanchard J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 212-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The adenosine group of AcCoA, which makes few direct interactions with the protein, is largely solvent-exposed, whereas the pyrophosphate and pantetheine moieties form a series of direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds to the enzyme.3PG-binding Site—The competitive inhibitor, 3PG, binds in a solvent-exposed cleft adjacent to the cofactor and the V-shaped wedge formed by β4 and β5. The binding site is flanked on one side by the region extending from the C-terminal portion of α1 into α2b and on the other side by the β6-β7 loop (Fig. 2A). These flanking regions are among the least conserved structural features within the GNAT superfamily, a reflection of the fact that these enzymes bind to a diverse set of substrates. The binding site is positively charged and surrounded by an otherwise electronegative surface (Fig. 2B). A total of 8 amino acids, 1 water molecule, and the acetyl group of AcCoA interact directly (<4 Å) with the inhibitor (Fig. 2C). The hydrophobic side chains of Leu-20, Phe-31, and Val-135 all contact 3PG, as does the main chain nitrogen of Gly-74, which forms a hydrogen bond with the carboxylate of 3PG. The majority of contacts, however, are made between charged groups, including side chain interactions with the phosphate end (Arg-21, Arg-111, and His-138) and with the carboxylate end (Arg-21 and Arg-73) of 3PG. Of particular note is a short, 2.46-Å hydrogen bond between the N-ϵ of His-138 and a phosphate oxygen of 3PG.In contrast with the conformation observed in the binary complex, which contains a sulfate ion bound in the substratebinding site, residues in the β6-β7 loop are displaced by up to 1.5 Å away from the active site in the ternary complex. This loop possesses the highest average B-factors in the ternary complex structure. In addition, side chains of residues lining the opposite face of the binding site, including Arg-21 and Arg-73, are displaced by up to 1.3 Å away from the active site to accommodate 3PG binding.Certain features of the GAT structure appear to link the substrate- and cofactor-binding sites. Three well ordered water molecules are buried at the interface where α1, α2a, and α2b pack against the central β-sheet (Fig. 2A). The most deeply buried of these waters makes a series of hydrogen bonds to residues from three distinct regions of the enzyme: Arg-16, located at the C-terminal end of α1; Ser-55, located in the center of β3; and the backbone carbonyl of Gly-74, located in the β-bulge region of β4. Ser-55 is conserved in the GAT-like family of N-acetyltransferases, as is Arg-16, which forms a buried salt bridge with another conserved residue Asp-34 (on α2b). The proximity of these residues to the cofactor-(Gly-74) and substrate-binding sites (Leu-20, Arg-21, Phe-31, Arg-73, and Gly-74) suggests that the network of hydrogen bonds formed between β3, β4, α2a, and α2b is required for optimal binding of both ligands. Indeed, substitution of Asp34 with alanine in an 8th round GAT variant decreased Km values for both AcCoA and glyphosate by 44- and 13-fold, respectively (data not shown).Cofactor and Substrate Specificity for Native GAT and Optimized VariantsThe steady-state kinetic parameters of native and optimized GAT enzymes used in this study are summarized in Table 2.TABLE 2Steady-state kinetic data for native, R7, and R11 GAT enzymes, obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures”EnzymekcatKm,GPJKi,NAGKm,AcCoAKi,CoAkcat/Km,GPJRelative activitymin−1mmmmμmμmmm−1 min−1Native5.3 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.113 ± 14.081.0R71040 ± 400.24 ± 0.010.35 ± 0.031.5 ± 0.19 ± 143301060R111010 ± 400.055 ± 0.0040.06 ± 0.01~1-215 ± 3184004510 Open table in a new tab Cofactor Specificity—To characterize cofactor specificity, we compared the ability of GAT to utilize different acyl-CoAs for glyphosate N-acetylation. As reported previously, no activity was observed when 1 mm of the malonyl, crotonyl, succinyl, or 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl derivatives of coenzyme A were incubated with 5 mm glyphosate and either native or R7 GAT (4Siehl D.L. Castle L.A. Gorton R. Chen Y.H. Bertain S. Cho H.J. Keenan R. Liu D. Lassner M.W. Pest Manag. Sci. 2005; 61: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In contrast, activity was detected with propionyl-CoA and R7, and the following kinetic constants were determined: kcat = 350 min-1, Km,PrCoA = 100 μm, kcat/Km = 3.5 min-1 μm-1. The corresponding values for AcCoA are 1040 min-1, 1.5 μm, and 690 min-1 μm-1. Thus, kcat/Km values with propionyl-CoA is only 0.5% that with AcCoA. This strict specificity is consistent with a lack of space in the active site for CoA derivatives with acyl groups appreciably larger than acetyl.Acceptor Substrate Specificity—To define the range of sizes and functional groups that are preferred in substrates utilized by native, R7, and R11 GAT, we tested a series of compounds related to glyphosate (Table 3). Aminomethylphosphonate (AMPA), a glyphosate analog lacking a carboxyl group, was acetylated with nearly the same kcat value as glyphosate by the native, R7, and R11 enzymes, but its Km values are much higher than those of glyphosate. Relative to glyphosate, the Km value for AMPA is 3.6-fold greater with native GAT, 17-fold greater with R7, and 133-fold greater with R11. Interestingly, N-methyl-AMPA had Km values similar to those of AMPA, but kcat values were 27- to 50-fold lower, suggesting steric hindrance from the methyl group. Glycine and N-methylglycine (sarcosine) were tested to probe the effect of removing the phosphonate group from glyphosate. Even when supplied at 100 mm, essentially no activity was observed with any of the three GAT variants. The contrasting effects obtained from removal of the phosphonate group compared with removal of the carboxyl group show that the former provides more binding energy for catalysis with glyphosate.The only compound we tested that was acetylated appreciably by native GAT was d-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionate (d-AP3), exhibiting a kcat/Km of 1500 min-1 mm-1. Activity with d-AP3 was less with R7 and R11 (Table 3). Activity with the l-isomer was very poor with the native enzyme and almost undetectable with the optimized variants. The DL form of the next longer compound, dl-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (dl-AP4), showed only slight activity at 100 mm with all enzymes, and the longest, dl-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (dl-AP5), was devoid of reactivity (see below).We also tested a series of compounds for their ability to inhibit glyphosate N-acetylation (Table 3). NAG inhibited each enzyme competitively with glyphosate. Ki values decreased in parallel with Km,GPJ and were 1.3 mm (native), 0.35 mm (R7), and 0.06 mm (R11). Despite being a poor substrate, l-AP3, was a potent inhibitor of both R7 and R11, with Ki values of 5 and 10 μm, respectively (Table 3). The next longer compound, dl-AP4, was a poor inhibitor of native GAT but bound 53-fold more tightly to R11 than to native GAT. The longest compound, dl-AP5, did not inhibit native GAT and only weakly inhibited R7 and R11. A similar trend was observed with the competitive inhibitors 3PG and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). The shorter of the two compounds, PEP, showed lower Ki values than 3PG for native, R7, and R11, but the fold difference decreased throughout the optimization as follows: 12-fold tighter with the native enzyme, 5.3-fold with R7, and only 2.4-fold with R11. Similar results were obtained with the PEP analog, phosphonopyruvate. The shortest compound tested, 2-phosph"
https://openalex.org/W2064782906,"Alternate transcripts of the human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG1) encode two subunits, hERG 1a and 1b, which form potassium channels regulating cardiac repolarization, neuronal firing frequency, and neoplastic cell growth. The 1a and 1b subunits are identical except for their unique, cytoplasmic N termini, and they readily co-assemble in heterologous and native systems. We tested the hypothesis that interactions of nascent N termini promote heteromeric assembly of 1a and 1b subunits. We found that 1a and 1b N-terminal fragments bind in a direct and dose-dependent manner. hERG1 hetero-oligomerization occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum where co-expression of N-terminal fragments with hERG1 subunits disrupted oligomerization and core glycosylation. The disruption of core glycosylation, a cotranslational event, allows us to pinpoint these N-terminal interactions to the earliest steps in biogenesis. Thus, N-terminal interactions mediate hERG 1a/1b assembly, a process whose perturbation may represent a new mechanism for disease. Alternate transcripts of the human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG1) encode two subunits, hERG 1a and 1b, which form potassium channels regulating cardiac repolarization, neuronal firing frequency, and neoplastic cell growth. The 1a and 1b subunits are identical except for their unique, cytoplasmic N termini, and they readily co-assemble in heterologous and native systems. We tested the hypothesis that interactions of nascent N termini promote heteromeric assembly of 1a and 1b subunits. We found that 1a and 1b N-terminal fragments bind in a direct and dose-dependent manner. hERG1 hetero-oligomerization occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum where co-expression of N-terminal fragments with hERG1 subunits disrupted oligomerization and core glycosylation. The disruption of core glycosylation, a cotranslational event, allows us to pinpoint these N-terminal interactions to the earliest steps in biogenesis. Thus, N-terminal interactions mediate hERG 1a/1b assembly, a process whose perturbation may represent a new mechanism for disease.

In theory, maturation defects could result from misfolding, failed oligomeric assembly, or trafficking defects during translocation of channel complexes to the plasma membrane (16Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat Rev Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar, 17Robertson G.A. January C.T. Handb. Exp.

Drugs can rescue a subset of mutants, as if by stabilizing the internal vestibule of the pore and thus compensating for folding or oligomerization defects (18Rajamani S. Anderson C.L. Anson B.D. January C.T. Circulation. 2002; 105: 2830-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We are only beginning to understand how ion channels assemble (19Deutsch C. Neuron. 2003; 40: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Studies of certain voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels and neurotransmitter receptors indicate that assembly of related subunits is specified by N-terminal interactions (20Shahla V. Zach W.H. Cell. 1992; 68: 23-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 21Deal K.K. Lovinger D.M. Tamkun M.M. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1666-1676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Li M. Jan Y.

In homomeric Kv1.3 channels, N termini interact as they emerge from the translocon, well before subunit synthesis is complete (23Lu J. Robinson J.M. Edwards D. Deutsch C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10934-10946Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In contrast to Kv or ligand-gated channels, where homologous N termini mediate association, hERG subunits present an unusual challenge: they exist as two isoforms that are identical except for structurally divergent N termini. The hERG 1a N terminus comprises ∼396 residues, whereas the 1b N terminus is a mere 56 residues, the first 36 of which are unique (Fig. 1A). The two subunits assemble in native tissues and in heterologous systems (24Jones E.M. Roti Roti E.C. Wang J. Delfosse S.A. Robertson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44690-44694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) where, in the absence of hERG 1a, 1b subunits fail to form robust homomeric currents (25London B. Trudeau M.C. Newton K.P. Beyer A.K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Satler C.A. Robertson G.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 870-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 26Lees-Miller J.P. Kondo C. Wang L. Duff H.J. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). If the N termini are involved in assembly for hERG channels as for other potassium channels, the underlying mechanisms may differ substantially from those regulating association of homologous domains. Understanding these mechanisms is an important first step to uncovering new determinants of LQTS that occur because of defects in biogenesis. In this study we tested the hypothesis that cotranslational interactions between the 1a and 1b N termini promote heteromeric subunit association. We show that hERG 1a and 1b N termini interact in cellular and in vitro assays. We utilized a truncated 1b subunit, which is retained in the ER, as a reporter of early biogenic events. Homo-oligomers of this subunit are core-glycosylated, but glycosylation can be disrupted by the introduction of heteromerizing 1a N-terminal fragments. Thus, heteromeric interactions occur before the addition of the glycan group in the ER. Such non-homotypic interactions between structurally dissimilar N termini occur cotranslationally and likely function to facilitate the heteromerization of hERG1 channel subunits. Plasmids—For mammalian expression, hERG 1a (aa 1–1159) and 1b (aa 1–819) cDNA were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). C-terminal-truncated clones, lacking 461 aa of the distal region, 1aΔCT (aa 1–698) and 1bΔCT (aa 1–358), were subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His vector (Invitrogen). hERG1 N-terminal fragments with the first two transmembrane (TM) domains were subcloned using PCR with a 3′ oligo that introduced a FLAG tag sequence at the end of the second TM (aa 476 for 1a and 136 for 1b). Amplified fragments were cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector and sequenced. For bacterial expression, 1a N terminus (1aNT, aa 1–367) was cloned into pET28a(+) vector (Novagen) resulting in an N-terminal His tag. The 1b N terminus (1bNT, aa 1–67) was cloned into pGex4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) and bears a GST tag on the N-terminal end. Both pGex4T-1 and pET28a clones were transformed into Rosetta(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen). Antibodies—The generation of pan-ERG1 rabbit antibody against the C terminus of hERG1, and 1a and 1b isoform-specific rabbit antibodies has been described previously (24Jones E.M. Roti Roti E.C. Wang J. Delfosse S.A. Robertson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44690-44694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, the antibodies were used at 1:5000, 1:150, and 1:1000 dilutions, respectively. Mouse anti-c-Myc (Clontech) was used at a dilution of 1:250. Goat anti-1a (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1:200 dilution. Mouse pan-hERG1 antisera were produced in collaboration with Neoclone (Madison, WI) and used at 1:500. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C. A cell line stably expressing 1bΔCT protein was generated by transfecting HEK-293 cells with Myc-tagged 1bΔCT DNA and growing in medium containing 1 mg/ml neomycin for selection. Separate cell colonies were selected, and lysate from them was probed with 1b-specific antibody to confirm expression. Cell lines expressing 1bΔCT were then maintained in 500 μg/ml neomycin. Protein Expression and Purification from HEK-293 Cells— Cells were transfected with appropriate quantity of DNA at 70–80% confluency using TransIT-LT1 kit (Mirus). Membrane preparations were made, 48 h post-transfection, by solubilizing cells in 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaEDTA, 10 mm NaEGTA, 5 mm glucose, and 0.5–1% (v/v) Triton X-100 followed by sonication and incubation for 15 min. Lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant quantified using the Bradford assay (DC Protein Assay, Bio-Rad). All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Co-immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates were precleared with 25 μl of 25% protein A/G bead slurry (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C. Precleared lysate was incubated with respective antibody for 3 h. Lysates were further incubated with 50 μl of 25% protein A/G slurry for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein complexes were collected by centrifugation at 2,000 × g. Beads were washed three times in 0.1% Triton X-100 containing solubilization buffer. Immune complexes were eluted in 5× LSB (225 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 50% glycerol, 200 mm dithiothreitol) at 65 °C for 5 min. Eluted protein complexes, alongside their input lysate, were size-separated by SDS-PAGE and Western-blotted using standard methods. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to isolate complexes of the 1aNTtm fragment with the truncated 1bΔCT construct in stably expressing 1bΔCT cells to observe the effects of association on 1bΔCT core glycosylation. In contrast, in transient co-transfections the effects could be seen in the lysate without co-immunoprecipitation. We inferred that the inability to observe an effect in stable cell lysates without co-immunoprecipitation is because of the reduced efficiency of co-expression of the two constructs compared with transient transfections in which both constructs are simultaneously introduced and coordinately translated. Protein Expression and Purification in Escherichia coli—Recombinant proteins were purified as per manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences and Novagen). Purified 1aNT-His6 protein was eluted from Ni2+ beads (Qiagen) with 250 mm imidazole and desalted and exchanged in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl by Amicon 10K column (Millipore). Purified proteins were size-separated by SDS-PAGE, stained by Coomassie Blue, and quantified by comparison with bovine serum albumin protein standards. GST Pull-down Assays—Binding assays were carried out by incubating the indicated amounts of soluble 1aNT-His6 with 2 μm immobilized recombinant fusion proteins, 1bNT or GST. Reactions were incubated with agitation for 2 h at 4 °C in a total volume of 150 μl of TBS buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (binding buffer). Bound proteins were washed three times with 1 ml of binding buffer, and eluted by boiling in LSB. The entire binding reaction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Endoglycosidase Analysis—Deglycosylation was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. 8 μg of denatured lysate was treated with either endoglycosidase H (Roche Applied Science) or PNGase F (New England Biolabs) overnight at 37 °C. In control reactions, the enzymes were replaced with buffer. Pulse Chase—HEK-293 cells were grown to 70% confluency and transfected with 10 μg of 1bΔCT DNA with either 10 μg of 1aNTtm or 10 μg of pcDNA3.1 using Ca3(PO)4 (27Jordan M. Wurm F. Methods. 2004; 33: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Two days post-transfection, cells were starved for 15 min, pulsed with 250 μCi of 35S Promix (Amersham Biosciences) per dish for 5 min. Cells were chased with unlabeled medium for the indicated times. Cells were suspended in lysis buffer and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Radiolabeled lysates were clarified by centrifugation, quantified, and immunoprecipitated with either 1b-specific (for pcDNA3.1-transfected cells) or 1a-specific (1aNTtm-transfected cells) antibodies for 3 h, and immune complexes were isolated with protein A beads for 12–16 h at 4 °C. Proteins were eluted with LSB, heated at 65 °C for 5 min, and size-separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed in a 25% isopropyl alcohol and 10% acetic acid solution, dried at 80 °C for 2 h, and exposed to a phosphorscreen. Pulse chase for 1bΔCT stable cells was set up similarly with indicated pulse and chase times. Fractional Centrifugation—HEK-293 1bΔCT cells were transfected with DNA for either pcDNA3.1 vector or 1aNTtm. Cells were homogenized in 750 μl of protease inhibitor (Roche minitab)-supplemented 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 2 days post-transfection. Cells were lysed manually using a 25-gauge needle. Lysate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g to remove crude cellular debris (1,000 × g pellet). Supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min to separate large membranes (e.g. ER, Golgi, plasma membrane; 10,000 × g pellet). The supernatant was subjected to a final centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min to separate small organelles (e.g. endosomes, lysosomes; 100,000 × g pellet) and the cytosol (100,000 × g supernatant). Each pellet was dissolved in 300 μl of lysis buffer (protease-inhibitor supplemented 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1% Triton X-100). Up to 1% Triton X-100 was added to lyse the cytosolic fraction. Densitometry and Statistical Analysis—Coomassie Blue-stained gels and x-ray films of Western blots were quantified by measuring optical density using LabWorks Image and Acquisition Analysis Software (Upland, CA). Data were analyzed using PRISM 2.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego). For in vitro binding assays (Fig. 3), data from three separate experiments were normalized, plotted, and fitted with variable slope sigmoidal dose-response Equation 1, Y=Min+{(Max-Min)/[1+10(logEC50-X)×Hill Slope]}(Eq. 1) where X is the logarithm of concentration and Y is the response. For assessing the degree of 1bΔCT homo-oligomerization in the absence or presence of the disrupting 1aNTtm fragment (Fig. 5), we used the formula in Equation 2. Level of homo-oligomerization=1bΔCT-GFP/1bΔCT-Mycinput/1bΔCT-GFP/1bΔCT-MycIP(Eq. 2) This formula allowed us to take in account the variability in 1bΔCT-GFP and 1bΔCT-Myc protein expression in different sets of lysates. Data were analyzed by running column statistics for one-sample Student's t test. For disruption experiments (Fig. 6), optical density (OD) values for core glycosylated/total 1bΔCT from lysates of cells co-transfected with 1bΔCT and each of the disruption fragments were individually compared with the fractional OD value from 1bΔCT+pcDNA3.1 co-transfected lysate. Data from three experiments were analyzed using a Student's unpaired t test and a two-tailed p value and are presented as mean ± S.E.; n indicates the number of experiments. hERG1 Subunits Assemble in the ER—Core glycosylation of proteins has been shown to be a cotranslational event in the ER lumen (29Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar, 30Rothman J. Lodish H. Nature. 1977; 269: 775-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 31Chen W. Helenius J. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6229-6233Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the glycan groups are further modified in the medial Golgi, rendering fully mature, complexly glycosylated species (32Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3748) Google Scholar). hERG 1a subunits undergo N-linked core glycosylation in the ER at a single site between the S5 transmembrane domain and the P-region (28Gong Q. Anderson C.L. January C.T. Zhou Z. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2002; 283: H77-H84Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We showed previously that hERG 1b subunits expressed in HEK-293 cells mature from an ∼85-kDa core-glycosylated species in the ER to a ∼90-kDa species in the medial Golgi (24Jones E.M. Roti Roti E.C. Wang J. Delfosse S.A. Robertson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44690-44694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), similar to the maturation process for hERG 1a subunits (33Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 230-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Here we show both the mature and immature glycoforms of hERG 1a and 1b can be co-immunoprecipitated from cells transiently transfected with the corresponding cDNA (Fig. 1B, lane 2). The co-immunoprecipitation of immature 1a with 1b subunits indicates they assemble prior to Golgi glycosylation, likely in the ER. hERG 1a and 1b N Termini Interact in Mammalian Cells— To identify the soluble domains required for channel association, we first tested whether heteromeric interactions were preserved in the absence of the C terminus, which might mediate heteromerization. We found that 1aΔCT and 1bΔCT proteins co-expressed in HEK-293 cells could be co-immunoprecipitated using 1a-specific antibodies (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). This association requires interaction of the truncated proteins in vivo, because 1aΔCT and 1bΔCT did not associate in mixed lysates independently expressing the two constructs (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). We conclude that the C terminus, which includes a tetramerization coiled-coil (TCC) domain (34Jenke M. Sanchez A. Monje F. Stuhmer W. Weseloh R.M. Pardo L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), is not required for hERG 1a/1b heteromeric association. To determine whether an intact hydrophobic core is required to mediate association, we made more extensive C-terminal truncations leaving only the N terminus and the first two TM domains (1aNTtm and 1bNTtm, Fig. 2C). Including the first two TMs allows the short N terminus of the 1b subunit to fully emerge from the translocon and attain proper tertiary structure (19Deutsch C. Neuron. 2003; 40: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We co-expressed 1aNTtm and 1bNTtm in HEK-293 cells, and immunoprecipitated the cell lysate with 1a-specific antibodies. 1bNTtm protein co-precipitated with 1aNTtm demonstrating the N termini and first two TMs were sufficient to support association between the 1a and 1b fragments (Fig. 2D, lanes 1 and 2). As in the previous experiment using 1aΔCT and 1bΔCT, 1aNTtm and 1bNTtm did not bind when lysates individually expressing each construct were mixed (Fig. 2D, lanes 3 and 4). Heteromeric N Termini of hERG1 Bind in a Direct Dose-dependent Manner—Attempts to demonstrate association of soluble N termini in the absence of TM were not successful because the short 1b N terminus failed to express in HEK-293 cells. Instead, we turned to in vitro binding assays to determine whether 1aNT and 1bNT polypeptides purified from E. coli could bind directly without the TM domains and the 30-aa region of homology in their N termini. We incubated 2 μm bead-bound GST-1bNT with increasing amounts of soluble 1aNT from 0.3 to 10 μm in separate reactions, eluted bound complex from the beads, and resolved the eluate using SDS-PAGE. Binding of 1aNT to GST-1bNT was sufficiently robust to be visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–6). The low efficiency of 1aNT binding is attributable to the large degree of degradation of 1bNT (visible on gel, under the indicated GST-1bNT polypeptide) and to competing homotypic association of 1aNT fragments (supplemental Fig. S1). Immobilized GST used as a negative control did not show binding to the 1a N terminus at any concentration used (Fig. 3A, lanes 7–12). A dose-response curve plotting the OD of soluble 1aNT bound to GST-1bNT as a function of 1aNT concentration shows binding occurs with an EC50 of 0.96 ± 0.2 μm and a Hill coefficient of 1.52 (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that the 1a and 1b N termini bind each other directly and thus potentially mediate association of heteromeric subunits during assembly. Truncated hERG 1b Serves as a Reporter for Early ER Events—To determine whether hERG 1a and 1b N termini interactions play a role in biogenesis, we next sought an approach to perturb their interaction and measure the effect on early events in assembly. We discovered that the C-truncated construct 1bΔCT exists not in core and maturely glycosylated forms, as is the case for full-length 1b (24Jones E.M. Roti Roti E.C. Wang J. Delfosse S.A. Robertson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44690-44694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), but rather in core and unglycosylated forms (Fig. 4). We identified the core glycoform based on its sensitivity to both PNGase F and Endoglycosidase H (Endo H), which collapsed the 38-kDa 1bΔCT to the same size as the lower, unglycosylated band migrating at ∼35 kDa (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4B shows mature, full-length hERG 1b is insensitive to Endo H, thus ensuring the specificity of the enzyme treatment. The presence of the core and unglycosylated species presented an opportunity to identify, via perturbation, early events leading up to core glycosylation (see below). 1a N-terminal Fragments Disrupt hERG1bΔCT Oligomerization—We exploited ER glycosylation of 1bΔCT to identify the role of heteromeric N-terminal interactions in early assembly of hERG channels. We hypothesized that core glycosylation might report oligomerization of 1bΔCT, and that disruption of these events by 1aNT fragments would provide evidence of heteromeric N-terminal interactions. We first tested whether 1bΔCT subunits oligomerize by co-expressing 1bΔCT-Myc with 1bΔCT-GFP in HEK-293 cells. Using Myc antibodies, we found the larger 1bΔCT-GFP fusion protein co-immunoprecipitated with the 1bΔCT-Myc (Fig. 5A, lanes 1 and 2). The two species do not interact in mixed lysates from cells independently expressing the two constructs (Fig. 5A, lanes 4 and 5). Reciprocal immunoprecipitates using GFP antibodies gave similar results (data not shown). If 1a and 1b N termini efficiently interact, we expect 1aNTtm fragments to disrupt hERG1bΔCT homo-oligomerization. Indeed, as is evident from Western blot results, co-transfection with comparable amounts of 1aNTtm (see supplemental Fig. S2) caused a significant reduction in homo-oligomerization (Fig. 5A, lanes 6 and 7). Association of 1bΔCT-Myc and 1bΔCT-GFP oligomers was dramatically reduced by 80 ± 13% (p = 0.0011, n = 4; Fig. 5B). Thus, the 1aNT fragment disrupts 1bΔCT oligomerization. These experiments demonstrate that avid interaction between 1a and 1b N termini mediate heteromeric assembly. 1a N-terminal Fragments Cause Accumulation of Unglycosylated 1bΔCT—The perturbation of 1bΔCT oligomerization could occur by one of two mechanisms: the 1aNTtm fragment prevents 1b N-terminal interactions during biogenesis, or it causes dissociation of extant 1b oligomers. Preventing early assembly is expected to disrupt core glycosylation, whereas any disruption of preformed 1bΔCT oligomers is not. By measuring core glycosylation, we can pinpoint the timing of the 1aNTtm and 1bΔCT interaction. We cotransfected 1bΔCT into HEK-293 cells with one of the following constructs: empty vector (control), 1aNTtm, or Ndel (lacking N-terminal residues 1–354; cf. Fig. 1A). We assayed the effects of the disrupting fragments in 1bΔCT lysates by measuring the core glycoform as a fraction of the total (core-plus unglycosylated) signal. As compared with the control, cotransfection of 1bΔCT with 1aNTtm resulted in significant reduction in core-glycosylated 1bΔCT, suggesting that the heteromeric N termini interacted prior to the glycosylation step (p < 0.005, n = 3; Fig. 6, A and B). Ndel also reduced core glycosylation but to a lesser extent (p < 0.05, n = 3), and we could not rule out whether this reduction was because of its competition for the glycosylation machinery. In contrast, the greater enrichment of unglycosylated 1bΔCT by 1aNTtm could not have resulted from a direct exhaustion of the glycosylation machinery, because 1aNTtm lacks the hERG1 N-linked glycosylation site. The 1aNTtm fragment associated primarily with the unglycosylated 1bΔCT in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating the increase in unglycosylated 1bΔCT was because of its direct physical association with the disrupting fragments (Fig. 6C). Together, the results above indicate that N-terminal interactions disrupt oligomerization and core glycosylation, reflecting early biogenic events. Interaction with hERG 1a N Terminus Prevents Maturation of 1bΔCT—As an alternative explanation for the increase in abundance of unglycosylated 1bΔCT just described, we considered whether 1a N-terminal fragments might promote degradation of 1bΔCT rather than prevent core glycosylation. If so, we would expect to see an accumulation of deglycosylated 1bΔCT species in the cytosol en route to degradation as part of the unfolded protein response (35Kopito R.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 36Gong Q. Keeney D.R. Molinari M. Zhou Z. J. Biol.

We co-transfected 1bΔCT with vector (as a control) or with 1aNTtm fragment in HEK-293 cells. We radiolabeled cells for 5 min, and immunoprecipitated expressed polypeptides from the cell lysate. The 1bΔCT protein in mock-transfected cells manifests as both the unglycosylated and more abundant core-glycosylated forms (Fig. 7A, left panel). In the presence of 1aNTtm, the core-glycosylated 1bΔCT never appeared, even as early as the transition between the 5-min pulse period and the beginning of the chase period (Fig. 7A, right panel). Endo H selectively reduced the upper 1bΔCT band in control cells, confirming its identity as the core glycoform (Fig. 7B). The rapidity with which association of 1aNTtm caused a loss of the core glycosylated band suggests 1aNTtm prevented core glycosylation of"

Here we provide evidence using immunofluorescence microscopy, cell fractionation, and SNARE protein interaction studies that acinar cells contain two distinct populations of zymogen granules (ZGs) expressing either VAMP 2 or VAMP 8. Further, VAMP 8-positive granules also contain the synaptosome-associated protein 29, whereas VAMP 2-expressing granules do not. Analysis of acinar secretion by Texas red-dextran labeling indicated that VAMP 2-positive ZGs mediate the majority of exocytotic events during constitutive secretion and also participate in Ca2+-regulated exocytosis, whereas VAMP 8-positive ZGs are more largely involved in Ca2+-stimulated secretion. Previously undefined functional roles for VAMP and syntaxin isoforms in acinar secretion were established by introducing truncated constructs of these proteins into permeabilized acini. VAMP 2 and VAMP 8 constructs each attenuated Ca2+-stimulated exocytosis by 50%, whereas the neuronal VAMP 1 had no effects. In comparison, the plasma membrane SNAREs syntaxin 2 and syntaxin 4 each inhibited basal exocytosis, but only syntaxin 4 significantly inhibited Ca2+-stimulated secretion. Syntaxin 3, which is expressed on ZGs, had no effects. Collectively, these data demonstrate that individual acinar cells express VAMP 2- and VAMP 8-specific populations of ZGs that orchestrate the constitutive and Ca2+-regulated secretory pathways.

The exocrine pancreas is responsible for synthesizing and secreting a variety of digestive enzymes that are essential for assimilation of the diet. Secretion occurs by exocytosis of large dense core zymogen granules (ZGs) 3The abbreviations used are: ZG, zymogen granule; SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; VAMP, vesicle-associated membrane protein; SNAP, synaptosome-associated protein; PFO, Perfringolysin O; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. localized in the apical cytoplasm of acinar cells. Similar to endocrine and neural cells, exocytosis is highly induced following acinar stimulation by secretagogues; however, acini are unique in that a significant proportion of exocytosis also occurs by a constitutive pathway under basal conditions. Secretagogue-stimulated exocytosis is mediated by G protein-coupled receptors, which signal through phospholipase C and/or adenylate cyclase, and numerous studies have established roles for Ca2+, diacylglycerol, and cAMP in modulating secretion (reviewed in Ref. 1Williams J.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). For acinar cells of the pancreas, changes in cellular Ca2+ play a pivotal role to trigger exocytosis under normal conditions, and furthermore, during pathophysiological states, aberrant increases in Ca2+ may induce cell damage leading to the onset of pancreatitis (reviewed in Ref. 2Sutton R. Criddle D. Raraty M.G. Tepikin A. Neoptolemos J.P. Petersen O.H. Pancreatology. 2003; 3: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The process of exocytosis and other membrane fusion events is widely held to be regulated by soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) interactions in cells (3Fasshauer D.

SNARE proteins are classified as either Q-SNARE or R-SNARE based on conserved glutamine (Q) and arginine (R) residues positioned within their characteristic coiled-coil motifs. When brought in close opposition, Q- and R-SNAREs on each membrane form a heterotrimeric complex that provides the driving force for membrane fusion. In neurons, one R-containing coil of the complex is derived from vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP/synaptobrevin) present on synaptic vesicles, and one Q-containing coil is contributed by syntaxin 1 located on the pre-synaptic plasma membrane. The remaining two coils of the complex are contributed by synaptosome-associated protein (SNAP) 25, a Q-SNARE also located on the plasma membrane (6Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). VAMPs and syntaxins are integrated into phospholipids via C-terminal hydrophobic regions that orient their coiled-coil motifs into the cytoplasm. Uniquely, SNAP 25 is membrane inserted by palmitoylation of four central cysteine residues positioning separate amino and carboxyl coiled-coil motifs into the cytoplasm (7Steegmaier M. Yang B.

ZGs also express VAMP 2, which modulates a portion of exocytosis, because cleavage of this protein by tetanus toxin led to a significant but incomplete reduction in stimulated secretion in permeabilized cells and in vitro fusion assays (12Hansen N.J.

Additionally, we previously reported in abstract form (15Weng N. Thomas D.D. Groblewski G. FASEB J. 2005; 19: A742Google Scholar) that VAMP 8 is present on ZGs, results that were unexpected as VAMP 8 was initially described as endobrevin, due to its purported role in endosomal vesicle fusion (16Antonin W. Holroyd C. Tikkanen R. Honing S. Jahn R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3289-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). More recently, Wang et al. (10Wang C.C. Ng C.P. Lu L. Atlashkin V. Zhang W. Seet L.F. Hong W. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 359-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) showed that genetic ablation of VAMP 8 in mice did not significantly disrupt endosomal trafficking. Rather, VAMP 8 null mice exhibited pronounced alterations in exocrine pancreas morphology corresponding with elevated levels of basal secretion but a compromised response to stimulated secretion (10Wang C.C. Ng C.P. Lu L. Atlashkin V. Zhang W. Seet L.F. Hong W. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 359-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Although VAMP 2 and VAMP 8 are known to regulate acinar secretion, their concerted function in the overall secretory response has not been investigated. Likewise, despite having identified the major apical membrane Q-SNAREs syntaxin 2 and syntaxin 4, a definitive role for these molecules in the constitutive and regulated secretory pathways has not been established. In this study, we examined the SNARE complexes in pancreatic acinar cells that mediate the constitutive and Ca2+-stimulated secretory pathways. Evidence demonstrates that individual acinar cells contain distinct populations of ZGs expressing either VAMP 2 or VAMP 8. Utilizing dextran labeling to identify sites of VAMP-specific ZG exocytosis indicated that VAMP 2-positive granules were highly localized at the apical plasma membrane under both basal and Ca2+-stimulated conditions. In comparison, VAMP 8-positive granules were much less concentrated at the apical membrane and appeared to interact with the plasma membrane at regions that were distinct from VAMP-2/dextran staining. Utilization of truncated SNARE constructs in permeabilized acini revealed that syntaxin 4, which is known to interact with VAMP 8, selectively inhibited Ca2+-stimulated secretion, whereas syntaxin 2, which is exclusively present on the apical membrane, inhibited only the constitutive pathway. Taken together, these data indicate that VAMP 2 plays a major role in the constitutive secretory pathway and participates in Ca2+-regulated secretion. In comparison, VAMP 8-positive granules appear to be more involved in Ca2+-stimulated exocytosis.

Isolation of Pancreatic Lobules and Dispersed Acini—The University of Wisconsin Committee on Use and Care of Animals approved all studies involving animals. Pancreatic lobules were prepared by microdissection of an adult male Sprague-Dawley rat pancreas that had been injected with incubation buffer consisting of (in mm) 10 HEPES, 137 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 0.56 MgCl2, 1.28 CaCl2, 0.6 Na2HPO4, 5.5 d-glucose, 2 l-glutamine, and an essential amino acid solution. The buffer was supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, gassed with 100% O2, and adjusted to pH 7.48. Dispersed cultures of pancreatic acinar cells were isolated from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats by collagenase digestion as described previously (20Wishart M.J. Groblewski G. Goke B.J. Wagner A.C.

Acini were suspended in incubation buffer and cells were maintained at 37 °C for 1 h prior to performing assays. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—The buffer used for all blocking, incubations, and washing steps contained: 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 3% bovine serum albumin, 2% goat serum, 0.7% cold water fish skin gelatin, and 0.2% Triton X-100. For cryostat sections of rat pancreas (Figs. 2 and 4A), lobules were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and immunofluorescence microscopy was conducted on 9-μm-thick cryostat sections as previously described (22Thomas D.D.

For images of acinar cell whole mounts (Fig. 5) isolated acini were allowed to settle on poly-l-lysine-coated microscope slides in wells created using a silicone slide cover. For dextran labeling, cells were incubated in HEPES buffer containing 1 mg/ml dextran for 5 min at room temperature before treatment with CCK-8 at room temperature. Following fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde, cells were blocked for 30 min at room temp, and primary antibodies were added simultaneously for 1.5 h at room temp. Secondary antibodies were added simultaneously for 1 h at room temp after washing (3 × 5 min). For VAMP 8, a secondary antibody amplification system (anti-rabbit-FITC followed by rabbit anti-FITC Alexa 488 conjugate) was used due to low signal intensity; however, initial studies conducted without amplification yielded identical results but required much higher laser settings. Due to the low expression levels of epithelial SNAREs, detection using secondary antibody amplification has previously been described (24Weimbs T. Low S.H. Li X. Kreitzer G. Methods. 2003; 30: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For ZG immunofluorescence (Fig. 4, B–D), Percoll-purified ZGs were fixed for 1 h in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and embedded in Tissue-Tek. Immunofluorescence microscopy was conducted on 9-μm-thick cryostat sections as described above. In all cases, specificity of antibodies was determined by measuring fluorescence with secondary antibodies alone and in the case of VAMP 8, by antigen competition. Tissues were analyzed using a Radiance 2100 Bio-Rad Multiphoton/Confocal imaging system. For dual-immunofluorescence measurements, fluorophores were individually excited at the appropriate wavelength to ensure no overlapping excitation between channels. Captured images were overlaid and processed for presentation using ImageJ software. Movies of captured z-series and three-dimensional reconstruction of fixed acinar whole mounts, provided as supplemental movies for Fig. 5, were made using ImageJ and Windows Movie Maker software. For semiquantification of images in Fig. 4 (E and D), multiple z-series images from at least three separate tissue preparations were analyzed using ImageJ software with the colocalization threshold plug-in. All images used were raw data that had not been manipulated in any way prior to analysis. Threshold values for each image were automatically determined by the software and, therefore, were unbiased and provided conservative estimates. Analysis of VAMP 8-granule recruitment to the apical membrane (Fig. 5E) was conducted by counting the number of VAMP 8-positive puncta that colocalized with dextran alone or VAMP 2 and dextran in two optical fields obtained with a 100× objective for each treatment group. Data were quantified from three independent experiments utilizing different acinar preparations.FIGURE 4VAMP 2 and VAMP 8 are present on separate populations of ZGs.

PFO is a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin that assembles to create large aqueous pores in cell membranes (19Waheed A.A. Shimada Y. Heijnen H.F. Nakamura M. Inomata M. Hayashi M. Iwashita S. Slot J.W. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4926-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). PFO was allowed to bind to intact cells on ice for 10 min, and excess unbound PFO was then removed by washing at 4 °C in the same buffer without PFO. Acini were aliquoted into pre-chilled microcentrifuge tubes (200 μl/tube) containing the indicated amounts of recombinant proteins. The cell suspension was then diluted with an equal volume of the same buffer containing enough CaCl2 to create the desired final concentration of free Ca2+. The quantity of CaCl2 added to the buffer was calculated based on dissociation constants using a computer program as previously described (21Thomas D.D. Taft W.B. Kaspar K.M. Groblewski G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28866-28872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To measure basal secretion, permeabilized cells were incubated at 37 °C with indicated amounts of recombinant proteins in the presence of ≤10 nm of free Ca2+. Following incubation, cells were cooled in an ice bath and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 1 min. The content of amylase in the medium was determined using a Phadebas assay kit. Data were calculated as the percentage of total cellular amylase present in an equal amount of cells measured at the start of the experiment.

Tissue was homogenized by three strokes of a motor-driven homogenizer (5,000 rpm) using a Teflon pestle with 0.5- to 1-mm clearance. A postnuclear supernatant was prepared by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min and then further centrifuged at 1,300 × g for 10 min to produce a white pellet enriched in ZGs overlaid by a brown pellet enriched in mitochondria. The remaining supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to separate microsomal and cytosolic fractions. ZGs were further purified by Percoll gradient centrifugation (21Thomas D.D. Taft W.B.

ZG membranes were separated from content by 100,000 × g centrifugation. GST- and His-Protein Purification—Constructs containing the full-length cytoplasmic domains of human VAMP 2 and VAMP 8 were obtained from G. Reed (25Polgar J. Chung S.H. Reed G.L. Blood. 2002; 100: 1081-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). VAMP 1 constructs were prepared by PCR using full-length rat VAMP 1 as a template and the primers GGTGGATCCATGTCTGCTCCAGCTC (forward) and GATCTCGAGTTAGCAGTTTTTCCACCAATA (backward). GST fusion proteins incorporating cytoplasmic domains of VAMPs 1, 2, and 8 were purified by glutathione affinity chromatography and either eluted in buffer containing 10 mm glutathione or released by thrombin cleavage as previously described (26Groblewski G.E.

PFO was purified as a His-tagged protein by Co2+-affinity chromatography in according with the manufacturer's instructions. GST Pull-down Assay and Immunoprecipitations—Membrane fractions prepared from isolated acini or purified ZG membranes were solubilized in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and then incubated with 15 μg of GST alone, GST-VAMP 2 or GST-VAMP 8, together with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C. After 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed extensively, and fusion proteins were eluted by incubating in cleavage buffer containing 0.03 unit/μl thrombin. Binding proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. For immunoprecipitations, detergent-solubilized membrane fractions were incubated with indicated antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Antibodies were then precipitated with Protein A- or G-Sepharose beads for 1 h, and washed extensively in lysis buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (27Groblewski G.E. Wang Y.

Subcellular Localization of SNAREs in Acini—Our initial studies using subcellular fractionation of pancreas confirmed previous reports that VAMP 2 and VAMP 8 are enriched in ZG membranes but absent in ZG content and cytosolic fractions (Fig. 1) (10Wang C.C.

Unlike SNAP 23, which is present exclusively in membrane, small amounts of SNAP 29 were evident in cytosolic fractions, likely reflecting that SNAP 29 does not contain the central cysteine residues that mediate palmitoylation and membrane insertion of SNAP 23 (7Steegmaier M.

To repair the broken ends, NHEJ processes noncompatible ends into a ligatable form but suppresses processing of compatible ends. It is not known how NHEJ controls polymerase and nuclease activities to act exclusively on noncompatible ends. Here, we analyzed processing independently of ligation by using a two-stage assay with extracts that recapitulated the properties of NHEJ in vivo. Processing of noncompatible ends required wortmannin-sensitive kinase activity. Since DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) brings the ends together before undergoing activation of its kinase, this suggests that processing occurred after synapsis of the ends.

Processing of DNA ends is a key step in NHEJ since double-strand breaks often create ends that are not directly ligatable. For example, ionizing radiation generates nucleotides with aberrant structures such as 3′-phosphate or 3′-phosphoglycolate groups, which must be removed by nuclease activity before ligation can occur. Processing of DNA ends in vivo has been studied in the context of V(D)J recombination. The RAG1/RAG2 dimer cleaves two sites in the immunoglobulin locus to create two hairpin coding ends and two blunt signal ends (1van Gent D. Ramsden D. Gellert M. Cell. 1996; 85: 107-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Nuclease activity opens the hairpin ends to leave 3′ overhangs, which are filled in to generate P-nucleotide addition (2Schlissel M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2029-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To fill in 3′ overhangs, a polymerase must synthesize DNA from a primer on the opposing end. Nucleotide deletion also occurs, but nuclease activity is limited to less than 20 nucleotides, often back to regions of microhomology (3Gilfillan S. Dierich A. Lemeur M. Benoist C. Mathis D. Science. 1993; 261: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 4Komori T. Okada A. Stewart V. Alt F. Science. 1993; 261: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the blunt signal ends are joined without processing. Thus, the NHEJ reaction is strongly biased toward the preservation of DNA sequence, suppressing processing if it is not needed and limiting the extent of processing when it is required. The NHEJ reaction requires core proteins and processing enzymes (5Weterings E. van Gent D.C. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 1425-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The core proteins include Ku, DNA-PKcs, XRCC4/Ligase IV (XL), and Cernunnos (also named XRCC4-like factor, XLF) (6Ahnesorg P. Smith P. Jackson S.P.

The biochemical properties of these proteins suggest that NHEJ repairs double-strand breaks in an ordered series of steps. Ku binds to DNA ends and translocates inward, recruiting DNA-PKcs (13Hammarsten O. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 14Yoo S. Dynan W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4679-4686Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). DNA-PKcs brings the ends together, activating its kinase activity (15DeFazio L. Stansel R. Griffith J. Chu G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3192-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). DNA-PKcs then phosphorylates itself and its target proteins (16Meek K. Gupta S. Ramsden D.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 200: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The ends are processed if necessary, and XL catalyzes the final ligation step (17Grawunder U. Wilm M. Xiantuo W. Kulezla P. Wilson T.E. Mann M. Lieber M.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 492-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Important questions remain unanswered. NHEJ requires DNA-PKcs kinase activity (18Kurimasa A. Kumano S. Boubnov N. Story M. Tung C.S. Peterson S. Chen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3877-3884Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), but it is not known whether the kinase activity affects processing or ligation. XL interacts with polymerase μ, polymerase λ, and Cernunnos/XLF (6Ahnesorg P. Smith P. Jackson S.P.

Furthermore, it is not known how NHEJ suppresses processing of compatible ends. The biochemistry of processing can be studied in cell-free systems that permit manipulation of the component proteins. Progress has been made by partially reconstituting the joining reaction with purified proteins. Nick McElhinny et al. (19Nick McElhinny S.A. Havener J.M. Garcia-Diaz M. Juarez R. Bebenek K. Kee B.L.

Ma et al. (20Ma Y. Lu H. Tippin B. Goodman M.F. Shimazaki N. Koiwai O. Hsieh C.L. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 701-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) studied processing by Artemis, polymerases μ and λ, DNA-PKcs, Ku, and XL, but their system lacked Cernunnos/XLF. Furthermore, they observed frequent nontemplated nucleotide addition, which does not occur in vivo unless terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase is present (3Gilfillan S. Dierich A. Lemeur M. Benoist C. Mathis D. Science. 1993; 261: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 4Komori T. Okada A. Stewart V. Alt F. Science. 1993; 261: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). We previously reproduced NHEJ in crude cell extracts (21Budman J. Chu G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The joining reaction in extracts had many properties of NHEJ in vivo, including requirements for Ku, DNA-PKcs, and XL. As observed for V(D)J recombination in vivo, polymerase activity was capable of filling in both 5′ and 3′ overhangs; nuclease activity was limited to less than 20 nucleotides and extended back to regions of microhomology. Finally, processing was highly efficient for noncompatible ends but strongly suppressed for compatible ends. Here, we used cell-free extracts in a two-stage assay to determine whether DNA-PKcs kinase activity or XL is involved in processing or ligation. The assay demonstrated that kinase activation is required for both processing and ligation of DNA ends. In addition, we discovered that XL is required for all of the polymerase activity and much of the nuclease activity in the NHEJ reaction. These results suggest a model for how processing is controlled in vivo. Extract Preparation—We prepared whole cell extracts as described previously (21Budman J. Chu G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 22Baumann P. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14066-14070Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 23Budman J. Chu G. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 430-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) from pellets of 10-liter suspension cultures of HeLa S3 cells grown at the National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN) and lymphoblastoid cells (GM00558C, Coriell Cell Repositories) grown in medium consisting of RPMI 1640, 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). To immunodeplete XRCC4/Ligase IV, we preincubated extract at 4 °C for 90 min with XRCC4 antibody (Serotec) at a ratio of 1 μl of antibody to 15 μl of extract, incubated the mixture with washed protein A-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 90 min with rotation, and centrifuged the mixture at 4000 × g for 5 min, leaving the supernatant for the NHEJ reaction. To inhibit the kinase activity of DNA-PKcs, we preincubated extract with 10 μm wortmannin for 30 min on ice. DNA Substrates—We used PCR to amplify DNA fragments DNA1 (869 bp) and DNA2 (819 bp) with primers containing restriction enzyme sites for EcoRI, BamHI, KpnI, EcoRV, SacI, PvuI, or ClaI as described previously (21Budman J. Chu G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Direct digestion of the PCR products could produce contamination from residual uncut DNA. Therefore, we subcloned the PCR products into the pCR-BluntII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), released the DNA fragment by cleavage with the appropriate restriction enzyme, and purified DNA1 and DNA2 by agarose gel electrophoresis. Two-stage Assay for Processing of DNA Ends—In stage 1, we incubated 4 μl of extract at 37 °C for 90 min with DNA fragments, DNA1 and DNA2, each at a concentration of 18.4 fmol, in a 20-μl volume containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 60 mm KOAc, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.08 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, as described previously (21Budman J. Chu G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Some reactions contained 25 μm dNTPs, as indicated. We started reactions by adding extract to the DNA and buffer mixture and stopped reactions by adding 2 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8. In stage 2, we purified the DNA by loading the reaction mixture from stage 1 onto a QiaQuick column (Qiagen PCR purification kit) and eluting the DNA products in 100 μl of buffer containing 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5. We incubated half of the DNA overnight at room temperature with 1 μl of T4DNA ligase (1 Weiss unit/μl; USB Corp.) in the manufacturer's buffer and then purified the DNA on a QiaQuick column. As a control, we incubated half of the DNA in manufacturer's buffer only. We chose T4 ligase from USB Corp. because it contained lower levels of contaminating nuclease activity than several other commercial preparations. We performed each joining reaction in triplicate. To avoid jackpot effects, we harvested DNA products from at least two independent joining reactions, amplified the DNA by PCR, and sequenced five DNA junctions as described previously (21Budman J. Chu G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The primer termini were located 182 and 583 bases from the ends of DNA1 and DNA2, respectively, to permit detection of large deletions. Joining efficiency was measured by quantitative PCR as described previously (21Budman J. Chu G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The “percentage of DNA ends joined” was based on a reference sample for 100% joining, which consisted of 18.4 fmol of preformed junction DNA. Quantitative PCR detected only the junctions specified by the PCR primers. The 3′ ends of the quantitative PCR primers were 109 and 132 bases from the ends of DNA1 and DNA2, respectively, and the 3′ end of the TaqMan probe was 104 bases from the end of DNA2. Purification of Recombinant XRCC4/Ligase IV—Baculoviruses expressing recombinant XRCC4 and Ligase IV (a gift from Dr. William Dynan) were used to co-infect 1 liter of Sf9 insect cells at a multiplicity of infection of 2. About 50 h after infection, cells were harvested by centrifugation, flash-frozen, and stored at -80 °C. Cells were thawed, resuspended in 35 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4 pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1% Igepal-CA630, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2.7 mm benzamidine, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science)), lysed by sonication, and cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. To purify recombinant XL, we incubated the supernatant with 0.5 ml of Ni+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) in the presence of 20 mm imidazole for 1 h at 4 °C, packed the beads into a column, washed the column several times with wash buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) at alternating pHs of 7.4 and 6.0, and eluted proteins with wash buffer at pH 7.4 containing 300 mm imidazole. We analyzed fractions for the presence of recombinant XL (rXL) by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot, purified the rXL fractions on a second column consisting of Superdex 200 (26/60) (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with S buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol), dialyzed peak fractions against S buffer containing 20 mm NaCl, and purified XL further on a third column consisting of Mono Q (5/50 GL) (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with S buffer containing 20 mm NaCl, eluting rXL with a linear gradient of NaCl (0.02–0.6 m) in S buffer. Fractions containing rXL were flash-frozen and stored at -80 °C in aliquots at a final concentration of 2 μm. For use in the NHEJ reaction, we diluted the purified rXL 20-fold with extract buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KOAc, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol), and added 1 μl of diluted rXL to the 20-μl end-joining reaction so that the final concentration of rXL was 5 nm. Comparative Western blots showed that the XL concentration in extracts was 1–2 nm (data not shown). A Two-stage Assay for Productively Processed Ends—Cell extracts can process and ligate DNA ends in a manner that recapitulates NHEJ in vivo (21Budman J. Chu G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Joining requires Ku, XL, and DNA-PKcs. However, it is not known whether XL or DNA-PKcs participates in the processing step or the ligation step of NHEJ. We used a two-stage assay to separate the processing and ligation steps (Fig. 1A). For stage 1, we prepared linear DNA substrates, DNA1 and DNA2, by cleaving the ends on each substrate with one of several restriction enzymes: EcoRI, KpnI, SacI, or EcoRV (21Budman J. Chu G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We then incubated the DNA substrates with one of four extract preparations: 1) untreated extract; 2) extract treated with wortmannin to inhibit the kinase activity of DNA-PKcs; 3) extract immunodepleted with anti-XRCC4 antibodies to remove XL; and (4Komori T. Okada A. Stewart V. Alt F. Science. 1993; 261: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) XL-depleted extract supplemented with purified rXL. For stage 2, we purified DNA from the joining reaction and identified productively processed ends that remained unligated by exploiting the ability of T4 ligase to join compatible ends (24Chappell C. Hanakahi L.A. Karimi-Busheri F. Weinfeld M. West S.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2827-2832Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Thus, we treated half of the purified DNA with T4 DNA ligase and left the other half of the DNA untreated (Fig. 1A). We then measured joining efficiency by quantitative PCR and examined the processed ends by PCR amplification and sequencing of the junctions. T4 Ligase Can Be Used to Detect Ligatable Ends Generated during the Two-stage Assay—We wanted to ensure that T4 ligase could detect a mixture of processed ends since extracts often process a pair of noncompatible DNA ends in several different ways (21Budman J. Chu G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To mimic heterogeneous processing by extracts, we created substrates by cleavage with a different restriction enzyme at each end (Fig. 1B). We first tested T4 ligase on one pair of compatible ends created from BamHI, EcoRI, KpnI, or SacI. With these substrates, T4 ligase joined compatible ends with efficiencies of 12–15% (Fig. 1B). By contrast, the maximum joining efficiency was 33% since T4 ligase potentially joined the new substrates in six orientations, and the PCR primers detected only two of the orientations (supplemental Fig. 1). Thus, T4 ligase joined a large fraction of the compatible ends in a homogeneous DNA population of DNA1 and DNA2 molecules. We then tested T4 ligase on mixtures of compatible ends. Joining efficiency decreased less than 2-fold when the mixture contained two or even four different substrates (Fig. 1B). Thus, the two-stage assay with T4 ligase was capable of detecting a large fraction of productively processed ends, even in a heterogeneous mixture. To confirm that T4 ligase could detect productively processed ends with high specificity, we compared ligation of compatible ends with ligation of noncompatible ends. T4 ligase joined compatible ends 1000-fold more efficiently than noncompatible ends (supplemental Fig. 2). The low levels of joining for noncompatible ends were due to contamination of the commercial T4 ligase preparations with nuclease activity, which converted the overhanging ends into blunt ends (data not shown). Thus, T4 ligase showed high specificity for the detection of compatible ends. HeLa and Lymphoblastoid Extracts Recapitulate NHEJ in Vivo—We performed the two-stage assay on extracts from HeLa and lymphoblastoid cells to ensure that our conclusions would not be specific for a single cell type. Thus, extracts from two cell lines were treated in four ways (Fig. 1A), with and without added dNTPs. In stage 1, extract preparations were incubated with one of three pairs of ends. In stage 2, the DNA products were left untreated or treated with T4 ligase. To facilitate comparisons, experiments included all 96 reactions executed in parallel, using a single pool of reagents (supplemental Fig. 3). The experiments were performed in triplicate. For all experiments with extracts, each DNA substrate was created with a single restriction enzyme. Extracts joined these substrates by intermolecular ligation, without detectable intramolecular ligation into circular monomers (21Budman J. Chu G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The maximum joining efficiency for extracts was 12.5% since extracts potentially joined ends in 16 orientations, and the PCR primers detected only two orientations (supplemental Fig. 1). Extracts from HeLa and lymphoblastoid cells processed noncompatible ends using polymerase and nuclease activities (Fig. 2 and Supplemental Fig. 4). Polymerase activity filled in both 5′ overhangs and 3′ overhangs, as observed in vivo, and was greatest in extracts with efficient joining. For example, HeLa extract with added dNTPs joined EcoRI-KpnI ends with a high efficiency of 6.38%, and 10 of 20 strands were processed by nucleotide addition (Fig. 2). When dNTPs were omitted, joining efficiencies in HeLa and lymphoblastoid extracts decreased 30- and 56-fold for 5′-3′ noncompatible ends (EcoRI-KpnI) and 8 and 6-fold for blunt-3′ noncompatible ends (EcoRV-SacI), respectively (Fig. 3). Thus, most joining required polymerase activity.FIGURE 3Wortmannin treatment and XL depletion inhibit processing of noncompatible (noncomp) DNA ends. In stage 1, DNA substrates with the indicated ends were incubated with HeLa extract with added dNTPs (A); HeLa extract without added dNTPs (B); lymphoblastoid extract with added dNTPs (C); or lymphoblastoid extract without added dNTPs (D). When indicated, the extract was treated with wortmannin (Ext + wort) or immunodepleted with anti-XRCC4 antibody (Ext - XL). To confirm the specificity of the immunodepletion, rXL was added to the reactions (Ext - XL + rXL). In stage 2, the DNA from stage 1 was incubated with T4 DNA ligase or a buffer control.

In stage 1, DNA substrates with the indicated ends were incubated with HeLa extract with added dNTPs (A); HeLa extract without added dNTPs (B); lymphoblastoid extract with added dNTPs (C); or lymphoblastoid extract without added dNTPs (D). When indicated, the extract was treated with wortmannin (Ext + wort) or immunodepleted with anti-XRCC4 antibody (Ext - XL). To confirm the specificity of the immunodepletion, rXL was added to the reactions (Ext - XL + rXL). In stage 2, the DNA from stage 1 was incubated with T4 DNA ligase or a buffer control. Joining of EcoRI-EcoRI compatible (comp) ends was less efficient for buffer + T4 ligase than for extract ± T4 ligase because ligation into circular monomers occurred for T4 ligase but not extract (20Ma Y.

The data supporting this figure appear in Supplemental Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Nuclease activity in extracts resembled the nuclease activity observed in vivo. Deletions were limited to less than 20 nucleotides, often extending back to regions of microhomology. Nuclease activity was partially obscured by the polymerase activity in HeLa extracts but was more readily observed in lymphoblastoid extracts, particularly without added dNTPs. For example, when dNTPs were omitted from lymphoblastoid extracts, 13 of 20 strands from EcoRI-KpnI ends were processed by nucleotide deletion (Fig. 2). NHEJ in vivo requires DNA-PKcs kinase activity and XL. Our NHEJ reaction in vitro had the same requirements. Joining was blocked by wortmannin (Fig. 3, compare Ext, untreated with Ext + wort, T4 ligase omitted in stage 2). Joining was also blocked by immunodepletion with anti-XRCC4 antibodies (Fig. 3, compare Ext, untreated with Ext - XL, T4 ligase omitted in stage 2). In summary, extracts had properties of NHEJ in vivo, including appropriate polymerase and nuclease activities as well as requirements for XL and DNA-PKcs kinase activity. Extracts Suppress Processing of Compatible Ends—HeLa and lymphoblastoid extracts joined compatible EcoRI-EcoRI ends with efficiencies of 3.2–8.9% (Fig. 3, upper panels, Ext, untreated). These efficiencies are quite high when compared with the maximum of 12.5%. Extracts joined the compatible ends precisely with virtually no evidence of processing. For this report, we sequenced a total of 80 junctions generated from compatible ends (EcoRI-EcoRI) (supplemental Fig. 3I). In a previous report, we sequenced 52 junctions generated from compatible ends (KpnI-KpnI and BamHI-BamHI) (21Budman J. Chu G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Processing affected only one of these 132 junctions. Thus, extracts suppressed virtually all processing when the ends could be ligated directly. Extracts Process and Join Noncompatible Ends with High Efficiency—HeLa extracts with dNTPs joined noncompatible ends as efficiently as compatible ends (Fig. 3A, middle and lower panels, Ext, untreated), although joining noncompatible ends was significantly more complex, requiring the recruitment of polymerase and nuclease activities. To match the efficiency for compatible ends, the NHEJ reaction must have processed most of the noncompatible ends into a ligatable form. Lymphoblastoid extracts joined noncompatible ends with 50-fold lower efficiency than HeLa extracts and processed the ends with less polymerase activity (Fig. 3B, middle and lower panels, Ext, untreated). Thus, a DNA polymerase, or a factor required for DNA polymerase activity, appeared to be deficient in the lymphoblastoid extracts. When dNTPs were omitted, joining efficiencies decreased, albeit more markedly in lymphoblastoid than in HeLa extracts (Fig. 3C and 3D, middle and lower panels, Ext, untreated). Thus, joining efficiencies for noncompatible ends were consistently lower in lymphoblastoid extracts than in HeLa extracts. To determine whether extracts processed but failed to join some of the ends, we added T4 ligase in stage 2. However, T4 ligase did not affect joining efficiency for noncompatible ends (Fig. 3, middle and lower panels, Ext, untreated). Thus, when extracts processed DNA ends into a compatible form, they almost always succeeded in joining the ends. This result raised the possibility that processing might be coupled to ligation. Kinase Activity Is Required for Processing and Ligation of DNA Ends—To examine the role of kinase activity in the processing and ligation steps of NHEJ, we treated extracts with wortmannin to inhibit kinase activity. For both compatible and noncompatible ends, wortmannin decreased joining efficiency at least 100-fold in HeLa and lymphoblastoid extracts (Fig. 3, Ext + wort). For noncompatible ends, wortmannin blocked reactions dominated by polymerase activity, such as joining of 5′-overhanging EcoRI to 3′-overhanging KpnI ends in HeLa extracts (Fig. 3, A and C, middle panels). Wortmannin also blocked reactions in extracts with high nuclease activity. For noncompatible ends, the addition of T4 ligase in stage 2 failed to increase the percentage of ends joined (Fig. 3, middle and lower panels, Ext + wort). Thus, kinase activity was required for the processing of noncompatible ends. Compatible ends remained unprocessed when kinase activity was inhibited by wortmannin. The addition of T4 ligase in stage 2 restored full joining efficiency (Fig. 3, upper panels, compare Buffer and Ext + wort), and the junctions were joined precisely. Wortmannin permits DNA-PKcs to bind DNA ends (15DeFazio L. Stansel R. Griffith J. Chu G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3192-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 25Calsou P. Frit P. Humbert O.

Unstressed cells maintain p53 at low levels through regulated degradation, and p53 levels and activity are rapidly elevated upon genotoxic stress. Biochemical mechanisms that control the levels and activity of p53 are therefore of great interest. We and others have recently identified hAda3 (human homologue of yeast alteration/deficiency in activation 3) as a p53-interacting protein and enhancer of p53 activity.

Use of a p53 mutant with mutations of known p300/CREB-binding protein acetylation sites demonstrated that hAda3-dependent acetylation is required for increase in p53 stability and target gene induction. Importantly, we demonstrate that endogenous hAda3 is essential for DNA damage-induced acetylation and stabilization of p53 as well as p53 target gene induction.

Although p53 was identified as a tumor suppressor protein more than 2 decades ago and is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancers (1Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C.

Nature. 1992; 358: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4523) Google Scholar), mechanisms of its tumor suppressor function remain a challenge. The p53 protein is maintained at a very low level in unstressed cells and is rapidly stabilized and activated during periods of cellular stress, such as that induced by DNA damage, resulting in enhanced binding to promoters of specific target genes and their transcriptional activation (4Appella E.

DNA damage-induced post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation, have emerged as critical mediators of altered p53 protein stability (4Appella E.

Acetylation of p53 provides a particularly important mechanism to control p53 stability as well as its activity (5Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W.

Acetylation of p53 involves the recruitment of coactivator complexes containing histone acetyltransferases (HATs) 3The abbreviations used are: HAT, histone acetyltransferase; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; CBP, CREB-binding protein; PCAF, p300/CBP-associated factor; hAda3, human Ada3; hGcn5, human Gcn5; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription; RNAi, RNA interference; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; shRNA, short hairpin RNA. to promoter-bound p53 function, a process that concurrently controls the level of histone acetylation and hence the accessibility of active promoters to general transcriptional machinery (10Barlev N.A.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms that promote stress-induced acetylation and consequent alterations in the activity of p53 is therefore of significant biological interest and extremely relevant to human cancer. Previous studies have identified a number of HATs that can acetylate p53 protein in vitro and appear to mediate p53 acetylation in vivo. These analyses have identified p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP) as well as p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) as p53-directed HATs (5Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Interestingly, different HATs may selectively acetylate specific sites in p53, resulting in distinct biological outcomes. For example, p300-dependent acetylation of Lys-370, -372, -373, -381, and -382 has been correlated with p53 stabilization and increased DNA binding (12Gu W. Roeder R.G.

Notably, analysis of knock-in mice with a missense (K317R) mutation suggests a negative regulatory role of the PCAF-dependent Lys-317 (human p53 Lys-320) acetylation site in p53 (16Chao C. Wu Z.

Thus, cellular factors that facilitate HAT-dependent p53 acetylation are of substantial interest in our understanding of p53 as a tumor suppressor. We and others have recently identified human Ada3 (alteration/deficiency in activation) as a novel p53-binding protein (17Kumar A. Zhao Y. Meng G. Zeng M. Srinivasan S. Delmolino L.M. Gao Q. Dimri G.

Human Ada3 (hAda3) is the homologue of the yeast Ada3, an essential component of the Ada transcriptional coactivator complex composed of Ada2, Ada3, and Gcn5 (general control nonrepressed 5), a HAT (20Pina B. Berger S. Marcus G.A. Silverman N. Agapite J. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5981-5989Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Notably, yeast Ada3, Ada2, and Gcn5 were each required for the transcriptional activity of a human p53 transactivation domain fused to Gal4 DNA-binding domain when expressed in yeast (21Candau R. Scolnick D.M. Darpino P. Ying C.Y. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, overexpression of hAda3 increased p53 levels (17Kumar A. Zhao Y. Meng G. Zeng M. Srinivasan S. Delmolino L.M. Gao Q. Dimri G. Weber G.F. Wazer D.E. Band H. Band V. Mol.

Recent biochemical fractionation of mammalian cell extracts identified hAda3 as a component of complexes that include hAda2 and hGcn5 (22Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). In addition, hAda3 is also found in a number of alternate complexes, such as STAGA complex, that include both hGcn5 and PCAF (23Martinez E. Palhan V.B. Tjernberg A. Lymar E.S. Gamper A.M. Kundu T.K. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 6782-6795Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also shown that hAda3 interacts with p300 (18Wang T. Kobayashi T. Takimoto R. Denes A.E. Snyder E.L. el-Deiry W.S. Brachmann R.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6404-6413Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Given the ability of Ada3 to interact with transcriptional activation domains, these studies strongly suggest that Ada3 may play a key role to link HAT-containing complexes to p53 and thereby regulate p53 acetylation, stability, and activity. In this report, we used inducible ectopic hAda3 expression, shRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous hAda3, and a p53 mutant defective in p300-mediated acetylation to demonstrate an essential role of hAda3 in p53 acetylation, stability, and transcriptional activation following DNA damage. Cells and Media—H1299, a p53-negative human lung cancer cell line, was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. 76NTERT, a p53-positive immortalized human mammary epithelial cells line, was grown in DFCI-1 medium, as described earlier (24Band V. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Antibodies—Generation of anti-hAda3 rabbit polyclonal antiserum has been described previously (17Kumar A. Zhao Y. Meng G. Zeng M. Srinivasan S. Delmolino L.M. Gao Q. Dimri G. Weber G.F. Wazer D.E. Band H. Band V. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 5801-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Biotinylation of anti-hAda3 rabbit polyclonal antibody was carried out using EZ-Link NHS-LC-Biotin from Pierce according to the manufacturer's instructions. Monoclonal antibodies against p53 (DO1), p21, and GFP were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-acetylated p53 antibody was obtained from Upstate (Temecula, CA), anti-FLAG antibodies were from Sigma, β-actin antibodies were from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA), and anti-phospho-p53 (Ser-15) was from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Boston, MA). Transient Transfection and Western Blotting—For transfection experiments, H1299 cells were plated in 60- or 100-mm dishes and transfected with the indicated expression constructs (see figure legends) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The medium was changed after 16 h of transfection, the cells were lysed 40 h post-transfection in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·Cl, 400 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors from Roche Applied Science (Mannheim, Germany), and equivalent amounts of whole cell extracts were processed for SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting with the appropriate antibodies. Inducible Expression of hADA3—Retroviral supernatants were produced by co-transfecting the retroviral expression construct pRevTet-ON (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) with pIK packaging vector into TSA 54 cells using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (19Zeng M.

Equal amounts of whole cell extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG, anti-p53, or anti-β-actin antibodies. Generation of Stable hADA3 shRNA Knock-down Cells—The hAda3-specific RNAi sequences used in shRNA constructs are as follows: 1, GGTGACAGACGATTCCTGA; 2, GCAATCAGAACAAGCCCTT. The oligonucleotides were cloned in the pSUPER-Retro vector (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA). 76NTERT cells were infected with hAda3 RNAi retroviral supernatants as described previously (19Zeng M. Kumar A.

Virally transduced cells were selected in 0.5 μg/ml puromycin for 3 days, and expression of endogenous hAda3 was assessed in the whole cell lysate using Western blotting using anti-Ada3 polyclonal antibody generated in our laboratory (17Kumar A. Zhao Y. Meng G. Zeng M. Srinivasan S. Delmolino L.M. Gao Q. Dimri G. Weber G.F. Wazer D.E. Band H. Band V. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 5801-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The inducible shRNA constructs were generated by cloning the oligonucleotides (I, GCAATCAGAACAAGCCCTT; II, TCAGAACAAGCCCTTCAGT) in the pSUPERIOR-Retro vector as recommended by the manufacturer (OligoEngine). Commercially available trex-U2OS cells (Invitrogen) were used to express the inducible RNAi constructs, since these cells express the compatible tetracyline regulator. Co-immunoprecipitation Analyses—Cell lysates were prepared with NETN buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor cocktail from Roche). Lysates were precleared with 15 μl of protein A and 15 μl of protein G beads (50% slurry) for 1 h at 4°C. For immunoprecipitation, 2 mg of precleared supernatant was incubated with 2 μg of antibody for 2 h with occasional rocking. Next, 20 μl of protein A or protein G beads (50% slurry) were added to the above samples and rocked for an additional 1 h at 4°C. The beads were washed five times with the binding buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted by rocking the beads with the elution buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% SDS) for 30 min at 4 °C. Beads were spun down, and the clear supernatants were boiled with the sample buffer followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies. In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—H1299 cells were transfected with FLAG-ubiquitin, p53, Mdm2, and GFP-Ada3 expression plasmids as indicated in the figure, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Forty hours after transfection, cells were treated with MG132 (10 μm) for 6 h, and cell lysates were prepared with lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 5 μm N-ethylmaleimide. 1-mg extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-p53 (DO-1) antibody, and bound proteins were subjected to Western blot assay using anti-FLAG-HRP antibody. RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—The total RNA was extracted using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen). The semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed with 200 ng of total RNA using the following fprimers: p53 forward primer (5′-CAGCCAAGTCTGTGACTTGCACGTAC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CTATGTCGAAAAGTGTTTCTGTCATC-3′); p21 forward primer (5′-GTGAGCGATGGAACTTCGACTT-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GGCGTTTGGAGTGGTAGAAATC-3′); and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase forward primer (5′-ACCTGACCTGCCGTCTAGAA-3′) and reverse primer (5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′). The RT-PCR products were visualized under UV after running on an ethidium bromide-stained 2% agarose gel. Analysis of the p53 Protein Turnover—Two 100-mm dishes of H1299 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing p53 alone or in combination with FLAG-hAda3. At 16 h post-transfection, cells were trypsinized and pooled, and equal numbers of cells were replated on five 60-mm plates. After, 16 h, 50 μg/ml of cycloheximide (Sigma) was added to the medium, and cells were harvested at the indicated time points. Total cell extracts were prepared, and equivalent amounts were run on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Densitometric analysis was carried out on scanned images using ScionImage for Windows software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Analysis of Cells Exposed to DNA Damage—76NTERT cells stably expressing scrambled RNAi or hAda3 RNAi were either exposed to 20 grays of ionizing radiation or treated with 2.5 μg/ml actinomycin D or 0.5 μg/ml adriamycin; cells were harvested at 0, 4, or 8 h of treatments; and lysates were prepared as above and immunoblotted for acetylated p53, total p53, p21, or β-actin proteins. Endogenous hAda3 Interacts with Endogenous p53—We and others have shown previously (17Kumar A. Zhao Y. Meng G. Zeng M. Srinivasan S. Delmolino L.M. Gao Q. Dimri G. Weber G.F. Wazer D.E. Band H.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6404-6413Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) that ectopic expression of both hAda3 and p53 showed hAda3 interaction with p53. Here, we confirmed this interaction by expressing FLAG-tagged hAda3 and endogenous p53 in U2OS cells, treating cells with adriamycin and immunoprecipitating hAda3 by anti-FLAG antibody, followed by Western blotting with anti-p53 antibody (Fig. 1A). In a second set of experiments, MCF-7 cell lysates after adriamycin treatment were immunoprecipitated with anti-p53 antibody, followed by Western blotting with biotinylated anti-hAda3 polyclonal antibody and streptavidin-HRP. A clear association of both ectopically expressed hAda3 as well as endogenous hAda3 with endogenous p53 was seen in both cells, and the interaction increased dramatically upon adriamycin treatment (Fig. 1, A and B). These results support and extend our previous findings of interaction of hAda3 with p53. Ectopic hAda3 Overexpression Induces the Stabilization of Endogenous p53—hAda3 binds to p53, and that overexpression of both hAda3 and p53 enhances p53-mediated transcriptional activity (17Kumar A. Zhao Y. Meng G. Zeng M. Srinivasan S. Delmolino L.M. Gao Q. Dimri G. Weber G.F. Wazer D.E. Band H. Band V. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 5801-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 18Wang T.

In these studies, we also observed that overexpression of hAda3 increased the levels of a co-introduced ectopic p53 protein (17Kumar A. Zhao Y. Meng G. Zeng M. Srinivasan S. Delmolino L.M. Gao Q. Dimri G. Weber G.F. Wazer D.E. Band H. Band V. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 5801-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). To assess if hAda3 exerts a similar influence on endogenous p53, we engineered a Tet-ON derivative of an hTERT-immortalized human mammary epithelial cell line (76N-TERT) for Tet-inducible expression of FLAG-hAda3. Expression of FLAG-hAda3 in this cell line was doxycyclin dose- and time-dependent (Fig. 2B; data not shown). When hAda3 levels were progressively elevated in these cells by doxycyclin treatment for increasing time periods, a similar progressive increase in the level of endogenous p53 protein was seen (Fig. 2A); no change in p53 levels was observed upon doxycyclin treatment of the same cell line transfected with the control vector (Fig. 2B). These observations extend our earlier results with ectopic p53 (17Kumar A. Zhao Y. Meng G. Zeng M. Srinivasan S. Delmolino L.M. Gao Q. Dimri G. Weber G.F. Wazer D.E. Band H. Band V. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 5801-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and demonstrate that elevation of the cellular hAda3 protein levels increases the level of the endogenous p53 protein. Ectopic hAda3 Expression Increases the Stability of p53 Protein—Given the importance of the regulated p53 protein degradation in the normal cells (9Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36031-36034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), it appeared likely that hAda3-dependent increase in p53 levels may reflect a post-translational mechanism. However, we wanted to first rule out any influence of hAda3 expression on p53 mRNA levels. For this purpose, 76N-TERT Tet-ON cells were transfected with pRev-TRE-FLAG-hAda3 plasmid, followed by doxycyclin induction for various time points. Parallel samples were processed for Western blotting of protein lysates and RT-PCR analysis of p53 message levels. Although doxycyclin induction led to the expected FLAG-Ada3 induction over time and concomitant increased p53 protein levels, RT-PCR analysis showed that p53 mRNA levels remained unchanged similar to mRNA levels of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, used as a loading control (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, the increase in the level of p21 protein, a transcriptional target of p53, was accompanied by an expected doxycyclin-dependent increase in p21 mRNA levels (Fig. 3B). These observations indicated that the accumulation of p53 protein upon hAda3 overexpression is likely to be due to a post-transcriptional mechanism. In order to investigate if the hAda3-dependent increase in p53 levels reflected an increase in the stability of p53 protein, we assessed the half-life of p53 protein following cycloheximide block of new protein synthesis. For this purpose, p53-null H1299 cells were transfected with p53 expression vector pCMV-p53 alone or together with PCR 3.1-based FLAG-hADA3 expression vector. The transfected cells were incubated in the presence of cycloheximide, and p53 levels were assessed by immunoblotting of cellular extracts prepared at various times after cycloheximide addition followed by densitometry to assess the half-life. As shown in Fig. 3C, the overexpression of FLAG-hAda3 resulted in a slower loss of p53 signals compared with cells without hAda3 overexpression. The half-life of the p53 protein increased from around 68 min in cells without Ada3 overexpression to more than 120 min in cells with hAda3 overexpression (Fig. 3D). This finding, together with the lack of any effect on p53 mRNA levels, supports our conclusion that ectopic hAda3 overexpression increases p53 protein levels by promoting its stability. hAda3 Inhibits the Mdm2-mediated Ubiquitination of p53—The p53 protein is constantly ubiquitinated and is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (26Maki C.G. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2649-2654PubMed Google Scholar), and Mdm2 is known to play a major role in this process (27Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar, 28Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2860) Google Scholar). Recent reports have shown that several proteins that directly associate with and stabilize p53 inhibit p53 ubiquitination (29Zhao Y. Lu S. Wu L. Chai G. Wang H. Chen Y. Sun J. Yu Y. Zhou W. Zheng Q. Wu M. Otterson G.A. Zhu W.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 2782-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 30Roe J.S. Kim H. Lee S.M. Kim S.T. Cho E.J. Youn H.D. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 395-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined if hAda3-induced increase in p53 affects p53 ubiquitination. For this purpose, H1299 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing p53, FLAG-ubiquitin, Mdm2, and increasing amounts of GFP-Ada3. Cells were then treated with 26 S proteasome inhibitor MG132, and extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-p53 antibody followed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody conjugated to HRP. The same blot was also probed for p53, Mdm2, or GFP-Ada3 (Fig. 4A). As expected, coexpression of ubiquitin and Mdm2 significantly enhanced p53 ubiquitination as compared with p53 alone (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 3 and 5). Notably, increasing amounts of hAda3 dramatically reduced the ubiquitination of p53 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B, compare lane 5 with lanes 6 and 7). Fig. 4A is Western blotting of lysates used in Fig. 4B with the indicated antibodies. These results clearly demonstrate that hAda3 stabilizes p53 by inhibiting its ubiquitination. hAda3 Overexpression Enhances the Level of p53 Acetylation—Stability of p53 is controlled by post-translational modifications with ubiquitination signaling protein degradation and a number of other modifications, such as acetylation and phosphorylation (4Appella E.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Acetylation of lysine residues can enhance stability by preventing ubiquitin modification as well as by altering protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions (5Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S.

To test this possibility, H1299 cells were transfected with p53 alone or co-transfected with FLAG-hAda3. 16 h after transfection, each transfected plate was split into two plates. One plate in each set was used as a control while the other plate was exposed to adriamycin for 16 h to induce DNA damage, and cell lysates were analyzed for total and acetylated p53 levels using imm"

By binding to Smads, Ski and SnoN recruit transcriptional repressor complexes such as N-CoR/SMRT and mSin3A to TGF-β target promoters and thereby repress transcription of TGF-β-responsive genes (7Luo K.

Upon TGF-β stimulation, SnoN is immediately down-regulated via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway induced by anaphase-promoting complex (APC) or Smurf2 E3 ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligases (10Bonni S.

Wang W. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Luo K. Science. 1999; 286: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). This functions as a negative feedback circuit to limit the effects of TGF-β. Importantly, overexpression of SnoN results in the loss of TGF-β-induced growth arrest of the cells, suggesting a potential mechanism for SnoN-mediated oncogenesis (8Sun Y. Liu X. Eaton E.N.

In this study, we found that TAK1 interacts with SnoN and targets it for degradation. The TAK1 regulation of SnoN may participate in TGF-β-induced cellular responses. Plasmids and Protein—The mammalian expression vectors for TAK1, HA-TAK1, HA-TAK1(K63W), TAB1, and HA-ubiquitin have been described previously (15Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I.

Small interference RNA (siRNA) was produced using the BS/H1 vector to direct expression of the relevant hairpin double-stranded sequence from the H1 promoter. The siRNA target sequences corresponded to nucleotides 88–106 of the TAK1 cording region. Target oligonucleotides were synthesized (5′-GATCCCCGAGATCGACTACAAGGAGATTCAAGAGATCTCCTTGTAGTCGATCTCTTTTTGGAAA-3′; and 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAGAGATCGACTACAAGGAGATCTCTTGAATCTCCTTGTAGTCGATCTCGGG-3′), annealed, and cloned into BS/H1 between the BglII and HindIII sites using standard molecular cloning techniques. Generation of various point mutations of full-length SnoN and SnoN-(1–366), including full-length SnoN and SnoN-(1–366) mutated at Ser-115, Ser-117, and Thr-119 to Ala or Ser-108, Ser-112, Ser-115, Ser-117, Thr-119, Ser-126, Ser-140, and Ser-141 to Ala, were done using PCR and QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequencing. Bacterially expressed SnoN-(1–366) fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) (GST-SnoN-(1–366)) was purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) according to manufacturer's instructions. The retrovirus vectors for HA-SnoN full-length and HA-SnoN mutant full-length were generated by insertion of HA-tagged SnoN cDNAs into pQCXIP vector (Stratagene). Antibodies and Reagents—The following antibodies were used: anti-HA monoclonal antibody 16B12 (Covance), anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma), anti-Sno polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-TAK1 antibody (18Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K.

Scientific, Inc.), λ phosphatase (New England Biolabs), and cycloheximide (Calbiochem) were used. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Virus Infection—293 cells, HaCaT cells, and HeLa S3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum or bovine growth serum (HyClone). Transfection of 293 cells was carried out using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Stable transfections of HaCaT cells and HeLa S3 cells were carried out using TransFast™ (Promega). The retrovirus for expression of HA-SnoN full-length and HA-SonN mutant full-length were generated and infected into HaCaT cells according to the manufacturer's instruction. Stable cell line selection was achieved using G418, hygromycin B, or puromycin. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Plasmid pGBD-C-TAK1(K63W) was used as bait to screen a mouse B cell library (in pGAD) (21Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The bait plasmid and the library cDNAs were co-transformed into the yeast strain PJ69-4A using the lithium acetate method. Yeast cells were plated on selective medium plates and allowed to grow at 30 °C. Positive colonies were then restreaked on selective medium plates. Plasmid DNA was rescued from positive colonies that grew on selective medium plates and subject to further sequence analysis. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Whole cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 0.5% Triton X-100). Proteins from cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of various antibodies and 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The immune complexes were washed three times with wash buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 and once with rinse buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 and suspended in 30 μl of rinse buffer. For immunoblotting, the immunoprecipitates or cell lysates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-P membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were immunoblotted with various antibodies, and bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against mouse or rabbit IgG using the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences). Cellular Fractionation—To isolate the nuclear and the cytoplasm fractions, cells in 10-cm dishes were treated with TGF-β (5 ng/ml) and then lysed with 500 μl of hypotonic buffer A (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 units/ml aprotinin) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer (30 strokes). Lysates were then centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 4 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 12,500 × g for 4 min to obtain the cytosolic fraction. This pellet was resuspended in hypotonic buffer B (buffer A containing 1.7 m sucrose) and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet (nuclear fraction) was resuspended in 0.5% Triton X-100 lysis buffer and sonicated. All steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The purity of the cytosolic and nuclear fractions was assessed by immunoblotting of IκB (a cytosolic marker) and lamin B (a nuclear marker). Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Real-time quantitative PCR was preformed using 7300 Real-time PCR system (PE Applied Biosystems) and SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara Bio Inc.). The cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 10 s; 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 34 s. The primers for PAI-1 (forward, 5′-GCC ATG GAA CAA GGA TGA GAT C-3′; reverse, 5′-AGC CCT GGA CCA GCT TCA G-3′) and β-actin (forward, 5′-GCC GGG ACC TGA CTG ACT AC; reverse, 5′-TCC TTA ATG TCA CGC ACG ATT TC-3′) were designed using Primer Express, version 2.0. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Ectopically expressed HA-TAK1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody as described above. Immunoprecipitates were incubated with or without 1 μg of bacterially expressed SnoN-(1–366) in 10 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) at 30 °C for 15 min. Samples were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. To study the role of TAK1 in TGF-β signaling, we screened for TAK1-binding proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system. A kinase-inactive mutant of TAK1, TAK1(K63W), was used as the bait to screen a mouse B cell cDNA library. From a total of 2 × 106 transformants, 28 clones were identified as potential interactors. Sequence analysis revealed that one of the positive clones encoded SnoN2 (Fig. 1A). SnoN undergoes alternative splicing, creating four splicing isoform, SnoN, SnoN2, SnoI, and SnoA (7Luo K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 24Pearson-White S. Crittenden R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2930-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The N terminus of SnoN, from 1 to 366 amino acids, is identical among the four isoforms. The SnoN2 sequence is completely identical with that of SnoN except for the C-terminal 46 amino acids (Fig. 1B). As SnoN2 is the less abundantly expressed isoform in human cells (24Pearson-White S. Crittenden R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2930-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we focused on the interaction between TAK1 and SnoN. Interaction of TAK1 with SnoN was further confirmed in mammalian cell by co-immunoprecipitation assays. HA epitope-tagged TAK1 and FLAG-tagged SnoN were transiently co-expressed in 293 human embryonic kidney cells. The cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and followed by immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 1C). When FLAG-SnoN was immunoprecipitated, both HA-TAK1 and HA-TAK1(K63W) were co-immunoprecipitated. To establish the connection between TAK1 and SnoN, we next determined the subcellular localizations of TAK1 and SnoN. We performed biochemical fractionation with human keratinocyte HaCaT cells. TGF-β-stimulated and unstimulated HaCaT cells were fractionated into the nuclear and the cytosolic extracts. Endogenous SnoN was localized only in the nucleus but was degraded upon TGF-β stimulation (Fig. 2, left panel). Endogenous TAK1 was localized primarily in the cytoplasm but also was detected in the nuclear fractions. Upon TGF-β stimulation, the amount of nuclear TAK1 was increased. The fractions were reasonably pure, as determined by the presence of IκB only in the cytosolic fraction and not in the nuclear fraction. Conversely, a nuclear protein, lamin B, was detected only in the nuclear fraction but not the cytosolic fraction (supplemental Fig. S1). These data raised the possibility that TAK1 is co-localized with SnoN in the nucleus. To examine the interaction between TAK1 and SnoN in the nucleus, endogenous TAK1 was immunoprecipitated following fractionation (Fig. 2, right panel). SnoN was found to be associated with TAK1 in the nuclear fraction independently of TGF-β stimulation, but no association could be detected in the cytosolic fraction. Thus, TGF-β stimulation induces the TAK1 accumulation in the nucleus, and this nuclear TAK1 interacts with SnoN. The observed association between TAK1 and SnoN suggested that TAK1 is involved in the TGF-β-dependent degradation of SnoN. To test the possibility, we employed siRNA to reduce the levels of endogenous TAK1 (25Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8161) Google Scholar). We generated two independent HeLa S3 cell lines stably expressing TAK1 siRNA. Expression of TAK1 in each clone was determined by immunoblotting. Expression of TAK1 siRNA greatly reduced the amount of endogenous TAK1 but not affect β-catenin (Fig. 3A). Both TAK1 knockdown cells and parent cells were then treated with TGF-β and subjected to biochemical fractionation. The nuclear fraction was further subjected to immunoblotting with anti-SnoN, anti-TAK1, and anti-Smad2/3. As shown in Fig. 3B, TGF-β induced the degradation of SnoN in HeLa S3 cells, but degradation was impaired in TAK1 knockdown cells. In contrast, TGF-β-induced nuclear accumulation of Smad2/3 was observed to be normal in cells expressing TAK1 siRNA. To assess the influence of TAK1 knockdown on the TGF-β-dependent biological events, we examined expression of a TGF-β-responsive gene, PAI-1. PAI-1 participates in wound healing processes. The mRNA levels of PAI-1 were increased at around 30–60 min, which occurred subsequent to SnoN degradation and Smad accumulation. The accumulation of PAI-1 mRNA in response to TGF-β was impaired in the TAK1 siRNA-expressing cells (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that TAK1 is involved in TGF-β-dependent biological processes. We found that the N-terminal region of SnoN-(1–366) was also associated with TAK1 in 293 cells by co-immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 1C). This region is identical in four isoforms of SnoN and sufficient for transcriptional repression (supplemental Fig. S2 and Refs. 14Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Luo K. Science. 1999; 286: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar and 26Liu X. Sun Y. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To determine whether the N terminus of SnoN is sufficient for TGF-β-dependent degradation, we generated HaCaT cells stably expressing HA-tagged SnoN-(1–366). We found that TGF-β treatment induced degradation of SnoN-(1–366) (Fig. 4A). We had shown previously that (5Z)-7-oxozeaenol selectively blocks the activity of endogenous TAK1 (23Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kajino T. Ono K. Ohtomo T. Matsumoto M. Shiina M. Mihara M. Tsuchiya M. Matsumoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18485-18490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). To determine whether the decrease of the SnoN-(1–366) depends on TAK1 activity, we treated the cells with the TAK1 inhibitor. The SnoN degradation was blocked by TAK1 inhibition. Thus, SnoN-(1–366) is likely to be degraded through TAK1-dependent phosphorylation. To further dissect the role of TAK1 on SnoN degradation, we used SnoN-(1–366). To confirm whether TAK1 phosphorylates SnoN-(1–366), we prepared bacterially expressed recombinant GST-SnoN-(1–366) and preformed in vitro kinase assay using immunoprecipitated HA-TAK1 from 293 cells co-transfected with HA-TAK1 and TAB1. TAK1 is activated by co-expression of TAB1 (21Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 27Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We found that TAK1, but not the kinase-inactive TAK1(K63W), could phosphorylate SnoN-(1–366) in vitro (Fig. 4B). To further confirm the phosphorylation of SnoN-(1–366) by TAK1 in vivo, we performed immunoblotting analysis and looked for a mobility shift in SDS-PAGE as an indicator of phosphorylation. In 293 cells, co-expression of TAK1 and TAB1 led to the appearance of a slower migrating form of SnoN-(1–366) (Fig. 4C). This shift in migration was reversed by treatment with phosphatase. These results suggest that TAK1 phosphorylates the N terminus of SnoN in vivo. To define the approximate region of SnoN phosphorylated by TAK1, we generated several truncated versions of SnoN-(1–366). Among the short regions of SnoN, we found that SnoN-(101–214) showed a slower migrating band with co-expression of TAK1 and TAB1 (supplemental Fig. S3A). We then generated a series of SnoN-(101–214) mutants that contain several amino acid substitutions from Ser or Thr to Ala. The analysis suggests that Ser-108, Ser-112, Ser-115, Ser-117, Thr-119, Ser-126, Ser-140, and/or Ser-141 are potential phosphorylation sites. We generated a mutant SnoN-(1–366) containing the Ser/Thr to Ala substitutions at Ser-108, Ser-112, Ser-115, Ser-117, Thr-119, Ser-126, Ser-140, and Ser-141 (SnoN-(1–366 8A)), which did not show slowly migrating band with co-expression of TAK1 and TAB1 (supplemental Fig. S3B). It has been reported that a member of the MAPKKK family phosphorylates substrates within a conserved Ser/Thr-X-X-X-Ser/Thr motif (28Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). We also generated SnoN(1–366 AAA), containing mutations of Ser-115, Ser-117, and Thr-119 to Ala and examined TAK1-dependent phosphorylation. SnoN(1–366 AAA) exhibited decreased phosphorylation by TAK1 (Fig. 4C and supplemental Fig. S3B). These results suggest that Ser-115, Ser-117, or/and Thr-119 are major sites of TAK1-dependent phosphorylation. However, we could still detect a slightly slower migrating band of SnoN-(1–366 AAA) when coexpressed with an active TAK1. It is likely that other sites among the eight amino acid residues may also be phosphorylated by TAK1. SnoN is ubiquitinated and degraded upon TGF-β stimulation (11Stroschein S.L. Bonni S. Wrana J.L. Luo K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2822-2836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Sun Y. Liu X. Ng-Eaton E. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12442-12447Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Our finding raised the possibility that TAK1-dependent phosphorylation of SnoN may induce SnoN ubiquitination and degradation. To investigate the relationship between SnoN phosphorylation and ubiquitination, we asked whether TAK1 induces SnoN ubiquitination. 293 cells were transfected with HA-tagged SnoN or SnoN-(1–366), TAK1, TAB1, and FLAG-ubiquitin. We immunoprecipitated SnoN followed by immunoblotting for ubiquitin (anti-FLAG) (Fig. 5A). The full-length SnoN was ubiquitinated to some extent in the absence of TAK1, and the level of ubiquitination was increased by co-expression of TAK1 + TAB1. However, the kinase-inactive TAK1(K63W) could not increase the ubiquitination. This suggests that TAK1-dependent phosphorylation of SnoN can trigger its ubiquitination. To verify the role of TAK1-dependent phosphorylation, we used the SnoN mutant lacking the phosphorylation sites SnoN(1–366 AAA). 293 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged SnoN-(1–366), TAK1, TAB1, and HA-tagged ubiquitin. SnoN-(1–366) was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, and ubiquitinated SnoN-(1–366) was detected by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody (Fig. 5B). Co-expression of TAK1 and TAB1 resulted in a marked increase in the ubiquitination of SnoN-(1–366). In contrast, SnoN(1–366 AAA) mutant, which lacks major phosphorylation sties, showed almost no ubiquitination under the same conditions. To further investigate the effect of TAK1 phosphorylation on the full-length SnoN, we generated a mutant full-length SnoN carrying the mutation at Ser-115, Ser-117, and/or Thr-119 (SnoN AAA). Although the basal level of ubiquitination was unchanged in the mutant SnoN (SnoN AAA), The TAK1 + TAB1-induced increase of ubiquitination was abrogated in SnoN AAA. These results suggest that phosphorylation of SnoN at Ser-115, Ser-117, and/or Thr-119 by TAK1 is important for SnoN ubiquitination. We next examined the effect of SnoN phosphorylation on its degradation. 293 cells were transfected with SnoN-(1–366), SnoN-(1–366) mutant SnoN-(1–366 AAA), TAK1, and TAB1, and the half-life of SnoN-(1–366) was determined following cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 6A). In the absence of the active TAK1, SnoN-(1–366) was stable and was not significantly degraded until 2 h after the cycloheximide treatment, whereas the half-life was significantly shortened when TAK1 was activated. The SnoN-(1–366 AAA) mutant showed a longer half-life compared with the wild type SnoN-(1–366) in the presence of active TAK1 (TAK1 + TAB1). These results suggest that phosphorylation at Ser-115, Ser-117, and Thr-119 is important for degradation of SnoN. To investigate whether phosphorylation of SnoN was required for TGF-β-induced degradation, we generated HaCaT cells stably expressing SnoN-(1–366), and SnoN-(1–366 AAA) mutant. Whereas SnoN-(1–366) was rapidly decreased in response to TGF-β stimulation, the SnoN-(1–366 AAA) levels decreased slowly compared with the wild type (Fig. 6B). Finally, we tested the TGF-β-induced degradation of the full-length SnoN. We generated HaCaT cells stably expressing SnoN wild type and AAA mutant and examined their levels upon TGF-β treatment (Fig. 6C). We used two independent stable clones that express SnoN or SnoN AAA at different levels. SnoN AAA decreased slowly compared with the wild type SnoN in both clones. These results suggest that TAK1-dependent phosphorylation is important for the TGF-β-induced degradation of SnoN. Our data have demonstrated that mutation of SnoN and SnoN-(1–366) at Ser-115, Ser-117, and Thr-119 reduced TGF-β-induced degradation; however, SnoN AAA and SnoN-(1–366 AAA) were still degraded at 30 min after TGF-β stimulation. This may be consistent with the fact that SnoN-(1–366 AAA) was still phosphorylated to some extent by TAK1 (Fig. 4C). Other phosphorylation sites may participate in SnoN degradation. To examine this possibility, we determined the half-life of SnoN-(1–366 8A) (supplemental Fig. S3C). SnoN-(1–366 8A) was stable even when TAK1 was activated. We also generated HaCaT cells stably expressing SnoN-(1–366 8A) and examined the effect of TGF-β treatment (supplemental Fig. S3D). SnoN-(1–366 8A) was not degraded by TGF-β and was much more stable compared with SnoN-(1–366 AAA). Thus, although Ser-115, Ser-117, and Thr-119 may be major sites of TAK1-dependent phosphorylation, phosphorylation at other sites is likely to participate in the induction of SnoN degradation. SnoN represses TGF-β signaling by recruiting transcriptional repressors to Smad complex (3Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2114) Google Scholar, 14Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Luo K. Science. 1999; 286: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). We next examined whether the phosphorylation of SnoN modulates its transcriptional activity. Transient transfection experiments were performed in 293 cells with a transcriptional reporter, 3TP-lux, which contains TGF-β-responsive elements of the PAI-1 promoter region (29Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). At 48 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared, and luciferase activities were measured (supplemental Fig. S2). The constitutively active form of TGF-β receptor ALK5(TD) was sufficient to induce the expression of a TGF-β-responsive gene in 293 cells, and overexpressed full-length SnoN as well as SnoN-(1–366) suppressed the TGF-β-dependent transcription as reported previously (3Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2114) Google Scholar, 14Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Luo K. Science. 1999; 286: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). SnoN-(1–366 AAA and 8A) mutants could also reduce the TGF-β-dependent transcription, suggesting that the mutation does not affect binding to Smads or to transcriptional co-repressors. SnoN-(1–366) mutants may be a more potent inhibitor compared with SnoN-(1–366), because it is stable upon TGF-β stimulation. However, in the transiently transfection experiments, we could not detect the difference between SnoN-(1–366) and SnoN-(1–366 AAA and 8A), which is likely because they were highly expressed and ALK5(TD) could not effectively reduce the amount of SnoN-(1–366). Collectively, our results suggest that SnoN-(1–366 AAA and 8A) can bind to and inhibit Smads but is resistant to TAK1-mediated degradation. Therefore, TAK1 is likely to inhibit SnoN by modulating SnoN stability. In this report, we have determined the role of TAK1 MAP-KKK in TGF-β. Previous works had shown that TAK1 is activated by TGF-β (15Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar) and that SnoN, an inhibitor of Smads, is degraded upon TGF-β stimulation (13Sun Y. Liu X. Ng-Eaton E. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12442-12447Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This study links these two observations and suggests that TAK1 contributes to the induction of TGF-β-responsive genes by inducing the degradation of SnoN (Fig. 7). SnoN has been shown to be the important negative regulator of TGF-β signaling via its interaction with Smad proteins (7Luo K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 8Sun Y. Liu X. Eaton E.N. Lane W.S. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Upon TGF-β stimulation, SnoN is rapidly degraded by ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway (13Sun Y. Liu X. Ng-Eaton E. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12442-12447Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 14Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Luo K. Science. 1999; 286: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Two ubiquitin ligases are reported as SnoN ubiquitin ligases. One is anaphase-promoting complex, which induces the ubiquitination of SnoN on Lys-440, Lys-446, and Lys-449 and its consequent degradation in a Smad3-dependent manner (11Stroschein S.L. Bonni S. Wrana J.L. Luo K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2822-2836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wan Y. Liu X. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1027-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Another ubiquitin ligase is Smurf2, which is recruited to SnoN by Smad2, resulting in the ubiquitination and degradation of SnoN (10Bonni S. Wang H.R. Causing C.G. Kavsak P. Stroschein S.L. Luo K. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). SnoN-(1–366), which lacks sites ubiquitinated by APC or Smurf2, is neither ubiquitinated nor degraded in Ba/F3 pro-B cells (14Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Luo K. Science. 1999; 286: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). However, we show that TGF-β induces degradation of SnoN-(1–366) in human keratinocyte HaCaT cells in a manner dependent on TAK1-induced phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Mutation of TAK1-dependent phosphorylation sites on SnoN-(1–366) blocked TGF-β-dependent degradation. Moreover, when endogenous TAK1 was inactivated by a small molecule TAK1 inhibitor in keratinocyte HaCaT cells or by siRNA-mediated knockdown in epithelial-like HeLa S3 cells, degradation of endogenous SnoN was impaired. Collectively, these results suggest that TAK1 phosphorylation of SnoN is required for its ubiquitination and degradation in some epithelial cells. These results further suggest that several different pathways induce SnoN degradation, depending on the cell type. Phosphorylation-induced degradation of proteins is a widely used mechanism by which protein levels can be modulated rapidly. We have found that TAK1 phosphorylates SnoN-(1–366) at several threonine and serine residues and that the SnoN mutant, which lacks its phosphorylation sites, did not undergo ubiquitination or degradation. We should note that the mutant SnoN is still capable of inhibiting TGF-β-induced transcription (supplemental Fig. S2). This indicates that the mutations at the phosphorylation sites do not interfere with interaction of SnoN with Smads or with transcriptional co-repressors. TAK1 is likely to inhibit SnoN solely by modulating SnoN stability. TAK1 is the first kinase demonstrated to phosphorylate SnoN and target it for ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation.

In addition, recent evidence suggests that p300/CBP also interacts directly with complexes that mediate DNA replication and repair. In this report, we show that loss of p300/CBP in mammalian cells results in a defect in the cell cycle arrest induced by stalled DNA replication. We demonstrate that complexes containing p300/CBP and ATR can be detected in mammalian cells, and that the downstream kinase CHK1 fails to be phosphorylated in response to stalled DNA replication in cells that lack p300/CBP. These observations broaden the roles for the p300/CBP acetyltransferases to include the modulation of chromatin structure and function during DNA metabolic events as well as for transcription.

These observations broaden the roles for the p300/CBP acetyltransferases to include the modulation of chromatin structure and function during DNA metabolic events as well as for transcription. Chromosome replication is accomplished by initiating replication forks at many origins along each chromosome. Furthermore, replication origin firing is under strict temporal and spatial control throughout the cell cycle, ensuring that each DNA strand is duplicated only once per cycle (1Kelly T.J. Brown G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 829-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Cell cycle checkpoints continuously monitor the genome to prevent mitosis until DNA synthesis has been completed or until DNA aberrations have been resolved (2Hartwell L.H. Weinert T.A. Science. 1989; 246: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (2425) Google Scholar). There are three distinct, but partially redundant S-phase checkpoints: the replication checkpoint, the intra-S checkpoint, and the S-M checkpoint (3Bartek J. Lukas C. Lukas J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 792-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The replication checkpoint occurs due to stalled replication forks and functions to prevent initiation of DNA replication from unfired origins. The intra-S phase checkpoint is activated by DNA damage during S phase and also prevents initiation from unfired origins. Finally, the S-M checkpoint ensures that the cells do not attempt to divide before the genome has been faithfully duplicated. Failure of the S-M checkpoint results in “catastrophic” mitosis of cells that have incompletely replicated DNA. The S-M phase checkpoint is thought to ensure that mitosis does not occur until the completion of S phase. In eukaryotic cells, the S-M phase checkpoint is dependent upon protein kinases that are related to the ATR/ATM family. ATR is a mammalian gene with homology to the gene mutated in the human genetic disease ataxia telangiectasia (ATM) 2The abbreviations used are: ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated; ATR, ATM- and Rad3-related; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; PBS, Phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; shRNA, small hairpin RNA; CBP, CREB-binding protein.

The protein acetyltransferases p300 and CBP are transcriptional coactivators for signal transduction cascades that regulate cell cycle progression, cellular growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Studies in mice indicate that p300 and Cbp are both required for normal development in a gene dose-dependent manner (17Yao T.P. Oh S.P. Fuchs M. Zhou N.D. Ch'ng L.E. Newsome D. Bronson R.T. Li E.

Yao T.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 272-277PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that p300 and Cbp have at least some overlapping functions. In addition to forming a physical link between activated transcription factors and the basal transcriptional machinery, p300/CBP can enhance signal-responsive transcription by acetylating chromatin-associated proteins and consequently modifying chromatin structure and function (19Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar, 20Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to transcriptional activity, recent evidence suggests that p300/CBP may also interact directly with complexes that mediate chromatin metabolism. For example, p300 has been shown to bind PCNA, associate with newly synthesized DNA, and stimulate DNA synthesis in vitro (21Hasan S. Hassa P.O. Imhof R. Hottiger M.O. Nature. 2001; 410: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In addition, acetylation of Fen1, the endonuclease important for the removal of RNA primers during Okazaki fragment maturation, by p300/CBP inhibits its DNA binding and nuclease activity (22Hasan S. Stucki M. Hassa P.O. Imhof R. Gehrig P. Hunziker P. Hubscher U. Hottiger M.O. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1221-1231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). p300 also binds and acetylates DNA polymerase b, which is involved in base excision repair (23Hasan S. El-Andaloussi N. Hardeland U. Hassa P.O. Burki C. Imhof R. Schar P. Hottiger M.O. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1213-1222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). p300/CBP is also in a complex with and acetylates thymine DNA glycosylase, the enzyme that recognizes and repairs mispaired thymine and uracil groups (24Tini M. Benecke A. Um S.J. Torchia J. Evans R.M. Chambon P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 265-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Further evidence that p300 plays a role during the response to DNA damage comes from the observation that acetylation of the RecQ helicase WRN by p300 facilitates the translocation of WRN protein from the nucleolus to nucleoplasmic foci (25Blander G. Zalle N. Daniely Y. Taplick J. Gray M.D. Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50934-50940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The WRN protein is critical for the resolution and restart of stalled DNA replication forks and after a replication block is phosphorylated by and colocalizes with ATR (26Pichierri P. Franchitto A. Bioessays. 2004; 26: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that p300/CBP plays an important role during DNA synthesis following DNA damage or stalled replication. In this report we show that p300/CBP associates with the replication checkpoint protein ATR in vivo, and loss of p300/CBP in mammalian cells results in a defect in the S-M phase checkpoint. Plasmids, Oligonucleotides, and siRNA—The pCDNA3 vectors expressing FLAG-tagged human p300 and murine Cbp were provided by Dr. James Lundblad. CS2+EGFPc was provided by Dr. Stan Hollenberg. The pCDNA3 vector expressing FLAG-tagged human p300 bearing wobble mutations at codons 129, 130, and 131 was generated using the QuikChange™ system (Stratagene) with primers 5′-CAAAAGCCCAATGACACAGGCTGGGTTAACTTCTCCCAACATG and 5′-CATGTTGGGAGAAGTTAACCCAGCCTGTGTCATTGGGCTTTTG. Construction of pH1tetO2, pH1tetO2p300, and p300 siRNA oligos was previously described (27Kuninger D. Stauffer D. Eftekhari S. Wilson E. Thayer M. Rotwein P. Hum. Gene Ther. 2004; 15: 1287-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). pH1tetO2CBP was constructed by annealing the 5′-phosphorylated oligos CTAGcctgaagtgaaagtagaagTTCAAGAGActtctactttcacttcaggTTTTTGGAAA and AGCTTTTCCAAAAAcctgaagtgaaagtagaagTCTCTTGAActtctactttcacttcagg containing human CBP-specific sequences and ligating into the XbaI-HindIII sites of pH1tetO2 to generate pH1tetO2CBP. All siRNA oligos were purchased from Qiagen. Oligos were constructed targeting Lamin A/C, 5′-CTGGACTTCCAGAAGAACA, and p53, 5′-GCAUGAACCGGAGGCCCAU. Selection of sequences for these siRNAs was based on guidelines on the Tuschl lab website. To stably knock down the expression of ATR and ATM, we used the BLOCK-iT Inducible H1 Lentiviral RNAi System™ (Invitrogen). Gene-specific inserts were cloned into pLenti4 and pLenti6 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The lentivirus was produced in HEK 293FT cells, and the virus-containing media was harvested for infection. The insert sequence for ATR stable siRNA expression was 5′-CACCGGCGTCGTCTCAGCTCGTCTTCAAGAGAGACGAGCTGAGACGACGCC. The insert sequence for ATM stable siRNA expressions was 5′-CACCGGATTTGCGTATTACTCAGTTCAAGAGACTGAGTAATACGCAAATCC. Cell Culture—TAT3 cells were provided by Dr. Merl Hoekstra. Monolayer cultures of HeLa SS6, HTD114, and TAT3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin and streptomycin. HEK 293FT cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 0.1 mm minimal essential medium non-essential amino acids, and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. Transfection of siRNA duplex oligos was carried out using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol for adherent cells. Plasmid DNA transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol for adherent cells. Determination of S Phase Checkpoint and G2 Timing—DNA synthesis was assessed by BrdUrd incorporation. Control and p300 siRNA-treated HeLa cells were incubated with 20 mg/ml BrdUrd. Every 30 min for 5 h, cells were fixed, dried, and denatured in 70% formamide, 2× SSC at 70 °C for 3 min. Cells were dehydrated by sequentially washing with 70, 90, and 100% ethanol for 3 min and then air dried. Cells were stained using an anti-BrdUrd antibody (BD Biosciences) at a dilution of 1:2.5. The anti-mouse fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody (Vector) was used at a dilution of 1:200. The cells were washed and stained with DAPI (12.5 mg/ml), coverslipped, and viewed under UV fluorescence on a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescent microscope. Replication checkpoint assays were conducted by the addition of 10 mm hydroxyurea or 10 mg/ml aphidicolin to untreated or siRNA-treated HeLa cultures. The mammalian cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 20 °C and blocked in PBS, 10% normal goat serum, 0.1% Triton, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for >1 h at 20 °C. Primary antibodies, anti-p300 RW128 monoclonal antibody (UBI, Lake Placid, NY), anti-CBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), diluted 1:1000, or anti-phospho-histone H3 (UBI), diluted 1:100, in blocking buffer were added for 16 h at 4 °C. After a washing step, cells were incubated for 2 h at 20°Cin goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse Cy3 (The Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA) diluted to 1:300 in blocking buffer. Plates were stained with DAPI (12.5 mg/ml), coverslipped, and viewed under UV fluorescence on a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescent microscope. Immunofluorescence, Immunoprecipitations, and Western Analysis—For immunofluorescence, monolayer cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min followed by permeabilization with PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h. Cells were blocked with PBS, 10% normal goat serum, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. After blocking, cells were incubated with a 1/100 dilution of either anti-p300 antibody (Oncogene) or anti-CBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 4 °C overnight. Cells were washed 3 times in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated for 2 h at 20 °Cin goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse Cy3 (The Jackson Laboratories) diluted to 1:300 in blocking buffer. Plates were stained with DAPI (12.5 mg/ml), coverslipped, and viewed under UV fluorescence on a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescent microscope., For immunoprecipitations, cell lysates with 200–300-μg total proteins were added to protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Co-immunoprecipitation of p300 and FLAG-ATR was performed using a mouse monoclonal p300 antibody (Oncogene) and protein A/G beads and incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG-ATR and p300 was performed using a mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) and protein A/G beads and incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous p300 and ATR was performed using a mouse monoclonal p300 antibody (Oncogene) and anti-mouse IgG beads (Sigma) or a rabbit polyclonal ATR antibody (Affinity Bioreagents) and protein A/G beads (Sigma), and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Beads were pelleted for 20 s at 4,000 rpm and washed two times with TENN (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Bound proteins were eluted by boiling and resolved on 8.5–10% SDS-PAGE. For Western analysis, cells were placed on ice, washed with cold PBS, scraped in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40) and protease inhibitor mixture Mini-Complete (Roche Applied Science), vigorously shaken 15 min at 4 °C, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and protein concentrations were determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Cell lysates (100 mg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Blots were blocked in Tris-buffered saline, 5% milk, 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with primary antibodies: anti-p300/CBP (number NA46; Oncogene, San Diego, CA), anti-p300 RW128 monoclonal antibody (UBI, Lake Placid, NY), anti-CBP, anti-Chk1, anti-Lamin A/C, anti-p53, and anti-PCNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-ATM (GeneTex Inc., San Antonio, TX), anti-ATR (Affinity Bioreagents Inc., Golden, CO), anti-phospho-Chk1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA), anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody and anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with signal development using ECF (Pierce). In Vitro Translations and Pulldowns—Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were prepared from bacteria by sonication in PBS containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Extracts were affinity purified by using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma), eluted with PBS containing 10 mm glutathione, and concentrated by a Centricon (Millipore). Protein concentrations were determined by the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). In vitro translated [35S]methionine (New England Nuclear)-labeled ATR and its mutants were prepared using Promega TnT kit. ATR and its mutants were incubated with GST affinity-purified fusion p300 proteins for 2 h at 4°C with constant agitation. After extensive washes with TENN buffer and RIPA buffer, bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. We previously used siRNA to deplete p300 from human tissue culture cells (27Kuninger D. Stauffer D. Eftekhari S. Wilson E. Thayer M. Rotwein P. Hum. Gene Ther. 2004; 15: 1287-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Interestingly, 72–120 h following p300 and CBP depletion, HeLa cells begin to exhibit aberrant mitotic structures (data not shown). Similarly, Drosophila Kc cells treated with siRNA directed against dCBP begin to die after 48 h of treatment, and appear to experience mitotic catastrophe (28Smolik S. Jones K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because mitotic catastrophe can result from a defect in the DNA replication checkpoint, we determined whether loss of p300/CBP function could similarly result in a deficiency in the cell cycle delay that can be induced by stalled DNA replication. For this analysis we depleted HeLa cells of p300/CBP using siRNA. Cells were treated with siRNAs for 3 days and subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies that can distinguish between CBP and p300. Fig. 1A shows that oligo 3 eliminates both p300 and CBP protein, without affecting expression of ATR. Western blot analysis of a time course of treatment with oligo 3 indicated that p300/CBP expression, using an antibody that detects both proteins, was reduced at all time points analyzed (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, depletion of p300/CBP from HeLa cells did not affect expression of the checkpoint proteins ATR, CHK1, or a control protein Lamin A/C (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the cells depleted of p300/CBP continue in the cell cycle, we assayed the frequency of S phase cells using BrdUrd incorporation, and the frequency of mitotic cells using staining with the anti-phospho-(Ser-10) H3 antibody. Fig. 1C shows that cells depleted of p300/CBP continue to cycle for at least 96 h following siRNA treatment without a significant drop in the frequency of cells in S phase or mitosis. In addition, to determine whether loss of p300/CBP affected the time between S phase and M phase, we measured the length of G2 in cells depleted of p300/CBP. For this analysis, we combined phospho-H3 staining with anti-BrdUrd staining at increasing times following the addition of BrdUrd. This analysis indicated that phospho-H3 and BrdUrd double positive cells were detected with similar kinetics following the addition of BrdUrd (Fig. 1D), indicating that depletion of p300/CBP did not alter the length of time that cells spend in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. However, mitotic catastrophes were observed in cells depleted of p300/CBP at the later time points (72–120 h; data not shown). Analyzing the cell cycle arrest induced by stalled DNA replication indicated that HeLa cells treated for 48 and 72 h of p300/CBP siRNA completely lacked the hydroxyurea-induced cell cycle arrest (Fig. 1E). In contrast, mock-treated cells retained the hydroxyurea-induced cell cycle arrest. A similar result was obtained with aphidicolin, a DNA polymerase inhibitor, indicating that the defect in the S-M phase checkpoint is not specific to hydroxyurea-induced stalled replication (Fig. 1F). Similar results were obtained with the human fibrosarcoma cell line HTD114 (supplemental Fig. S1). These results indicate that loss of p300/CBP results in a defect in the cell cycle arrest induced by stalled DNA replication. To determine whether the S-M phase checkpoint defect observed in cells depleted of CBP and p300 is specific to one or both, we carried out a series of experiments designed to knockout CBP or p300 individually, or to replace CBP or p300 in the siRNA (oligo 3)-treated cells. To determine whether depletion of CBP or p300 would result in a defect in the cell cycle arrest induced by stalled replication, we used transient transfection of small hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs expressing sequences that are specific to either p300 or CBP. To demonstrate the specificity of these hairpin vectors, we co-transfected a GFP expression vector to identify the transfected cells and stained the cultures with antibodies specific for p300 or CBP. Fig. 2A shows that the CBP vector depletes cells of CBP but not p300, and that the p300 vector depletes cells of p300 without affecting CBP. Scoring the GFP positive cells indicated that depletion of CBP or p300 alone does not result in a defect in the hydroxyurea-induced cell cycle arrest (Fig. 2B). However, cotransfection of both CBP and p300 shRNA vectors resulted in a defect in the hydroxyurea-induced cell cycle arrest, indicating that loss of both proteins is necessary to eliminate this cell cycle arrest. Next, to determine whether forced expression of CBP could rescue the checkpoint defect in p300/CBP-depleted cells, we introduced a murine Cbp expression vector, by transient transfection, at the same time we introduced the siRNA against p300/CBP. In addition, to replace p300 in cells depleted of p300/CBP, we generated a pseudo-wild type p300 mutant (pwp300). This p300 mutant contains 3 nucleotide changes at the wobble positions within the oligo 3 sequence. These changes do not alter the amino acid sequence but make the mRNA resistant to oligo 3. Fig. 2C shows Western blot analysis of cells transfected with oligo 3 plus expression vectors for murine Cbp, wild type p300, or pwp300. This analysis indicated that murine Cbp and pwp300 are resistant to oligo 3, but wild type p300 is sensitive to this siRNA. For the analysis of the hydroxyurea to induce cell cycle arrest in cells that received either Cbp or pwp300 we identified the transfected cells by co-transfection with a GFP expression vector. Scoring the GFP positive cells, and therefore the Cbp or pwp300 expressing cells, indicated that forced expression of either Cbp or pwp300 restored the hydroxyurea-induced cell cycle arrest (Fig. 2D). In addition, this analysis demonstrated that the loss of the replication checkpoint in oligo 3-treated cells is specific and is the result of depletion of p300 and CBP. We have demonstrated that p300/CBP is required for replication checkpoint function in mammalian cells. Although ATR has been shown to be required for replication checkpoint function in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila (8Hari K.L. Santerre A. Sekelsky J.J. McKim K.S. Boyd J.B. Hawley R.S.

Laurencon A. Hawley R. Theurkauf W.E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 302-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), surprisingly, an Atr knock-out did not effect the replication checkpoint function in mouse embryo fibroblasts exposed to hydroxyurea or aphidicolin, nor did Atr/Atm or Atr/p53 double knock-outs (31Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 615-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, following a block in DNA replication, p300 acetylates p53 resulting in stabilization and activation of p53 (32Nayak B.K. Das G.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7226-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p53 has been shown to play a role in the DNA replication checkpoint in mouse embryo fibroblasts (33Taylor W.R. Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Stacey D.W. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because it has been shown in mouse embryo fibroblasts that neither an Atr/Atm double knock-out nor an Atr/p53 double knock-out interferes with replication checkpoint integrity, we wished to determine whether an ATR, ATM, and p53 triple knockdown is a phenocopy of a p300/CBP knockdown. ATR and ATM have recently been stably knocked down in HeLa cells using ATR- and ATM-specific Lentivirus-expressed shRNAs (34Ariumi Y. Turelli P. Masutani M. Trono D. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 2973-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 35Zhang J. Bao S. Furumai R. Kucera K.S. Ali A. Dean N.M. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9910-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We constructed lentiviruses expressing ATR- and ATM-specific shRNAs, and after transduction of HeLa cells, individual clones were assayed for ATR and ATM levels by Western blot. Fig. 3A shows that in three separate clones, clone 1, clone 3, and clone 19, ATR levels were significantly reduced relative to an untransduced control. The same three clones showed nearly complete ablation of detectable ATM levels relative to an untransduced control, appearing similar to the ATM null cells TAT3 (Fig. 3B). Having stably knocked down ATR and ATM in three separate clones, clone 11 was transfected with siRNA oligos directed against p53. 48 h post-transfection, p53 levels were significantly reduced relative to untransfected clone 11 cells (Fig. 3C). Analyzing the cell cycle arrest induced by stalled DNA replication indicated that cells with an ATR, ATM, and p53 triple knockdown had a compromised hydroxyurea-induced cell cycle arrest (Fig. 3D). In contrast, control HeLa cells retained the hydroxyurea-induced cell cycle arrest. These results indicate that in HeLa cells, ATR, ATM, and p53 have some redundant functions in the replication checkpoint and that simultaneous knockdown of ATR, ATM, and p53 results in a phenotype similar to p300/CBP knockdown. In addition, ATM is also activated in response to replication blocks (36Ho C.C. Siu W.Y. Lau A. Chan W.M. Arooz T. Poon R.Y. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 2233-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and following knockdown of p300/CBP, HeLa cells exhibit a compromised G2/M DNA damage checkpoint (data not shown). This data suggests that several layers of redundancy may function in the mammalian DNA structure checkpoints and that are all dependent on p300/CBP functions. To begin to determine whether p300/CBP plays a direct role during the replication checkpoint, we tested whether a p300-ATR interaction could be detected in vitro and in vivo. First, we used co-immunoprecipitation from cells transfected with p300 and ATR. Fig. 4A shows that full-length ATR, and an ATR deletion mutant ATR-(2–1127), are able to coimmunoprecipitate p300. In addition, using an anti-p300 antibody, we detected coimmunoprecipitation of ATR and ATR-(2–1127) (Fig. 4B). Because the kinase domain of ATR resides in the C terminus and is deleted in the ATR-(2–1127) mutant, these observations indicate that the kinase domain of ATR is not required for the p300 interaction. We next used a GST pull-down assay to determine which domain of ATR interacts with which domain of p300. For this analysis, we assayed a series of GST-p300 fusion constructs (Fig. 4C) for interactions with in vitro translated ATR and ATR mutant proteins. Fig. 4D shows that full-length ATR interacts with the fusion proteins containing amino acids 19–596 and 963–1302, which contain the first and second Cys/His domains of p300, respectively (19Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the C-terminal truncation mutant, ATR-(2–1127), interacts with the same two GST-p300 proteins, indicating that the kinase domain of ATR is dispensable for this interaction. Furthermore, a second C-terminal truncation mutant, ATR-(2–264), containing the NH2-terminal 264 amino acids, interacts only with the GST-(963–1302) protein. These observations suggest that two different NH2-terminal domains of ATR interact with two different domains of p300. Finally, to determine whether a p300-ATR interaction could be detected with endogenous proteins, and to determine whether stalled DNA replication affected the p300-ATR interaction, we analyzed the p300-ATR interaction using coimmunoprecipitation of proteins from cells treated with hydroxyurea. Fig. 4E shows that complexes containing p300 and ATR could be detected using immunoprecipitation with an anti-p300 antibody. In addition, we detected an increase in the amount of coimmunoprecipitated ATR when the cells were exposed to hydroxyurea (Fig. 4E). These observations"
https://openalex.org/W2022264031,"We have shown previously that phosphoinositide 3-kinase in the retina is activated in vivo through light-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR). The light effect is localized to photoreceptor neurons and is independent of insulin secretion (Rajala, R. V., McClellan, M. E., Ash, J. D., and Anderson, R. E. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 43319–43326). These results suggest that there exists a cross-talk between phototransduction and other signal transduction pathways. In this study, we examined the stage of phototransduction that is coupled to the activation of the IR. We studied IR phosphorylation in mice lacking the rod-specific α-subunit of transducin to determine if phototransduction events are required for IR activation. To confirm that light-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the IR is signaled through bleachable rhodopsin, we examined IR activation in retinas from RPE65-/- mice that are deficient in opsin chromophore. We observed that IR phosphorylation requires the photobleaching of rhodopsin but not transducin signaling. To determine whether the light-dependent activation of IR is mediated through the rod or cone transduction pathway, we studied the IR activation in mice lacking opsin, a mouse model of pure cone function. No light-dependent activation of the IR was found in the retinas of these mice. We provide evidence for the existence of a light-mediated IR pathway in the retina that is different from the known insulin-mediated pathway in nonneuronal tissues. These results suggest that IR phosphorylation in rod photoreceptors is signaled through the G-protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin. This is the first study demonstrating that rhodopsin can initiate signaling pathway(s) in addition to its classical phototransduction."
https://openalex.org/W2084299666,"Double strand break (DSB) recognition is the first step in the DSB damage response and involves activation of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and phosphorylation of targets such as p53 to trigger cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis. It was reported that activation of ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase by DSBs also occurs in an ATM-dependent manner. On the other hand, Ku70/80 is known to participate at a later time point in the DSB response, recruiting DNA-PKcs to facilitate non-homologous end joining. Because Ku70/80 has a high affinity for broken DNA ends and is abundant in nuclei, we examined their possible involvement in other aspects of the DSB damage response, particularly in modulating the activity of ATM and other phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-related kinases during DSB recognition. We thus analyzed p53Ser18 phosphorylation in irradiated Ku-deficient cells and observed persistent phosphorylation in these cells relative to wild type cells. ATM or ATR inhibition revealed that this phosphorylation is mainly mediated by ATM-dependent ATR activity at 2 h post-ionizing radiation in wild type cells, whereas in Ku-deficient cells, this occurs mainly through direct ATM activity, with a secondary contribution from ATR via a novel ATM-independent mechanism. Using ATM/Ku70 double-null cell lines, which we generated, we confirmed that ATM-independent ATR activity contributed to persistent phosphorylation of p53Ser18 in Ku-deficient cells at 12 h post-ionizing radiation. In summary, we discovered a novel role for Ku70/80 in modulating ATM-dependent ATR activation during DSB damage response and demonstrated that these proteins confer a protective effect against ATM-independent ATR activation at later stages of the DSB damage response. Double strand break (DSB) recognition is the first step in the DSB damage response and involves activation of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and phosphorylation of targets such as p53 to trigger cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis.

We thus analyzed p53Ser18 phosphorylation in irradiated Ku-deficient cells and observed persistent phosphorylation in these cells relative to wild type cells. ATM or ATR inhibition revealed that this phosphorylation is mainly mediated by ATM-dependent ATR activity at 2 h post-ionizing radiation in wild type cells, whereas in Ku-deficient cells, this occurs mainly through direct ATM activity, with a secondary contribution from ATR via a novel ATM-independent mechanism. Using ATM/Ku70 double-null cell lines, which we generated, we confirmed that ATM-independent ATR activity contributed to persistent phosphorylation of p53Ser18 in Ku-deficient cells at 12 h post-ionizing radiation. In summary, we discovered a novel role for Ku70/80 in modulating ATM-dependent ATR activation during DSB damage response and demonstrated that these proteins confer a protective effect against ATM-independent ATR activation at later stages of the DSB damage response. The genome of eukaryotic cells are exposed to a variety of DNA-damaging agents, such as ionizing radiation (IR), 4The abbreviations used are: IR, ionizing radiation; PI, phosphatidylinositol; DSB, double strand break; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated; ATR, ATM- and Rad3-related; Gy, gray; siRNA, small interfering RNA.

DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The fallibility of the DNA replication machinery may also result in inaccurately replicated DNA and stalled replication forks that may eventually induce DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) (1Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). The cell's first option is to halt the cell cycle and repair the damage. Should such efforts fail, permanent cell cycle arrest (senescence), apoptosis, or other forms of cell death will occur. Failure of these processes result in the perpetuation of cells with altered DNA and possibly carcinogenesis (3Bernstein C. Bernstein H. Payne C.M. Garewal H. Mutat. Res. 2002; 511: 145-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 4Thompson L.H. Schild D. Mutat. Res. 2002; 509: 49-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The most widely accepted model for the DSB damage response puts the MRN (Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1) complex at the top of the pathway as the earliest proteins to be recruited at the sites of DNA damage (5Khanna K.K.

This complex then recruits the PI 3-related kinase member, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase, to the damaged DNA ends (7Carson C.T. Schwartz R.A. Stracker T.H. Lilley C.E. Lee D.V.

This enables the activated kinase to phosphorylate its protein targets, such as p53, Chk1, Chk2, Brca1, and NBS1, thereby triggering signal transduction cascades that initiate cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (8Niida H. Nakanishi M. Mutagenesis. 2006; 21: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 10Kurz E.U. Lees-Miller S.P. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 889-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). It has been shown that in the absence of ATM, phosphorylation of these proteins is diminished or delayed; the residual phosphorylation is thought to be mediated by the ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase, which is another member of the PI 3-related kinase family (11Wang X. Khadpe J. Hu B. Iliakis G. Wang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30869-30874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It has recently been revealed that the activation of ATR by DSBs is also ATM-dependent (12Adams K.E. Medhurst A.L. Dart D.A. Lakin N.D.

Current knowledge assigns a role for the Ku70/80 heterodimer in the later stages of the DNA damage response, particularly in one of the two processes for DSB repair, non-homologous end joining (16Blier P.R.

Rev. 2004; 200: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In this process, the Ku70/80 heterodimer binds to the free DNA ends at a DSB and recruits the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs), the third member of the PI 3-related kinase family. The formation of the DNA-PK complex at the site of the DSBs results in the recruitment and phosphorylation of XRCC4, DNA Ligase IV, Cernunnos/XLF, and Artemis to ligate the broken DNA ends (18Buck D.

Because Ku70/80 possess a high affinity for DNA broken ends and is highly abundant in the nucleus, we were interested in determining whether these proteins might also influence the signaling aspects of the DNA damage response, particularly the activation of ATM and other PI 3-related kinases during initial DSB recognition. To explore this possibility, we performed PI 3-kinase inhibition in Ku70- and Ku80-deficient cells and then examined the phosphorylation of p53Ser18 following irradiation. Furthermore, we successfully established Ku70 and ATM double deficient cells and used these cells to analyze the possible relationship of the Ku70/80 heterodimer with ATM and ATR signaling in the early stages of the DSB response. Our findings suggest a novel role for the Ku70/80 heterodimer in the early stages of the DNA damage response, particularly in modulating ATM-dependent ATR activation in response to DSB damage. Moreover, we have proven the existence of an ATM-independent mechanism for ATR activation following DSB damage in Ku-deficient cells.

These cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% calf serum supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were grown to ∼70–90% confluence in 12-well plates and were irradiated with X-rays at the rate of 1.0 Gy/min (150 kV, 5 mA) (MBR-1505R2, Hitachi Medico, Japan) to achieve a cumulative dose of 8 Gy for all experiments unless otherwise mentioned. PI 3-related Kinase Inhibition Experiments—Cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of wortmannin (Sigma), caffeine (Kanto Chemical), or KU55933 for 1 h and then treated with 8 Gy of IR. After 2 and 12 h, cell extracts were prepared for Western blotting. Wortmannin and KU55933 were dissolved in Me2SO at 10 and 1 mm, respectively, as a stock solution. Caffeine was dissolved in water at a concentration of 100 mm. Protein Extraction and Western Blotting—Western blotting experiments were performed using whole cell extracts following standard techniques. Cells were resuspended and lysed in 1× SDS buffer (67.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 25 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 12.5% glycerol, 2.5% SDS, and 100 mm dithiothreitol). Lysates were boiled for 2 min and sonicated. For Western blotting, cell extracts were electrophoresed on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels to detect medium-sized proteins or low-bis 8% SDS-acrylamide gels for high molecular weight proteins. Proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (GE Healthcare). Membranes were incubated in TBS-T (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 0.1% Tween 20) and 5% skim milk (Snow Brand) added to TBS-T. Membranes were then stained with Ponceau S dye to check for equal loading and homogeneous transfer. Primary antibodies used in this study were Ku70 (C-19, M-19), ATM (2C1), ATR (M-19) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-p53Ser18 (Cell Signaling Technology) and α-tubulin (ICN). Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were obtained from GE Healthcare, and an anti-goat antibody was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Proteins were visualized using ECL Western blotting detection systems (GE Healthcare). After probing with the phosphospecific antibodies, immunoblots were stripped and reprobed with tubulin to check for equal loading. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfections—All siRNA transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Approximately 0.3–0.6 × 105 cells/well were seeded in 12-well plates with 1 ml of antibiotic-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% calf serum. The next day, the cells were treated with Lipofectamine 2000 and 20 pmol of control, ATR, or ATM siRNA (Qiagen) (siRNA sequences available upon request). After 24 h, this procedure was repeated. The cells were analyzed 48 h after the last siRNA transfection. Selective Targeting of Ku70—We initially generated a tetracycline-inducible Ku70 conditional allele (supplemental Fig. 2a). Ku70 sequences were either directly derived or amplified from genomic DNA obtained from CJ7 embryonic stem cells or a cosmid clone carrying the Ku70 locus. The 5′ end of the targeting vector consisted of a 1.2-kb region possessing homology to intron 1 and was generated by high fidelity PCR (26Ouyang H. Nussenzweig A. Kurimasa A. Soares V.C. Li X. Cordon-Cardo C. Li W. Cheong N. Nussenzweig M. Iliakis G. Chen D.J. Li G.C. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The early part of exon 2 containing the untranslated region (referred to as exon 2x) was fused to the tetracycline transactivator gene tTA having a terminal codon and poly(A) sequence. The later half of exon 2 (referred to as exon 2y) beginning from the ATG start site of Ku70 was placed under the control of the tetracycline-responsive promoter (tetracycline-responsive element). A pair of LoxP sites flanked this TRE-exon 2y sequence. A phosphoglycerate kinase-driven neomycin selection marker was positioned between the first loxP site and the TRE-2y region. The 3′ arm of the targeting vector consisted of a 7.7-kb EcoRI fragment derived from the region spanning introns 2–5. Generation of Ku70-conditional Knock-out Mice—A correctly targeted embryonic stem cell clone, confirmed by Southern blot analysis, was injected into 3.5-day-postcoitus C57BL/6J blastocysts. Approximately 10 embryonic stem cells were injected per blastocyst, and twenty blastocysts were transferred to each pseudopregnant recipient. The resulting chimeric offspring were crossed with 40 mice to generate F1 progeny. To generate ATM-deficient/Ku70-conditional mice, we crossed Ku70 heterozygotes with ATM heterozygotes (25Barlow C. Hirotsune S. Paylor R. Liyanage M. Eckhaus M. Collins F. Shiloh Y. Crawley J.N. Ried T. Tagle D. Wynshaw-Boris A. Cell. 1996; 86: 159-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). The resulting Ku70/ATM double heterozygotes were crossed with each other. Progeny that had an ATM–/– Ku702Loxp/2LoxP genotype were identified by PCR screening. Primary fibroblast cells were obtained from one of the ATM homozygous null Ku70 homozygous conditional (ATM–/– Ku702LoxP/2LoxP) mice, D14-3, and further cultured to obtain a spontaneously transformed cell line. Generation of ATM and Ku70 Double Deficient Cell Lines—To generate the Ku70-null allele, spontaneously transformed D14-3 fibroblasts were infected with a Cre recombinase-expressing adenovirus vector (AxCANCre, obtained from RIKEN Bioresource Center) to achieve excision of the PGK-neo cassette and exon 2y, which contained the Ku70 start codon. Infection was performed on monolayers of fibroblast cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% calf serum and 10% PEG6000 at 80 multiplicity of infection (27Ohsawa T. Nakamura T. Mihara M. Sato K. J. Dermatol. 2000; 27: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). ATM and Ku70 expression was confirmed by Western blotting (supplemental Fig. 2b). After transient Cre expression, Ku70 protein levels progressively decreased and were undetectable 3 days after transfection. Two independently isolated floxed clones, D14-3Fx1 and D14-3Fx2, were expanded and used in this study. Prolonged Phosphorylation of p53Ser18 in Ku-deficient Cells—The most well known ATM and ATR substrate is the tumor suppressor protein p53 (28Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L.

This protein plays a major role in cellular responses to DNA damage and other genomic aberrations (30Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar). Activation of p53 leads to either cell cycle arrest to allow DNA repair or apoptosis. DSBs induce ATM-dependent phosphorylation of p53Ser18, and this results in reduced interaction of p53 with its negative regulator, oncoprotein MDM2 (31Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the Ku70/80 status of a cell might influence DNA damage signaling, we examined p53Ser18 phosphorylation and response to IR over a time course. We utilized four fibroblast cell lines, PK34N (wild type) and three other cell lines that were null mutants for components of the DNA-PK complex, namely PK33N (DNA-PKcs–/–) (23Kurimasa A. Ouyang H.

Nussenzweig M.C. Li G.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Cells were either mock-treated or subjected to 8 Gy of IR and harvested at the indicated time points. Processed samples were analyzed for p53Ser18 phosphorylation by Western blotting, with tubulin as a loading control (Fig. 1). Ku70-deficient mice exhibit decreased levels of Ku80, whereas Ku80-deficient mice show decreased levels of Ku70, revealing the functional synergy of these proteins (24Nussenzweig A. Chen C. da Costa Soares V. Sanchez M. Sokol K. Nussenzweig M.C. Li G.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that Ku70- and Ku80-deficient cells have similar phenotypes. Thus, when discussed together, we shall collectively refer to these three cell lines as Ku-deficient cells. In wild type cells and DNA-PKcs-deficient cells, phosphorylation of p53Ser18 was transient and reached maximum levels 2 h after irradiation. At 8 h post-IR, phosphorylation levels dropped significantly, with p53Ser18 levels returning to background levels at 12 h post-IR. On the other hand, phosphorylation of p53Ser18 was persistent, with minimal change within the 16-h time period after IR for both Ku80- and Ku70-deficient cells. Our results indicate that loss of DNA-PKcs does not result in aberrant p53Ser18 phosphorylation. However, loss of Ku results in persistent p53 phosphorylation. In the absence of Ku, further loss of DNA-PKcs function does not enhance the persistent p53Ser18 phosphorylation. Relative Contribution of ATM and ATR Kinases to p53Ser18 Phosphorylation in Ku-deficient Cells—Following DSB damage, ATM is activated to phosphorylate target proteins such as p53Ser18. It is currently thought that activation of ATR following DSB damage requires ATM activity (ATM-dependent ATR activation) (12Adams K.E. Medhurst A.L. Dart D.A. Lakin N.D. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3894-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 13Cuadrado M. Martinez-Pastor B. Murga M. Toledo L.I. Gutierrez-Martinez P. Lopez E. Fernandez-Capetillo O. J. Exp.

Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). To determine whether ATM and/or ATR kinase(s) were involved in the persistent phosphorylation of p53Ser18 in Ku-deficient cells, we first performed knockdown experiments using siRNAs. PK34N, STEFKu70, PK/80-1A, and PK/80–193A cells were individually transfected with siRNAs against ATR (ATR1 or ATR3) or ATM (ATM1). As shown in Fig. 2, in wild type PK34N cells, ATR knockdown resulted in loss of p53Ser18 phosphorylation, indicating that ATR activity significantly contributes to the phosphorylation of p53Ser18. Moreover, although ATR activity remained intact in these cells, knockdown of ATM completely abolished p53Ser18 phosphorylation at 2 h post-IR. These results demonstrate that ATR is activated under the control of ATM; that is, in the absence of functional ATM, ATR is unable to rescue p53Ser18 phosphorylation. These findings agree with the ATM-dependent ATR activation model for DSB damage response, wherein activation of ATR by ATM is required for ATR to phosphorylate its targets (13Cuadrado M. Martinez-Pastor B. Murga M. Toledo L.I. Gutierrez-Martinez P. Lopez E. Fernandez-Capetillo O. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 15Myers J.S. Cortez D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9346-9350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that, in the earlier stages (2 h) of the DSB damage response, phosphorylation of p53Ser18 is predominantly mediated by ATM-dependent ATR kinase activity. At 12 h post-IR, PK34N cells treated with either ATR or ATM siRNA exhibited basal phosphorylation levels of p53Ser18 comparable with those of cells treated with control siRNA. Interestingly, in Ku-deficient cells, knockdown of ATR did not significantly decrease p53Ser18 phosphorylation at 2 h post-IR. On the other hand, ATM knockdown resulted in a substantial reduction in p53Ser18 phosphorylation. These results suggest that, in the absence of Ku70/80, ATM contributes significantly to p53Ser18 phosphorylation. Nevertheless, ATR participates in p53Ser18 phosphorylation to a minor extent. In contrast to the predominance of ATM-dependent ATR activity observed in wild type cells, contribution of this mechanism in p53Ser18 phosphorylation is minimal in Ku-deficient cells. The involvement of DNA-PKcs in phosphorylation of p53Ser18 could be excluded, because phosphorylation of p53Ser18 was still observable in the Ku80/DNA-PKcs double deficient cells (PK/80–193A). This leads us to the question as to what kinase phosphorylates p53Ser18 in the absence of ATM activity. With these results, we are led to conclude that residual p53Ser18 phosphorylation after ATM knockdown is mediated by ATR through an ATM-independent mechanism. As expected, p53Ser18 phosphorylation was no longer visible at the 12-h time point in wild type cells. The non-responsiveness of p53Ser18 phosphorylation to ATM or ATR siRNA treatment reflects the return of ATM and ATR activity to basal levels at the later stage of the DSB response. For the PK/80-1A cell line, p53Ser18 phosphorylation patterns in response to ATR or ATM siRNA treatment were similar to those observed at 2 h post-IR. In the case of STEFKu70 and PK/80–193A cell lines, ATR or ATM siRNA treatment resulted in a slight reduction of p53Ser18 phosphorylation levels. This suggests the involvement of ATM in p53Ser18 phosphorylation and at the same time, an increase in the contribution of ATR in this phosphorylation. From these findings, we conclude that the persistent activation of p53Ser18 in Ku-deficient cells is mediated by aberrant activation of ATR via an ATM-independent mechanism. To confirm these results, we subjected cells to various inhibitors of PI 3-related kinases. Wortmannin inhibits PI 3-kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Low concentrations mainly suppress ATM and DNA-PKcs, whereas higher concentrations are required for ATR inhibition (32Powis G. Bonjouklian R. Berggren M.M. Gallegos A. Abraham R. Ashendel C. Zalkow L. Matter W.F. Dodge J. Grindey G. Vlahos J.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2419-2423PubMed Google Scholar, 33Sarkaria J.N. Tibbetts R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T.

In wild type cells, phosphorylation of p53Ser18 at 2 h post-IR was strongly suppressed by 10 μm Wortmannin (Fig. 3a). In agreement with the results from our previous siRNA experiments, inhibition of ATM in wild type PK34N cells completely abolished p53Ser18 phosphorylation at 2 h post-IR. Again, we have demonstrated that p53Ser18 phosphorylation is mainly mediated by direct ATM activity or through a two-step ATM-dependent process involving ATR. At the same time point, in Ku-deficient cells, some p53Ser18 phosphorylation was still observed at low Wortmannin concentrations that selectively inhibit ATM, suggesting that residual p53 phosphorylation is attributed to ATM-independent ATR activity. Complete suppression of this phosphorylation was achieved at higher concentrations known to inhibit ATR activity. In Ku-deficient cells, at 12 h post-IR, the persistent phosphorylation of p53Ser18 was difficult to suppress at low concentrations of Wortmannin. These results are consistent with our previous findings and suggest that p53Ser18 phosphorylation is primarily mediated by ATM kinase activity, with a minor contribution from ATM-independent ATR activity. Our siRNA results point to the existence of ATM-independent ATR activity in both the earlier and later stages of the DSB response in Ku-deficient cells. To confirm this, we also treated cells with KU55933, a potent and specific inhibitor of ATM (IC50 for ATM was 12.9 nm, whereas IC50 for ATR was >100 μm) (35Hickson I. Zhao Y. Richardson C.J.

Taylor D.L. Jackson S.P. Smith G.C. O'Connor M.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3b). At the 2-h time point, phosphorylation in wild type cells was significantly reduced by treatment with 1 μm KU55933. On the other hand, the phosphorylation in Ku-deficient cells was more resistant to KU55933 until concentrations of up to 10 μm. At 12 h post-IR, p53Ser18 phosphorylation was no longer observable in wild type cells. The 2- and 12-h time points exhibited similar patterns of reductions in p53Ser18 phosphorylation in Ku-deficient cells. Similar to the siRNA and Wortmannin experiments, we observed residual p53Ser18 phosphorylation even after ATM-specific inhibition. This remaining p53Ser18 phosphorylation could only reflect ATR activity that occurs independently of ATM, thus supporting the existence of ATM-independent ATR activity in Ku-deficient cells. We also performed caffeine treatment at concentrations that inhibited both ATM and ATR activity (37Cortez D. J. Biol.

Wild type cells at 2 h post-IR and Ku-deficient cells at 2 and 12 h post-IR exhibited similar patterns of decrease in p53Ser18 phosphorylation. To summarize, we have demonstrated that, (1Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar) in wild type cells at the earlier stages of the DSB damage response, phosphorylation of p53Ser18 is predominantly mediated by ATM-dependent ATR activity"
https://openalex.org/W2035747081,"Changes in local chromatin structure accompany transcriptional activation of eukaryotic genes. In vivo these changes in chromatin organization can be catalyzed by ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes, such as SWI/SNF. These complexes alter the tight wrapping of DNA in the nucleosomes and can facilitate the mobilization of the histone octamer to adjacent DNA segments, leaving promoter regulatory elements exposed for transcription factor binding. To gain understanding of how the activity of SWI/SNF complexes may be modulated by the different DNA sequences within a natural promoter, we have reconstituted nucleosomes containing promoter segments of the transcriptionally active cell type-specific osteocalcin (OC) gene and determined how they affect the directional movements of the nucleosomes. Our results indicate that SWI/SNF complexes induce octamer sliding to preferential positions in the OC promoter, leading to a nucleosomal organization that resembles that described in intact cells expressing the OC gene. Our studies demonstrate that the position of the histone octamer is primarily determined by sequences within the OC promoter that include or exclude nucleosomes. We propose that these sequences are critical components of the regulatory mechanisms that mediate expression of this tissue-specific gene.

We propose that these sequences are critical components of the regulatory mechanisms that mediate expression of this tissue-specific gene. Within the eukaryotic nucleus the DNA is organized as a highly structured nucleoprotein complex named chromatin. The nucleosome, the fundamental unit of chromatin, is formed by the association of a DNA segment of 147 bp around a histone octamer composed of two of each histone H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (1Richmond T. Dadey L. Nature. 2003; 423: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 2Ramakrishman V. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 83-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The packaging of DNA sequences in nucleosomes and higher order chromatin structures has been implicated in the regulation of key events in eukaryotic cells such as replication and transcription (3Narlikar G. Fan H. Kingston R. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar, 4Neely K. Workman J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1603: 19-29PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of nucleosomes is generally considered to block accessibility of most transcription factors to their cognate binding sequences. Moreover, gene activity is often accompanied by perturbations in the nucleosomal array, as evidenced by increased nuclease hypersensitivity of specific promoter and enhancer elements (3Narlikar G. Fan H. Kingston R. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar, 4Neely K. Workman J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1603: 19-29PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple studies have established that there are intrinsic differences in the nucleosome binding capacity of different transcription factors. Although many factors cannot bind when their sites are assembled into nucleosomes, others can specifically recognize and interact with nucleosome-engaged binding sequences (3Narlikar G. Fan H. Kingston R. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar, 4Neely K. Workman J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1603: 19-29PubMed Google Scholar), although with different degrees of affinity. Studies based on nucleosome reconstitution assays in vitro have established the existence of DNA sequences that possess higher capacity to be organized as nucleosomal particles. The first segment reported to have this property was a region from the 5 S rRNA gene of sea urchin (5Simpson R. Stafford D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), which has become the standard for “nucleosome positioning” sequences. To date, no specific pattern can be associated with the ability to position nucleosomes. However, it appears that these sequences may exhibit certain parameters, such as the presence of AA duplets or AAA triplets, or CTG triplets every 10 or 11 bp (6Thastrom A. Lowary P. Widlund H. Cao H. Kubista M. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 213-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 7Kiyama R. Trifonov E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there have also been reports suggesting the existence of “nucleosome-excluding” sequences, which include short repeats of adenine (A16) (8Anderson J. Widom J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3830-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), long CCG triplet repeats (9Wang Y. Gellibolian R. Shimizu M. Wells R. Griffith J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), TGGA repeats (10Cao H. Windlund H. Simonsson T. Kubista M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), or the [(G/C)3NN]n motif (11Wang Y. Griffith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8863-8867Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These nucleosome-excluding sequences may lead to nucleosome-free promoter domains that could allow preferential access for transcription factors to their cognate elements. During the last decade, a large family of protein complexes that function to promote transcription by altering chromatin structure have been described (3Narlikar G. Fan H. Kingston R. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar, 4Neely K. Workman J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1603: 19-29PubMed Google Scholar, 12Becker P. Horz W.

Among them is the SWI/SNF complex subfamily, which remodels chromatin in an ATP-dependent manner (3Narlikar G. Fan H. Kingston R. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar, 4Neely K. Workman J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1603: 19-29PubMed Google Scholar, 12Becker P. Horz W.

One feature of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers is their ability to mobilize nucleosomes. Repositioning of histone octamers may occur along the same DNA segment by sliding (14Hamiche A. Sandaltzopoulos R. Gdula G. Wu C. Cell. 1999; 97: 833-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 15Langst G. Bonte E. Corona D. Becker P.

Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 6380-6389Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which the SWI/SNF complexes alter chromatin structure has not been definitively established; however, it has been proposed that they can bind to the linker region and push the DNA toward the nucleosome to slide the histone octamer (3Narlikar G. Fan H. Kingston R. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar, 12Becker P. Horz W. Annu. Rev.

Osteoblast-specific transcription of the rat osteocalcin (OC) 2The abbreviations used are: OC, osteocalcin; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; nt, nucleotide(s); TPCK, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; ROSF, partially purified SWI/SNF complex from ROS 17/2.8 cells. 2The abbreviations used are: OC, osteocalcin; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; nt, nucleotide(s); TPCK, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; ROSF, partially purified SWI/SNF complex from ROS 17/2.8 cells. gene is controlled by a series of modularly distributed basal and hormone-responsive promoter regulatory elements located within two DNase I-hypersensitive sites (–600 to –400 and –170 to –70) (18Montecino M. Lian J. Stein G. Stein J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5093-5102Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The DNA segment between these two hypersensitive sites is organized as a nucleosome. The translational position of this nucleosome might reflect specific protein-DNA interactions occurring in the proximal promoter region that account for both formation of the proximal hypersensitive site and OC gene transcriptional activity (18Montecino M. Lian J. Stein G. Stein J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5093-5102Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19Montecino M. Frenkel B. Lian J. Stein J. Stein G. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 1316-1323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the specific location of this nucleosome might be the result of nucleosome-positioning sequences at this region of the OC promoter (21Gutierrez J. Sierra J. Medina R. Puchi M. Imschenetzky M. van Wijnen A. Lian J. Stein G. Stein J. Montecino M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13565-13574Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To gain understanding about the basis for specific nucleosome positioning at the active OC gene promoter, we have characterized nucleosomes reconstituted using segments of this promoter. We find that SWI/SNF activity produces preferential histone octamer sliding to positions that resemble those found in intact osteoblastic cells expressing the OC gene. This preferential octamer location is determined by specific sequences within the proximal OC promoter region that include or exclude nucleosomes. DNA Segments From the Rat OC Gene Promoter—DNA fragments from the rat OC gene promoter containing the sequences –500 to –270, –500 to –87, –500 to –355, –451 to –306, –441 to –206, –380 to –145, –351 to –206, –351 to –116, –287 to –57, –257 to –106, –207 to –56, and –161 to –10 were generated by PCR using specific primers, one of which had been previously end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), as previously described (21Gutierrez J. Sierra J. Medina R. Puchi M. Imschenetzky M. van Wijnen A. Lian J. Stein G. Stein J. Montecino M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13565-13574Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To map nucleosome positions, labeled DNA fragments were obtained by PCR using specific primers and including [α-32P]dATP in the reaction mix as described before (21Gutierrez J. Sierra J. Medina R. Puchi M. Imschenetzky M. van Wijnen A. Lian J. Stein G. Stein J. Montecino M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13565-13574Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Nucleosome Reconstitution—Nucleosome reconstitutions were carried out by the histone octamer transfer method as previously described (21Gutierrez J. Sierra J. Medina R. Puchi M. Imschenetzky M. van Wijnen A. Lian J. Stein G. Stein J. Montecino M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13565-13574Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Donor oligonucleosomes were obtained as described previously (21Gutierrez J. Sierra J. Medina R. Puchi M. Imschenetzky M. van Wijnen A. Lian J. Stein G. Stein J. Montecino M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13565-13574Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To map nucleosome positions, 2 pmol of labeled DNA fragments and 6 μg of oligonucleosomes isolated from chicken red blood cells were used. In all the other reconstitution experiments, 1 pmol of acceptor DNA and 3 μg of oligonucleosomes were used. After reconstitution, the final composition of the nucleosome-containing buffer was 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. Electrophoretic Analysis and Isolation of Nucleosome Populations—Following reconstitution, the nucleosomes were analyzed by electrophoresis in non-denaturing 5% polyacrylamide (40:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio) gels and 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 45 mm Boric Acid, 1 mm EDTA), at 4 °C and 200 V. Gels were dried, and the nucleosome pattern as well as the efficiency of reconstitution were monitored using a Molecular Imager FX phosphorimaging device (Bio-Rad). Alternatively, the dried gels were exposed to Kodak X-OMAT films at –80 °C. The nucleosome populations obtained after the reconstitution were isolated and purified following protocols described by Studitsky et al. (22Studitsky V. Clark D. Felsenfeld G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 246-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, the different samples were concentrated up to 5-fold using centricon-10 tubes (Amicon) and fractionated in non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Bands corresponding to naked DNA, lateral, and central nucleosome populations were cut from the wet gels and extracted with elution buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) by agitation overnight. Tubes were centrifuged 1 min at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge to decant gel pieces. The supernatant containing the nucleosomes was transferred to clean microtubes, and 0.25 volumes of elution buffer, including 50% glycerol and 0.25% Nonidet P-40, were immediately added. The samples were stored at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks until use. Mapping of Nucleosome Positions—The purified nucleosome populations were subjected to micrococcal nuclease digestion for 5 min at 37 °C. The concentration of micrococcal nuclease used ranged from 0.1 to 1 unit/μl, depending on the particular nucleosome population and was determined by previous titration. The digested DNA products were purified and fractionated by electrophoresis in a 12% polyacrylamide gel (0.5× TBE) at 200 V. The ∼146-bp micrococcal nuclease-resistant band was detected by direct autoradiography, cut from the gel, and purified. The mapping of the nuclease-resistant fragment was then assessed by digestion with restriction enzymes. The enzymes chosen in each analysis varied according to the DNA segment and are explained in the corresponding Fig. legend. The digestion products were visualized by electrophoresis in a sequencing gel and autoradiography. Isolation of Nucleosome Remodeling Activity from Osteoblastic Cells—A partially purified nucleosome remodeling complex analogous to hSWI/SNF and free of ISWI-containing complexes (see results shown in Fig. 5), was obtained according to a method described previously (23Imbalzano A. Kwon H. Green M. Kingston R. Nature. 1994; 370: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 24Kwon H. Imbalzano A. Khavari P. Kingston R. Green M. Nature. 1994; 370: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 25Wang W. Cote J. Xue Y. Zhou S. Kahvari P. Biggar S. Muchardt C. Kalpana G. Goff S. Yaniv M. Workman J. Crabtree G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5370-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from ROS 17/2.8 (rat osteosarcoma) cells were obtained as described (26Dignam J. Lebovitz R. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar), except that buffer C contained 0.6 m KCl instead of 0.42 m. Nuclear extracts were dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.5 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, until KCl concentration reached 125 mm. Glycerol was added to the samples up to a final concentration of 20% (leaving KCl at a final concentration of 100 mm). The nuclear extract samples were then frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at –80 °C until use. Prior to the first chromatographic step, nuclear extracts were centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rpm. The supernatant was loaded on a phosphocellulose column and eluted with buffer A (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 7 μg/ml TPCK, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and increasing concentrations of KCl (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.8 m). The protein concentration in each chromatographic fraction was determined by Bradford's method, and the peak at 0.5 m KCl was collected, dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.1 m KCl, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 10% glycerol), and loaded onto a ssDNA column (Sigma). The sample was eluted using buffer B (also including a proteinase inhibitors mixture) with increasing concentrations of KCl (0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 m). The fractions were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Enrichment in SWI/SNF complexes was monitored by analyzing aliquots from the different fractions by Western blot using antibodies against BRG-1 and by evaluating the presence of nucleosome remodeling activity. Nucleosome Remodeling Reactions—The nucleosome remodeling assays were performed in 15 μl of remodeling buffer (60 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 2.5 mm DTT, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 7 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin), including 0.73 nm of purified human SWI/SNF complex or 12.3 ng/μl(<6.2 nm SWI/SNF complex) of partially purified SWI/SNF complex from ROS 17/2.8 cells (ROSF), and 15.4 nm total nucleosome mixture (0.7 nm nucleosome probe, approximately). Samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Then, 750 ng of salmon sperm DNA (Sigma) and 500 ng of cold oligonucleosomes were added to the reaction mix and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The remodeled nucleosome samples were subsequently analyzed by electrophoresis in non-denaturant 5% polyacrylamide gels (0.5× TBE) or by direct restriction enzyme digestion (see below). Restriction Endonuclease Enzyme Accessibility Analysis—Reconstituted nucleosomes or mock reconstituted DNA segments were digested with restriction enzymes for 20 min at 30 °C. The amount of each restriction enzyme used in the assays was determined previously as that sufficient to obtain a partial digestion of the naked DNA (close to 90%). Digestions were stopped by the addition of EDTA (20 mm final concentration). The nucleosome samples that had been previously subjected to remodeling reactions were incubated with 1 unit of apyrase (1 unit/μl) for 20 min at 30 °C, prior to the addition of restriction enzyme. Incubation with the restriction enzyme was carried out for 20 min at 30 °C, followed by the addition of 750 ng of salmon sperm DNA (Sigma), 500 ng of non-labeled oligonucleosomes and EDTA (20 mm final concentration). This reaction mix was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. All samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide gel as described above. The percentage of digestion was determined using a Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies were performed as described earlier (27Villagra A. Cruzat F. Carvallo L. Olate J. van Wijnen A. Stein G. Lian J. Stein J. Imbalzano A.N. Montecino M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22695-22706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) with modifications. All the steps were performed at 4 °C. ROS 17/2.8 cell cultures (100-mm-diameter plates) were washed with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, scraped off in the same volume of phosphate-buffered saline, and collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.8), 20 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and a mixture of proteinase inhibitors) and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer using the loose pestle. The nuclear fraction was collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min and then incubated with the restriction endonuclease StuI (500 units/ml for 30 min at 37 °C) according to previous reports (18Montecino M. Lian J. Stein G. Stein J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5093-5102Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This enzyme cleaves between the proximal OC promoter region and the nucleosome positioned immediately upstream, therefore dividing the promoter and preventing that chromatin fragments containing sequences recognized by more than one specific set of primers are amplified. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 25 mm EDTA (final concentration), and the digested nuclear fraction was collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min and resuspended in 3.0 ml of sonication buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate acid, 0.1% SDS, and a mixture of proteinase inhibitors). To reduce the length of the chromatin fragments to ∼300 bp or smaller (confirmed by electrophoretic analysis and PCR amplification (not shown), the extract was sonicated with a Misonix sonicator (model 3000), using ten 15-s pulses at 30% power. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g, the supernatant was collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at –80 °C. An aliquot was used for A260 measurements. Extracts (6 units of A260) were resuspended in sonication buffer to a final volume of 500 μl. The samples were ple-cleared by incubation with 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads pre-blocked with bovine serum albumin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 15 min at 4 °C with agitation. After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was collected and immunoprecipitated with either an anti-histone H3 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, FL-136), anti-histone H4 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, H-97), anti-acetylated histone H3 polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, 06-599), or anti-acetylated histone H4 polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, 06-866). As a control for nonspecific precipitation, normal rabbit-purified IgG fraction (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2027) was used. The immunocomplexes were recovered with the addition of 30 μl of protein A-agarose beads and subsequent incubation for 1 h at 4°C with agitation. The complexes were washed twice with sonication buffer, twice with sonication buffer plus 500 mm NaCl, twice with LiCl buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm LiCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% deoxycholic acid), and twice with dialysis buffer (2 mm EDTA and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), with the solution incubated at each washing for 5 min at 4 °C. The histone-DNA complexes were then eluted by incubation with 100 μl of elution buffer (50 mm NaHCO3 and 1% SDS) for 15 min at 65 °C. After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was collected and incubated with 10 μg of RNase A per ml for 1 h at 42 °C. The proteins were then digested with 200 μg/ml proteinase K for 2 h at 50°C. The DNA was recovered by phenolchloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation using tRNA (5 μg/ml) as a precipitation carrier. The PCR conditions used to evaluate the OC proximal and distal promoter regions were reported previously (27Villagra A. Cruzat F. Carvallo L. Olate J. van Wijnen A. Stein G. Lian J. Stein J. Imbalzano A.N. Montecino M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22695-22706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To amplify the precipitated OC promoter sequences the following primers were used: forward (–315) 5′-CGATTTTAGATCTCTGTACCCTCTCTAGG-3′; reverse (–206) 5′-GACATGGCCCCAGACCTCTTCC-3′ or reverse (–28) 5′-TATATCCACTGCCTGAGCCC-3′; forward (–148) 5′-AGCTGCAGTCACCAACCAC-3′; and reverse (–57) 5′-GCAGGAGGGGCAGGAGATGCT-3′. The Proximal Region of the Rat Osteocalcin Gene Promoter Contains a Nucleosome-positioning Sequence—Multiple studies have established that following nucleosomal reconstitution in vitro, DNA segments larger than 150 bp (e.g. 230 bp) tend to position the histone octamer at their ends (5′-or3′-end) either immediately after reconstitution or after thermal redistribution, because these are the thermodynamically most stable conformations (28Meersseman G. Pennings S. Bradbury M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 29Flaus A. Richmond T. J. Mol.

This result is valid for any given DNA fragment unless it possesses a nucleotide sequence that favors a preferential position for the histone octamer different from the ends. We have previously reported that nucleosome reconstitution of segments from the proximal rat OC gene promoter results in a non-random positioning of the histone octamer (21Gutierrez J. Sierra J. Medina R. Puchi M. Imschenetzky M. van Wijnen A. Lian J. Stein G. Stein J. Montecino M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13565-13574Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that there may be sequences within this region of the promoter that preferentially organize nucleosomes. To address this hypothesis we initially tested the –287/–57 OC proximal promoter segment, which encompasses all the basic tissue-specific regulatory elements (19Montecino M. Frenkel B. Lian J. Stein J. Stein G. J. Cell Biochem. 1996; 63: 221-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gutierrez S. Javed A. Tennant D. van Rees M. Montecino M. Stein G. Stein J. Lian J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1316-1323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that nucleosome reconstitution of this fragment generates two main bands as determined by native PAGE (Fig. 1A, lane 2). These bands reflect at least two principal histone octamer positions at either end of the –287/–57 segment (the faster migration band) and at the center of this segment (retarded migration band) (28Meersseman G. Pennings S. Bradbury M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 31Duband-Goulet I. Carot V. Ulyanov A. Douc-Rasy S. Prunell A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 981-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Both nucleosome forms were isolated and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 5); thus indicating that they represent bona fide nucleosome particles that are stable at 4 °C for several days (data not shown). The precise position of these nucleosomes along the –287/–57 DNA segment was determined (21Gutierrez J. Sierra J. Medina R. Puchi M. Imschenetzky M. van Wijnen A. Lian J. Stein G. Stein J. Montecino M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13565-13574Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This approach involves digesting the isolated nucleosomes with micrococcal nuclease and mapping the position of the ∼146-bp micrococcal nuclease-resistant fragment by digesting with three different restriction enzymes. Mapping of the faster migrating nucleosome band confirmed that the histone octamer is positioned at both ends of the –287/–57 segment (Fig. 1, B and C). However, the significant differences in intensity of the bands generated by cleavage with the restriction enzymes indicate that the principal nucleosomal location (which accounts for ∼70% of the nucleosomal population) is at the 5′-end of the segment (Fig. 1B). For example, the bands of 126 nt and 20 nt corresponding to cleavage products generated after digestion of the micrococcal nuclease-resistant –287/–142 fragment with StuI are reproducibly and significantly more intense than the bands of 105 nt and 41 nt generated by cleavage of the micrococcal nuclease-resistant –202/–57 fragment with this same restriction endonuclease (Fig. 1B, lane 4). Mapping of the lower migration nucleosome band (Fig. 1B, lanes 7–10) confirmed that some of the histone octamers are located at the center of the –287/–57 segment, mainly positioned between –250 and –105 (Fig. 1D). Based on the restriction enzyme cleavage pattern (Fig. 1B, lanes 7–10) we determined that after isolation this central nucleosome population also exhibits a fraction of nucleosomes positioned at the ends of the –287/–57 segment (see also Fig. 1A, lane 5). This indicates that soon after purification (which proceeds at 4 °C), a fraction of the histone octamers are spontaneously mobilized toward the ends (28Meersseman G. Pennings S. Bradbury M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 29Flaus A. Richmond T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 427-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 30Flaus A. Owen-Hughes T.

Previous data indicated that presenilins, which are thought to harbor the catalytic core of the complex, also control p53-dependent cell death. Whether the other components of the γ-secretase complex could also modulate the cell death process in mammalian neurons remained to be established. Here, we examined the putative contribution of Aph-1 and Pen-2 in the control of apoptosis in TSM1 cells from a neuronal origin. We show by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling and DNA fragmentation analyses that the overexpression of Aph-1a, Aph-1b, or Pen-2 drastically lowered staurosporine-induced cellular toxicity. In support of an apoptosis rather than necrosis process, Aph-1 and Pen-2 also lower staurosporine- and etoposide-induced caspase-3 expression and diminished caspase-3 activity and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inactivation. The Aph-1 and Pen-2 anti-apoptotic phenotype was associated with a drastic reduction of p53 expression and activity and lowered p53 mRNA transcription. Furthermore, the Aph-1- and Pen-2-associated reduction of staurosporine-induced caspase-3 activation was fully abolished by p53 deficiency. Conversely, Aph-1a, Aph-1b, and Pen-2 gene inactivation increases both caspase-3 activity and p53 mRNA levels. Finally, we show that Aph-1 and Pen-2 did not trigger an anti-apoptotic response in cells devoid of presenilins or nicastrin, whereas the protective response was still observed in fibroblasts devoid of β-amyloid precursor protein and amyloid precursor protein like-protein 2. Furthermore, Aph-1- and Pen-2-associated protection against staurosporine-induced caspase-3 activation was not affected by the γ-secretase inhibitors N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester and difluoromethylketone. Altogether, our study indicates that Aph-1 and Pen-2 trigger an anti-apoptotic response by lowering p53-dependent control of caspase-3.

It is clear however that in mammals, the interaction of the four members is necessary for the functionality of the PS-dependent γ-secretase activity. Aph-1 contributes largely to the stabilization of γ-secretase complex by forming a subcomplex with nicastrin (20La Voie M.J. Fraering P.C. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Kimberly W.T. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J.

The stringency of the necessary presence of each of the components of the complex is illustrated by the fact that the absence of any of these proteins affects Aβ production (18Takasugi N. Tomita T.

Accordingly, the loss of function of Aph-1 and Pen-2 genes in Caenorhabditis elegans results in a Notch signaling deficiency, a phenotype that is directly linked to the ability of γ-secretase to process Notch (24Kopan R. Goate A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2799-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The implication of programmed cell death in AD has been largely documented in the last 10 years (25Su J.H.

In agreement with these studies, several works have consistently documented a pro-apoptotic phenotype of wild-type PS2, the extent of which appeared exacerbated by mutations responsible for familial forms of AD (30Alves da Costa C.

Berman S.A. Shioi J. Robakis N.K. Neve R.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9790-9799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that PS2 and PS1 cross-talk to control the p53-dependent cell death pathway (34Alves da Costa C. Sunyach C. Pardossi-Piquard R. Sevalle J. Vincent B. Boyer N. Kawarai T. Girardot N. St George Hyslop P. Checler F. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6377-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Both the involvement of AICD (βAPP intracellular domain), the γ-secretase-derived C-terminal product of the βAPP in the modulation of p53 and the blockade of this phenotype by γ-secretase inhibitors suggest that the γ-secretase activity remains essential for the PS-dependent control of cell death. Except for a role of Aph-1 and Pen-2 in γ-secretase complex formation and activity, little is known about other putative physiological functions, and more particularly, about their influence on the control of cell death in mammalian cells. However, the modulation of PS1 processing by RNA interference experiments targeting either Aph-1 and Pen-2 has been shown to affect the cellular sensitivity to caspase-3 activation (35Xie Z. Romano D.M. Kovacs D.M. Tanzi R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34130-34137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) leading to the conclusion that, at least indirectly through the control of PS, Aph-1 and Pen-2 could be seen as regulators of cell death. However, the mechanisms by which cell death is affected remained a matter of questions, particularly in cells of neuronal origin. Furthermore, the above considerations did not rule out the possibility that Aph-1 and Pen-2 could control cell death in a γ-secretase complex-independent manner or, alternatively, inside the γ-secretase complex but independently of its activity. Here, we examined the potential of Aph-1 and Pen-2 as regulators of cell death in the neuronal cell line TSM1, and we show that Aph-1aL, Aph-1b, and Pen-2 all decrease TSM1 susceptibility to staurosporine by lowering caspase-3 expression and activity in a p53-dependent manner. Furthermore, we establish that the Aph-1- and Pen-2-mediated anti-apoptotic phenotype is fully dependent of the presence of a complete and integral γ-secretase complex but exert their function independently of the γ-secretase activity.

Caspase-3 activity was then analyzed as extensively detailed (30Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Mattson M.P. Amson R. Telerman A. Ancolio K. Checler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4043-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Fluorometry was recorded at 390 nm and 460 nm for excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively, by means of a microtiter plate reader (Labsystems Fluoroskan II). Caspase specific activity was calculated from the linear part of fluorometry recording and expressed in units/h/mg of proteins (established by the Bio-Rad procedure). One unit corresponds to 4 nmol of amidomethylcoumarin released. Western Blot Analysis—Plated cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, gently scraped, pelleted by centrifugation, and then lysed in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2% SDS and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Equal amounts of protein (50 μg) were separated on 8% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE (analyses of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and murine double minute 2 (Mdm2)), and 12% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE (active caspase-3, p53, actin, tubulin, and Aph-1) or on 16.5% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE gels for analysis of Pen-2 and wet-transferred to Hybond C (Amersham Biosciences) membranes. Membranes were then blocked with nonfat milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: anti-PARP (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-active caspase-3 (rabbit polyclonal, R&D Systems), anti-p53 (mouse monoclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Myc 9E10 (mouse monoclonal, provided by Dr. L. Mercken, Aventis), anti-Mdm2 (mouse monoclonal, kindly provided by Dr. J. C. Bourdon), anti-β-tubulin (mouse monoclonal, Sigma), and anti-actin (mouse monoclonal, Sigma). Immunological complexes were revealed by enhanced electrochemiluminescence (Roche Applied Science) with either an anti-rabbit peroxidase or with an anti-mouse peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cambridgeshire, UK) antibodies according to the nature of the primary antibodies listed above. p53 Transcriptional Activity and p53 Promoter Activity Measurements—The activity of p53 is measured with a bioassay by transient transfection of the PG13-luciferase cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. B. Vogelstein, Baltimore, MD), which is based on the genomic DNA consensus sequence recognized by p53 on its target genes (40El-Deiry W. Kern S. Pietenpol J. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Nat. Gen. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activation of the p53 promoter was measured after transfections of cDNAs harboring the murine (41Ginsberg D. Oren M. Yaniv M. Piette J. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1285-1290PubMed Google Scholar) p53 promoter sequences in-frame with luciferase (provided by Dr. M. Oren, Rehovot, Israel). TSM-1 cells were cultivated in 12-well plates until 60% confluence and then cotransfected with 1.0 μg of PG13-luciferase cDNA or 1.0 μg of p53-promoter-luciferase cDNA and 0.5 μg of a β-galactosidase transfection vector (to normalize transfection efficiency) by means of the SuperFect transfection reagent according the manufacturer's conditions (Qiagen). Forty-eight hours after transfection, luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were analyzed according to manufacturer's conditions (Promega kit). Real-time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA from HEK293 or TSM1 cells was extracted by the mean of the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, then treated with DNase I, and 4 μg of RNA obtained was reverse transcribed as previously described then Real-time PCR was performed as extensively described (34Alves da Costa C. Sunyach C. Pardossi-Piquard R. Sevalle J. Vincent B. Boyer N. Kawarai T. Girardot N. St George Hyslop P. Checler F. J.

A control non-silencing siRNA duplex (siCT) was used as a control. HEK293 cells were cultured until they reach 70% of confluency, and then transfected with the appropriate siRNA duplex for 24 h using HiPerfect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Cells were then harvested, and the levels of mRNA for Aph-1a, Aph-1b, and Pen-2 were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR as described above. Then, caspase-3 activity and p53 mRNA levels were analyzed by fluorometry and real-time quantitative PCR as described above. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed with PRISM (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) using the Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test for one-way analysis of variance. Aph-1a, Aph-1b, and Pen-2 Overexpression Reduces Staurosporine-induced Toxicity in TSM1 Neuronal Cells—We took advantage of the recent acquisition and characterization (36Dunys J. Kawarai T. Wilk S. St George-Hyslop P. Alves da Costa C. Checler F. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) of stably transfected TSM-1 cells overexpressing Aph-1a, Aph-1b, or Pen-2 (Fig. 1A) to examine the influence of these proteins on the responsiveness of the TSM1 neuronal cell line (44Chun J. Jaenisch R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 304-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) to staurosporine. Staurosporine drastically increased the number of TUNEL-positive, mock transfected TSM1 cells (Fig. 1, B and C). The number of apoptotic nuclei was significantly reduced by either Aph-1a, Aph-1b, or Pen-2 overexpression (Fig. 1C). In agreement with these observations, staurosporine drastically enhanced the DNA fragmentation of mock transfected TSM1 neurons (Fig. 2A), whereas a statistically significant reduction of DNA fragmentation was observed in Aph-1a-, Aph-1b-, and Pen-2-overexpressing TSM1 cells (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Aph-1a, Aph-1b, and Pen-2 expression decreases staurosporine-induced DNA fragmentation in TSM1 cells. Mock transfected TSM1 neurons (A) or cells expressing Aph-1a, Aph-1b, and Pen-2 (B) were treated for 16 h without (CT) or with staurosporine (STS, 0.5 μm). Cells were then treated with propidium iodide, and nuclear propidium iodide incorporation was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” Typical representative histograms obtained in mock cells are shown in A.In B, the percentage of apoptotic nuclei measured by FACScan flow cytometry (see “Materials and Methods”) corresponds to the mean ± S.E. of three to five independent analyses. p values indicate the statistical significance of the indicated cell lines compared with mock transfected cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Aph-1a, Aph-1b, and Pen-2 Overexpression Reduces Staurosporine- and Etoposide-induced Caspase-3 Activation in TSM1 Cells—TSM1 cells respond to staurosporine by activating caspase-3-like activity in a dose- (Fig. 3A) and time-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Although the Ac-DEVD-7-amido-4-methyl coumarin substrate used to monitor cellular caspase activity is not strictly specific of caspase-3, the full blockade of staurosporine-induced caspase activation by the inhibitor Ac-DEVD-al (Fig. 3C) together with the drastic increase of active caspase-3 immunoreactivity (p17 and p20, Fig. 3D) suggest that caspase-3 indeed accounts for most of the staurosporine-induced increase in caspase-like activity. Interestingly, Aph-1 and Pen-2 expression reduces both caspase-3 activity (Fig. 3, A–C) and expression (Fig. 3D). PARP is involved in DNA repair and is inactivated by caspase-3 cleavage in apoptotic conditions (45Rosen A. Casciola-Rosen L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 46Decker P. Muller S. Curr. Pharm. Biotechnol. 2002; 3: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). As expected, staurosporine-induced caspase-3 activation leads to the cleavage of PARP as evidenced by the accumulation of the inactive 89-kDa PARP product in mock transfected TSM1 neurons (Fig. 3E), whereas Aph-1a, Aph-1b, and Pen-2 overexpression reduces the production of this 89-kDa product (Fig. 3E). To examine whether the Aph-1- and Pen-2-protective effect was restricted to staurosporine-stimulated caspase-3 activation, we studied the influence of Aph-1a, Aph-1b, and P"
https://openalex.org/W1976820623,"The primitive protozoan pathogen of humans, Leishmania donovani, resides and multiplies in highly restricted micro-environments within their hosts (i.e. as promastigotes in the gut lumen of their sandfly vectors and as amastigotes in the phagolysosomal compartments of infected mammalian macrophages). Like other trypanosomatid parasites, they are purine auxotrophs (i.e. lack the ability to synthesize purines de novo) and therefore are totally dependent upon salvaging these essential nutrients from their hosts. In that context, in this study we identified a unique 35-kDa, dithiothreitol-sensitive nuclease and showed that it was constitutively released/secreted by both promastigote and amastigote developmental forms of this parasite. By using several different molecular approaches, we identified and characterized the structure of LdNucs, a gene that encodes this new 35-kDa class I nuclease family member in these organisms. Homologous episomal expression of an epitope-tagged LdNucs chimeric construct was used in conjunction with an anti-LdNucs peptide antibody to delineate the functional and biochemical properties of this unique 35-kDa parasite released/secreted enzyme. Results of coupled immunoprecipitation-enzyme activity analyses demonstrated that this “secretory” enzyme could hydrolyze a variety of synthetic polynucleotides as well as several natural nucleic acid substrates, including RNA and single- and double-stranded DNA. Based on these cumulative observations, we hypothesize that within the micro-environments of its host, this leishmanial “secretory” nuclease could function at a distance away from the parasite to harness (i.e. hydrolyze/access) host-derived nucleic acids to satisfy the essential purine requirements of these organisms. Thus, this enzyme might play an important role(s) in facilitating the survival, growth, and development of this important human pathogen.

Thus, this enzyme might play an important role(s) in facilitating the survival, growth, and development of this important human pathogen. Leishmania are a group of primitive pathogenic trypanosomatid protozoan parasites that cause over 2 million new cases of human cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and fatal visceral disease (i.e. leishmaniasis) per year worldwide (1UNICEF/UNDP/World Bank/World Health Organization (2004) Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases; Tropical Disease Research/Scientific Working Group/04: Report on Leishmaniasis, pp. 19-23, Geneva, SwitzerlandGoogle Scholar). All Leishmania parasites undergo a digenetic life cycle, which includes differentiation, development, and transmission between both a sand fly vector and a mammalian host. Within their hosts, these parasites reside and multiply in highly restricted micro-environments (i.e. as extracellular, flagellated promastigote forms in the alimentary tract of their sandfly vectors and as obligate intracellular amastigote forms in the phagolysosomal compartments of infected mammalian macrophages) (2Handman E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 229-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). It is important to point out that Leishmania, like other trypanosomatid parasites, are incapable of the de novo biosynthesis of purines (3Hammond D.J. Gutteridge W.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 13: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 4Hassan H.F. Coombs G.H. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1986; 84: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems obvious that in order to survive, these purine auxotrophs must be capable of salvaging these essential nutrients from their host environments. One such purported purine salvage mechanism involves a unique cell surface membrane-anchored, bi-functional 3′-nucleotidase/nuclease that is present in several pathogenic Leishmania species and related trypanosomatids (5Debrabant A. Bastien P. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 220: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 6Debrabant A. Ghedin E. Dwyer D.M. J. Biol.

Parasitol. 2002; 32: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To date, however, no report exists to indicate that these organisms might also be capable of producing and releasing/secreting analogous purine salvage enzymes (e.g. nucleotide hydrolases, nucleases, or other nucleic acid hydrolases) into their host environments. In light of the above, in this study a variety of biochemical and functional approaches were used for the following: 1) to identify a new and unique 35-kDa nuclease produced by Leishmania donovani parasites, and 2) to examine its constitutive release/secretion by both the promastigote and amastigote life cycle developmental forms of this organism. Based on those observations, we used several molecular approaches to identify and characterize the structure of LdNucs, a gene that encodes this new, “secretory” class I nuclease from these parasites. An anti-LdNucs peptide antibody was generated against the gene-deduced protein and shown to specifically recognize and immunoprecipitate the single 35-kDa native nuclease synthesized and released/secreted by both wild-type L. donovani promastigotes and amastigotes. Furthermore, an epitope-tagged LdNucs chimeric construct was used in a homologous leishmanial expression system to delineate the functional and biochemical properties of this unique 35-kDa parasite released/secreted enzyme. Reagents—Unless specified, all chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade and were obtained from Sigma. Enzymes used for molecular studies were obtained from Roche Applied Science; DNA and RNA molecular mass standards were from Invitrogen, and protein molecular mass standards were purchased from GE Healthcare. Parasites—A cloned line of L. donovani (WHO designation: MHOM/SD/62/1S/1S-CL2D) was used in all experiments (10Shakarian A.M. Joshi M.B. Ghedin E. Dwyer D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17994-18001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Promastigote developmental forms of this parasite were routinely grown and maintained at 26 °C in medium 199 containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS 3The abbreviations used are: FBS, fetal bovine serum; aa, amino acid; DIG, digoxigenin; DTT, dithiothreitol; gDNA, genomic DNA; HA, hemagglutinin; LdNucs, gene encoding the released/secretory nuclease of L. donovani; nt, nucleotide; ORF, open reading frame; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; KLH, keyhole limpet hemocyanin; IFA, immunofluorescence; NRS, normal rabbit serum; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid). ; Gemini Bio-Products, Woodland, CA) as described previously by Debrabant et al. (11Debrabant A. Joshi M.B. Pimenta P.F. Dwyer D.M. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). For some experiments, culture supernatants from such serum-grown promastigotes were harvested and used in immunoprecipitation assays. To that end, when promastigote cultures reached a density of ∼1-2 × 107 cells ml-1 (i.e. mid-log phase), they were centrifuged at ∼2100 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants from these were removed and recentrifuged at 6000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Following this, the cell-free supernatants were carefully removed, frozen, and stored at -80 °C until used. In addition to promastigotes, axenic amastigotes of this L. donovani cloned line were also generated and grown at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium, pH 5.5, containing 20% (v/v) FBS as described previously (11Debrabant A. Joshi M.B. Pimenta P.F. Dwyer D.M. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Cell-free culture supernatants from such in vitro grown axenic amastigotes were prepared as indicated above for promastigotes and subsequently stored at -80 °C until used. In vivo, the tissue-derived L. donovani amastigotes were also isolated from spleens of infected hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus, LVG strain; Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Inc., Wilmington, MA), as described previously (11Debrabant A. Joshi M.B. Pimenta P.F. Dwyer D.M. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 12Dwyer D.M. Langreth S.G. Dwyer N.K. Z.

Immunol. 1976; 117: 2081-2091PubMed Google Scholar), frozen, stored in liquid nitrogen, and used as needed for various experimental purposes. For isolation of nucleic acids and proteins, parasite cell cultures were grown to about mid-log phase as above and harvested by centrifugation at ∼2100 × g for 15 min at 4 °C (5Debrabant A. Bastien P. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 220: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The resulting cell pellets were washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 145 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) by centrifugation as above and finally resuspended in buffers appropriate for the extraction of DNA, RNA, or proteins (see below). Generation of Culture Supernatants from Parasites Grown under Chemically Defined Conditions—To analyze the nuclease activity released/secreted by both L. donovani wild-type (i.e. nontransfected cells) and episomally transfected promastigotes, these cells were grown in serum-free, chemically defined medium (M199+) according to McCarthy-Burke et al. (14McCarthy-Burke C. Bates P.A. Dwyer D.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1991; 73: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). When such cultures reached a density of ∼1-2 × 107 cells ml-1 (i.e. mid-log phase), they were examined by phase contrast microscopy to ensure >99.9% cell viability and subsequently harvested by centrifugation at ∼2100 × g for 15 min at 4 °C as described previously (15Shakarian A.M. Joshi M.B. Yamage M. Ellis S.L. Debrabant A. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 245: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Following an additional high speed recentrifugation step, to ensure the complete pelleting of cells (15Shakarian A.M. Joshi M.B. Yamage M. Ellis S.L. Debrabant A. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 245: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), such culture supernatants were carefully removed and subsequently concentrated up to ∼100-fold (100×) using Centricon® Plus-20 centrifugal filtration devices according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amicon Bioseparations, Millipore Corp.). These concentrated, cell-free culture supernatants were frozen and stored at -80 °C until needed. For activity gel analyses, such samples were diluted with SDS-polyacrylamide sample buffer (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar) either containing 50 mm DTT (final concentration, +DTT) or lacking any reducing agents (-DTT). Following heating in a boiling water bath for 5 min, these samples were assayed for their nuclease activity using polynucleotide-containing substrate gels as described below. Parasite Cell Lysates—Washed cell pellets of L. donovani wild-type promastigotes, axenic amastigotes, and in vivo-derived amastigotes as well as episomally transfected promastigotes were solubilized in SDS-polyacrylamide sample buffer (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar) lacking any reducing agents and heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min. Following this, the solubilized samples were cooled to room temperature, frozen, and stored at -80 °C until analyzed. The protein concentration in these cell lysates was determined using the bicinchoninic acid method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Micro BCA, Pierce). Subsequently, equivalent amounts of protein from such lysates were separated in poly(A)-containing SDS-polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions and stained in situ for their nuclease activity (17Bates P.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 107: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments to test the effects of reducing agents on nuclease activity, cell lysates were also prepared in SDS-polyacrylamide sample buffer containing 50 mm DTT (final concentration). In Situ Nuclease Activity/Zymogram Gels—Parasite cell lysates, aliquots of concentrated serum-free culture supernatants from promastigotes (above) and samples from immunoprecipitation and affinity binding assays were separated in SDSPAGE mini-gels (8 × 8 cm) and processed for in situ staining of nuclease activity essentially according to Bates (17Bates P.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 107: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) as modified from Zlotnick et al. (18Zlotnick G.W. Mackow M.C. Gottlieb M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1987; 87: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE using a 10% resolving gel (1 mm thick) containing poly(A) (300 μgml-1, final concentration) and a discontinuous buffer system (19Hames B. Harnes B.D. Rickwood D. Gel Electrophoresis of Proteins: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1981: 1-91Google Scholar). Following separation, gels were washed at room temperature with four changes (∼100 ml for 15 min each) of buffer containing 100 mm HEPES, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Protein Grade® Detergent, Calbiochem), pH 8.5, on an orbital shaker. This protocol was adopted to remove SDS from the gels and facilitate renaturation of nuclease activity. Subsequent to washing, these gels were incubated in the same buffer for 2 h at 37 °C with gentle agitation in a rocking hybridization oven (Shake ‘n’ Bake™, Boekel Scientific, Feasterville, PA). Following incubation, gels were rinsed briefly with deionized water and fixed for 10 min in 7.5% (v/v) aqueous acetic acid. Subsequently, these gels were washed in three changes of deionized water (∼200 ml, 10 min each), stained with toluidine blue O (0.2% (w/v) in 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.5) for 15 min, and destained using multiple changes of deionized water (20Blank A. Sugiyama R.H. Dekker C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 120: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) all at room temperature using an orbital shaker. The nuclease activity in these gels was readily apparent as distinct, clear/colorless bands of substrate hydrolysis in an otherwise uniformly stained dark blue background of unhydrolyzed polynucleotide substrate. For some experiments, zymogram gels were prepared as above except that various other individual synthetic polynucleotides (i.e. poly(C), poly(G), poly(I), or poly(U), all from Sigma) were substituted for the poly(A) substrate. Nomenclature—The designations used in this report for genes, proteins, and plasmids follow the nomenclature for Trypanosoma and Leishmania as outlined by Clayton et al. (21Clayton C. Adams M. Almeida R. Baltz T. Barrett M. Bastien P. Belli S. Beverley S. Biteau N. Blackwell J. Blaineau C. Boshart M. Bringaud F. Cross G. Cruz A. Degrave W. Donelson J. El-Sayed N. Fu G. Ersfeld K. Gibson W. Gull K. Ivens A. Kelly J. Vanhamme L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide Primers, PCR, and Cloning—In preliminary experiments, we found that during their growth in vitro, L. donovani wild-type promastigotes released/secreted an ∼35-kDa nuclease activity into their culture medium. Based on these observations, we searched the Leishmania major (Friedlin) GeneDB data base for putative nucleases. Among the 41 sequences present in the data base, only two possessed a putative signal peptide, had an open reading frame (ORF) encoding an ∼35-kDa deduced protein, and lacked any apparent membrane anchor motifs. These two sequences were annotated as follows: P1/S1 nucleases (GeneDB Data Bank identifier, LmjF30.1500 and LmjF30.1510) and located on chromosome 30 of L. major. In addition to the latter annotations, an analogous nuclease gene sequence was reported from an Iranian rodent isolate of L. major (22Farajnia S. Alimohammadian M.H. Reiner N.E. Karimi M. Ajdari S. Mahboudi F. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Comparisons of these three L. major sequences were done using the Gap-Global alignment program of Genetic Computer Group (GCG) via NIH helix (molbio.info.nih.gov/molbio/gcglite/compare.html). Such analyses showed that these sequences had ∼96% identity with each other. Based on those observations, primers were designed against one of these L. major sequences (22Farajnia S. Alimohammadian M.H. Reiner N.E. Karimi M. Ajdari S. Mahboudi F. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), toward amplifying the P1/S1 nuclease homolog from L. donovani. To that end, a sense primer (5′-ATGCCTGCGTTTGTCGGCCTCCGTCTG-3′) with a methionine initiation codon (boldface type) corresponding to aa 1-9 and a reverse/antisense primer (5′-CGCGCTCCACTTCCAACGTGCAGCGCG-3′) corresponding to aa 308-316 of the above L. major sequence (22Farajnia S.

For PCR amplifications, these primers were used with 50 ng of L. donovani genomic (g) DNA as a template and a high fidelity polymerase mix (High Fidelity PCR Master Mix, Roche Applied Science). The latter was possible because trypanosomatid protozoans generally do not possess introns within the coding regions of their ORFs (23Schneider A. McNally K.P. Agabian N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21868-21874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Fong D. Lee B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 31: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). After an initial “hot start” at 94 °C for 2 min, the conditions used for amplification were as follows: 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min (35 cycles), and a final step at 72 °C for 5 min. The resulting ∼950-bp amplified product was cloned into the pCR®2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). This plasmid was subjected to nucleotide sequencing using vector-encoded M13-forward and -reverse primers. Results of those analyses showed that this PCR clone had a high level of identity with the L. major putative “P1/S1 nuclease” sequences above. Subsequently, this PCR clone was labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP using a PCR-Dig labeling kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting digoxigenin-labeled probe (LdNucs-DIG950) was used to screen an L. donovani cosmid library to obtain a complete genomic copy of the LdNucs nuclease gene. Screening of an L. donovani Cosmid Library—An L. donovani cosmid library (a generous gift from by Dr. Buddy Ullman, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland) was screened using the LdNucs-DIG950 probe under high stringency hybridization and washing conditions (i.e. 0.1× SSC; 0.1% SDS at 65 °C). Following three rounds of isolation and hybridization, several positive clones were identified. One of these (LdNucs-FRED/II) was chosen for further analyses. DNA was isolated from this cosmid clone using a plasmid purification kit (Qiagen) and subjected to nucleotide sequencing. Nucleotide Sequencing and Analyses—DNA was sequenced using the fluorescent dideoxy chain terminator cycle sequencing method (25McCombie W.R. Heiner C. Kelley J.M. Fitzgerald M.G. Gocayne J.D. DNA Seq. 1992; 2: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) at The Johns Hopkins University DNA Analysis Facility (Baltimore, MD). Sequence data obtained from both strands were analyzed using the GCG software package (26Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar) running on a National Institutes of Health Unix System and Sequencher™3.0 software (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI). Furthermore, such sequences were also subjected to BLAST-N and BLAST-P analyses using the NCBI BLAST-link (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Signal peptide sequence and protease cleavage sites were predicted using the SignalP link available at the worldwide ExPASy proteomics server available on line. Protein domain analysis was done using the web-based Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool (available on line). Protein multiple sequence alignments were done using the ClustalW program (27Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55721) Google Scholar) using a MacVector® 7.0 software package (Accelrys). Isolation of Genomic DNA and Southern Blot Analysis—Total gDNA was isolated from mid-log phase L. donovani promastigotes using the Gnome DNA Isolation Kit (Bio101, Carlsbad, CA) as described by Joshi et al. (28Joshi M.B. Rogers M.E. Shakarian A.M. Yamage M. Al-Harthi S.A. Bates P.A. Dwyer D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3847-3861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Aliquots of this DNA were digested with the following individual restriction endonucleases BamHI, ClaI, EcoRI, HindIII, NcoI, PvuII SpeI, SphI, and XhoI, separated on 1% agarose gels, transferred to positively charged nylon membranes (Roche Applied Science), and crosslinked to the membranes by UV irradiation using a Stratalinker® 2400 (Stratagene). Subsequently, such blots were hybridized under high stringency conditions with the digoxigenin-labeled LdNucs-DIG950 probe according to manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Applied Science). Following washing at high stringency (i.e. 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C), the hybridized fragments were visualized using an anti-digoxigenin, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody in conjunction with a chemiluminescent substrate (CSPD) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Images from such blots were captured using BIOMAX™-MR x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Isolation of RNA and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from promastigotes and axenic amastigotes of L. donovani using RNA STAT-60 according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). Total RNA (10 μg) was separated in 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gels (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.43-7.45Google Scholar) and subjected to Northern blot analysis with the LdNucs-DIG950 probe as per Joshi et al. (28Joshi M.B.

Generation of a Rabbit Anti-LdNucs Antibody—Based upon analyses of the antigenic indices of the LdNucs-deduced protein, a single immunogenic peptide sequence was identified. A synthetic peptide, corresponding to this sequence (i.e. aa residues 157-172, Leu-His-Thr-Ile-Ser-Arg-Tyr-Ser-Ser-Glu-Tyr-Pro-His-Gly-Asp-Lys) was synthesized using 9-fluoromethyloxycarbonyl chemistry (Commonwealth Biotechnologies, Inc., Richmond, VA). An N-terminal cysteine residue was incorporated into this peptide to facilitate its conjugation to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). Subsequently, the peptide was purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and conjugated to KLH using an Imject® maleimide-activated mcKLH kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). This conjugate was used to generate our anti-LdNucs antibody in a New Zealand White rabbit according to the provider's (Spring Valley Laboratories, Woodbine, MD) standard immunization protocol (i.e. primary immunization followed by three boosts, using 250 μg of conjugated peptide per injection). The resulting anti-LdNucs antibody was used in subsequent immunoprecipitation, indirect immunofluorescence (IFA), and Western blot analyses as indicated below. Preimmune serum from this rabbit (NRS) served as control in all experiments. Generation of the pKSNEO::LdNucs-HA Epitope-tagged Expression Construct—A homologous episomal system was used to express an epitope-tagged LdNucs-HA chimeric protein in L. donovani promastigotes. To that end, a construct was designed that contained the complete open reading frame of the L. donovani Nucs gene (including its 5′-end encoding the putative signal peptide) joined, at its 3′-end, with a nine amino acid sequence encoding the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (Roche Applied Science). This construct was generated by PCR using the LdNucs-FRED/II cosmid clone as template with a forward primer 5′-CATACTAGTATGCCCGCGCTTGTCGGCCTC-3′ (containing an SpeI restriction site shown in boldface) and a reverse primer 5′-CGTACTAGTT-TACGCGTAGTCCGGCACGTCGTACGGGTACGCACCTCGCTT-3′ (containing an SpeI restriction site shown in boldface; stop codon in boldface with underlines; and the HA epitope sequence underlined). The PCR conditions used were as follows: a hot start at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of amplification at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min and a final step at 72 °C for 5 min. The resulting ∼1000-bp amplified product (LdNucs-HA) was gel-purified and cloned into the pCR®2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) to generate the pCR2.1::LdNucs-HA plasmid. The insert was excised from the latter using SpeI. Subsequently, the excised fragment was ligated into the SpeI site of the pKSNEO expression vector (30Zhang W.W. Charest H. Ghedin E. Matlashewski G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) to generate the pKSNEO::LdNucs-HA plasmid construct. The orientation of LdNucs-HA in pKSNEO was examined by restriction enzyme analysis, and the nt sequence of this construct was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Homologous Episomal Expression of LdNucs—Both the pKSNEO::LdNucs-HA construct and the [pKSNEO] control plasmid were transfected into L. donovani promastigotes using electroporation conditions essentially as described by Shakarian et al. (10Shakarian A.M. Joshi M.B. Ghedin E. Dwyer D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17994-18001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Following overnight recovery in medium M199+ with 10% FBS (at 26 °C), these cells were selected for their growth in the same medium containing 15 μgml-1 Geneticin® (G418, Invitrogen). Once such drug-resistant parasites emerged, they were further selected in increasing concentrations of G418 up to 100 μgml-1. For routine purposes, these transfectants were maintained and grown at 26 °C in complete growth medium containing 100 μgml-1 of G418. For some experiments, these transfectants were also grown under serum-free conditions, in chemically defined (M199+) medium (14McCarthy-Burke C. Bates P.A. Dwyer D.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1991; 73: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) supplemented with 100 μgml-1 of G418. Both cell lysates and cell-free culture supernatants were prepared from these transfectants as described above. Growth Kinetics of Transfected Parasites—Both pKSNEO control and pKSNEO::LdNucs-HA transfected parasites were monitored at regular intervals during the course of their growth in vitro. For experiments, triplicate cultures of both transfectants were initiated at 1-2 × 106 cells ml-1 (i.e. from stock cultures in their exponential phase of growth). Aliquots from such cultures were taken at regular intervals, diluted appropriately, and counted using a Coulter® counter (Model Z1, Beckman-Coulter) as described previously (11Debrabant A. Joshi M.B. Pimenta P.F. Dwyer D.M. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).

Crystallographic studies of the 70-kDa C terminus of human Top1p bound to duplex DNA describe a monomeric protein clamp circumscribing the DNA helix. The structures, which lack the N-terminal domain, comprise the conserved clamp, an extended linker domain, and the conserved C-terminal active site Tyr domain. CPT bound to the covalent Top1p-DNA complex limits linker flexibility, allowing structural determination of this domain. We previously reported that mutation of Ala653 to Pro in the linker increases the rate of enzyme-catalyzed DNA religation, thereby rendering Top1A653Pp resistant to CPT (Fiorani, P., Bruselles, A., Falconi, M., Chillemi, G., Desideri, A., and Benedetti P. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 43268–43275). Molecular dynamics studies suggested mutation-induced increases in linker flexibility alter Top1p catalyzed DNA religation. To address the functional consequences of linker flexibility on enzyme catalysis and drug sensitivity, we investigated the interactions of the A653P linker mutation with a self-poisoning T718A mutation within the active site of Top1p. The A653P mutation suppressed the lethal phenotype of Top1T718Ap in yeast, yet did not restore enzyme sensitivity to CPT. However, the specific activity of the double mutant was decreased in vivo and in vitro, consistent with a decrease in DNA binding. These findings support a model where changes in the flexibility or orientation of the linker alter the geometry of the active site and thereby the kinetics of DNA cleavage/religation catalyzed by Top1p.

This 91-kDa enzyme catalyzes the relaxation of supercoiled DNA through the transient cleavage of one strand of the DNA duplex. The Top1p catalytic cycle comprises five sequential steps: DNA binding, cleavage, strand rotation, religation, and release (1Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2192) Google Scholar, 2Corbett K.D. Berger J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

During enzyme catalysis, Top1p undergoes large conformational changes, from an “open” structure that allows DNA binding, to the “closed clamp” conformation observed in co-crystal structures, in which the enzyme completely embraces the duplex DNA (5Woo M.H. Losasso C. Guo H. Pattarello L. Benedetti P. Bjornsti M.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13767-13772Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). DNA relaxation appears to proceed via a mechanism of DNA strand rotation, where the covalent attachment of Top1p to the 3′-phosphoryl end of the nicked DNA strand liberates the 5′-OH end to rotate around the intact nonscissile DNA strand (6Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the dynamic changes in protein clamp conformation and linkage of DNA strands occur in the absence of any energy cofactors, such as ATP. Eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I is the cellular target of the antitumor drug camptothecin (CPT) (7Li T.K. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

CPT specifically and reversibly binds the covalent Top1p-DNA complex to inhibit DNA religation and induce S-phase-dependent cell lethality. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, single amino acid substitutions have been defined in Top1p that mimic the cytotoxic activity of CPT by inducing a terminal G2-phase phenotype and increased rates of recombination (10Megonigal M.D. Fertala J.

For example, substitution of Ala for residue Thr722 (within the active site Tyr727 domain) induces a dramatic reduction in cell viability when expressed in yeast or human cells (10Megonigal M.D. Fertala J.

Similar to the action of CPT, this mutation enhances the stability of covalent enzyme-DNA complexes by a reduction in the rate of DNA religation (14Colley W.C. van der Merwe M. Vance J.R.

Substitution of Ala for the corresponding residue Thr718 of human Top1p (top1T718A) induces a similar phenotype and alterations in enzyme catalysis (12Fiorani P. Amatruda J.F. Silvestri A. Butler R.H. Bjornsti M.A. Benedetti P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, in yeast and human Top1p, mutation of this conserved Thr residue (located just five residues N-terminal to the active site Tyr) induces cell lethality as a consequence of an increase in the half-life of the covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate (14Colley W.C. van der Merwe M.

Recent structures of the C-terminal 70-kDa fragment of human Top1p (Topo70) with DNA and the ternary topotecan Topo70-DNA complex indicate the formation of a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl of Thr718 and the nonbridging oxygen of the +1 phosphodiester of the DNA (17Staker B.L. Hjerrild K. Feese M.D. Behnke C.A. Burgin Jr., A.B. Stewart L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15387-15392Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). These data suggest that substitution of Ala in this position may alter the orientation of the 5′-OH nucleophile to alter the rate of DNA religation. Structural and biochemical data indicate DNA topoisomerase I contains multiple domains that form a protein clamp around duplex DNA (18Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Based on limited proteolysis studies and crystal structures (18Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 19Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 355-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) the protein can be divided into four major domains: a highly charged N-terminal region, the conserved core domain that forms the protein clamp, a pair of extended α-helices that form a positively charged linker domain and the highly conserved C-terminal domain containing the catalytic Tyr residue. The core domain contains all of the catalytic residues except the active site Tyr. The linker domain assumes a protruding coiled-coil conformation that is stabilized by hydrophobic side chain interactions between conserved heptads repeating residues. The linker connects the core with the C-terminal domain to position the active sire Tyr within the catalytic pocket of the core. Evidence that the linker domain contacts DNA in solution is supported by proteolysis studies, which show that the linker is 10-fold more resistant to limited proteolysis when the enzyme is bound non-covalently to duplex DNA (20Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7602-7608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). It has been shown that breaking the physical linkage between the linker and core reduces enzyme binding of DNA and shifts the DNA cleavage-religation equilibrium toward religation. Moreover, molecular dynamic simulations suggest that the CPT resistance induced by a single Ala653 to Pro mutation within the linker domain (Fig. 1) results from an increase in linker flexibility, which enhances the rate of DNA religation (21Fiorani P. Bruselles A. Falconi M. Chillemi G. Desideri A. Benedetti P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43268-43275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that linker flexibility may regulate the resolution of the Top1p-DNA covalent complex. However, despite a wealth of biochemical, structural and modeling data on Top1p structure and activity, there is little direct evidence of linker domain flexibility influencing the geometry of the active site. To address this question we asked if the enhanced rate of DNA religation, imparted by the A653P linker mutation, would suppress the DNA religation defect induced by the T718A active site mutation. Indeed, here we describe that the combination of the two mutations (in Top1A653P/T718A), abolished the lethal phenotype of yeast cells expressing the single T718A mutant. The double mutant enzyme was catalytically active in vitro and in vivo, yet was resistant to CPT. Taken together these data indicate long range communications between the flexible linker domain and the active site of the enzyme.

Individual transformants were grown to an A595 = 0.5, and 5-μl aliquots of serial 10-fold dilutions were spotted onto SC-uracil plates plus 2% dextrose or 2% galactose, with or without the indicated concentrations of CPT. Cell viability was assessed following incubation at 30 °C. For comparisons of EKY3 (UBC9) and RRY82 (ubc9–10) strains, cell viability was assayed at 36 °C. Purification of DNA Topoisomerase I—Epitope-tagged Top1 proteins were partially purified from galactose-induced EKY3 cells transformed with YCpGAL1-TOP1 or YCpGAL1-top1A653P/T718A by phosphocellulose chromatography as described (27Benedetti P.

To obtain homogeneous preparations, Top1 proteins eluted in TEEG (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol) plus 0.8 m KCl were diluted to a final 150 mm KCl and applied to an anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel column. The column was washed with TBS (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm KCl), and the eTop1 proteins eluted with a solution of 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide in TBS. The fractions were adjusted to a final 40% glycerol and stored at -20 °C. Top1 protein levels and integrity were assessed in immunoblots, with the M2 antibody. Top1p Activity in Vitro—Top1 activity was assayed in a DNA relaxation assay (24Bjornsti M.A. Benedetti P. Viglianti G.A. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6318-6323PubMed Google Scholar, 27Benedetti P.

Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4343-4348PubMed Google Scholar). 120 pmol of Top1 proteins were incubated in 30-μl reactions containing 0.5 μg of negatively supercoiled pHC624 plasmid DNA in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml acetylated BSA and the indicated concentration of KCl. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C and terminated at the times indicated with a final 0.5% SDS. Reaction products were resolved in 1% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized with a Bio-Rad Gel doc system. To quantitate relative levels of supercoiled and relaxed DNA topoisomers, the stained gels were first exposed to UV light to induce photo-nicking of the DNA, then re-stained with ethidium bromide. These steps obviated any contribution of DNA topology to ethidium bromide binding, and consequently, relative band intensity. Top1p Activity in Vivo—JCW28 (top1Δ, top2–4) cells, co-transformed with YEpGPD-topA and either YCpGAL1, YCpGAL1-TOP1, YCpGAL1-top1A653P, or YCpGAL1-top1A653P/T718A were cultured in selective medium plus dextrose at 26 °C, then diluted into selective medium supplemented with 2% raffinose. At A595 = 1.0, TOP1 expression was induced with a final 2% galactose. After 5 h, the culture was shifted to 36 °C, the nonpermissive temperature for top2–4, for an additional 3 h. The cells were fixed with pre-chilled toluene/ethanol and the plasmid DNA purified as described (10Megonigal M.D. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.A. J. Biol.

DNA Cleavage Assays—CPT-induced stabilization of Top1-DNA covalent complexes was assessed in DNA cleavage assays as described (10Megonigal M.D. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.A. J. Biol.

Briefly, equal concentrations of purified Top1 proteins were incubated in 50-μl reactions with a single 3′ 32P-end-labeled, 900-bp DNA fragment, which contains the exadecameric high affinity Top1p cleavage site (30Bonven B.J. Gocke E. Westergaard O. Cell. 1985; 41: 541-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and was excised from plasmid pBlueAK3–1 (28Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6141-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Where indicated, reactions were supplemented with 50 μm CPT. Me2SO was added to the no drug controls. Following incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, reactions were terminated by the addition of 1% SDS, and the cleavage products were resolved in a 7 m urea/8% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by Phosphorimager analysis (31Fiorani P. Hann C.L. Benedetti P. Bjornsti M.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 95: 291-301PubMed Google Scholar). Suicide Cleavage Assays—A 52-mer oligonucleotide (5′-GCTATACGAATTCGCTATAATTCATATGATAGCGGATCCAAAAAAGACTTAG-3′), which contains a Top1p high affinity cleavage site, was 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. A 100-nt (3′-CGATATGCTTAAGCGATATTAAGTATACTATCGCCTAGGTTTTTTCTGAATCTTTTTTTTTTTCGAATTCGTTGTATACCATAGCAGCCTTAAGTTACTC-5′) nonscissile DNA strand and a 50-nt (5′-AGAAAAAAAAAAAGCTTAAGCAACATATGGTATCGTCGGAATTCAATGAG-3′) oligonucleotide were 5′-phosphorylated with unlabeled ATP. The three strands (kind gift from Birgitta Knudsen, Aarhus University) were annealed at a molar ratio of 2:3:1 of 100 nt: 52 nt: 50 nt in 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol by heating to 95 °C for 5 min, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The resulting DNA substrate (20 nm) was incubated with equal concentrations of Top1 proteins in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml acetylated BSA, and 50 mm KCl at 25 °C. At the times indicated, 10-μl aliquots were quenched with 0.5% SDS and heated to 75 °C. Half of these mixtures were ethanol-precipitated and then resolved in 7 m urea/12% acrylamide gels (Fig. 8B). The second half of the reaction was added to 2.5 ml of protein sample loading buffer (156 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 25% glycerol, 12.5% mercaptoethanol, 0.0025% bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, and 10 ml of each sample were analyzed by 10% Tricine, SDS-PAGE (Fig. 8C). The percentage of cleavage was determined by PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software and normalized on the total amount of radioactivity in each lane. Religation Assays—To assess enzyme-catalyzed DNA cleavage and religation, the truncated suicide oligonucleotide substrate described above was used. The 50-nt (5′-AGAAAAAAAAAAAGCTTAAGCAACATATGGTATCGTCGGAATTCAATGAG-3′) religation oligonucleotide was not 5′-phosphorylated to allow for enzyme-catalyzed religation. The resulting DNA substrate (20 nm) was incubated with equal concentrations of Top1 proteins in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml acetylated BSA, and 50 mm KCl at 25 °C. At the times indicated, 5-μl aliquots were quenched with 0.5% SDS and heated to 75 °C. The reaction products were resolved in 7 m urea/16% acrylamide gels and visualized with a PhosphorImager (Fig. 9B). The CPT-resistant A653P Mutation Suppresses Top1T718A-induced Lethality—In a yeast genetic screen for catalytically active, CPT-resistant human top1 mutants, we previously reported an Ala653 to Pro substitution within the linker domain (Fig. 1) that sufficed to confer drug resistance (21Fiorani P. Bruselles A. Falconi M. Chillemi G. Desideri A. Benedetti P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43268-43275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Subsequent biochemical studies and molecular dynamic simulations suggested a model whereby a mutation-induced increase in linker flexibility enhanced the rate of Top1p-catalyzed DNA religation, which in turn decreased the ability of CPT to stabilize the covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate (21Fiorani P. Bruselles A. Falconi M. Chillemi G. Desideri A. Benedetti P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43268-43275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These findings further suggested that the mobility of the linker domain directly impacts the geometry and activity of the active site. If this interpretation were correct, we reasoned that the increased rate of DNA religation imparted by the A653P linker mutation would suppress the decreased rate of DNA religation, and consequently the lethality, of the active site T718A mutant (see Fig. 1). Indeed, as seen in Fig. 2, this prediction was borne out in top1Δ yeast cells expressing the human Top1 mutants. As previously reported (12Fiorani P. Amatruda J.F. Silvestri A. Butler R.H. Bjornsti M.A. Benedetti P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), expression of the top1T718A mutant from the galactose-inducible pGAL1 promoter, produced a dramatic reduction in yeast cell viability (Fig. 2). In contrast, cells expressing either the single top1A653P or the double top1A653P/T718A mutant were viable. Although pGAL1-promoted expression of top1T718A is cytotoxic, biochemical studies with purified protein demonstrated that the enzyme is sensitive to CPT (12Fiorani P. Amatruda J.F. Silvestri A. Butler R.H. Bjornsti M.A. Benedetti P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To assess the CPT sensitivity of the double top1A653P/T718A mutant, yeast cells transformed with pGAL-promoted TOP1, top1A653P, top1T718A, and top1A653P/T718A were assessed for growth on selective medium containing CPT. As shown in Fig. 2, the double mutant top1A653P/T718A conferred a CPT-resistant phenotype comparable to that of the single top1A653P mutant. To ensure that the CPT-resistant phenotype did not result from the loss of Top1A653P/T718A catalytic activity, the in vivo activity of the wild-type and mutant enzymes was assessed. As previously reported (10Megonigal M.D. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12801-12808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 27Benedetti P. Fiorani P.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Top1-catalyzed relaxation of local domains of positively supercoiled DNA can be readily addressed in JCW28 (top1Δ,top2ts) cells that constitutively express the bacterial topA gene. Transcription from divergent promoters in the 2-μm plasmid induces local domains of positive and negative supercoils (25Giaever G.N. Wang J.C. Cell. 1988; 55: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). At the nonpermissive temperature, cells lack endogenous yeast Top1 and Top2 activity. However, bacterial TopA preferentially catalyzes the relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA, resulting in the accumulation of positively supercoiled plasmids (see control in Fig. 3). In contrast, when a catalytically active human Top1 is also expressed in these cells, Top1 catalyzes the relaxation of both positively and negatively supercoiled DNA. This produces a shift in plasmid topoisomer distribution from that of positively supercoiled (+) to the slightly negatively supercoiled distribution of plasmid DNA assembled with nucleosomes (-)(TOP1 panel in Fig. 3). The single mutant Top1A653Pp and double mutant Top1A653P/T718Ap were also catalytically active (Fig. 3), albeit at a slightly lower level than that seen for wild-type Top1p or reported for Top1T718Ap (12Fiorani P. Amatruda J.F. Silvestri A. Butler R.H. Bjornsti M.A. Benedetti P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the CPT resistance of yeast cells expressing the double mutant could not be attributed to the loss of catalytic activity in vivo. Top1A653P/T718Ap Catalytic Activity in Vitro—To assess whether the combination of the two mutations alters the catalytic cycle of Top1p, the proteins were purified to homogeneity from galactose-induced yeast top1Δ cells, as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” The specific activity of Top1p, Top1A653P, and Top1A653P/T718Ap was determined in plasmid DNA relaxation assays. Serial dilutions of equal protein concentrations were incubated with negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA, and the reaction products resolved in agarose gels, as described (24Bjornsti M.A. Benedetti P. Viglianti G.A. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6318-6323PubMed Google Scholar, 27Benedetti P. Fiorani P. Capuani L. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4343-4348PubMed Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 4, the specific activity of both mutants were reduced relative to that of the wild-type enzyme. Top1A653Pp activity was ∼10-fold lower than Top1p (as reported in Ref. 21Fiorani P. Bruselles A. Falconi M. Chillemi G. Desideri A. Benedetti P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43268-43275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), whereas Top1A653P/T718Ap was reduced by 10–20-fold. Thus, specific activity of the double mutant was about 2–3-fold lower than that of the single mutant Top1A653Pp, consistent with the slight decrease in enzyme activity reported in our earlier studies of Top1T718Ap (12Fiorani P. Amatruda J.F. Silvestri A. Butler R.H. Bjornsti M.A. Benedetti P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The observed reduction in catalytic activity of the mutant Top1A653P/T718A enzyme could result from several alterations in enzyme catalytic cycle, including reduced DNA substrate binding or decreased rates of DNA cleavage/religation. To discriminate between these possibilities, we first assessed the effects of ionic strength on mutant enzyme catalysis. Top1 activity exhibits a salt optimum around 150 mm (32McConaughy B.L. Young L.S. Champoux J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 655: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Deviations from this value have previously been sho"

Here we show that ectopic expression of p200 RhoGAP stimulates fibroblast cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, leading to transformation. The morphology of the foci induced by p200 RhoGAP is distinct from that formed by Rac or Rho activation but similar to that induced by oncogenic Ras, raising the possibility that p200 RhoGAP may engage Ras signaling. Expression of p200 RhoGAP results in a significant increase of Ras-GTP and the activation of two downstream signaling pathways of Ras, ERK1/2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Inhibition of Ras or ERK1/2, but not phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, effectively suppresses the foci formation induced by p200 RhoGAP, suggesting that the Ras-ERK pathway is required for p200 RhoGAP-mediated cell transformation. p200 RhoGAP co-localizes with p120 RasGAP in cells and forms a complex with p120 RasGAP, and this interaction is mediated by the C-terminal region and the Src homology 3 domain of p200 RhoGAP and p120 RasGAP, respectively. Mutations of p200 RhoGAP that disrupt interaction with p120 RasGAP abolish its Ras activation and cell transforming activities. Interestingly, the RhoGAP activity of the N-terminal RhoGAP domain in p200 RhoGAP is also required for its full transforming activity, and expression of a dominant negative RhoA mutant that blocks RhoA cycling between the GDP- and GTP-bound states suppresses p200 RhoGAP transformation. These results suggest that a Rho GTPase-activating protein may have a positive input to cell proliferation and provide evidence that p200 RhoGAP can mediate cross-talks between Ras- and Rho-regulated signaling pathways in cell growth regulation. p200 RhoGAP, a member of the Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) family, was previously implicated in the regulation of neurite outgrowth through its RhoGAP activity.

Rho GTPases are intracellular binary molecular switches cycling between the active, GTP-bound and the inactive, GDP-bound states (1Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3794) Google Scholar, 2Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 3Mackay D.J. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Upon activation, Rho GTPases interact with a large number of downstream effectors that regulate a variety of cellular processes, including actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, transcriptional activation, cell growth, cell survival, and vesicle trafficking (4Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar, 5Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar). The cycling between the GDP- and GTP-bound states of Rho GTPases is thought to be regulated by at least three distinct families of regulatory proteins; the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 2The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine-nucleotide exchange factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SH2, Src homology 2; SH3, Src homology 3; CS, calf serum; HA, hemagglutinin; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; RBD, Ras binding domain; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.2The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine-nucleotide exchange factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SH2, Src homology 2; SH3, Src homology 3; CS, calf serum; HA, hemagglutinin; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; RBD, Ras binding domain; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. promote GDP release and GTP binding (6Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), the Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors sequester Rho GTPases in the GDP bound states and interfere with their membrane association (7Olofsson B. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), and Rho GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) accelerate the intrinsic GTP-hydrolytic activity to produce the GDP-bound, inactive Rho GTPases (8Moon S.Y. Zheng Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar).RhoGAPs are defined by the presence of a conserved, ∼150-amino acid sequence termed the RhoGAP domain. The RhoGAP domain is necessary and sufficient for binding to the GTP-bound Rho GTPases and stimulating their GTPase activity (8Moon S.Y. Zheng Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). In addition to the RhoGAP domain, multiple functional domains are found in RhoGAPs that are expected to participate in the spatiotemporal regulation of RhoGAP function. In particularly, SH3 domains and proline-rich motifs are frequently present in RhoGAP family members and may recruit intracellular protein partners to modulate RhoGAP domain activity (9Peck J. Douglas IV, G. Wu C.H. Burbelo P.D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). So far most studies of RhoGAPs have heavily relied on the expression of the RhoGAP domain in assessing their cellular functions. This approach can produce misleading results, since it is possible that full-length RhoGAP may display distinct cellular phenotypes from the RhoGAP domain, as is shown in the case for a Rac1-specific RhoGAP, n-chimaerin. Microinjection of the GAP domain of n-chimaerin inhibited Rac-stimulated lamellipodia formation, whereas full-length n-chimaerin cooperated with Rac1 to mediate lamellipodia and filopodia formation (10Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5069-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It is thus likely that additional functional motifs in individual RhoGAPs are important in mediating multiple protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions to elicit physiologically relevant cell activities.RhoGAPs are involved in various biological processes, such as neuronal morphogenesis, cell growth and transformation, and polarity establishment by down-regulation of Rho GTPases (8Moon S.Y. Zheng Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Given their role in GTP-hydrolysis of Rho GTPases, RhoGAPs are intuitively expected to play a negative, or “tumor suppressor,” role in cell proliferation. Several lines of observation support this possibility. First, RhoGAP-insensitive Rho GTPase mutants that are constitutively GTP-bound can induce transforming phenotype in NIH 3T3 cells. Subsequent transplantation of theses cells into nude mice can cause tumor formation (11Fort P. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1999; 22: 159-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 12Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Adv. Cancer Res. 2002; 84: 57-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Second, Ras and other oncogenes, such as Bcr-abl and Src, in part depend on Rho GTPase activities for transformation, and elevated Rho-GTP species have been associated with several human tumors, suggesting that increased Rho activities promote tumor cell proliferation, whereas decreased Rho activities may have a negative impact on cell growth (13Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 14Qiu R.G. Abo A. McCormick F. Symons M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3449-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Third, several reports have suggested that RhoGAPs may act as potential tumor suppressors by down-regulating Rho GTPase activities (15Yuan B.Z. Miller M.J. Keck C.L. Zimonjic D.B. Thorgeirsson S.S. Popescu N.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2196-2199PubMed Google Scholar, 16Borkhardt A. Bojesen S. Haas O.A. Fuchs U. Bartelheimer D. Loncarevic I.F. Bohle R.M. Harbott J. Repp R. Jaeger U. Viehmann S.

For example, overexpression of the RhoGAP domain of p190 RhoGAP inhibited Ras-induced transformation in fibroblasts (18Wang D.Z. Nur-E-Kamal M.S. Tikoo A. Montague W. Maruta H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2478-2484PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in a mouse model p190 RhoGAP suppressed platelet-derived growth factor-induced glioma formation (19Wolf R.M. Draghi N. Liang X. Dai C.

(23Nakazawa T. Watabe A.M. Tezuka T. Yoshida Y. Yokoyama K. Umemori H. Inoue A. Okabe S. Manabe T. Yamamoto T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2921-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We have shown that p200 RhoGAP is a Rho-specific GAP that is capable of inducing differentiation of neuronal cells through its GTPase-activating activity (24Moon S.Y. Zang H. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4151-4159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report a surprising finding that expression of full-length p200 RhoGAP in NIH 3T3 cells induces focus formation and anchorage-independent growth and enhances cell proliferation under low serum conditions. The cell growth-promoting activity by p200 RhoGAP is in part mediated by Ras and ERK1/2 pathway activation, and this is associated with its ability to sequestrate p120 RasGAP through an interaction between their C-terminal region and SH3 domain, respectively. Beside the C terminus Ras activation effect, p200 RhoGAP also utilizes its N-terminal RhoGAP domain to down-regulate endogenous RhoA activity, thereby facilitating the GDP/GTP cycling of RhoA under serum stimulation to promote cell proliferation. Our results present a novel concept that a RhoGAP molecule could promote, rather than suppress, cell proliferation. Moreover, they raise an interesting possibility that RhoGAPs like p200 RhoGAP may functionally coordinate Ras and Rho signaling pathways in cell growth regulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructs—The cDNA encoding the RhoGAP domain of p200 that bears a mutation of arginine to lysine at the predicted catalytic arginine residue (residue 58) was generated by introducing a point mutation using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (25Li R. Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32830-32835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding the p200 RhoGAP domain (residues 1–251), the GAP domain containing the arginine mutation (GAP(R58K)), full-length p200 RhoGAP (residues 1–1738), the full-length p200 RhoGAP containing the arginine mutation (p200(R58K)), and the C-terminal region of p200 RhoGAP (p200-C; residues 224–1738) were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCEFL-GST using EcoRI and NotI sites as GST fusion proteins and into the pKH3 vector using the EcoRI site to be expressed as HA3 fusion proteins. In addition, serial deletion mutants of the proline-rich motifs in p200 RhoGAP, del1 (residues 1–842), del2 (residues 1–947), del3 (residues 1–989), del4 (residues 1–1052), and del5 (residues 1–1498), were also cloned into the pCEFL or pKH3 vectors. A GST fusion construct of the SH3 domain of Abl was kindly provided by Dr. Steve Taylor (University of California). The GST fusion construct encoding SH2-SH3-SH2 of p120 RasGAP was from Dr. Jeffrey Settleman (Harvard Medical School). The cDNA encoding the SH3 domain of p120 RasGAP was subcloned to pGEX-2T vector to be expressed as a GST fusion.Cell Transfection and Secondary Focus Formation Assay—NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum (CS) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Stable transfection in NIH 3T3 cells was carried out with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 48 h after transfection, the medium was changed to DMEM containing 10% calf serum and G418 (400 μg/ml) (Cellgrow). The cells were grown for 14 days in the selection medium, and the resulting single colonies were isolated for passage as clonal lines. The cell lines were maintained in the presence of G418 (250 μg/ml). For the secondary focus-forming assay, 50 × 103 wild-type NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were mixed with 5 × 103 cells from the cloned cell lines and plated on a 100-mm cell culture dish. The cultures were sustained for 2 weeks with medium changes every other day. The cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with methanol, and stained with Giemsa staining solution (1:20 dilution in H2O) (Sigma). A Canon imaging system was used to take the photos of the stained dishes. Transient transfection of NIH 3T3 cells was carried out with FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according the manufacturer's protocol. The transfected cells were changed into fresh medium 48 h after transfection and were used directly for the indicated assays. The efficiency of the transient transfection reaction routinely reached 50–70% of the cell populations as estimated by anti-HA or anti-GST immunofluorescent staining of the transfected cells.Anchorage-independent Growth Assay—Stably transfected NIH 3T3 cells with pCEFL-GST p200 RhoGAP clones were mixed in 0.3% agarose with 10% calf serum-DMEM and plated on top of 0.6% agarose-coated 35-mm dishes. Fresh agarose media were added every week for 2–3 weeks. Images of foci grown in the soft agar were obtained under a phase-contrast microscope with ×40 magnification. The quantifications of foci were from three independent experiments.Cell Proliferation and DNA Content Analysis—The growth rates of the cloned cell lines were determined as described by Qiu et al. (26Qiu R.G. Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11781-11785Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Briefly, 105 cells were plated in 6-well plates in the presence of 10% calf serum and changed to 0.5% calf serum on the next day. Cell numbers at different time points were determined using a hemocytometer. Data were gathered from three independent experiments. Cell saturation densities were determined as described before (29Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23633-23641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 30Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar).The DNA content analysis was carried out as previously described (27Krishan A. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 66: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were resuspended in buffer containing 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 0.05 mg/ml propidium iodide, 0.02 mg/ml RNase and incubated for 30 min on ice. The cells were collected by a brief centrifugation and were resuspended in fresh buffer. The cells were then passed through a 27-gauge needle several times and filtered through 37-μm nylon mesh immediately before flow analysis. The flow analysis was performed using FACScalibur (BD Biosciences) according to the DNA analysis template provided by the manufacturer, and the results were analyzed by the CellQuest program.Ras, Cdc42, RhoA, and Rac1 Activity Assays—Various HA-tagged p200 RhoGAP constructs were transiently transfected into NIH 3T3 cells. After 48 h, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) for 15 min at 4 °C. The extracts were sonicated followed by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 10 min). Active Ras, RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1 levels were determined by performing the effector domain pull-down assays using the GST-Ras binding domain (RBD) domain of c-Raf1 for Ras-GTP, the GST-RBD domain of Rhotekin for RhoA-GTP, and the GST-p21-binding domain of PAK1 for Rac1-GTP and Cdc42-GTP. The levels of active Ras, Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA were detected by Western blotting with monoclonal anti-Ras, anti-Cdc42, and anti-Rac1 antibodies (BD Transduction Laboratories) and a monoclonal anti-RhoA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), respectively.Immunoprecipitation—Transiently transfected cells were incubated in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml aprotinin) for 15 min at 4 °C. The extracts were clarified by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 10 min). To precipitate GST fusion proteins expressed in NIH 3T3 cells, glutathione-agarose or anti-GST beads (Sigma) were incubated with the cell extracts for 2 h at 4°C on a tumbler. To immunoprecipitate HA-tagged proteins in the cell lysates, monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science) and protein A/G agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were incubated with the cell extracts for 2 h at 4°C on a tumbler. The precipitates were washed three times with the lysis buffer and once with the buffer without Triton X-100.GST-fused SH3 domain or the SH2-SH3-SH2 module from p120 RasGAP, the SH3 domain from Abl, and GST alone were expressed in Escherichia coli using the pGEX-2T vector. These proteins were purified by using glutathione-agarose beads from the bacterial extracts. When necessary, the GST fusion proteins were eluted with 20 mm glutathione in 100 mm Tris base (pH 8.5–9.0) and 100 mm NaCl. Protein concentrations were measured by using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad).Western Blot Analysis—For Western blot analysis, cell lysates or co-precipitates were separated in 4–15% gradient or 12% gels and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and probed with primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody for enhanced chemiluminescence analysis (Amersham Biosciences). The anti-GST antibody was purchased from Sigma, the anti-HA antibody was from Roche Applied Science, and the anti-p120 antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories. Anti-ERK, anti-phospho-ERK, anti-Akt, and anti-phospho-Akt antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (New England Biolabs). All primary antibodies were diluted (1:1000) in TBS-T buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) or horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) were used as secondary antibodies.Immunocytochemistry—p200 RhoGAP-expressing NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in either DMEM with 10% calf serum or serum-free DMEM overnight. The cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature, and incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. The cells were then incubated with polyclonal anti-p120 RasGAP (BD Transduction Laboratories) and monoclonal anti-GST antibodies (Sigma), washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and stained with TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies, respectively (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Cells subject to the transient transfection of pKH3-p200 RhoGAP and pCEFL-p200 RhoGAP were incubated with monoclonal anti-HA and anti-GST antibodies, respectively, followed by TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). The fluorescent images were captured by using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope.Adenoviral and Retroviral Transductions—p200 RhoGAP-stably expressed NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% calf serum. Recombinant retroviruses were produced using the Phoenix cell packaging system by transient expression of relevant cDNAs cloned in the MIEG3 retroviral vector containing bicistronically expressed EGFP. The p200 RhoGAP-expressed NIH 3T3 cells were transduced with N19RhoA-expressing retrovirus and harvested 48–72 h postinfection. The EGFP-positive cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. In parallel, the p200 RhoGAP-expressed NIH 3T3 cells were infected with N17Ras and GFP-expressing adenovirus (a kind gift from Dr. Nancy Ratner, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center) and harvested 24 h postinfection. The efficiency of the adenoviral infection was over 90%.RESULTSEctopic Expression of p200 RhoGAP in NIH 3T3 Cells Induces Transformation—p200 RhoGAP was previously shown to be involved in the regulation of neurite outgrowth by exerting its RhoGAP activity (24Moon S.Y. Zang H. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4151-4159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the course of subsequent functional characterizations of p200 RhoGAP, we repeatedly found that ectopic expression of p200 RhoGAP in NIH 3T3 cells induced transforming foci (data not shown), and cell clones expressing p200 RhoGAP readily formed secondary foci among NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 1, A and B) and grew anchorage-independently in soft agar medium (Fig. 1, C and D). These observations suggest that p200 RhoGAP could cause cell transformation at appropriate expression levels.In addition to focus induction and anchorage-independent colony formation, the full-length p200 RhoGAP-expressing cells grew with significant advantages in low serum (0.5% CS) conditions (Fig. 2A), reached a saturation density almost double that of wild-type cells (Fig. 2B), and displayed significantly increased S-phase (2–3-fold) and G2/M (∼1.5-fold) phase populations during cell cycle progression (Fig. 2C). These observations were verified in multiple independently produced clones (two such clones are shown in Figs. 1 and 2). These results indicate that full-length p200 RhoGAP promotes, rather than suppresses, cell growth and that signaling pathways mediated by p200 RhoGAP can modulate cell contact inhibition, growth factor dependence, and cell cycle progression to favor cell growth transformation.FIGURE 2p200 RhoGAP expression promotes cell proliferation, increases saturation density, and accelerates cell cycle progression. A, full-length p200 and vector control NIH 3T3 cells were grown under low serum (0.5% CS) conditions. Two full-length p200-expressing cell clones and the vector (pCEFL-GST) control cells were plated at 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. Cell numbers were determined at the indicated times. B, saturation densities of the cells were determined by plating 106 cells/100-mm dish and culturing until the cells were confluent in the presence of 10% CS. Data were derived from a single well per point and are representative of three independent experiments. C, cell cycle distributions were measured using propidium iodide labeling and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Plots of cell counts versus PI fluoresecence (FL2-Area) were used to determine relative cell populations in G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)p200 RhoGAP Induces “Ras-like” Focus Morphology—Previous studies have shown that the morphologies of foci induced by activated Rho GTPases or oncogenic RhoGEFs are highly compact with refractile cells on the periphery, which are distinct from the more flat, spreading, and swirling morphology induced by activated Ras (28Khosravi-Far R.

Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We observed that the foci induced by full-length p200 RhoGAP are well spread, flat, and swirling, similar to those induced by oncogenic V12-H-Ras but different from those induced by onco-Dbl (Fig. 3). Under phase-contrast microscope, the morphology of p200 RhoGAP-expressing cells was also distinct from that of wild-type or vector-transfected NIH 3T3 cells with more compact cell shape (data not shown). These data raise the possibility that p200 RhoGAP may utilize Ras and Ras-associated pathways in inducing cell morphologic transformation.FIGURE 3Morphologies of foci induced by full-length p200 RhoGAP. Full-length p200 RhoGAP-expressing cells formed foci that are flat, large, and spread, similar to the V12-H-Ras-induced foci. Onco-Dbl induced foci appear more compact with highly refractile cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)p200 RhoGAP Increases Ras Activity and Requires ERK1/2 Activation for Transformation—To examine if p200 RhoGAP-induced cell transformation might involve Ras signaling pathways, Ras activity was measured in p200 RhoGAP-expressing cells and relevant control cells. The HA-tagged p200 RhoGAP expression in NIH 3T3 cells was detected by anti-HA blotting of the cell lysates, whereas the GTP-bound, active Ras was probed by using the immobilized RBD of cRaf-1 to form a stable complex with Ras-GTP followed by anti-Ras immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 4A, the amount of Ras-GTP was significantly increased when p200 RhoGAP was expressed under both serum-free and serum-stimulated conditions, suggesting that p200 RhoGAP regulates Ras activity independently of serum. Concomitant with elevated Ras-GTP in the p200 RhoGAP-expressing cells, two downstream effectors of Ras, AKT and ERK1/2, were activated by p200 as revealed by anti-phospho-AKT and -ERK1/2 blotting (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that p200 RhoGAP expression causes Ras and Ras-regulated AKT and ERK1/2 pathway activation.FIGURE 4Effect of p200 RhoGAP expression on the activities of Ras and Ras-regulated signaling pathways. A, NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged full-length p200 RhoGAP and a vector control. 48 h after transfection, the cell lysates were incubated with GST-tagged RBD domain of Raf1 immobilized on agarose beads. The co-precipitated Ras-GTP was detected by anti-Ras Western blotting. The amount of total Ras present in the control and the p200 RhoGAP expressing cells, the expression of HA-p200, and the GST-RBD domain of Raf1 as the probe were detected by anti-Ras, anti-HA, and anti-GST blottings, respectively. Anti-β-actin blotting was shown as the loading control. B, Western analysis (WB) shows p-ERK1/2 and p-AKT protein levels in the control and p200 RhoGAP-expressing cell lysates.

https://openalex.org/W2080081814,"Abstract Rad4TopBP1 is a scaffold in a protein complex containing both replication proteins and checkpoint proteins and plays essential roles in both replication and checkpoint responses. We have previously identified four novel fission yeast mutants of rad4+TopBP1 to explore how Rad4TopBP1, a single protein, can play multiple roles in genomic integrity maintenance. Among the four novel mutants, rad4-c17TopBP1 is a thermosensitive mutant. Here, we characterized rad4-c17TopBP1 and identified a rad4-c17TopBP1 allele specific suppressor named srr2+ (suppressor of Rad4TopBP1 R2 domain). srr2+ has previously been identified as an environmental stress-responsive gene (GenBank™ accession number AL049644.1, locus spcc191.01). srr2+ null cells are sensitive to hydroxyurea (HU) at elevated temperatures. Deletion of srr2+ in rad4-c17TopBP1 exacerbates the HU sensitivity of the mutant. Overexpression of srr2+ suppresses the rad4-c17TopBP1 mutant sensitivity to temperature and HU and restores the compromised ability of rad4-c17TopBP1 to activating Cds1 kinase in response to HU treatment. Furthermore, stress-activated MAPK, Spc1 (also known as StyI or Phh1), induces the expression and phosphorylation of the Srr2 protein. Significantly, environmental stress induces co-precipitation of Srr2 protein with Rad4TopBP1, and the co-precipitation is compromised in the rad4-c17TopBP1 mutant. These results have led us to propose a model; Rad4TopBP1 exists in a large protein complex to coordinate genomic perturbations with checkpoint responses to maintain genomic integrity. In addition, when cells experience environmental stress, Rad4TopBP1 associates with Srr2, an Spc1 MAPK-responsive protein, to survive the stress, potentially by providing a link of the Spc1 MAPK response to checkpoint responses."
