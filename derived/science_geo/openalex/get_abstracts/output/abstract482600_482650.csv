Activation of alternative regulated cell death mechanisms may be beneficial for treating diseases such as cancer, in which apoptotic cell death mechanisms are suppressed due to genetic alterations. Indeed, activation of alternative cell death pathways may overcome the drug resistance associated with existing chemotherapeutic agents, providing new drug targets. Regulators of apoptosis have been targeted with small molecules to induce cell death in cancer cells (Cotter, 2009Cotter T.G. Apoptosis and cancer: the genesis of a research field.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Recently, regulated, nonapoptotic cell death processes have been discovered, including necroptosis (Degterev et al., 2005Degterev A. Huang Z. Boyce M. Li Y. Jagtap P. Mizushima N. Cuny G.D. Mitchison T.J. Moskowitz M.A. Yuan J. Chemical inhibitor of nonapoptotic cell death with therapeutic potential for ischemic brain injury.Nat. Chem.

Ferroptosis is a mode of cell death involving the production of iron-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS). In engineered human fibroblast cell lines, the small molecule erastin was found to induce preferential lethality in cells overexpressing oncogenic HRAS (Dolma et al., 2003Dolma S. Lessnick S.L.

Erastin-induced ferroptotic cell death was distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy, based on morphological, biochemical, and genetic criteria. Ferroptosis involves metabolic dysfunction that results in the production of both cytosolic and lipid ROS, independent of mitochondria but dependent on NADPH oxidases in some cell contexts (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon S.J. Lemberg K.M. Lamprecht M.R. Skouta R. Zaitsev E.M. Gleason C.E. Patel D.N. Bauer A.J. Cantley A.M.

We have reported the identification of additional small molecules, named RSL3 (Yang and Stockwell, 2008aYang W.S. Stockwell B.R. Synthetic lethal screening identifies compounds activating iron-dependent, nonapoptotic cell death in oncogenic-RAS-harboring cancer cells.Chem. Biol. 2008; 15: 234-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), ML162, and DPI10 (Weïwer et al., 2012Weïwer M. Bittker J.A. Lewis T.A. Shimada K. Yang W.S. MacPherson L. Dandapani S. Palmer M. Stockwell B.R. Schreiber S.L. Munoz B. Development of small-molecule probes that selectively kill cells induced to express mutant RAS.Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2012; 22: 1822-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), that display oncogenic-RAS-synthetic-lethality (the RSL phenotype) in engineered fibroblast-derived tumorigenic cell lines. Here, we sought to test whether these and other compounds also induce ferroptosis, and whether they could be used to elucidate a central regulator of ferroptosis, which controls cell death by all FIN (ferroptosis inducing) compounds. We focused initially on erastin and RSL3. Erastin reprograms cancer cell metabolism by modulating VDAC2/VDAC3 (Yagoda et al., 2007Yagoda N. von Rechenberg M. Zaganjor E. Bauer A.J. Yang W.S. Fridman D.J. Wolpaw A.J. Smukste I. Peltier J.M. Boniface J.J. et al.RAS-RAF-MEK-dependent oxidative cell death involving voltage-dependent anion channels.Nature. 2007; 447: 864-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar) and system xc− (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon S.J. Lemberg K.M. Lamprecht M.R. Skouta R. Zaitsev E.M. Gleason C.E. Patel D.N. Bauer A.J. Cantley A.M. Yang W.S. et al.Ferroptosis: an iron-dependent form of nonapoptotic cell death.Cell. 2012; 149: 1060-1072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5632) Google Scholar) to trigger ferroptosis, whereas RSL3-induced ferroptosis is not dependent on these factors (Yang and Stockwell, 2008aYang W.S. Stockwell B.R. Synthetic lethal screening identifies compounds activating iron-dependent, nonapoptotic cell death in oncogenic-RAS-harboring cancer cells.Chem. Biol. 2008; 15: 234-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar) but results in a similar downstream cell death phenotype. Thus, we viewed erastin and RSL3 as ideal probes to elucidate conserved downstream regulators of ferroptosis. We used metabolomic profiling to evaluate comprehensively changes in metabolism occurring upon erastin treatment, and chemoproteomics to identify candidate target proteins for RSL3, which led to the discovery of a common pathway regulating cell death in response to all known compounds that induce ferroptosis. To investigate the global changes in metabolism induced by erastin, we treated HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells with DMSO or erastin, and extracted polar and lipid metabolites. The metabolite extract was subjected to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis to determine the quantity 149 polar and 115 lipid metabolites (Table S1 available online; Figure 1A). Both reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) were depleted significantly upon erastin treatment, whereas the level of lysophosphatidyl cholines (lysoPCs) was increased; the increase in lysoPCs may reflect the generation of lipid ROS during erastin-induced ferroptosis because PCs have been found to be converted to lysoPCs (deacylated PCs) upon lipid oxidation (Parthasarathy et al., 1985Parthasarathy S. Steinbrecher U.P. Barnett J. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Essential role of phospholipase A2 activity in endothelial cell-induced modification of low density lipoprotein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1985; 82: 3000-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The significant depletion of GSH/GSSG was consistent with the fact that erastin induces the formation of ROS, causing an oxidative cell death. GSH/GSSG constitutes a major cellular antioxidant system and provides reducing equivalents to eliminate oxidative species. We treated three cell lines with erastin, determined GSH levels using Ellman’s reagent, and confirmed the dose-dependent, GSH-depleting effect of erastin (Figures 1B and S1A). We found that GSH depletion by erastin is necessary for erastin’s lethality because supplementing the culture medium with GSH or N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a biosynthetic precursor to GSH, prevented erastin-induced cell death (Figure S1B). We sought to test further whether the glutathione-depleting activity of erastin was essential for lethality. We established a synthetic route to create six erastin analogs (see Data S1 for synthesis) and tested these analogs for selective lethality in BJ-derived engineered cell lines (Figure 1C). Three compounds (MEII, PE, and AE) retained selective lethality, whereas three compounds (A8, PYR, and dMK) were not lethal (Figure 1C). Lethal analogs of erastin depleted cellular GSH more effectively than nonlethal analogs of erastin (Figure 1D), which further suggested that the GSH-depleting activity of erastin is necessary for erastin lethality. We reasoned that, if GSH depletion was contributing to erastin’s lethality, then GSH depletion by other reagents might partially mimic erastin’s selective lethality in the BJ-cell line system, which consists of isogenic cell lines (two with and two without oncogenic HRAS), through which ferroptosis-inducing compounds such as erastin were discovered. When the four BJ-derived cells were treated with BSO, an oncogenic HRAS-selective lethal phenotype was observed under conditions of low cell density (Figure 1E), suggesting that GSH depletion is sufficient for induction of ferroptosis in BJ cells with oncogenic HRAS overexpression, although additional factors may enhance the potency and efficacy of the lethality caused by GSH depletion under more general circumstances. These results indicated that erastin depletes GSH through preventing cystine uptake via inhibition of system xc− (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon S.J. Lemberg K.M. Lamprecht M.R. Skouta R. Zaitsev E.M. Gleason C.E. Patel D.N. Bauer A.J. Cantley A.M. Yang W.S. et al.Ferroptosis: an iron-dependent form of nonapoptotic cell death.Cell. 2012; 149: 1060-1072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5632) Google Scholar). Given that we found GSH depletion to be critical for erastin-induced ferroptosis, we investigated how GSH depletion by erastin was able to induce selective lethality in the engineered BJ cell lines. It has been hypothesized that most cancer cells, including RAS-transformed fibroblasts (Irani et al., 1997Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Mitogenic signaling mediated by oxidants in Ras-transformed fibroblasts.Science. 1997; 275: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar), are under high levels of oxidative stress (Szatrowski and Nathan, 1991Szatrowski T.P. Nathan C.F. Production of large amounts of hydrogen peroxide by human tumor cells.Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 794-798PubMed Google Scholar), which therefore needs to be counteracted by increasing the ROS-scavenging capacity, to prevent oxidative damage (Hussain et al., 2003Hussain S.P. Hofseth L.J. Harris C.C. Radical causes of cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). In this model, targeting ROS-scavenging systems through multiple points, including GSH depletion, would cause an imbalance in this equilibrium, leading to oxidative cell death (Trachootham et al., 2006Trachootham D. Zhou Y. Zhang H. Demizu Y. Chen Z. Pelicano H. Chiao P.J. Achanta G. Arlinghaus R.B. Liu J. Huang P. Selective killing of oncogenically transformed cells through a ROS-mediated mechanism by beta-phenylethyl isothiocyanate.Cancer Cell. 2006; 10: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). In order to test whether this simple hypothesis could explain erastin’s selective lethality, we examined basal ROS levels in the BJ-derived engineered cell lines using H2DCF, a cytosolic ROS sensor, and confirmed that BJeLR cells have modestly elevated ROS levels compared to BJeH (BJ-TERT) and BJeHLT (BJ-TERT/LT/ST) cells (Figure 2A). We then treated the four BJ-derived cell lines with an SOD inhibitor (DETC), a thiol-reactive reagent (DIA), a thioredoxin reductase inhibitor (DCNB), or a catalase inhibitor (ATZ) (Figures 2B and S2). Three of these antioxidant inhibitors (DETC, DIA, and DCNB) killed BJ-derived cells, but they neither depleted GSH nor displayed selective lethality, which was in contrast to the two GSH-depleting reagents, erastin and BSO (Figures 2B, 2C, and S2). The results indicate that it is not possible to induce selective ferroptosis in the BJ-derived cell lines by simply targeting the antioxidant network. Instead, unique biochemical and metabolic changes downstream of GSH depletion were likely to be responsible for the selective induction of ferroptosis.Figure S2Testing of Compounds Targeting Cellular Antioxidant Systems in the Four BJ-Derived Cell Lines, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Dose-response curves for growth inhibition by antioxidant inhibitors in 4 BJ-derived cell lines.

Cells were treated with each compound for 24 hr. (B) The table lists the compounds used in the 4 BJ-derived cell line testing with the target information. Data are presented as mean ± SD; n = 3. The degree of GSH depletion upon erastin treatment in the four BJ cell lines was also examined (Figure 2D). We found that these four BJ-derived cell lines contained varying amounts of basal GSH in the absence of any treatment, as reported previously by Kang and Enger, 1992Kang Y.J. Enger M.D. Buthionine sulfoximine-induced cytostasis does not correlate with glutathione depletion.Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C122-C127PubMed Google Scholar, but were depleted of GSH to a similar extent upon erastin treatment. The concentration of erastin used in this experiment (10 μM) was lethal to BJeLR and DRD cells (expressing HRASV12) but was not lethal to BJeH and BJeHLT cells (with wild-type RAS), even upon prolonged incubation (Figure 2B). Therefore, the selective lethality among these cell lines was not caused by differential depletion of GSH or by differences in the basal level of GSH. We then treated BJeLR cells with either GSH-depleting reagents (erastin or BSO) or other antioxidant-targeting reagents (DETC, DIA, and DCNB), and stained cells with either BODIPY-C11, a membrane-targeted lipid ROS sensor, or H2DCF, a cytoplasmic ROS sensor, to detect changes in ROS accumulation upon compound treatment (Figure 2E). GSH-depleting reagents strongly increased BODIPY-C11 and H2DCF signals, whereas other antioxidant inhibitors did not increase the fluorescence signals from either ROS sensor, indicating that both cytosolic and lipid ROS levels were increased selectively by GSH depletion in the oncogenic HRAS-containing cell lines (Figure 2E). We considered that one consequence of GSH depletion could be inactivation of glutathione-dependent peroxidases (GPXs). GPXs catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides to water or the corresponding alcohols, using GSH as an essential cofactor (Brigelius-Flohé and Maiorino, 2013Brigelius-Flohé R. Maiorino M. Glutathione peroxidases.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1830: 3289-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). The total activity of GPXs in BJeLR cells was examined using tert-butylhydroperoxide (tBuOOH) as a substrate, by monitoring the rate of NADPH oxidation, which is coupled to the tBuOOH-reducing activity of GPXs in cell lysates. When BJeLR cell lysates treated with vehicle only (0.08% DMSO) were added to the GPX activity assay, we observed a decrease in the amount of NADPH, indicating that tBuOOH was reduced by GPXs in the cell lysate (Figure 2F). Treatment of BJeLR cells with antioxidant inhibitors (DETC, DIA, and DCNB) did not affect GPX activity because the rate of NADPH oxidation was similar to the vehicle-only-treated sample. When lysates from BJeLR cells that had been treated with GSH-depleting reagents (erastin or BSO) were analyzed, NADPH oxidation was prevented, indicating that GPXs were inactivated upon GSH depletion (Figure 2F). Taken together, these data indicate that erastin and BSO inactivate cellular GPXs, leading to the generation of cytoplasmic and lipid ROS. Other antioxidant inhibitors did not deplete GSH, an essential cofactor for GPX enzyme activity, and therefore, did not inhibit GPX activity and did not cause accumulation of peroxides. Having determined that erastin acts by depleting GSH and inhibiting GPXs, we examined the mechanism of action of RSL3, another ferroptosis inducer (Yang and Stockwell, 2008aYang W.S. Stockwell B.R. Synthetic lethal screening identifies compounds activating iron-dependent, nonapoptotic cell death in oncogenic-RAS-harboring cancer cells.Chem. Biol. 2008; 15: 234-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Cell death induced by erastin and RSL3 shared common ferroptotic features, such as iron, MEK, and ROS dependence; however, RSL3 was not dependent on VDAC2/VDAC3 or system xc− implying that a different initiating mechanism could converge on a similar form of ferroptotic cell death. We thus used RSL3 as a probe to illuminate the shared downstream mechanism involved in executing ferroptosis. When we examined cellular GSH levels during RSL3-induced cell death, we found that GSH remained unaffected by a lethal RSL3 concentration (2 μM) in BJeLR cells, which was in contrast to erastin’s effect (Figure 3A). However, BODIPY-C11 staining revealed the generation of lipid ROS in RSL3-treated BJeLR cells, which indicated that lipid oxidation is common to both erastin-induced and RSL3-induced ferroptotic cell death (Figure 3B). In order to understand the mechanistic basis of RSL3’s enigmatic induction of lipid ROS in the absence of GSH depletion, we used affinity-based chemoproteomics to identify candidate target proteins for RSL3. We discovered that the chloroacetamide moiety of RSL3 was essential for its activity and that replacement with other electrophiles resulted in a loss of potency (Table S2; see Data S1 for synthesis). These data suggested that RSL3 targets an enzyme with a nucleophilic active site, such as serine, threonine, cysteine, or selenocysteine. Despite the potential for promiscuous reactivity of the chloroacetamide, we discovered that only the (1S, 3R)-RSL3 diastereomer of RSL3 exhibited selective lethality in the BJ cell system, whereas the three other diastereomers of RSL3 lacked selectivity and were more than 100-fold less potent (Figures 3C and 3D; Table S2; Data S1 for synthesis). These results suggested that (1S, 3R)-RSL3 covalently binds to one or more proteins to induce the potent and selective lethality observed in BJ cells expressing HRASV12. Affinity reagents were synthesized by attaching an isobutyryl-protected fluorescein tag via a polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker to the phenyl substituent at the 1 position in the tetrahydro-β-carboline ring system of RSL3, which was found to tolerate structural modifications. Despite a loss in potency upon incorporation of the affinity tag, 10-fold oncogenic HRAS selectivity was retained for an affinity analog with the active (1S, 3R) stereochemistry, whereas an affinity analog with the (1R, 3R) stereochemistry showed no activity (Figures 3E and 3F; see Data S1 for synthesis). Samples for proteomic analysis were prepared by treating intact BJeLR cells with (1S, 3R)-RSL3-fluorescein (active probe treatment), (1R, 3R)-RSL3-fluorescein (inactive probe treatment), or (1S, 3R)-RSL3-fluorescein pretreated with free (1S, 3R)-RSL3 (competitor treatment). Treated cells were lysed, and fluorescein-tagged proteins were affinity purified using Sepharose beads coupled to an anti-fluorescein antibody. Eluted proteins were identified with a Synapt G2 HDMS mass spectrometer (Waters) using a quantitative label-free shotgun proteomic strategy with data-independent scanning (MSE) and ion mobility spectrometry (see Extended Experimental Procedures). Proteins enriched in “active probe” versus “inactive probe” and “active probe” versus “competitor” treatments were determined (Figure 3G). Three independent affinity preparations of each of these treatments were further subsampled in three LC-MS/MS analyses (Table S2). Candidates were chosen on the basis of (1) exhibiting enrichment in both active:inactive and active:competitor comparisons with p < 0.01 (with false discovery rate correction; see Extended Experimental Procedures) and (2) identification and quantitation by n > 2 tryptic peptides. This analysis ranked GPX4 (glutathione peroxidase 4, PhGPx) as the top candidate protein target for (1S, 3R)-RSL3 (Figure 3G; Table S2). It was intriguing that GPX4 was identified as the most highly ranked candidate in our unbiased chemoproteomic approach to find target proteins for RSL3 because erastin inhibited cellular GPX enzymes through GSH depletion (Figures 1 and 2). We confirmed that GPX4 was purified specifically by the affinity analog (1S, 3R)-RSL3-fluorescein, using fresh samples prepared from BJeLR cells treated with the active probe, the inactive probe, or the competitor as before, analyzed for GPX4 abundance by western blot (Figures 3H and S3A). In order to examine whether RSL3 binding to GPX4 inactivates the peroxidase activity of GPX4, we treated a clone of the COH-BR1 breast cancer cell line overexpressing GPX4 (L7G4), with (1S, 3R)-RSL3 or vehicle only, prepared cell lysates, and incubated them with 7α-cholesterol hydroperoxide (7α-cholesterol-OOH) to determine the rate of reduction to the corresponding alcohol (7α-cholesterol-OH). 7α-cholesterol-OOH is a specific substrate for GPX4; no other GPX enzyme can catalyze the reduction of 7α-cholesterol-OOH (Kriska and Girotti, 2005Kriska T. Girotti A.W. A thin layer chromatographic method for determining the enzymatic activity of peroxidases catalyzing the two-electron reduction of lipid hydroperoxides.J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2005; 827: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In vehicle-treated samples, 7α-cholesterol-OOH decreased over time in a GSH-dependent manner, due to reduction by GPX4 in the lysate. Upon treatment with (1S, 3R)-RSL3, however, no reduction of 7α-cholesterol-OOH was observed, indicating that GPX4 was inhibited by (1S, 3R)-RSL3 (Figure 3I; see Figure S3B for quantitation data). Treatment with the inactive diastereomer (1R, 3R)-RSL3 did not inhibit GPX4 activity (Figure S3C). We used another proteomics data analysis tool, Elucidator (Rosetta Biosoftware), and found that only GPX4 was a significantly enriched protein common to both TransOmics and Elucidator analysis algorithms (Figure S3D). Evaluation of other candidates using specific siRNAs and shRNAs failed to show either modulation of (1S, 3R)-RSL3 sensitivity or cell killing (Figures S3E–S3I), which excludes the functional role of these other binding proteins on ferroptosis induced by (1S, 3R)-RSL3. We hypothesized that, if RSL3 were to inhibit a protein essential for cancer cell viability, then reducing the levels of this protein would sensitize cells to RSL3. Silencing of GPX4 mRNA using shRNAs that cause partial knockdown of GPX4 strongly sensitized cells to (1S, 3R)-RSL3 (Figure 4A). Conversely, when we overexpressed GPX4, we found that it caused strong resistance to (1S, 3R)-RSL3 lethality (Figure 4B), as expected for a relevant target protein. We were able to achieve a more effective knockdown of GPX4 using a pool of siRNAs targeting GPX4 (20-fold decrease in the GPX4 mRNA; Figure S4A) compared to a single clone of shRNA (5-fold decrease in the GPX4 mRNA; Figure 4A). With this more effective knockdown, HT-1080 cells underwent cell death with accompanying lipid ROS generation (Figure 4C). Cell death induced by siGPX4 was rescued by the same suppressors of RSL3—an iron chelator (DFOM), a MEK inhibitor (U0126), and an antioxidant (vitamin E [Vit. E])—which suggested that GPX4 knockdown induced ferroptotic cell death (Figure 4D) similar to RSL3. None of these ferroptosis inhibitors suppressed cell death induced by siDeath, a control siRNA pool targeting multiple essential genes, highlighting the ferroptosis-specific action of these inhibitors (Figure 4D). Furthermore, siGPX4 induced selective cell death in BJeLR and DRD cells (with HRASV12), but not BJeH and BJeHLT cells (wild-type HRAS), which recapitulated the selective lethality of erastin and RSL3 (Figures 4E and S4B). These data suggested that GPX4 is the primary target of RSL3, mediating its ability to induce ferroptosis specifically in the oncogenic HRAS-containing BJ-derived fibroblasts. There are eight isoforms of GPXs in humans with different tissue expression and substrate specificities. In BJeLR cells, six GPX isoforms are expressed (GPX1, GPX2, GPX3, GPX4, GPX7, and GPX8) as determined by RT-qPCR (Figure S4C). Knockdown of each isoform affected cell viability to varying levels; however, GPX4 knockdown was the most lethal to BJeLR cells, which highlights the prominent role of GPX4 inhibition in inducing cell death, as compared to other GPX enzymes (Figures 4F and S4D). Taken together, these data suggest that GPX4 is a central regulator of ferroptosis induced by erastin and RSL3. Cell death was enhanced in the BJ-derived cell lines expressing HRASV12 due to the increased basal ROS (Figure 2A) and enhanced lipid peroxidation after GPX4 inhibition, which caused selective lethality in this engineered isogenic cell line model. In a larger screening campaign to find additional FIN compounds, 14 candidate compounds were discovered out of more than a million tested (Figure 5A; see Figure S5 for structures) (Weïwer et al., 2012Weïwer M.

https://openalex.org/W2237953221,"Three-dimensional (3D) topological Dirac semimetals (TDSs) represent a novel state of quantum matter that can be viewed as '3D graphene'. In contrast to two-dimensional (2D) Dirac fermions in graphene or on the surface of 3D topological insulators, TDSs possess 3D Dirac fermions in the bulk. The TDS is also an important boundary state mediating numerous novel quantum states, such as topological insulators, Weyl semi-metals, Axion insulators and topological superconductors. By investigating the electronic structure of Na3Bi with angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we discovered 3D Dirac fermions with linear dispersions along all momentum directions for the first time. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the 3D Dirac fermions in Na3Bi were protected by the bulk crystal symmetry. Our results establish that Na3Bi is the first model system of 3D TDSs, which can also serve as an ideal platform for the systematic study of quantum phase transitions between rich novel topological quantum states."

Compelling evidence now suggests that dynamic regulation of DNA methylation is mainly achieved through a cyclic enzymatic cascade comprised of cytosine methylation, iterative oxidation of methyl group by TET dioxygenases, and restoration of unmodified cytosines by either replication-dependent dilution or DNA glycosylase-initiated base excision repair. In this review, we discuss the mechanism and function of DNA demethylation in mammalian genomes, focusing particularly on how developmental modulation of the cytosine-modifying pathway is coupled to active reversal of DNA methylation in diverse biological processes. Methylation of cytosines in the mammalian genome represents a key epigenetic modification and is dynamically regulated during development. Compelling evidence now suggests that dynamic regulation of DNA methylation is mainly achieved through a cyclic enzymatic cascade comprised of cytosine methylation, iterative oxidation of methyl group by TET dioxygenases, and restoration of unmodified cytosines by either replication-dependent dilution or DNA glycosylase-initiated base excision repair. In this review, we discuss the mechanism and function of DNA demethylation in mammalian genomes, focusing particularly on how developmental modulation of the cytosine-modifying pathway is coupled to active reversal of DNA methylation in diverse biological processes. It has long been recognized that cytosines in the genome, as part of the genetic code, also carry epigenetic information through chemical modification of its pyrimidine ring (Holliday and Pugh, 1975Holliday R. Pugh J.E. DNA modification mechanisms and gene activity during development.Science. 1975; 187: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, Riggs, 1975Riggs A.D. X inactivation, differentiation, and DNA methylation.Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1975; 14: 9-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dual functions associated with cytosines provide a means by which developmental stage- and cell-type-specific epigenetic memory can be directly deposited onto DNA itself (Bird, 2002Bird A. DNA methylation patterns and epigenetic memory.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 6-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). Methylation of the fifth position of cytosine (5-methylcytosine, 5mC) is a highly conserved epigenetic modification of DNA found in most plant, animal and fungal models (Law and Jacobsen, 2010Law J.A. Jacobsen S.E. Establishing, maintaining and modifying DNA methylation patterns in plants and animals.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 204-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) and has a profound impact on genome stability, gene expression, and development (Jaenisch and Bird, 2003Jaenisch R. Bird A.

In mammals, new DNA methylation pattern is established by de novo DNA methyltransferases, DNMT3A and DNMT3B (Okano et al., 1999Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E.

Xie S. Li E. Cloning and characterization of a family of novel mammalian DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferases.Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) (Figures 1A and 1B ). Their activity can be modulated by a catalytically inactive family member, DNMT3L (Goll and Bestor, 2005Goll M.G. Bestor T.H. Eukaryotic cytosine methyltransferases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 481-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). In somatic cells, 5mC is primarily restricted to palindromic CpG dinucleotides, which are typically methylated in a symmetric manner (de novo methylation in Figure 2A). Methylation of cytosine in non-CpG context (CpH, H = A, T, C) is prevalent in plants (Law and Jacobsen, 2010Law J.A. Jacobsen S.E. Establishing, maintaining and modifying DNA methylation patterns in plants and animals.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 204-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) but is rare in most mammalian cell-types. Recent work suggests that non-CpG methylation is relatively abundant in oocytes, pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and mature neurons (Lister et al., 2013Lister R. Mukamel E.A. Nery J.R.

Of the roughly 28 million CpGs in the human genome, 60%–80% are methylated in somatic cells (Smith and Meissner, 2013Smith Z.D. Meissner A. DNA methylation: roles in mammalian development.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2013; 14: 204-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). During mitosis, the global CpG methylation pattern is faithfully maintained in daughter cells through the action of maintenance DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 and its obligate partner, the ubiquitin-like plant homeodomain and RING finger domain 1 (UHRF1), which preferentially recognizes hemimethylated CpGs (Bostick et al., 2007Bostick M.

Such inheritability of CpG methylation suggests a role for 5mC in long-term epigenetic regulation required for diverse biological processes, such as stable silencing of gene expression, maintenance of genome stability, and establishment of genomic imprinting (Bird, 2002Bird A.

Although DNA methylation pattern in somatic cells is stably maintained, genome-wide loss of 5mC, or DNA demethylation, has been observed in specific developmental stages such as preimplantation embryos and developing primordial germ cells (PGCs) (Hajkova et al., 2002Hajkova P.

Epigenetic events in mammalian germ-cell development: reprogramming and beyond.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Global DNA demethylation is important for setting up pluripotent states in early embryos and for erasing parental-origin-specific imprints in developing PGCs (Feng et al., 2010bFeng S. Jacobsen S.E. Reik W. Epigenetic reprogramming in plant and animal development.Science. 2010; 330: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Mounting evidence indicates that the rapid erasure of 5mC during these two major waves of epigenetic reprogramming could not be fully explained by replication-dependent passive loss of 5mC, suggesting the existence of enzymatic activities capable of actively removing or modifying methyl groups on cytosines (Wu and Zhang, 2010Wu S.C. Zhang Y. Active DNA demethylation: many roads lead to Rome.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). However, a unifying mechanistic understanding of active DNA demethylation processes in mammalian cells did not emerge until recently. As we will discuss below, the transformative discovery of ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins as 5mC oxidase has provided major insights into mechanisms of active DNA demethylation. The biochemical basis of TET enzymes in oxidative modification of 5mC has recently been reviewed elsewhere (Kohli and Zhang, 2013Kohli R.M. Zhang Y. TET enzymes, TDG and the dynamics of DNA demethylation.Nature. 2013; 502: 472-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, Pastor et al., 2013Pastor W.A. Aravind L. Rao A. TETonic shift: biological roles of TET proteins in DNA demethylation and transcription.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 341-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this review, we focus on an integrated understanding of mechanisms, genomics, and biological functions of mammalian DNA demethylation process. First, we summarize the current mechanistic understanding of passive and active DNA demethylation pathways. Second, we examine the recent advances in development of genomic mapping technologies for 5mC oxidation derivatives as well as the understanding of potential regulatory functions of oxidized cytosine bases in the mammalian genome. Finally, we discuss how distinct modes of DNA demethylation dynamics can be achieved through modulation of the cytosine-modifying enzymatic pathway to satisfy the needs of diverse biological processes. DNA demethylation can take place either passively or actively. Upon DNA replication, the maintenance machinery DNMT1/UHRF1 restores the symmetrical CpG methylation pattern by methylating the unmodified cytosine in the nascent DNA strand (Bostick et al., 2007Bostick M. Kim J.K. Estève P.O. Clark A. Pradhan S. Jacobsen S.E. UHRF1 plays a role in maintaining DNA methylation in mammalian cells.Science. 2007; 317: 1760-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, Sharif et al., 2007Sharif J. Muto M. Takebayashi S. Suetake I. Iwamatsu A. Endo T.A. Shinga J. Mizutani-Koseki Y. Toyoda T. Okamura K. et al.The SRA protein Np95 mediates epigenetic inheritance by recruiting Dnmt1 to methylated DNA.Nature. 2007; 450: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Passive loss of 5mC can therefore be achieved through successive cycles of DNA replication in the absence of functional DNMT1/UHRF1 (passive dilution of 5mC [PD] in Figure 2A). One example of replication-dependent passive loss of 5mC is the global erasure of 5mC in the maternal genome during mouse preimplantation development (see below). Compelling evidence indicates that 5mC can also be rapidly erased independently of DNA replication in specific biological settings in both plants and mammals (Law and Jacobsen, 2010Law J.A. Jacobsen S.E. Establishing, maintaining and modifying DNA methylation patterns in plants and animals.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 204-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, Wu and Zhang, 2010Wu S.C. Zhang Y. Active DNA demethylation: many roads lead to Rome.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Such change involves active DNA demethylation mechanisms, which require one or more enzymatic reactions to modify or remove 5mC. In flowing plants (e.g., Arabidopsis thaliana), active erasure of 5mC is mediated by the Demeter (DME)/repressor of silencing 1 (ROS1) family of DNA glycosylases and base excision repair (BER) machinery (Zhu, 2009Zhu J.K. Active DNA demethylation mediated by DNA glycosylases.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 143-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C). However, mammalian orthologs of DME/ROS1 enzymes have not been identified. Mammalian cells may therefore achieve active DNA demethylation using different mechanisms. Early efforts focused on testing various known DNA modifying proteins, such as DNA repair enzymes, cytosine deaminases, and DNA glycosylases (Box 1A). However, experimental evidence for these proposed candidates is often restricted to very specific biological settings, and in many cases the activity cannot be substantiated by follow-up studies (Ooi and Bestor, 2008Ooi S.K. Bestor T.H. The colorful history of active DNA demethylation.Cell. 2008; 133: 1145-1148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, Wu and Zhang, 2010Wu S.C. Zhang Y. Active DNA demethylation: many roads lead to Rome.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Thus, these studies did not reveal a consensus mechanistic framework for active DNA demethylation in mammals.Box 1Known and Putative Mechanisms of Active Erasure of 5-MethylcytosinesA. 5mC Oxidation-Independent Active DNA Demethylation Mechanisms1.Enzymatic Removal of the Methyl Group from 5mCThe most straightforward way to achieve DNA demethylation is direct removal of the methyl-group. However, this is a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction. One study proposed that methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) can catalyze such a reaction leading to the release of methanol, but other laboratories could not reproduce this finding and active erasure of paternal 5mC occurs normally in fertilized oocytes lacking Mbd2 (Wu and Zhang, 2010Wu S.C. Zhang Y. Active DNA demethylation: many roads lead to Rome.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). To date, no compelling evidence supports that this biochemical reaction could take place under physiological conditions.2.Nucleotide Excision Repair to Erase 5mCExcision repair of short genomic regions that contain methylated cytosine nucleotides can indirectly result in erasure of 5mC. There are two major DNA excision repair mechanisms to repair single-stranded DNA damage: base excision repair (BER) and nucleotide excision repair (NER). BER is used to correct damaged bases or mismatched base pairs (e.g., G:T mismatch), whereas NER can repair bulky DNA lesions formed by exposure to radiation or chemicals. Once the bulky DNA lesion is recognized, specific enzymatic activities introduce dual incisions flanking the damage region. The resulting single-stranded gap (usually 24–32 nucleotides) is then filled in by DNA repair polymerases and ligases. The Gadd45 (growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein 45) family of proteins was reported to stimulate active DNA demethylation via NER (Barreto et al., 2007Barreto G. Schäfer A. Marhold J. Stach D. Swaminathan S.K. Handa V. Döderlein G. Maltry N. Wu W. Lyko F. Niehrs C. Gadd45a promotes epigenetic gene activation by repair-mediated DNA demethylation.Nature. 2007; 445: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). While some evidence suggests that Gadd45 may induce active DNA demethylation in Xenopus laevis embryos and mammalian cells (Ma et al., 2009Ma D.K. Jang M.H. Guo J.U. Kitabatake Y. Chang M.L. Pow-Anpongkul N. Flavell R.A. Lu B. Ming G.L. Song H.

Cell. 2009; 33: 344-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), conflicting results were also reported (Jin et al., 2008Jin S.G. Guo C. Pfeifer G.P. GADD45A does not promote DNA demethylation.PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000013Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Gadd45a- and Gadd45b null mice are grossly normal and have no global alteration in DNA methylation levels (Engel et al., 2009Engel N. Tront J.S. Erinle T. Nguyen N. Latham K.E. Sapienza C. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Conserved DNA methylation in Gadd45a(-/-) mice.Epigenetics. 2009; 4: 98-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, Ma et al., 2009Ma D.K. Jang M.H. Guo J.U.

Neuronal activity-induced Gadd45b promotes epigenetic DNA demethylation and adult neurogenesis.Science. 2009; 323: 1074-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of Gadd45 in DNA demethylation remains uncertain.3.Direct Base Excision Repair of 5mC by DNA GlycosylasesActive DNA demethylation can be achieved by a DNA glycosylase that efficiently excises 5mC base from DNA. Strong genetic and biochemical evidence supports the use of this mechanism in plants (Zhu, 2009Zhu J.K. Active DNA demethylation mediated by DNA glycosylases.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 143-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Mammalian DNA glycosylases, including TDG and methyl-CpG binding domain-containing protein 4 (MBD4), were also proposed to have excision activity against 5mC (Zhu et al., 2000Zhu B. Zheng Y. Hess D. Angliker H. Schwarz S. Siegmann M. Thiry S. Jost J.P. 5-methylcytosine-DNA glycosylase activity is present in a cloned G/T mismatch DNA glycosylase associated with the chicken embryo DNA demethylation complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 5135-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, 5mC excision activity of these enzymes is significantly (30- to 40-fold) lower than their activity for T or U in T⋅G or U⋅G mismatches. In addition, Mbd4 null mice are viable and have normal DNA methylation pattern during development. Interestingly, Tdg null mice die around E12.5 and exhibit modest increase in level of 5mC at some CpG-rich gene promoters (Cortázar et al., 2011Cortázar D. Kunz C. Selfridge J. Lettieri T. Saito Y. MacDougall E. Wirz A. Schuermann D. Jacobs A.L. Siegrist F. et al.Embryonic lethal phenotype reveals a function of TDG in maintaining epigenetic stability.Nature. 2011; 470: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, Cortellino et al., 2011Cortellino S. Xu J. Sannai M. Moore R. Caretti E. Cigliano A. Le Coz M. Devarajan K. Wessels A. Soprano D. et al.Thymine DNA glycosylase is essential for active DNA demethylation by linked deamination-base excision repair.Cell. 2011; 146: 67-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Because TDG, but not MBD4, has robust activity toward 5fC and 5caC, it is likely that 5fC/5caC excision activity, instead of the marginal 5mC excision activity of TDG, is responsible for methylation defects observed in Tdg-deficient cells (see main text).4.Deamination and Repair of 5mC BaseDeamination of 5mC generates thymine and the resulting G⋅T mismatch can be repaired by multiple DNA glycosylases (e.g., TDG) and BER to replace the mismatched T with C. Activation-induced deaminase (AID)/APOBEC-family of cytidine deaminases are known to function in generating mutations in DNA and RNA, which are biologically important for antibody diversification in B cells and for RNA editing (Conticello, 2008Conticello S.G. The AID/APOBEC family of nucleic acid mutators.Genome Biol. 2008; 9: 229Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In vitro biochemical analysis suggests that AID/APOBEC could also deaminate 5mC to T (Morgan et al., 2004Morgan H.D. Dean W. Coker H.A. Reik W. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase deaminates 5-methylcytosine in DNA and is expressed in pluripotent tissues: implications for epigenetic reprogramming.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52353-52360Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). However, AID/APOBEC only efficiently acts on single-strand but not double-strand DNA (Bransteitter et al., 2003Bransteitter R. Pham P. Scharff M.D. Goodman M.F. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase deaminates deoxycytidine on single-stranded DNA but requires the action of RNase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 4102-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), and exhibit substantially lower activity on 5mC (10- to 20-fold) relative to cytosine, their canonical substrate (Nabel et al., 2012Nabel C.S. Jia H. Ye Y. Shen L. Goldschmidt H.L. Stivers J.T. Zhang Y. Kohli R.M. AID/APOBEC deaminases disfavor modified cytosines implicated in DNA demethylation.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition, AID- or APOBEC1-knockout mice exhibit the expected B cell and immunological defects, but are viable and fertile (Wu and Zhang, 2010Wu S.C. Zhang Y. Active DNA demethylation: many roads lead to Rome.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, studies in zebrafish embryos (Rai et al., 2008Rai K. Huggins I.J. James S.R. Karpf A.R. Jones D.A. Cairns B.R.

Dean W. Feng S. Cokus S.J. Andrews S. Pellegrini M. Jacobsen S.E. Reik W.

Reprogramming towards pluripotency requires AID-dependent DNA demethylation.Nature. 2010; 463: 1042-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), and iPSCs (Kumar et al., 2013Kumar R. DiMenna L. Schrode N. Liu T.C. Franck P. Muñoz-Descalzo S. Hadjantonakis A.K. Zarrin A.A. Chaudhuri J. Elemento O. Evans T.

Further studies are needed to clarify the exact biochemical mechanism and function of AID/APOBEC proteins in DNA demethylation. Moreover, de novo DNMTs have been reported to possess in vitro 5mC deaminase activity in the absence of the methyl-donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) (Métivier et al., 2008Métivier R. Gallais R.

Given that SAM is relatively abundant in all living cells and is a general methyl-group donor for many essential enzymes, the in vivo relevance of DNMT-mediated deamination of 5mC remains unknown (Ooi and Bestor, 2008Ooi S.K.

While it is proposed that the Fe-S radical SAM domain of ELP3 may be involved in the demethylation process (Wu and Zhang, 2010Wu S.C. Zhang Y. Active DNA demethylation: many roads lead to Rome.Nat.

These cytosine analogs may facilitate DNA demethylation by impairing the binding and/or activity of maintenance methylation machinery (DNMT1/UHRF1) during DNA replication. Compelling evidence suggests that this mechanism is used in the erasure of paternal genome methylation during preimplantation development as well as in the complete demethylation of imprinting control regions in developing PGCs (see main text).2.DNA Repair-Mediated Excision of Modified 5mCTDG-mediated excision of 5fC/5caC followed by BER. TET proteins further oxidize 5hmC to 5fC and 5caC, which can be efficiently excised by TDG and repaired by BER pathway. Multiple studies have biochemically validated this pathway (see main text). Compelling genetic and genomic evidence suggests that TET/TDG-mediated active DNA demethylation takes place in mouse ESCs, but how extensive this mechanism is utilized in vivo and in other cell-types is currently unknown.AID/APOBEC-mediated deamin"

Obesity has become a global epidemic, contributing to increases in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers. Generally, two broad categories of obesity are recognized: visceral (VISC) and subcutaneous (SubQ). The location where fat is deposited appears to have a great influence on the likelihood of an individual developing many of the sequelae of obesity (Gesta et al., 2007Gesta S. Tseng Y.H. Kahn C.R. Developmental origin of fat: tracking obesity to its source.Cell. 2007; 131: 242-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Importantly, VISC adiposity is strongly associated with increased mortality, even in individuals with a normal body mass index (Pischon et al., 2008Pischon T. Boeing H. Hoffmann K. Bergmann M. Schulze M.B. Overvad K. van der Schouw Y.T. Spencer E. Moons K.G. Tjønneland A. et al.General and abdominal adiposity and risk of death in Europe.N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 359: 2105-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar). SubQ adiposity, however, appears to be comparatively benign (Manolopoulos et al., 2010Manolopoulos K.N. Karpe F. Frayn K.N. Gluteofemoral body fat as a determinant of metabolic health.Int J Obes (Lond). 2010; 34: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The association between regional fat deposition and adverse health complications was first noted with pioneering clinical descriptions in the 1950s (Vague, 1956Vague J. The degree of masculine differentiation of obesities: a factor determining predisposition to diabetes, atherosclerosis, gout, and uric calculous disease.Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1956; 4: 20-34PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been recognized for centuries that men have a greater propensity for deposition of VISC fat, while premenopausal women have a greater tendency to accumulate fat in SubQ stores, though substantial variation exists in both sexes (Vague, 1947Vague J. La différenciation sexuelle; facteur déterminant des formes de l’obésité.Presse Med. 1947; 55: 339-340PubMed Google Scholar). The relationship between site of adipose tissue accumulation and metabolic disease has been shown in several animal models. Transgenic mice overexpressing 11-β HSD-1 in adipose tissue develop VISC obesity along with insulin resistance, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia (Masuzaki et al., 2001Masuzaki H. Paterson J. Shinyama H. Morton N.M. Mullins J.J. Seckl J.R. Flier J.S. A transgenic model of visceral obesity and the metabolic syndrome.Science. 2001; 294: 2166-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1527) Google Scholar). Conversely, transgenic mice overexpressing adiponectin or mitoNEET in adipose tissue develop remarkable SubQ obesity, but remain metabolically healthy (Kim et al., 2007Kim J.Y. van de Wall E. Laplante M. Azzara A. Trujillo M.E. Hofmann S.M. Schraw T. Durand J.L. Li H. Li G. et al.Obesity-associated improvements in metabolic profile through expansion of adipose tissue.J. Clin.

Med. 2012; 18: 1539-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The functional importance of these adipose depots has been directly demonstrated in studies showing metabolic benefit by transplantation of SubQ fat or surgical removal of VISC fat (Gabriely et al., 2002Gabriely I. Ma X.H. Yang X.M. Atzmon G. Rajala M.W. Berg A.H. Scherer P. Rossetti L. Barzilai N.

Yamamoto Y. Gesta S. Kahn C.R. Beneficial effects of subcutaneous fat transplantation on metabolism.Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 410-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). These divergent metabolic effects of different adipose depots have raised interest in the unique properties of VISC and SubQ fat. VISC fat is notable for having a substantial degree of inflammation when obesity is present. Originally recognized as the secretion of TNFα and other inflammatory cytokines from fat tissue of obese animals (Hotamisligil et al., 1993Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Adipose expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha: direct role in obesity-linked insulin resistance.Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6121) Google Scholar), it is now known that there is a broad increase in a variety of immune cells in obese fat (Weisberg et al., 2003Weisberg S.P. McCann D. Desai M. Rosenbaum M. Leibel R.L. Ferrante Jr., A.W. Obesity is associated with macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1796-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (7435) Google Scholar, Xu et al., 2003Xu H. Barnes G.T. Yang Q. Tan G. Yang D. Chou C.J. Sole J. Nichols A. Ross J.S. Tartaglia L.A. Chen H. Chronic inflammation in fat plays a crucial role in the development of obesity-related insulin resistance.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1821-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (5172) Google Scholar). On the other hand, SubQ fat is notable because it can easily “brown” when animals are stimulated with cold, β-adrenergic agonists, or other hormone-like stimuli (Vitali et al., 2012Vitali A. Murano I. Zingaretti M.C. Frontini A. Ricquier D. Cinti S. The adipose organ of obesity-prone C57BL/6J mice is composed of mixed white and brown adipocytes.J. Lipid Res. 2012; 53: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, Wu et al., 2013Wu J. Cohen P. Spiegelman B.M. Adaptive thermogenesis in adipocytes: is beige the new brown?.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 234-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). This browning includes the induction of UCP1 mRNA and protein, and expression of a gene program that gives rise to uncoupled respiration and heat production. Some stimuli, such as the genetic ablation of RALDH1, cause considerable browning of the VISC depots in mice (Kiefer et al., 2012Kiefer F.W. Vernochet C. O’Brien P. Spoerl S. Brown J.D. Nallamshetty S. Zeyda M. Stulnig T.M. Cohen D.E. Kahn C.R. Plutzky J. Retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 regulates a thermogenic program in white adipose tissue.Nat. Med. 2012; 18: 918-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), but this phenomenon is much less common than the browning of SubQ depots. It is now recognized that there are at least two distinct types of brown fat cells. Classical brown adipose tissue (BAT), epitomized by the interscapular depot in rodents, arises from a Myf5+, muscle-like cell lineage. PRDM16, a transcriptional regulatory protein, appears to control this muscle-brown fat decision between days 9–12 of gestation in mice (Lepper and Fan, 2010Lepper C. Fan C.M. Inducible lineage tracing of Pax7-descendant cells reveals embryonic origin of adult satellite cells.Genesis. 2010; 48: 424-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, Seale et al., 2008Seale P.

Erdjument-Bromage H. et al.PRDM16 controls a brown fat/skeletal muscle switch.Nature. 2008; 454: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar). The postnatal role of PRDM16 in classical BAT has not been studied. In contrast, the UCP1+ cells that emerge in white fat depots under certain stimuli, termed beige or brite cells, do not come from a Myf5+ lineage. However, PRDM16 also appears to be involved in the development and function of beige cells (Ohno et al., 2012Ohno H. Shinoda K. Spiegelman B.M. Kajimura S. PPARγ agonists induce a white-to-brown fat conversion through stabilization of PRDM16 protein.Cell Metab. 2012; 15: 395-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, Seale et al., 2011Seale P.

Invest. 2011; 121: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Hence, beige and classical brown fat cells both express PRDM16 and UCP1 but they are quite distinct cell types. Beige fat cells have now been cloned and characterized (Wu et al., 2012Wu J. Boström P. Sparks L.M. Ye L. Choi J.H. Giang A.H. Khandekar M. Virtanen K.A. Nuutila P. Schaart G. et al.Beige adipocytes are a distinct type of thermogenic fat cell in mouse and human.Cell. 2012; 150: 366-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar). Importantly, the depots of “brown fat” visualized in humans share more molecular properties with rodent beige fat than with classical BAT (Lidell et al., 2013Lidell M.E. Betz M.J. Dahlqvist Leinhard O. Heglind M. Elander L. Slawik M. Mussack T. Nilsson D. Romu T. Nuutila P. et al.Evidence for two types of brown adipose tissue in humans.Nat.

The kite-like structure in the interscapular region of human infants, however, seems to have characteristics of rodent classical BAT, and some classical brown fat cells may be retained in adult humans (Cypess et al., 2013Cypess A.M.

Med. 2013; 19: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Analysis of the relative physiological importance of the classical BAT versus the browning of white fat has been very difficult because many important browning agents, such as cold and β-adrenergic compounds, affect both types of brown fat cells. Similarly, while ablation of UCP1+ cells or mutation of Ucp1 illustrate the overall importance of brown fat in preventing obesity and diabetes in animals, the individual contributions of the two types of brown fat cells has been impossible to determine (Feldmann et al., 2009Feldmann H.M. Golozoubova V. Cannon B. Nedergaard J.

Development of obesity in transgenic mice after genetic ablation of brown adipose tissue.Nature. 1993; 366: 740-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Agents that affect browning of white fat selectively, including transgenic expression of PRDM16, have caused metabolic benefit, suggesting that browning of white tissues could be important (Seale et al., 2011Seale P. Conroe H.M. Estall J. Kajimura S. Frontini A. Ishibashi J. Cohen P. Cinti S. Spiegelman B.M. Prdm16 determines the thermogenic program of subcutaneous white adipose tissue in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been argued that there are insufficient beige cells to affect whole-body physiology under ambient conditions (Nedergaard and Cannon, 2013Nedergaard J. Cannon B. UCP1 mRNA does not produce heat.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1831: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We have now created an adipocyte-selective mutation in the Prdm16 gene that ablates the thermogenic program of beige fat cells, while leaving the classical BAT functionally intact. Mice lacking beige fat function develop obesity and insulin resistance when exposed to high-fat diet (HFD) and also develop hepatic steatosis. In addition, there is a striking change in the SubQ fat, which takes on many of the morphological and molecular characteristics of VISC fat. These data demonstrate that PRDM16 and beige fat cells are major regulators of systemic physiology. Moreover, PRDM16 determines some of the key functional differences between SubQ and VISC fat. PRDM16 is involved in the development and function of classical brown and beige adipocytes. To determine how PRDM16 might be involved in the function of different adipose tissues that are considered “white,” we measured mRNA levels in multiple SubQ and VISC fat depots and compared these to the classical interscapular brown fat. Prdm16 was significantly elevated in two SubQ depots (inguinal and axillary) relative to the very low levels of expression in two VISC depots (epididymal and mesenteric). As expected, the highest levels of expression were seen in interscapular BAT (Figure 1A). This depot enrichment was maintained in primary adipocytes differentiated in vitro from the inguinal SubQ or epididymal VISC stromal vascular fraction (SVF) (Figure 1B). Expression of Ucp1, the prototypical thermogenic gene, was also enriched across SubQ depots, consistent with the presence of beige adipocytes in these pads (Figures S1A and S1B available online). These data suggested that PRDM16 could play a role in multiple SubQ depots.Figure S1PRDM16 Deletion in Adipocytes Results in Altered Gene Expression, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A and B) qPCR analysis of Ucp1 mRNA from multiple adipose tissues from 8- to 10-week-old male wild-type mice (n = 9), normalized to mRNA expression in brown adipose tissue (A) or from in vitro differentiated primary adipocytes, normalized to mRNA expression in inguinal cells (n = 3) (B).(C) Targeting construct for PRDM16.(D) Metabolic characterization of male Adiponectin-Cre+ and wild-type control mice, n = 7 per group.(E) Normalized gene expression of thermogenic, brown adipose, and mitochondrial genes in visceral adipose tissue (F) from Adipo-PRDM16 KO and control mice at ambient temperature.

Mice were males, 6–8 weeks old, n = 5 per group. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. We generated a conditional Prdm16 allele (Prdm16lox/lox) by engineering loxP sites flanking exon 9, which we have shown to be required for mediating the effects of PRDM16 on thermogenic gene expression (Seale et al., 2008Seale P. Bjork B. Yang W. Kajimura S. Chin S. Kuang S. Scimè A. Devarakonda S. Conroe H.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. et al.PRDM16 controls a brown fat/skeletal muscle switch.Nature. 2008; 454: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar) (Figure S1C). We initially crossed Prdm16lox/lox mice to Zp3-cre mice to generate a germline deletion. As expected, these animals had craniofacial defects and died within 24 hr of birth, confirming that this mutation created a null allele of Prdm16 (Bjork et al., 2010Bjork B.C. Turbe-Doan A. Prysak M. Herron B.J. Beier D.R. Prdm16 is required for normal palatogenesis in mice.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19: 774-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We next crossed Prdm16lox/lox and Adiponectin-cre mice (Eguchi et al., 2011Eguchi J. Wang X. Yu S. Kershaw E.E. Chiu P.C. Dushay J. Estall J.L. Klein U. Maratos-Flier E. Rosen E.D. Transcriptional control of adipose lipid handling by IRF4.Cell Metab. 2011; 13: 249-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) to generate mice with an adipocyte-specific knockout (KO) of Prdm16 (Adipo-PRDM16 KO). This promoter expresses cre recombinase after the early developmental time point when the classical brown fat/muscle fate decision has been established (Lepper and Fan, 2010Lepper C. Fan C.M. Inducible lineage tracing of Pax7-descendant cells reveals embryonic origin of adult satellite cells.Genesis. 2010; 48: 424-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). We performed metabolic characterization of Adiponectin-cre mice and confirmed that the Cre recombinase is not likely to contribute to the KO phenotype (Figure S1D). Analysis of mRNA expression from multiple tissues confirmed that the deletion was specific to white and brown adipose tissues (Figure 1C). Notably, PRDM16 mRNA levels in epididymal fat trended downward in KO mice, though expression in this depot was at the margin of detection. The trend toward decreased Prdm16 in the kidney of KO mice may reflect expression in adipose tissue surrounding this organ. Western blotting of nuclear extracts showed a marked reduction of PRDM16 protein in both classical BAT and inguinal SubQ adipose tissue from KO mice (Figure 1D). PRDM16 protein was too low to detect in the VISC depots. PRDM16 deletion in the classical BAT resulted in a relatively normal pattern of gene expression (Figure 1E). The SubQ adipose tissue of Adipo-PRDM16 KO mice, however, showed reduced expression of a broad panel of thermogenic (Dio2, Pgc1a, and Ucp1), brown adipose identity (Cidea, Otop1, and PPARa), and mitochondrial electron transport genes (Coxiii, Cox5b, and Cox8b) (Figure 1F). There was no alteration in the expression of Pparg, which is a general marker of adipose differentiation. Ucp1 mRNA was reduced by 90% in the inguinal SubQ depot. This did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.14) due to the large variance in Ucp1 mRNA levels in control mice. Adipo-PRDM16 KO mice also had decreased expression of a few of these genes in VISC adipose tissue, compared to controls, though the absolute expression level of these genes was very low (Figure S1E). Since SubQ adipose tissues are particularly prone to inducing a thermogenic gene program (“browning”), we examined the effects of two potent stimuli: cold exposure and treatment with a β-adrenergic agonist. In interscapular BAT, the thermogenic program was induced similarly in both control and Adipo-PRDM16 KO animals following cold exposure or CL 316,243 (hereafter referred to as CL) treatment. There were some small but statistically significant differences in the induction of several genes with cold and CL treatment (Figures 2A and 2B ). In contrast, the very robust increase in the entire panel of thermogenic gene expression seen in control inguinal adipose tissues (cold: 74-fold induction of Ucp1, CL: > 400-fold induction of Ucp1) was almost completely blocked in KO animals (Figures 2C and 2D). A similar pattern showing selective effects in SubQ adipose tissue was seen with prolonged cold exposure for 6 days (Figures S2A and S2B). Ucp1 showed blunted induction in VISC adipose tissue of the Adipo-PRDM16 KO mice following CL treatment, though the levels of thermogenic genes were overall very low in this depot (Figure S2C).Figure S2PRDM16 Regulates Thermogenic Gene Expression In Vivo and In Vitro, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A and B) Normalized thermogenic gene expression in brown adipose tissue and subcutaneous adipose tissue from Adipo-PRDM16 KO and control mice either at room temperature or following 6 days at 4°C.

Data are presented as mean ± SEM. The morphology and UCP1 content of these adipose depots was also examined in control and Adipo-PRDM16 KO mice. No differences in UCP1 were seen in the BAT between mice of either genotype, with or without cold exposure (Figure 2E). The SubQ adipose tissue from Adipo-PRDM16 KO mice, however, contained larger adipocytes and fewer small, multilocular UCP1+ adipocytes (Figure 2E). Moreover, cold exposure resulted in the emergence of numerous small, multilocular UCP1+ adipocytes in controls, while KO mice showed no change in appearance relative to RT (Figure 2E). Of note, Adipo-PRDM16 KO mice showed no difference in core temperature following 6 hr (Figure S2D) or 96 hr at 4°C (36.04°C ± 0.19 in KOs versus 35.78°C ± 0.26 in controls, p = 0.44). This further indicates that these mice have little apparent defect in the function of BAT since ablation of classical BAT or UCP1 is associated with severe cold intolerance (Enerbäck et al., 1997Enerbäck S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.E. Kozak L.P. Mice lacking mitochondrial uncoupling protein are cold-sensitive but not obese.Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, Lowell et al., 1993Lowell B.B. S-Susulic V.

Development of obesity in transgenic mice after genetic ablation of brown adipose tissue.Nature. 1993; 366: 740-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). We next asked whether these changes in the thermogenic program of SubQ adipose tissue were cell autonomous. SubQ adipocytes from KO mice differentiated in vitro also showed a significant reduction in the expression of most thermogenic (81% reduction in Ucp1), brown fat identity (97% reduction in Cidea), and mitochondrial genes (80% reduction in Cox8b), strongly suggesting a cell-autonomous role for PRDM16 in browning (Figure S2E). Cells from Adipo-PRDM16 KO mice also showed a blunted response to stimuli that induce browning, such as isoproterenol and FGF21 (Figures S2F ad S2G) (Fisher et al., 2012Fisher F.M. Kleiner S. Douris N. Fox E.C. Mepani R.J. Verdeguer F. Wu J. Kharitonenkov A. Flier J.S. Maratos-Flier E. Spiegelman B.M.

Spiegelman B.M. Adaptive thermogenesis in adipocytes: is beige the new brown?.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 234-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Given the preferential effect of this PRDM16 deletion on thermogenic gene expression in beige adipocytes, we assessed the physiological effect of this ablation, using O2 consumption as a readout. SubQ and BAT pads were removed from mice and O2 consumption was measured. These assays were performed both in untreated animals and after 5 days of CL treatment. Importantly, O2 consumption in interscapular BAT was unchanged between KOs and controls in both basal and stimulated states (Figure 3A). In contrast, O2 consumption in SubQ adipose tissue from Adipo-PRDM16 KO mice was significantly reduced, both at baseline (36% reduced) and following stimulation with CL (49% reduced) (Figure 3B). O2 consumption in VISC adipose tissue was below the limit of detection in most animals. Assays in primary SubQ adipocytes showed a significant reduction in both total (33% reduced) and uncoupled (51% reduced) respiration in KO cells compared to controls (Figure 3C). Taken together, these results indicate that adipose-selective deletion of PRDM16 results in a large defect in a broad program of thermogenesis in SubQ adipose tissue, while classical BAT is relatively unaffected. This selective ablation of beige cell thermogenic function offered a unique opportunity to study the role of these cells and the browning of white fat on whole-body physiology."

https://openalex.org/W1989478912,"Coevolution of beneficial microorganisms with the mammalian intestine fundamentally shapes mammalian physiology. Here, we report that the intestinal microbe Bacteroides fragilis modifies the homeostasis of host invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells by supplementing the host’s endogenous lipid antigen milieu with unique inhibitory sphingolipids. The process occurs early in life and effectively impedes iNKT cell proliferation during neonatal development. Consequently, total colonic iNKT cell numbers are restricted into adulthood, and hosts are protected against experimental iNKT cell-mediated, oxazolone-induced colitis. In studies with neonatal mice lacking access to bacterial sphingolipids, we found that treatment with B. fragilis glycosphingolipids—exemplified by an isolated peak (MW = 717.6) called GSL-Bf717—reduces colonic iNKT cell numbers and confers protection against oxazolone-induced colitis in adulthood. Our results suggest that the distinctive inhibitory capacity of GSL-Bf717 and similar molecules may prove useful in the treatment of autoimmune and allergic disorders in which iNKT cell activation is destructive.PaperClip/cms/asset/d4219f70-74dd-427a-802c-c891a3155026/mmc4.mp3Loading ...(mp3, 3.05 MB) Download audio"
https://openalex.org/W2114409684,"Cells of the osteoblast lineage affect the homing and the number of long-term repopulating haematopoietic stem cells, haematopoietic stem cell mobilization and lineage determination and B cell lymphopoiesis. Osteoblasts were recently implicated in pre-leukaemic conditions in mice. However, a single genetic change in osteoblasts that can induce leukaemogenesis has not been shown. Here we show that an activating mutation of β-catenin in mouse osteoblasts alters the differentiation potential of myeloid and lymphoid progenitors leading to development of acute myeloid leukaemia with common chromosomal aberrations and cell autonomous progression. Activated β-catenin stimulates expression of the Notch ligand jagged 1 in osteoblasts. Subsequent activation of Notch signalling in haematopoietic stem cell progenitors induces the malignant changes. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Notch signalling ameliorates acute myeloid leukaemia and demonstrates the pathogenic role of the Notch pathway. In 38% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukaemia, increased β-catenin signalling and nuclear accumulation was identified in osteoblasts and these patients showed increased Notch signalling in haematopoietic cells. These findings demonstrate that genetic alterations in osteoblasts can induce acute myeloid leukaemia, identify molecular signals leading to this transformation and suggest a potential novel pharmacotherapeutic approach to acute myeloid leukaemia."

Our results highlight the importance of commensal control for lifespan of metazoans and identify SC-class PGRPs as longevity-promoting factors. Loss of proliferative homeostasis and regenerative capacity in high-turnover tissues is a hallmark of aging, yet the causes of this decline are only beginning to be understood. Chronic inflammation is associated with this loss of homeostasis and with increased cancer incidence in aging organisms (Grivennikov et al., 2010Grivennikov S.I. Greten F.R. Karin M.

This is particularly significant in barrier epithelia like the intestinal epithelium, which mount frequent and required immune responses to pathogenic microorganisms but also engage in mutually beneficial interactions with commensals that shape the host immune system and provide essential metabolic functions (Clemente et al., 2012Clemente J.C.

Changes in commensal populations (“dysbiosis”) are associated with disorders like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), autoimmune and allergic diseases, obesity and diabetes (Clemente et al., 2012Clemente J.C.

Zeissig S. Blumberg R.S. Inflammatory bowel disease.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 28: 573-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1482) Google Scholar). The effects of aging on the microbiota and the consequences of microbiome changes on tissue homeostasis in the aging intestine remain unclear. Recent studies that have characterized gut microbiota composition in the elderly have found that the microbiota of older people is different and more diverse than that of younger adults (Claesson et al., 2011Claesson M.J. Cusack S. O’Sullivan O. Greene-Diniz R. de Weerd H. Flannery E. Marchesi J.R. Falush D. Dinan T.

USA. 2011; 108: 4586-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar) and that microbiota composition in the elderly correlates significantly with measures of frailty and comorbidity (Claesson et al., 2012Claesson M.J.

O’Sullivan O. et al.Gut microbiota composition correlates with diet and health in the elderly.Nature. 2012; 488: 178-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (2106) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the inflammation associated with dysbiosis promotes the development of various age-related diseases of the host and that manipulating host/commensal interactions might be a viable avenue to promote healthy aging (Biagi et al., 2013Biagi E.

Better mechanistic insight into the interactions among the microflora, innate immune responses, and regenerative processes in the intestinal epithelium is thus key (Clemente et al., 2012Clemente J.C.

The impact of the gut microbiota on human health: an integrative view.Cell. 2012; 148: 1258-1270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). The Drosophila intestine is a productive model to characterize age-related changes in host-commensal interactions, innate immune signaling, and regenerative capacity (Buchon et al., 2013Buchon N.

In young flies, commensal bacteria maintain basal activation of JNK and Jak/Stat activities in ISCs, ensuring low levels of epithelial renewal (Buchon et al., 2009aBuchon N. Broderick N.A. Chakrabarti S. Lemaitre B. Invasive and indigenous microbiota impact intestinal stem cell activity through multiple pathways in Drosophila.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2333-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). In older flies, however, this stimulation of JNK and JAK/Stat signaling becomes deregulated, inducing the intestinal dysplasia described above. Accordingly, axenically aged flies have significantly fewer mitotic ISCs than conventionally reared animals, but the physiologic consequences of these changes have not yet been explored (Buchon et al., 2009aBuchon N. Broderick N.A. Chakrabarti S. Lemaitre B. Invasive and indigenous microbiota impact intestinal stem cell activity through multiple pathways in Drosophila.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2333-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the number of microorganisms found in the lumen of the gut significantly increases with age (Ren et al., 2007Ren C. Webster P. Finkel S.E. Tower J. Increased internal and external bacterial load during Drosophila aging without life-span trade-off.Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 144-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), suggesting that an age-related impairment in the ability to manage the intestinal microflora is the underlying cause of intestinal dysplasia and may limit lifespan. The causes of this impairment remain unclear. Management of the commensal flora and innate immune responses to pathogens are achieved primarily by two strategies acting in Drosophila ECs: expression and activation of dual oxidase (Duox), which initiates an oxidative burst response, producing high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Ha et al., 2009aHa E.M.

Here, we characterize the age-related breakdown of intestinal innate immune homeostasis in aging Drosophila. We identify an interaction between the transcription factor Foxo and the IMD/Rel pathway, driven by Foxo-mediated repression of peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) of the SC class that promotes commensal dysbiosis and epithelial dysplasia in aging guts. Strikingly, overexpressing PGRP-SC2 in ECs prevents age-associated dysbiosis and dysplasia and extends lifespan in conventionally, but not in axenically, reared animals. Our findings suggest that a breakdown of host/commensal interactions is central to age-associated tissue degeneration in barrier epithelia and identify strategies to promote tissue homeostasis by improving these interactions and extending lifespan. Because Drosophila lifespan is impacted by intestinal dysplasia (Biteau et al., 2010Biteau B. Karpac J. Supoyo S. Degennaro M. Lehmann R. Jasper H.

We first confirmed that age-related dysplasia was associated with increased microbial loads in various genetic backgrounds. We quantified overall microbial load by measuring colony-forming units (CFUs) in dissected guts of young and old age, using selective plates to identify Enterobacteriaceae, Lactobacillae, Acetobacteriaceae, and other bacteria grown on nutrient-rich medium (using these selective plates, the majority of the commensal microbiome of flies can be monitored) (Ryu et al., 2008Ryu J.H.

However, the underlying mechanisms of myelin wrapping have remained unclear. Using an integrative approach of live imaging, electron microscopy, and genetics, we show that new myelin membranes are incorporated adjacent to the axon at the innermost tongue. Simultaneously, newly formed layers extend laterally, ultimately leading to the formation of a set of closely apposed paranodal loops. An elaborated system of cytoplasmic channels within the growing myelin sheath enables membrane trafficking to the leading edge. Most of these channels close with ongoing development but can be reopened in adults by experimentally raising phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-triphosphate levels, which reinitiates myelin growth. Our model can explain assembly of myelin as a multilayered structure, abnormal myelin outfoldings in neurological disease, and plasticity of myelin biogenesis observed in adult life."
https://openalex.org/W2021415039,"Traumatic events generate some of the most enduring forms of memories. Despite the elevated lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders, effective strategies to attenuate long-term traumatic memories are scarce. The most efficacious treatments to diminish recent (i.e., day-old) traumata capitalize on memory updating mechanisms during reconsolidation that are initiated upon memory recall. Here, we show that, in mice, successful reconsolidation-updating paradigms for recent memories fail to attenuate remote (i.e., month-old) ones. We find that, whereas recent memory recall induces a limited period of hippocampal neuroplasticity mediated, in part, by S-nitrosylation of HDAC2 and histone acetylation, such plasticity is absent for remote memories. However, by using an HDAC2-targeting inhibitor (HDACi) during reconsolidation, even remote memories can be persistently attenuated. This intervention epigenetically primes the expression of neuroplasticity-related genes, which is accompanied by higher metabolic, synaptic, and structural plasticity. Thus, applying HDACis during memory reconsolidation might constitute a treatment option for remote traumata."

https://openalex.org/W1987692590,"Males of most species are more aggressive than females, but the neural mechanisms underlying this dimorphism are not clear. Here, we identify a neuron and a gene that control the higher level of aggression characteristic of Drosophila melanogaster males. Males, but not females, contain a small cluster of FruM(+) neurons that express the neuropeptide tachykinin (Tk). Activation and silencing of these neurons increased and decreased, respectively, intermale aggression without affecting male-female courtship behavior. Mutations in both Tk and a candidate receptor, Takr86C, suppressed the effect of neuronal activation, whereas overexpression of Tk potentiated it. Tk neuron activation overcame reduced aggressiveness caused by eliminating a variety of sensory or contextual cues, suggesting that it promotes aggressive arousal or motivation. Tachykinin/Substance P has been implicated in aggression in mammals, including humans. Thus, the higher aggressiveness of Drosophila males reflects the sexually dimorphic expression of a neuropeptide that controls agonistic behaviors across phylogeny."
https://openalex.org/W1995666505,"Many species travel in highly organized groups. The most quoted function of these configurations is to reduce energy expenditure and enhance locomotor performance of individuals in the assemblage. The distinctive V formation of bird flocks has long intrigued researchers and continues to attract both scientific and popular attention. The well-held belief is that such aggregations give an energetic benefit for those birds that are flying behind and to one side of another bird through using the regions of upwash generated by the wings of the preceding bird, although a definitive account of the aerodynamic implications of these formations has remained elusive. Here we show that individuals of northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) flying in a V flock position themselves in aerodynamically optimum positions, in that they agree with theoretical aerodynamic predictions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that birds show wingtip path coherence when flying in V positions, flapping spatially in phase and thus enabling upwash capture to be maximized throughout the entire flap cycle. In contrast, when birds fly immediately behind another bird--in a streamwise position--there is no wingtip path coherence; the wing-beats are in spatial anti-phase. This could potentially reduce the adverse effects of downwash for the following bird. These aerodynamic accomplishments were previously not thought possible for birds because of the complex flight dynamics and sensory feedback that would be required to perform such a feat. We conclude that the intricate mechanisms involved in V formation flight indicate awareness of the spatial wake structures of nearby flock-mates, and remarkable ability either to sense or predict it. We suggest that birds in V formation have phasing strategies to cope with the dynamic wakes produced by flapping wings."
https://openalex.org/W2001357509,"Introduction Cells use multilayered regulatory systems to respond adequately to changing environments or perturbations. Failure in regulation underlies cellular malfunctioning, loss of fitness, or disease. How molecular components dynamically interact to give rise to robust and adaptive responses is not well understood. Here, we studied how the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae can cope with transition to high glucose levels, a failure of which results in metabolic malfunctioning and growth arrest. Methods We combined experimental and modeling approaches to unravel the mechanisms used by yeast to cope with sudden glucose availability. We studied growth characteristics and metabolic state at population and single-cell levels (through flow cytometry and colony plating) of the wild type and of mutants unable to transit properly to excess glucose; such mutants are defective in trehalose synthesis, a disaccharide associated with stress resistance. Dynamic 13 C tracer enrichment was used to estimate dynamic intracellular fluxes immediately after glucose addition. Mathematical modeling was used to interpret and generalize results and to suggest subsequent experiments. Results The failure to cope with glucose is caused by imbalanced reactions in glycolysis, the essential pathway in energy metabolism in most organisms. In the failure mode, the first steps of glycolysis carry more flux than the downstream steps, resulting in accumulating intermediates at constant low levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and inorganic phosphate. We found that cells with such an unbalanced glycolysis coexist with vital cells with normal glycolytic function. Spontaneous, nongenetic metabolic variability among individual cells determines which state is reached and consequently which cells survive. In mutants of trehalose metabolism, only 0.01% of the cells started to grow on glucose; in the wild type, the success rate was still only 93% (i.e., 7% of wild-type yeast did not properly start up glycolysis). Mathematical models predicted that the dynamics of inorganic phosphate is a key determinant in successful transition to glucose, and that phosphate release through ATP hydrolysis reduces the probability of reaching an imbalanced state. 13 C-labeling experiments confirmed the hypothesis that trehalose metabolism constitutes a futile cycle that would provide proper phosphate balance: Upon a glucose pulse, almost 30% of the glucose is transiently shuttled into trehalose metabolism. Discussion Our work reveals how cell fate can be determined by glycolytic dynamics combined with cell heterogeneity purely at the metabolic level. Specific regulatory mechanisms are required to initiate the glycolytic pathway; in yeast, trehalose cycling pushes glycolysis transiently into the right direction, after which cycling stops. The coexistence of two modes of glycolysis—an imbalanced state and the normal functional state—arises from the fundamental design of glycolysis. This makes the imbalanced state a generic risk for humans as well, extending our fundamental knowledge of this central pathway that is dysfunctional in diseases such as diabetes and cancer."

Structural, biochemical, and cellular studies reveal that a sequence motif that defines these ligands binds to a highly conserved interaction surface of the WRC formed by the Sra and Abi subunits. Mutating this binding surface in flies resulted in defects in actin cytoskeletal organization and egg morphology during oogenesis, leading to female sterility. Our findings directly link diverse membrane proteins to the WRC and actin cytoskeleton and have broad physiological and pathological ramifications in metazoans."

Binary evolution models predict the existence of black holes accreting from the equatorial envelope of rapidly spinning 'B-emission' or 'Be' stars — young, blue irregular variables that show the characteristic spectral emission lines of hydrogen. So far, however, most of the compact stellar companions found in Be X-ray binaries have been identified as neutron stars. A few contain subdwarf stars but until now none had been found to host a black hole. The picture changes with the discovery of an unprecedented He II 4,686 Å optical emission line in the spectrum of an accretion disk around the companion to the Be star MWC 656. This, together with other information, points to the presence a black hole of 3.8 to 6.9 solar masses. Stellar-mass black holes have all been discovered through X-ray emission, which arises from the accretion of gas from their binary companions (this gas is either stripped from low-mass stars or supplied as winds from massive ones). Binary evolution models also predict the existence of black holes accreting from the equatorial envelope of rapidly spinning Be-type stars1,2,3 (stars of the Be type are hot blue irregular variables showing characteristic spectral emission lines of hydrogen). Of the approximately 80 Be X-ray binaries known in the Galaxy, however, only pulsating neutron stars have been found as companions2,3,4. A black hole was formally allowed as a solution for the companion to the Be star MWC 656 (ref. 5; also known as HD 215227), although that conclusion was based on a single radial velocity curve of the Be star, a mistaken spectral classification6 and rough estimates of the inclination angle. Here we report observations of an accretion disk line mirroring the orbit of MWC 656. This, together with an improved radial velocity curve of the Be star through fitting sharp Fe ii profiles from the equatorial disk, and a refined Be classification (to that of a B1.5–B2 III star), indicates that a black hole of 3.8 to 6.9 solar masses orbits MWC 656, the candidate counterpart of the γ-ray source AGL J2241+4454 (refs 5, 6). The black hole is X-ray quiescent and fed by a radiatively inefficient accretion flow giving a luminosity less than 1.6 × 10−7 times the Eddington luminosity. This implies that Be binaries with black-hole companions are difficult to detect in conventional X-ray surveys."

Newly formed synapses promote branch initiation and stability. However, little is known about molecular mechanisms that link these two processes. Here, we show that local assembly of an F-actin cytoskeleton at nascent presynaptic sites initiates both synapse formation and axon branching. We further find that assembly of the F-actin network requires a direct interaction between the synaptic cell adhesion molecule SYG-1 and a key regulator of actin cytoskeleton, the WVE-1/WAVE regulatory complex (WRC). SYG-1 cytoplasmic tail binds to the WRC using a consensus WRC interacting receptor sequence (WIRS). WRC mutants or mutating the SYG-1 WIRS motif leads to loss of local F-actin, synaptic material, and axonal branches.

Taking advantage of the well-mapped neuronal connections of Caenorhabditis elegans and the sleep-like states in this animal, we demonstrate the changed properties of both sensory neurons and downstream interneurons that mediate sleep and arousal. The ASH sensory neuron displays reduced sensitivity to stimuli in the sleep-like state, and the activity of the corresponding interneurons in ASH's motor circuit becomes asynchronous. Restoration of interneuron synchrony is sufficient for arousal. The multilevel circuit depression revealed provides an elegant strategy to promote a robust decrease in arousal while allowing for rapid reversibility of the sleep state."

Here, we show that hypoxia does not affect CB NSC proliferation directly. Rather, mature glomus cells expressing endothelin-1, the O2-sensing elements in the CB that secrete neurotransmitters in response to hypoxia, establish abundant synaptic-like contacts with stem cells, which express endothelin receptors, and instruct their growth. Inhibition of glomus cell transmitter release or their selective destruction markedly diminishes CB cell growth during hypoxia, showing that CB NSCs are under the direct “synaptic” control of the mature O2-sensitive cells.

The potential for this behavior is specified by the male-specific products of the fruitless (fruM) gene; males without fruM do not court females when held in isolation. We show that such fruM null males acquire the potential for courtship when grouped with other flies; they apparently learn to court flies with which they were grouped, irrespective of sex or species and retain this behavior for at least a week. The male-specific product of the doublesex gene (dsxM) is necessary and sufficient for the acquisition of the potential for such experience-dependent courtship. These results reveal a process that builds, via dsxM and social experience, the potential for a more flexible sexual behavior, which could be evolutionarily conserved as dsx-related genes that function in sexual development are found throughout the animal kingdom."

Parent-of-origin effects, in which the phenotypic effect of an allele depends on whether it was inherited from the mother or father, have well-established roles in animal growth (Wolf et al., 2008Wolf J.B. Cheverud J.M. Roseman C. Hager R. Genome-wide analysis reveals a complex pattern of genomic imprinting in mice.PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000091Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and behavior (Garfield et al., 2011Garfield A.S. Cowley M. Smith F.M. Moorwood K. Stewart-Cox J.E. Gilroy K. Baker S. Xia J. Dalley J.W. Hurst L.D. et al.Distinct physiological and behavioural functions for parental alleles of imprinted Grb10.Nature. 2011; 469: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It is less clear whether and how they affect the heritability and genetic architecture of complex traits. Understanding this impact requires a large population of phenotyped individuals of varying degrees of relatedness, whose genotypes are phased with respect to their parent of origin. In one human population in which this has been possible (Iceland), it has emerged as a potentially important contributor to human genetic disease (Kong et al., 2009Kong A. Steinthorsdottir V. Masson G. Thorleifsson G. Sulem P. Besenbacher S. Jonasdottir A. Sigurdsson A. Kristinsson K.T. Jonasdottir A. et al.DIAGRAM ConsortiumParental origin of sequence variants associated with complex diseases.Nature. 2009; 462: 868-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Analysis of an advanced intercross in mice has shown that body weight is controlled in a parent-of-origin-specific manner throughout life and that about half of the variance at imprinted quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) is attributable to these effects (Wolf et al., 2008Wolf J.B. Cheverud J.M. Roseman C. Hager R. Genome-wide analysis reveals a complex pattern of genomic imprinting in mice.PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000091Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Similarly, large pedigrees of farm animals have been used to demonstrate significant maternal and paternal influences on growth (e.g., Neugebauer et al., 2010Neugebauer N. Luther H. Reinsch N. Parent-of-origin effects cause genetic variation in pig performance traits.Animal. 2010; 4: 672-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), although in the absence of genotype data. In this study, in order to estimate the effect of parent of origin on phenotype, we reanalyze data from a mouse heterogeneous stock (HS) previously phenotyped for 97 traits. HS mice are descended from eight inbred progenitor strains (A/J, AKR/J, BALB/cJ, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, CBA/J, DBA/2J, and LP/J) and maintained for over 50 generations (Valdar et al., 2006Valdar W. Solberg L.C. Gauguier D. Burnett S. Klenerman P. Cookson W.O. Taylor M.S. Rawlins J.N. Mott R. Flint J. Genome-wide genetic association of complex traits in heterogeneous stock mice.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) so that each HS chromosome is a fine-grained mosaic of the founder haplotypes. QTL mapping in the HS involves the estimation of haplotype trait values (Mott et al., 2000Mott R. Talbot C.J. Turri M.G. Collins A.C. Flint J. A method for fine mapping quantitative trait loci in outbred animal stocks.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 12649-12654Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), which lends itself to the analysis of parent of origin: a haplotype has a parent-of-origin effect on a phenotype if its trait value depends on whether it was inherited maternally or paternally, which can be determined where we know the genotypes of the parents of the final mapping generation. Using this population, we estimate the contribution of parent of origin to the heritability of a wide range of complex traits, and identify QTLs with parent-of-origin effects. We then use gene knockouts (KOs) to dissect two QTLs for body weight and CD4+ T cells, which do not contain known imprinted genes, to investigate how these effects arise. We first show that parent of origin makes a significant contribution to the heritability of most complex traits but is confounded with family structure. We considered 97 traits we had previously analyzed in the HS (Valdar et al., 2006Valdar W. Solberg L.C. Gauguier D. Burnett S. Klenerman P. Cookson W.O. Taylor M.S. Rawlins J.N. Mott R. Flint J. Genome-wide genetic association of complex traits in heterogeneous stock mice.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, Solberg et al., 2006Solberg L.C. Valdar W. Gauguier D. Nunez G. Taylor A. Burnett S. Arboledas-Hita C. Hernandez-Pliego P. Davidson S. Burns P. et al.A protocol for high-throughput phenotyping, suitable for quantitative trait analysis in mice.Mamm. Genome. 2006; 17: 129-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Here, we define a parent-of-origin effect as a difference in the phenotypic effect due to an HS founder haplotype depending on whether it was transmitted via the mother or father in the previous generation. This definition is broader than classical imprinting because it includes phenomena such as polar overdominance (callipyge) (Georges et al., 2003Georges M. Charlier C. Cockett N. The callipyge locus: evidence for the trans interaction of reciprocally imprinted genes.Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 248-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We used 1,389 of the HS mice for which genotypes at 10,168 SNPs were available for both parents in the immediately preceding generation (212 parents were genotyped in total). The traits and numbers of mice phenotyped for each trait are listed in Table S1, which is available online. Our analysis is based on the fact that, if two individuals (not necessarily siblings) share an allele, then either it was inherited from parents of the same sex or from parents of the opposite sex. Parent-of-origin effects can then be evaluated by comparing the heritabilities associated with these modes of inheritance. For each mouse and at each locus and for each pair of HS founder haplotypes (s,t), we computed the probability that the animal inherited haplotype s maternally and haplotype t paternally. We used these phased probabilities to partition the kinship between each pair of HS animals according to parent of origin. Kinship is defined here as the genome-wide average number of shared founder haplotypes. We write + to symbolize coinheritance of an allele from parents of the same sex (i.e., common parent of origin), − for coinheritance from parents of the opposite sex, and ± for coinheritance regardless of parental sex. The relationships between all HS mice are summarized by the kinship matrix K±. The kinship of two individuals numbered i,j is the (i,j)′th element of this matrix. In order to investigate parent-of-origin effects, each element of the matrix is partitioned into two components representing the genome-wide average number of haplotypes inherited from parents of the same sex (K+), or from parents of opposing sexes (K−), so K±=K++K− (see Extended Experimental Procedures). By applying a mixed model commonly used to estimate the heritability of complex traits (Visscher et al., 2006Visscher P.M. Medland S.E. Ferreira M.A. Morley K.I. Zhu G. Cornes B.K. Montgomery G.W. Martin N.G. Assumption-free estimation of heritability from genome-wide identity-by-descent sharing between full siblings.PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e41Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, Yang et al., 2011Yang J.

Genet. 2011; 88: 76-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3814) Google Scholar), we estimated the fractions of phenotypic variation, h+2,h−2 attributable to each component of inheritance (Figure 1A; Table S1). If parent of origin makes no difference, then h+2=h−2 , and these would each be half the orthodox heritability ignoring parent of origin. In 91 out of 97 (93%) of the traits, we found h+2>h−2 (p value <10−22 under the null hypothesis that h+2=h−2, one-sided binomial test). Their medians are 0.362 and 0.183, respectively (median ratio (h+2/h−2)=2.04). The median SEs of these estimates are 0.058 and 0.078, respectively. We also estimated heritability from simulated complex traits (each trait generated from seven SNPs selected at random) using the same genotypes and kinship matrices, but without any parent-of-origin effects, and found the median ratio (h+2/h−2)=1.08, as expected (Figure 1A). We then repeated the analysis using only SNPs within 3 Mb of known imprinted genes (7.5% of all SNPs). Because, in the HS, linkage disequilibrium R2 decays to 0.5 within 2 Mb (Valdar et al., 2006Valdar W. Solberg L.C. Gauguier D. Burnett S. Klenerman P. Cookson W.O. Taylor M.S. Rawlins J.N. Mott R. Flint J. Genome-wide genetic association of complex traits in heterogeneous stock mice.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), these SNPs capture the genetic signal from imprinted regions. The medians of h+2,h−2 drop to 0.247 and 0.069, respectively (ratio 3.58), apparently suggesting that imprinted regions contribute disproportionately more to h+2. However, we observed almost identical results using a circular permutation (Cabrera et al., 2012Cabrera C.P. Navarro P. Huffman J.E. Wright A.F. Hayward C. Campbell H. Wilson J.F. Rudan A. Hastie N.D. Vitart V. Haley C.S. Uncovering networks from genome-wide association studies via circular genomic permutation.G3 (Bethesda). 2012; 2: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) for the locations of imprinted genes (medians of h+2,h−2 become 0.248 and 0.084, respectively; ratio 2.95). Randomly chosen loci perform similarly to imprinted loci because both tag the family relationships between HS animals to a similar extent, and hence, the kinship estimated from either subset of the genome approximates the genome-wide kinship equally well. We conclude that, in general, there is no evidence that genetic variation at known imprinted loci explains more parent-of-origin heritability than that expected by chance. We therefore sought other explanations for the observed excess of h+2 over h−2. It is well known that siblings share more alleles than nonsiblings. However, it is less appreciated that this excess of shared alleles derives from common parents and so is confounded with parent-of-origin and with parental effects (Hager et al., 2008Hager R. Cheverud J.M. Wolf J.B. Maternal effects as the cause of parent-of-origin effects that mimic genomic imprinting.Genetics. 2008; 178: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, Spencer, 2009Spencer H.G. Effects of genomic imprinting on quantitative traits.Genetica. 2009; 136: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, Whittaker et al., 2003Whittaker J.C. Gharani N. Hindmarsh P. McCarthy M.I. Estimation and testing of parent-of-origin effects for quantitative traits.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 72: 1035-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The effect is clearly seen when we classify pairs of HS individuals according to whether or not they are siblings (Figures 1B and 1C). The distribution of shared alleles inherited from parents of the opposite sex (i.e., the elements of the matrix K−) is nearly identical in siblings and nonsiblings (Figure 1B), whereas parent-of-origin allele sharing K+ is much greater between siblings (Figure 1C), and accounts for almost all of the additional genetic similarity among siblings compared to nonsiblings. Here, allele sharing is defined in terms of the ancestral haplotypes of the HS, but this result applies in any population, for diallelic markers in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (see Extended Experimental Procedures). At a SNP with allele frequency p, the average excess of parent-of-origin allele sharing between siblings over nonsiblings is 2p(1−p), whereas average allele sharing from parents of the opposite sex is the same regardless of relationship. Thus, parent-of-origin allele sharing tracks sibship membership, and the excess of h+2 over h−2 in the HS is an upper bound on the heritability attributable to parent of origin because it will be confounded with shared environment. Maternal effects are a form of shared environment, so are also confounded. However, because the HS phenotypes analyzed were preprocessed to remove the effects of covariates such as cage that are proxies for shared environment, it is likely that genuine parent-of-origin effects still contribute significantly to the heritability of traits in the HS. Consequently, we expect many QTLs genome wide to also show parent-of-origin effects. We next investigated whether individual QTLs showed parent-of-origin effects. Here, we define an iQTL to mean a QTL exhibiting an additive parent-of-origin effect. We reanalyzed 837 autosomal QTLs for the 97 traits that we had previously mapped in the HS (Valdar et al., 2006Valdar W. Solberg L.C. Gauguier D. Burnett S. Klenerman P. Cookson W.O. Taylor M.S. Rawlins J.N. Mott R. Flint J. Genome-wide genetic association of complex traits in heterogeneous stock mice.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) for parent-of-origin effects. We only considered QTLs previously reported to minimize false-positive calls; however, we will have missed any novel iQTL not possessing a detectable ordinary QTL. We restricted attention to additive parent-of-origin effects and excluded polar overdominance because we had greater power to detect the former (see Extended Experimental Procedures). We found that standard single-locus tests for parent-of-origin effects, when applied to simulated nonimprinted complex traits, produce many false-positive iQTL calls. This error rate increases with the number of QTLs contributing to the simulated trait, even when a mixed model (Kang et al., 2008Kang H.M. Zaitlen N.A. Wade C.M. Kirby A. Heckerman D. Daly M.J. Eskin E. Efficient control of population structure in model organism association mapping.Genetics. 2008; 178: 1709-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar) is used to control for relatedness. In addition, the genomic location of the peak of association for an iQTL may shift relative to the peak for the corresponding nonimprinted QTL. This invalidates the use of standard statistical tests to compare models at a single location. For these reasons, we developed a simulation-based methodology to call HS QTLs accurately, as described in the Extended Experimental Procedures. We simulated 1,000 typical complex traits using the HS genotypes, each comprising seven nonimprinted QTLs accounting for 5% of the total variance (i.e., the same simulations represented by the gray dots in Figure 1A). The level of QTL complexity we chose matches that observed in the HS mice and is conservative for this analysis because the median effect size in the HS is only 3% (Valdar et al., 2006Valdar W. Solberg L.C. Gauguier D. Burnett S. Klenerman P. Cookson W.O. Taylor M.S. Rawlins J.N. Mott R. Flint J. Genome-wide genetic association of complex traits in heterogeneous stock mice.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). We measured the evidence for an iQTL by the statistic ΔlogP. We estimated the null distribution of ΔlogP for nonimprinted complex traits from the simulations and used this to determine the false discovery rate (FDR) of iQTLs in the real data. We found 138 iQTLs (16%) with an FDR of 20%, and 304 (36%) at FDR 25% (Table S2). Thus, there is a large fraction of QTLs with weak-to-medium evidence for parent-of-origin effects, although there are relatively few iQTLs of large effect—only 11 at FDR <5%. Over half (60%) of the phenotypes have at least one of the 138 iQTLs. These results are consistent with the observed excess of parent-of-origin heritability affecting most phenotypes, with many loci contributing a small amount to the total. Some iQTLs overlap known imprinted genes. For example, the imprinting control region between Dlk and Dio3a (chromosome 12 [chr12], 109.3–114.3 Mb) overlaps five QTLs for diverse phenotypes, four of which are iQTLs at FDR <25%. The region chr7 (58.6–62.5 Mb) contains the Snord116 cluster syntenic to the human Prader-Willi locus, and overlaps four iQTLs for body weight. However, many iQTLs are not associated with known imprinted regions. For example, another four iQTLs for body weight overlap the locus chr3 (97–101 Mb), yet this contains no known imprinted genes. An iQTL for percentage of CD4+ T cells occurs within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 17. Across all phenotypes, there is no significant enrichment of iQTLs at imprinted genes, although body weight does show slight enrichment (8 out of 10 body weight QTLs that overlap imprinted genes are iQTLs, compared to 39 out of 91 elsewhere; Fisher’s exact test, p < 0.042). We next looked for imprinted gene expression effects in the 285 of the 1,389 HS mice for which gene expression microarray data from the hippocampus were available (Huang et al., 2009Huang G.J. Shifman S. Valdar W. Johannesson M. Yalcin B. Taylor M.S. Taylor J.M. Mott R. Flint J. High resolution mapping of expression QTLs in heterogeneous stock mice in multiple tissues.Genome Res. 2009; 19: 1133-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because of the much smaller sample size, and because most gene expression traits have a simpler genetic architecture than complex traits, we limited attention to cis eQTLs, and called a cis eQTL imprinted if it was within 5 Mb of its gene location (the likely limit distance between a cis eQTL and its cognate gene in the HS, based on LD decay in the HS and previous eQTL mapping) and where the test for an additive parent-of-origin effect had logP > 5 in a mixed model. None of the simulated nonimprinted traits reached this level of significance, so we expect fewer than one of the imprinted expression QTLs (ieQTLs) to be a false positive (Table 1; Figure S1).Table 1cis ieQTLs with Parent-of-Origin Effects in the HippocampusProbeGenelogPprobe.bpieQTL.bpscl18001.16.1_91-SErcc55.9chr1: 44,180,973chr1: 42,492,897–42,492,897scl16174.14.1_64-SBC0033316.8chr1: 150,362,618chr1: 151,330,902–151,330,902scl15940.5.1_15-SFcer1g8.0chr1: 171,229,809chr1: 170,841,586–170,841,586ri_A230084K17_PX00129H10_AK039008_1065-SH13aKnown imprinted genes.8.9chr2: 152,686,544chr2: 153,436,538–153,436,538scl0003133.1_10-SNnataKnown imprinted genes.12.6chr2: 157,561,237chr2: 158,858,087–158,858,087scl0018111.2_84-SNnataKnown imprinted genes.7.5chr2: 157,562,196chr2: 158,858,087–158,858,087scl00241919.1_47-SSlc7a145.7chr3: 31,206,501chr3: 30,147,475–30,147,475scl25190.1.1_325-SDab18.1chr4: 103,712,829chr4: 104,707,224–104,707,224scl068703.1_260-SRere5.7chr4:150621837chr4: 149,761,825–149,761,825scl26853.5_220-SNapepld10.6chr5: 21,663,405chr5: 19,455,955–19,455,955scl28197.12_81-STm7sf38.0chr6: 146,602,500chr6: 140,170,891–140,170,891scl018616.1_273-SPeg3aKnown imprinted genes.18.9chr7: 6,706,745chr7: 12,331,090–123,31,090scl0018616.2_167-SPeg3aKnown imprinted genes.13.0chr7: 6,707,681chr7: 12,331,090–12,331,090scl33092.11_617-SUsp29aKnown imprinted genes.23.5chr7: 6,967,048chr7: 12,331,090–12,331,090scl31485.22_238-SGpi15.7chr7: 34,201,350chr7: 34,914,779–34,914,779GI_38087856-SSNORD116 (PWS)aKnown imprinted genes.24.0chr7: 59,676,432chr7: 64,669,481–64,669,481scl0068695.1_200-SHddc36.1chr7: 80,345,915chr7: 81,982,400–81,982,400scl33477.9_38-SArl2bp5.5chr8: 94,673,938chr8: 93,133,347–93,133,347scl0003488.1_12-SRasgrf1aKnown imprinted genes.7.8chr9: 89,991,508chr9: 90,408,780–90,408,780scl35434.19.159_3-SCep635.9chr9: 102,586,724chr9: 105,639,422–105,639,422ri_2810002M10_ZX00053I11_AK012646_830-SGrb10aKnown imprinted genes.6.5chr11: 11,967,505chr11: 11,116,813–11,116,813scl40203.12_25-SSparc5.8chr11: 55,394,523chr11: 55,151,036–55,151,036scl39397.22.1_286-SRgs95.5chr11: 109,225,377chr11: 109,419,877–109,419,877scl020716.5_261-SSerpina3n10.0chr12:104414198chr12: 105,051,146–105,051,146scl0075745.1_310-SSNORD113 (Meg3)aKnown imprinted genes.13.8chr12: 109,652,138chr12: 112,452,735–112,452,735scl2689.1.1_165-SNefl6.0chr14: 68,125,862chr14: 67,911,078–67,911,078scl064657.6_146-SMrps1011.9chr17: 47,378,425chr17: 47,341,437–47,341,437scl020463.2_41-SCox7a2l5.0chr17: 83,502,218chr17: 83,217,758–83,217,758Probe is the identification on the Illumina Mouse WG-6 v1 BeadArray.

We identified 28 ieQTLs representing 26 distinct genes of which 8—H13, Nnat, Peg3, Usp3, Snord116 (Prader-Willi locus), Rasgrf1, Grb10, and Snord113 (Meg3 locus)—are known imprinted genes or in known imprinted control regions. Some of these overlap with the iQTLs we identified, including a probe for a Snord116 repeat within the Prader-Willi locus (logP = 22) presumably responsible for the parent-of-origin effects on body weight we observed at the locus. Mice with a paternally inherited Snord116 deletion show severe postnatal growth retardation, whereas maternally inherited deletions are normal (Ding et al., 2008Ding F. Li H.H. Zhang S. Solomon N.M.

Similarly, the ieQTLs for H13 (logP = 8.8) and Nnat (logP = 12.6) on chromosome 2 overlap with a single iQTL for body weight. Interestingly, although these ieQTL effects are very significant, the body weight effects are slight. Grb10 has imprinted behavioral and physiological effects (Garfield et al., 2011Garfield A.S. Cowley M. Smith F.M. Moorwood K. Stewart-Cox J.E. Gilroy K. Baker S. Xia J. Dalley J.W. Hurst L.D. et al.Distinct physiological and behavioural functions for parental alleles of imprinted Grb10.Nature. 2011; 469: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and is close to an ieQTL for body weight on chromosome 11. The other 18 genes with ieQTLs are not known to be imprinted, although 1 (Ercc5; logP = 5.94) is potentially imprinted based on expressed sequence tag data (Seoighe et al., 2006Seoighe C. Nembaware V. Scheffler K. Maximum likelihood inference of imprinting and allele-specific expression from EST data.Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 3032-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Ercc5 is an excision repair factor that also promotes DNA breaks and DNA demethylation, allowing the recruitment of the transcription factor CTCF (Le May et al., 2012Le May N. Fradin D. Iltis I. Bougnères P. Egly J.-M. XPG and XPF endonucleases trigger chromatin looping and DNA demethylation for accurate expression of activated genes.Mol. Cell. 2012; 47: 622-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We next investigated two iQTLs for which there was no underlying imprinted gene and where our ieQTL data did not suggest a candidate. We performed reciprocal F1 crosses between KOs of candidate genes in each of two iQTLs, Man1a2 (mannosidase α, class 1A, member 2) and H2-ab1 (histocompatibility 2, class II antigen A, β 1), to confirm function. All laboratory procedures involving mice were conducted under UK Home Office authority after approval by Local Ethical Review at University of Oxford. We distinguish between two types of reciprocal cross: where a homozygote KO is crossed with a wild-type (WT), or where a heterozygote KO is crossed with WT. In the former design, all F1 offspring are heterozygous, and parent-of-origin effects are found by comparing the phenotypes of individuals grouped according to the parent transmitting the KO allele. In the latter (Figure 2A), about half the offspring are WT, with which it is possible to test for purely parental effects, in addition to parent-of-origin effects. For clarity, we denote F1 genotypes as follows: heterozygous F1 mice with a maternally inherited KO allele are denoted by +/−, and heterozygotes with a paternally inherited KO allele by −/+. A WT F1 whose father or mother carried the KO allele without transmitting it is +/+♂ or +/+♀, respectively. We first examined the four overlapping iQTLs located around 97–100 Mb on chromosome 3 for body weight measured throughout lifetime. This region contains many genes, but no obvious candidates. We selected the mannosidase Man1a2, lying in the middle of the interval, and for which a gene KO B6;129S4-Man1a2tm1.1Ahe/J (Tremblay et al., 2007Tremblay L.O. Nagy Kovács E. Daniels E. Wong N.K.

Chem. 2007; 282: 2558-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was available. Homozygous mutants are nonviable, so we crossed heterozygous KO with WT. Of 108 F1 offspring, 48% were WT. Figure 3 shows the growth curves of the offspring, weighed at ages 4–11 weeks. The ANOVA table for fitting a series of mixed models that dissect the genetic architecture of body weight by sex, genotype, parental genotype, and parent of origin is in Table S3 (body weight data are in Table S4). Body weight grows approximately quadratically with age, with males heavier than females (p < 10−170). The Man1a2 KO has no direct effect on body weight (p < 0.169) but has two distinct epigenetic effects, which persist throughout life (Wolf et al., 2008Wolf J.B. Cheverud J.M. Roseman C. Hager R. Genome-wide analysis reveals a complex pattern of genomic imprinting in mice.PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000091Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). First, and most significantly, there is a purely parental effect, independent of the offspring’s genotype (p < 10−23). Second, there is a parent-of-origin effect, where the weight of offspring carrying a KO allele depends on whether it is inherited from the mother or father (p < 0.006). This combination of effects means there is little difference between KO and WT mice of a given sex whose mother carried the KO allele (blue and green curves in the Figure 3), but KO mice are heavier than WT when the father carries the KO (red and orange curves). We conclude that the paternally inherited Man1a2 allele has no effect on weight because paternally inherited KO and WT alleles have the same effect. Theoretical arguments, based on selective abortion of offspring by mothers, suggest that the MHC could be imprinted (Wolf and Hager, 2009Wolf J.B. Hager R. Selective abortion and the evolution of genomic imprinting.J. Evol. Biol. 2009; 22: 2519-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Evidence from studies in rat placenta (Kanbour-Shakir et al., 1993Kanbour-Shakir A. Kunz H.W. Gill 3rd, T.J.

Unlike the more stereotypical development of the body’s main blood vessels, the formation of the capillary networks responsible for tissue perfusion is an adaptive process primarily governed by the metabolic needs of the target tissues (Fraisl et al., 2009Fraisl P.

The plastic nature of this adaptive angiogenesis is further highlighted by the dramatic changes in vascularization observed in tumors or in obese adipose tissue: changes that contribute to the progression of pathologies such as cancer and obesity and are becoming increasingly central to their treatment (Cao, 2010Cao Y.

Although environmental factors such as diet are widely believed to affect the development and progression of these pathologies, exploration of the link between nutrition and angiogenesis has largely been confined to correlative studies. These include descriptions of the effects of gestational nutrition on the placental vasculature (Belkacemi et al., 2010Belkacemi L. Nelson D.M. Desai M. Ross M.G.

A tantalizing new study has shown that increasing adipose tissue vascularization can ameliorate the deleterious metabolic effects of a high-fat diet, pointing to a central metabolic role for these vascular changes (Sung et al., 2013Sung H.K.

However, whether modulation of angiogenesis is associated with metabolic benefits remains a controversial topic, partly because it is not trivial to genetically target the blood vessels of specific organs to recapitulate the changes associated with certain dietary interventions without affecting other cell types or vascular pools (Cao, 2010Cao Y.

Regardless of its metabolic consequences, adaptive angiogenesis is widely believed to be mechanistically driven by target-derived signals (Cao, 2007Cao Y.

A close spatial association between mammalian nerves and vessels was observed as long ago as 1543 (Vesalius, 1543Vesalius A. De humani corporis fabrica.

Notably, interplay of innervation and vascularisation of internal organs has also been described (Davies, 2009Davies A.M.

A functional role for these neurovascular interactions was suggested following the discovery that vessel abnormalities precede a number of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders: an observation that points to angiogenesis as a therapeutically relevant process (Quaegebeur et al., 2011Quaegebeur A.

The question remains whether, in a reciprocal process, neuronal activity may affect adaptive angiogenesis. In spite of some intriguing associations (Asano et al., 1997Asano A. Morimatsu M. Nikami H.

Drosophila melanogaster has an open circulation, but its tracheal system has a role analogous to that of the vertebrate vasculature in supplying tissues and internal organs with oxygen (Fraisl et al., 2009Fraisl P.

During embryogenesis, developmental mechanisms akin to those discovered in the vertebrate lung and vasculature make use of signaling pathways such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling to sculpt this complex tracheal network of interconnected tubes (Ghabrial et al., 2003Ghabrial A.

Drosophila tracheal morphogenesis: intricate cellular solutions to basic plumbing problems.Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 301-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These embryonic proliferative and morphogenetic stages are superseded by a larval period of extensive, but mechanistically less understood, cellular growth. Growth is particularly prominent in the tracheal terminal cells: the cells at the end of each airway that make contact with target tissues and through which gas exchange takes place (Ghabrial et al., 2003Ghabrial A. Luschnig S. Metzstein M.M. Krasnow M.A. Branching morphogenesis of the Drosophila tracheal system.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Drosophila tracheal morphogenesis: intricate cellular solutions to basic plumbing problems.Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 301-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Like vertebrate capillaries, Drosophila tracheal terminal cells branch profusely in response to low oxygen using conserved FGF and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling pathways (Centanin et al., 2008Centanin L. Dekanty A. Romero N. Irisarri M. Gorr T.A. Wappner P. Cell autonomy of HIF effects in Drosophila: tracheal cells sense hypoxia and induce terminal branch sprouting.Dev.

This hypoxic remodeling has been assumed to be the only source of tracheal plasticity and, in normal conditions, the tracheal system is generally believed to grow in proportion to the whole organism. In this study, we use a combination of genetic approaches, metabolic profiling, and in vivo imaging to uncover previously unrecognized nutritional plasticity in the fly tracheal system. In contrast to the known target-derived mechanisms of adaptive remodeling, we find this plasticity to be regulated by a mechanism, previously undescribed in either flies or vertebrates, involving nutrient-responsive neurons effecting long-lasting and metabolically significant changes in tracheal architecture. While subjecting wild-type Drosophila larvae to different dietary conditions, we observed that a severe reduction in dietary yeast (the main source of lipid and amino acids in the larval diet) was accompanied by an almost ubiquitous reduction in tracheal terminal cell branching, even when controlling for overall developmental delay by allowing nutrient-restricted larvae to develop to a comparable stage (Figures 1A–1C, 1G–1I and Figures S1A, S1C, S1D, S1F, S1G, S1I, S1J, S1L, S1M, and S1O available online). The single exception was the tracheal branches of the central nervous system (CNS), which were refractory to this dietary manipulation (Figures 1A and 1G). By contrast, a mild reduction in dietary yeast neither affected developmental timing nor led to major changes in the size of organs or that of most tracheal terminal cells (Figures 1D and 1E and data not shown) but did lead to a severe reduction in tracheal coverage throughout the digestive tract (Figures 1F, S1B, S1E, S1H, S1K, and S1N). Reduced tracheal coverage was not caused by cell death (Figures S2A and S2B) and could not be solely accounted for by defects in gas filling (Figures S2Q and S2R). Instead, it resulted from reduced tracheal terminal cell branching (Figures S2E–S2G, S2K–S2M, and S2Q–S2R). To investigate the reversibility of the tracheal changes described above, we reared larvae under the mild nutrient restriction conditions shown to reduce intestinal tracheation and transferred them to more nutritious food immediately after eclosion. Even after 7 days on a nutritious diet, the intestinal tracheae of these adults flies were significantly less branched than those of control adult flies always reared on a nutritious diet (Figures 1J and 1K), indicating that a defined period of nutrient restriction has long-term effects on the tracheal scaffold.Figure S1Nutritional Regulation of Different Intestinal Tracheal Subsets, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Representative tracheation of the gut portions boxed in the cartoon: anterior midgut (A-C), mid-midgut (D-F), posterior midgut (G-I), anterior hindgut (J-L) and posterior hindgut (M-O) under the same three nutritional conditions described in in Figure 1.

See also quantifications to the right of (A) and (B). This rules out tracheal terminal cell death as the reason for the reduced intestinal tracheal coverage in nutrient-restricted larvae. Similarly, no differences in tracheal terminal cell number are apparent upon reduction of insulin signaling in DSRF>InR-RNAi larvae of the same stage (D, not significantly different from the tracheal terminal cell number of GAL4 (C) or UAS controls (data not shown).

Tracheal coverage (as quantified by the length/area ratio in K to M for each larval instar) is mildly reduced in 2nd-instar larvae that have been nutrient restricted (L, p = 0.02), becoming strongly reduced by the 3rd-instar stage (M, p < 0.0001). However, the total length of these tracheal arbours increases with each larval instar (E to G), although not at the same rate as in well-fed larvae (G, p < 0.0001). n = 14–20/set. This suggests that the reduced tracheal coverage results from slower growth of these tracheal arbours. The same is true for the DSRF>InR-RNAi larvae (H to J and N to P). For tracheal length: in I, p = 0.02 versus UAS control but not significant versus GAL4 control, and in J, p < 0.0001 versus either GAL4 or UAS controls. For tracheal coverage: in O, p < 0.001 versus UAS control but not significant versus GAL4 control, and in P, p < 0.0001 versus either GAL4 or UAS controls. n = 13-18/set.

As the panels and quantification to the right of the panels show, tracheal coverage is reduced in nutrient-restricted 3rd-instar larvae (p < 0.0001, n = 26-29/set). This further confirms that the phenotype observed with DIC optics (an imaging technique best suited to the analysis of gas-filled tracheae), results, at least partly, from reduced branching rather than gas filling.

(E to P) Quantifications of the total length of tracheal arbours (E to J) and the ratio between this length and the gut area covered by the tracheal arbours (K to P) in the mid-hindgut of well-fed (8% yeast) versus nutrient-restricted (2% yeast) 1st-, 2nd- and 3rd-instar OreR larvae (E to G and K to M) or DSRF>InR-RNAi larvae versus GAL4 and UAS controls (H to J and N to P). Tracheal coverage (as quantified by the length/area ratio in K to M for each larval instar) is mildly reduced in 2nd-instar larvae that have been nutrient restricted (L, p = 0.02), becoming strongly reduced by the 3rd-instar stage (M, p < 0.0001). However, the total length of these tracheal arbours increases with each larval instar (E to G), although not at the same rate as in well-fed larvae (G, p < 0.0001). n = 14–20/set. This suggests that the reduced tracheal coverage results from slower growth of these tracheal arbours. The same is true for the DSRF>InR-RNAi larvae (H to J and N to P). For tracheal length: in I, p = 0.02 versus UAS control but not significant versus GAL4 control, and in J, p < 0.0001 versus either GAL4 or UAS controls. For tracheal coverage: in O, p < 0.001 versus UAS control but not significant versus GAL4 control, and in P, p < 0.0001 versus either GAL4 or UAS controls. n = 13-18/set. (Q and R) Morphology of the tracheal terminal cell arbours of well-fed (Q, 8% yeast) or nutrient-restricted (R, 2% yeast) 3rd-instar larvae expressing the membrane-tagged reporter cd8-GFP from DSRF-GAL4. As the panels and quantification to the right of the panels show, tracheal coverage is reduced in nutrient-restricted 3rd-instar larvae (p < 0.0001, n = 26-29/set). This further confirms that the phenotype observed with DIC optics (an imaging technique best suited to the analysis of gas-filled tracheae), results, at least partly, from reduced branching rather than gas filling. (S and T) The same is true for DSRF > cd8-GFP, PI3K-DN (p < 0.0001 versus DSRF>cd8-GFP control, n = 22-25/set). Dietary plasticity could be a feature unique to larval tracheae, given that their branches are undergoing extensive growth. To investigate whether adult tracheae are also responsive to diet, we allowed wild-type flies to develop under our standard nutritional conditions and then exposed them to nutritionally poor or imbalanced diets as adult flies. As Figure 1L shows, a 7 day nutritional imbalance (9% sucrose) led to increased intestinal tracheation of the mid-midgut, confirming the dietary plasticity of the tracheal system also in adult flies. Collectively, these data uncover previously unrecognized nutritional plasticity of the insect tracheal system, shaped by both previous and current nutritional states. The tracheae of different organs exhibit different degrees of nutritional plasticity; intestinal tracheal terminal cells are particularly sensitive to a reduction in yeast availability, while CNS tracheae are preferentially spared. We then focused on the larval phenotypes to investigate the molecular mechanisms of nutritional plasticity. Hypoxia, the only known regulator of tracheal plasticity, has been shown to promote tracheal branching by inducing FGF ligand in target tissues and receptor upregulation in tracheal cells (Centanin et al., 2008Centanin L. Dekanty A. Romero N. Irisarri M. Gorr T.A. Wappner P. Cell autonomy of HIF effects in Drosophila: tracheal cells sense hypoxia and induce terminal branch sprouting.Dev.

Although downregulation of the FGF receptor gene Breathless (Btl) did lead to reduced tracheation in most scored tissues, consistent with the known FGF requirement for the establishment of the tracheal scaffold during earlier developmental stages (Ghabrial et al., 2003Ghabrial A.

These included expression of Btl, constitutively active Btl, and its ligand Branchless (Bnl) in tracheal terminal cells and analysis of Bnl and Stumps (a downstream signaling component) expression under different nutritional conditions. We then turned our attention to the insulin signaling pathway: the major coordinator of nutrient intake and tissue size in all animals including Drosophila (Andersen et al., 2013Andersen D.S.

We first suppressed the intracellular insulin signal transducer phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) by expressing the dominant-negative Dp110D954A (referred to as PI3K-DN; Leevers et al., 1996Leevers S.J.

This led to reduced tracheal terminal cell branching both in the periphery and throughout the digestive tract, but not in the CNS (Figures 2A–2F, S2S, S2T, S3A–S3D and data not shown): a reduction qualitatively and quantitatively comparable to that observed in these tracheal terminal cells following severe nutrient restriction (Figures 1G–1I). As in the case of diet, the intestinal branches appeared to be more severely affected by this manipulation. Because the selective intestinal phenotype was not caused by stronger GAL4 expression in intestinal tra"
https://openalex.org/W2136752203,"Successful infection depends on the ability of the pathogen to gain nutrients from the host. The extracellular pathogenic bacterium group A Streptococcus (GAS) causes a vast array of human diseases. By using the quorum-sensing sil system as a reporter, we found that, during adherence to host cells, GAS delivers streptolysin toxins, creating endoplasmic reticulum stress. This, in turn, increases asparagine (ASN) synthetase expression and the production of ASN. The released ASN is sensed by the bacteria, altering the expression of ∼17% of GAS genes of which about one-third are dependent on the two-component system TrxSR. The expression of the streptolysin toxins is strongly upregulated, whereas genes linked to proliferation are downregulated in ASN absence. Asparaginase, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, arrests GAS growth in human blood and blocks GAS proliferation in a mouse model of human bacteremia. These results delineate a pathogenic pathway and propose a therapeutic strategy against GAS infections."
https://openalex.org/W2111102789,"Misfolded proteins are often cytotoxic, unless cellular systems prevent their accumulation. Data presented here uncover a mechanism by which defects in secretory proteins lead to a dramatic reduction in their mRNAs and protein expression. When mutant signal sequences fail to bind to the signal recognition particle (SRP) at the ribosome exit site, the nascent chain instead contacts Argonaute2 (Ago2), and the mutant mRNAs are specifically degraded. Severity of signal sequence mutations correlated with increased proximity of Ago2 to nascent chain and mRNA degradation. Ago2 knockdown inhibited degradation of the mutant mRNA, while overexpression of Ago2 or knockdown of SRP54 promoted degradation of secretory protein mRNA. The results reveal a previously unappreciated general mechanism of translational quality control, in which specific mRNA degradation preemptively regulates aberrant protein production (RAPP)."

Hamada-Kawaguchi et al. (p. 294 ) demonstrate that this pathway must be activated in ovarian somatic cells to stop proliferation of germ cells in Drosophila. Phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue on β-catenin by the tyrosine kinase Btk turns on signaling in the niche cells by promoting transcriptional activity of β-catenin. Failure in this process resulted in ovarian tumors in the flies.

https://openalex.org/W2061891345,"Oxidants derived from myeloperoxidase (MPO) contribute to inflammatory diseases. In vivo MPO activity is commonly assessed by the accumulation of 3-chlorotyrosine (3-Cl-Tyr), although 3-Cl-Tyr is formed at low yield and is subject to metabolism. Here we show that MPO activity can be assessed using hydroethidine (HE), a probe commonly employed for the detection of superoxide. Using LC/MS/MS, (1)H NMR, and two-dimensional NOESY, we identified 2-chloroethidium (2-Cl-E(+)) as a specific product when HE was exposed to hypochlorous acid (HOCl), chloramines, MPO/H2O2/chloride, and activated human neutrophils. The rate constant for HOCl-mediated conversion of HE to 2-Cl-E(+) was estimated to be 1.5 × 10(5) M(-1)s(-1). To investigate the utility of 2-Cl-E(+) to assess MPO activity in vivo, HE was injected into wild-type and MPO-deficient (Mpo(-/-)) mice with established peritonitis or localized arterial inflammation, and tissue levels of 2-Cl-E(+) and 3-Cl-Tyr were then determined by LC/MS/MS. In wild-type mice, 2-Cl-E(+) and 3-Cl-Tyr were detected readily in the peritonitis model, whereas in the arterial inflammation model 2-Cl-E(+) was present at comparatively lower concentrations (17 versus 0.3 pmol/mg of protein), and 3-Cl-Tyr could not be detected. Similar to the situation with 3-Cl-Tyr, tissue levels of 2-Cl-E(+) were decreased substantially in Mpo(-/-) mice, indicative of the specificity of the assay. In the arterial inflammation model, 2-Cl-E(+) was absent from non-inflamed arteries and blood, suggesting that HE oxidation occurred locally in the inflamed artery. Our data suggest that the conversion of exogenous HE to 2-Cl-E(+) may be a useful selective and sensitive marker for MPO activity in addition to 3-Cl-Tyr."

https://openalex.org/W1994053210,"The effects of AMP and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2) on porcine fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (pFBPase) and Escherichia coli FBPase (eFBPase) differ in three respects. AMP/Fru-2,6-P2 synergism in pFBPase is absent in eFBPase. Fru-2,6-P2 induces a 13° subunit pair rotation in pFBPase but no rotation in eFBPase. Hydrophilic side chains in eFBPase occupy what otherwise would be a central aqueous cavity observed in pFBPase. Explored here is the linkage of AMP/Fru-2,6-P2 synergism to the central cavity and the evolution of synergism in FBPases. The single mutation Ser(45) → His substantially fills the central cavity of pFBPase, and the triple mutation Ser(45) → His, Thr(46) → Arg, and Leu(186) → Tyr replaces porcine with E. coli type side chains. Both single and triple mutations significantly reduce synergism while retaining other wild-type kinetic properties. Similar to the effect of Fru-2,6-P2 on eFBPase, the triple mutant of pFBPase with bound Fru-2,6-P2 exhibits only a 2° subunit pair rotation as opposed to the 13° rotation exhibited by the Fru-2,6-P2 complex of wild-type pFBPase. The side chain at position 45 is small in all available eukaryotic FBPases but large and hydrophilic in bacterial FBPases, similar to eFBPase. Sequence information indicates the likelihood of synergism in the FBPase from Leptospira interrogans (lFBPase), and indeed recombinant lFBPase exhibits AMP/Fru-2,6-P2 synergism. Unexpectedly, however, AMP also enhances Fru-6-P binding to lFBPase. Taken together, these observations suggest the evolution of AMP/Fru-2,6-P2 synergism in eukaryotic FBPases from an ancestral FBPase having a central aqueous cavity and exhibiting synergistic feedback inhibition by AMP and Fru-6-P."
https://openalex.org/W2040838256,"Clamp loaders belong to a family of proteins known as ATPases associated with various cellular activities (AAA+). These proteins utilize the energy from ATP binding and hydrolysis to perform cellular functions. The clamp loader is required to load the clamp onto DNA for use by DNA polymerases to increase processivity. ATP binding and hydrolysis are coordinated by several key residues, including a conserved Lys located within the Walker A motif (or P-loop). This residue is required for each subunit to bind ATP. The specific function of each ATP molecule bound to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae clamp loader is unknown. A series of point mutants, each lacking a single Walker A Lys residue, was generated to study the effects of abolishing ATP binding in individual clamp loader subunits. A variety of biochemical assays were used to analyze the function of ATP binding during discrete steps of the clamp loading reaction. All mutants reduced clamp binding/opening to different degrees. Decreased clamp binding activity was generally correlated with decreases in the population of open clamps, suggesting that differences in the binding affinities of Walker A mutants stem from differences in stabilization of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in an open conformation. Walker A mutations had a smaller effect on DNA binding than clamp binding/opening. Our data do not support a model in which each ATP site functions independently to regulate a different step in the clamp loading cycle to coordinate these steps. Instead, the ATP sites work in unison to promote conformational changes in the clamp loader that drive clamp loading."
