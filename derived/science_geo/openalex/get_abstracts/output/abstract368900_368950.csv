https://openalex.org/W2022186026,"High-throughput genomics and the emerging field of synthetic biology demand ever more convenient, economical, and efficient technologies to assemble and clone genes, gene libraries and synthetic pathways. Here, we describe the development of a novel and extremely simple cloning method, circular polymerase extension cloning (CPEC). This method uses a single polymerase to assemble and clone multiple inserts with any vector in a one-step reaction in vitro. No restriction digestion, ligation, or single-stranded homologous recombination is required. In this study, we elucidate the CPEC reaction mechanism and demonstrate its usage in demanding synthetic biology applications such as one-step assembly and cloning of complex combinatorial libraries and multi-component pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2161623161,"In recent times there has been some controversy over the impact of electromagnetic radiation on human health. The significance of mobile phone radiation on male reproduction is a key element of this debate since several studies have suggested a relationship between mobile phone use and semen quality. The potential mechanisms involved have not been established, however, human spermatozoa are known to be particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress by virtue of the abundant availability of substrates for free radical attack and the lack of cytoplasmic space to accommodate antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, the induction of oxidative stress in these cells not only perturbs their capacity for fertilization but also contributes to sperm DNA damage. The latter has, in turn, been linked with poor fertility, an increased incidence of miscarriage and morbidity in the offspring, including childhood cancer. In light of these associations, we have analyzed the influence of RF-EMR on the cell biology of human spermatozoa in vitro.Purified human spermatozoa were exposed to radio-frequency electromagnetic radiation (RF-EMR) tuned to 1.8 GHz and covering a range of specific absorption rates (SAR) from 0.4 W/kg to 27.5 W/kg. In step with increasing SAR, motility and vitality were significantly reduced after RF-EMR exposure, while the mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species and DNA fragmentation were significantly elevated (P<0.001). Furthermore, we also observed highly significant relationships between SAR, the oxidative DNA damage bio-marker, 8-OH-dG, and DNA fragmentation after RF-EMR exposure.RF-EMR in both the power density and frequency range of mobile phones enhances mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation by human spermatozoa, decreasing the motility and vitality of these cells while stimulating DNA base adduct formation and, ultimately DNA fragmentation. These findings have clear implications for the safety of extensive mobile phone use by males of reproductive age, potentially affecting both their fertility and the health and wellbeing of their offspring."
https://openalex.org/W1967513858,"Bacterial colonization is hypothesized to play a pathogenic role in the non-healing state of chronic wounds. We characterized wound bacteria from a cohort of chronic wound patients using a 16S rRNA gene-based pyrosequencing approach and assessed the impact of diabetes and antibiotics on chronic wound microbiota.We prospectively enrolled 24 patients at a referral wound center in Baltimore, MD; sampled patients' wounds by curette; cultured samples under aerobic and anaerobic conditions; and pyrosequenced the 16S rRNA V3 hypervariable region. The 16S rRNA gene-based analyses revealed an average of 10 different bacterial families in wounds--approximately 4 times more than estimated by culture-based analyses. Fastidious anaerobic bacteria belonging to the Clostridiales family XI were among the most prevalent bacteria identified exclusively by 16S rRNA gene-based analyses. Community-scale analyses showed that wound microbiota from antibiotic treated patients were significantly different from untreated patients (p = 0.007) and were characterized by increased Pseudomonadaceae abundance. These analyses also revealed that antibiotic use was associated with decreased Streptococcaceae among diabetics and that Streptococcaceae was more abundant among diabetics as compared to non-diabetics.The 16S rRNA gene-based analyses revealed complex bacterial communities including anaerobic bacteria that may play causative roles in the non-healing state of some chronic wounds. Our data suggest that antimicrobial therapy alters community structure--reducing some bacteria while selecting for others."
https://openalex.org/W2089285664,"Beside its well described role in the central and peripheral nervous system 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), commonly known as serotonin, is also a potent immuno-modulator. Serotoninergic receptors (5-HTR) are expressed by a broad range of inflammatory cell types, including dendritic cells (DCs). In this study, we aimed to further characterize the immuno-biological properties of serotoninergic receptors on human monocyte-derived DCs. 5-HT was able to induce oriented migration in immature but not in LPS-matured DCs via activation of 5-HTR1 and 5-HTR2 receptor subtypes. Accordingly, 5-HT also increased migration of pulmonary DCs to draining lymph nodes in vivo. By binding to 5-HTR3, 5-HTR4 and 5-HTR7 receptors, 5-HT up-regulated production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6. Additionally, 5-HT influenced chemokine release by human monocyte-derived DCs: production of the potent Th1 chemoattractant IP-10/CXCL10 was inhibited in mature DCs, whereas CCL22/MDC secretion was up-regulated in both immature and mature DCs. Furthermore, DCs matured in the presence of 5-HT switched to a high IL-10 and low IL-12p70 secreting phenotype. Consistently, 5-HT favoured the outcome of a Th2 immune response both in vitro and in vivo. In summary, our study shows that 5-HT is a potent regulator of human dendritic cell function, and that targeting serotoninergic receptors might be a promising approach for the treatment of inflammatory disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1996815931,"TDP-43 is a nuclear protein involved in exon skipping and alternative splicing. Recently, TDP-43 has been identified as the pathological signature protein in frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions and in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In addition, TDP-43-positive inclusions are present in Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and 30% of Alzheimer disease cases. Pathological TDP-43 is redistributed from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it accumulates. An approximately 25-kDa C-terminal fragment of TDP-43 accumulates in affected brain regions, suggesting that it may be involved in the disease pathogenesis. Here, we show that overexpression of the 25-kDa C-terminal fragment is sufficient to cause the mislocalization and cytoplasmic accumulation of endogenous full-length TDP-43 in two different cell lines, thus recapitulating a key biochemical characteristic of TDP-43 proteinopathies. We also found that TDP-43 mislocalization is associated with a reduction in the low molecular mass neurofilament mRNA levels. Notably, we show that the autophagic system plays a role in TDP-43 metabolism. Specifically, we found that autophagy inhibition increases the accumulation of the C-terminal fragments of TDP-43, whereas inhibition of mTOR, a key protein kinase involved in autophagy regulation, reduces the 25-kDa C-terminal fragment accumulation and restores TDP-43 localization. Our results suggest that autophagy induction may be a valid therapeutic target for TDP-43 proteinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2164893989,"Identifying the molecular basis of phenotypes that have evolved independently can provide insight into the ways genetic and developmental constraints influence the maintenance of phenotypic diversity. Melanic (darkly pigmented) phenotypes in mammals provide a potent system in which to study the genetic basis of naturally occurring mutant phenotypes because melanism occurs in many mammals, and the mammalian pigmentation pathway is well understood. Spontaneous alleles of a few key pigmentation loci are known to cause melanism in domestic or laboratory populations of mammals, but in natural populations, mutations at one gene, the melanocortin-1 receptor (Mc1r), have been implicated in the vast majority of cases, possibly due to its minimal pleiotropic effects. To investigate whether mutations in this or other genes cause melanism in the wild, we investigated the genetic basis of melanism in the rodent genus Peromyscus, in which melanic mice have been reported in several populations. We focused on two genes known to cause melanism in other taxa, Mc1r and its antagonist, the agouti signaling protein (Agouti). While variation in the Mc1r coding region does not correlate with melanism in any population, in a New Hampshire population, we find that a 125-kb deletion, which includes the upstream regulatory region and exons 1 and 2 of Agouti, results in a loss of Agouti expression and is perfectly associated with melanic color. In a second population from Alaska, we find that a premature stop codon in exon 3 of Agouti is associated with a similar melanic phenotype. These results show that melanism has evolved independently in these populations through mutations in the same gene, and suggest that melanism produced by mutations in genes other than Mc1r may be more common than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2111362364,"Background Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by deficient expression of the cytoskeletal protein, dystrophin. One third of DMD patients also have mental retardation (MR), likely due to mutations preventing expression of dystrophin and other brain products of the DMD gene expressed from distinct internal promoters. Loss of Dp71, the major DMD-gene product in brain, is thought to contribute to the severity of MR; however, the specific function of Dp71 is poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings Complementary approaches were used to explore the role of Dp71 in neuronal function and identify mechanisms by which Dp71 loss may impair neuronal and cognitive functions. Besides the normal expression of Dp71 in a subpopulation of astrocytes, we found that a pool of Dp71 colocalizes with synaptic proteins in cultured neurons and is expressed in synaptic subcellular fractions in adult brains. We report that Dp71-associated protein complexes interact with specialized modular scaffolds of proteins that cluster glutamate receptors and organize signaling in postsynaptic densities. We then undertook the first functional examination of the brain and cognitive alterations in the Dp71-null mice. We found that these mice display abnormal synapse organization and maturation in vitro, altered synapse density in the adult brain, enhanced glutamatergic transmission and reduced synaptic plasticity in CA1 hippocampus. Dp71-null mice show selective behavioral disturbances characterized by reduced exploratory and novelty-seeking behavior, mild retention deficits in inhibitory avoidance, and impairments in spatial learning and memory. Conclusions/Significance Results suggest that Dp71 expression in neurons play a regulatory role in glutamatergic synapse organization and function, which provides a new mechanism by which inactivation of Dp71 in association with that of other DMD-gene products may lead to increased severity of MR."
https://openalex.org/W2005581471,"The derivation of hepatic progenitor cells from human embryonic stem (hES) cells is of value both in the study of early human liver organogenesis and in the creation of an unlimited source of donor cells for hepatocyte transplantation therapy. Here, we report for the first time the generation of hepatic progenitor cells derived from hES cells. Hepatic endoderm cells were generated by activating FGF and BMP pathways and were then purified by fluorescence activated cell sorting using a newly identified surface marker, N-cadherin. After co-culture with STO feeder cells, these purified hepatic endoderm cells yielded hepatic progenitor colonies, which possessed the proliferation potential to be cultured for an extended period of more than 100 days. With extensive expansion, they co-expressed the hepatic marker AFP and the biliary lineage marker KRT7 and maintained bipotential differentiation capacity. They were able to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells, which expressed ALB and AAT, and into cholangiocyte-like cells, which formed duct-like cyst structures, expressed KRT19 and KRT7, and acquired epithelial polarity. In conclusion, this is the first report of the generation of proliferative and bipotential hepatic progenitor cells from hES cells. These hES cell–derived hepatic progenitor cells could be effectively used as an in vitro model for studying the mechanisms of hepatic stem/progenitor cell origin, self-renewal and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2025643953,"Depletion of mtDNA in myocytes causes insulin resistance and alters nuclear gene expression that may be involved in rescuing processes against cellular stress. Here we show that the expression of C1q tumor necrosis factor alpha-related protein isoform 5 (C1QTNF5) is drastically increased following depletion of mtDNA in myocytes. C1QTNF5 is homologous to adiponectin in respect to domain structure, and its expression and secretion from myocytes correlated negatively with the cellular mtDNA content. Similar to adiponectin, C1QTNF5 induced the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), leading to increased cell surface recruitment of GLUT4 and increased glucose uptake. Treatment of cells with purified recombinant C1QTNF5 increased the phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and stimulated fatty acid oxidation. C1QTNF5-mediated phosphorylation of AMPK or acetyl-CoA carboxylase was unaffected by depletion of adiponectin receptors such as AdipoR1 or AdipoR2, which indicated that adiponectin receptors do not participate in C1QTNF5-induced activation of AMPK. Serum C1QTNF5 levels were significantly higher in obese/diabetic animals (OLETF rats, ob/ob mice, and db/db mice). These results highlight C1QTNF5 as a putative biomarker for mitochondrial dysfunction and a potent activator of AMPK."
https://openalex.org/W1988061447,"Key transmembrane proteins in the innate immune system, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), have been suggested to occur in the genome of non-mammalian organisms including invertebrates. However, authentic invertebrate TLRs have been neither structurally nor functionally investigated. In this paper, we originally present the structures, localization, ligand recognition, activities, and inflammatory cytokine production of all TLRs of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis, designated as Ci-TLR1 and Ci-TLR2. The amino acid sequence of Ci-TLR1 and Ci-TLR2 were found to possess unique structural organization with moderate sequence similarity to functionally characterized vertebrate TLRs. ci-tlr1 and ci-tlr2 genes were expressed predominantly in the stomach and intestine as well as in hemocytes. Ci-TLR1 and Ci-TLR2 expressed in HEK293 cells, unlike vertebrate TLRs, were localized to both the plasma membrane and endosomes. Intriguingly, both Ci-TLR1 and Ci-TLR2 stimulate NF-κB induction in response to multiple pathogenic ligands such as double-stranded RNA, and bacterial cell wall components that are differentially recognized by respective vertebrate TLRs, revealing that Ci-TLRs recognize broader pathogen-associated molecular patterns than vertebrate TLRs. The Ci-TLR-stimulating pathogenic ligands also induced the expression of Ci-TNFα in the intestine and stomach where Ci-TLRs are expressed. These results provide evidence that the TLR-triggered innate immune systems are essentially conserved in ascidians, and that Ci-TLRs possess “hybrid” biological and immunological functions, compared with vertebrate TLRs.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their ligand recognition and signal transduction are distinct from those of vertebrate TLRs, leading to the presumption that they are not regarded as models of the vertebrate-type innate immune system. Moreover, the active protein forms, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), cellular localization of respective deuterostome invertebrate TLRs, or TLR-like receptors and an evolutionary origin of the vertebrate TLR family have never been structurally or functionally elucidated.

In the present study, we identified the structures, tissue distribution, cellular localizations, and ligand-specific activities of all Ciona TLRs, Ci-TLR1 and -2. Our data verified both similar and unique propensities of Ci-TLRs, compared with vertebrate TLRs, suggesting the original features of chordate TLRs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on molecular and functional characterization of TLRs that are localized to the plasma membrane and endosomes and recognize multiple PAMPs. Adults of C. intestinalis were cultivated and collected at the Maizuru Fisheries Research Station of Kyoto University, and kept in seawater at 18 °C. Total RNA was extracted from Ciona hemocytes. The complete sequences of the ci-tlr genes were obtained by 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of the cDNA ends using a 3′- and 5′-rapid amplification of the cDNA ends system for the rapid amplification of cDNA ends kit (Invitrogen). The products were sequenced with primers used for RT-PCR and universal primers (SP6 and T7 primers). The amino acid sequences were aligned using the CLUSTAL program. The alignment was checked by hand. After removing gaps, the verified alignments were used to construct phylogenetic trees.

This is compatible with a previous Ciona genome survey (6Azumi K. De Santis R. De Tomaso A. Rigoutsos I. Yoshizaki F. Pinto M.R. Marino R. Shida K. Ikeda M. Ikeda M. Arai M. Inoue Y. Shimizu T. Satoh N. Rokhsar D.S. Du Pasquier L. Kasahara M. Satake M. Nonaka M. Immunogenetics. 2003; 55: 570-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and suggested that only two TLR-like genes are present in C. intestinalis. The two full-length cDNA sequences were cloned from Ciona hemocytes, and the open reading frames of ci0100137574 and cibd077g18 were found to encode 883 and 948 amino acids, respectively. SMART protein domain analyses revealed that both of the deduced proteins harbor an intracellular TIR domain, a transmembrane domain, and multiple extracellular LRRs, which are reminiscent of vertebrate TLRs (Fig. 1). We thus designated the two genes as ci-tlr1 and ci-tlr2, respectively. Ci-TLR1 and Ci-TLR2 bear 7 and 13 putative LRRs, respectively (Fig. 1). Moreover, Ci-TLR1 contains one LRR C-terminal domain, which is flanked by a cysteine-rich domain, although three LRR C-terminal domains are present in Ci-TLR2 (Fig. 1). Sequence homology of Ci-TLRs to vertebrate counterparts is confounding, compared with vertebrate TLRs (Fig. 1). The overall amino acid sequences of Ci-TLR1 and -2 were most homologous to human TLR (hTLR)7 (26%) and hTLR8 (26%), respectively. The TIR domains of Ci-TLR1 and Ci-TLR2 were most similar to hTLR4 and hTLR6, respectively. The LRRs at 1–330 in Ci-TLR1 are most similar to hTLR5, whereas the LRR at amino acids 331–681 displays the highest similarity to hTLR9 in the corresponding region. In contrast, each portion of the LRR in Ci-TLR2 was most similar to hTLR8. The phylogenetic tree of TLRs and their putative orthologs (Fig. 2) demonstrate that Ci-TLRs undoubtedly belong to the vertebrate TLR family, and suggest the pivotal positions of Ci-TLRs as prototypes of vertebrate TLRs.FIGURE 2A phylogenetic tree of the TLR family constructed by the neighbor-joining method. The number beside each branch indicates the percentage of times that a node was supported in 1000 bootstrap pseudoreplications. These bootstrap values that support >85% are represented.

RT-PCR also showed that both Ci-TLRs were detected in various adult tissues with prominent expression in the stomach, and/or anterior and middle intestines (Fig. 4), whereas Ci-TLR2 expression was slightly less intensive than that of Ci-TLR1 (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4RT-PCR detection of the ci-tlr mRNA.

Moreover, syntaxin-7, which was shown to be co-localized with human TLR3 (36Nakamura N. Yamamoto A. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2106690259,"In any animal model of human disease a positive control therapy that demonstrates efficacy in both the animal model and the human disease can validate the application of that animal model to the discovery of new therapeutics. Such a therapy has recently been reported by Fornai et al. using chronic lithium carbonate treatment and showing therapeutic efficacy in both the high-copy SOD1G93A mouse model of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and in human ALS patients.Seeking to verify this positive control therapy, we tested chronic lithium dosing in a sibling-matched, gender balanced, investigator-blinded trial using the high-copy (average 23 copies) SOD1G93A mouse (n = 27-28/group). Lithium-treated mice received single daily 36.9 mg/kg i.p. injections from 50 days of age through death. This dose delivered 1 mEq/kg (6.94 mg/kg/day lithium ions). Neurological disease severity score and body weight were determined daily during the dosing period. Age at onset of definitive disease and survival duration were recorded. Summary measures from individual body weight changes and neurological score progression, age at disease onset, and age at death were compared using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards analysis. Our study did not show lithium efficacy by any measure.Rigorous survival study design that includes sibling matching, gender balancing, investigator blinding, and transgene copy number verification for each experimental subject minimized the likelihood of attaining a false positive therapeutic effect in this standard animal model of familial ALS. Results from this study do not support taking lithium carbonate into human clinical trials for ALS."
https://openalex.org/W2143024963,"Early onset (DYT1) torsion dystonia is a dominantly inherited movement disorder associated with a three-base pair (DeltaGAG) deletion that removes a glutamic acid residue from the protein torsinA. TorsinA is an essential AAA(+) (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) ATPase found in the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope of higher eukaryotes, but what it does and how changes caused by the DeltaGAG deletion lead to dystonia are not known. Here, we asked how the DYT1 mutation affects association of torsinA with interacting proteins. Using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we first established that the related transmembrane proteins LULL1 and LAP1 are prominent binding partners for torsinA in U2OS cells. Comparative analysis demonstrates that these two proteins are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum or nuclear envelope by their divergent N-terminal domains. Binding of torsinA to their C-terminal lumenal domains is stabilized when residues in any one of three motifs implicated in ATP hydrolysis (Walker B, sensor 1, and sensor 2) are mutated. Importantly, the DeltaGAG deletion does not stabilize this binding. Indeed, deleting the DeltaGAG encoded glutamic acid residue from any of the three ATP hydrolysis mutants destabilizes their association with LULL1 and LAP1C, suggesting a possible basis for loss of torsinA function. Impaired interaction of torsinA with LULL1 and/or LAP1 may thus contribute to the development of dystonia."

Thus, Ezrin may serve as a potential target for anti-metastatic therapy. This study demonstrates that berberine reduces filopodia formation of a nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell line, 5-8F, at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Furthermore, invasion and motility of 5-8F cells are decreased in a dose- and time-dependent manner, resulting in 73.0% invasion and 67.0% motility inhibition at 20 μm. The inhibitory effects of berberine on 5-8F cell metastasis were further confirmed in a mouse model of metastasis. Berberine treatment in vivo resulted in a 51.1% inhibition of tumor metastasis to the lymph nodes and decreased Ezrin phosphorylation at threonine 567 in metastatic samples. Berberine suppressed the presence of phosphorylated Ezrin (phospho-Ezrin) in a dose- and time-dependent manner but had no effect on total Ezrin protein expression at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of berberine on phospho-Ezrin were dependent on the suppression of Rho kinase activity. Reduction of Ezrin phosphorylation at Thr567 by berberine was associated with its inhibitory effect on filopodia formation in 5-8F cells. However, berberine did not effectively inhibit the motility and invasion of NPC cells containing Ezrin Thr567 mutants. These results confirm that berberine inhibits Ezrin phosphorylation at Thr567. Nonetheless, berberine reduces motility and invasion of cells and inhibits tumor metastasis. The reduction of Rho kinase-mediated Ezrin phosphorylation mediated by berberine may be a novel anti-metastatic pathway in NPC 5-8F cells.

Ezrin, a member of the ERM (ezrin-radixin-moesin) family of cytoskeletal proteins, has been implicated in dynamic membrane-based processes, such as the formation and stabilization of filopodia (1Furutani Y. Matsuno H. Kawasaki M. Sasaki T. Mori K. Yoshihara Y. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 8866-8876Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). DNA and protein sequencing indicate that human Ezrin is a highly charged protein with an overall pI of 6.1 and a calculated molecular mass of 69 kDa (2Miaczynska M. Pelkmans L. Zerial M. Curr. Opin.

It is also evolutionarily conserved among widely divergent organisms. Within its N-terminal domain, Ezrin has high amino acid sequence homology to the erythrocyte cytoskeleton protein band 4.1.

Recently, the use of berberine has attracted great attention as an alternative anti-metastasis therapy, considering its low toxicity and low cost. The mechanistic studies on berberine antitumor effects showed that berberine inhibits NADH oxidase, reverse transcriptase, and diaminooxidase (31Slaninová I. Táborská E. Bochoráková H. Slanina J.

Most notably, berberine significantly inhibits the spontaneous mediastinal lymph node metastasis produced by orthotopic implantation of Lewis lung carcinoma into the lung parenchyma in vivo (27Mitani N. Murakami K. Yamaura T. Ikeda T. Saiki I. Cancer Lett. 2001; 165: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and inhibits the motility and invasion of highly metastatic A549 cells at non-cytotoxic concentrations in vitro (33Peng P.L. Hsieh Y.S. Wang C.J. Hsu J.L. Chou F.P. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2006; 214: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In a previous study, the Coptis chinensis compound containing berberine was used to treat patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and NPC metastasis was inhibited (37Liu S.J.

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of these berberine anti-metastatic effects. This study demonstrates that Rho kinase activity is suppressed by berberine, which leads to a reduction in Ezrin phosphorylation at Thr567 in NPC 5-8F cells. Therefore, a novel anti-metastatic mechanism of berberine is identified in this study. 2,3-methylenedioxy-9,10-dimethoxyprotoberberine chloride nasopharyngeal carcinoma 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide lactate dehydrogenase myotonic dystrophykinase-related Cdc42-binding kinase 2 lymphocyte-oriented kinase Rho-binding-domain of rhotekin GTPase-binding domain of p21-activated kinase Ezrin T567A Ezrin T567D glutathione S-transferase phosphate-buffered saline (1)-(R)-trans-4-(1-aminoethyl)-N-(4-pyridyl) cyclohexane-carboxamide dihydrochloride protein kinase C. Berberine was purchased from Sigma. The compound was stored at 4 °C protected from exposure to light. The stock solution of berberine was dissolved in DMSO. The final DMSO concentration in the medium applied to cells was 0.1% (in both control and treated groups) without affecting cell viability. Antibodies against Ezrin were purchased from Covance (Berkeley, CA). Antibody against phosphorylated Ezrin at Thr567 (phospho-Ezrin Thr567) was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Antibodies against Rho kinase, PKC, Rac, Cdc42, GRK2 (G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2), myotonic dystrophykinase-related Cdc42-binding kinase 2 (MRCK), and lymphocyte-oriented kinase (LOK) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against β-actin and normal mouse IgG were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG, were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. GST-Rhotekin-RBD protein-agarose beads were purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc. (Denver, CO). Glutathione-Sepharose 4B was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The protein assay kit was purchased from Bio-Rad (Herndon, VA). Immunoblotting detection reagents were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Chemicals, including DMSO, Tris-HCl, SDS, fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and the MTT inner salt assay, were purchased from Sigma. Human NPC cell lines, 5-8F and 6-10B, were purchased from the Cancer Research Institute of Sun Yatsen University (Guangzhou, China). The 5-8F cell line is highly metastatic, and 6-10B cells are non-metastatic (8Yang X.Y. Ren C.P. Wang L. Li H. Jiang C.J. Zhang H.B. Zhao M. Yao K.T. Cell Oncol. 2005; 27: 215-223PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured as monolayers in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 IU/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) and maintained in an incubator at 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For berberine treatment, appropriate volumes of berberine stock solution were added to the cell cultures to achieve the indicated concentrations and then incubated for the indicated amount of time. After berberine treatment, cell viability was determined by the MTT assay. The dose response of berberine-inhibited Ezrin phosphorylation was investigated in 5-8F cells treated with 2.5, 5, or 10 μm berberine for 24 h. The time course of berberine inhibition was also investigated in 5-8F cells treated with 5 μm berberine for 12, 24, and 48 h. After berberine treatments, cells were harvested for protein extraction. The expression of Ezrin and phospho-Ezrin were detected by immunoblotting. Berberine cytotoxicity was evaluated using the MTT assay to determine cell viability. Briefly, 5-8F cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 3.5 × 103 cells/well and treated with berberine at 0–100 μm concentrations at 37 °C for 24 or 48 h. After the exposure period, medium was removed, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fresh medium was added. Cells were then incubated with 100 μl of MTT (5 mg/ml) in each well for 4 h. The absorbance of formazan produced by production of the MTT compound proportional to the viable cells was recorded at 563 nm with a spectrophotometer. Cytotoxicity of berberine on NPC cells was evaluated by detecting LDH in cell culture media after berberine treatment. Briefly, 5-8F cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well and treated with berberine at 0–100 μm concentrations at 37 °C for 48 h. After the exposure period, media were collected for the LDH assay. LDH activity was detected using the LDH assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Autec Diagnostica Co.). The 5-8F cells with or without berberine treatment were fixed with 2.0% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, washed with PBS three times, and then treated with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After being washed with PBS three times, cells were incubated with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS. After three PBS washes, cells were stained with 5 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin (Sigma) for 40 min and examined using a Zeiss axiophotomicroscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Cells stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole served as a control. Random fields were counted for cells with filopodia. Cultures of 5-8F cells treated with berberine or transfected with plasmids were cultured on CELLocate coverslips (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 2 h at room temperature. Samples were then processed conventionally and observed under a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi Co.). Cells with filopodia were counted. After berberine treatment, cells were harvested and lysed in 1× lysis buffer (1× PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and freshly added 100 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). The cell lysates were then pelleted at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Resultant protein concentrations of each sample were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Equivalent amounts of protein (40 μg/sample) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS for 1 h, incubated with specific antibody against Ezrin (Covance) or phospho-Ezrin (Cell Signaling Technology) for 2 h, and then incubated with an appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. All incubations were carried out at room temperature, and intensive PBS washing was performed after detection with each antibody. After washing three times with PBS, the signal was developed using 4-chloro-1-napthol/3,3-o-diaminobenzidine, and relative photographic density was quantified by a gel documentation and analysis system. β-Actin was used as an internal control to verify basal expression levels and equal protein loading. The ratio of the specific proteins to β-actin was calculated. For cell invasion assays, 5-8F cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of berberine for indicated amounts of time. After berberine treatment, the cells were trypsinized, and their invasiveness was tested using the in vitro Boyden chamber invasion assay (38Attiga F.A. Fernandez P.M. Weeraratna A.T. Manyak M.J. Patierno S.R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4629-4637PubMed Google Scholar). Matrigel (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA) was diluted to 25 mg/50 ml with cold filtered distilled water and applied to 8-μm pore size polycarbonate membrane filters in the chamber. Treated cells were seeded into Boyden chambers (Neuro Probe Inc., Cabin John, MD) at a density of 1.5 × 104 cells/well in 50 μl of serum-free media and incubated for 12 h at 37 °C. The bottom well contained standard medium with 20% fetal bovine serum. The cells invading through the filter of the chamber were fixed with methanol and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Random fields were counted for invading cells under a light microscope. The effects of berberine on cell motility were determined using cells seeded into Boyden chambers without a Matrigel coating. Migration of cells in the presence or absence of berberine was measured as described in the motility assay (38Attiga F.A. Fernandez P.M. Weeraratna A.T. Manyak M.J. Patierno S.R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4629-4637PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was corrected with cell viability to clarify the effects of berberine. Thirty female nude BALB/c mice (5–6 weeks old) were purchased from the Animal Center of Central South University (Hunan, China). They were maintained in the Laboratory for Experiments, Central South University under laminar air flow conditions. The studies were conducted in accordance with the standards established by the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by Central South University. Analysis of metastatic tumors of 5-8F cells was performed as described previously with modifications (27Mitani N. Murakami K. Yamaura T. Ikeda T. Saiki I. Cancer Lett. 2001; 165: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100-μl aliquots of 5-8F, 6-10B-pcDNA3.1, 6-10B-pcDNA3.1- Ezrin M(A), and 6-10B-pcDNA3.1-Ezrin cell suspensions (1 × 104 cells) mixed with Matrigel were injected into the tail vein of nude mice, 10 mice/group, respectively. Two groups of 5-8F cells were given berberine once daily at a concentration of 15 or 30 mg/kg body weight (1 or 2 times the dosage of the human study), respectively. Groups of 6-10B-pcDNA3.1-Ezrin cells were given 15 mg/kg berberine for 30 days starting on day 1 after the injection. Metastasis was evaluated by measuring the weight of the metastasized tumor at mediastinal lymph nodes on day 30 after the injection. Body weight of the nude mice was measured, and other adverse effects of berberine were evaluated. The present study protocols were approved by the ethical committee at Xiangya Hospital of Central South University. Metastasized tumor samples in the nude mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, paraffin-embedded, sectioned, and mounted on slides. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for microscopic examination. Unstained sections were used for staining with antibodies against Ezrin or phospho-Ezrin by immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry followed standard procedures with overnight exposure at room temperature to 1:500 Ezrin antibody or 1:200 phospho-Ezrin antibody diluted in 0.5% nonfat milk. After washing with PBS, the sections were incubated sequentially with a secondary antibody against mouse, peroxidase enzyme label, and diaminobenzidine (Sigma) and then stained with hematoxylin (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA), dehydrated, and mounted under a glass coverslip. Sections stained with normal mouse IgG served as a negative control. Cultures of 5-8F cells (1.0 × 106) were grown in 100-mm dishes for 12–24 h. When cultures were at 70–80% confluence, the cells were treated with berberine for 48 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Treated cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 250 μl of kinase lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). The clarified supernatant fractions containing 500 μg of protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation using antibodies against Rho, PKC, GRK2, MRCK, or LOK, respectively. The precipitation mediating Ezrin phosphorylation was determined by the kinase assay protocol (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Briefly, 20 μg of precipitated complex was added to 2.5 μl of 10× kinase buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm dl-dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 100 mm MgCl2), 2.5 μl (2.5 μg) of a GST-Ezrin fusion protein, 10 μl of diluted ATP mixture (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), 10 μCi of [32P]ATP, and H2O was added to 25 μl. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and then subjected to separation by 12% SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and then dried. Phosphorylated GST-Ezrin was analyzed by autoradiography that determines kinase activity. Various concentrations of berberine (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 μm) were added to 5-8F cells, and a Rho antibody was used to precipitate Rho from treated cells. The immunoprecipitates were incubated with various concentrations of [32P]ATP and 10 μg of histone type 2 as substrates at 30 °C for 30 min in a total volume of 30 μl of the kinase buffer. Incubation was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 4× Laemmli sample buffer. After boiling for 5 min, the mixtures were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and then dried. The bands corresponding to histone type 2 were excised, and the radioactivity was measured. The dissociation constant for binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme (Ki) values were calculated from the equation, Ki = IC50/(1 + S/Km), where S and Km were the concentration of ATP and the Km value for ATP, respectively (39Ishizaki T. Uehata M. Tamechika I. Keel J. Nonomura K. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 976-983PubMed Google Scholar). The pcDNA3.1 and pGEX-5x-1 vectors were purchased from Invitrogen. A DNA fragment encoding the GTPase-binding domain of p21-activated kinase (PAK-PBD), comprising amino acids 68–166, was generated by PCR and cloned into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pGEX-5x-1 and expressed in Escherichia coli as GST-PAK-PBD fusion protein according to the manufacturer's protocol. Ezrin and Rho DNA fragments were also generated by PCR and cloned into the BamHI/XhoI sites of the pcDNA3.1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) to generate pcDNA3.1-Ezrin and pcDNA3.1-Rho plasmids, respectively. For producing GST-Ezrin, the Ezrin DNA fragment was cloned into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pGEX-5x-1 and named pGEX-5x-1-Ezrin. The mutant pcDNA3.1-Ezrin plasmids were generated with the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit and Ezrin mutant primers: Primer 1 (sense), 5′-CAGGGCAACGCCAAGCAGCGCAT-3′; Primer 2 (antisense), 5′-ATGCGCTGCTTGGCGTTGCCCTG-3′; Primer 3 (sense), 5′-CAGGGCAACGACAAGCAGCGCAT-3′; Primer 4 (antisense), 5′-ATGCGCTGCTTGTCGTTGCCCTG-3′. Primer 1 and Primer 2 were used for mutating Thr567 into Ala567 and generated pcDNA3.1-Ezrin Ala567 (pcDNA3.1-Ezrin-M(A)). Primer 3 and Primer 4 were used for mutating Thr567 into Asp567 and generated pcDNA3. 1-Ezrin Asp567 (pcDNA3.1-Ezrin-M(D)). The pU6pro vector was used to construct pU6pro-si-mock (si-mock) and pU6pro-si-Ezrin (si-Ezrin) following the recommended protocol. For the si-mock and si-Ezrin, we synthesized primers for the si-mock (general scramble: sense, 5′-TTTGACTACCGTTGTTATAGGTGTTCAAGAGACACCTATAACAACGGTAGTTTTTT-3′; antisense, 5′-CTAGAAAAAACTACCGTTGTTATAGGTGTCTCTTGAACACCTATAACAACGGTAGT-3′) and for si-Ezrin (Set 1, 5′-CCCCAAAGAUUGGCUUUCC-3′ (position in the open reading frame, 704–722); Set 2, 5′-UCCACUAUGUGGAUAAUAA-3′ (open reading frame, 140–158)). All constructs were confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing. Cultures of 5-8F cells (5.0 × 106) were treated with berberine at 20 and 40 μm for 48 h as described previously. After being washed with ice-cold PBS, they were lysed in 500 μl of kinase lysis buffer. The clarified supernatant fractions containing 400 μg of protein were incubated with 3 μg of GST-Rhotekin-RBD (Cytoskeleton Inc.) (40Ishii S. Kihara Y. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9083-9087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) or GST-PAK-PBD (41Park E.J. Ji K.A. Jeon S.B. Choi W.H. Han I.O. You H.J. Kim J.H. Jou I. Joe E.H. J.

GST fusion proteins were collected by incubation with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h. Precipitates were washed five times in the lysis buffer, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 10 min. After centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g, the supernatants were subjected to immunoblotting with antibodies against Rho, Rac, or Cdc42, respectively. Cultures of 6-10B cells (5.0 × 105) were seeded in 100-mm tissue culture dishes. After culturing at 37 °C for 16–24 h, the cells were transfected with 4 μg of pcDNA3.1 (mock), pcDNA3.1-Ezrin, pcDNA3. 1-Ezrin-M(A), or pcDNA3.1-Ezrin- M(D), respectively, using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol.

https://openalex.org/W2076743693,"The SIRT1 activators isonicotinamide (IsoNAM), resveratrol, fisetin, and butein repressed transcription of the gene for the cytosolic form of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (PEPCK-C). An evolutionarily conserved binding site for hepatic nuclear factor (HNF) 4α (−272/−252) was identified, which was required for transcriptional repression of the PEPCK-C gene promoter caused by these compounds. This site contains an overlapping AP-1 binding site and is adjacent to the C/EBP binding element (−248/−234); the latter is necessary for hepatic transcription of <i>PEPCK-C</i>. AP-1 competed with HNF4α for binding to this site and also decreased HNF4α stimulation of transcription from the PEPCK-C gene promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that HNF4α and AP-1, but not C/EBPβ, reciprocally bound to this site prior to and after treating HepG2 cells with IsoNAM. IsoNAM treatment resulted in deacetylation of HNF4α, which decreased its binding affinity to the PEPCK-C gene promoter. In HNF4α-null Chinese hamster ovary cells, IsoNAM and resveratrol failed to repress transcription from the PEPCK-C gene promoter; overexpression of HNF4α in Chinese hamster ovary cells re-established transcriptional inhibition. Exogenous SIRT1 expression repressed transcription, whereas knockdown of SIRT1 by RNA interference reversed this effect. IsoNAM decreased the level of mRNA for PEPCK-C but had no effect on mRNA for glucose-6-phosphatase in AML12 mouse hepatocytes. We conclude that SIRT1 activation inhibited transcription of the gene for PEPCK-C in part by deacetylation of HNF4α. However, SIRT1 deacetylation of other key regulatory proteins that control PEPCK-C gene transcription also likely contributed to the inhibitory effect."
https://openalex.org/W2147550150,"Background Species diversity is proposed to greatly impact the prevalence of pathogens. Two predominant hypotheses, the “Dilution Effect” and the “Amplification Effect”, predict divergent outcomes with respect to the impact of species diversity. The Dilution Effect predicts that pathogen prevalence will be negatively correlated with increased species diversity, while the Amplification Effect predicts that pathogen prevalence will be positively correlated with diversity. For many host-pathogen systems, the relationship between diversity and pathogen prevalence has not be empirically examined. Methodology/Principal Findings We tested the Dilution and Amplification Effect hypotheses by examining the prevalence of Sin Nombre virus (SNV) with respect to diversity of the nocturnal rodent community. SNV is directly transmitted primarily between deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). Using mark-recapture sampling in the Spring and Fall of 2003–2005, we measured SNV prevalence in deer mice at 16 landscape level sites (3.1 hectares each) that varied in rodent species diversity. We explored several mechanisms by which species diversity may affect SNV prevalence, including reduced host density, reduced host persistence, the presence of secondary reservoirs and community composition. We found a negative relationship between species diversity and SNV prevalence in deer mice, thereby supporting the Dilution Effect hypothesis. Deer mouse density and persistence were lower at sites with greater species diversity; however, only deer mouse persistence was positively correlated with SNV prevalence. Pinyon mice (P. truei) may serve as dilution agents, having a negative effect on prevalence, while kangaroo rats (Dipodomys ordii), may have a positive effect on the prevalence of SNV, perhaps through effects on deer mouse behavior. Conclusions/Significance While previous studies on host-pathogen systems have found patterns of diversity consistent with either the Dilution or Amplification Effects, the mechanisms by which species diversity influences prevalence have not been investigated. Our study indicates that changes in host persistence, coupled with interspecific interactions, are important mechanisms through which diversity may influence patterns of pathogens. Our results reveal the complexity of rodent community interactions with respect to SNV dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2076719913,"In general, rapid morphological change in mammals has been infrequently documented. Examples that do exist are almost exclusively of rodents on islands. Such changes are usually attributed to selective release or founder events related to restricted gene flow in island settings. Here we document rapid morphological changes in rodents in 20 of 28 museum series collected on four continents, including 15 of 23 mainland sites. Approximately 17,000 measurements were taken of 1302 rodents. Trends included both increases and decreases in the 15 morphological traits measured, but slightly more trends were towards larger size. Generalized linear models indicated that changes in several of the individual morphological traits were associated with changes in human population density, current temperature gradients, and/or trends in temperature and precipitation. When we restricted these analyses to samples taken in the US (where data on human population trends were presumed to be more accurate), we found changes in two additional traits to be positively correlated with changes in human population density. Principle component analysis revealed general trends in cranial and external size, but these general trends were uncorrelated with climate or human population density. Our results indicate that over the last 100+ years, rapid morphological change in rodents has occurred quite frequently, and that these changes have taken place on the mainland as well as on islands. Our results also suggest that these changes may be driven, at least in part, by human population growth and climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2013523663,"In vivo, stem cell fate is regulated by local microenvironmental parameters. Governing parameters in this stem cell niche include soluble factors, extra-cellular matrix, and cell-cell interactions. The complexity of this in vivo niche limits analyses into how individual niche parameters regulate stem cell fate. Herein we use mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) and micro-contact printing (microCP) to investigate how niche size controls endogenous signaling thresholds. microCP is used to restrict colony diameter, separation, and degree of clustering. We show, for the first time, spatial control over the activation of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway (Jak-Stat). The functional consequences of this niche-size-dependent signaling control are confirmed by demonstrating that direct and indirect transcriptional targets of Stat3, including members of the Jak-Stat pathway and pluripotency-associated genes, are regulated by colony size. Modeling results and empirical observations demonstrate that colonies less than 100 microm in diameter are too small to maximize endogenous Stat3 activation and that colonies separated by more than 400 microm can be considered independent from each other. These results define parameter boundaries for the use of ESCs in screening studies, demonstrate the importance of context in stem cell responsiveness to exogenous cues, and suggest that niche size is an important parameter in stem cell fate control."
https://openalex.org/W2023570702,"Vitamin D may play a protective role in many diseases. Public health messages are advocating sun avoidance to reduce skin cancer risk but the potential deleterious effects of these recommendations for vitamin D metabolism have been poorly investigated.We investigated the association between 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D), skin type and ultraviolet exposure in 1414 Caucasian females in the UK. Mean age of the cohort was 47 years (18-79) and mean 25(OH)D levels were 77 nmol/L (6-289). 25(OH)D levels were strongly associated with season of sampling with higher levels in the spring and summer months (p<0.0001). Light skin types (skin type 1 and 2) have lower levels of 25(OH)D (mean 71 nmol/L) compared to darker skin types (skin type 3 and 4) (mean 82 nmol/L) after adjusting for multiple confounders (p<0.0001). The trend for increasing risk of low vitamin D with fairer skin types was highly significant despite adjustment for all confounders (p = 0.001).Contrary to previous studies across different ethnic backgrounds, this study within Caucasian UK females shows that fair skin types have lower levels of 25(OH)D compared to darker skin types with potential detrimental health effects. Public health campaigns advocating sun avoidance in fair skinned individuals may need to be revised in view of their risk of vitamin D deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2045017787,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) require proteolytic activation by members of the proprotein convertase (PC) family. Pro-BMP4 is initially cleaved at a site adjacent to the mature ligand domain (S1) and then at an upstream site (S2) within the prodomain. Cleavage at the S2 site, which appears to occur in a tissue-specific fashion, regulates the activity and signaling range of mature BMP4. To test the hypothesis that tissue-specific cleavage of pro-BMP4 is regulated by differential expression of a site-specific protease, we identified the PCs that cleave each site in vivo. In Xenopus oocytes, furin and PC6 function redundantly to cleave both the S1 and S2 sites of pro-BMP4, as evidenced by the results of antisense-mediated gene knockdown and the use of the furin- and PC6-selective inhibitor alpha(1)-PDX. By contrast, alpha(1)-PDX blocked cleavage of the S2 but not the S1 site of pro-BMP4 in embryos, suggesting the existence of a developmentally regulated S1 site-specific convertase. This protease is likely to be PC7 based on knowledge of its required substrate cleavage motif and resistance to alpha(1)-PDX. Consistent with this prediction, an alpha(1)-PDX variant engineered to target PC7, in addition to furin and PC6, completely inhibited cleavage of BMP4 in oocytes and embryos. Further studies showed that pc7 transcripts are expressed and polyadenylated, and that the PC7 precursor protein undergoes efficient autocatalytic activation in both oocytes and embryos. These results suggest that PC7, or a convertase with similar substrate specificity, functions to selectively cleave the S1 site of pro-BMP4 in a developmentally regulated fashion."
https://openalex.org/W2066583853,"Tumor cell migration plays a central role in the process of cancer metastasis. We recently identified dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa (DARPP-32) as an antimigratory phosphoprotein in breast cancer cells. Here we link this effect of DARPP-32 to Wnt-5a signaling by demonstrating that recombinant Wnt-5a triggers cAMP elevation at the plasma membrane and Thr34-DARPP-32 phosphorylation in MCF-7 cells. In agreement, both protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitors and siRNA-mediated knockdown of Frizzled-3 receptor or Galpha(s) expression abolished Wnt-5a-induced phosphorylation of DARPP-32. Furthermore, Wnt-5a induced DARPP-32-dependent inhibition of MCF-7 cell migration. Phospho-Thr-34-DARPP-32 interacted with protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) and potentiated the Wnt-5a-mediated phosphorylation of CREB, a well-known PP1 substrate, but had no effect on CREB phosphorylation by itself. Moreover, inhibition of the Wnt-5a/DARPP-32/CREB pathway, by expression of dominant negative CREB (DN-CREB), diminished the antimigratory effect of Wnt-5a-induced phospho-Thr-34-DARPP-32. Phalloidin-staining revealed that that the presence of phospho-Thr-34-DARPP-32 in MCF-7 cells results in reduced filopodia formation. In accordance, the activity of the Rho GTPase Cdc42, known to be crucial for filopodia formation, was reduced in MCF-7 cells expressing phospho-Thr-34-DARPP-32. The effects of DARPP-32 on cell migration and filopodia formation could be reversed in T47D breast cancer cells that were depleted of their endogenous DARPP-32 by siRNA targeting. Consequently, Wnt-5a activates a Frizzled-3/Galpha(s)/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway that triggers a DARPP-32- and CREB-dependent antimigratory response in breast cancer cells, representing a novel mechanism whereby Wnt-5a can inhibit breast cancer cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2031380876,"Inducible nitric-oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) plays a critical role in the eradication of intracellular pathogens. However, the excessive production of NO by iNOS has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of septic shock syndrome. Previously, we have demonstrated that mice deficient in mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) exhibit exaggerated inflammatory responses and rapidly succumb to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In response to LPS, MKP-1(-/-) mice produce greater amounts of inflammatory cytokines and NO than do wild-type mice, and the MKP-1(-/-) mice exhibit severe hypotension. To understand the molecular basis for the increase in NO production, we studied the role of MKP-1 in the regulation of iNOS expression. We found that LPS challenge elicited a stronger iNOS induction in MKP-1 knock-out mice than in wild-type mice. Likewise, LPS treatment also resulted in greater iNOS expression in macrophages from MKP-1(-/-) mice than in macrophages from wild-type mice. Both accelerated gene transcription and enhanced mRNA stability contribute to the increases in iNOS expression in LPS-stimulated MKP-1(-/-) macrophages. We found that STAT-1, a transcription factor known to mediate iNOS induction by interferon-gamma, was more potently activated by LPS in MKP-1(-/-) macrophages than in wild-type cells. MicroRNA array analysis indicated that microRNA (miR)-155 expression was increased in MKP-1-deficient macrophages compared with wild-type macrophages. Transfection of miR-155 attenuated the expression of Suppressor of Cytokine Signal (SOCS)-1 and enhanced the expression of iNOS. Our results suggest that MKP-1 may negatively regulate iNOS expression by controlling the expression of miR-155 and consequently the STAT pathway via SOCS-1."

Evidence to date suggests that altered conformations of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mutant SOD1s trigger perturbations of cellular homeostasis that ultimately cause motor neuron degeneration. In this study we correlated the metal contents and disulfide bond status of purified wild-type (WT) and mutant SOD1 proteins to changes in electrophoretic mobility and surface hydrophobicity as detected by 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (ANS) fluorescence. As-isolated WT and mutant SOD1s were copper-deficient and exhibited mobilities that correlated with their expected negative charge. However, upon disulfide reduction and demetallation at physiological pH, both WT and mutant SOD1s underwent a conformational change that produced a slower mobility indicative of partial unfolding. Furthermore, although ANS did not bind appreciably to the WT holoenzyme, incubation of metal-deficient WT or mutant SOD1s with ANS increased the ANS fluorescence and shifted its peak toward shorter wavelengths. This increased interaction with ANS was greater for the mutant SOD1s and could be reversed by the addition of metal ions, especially Cu2+, even for SOD1 variants incapable of forming the disulfide bond. Overall, our findings support the notion that misfolding associated with metal deficiency may facilitate aberrant interactions of SOD1 with itself or with other cellular constituents and may thereby contribute to neuronal toxicity.

When recombinant human SOD1 was overexpressed in insect cells, we instead observed zinc-replete but copper-deficient species for most WT-like mutants, probably because the capacity of the copper-loading mechanism was exceeded (17Hayward L.J.

These preparations indicate that zinc can be efficiently incorporated into many WT-like mutants in vivo, and much of it is retained after purification. Furthermore, these copper-deficient biologically metallated proteins may be useful reagents to assess the influence of copper binding upon other properties of SOD1 mutants that may be relevant to their neurotoxicity. We previously observed that reduction of the Cys-57—Cys-146 disulfide bond facilitates the ability of metal chelators to alter the electrophoretic mobility and to increase the hydrophobicity of SOD1 mutants (5Tiwari A. Xu Z. Hayward L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29771-29779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the known properties of this linkage to stabilize the dimeric interface, to orient Arg-143 via a hydrogen bond from the carbonyl oxygen of Cys-57 to Arg-143-NH2, and to prevent metal ion loss (38Banci L.

However, it remains unclear whether the Cys-57—Cys-146 bond is required to prevent abnormal SOD1 hydrophobic exposure or whether the aberrant conformational change primarily results from metal ion loss. Ablation of the disulfide bond by the experimental (non-ALS) mutants C57S and C146S provides useful reagents to test the relative influence of the disulfide bond and copper binding upon SOD1 properties. In this study we sought to correlate the consequences of copper deficiency, copper and zinc deficiency, and disulfide reduction upon the hydrodynamic behavior and surface hydrophobicity of WT and representative mutant SOD1 enzymes (Fig. 1A). We quantitated the metal contents of as-isolated SOD1 proteins, detected changes in conformation or metal occupancy using native PAGE to assess their electrophoretic mobility, a measure of global conformational change, and correlated these changes to hydrophobic exposure using 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (ANS), which is very sensitive to local conformational changes. ANS is a small amphipathic dye (Fig. 1B) that has been used as a sensitive probe to detect hydrophobic pockets on protein surfaces (41Slavík J. Biochim. Biophys.

Free ANS exhibits only weak fluorescence that is maximal near 520 nm, but when ANS binds to a hydrophobic site in a partially or fully folded protein, the fluorescence peak increases in amplitude and shifts to a shorter wavelength (42Matulis D. Baumann C.G. Bloomfield V.A. Lovrien R.E. Biopolymers. 1999; 49: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). ANS also has an anionic sulfonate group that can interact with cationic groups (e.g. Arg or Lys residues) through ion-pair formation which may be further strengthened by hydrophobic interactions (43Gasymov O.K.

To evaluate further the importance of metal ion binding, we measured spectral changes related to the binding of cobalt and copper to the same SOD1 proteins. We observed that as-isolated WT-like mutants containing zinc could interact with copper ions to produce an electrophoretic mobility and decreased hydrophobicity resembling that of the fully metalated holo-WT SOD1. In contrast, we saw no evidence for copper binding to MBR mutants in a manner that alters their hydrodynamic properties or their hydrophobicity. Our data suggest that binding of both copper and zinc are important determinants of SOD1 conformation and that perturbation of such binding may be relevant to the ALS disease process. EDTA was from Invitrogen; sodium phosphate (monobasic and dibasic), potassium phosphate (monobasic and dibasic), KCl, NaCl, glycine, and Tris base were from J. T. Baker Inc.; ANS was from Invitrogen; Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), Coomassie Plus protein assay kit, BCA protein assay kit, and Gel Code blue were from Pierce; HEPES-free acid was from VWR; iodoacetamide, sodium acetate, native PAGE markers, trehalose, CoCl2, CuCl2, ZnCl2, and KOH were from Sigma; 1,4-dithiothreitol, SDS, HCl, methanol, and acetic acid were from EM Science; dual color SDS-PAGE markers, ChelexTM-100 resin, and bromphenol blue were from Bio-Rad. All solutions were prepared using Milli-Q (Millipore) ultrapurified water. Human WT or ALS-related mutant SOD1 enzymes (A4V, G85R, G93A, D124V, D125H, and S134N) containing biologically incorporated metal ions were isolated from a baculoviral expression system as described previously (17Hayward L.J. Rodriguez J.A. Kim J.W. Tiwari A. Goto J.J. Cabelli D.E. Valentine J.S. Brown Jr., R.H. J. Biol.

Proteins expressed in insect cells were purified by solubility in 60% NH4(SO4)2 followed by sequential hydrophobic interaction and ion exchange gradient chromatography at physiological pH values as described (17Hayward L.J. Rodriguez J.A. Kim J.W. Tiwari A. Goto J.J. Cabelli D.E. Valentine J.S. Brown Jr., R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15923-15931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined spectroscopically using a dimeric molar extinction coefficient of 10,800 m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm (47Goto J.J. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Cabelli D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30104-30109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and also by a modified Bradford assay (Coomassie PlusTM, Pierce). EDTA (0.1 mm) was included in the isolation buffer to inhibit proteases and also to remove any loosely bound metals before metal content analysis. Non-ALS mutant SOD1s lacking the disulfide bond (C57S and C146S) were expressed in the EGy118 strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and purified as described previously (48Doucette P.A. Whitson L.J.

The metal contents of all the SOD1 proteins were assessed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Agilent 7500ce) and an octopole reaction system utilizing both hydrogen and helium gas for polyatomic interference removal at the UCLA Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry Elemental Analysis and Speciation Facility. The fully metallated holoenzyme is expected to contain two equivalents each of copper and zinc per dimer. ApoWT SOD1, lacking both copper and zinc, was prepared using a demetallation protocol modified from Lyons et al., (49Lyons T.J. Nersissian A. Goto J.J. Zhu H. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 650-662Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, WT SOD1 was dialyzed against 100 mm acetate buffer (pH 3.8) in the presence of 10 mm EDTA for 48 h at 4 °C with 3 changes against 1 liter of buffer every 10–12 h. The protein was then dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 100 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 1 mm EDTA. The buffers used for further dialysis were treated with ChelexTM 100 resin (Bio-Rad) to remove any contaminating metal ions. SOD1 was equilibrated with 2 changes of a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) plus 150 mm KCl. After dialysis, the protein was concentrated by centrifugal filtration (Amicon Ultra, Millipore). Metal content analysis was performed as above following the demetallation procedure. Purified SOD1 proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis under native, non-reducing, fully denaturing, or partially denaturing conditions as described previously (5Tiwari A. Xu Z. Hayward L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29771-29779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 17Hayward L.J. Rodriguez J.A. Kim J.W. Tiwari A. Goto J.J. Cabelli D.E. Valentine J.S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 5984-5992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). For native PAGE, proteins were equilibrated for 30 min with the non-denaturing sample buffer (62 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) before running on 15% gels (unless otherwise indicated) using ice-cold Tris-glycine buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine (pH 8.3)). For non-reducing SDS-PAGE and analysis of disulfide bond status, samples were treated with 5 mm iodoacetamide for 1 h at 25 °C before the addition of non-reducing sample buffer (62 mm Tris (pH 6.8) 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue). Samples were boiled for 3 min and then loaded on 15% gels. Steady-state fluorescence spectra were collected using a T-format Spex Fluorolog-3 (Instruments S. A. Inc., Edison, NJ) outfitted with Glan-Thompson polarizers at the Univ. of Massachusetts Medical School Dept. of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology. Samples were excited with vertically polarized light at 370 nm and detected at the optimal angle (54.7°) to eliminate polarization bias from the monochromators and detectors. Bandwidths were 5 and 10 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. Spectra were collected 3 times using a 1-nm step size and a 0.5-s integration time at 25 °C and then averaged. Except for the ANS titration, all experiments were performed at pH 7.2 using 10 μm ANS with 10 μm dimeric SOD1 either in phosphate buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2) + 150 mm KCl + 200 mm trehalose) or in HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) + 150 mm KCl + 200 mm trehalose). ANS was incubated with proteins for 1 h at 25 °C before collecting the spectra. Increasing amounts of ANS (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 μm) were added to 10 μm dimeric SOD1 proteins (holo-WT or G85R), and the mixtures were equilibrated at 25 °C for 10 min before acquiring each spectrum. Titration of ANS into the buffer without protein yielded a fluorescence peak at 518 ± 1.5 nm for free ANS that was independent of the ANS concentration, and these curves provided a constraint for subsequent fitting. ANS titration spectra were fitted globally to a single site binding model ([P] + [ANS] ↔ [P/ANS]) using a Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least-squares algorithm implemented in Savuka Version 6.2 (50Zitzewitz J.A. Bilsel O. Luo J. Jones B.E. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12812-12819Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 51Bilsel O. Zitzewitz J.A. Bowers K.E. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1018-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). ANS fluorescence values at emission wavelengths from 400–600 nm were fitted simultaneously with the Kd as a global variable parameter. The free ANS fluorescence intensity at a given wavelength was a local parameter fixed to the experimentally determined free ANS fluorescence spectrum. A global scaling parameter for the free ANS spectrum was used to account for differences in the system gain and small (<5%) variations in the determination of the ANS concentration. The bound ANS fluorescence intensity at each wavelength (for 201 values using 1-nm increments) was treated as a local variable parameter to be optimized during the fit. In total, 203 parameters (201 local and 2 global) were simultaneously fitted to 201 binding curves. This analysis yielded a Kd value for ANS binding and allowed us to deconvolute the spectra for bound versus free ANS fluorescence. 10 μm ANS was found to be optimal to ensure detection of weak binding to holo-WT SOD1 yet avoid excessive fluorescence from free ANS (Fig. 3). Titrations of the SOD1 proteins with solutions of copper and cobalt chloride were monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy using a Hewlett Packard 8453 spectrophotometer (Wilmington, DE). Five scans were averaged for each spectrum using a Hewlett Packard UV-visible Chemstation (Version A.06.04) and were analyzed using Origin (MicroCal) software. A volume of 150 μl of 0.15–0.25 mm dimeric SOD1 was titrated with 2 eq/dimer of a 10 mm metal chloride solution. All titrations were in HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) + 150 mm KCl). After the addition and mixing of metal ions, the protein solutions were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C before spectral observations and were maintained at 4 °C between successive scans. We purified the WT and five familial ALS-associated human SOD1 mutants (A4V, G85R, G93A, D124V, and S134N) from an insect cell expression system (17Hayward L.J. Rodriguez J.A. Kim J.W. Tiwari A.

These mutants (Fig. 1A) were selected because (i) they are located in distinct regions of the enzyme, (ii) many of their physicochemical and structural properties have been characterized, and (iii) they include variants shown to produce an ALS phenotype in transgenic rodent models (A4V, G85R, and G93A) (1Bruijn L"
https://openalex.org/W2042831799,"Endothelial control of vascular smooth muscle plays a major role in the resulting vasoreactivity implicated in physiological or pathological circulatory processes. However, a comprehensive understanding of endothelial (EC)/smooth muscle cells (SMC) crosstalk is far from complete. Here, we have examined the role of gap junctions and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this crosstalk and we demonstrate an active contribution of SMC to endothelial control of vasomotor tone.In small intrapulmonary arteries, quantitative RT-PCR, Western Blot analyses and immunofluorescent labeling evidenced connexin (Cx) 37, 40 and 43 in EC and/or SMC. Functional experiments showed that the Cx-mimetic peptide targeted against Cx 37 and Cx 43 ((37,43)Gap27) (1) reduced contractile and calcium responses to serotonin (5-HT) simultaneously recorded in pulmonary arteries and (2) abolished the diffusion in SMC of carboxyfluorescein-AM loaded in EC. Similarly, contractile and calcium responses to 5-HT were decreased by superoxide dismutase and catalase which, catabolise superoxide anion and H(2)O(2), respectively. Both Cx- and ROS-mediated effects on the responses to 5-HT were reversed by L-NAME, a NO synthase inhibitor or endothelium removal. Electronic paramagnetic resonance directly demonstrated that 5-HT-induced superoxide anion production originated from the SMC. Finally, whereas 5-HT increased NO production, it also decreased cyclic GMP content in isolated intact arteries.These data demonstrate that agonist-induced ROS production in SMC targeting EC via myoendothelial gap junctions reduces endothelial NO-dependent control of pulmonary vasoreactivity. Such SMC modulation of endothelial control may represent a signaling pathway controlling vasoreactivity under not only physiological but also pathological conditions that often implicate excessive ROS production."
https://openalex.org/W2050799629,"There are several important questions on the coupling between properties of the protein shape and the rate of protein folding. We have studied a series of structural descriptors intended for describing protein shapes (the radius of gyration, the radius of cross-section, and the coefficient of compactness) and their possible connection with folding behavior, either rates of folding or the emergence of folding intermediates, and compared them with classical descriptors, protein chain length and contact order. It has been found that when a descriptor is normalized to eliminate the influence of the protein size (the radius of gyration normalized to the radius of gyration of a ball of equal volume, the coefficient of compactness defined as the ratio of the accessible surface area of a protein to that of an ideal ball of equal volume, and relative contact order) it completely looses its ability to predict folding rates. On the other hand, when a descriptor correlates well with protein size (the radius of cross-section and absolute contact order in our consideration) then it correlates well with the logarithm of folding rates and separates reasonably well two-state folders from multi-state ones. The critical control for the performance of new descriptors demonstrated that the radius of cross-section has a somewhat higher predictive power (the correlation coefficient is −0.74) than size alone (the correlation coefficient is −0.65). So, we have shown that the numerical descriptors of the overall shape-geometry of protein structures are one of the important determinants of the protein-folding rate and mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2130230977,"Background The constant increase of cancer cell resistance to radio- and chemotherapy hampers improvement of patient survival and requires novel targeting approaches. Integrin-Linked Kinase (ILK) has been postulated as potent druggable cancer target. On the basis of our previous findings clearly showing that ILK transduces antisurvival signals in cells exposed to ionizing radiation, this study evaluated the impact of the small molecule inhibitor QLT0267, reported as putative ILK inhibitor, on the cellular radiation survival response of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells (hHNSCC). Methodology/Principal Findings Parental FaDu cells and FaDu cells stably transfected with a constitutively active ILK mutant (FaDu-IH) or empty vectors, UTSCC45 cells, ILKfloxed/floxed(fl/fl) and ILK−/− mouse fibroblasts were used. Cells grew either two-dimensionally (2D) on or three-dimensionally (3D) in laminin-rich extracellular matrix. Cells were treated with QLT0267 alone or in combination with irradiation (X-rays, 0–6 Gy single dose). ILK knockdown was achieved by small interfering RNA transfection. ILK kinase activity, clonogenic survival, number of residual DNA double strand breaks (rDSB; γH2AX/53BP1 foci assay), cell cycle distribution, protein expression and phosphorylation (e.g. Akt, p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)) were measured. Data on ILK kinase activity and phosphorylation of Akt and p44/42 MAPK revealed a broad inhibitory spectrum of QLT0267 without specificity for ILK. QLT0267 significantly reduced basal cell survival and enhanced the radiosensitivity of FaDu and UTSCC45 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. QLT0267 exerted differential, cell culture model-dependent effects with regard to radiogenic rDSB and accumulation of cells in the G2 cell cycle phase. Relative to corresponding controls, FaDu-IH and ILKfl/fl fibroblasts showed enhanced radiosensitivity, which failed to be antagonized by QLT0267. A knockdown of ILK revealed no change in clonogenic survival of the tested cell lines as compared to controls. Conclusions/Significance Our data clearly show that the small molecule inhibitor QLT0267 has potent cytotoxic and radiosensitizing capability in hHNSCC cells. However, QLT0267 is not specific for ILK. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are necessary to clarify the potential of QLT0267 as a targeted therapeutic in the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W2059928714,"We report on the paleopathological analysis of the partial skeleton of the late Pliocene hominin species Australopithecus africanus Stw 431 from Sterkfontein, South Africa. A previous study noted the presence of lesions on vertebral bodies diagnosed as spondylosis deformans due to trauma. Instead, we suggest that these lesions are pathological changes due to the initial phases of an infectious disease, brucellosis. The macroscopic, microscopic and radiological appearance of the lytic lesions of the lumbar vertebrae is consistent with brucellosis. The hypothesis of brucellosis (most often associated with the consumption of animal proteins) in a 2.4 to 2.8 million year old hominid has a host of important implications for human evolution. The consumption of meat has been regarded an important factor in supporting, directing or altering human evolution. Perhaps the earliest (up to 2.5 million years ago) paleontological evidence for meat eating consists of cut marks on animal remains and stone tools that could have made these marks. Now with the hypothesis of brucellosis in A. africanus, we may have evidence of occasional meat eating directly linked to a fossil hominin."
https://openalex.org/W2096729702,"The sound-induced flash illusion is an auditory-visual illusion--when a single flash is presented along with two or more beeps, observers report seeing two or more flashes. Previous research has shown that the illusion gradually disappears as the temporal delay between auditory and visual stimuli increases, suggesting that the illusion is consistent with existing temporal rules of neural activation in the superior colliculus to multisensory stimuli. However little is known about the effect of spatial incongruence, and whether the illusion follows the corresponding spatial rule. If the illusion occurs less strongly when auditory and visual stimuli are separated, then integrative processes supporting the illusion must be strongly dependant on spatial congruence. In this case, the illusion would be consistent with both the spatial and temporal rules describing response properties of multisensory neurons in the superior colliculus.The main aim of this study was to investigate the importance of spatial congruence in the flash-beep illusion. Selected combinations of one to four short flashes and zero to four short 3.5 KHz tones were presented. Observers were asked to count the number of flashes they saw. After replication of the basic illusion using centrally-presented stimuli, the auditory and visual components of the illusion stimuli were presented either both 10 degrees to the left or right of fixation (spatially congruent) or on opposite (spatially incongruent) sides, for a total separation of 20 degrees.The sound-induced flash fission illusion was successfully replicated. However, when the sources of the auditory and visual stimuli were spatially separated, perception of the illusion was unaffected, suggesting that the ""spatial rule"" does not extend to describing behavioural responses in this illusion. We also find no evidence for an associated ""fusion"" illusion reportedly occurring when multiple flashes are accompanied by a single beep."
https://openalex.org/W2018629811,"Background Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), in particular mobilized peripheral blood stem cells, represent an attractive target for cell and gene therapy. Efficient gene delivery into these target cells without compromising self-renewal and multi-potency is crucial for the success of gene therapy. We investigated factors involved in the ex vivo transduction of CD34+ HSCs in order to develop a clinically relevant transduction protocol for gene delivery. Specifically sought was a protocol that allows for efficient transduction with minimal ex vivo manipulation without serum or other reagents of animal origin. Methodology/Principal Findings Using commercially available G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood (PB) CD34+ cells as the most clinically relevant target, we systematically examined factors including the use of serum, cytokine combinations, pre-stimulation time, multiplicity of infection (MOI), transduction duration and the use of spinoculation and/or retronectin. A self-inactivating lentiviral vector (SIN-LV) carrying enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used as the gene delivery vehicle. HSCs were monitored for transduction efficiency, surface marker expression and cellular function. We were able to demonstrate that efficient gene transduction can be achieved with minimal ex vivo manipulation while maintaining the cellular function of transduced HSCs without serum or other reagents of animal origin. Conclusions/Significance This study helps to better define factors relevant towards developing a standard clinical protocol for the delivery of SIN-LV into CD34+ cells."
https://openalex.org/W2021026113,"A major challenge in biomedical studies in recent years has been the classification of gene expression profiles into categories, such as cases and controls. This is done by first training a classifier by using a labeled training set containing labeled samples from the two populations, and then using that classifier to predict the labels of new samples. Such predictions have recently been shown to improve the diagnosis and treatment selection practices for several diseases. This procedure is complicated, however, by the high dimensionality if the data. While microarrays can measure the levels of thousands of genes per sample, case-control microarray studies usually involve no more than several dozen samples. Standard classifiers do not work well in these situations where the number of features (gene expression levels measured in these microarrays) far exceeds the number of samples. Selecting only the features that are most relevant for discriminating between the two categories can help construct better classifiers, in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. In this work we developed a novel method for multivariate feature selection based on the Partial Least Squares algorithm. We compared the method's variants with common feature selection techniques across a large number of real case-control datasets, using several classifiers. We demonstrate the advantages of the method and the preferable combinations of classifier and feature selection technique."
https://openalex.org/W2134204149,"Global transcriptome analysis of whole blood RNA using microarrays has been proven to be challenging due to the high abundance of globin transcripts that constitute 70% of whole blood mRNA. This is a particular problem in patients with sickle cell disease, secondary to the high abundance of globin-expressing nucleated red blood cells and reticulocytes in the circulation. In order to accurately measure the steady state blood transcriptome in sickle cell patients we evaluated the efficacy of reducing globin transcripts in PAXgene stabilized RNA for genome-wide transcriptome analyses using microarrays. We demonstrate here by both microarrays and Q-PCR that the globin mRNA depletion method resulted in 55–65 fold reduction in globin transcripts in whole blood collected from healthy volunteers and sickle cell disease patients. This led to an improvement in microarray data quality by reducing data variability, with increased detection rate of expressed genes and improved overlap with the expression signatures of isolated peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) preparations. Analysis of differences between the whole blood transcriptome and PBMC transcriptome revealed important erythrocyte genes that participate in sickle cell pathogenesis and compensation. The combination of globin mRNA reduction after whole-blood RNA stabilization represents a robust clinical research methodology for the discovery of biomarkers for hematologic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2043711000,"Tumors of the exocrine pancreas have a poor prognosis. Several proteins are overexpressed in this cancer type, including the MET tyrosine kinase receptor and the transcription factor PAX6. In this report, we find that PAX6(5a), an alternately spliced variant form of PAX6, is expressed in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines at higher levels than the canonical PAX6 protein. Both protein forms of PAX6 bind directly to an enhancer element in the MET promoter and activate the expression of the MET gene. In addition, inhibition of PAX6 transcripts leads to a decline in cell growth and survival, differentiation, and a concurrent reduction of MET protein expression.

Gut. 2007; 56: 1134-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Several genetic pathways have been identified as being active in the progression of this tumor, including signaling through MET (MET tyrosine kinase receptor protein). The MET gene encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor for the ligand hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor. The MET gene produces a partially glycosylated 170-kDa precursor protein. This precursor is glycosylated further and cleaved into a 50-kDa α chain and a 140-kDa β chain to create a mature receptor (2Giordano S. Ponzetto C. Di Renzo M.F. Cooper C.S. Comoglio P.M. Nature. 1989; 339: 155-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The MET receptor is essential for normal development and plays a role in cell migration, growth, survival, differentiation, angiogenesis, and tube formation/branching morphogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 3Gentile A. Trusolino L. Comoglio P.M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2008; 27: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). MET has also been implicated in cancer progression and is directly involved in metastasis, resistance to apoptosis, and tumor growth. MET is expressed in the developing pancreatic bud of the embryo and marks candidate stem/progenitor cells in the embryonic and adult pancreas (4Oshima Y. Suzuki A. Kawashimo K. Ishikawa M.

Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2177-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The transcription factor PAX3 can also activate MET expression during the embryonic development of muscle cells (23Epstein J.A. Shapiro D.N. Cheng J. Lam P.Y. Maas R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 4213-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). PAX3 belongs to the PAX gene family, and most of what is known about these related proteins is their role during development. Only recently has the expression of PAX proteins in adult stem cells and in disease been discovered. We found the PAX3-related protein PAX6 expressed in pancreatic cancer frequently, with expression in 32 of 46 (69.6%) of primary tumors and 9 of 10 established cell lines (24Lang D. Mascarenhas J.B. Powell S.K. Halegoua J. Nelson M. Ruggeri B.A. Mol. Carcinog. 2008; 47: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In our studies, we find that PAX6 is linked to inhibiting differentiation and growth arrest. Inducing differentiation in pancreatic cancer cells triggers a down-regulation of PAX6 expression, whereas a direct inhibition of the PAX6 transcript produces the same differentiated phenotype. Although our data suggest that PAX6 is active in the cancer phenotype, the specific molecular pathways through which PAX6 acts are unknown. Here, we find transcripts for both the canonical and the alternately spliced 5a transcript of the PAX6 gene in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. The canonical PAX6 protein contains a central homeodomain and a N-terminal paired DNA binding domain composed of two subdomains, the PAI and RED moieties. Due to an alternate splice insertion of 14 amino acids into the PAI subdomain, the PAX6(5a) variant has DNA binding specificity different from that of the canonical PAX6 protein. Both proteins can bind to DNA through the homeodomain and the paired domain, but whereas PAX6 can bind to sites through both the PAI and RED subdomains, PAX6(5a) relies mostly on the RED domain to bind to paired consensus sites (25Duncan M.K. Kozmik Z. Cveklova K. Piatigorsky J. Cvekl A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3173-3185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Epstein J. Cai J. Glaser T. Jepeal L. Maas R. J. Biol.

The majority of what is known thus far about PAX6(5a) function is its role during development, most of which is focused in eye development. Both transcripts are essential for normal eye development, where loss or overexpression of either of the transcripts leads to specific eye defects (25Duncan M.K. Kozmik Z. Cveklova K. Piatigorsky J.

U.S.A. 2002; 99: 6812-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A role for the PAX6(5a) protein in the pancreas or pancreatic cancer has not been described. We find that PAX6 and PAX6(5a) directly activate the tyrosine kinase receptor MET through an enhancer element in the 5′-proximal MET promoter. Although both proteins activate a reporter construct containing the MET promoter and both transcripts are expressed in two representative pancreatic carcinoma cell lines, the PAX6(5a) protein is the dominant protein expressed in these cells. Inhibition of PAX6 expression induces a parallel reduction of MET expression in pancreatic carcinoma cells, and this is coupled with a decline in cell growth and survival. We present here in this report a cancer pathway, where aberrant overexpression of PAX6/PAX6(5a) leads to MET expression, a receptor directly involved in the cancer phenotype of metastasis, resistance to apoptosis, and tumor growth. PAX6 protein expression was detected in histologically and clinically confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma specimens using PAX6 monoclonal mouse antibody (1:500 dilution; University of Iowa Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA). Following primary antibody incubation, slides were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody, treated with streptavidin immunoperoxidase complex (Vectastain Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and stained with diaminobenzidine chromagen. For MET receptor detection, slides were incubated with MET receptor polyclonal rabbit primary antibody (1:100 dilution; catalog number sc-10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The secondary antibody was fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:200 dilution; catalog number 31635; Pierce). For scoring and analysis of PAX6 and MET expression, slides were purely graded as “positive” or “negative” for expression and scored blinded for sample type. Differences in sample sets were determined by Student's t test or χ2 analysis using statistical software (GraphPad Prism, version 5.0; GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. For Western analysis detection of PAX6, MET, and vinculin, cell lysates (40 μg/well) were loaded on acrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, probed with PAX6 (1:5000 dilution; antibody 5790; Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA) or MET (1:200 dilution; catalog number sc-10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) rabbit polyclonal antibodies, and Western blotted (Western Breeze Chemiluminescent kit; Invitrogen). The membranes were stripped using Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce), checked for complete removal of antibodies, and reanalyzed for vinculin (1:5,000 mouse monoclonal antibody clone hVIN-1; Sigma) or β-actin (1:400 mouse monoclonal antibody E7, University of Iowa Hybridoma Bank) expression as a loading control. RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNAs were treated with deoxyribonuclease to remove any contaminating DNA. cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). To confirm the absence of contaminating genomic DNA, samples were prepared without reverse transcriptase. Primers for PAX6 are located in the paired box, TTC AGA GCC CCA TAT TCG AG and TGC TAG TCT TTC TCG GGC AA, amplifying 787 bp (base pairs) for the canonical PAX6 transcript and 829 bp (42 inserted bp) for PAX6(5a). PCR products were sequenced to confirm correct amplification. Control primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase are TCA AGG TCG AGT CAA CGG ATT TGG T and CAT GTG GGC ATG AGG TCC ACC AC, amplifying 983 bp, as described (Clontech), and control primers for β2-microglobulin are GGG TTT CAT CCA TCC GAC AT and GAT GCT GCT TAC ATG TCT CGA, amplifying 224 bp, as described (32Schag K.

Cells were trypsinized, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol, and stored at −20 °C until analysis of DNA content by flow cytometry. After centrifugation, cells were suspended in 0.2 m phosphate citrate buffer (pH 7.8) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in staining solution (0.1% Triton X-100, 200 μg/ml RNase A, 20 μg/ml propidium iodide in phosphate-buffered saline) for 30 min. Cells were filtered through a mesh and analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Pancreatic carcinoma (PANC-1, MIAPACA-2, and SW979) and control (mouse fibroblast 3T3 and human kidney 293T) cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).

The total amount of DNA transfected was kept constant by the addition of pBluescript plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Cells were transfected according to the manufacturer's protocols (Effectene reagent; Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After 48 h post-transfection, luciferase and β-galactosidase assays (Promega) were performed. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity levels as an internal control.

Whole cell extracts were obtained from 3T3 cells transfected with PAX6 and PAX6(5a) constructs prepared in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 400 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol. EMSA was performed in the presence of 40% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences). Primers to create probes for EMSA are shown in Fig. 5D. Probes were annealed together and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and purified on Microspin G-50 columns (Amersham Biosciences). Competition assays were performed in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled probe to the labeled probe. Samples were electrophoresed on 5% native gels, dried, and exposed to Biomax MS film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Plated PANC-1 cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde and quenched in 0.125 m glycine and then processed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Temecula, CA). For immunoprecipitation of PAX6-DNA complexes, 1 μl of mouse monoclonal antibody (University of Iowa Hybridoma Bank) was added per experimental reaction. A nonspecific antibody, normal IgG (Sigma), was used as a negative control against nonspecific DNA precipitation by an antibody. Nested PCR was performed with primers to the MET enhancer, first with TCC GCC TCT AAC AAT GAA CTC C and AAG GTG AAA CTT TCT AGG TGG and then a second PCR reaction with primers TGC CCA AAT CTC TCT AAA CCC and AAG TTT TCT CGC CCT GGC TGC G. All ChIP samples were tested for false positive PCR amplification using primers that amplify sequence located within the fourth large coding exon of the β-tubulin gene to control against genomic DNA contamination. The nested primer set for this control was AAA GGC CAC TAC ACA GAG GG and TAC CAA CTG ATG GAC GGA GAG G for the first PCR and then TTG ATT CTG TCC TGG ATG TGG and TCA GAC ACT TTG GGT GAA GGC for the second PCR round. For the first PCR, 10% of the ChIP sample was utilized as template. For the nested second reaction, 5% of the first PCR was used as template. PANC-1 cells were transfected with siRNA specific for both PAX6 and PAX6(5a) transcripts or control siRNA (100 pmol; Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's protocols. The transfection efficiency for these experiments was greater than 80%, as calculated by the number of fluorescing cells successfully transfected with a green fluorescent protein-labeled control siRNA. Cell lysates were collected at 48 h post-siRNA transfection. We have previously found PAX6 expressed in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines and primary tissue (24Lang D. Mascarenhas J.B. Powell S.K. Halegoua J. Nelson M. Ruggeri B.A. Mol. Carcinog. 2008; 47: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Here, we compared the presence of PAX6 expression to MET expression in a sample set of pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissue (Fig. 1). We find that 32 of 46 of the samples express PAX6 (69.6%) and 15 of 46 express MET (32.6%) (Fig. 1E). Most of the MET-expressing tissues demonstrated cytoplasmic and/or membranous staining of the receptor (Fig. 1C), but eight of the samples had at least some degree of nuclear staining as well (Fig. 1D). 12 of 15 samples that express MET also expressed PAX6. MET expression coupled with an absence of PAX6 was an infrequent finding in comparison with the other group combinations (Fig. 1F), and this is a statistically significant finding (p < 0.05). The pancreatic carcinoma cell lines SW979, PANC-1, and MIAPACA-2 also expressed PAX6 (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–3), whereas the mouse fibroblast cell line 3T3 did not (Fig. 2A, lane 5). Both the cell lines SW979 and PANC-1 expressed abundant amounts of MET, whereas MIAPACA-2 and 3T3 cells did not express detectable levels. The predominant form of MET is the mature form (140-kDa β chain) as well as some expression of the 170-kDa precursor protein. The lack of MET expression in MIAPACA-2 cells has been previously observed (34Qian L.W. Mizumoto K. Inadome N. Nagai E. Sato N. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Tanaka M. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 104: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). 3T3 cells are utilized in these experiments as a negative control, since the cells do not express both MET and PAX6.FIGURE 2Expression of PAX6 and PAX6(5a) in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. A, Western analysis of cell lysates. Lysate samples include pancreatic cancer cell lines SW979 (lane 1), PANC-1 (lane 2), and MIAPACA-2 (lane 3), mouse retina (lane 4), PAX6-non-expressing mouse fibroblast cell line 3T3 (lane 5), and 3T3 cells transfected with 3×FLAG-PAX6 (lane 6). Samples are tested for expression of Vinculin (loading control), MET receptor, and PAX6. Expected sizes for PAX6 proteins are 46 kDa (canonical PAX6) and 48 kDa (PAX6(5a) and 3×FLAG-PAX6). Retinal tissues express both forms of PAX6 and are a size control for both isoforms (45Stanescu D. Iseli H.P. Schwerdtfeger K. Ittner L.M. Remé C.E. Hafezi F. Eye. 2007; 21: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). B, reverse transcription-PCR analysis for the expression of PAX6 and PAX6(5a) transcripts in MIAPACA-2 (lanes 1 and 2) and PANC-1 (lanes 3 and 4). The reverse transcription reactions occurs in the presence (lanes 1 and 3) or absence (lanes 2 and 4) of reverse transcriptase. The resulting cDNAs are amplified for primers recognizing glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH; positive control) or the paired domain of PAX6. The amplicon for canonical PAX6 is 787 bp, and the amplicon for PAX6(5a) is 829 bp. C, schematic of the PAX6 and PAX6(5a) proteins. Proteins are identical (with paired and homeodomain DNA binding domains) except that the PAX6(5a) protein contains a 14-amino acid insertion in the PAI N-terminal subdomain (N) of the paired domain. The paired domain also contains a C-terminal RED subdomain (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using primers in the paired box of the PAX6 transcript, reverse transcription-PCR analysis of MIAPACA-2 and PANC-1 cells revealed two major PCR products, the expected 787 bp band for the canonical PAX6 transcript and a slower migrating band at 829 bp (Fig. 2B). Both PCR products were sequenced, confirming the amplicons as the canonical PAX6 transcript and a major splice variant of PAX6, PAX6(5a). This variant protein is identical to the canonical version, with the exception of a 42-bp insertion in the paired box, adding 14 amino acids to the PAI subdomain of the Paired DNA binding domain (Fig. 2C). Since the pancreatic cancer cell lines predominantly show only one band in Western analysis, the cancer cell lysates were run in parallel with protein derived from mouse retina as a size control. Mouse and human retina have significant expression of both isoforms (30Chauhan B.K. Yang Y. Cveklová K. Cvekl A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although the retina protein shows two distinct bands on a Western analysis for PAX6 expression at 46 kDa for PAX6 and 48 kDa for PAX6(5a) (Fig. 2A, lane 4), the three pancreatic carcinoma cell lines predominantly show only the 48 kDa band. The PAX6 protein expressed in the cancer cells also matches the size for the 48-kDa 3×FLAG-PAX6 protein produced in transfected in 3T3 cells (Fig. 2A, lane 6). PAX6 is expressed in a significant number of pancreatic tumors. To test whether PAX6 plays a role in the growth and survival of pancreatic cancer cells, the expression of PAX6 was specifically inhibited through RNA interference in PANC-1 cells. Expression of PAX6 in this cell line can be inhibited 50–70% with gene-specific siRNA but not with random siRNA (siScramble) (Fig. 7). Reduction of PAX6 expression is due to specific targeting of the PAX6 transcript and does not affect non-related genes, such as β2-microglobulin (supplemental Fig. S1). Over a time course, parental and siScramble-transfected PANC-1 cells show healthy growth and a population doubling at around 60 h (Fig. 3A). However, PANC-1 cells transfected with siPAX6 demonstrate a loss of cells over the same time course. Morphologically, 26.1 ± 11.3% of the cells appear to undergo apoptosis, round up, and detach from the plate (Fig. 3, B–D). The untransfected and siScramble-transfected PANC-1 cells have significantly fewer cells with this phenotype, 3.4 ± 1.3 and 3.5 ± 1.4%, respectively. A hallmark feature of apoptosis is DNA fractionation, and this can be detected by examining DNA content by flow cytometry. The DNA content of cells in G0/G1 will be 2 n, whereas cells in G2 will be 4 n, and cells undergoing apoptosis will be less than 2 n. Although control cells have less than 1% of the cell population with a DNA content of less than 2 n, 8.61% of the siPAX6-transfected cells fall into this category (Fig. 3, E–G). Evidence of late stage apoptosis occurs at 9–12 h post-siPAX6 transfection. At 24 h post-transfection, there is evidence of large branching cells in 16.3 ± 6.5% of the remaining cells (Fig. 3J), but these cells are rare in the control cells (Fig. 3, H–K). It is possible that the percentage of these branching cells in the siPAX6-transfected populations would be higher but are diluted due to untransfected cells in the plate.FIGURE 3Inhibition of PAX6 expression leads to a reduction of cell numbers, apoptosis, and a change in cellular morphology. A, cell numbers over a 60-h time course. PANC-1 cells that are untransfected (squares) or transfected with a random siRNA (siScramble; triangles) or with PAX6 gene-specific siRNA (siPAX6; circles) are counted at 12-h intervals to 60 h (x axis). Cells are counted at the time of transfection, and this number is set at 100% of starting levels. Cell numbers are presented as percentage of 0 h levels (y axis). B and C, morphology of siPAX6-transfected cells 9 h post-transfection. A number of the cells display blebbing (black arrows), rounding up, and a loss of adhesion to the culture plate. There are also cells that maintain the parental phenotype (white arrows) (magnification, ×400). D, quantification of cells shown in B and C with an apoptotic morphology. In six random fields, total cells and cells with overt signs of apoptosis (blebbing, rounding up) are counted and graphed. The average percentage of the population with an apoptotic phenotype for untransfected, siScramble-transfected, and siPAX6-transfected PANC-1 cells is 3.4 ± 1.3%, 3.5 ± 1.4%, and 26.1 ± 11.3%, respectively. E–G, measurement of DNA content by flow cytometry. DNA from PANC-1 cells that are untreated or are 9 h post-transfected with siScramble or siPAX6 is stained with propidium iodide. DNA from cells in G0/G1 is measured as 2 n, and G2 DNA is measured as 4 n. DNA fragmented during apoptosis is seen as a population less than 2 n. This population is 0.5, 0.47, and 8.61% of the total cell counts for the untransfected, siScramble-transfected, and siPAX6-transfected PANC-1 cells, respectively. H, phenotype of the untransfected cells at the 24 h time point. I, phenotype of the siScramble-transfected cells at the 24 h time point. J, phenotype of the siPAX6-transfected cells at the 24 h time point. Although the majority of cells in the control groups have an epithelioid phenotype, the siPAX6-transfected cells have several branchlike outgrowths (H, I, and J; magnification, ×200). K, quantification of cells shown in H–J with a branching morphology. In six random fields, total cells and cells with overt signs of branching are counted and graphed. The average percentage of the population with a branching phenotype for untransfected, siScramble-transfected, and siPAX6-transfected PANC-1 cells is 0.4 ± 0.4, 0.9 ± 0.5, and 16.3 ± 6.5%, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The PAX6-related protein, PAX3, can activate MET expression during muscle development (23Epstein J.A.

https://openalex.org/W2079416549,"DAX-1 (dosage-sensitive sex reversal adrenal hypoplasia congenital critical region on X chromosome, gene 1) is an atypical member of the nuclear receptor family and acts as a corepressor of a number of nuclear receptors. HNF4alpha (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha) is a liver-enriched transcription factor that controls the expression of a variety of genes involved in cholesterol, fatty acid, and glucose metabolism. Here we show that DAX-1 inhibits transcriptional activity of HNF4alpha and modulates hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression. Hepatic DAX-1 expression is increased by insulin and SIK1 (salt-inducible kinase 1), whereas it is decreased in high fat diet-fed and diabetic mice. Coimmunoprecipitation assay from mouse liver samples depicts that endogenous DAX-1 interacts with HNF4alpha in vivo. In vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assay affirms that the recruitment of DAX-1 on the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene promoter is inversely correlated with the recruitment of PGC-1alpha and HNF4alpha under fasting and refeeding, showing that DAX-1 could compete with the coactivator PGC-1alpha for binding to HNF4alpha. Adenovirus-mediated expression of DAX-1 decreased both HNF4alpha- and forskolin-mediated gluconeogenic gene expressions. In addition, knockdown of DAX-1 partially reverses the insulin-mediated inhibition of gluconeogenic gene expression in primary hepatocytes. Finally, DAX-1 inhibits PEPCK and glucose-6-phosphatase gene expression and significantly lowers fasting blood glucose level in high fat diet-fed mice, suggesting that DAX-1 can modulate hepatic gluconeogenesis in vivo. Overall, this study demonstrates that DAX-1 acts as a corepressor of HNF4alpha to negatively regulate hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression in liver."
https://openalex.org/W2084929233,"Rap1b has been implicated in the transduction of the cAMP mitogenic response. Agonists that increase intracellular cAMP rapidly activate (i.e. GTP binding) and phosphorylate Rap1b on Ser(179) at its C terminus. cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of Rap1b is required for cAMP-dependent mitogenesis, tumorigenesis, and inhibition of AKT activity. However, the role of phosphorylation still remains unknown. In this study, we utilized amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectroscopy (DXMS) to assess potential conformational changes and/or mobility induced by phosphorylation. We report here DXMS data comparing exchange rates for PKA-phosphorylated (Rap1-P) and S179D phosphomimetic (Rap1-D) Rap1b proteins. Rap1-P and Rap1-D behaved exactly the same, revealing an increased exchange rate in discrete regions along the protein; these regions include a domain around the phosphorylation site and unexpectedly the two switch loops. Thus, local effects induced by Ser(179) phosphorylation communicate allosterically with distal domains involved in effector interaction. These results provide a mechanistic explanation for the differential effects of Rap1 phosphorylation by PKA on effector protein interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2080564787,"A number of proteins that play key roles in biological regulatory events undergo a process of post-translational modifications termed prenylation. The prenylation pathway consists of three enzymatic steps; the final processed protein is isoprenoid-modified and methylated on the C-terminal cysteine. This protein modification pathway plays a significant role in cancer biology because many oncogenic proteins undergo prenylation. Methylation of the C terminus by isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (Icmt) is the final step in the prenylation pathway. Cysmethynil, a specific Icmt inhibitor discovered in our laboratory, is able to inhibit Ras-mediated signaling, cell growth, and oncogenesis. We sought to examine the role of Icmt-mediated methylation on the behaviors of cancer cells associated with metastatic potential. Our results indicate that inhibition of methylation reduces migration of the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. In addition, cell adhesion and cell spreading are also significantly impacted by cysmethynil. To examine the mechanism of Icmt-dependent migration we focused on RhoA and Rac1, prenylated proteins that are important mediators of cell migration through their control of the actin cytoskeleton. Inhibition of Icmt significantly decreases the activation of both RhoA and Rac1; an increase in Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI) binding in the absence of methylation appears to contribute to this effect. Furthermore, in the absence of Icmt activity the addition of exogenous RhoA or Rac1 is able to partially rescue directed and random migration, respectively. These findings establish a role for Icmt-mediated methylation in cell migration and advance our understanding of the biological consequences of Rho methylation. A number of proteins that play key roles in biological regulatory events undergo a process of post-translational modifications termed prenylation.

Post-translational modifications of proteins play vital roles in many aspects of cell biology. Hence, identifying and understanding the biological impact of these processes is crucial to furthering our basic understanding of how cells function. Numerous proteins that control important biological regulatory events undergo a complex series of post-translational modifications that are directed by the presence of a so-called CaaX motif at their C terminus. This post-translational pathway, termed protein prenylation, is initiated by the attachment of an isoprenoid lipid to an invariant cysteine residue, the C of the CaaX motif (1Glomset J.A. Farnsworth C.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 181-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 2Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). Either a 15-carbon farnesyl or 20-carbon geranylgeranyl isoprenoid is covalently attached to this cysteine by protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) 2The abbreviations used are: FTaseprotein farnesyltransferaseGGTase-Iprotein geranylgeranyltransferase type IRce1the CaaX protein-specific proteaseIcmtisoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferaseRhoGDIRho GDP-dissociation inhibitorcysmethynil2-[5-(3-methylphenyl)-1-octyl-1H-indol-3-yl]acetamideERendoplasmic reticulumECMextracellular matrixFBSfetal bovine serumPBSphosphate-buffered salineHAhemagglutininGSTglutathione S-transferaseEGFepidermal growth factorDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. or protein geranylgeranyltransferase-I (GGTase-I), respectively (3Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). The prenylation step is followed by cleavage of the three C-terminal amino acids (the -AAX) by an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-bound protease termed Rce1. Finally, the prenylated cysteine, which is now located at the C terminus, is methylated by isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (Icmt), another integral ER membrane protein (4Ashby M.N. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 5Young S.G. Ambroziak P. Kim E. Clarke S. The Enzymes.in: Tamanoi F. Sigman D.S. Vol. 21. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2001: 156-213Google Scholar). The final result of these modifications is a protein that contains a prenylated and methylated cysteine at its C terminus. Numerous studies have demonstrated that this post-translational processing not only facilitates protein association with cellular membranes, but also can play important roles in protein-protein interactions and protein stability (1Glomset J.A. Farnsworth C.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 181-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 6Clarke S. Tamanoi F. J. Clin.

Thus, it is clear that CaaX processing is necessary for the biological activities of these proteins. protein farnesyltransferase protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I the CaaX protein-specific protease isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 2-[5-(3-methylphenyl)-1-octyl-1H-indol-3-yl]acetamide endoplasmic reticulum extracellular matrix fetal bovine serum phosphate-buffered saline hemagglutinin glutathione S-transferase epidermal growth factor 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The prenylation pathway has been targeted for potential anticancer therapy because most members of the Ras superfamily, which contains many known oncogenes, undergo CAAX processing. The Ras superfamily consists of five large subfamilies; the two most well-characterized are the Ras and Rho subfamilies (8Colicelli J. Sci. STKE. 2004; 2004: RE13PubMed Google Scholar). Both Ras and Rho proteins are processed by the CaaX pathway; Ras family members are farnesylated, while most Rho family members are geranylgeranylated. These monomeric GTPases cycle between a GDP-bound inactive state and a GTP-bound active state. In their active states, Ras and Rho subfamily members control numerous cell signaling pathways that are involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, polarity, and morphology (9Matozaki T. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Abnormally high activity of Ras and Rho signaling pathways contribute to initiation and progression of many types of cancer (10Walker K. Olson M.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 11Winter-Vann A.M. Casey P.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). For example, many breast cancers that are highly metastatic express abnormally high levels of Rho proteins (12Lin M. van Golen K.L. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2004; 84: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Rho proteins control migration and invasion of cells by tightly coordinating changes in the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. Acting through their effectors, Rho proteins rearrange the actin cytoskeleton to respond to chemo-attractant gradients, polarize cells, and control migration and invasion. While cell migration is necessary for development, leukocyte function, and other normal cell biologies, dysregulation of migration and invasion results in cancer metastasis (13Yamaguchi H. Condeelis J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 642-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Metastasis is an important and deadly progression of cancer and understanding the biology of migrating cancer cells is crucial for therapeutic targeting of this aspect of cancer. Pharmacologic targeting of the enzymes involved in the CaaX-processing pathway has emerged as a promising anticancer strategy. In particular, there has been much effort in designing inhibitors against the protein prenyltransferases, most notably FTase (14Doll R.J. Kirschmeier P. Bishop W.R. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Devel. 2004; 7: 478-486PubMed Google Scholar, 15Mazieres J. Pradines A. Favre G. Cancer Lett. 2004; 206: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). There is also recent evidence that inhibition of geranygeranylation of Rho proteins also impacts oncogenesis and metastasis (16Lebowitz P.F. Du W. Prendergast G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16093-16095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 17Collisson E.A. Kleer C. Wu M. De A. Gambhir S.S. Merajver S.D. Kolodney M.S. Mol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 31001-31008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, the overall success of the FTase inhibitors (FTIs) in the clinical setting has been somewhat disappointing. One possible reason is a phenomenon termed “alternate prenylation” in which some FTase substrates, most notably K- and N- Ras, are modified by GGTase and escape inhibition by FTIs (19James G.L. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6221-6226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 20Sebti S.M. Der C.J. Nat. Rev.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14459-14464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Because the Rce1 protease and Icmt methyltransferase act on all CaaX proteins, problems such as alternate prenylation would not arise if these enzymes were targeted. Hence, while protein prenyltransferase inhibitors still show some promise as anticancer agents, the emerging view that global attenuation of CaaX protein function may be advantageous in blocking cancer cell growth has increased interest in studying the two downstream enzymes involved in CaaX processing. While the biological consequences of prenylation are fairly well understood, the precise roles of C-terminal methylation in CaaX protein function are still elusive. Depending on the CaaX protein, methylation has been ascribed to roles in localization, protein-protein interactions and protein stability (11Winter-Vann A.M. Casey P.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The development of an Icmt knock-out mouse model has furthered our understanding of Icmt function (22Bergo M.O. Leung G.K.

Localization studies conducted in cells with genetically deleted Icmt have shown that methylation is important for proper membrane association of Ras proteins. However, the localization of Rho proteins in the absence of Icmt activity appears to be more complicated and may vary depending on family member and activation status (24Bergo M.O. Leung G.K.

Importantly, inhibition of CaaX protein methylation via either genetic or pharmacologic targeting has shown a clear impact on oncogenic transformation and tumor growth (23Bergo M.O. Gavino B.J.

Defining the role of Icmt-mediated methylation in complex cellular behaviors such as migration and invasion is crucial for furthering our understanding of the impact of CaaX protein methylation on the biology of normal and cancer cells. In the current study, we have assessed the impact of Icmt inhibition on cell biological processes associated with the function of Rho proteins, specifically cell adhesion, morphology, and migration. We found that inhibition of Icmt results in a disruption of the actin cytoskeleton and impairs ligand-mediated activation of RhoA and Rac1, a potential consequence of increased RhoGDI binding to both RhoA and Rac1 when their methylation is impaired. Further, we show that the impact of Icmt inhibition on cell migration is due at least in part to impairment of RhoA and Rac1function. These findings establish a role for Icmt-mediated methylation in cell migration and further elucidate the role that methylation plays in the function of Rho GTPases. Recombinant human thrombin was from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). The human breast cancer line MDA-MB-231 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown under the recommended conditions. Cysmethynil and biotin S-farnesylcysteine were synthesized by the Duke Small Molecule Synthesis Facility via established methods (28Winter-Vann A.M. Baron R.A. Wong W. dela Cruz J. York J.D. Gooden D.M. Bergo M.O. Young S.G. Toone E.J. Casey P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 4336-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Cysmethynil analog 1-octyl-mtolyl-1H-indole (J3) was synthesized and characterized previously (27Wang M. Tan W. Zhou J. Leow J. Go M. Lee H.S. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18678-18684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Cysmethynil and J3 stock solutions were prepared at 30 mm in DMSO and stored at −20 °C. siRNA oligos directed against Icmt and Luciferase were obtained from Ambion and Thermo Scientific Dharmacon, respectively. Recombinant human thrombin was from Enzyme Research Laboratories. Recombinant EGF was obtained from Calbiochem. The antibody recognizing RhoA was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies recognizing Rac1 and RhoGDI were from BD-Transduction Labs. Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin was from Fluka. MDA-MB 231 cells were plated at 100,000 cells per well in 6-well dishes 24 h prior to transfection. Stock solutions were prepared of Icmt siRNA oligonucleotides (Ambion) or Luciferase siRNA oligonucleotides (Thermo Scientific Dharmacon) at 20 μm. Following the manufacturer's instructions, the oligonucleotides were mixed with Opti-Mem I medium (Invitrogen) and then incubated with oligofectamine (Invitrogen) prior to transfection. Cells were harvested and assays conducted ∼130 h post-transfection. Icmt activity was determined by a modification of the in vitro assay described previously (29Baron R.A. Casey P.J. BMC Biochem. 2004; 5: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 30Baron R.A. Peterson Y.K. Otto J.C. Rudolph J. Casey P.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested in lysis buffer (100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm Mg Cl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol supplemented with protease inhibitors) and then lysed by sonication. NaCl was added to a final concentration of 150 mm, and then the lysate was precleared by centrifugation 5,000 × g for 5 min. Membranes were isolated by ultracentrifugation 100,000 × g for 30 min, resuspended in lysis buffer plus 150 mm NaCl, and protein concentrations were determined by colorimetric analysis (Bio-Rad Protein AssayTM). Icmt activity was assessed by using equal amounts of membrane protein using biotin S-farnesylcysteine and S-[3H]adenosylmethionine as substrates. The recombinant adenoviruses were constructed by subcloning human wild-type HA-RhoA, and HA-Rac1, into the Adtrack-CMV vector (gift of Dr. Bert Vogelstein, Johns Hopkins University Medical Center, Baltimore, MD) and then recombining these with pAdEasy-1 in the BJ5183 strain of Escherichia coli (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The resulting DNA was transfected into HEK 293 cells with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), and the viruses were purified using Adeno-XTM virus purification kits (BD Biosciences). The GST-rhotekin-RBD construct was obtained from Robert Lefkowitz (this institution) and the GST-PAK-Crib construct was obtained from Gary Bockoch (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). The GST-rhotekin-RBD and GST-PAK-Crib proteins were produced in the BL21DE3 strain of E. coli (Invitrogen). Briefly, starter cultures from a transformed bacterial colony were grown for 16 h and then used to inoculate 1 liter of LB and grown at 37 °C until the optical density reached 0.6–0.8. At this point, the cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma), and cultures were grown for an additional 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 6,000 × g at 4 °C, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of rhotekin buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and Complete MiniTM, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science)) or GST-FISH buffer (25 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitor tablets). The cells were then lysed, and lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer rhotekin buffer or GST-FISH buffer for 2 h at 4 °C with continuous rocking. Finally, the beads were washed three times in rhotekin buffer or GST-FISH buffer. After the final wash, the beads were resuspended in rhotekin buffer plus 10% glycerol or GST-FISH buffer and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining, using bovine serum albumin as a protein standard. MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in DMEM (Cellgro) supplemented with 5% FBS (Atlas), 10 μg/ml insulin (Invitrogen). For all assays, cells were plated 50,000–60,000 cells/ml for cysmethynil treatment and 25,000–30,000 cells/ml for DMSO (control) 18–24 h prior to treatment. Cells were then treated for 72 h with 25 μm cysmethynil (unless otherwise indicated) or control, then placed into starvation medium (DMSO with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm HEPES) with 5 μm cysmethynil 18–24 h. To perform assays, cells were washed with PBS and incubated in CellStripperTM (Cellgro), then resuspended in starvation medium. To remove excess Cellstripper, cells were collected by brief centrifugation (1000 × g for 5 min) then resuspended in starvation medium. Then cells were counted with a hemocytometer, and trypan blue (GIBCO) exclusion was utilized to determine viable cells. For migration assays, transwell chambers (8 μm pore size, polycarbonate filters, 6.5 mm diameter; Costar) were coated with fibronectin (5 μg/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C. Cysmethynil-treated or control (DMSO-treated) MDA-MB-231 cells were starved 18–20 h, then resuspended and counted as described above. Then 2 × 104 cells were plated on top of the transwell and allowed to migrate toward starvation medium or medium containing 5% FBS. After 3 h, cells were stained using the Hema3 staining kit (Fisher Scientific), and cells on the upper chamber that failed to migrated were removed with cotton swabs. The remaining cells on the bottom chamber were counted under a Nikon TS100 microscope. Four fields using a 20× objective were counted for each transwell, and duplicate transwells were averaged for each data point. To determine individual cell migration utilizing phagocytosis of fluorescent beads the following protocol was adapted from Ref. 31Windler-Hart S.L. Chen K.Y. Chenn A. BMC Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar. Glass coverslips (12-mm round Fisherbrand) were coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Then coverslips were coated with 0.025% fluorescent beads (Invitrogen) for 1–2 h at 37 °C. Cells were treated were cysmethynil or the vehicle DMSO, harvested, counted as described above, and then 500 cells/ml (control) or 750 cells/ml (cysmethynil) plated at 1 ml/coverslip in a 24-well dish. Following 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were stimulated with FBS (5% final concentration), allowed to migrate for 15–18 h, and then fixed by addition of 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Fluka) was utilized to visualize actin. The coverslips were washed and affixed to slides with mounting medium containing DAPI (Molecular Probes) to visualize nuclei. Images were obtained with a Zeiss Axio Imager fluorescence microscope and analyzed using Metamorph software. To quantitate cell migration, the Metamorph software was used to define cleared regions, and the average area cleared per cell was calculated and plotted as a percentage of untreated cells. To quantitate leading edge morphology and elongated cell morphology, the total number of cells per coverslip was counted, and leading edge morphology assigned to cells displaying movement due to phagocytosis of beads and showing clear polarity as typified by clear tapering of the trailing edge and broadening of the leading edge. Elongated morphology was assigned to cells displaying equal tapering at both ends. To perform adhesion assays MDA-MB 231 cells were treated for 4 days with cysmethynil or vehicle (DMSO). Cells were harvested as described above then 25,000 cells/well were then dispensed into 96-well plates coated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml) and allowed to adhere for 1 h. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing with medium. The cells were then fixed and stained with crystal violet. After washing and drying, the amount of adhered cells was quantitated by eluting the crystal violet with methanol and reading the absorbance at 550 nm. Cell spreading assays were conducted by treating MDA-MB-231 cells with cysmethynil or DMSO as described above. Following starvation, cells were harvested, dispensed onto coverslips coated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml), and allowed to adhere. After an additional 1.5 h, coverslips were washed with PBS to remove non-adherent cells, then the remaining cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde. Actin was visualized with rhodamine phalloidin. Following cysmethynil treatment and serum starvation as indicated in the appropriate figure legend, MDA-MB-231cells were stimulated with agonist (1 unit/ml thrombin (Enzyme Research Laboratories) for 15 min for RhoA activation or 100 ng/ml EGF (Calbiochem) for 15 min for Rac1 activation). Following stimulation, cells were washed with PBS, harvested in MLB buffer (25 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2% glycerol) or GST-FISH buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2) respectively, then incubated for 5 min to ensure complete lysis. The lysates were then cleared by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 5 min). Rho activation assays were performed as previously described (32Meigs T.E. Juneja J. DeMarco C.T. Stemmle L.N. Kaplan D.D. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18049-18055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Rho-GTP in cell lysates was precipitated using the GST fusion of the activated Rho-binding domain Rhotekin and detected by separation on SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal Rho-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Rac1 activation assays were similarly performed; however GST-FISH buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2) was utilized, and Rac1-GTP was precipitated from cell lysate using a GST fusion of the activated Rac1-binding domain Pak-Crib. Rac1 was detected by immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal antibody specific to Rac1 (BD-Transduction Labs). MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 4 days with 25 μm cysmethynil or vehicle (DMSO). Adenovirus expressing HA-tagged RhoA, Rac1, or GFP (vector) was incubated with the cells the final 24 h of treatment. Following cysmethynil treatment, cells were washed with PBS, harvested in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2% glycerol), then incubated for 5 min. The lysates were then cleared by centrifugation (15000 × g for 5 min), and protein concentrations determined by colorimetric analysis (Bio-Rad Protein AssayTM). Co-immunoprecipitation of the HA-tagged GTPase and RhoGDI were performed utilizing anti-HA agarose to bind the expressed HA-RhoA or Rac1. Levels of bound RhoGDI were determined by separation with SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis using a monoclonal antibody specific to RhoGDI (BD-Transduction Labs). Immunoblot analysis and quantitation was performed using the Odyssey System (LICOR, Lincoln, Nebraska) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To assess the role of Icmt-mediated CaaX protein methylation in cell migration, we chose the well-studied MDA-MB 231 cancer cell line. Typical of many breast cancers, MDA-MB 231 cells exhibit high levels of RhoA expression and are very motile, making them ideal for studying the impact of RhoGTPase methylation on migration. To determine whether Icmt-mediated methylation is necessary for cell migration, we initially conducted transwell migration assays. Following starvation, cells were harvested, and equal numbers placed in the upper wells of transwell chambers. Cysmethynil-mediated inhibition of Icmt impairs cell growth and at higher doses results in cell death (data not shown). Because of the long half-life of Rho proteins (23Bergo M.O. Gavino B.J. Hong C. Beigneux A.P. McMahon M. Casey P.J. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we chose to treat the cells for at least 72 h to maximize the pool of unmethylated Rho proteins. To ensure that only live cells were assayed we chose time points and concentrations of cysmethynil that resulted in minimal cell death and trypan blue dye exclusion was a criteria for counting. To assess random migration, starvation medium was placed on both sides of the transwell, while for directed migration, medium containing FBS was placed in the lower chamber creating a chemoattractant gradient. Stimulation with FBS resulted in an approximate 6-fold increase of migration as compared with random migration (not shown). Cysmethynil treatment of the MDA-MB-231 cells significantly impacted both random and directed migration in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B). Random migration (Fig. 1A) was slightly more sensitive than directed migration (Fig. 1B), with an ∼70% decrease in random migration observed in the presence of 15 and 20 μm cysmethynil as compared with the control; treatment with 25 μm cysmethynil resulted in an 80% decrease in random migration. Directed migration was also clearly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B), with a 60, 80, or 90% decrease in cell migration with 15, 20, and 25 μm cysmethynil treatment, respectively, compared with control cells. To ensure that the effects of cysmethynil were mechanism-based, a structurally similar, inactive analog, J3 (27Wang M. Tan W. Zhou J. Leow J. Go M. Lee H.S. Casey P.J. J. Biol.

Herein we describe paralogous Sec14 domain-bearing proteins, clavesin 1/CRALBPL and clavesin 2, identified through a proteomic analysis of CCVs. Clavesins are enriched on CCVs and form a complex with clathrin heavy chain (CHC) and adaptor protein-1, major coat components of TGN-derived CCVs. The proteins co-localize with markers of endosomes and the TGN as well as with CHC and adaptor protein-1. A membrane mimic assay using the Sec14 domain of clavesin 1 reveals phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate as a specific lipid partner. Phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate is localized to late endosomes/lysosomes, and interestingly, isoform-specific knockdown of clavesins in neurons using lentiviral delivery of interfering RNA leads to enlargement of a lysosome-associated membrane protein 1-positive membrane compartment with no obvious influence on the CCV machinery at the TGN. Since clavesins are expressed exclusively in neurons, this new protein family appears to provide a unique neuron-specific regulation of late endosome/lysosome morphology.

AP-1 and clathrin form the membrane coat that shapes the vesicle and recruits an array of regulatory/accessory proteins, which control numerous aspects of CCV formation and function (3Ritter B. McPherson P.S. Top. Curr. Genet. 2004; 10: 9-37Google Scholar).

The specificity and function of intracellular compartments depends in part on the presence of distinct PtdIns species. For example, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate is found predominantly at the TGN and contributes to AP-1 recruitment, whereas phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate recruits effectors, such as EEA1 (early endosome antigen 1), to early endosomes to mediate membrane fusion (4Gillooly D.J.

Early endosomes subsequently transition into late endosomes/lysosomes, and during this process, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate is converted to PtdIns(3,5)P2 via the action of a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate 5-kinase named Fab1p in yeast and PIKfyve in mammals (10Dove S.K. Dong K. Kobayashi T. Williams F.K. Michell R.H. Biochem. J. 2009; 419: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). PIKfyve is part of a protein complex nucleated by Vac14 (11Jin N. Chow C.Y.

McPherson P.S. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6948-6954Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and regulates a ubiquitous trafficking process (10Dove S.K. Dong K. Kobayashi T. Williams F.K. Michell R.H.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 17518-17523Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This neuron-specific effect has remained mysterious due to the lack of exclusively neuronal factors targeting PtdIns(3,5)P2. The Sec14 domain is an evolutionarily ancient protein module that in humans is found in more than 45 proteins encoded by at least 25 genes (17Curwin A.J. Fairn G.D. McMaster C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7364-7375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Mutations in several Sec14 proteins lead to human diseases, including neurodegeneration (18Phillips S.E.

Biol. 2006; 41: 21-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), yet most of the Sec14 proteins in mammals remain uncharacterized. The yeast protein Sec14p is the prototype for this module (19Bankaitis V.A. Aitken J.R. Cleves A.E. Dowhan W. Nature. 1990; 347: 561-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Sec14p is essential for the transport of proteins from the Golgi (19Bankaitis V.A. Aitken J.R. Cleves A.E. Dowhan W. Nature. 1990; 347: 561-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), but more recently it was also found to be involved in the trafficking of protein cargo, specifically the mating factor receptor Ste3, from the plasma membrane via endosomes to the yeast vacuole (17Curwin A.J. Fairn G.D. McMaster C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7364-7375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The yeast vacuole is the equivalent of the lysosome in mammalian cells. Yeast Sec14p is a phospholipid transfer protein that extracts phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine from membranes in vitro and regulates the metabolism of these lipids in cells (19Bankaitis V.A. Aitken J.R. Cleves A.E. Dowhan W. Nature. 1990; 347: 561-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 20Patton-Vogt J.L. Griac P. Sreenivas A. Bruno V. Dowd S. Swede M.J. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20873-20883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Sec14p is composed of the Sec14 domain only, whereas the majority of Sec14 proteins in mammals contain a Sec14 domain in conjunction with other modules or protein/lipid binding domains (21Saito K. Tautz L. Mustelin T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 22Mousley C.J. Tyeryar K.R. Vincent-Pope P. Bankaitis V.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 727-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the few well characterized examples, these proteins function to integrate lipid binding/metabolism with other biological functions (21Saito K. Tautz L. Mustelin T. Biochim. Biophys.

In a subcellular proteomic analysis of CCVs from the brain, we identified eight novel open reading frames, including one encoding an Sec14 domain (23Wasiak S. Legendre-Guillemin V. Puertollano R. Blondeau F. Girard M. de Heuvel E. Boismenu D. Bell A.W. Bonifacino J.S. McPherson P.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 24Blondeau F. Ritter B.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 3833-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). A subsequent bioinformatics analysis revealed a second, paralogous Sec14 protein. We now demonstrate that the proteins, which we have named clavesin (clathrin vesicle-associated Sec14 protein) 1 and 2, are neuron-specific proteins that function in the regulation of lysosome morphology. A rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes clavesin 1 and 2 was raised against a peptide from the C terminus of clavesin 1 (EKGENENTQPLLALD). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against various proteins were from the indicated commercial sources; CHC X22 (American Type Culture Collection), γ-adaptin (AP-1), α-adaptin (AP-2), CHC and GM130 (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), LAMP1 LY1C6 and EEA1 281.7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), TGN38 2F7.1 (Abcam), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (Chemicon). Chicken MAP2 and sheep TGN46 polyclonal antibodies were from EnCor Biotechnology and Serotec, respectively. Rabbit anti-NECAP1 and endophilin 1 polyclonal antibodies were described previously (25Ritter B. Denisov A.Y. Philie J. Deprez C. Tung E.C. Gehring K. McPherson P.S.

Polyclonal antibodies against mannose 6-phosphate receptor 46 and 300 were a gift from Dr. Kurt von Figura. Alexa 594-, 633-, and 647-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes, Inc. Cy3-, Cy2-, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. cDNA clones for human clavesin 1 (gi27503734) and clavesin 2 (gi115527290) were used as PCR templates to amplify DNA encoding full-length proteins. N-terminal GST, FLAG, and GFP tags were added by cloning the PCR products into pGEX-6P1 (Amersham Biosciences), pCMV-Tag2B (Stratagene), and pEGFP-C1 (BD Biosciences Clontech), respectively. Clavesin 1 and 2 truncation mutants were generated by PCR from full-length cDNA. Mutations of clavesin 1 resulting in a defective lipid binding were introduced into its cDNA using a QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Tandem FYVE domain (2×FYVE), derived from mouse hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs) (27Wen P.J. Osborne S.L. Morrow I.C. Parton R.G. Domin J. Meunier F.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 5593-5603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift of Dr. Fred Meunier. The enhanced green fluorescent protein from the pEGFP plasmid was replaced with mCherry. The enthoprotin C-terminal construct was previously described (23Wasiak S. Legendre-Guillemin V. Puertollano R. Blondeau F. Girard M. de Heuvel E. Boismenu D. Bell A.W. Bonifacino J.S. McPherson P.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Adult rat tissues and various cell lines were homogenized in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.83 mm benzamidine, 0.23 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin) and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min. The protein content of the postnuclear supernatants was determined, and equal protein aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. In other cases, the postnuclear supernatant was further centrifuged at 12,000 × g to create a P2, and the supernatant of this spin was centrifuged at 200,000 × g to create a microsomal pellet (P3) and a cytosolic fraction (S3). CCVs were isolated from rat brain, as described previously (23Wasiak S. Legendre-Guillemin V. Puertollano R. Blondeau F. Girard M. de Heuvel E. Boismenu D. Bell A.W. Bonifacino J.S. McPherson P.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Postnuclear supernatants were prepared from brain or transfected HEK293 cells as described above. Triton X-100 was added to 1% final, and the extracts were spun at 265,000 × g for 30 min. The soluble supernatants were incubated with GST fusion proteins purified from Escherichia coli BL21 cells and prebound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C and washed three times with buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100. Proteins specifically bound to the beads were subjected to Western blot. Embryonic day 18–19 rat hippocampal neurons were prepared as described (28Burman J.L. Wasiak S. Ritter B. de Heuvel E. McPherson P.S. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2177-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cells were fed every 7 days with Neurobasal medium supplemented with B-27, N-2, l-glutamine (500 μm), and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml) (Invitrogen) and were processed for immunofluorescence analysis or Western blot. For most immunofluorescence experiments, hippocampal neurons plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips were washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 20 mm NaH2PO4, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Cells were then washed in PBS, permeabilized in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100, and incubated in blocking buffer (PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% Triton X-100). Following this block, coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature. Following this incubation, cells were washed in PBS with 0.02% Triton X-100, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with fluorescent secondary antibodies, and washed, and the coverslips were mounted on glass slides with DAKO (cytomation fluorescence mounting medium; Dakocytomation) and imaged on a Zeiss 510 confocal microscope. For quantification of lysosomes, raw images were converted to binary, particles larger than 0.1 μm2 were extracted, and the area of the extracted particles was measured using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Data were analyzed statistically using JMP software (SAS Institute, Inc.). For quantification of intensity of CHC and AP-1 at the TGN, total fluorescence in the regions of interest was measured using ImageJ software. MicroRNA (miRNA) sequences were designed to deplete rat clavesin 1 (gi109476027) and clavesin 2 (gi109460582) using Invitrogen's RNAi Designer. The sequences target clavesin 1 and clavesin 2 mRNA starting at nucleotides 489 (clavesin 1 sequence 1), 956 (clavesin 1 sequence 2), 1087 (clavesin 2 sequence 1), and 1186 (clavesin 2 sequence 2) and are TGATGATCATGTCTCTGACCT, AAAGCGAGCAGGAAAGCTGTC, TTCAGTGCCTGCTTGATGCCA, and ACCAGTGTATACCTGCTCTGA, respectively. A nontargeting miRNA was used for controls, and its sequence is AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT. Oligonucleotides encoding the miRNA sequences were cloned into pcDNA 6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR plasmid (Invitrogen), and lentivirus was produced as described (29Thomas S. Ritter B. Verbich D. Sanson C. Bourbonnière L. McKinney R.A. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12410-12419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Virus vectors were generally transduced at 7 days in vitro (DIV), and neurons were processed for immunofluorescence or Western blot at 14–21 DIV. Lipid binding was performed in 10 mm HEPES with 100 mm NaCl essentially as described (30Höning S. Ricotta D. Krauss M. Späte K. Spolaore B. Motley A. Robinson M. Robinson C. Haucke V. Owen D.J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 519-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Clavesin 1 was originally identified as a novel open reading frame in a proteomic analysis of rat brain CCVs (23Wasiak S. Legendre-Guillemin V. Puertollano R. Blondeau F. Girard M. de Heuvel E. Boismenu D. Bell A.W. Bonifacino J.S. McPherson P.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and a data base search revealed a clavesin 1 paralogue, clavesin 2. The proteins consist of an Sec14 domain flanked by a short stretch of residues on the N-terminal side and an ∼75 residue C-terminal region ending in a putative clathrin box, a motif involved in clathrin binding (Fig. 1A). The proteins also contain a CRAL_TRIO_N domain (Fig. 1A). Although this module is often annotated as a separate entity, it is a component of the globular Sec14 domain (21Saito K. Tautz L. Mustelin T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Clavesin 1 was independently isolated from a cDNA library based on the fact that it contains a CRAL_TRIO_N domain (31Kong Y.H. Ye G.M. Qu K. Pan W.Q. Liu X.H. Wan B. Guo J.H. Yu L. Biotechnol. Lett. 2006; 28: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Due to homology of the protein with a cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP) it was called CRALBPL (CRALBP-like) (31Kong Y.H. Ye G.M. Qu K. Pan W.Q. Liu X.H. Wan B. Guo J.H. Yu L. Biotechnol. Lett. 2006; 28: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription-PCR analysis indicated that the mRNA for CRALBPL/clavesin 1 was expressed in the brain, but neither expression nor localization of the endogenous protein was examined (31Kong Y.H. Ye G.M. Qu K. Pan W.Q. Liu X.H. Wan B. Guo J.H. Yu L. Biotechnol. Lett. 2006; 28: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We thus sought to generate antibodies against the clavesins. Our first attempts to generate isoform-specific antibodies were unsuccessful. However, we were successful in generating a polyclonal antibody against a peptide from the C terminus of clavesin 1 that recognizes recombinant clavesin 1 and 2 (supplemental Fig. S1). Western blots of brain extracts reveal a doublet with a strong band at 40 kDa and a weaker band that migrates slightly slower (Fig. 1B). Isoform-specific knockdown in cultured hippocampal neurons indicates that the lower and upper bands are clavesin 1 and 2, respectively (see Fig. 9A). Clavesins are detected in the brain but are undetectable, even with extended exposure in non-neuronal tissues or in various cell lines (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S2; data not shown). Both clavesin isoforms are enriched on CCVs, although their fractionation pattern does not precisely parallel the clathrin heavy chain (CHC) (Fig. 1C), indicating that clavesins are not exclusively CCV proteins. Thus, clavesins are brain-specific proteins associated with CCVs.FIGURE 9Knockdown of clavesins in neurons alters lysosome morphology. A, hippocampal neurons at 4 DIV were transduced with lentivirus encoding a non-targeting miRNA or with lentivirus encoding two different miRNAs targeting clavesin 1 (1-1, 1-2), two different miRNAs targeting clavesin 2 (2-1, 2-2), or different combinations of the clavesin 1 and 2 miRNAs, as indicated. At 12 DIV, lysates were prepared from the cultures, and equal protein aliquots were processed for Western blots with antibodies against CHC, AP-1, or clavesin 1/2. B, hippocampal neurons at 4 DIV were transduced with lentivirus encoding clavesin 1-1 and 2-1 miRNAs. At 21 DIV, cells were processed for indirect immunofluorescence with polyclonal antibody against clavesin (red) and monoclonal antibody against AP-1. The AP-1 signal was processed in the CY5 channel (633) and was pseudocolored green for the purpose of merging with the red clavesin signal. The lentivirus also drives expression of GFP (leftmost panels). Bar, 10 μm. C, hippocampal neurons at 7 DIV were transduced with lentivirus encoding non-targeting miRNA, clavesin 1-1 miRNA, clavesin 2-1 miRNA, or both clavesin miRNAs. At 14 DIV, cells were processed for indirect immunofluorescence with antibodies against LAMP1 (red) and MAP2 (blue). The lentivirus also drives expression of GFP. Bar, 10 μm. D, the total LAMP1-positive area was quantified. Each bar represents the mean ± S.E. with n = 40. ***, a significance of p < 0.001 using Welch's t test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In hippocampal cultures at 21 DIV, clavesins are detected by immunofluorescence in MAP2-positive neurons but not glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes (supplemental Fig. S3). Neuronal staining is punctate and prominent in cell bodies with enrichment in a perinuclear compartment (supplemental Fig. S3). Subcellular fractionation of brain lysates by differential centrifugation reveals that clavesins are most prominent in the pellet fractions (Fig. 2A). Clavesin 1 is enriched in the P3 microsomal fraction, whereas clavesin 2 is more evenly distributed between membrane fractions (Fig. 2A). There is less of the clavesins in the S3 cytosolic fraction, which is enriched in endophilin A1. Thus, the clavesin puncta detected by immunofluorescence probably represent membrane-associated proteins. Clavesin puncta in the perinuclear region partially overlap with TGN38 (Fig. 2B), which is highly enriched at the TGN at steady-state, whereas little co-localization is seen with the cis-Golgi protein GM130 (Fig. 2C). Clavesins also partially co-localize with AP-1 and CHC (Fig. 3, A and B). Strongly diminished immunofluorescence following treatment with inhibitory RNAs targeting the clavesins indicates the specificity of the antibody (see Fig. 9B). However, there is some weak immunofluorescence seen in nuclei (Fig. 2, B and C, for example), and this is not lost with inhibitory RNA treatment, suggesting that it represents a cross-reactivity of the antibody. Together, our data demonstrate that clavesins are neuron-specific, membrane-associated proteins that co-localize with clathrin coat components on the TGN.FIGURE 3Clavesins co-localize with clathrin coat components. Hippocampal neurons at 21 DIV were processed by indirect immunofluorescence with polyclonal antibody against clavesin (red) and monoclonal antibodies against AP-1 (A) and CHC (B), each in green. In each case, the lower panels are from the area indicated by the white box in the merge images. The arrows point to co-localizing structures. Bars, 10 and 2 μm for the low and high power images, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition to the TGN localization, we noticed that clavesins also displayed a more peripherally distributed punctate staining in neuronal cell bodies (Figs. 2, B and C, and 3). Since clavesins are associated with TGN-derived CCVs that deliver cargo to endosomes, it was reasonable to hypothesize that clavesins would also localize in part to endosomes. To test this possibility, we transfected HeLa cells with GFP-clavesin 1 and examined its localization in relationship to the early endosome marker EEA1 (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, in addition to a juxtanuclear pool corresponding to the TGN, there was a more peripheral punctate pool that showed prominent co-localization with EEA1, indicating the presence of an endosomal pool of clavesin 1 (Fig. 4A; see also Fig. 7). Similar results were seen with GFP-clavesin 2 (data not shown). Unfortunately, the EEA1 antibody did not work for immunofluorescence in neurons. Thus, we co-transfected hippocampal cultures with GFP-clavesin 1 and a construct encoding tandem copies of the PtdIns 3-phosphate-binding FYVE domain of Hrs fused to mCherry, a marker of early endosomes (27Wen P.J. Osborne S.L. Morrow I.C. Parton R.G. Domin J. Meunier F.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 5593-5603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To allow for increased transfection efficiency, cells were transfected at 6 DIV and imaged at 7 DIV. GFP-clavesin 1 displayed juxtanuclear staining corresponding to the TGN (Fig. 4B; also see Fig. 6). At 7 DIV, the TGN has a more restricted juxtanuclear pattern (Figs. 4 and 6) than at 21 DIV (Figs. 2 and 3). In addition to the TGN staining, a pool of GFP-clavesin 1 co-localizes with mCherry-FYVE, indicating endosomal localization (Fig. 4B). Thus, clavesins are localized to endosomes in addition to the TGN.FIGURE 7Clavesins bind to PtdIns(3,5)P2. A, liposomes composed of 80% phosphatidylcholine, 20% phosphatidylethanolamine (PC/PE) and liposomes in which 10% phosphatidylcholine was substituted for the indicated PtdIns were probed for binding of recombinant clavesin 1 using a surface plasmon resonance biosensor. Binding to PtdIns(3,5)P2 was most significant. B, a triple point mutation in the Sec14 domain (RFK/AAA mutant) abolished binding, indicating that clavesin 1 binding is specific, although it exhibits a relatively low affinity. C and D, a series of injections with varying concentrations of clavesin-1 were used to calculate a rate constant of 11.3 μm for clavesin 1 binding to PtdIns(3,5)P2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 6The Sec14 domain targets clavesin to the membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2033722757,"Background Multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria have become a major concern in hospitals worldwide and urgently require the development of new antibacterial molecules. Peptide deformylase is an intracellular target now well-recognized for the design of new antibiotics. The bacterial susceptibility to such a cytoplasmic target primarily depends on the capacity of the compound to reach and accumulate in the cytosol. Methodology/Principal Findings To determine the respective involvement of penetration (influx) and pumping out (efflux) mechanisms to peptide deformylase inhibitors (PDF-I) activity, the potency of various series was determined using various genetic contexts (efflux overproducers or efflux-deleted strains) and membrane permeabilizers. Depending on the structure of the tested molecules, two behaviors could be observed: (i) for actinonin the first PDF-I characterized, the AcrAB efflux system was the main parameter involved in the bacterial susceptibility, and (ii), for the lastest PDF-Is such as the derivatives of 2-(5-bromo-1H-indol-3-yl)-N-hydroxyacetamide, the penetration through the membrane was a important limiting step. Conclusions/Significance Our results clearly show that the bacterial membrane plays a key role in modulating the antibacterial activity of PDF-Is. The bacterial susceptibility for these new antibacterial molecules can be improved by two unrelated ways in MDR strains: by collapsing the Acr efflux activity or by increasing the uptake rate through the bacterial membrane. The efficiency of the second method is associated with the nature of the compound."
https://openalex.org/W2110455833,"Bluetongue virus (BTV) is the ‘type’ species of the genus Orbivirus within the family Reoviridae. The BTV genome is composed of ten linear segments of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), each of which codes for one of ten distinct viral proteins. Previous phylogenetic comparisons have evaluated variations in genome segment 3 (Seg-3) nucleotide sequence as way to identify the geographical origin (different topotypes) of BTV isolates. The full-length nucleotide sequence of genome Seg-3 was determined for thirty BTV isolates recovered in the eastern Mediterranean region, the Balkans and other geographic areas (Spain, India, Malaysia and Africa). These data were compared, based on molecular variability, positive-selection-analysis and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic reconstructions (using appropriate substitution models) to 24 previously published sequences, revealing their evolutionary relationships. These analyses indicate that negative selection is a major force in the evolution of BTV, restricting nucleotide variability, reducing the evolutionary rate of Seg-3 and potentially of other regions of the BTV genome. Phylogenetic analysis of the BTV-4 strains isolated over a relatively long time interval (1979–2000), in a single geographic area (Greece), showed a low level of nucleotide diversity, indicating that the virus can circulate almost unchanged for many years. These analyses also show that the recent incursions into south-eastern Europe were caused by BTV strains belonging to two different major-lineages: representing an ‘eastern’ (BTV-9, -16 and -1) and a ‘western’ (BTV-4) group/topotype. Epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses indicate that these viruses originated from a geographic area to the east and southeast of Greece (including Cyprus and the Middle East), which appears to represent an important ecological niche for the virus that is likely to represent a continuing source of future BTV incursions into Europe."

Besides these roles, additional functions in the control of immune response have been suggested. In the present study we investigated the consequences of loss of Rb in viral infection. Here we show that virus replication is increased by the absence of Rb, and that Rb is required for the activation of the NF-kB pathway in response to virus infection. These results reveal a novel role for tumor suppressor Rb in viral infection surveillance and further extend the concept of a link between tumor suppressors and antiviral activity."
https://openalex.org/W2110307649,"Background Skilled adult readers, in contrast to beginners, show no or little increase in reading latencies as a function of the number of letters in words up to seven letters. The information extraction strategy underlying such efficiency in word identification is still largely unknown, and methods that allow tracking of the letter information extraction through time between eye saccades are needed to fully address this question. Methodology/Principal Findings The present study examined the use of letter information during reading, by means of the Bubbles technique. Ten participants each read 5,000 five-letter French words sampled in space-time within a 200 ms window. On the temporal dimension, our results show that two moments are especially important during the information extraction process. On the spatial dimension, we found a bias for the upper half of words. We also show for the first time that letter positions four, one, and three are particularly important for the identification of five-letter words. Conclusions/Significance Our findings are consistent with either a partially parallel reading strategy or an optimal serial reading strategy. We show using computer simulations that this serial reading strategy predicts an absence of a word-length effect for words from four- to seven letters in length. We believe that the Bubbles technique will play an important role in further examining the nature of reading between eye saccades."
https://openalex.org/W1994073534,"Children with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), a genetic disorder characterized by diminished drive to breathe during sleep and impaired CO2 sensitivity, show brain structural and functional changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, with impaired responses in specific hippocampal regions, suggesting localized injury. We assessed total volume and regional variation in hippocampal surface morphology to identify areas affected in the syndrome. We studied 18 CCHS (mean age±std: 15.1±2.2 years; 8 female) and 32 healthy control (age 15.2±2.4 years; 14 female) children, and traced hippocampi on 1 mm3 resolution T1-weighted scans, collected with a 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner. Regional hippocampal volume variations, adjusted for cranial volume, were compared between groups based on t-tests of surface distances to the structure midline, with correction for multiple comparisons. Significant tissue losses emerged in CCHS patients on the left side, with a trend for loss on the right; however, most areas affected on the left also showed equivalent right-sided volume reductions. Reduced regional volumes appeared in the left rostral hippocampus, bilateral areas in mid and mid-to-caudal regions, and a dorsal-caudal region, adjacent to the fimbria. The volume losses may result from hypoxic exposure following hypoventilation during sleep-disordered breathing, or from developmental or vascular consequences of genetic mutations in the syndrome. The sites of change overlap regions of abnormal functional responses to respiratory and autonomic challenges. Affected hippocampal areas have roles associated with memory, mood, and indirectly, autonomic regulation; impairments in these behavioral and physiological functions appear in CCHS."

Recently, homodimerization of mammalian AMPK and yeast ortholog SNF1 was shown by us and others. In SNF1, it involved specific hydrophobic residues in the kinase domain αG-helix. Mutation of the corresponding AMPK α-subunit residues (Val-219 and Phe-223) to glutamate reduced the tendency of the kinase to form higher order homo-oligomers, as was determined by the following three independent techniques in vitro: (i) small angle x-ray scattering, (ii) surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, and (iii) two-dimensional blue native/SDS-PAGE. Recombinant protein as well as AMPK in cell lysates of primary cells revealed distinct complexes of various sizes. In particular, the assembly of very high molecular mass complexes was dependent on both the αG-helix-mediated hydrophobic interactions and kinase activation. In vitro and when overexpressed in double knock-out (α1−/−, α2−/−) mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, activation of mutant AMPK was impaired, indicating a critical role of the αG-helix residues for AMPK activation via its upstream kinases. Also inactivation by protein phosphatase 2Cα was affected in mutant AMPK. Importantly, activation of mutant AMPK by LKB1 was restored by exchanging the corresponding and conserved hydrophobic αG-helix residues of LKB1 (Ile-260 and Phe-264) to positively charged amino acids. These mutations functionally rescued LKB1-dependent activation of mutant AMPK in vitro and in cell culture.

Its heterotrimeric structure includes a catalytic α-subunit and regulatory β- and γ-subunits. These subunits exist in different isoforms (α1, α2, β1, β2, γ1, γ2, and γ3) and splice variants (for γ2 and γ3) and can thus assemble to a broad variety of heterotrimeric isoform combinations. The α- and β-subunits possess multiple autophosphorylation sites, which have been implicated in regulation of subcellular localization and kinase activation (11Tuerk R.D. Auchli Y. Thali R.F.

The most critical step of AMPK activation, however, is phosphorylation of Thr-172 within the activation segment of the α-subunit kinase domain. At least two AMPK upstream kinases (AMPKKs) have been identified so far, namely the tumor suppressor kinase LKB1 in complex with MO25 and STRAD (16Hawley S.A. Boudeau J. Reid J.L. Mustard K.J. Udd L.

Besides direct phosphorylation of Thr-172, AMPK activity is stimulated by the allosteric activator AMP, which can bind to two Bateman domains formed by two pairs of CBS domains within the γ-subunit (19Davies S.P.

Further valuable structural information is provided by the x-ray structures of the isolated catalytic domains, in particular of the human AMPK α2-subunit (Protein Data Bank code 2H6D) and its yeast ortholog SNF1 (36Nayak V.

The kinase domain of SNF1 is capable of forming homodimers in the protein crystal, as well as in vitro in solution, in a unique way, which has not been observed previously in any other kinase (36Nayak V.

The dimer interface is predominantly formed by hydrophobic interactions of the loop-αG region, also known as subdomain X situated on the large kinase lobe (36Nayak V. Zhao K. Wyce A. Schwartz M.F.

Because the T-loop activation segment was buried within the dimer interface, it was suggested that the dimeric state of the SNF1 catalytic domain represents the inactive form of the kinase. Intriguingly, it was shown in our groups by small angle x-ray scattering that AMPK self-organizes in a concentration-dependent manner to form homo-oligomers in solution (31Riek U. Scholz R.

Site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene) was performed to replace both Val-219 and Phe-223 of the AMPKα1 kinase domain with glutamate and both Ile-260 and Phe-264 of the LKB1 kinase domain with lysine. We refer to the corresponding double mutants as VEFE-AMPK and IKFK-LKB1 (as opposed to WT-AMPK and WT-LKB1) for the remainder of this report. Mutations were introduced into tricistronic bacterial expression plasmids encoding for nontagged AMPK α1β1γ1 and hexahistidine-tagged LKB1-MO25α-STRADα, respectively, as well as in mammalian expression plasmids encoding for Myc-tagged AMPK α1 and FLAG-tagged LKB1. Primer sequences are available from the author upon request. All plasmids were verified by sequencing (Microsynth AG, Balgach, Switzerland). Heterotrimeric AMPK and LKB1-MO25α-STRADα complexes were expressed in Tuner (DE3) and Rosetta2 (DE3) Escherichia coli cells, respectively (Novagen). Bacteria were grown in 4 liters of auto-induction medium (46Studier F.W. Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar) for 2 h at 37 °C and subsequently for 22 h at room temperature with shaking at 220 rpm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and proteins were extracted as described recently (31Riek U. Scholz R. Konarev P. Rufer A. Suter M. Nazabal A. Ringler P. Chami M. Müller S.A. Neumann D.

Heterotrimeric AMPK was purified using either of two strategies both leading to high quality protein. (i) The fully automated four-dimensional purification protocol, as described previously (31Riek U. Scholz R. Konarev P. Rufer A. Suter M. Nazabal A. Ringler P. Chami M. Müller S.A. Neumann D.

Ramirez S. Wallimann T. Schlattner U. BioTechniques. 2009; 46: ix-xiiCrossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), was suitable for the large amounts of highly purified protein needed in SAXS measurements. (ii) The two-dimensional purification protocol (adapted from Ref. 40Neumann D. Woods A. Carling D. Wallimann T. Schlattner U. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 30: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) was applied for purification of AMPK that was used in all other experiments. Briefly, 1 ml of nickel-Sepharose HP (GE Healthcare) was used in a batch affinity purification procedure at room temperature for 1 h before washing and elution. In both protocols the size exclusion chromatography step was carried out using a Superdex 200 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in gel filtration buffer containing 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, and Hepes-Cl, respectively, 4 mm MgCl2, 8 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, at 7 °C. Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated in a Vivaspin 20 centrifugal concentrator with a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff (Sartorius AG, Goettingen, Germany) at 470 × g and 4 °C. Protein stock solutions were supplemented with 2 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride and stored either at 4 °C or in 50% glycerol at −20 °C. His-LKB1-MO25α-STRADα wild type and mutant complexes were purified as described recently (41Neumann D. Suter M. Tuerk R. Riek U. Wallimann T. Mol. Biotechnol. 2007; 36: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Extraction and Ni2+-affinity purification of LKB1 complexes was performed analogous to the two-dimensional purification procedure for AMPK. CamKK2 and PP2Cα were expressed and purified as published previously (22Suter M. Riek U. Tuerk R. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Neumann D. J. Biol.

Data collection of the synchrotron SAXS measurements was performed at DESY (Hamburg, Germany) on the X33 camera of the EMBL analogous to the procedure reported earlier (31Riek U. Scholz R. Konarev P. Rufer A. Suter M. Nazabal A. Ringler P. Chami M. Müller S.A. Neumann D. Forstner M. Hennig M. Zenobi R. Engel A. Svergun D. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. J. Biol.

WT-AMPK and VEFE-AMPK were purified by the fully automated four-dimensional purification protocol, and scattering was recorded in a concentration range of 0.5 to 12 mg/ml. To check for radiation damage, two successive 2-min exposures were compared, but no radiation effects were observed. The data were reduced and processed, and the overall parameters were computed following standard procedures of the software package PRIMUS (48Konarev P.V. Petoukhov M.V. Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2006; 39: 277-286Crossref Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The radius of gyration (Rg) was evaluated using the Guinier approximation (49Guinier A. Ann. Phys. 1939; 12: 161-237Crossref Google Scholar) assuming that at very small angles (s < 1.3/Rg) the intensity is represented by I(s) = I(0) exp(−1/3(sRg)2) and calculated from the entire scattering patterns using the program GNOM (50Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2987) Google Scholar). Nontagged WT-AMPK and VEFE-AMPK were purified by the two-dimensional purification protocol. AMPK was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 10 mm Hepes-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, 50 μm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4. Samples were supplemented with 0.005% Surfactant P20 before being injected at concentrations of 0.5 and 5.6 μm. The stability of AMPK oligomers was analyzed by SPR using a BIAcore instrument (GE Healthcare) equipped with an NTA sensor chip that was loaded with Ni2+ according to the manufacturer's instructions. Because of the intrinsic affinity of AMPK to Ni-NTA (31Riek U. Scholz R. Konarev P. Rufer A. Suter M. Nazabal A. Ringler P. Chami M. Müller S.A. Neumann D. Forstner M. Hennig M. Zenobi R. Engel A.

Polge and U. Schlattner, unpublished data. In addition, because AMPK oligomerization is a readily reversible process upon dilution (31Riek U. Scholz R. Konarev P. Rufer A. Suter M. Nazabal A. Ringler P. Chami M. Müller S.A. Neumann D. Forstner M. Hennig M. Zenobi R. Engel A. Svergun D. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18331-18343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the recorded dissociation kinetics upon injection were a measure of dissociating AMPK-AMPK but not AMPK-chip interactions. WT-AMPK and VEFE-AMPK were injected at 1.2 ml/h and 25 °C directly onto the chip, and association and dissociation curves were recorded. The chip surface was recovered by injection of regeneration buffer (10 mm Hepes-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 350 mm EDTA, 0,005% Surfactant P20, pH 8.3). Although the association kinetics were similar at a given protein concentration, dissociation showed marked differences. However, the latter could not be fitted by one or two exponential rate equations, indicating a complex interaction. Curves were instead normalized to dissociation start (just subsequent to a bulk refractive index shift, if occurring), and an end dissociation point at 100 s was defined to analyze the relative extent of dissociation. Experiments were done at least in triplicate to calculate average and standard deviation. Samples containing AMPK were separated by gradient BN-PAGE in the first dimension and then denatured and separated again using SDS-PAGE in the second dimension. The AMPK α-subunit was subsequently detected by Western blot analysis. BN-PAGE was conducted similar to published protocols (51Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar, 52Wittig I. Braun H.P. Schägger H. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar), except for the cathode buffer (15 mm BisTris-Cl, 50 mm Bicine, pH 7.0, at 4 °C) and the acrylamide/bisacrylamide mixtures (AB mix). The AB mix consisted either of 33% T, 3% C or 30% T, 2.6% C (53Hjerten S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1962; 99: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Gradient gels (4–13%) with a stacking layer (3%) were prepared with a gradient mixer (Bio-Rad) using 4% T and 13% T, 20% glycerol solutions and gel plates with a 1-mm spacer. Molecular mass markers (all from Sigma) were thyroglobulin (669 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), and albumin (monomer 66 kDa and dimer 132 kDa). Markers and samples were supplemented with 10% glycerol and Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 at a concentration of 0.025%. For comparison of activated with nonactivated recombinant α1β1γ1 AMPK, 10 μg were incubated in kinase buffer (10 mm Hepes-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP) in the presence or absence of 90 μg/ml recombinant His-LKB1-MO25α-STRADα for 1.5 h at 30 °C. After BN PAGE at 4 °C (200 V, 3 h), gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, and individual lanes were excised. The strips were soaked in 2% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol for 1 h at room temperature and subjected to SDS-PAGE as indicated in the figure legends. In Tricine/SDS-PAGE (54Schägger H. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar, 55Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar), the BN-PAGE stripes were embedded in a 6% native stacking layer on top of a 6% denaturing stacking layer and an 8% denaturing resolving layer. In Laemmli SDS-PAGE (56Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), a 5% stacking layer embedding the BN-PAGE strips were layered on top of a 12 or 15% resolving layer. Both methods gave similar results. For comparison of two different samples (e.g. WT-AMPK and VEFE-AMPK), these were separated in parallel in the same first dimension gel (mini gel) and second dimension gel (16.5 × 22-cm glass plates) before being transferred to a single membrane and analyzed by immunodetection. Analyses by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as reported earlier (22Suter M. Riek U. Tuerk R. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Neumann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32207-32216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). AMPKα (2532) and Thr(P)-172 (2535) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Inc. Signals were quantified by densitometry using the software Quantity One, version 4.6.3.088 (Bio-Rad). AMPK (25 μg/ml) was activated in kinase buffer by recombinant His-LKB1-MO25α-STRADα (187.5 μg/ml) or recombinant GST-CamKK2 (15 μg/ml) for 20 min at 30 °C or as indicated in the figure. AMPK activity was probed simultaneously by Western blot analysis of Thr-172 phosphorylation and by determination of kinase activity as described (22Suter M. Riek U. Tuerk R. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Neumann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32207-32216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Kinase activity of AMPK from transfected immortalized AMPKα subunit double knock-out (α1−/−, α2−/−) MEFs was determined following immunoprecipitation. Briefly, cells were lysed, and AMPK was immunoprecipitated from 0.5 mg of precleared cell lysate overnight at 4 °C using anti-AMPKα1 antibody (kindly provided by Professor D. G. Hardie, University of Dundee, Dundee, Scotland, UK). The immunoprecipitate was washed twice in lysis buffer and once with lysis buffer lacking Triton X-100. Subsequently"
https://openalex.org/W1977080491,"Herein, for the first time, the electrochemiluminescent sensor based on Ru(bpy)(3) (2+)-modified electrode using dopamine as an adhesive was successfully developed. After halloysite nanotube slurry was cast on a glassy carbon electrode and dried, an alkaline dopamine solution was added on the electrode surface. Initially, polydopamine belts with dimensions of tens to hundreds of nanometers formed via oxidization of the dopamine by ambient oxygen. As the incubation time increased, the nanobelts became broader and then united with each other to form a polydopamine film. The halloysite nanotubes were embedded within the polydopamine film. The above electrode was soaked in Ru(bpy)(3) (2+) aqueous solution to adsorb Ru(bpy)(3) (2+) into the active sites of the halloysite nanotubes via cation-exchange procedure. Through this simple procedure, a Ru(bpy)(3) (2+)-modified electrode was obtained using only 6.25 microg Ru(bpy)(3) (2+), 15.0 microg dopamine, and 9.0 microg halloysite nanotubes. The electrochemistry and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of the modified electrode was investigated using tripropylamine (TPA) and nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) as co-reactants. The different ECL behaviors of the modified electrode using NTA and TPA as well as the contact angle measurements reflected the hydrophilic character of the electrode. The results indicate that halloysite nanotubes have a high loading capacity for Ru(bpy)(3) (2+) and that dopamine is suitable for the preparation of modified electrodes."
https://openalex.org/W2065289052,"Background Breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1) reduces the number and the size of secondary tumours in a mouse model without affecting the growth of the primary foci upon its re-expression. Knockdown of BRMS1 expression associates with metastasis. The molecular details on BRMS1 mechanism of action include its ability to function as a transcriptional co-repressor and consistently BRMS1 has been described as a predominantly nuclear protein. Since cellular distribution could represent a potential mechanism of regulation, we wanted to characterize BRMS1 sequence motifs that might regulate its cellular distribution. According to its amino acids sequence, BRMS1 contain two putative nuclear localization signals, however none of them has been proved to work so far. Methodology/Principal Findings By using well known in vivo assays to detect both nuclear import and export signal, we have characterized, in the present study, one functional nuclear localisation signal as necessary and sufficient to promote nuclear transport. Additionally, the outcome of a directed yeast two-hybrid assay identify importin α6 as a specific partner of BRMS1 thus speculating that BRMS1 nuclear import could be specifically mediated by the reported nuclear transporter. Besides, the combination of a computational searching approach along the utilization of a nuclear export assay, identified a functional motif within the BRMS1 sequence responsible for its nuclear export, that resulted not affected by the highly specific CRM1 inhibitor Leptomycin-B. Interspecies heterokaryon assay demonstrate the capability of BRMS1 to shuttle between the nuclear and cytosolic compartments Conclusions/Significance Our results show for the first time that BRMS1 contains both nuclear import and export signals enabling its nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling. These findings contributes new data for the understanding of the BRMS1 functions and allow us to speculate that this phenomenon could represent a novel mechanism for regulating the activity of BRMS1 or its associated cytosolic partners"
https://openalex.org/W2066757936,"In low GC content gram-positive bacteria, the HPr protein is the master regulator of carbon metabolism. HPr is a key component of the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP):sugar phosphotransferase system that interacts with and/or phosphorylates proteins relevant to carbon catabolite repression. HPr can be phosphorylated by two distinct kinases as follows: the bifunctional enzyme HPr kinase/Ser(P)-HPr phosphorylase (HprK/P) phosphorylating the serine 46 residue (Ser(P)-HPr) and acting as a phosphorylase on Ser(P)-HPr; and the PEP-requiring enzyme I (EI) generating histidine 15-phosphorylated HPr (His(P)-HPr). The various HPr forms interact with numerous enzymes and modulate their activity. By carrying out a genome-wide yeast two-hybrid screen of a Bacillus subtilis library, we identified a novel HPr-interacting protein, the transcriptional activator YesS, which regulates the expression of pectin/rhamnogalacturonan utilization genes. Remarkably, yeast tri-hybrid assays involving the ATP-dependent HprK/P and the PEP-dependent EI suggested that YesS interacts with HPr and His(P)-HPr but not with Ser(P)-HPr. These findings were confirmed by in vitro interaction assays using the purified HPr-binding domain of the YesS protein. Furthermore, pectin utilization and in vivo YesS-mediated transcriptional activation depended upon the presence of His(P)-HPr, indicating that HPr-mediated YesS regulation serves as a novel type of carbon catabolite repression. In the yeast two-hybrid assays, B. subtilis HprK/P and EI were active and specifically recognized their substrates. Both kinases formed long lived complexes only with the corresponding nonphosphorylatable mutant HPr. These findings suggest that two-hybrid assays can be used for the identification of unknown kinases of phosphorylated bacterial proteins detected in phosphoproteome analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2026763832,"Background Since 2004, 21 highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 outbreaks in domestic poultry and eight human cases have been confirmed in Cambodia. As a result, a large number of avian influenza education campaigns have been ongoing in provinces in which H5N1outbreaks have occurred in humans and/or domestic poultry. Methodology/Principal Findings Data were collected from 1,252 adults >15 years old living in two southern provinces in Cambodia where H5N1 has been confirmed in domestic poultry and human populations using two cross-sectional surveys conducted in January 2006 and in November/December 2007. Poultry handling behaviors, poultry mortality occurrence and self-reported notification of suspect H5N1 poultry cases to animal health officials in these two surveys were evaluated. Our results demonstrate that although some at risk practices have declined since the first study, risky contact with poultry is still frequent. Improved rates of reporting poultry mortality were observed overall, but reporting to trained village animal health workers decreased by approximately 50%. Conclusions/Significance Although some improvements in human behavior have occurred, there are still areas—particularly with respect to the handling of poultry among children and the proper treatment of poultry and the surrounding household environment—that need to be addressed in public health campaigns. Though there were some differences in the sampling methods of the 2006 and 2007 surveys, our results illustrate the potential to induce considerable, potentially very relevant, behavioral changes over a short period of time."
https://openalex.org/W2086046104,"It is known that miRNA target sites are very short and the effect of miRNA-target site interaction alone appears as being unspecific. Recent experiments suggest further context signals involved in miRNA target site recognition and regulation. Here, we present a novel GC-rich RNA motif downstream of experimentally supported miRNA target sites in human mRNAs with no similarity to previously reported functional motifs. We demonstrate that the novel motif can be found in at least one third of all transcripts regulated by miRNAs. Furthermore, we show that motif occurrence and the frequency of miRNA target sites as well as the stability of their duplex structures correlate. The finding, that the novel motif is significantly associated with miRNA target sites, suggests a functional role of the motif in miRNA target site biology. Beyond, the novel motif has the impact to improve prediction of miRNA target sites significantly."
https://openalex.org/W2162430728,"Stringently controlled conditional expressing systems are crucial for the functional characterization of genes. Currently, screening of multiple clones to identify the tightly controlled ones is necessary but time-consuming. Here, we describe a system fusing Tet (tetracycline)-inducible elements, BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) and Gateway technology together to allow tight control of gene expression in BAC-transfected eukaryotic bulk cell cultures. Recombinase cloning into the shuttle vector and the BAC facilitates vector construction. An EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) allows FACS (fluorescence activated cell sorting) and the BAC technology ensures tight control of gene expression that is independent of the integrating site. In the current first application, our gene of interest encodes a β-catenin-ERα fusion protein. Tested by luciferase assay and western blotting, in HTB56 lung cancer cells the final BAC E11-IGR-β-catenin-ERα vector demonstrated sensitive inducibility by Tet or Dox (doxycycline) in a dose-dependent manner with low background, and the EGFP was an effective selection marker by FACS in bulk culture HTB56 and myeloblastic 32D cells. This is a highly efficient tool for the rapid generation of stringently controlled Tet-inducible systems in cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W2036974397,"SYT (SYnovial sarcoma Translocated gene or SS18) is widely produced as two isoforms, SYT/L and SYT/S, that are thought to function in the nucleus as transcriptional coactivators. Using isoform-specific antibodies, we detected a sizable pool of SYT isoforms in the cytosol where the proteins were organized into filamentous arrays. Actin and actin-associated proteins co-immunoprecipitated with SYT isoforms, which also co-sedimented and co-localized with the actin cytoskeleton in cultured cells and tissues. The association of SYT with actin bundles was extensive yet stopped short of the distal ends at focal adhesions. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton also led to a breakdown of the filamentous organization of SYT isoforms in the cytosol. RNAi ablation of SYT/L alone or both isoforms markedly impaired formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions but did not affect formation of cortical actin bundles. Furthermore, ablation of SYT led to markedly impaired adhesion and spreading on fibronectin and laminin-111 but not on collagen types I or IV. These findings indicate that cytoplasmic SYT isoforms interact with actin filaments and function in the ability cells to bind and react to specific extracellular matrices."
https://openalex.org/W2109151453,"SNARE proteins are conserved components of the core fusion machinery driving diverse membrane adhesion and fusion processes in the cell. In many cases micron-sized membranes adhere over large areas before fusion. Reconstituted in vitro assays have helped isolate SNARE mechanisms in small membrane adhesion-fusion and are emerging as powerful tools to study large membrane systems by use of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Here we model SNARE-mediated adhesion kinetics in SNARE-reconstituted GUV-GUV or GUV-supported bilayer experiments. Adhesion involves many SNAREs whose complexation pulls apposing membranes into contact. The contact region is a tightly bound rapidly expanding patch whose growth velocity v(patch) increases with SNARE density Gamma(snare). We find three patch expansion regimes: slow, intermediate, fast. Typical experiments belong to the fast regime where v(patch) ~ (Gamma(snare)(2/3) depends on SNARE diffusivities and complexation binding constant. The model predicts growth velocities ~10 - 300 microm/s. The patch may provide a close contact region where SNAREs can trigger fusion. Extending the model to a simple description of fusion, a broad distribution of fusion times is predicted. Increasing SNARE density accelerates fusion by boosting the patch growth velocity, thereby providing more complexes to participate in fusion. This quantifies the notion of SNAREs as dual adhesion-fusion agents."
