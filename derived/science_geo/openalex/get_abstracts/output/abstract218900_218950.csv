https://openalex.org/W2068683470,"At the conclusion of this discussion it is important to keep in mind the influences of all the complex processes involved in visual spatial localization, among which stereopsis is only one. The various factors and cues for this spatial localization interact with, complement, reinforce, and perhaps even inhibit one another, depending upon the varying visual surroundings of the moment and upon the physiologic perfection of the visual apparatus. In one's daily work probably no single factor or group of factors dominates at all times. ""Any one who knows how pliable our spatial visual perceptions are under the influence of various conditions of observation and under the influence of past experience, taken into account consciously or unconsciously, should not be surprised at the multiplicity of results of observations on different objects and with different observers"" (see 18)."

Quantitative3 and qualitative4 changes in the food supplied, at a time when milk is normally the only source, may have late effects that become apparent only in the adult animal. The time at which rats are weaned is also of importance. Thus premature weaning (when the infant rat can survive without the mother, but normally still lives predominantly on milk—about day 15–18 postnatally) causes impairment of spermiogenesis in male rats5 and also decreases fertility in female rats6."

Two later occupational levels are dated at 7350 and 2090 years B.P. No artifacts are associated with the oldest bones, which are believed to be an accidental burial on the edge of a cienaga."

The level of strontium-90 found in these samples is in general agreement with the findings of other investigators, with the exception that the highest levels of strontium-90 in wheat were found in samples from Oklahoma."

https://openalex.org/W1978728479,"IN a series of investigations on dry-matter intake and fæces output of ewes, at different feed-levels, it was observed that a particular fraction of the fæces, readily dissolved by treatment with dilute acid, was closely related to the intake of dry matter. It was considered that this dissolved fæcal fraction would be unlikely to contain any high proportion of food residues already subjected to fermentation and digestion in the alimentary tract but was likely to consist largely of the more soluble parts of the metabolic fraction of the fæces. It has already been shown that this fraction bears a close relationship to dry matter intake1,2."
