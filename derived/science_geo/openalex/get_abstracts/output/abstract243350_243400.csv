https://openalex.org/W2155900554,"Many large animal species have a high risk of extinction. This is usually thought to result simply from the way that species traits associated with vulnerability, such as low reproductive rates, scale with body size. In a broad-scale analysis of extinction risk in mammals, we find two additional patterns in the size selectivity of extinction risk. First, impacts of both intrinsic and environmental factors increase sharply above a threshold body mass around 3 kilograms. Second, whereas extinction risk in smaller species is driven by environmental factors, in larger species it is driven by a combination of environmental factors and intrinsic traits. Thus, the disadvantages of large size are greater than generally recognized, and future loss of large mammal biodiversity could be far more rapid than expected."

https://openalex.org/W2082040849,"The neck and shoulder region of vertebrates has undergone a complex evolutionary history. To identify its underlying mechanisms we map the destinations of embryonic neural crest and mesodermal stem cells using Cre-recombinase-mediated transgenesis. The single-cell resolution of this genetic labelling reveals cryptic cell boundaries traversing the seemingly homogeneous skeleton of the neck and shoulders. Within this assembly of bones and muscles we discern a precise code of connectivity that mesenchymal stem cells of both neural crest and mesodermal origin obey as they form muscle scaffolds. The neural crest anchors the head onto the anterior lining of the shoulder girdle, while a Hox-gene-controlled mesoderm links trunk muscles to the posterior neck and shoulder skeleton. The skeleton that we identify as neural crest-derived is specifically affected in human Klippel-Feil syndrome, Sprengel's deformity and Arnold-Chiari I/II malformation, providing insights into their likely aetiology. We identify genes involved in the cellular modularity of the neck and shoulder skeleton and propose a new method for determining skeletal homologies that is based on muscle attachments. This has allowed us to trace the whereabouts of the cleithrum, the major shoulder bone of extinct land vertebrate ancestors, which seems to survive as the scapular spine in living mammals."

https://openalex.org/W2032042205,"The recent discovery of bacteria in deep sediments and rocks, seemingly able to survive for millions of years with hardly any energy supply, has profound implications. For example, it impinges on theories of the origin of life, the prospects for subsurface life on other planets, and fossil fuel formation. Not surprisingly then, there is considerable controversy regarding these claims. Now a new survey shows that bacteria in deep marine sediments are not only active but are stimulated in the subsurface by chemical and geological changes occurring on geological timescales. The sub-seafloor biosphere is the largest prokaryotic habitat on Earth1 but also a habitat with the lowest metabolic rates2. Modelled activity rates are very low, indicating that most prokaryotes may be inactive or have extraordinarily slow metabolism2. Here we present results from two Pacific Ocean sites, margin and open ocean, both of which have deep, subsurface stimulation of prokaryotic processes associated with geochemical and/or sedimentary interfaces. At 90 m depth in the margin site, stimulation was such that prokaryote numbers were higher (about 13-fold) and activity rates higher than or similar to near-surface values. Analysis of high-molecular-mass DNA confirmed the presence of viable prokaryotes and showed changes in biodiversity with depth that were coupled to geochemistry, including a marked community change at the 90-m interface. At the open ocean site, increases in numbers of prokaryotes at depth were more restricted but also corresponded to increased activity; however, this time they were associated with repeating layers of diatom-rich sediments (about 9 Myr old). These results show that deep sedimentary prokaryotes can have high activity, have changing diversity associated with interfaces and are active over geological timescales."

https://openalex.org/W2111259863,"The discovery of multipotent neural progenitor (NP) cells has provided strong support for the existence of neurogenesis in the adult brain. However, the signals controlling NP proliferation remain elusive. Endocannabinoids, the endogenous counterparts of marijuana-derived cannabinoids, act as neuromodulators via presynaptic CB1 receptors and also control neural cell death and survival. Here we show that progenitor cells express a functional endocannabinoid system that actively regulates cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, NPs produce endocannabinoids and express the CB1 receptor and the endocannabinoid-inactivating enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). CB1 receptor activation promotes cell proliferation and neurosphere generation, an action that is abrogated in CB1-deficient NPs. Accordingly, proliferation of hippocampal NPs is increased in FAAH-deficient mice. Our results demonstrate that endocannabinoids constitute a new group of signaling cues that regulate NP proliferation and thus open novel therapeutic avenues for manipulation of NP cell fate in the adult brain."
https://openalex.org/W2071884450,"Rab GTPases regulate all stages of membrane trafficking, including vesicle budding, cargo sorting, transport, tethering and fusion. In the inactive (GDP-bound) conformation, accessory factors facilitate the targeting of Rab GTPases to intracellular compartments. After nucleotide exchange to the active (GTP-bound) conformation, Rab GTPases interact with functionally diverse effectors including lipid kinases, motor proteins and tethering complexes. How effectors distinguish between homologous Rab GTPases represents an unresolved problem with respect to the specificity of vesicular trafficking. Using a structural proteomic approach, we have determined the specificity and structural basis underlying the interaction of the multivalent effector rabenosyn-5 with the Rab family. The results demonstrate that even the structurally similar effector domains in rabenosyn-5 can achieve highly selective recognition of distinct subsets of Rab GTPases exclusively through interactions with the switch and interswitch regions. The observed specificity is determined at a family-wide level by structural diversity in the active conformation, which governs the spatial disposition of critical conserved recognition determinants, and by a small number of both positive and negative sequence determinants that allow further discrimination between Rab GTPases with similar switch conformations."

Their selective small interference RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown potentiates isoprenaline-stimulated protein kinase A (PKA) activation. Whereas endogenous PDE4D co-immunoprecipitates with βarrestin, endogenous PDE4B does not, even upon PDE4D knockdown. Ectopic overexpression of PDE4B2 confers co-immunoprecipitation with βarrestin. Knockdown of PDE4D, but not PDE4B, amplifies isoprenaline-stimulated phosphorylation of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) by PKA and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) through Gi. Isoform-selective knockdown identifies PDE4D5 as the functionally important species regulating isoprenaline stimulation of both these processes. Ht31-mediated disruption of the tethering of PKA to AKAP scaffold proteins attenuates isoprenaline activation of ERK, even upon PDE4D knockdown. Selective siRNA-mediated knockdown identifies AKAP79, which is constitutively associated with the β2-AR, rather than isoprenaline-recruited gravin, as being the functionally relevant AKAP in this process. Isoprenaline-stimulated membrane recruitment of PDE4D is ablated uponβarrestin knockdown. A mutation that compromises interactions with βarrestin prevents catalytically inactive PDE4D5 from performing a dominant negative role in potentiating isoprenaline-stimulated ERK activation. βarrestin-recruited PDE4D5 desensitizes isoprenaline-stimulated PKA phosphorylation of the β2-AR and the consequential switching of its signaling to ERK. The ability to observe a cellular phenotype upon PDE4D5 knockdown demonstrates that other PDE4 isoforms, expressed at endogenous levels, are unable to afford rescue in HEK293B2 cells.

Of these, the PDE4 family of enzymes has gained attention in view of the fact that chemical knock-out with selective inhibitors indicates that they perform an important role in regulating key processes such as inflammation and cognition (15Conti M.

Nevertheless, important insights into physiological function have come from gene knockout studies on the PDE4B and PDE4D sub-families, which have implied distinct roles for these sub-families in macrophage functioning, in muscarinic regulation of airway contraction, and in depression (21Hansen G.

Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The rapid uncoupling of this response can be achieved by the action of the G-protein receptor-coupled kinase, GRK2. This kinase phosphorylates the plasma membrane-associated β2-AR and allows recruitment of βarrestins from the cytosol, which then sterically interdict coupling of the β2-AR with Gs. The importance of such βarrestin interaction to G-protein-coupled receptor function in vivo has been clearly established in knock-out mouse models (32Conner D.A. Mathier M.A. Mortensen R.M.

Science. 1999; 286: 2495-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). Recently, a new feature of the GRK/βarrestin desensitization system associated with the β2-AR has been identified (34Perry S.J. Baillie G.S. Kohout T.A. McPhee I. Magiera M.M. Ang K.L. Miller W.E.

Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), namely that PDE4 isoforms from all four sub-families can interact with βarrestins, due to a common interaction site within their catalytic unit. This allows βarrestin to cause an agonist-dependent increase in cAMP degradation in the locality of the β2-AR by recruiting PDE4 isoforms to the β2-AR. Such recruited PDE4 can regulate the activity of PKA at the plasma membrane, thereby influencing the PKA phosphorylation status of the β2-AR itself (36Baillie G.S. Sood A. McPhee I. Gall I. Perry S.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Houslay M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 940-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). This has a functional correlate as the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the β2-AR allows it to switch its coupling from Gs to Gi (38Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). The consequence of this is that the activated β2-AR can effect a transient activation of ERK, in a Gi and PKA-dependent fashion (38Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). βArrestin recruited PDE4, in diminishing the phosphorylation of the β2-AR by PKA, thereby attenuates the ability of the β2-AR to couple to Gi and activate ERK (36Baillie G.S. Sood A. McPhee I. Gall I. Perry S.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Houslay M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 940-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Although PDE4 enzymes as a family can be selectively inhibited, the identical catalytic units exhibited within a particular sub-family, together with close homology between sub-families, precludes using active site-directed inhibitors as tools for understanding the functional role of isoforms. We develop here, for the first time, small interfering RNA (siRNA) gene silencing reagents that allow for the selective ablation of endogenous PDE4 enzymes in HEK293B2 cells. These enable us to identify PDE4D5 as playing a unique role in regulating the isoprenaline-stimulated phosphorylation of the β2-AR by PKA and in the switching of its action to the activation of ERK. Our data demonstrate, for the first time, that a particular PDE4 isoform can exclusively exert a specific functional role in a cell.

After treatment, HEK293B2 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline before being scraped into lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5) with added protease inhibitors (Complete protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Applied Science). Proteins were separated by PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting. Protein concentrations of cell lysates were determined with bovine serum albumin as a standard using Bradford reagent as previously described (36Baillie G.S. Sood A. McPhee I. Gall I. Perry S.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Houslay M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 940-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Immunopurification—This was done for the four PDE4 sub-families as described before by us (41MacKenzie S.J. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 44Shepherd M.C. Baillie G.S. Stirling D.I. Houslay M.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 142: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, detergent-soluble proteins were isolated from cells by disruption in lysis buffer (1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaH2PO4, 2H2O) containing Complete protease inhibitor mixture to 8% volume. Detergent-insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × gav for 10 min, and the soluble fraction was retained. Note that in cells studied here this procedure extracted and solubilized efficiently the immunoreactive PDE4 species as assessed by immunoblotting (>94%). To quantify the proportion of total PDE4 activity accounted for by the activity of individual PDE4 sub-families, quantitative immunopurification was done using polyclonal anti-sera specific for the C-terminal regions of PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, and PDE4D. Equal volumes of cell lysate containing 500 μg of protein were cleared by incubation with 30 μl of pre-immune serum and 30 μl of protein A slurry. The beads were then removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × gav for 10 min at 4 °C, and cleared lysate was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with constant agitation with a volume of antiserum determined to immunoprecipitate all of the specific PDE4 sub-family. Immunoglobulins were then isolated by incubation with protein-A-coated Sepharose beads for 1 h before retrieval by refrigerated centrifugation at 10,000 × gav for 5 min. PDE4 isoform-immunoglobulin conjugates attached to the beads were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline twice before two further washes in KHEM (50 mm KCl, 10 mm EGTA, 50 mm HEPES, and 1.92 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2, with added 0.001 mm dithiothreitol and Complete protease inhibitor mixture to 8% volume prior to use) and one wash in PDE4 assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4) prior to use. In doing this we ensured that the complete and specific immunopurification of the entire pool of the indicated PDE4 sub-family was achieved by Western blotting the supernatant with antisera for the four PDE4 sub-families. Immunopurified material thus acquired was used for either Western blot analysis or PDE4 assay. The β2-AR was immunopurified from HEK293B2 cells as described before by us in detail (36Baillie G.S.

Immunoprecipitation Studies of Endogenous βArrestin and PDE4 Isoforms—This was done as described before by us (34Perry S.J. Baillie G.S. Kohout T.A. McPhee I. Magiera M.M. Ang K.L. Miller W.E.

Briefly, cells were washed in KHEM buffer, harvested, homogenized, and fractionated as described above. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous βarrestin was done by pre-clearing the S2 fraction (500 μg of protein) with 50 μl of KHEM-washed protein A beads (Amersham Biosciences) before the addition of either 5 μl of polyclonal antibody against βarrestin (A1CT) or 5 μl of pre-immune serum. The tubes were incubated at 4 °C with end-over-end mixing for 1 h before the addition of 50 μl of protein A beads. The tubes were mixed for a further 2 h at 4°C before the beads were pelleted at 1300 × g for 3 min. The beads were washed three times in KHEM buffer before being boiled in Laemmli SDS sample buffer (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates and lysate (1/20th total lysate) were run on SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with the PDE4D monoclonal antibody. Each experiment was carried out on three separate occasions, and the amount of PDE4D3 and PDE4D5 that co-immunoprecipitated with βarrestin was quantified by densitometry. siRNA Knockdown—To achieve the selective knockdown of the entire 4B or 4D sub-families, we designed double-stranded 21-mer RNA duplexes targeted at regions of sequence that are unique to each of these sub-families. The 21-mer duplexes were engineered to have a GC content between 30 and 50% and to begin with an adenosine dimer (AA). All oligonucleotide sequences were screened against the human expressed sequence tag library data base to ensure specificity of the siRNA. The PDE4B siRNA is located in the region of the PDE4B transcript that codes for residues 291–297 (PTQKDR; numbering as in the PDE4B2 isoform, GenBank™ accession number M97515) of the sequence, AAGCAUCUCACGCUUUGGAGU. The PDE4D siRNA is located in the region of the PDE4D transcript that codes for residues 456–461 (ELALMY; numbering as in the PDE4D5 isoform, GenBank™ accession number AF_012073) of the sequence, AAGAACUUGCCUUGAUGUACA. Each PDE4 sub-family siRNA was obtained from Dharmacon. The sequences described here result from the culmination of an extensive study to find siRNA duplexes that achieve efficient knockdown of the indicated species with no effect on expression of isoforms from the other PDE4 sub-families found in these cells. A nonspecific siRNA control (duplex XII, Dharmacon) was obtained and used at the appropriate optimal concentration. Note that cells that had not been exposed to any form of siRNA gave data as per those treated with this non-targeted (control) siRNA (data not shown). To deplete PDE4D3 and PDE4D5 selectively, a Dharmacon proprietary method using the SMARTpool (siDESIGN) algorithm held at Dharmacon's website (www.Dharmacon.com) provided the necessary sequences of pools of duplexes required to deplete each of these PDE4D isoforms specifically and selectively. SMARTpools of 4 oligonucleotides were employed to knockdown the two human isoforms PDE4D3 and PDE4D5. The PDE4D3 (L20970) SMARTpool contained 5′-CACGATAGCTGCTCAAACA-3′, 5′-TAACGTAGGAGACAAGAAA-3′, 5′-TGATGCACGTGAATAATTT-3′, and 5′-GAGTTGGAATTCATCTGTA-3′. The PDE4D5 (AF012073) SMARTpool contained 5′-GAACGAAGACCTTGTGAAA-3′, 5′-GACAAGCCCGGACACTTTA-3′, 5′-GAACCACGTTGCCCTGGAT-3′, and 5′-CAAGCTCTCTCCAGTGATC-3′. βArrestin1/2-specific siRNA has been described previously (46Ahn S.

We generated this here by using oligonucleotide primer (19 nucleotides long) sequences, as per these investigators, using an in vitro transcription kit called the Silencer siRNA Construction Kit (Ambion, Inc.). This uses T7 RNA polymerase to generate individual strands of the siRNA consisting of ∼21-bp double-stranded RNAs with 3′-dinucleotide overhangs. The resultant siRNA was transfected into HEK293B2 cells as described below. AKAP79 and AKAP12 (gravin) siRNA were purchased commercially. Human AKAP79-specific siRNA (catalog no. sc-29660, NM_004857) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. AKAP12-siRNA (AKAP250/gravin, NM_005100) was from Qiagen. Transcripts for OAS1 in control and siRNA transfected cells were determined by TaqMan analysis (47Bridge A.J. Pebernard S. Ducraux A. Nicoulaz A.L. Iggo R. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 263-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Transfection of PDE4-specific siRNA—Each siRNA oligonucleotide was delivered into target cells via the reagent Lf2000 (Invitrogen). Specifically, an aliquot of Lf2000 (1 mg/ml) was diluted 25-fold into the reduced serum medium Opti-MEM (plus Glutamax, Invitrogen), whereas separately, the siRNA samples were diluted in Opti-MEM to a final concentration of 100 nm. Both sample types were incubated at room temperature for 10 min after which time the Lf2000 and siRNA were mixed and incubated for an additional 20 min. Concurrently, the spent medium from cells grown to 40% confluence in 6-well plates was removed and replaced by an 800-μl aliquot of Opti-MEM. The siRNA transfection complexes were added, and the plates were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C (5% CO2). These complexes were then removed, replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and all samples were reincubated for the apposite time and temperature. Co-transfection of PDE4D-specific siRNA and Ectopically Overexpressed PDE4B2—Aliquots of 1 μg of pEE7 harboring the full-length PDE4B2 (39Huston E. Lumb S. Russell A. Catterall C. Ross A.H.

The co-transfection mixture was mixed with diluted Lf2000 and added to the target cells in 6-well plates (as above). Cell lysates were recovered after 72-h incubation (37 °C and 5% CO2). Treatment with Ht31 Species—Stock solutions (25 mm) of Ht31 and Ht31P peptides were dissolved in Me2SO and stored at 4 °C. Cells were pretreated with the peptides"

How differentiating cells remain protected from premature death, however, is still poorly defined. We show here that the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway is activated at early stages of mouse keratinocyte differentiation both in culture and in the intact epidermis in vivo. Expression of active Akt in keratinocytes promotes growth arrest and differentiation, whereas pharmacological blockade of PI3K inhibits the expression of “late” differentiation markers and leads to death of cells that would otherwise differentiate. Mechanistically, the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in keratinocyte differentiation depends on the activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor and Src families of tyrosine kinases and the engagement of E-cadherin-mediated adhesion. During this process, PI3K associates increasingly with cadherin-catenin protein complexes bearing tyrosine phosphorylated YXXM motifs. Thus, the PI3K signaling pathway regulates the choice between epidermal cell differentiation and death at the cross-talk between tyrosine kinases and cadherin-associated catenins.

Thus, the PI3K signaling pathway regulates the choice between epidermal cell differentiation and death at the cross-talk between tyrosine kinases and cadherin-associated catenins. The epidermis is a self-renewing stratified epithelium in which the loss of terminally differentiated cells from its surface is balanced by cells that leave the proliferative basal layer and enter differentiation (1Fuchs E. Byrne C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 2Watt F.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 1107-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Because a metabolically dead cornified cell envelope is the end point of epidermal differentiation, this process may be viewed as a specialized form of programmed cell death (3Maruoka Y. Harada H. Mitsuyasu T. Seta Y. Kurokawa H. Kajiyama M. Toyoshima K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 886-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Moreover, the apoptotic program and keratinocyte differentiation share overlapping signaling effector mechanisms (4Gandarillas A. Exp. Gerontol. 2000; 35: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Notably, the caspase-3 cysteine protease, an integral component of the cell death machinery, was implicated recently in embryonic keratinocyte differentiation control downstream of Notch1 (5Okuyama R. Nguyen B.C. Talora C. Ogawa E. Tommasi di Vignano A. Lioumi M. Chiorino G. Tagami H. Woo M. Dotto G.P. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 551-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and activation of the related caspase-14 has been reported during adult keratinocyte differentiation (6Rendl M. Ban J. Mrass P. Mayer C. Lengauer B. Eckhart L. Declerq W. Tschachler E. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2002; 119: 1150-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, “canonical” apoptosis and epidermal differentiation are distinct processes, with diverse execution times and biological outcomes; the former leads to the elimination of individual dead cells from tissues within hours, whereas the latter relies on the survival and synchronized maturation of whole sheets of cells over the course of weeks. Thus, an outstanding question is how keratinocytes can activate arrays of death-inducing signals during differentiation and yet remain protected from premature death. A candidate pathway for the survival of differentiating keratinocytes is the signaling module formed by the Class IA PI3K 4The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphoinisitide 3-kinase; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; PI, phosphoinositide; K, keratin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine.4The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphoinisitide 3-kinase; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; PI, phosphoinositide; K, keratin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine. and the downstream serine-threonine kinase Akt effectors (Akt/PKB-1, -2, and -3 isoforms) (7Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4542) Google Scholar). The PI3K family is divided into three distinct classes (Class I, II, and III) based on primary structure, substrate specificity, and mode of regulation (8Foster F.M. Traer C.J. Abraham S.M. Fry M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3037-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Class I PI3Ks include four distinct p110 catalytic isoforms, further divided into Class IA (-α, -β, -δ) and IB (-γ); among these, p110α and p110β are the isoforms expressed mostly in epithelia (9Anderson K.E. Jackson S.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 1028-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The Class I PI3K-Akt axis has key roles in the transduction of survival and/or mitogenic signals from receptor tyrosine kinases and cell adhesion events, including those mediated by the calcium-dependent cadherin molecules (10Carmeliet P. Lampugnani M.G. Moons L. Breviario F. Compernolle V. Bono F. Balconi G. Spagnuolo R. Oostuyse B. Dewerchin M. Zanetti A. Angellilo A. Mattot V. Nuyens D. Lutgens E. Clotman F. de Ruiter M.C.

Akt-dependent protein phosphorylation directly inhibits the activities of the FoxO and BAD pro-apoptotic proteins and promotes cell survival through indirect effects on p53 and NF-κB and via stimulation of glucose metabolism and protein synthesis (13Franke T.F. Hornik C.P. Segev L. Shostak G.A. Sugimoto C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8983-8998Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, 14Downward J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Although murine knock-outs of the p110α and p110β genes result in embryonic lethality, Akt-1 and -2 double knock-out animals die perinatally and display severe atrophy and impaired differentiation of the epidermis, suggesting essential function of these molecules in the tissue homeostasis (15Peng X.D. Xu P.Z. Chen M.L. Hahn-Windgassen A. Skeen J. Jacobs J. Sundararajan D. Chen W.S. Crawford S.E. Coleman K.G. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1352-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Whether Akt proteins have specific roles in differentiation or simply affect cell proliferation still needs to be defined. Class IA PI3Ks are classically activated by tyrosine phosphorylation events, with the lipid kinase being recruited to the cell membrane by interactions of the SH2 domains of the p85 regulatory subunit with tyrosine-phosphorylated YXXM amino acid motifs of receptor tyrosine kinases (16Nolte R.T. Eck M.J. Schlessinger J. Shoelson S.E. Harrison S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 364-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and/or scaffolding proteins, such as IRS1–4 and GAB1–3 (17Wymann M.P. Zvelebil M. Laffargue M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 366-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Potential links between tyrosine kinase signaling and PI3K/Akt activation in the context of epidermal differentiation are suggested by the similar epidermal phenotypes of mice lacking the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), or Akt-1 and -2 (15Peng X.D. Xu P.Z. Chen M.L. Hahn-Windgassen A. Skeen J. Jacobs J. Sundararajan D. Chen W.S. Crawford S.E. Coleman K.G. Hay N.

Nature. 1995; 376: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar), with impaired cell proliferation in the basal layer and differentiation abnormalities in the suprabasal keratinocyte layers. Notably, tyrosine phosphorylation of β- and γ-catenin molecules in complex with E-cadherin is induced during the assembly of cell-cell adhesive structures of differentiating keratinocytes, an event largely dependent on the increased activity of Fyn/Src kinases during this process (19Calautti E. Cabodi S. Stein P.L. Hatzfeld M. Kedersha N. Dotto G.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1449-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The tissue-specific ablation of E-cadherin impairs both the survival and the differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes and mammary epithelial cells, indicating critical roles of this molecule in orchestrating cellular signals favoring both processes in epithelia (20Young P. Boussadia O. Halfter H. Grose R. Berger P. Leone D.P. Robenek H. Charnay P. Kemler R. Suter U. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5723-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 21Tinkle C.L. Lechler T. Pasolli H.A. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). At present, the signals downstream of E-cadherin in this context still await identification. Thus, keratinocytes are endowed with active signaling machinery that may impinge on PI3K/Akt during differentiation; whether the endogenous PI3K/Akt axis is engaged during this process still needs to be established. We show here that the PI3K/Akt pathway is activated early on during differentiation both in cultured keratinocytes and in the epidermis in vivo and that its signaling activity is critical for the survival of differentiating cells and the proper execution of the differentiation program. We provide evidence that in this process the activation of the PI3K pathway relies on a differentiation-specific mechanism that requires both tyrosine kinase activity and the engagement of E-cadherin adhesive functions. Cells, Inhibitors, and Viruses—Primary keratinocytes were isolated from 2–3-day-old C57B mice, cultured in low calcium medium (50 μm CaCl2), and induced to differentiate by raising the calcium concentration to 2.0 mm (high calcium medium) as described previously (22Hennings H. Michael D. Cheng C. Steinert P. Holbrook K. Yuspa S.H. Cell. 1980; 19: 245-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). Genistein and PP1 were from Biomol Research Laboratories. Ly 294002, wortmannin, bisindolylmaleymide, Go6976, and AG1478 were from Calbiochem. The functional inhibition of E-cadherin adhesion molecules was carried out essentially as described previously (11Pece S. Chiariello M. Murga C. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19347-19351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), except with the following modifications: keratinocytes in low calcium medium were pretreated with 0.2 mm EGTA. The monoclonal antibodies DECMA-1 or CH-19 (Sigma) against the E-cadherin ecto- or cytoplasmic domain, respectively, were added to this medium for 20 min. A second dose of antibodies was added, and cells were further incubated in either low or high calcium medium. A replication-defective recombinant adenovirus expressing a myristoylated, active Akt mutant (AdAkt-Myr) was a gift from Dr. K. Walsh (Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA) and has been described previously (23Fujio Y. Guo K. Mano T. Mitsuuchi Y. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5073-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). A replication-defective adenovirus expressing the green fluorescent protein (AdGFP) driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter was used as a control adenovirus. Adenoviruses were amplified and purified and used as described previously (24Calautti E. Grossi M. Mammucari C. Aoyama Y. Pirro M. Ono Y. Li J. Dotto G.P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), at the indicated multiplicity of infection. Antibodies and Immunologic Detection Methods—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against total Akt proteins, Ser473-phosphorylated (active) Akt, Ser21/9-phosphorylated GSK3α/β, Ser256-phosphorylated FKRH (reactive with both FoxO-1 and -4), phosphorylated p85-PI3K binding YXXM motif, and active caspase-3 were from Cell Signaling and Technology. Isoform-specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Akt-1, -2, and -3 were from Upstate Biotechnology. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against E-cadherin, β-catenin, γ-catenin, p120ctn, and phosphotyrosine (Py20) were from BD Biosciences. Anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibodies were from BD Biosciences. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the p85α and the p110α subunits of PI3K, the EGFR, and rabbit and mouse IgG were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the keratinocyte differentiation markers keratin-5, -14, -1 (K5, K14, K1), loricrin, filaggrin, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-K14, anti-K1, and loricrin antibodies were from Babco/Covance. Immunoblotting analysis was performed as described previously (25Saoncella S. Calautti E. Neveu W. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1449-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), except for the cell lysis buffer that was supplemented with 1.75% n-octylglucoside. PI3K and Akt Kinase Assays—Cell extracts (200 μg) were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to p85α or phosphotyrosine (p-Tyr) antibodies, and the PI3K assay was carried out as described previously (26Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated reaction products were separated by thin-layer chromatography by an overnight run in a buffer containing a 34:65:1 (v/v) ratio of H2O, n-propyl alcohol, and glacial acetic acid. Radiolabeled phosphoinositides were visualized by autoradiography. The measurement of total Akt kinase activity was performed with a non-radioactive Akt kinase assay kit from Cell Signaling and Technology, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Substrate phosphorylation was visualized by immunoblotting with phospho-GSK3 (Ser21/9) antibodies. Isoform-specific Akt kinase activity was assessed in presence of [γ-32P]ATP after immunoprecipitation with antibodies to Akt 1, -2, and -3 from 200 μg of protein cell extracts, as described previously (11Pece S.

Immunofluorescence—Primary keratinocytes were processed for immunostaining as described previously (19Calautti E. Cabodi S. Stein P.L. Hatzfeld M. Kedersha N. Dotto G.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1449-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Frozen sections from mouse skin (6-μm thick) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in TBS, 0.3% Triton X-100. Slides were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin, 5% goat serum in TBS-Triton for 30 min; primary antibodies were incubated in TBS-Triton, 3% bovine serum albumin, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Texasred-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.). Slides were analyzed with a Leica TCS NT4D confocal microscope (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany). The lack of bleed-trough between channels in the double labeling experiments was verified experimentally. The PI3K Signaling Pathway Is Activated at the Onset of Keratinocyte Differentiation Both in Vitro and in Vivo—When exposed to high extracellular calcium concentrations, mouse primary keratinocytes withdraw from the cell cycle and undergo morphological and biochemical changes closely recapitulating the epidermal differentiation process in vivo (22Hennings H. Michael D. Cheng C. Steinert P. Holbrook K. Yuspa S.H. Cell. 1980; 19: 245-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). To establish whether the activity of the PI3K pathway is modulated during keratinocyte differentiation, we compared the PI3K and Akt enzymatic activities in proliferating cells and cells induced to differentiate by an increase of the extracellular calcium. The p85α-associated PI3K activity was strongly induced within minutes and further increased up to 1 h of calcium exposure, whereas by 24 h, it diminished to levels similar to those of undifferentiated cells (see Fig. 1A, left panel, and Fig. 2A). Because active Class IA and IIA PI3Ks are often in complex with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (7Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4542) Google Scholar), we also measured the PI3K activity immunoprecipitated by anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies and found a kinetic profile nearly identical to that detected in direct p85α immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1A, right panel). Because both phosphoinositide (PI) 4-monophosphate and PI 4,5-bisphosphate substrates were found increasingly phosphorylated to phosphoinositide 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphoinositide 3,4,5-trisphosphate, respectively, it is likely that the phosphotyrosine-associated PI3K activity induced during differentiation is mostly due to Class IA enzymes, considering that Class IIA isoforms cannot utilize the PI(4,5)P2 substrate (8Foster F.M. Traer C.J. Abraham S.M. Fry M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3037-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). As expected, both the kinase activity and Ser473-phosphorylation of Akt followed closely the profile of PI3K activity (Fig. 1, B and C, and Fig. 2B); among Akt isoforms, Akt-2 and -3 were found preferentially activated during differentiation, whereas Akt1 was only marginally affected (Fig. 1D). Consistently, Akt protein targets such as GSK3α and -β, the FoxO subgroup of forkhead transcription factors, and the MDM2 ubiquitin ligase (13Franke T.F. Hornik C.P. Segev L. Shostak G.A. Sugimoto C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8983-8998Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar) were all found increasingly phosphorylated at their Akt substrate sites during differentiation, as revealed by immunoblotting with the appropriate phosphorylation-specific antibodies (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Phosphorylation of Akt protein targets during keratinocyte differentiation. Total cell lysates obtained from mouse keratinocyte under growing (–) or differentiation condition (Ca++) were assayed for PI3K enzymatic activity after immunoprecipitation (IP) with antibodies to the p85α subunit (PI3K) (A); blotted with an antibody against active Akt (p-Akt, upper panel) or total Akt (lower panel) (B); and blotted with antibodies to the phosphorylated forms of the Akt substrates GSK3α/β (p-GSK3α/β), the forkhead transcription factors FoxO-1 and -4 (p-Foxo-1, p-Foxo-4), and MDM2 (p-MDM2) (C). Loading equivalence was assessed by blotting with antibody to Ras-GAP, the expression of which does not change during mouse keratinocyte differentiation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess whether the changes of PI3K/Akt activity detected in vitro reflect events occurring in the epidermis in vivo, we analyzed both the membrane localization of the p85α subunit, a hallmark of type IA PI3K activation, and the distribution of active Akt in 3-day-old mouse skin. The p85α subunit was preferentially localized at cell-cell contacts of suprabasal differentiating keratinocytes, as indicated by the concomitant expression of the differentiation marker K1 (Fig. 3A). Active Akt was mostly localized in post-mitotic suprabasal cells and in a few basal cells loosely connected to the basement membrane that had initiated movement toward the spinous epidermal layer (Fig. 3B). Double immunofluorescence staining for active Akt coupled to either K14, a proliferative keratinocyte marker (Fig. 3C), or K1, a marker of early keratinocyte differentiation (Fig. 3D), showed that the increase of active Akt coincides with the initial K1 expression and extends up to the granular epidermal layer. In contrast, the majority of K14-positive basal cells were negative for phospho-Akt staining. An increase of active Akt in the differentiated layers of the epidermis was also observed in the adult mouse skin, irrespective of the age of the animal or the stage of the hair cycle (not shown). The PI3K/Akt Pathway Is a Key Determinant of Keratinocyte Differentiation Versus Death—The above results suggest that the PI3K/Akt signaling participates in the control of keratinocyte differentiation and/or suppresses apoptosis that it would otherwise be associated with. Withdrawal from the cell cycle and growth arrest is an intrinsic aspect of the keratinocyte differentiation program. To assess whether the expression of constitutively active Akt is sufficient to affect keratinocyte growth and/or differentiation, we employed an adenoviral vector approach, expressing Akt in a membrane-targeted form (AdAkt-Myr) (23Fujio Y. Guo K. Mano T. Mitsuuchi Y. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5073-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Infection of keratinocytes with this adenovirus caused a dose-dependent decrease of BrdUrd incorporation in both proliferating and differentiating cells compared with cells infected with a GFP-expressing adenovirus (AdGFP) (Fig. 4A), in which BrdUrd uptake was nearly identical to that of uninfected cells (data not shown). To assess whether Akt-induced growth arrest is coupled to increased keratinocyte differentiation, we analyzed the expression of epidermal differentiation markers in uninfected cells and cells infected with either the AdGFP or AdAkt-Myr virus. Cells expressing active Akt displayed higher levels of K1, loricrin, and filaggrin under both proliferating and differentiating conditions; in contrast, levels of K5, a marker of basal keratinocytes constitutively expressed by these cells in culture, remained unaffected (Fig. 4B). To determine whether inhibition of the endogenous PI3K signaling affects keratinocyte differentiation, cells were kept under proliferating and differentiating conditions in the presence of the PI3K pharmacological inhibitors, wortmannin and Ly294002, and analyzed for the expression of differentiation markers. PI3K inhibition caused a significant decrease in the amounts of the late markers, loricrin and filaggrin, and to a lesser extent, those of the early marker K1, whereas K5 expression was not affected (Fig. 5). The effectiveness of PI3K inhibition was confirmed by the decreased levels of active Akt in differentiating cells exposed to the inhibitors (Fig. 5, lower panels). If the PI3K/Akt pathway counteracts pro-cell death activities induced during epidermal cell differentiation (4Gandarillas A. Exp. Gerontol. 2000; 35: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), PI3K inhibition may result in the selective death of differentiating keratinocytes. In fact, 13 and 10% of keratinocytes induced to differentiate for 2.5 h in the presence of wortmannin and Ly294002, respectively, showed morphological features of apoptosis and high levels of active caspase-3, events that were not induced by the inhibitors under proliferating conditions (Fig. 6, A and B). We then asked whether the more pronounced suppression of loricrin and filaggrin expression caused by PI3K inhibition (see Fig. 5) could be related to an increased susceptibility to apoptosis of keratinocytes expressing late differentiation markers. Indeed, in the presence of PI3K inhibitors, more than 75% of differentiating keratinocytes positive for active caspase-3 were also loricrin-positive, whereas only 10% of these cells showed a detectable K1 expression (Fig. 6, C and D). The Activation of the PI3K/Akt Pathway Depends on Both Tyrosine Kinase Activity and E-cadherin Engagement during Keratinocyte Differentiation—E-cadherin plays a pivotal role in keratinocyte cell-cell adhesion and differentiation (27Fuchs E. Raghavan S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) and may mediate survival signals in epithelia (20Young P. Boussadia O. Halfter H. Grose R. Berger P. Leone D.P. Robenek H. Charnay P. Kemler R. Suter U. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5723-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 21Tinkle C.L. Lechler T. Pasolli H.A. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To test whether E-cadherin-dependent cell adhesion is a trigger for PI3K/Akt activation in differentiating keratinocytes, we compared the levels of active Akt in cells that were either treated with an E-cadherin function-blocking antibody, DECMA-1, or a control antibody prior to differentiation induction. The effectiveness of cadherin inhibition was confirmed by the displacement from cell contacts of p120ctn, a protein recruited at the cell membrane via its direct binding to cadherins during cell junction assembly (28Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hummingbird D.K. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7A). Keratinocytes treated with DECMA-1 showed a nearly complete suppression of Akt activation in response to calcium relative to control-treated cells (Fig. 7B); in contrast, these cells retained a normal Akt activation in response to epidermal growth factor stimulation. Notably, functional inhibition of E-cadherin not only blocked the PI3K/Akt pathway but also caused a decreased expression of the keratinocyte differentiation markers, loricrin and filaggrin (Fig. 7C), and increased levels of active caspase-3 and morphological hallmarks of apoptosis (Fig. 7D and data not shown). Because higher levels of active PI3K were associated with phosphotyrosine-containing proteins during differentiation (see Fig. 1A), it was important to verify whether this increased activity depends on tyrosine phosphorylation events induced during this process. With this aim, cells were exposed to an array of protein kinase inhibitors under both proliferating and differentiating conditions, and the level of Ser473-phosphorylated Akt was analyzed as read out of the PI3K pathway activation state. Differentiation-induced Akt phosphorylation was abolished by treatment with the broad specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, and was substantially reduced by both the Src family kinase inhibitor, PP1, and the EGFR-specific inhibitor, tyrphostin AG1478 (Fig. 7E). Importantly, the differentiation-induced increase in active Akt was specifically sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibition, as it was not affected by the treatment of cells with inhibitors of the protein kinase C family of protein kinases, the functions of which are also critical for keratinocyte differentiation (29Dlugosz A.A. Yuspa S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 30Ohba M. Ishino K. Kashiwagi M. Kawabe S. Chida K. Huh N.H. Kuroki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5199-5207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Keratinocyte Differentiation Triggers the Tyrosine Kinase-dependent Association of PI3K with E-cadherin-Catenin Protein Complexes—The above results suggest that the activation of the PI3K pathway may depend on cooperative signals from the EGFR and Src-like tyrosine kinases and the E-cadherin adhesion molecule. Therefore, we tested whether PI3K associates with E-cadherin-catenin complexes during differentiation and whether this association is tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that both the p85α and the p110α PI3K subunits associate with E-cadherin-catenin protein complexes already in growing cells (Fig. 8A, left panel). Upon induction of differentiation, p85α was increasingly associated with E-cadherin and β- and γ-catenins, whereas p110α displayed higher association with γ-catenin. p120ctn, which also associates with E-cadherin during differentiation (19Calautti E. Cabodi S. Stein P.L. Hatzfeld M. Kedersha N. Dotto G.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1449-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), was found increasingly associated with both p85α and p110α; however, the level of p120ctn in complex with p85α was much higher (Fig. 8A, right panel). Small amounts of cadherin-catenin proteins were found associated with p110β, which is also expressed in keratinocytes, but these associations were not regulated during differentiation (data not shown). To assess whether the increased association of p85α with E-cadherinca"

On the basis of successful vaccination of laboratory animals with living irradiated, third-stage hookworm larvae (L3), we examined the antibody responses of individuals from hookworm endemic areas of Brazil and China against the most abundant L3 secreted antigens, the ancylostoma secreted proteins, ASP-1 and ASP-2. Logistic regression was used to investigate the effects of antibody isotype responses to ASPs on the risk of an individual harboring heavy hookworm infection. A significant protective association was observed between increasing anti-ASP-2 IgE levels and the risk of heavy hookworm infection. To confirm that ASP-2 is a protective antigen, laboratory dogs were immunized with recombinant ASP-2 formulated with the GlaxoSmithKline Adjuvant, AS03. Sera obtained from the immunized dogs exhibited high geometric mean antibody titers, immunoprecipitated native ASP-2 from L3 extracts and localized the site of ASP-2 expression to the glandular esophagus and body channels exiting to the cuticle. The sera also exhibited an increased ability to inhibit migration of L3 through tissue in vitro relative to sera from AS03-injected controls. Upon L3 challenge, the ASP-2 vaccinated dogs exhibited significant reductions in fecal egg counts and intestinal hookworm burden. These findings provide strong support for the development of an effective recombinant vaccine against hookworm infection in humans."

BACE is initially synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum as an immature precursor protein (pro-BACE) with a molecular mass of 60 kDa, which then undergoes rapid maturation into a ∼70-kDa form in the Golgi apparatus, involving the addition of complex carbohydrates and the removal of the propeptide domain by furin proteolysis (5Benjannet S.

Eukaryotic cells contain two major systems for protein degradation: the lysosomal apparatus, a membrane-enclosed vacuole containing multiple acid proteases (cathepsins and other hydrolases), and the proteasome, an ATP-dependent proteolytic complex that mostly degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The majority of proteins (80–90%) are degraded by the proteasome (12Pickart C.M. Cell. 2004; 116: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), and most of proteasome substrates are ubiquitinated. The lysosomal apparatus is involved primarily in the degradation of long-lived membrane-associated proteins or extracellular proteins taken up by endocytosis (13Kirschke H. Barrett A.J. Glaumann H.

Mature BACE is a highly stable protein (t½ of 12–16 h) that cycles between the cell surface, the endosomal system, and the trans-Golgi network (TGN) multiple times through the course of its life span (9Huse J.T.

Here, we set out to determine whether BACE is degraded by the lysosomal pathway, and whether the di-leucine motif is necessary for targeting of BACE to lysosomes. Materials—Lactacystin, chloroquine, peptide aldehyde MG132, ALLN, and NH4Cl were obtained from either Sigma or Calbiochem. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against Myc tag (9B11) were obtained from Cell Signaling. The rabbit anti-BACE COOH-terminal antibody was purchased from Affinity Bioreagents. The rabbit antibodies recognizing the proregion of immature BACE (residues 26–45) and the NH2-terminal end of the mature BACE (residues 46–65) were purchased from Calbiochem. The anti-β-tubulin antibody was purchased from Sigma. Texas Red dextran was purchased from Molecular Probes. The anti-β-catenin antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. cDNA Vectors—A human BACE wild type cDNA was cloned into pcDNA4 (Invitrogen) with Myc-His tag fused at the COOH terminus of BACE (BACE WT-Myc). BACE wild type and mutant (BACE-L/A) with V5 tag at the COOH terminus have been already described (16von Arnim C.A. Tangredi M.M. Peltan I.D. Lee B.M. Irizarry M.C. Kinoshita A. Hyman B.T. J.

Cell Culture, Transfection, and Western Blotting—H4 human neuroglioma cells, SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, and CHO cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Primary cortical cultures were established from E16 mouse embryos, as described previously (17Berezovska O. Frosch M. McLean P. Knowles R. Koo E. Kang D. Shen J. Lu F.M. Lux S.E. Tonegawa S.

H4 human neuroglioma cells were transfected with BACE cDNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the supplier's instructions. H4 cells stably expressing BACE-Myc were selected by culturing them in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 200 μg/ml G418. The cells were then washed and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. For Western blot analysis, total proteins (50–100 μg/lane) were separated by NuPage 4–12% BisTris-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Invitrogen) using MES running buffer (Invitrogen) and then blotted on Immun-Blot™ polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Proteins were visualized using the Lumi-GLO™ protein detection kit (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) as described by the manufacturer. Immunocytochemistry—H4 cells expressing the BACE WT-Myc (H4-B) or H4 cells transiently expressing BACE WT-V5 or BACE-LL/AA mutant-V5 cDNA on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100. They were then washed with PBS at room temperature and processed with the appropriate primary antibody diluted in PBS supplemented with 2% goat IgG. BACE WT-Myc was detected with anti-Myc monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. BACE-LL/AA mutant-V5 was detected with anti-V5 monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. Coverslips were washed twice with PBS followed by incubation for 1 h with the indicated combinations of secondary antibodies diluted in PBS supplemented with 2% goat IgG. Following incubation, coverslips were washed twice with PBS, mounted, and subjected to fluorescent microscopic analysis with a Nikon Eclipse TE-300 microscope. Primary antibodies and dilutions were as follows: anti-Myc monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies (Cell signaling), 1:400; anti-EEA1 (BD Transduction Laboratories), 1:500; anti-syntaxin 6 (BD Transduction Laboratories), 1:200; LAMP2 (monoclonal antibody H4B4) (BD Transduction Laboratories), 1:50; anti-V5 polyclonal antibody (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX), 1:200. Alexa 488 (green) and Alexa 594 (red) secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were used at 1:200 dilutions. For dextran internalization, cells cultured on coverslips were incubated with Texas Red-labeled dextran (0.1 mg/ml) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin for 8 h at 37°C and then washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Inhibition of Lysosomal Hydrolases Leads to Increased Levels of Both Ectopically Expressed and Endogenous BACE—Readily available proteasome and lysosomal inhibitors allow a rapid analysis in intact cells of the possible contributions of these two major degradatory pathways (18Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 739-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Chloroquine and NH4Cl are weak bases known to inhibit lysosomal hydrolases by reducing the acidification of the endosomal/lysosomal compartments (19Ohkuma S. Poole B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Inhibitors of the proteasome include: lactacystin, a Streptomyces metabolite, which inhibits the proteasomal degradation of proteins specifically targeting the 20 S proteasome (20Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar); MG132, which is a less specific proteasome inhibitor that has also been shown to inhibit calpain, cathepsin, and γ-secretase (21Skovronsky D.M. Pijak D.S. Doms R.W. Lee V.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 810-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); and ALLN, which inhibits both the proteasome and calpain, as well as acidic cathepsins found in the lysosomes (22Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar). We first determined protein levels of BACE following inhibition of proteasomal or lysosomal degradation in H4 cells stably expressing BACE tagged at the COOH terminus with Myc (H4-B cells). H4-B cells were treated with lactacystin (10 μm), ALLN (50 μm), and lysosomal inhibitors, chloroquine (100 μm) and NH4Cl (50 mm) for 24 h. Both chloroquine and NH4Cl treatments induced a marked increase in BACE protein levels (Fig. 1A). ALLN also increased BACE protein levels in H4-B cells, most likely because of its inhibitory effect on cathepsins, given that the inhibition of the proteasome by lactacystin did not exert any effect. Chloroquine treatment results in an increase of BACE protein levels in a dose-dependent (Fig. 1B) and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). The minimum concentration of chloroquine required was 10 μm, with maximum effect observed on BACE protein levels at 100 μm after 24 h of treatment. We next set out to test whether treatment with lysosomal inhibitors also induces an increase in endogenous BACE. Naïve H4, SH-SY5Y, CHO cells, and primary cortical neurons were treated with lactacystin (10 μm) or MG132 (1 μm), which is a more specific proteasome inhibitor than ALLN (18Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 739-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar), chloroquine (50 μm), or NH4Cl (50 mm) for 24 h. Endogenous BACE was detected by a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against BACE COOH terminus (Affinity Bioreagents). As expected, endogenous BACE protein levels were markedly increased following treatment with either chloroquine or NH4Cl in H4, SH-SY5Y, CHO cells, and primary cortical neurons (Fig. 2 A, B, C, and D, respectively). In contrast, treatment with proteasome inhibitors, lactacystin or MG132, failed to increase endogenous BACE protein levels in cells. Finally, as a positive control for proteasomal degradation, we assessed protein levels of β-catenin, a protein known to be degraded by the proteasome (23Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar), following treatment with proteasomal inhibitors. As expected, treatment with lactacystin or MG132 increased protein levels of β-catenin in primary neuronal cultures (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these findings indicate that endogenous BACE degradation requires the activity of lysosomal hydrolases but not the proteasome in a variety of cell lines including primary neurons. The Inhibition of Lysosomal Hydrolases Leads to Accumulation of Both Mature and Immature BACE—Since chloroquine and NH4Cl treatment resulted in the accumulation of various isoforms of BACE in H4 cells, we next addressed whether they represent mature or immature BACE. H4-B cells were treated with lactacystin, MG132, or NH4Cl for 24 h. Western blot analysis performed with antibodies that specifically detected immature/pro-BACE or mature BACE (anti-BACE26–45 and anti-BACE46–65, respectively), or with a pan-BACECOOH-terminal antibody, revealed that NH4Cl treatment inhibited the degradation of both mature and immature BACE (Fig. 3, A and B). These data suggest that some molecules of pro-BACE likely escape the furin-mediated proteolysis in the Golgi and reach the endosomal/lysosomal apparatus. Inhibition of Lysosomal Hydrolases Does Not Affect Levels of Secreted BACE—It has been previously reported that the extracellular domain of BACE is cleaved and released from the cells in a soluble form (5Benjannet S. Elagoz A. Wickham L. Mamarbachi M. Munzer J.S. Basak A. Lazure C. Cromlish J.A. Sisodia S. Checler F. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10879-10887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Thus, we next tested whether the accumulation of BACE induced by treatment with lysosomal inhibitors was due to inhibition of BACE shedding and/or secretion. Levels of secreted BACE were determined in conditioned media from H4-B cells treated with either proteasomal or lysosomal inhibitors by Western blot analysis with the anti-BACE46–65 antibody. Levels of secreted BACE were similar in the media from treated and untreated cells (Fig. 4). These results rule out the possibility that the accumulation of BACE following treatment with lysosomal inhibitors is due to inhibition of BACE shedding and/or secretion. Treatment with Lysosomal Inhibitors Cause Accumulation of BACE in the Lysosomal Compartments—To determine the cellular compartments where BACE accumulates following inhibition of lysosomal proteases, we carried out immunofluorescence microscopy. It has been previously shown by immunofluorescence microscopy that ectopically expressed BACE is localized primarily in the TGN and the endosomal system (9Huse J.T. Pijak D.S. Leslie G.J. Lee V.M.

Ectopically expressed BACE demonstrated a highly punctuate staining pattern reminiscent of vesicular compartments in H4-B cells (Fig. 5, A, D, and G). Using various subcellular markers, we confirmed that BACE co-localizes with TGN (syntaxin 6), early endosomes (EEA1), and partially with lysosomes (LAMP2) markers in H4-B cells, in agreement with previous studies (9Huse J.T. Pijak D.S. Leslie G.J. Lee V.M. Doms R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33729-33737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 24Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S.

Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3308) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5, A–I). We next set out to determine whether BACE accumulates in the lysosomes following treatment with lysosomal inhibitors. It has been previously shown that dextrans, hydrophilic polysaccharides synthesized by Leuconostoc bacteria, are internalized in cells by fluid-phase endocytosis and delivered through endosomal compartments to the lysosomes, where they accumulate due to their acid hydrolase-resistant nature (19Ohkuma S. Poole B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3327-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar). Dextran accumulates in the lysosomes after 8 h of treatment (28Fujita H. Sasano E. Yasunaga K. Furuta K. Yokota S. Wada I. Himeno M. J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 2001; 6: 19-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, H4-B cells were treated with dextran conjugated with Texas Red (TR-dextran) for 8 h. Ectopically expressed BACE exhibits partial localization with TR-dextran-positive vacuoles, with a pattern similar to the one observed for LAMP2 staining (Fig. 5, J–L). However, both NH4Cl and chloroquine treatment resulted in a dramatic accumulation of BACE in TR-dextran-positive vacuoles (Fig. 5, M–R). These results indicate that BACE accumulates in the lysosomes when lysosomal hydrolases are inhibited. Mutation of the COOH-terminal BACE Di-leucine Sorting Signal Reduces the Accumulation of BACE in the Lysosomes following Inhibition of Lysosomal Hydrolases—Di-leucine-based sorting motifs have been associated with endosomal/lysosomal targeting from the cell surface as well as from the TGN (29Sandoval I.V. Bakke O. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 292-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and upstream acidic residues like aspartic acid have been shown to be necessary for proper functioning of this signal sequence (30Pond L. Kuhn L.A. Teyton L. Schutze M.P. Tainer J.A. Jackson M.R. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19989-19997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the BACE di-leucine motif has been show to impair BACE trafficking to the endosomes resulting in its accumulation at the cell surface (9Huse J.T. Pijak D.S. Leslie G.J. Lee V.M. Doms R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33729-33737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 11Pastorino L. Ikin A.F. Nairn A.C. Pursnani A. Buxbaum J.D. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 19: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the di-leucine motif may play a role in BACE degradation, since BACE-LL/AA mutations increase protein levels of BACE (11Pastorino L. Ikin A.F. Nairn A.C. Pursnani A. Buxbaum J.D. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 19: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, we set out to determine whether the di-leucine motif is necessary for targeting BACE to the lysosomes. H4 cells were transiently transfected with either BACE-WT-V5-tagged or BACE-LL/AA-V5-tagged cDNAs in which Leu499 and Leu500 in the COOH-terminal sequence (DDISLLK) were replaced by alanines (Fig. 6A). Double staining with an anti-V5 and anti-LAMP2 antibody revealed that BACE accumulates in organelles LAMP2 positive following chloroquine treatment (Fig. 6B, panels d–f) with a pattern similar to the one observed following TR-dextran uptake (Fig. 5, M–R). Conversely, the BACE-LL/AA mutant, which is retained at the cell membrane (Fig. 6B, panels g–j), only partially co-localized with LAMP2 following inhibition of lysosomal hydrolases (Fig. 6B, panels j–l). However, following chloroquine treatment, the BACE-LL/AA mutant localizes in LAMP2-negative vesicular organelles. These data were also confirmed in H4 cell stably expressing BACE-LL/AA-V5 (data not shown). Taken together, these observations indicate that the di-leucine motif of BACE is most likely required for intracellular trafficking of BACE to lysosomes where it can be degraded. We have found that lysosomal inhibitors (chloroquine, NH4Cl), but not proteasomal inhibitors (lactacystin, MG132) lead to the accumulation of both endogenous and ectopically expressed BACE in a variety of cell types, including primary cortical neurons. These data are somewhat discrepant but reconcilable with a previous report (15Qing H. Zhou W. Christensen M.A. Sun X. Tong Y. Song W. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1571-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) of an increase in BACE protein levels following treatment with proteasomal inhibitors in SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing BACE. It is not clear from this study that endogenous BACE would normally be degraded by the proteasome. Moreover, in the same study, the authors did not test for the effects of lysosomal inhibitors on BACE degradation. This is a critical control to confirm that the observed effects were actually due to the inhibition of the proteasome as opposed to cathepsins, which are also inhibited by some proteasomal inhibitors (18Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 739-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Employing both a fluid-phase marker (TR-dextran) and LAMP2 staining, we showed that BACE accumulates in late endosomes/lysosomes following inhibition of lysosomal hydrolases. These data indicate that BACE is transported to late endosomal/lysosomal compartments where it can then be degraded via the lysosomal pathway. We also found that mutagenesis of the di-leucine motif in the carboxyl terminus of BACE motif greatly reduces the accumulation of BACE in LAMP2-positive compartments following inhibition of lysosomal hydrolases. These data indicate that the di-leucine motif not only plays a role in BACE endocytosis but also in sorting BACE to the lysosomes. Interestingly, GGA1, -2, and -3 (Golgi-localized γ-ear-containing ARF binding proteins) have been shown to bind the BACE acidic dileucine motif (10He X. Chang W.P. Koelsch G. Tang J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 524: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 31He X. Li F. Chang W.P. Tang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11696-11703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphorylation of serine 498 in BACE appears to increase their binding (10He X. Chang W.P. Koelsch G. Tang J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 524: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 32He X. Zhu G. Koelsch G. Rodgers K.K. Zhang X.C. Tang J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12174-12180Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). GGAs are likely involved in the transport from the Golgi complex to the endosome of proteins containing the DXXLL signal. However, Puertollano et al. (33Puertollano R. Bonifacino J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) have recently reported that RNA interference silencing of GGA3, but not of GGA1 or GGA2, led to the accumulation of epidermal growth factor receptor in enlarged early endosomes because of reduced degradation, while not interfering with the internalization of activated epidermal growth factor receptors from the cell surface. Moreover, it has recently been shown that the down-regulation of GGA1, -2, and, -3 significantly increases the levels of BACE in endosomes and that GGAs may be necessary for BACE transport back to TGN (31He X. Li F. Chang W.P. Tang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11696-11703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 34Wahle T. Prager K. Raffler N. Haass C. Famulok M. Walter J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2005; 29: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These studies suggest the possibility that accumulation of BACE in endosomes could be due to decreased degradation along the lines of the effect of GGA3 down-regulation on epidermal growth factor receptor degradation (33Puertollano R. Bonifacino J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Interestingly, down-regulation of GGA1, -2, and -3 has also been reported to not induce accumulation of BACE at the cell membrane suggesting that the di-leucine motif can also modulate BACE endocytosis independently of GGAs (31He X. Li F. Chang W.P. Tang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11696-11703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Further studies will be necessary to evaluate whether the endosomal/lysosomal sorting of BACE via the di-leucine motif requires interaction with GGA proteins. Lysosomal dysfunction has been linked to a spectrum of degenerative disorders (35Pope A. Nixon R.A. Neurochem. Res. 1984; 9: 291-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), many of which involve nervous system abnormalities and neurodegeneration (36Cuervo A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 70-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Alterations of the endosome/lysosome system have also been previously described in AD (37Nixon R.A. Cataldo A.M. Mathews P.M. Neurochem. Res. 2000; 25: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that BACE and Aβ are enriched in lysosomes-related autophagic vesicles in APP transgenic mouse models (38Yu W.H. Kumar A. Peterhoff C. Shapiro Kulnane L. Uchiyama Y. Lamb B.T. Cuervo A.M. Nixon R.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 2531-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). These authopagic vesicles also accumulate in dystrophic neuritis in AD brains (39Nixon R.A. Wegiel J. Kumar A. Yu W.H. Peterhoff C. Cataldo A. Cuervo A.M. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2005; 64: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). Thus, it is interesting to consider a potential role of the endosomal/lysosomal system with regard to recent reports that BACE levels and β-secretase activity are increased in AD brains (40Holsinger R.M. McLean C.A. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Evin G. Ann. Neurol. 2002; 51: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 41Yang L.B. Lindholm K. Yan R. Citron M. Xia W. Yang X.L. Beach T. Sue L.

Neurol. 2002; 59: 1381-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) and a transgenic mouse model of AD (44Fukumoto H. Rosene D.L. Moss M.B. Raju S. Hyman B.T. Irizarry M.C. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 164: 719-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying these increases remains unresolved; however, in one study, increased expression of BACE was proposed (42Li R. Lindholm K. Yang L.B. Yue X. Citron M. Yan R. Beach T. Sue L. Sabbagh M. Cai H. Wong P. Price D. Shen Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3632-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), while in two other studies, no differences in BACE mRNA levels were observed among AD and control subjects (40Holsinger R.M. McLean C.A. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Evin G. Ann. Neurol. 2002; 51: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 45Marcinkiewicz M. Seidah N.G. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that increased BACE protein levels in AD patients may be partly due to decreased degradation. In this case, our current data would implicate a role for impaired lysosomal degradation as a potential underlying mechanism. Further studies will be necessary to determine the extent to which impairment of lysosomal degradation may contribute to increased BACE protein levels and activity in AD pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1986832618,"Among several candidate Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry channels in sperm, only CatSper1 and CatSper2 are known to have required roles in male fertility. Past work with CatSper1 null sperm indicates that a critical lesion in hyperactivated motility underlies the infertility phenotype and is associated with an absence of depolarization-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup>entry. Here we show that failure of hyperactivation of CatSper2 null sperm similarly correlates with an absence of depolarization evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. Additional shared aspects of the phenotypes of CatSper1 and -2 null sperm include unperturbed regional distributions of conventional voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel proteins and robust acceleration of the flagellar beat by bicarbonate. Further study reveals that treatment of both wild-type and CatSper2 null sperm with procaine increases beat asymmetry, a characteristic of the flagellar waveform of hyperactivation. This partial rescue of the loss-of-hyperactivation phenotype suggests that an absence of CatSper2 precludes hyperactivation by preventing delivery of needed Ca<sup>2+</sup> messenger rather than by preventing flagellar responses to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. CatSper2 null sperm also have an increased basal cAMP content and beat frequency. Protein kinase A inhibitor H89 lowers beat frequency to that of wild-type sperm, suggesting that CatSper2 is required for protein kinase A-mediated, tonic control of resting cAMP content. Relative to wild-type testis, CatSper1 and -2 null testes contain normal amounts of CatSper2 and -1 transcripts, respectively. However, CatSper1 null sperm lack CatSper2 protein and CatSper2 null sperm lack CatSper1 protein. Hence, stable expression of CatSper1 protein requires CatSper2 and <i>vice versa</i>. This co-dependent expression dictates identical loss-of-function sperm phenotypes for CatSper1 and -2 null mutants."

Previously, we have established an embryonic stem cell differentiation system that reproduces early vascular development from progenitor cells that express Flk1, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, by the combinatory application of 2-dimensional culture and flowcytometry. Here we show that cardiomyocytes can be successfully induced from a single Flk1+ cell on 2-dimensional culture, enabling the direct observation of differentiating cardiomyocytes and the prospective identification of cardiac progenitor potentials. Flk1+ cells could give rise to cardiomyocytes, as well as endothelial cells, from a single cell by the co-culture on OP9 stroma cells in a fusion-independent manner. Among the cell populations in intermediate stages from Flk1+ cells to cardiomyocytes, Flk1+/CXCR4+/vascular endothelial cadherin- cells were cardiac-specific progenitors at the single cell level. Noggin, a bone morphogenetic protein inhibitor, abolished cardiomyocyte differentiation by inhibiting the cardiac progenitor induction. However, wnt inhibitors Dkk-1 or Frizzled-8/Fc chimeric protein augmented, but wnt3a inhibited, cardiomyocyte differentiation. In vitro reproduction of cardiomyocyte differentiation process should be a potent tool for the cellular and molecular elucidation of cardiac development, which would provide various targets for cardiac regeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2052757247,"Salt-dependent oligomerization of nucleosomal arrays is related to fiber-fiber interactions and global chromosome structure. Previous studies have shown that the H2A/H2B and H3/H4 N-terminal domain (NTD) pairs are able to mediate array oligomerization. However, because of technical barriers, the function(s) of the individual core histone NTDs have not been investigated. To address this question, all possible combinations of “tailless” nucleosomal arrays were assembled from native and NTD-deleted recombinant Xenopus core histones and tandemly repeated 5 S rDNA. The recombinant arrays were characterized by differential centrifugation over the range of 0–50 mm MgCl2 to determine how each NTD affects salt-dependent oligomerization. Results indicate that all core histone NTDs participate in the oligomerization process and that the NTDs function additively and independently. These observations provide direct biochemical evidence linking all four core histone NTDs to the assembly and maintenance of global chromatin structures.

These observations provide direct biochemical evidence linking all four core histone NTDs to the assembly and maintenance of global chromatin structures. Eukaryotic genomes are partitioned into intricate nucleoprotein assemblages called chromosomes. The fundamental repeating chromosomal unit is the nucleosome, which is composed of 147 bp of DNA wrapped 1.65 times around an octamer of core histones (1Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6926) Google Scholar, 2Luger K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The next organizational level is the chromatin fiber (3Wolffe A. Chromatin: Structure and Function. 3rd. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar). The primary chromatin structure of any given chromosomal region consists of linearly spaced arrays of nucleosomes (nucleosomal arrays) bound to specific structural and/or functional proteins, e.g. linker histones, architectural proteins, transcription factors, and polymerases (4Woodcock C.L.

Nucleosomal arrays lacking other bound proteins undergo two separate salt-dependent condensation transitions in vitro. The most widely studied structural change is folding of the array into a two-start 30 nm diameter chromatin structure, traditionally termed the “30-nm fiber” (3Wolffe A. Chromatin: Structure and Function. 3rd. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar, 4Woodcock C.L. Dimitrov S. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Cell. 2004; 116: 259-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Formation of the 30-nm secondary chromatin structure is the first structural transition that occurs when salts are titrated into a solution of nucleosomal arrays and is mediated by intra-array nucleosome-nucleosome interactions (5Hansen J.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 361-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 8Widom J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 365-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Recent studies using recombinant core mutants have shown that interaction between the H4 N-terminal domain (NTD) 3The abbreviation used is: NTD, N-terminal tail domain. and a surface-exposed H2A region on neighboring nucleosome is required for assembly of folded 30-nm secondary structures (11Dorigo B.

Nucleosomal arrays lacking all core histone NTDs are unable to fold into the 30-nm secondary chromatin structures (14Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausio J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 37285-37290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The second salt-dependent structural transition involves interarray association to form oligomeric tertiary chromatin structures (5Hansen J.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 361-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 9Horn P.J. Peterson C.L. Science. 2002; 297: 1824-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 19Schwarz P.M. Hansen J.C. J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4009-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This transition is reversible, highly cooperative, and occurs independently from array folding (20Schwarz P.M. Felthauser A. Fletcher T.M. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4009-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Oligomerization of short nucleosomal arrays has been hypothesized to reflect long range fiber-fiber interactions that occur in intact chromosomes (5Hansen J.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 361-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 9Horn P.J. Peterson C.L. Science. 2002; 297: 1824-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 20Schwarz P.M. Felthauser A.

Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1996; 6: 149-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). As with intra-array folding, the ability to oligomerize is abolished when the core histone NTDs are removed from the array (16Tse C. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11381-11388Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 20Schwarz P.M. Felthauser A. Fletcher T.M. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4009-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, a detailed characterization of individual NTD function during array oligomerization has not been possible, and the mechanism(s) through which NTDs mediate assembly of oligomeric tertiary chromatin structure is not known. To address these questions, in the present studies, we have characterized the Mg2+-dependent oligomerization of recombinant model nucleosomal arrays containing all 16 possible combinations of core histone NTDs. We have found that each of the NTDs is involved in the oligomerization process, that they function independently of one another, and that their functions are additive. The relevance of these results to core histone NTD function and genome architecture are discussed. 208–12 DNA Purification—208–12 DNA was purified from DH5α cells transformed with the pPOL208–12 plasmid (22Georgel P. Demeler B. Terpening C. Paule M.R. van Holde K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1947-1954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was grown as previously described (19Schwarz P.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16284-16289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell pellet was processed and plasmid DNA was purified using the Qiagen Mega Prep plasmid purification system. Pure plasmid DNA was digested with HhaI as previously described (19Schwarz P.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16284-16289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Georgel P. Demeler B. Terpening C. Paule M.R. van Holde K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1947-1954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HhaI reaction mixture was ethanol-precipitated. The precipitated DNA was rehydrated in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.25 mm EDTA (TE) to a concentration of ∼2 mg/ml and applied to a 2.5 × 90-cm Sephacryl 1000SF (Amersham Biosciences) column. Two ml of the HhaI digest was gently layered onto the column resin bed and the flow rate adjusted to 0.6 ml/min. Fractions (3 ml) were collected beginning 3 h after column loading. Fractions containing pure 208–12 DNA were pooled and precipitated with ethanol. Xenopus Core Histone Expression and Purification—BL21DE3-pLysS cells were transformed with pET plasmids corresponding to the desired core histone as described previously (23Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J.

Histone expression was performed as described in Refs. 24Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar and 25Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, except that full-length histones H2A, H2B, and H3 were expressed for 3 h following induction with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to increase yield. Inclusion body isolation was performed as described previously (24Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar, 25Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), except that the resuspended cell pellets were subjected to 2 thaw/flash-freeze cycles before sonication. Cells were sonicated on ice in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol until the lysate reached a thin homogenous consistency (typically 3–5 sonication cycles, depending upon total cell pellet volume). In some cases, the inclusion bodies were digested with DNaseI. Core histone purification was performed as described previously (24Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar, 25Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), except that after gel filtration, the pooled protein fractions were diluted to 0.2 m NaCl with 7 m urea, 20 mm NaOAc, pH 5.2, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and loaded directly onto a 5-ml HiTrap SP (Amersham Biosciences) ion exchange column (24Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar, 25Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Fractions from the ion exchange column were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to ensure histone integrity and lyophilized prior to use. Histone Octamer Assembly and Purification—Lyophilized histones were dissolved in denaturation buffer (6 m guanidine HCl, 10 mm Tris, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 1 h at room temperature at a concentration of 2 mg/ml. Specific combinations of full-length or tailless (2.1 × 10–6 mol of histones H2A and H2B; 2.0 × 10–6 mol of histones H3 and H4) were combined and the final histone concentration adjusted to ∼1 mg/ml with denaturation buffer. The histone mixture was transferred to Spectra-por dialysis tubing (6000–8000 molecular weight cutoff) and dialyzed against three changes of renaturation buffer (2.2 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 0.25 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The first two dialysis steps were for ∼4 h, and the final dialysis was overnight. The solution of assembled histone octamers was concentrated to 1.5–2.0 ml using a Millipore Centricon concentrator (10,000 molecular weight cutoff). Concentrated octamers were loaded onto a Superdex 200HR HiLoad (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column equilibrated with renaturation buffer as described previously (24Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar, 25Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Fractions were checked for purity and histone composition by SDS-PAGE and/or Triton X-100/acetic acid/urea gel electrophoresis. The fractions that contained equimolar amounts of the four core histones were combined and quantitated as described previously (24Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar, 25Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Octamers were stored at 4 °C in renaturation buffer containing 1 mm aprotinin and leupeptin. Reconstitution of Nucleosomal Arrays—Nucleosomal arrays were reconstituted from 208–12 DNA and purified core histone octamers using salt dialysis as described previously (26Hansen J.C. Lohr D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5840-5848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol was included in all buffers. Briefly, 208–12 DNA and recombinant Xenopus octamers were mixed in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 0.25 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (TEM) buffer containing 2 m NaCl, at a molar ratio of histone octamer:5 S rDNA repeat equal to ∼0.9. The mixtures were dialyzed stepwise as follows: 4 h against TEM/1 m NaCl, 4 h against TEM/0.75 m NaCl, 4 h against TEM/2.5 mm NaCl (TEMN), and overnight against a second change of TEMN. Reconstituted arrays were stored at 4 °C. EcoRI Digestion—Nucleosomal arrays at a DNA concentration of 0.1 mg/ml were digested with 0.5 units/μl EcoRI (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 5 mm. Digested samples were electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel buffered with 45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA at 1 V/cm for 4 h. This gives a sharp 195-bp naked DNA band and a broad peak of nucleosomal fragments. A negative image of the gel was used for densitometry. The percentage of naked DNA in the sample was calculated from the integrated area under the peaks using Scion Image software (16Tse C. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11381-11388Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Sedimentation Velocity—Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed in a Beckman XLA ultracentrifuge equipped with scanner optics as described previously (27Carruthers L.M. Schirf V.R. Demeler B. Hansen J.C. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 321: 66-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Scans were analyzed by the method of van Holde and Weischet (28van Holde K.E. Weischet W.O. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1387-1403Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 29Demeler B. Saber H. Hansen J.C. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 397-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) using Ultrascan data analysis software (Dr. B. Demeler, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX) to obtain the integral distribution of sedimentation coefficients, G(s). Differential Centrifugation—The differential centrifugation assay for self-association was performed as described previously (16Tse C. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11381-11388Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 19Schwarz P.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4009-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Nucleosomal arrays (A260 ∼ 1.2) were mixed with an equal volume of 2× MgCl2 solution to achieve the desired final salt concentration. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at room temperature at 13,000 × g in a microcentrifuge. The percentage of the nucleosomal array sample remaining in the supernatant was calculated as described previously (16Tse C. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11381-11388Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 19Schwarz P.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4009-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To correct for aggregates in a sample, the fraction of material that pelleted in 1.0 mm MgCl2 was subtracted from all data points. This aggregated material generally comprised ≤20% of the samples, consistent with low salt sedimentation velocity analyses. Each data point reflects the mean of 2–5 experiments. Assembly of Matched Nucleosomal Arrays from Full-length and “Tailless” Recombinant Core Histones—The present studies use recombinant model systems to characterize core histone NTD function during cooperative oligomerization of nucleosomal arrays. Full-length and N-terminal truncated (tailless) recombinant Xenopus core histones (23Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Flaus A.J. Waye M.M. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 24Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar, 25Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J.

Brubaker J.M. Cell. 1985; 42: 799-808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) to yield the 16 different types of nucleosomal arrays shown in TABLE ONE. The 5 S DNA template was used, because the salt-dependent condensation of 12-mer 5 S nucleosomal arrays is identical to the behavior of comparable length nucleosomal arrays purified from endogenous sources (14Garcia-Ramirez M.

Open table in a new tab It previously has been shown that the MgCl2 concentration needed to induce oligomerization is sensitive to the degree of 5 S DNA template saturation; subsaturated arrays (<12 histone octamers/template) require higher salt concentrations to achieve equal levels of oligomerization compared with saturated arrays containing 12 histone octamers/template (20Schwarz P.M. Felthauser A. Fletcher T.M. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4009-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Hence, to directly compare their oligomerization properties, it was first necessary to assemble each of the nucleosomal arrays shown in TABLE ONE to the same degree of DNA template saturation. To avoid complications from excess nonspecifically bound histones, we used molar histone: DNA ratios that yielded slightly subsaturated arrays, i.e. ∼10 octamers/template. The histone composition of each of the reconstituted nucleosomal arrays was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). The extent of template loading was determined using two complimentary assays, sedimentation velocity and nuclease digestion (16Tse C. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11381-11388Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 19Schwarz P.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol.

Serwer P. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10859-10863Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The nuclease digestion approach determines the average amounts of unoccupied and nucleosome-occupied 5 S repeats in a sample (16Tse C. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11381-11388Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 19Schwarz P.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol.

Serwer P. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10859-10863Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The expected fraction of free repeats in a sample containing 10 and 11 octamers/12-mer DNA is 17 and 8.5%, respectively. The fraction of free 5 S DNA repeats measured after digestion of the various preparations with EcoRI ranged from 11 to 17% and, within experimental error, was the same for virtually all samples (TABLE ONE). The sedimentation coefficient determined in the analytical ultracentrifuge provides a sensitive measure of the degree of histone octamer saturation of the 208–12 DNA template (16Tse C. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11381-11388Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 19Schwarz P.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol.

Serwer P. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10859-10863Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows the diffusion-corrected sedimentation coefficient distribution, G(s), of each sample in low salt TEN buffer. The wild type arrays sedimented from 19–25 S (save = 23 S), which corresponds to a loading of 9–10 ± 2 histone octamers/DNA (26Hansen J.C. Lohr D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5840-5848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under low salt conditions, the save of 12-mer nucleosomal arrays lacking all their NTDs is ∼4 S lower than native arrays (16Tse C. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11381-11388Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The completely tailless nucleosomal arrays assembled here sedimented from 15–20 S (save = 18 S). The sedimentation coefficients of each of the arrays that lacked only one NTD were virtually identical to the wild type arrays (Fig. 1B, TABLE ONE). The sedimentation coefficients of each of the arrays lacking specific combinations of 2–3 NTDs fell between those of the wild type and completely tailless samples (Fig. 1B, TABLE ONE). The results of the nuclease digestion and sedimentation velocity assays are in very close agreement and indicate that the 16 different nucleosomal arrays shown in Fig. 1A have the matched nucleosome-loading densities needed for accurate comparative oligomerization studies. Oligomerization of Nucleosomal Arrays Containing Single Core Histone NTDs—Nucleosomal array oligomerization is a reversible, cooperative process that requires divalent cations and yet to be defined functions of the core histone NTD(s) (16Tse C. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11381-11388Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 19Schwarz P.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol.

Previous studies indicated that PE may compensate for the lack of CL, and vice versa. These data suggest that PE and CL have overlapping functions and that the absence of both lipids may be lethal. To address this hypothesis, we determined whether the crd1Δ mutant, which lacks CL, was viable in genetic backgrounds in which PE synthesis was genetically blocked. Deletion of the mitochondrial PE pathway gene PSD1 was synthetically lethal with the crd1Δ mutant, whereas deletion of the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum pathway genes PSD2 and DPL1 did not result in synthetic lethality. A 20-fold reduction in phosphatidylcholine did not affect the growth of crd1Δ cells. Supplementation with ethanolamine, which led to increased PE synthesis, or with propanolamine, which led to synthesis of the novel phospholipid phosphatidylpropanolamine, failed to rescue the synthetic lethality of the crd1Δpsd1Δ cells.

Yeast. 1999; 15: 1555-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). CL is a dimeric glycerophospholipid that is synthesized exclusively in mitochondria and plays an important role in oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial membrane biogenesis (3Schlame M. Rua D. Greenberg M.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 257-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). In contrast, PE biosynthesis occurs via multiple pathways (4Birner R. Burgermeister M. Schneiter R. Daum G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). PE is commonly present in all subcellular membranes, although PE levels are highest in the mitochondrial membrane (2Tuller G. Nemec T. Hrastnik C. Daum G. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1555-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). PE and CL have similar physical properties in that they have a propensity toward the formation of nonbilayer, inverted hexagonal (HII) phase structures (5Cullis P.R. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 513: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 6Vasilenko I. De Kruijff B. Verkleij A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 684: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The local, transient formation of nonbilayer structures is thought to play an important role in vital cellular processes, such as vesicle formation, vesicle-mediated protein trafficking, and membrane fusion (7de Kruijff B. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 564-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, nonbilayer lipids affect integration of proteins into the membrane, their lateral movement within the membrane, and the function and folding of certain integral membrane proteins (8van den Brink-van der Laan E.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, phospholipid biosynthesis is compartmentalized in various subcellular organelles, including the Golgi body, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria (Fig. 1). CL biosynthesis occurs in three steps, all catalyzed by enzymes present in the mitochondria. The first step, catalyzed by phosphatidylglycerol phosphate (PGP) synthase, is the synthesis of PGP from CDP-diacylglycerol and glycerol 3-phosphate. PGP phosphatase dephosphorylates PGP to phosphatidylglycerol. In the final step, CL synthase catalyzes the formation of CL from phosphatidylglycerol and CDP-diacylglycerol (9Tamai K.T. Greenberg M.L.

The biosynthesis of aminoglycerophospholipids occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, vacuole/Golgi body, and mitochondrial compartments (Fig. 1). PE biosynthesis is accomplished by two de novo pathways involving decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine (PS) by PS decarboxylase, including Psd1p-catalyzed PE synthesis in mitochondria and Psd2p-catalyzed PE formation in the vacuole/Golgi body (16Trotter P.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6071-6080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In addition, PE can be synthesized from ethanolamine (Etn) via the Kennedy pathway (Fig. 1). The Kennedy pathway is also linked to sphingolipid catabolism through a reaction catalyzed by dihydrosphingosine phosphate lyase (Dpl1p). This enzyme cleaves the phosphorylated sphingoid base to a long chain aldehyde and ethanolamine phosphate (18Saba J.D. Nara F. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26087-26090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), which is then incorporated into PE via the Kennedy pathway (19Mandala S.M. Thornton R. Tu Z. Kurtz M.B. Nickels J. Broach J. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The presence of CL and PE biosynthetic machinery in mitochondria suggests that these phospholipids are required for mitochondrial function. Several published studies are consistent with the possibility that CL and PE have redundant functions and that each can compensate for the loss of the other. The growth phenotype of crd1Δ cells, which lack CL synthase and CL, is characterized by temperature sensitivity at 37 °C, reduced growth in nonfermentable media, and increased frequency of petite formation (20Jiang F. Ryan M.T. Schlame M. Zhao M. Gu Z. Klingenberg M. Pfanner N. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22387-22394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Depletion of PE in psd1Δ cells produces a similar phenotype (16Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21416-21424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Escherichia coli AD93 strain, which lacks PE, has increased levels of CL (21Rietveld A.G. Killian J.A. Dowhan W. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12427-12433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the absence of CL in yeast crd1Δ mutant cells results in increased PE (22Zhong Q. Gohil V.M. Ma L. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32294-32300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The null mutants pgs1Δ, crd1Δ, psd1Δ, psd2Δ, pem1Δ, pem2Δ, and dpl1Δ are viable in complex and synthetic media in the absence of external supplementation with Etn or choline, consistent with the redundancy of phospholipid functions in S. cerevisiae. Based on the observed similarities in the phenotypes of crd1Δ and psd1Δ cells, the physical properties of PE and CL, and the compensatory increases of PE in CL-deficient mutants and CL in PE-deficient mutants, we hypothesized that cells lacking both PE and CL are inviable. In support of this hypothesis, we determined that crd1Δ is synthetically lethal with psd1Δ but not with mutants in the nonmitochondrial pathways for PE synthesis. Supplementation with ethanolamine or propanolamine failed to rescue the lethality of the crd1Δpsd1Δ double mutant. These data indicate that the combined loss of synthesis of CL and PE from mitochondria is lethal to yeast cells. Glucose, yeast extract, and peptone were purchased from Difco.

Yeast Strains and Growth Media—The yeast S. cerevisiae strains and plasmids used in this work are listed in TABLE ONE. Yeast strains were grown aerobically at 30 °C. Complex medium (YPD) contained yeast extract (1% w/v), peptone (2% w/v), and glucose (2% w/v). Complete synthetic medium (CSM) and sporulation medium were prepared as described (23Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2548) Google Scholar). Etn and Prn were prepared as 0.5 m stocks (pH 6–7) that were filter-sterilized. The expression of V5-tagged Crd1p was induced from pYES6/CRD1 by growth in YP induction (YPI) medium, which contained raffinose (1%) and galactose (2%) as carbon sources. The crd1Δ cells transformed with pYES6 plasmids were grown in the presence of 50 μg/ml blasticidin to prevent loss of the plasmids. Liquid cultures were inoculated to an A550 of 0.1 from precultures grown to the stationary phase unless otherwise indicated.TABLE ONEYeast strains and plasmids used in this studyStrains/PlasmidsGenotype/CharacteristicsSource/ReferenceBY4741 (WT)MAT a, his 301, leu 200, met 1500, ura 300InvitrogenBY4742 (WT)MAT α, his 301, leu 200, lys 200, ura 300InvitrogenVGY1 (BY4742 crd1Δ)MAT α, his 301, leu 200, lys 200, ura 300, crd1Δ::URA3This studyBY4741 psd1ΔMAT a, his 301, leu 200, met 1500, ura 300, psd1Δ::KanMX4InvitrogenBY4741 psd2ΔMAT a, his 301, leu 200, met 1500, ura 300, psd2Δ::KanMX4InvitrogenBY4741 dpl1ΔMAT a, his 301, leu 200, met 1500, ura 300, dpl1Δ::KanMX4InvitrogenBY4741 pem1ΔMAT a, his 301, leu 200, met 1500, ura 300, pem1Δ::KanMX4InvitrogenBY4741 pem2ΔMAT a, his 301, leu 200, met 1500, ura 300, pem2Δ::KanMX4InvitrogenVGY2 (crd1Δ psd2Δ)MAT a, his 301, leu 200, lys 200, ura 300, crd1Δ::URA3, psd2Δ::KanMX4This studyVGY3 (crd1Δ dpl1Δ)MAT a, his 301, leu 200, met 1500, ura 300, crd1Δ::URA3, dpl1Δ::KanMX4This studyVGY4 (crd1Δ pem1Δ)MAT a, his 301, leu 200, met 1500, ura 300, crd1Δ::URA3, pem1Δ::KanMX4This studyVGY5 (crd1Δ pem2Δ)MAT a, his 301, leu 200, met 1500, ura 300, crd1Δ::URA3, pem2Δ::KanMX4This studypYES6/CTS. cerevisiae expression vector derived from the parental pYES2 vectorInvitrogenpYES6/CRD1pYES6 derivative vector containing CRD1 geneQ. He Open table in a new tab Construction of Deletion Strains and Plasmid—The crd1Δ deletion was generated by homologous recombination in the BY4742 wild-type strain via transformation with a linearized pUC19′ plasmid containing a crd1Δ::URA3 disruption sequence (13Jiang F. Rizavi H.S. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on Ura- plates. The crd1Δ::URA3 disruption was confirmed by PCR, Southern blot analysis, and phospholipid profile of the transformants. The primers for PCR were forward primer (5′-AAAAGCTTCTGGTAGCATAGTTTGGTCC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-ACGGATCCTGATGATATTGCATTCAGCCG-3′) (13Jiang F. Rizavi H.S. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Yeast deletion strains including BY4741 psd1Δ::KanMX4, BY4741 psd2Δ::KanMX4, BY4741 dpl1Δ::KanMX4, BY4741 pem1Δ::KanMX4, and BY4741 pem2Δ::KanMX4 were obtained from the yeast deletion collection (Invitrogen). The genotypes of these strains were confirmed by growth phenotypes and phospholipid profiles. Double mutant strains were created by sporulation of the diploids followed by tetrad dissection on either YPD medium or glucose-containing CSM medium with 2 mm or 20 mm Prn or Etn supplementation. The identities of all viable double mutant strains were also confirmed by their genotypes and characterization of their phospholipid profiles. The pYES6/CRD1 plasmid was constructed by inserting the CRD1 open reading frame sequence into pYES6/CT at the BamHI/XbaI site, upstream of the V5 tag and downstream from the GAL1 promoter. Primers were designed based on the SGD CRD1 gene sequence: forward primer (5′-AATTGGATCCATGATTCAAATGGTGCCC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CTTTTCTAGAAGGATCGCAATTATACAATT-3′). Restriction endonuclease sites BamHI and XbaI as indicated by the underlines, were added to the forward and reverse primers to facilitate subsequent DNA manipulations. The CRD1 stop codon was deleted in the reverse primer. The insertion was confirmed by sequencing, and functionality of V5-tagged Crd1p was checked by transforming the crd1Δ mutant with the pYES6/CRD1 plasmid. Growth of crd1Δ + pYES6/CRD1 in inducing conditions resulted in expression of the Crd1-V5 protein, which is ∼30 kDa in size. V5-tagged Crd1p was enriched in mitochondria and restored wild-type CL levels in the CL-deficient crd1Δ mutant. Steady State Total Cellular Phospholipid Determination—Phospholipid extraction, separation, and quantification were carried out as described (24Vaden D.L. Gohil V.M. Gu Z. Greenberg M.L. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 338: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown at 30 °C in YPD or CSM media from a starting A550 of 0.1. Immediately after inoculation, cultures were supplemented with 10 μCi 32P ml-1 and allowed to grow for several generations to achieve steady state labeling. For Etn and Prn incorporation experiments, YPD or CSM medium was supplemented with either 2 or 20 mm Etn or Prn prior to inoculation. Radiolabeled phospholipids were separated by one-dimensional TLC (24Vaden D.L. Gohil V.M. Gu Z. Greenberg M.L. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 338: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) or two-dimensional TLC (25Storey M.K. Clay K.L. Kutateladze T. Murphy R.C. Overduin M. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48539-48548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). 32P in individual phospholipids was visualized by phosphorimaging and quantified by ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Incorporation of radiolabel (32P) into individual phospholipid is expressed as a percentage of radiolabel incorporated into total phospholipids. Mitochondrial Phospholipid Determination—Cells were grown in CSM in the absence or presence of 2 mm Prn. Mitochondria were isolated from 5–6 g of cell pellet as described by Daum et al. (26Daum G. Bohni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total mitochondrial phospholipids were extracted and purified as described (27Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated total phospholipids were applied to silica gel 60 plates and separated by two-dimensional TLC (25Storey M.K. Clay K.L. Kutateladze T. Murphy R.C. Overduin M. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48539-48548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The developed TLC plates were dried and exposed to iodine vapor to visualize phospholipid spots. Western Blot Analyses—Protein extraction was carried out as per the Invitrogen product manual. The extraction buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protein inhibitor mixture at the concentration of 1 tablet/10 ml of buffer. Protein quantification was carried out using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Protein extracts (50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE using precast (4–20%) gradient polyacrylamide gels. Protein from the separating gel was electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated with the monoclonal anti-V5 antibodies (1:3000 dilution; Invitrogen) and then washed and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibodies. The protein bands were detected using a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate-nitro blue tetrazolium color development kit. Other Procedures—Standard molecular techniques were used in this study. Plasmid purification from E. coli was performed using the Wizard Miniprep DNA Purification system. Transformations of E. coli cells were performed using a BTX electroporation system. Yeast transformations were carried out by the lithium acetate method (28Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2903) Google Scholar). The crd1Δ and psd1Δ Mutants Are Synthetically Lethal—To test the hypothesis that crd1Δ and psd1Δ are synthetically lethal, we constructed a crd1Δ::URA3 strain in MATα background and mated it with a MATa psd1Δ::KanMX4 strain. The resulting heterozygous diploids were sporulated, and meiotic tetrad analysis was carried out. In 63 tetrads dissected, 54 tetrads contained less than four viable spores, and no viable crd1Δpsd1Δ spores (Ura+KanR) were recovered (TABLE TWO), indicating that the crd1Δpsd1Δ double mutant is synthetically lethal. The lethality was not due to defective spore germination, since microscopic analysis indicated that tiny colonies of no more than a few hundred cells formed from the spores that were deduced to be crd1Δpsd1Δ (not shown). In order to demonstrate a conditional synthetic lethal relationship in the crd1Δpsd1Δ double mutant, the heterozygous diploid BY4741/2 (CRD1/crd1Δ::URA3 PSD1/psd1Δ::KanMX4) was transformed with the pYES6/CRD1 plasmid, from which the expression of V5-tagged CRD1 is controlled by the GAL1 promoter, and meiotic tetrad analysis of the sporulated diploid was carried out. We chose the pYES6/CT expression system, because it allowed controlled expression of epitope-tagged Crd1p, and thus growth phenotype could be correlated with expression of the Crd1p protein. Viable crd1Δpsd1Δ spores were recovered on YPI medium in which Crd1p is induced (TABLE TWO). These cells exhibited normal growth on YPI (Fig. 2A) and reduced, but discernible, growth on YPD (Fig. 2B). Growth on YPD medium could be attributed to low level expression of Crd1-V5 from the leaky GAL1 promoter (Fig. 2C), which was sufficient to synthesize almost 70% of wild-type levels of CL (Fig. 2D). However, the growth phenotype in liquid YPD medium of the crd1Δpsd1Δ cells containing the pYES6/CRD1 plasmid was similar to crd1Δpsd1Δ cells containing the plasmid that were cultured in liquid YPI medium (Fig. 2E). Phenotypic differences between culturing in solid or liquid medium have been previously observed in the psd1Δ and crd1Δ mutants. The temperature-sensitive phenotype of psd1Δ cells is apparent at 37 °C in liquid medium but is not observed in solid medium at 37 °C (25Storey M.K. Clay K.L. Kutateladze T. Murphy R.C. Overduin M.

Burgermeister M. Schneiter R. Daum G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), it can be synthesized in significant amounts via multiple nonmitochondrial pathways. This was confirmed by analysis of the total cellular phospholipid composition of psd2Δ and dpl1Δ mutants in YPD and CSM. Phospholipid extraction was carried out from cells grown to the late logarithmic phase in glucose-containing medium in order to simulate the growth conditions of spores obtained from tetrad dissection on glucose-containing medium. As shown in TABLES THREE and FOUR, the decrease in total PE levels in psd2Δ cells was similar to the decrease in PE observed in psd1Δ cells, suggesting that the decrease in cellular PE per se does not result in inviability of the crd1Δpsd1Δ cells. This was confirmed by the recovery of viable crd1Δpsd2Δ colonies (TABLE TWO). The dpl1Δ mutation resulted in only a minor decrease in PE (TABLE FOUR), and crd1Δdpl1Δ double mutants were also recovered (TABLE TWO). Mitochondrial membranes are highly enriched in PC, comprising almost 40% of total mitochondrial phospholipids (2Tuller G. Nemec T. Hrastnik C. Daum G.

We wished to determine whether synthetic lethality of crd1Δpsd1Δ could be rescued by increasing the concentration of Etn or Prn, which rescue the temperature sensitivity of psd1Δ cells. Steady-state phospholipid analysis of psd1Δ cells in YPD medium showed that PE is not significantly increased with Etn supplementation, even at a concentration of 20 mm (Fig. 4A). Similarly, there was minimal synthesis of phosphatidylpropanolamine upon Prn supplementation in YPD medium (Fig. 4A). However, consistent with the findings of Storey et al. (25Storey M.K. Clay K.L.

Prn supplementation resulted in the synthesis of phosphatidylpropanolamine, comprising up to 30% of total phospholipid levels (Fig. 4B). The synthesis of PE and phosphatidylpropanolamine upon Etn and Prn supplementation occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum. To determine whether these phospholipids could be imported into mitochondria of mutant cells, we analyzed the phospholipid composition of mitochondria from cells grown in the presence of Prn. Consistent with the findings of Storey et al. (25Storey M.K. Clay K.L. Kutateladze T. Murphy R.C. Overduin M. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48539-48548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we observed the presence of phosphatidylpropanolamine in crd1Δ and psd1Δ mitochondria (data not shown). However, crd1Δpsd1Δ colonies could not be recovered on medium supplemented with either Etn or Prn (TABLE FIVE). The tiny colonies from spores deduced to be crd1Δpsd1Δ did not have a greater number of cells than those germinated in the absence of Etn and Prn (data not shown). These results clearly demonstrate that the absence of both mitochondrial PE and CL biosynthesis is lethal.TABLE FIVESupplementation of Etn and Prn does not rescue synthetic lethality of crd1Δpsd1Δ cells The BY4741/2 (CRD1/crd1Δ::URA3 PSD1/psd1Δ::KanMX4) heterozygous diploid was pregrown with the indicated supplementation.

Disruption of nonmitochondrial pathways of PE biosynthesis in crd1Δ cells did not result in synthetic lethality. Increasing cellular PE and synthesis of phosphatidylpropanolamine also did not rescue the synthetic lethality of the crd1Δpsd1Δ double mutant. These data indicate that cells cannot survive if synthesis of both PE and CL in the mitochondria is eliminated. This suggests that CL and PE have overlapping functions in the mitochondria and that loss of both is lethal. The reduction in total cellular PE per se was not responsible for synthetic lethality in the crd1Δ background, since the decrease in total cellular PE in psd2Δ cells was similar to the decrease observed in psd1Δ cells (TABLES THREE and FOUR). Up to a 20-fold decrease in PC, the most abundant mitochondrial phospholipid, due to a mutation in PEM2 (TABLE THREE), did not result in synthetic lethality, as evidenced by the recovery of viable crd1Δpem2Δ colonies (TABLE TWO). Consistent with the specific requirement of PE in the crd1Δ background, we observed severely diminished growth of the crd1Δpsd2Δ mutant in CSM compared with double mutants of the PC pathway (Fig. 3). These results pointed to a specific requirement for either mitochondrial PE biosynthesis or the mitochondrial PE biosynthetic enzyme Psd1p for the viability of CL-deficient cells. The presence of Psd1p itself in mitochondria may not be sufficient to allow survival of crd1Δ cells, since Janitor et al. (30Janitor M. Obernauerova M. Kohlwein S.D. Subik J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 140: 43-47PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that disruption of the CHO1 gene in the CL-deficient pgs1Δ background results in synthetic lethality. Cho1p catalyzes the synthesis of PS, which is the substrate for Psd1p. Therefore, the absence of PS results in an inability to synthesize mitochondrial PE via Psd1p. Thus, pgs1Δ and cho1Δ are synthetically lethal despite the presence of Psd1p. It is well documented that in the yeast S. cerevisiae, mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration is triggered in nonfermentable medium or in late logarithmic growth phase of cells grown in glucose-containing (fermentable) medium. The CRD1 gene expression, CL biosynthesis, and CL levels are higher in nonfermentable medium and upon entering the stationary growth phase in glucose-containing medium (29Jiang F. Gu Z. Granger J.M.

Daum G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). These results point to the requirement of CL and PE for respiratory functions. Thus, our results showing crd1Δpsd1Δ synthetic lethality in fermentable medium are surprising. This suggests that continuous synthesis of mitochondrial PE or CL is required for essential processes other than mitochondrial respiration. A recent report has shown that Psd1p is the major source of mitochondrial PE (33Burgermeister M. Birner-Grunberger R. Nebauer R. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1686: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The same authors also observed a small but significant level of import of microsomal PE into mitochondria. Others (25Storey M.K. Clay K.L. Kutateladze T. Murphy R.C. Overduin M. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48539-48548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) have shown that Etn supplementation could rescue the temperature-sensitive phenotype of psd1Δ cells, consistent with import of PE into the mitochondria. Thus, we tried to rescue the crd1Δpsd1Δ synthetic lethality by increasing PE levels via Etn supplementation. However, a 2-fold increase in PE due to Etn supplementation (Fig. 4B) failed to rescue the crd1Δpsd1Δ synthetic lethal phenotype. Phosphatidylpropanolamine, a novel phospholipid not normally present in yeast, rescues the growth defects of PE-deficient psd1Δ and psd1Δpsd2Δ cells and has been shown to efficiently incorporate into mitochondrial membranes (25Storey M.K.

However, we did not recover viable crd1Δpsd1Δ cells even under conditions in which phosphatidylpropanolamine formed 30% of total phospholipids (Fig. 4B). The possibility that import of phosphatidylpropanolamine may be defective in CL-deficient mitochondria was ruled out, since we observed a significant amount of phosphatidylpropanolamine in crd1Δ and psd1Δ mitochondria (data not shown), suggesting that CL is not essential for the mitochondrial import of nonbilayer phospholipids. Taken together, these data indicate that mitochondrial synthesis of PE is critical for survival of crd1Δ cells. What function of Psd1p-synthesized PE is required in the absence of CL? One of the most likely roles of PE is to meet a requirement for nonbilayer formation in the inner mitochondrial membrane in the absence of CL. Whereas externally synthesized PE or phosphatidylpropanolamine (data not shown) can be transported to mitochondria, these nonbilayer phospholipids may not be transported efficiently to the inner mitochondrial membrane to compensate for the lack of both PE and CL, and thus supplementation does not rescue the synthetic lethality of crd1Δpsd1Δ cells. In support of this hypothesis, Burgemeister et al. (33Burgermeister M. Birner-Grunberger R. Nebauer R. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1686: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) reported a 3-fold reduction in inner mitochondrial membrane PE levels in the psd1Δ mutant as compared with wild type cells, indicating that PE synthesized in the microsomes or via Psd2p catalysis was not efficiently incorporated into the inner mitochondrial membrane. Previous studies in E. coli have shown that bacteria need a critical amount of nonbilayer-forming phospholipid for survival (21Rietveld A.G. Killian J.A. Dowhan W. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12427-12433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation is supported by the recent report showing that incorporation of a foreign nonbilayer-forming glycolipid, α-monoglucosyldiacylglycerol, restores cellular function in PE-deficient E. coli cells (35Wikstrom M. Xie J. Bogdanov M. Mileykovskaya E. Heacock P. Wieslander A. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10484-10493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). PE is also required for the formation of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins (4Birner R. Burgermeister M. Schneiter R. Daum G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 36Menon A.K. Stevens V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15277-15280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which play an essential role in cell viability by maintaining structural integrity of the cell wall. A recent report from our laboratory indicated an important role of CL and its precursor, phosphatidylglycerol, in maintaining cell wall integrity (37Zhong Q. Gvozdenovic-Jeremic J. Webster P. Zhou J. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we speculated that loss of viability of crd1Δpsd1Δ cells could be the result of compromised cell wall stability. However, 1 m sorbitol, which rescues the growth defects of the pgs1Δ mutant by stabilizing the cell wall, did not rescue the lethality of crd1Δpsd1Δ (data not shown), indicating that synthetic lethality is not due to loss of cell wall integrity. Genetic screens designed to identify suppressors of crd1Δpsd1Δ synthetic lethality, currently in progress, will elucidate the potential function(s) of mitochondrial nonbilayer phospholipids. The large scale synthetic lethal screen of Tong et al. (38Tong A.H. Lesage G. Bader G.D. Ding H. Xu H. Xin X. Young J. Berriz G.F. Brost R.L. Chang M. Chen Y. Cheng X. Chua G. Friesen H.

However, their work provided the framework to identify synthetic lethal interactions between genes of interest. Their study indicated a high likelihood of synthetic lethal interactions between genes with the same mutant phenotypes and subcellular localization. Identification of a synthetic lethal interaction between crd1Δ and psd1Δ in this study supports their prediction. We are grateful to Dr. John M. Lopes for useful suggestions.

https://openalex.org/W2120855525,"Since mammalian skin expresses the enzymatic apparatus for melatonin synthesis, it may be an extrapineal site of melatonin synthesis. However, evidence is still lacking that this is really the case in situ. Here, we demonstrate melatonin-like immunoreactivity (IR) in the outer root sheath (ORS) of mouse and human hair follicles (HFs), which corresponds to melatonin, as shown by radioimmunoassay and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The melatonin concentration in organ-cultured mouse skin, mouse vibrissae follicles, and human scalp HFs far exceeds the respective melatonin serum level and is significantly increased ex vivo by stimulation with norepinephrine (NE), the key stimulus for pineal melatonin synthesis. By real-time PCR, transcripts for the melatonin membrane receptor MT2 and for the nuclear mediator of melatonin signaling, retinoid orphan receptor alpha (ROR)alpha, are detectable in murine back skin. Transcript levels for these receptors fluctuate in a hair cycle-dependent manner, and are maximal during apoptosis-driven HF regression (catagen). Melatonin may play a role in hair cycle regulation, since its receptors (MT2 and RORalpha) are expressed in murine skin in a hair cycle-dependent manner, and because it inhibits keratinocyte apoptosis and down-regulates ERalpha expression. Therefore, the HF is both, a prominent extrapineal melatonin source, and an important peripheral melatonin target tissue. Regulated intrafollicular melatonin synthesis and signaling may play a previously unrecognized role in the endogenous controls of hair growth, for example, by modulating keratinocyte apoptosis during catagen and by desensitizing the HF to estrogen signaling. As a prototypic neuroectodermal-mesodermal interaction model, the HF can be exploited for dissecting the obscure role of melatonin in such interactions in peripheral tissues."

Biol. 1998; 72: 87-144PubMed Google Scholar). This has been substantiated recently by the availability of the three-dimensional structure of the Bacillus subtilis PDX2 protein (YaaE), although in the absence of ligands (20Bauer J.A. Bennett E.M.

Moreover, 15N-labeling studies in yeast had indicated that the nitrogen atom of pyridoxine is derived from the amide moiety of glutamine (9Tazuya K. Adachi Y. Masuda K. Yamada K. Kumaoka H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1244: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 10Tanaka K. Tazuya K. Yamada K. Kumaoka H. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 2000; 46: 55-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), whereas in the E. coli pathway it is derived from glutamate (10Tanaka K. Tazuya K. Yamada K. Kumaoka H. J. Nutr. Sci.

Indeed, glutaminase activity has since been demonstrated for the PDX2 proteins of B. subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Plasmodium falciparum (22Belitsky B.R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1191-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 23Dong Y.X. Sueda S. Nikawa J. Kondo H. Eur. J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 5242-5248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), designated YaaE (PdxT), SNO1, and PDX2, respectively. However, glutaminase activity was only observed in the presence of PDX1, which was shown to co-purify with PDX2, forming a hetero-oligomeric complex as has been observed for other glutamine amidotransferases (22Belitsky B.R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1191-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 23Dong Y.X. Sueda S. Nikawa J. Kondo H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In general, glutamine amidotransferases consist of two domains, a glutaminase domain, which hydrolyzes glutamine to glutamate and ammonia, and a synthase domain that accepts and utilizes the ammonia from the glutaminase domain (19Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 87-144PubMed Google Scholar). It was, therefore, postulated that PDX1 is likely to be the synthase subunit of the glutamine amidotransferase hetero-oligomeric complex (22Belitsky B.R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1191-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 23Dong Y.X. Sueda S. Nikawa J. Kondo H. Eur. J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 5242-5248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), but the nature of the substrates in the synthase reaction remained unknown. Nonetheless, extensive labeling studies in yeast had established that the origin of the C5-chain C-2′,2,3,4,4′ of pyridoxamine is derived from an intact glucose-derived pentulose and/or pentose intermediate rather than deoxy-d -xylulose s-phosphate as in E. coli (25Gupta R.N. Hemscheidt T. Sayer B.G. Spenser I.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 11353-11359Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and more recently a genetic study in yeast indicated that the five-carbon sugar might be ribulose 5-phosphate (26Kondo H. Nakamura Y. Dong Y.X. Nikawa J. Sueda S. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 65-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the identity of the remaining triose sugar remained elusive (12Zeidler J. Gupta R.N. Sayer B.G. Spenser I.D. J. Org. Chem. 2003; 68: 3486-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). While this report was in preparation, enzymatic synthesis of vitamin B6 was demonstrated (27Burns K.E. Xiang Y. Kinsland C.L. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 3682-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) using either of the C5 sugars, ribose 5-phosphate or ribulose 5-phosphate, and either of the C3 sugars, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate or dihydroxyacetone phosphate, in the presence of glutamine and the PDX1 and PDX2 homologs from B. subtilis (YaaD and YaaE, respectively), but sufficient proof of the identity of the reaction product was not provided. We have independently been able to reconstitute vitamin B6 biosynthesis with the B. subtilis proteins and herein report on the identity of the reaction product as pyridoxal 5′-phosphate. A detailed biochemical characterization of the B. subtilis YaaD and YaaE proteins in their native form is described, which shows that both the glutaminase and synthase activities are dependent on the respective protein partner when the physiological nitrogen donor glutamine is utilized. Vitamin B6 synthesis can be accomplished in vitro with an alternative source of ammonia. However, when ribulose 5-phosphate is used as the C5 sugar under these conditions, the reaction is dependent on YaaE. Furthermore, an in depth characterization of the inhibition of the glutaminase subunit and thus PLP synthesis by the naturally occurring antimicrobial compound acivicin ((αS,5S)-α-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazole acetic acid) (28Chittur S.V. Klem T.J. Shafer C.M. Davisson V.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 876-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), a heterocyclic analog of glutamine, is provided. Most significantly, we show that in the presence of the inhibitor YaaD is no longer associated with YaaE. The nature of the interaction of YaaD and YaaE is discussed in light of the findings. Materials—Acivicin and bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase were purchased from Sigma; sinapic acid, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, and sequencing grade-modified trypsin were from Promega. Cloning and Expression of B. subtilis YaaD/YaaE—The DNA sequence of the YaaD and YaaE genes of B. subtilis strain 168 were obtained from SubtiList (genolist.pasteur.fr/SubtiList/). Genomic DNA was isolated from B. subtilis strain 168 as described previously (29Fitzpatrick T.B. Amrhein N. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19891-19897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The YaaD and YaaE genes were amplified by PCR (YaaD:5′-primer, CATGCCATGGCTCAAACAGGTACTGAACG, 3′-primer, CGGAATTCCTACCAGCCGCGTTCTTGCATACGC; YaaE:5′-primer, GGAATTCCATATGTTAACAATAGGTGTACTAGGAC, 3′-primer, CCGCTCGAGCTATACAAGTGCCTTTTGCTTATATTCC or CCGCTCGAGTACAAGTGCCTTTTGCTTATATTCC, i.e. with or without stop codon), using the isolated genomic DNA as template, and cloned into the NcoI/EcoRI (YaaD) and NdeI/XhoI (YaaE) restriction sites of pET21a or pET24b (Novagen), to give plasmids pET-BsYaaD, pET-BsYaaE, and pET-BsYaaE-His6, respectively. Cloning into the vector in this way allows expression of the proteins in their native form and in the case of YaaE without and with a C-terminal hexahistidine affinity tag. Each expression construct was verified by sequence analysis after transformation into E. coli DH5α cells (Stratagene). Induction of expression was carried out in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-d -galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm and growth at 37 °C for 3 h after which the cells were harvested by centrifugation and subsequently stored at –80 °C. Purification of YaaD and YaaE—YaaD was isolated by a combination of anion exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Cell paste from 4 liters of culture medium (∼20 g) was resuspended in 50 ml of Buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 1.3 mm EDTA, 1.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5). Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, and after 20 min at 4 °C the cells were further lysed by sonication. DNase I (0.1 mg/ml) was used to help clarify the resulting suspension, which was then centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was defined as the crude extract and loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column (2.5 × 15 cm), freshly equilibrated in Buffer A. After extensive washing with Buffer A, bound protein was eluted using a linear gradient of 250 ml each of Buffer A and Buffer B (as for A except containing 300 mm NaCl) while collecting 7-ml fractions. The YaaD-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer A overnight. The dialysate was brought to 30% ammonium sulfate saturation and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column (2.5 × 15 cm) freshly equilibrated in Buffer C (as for Buffer A but containing 0.75 m ammonium sulfate). After washing, bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 250 ml each of Buffer C and Buffer A. Fractions containing YaaD were pooled, concentrated, exchanged into 20 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, and stored at –80 °C until required. Native YaaE was isolated in exactly the same fashion as for YaaD with the following exception. Hydroxyapatite chromatography was substituted for the phenyl-Sepharose step. After DEAE-Sephacel chromatography, YaaE-containing fractions were dialyzed overnight in Buffer D (5 mm potassium phosphate, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5). The dialysate was applied to a hydroxyapatite column (2.5 × 18 cm) freshly equilibrated in the same buffer. After extensive washing bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 250 ml each of Buffer D and Buffer E (as for Buffer D but containing 150 mm potassium phosphate). Fractions containing YaaE were pooled, concentrated into 20 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, and stored at –80 °C until required for use. The hexahistidine-tagged YaaE was purified by Ni-NTA chromatography according to the protocol (protocol 11) supplied by the manufacturer (Qiagen). The isolated YaaD and YaaE were judged to have a purity of >95% as analyzed by SDS-PAGE using the buffer system described by Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar) (provided as supplemental data), and their identities were confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. Coupled Enzyme Assay—YaaE activity was determined via a coupled reaction with glutamate dehydrogenase. In this assay, glutamine is hydrolyzed by YaaE to glutamate which is converted to α-ketoglutarate by glutamate dehydrogenase accompanied by the reduction of 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide (APAD), an analog of NAD+ that shifts the unfavorable equilibrium of the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction. Its reduction can be observed as an increase in the absorbance at 363 nm (ϵAPAD = 8300 m–1·cm–1). Samples were assayed at 37 °C in a total reaction volume of 300 μl containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm APAD, 7 units of bovine glutamate dehydrogenase (assay buffer), and 10 mm glutamine. For determination of the kinetic constants, 4 μm YaaD and 4 μm YaaE were used. Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford reagent (Pierce) employing bovine serum albumin as a standard. Determination of YaaD Enzymatic Activity—The activity of YaaD was monitored by UV-visible spectrophotometry where the appearance of a maximum at 414 nm indicated enzymatic formation of a Schiff's base, presumably formed by the generated reaction product and the primary amine of the Tris buffer (2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol) used in the assay. Reactions were carried out in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, at 37 °C containing 40 μm of the isolated YaaD and/or YaaE and 0.5 mm of the substrates; either ribose 5-phosphate or ribulose 5-phosphate and either dihydroxyacetone phosphate or dl-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (1 mm). As a nitrogen source either 10 mm glutamine or 10 mm ammonium sulfate was added. UV-visible Absorbance Spectrophotometry—All spectrophotometric measurements were recorded on a UVIKON XL double-beam spectro-photometer (Flowspek AG, Basel, Switzerland). HPLC of the Reaction Product—For analysis of the reaction product by HPLC, samples were first deproteinated by ultrafiltration followed by methanol-chloroform precipitation. The deproteinated sample was then applied to a C18 reversed phase column (LiChroCART 250–4, RP-18, 5 μm, Merck) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid using the Beckman System Gold apparatus. Comparison with commercially available standards was performed by employing isocratic elution (1 ml ·min–1 for 10 min) followed by a gradient of 0–50% acetonitrile. In the case where the reaction product was required on a preparative scale, the product from a total volume of 8 ml was deproteinized as above and isocratically eluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid on a LiChroCART RP-18 column (Merck 250–10, 5 μm, flow rate 6 ml·min–1). NMR Analysis—The 1H NMR spectrum was recorded in 0.7 ml of D2O in 5-mm diameter tubes on a 600-MHz instrument (Bruker DRX600 Ultra Shield) using a 5-s acquisition time, 256 scans, and a relaxation delay of 0.01 s. Electrospray Mass Spectrometry—The mass spectra were recorded in 70% acetonitrile containing 0.1% tetraethylammonium using a flow rate of 20 μl·min–1, a capillary voltage of 3 kV, and a cone voltage of 20 V on a Quattro Micro API™ instrument (Waters). Inactivation by Acivicin—The rate of inactivation of YaaE was determined by preincubation of equimolar concentrations of YaaD and YaaE (4 μm) in assay buffer (as above) with varying concentrations of the inhibitor (1, 2, and 10 mm) at 37 °C. At various time intervals, the glutaminase activity was measured by addition of 30 μlofa0.1 m glutamine stock solution to give a total reaction volume of 300 μl. The time course of the fraction of catalytic activity remaining showed a pseudo-first-order decay from which the rate constant k was obtained by a fit of the data to the exponential function (Equation 1) (31Miles B.W. Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Raushel F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4368-4373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). f=e-kt(Eq. 1) The plots of the pseudo-first-order rate constants versus the initial acivicin concentration yielded second-order rate constants for the inactivation of YaaE. For the demonstration of the inactivation of PLP synthesis, YaaD (40 μm) and YaaE (40 μm) were incubated with various amounts of acivicin (0.04–5 mm) in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 60 min; PLP formation was monitored at 414 nm in the presence of 0.5 mm ribose 5-phosphate, 0.5 mm dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and either 10 mm glutamine or ammonium sulfate. Labeling YaaE with Acivicin—Time- and concentration-dependent modification of YaaE with acivicin was carried out at 37 °C in 60 μl of 10 mm ammonium hydrogen carbonate, pH 7.9, containing 40 μm YaaD and 40 μm YaaE. The reaction was started by addition of acivicin to a final concentration of 1 mm.5-μl aliquots were removed at various time points, and the reaction stopped by addition of 5 μl of acetonitrile containing 0.4% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v). Samples were directly spotted onto a MALDI-plate and mixed with an equal volume of sinapic acid (10 mg/ml) dissolved in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The samples were allowed to air dry. Spectra were acquired with a MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (4700 Proteomics Analyzer, Applied Biosystems) in the positive ion mode. The percentage of labeling of YaaE with acivicin was calculated from the intensities of the peaks corresponding to the unmodified and modified protein. The second order rate constants for the reaction of YaaE with acivicin in the absence and presence of 1 and 10 mm glutamine were calculated by plotting the ln([acivicin]/[YaaE]) versus time and applying linear regression to the data using Equation 2. lncacivicincYaaE=(cacivicin0-cYaaE0)·k2·t+lncacivicin0cYaaE0(Eq. 2) Identification of the Residue Labeled by Acivicin—To identify the site of acivicin modification, 60 μm YaaE was incubated in the presence of 60 μm YaaD with 5 mm acivicin in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, in a total reaction volume of 100 μl for 15 min at 37 °C. Labeled YaaE was separated from YaaD by size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 10/300 (Amersham Biosciences) gel-filtration column mounted on an ÄKTA Explorer system (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl. The injection volume was 100 μl, and the flow rate was set to 0.5 ml/min. The fraction corresponding to YaaE was collected, concentrated using filter units (Centricon YM30, Millipore), and dialyzed for 24 h against 50 mm ammonium hydrogen carbonate. YaaE was subjected to protease digestion by addition of 1 μg of trypsin and incubation for 24 h at 37 °C. The digested protein was applied to an HPLC system (Ti-Series 1050, Hewlett-Packard) equipped with a C18 reversed phase column (Nucleosil 300–5 C18, Macherey-Nagel), equilibrated in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v). A gradient of 0–60% acetonitrile/0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) at 0.5 ml/min was established over 45 min, held for 5 min, raised to 80% acetonitrile/0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) over 5 min, and then returned to the starting conditions over 15 min. The elution was monitored at 215 nm, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The fractions were dried in a SpeedVac concentrator and resuspended in 66% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) for analysis by MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS. A sample of 0.5 μl was mixed with 0.5 μl of 5 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid dissolved in 66% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) and directly spotted onto a MALDI-plate. For MS/MS, the peptide was selected and fragmented by collision-induced fragmentation using helium as the collision gas. Native PAGE—Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out in 12.5% gels using the system described by Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar) under non-denaturing conditions, i.e. in the absence of SDS and reducing agent at 4 °C. YaaD (20 μm) and YaaE (20 μm) were incubated either separately or together in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. Acivicin when present was at a concentration of 1 mm. The samples were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 30 μl prior to addition of 30 μl of two times native PAGE sample loading buffer. Thirty picomoles of protein was loaded per lane. Generation of Antiserum/Immunochemical Methods—An antibody against YaaE was raised and utilized at a dilution of 1:1000 essentially as described in (29Fitzpatrick T.B. Amrhein N. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19891-19897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) with the exception that in the present study PAGE analysis under non-denaturing conditions was carried out. YaaE Pull-out Assay—Equimolar concentrations (20 μm) of the isolated native YaaD and hexahistidine-tagged YaaE were preincubated in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm NaCl (Buffer A) at 37 °C for 15 min in a total volume of 50 μl. The proteins were immobilized by adding 50 μl of a 1:1 suspension of Ni-NTA equilibrated in the same buffer followed by incubation at 4 °C for 90 min with gentle rotation. Protein bound to the matrix was washed two times with 1 ml of Buffer A followed by elution with the same buffer containing 150 mm imidazole and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Enzymatic Properties of YaaE—The isolation of native YaaE in its active form was demonstrated by employing a coupled glutaminase assay. Glutamate released during the course of the reaction facilitates the reduction of the NAD+ analog, 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide (APAD), in the presence of glutamate dehydrogenase and can be detected as an increase in the absorbance at 363 nm. Glutaminase activity of YaaE was only detected in the presence of its partner protein YaaD. In the presence of either protein alone the rate of glutamine hydrolysis did not exceed the background autocatalytic rate. Thus, under the conditions employed here, glutaminase activity of YaaE alone is ≤0.5% of that in the presence of both proteins. A 1:1 stoichiometry of both proteins appeared to be optimal for activity. Varying the concentration of glutamine in the assay produced typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, from which we could determine the catalytic constants, kcat and Km (7.60 ± 0.01 min–1 and 0.99 ± 0.01 mm, respectively). These results are provided as supplemental data. Identification of YaaD Substrates—Based on labeling (12Zeidler J. Gupta R.N. Sayer B.G. Spenser I.D. J. Org.

J. 2004; 379: 65-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), potential substrates of YaaD were considered and tested for their ability to form vitamin B6 in the presence of YaaE and glutamine in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0. Employing the pentulose sugar ribulose 5-phosphate and either of the triose sugars glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate or dihydroxyacetone phosphate, enzymatic activity could be observed by the appearance of an absorbance maximum at 414 nm. This absorbance is characteristic for pyridoxal 5′-phosphate forming a Schiff's base with the Tris buffer reagent (2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol) used in the reaction. While this report was in preparation, the same observations were independently published by the group of T"
https://openalex.org/W2022571650,"Naturally derived, nontoxic peptides from protamine by the authors, termed low molecular weight protamines (LMWPs), possess high arginine content and carry significant sequence similarity to that of TAT, by far the most potent protein transduction domain peptide. Therefore, it was hypothesized that these LMWPs would also inherit the similar translocation activity across the cell membrane, which enables any impermeable species to be transduced into the cells. LMWPs were prepared by enzymatic digestion of protamine, examined their capability of transducing an impermeable protein toxin into the tumor cells by chemical conjugation, and determined cytotoxicity of transduced protein toxin (e.g., gelonin) against cancer cell lines and a tumor-bearing mouse. In vitro results showed that LMWPs could indeed translocate themselves into several mammalian cell lines as efficiently as TAT, thereby transducing impermeable gelonin into the cells by chemical conjugation. In vivo studies further confirmed that LMWP could carry an impermeable gelonin across the tumor mass and subsequently inhibit the tumor growth. In conclusion, the presence of equivalent cell translocation potency, absence of toxicity of peptide itself, and the suitability for low-cost production by simple enzymatic digestion could expand the range of clinical applications of LMWPs, including medical imaging and gene/protein therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2050642108,"Many of the virulence determinants of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are lipids and glycolipids of the cell envelope. Now at last a mechanism that controls cell envelope composition — and in vivo pathogenesis — has been uncovered. It is regulated intramembrane proteolysis, a type of lipid regulation also used by mammals and bacteria. RIP may be an attractive pathway to target for development of new antituberculosis antibiotics. Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is a continuing global health crisis that kills 2 million people each year1. Although the structurally diverse lipids of the M. tuberculosis cell envelope each have non-redundant roles in virulence or persistence2,3,4,5,6,7, the molecular mechanisms regulating cell envelope composition in M. tuberculosis are undefined. In higher eukaryotes, membrane composition is controlled by site two protease (S2P)-mediated cleavage of sterol regulatory element binding proteins8,9, membrane-bound transcription factors that control lipid biosynthesis. S2P is the founding member of a widely distributed family of membrane metalloproteases10,11 that cleave substrate proteins within transmembrane segments12. Here we show that a previously uncharacterized M. tuberculosis S2P homologue (Rv2869c) regulates M. tuberculosis cell envelope composition, growth in vivo and persistence in vivo. These results establish that regulated intramembrane proteolysis is a conserved mechanism controlling membrane composition in prokaryotes and show that this proteolysis is a proximal regulator of cell envelope virulence determinants in M. tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2038152798,"Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) have recently been demonstrated to be required for the in vivo activity of several chemokines. Minimally, the interaction is thought to provide a mechanism for retention at the site of secretion and the formation of chemokine gradients that provide directional cues for receptor bearing cells, particularly in the presence of shear forces. Thus, a key issue will be to determine the sequence and structure of the GAGs that bind to specific chemokines. Herein, we describe a mass spectrometry assay that was developed to detect protein-oligosaccharide noncovalent complexes, in this case chemokine-GAG interactions, and to select for high affinity GAGs. The process is facilitated by the ability of electrospray ionization to transfer the intact noncovalent complexes from solution into the gas phase. The elemental composition as well as the binding stoichiometry can be calculated from the mass of the complex. Ligands of the chemokine receptor, CCR2 (MCP-1/CCL2, MCP-2/CCL8, MCP-3/CCL7, MCP-4/CCL13, and Eotaxin/CCL11), and the CCR10 ligand CTACK/CCL27 were screened against a small, highly sulfated, heparin oligosaccharide library with limited structural variation. The results revealed heparin octasaccharides with 11 and 12 sulfates as binders. Oligomerization of some chemokines was observed upon GAG binding, whereas in other instances only the monomeric noncovalent complex was identified. The results indicate that, in contrast to the apparent redundancy in the chemokine system, where several chemokines bind and activate the same receptor, these chemokines could be differentiated into two groups based on the stoichiometry of their complexes with the heparin oligosaccharides.

Some specific chemokine receptors provide the portals by which human immunodeficiency virus gets into cells, whereas others have been implicated in inflammatory diseases associated with inappropriate cell migration (rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, atherosclerosis, and most recently, tumor metastasis) (1Rossi D. Zlotnik A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 217-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (2090) Google Scholar, 2Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar). Thus there is considerable interest in understanding how chemokines function, and in identifying strategies that interfere with their function.Based on the pattern of the cysteine residues, chemokines can be divided into CXC, CC, C, and CX3C families. Once secreted, chemokines are thought to form a concentration gradient that controls the direction of the leukocyte cell migration. This process is mediated by the interactions between the chemokines and G protein-coupled seven transmembrane receptors on leukocytes; the binding event subsequently triggers downstream signaling pathways that lead to cell migration and activation (3Proudfoot A.E.I. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 106-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Approximately 45 chemokines and 19 chemokine receptors have been identified to date. Characterization of which chemokines interact with which receptors has revealed significant cross-reactivity (e.g. redundancy) in vitro; in other words multiple chemokines bind and activate the same receptor, and a given chemokine can bind multiple receptors. Nevertheless this apparent redundancy may not exist in vivo; for example, significant effects in models of inflammation have been observed using knock-out mice, or antibodies and small molecule antagonists, despite the fact that they target single receptors or chemokines (4Power C.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 273: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 5Proudfoot A.E.I. Power C.A. Rommel C. Wells T.N.C. Semin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). An emerging hypothesis is that glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) 2The abbreviations used are: GAG, glycosaminoglycan; AUC, analytical ultracentrifugation; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; FTICR, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance; ESI, electrospray ionization; SPE, solid-phase extraction; CCR, CC chemokine receptor; WT, wild type; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; MS, mass spectrometry.2The abbreviations used are: GAG, glycosaminoglycan; AUC, analytical ultracentrifugation; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; FTICR, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance; ESI, electrospray ionization; SPE, solid-phase extraction; CCR, CC chemokine receptor; WT, wild type; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; MS, mass spectrometry. play a role in the in vivo function of chemokines (6Kuschert G.S.V.

Sweeney M. Proudfoot A.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 385-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar).GAGs are linear, highly sulfated, and heterogeneous polysaccharides that are often covalently linked to core proteins residing on the membrane of cells or within the extracellular matrix. They have been classified into several major families, primarily heparin/heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate, hyaluronan, and keratan sulfate (11Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 12Linhardt R.J. Toida T. Acc. Chem.

Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2293) Google Scholar). Although they are ubiquitously expressed on virtually all animal cells, the exact composition of the GAG coat of a given cell/extracellular matrix depends on the type and location of the cell and the pathophysiological state of the tissue/organism (14Kato M. Wang H.M. Bernfield M. Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18881-18890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GAGs are thought to influence the local cytokine network through interactions with proteins and by modulating protein-protein interactions (15Delehedde M. Lyon M. Gallagher J.T. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 235-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and there is accumulating evidence for specificity in these interactions. For example, the sulfation pattern on GAGs is thought to be a major determinant in their interaction with proteins, which are often highly basic (16Bourin M.C. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 313-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 17Tully S.E. Mabon R. Gama C.I. Tsai S.M. Liu X.W. Hsieh-Wilson L.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 7736-7737Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Chemokines have been shown to bind GAGs both in vitro and in vivo, and recently it was demonstrated that this interaction is required for their function in vivo (19Proudfoot A.E.I. Handel T.M. Johnson Z. Lau E.K. LiWang P. Clark-Lewis I. Borlat F. Wells T.N.C. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 20Johnson Z.

Immunol. 2004; 173: 5776-5785Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Immobilization of chemokines on GAGs is thought to enhance their local concentration and facilitate the formation of chemokine gradients to guide the migration of cells, especially under flow conditions (19Proudfoot A.E.I. Handel T.M. Johnson Z. Lau E.K. LiWang P. Clark-Lewis I. Borlat F. Wells T.N.C. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Page C. Wells T.N.C. Proudfoot A.E.I. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 5776-5785Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). GAG binding may also help recruit chemokines to specific populations of cells, thereby contributing to the control of cell migration in a receptor independent way.Oligomerization has also been shown to be required for some chemokines as oligomerization-deficient mutants that function like wild type (WT) in vitro, have been shown to be nonfunctional in vivo (19Proudfoot A.E.I. Handel T.M. Johnson Z. Lau E.K. LiWang P. Clark-Lewis I. Borlat F. Wells T.N.C. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this requirement seems to be coupled to GAG binding, because GAGs can induce some chemokines to oligomerize (19Proudfoot A.E.I. Handel T.M. Johnson Z. Lau E.K. LiWang P. Clark-Lewis I. Borlat F. Wells T.N.C. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 21Lau E.K. Paavola C.D. Johnson Z. Gaudry J.P. Geretti E.

Thus, there are several sources where specificity in chemokine-GAG interactions may be derived: (i) the actual GAG-binding epitopes on the chemokines, and indeed, GAG-binding hotspots have been defined for several chemokines and show significant differences in their patterns (21Lau E.K. Paavola C.D. Johnson Z. Gaudry J.P. Geretti E. Borlat F. Kungl A.J. Proudfoot A.E. Handel T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22294-22305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), (ii) the oligomerization state that the chemokines adopt, and again differences have been reported (10Handel T.M. Johnson Z. Crown S.E. Lau E.K. Sweeney M. Proudfoot A.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 385-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 19Proudfoot A.E.I. Handel T.M. Johnson Z. Lau E.K. LiWang P.

Chem. 2004; 279: 22294-22305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and (iii) the sequence of the GAGs, for which much less is known due to the difficulties in isolating and sequencing GAGs. If the argument for specificity is accurate, then the GAG interaction may significantly contribute to the localization of cells beyond that defined at the level of the chemokine-receptor interaction. The GAG interaction may, in fact, specify the use of one chemokine over another. Targeting chemokine-GAG interactions with tight binding GAG sequences or GAG mimetics that either block the interaction or compete for chemokine-receptor binding in vivo, could also form the basis of novel therapeutics. Along these lines, the objectives of this study are to develop methods for selecting and sequencing GAG ligands of a given chemokine, to determine the extent of their sequence diversity, and to establish if the “redundant” chemokines can be distinguished by their GAG-binding properties.The characterization of chemokine-GAG interactions has been greatly facilitated by the development of reasonably efficient screening and detection techniques (22Powell A.K.

Venkataraman G. Shriver Z. Sasisekharan R. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, there are still many limitations, and the resulting data have been somewhat nebulous. Affinity chromatography methods are slow and require considerable amounts of material (22Powell A.K. Yates E.A. Fernig D.G. Turnbull J.E. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 17R-30RCrossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), whereas oligosaccharide microarrays generally need pure and structurally defined oligosaccharides that are chemically synthesized or isolated from natural sources (25Feizi T. Chai W.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 582-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In this report, a mass spectrometry approach was used to identify specific GAGs that bind to the chemokine ligands of CCR2. The assay is a label-free methodology that does not require chemical modification or immobilization of the protein target or the library components. The binding stoichiometry as well as the molecular formula of the oligosaccharide binders can be calculated from the masses of the protein/oligosaccharide noncovalent complex using electrospray ionization-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (ESI-FTICR) mass spectrometry. This is possible given the fact that many structural features, including stoichiometry, ligand binding domain, and even tertiary geometry of solution noncovalent complexes can be preserved during the transition from solution to gas phase (27Sobott F. Robinson C.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 28Loo J.A. Mass Spectrom.

Confirmation of the complexed oligosaccharides detected in the noncovalent complex was verified using hydrophobic trapping and elution. Identified oligosaccharides binders were spatially separated from the protein, collected, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Specific GAG ligands were unambiguously determined by measuring the molecular mass of each ligand from a library of possible binders.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The heparin octasaccharide library was obtained from Dextra Laboratories (Reading, UK) and consists of a partial heparinase I digestion of heparin purified from porcine intestinal mucosa. The catalogue number for this library is ID1008. Sucrose octasulfate was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada). Thrombin and cyclodextrin sulfate were purchased from Sigma. Enterokinase was expressed and purified as described previously (32Lu D.S. Futterer K. Korolev S. Zheng X.L. Tan K. Waksman G. Sadler J.E. J. Mol.

Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 494-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Each gene was then cloned into modified versions of pET21, which include one or all of the following: a leader sequence for increased expression, a His tag for purification, and an enterokinase or thrombin protease site for removal of the tag (TABLE ONE).TABLE ONEExpression conditions of the chemokinesProteinN-terminal sequence addedProteaseRatio (w:w)Cleavage timeCCL7MH8D4KEnterokinase1:25048 h at room temperatureCCL8MK3D4KEnterokinase1:10048 h at room temperatureCCL11MGSSH6ENLYLVPRThrombin1:100072 h at room temperatureCCL13MK3H8Aminopeptidase1:50120 h at room temperature Open table in a new tab MCP-1/CCL2 WT and CCL2 R18A/K19A/R24A were expressed and purified as described before (21Lau E.K.

Both of these proteins have an additional mutation (M64I) to avoid oxidation during purification but show no effect on receptor-binding function (34Hemmerich S. Paavola C. Bloom A. Bhakta S.

After lyophilization, the protein was resuspended in 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2 at 1 mg/ml and mixed with a 1:100 w/w ratio of enterokinase. After 48 h, the protein was acidified by addition of trifluoroacetic acid to pH 2–4 and purified by reverse-phase HPLC. Eluted CCL8 was lyophilized and stored at –20 °C.CCL7-producing cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm MgCl2 and clarified by centrifugation. The supernatant was applied to a Ni-NTA (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) column at room temperature. After washing with 20 mm imidazole, the protein was eluted with 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole. The eluate was then purified by reverse-phase HPLC, cleaved with a 1:250 w/w ratio of enterokinase for 48 h, and repurified as above.CCL11-producing cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 400 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole and purified on a Ni-NTA column as above. Eluate was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2. Thrombin was added at a ratio of 1:1000 w/w. After 72 h, the protein was purified by reverse-phase HPLC and lyophilized as above.The CCL13 construct was transformed into BL21(DE3) pLysS cells that were then grown in LB at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.600. The cells were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and harvested after 4 h by centrifugation. The cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm MgCl2, and the insoluble protein was isolated by standard methods. The final pellet was resuspended in 6 m guanidine-HCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 10 mm imidazole. The extract was clarified before application to a Ni-NTA column. The protein was eluted with 6 m guanidine-HCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 250 mm imidazole. Refolding was initiated by dropwise dilution into 55 mm Tris, pH 8, 264 mm NaCl, 11 mm KCl, 0.055% polyethylene glycol 3350, 1.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol to a final protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. Refolded protein was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, then against 35 mm Tris, pH 8. Aminopeptidase was added at a 1:50 w/w ratio. After 120 h, cleaved protein was purified by reverse-phase HPLC and lyophilized as above.Exact Mass Measurement of the Heparin Octasaccharide Library Components—The heparin octasaccharide library was analyzed by ESI-FTICR mass spectrometry using negative ion mode detection. Approximately 20 μm of the library was sprayed in a solvent containing 50:50 MeOH:H2O with 10 mm NH4OH. Addition of NH4OH or NH4OAc is known to prevent desulfation (35Saad O.M. Leary J.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. 2004; 15: 1274-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Samples were infused into the mass spectrometer at 1 μl/min using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). For exact mass determination, the octasaccharide library sample was mixed with a HPLC peptide standard mixture (Sigma), which was used as an internal calibrant. This mixture was comprised of leucine enkephalin (1–, m/z 554.2615), angiotensin II (2–, m/z 521.7594), and Val-Tyr-Val (1–, m/z 378.2029).

Open table in a new tab Filtration Trapping Screening Assay—For screening experiments, 40 μm of the target protein was mixed with 200 μm octasaccharide library in 100 μl of 100 mm NH4OAc (pH 6.8) at room temperature. To remove the nonspecific/low affinity binders, the protein-oligosaccharide mixture was washed three times with 1 ml of 200 mm NH4OAc (pH 6.8), and subjected each time to centrifugal ultrafiltration (5000 rpm, 40 min, 4 °C) using a molecular mass cutoff filter of 10 kDa (Millipore, Billerica, MA). After the last wash step, the solution was concentrated to ∼50 μl. The retentate was diluted by addition of 1 volume of water and subjected to FTICR mass spectrometric analysis.Hydrophobic Trapping, Elution, and Confirmation of Bound Ligands—Forty micromolar of the target protein was incubated with 200 μm octasaccharide library in 100 μl of a 100 mm NH4OAc solution (pH 6.8). The solution was then applied to an Oasis solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA) that was previously conditioned according to the manufacturer's instructions. The nonspecific binders were removed by flushing the column three times, each with 1 ml of a 200 mm NH4OAc solution. The high affinity ligands were eluted by using 1 ml of a 760 mm NH4OAc solution. The eluate was desalted by dialyzing against water in a Bio-dialyzer unit with a molecular mass cutoff of 1 kDa (The Nest Group, Southborough, MA) and analyzed by FTICR mass spectrometry using negative ion mode detection.FTICR Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectra were acquired on a Bruker APEX II 7-tesla FTICR mass spectrometer (Billerica, MA) equipped with an Apollo (Bruker, Billerica, MA) electrospray ionization (ESI) source. Generation of the noncovalent complex ions was performed as previously described (30Yu Y. Kirkup C.E. Pi N. Leary J.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2004; 15: 1400-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were infused into the mass spectrometer at 1 μl/min using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). Ions were desolvated in the nozzle-skimmer region by using a 140-V (positive mode) or 40-V (negative mode) capillary exit voltage. Following desolvation, ions were externally accumulated in a radio frequency-only hexapole for 0.5–1 s and were transferred into the ICR cell for mass analysis. Two to four ion packets were trapped using gated trapping and detected after chirp excitation. Between 8 and 100 broadband time domain transients containing 512 k or 1024 k data points were averaged before zerofill, Gaussian multiplication and fast Fourier transform. The parameters of the ESI source, ion optics, and cell were tuned for the best ion intensity. The FTICR mass spectra were internally calibrated against myoglobin or MCP-1. All the data were acquired and processed using Xmass version 6.0.0 (Bruker).The average masses of the noncovalent complexes of MCP-1 dimer and oligosaccharide ligand were determined by using the method as previously reported by Zubarev et al. (36Zubarev R.A. Demirev P.A. Hakansson P. Sundqvist B.U.R. Anal. Chem. 1995; 67: 3793-3798Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, portions of the isotopic distribution above 50% relative intensity of the highest isotopic peak were used to calculate the average mass, Mave(P/L)′, of the protein-ligand complex. In accordance with this methodology, a correction factor (Δm50%) of 0.5 Da was then added to Mave(P/L)′ to derive the true Mave(P/L). The average mass of the protein, Mave(P), was calculated from the known elemental composition. The average mass of the oligosaccharide was then determined from Mave(L) = Mave(P/L)–Mave(P).RESULTSESI-FTICR Analysis of WT MCP-1—The data provided below show that specific GAG-chemokine noncovalent interactions can be accurately determined from gas phase data. Various preliminary experiments were required to prove that these complexes are accurate reflections of the solution complexes. Therefore, sample preparation and parameters affecting the ionization process were critically optimized.The ESI mass spectra of wild type (WT) MCP-1 are shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1A represents WT MCP-1 sprayed from a solution of 79:20:1 acetonitrile:H2O:formic acid, in which the molecular mass was measured to be 8662.4615 Da. The theoretically most abundant mass of MCP-1, taking into account the fact that it and most other chemokines have two disulfide bonds, is 8662.4685 Da (1Rossi D. Zlotnik A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 217-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (2090) Google Scholar). This translates into a mass error of 0.8 ppm of the measured exact mass, clearly indicating the presence of two disulfide bonds.When MCP-1 was sprayed from a solution of 100 mm NH4OAc (pH 6.8), a solvent environment more conducive to the folded state of the protein, a tighter charge state distribution was observed, as shown in Fig. 1B. In accordance with previous ultracentrifugation studies, MCP-1 exists in equilibrium between the monomer and dimer forms (37Paolini J.F. Willard D. Consler T. Luther M. Krangel M.S. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2704-2717PubMed Google Scholar). The 4+, 5+, and 6+ charge states of the monomer ion and the 9+ charge state of the dimer ion were clearly observed in the mass spectra. The inset shows the overlap of the 8+ charged dimer with the 4+ charged monomer, indicating that a distinction can be made between the monomeric and dimeric states.Screening of Specific MCP-1 Ligands from Heparin Octasaccharide Library—Previously, it was reported that heparin interacted with MCP-1 (6Kuschert G.S.V.

https://openalex.org/W2057976500,"ELOVL4 (elongation of very long chain fatty acids 4) is a member of the ELO family of proteins involved in the biosynthesis of very long chain fatty acids. Protein truncation mutations in ELOVL4 have been identified in patients with autosomal dominant Stargardt-like macular degeneration. To determine whether a dominant negative mechanism is responsible for the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of this disease, we studied the subcellular localization and interaction of wild type and mutant ELOVL4 in COS-7 and HEK 293T cultured cells by immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation. Wild type ELOVL4 containing an endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum as expected. In contrast, disease-associated C-terminal truncation ELOVL4 mutants accumulated as large inclusions exhibiting aggresome-like characteristics in a juxtanuclear position within COS-7 cells. When the wild type and mutant proteins were co-expressed incultured cells, wild type ELOVL4 co-purified with mutant ELOVL4 on an immunoaffinity column and co-localized with the mutant protein in aggresome-like inclusions adjacent to the nucleus. These results indicate that wild type and mutant ELOVL4 form a complex that exhibits an abnormal subcellular localization found for individually expressed mutant ELOVL4. From these studies, we conclude that disease-linked C-terminal truncation mutants of ELOVL4 exert a dominant negative effect on wild type ELOVL4, altering its subcellular localization. This dominant negative mechanism contributes to the autosomal dominant inheritance of Stargardt-like macular dystrophy.

This dominant negative mechanism contributes to the autosomal dominant inheritance of Stargardt-like macular dystrophy. Macular degeneration is a heterogeneous group of retinal disorders that represent a major cause of blindness in the developed world. Macular degeneration is characterized by a marked decrease in central vision associated with a loss in visual acuity and degeneration of photoreceptor and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) 3The abbreviations used are: RPE, retinal pigment epithelial; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; WT, wild type; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PB, phosphate buffer; HEK, human embryonic kidney; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.3The abbreviations used are: RPE, retinal pigment epithelial; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; WT, wild type; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PB, phosphate buffer; HEK, human embryonic kidney; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. cells in the central retina known as the macula. In a number of cases of macular degeneration, yellow flecks are seen in the fundus resulting from the accumulation of fluorescent lipofuscin deposits in the RPE cells. One such macular degeneration is Stargardt disease (STGD1; OMIM 248200), the most common form of inherited early onset macular degeneration (1Allikmets R. Singh N. Sun H. Shroyer N.F. Hutchinson A.

This autosomal recessive disorder has been linked to mutations in ABCA4, an ATP-binding cassette transporter implicated in the removal of retinal derivatives from photoreceptor disc membranes (2Weng J.

The gene responsible for two related forms of autosomal dominant macular degeneration known as Stargardt-like macular dystrophy (OMIM 600110) and autosomal dominant macular dystrophy (OMIM 600100) was recently shown to encode a membrane protein known as ELOVL4 for elongation of very long chain fatty acids 4 (9Zhang K. Kniazeva M. Han M. Li W. Yu Z. Yang Z. Li Y. Metzker M.L. Allikmets R. Zack D.J. Kakuk L.E. Lagali P.S. Wong P.W. MacDonald I.M. Sieving P.A. Figueroa D.J. Austin C.P. Gould R.J. Ayyagari R. Petrukhin K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The protein consists of 314 amino acids (calculated molecular mass of 36.8 kDa) and is expressed primarily in rod and cone photoreceptor cells (10Zhang X.M. Yang Z. Karan G. Hashimoto T. Baehr W. Yang X.J. Zhang K. Mol. Vis. 2003; 9: 301-307PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mandal M.N. Ambasudhan R. Wong P.W. Gage P.J. Sieving P.A. Ayyagari R. Genomics. 2004; 83: 626-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A 5-bp deletion (790_794delAACTT) was found to segregate with the disease (9Zhang K. Kniazeva M. Han M. Li W. Yu Z. Yang Z. Li Y. Metzker M.L. Allikmets R. Zack D.J. Kakuk L.E. Lagali P.S. Wong P.W. MacDonald I.M. Sieving P.A. Figueroa D.J. Austin C.P. Gould R.J. Ayyagari R. Petrukhin K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), and a second mutation, two 1-bp deletions separated by 4 nucleotides (789delT and 794delT), was found in an unrelated pedigree in the same location (12Bernstein P.S. Tammur J. Singh N. Hutchinson A. Dixon M. Pappas C.M. Zabriskie N.A. Zhang K. Petrukhin K. Leppert M. Allikmets R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3331-3336PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these mutations cause a frameshift resulting in an almost identical truncated protein product. More recently, a third mutation was identified, a single base substitution encoding a premature stop codon (Y270X) that results in a truncated protein lacking the C-terminal 45 amino acids (13Maugeri A. Meire F. Hoyng C.B. Vink C. Van Regemorter N. Karan G. Yang Z. Cremers F.P. Zhang K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 4263-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The cellular function of ELOVL4 is presently unknown. The strongest clue as to the function of ELOVL4 is its homology (35% amino acid identity) with members of the yeast ELO gene family, known to be involved in the biosynthesis of very long chain fatty acids (14Oh C.S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Other members of this gene family have been studied in rodents, where they are necessary for fatty acid elongation (15Tvrdik P. Westerberg R. Silve S. Asadi A. Jakobsson A. Cannon B. Loison G. Jacobsson A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 707-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 16Westerberg R. Tvrdik P. Unden A.B. Mansson J.E. Norlen L. Jakobsson A. Holleran W.H. Elias P.M. Asadi A.

The homology of these fatty acid elongation proteins is striking, with human ELOVL4 containing all three features typical for members of this protein family: hydropathy analysis predicting at least five transmembrane segments, a dideoxy binding motif (HXXHH) (17Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), and a dilysine endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-retention motif (KXKXX) (18Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Several diseases have been associated with defects in long chain fatty acid elongation including adrenoleukodystrophy (19Mosser J. Lutz Y. Stoeckel M.E. Sarde C.O. Kretz C. Douar A.M. Lopez J. Aubourg P. Mandel J.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and adrenomyeloneuropathy (20Braun A. Ambach H. Kammerer S. Rolinski B. Stockler S. Rabl W. Gartner J. Zierz S. Roscher A.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 56: 854-861PubMed Google Scholar). The identification of pathogenic mutations in ELOVL4 implicates fatty acid biosynthesis in macular dystrophies for the first time. The lipid environment in photoreceptors is crucial for their normal function, and alterations in the lipid content have been observed in several retinal degenerative disorders (21Converse C.A. Hammer H.M. Packard C.J. Shepherd J. Trans. Ophthalmol. Soc. UK. 1983; 103: 508-512PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gong J. Rosner B. Rees D.G. Berson E.L. Weigel-DiFranco C.A. Schaefer E.J. Invest.

Lipids. 1999; 34: 235-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that ELOVL4 may be involved in the biosynthesis of docosahexaenoic acid from dietary α-linolenic acid (27Sprecher H. Luthria D.L. Mohammed B.S. Baykousheva S.P. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2471-2477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where docosahexaenoic acid has been shown to account for 33-50% of the fatty acid content of vertebrate photoreceptor outer segments (28Fliesler S.J. Anderson R.E. Prog. Lipid Res. 1983; 22: 79-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 29Rapp L.M. Maple S.S. Choi J.H. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 1200-1209PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that the subcellular localization of wild type (WT) ELOVL4 may be crucial for its putative function. Heterologous expression of ELOVL4 in several cell lines has confirmed that ELOVL4 is predominantly localized to the ER, the site of very long chain fatty acid biosynthesis. The effect pathogenic mutations in ELOVL4 have on the localization of the heterologous protein, however, has produced conflicting reports. One study showed that the truncated mutant proteins resulting from the 5- and 2-bp deletions were retained in the Golgi (30Ambasudhan R. Wang X. Jablonski M.M. Thompson D.A. Lagali P.S. Wong P.W. Sieving P.A. Ayyagari R. Genomics. 2004; 83: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), possibly in the trans-Golgi network. Other studies have reported that disease-associated ELOVL4 mutants do not co-localize with the Golgi but instead are present as cytoplasmic aggregates (13Maugeri A. Meire F. Hoyng C.B. Vink C. Van Regemorter N. Karan G. Yang Z. Cremers F.P. Zhang K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 4263-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 31Karan G. Yang Z. Zhang K. Mol. Vis. 2004; 10: 248-253PubMed Google Scholar). It is unclear at present what underlies the mechanism of disease in patients with mutations in ELOVL4. To better understand the functional role of ELOVL4 in retinal cell biology and in the development of autosomal dominant macular degeneration, we have examined the biochemical properties and localization of WT and disease-associated mutants of ELOVL4 in a cell culture model and in retina tissue. In this study, we show that ELOVL4 is a membrane glycoprotein that exists as a multisubunit complex. Disease-associated ELOVL4 mutants interact with WT ELOVL4, resulting in an abnormal localization of WT ELOVL4 in cells. Our studies indicate that pathogenic ELOVL4 mutants exert a dominant negative effect on WT ELOVL4, and this mechanism is responsible for the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of Stargardt-like macular dystrophy. Construction of ELOVL4 Plasmids—Full-length ELOVL4 cDNA was isolated from human retinal RNA by reverse transcription-PCR, using the first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences). Restriction endonuclease recognition sites were introduced using PCR. The cDNA was cloned into the KpnI and BamHI sites of the pCEP4 vector (Invitrogen) and the BamHI site of the pEGFPC1 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) in frame with the C terminus of enhanced GFP. Immunoaffinity tags were added to the N terminus of ELOVL4 in the pCEP4 vector using modified primers. 3F4-ELOVL4 contained a 9-amino acid 3F4 epitope tag (YDLPLHPRT), and Myc-ELOVL4 contained a 10 amino acid Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL). The ELOVL4 mutants T22A, Y270X, 5-bp deletion (790_794delAACTT), and 2-bp deletion (789delT and 794delT) were generated using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions using the WT ELOVL4 in pEGFPC1 and 3F4-ELOVL4 in pCEP4 as templates. All of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Generation of ELOVL4 Monoclonal Antibodies—The C-terminal 46 amino acids of human ELOVL4 were cloned in frame with the C terminus of glutathione S-transferase in the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). Mice were immunized with fusion protein that had been purified on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). Hybridoma cell lines were generated as previously described (32MacKenzie D. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7100-7105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and screened for specificity to ELOVL4 using Western blots of purified 3F4-ELOVL4. The epitopes of antibodies were mapped using the SPOTS kit (Sigma Genosys, The Woodlands, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Synthetic peptides (9 amino acids long, 2-amino acid overlap) spanning the C-terminal 46 amino acids of ELOVL4 were coupled to a cellulose membrane, and their immunoreactivity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Immunofluorescence Labeling of Human Retina—Human retina tissue was processed for immunofluorescence as described previously (33Molday L.L. Hicks D. Sauer C.G. Weber B.H. Molday R.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 816-825PubMed Google Scholar). The sections were blocked and permeabilized for 20 min at 22 °C in PB (0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) containing 10% (v/v) normal goat serum and 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 and incubated with Elo 6F1 hybridoma supernatant (1:5) or purified Elo 6F1 (1:100) overnight in PB containing 2.5% (v/v) normal goat serum (antibody buffer) at 22 °C. Double-labeled sections were also incubated with JH 492 (1:6000), a polyclonal antibody specific for green/red cone opsin generously provided by Jeremy Nathans. Sections were washed with PB-T (PB containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) and labeled for 1 h with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig and Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig secondary antibody (1:2000; Molecular Probes, Burlington, ON) in antibody buffer at 22 °C. Control samples were incubated with the secondary antibody only. Labeled retinal sections were visualized using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293T and COS-7 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% (v/v) bovine growth serum (Invitrogen). HEK 293T cells were transfected in one 10-cm dish with 30 μg of plasmid DNA using calcium phosphate (34Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar) and harvested 24 h post-transfection. For co-transfection of Myc- and 3F4-tagged proteins, 15 μg of each plasmid were combined and added to one 10-cm dish. For control single transfections, 15 μg of empty pCEP4 vector was co-transfected with 15 μg of the ELOVL4 plasmid to ensure that the DNA concentrations were kept constant. Immunofluorescence Labeling of Cells—HEK 293T and COS-7 cells were grown on glass coverslips and transfected using calcium phosphate. The pCEP4 and pEGFPC1 plasmid constructs were co-transfected in a 5:1 ratio. Twenty-four h post-transfection, cells were washed in PB and fixed for 10 min in methanol at -20 °C or for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PB at 22 °C. Cells were then blocked and permeabilized for 30 min at 22 °C in PB containing 10% (v/v) normal goat serum and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and treated with primary antibodies for 1 h at 22°C in antibody buffer. The Rim 3F4 antibody (35Illing M. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10303-10310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) was diluted at 1:2, and Elo 6F1 and 9E10 antibody (for the detection of the Myc epitope) were used at a 1:5 dilution. The following commercial antibodies were also used: monoclonal antibodies Vimentin clone V9 (1:100), β-COP clone MaD (1:50) (Sigma), and golgin-97 (1 μg/ml) (Molecular Probes); polyclonal rabbit anti-calnexin 1:200 (Stressgen, Victoria, Canada) and rabbit anti-Myc 1:100 (Sigma). Goat anti-mouse Ig and goat anti-rabbit Ig secondary antibodies coupled with either Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) or Alexa 488, were added in antibody buffer for 1 h at 22°C at 1:1000. Immunofluorescent labeling was visualized using a Zeiss Axioplan2 fluorescence microscope. Immunoprecipitation of Heterologously Expressed ELOVL4 Proteins—Purified Rim 3F4 antibody was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads as described previously (35Illing M. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10303-10310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Transfected HEK 293T cells were harvested from the dishes; washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS); and solubilized with 18 mm CHAPS in TBS with protease inhibitors for 30 min at 22 °C. The cell extract was centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 10 min, and the soluble fraction (precolumn) was incubated for 1 h with Rim 3F4-Sepharose beads prewashed with column buffer (12 mm CHAPS in TBS). The unbound fraction was retained, and the immunoaffinity matrix was washed extensively in an Ultrafree filter unit (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA) with column buffer. The bound protein was eluted from the beads with 60 μl of competing Rim 3F4 peptide (0.2 mg/ml) in column buffer followed by further elution with 60 μlof 1% (w/v) SDS in TBS. The fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. Endoglycosidase Digestion—The total membrane fractions of bovine retina and transfected HEK 293T cells were isolated as described previously (36Bungert S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23539-23546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Membranes were treated with N-glycosidase F and endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions but with modifications. Briefly, washed membranes from bovine retina or HEK 293T cells were resuspended in 20 μlof20mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, incubated with 2 μlof10× denaturing buffer for 10 min at 32 °C, and subsequently added to either 3 μlof10× G5 buffer, 3 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 2 μl of endoglycosidase H or 3 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40, 3 μl of 10× G7 buffer, and 2 μl of N-glycosidase F. Control samples were set up in parallel without the enzyme. After a 2-h incubation at 32 °C, the samples were added to an equal volume of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and 20 μl of each sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Gel Filtration Chromatography of ELOVL4—Bovine retinal membranes or HEK 293T membranes expressing 3F4-ELOVL4 were solubilized in TBS containing 18 mm CHAPS and 1 mm dithiothreitol on ice for 30 min. The samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/30 GL column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with TBS containing 12 mm CHAPS and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The elution was performed using the same buffer at 0.5 ml/min. Fractions (250 μl) were collected and analyzed by dot blotting and Western blotting using Rim 3F4 and Elo 8E4 antibodies. The column was calibrated using thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), transferrin (81 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and myoglobin (17.6 kDa). The void volume was determined using blue dextran (2000 kDa; Amersham Biosciences). The amount of ELOVL4 immunoreactivity in each fraction was determined by densitometry and expressed as a percentage of the total immunoreactivity. Sucrose Velocity Sedimentation—Bovine ELOVL4, 3F4-ELOVL4, and 3F4-ELOVL4-Del were applied to a 5-20% (w/w) linear sucrose gradient containing 12 mm CHAPS and 1 mm dithiothreitol in TBS at 214,000 × g and 4 °C for 6 h. Bovine ELOVL4 and 3F4-ELOVL4 membranes were solubilized as for gel filtration. 3F4-ELOVL4 and 3F4-ELOVL4-Del were immunoprecipitated as described above. Three drop fractions were collected from the bottom of each gradient and analyzed by dot blotting with Elo 8E4 and Rim 3F4 antibodies. Relative immunoreactivity of each fraction was quantified by densitometry. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Samples denatured in SDS-PAGE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% sucrose, and 4% β-mercaptoethanol) were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% resolving gels and electroblotted onto Immobilin-FL membranes (Millipore) for antibody labeling. Following blocking for 30 min at 22 °C in 0.5% skimmed milk in PBS, blots were incubated with hybridoma supernatants for 1 h at 22 °C in 0.5% skimmed milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) at the following dilutions: Rim 3F4 (1:20), Elo 6F1 (1:10), Myc 9E10 (1:10), and Elo 8E4 (1:5). Subsequently, the blots were labeled for 1 h at 22°C with anti-mouse Ig conjugated with either Alexa 680 or LI-COR IRDye™ 800 (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) diluted 1:15,000 in 0.5% skimmed milk in PBST containing 0.02% SDS. Bands were visualized by infrared scanning using the LI-COR Odyssey® system (Lincoln, NE). Concanavalin A labeling was carried out as described previously (36Bungert S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J.

Monoclonal Antibodies against ELOVL4—Monoclonal antibodies Elo 6F1 and Elo 8E4 were raised against the C terminus of human ELOVL4 (amino acid residues 268-314) expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Both antibodies labeled a 32-kDa protein in human retinal extracts and membranes from HEK 293T cells expressing the human ELOVL4 protein (Fig. 1A). Only the Elo 8E4 antibody labeled a 32-kDa protein in bovine retinal membranes. Neither antibody labeled a corresponding protein in mouse retinal extracts. The predicted molecular mass of ELOVL4 is 36.8 kDa, slightly larger than the 32-kDa protein band detected by Western blotting. To confirm that the 32-kDa protein is ELOVL4, membrane proteins from HEK 293T cells expressing the Myc-ELOVL4 protein were separated on SDS gels, and Western blots were labeled with the 9E10 antibody to detect the N-terminal Myc tag and the Elo 6F1 and Elo 8E4 antibodies (Fig. 1B). A single band migrating with the same apparent molecular weight was detected with each antibody in Myc-ELOVL4-transfected but not mock-transfected cells. No bands were detected when the secondary antibody was used alone or when the Elo 6F1 and Elo 8E4 antibodies were preadsorbed with the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein prior to labeling confirming the specificity of the antibodies (data not shown). The epitopes of the ELOVL4 monoclonal antibodies were identified using synthetic peptides. The binding site for the Elo 6F1 mapped to the sequence SEKQLMI (amino acids 294-300), and Elo 8E4 mapped to the sequence QKNGKAK (amino acids 306-312). Distribution of ELOVL4 in Human Retina—The expression pattern of ELOVL4 in human retina was examined by immunofluorescence using the Elo 6F1 antibody (Fig. 2A). Intense labeling was observed in the photoreceptor inner segment layer. The inner segment signal appeared to be confined to the myoid region adjacent to the outer limiting membrane, where the ER is abundant. Staining of the photoreceptor cell bodies in the outer nuclear layer was also observed, extending to the synapses in the outer plexiform layer. No staining was observed in the photoreceptor outer segments or the layers of the inner retina, but the ganglion cells were moderately labeled. High acuity vision is mediated by cone photoreceptors in the central region of the retina. Since Stargardt macular dystrophy affects cone-dominant central vision, it was of interest to determine whether ELOVL4 was present in cone photoreceptors of the central retina. To determine whether ELOVL4 is present in these cones, we compared the cellular localization of ELOVL4 with green/red cone opsin in a cone-rich area of the central retina known as the parafovea (Fig. 2B). Labeling was observed in the inner segment of cone as well as rod photoreceptors, most evident when examined at higher magnification (Fig. 2B, Merge, inset). However, ELOVL4 labeling in cones appeared less intense then in rod photoreceptors. No labeling was observed when the primary antibodies were omitted (data not shown). ELOVL4 Is Modified by N-Linked Oligosaccharides—Integral membrane proteins are commonly subjected to co-translational core N-glycosylation (37Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar). To determine whether ELOVL4 is glycosylated, membranes from bovine retina and HEK 293T cells expressing 3F4-ELOVL4 were treated with the endoglycosidase enzymes N-glycosidase F and endoglycosidase H and subsequently analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 3A). After treatment with either of the glycosidases, both native (bovine retina) and expressed ELOVL4 (3F4-ELOVL4) showed a slightly increased mobility, suggesting that ELOVL4 is N-linked glycosylated. Both native and expressed ELOVL4 were sensitive to endoglycosidase H as well as N-glycosidase F (Fig. 3A), indicating that the oligosaccharide modification is a simple hybrid or high mannose addition, since complex oligosaccharide side chains are usually insensitive to endoglycosidase H cleavage. Inspection of the ELOVL4 amino acid sequence revealed a single consensus N-linked glycosylation motif (NX(T/S)) at amino acids 20-22 (NDT) that was highly conserved in ELOVL4 orthologues (10Zhang X.M. Yang Z. Karan G. Hashimoto T. Baehr W. Yang X.J. Zhang K. Mol. Vis. 2003; 9: 301-307PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that this motif is glycosylated, a T22A mutation was introduced into the N-linked consensus sequence of 3F4-ELOVL4. As shown in Fig. 3B, the T22A had the same mobility as the deglycosylated WT protein, and no detectable shift in the 3F4-ELOVL4-T22A protein was observed upon glycosidase treatment. To further confirm the glycosylation state of ELOVL4, the WT and mutant proteins were purified on a Rim 3F4 immunoaffinity column and labeled with the mannose-binding lectin, concanavalin A (Fig. 3C). Concanavalin A strongly labeled the WT protein but not the T22A mutant, consistent with the absence of mannose residues on the mutant ELOVL4 protein. Furthermore, the unglycosylated T22A mutant protein was present at similar levels as the WT protein, indicating that the glycosylation state of ELOVL4 did not affect the expression level of protein (Fig. 3C). Together these results indicate that heterologously expressed ELOVL4 and native bovine retinal ELOVL4 contain a simple N-linked oligosaccharide at Asn20 near the N terminus of the protein.

However, neither the identity nor the mechanism of activation of the plasma membrane influx pathway that mediates CCE is known. Accordingly, we determined, in human corneal epithelial cells, whether or not (i) CCE is dependent upon stimulation of storeoperated channel (SOC) activity, (ii) the canonical transient receptor potential (TRP) protein isoform TRPC4 is a component of such channels, and (iii) suppression of TRPC4 protein expression decreases EGF-induced stimulation of SOC activity and proliferation.

In these cells, EGF-induced SOC activation elicited by intracellular calcium store depletion was obviated; 2) EGF-induced CCE fell by 76%; 3) EGF-induced stimulation of SOC activity was eliminated; and 4) EGF-induced increases in proliferation fell by 54%. Thus, TRPC4 is a component of SOC in human corneal epithelial cells whose activation by EGF is requisite for an optimum mitogenic response to this growth factor.

Thus, TRPC4 is a component of SOC in human corneal epithelial cells whose activation by EGF is requisite for an optimum mitogenic response to this growth factor. Maintenance of the optical attributes and transparency of the cornea is essential for normal vision. These properties are partially dependent upon the ability of the outer corneal epithelial layer to elicit fluid flow from the stromal layer into the tear film layer. These flows are not as great as those mediated by the inner endothelial layer, but are essential to the maintenance of ocular surface health (1Klyce S.D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1977; 16: 968-973PubMed Google Scholar). Another epithelial property required for normal vision is that this layer provides a barrier function against noxious agents and toxins (2Lu L. Reinach P.S. Kao W.W. Exp. Biol. Med. 2001; 226: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Barrier properties are maintained by the tight junctional integrity that exists between neighboring epithelial cells. They depend upon continuous proliferation of basal layer cells to replace the differentiating superficial cell layers that are ultimately sloughed off into the tears. Therefore, corneal epithelial function is sustained provided the basal cells proliferate at a rate adequate for replacing the dying cells in the superficial layers. Corneal epithelial basal cell proliferation is controlled by a host of cytokines, e.g. epidermal growth factor (EGF), 2The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; CCE, capacitative calcium entry; ICS, intracellular calcium store(s); IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; SOC, store-operated channel(s); TRP, transient receptor potential; TRPC, TRP canonical subfamily; RCEC, rabbit corneal epithelial cells; 2-APB, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate; HCEC, human corneal epithelial cells; RT, reverse transcription; siRNA, small interfering RNA; CPA, cyclopiazonic acid; pF, picofarad(s); DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid. that activate their cognate receptors in the deeper layers of the epithelium. Following injury to the corneal epithelial layer, wound repair is stimulated by autocrine-mediated increases in the synthesis of EGF and various other growth factors. EGF stimulates wound closure in vitro by a myriad of signaling pathways. One of the events in these cascades includes the activation of calcium transients through stimulation of capacitative calcium entry (CCE) (3Yang H. Sun X. Wang Z. Ning G. Zhang F. Kong J. Lu L. Reinach P.S. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 194: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). According to this paradigm, depletion of intracellular calcium stores (ICS) occurs as a result of calcium loss through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor-linked pathways. Such losses elicit a feedback signal to the plasma membrane and result in the activation of store-operated channels (SOC) (4Putney Jr., J.W. Bird G.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 199-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 5Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar, 6Tsien R.W. Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 715-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 7Putney Jr., J.W. Bird G.S. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 610-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). In the corneal epithelium, however, neither the nature of the feedback signal nor the mechanisms underlying the increases in plasma membrane calcium influx induced by this growth factor are known (8Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2115) Google Scholar). Using tissues other than the corneal epithelium, two different alternatives have been proposed to describe how ICS depletion activates plasma membrane calcium influx. One is the conformational coupling model, which involves direct communication between IP3 receptors in the ICS and plasma membrane-permeable channels (9Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 10Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). The other involves communication between ICS and these channels due to release of a diffusible signal from the ICS, the so-called calcium influx factor (11Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 12Csutora P. Su Z. Kim H.Y. Bugrim A. Cunningham K.W. Nuccitelli R. Keizer J.E. Hanley M.R. Blalock J.E. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Irrespective of the specific mechanism, calcium entry occurs with variable ionic selectivity after activation of SOC. Transient receptor potential (TRP) proteins are members of a superfamily made up of five different major subfamilies (13Harteneck C. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). They are components of plasma membrane influx pathways, activated directly by depletion of ICS and/or receptor-linked signal transduction cascades. One such subfamily is the canonical family, i.e. TRPC, which contains seven different isoforms (14Montell C. Sci. STKE 2001. 2001; : RE1Google Scholar). Calcium influx-dependent proliferation occurs through plasma membrane channels that contain a variety of TRPC isoforms, including TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC6 (15Landsberg J.W. Yuan J.X. News Physiol. Sci. 2004; 19: 44-50PubMed Google Scholar, 16Zhang S. Remillard C.V. Fantozzi I. Yuan J.X. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1192-C1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, in corneal epithelial cells, there is no information regarding a role for TRPC expression in mediating CCE and the mitogenic response to EGF. Furthermore, the importance of such expression to SOC function has not been described. In rabbit corneal epithelial cells (RCEC), EGF induces ICS depletion, which in turn triggers CCE (3Yang H. Sun X. Wang Z. Ning G. Zhang F. Kong J. Lu L. Reinach P.S. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 194: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This effect of EGF is fully suppressed by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB). However, the mechanism of this effect could not be clarified because there is increasing realization that 2-APB can have numerous other effects besides suppression of SOC activity (17Gregory R.B. Rychkov G. Barritt G.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). 2-APB can have multiple effects, even within the same tissue. In some cases, 2-APB blocks IP3 receptor-mediated calcium release from ICS and gap junctional coupling (18Ma H.T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L.

Chem. 2004; 279: 35741-35748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mechanism whereby EGF induces CCE in RCEC could not be completely characterized in our previous study (3Yang H. Sun X. Wang Z. Ning G. Zhang F. Kong J. Lu L. Reinach P.S. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 194: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In RCEC, TRPC4 expression is plasma membrane-delimited, suggesting that it may be a component of an ionic influx pathway whose activation elicits CCE. Our finding in RCEC that 2-APB has corresponding inhibitory effects on EGF-induced CCE and an increase in proliferation is consistent with such a suggestion (3Yang H. Sun X. Wang Z. Ning G. Zhang F. Kong J. Lu L. Reinach P.S. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 194: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, given the complex pharmacology of 2-APB, the possible importance of TRPC4 expression to these responses is unknown. Such uncertainty is further indicated by the aforementioned finding that 2-APB can inhibit influx pathways composed of TRPC1 and TRPC3, which are two of the four other TRPC isoforms whose gene expression was detected in RCEC. Therefore, it is not possible to draw any conclusions about the importance of TRPC4 expression to CCE and the mitogenic function of EGF. On the other hand, TRPC4 expression may be requisite for EGF to induce increases in corneal epithelial SOC activity because, in human mesangial cells, the stimulation by EGF of such activity is dependent on TRPC4 expression (30Li W.P. Tsiokas L. Sansom S.C. Ma R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4570-4577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 31Wang X. Pluznick J.L. Wei P. Padanilam B.J. Sansom S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C357-C364Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We describe in human corneal epithelial cells (HCEC) the involvement of TRPC4 gene and protein expression in eliciting SOC activation required for (i) EGF-induced increases in plasma membrane calcium influx and (ii) the mitogenic response to this growth factor. Our results indicate that TRPC4 protein expression is required for EGF stimulation of SOC activity. This dependence is evident, as EGF had no stimulatory effect on plasma membrane calcium influx and SOC activity following TRPC4 knockdown. Finally, TRPC4 expression is requisite for EGF to induce optimum increases in proliferation. Cell Culture—SV40-immortalized HCEC (a generous gift from Dr. Araki-Sasaki) were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 95% ambient air in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 6% fetal bovine serum, 5 ng/ml EGF, and 5 μg/ml insulin as described previously (32Araki-Sasaki K. Ohashi Y. Sasabe T. Hayashi K. Watanabe H. Tano Y. Handa H. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 614-621PubMed Google Scholar). Cell cycle arrest was achieved by culturing cells in serum- and EGF-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 for 24 h before experimentation. Fluorescence Cell Imaging—Cells grown on 22-mm circular coverslips were loaded with 2 μm fura2 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) at room temperature for 30 min and then washed (33Yang H. Wang Z. Miyamoto Y. Reinach P.S. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 183: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells were continuously superfused at 34 °C in a perfusion chamber (the base of which was formed by a coverslip) that was placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon Diaphot 200). Cells were then alternately illuminated at 340 and 380 nm, and emission was monitored every 5 s at 510 nm using a digital imaging system. The field of interest contained ∼6–10 cells. A mean running ratio was calculated for each region. Changes in fluorescence intensity were estimated as described (34Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). If a vehicle contained Me2SO, its final concentration was <0.1%. The n values provided indicate the number of experiments per data point. Cell Proliferation—[3H]Thymidine incorporation was performed as described (3Yang H. Sun X. Wang Z. Ning G. Zhang F. Kong J. Lu L. Reinach P.S. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 194: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Following 24 h of serum starvation in medium supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, both transfected and nontransfected cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (3.3–4.8 TBq/mmol) and then washed three times with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid. Cell lysates were solubilized with 0.2 n NaOH and 2% SDS. Radioactivity was monitored using a liquid scintillation counter, and the data were normalized to cellular protein content using a modified Lowry assay. RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol, and cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript RT kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed as described previously (3Yang H. Sun X. Wang Z. Ning G. Zhang F. Kong J. Lu L. Reinach P.S. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 194: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the amplified products were separated on 1.0% agarose gels. The expression levels of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were evaluated in parallel. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase sense and antisense primers were 5′-TGACCCCTTCATTGACCTTC-3′ and 5′-GGTCATAAGTCCCTCCAGGA-3′, respectively (35Sun X.C. Cui M. Bonanno J.A. BMC Physiology. 2004; http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6793/4/8PubMed Google Scholar). Band intensities were measured using SigmaScan Pro5 and were normalized to those for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which are expressed in arbitrary units. Immunoblot Analysis—Transfected and non-transfected HCEC were gently washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into homogenization buffer. Homogenization Buffer components: (150 mmol/liter NaCl, 50 mmol/liter Tris HCl, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/mL leupeptin, and 200 μmol/liter phenylsulfonyl fluoride). Subsequent steps were performed as described (36Sun X.C. Bonanno J.A. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 77: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Membranes were first exposed overnight at 4 °C to anti-TRPC4 primary antibody (diluted 1:1000; a kind gift of Dr. Michael X. Zhu) (37Tang Y. Tang J. Chen Z. Trost C. Flockerzi V. Li M. Ramesh V. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37559-37564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). They were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline/Tween detergent and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody was applied for 1 h at room temperature. Bound antibody was evaluated using an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was used to test for equal protein loading. Synthesis and Transfection of Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—The 21-nucleotide siRNA sequences specifically targeting human TRPC4 were designed and synthesized using the Silencer siRNA construction kit (Ambion Inc.). The four specific TRPC4 target sequences used in this study are listed in TABLE ONE. The siRNAs were transfected into HCEC using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) as transfection reagent. After transfection, cells were incubated at 37 °C in Opti-MEM; reduced serum medium and fresh growth medium were added at 24 h posttransfection. All experimental measurements were performed at 48–72 h post-transfection. Non-targeting siRNA (siCONTROL, Dharmacon, Inc.) was used as a control for monitoring non-sequence-specific effects.TABLE ONETarget sequences of TRPC4 siRNAsiRNATarget sequencePosition in gene sequenceGC content%siRNA1AAATGTTAATGCTCCCTATAG2433.3siRNA2AATGAATTCAAGTCGGAGTAT70333.3siRNA3AAATTAAACAGATGTGGGATG125033.3siRNA4AAATATTCAACTGGAATCTCG264633.3 Open table in a new tab Electrophysiological Measurements—Coverslips with HCEC were mounted on the stage of an upright microscope (Olympus BX50WI). The cells were superfused with a sodium- and potassium-free extracellular bath solution containing 120 mmol/liter N-methyl-d-glucamine, 5.4 mmol/liter CsCl, 1.0 mmol/liter MgCl2, 10 mmol/liter glucose, 10 mmol/liter HEPES acid, and 0.5 mmol/liter EGTA (pH adjusted to 7.2). Cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) (Calbiochem), an inhibitor of the ICS Ca2+/Mg2+-ATPase pump, activated SOC currents (ISOC) through passive depletion of ICS. In brief, cells were first incubated with 10 μm CPA. After 10 min, 5 mm Ca2+ was applied to the bath to induce CCE. Control currents were measured with CPA in the bath. ISOC was recorded after induction of CCE. Pipettes of soft glass with a resistance of 2–5 megaohms were pulled using a Universal Puller. Pipettes for whole cell recordings were filled with a solution containing 130 mmol/liter CsCl, 4.0 mmol/liter MgCl2, 10 mmol/liter EGTA, and 10 mmol/liter HEPES salt (pH adjusted to 7.2). Membrane currents were recorded using an EPC 8 amplifier (HEKA, Lamprecht, Germany). Electrical stimulation, data storage, and processing were performed using TIDA software (HEKA) in conjunction with a PC/AT compatible computer. All electrophysiological experiments were performed at room temperature. Membrane capacitances and access resistances were calculated from the capacitative current transient induced by a 90-mV hyperpolarization from the holding potential (0 mV) of 50-ms duration. Mean access resistances of 41 ± 3 megaohms (n = 18) and mean membrane capacitances of 38 ± 3 picofarads (pF) (n = 25) were measured in the whole cell configuration in both non-transfected and siRNA-transfected cells. Pipette and membrane capacitances and access resistances were compensated with an EPC 8 patch-clamp amplifier. The liquid junction potential was estimated experimentally as well as theoretically and corrected for at the beginning of each measurement (38Barry P.H. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1994; 51: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). If drugs were added in a Me2SO-containing stock solution, the concentration was kept <0.1% (v/v), which did not affect the patch-clamp recordings (data not shown). Whole cell currents (ISOC) were recorded for 300 ms using voltage steps ranging between –120 and +20 mV (20-mV increments). Chemicals—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. Data Analyses—All values are reported as means ± S.E. The numbers of replicates are indicated in each case in parentheses. Statistical significance was determined with Student's t test. p values <0.05 were taken to be significant. To assess the role of TRPC4 in mediating EGF-induced responses, its gene expression was knocked down using each of four different siRNA candidates specifically targeting suppression of TRPC4 protein expression. Fig. 1 shows the RT-PCR product yields obtained with TRPC4 siRNA2, which was as effective as TRPC4 siRNA3 in eliciting TRPC4 gene expression knockdown. Forty-eight hours after transfection, TRPC4 gene expression decreased by 89 ± 0.3% (n = 3; p < 0.001) from the control value. RT omission was performed to assess genomic DNA contamination; lack of any cDNA product in the negative control lane reflects undetectable contamination. Similarly, Oligofectamine as vehicle by itself had no effect on TRPC4 gene expression. Fig. 1 (lower panel) shows that that levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene expression were invariant, indicating loading condition equivalence. Fig. 2 compares variations in TRPC4 protein expression levels resulting from exposure to the following conditions: (i) non-transfected cells, (ii) cells transfected with noncoding siRNA (siCONTROL), (iii) cells transfected with TRPC4 siRNA2 or siRNA3, and (iv) pre-absorption by specific anti-TRPC4 antibody of its peptide recognition sequence. A single band corresponding to TRPC4 with an apparent molecular mass of ∼90 kDa was detected, whereas pre-exposure of anti-TRPC4 antibody to its targeted epitope eliminated detection of the aforementioned band. There was no significant difference between the TRPC4 expression levels in the control and siCONTROL cells. On the other hand, siRNA2 and siRNA3 effectively decreased TRPC4 protein expression by 85 ± 0.3% (n = 4; p < 0.005) and 89 ± 0.2% (n = 4; p < 0.004), respectively, relative to that measured in non-transfected and siCONTROL cells. These results indicate that the TRPC4 siRNA sequence designs were sufficiently selective to suppress TRPC4 protein expression. EGF induces depletion of ICS, which results in CCE in RCEC (3Yang H. Sun X. Wang Z. Ning G. Zhang F. Kong J. Lu L. Reinach P.S. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 194: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The increases in plasma membrane influx associated with this response can be characterized by employing the calcium add-back protocol. This procedure entails initial emptying of ICS content, followed by repletion of the bathing solution calcium composition. The height of the transient resulting from Ca2+ add-back is at least partially reflective of the extent of SOC activation. We considered the dependence of SOC activation on TRPC4 protein expression by comparing the responses to calcium addback in TRPC4 siRNA-transfected HCEC with those in non-transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 3, ICS were initially depleted of Ca2+ content by inhibition of ICS Ca2+/Mg2+-ATPase activity with 10 μm CPA in Ca2+-free medium containing 1 mm EGTA. After addition of CPA, a Ca2+ transient frequently occurred, confirming depletion of ICS Ca2+ content. Following replacement of the medium with its calcium (1 mm)-containing counterpart, there was a rapid increase in the F340nm/F380nm ratio, which was at least partially due to SOC activation. In non-transfected cells, Ca2+ add-back induced an increase in the F340nm/F380nm ratio of >1 arbitrary unit (control set to 100%), whereas in TRPC4 siRNA2-transfected cells, the CCE amplitude was reduced by 76 ± 2% (n = 5; p < 0.005). This decline in amplitude indicates that activation of SOC pathways composed of TRPC4 contributes to the calcium addback response. To further substantiate the role of SOC activation in eliciting a rise in calcium influx following ICS depletion, we determined the effect of 0.5 mm Ni2+ on CCE amplitude. At high concentrations (in the mm range), this cation is a SOC blocker (39Golovina V.A. Platoshyn O. Bailey C.L. Wang J. Limsuwan A. Sweeney M. Rubin L.J. Yuan J.X. Am. J.

In Fig. 4A, a typical recording shows that, with Ni2+, the CPA-induced CCE increase fell to 68 ± 3% (n = 5) of the control value set equal to 100%. This response was followed by a slight but insignificant increase to a stable value (83 ± 7%, n = 5). Subsequent removal of Ca2+ from the bath caused the transient to fall to the value measured prior to Ca2+ addition. Fig. 4B summarizes the results obtained with this procedure. The average changes in the ratio closely correspond to those observed in Fig. 4A, indicating that SOC activation makes a substantial contribution to CCE. To directly assess the increases in calcium flux resulting from ICS depletion, we measured currents of non-transfected and TRPC4 siRNA2-transfected cells using the whole cell mode of the patch-clamp technique. As illustrated in Fig. 5A, cells were exposed to a solution lacking Na+ and K+ to eliminate any currents that could result from their presence. In addition, the bath solution contained 5 μm nifedipine to block voltage-dependent L-type channel activity, and the pipette solution contained 0.1 mm DIDS to inhibit chloride channel activity. The stimulation protocol used to characterize SOC activity is shown in Fig. 5B. The holding potential was set to 0 mV to eliminate any possible contributions by voltage-dependent calcium channel activity. The current responses in the absence and presence of bath calcium (i.e. 5mm) using this protocol and following ICS depletion with 10 μm CPA are shown in Fig. 5C. Subsequent to Ca2+ medium supplementation and in the continued presence of CPA, both inward and outward currents increased, which is indicative of SOC activity. Fig. 5D shows the current density-voltage relationship, wherein the current is normalized to capacitance to obtain current density (pA/pF). In the absence and presence of calcium, current densities were measured using the stimulation protocol shown in Fig. 5B after establishing the whole cell configuration. In the absence of bath calcium, some increases in inward currents were detected. By contrast, with 5 mm calcium in the bath, the current increased significantly. Specifically, the maximum inward current (at –120 mV) increased from –5.92 ± 1.03 to –13.94 ± 3.00 pA/pF (n = 5; p < 0.04). These results indicate that ICS depletion induces SOC activation. To assess the importance of TRPC4 expression to SOC activation, we determined whether SOC activity induced by ICS depletion is suppressed in TRPC4 siRNA2-transfected cells. Fig. 6A compares the current profiles obtained with the same voltage protocol used to characterize the non-transfected cells shown in Fig. 5B. In transfected cells, no effect of the charge carrier was visible. Fig. 6B shows that, in contrast to non-transfected cells, the current density-voltage relationship was tical irrespective of the presence or absence of Ca2+ in the bath solution. In particular, at –120 mV, the maximum inward current was –8.67 ± 1.73 pA/pF i"
https://openalex.org/W2096384115,"Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a natural inhibitor of angiogenesis, acts directly on endothelial cells (EC) via CD36 to inhibit their migration and morphogenesis induced by basic fibroblast growth factor. Here we show that CD36 triggered by TSP-1 inhibits in vitro angiogenesis stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). To demonstrate that the TSP-1 inhibitory signal was mediated by CD36, we transduced CD36 in CD36-deficient endothelial cells. Both TSP-1 and the agonist anti-CD36 mAb SMO, which mimics TSP-1 activity, reduced the VEGF-A165-induced migration and sprouting of CD36-ECs. To address the mechanisms by which CD36 may exert its angiostatic function, we investigated the functional components of the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail by site-directed mutagenesis. Our results indicate that C464, R467, and K469 of CD36 are required for the inhibitory activity of TSP-1. In contrast, point mutation of C466 did not alter TSP-1 ability to inhibit EC migration and sprouting. Moreover, we show that activation of CD36 by TSP-1 down-modulates the VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and p38 mitogen-associated protein kinase phosphorylation induced by VEGF-A165, and this effect was specifically abolished by point mutation at C464. These results identify specific amino acids of the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of CD36 crucial for the in vitro angiostatic activity of TSP-1 and extend our knowledge of regulation of VEGFR-2-mediated biological activities on ECs."

A more recent study in which crystals of AMY1 soaked in a solution containing thio-maltotetraose was expected to expand our knowledge on subsite-binding modes in the catalytic cleft of plant α-amylases. This substrate analogue, however, led to the discovery of a new surface binding site at domain C (see Fig. 1), the so-called “pair of sugar tongs,” but did not bind to the active site (28Robert X.

The enzyme was concentrated (Centriprep YM10, Millipore, Bedford, MA) to ∼2 mg × ml-1 and stored in 10 mm MES, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 6.8, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide at 4 °C. Isoelectric focusing (pI 4–6.5) and SDS-PAGE (PhastGels and Phast-System, Amersham Biosciences) of AMY1D180A were silver-stained according to the manufacturer's recommendation (36Matsui I.

Enzyme Activity Assays—Activity toward soluble potato starch (Sigma), 9 mg × ml-1 in 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.05 mg × ml-1 bovine serum albumin, pH 5.5, was measured for AMY1D180A (4 μm) at 37 °C and incubated for 45 s, 10 min, 30 min, and 2 h (140 μl) using the copper bicinchoninate procedure (35Mori H.

The inactive AMY1D180A mutant was crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 19 °C, using protein stock (2.9 mg × ml-1) in 10 mm MES, pH 6.7, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% NaN3. Drops were prepared by mixing 2 μl of protein stock with 0.5 μl of 3% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol and 2.5 μl of well solution containing 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000. Thin crystals typically grew to a final size of 0.8 × 0.1 × 0.05 mm3 after ∼6 months. Soaking was done by adding a solution of maltoheptaose (Roche Applied Science) directly to the drop to a final concentration of 10 mm and leaving it for 24 h at 19 °C. The AMY1D180A-acarbose complex was obtained by adding acarbose directly to the drop at a final concentration of 10 mm and leaving it for 24 h at 19 °C. All crystals were cryo-protected prior to data collection by rapid soaking in three successive steps in mother liquor containing increasing concentrations of ethylene glycol (5, 10, and 15% (v/v)) and 10 mm acarbose or maltoheptaose, respectively. Diffraction Data Collection—AMY1-acarbose diffraction data were collected on a MARresearch 345 Image Plate System associated to a Nonius FR591 rotating anode (CuKα radiation), operating at 44 kV and 100 mA and coupled to Osmic confocal mirrors. Data processing and reduction was carried out using DENZO (38Otwinoswki Z. Minor W.

For all data sets, an initial rigid body refinement, including data to 4 Å resolution, was performed, and in the remaining refinements a simulated annealing protocol was used extending the data to 2.0 Å resolution. All refinements were done with the program CNS (41Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M.

In order to avoid over-refinement, free and conventional R-factors were monitored (42Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar). Alternating with these refinement steps, visual examination of electron density maps and manual building was carried out using the graphic software TURBO-FRODO (43Roussel A. Cambillau C. Biographics. Architecture et Fonction des Macremolécules Biologiques, Marseille, France1992Google Scholar). Based on the inspection of 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc maps (contoured at 1 and 3σ, respectively), calcium ions were inserted, and water molecules were manually added respecting hydrogen bonds with standard distances and angles formed to appropriate atoms. Ligands (sugar moieties from acarbose or maltoheptaose) were manually inserted in the electron density maps. Because of the high quality and resolution of the diffraction data, the orientation and nature of each sugar ring was unequivocally determined. Models of acarbose and glucose units were found in the HIC-Up data base (44Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2136153756,"The neurotrophins brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) have been shown to promote survival and differentiation of midbrain dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in vitro and in vivo. This is consistent with their expression and that of their cognate receptors, trkB and trkC, in the nigrostriatal system. Degeneration of DAergic neurons of the substantia nigra and alpha-synuclein-positive aggregates in the remaining substantia nigra (SN) neurons are hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD). Reduced expression of BDNF has been reported in the SN from PD patients. Moreover, mutations in the BDNF gene have been found to play a role in the development of familial PD. We show now that haploinsufficiencies of the neurotrophin receptors trkB and/or trkC cause a reduction in numbers of SN neurons in aged (21-23 month old) mice, which is accompanied by a reduced density in striatal tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive (TH-ir) fibers. These aged mutant mice, in contrast to wild-type littermates, display an accumulation of alpha-synuclein in the remaining TH-positive neurons of the SN. We conclude that impairment in trkB and/or trkC signaling induces a phenotype in the aged SN, which includes two hallmarks of PD, losses of TH positive neurons and axons along with massive neuronal deposits of alpha-synuclein."

A competing phototransformation process, which ionizes the chromophore and decarboxylates Glu-222, mimics the electrostatic and structural changes in the fluorescence photocycle. Structural and spectroscopic analysis of the cryogenically stabilized photoproduct at 100 K and a structurally annealed intermediate of the phototransformed protein at 170 K reveals distinct structural relaxations involving protein, chromophore, solvent, and photogenerated CO2. Strong structural changes of the 100 K photoproduct after decarboxylation appear exclusively within 15 Å of the chromophore and include the electrostatically driven perturbations of Gln-69, Cys-70, and water molecules in an H-bonding network connecting the chromophore. X-ray crystallography to 1.85 Å resolution and static and picosecond time-resolved IR spectroscopy identify structural mechanisms common to phototransformation and to the fluorescence photocycle. In particular, the appearance of a 1697 cm-1 (+) difference band in both photocycle and phototransformation intermediates is a spectroscopic signature for the structural perturbation of Gln-69. This is taken as evidence for an electrostatically driven dynamic response that is common to both photoreaction pathways. The interactions between the chromophore and the perturbed residues and solvent are decreased or removed in the T203H single and T203H/Q69L double mutants, resulting in a strong reduction of the fluorescence quantum yield.

The mechanism by which the protein environment suppresses non-radiative processes remains unexplained. Proposals for the ESPT pathway include a hydrogen bonding network connecting the chromophore phenolic oxygen to Glu-222 via a water molecule and Ser-205 (7Brejc K. Sixma T.K. Kitts P.A. Kain S.R.

The transient infrared absorption reportedly developing at 1706 cm-1 with excitation of GFP in D2O (9Stoner-Ma D. Jaye A.A. Matousek P. Towrie M. Meech S.R. Tonge P.J. J. Am. Chem.

However, experimental evidence for the identity of the proton acceptor has recently been provided from comparison with the E222D mutant (11van Thor J.J. Zanetti G. Ronayne K. Towrie M. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2005; 109: 16099-16108Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Low quantum yield electron transfer from Glu-222 to the photoexcited chromophore triggers decarboxylation of the buried carboxyl group (12van Thor J.J. Gensch T. Hellingwerf K.J. Johnson L.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This irreversible phototransformation process competes with ESPT that initiates the dominant fluorescence photocycle. The buried carboxylate of Glu-222 stabilizes the protonated chromophore via electrostatic repulsion (13Yang F. Moss L.G. Phillips Jr., G.N. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1246-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). Neutralization of Glu-222 by light-induced decarboxylation therefore leads to chromophore ionization in equilibrium at pH 8.0 (12van Thor J.J. Gensch T. Hellingwerf K.J. Johnson L.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows a simplified reaction scheme depicting the major charge redistributions for both the high quantum yield, reversible fluorescence photocycle, and the low quantum yield, irreversible, phototransformation pathway. The protein must relax to accommodate the electrostatic stress generated by chromophore ionization and neutralization of Glu-222, either in the phototransformed protein or following the ESPT reaction in the fluorescence photocycle. In the phototransformation pathway, we refer to the initial “dark” structure with a neutral chromophore (λmax = 400 nm) as GFPA, the initial “lumi” state produced by illumination at 100 K (λmax = 497 nm) as GFPL, the “meta” intermediate generated by thermal annealing of GFPL as GFPM, and the final, fully relaxed photoproduct previously characterized at 300 K (12van Thor J.J. Gensch T. Hellingwerf K.J. Johnson L.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) as GFPR. We describe structural events that follow charge transfer to the chromophore at cryogenic temperatures well below the protein dynamical transition (14Vitkup D. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Karplus M. Nat.

We conclude that rapid, low barrier structural dynamics stabilize the locally created buried charge and account for the bright fluorescence of GFP. Crystallization and Phototransformation—Wild type GFP was expressed and purified essentially according to a previous study (13Yang F. Moss L.G. Phillips Jr., G.N. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1246-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). Crystals were grown at 4 °C in 100 mm Tris/HCl, 50 mm MgCl2, and 15% polyethylene glycol 3350, pH 7.8, and cryo-protected using 20% glycerol, 100 mm Tris/HCl, 50 mm MgCl2, and 15% polyethylene glycol 3350, pH 7.8. For the initial studies, GFPA crystals with various dimensions were exposed to an increasing dosage of short-wavelength UV radiation, and x-ray diffraction data were collected, using an in-house rotating anode source, to 2.4-Å resolution. The progressive disappearance of electron density of the γ-carboxylate of Glu-222 was used as an indicator for phototransformation. For these initial studies structures were not fully refined, and crude phases obtained from molecular replacement, rigid body and limited restrained refinements were sufficient to estimate the electron density changes at Glu-222. The progressive appearance of additional difference features in the unrefined FL - FA map at 2.4-Å resolution resembled those later determined at higher resolution (Fig. 2, A-C), indicating the accumulation of the lumi state GFPL. Off-line microspectrophotometric measurements were done at 100 K to monitor the phototransformation as well as fluorescence and absorption measurements of dissolved crystals after illumination. Together, these tests indicated that with illumination normal to the crystallographic b-axis of a crystal with a typical cross-section of 30 μm × 30 μm, complete phototransformation and trapping of a first intermediate at 100 K was achieved by illumination with a short-wavelength UV source (Universal UV lamp (Type TL-900) CAMAG, Muttenz, Switzerland, λmax = 254 nm), with a dose of 0.1 mJ cm-2 s-1 for 75 min while continuously rotating the crystal. The extinction at 254 nm for half the path length (15 μm) was calculated to be 0.7, using an estimated extinction coefficient of 20 mm-1 cm-1. X-ray Data Collection—A crystal with dimensions of 30 μm × 30 μm × 200 μm was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, mounted in a Cryo-Loop, and maintained at 100 K using an Oxford Instruments Cryojet operating at a flow rate of 6.0 liters/min. X-ray diffraction data were collected at beamline 14.2 at the Synchrotron Radiation Source, Daresbury, UK. The wavelength was 0.978 Å, an Area Detector Systems Corporation Q4R charge-coupled device detector was used, and the front slits were set to 100 μm × 200 μm. Before phototransformation, a first GFPA dataset was recorded to 1.85-Å resolution (TABLE ONE). After phototransformation, the crystal was translated ∼50 μm, and a new dataset was recorded for the early photoproduct GFPL (TABLE ONE). Subsequently, the crystal was heated to 170 K with a ramp rate of 6 K/min and kept at this temperature for 15 min for structural annealing. The crystal was re-cooled to 100 K with a ramp rate of 6 K/min, translated by 50 μm, and the final GFPM dataset was recorded (TABLE ONE). The crystal volume exposed to x-ray radiation for more than a single set of images was minimized by the translation, and the beam overlap between datasets was estimated to be <50 μm. The data collection and integration statistics were very similar for all three datasets (TABLE ONE), indicating that no appreciable radiation damage had occurred.TABLE ONEData-collection and refinement statisticsStructureGFPAGFPLGFPMSpace groupC2C2C2Unit cell (a, b, c)/Å, (α, β, γ)/°154.97 52.73 141.63 90.00 120.01 90.00155.31 52.82 141.94 90.00 120.07 90.00154.82 52.66 141.88 90.00 120.27 90.00Resolution rangeaValues for the highest resolution shell are given after the slash./Å37.53−1.85/1.95−1.8536.76−1.85/1.95−1.8533.15−1.85/1.95−1.85Total/unique reflections388728/85082470013/85530496456/85637CompletenessaValues for the highest resolution shell are given after the slash./%97.5/86.097.6/86.697.3/84.0Multiplicity3.0/2.23.7/2.73.9/2.9I/σ(I)aValues for the highest resolution shell are given after the slash.6.7/4.25.5/2.95.7/2.8RsymaValues for the highest resolution shell are given after the slash.bRsym=∑|I-〈I〉|∑I./%0.066/0.1720.084/0.2480.080/0.262Model refinement statisticsProtein chains per asymmetric unit444Protein atoms/solvent atoms (per asymmetric unit)7314/9227315/9227303/930Rwork/Rfree valuecRwork=∑|Fobs|-k|Fcalc|/∑|Fobs|. 5% of the reflections for the calculation of Rfree were randomly chosen in the GFPA dataset and copied to the GFPL and GFPM datasets.0.176/0.2150.179/0.2180.178/0.225Mean B-value/Å2All atoms18.920.022.2Protein atoms (chain A-D)16.0 18.9 16.9 18.417.1 20.0 18.0 19.419.3 22.3 20.6 21.9Water atoms29.731.231.6Bond length deviation root mean square delta/Å0.0120.0130.013Bond angles deviation root mean square delta/°1.481.511.52Restrained B-values (bond/angle)/Å20.73/1.450.77/1.540.82/1.64a Values for the highest resolution shell are given after the slash.b Rsym=∑|I-〈I〉|∑I.c Rwork=∑|Fobs|-k|Fcalc|/∑|Fobs|. 5% of the reflections for the calculation of Rfree were randomly chosen in the GFPA dataset and copied to the GFPL and GFPM datasets. Open table in a new tab Structure Solution and Refinement—The intensities were integrated with MOSFLM (19Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992Google Scholar) and scaled with SCALA (20Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). 5% of the reflections were selected for Rfree calculations, and the same set was selected in the photo-product (FL) and high temperature-annealed (FM) data-sets. Molecular replacement was performed with MOLREP (20Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar), using 1HCJ as a search model. Building was performed using O, and the structures were refined with REFMAC (20Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Vol. F: Crystallography of Biological Macromolecules. Dordrecht, Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands2001: 720-722Google Scholar) without using non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. Refinement of chromophore atoms in the phenolic and imidazolinone rings were done with increased planar restraints. The intensities of the 100 K photoproduct (IL) and the 170 K annealed (IM) diffraction experiments were scaled to the first, dark (IA) dataset using SCALEIT (20Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar), with refinement of scale factors and anisotropic B-factors. IL and IM were scaled to IA with 82,131 and 82,242 common reflections, 1.001 and 1.006 scale factors, R-factors of 0.080 and 0.15, and error-weighted R-factors of 0.078 and 0.11, respectively. Normal probability analysis showed a value of δ(real)/δ(expected) = 1.3 and 1.4 for centric and acentric reflections for the scaling of IL to IA, δ(real)/δ(expected) = 1.9 and 2.0 for scaling of IM to IA, and δ(real)/δ(expected) = 1.2 and 1.4 for scaling of IM to IL. The fitted slopes of the normal probability plots were constant for all resolution bins and had near zero intercepts. The isomorphous differences were distributed normal in all resolutions bins for the scalings performed. FL - FA, FM - FL, and FM - FA difference electron density maps were calculated using FFT (20Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar), with rejection of a (high frequency Fourier term) outlier, and used to aid the model building of the photo-product and annealed structures. The final FL - FA and FM - FL difference maps shown in Figs. 2 and 3C were calculated using phases from the GFPA and the GFPL structures after complete refinement, respectively. For modeling water molecules in the GFPL and thermally annealed GFPM structures that are different from those in the GFPA structure, the criterion applied was that convincing 2Fo - Fc density was present as well as density in Fo - Fc omit maps. With contouring of the FL - FA difference map at an intensity of 3σ, rather than 5σ (Fig. 2, A-C), additional positive and negative difference electron density is revealed significantly further away from the chromophore, covering a large part of the volume of the protein and its hydration shell. At this contouring level, differences between the four chains become apparent, whereas the very strong signals (>5σ) are more similar in the four different chains Mutagenesis—The T203H/Q69L double mutant was created starting from an expression construct for PA-GFP (T203H) (22Lippincott-Schwartz J. Patterson G.H. Science. 2003; 300: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz, using the QuikChange (Stratagene) protocol for the Q69L mutation using primer sequences CAGCTACGGCGTGCTGTGCTTCAGCCGC and GCGGCTGAAGCACAGCACGCCGTAGCTG. Static Infrared Measurements—A cryo-loop containing either a hydrated GFP film equilibrated at 33% relative humidity or a GFP solution in 75% glycerol was mounted on an Fourier transform infrared microscope, and data were recorded at 2 cm-1 resolution with the sample temperature controlled by a cold nitrogen gas stream flowing at 5 liters/min. Either the 254 nm line of a mercury lamp or the 413 nm line of a krypton laser illuminated the sample until no further increases in the photogenerated CO2 bands were observed. For room temperature measurements, solutions were mounted between calcium fluoride windows separated by a 15-μm spacer. IR difference spectra recorded with wild type GFP were identical to the GFPuv (F99H/M153T/V163A (23Crameri A. Whitehorn E.A. Tate E. Stemmer W.P. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar)) solution data presented in Fig. 3. GFPuv was used for most solution studies because of better solubility relative to wild type GFP. Picosecond Time-resolved Infrared Measurements—Time-resolved IR measurements were recorded at the PIRATE facility at the Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory (24Towrie M. Grills D.C. Dyer J. Weinstein J.A. Matousek P. Barton R. Bailey P.D. Subramaniam N. Kwok W.M. Ma C. Phillips D. Parker A.W. George M.W. Appl. Spectrosc. 2003; 57: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The 400 nm second harmonic of a Ti:sapphire laser excited a 6-8 mm solution of GFPuv, prepared in either H2O or D2O, and loaded in a 6- to 12-μm path length infrared cell. Difference frequency mixing of the signal and idler of an optical parametric amplifier in a type I AgGaS2 crystal generated a 100-nJ IR pulse with 200-fs pulse width centered at 1720 cm-1 (150 cm-1 full width at half-maximum), which was separated into probe and reference pulses. The IR probe pulse and 400 nm excitation pulse were focused into the sample to ∼150-μm diameter spot size. The transmitted probe pulse was dispersed with 4-cm-1 resolution in a grating spectrograph, detected with a 64-element MCT array, and normalized pixel-by-pixel and pulse-by-pulse with respect to the similarly detected reference pulse. Reported spectra are differences between measurements of probe pulses recorded in the presence and absence of the excitation pulse, optically delayed by the given time with respect to the excitation pulse. The instrument response time was 400 fs. Raster scanning and periodic sample replacement avoided photodegradation, as confirmed by monitoring the visible absorption spectra. Structure of the GFPA Ground State—The space group of the crystals was C2, with four monomers in the asymmetric unit. Structure refinement and building showed differences between the four chains, and hence no NCS restraints were applied at any stage. The asymmetric unit contained two dimers that have an interface that is centered on Phe-223, similar to other dimer structures (12van Thor J.J. Gensch T. Hellingwerf K.J. Johnson L.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In the chromophore region of the A structure, in particular with respect to the conformation of Glu-222 and Thr-203, the electron density supports a structure that is similar to the wild type crystal structure 1GFL solved at 1.9-Å resolution at pH 6.8 (13Yang F. Moss L.G. Phillips Jr., G.N. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1246-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). In particular, the Glu-222 side chain is not in a rotamer conformation, but is best modeled and refined with the angles χ1 = 62°, χ2 = 153°, and χ3 =-145°, although the electron density indicates some disorder of the side chain (11van Thor J.J. Zanetti G. Ronayne K. Towrie M. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2005; 109: 16099-16108Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This conformation contrasts with the wild type structure solved at 2.13-Å resolution at pH 3.9, where Glu-222 was modeled with angles χ1 =-29°, χ2 =-160°, and χ3 =-69° (1EMB (7Brejc K. Sixma T.K. Kitts P.A. Kain S.R. Tsien R.Y. Ormo M. Remington S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2306-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar)). Also, in our GFPA structure, there is no indication of an alternative rotamer conformation of Thr-203, as modeled in the low pH structure (7Brejc K. Sixma T.K. Kitts P.A. Kain S.R. Tsien R.Y. Ormo M. Remington S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2306-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). X-ray Structure and IR Spectroscopy of the 100 K GFPL Photoproduct—In contrast with cryogenically trapped intermediates of other photoactive proteins (15Edman K. Nollert P. Royant A. Belrhali H. Pebay-Peyroula E. Hajdu J. Neutze R. Landau E.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 16Teng T.Y. Srajer V. Moffat K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 17Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Phillips Jr., G.N. Sweet R.M. Nature. 1994; 371: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), unambiguous and strong structural changes at 100 K are evident from the unaveraged FL - FA difference electron density map (Fig. 2, A-C). The normal distribution of isomorphous differences in all resolution bins, the correspondence between R-factors and error-weighted R-factors in the resolution ranges, the fall off of isomorphous differences with increasing resolution, and constant slope of the normal probability plots over all resolution bins all indicate the statistical relevance and low noise level of the strong electron density present in the difference Fourier map. Strong negative features in excess of 20σ cover the Oϵ1, Oϵ2, and Cδ atoms of Glu-222 in all four chains, resulting from the specific and complete light-induced decarboxylation of this residue in crystals of GFP. Net charge transfer from Glu-222 to the chromophore drives many additional conformational changes in the chromophore and its immediate environment, and difference density indicates greater active site disorder in GFPL than in GFPA (Fig. 2). The changes include perturbation of the Gln-69 side chain, which moves away from Thr-203 by hinging around the Cα atom. The Cys-70 side chain becomes more disordered, and the distance from the sulfur to the Val-68 carbonyl oxygen increases by 0.15 ± 0.01 Å in the refined coordinates, consistent with the FL - FA difference density (Fig. 2). Spectroscopic changes also reflect these substantial structural responses to chromophore ionization in both crystals and solutions. The pronounced shift of the visible absorption (Fig. 3B) and prominent spectral changes in the congested 1000-1800 cm-1 region of the GFPL - GFPA IR difference spectrum (Fig. 3A) resemble those previously attributed to ionization of the chromophore (25van Thor J.J. Pierik A.J. Nugteren-Roodzant I. Xie A. Hellingwerf K.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16915-16921Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In particular, isotope substitutions and density functional theory calculations on a model compound for the GFP chromophore (26He X. Bell A.F. Tonge P.J. Org. Lett. 2002; 4: 1523-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) suggest assignment of positive bands associated with vibrations of the phenol group (1497 and 1582 cm-1), the imidazolinone ring (1537 cm-1), and the bridging carbon (1615 cm-1) of the anionic chromophore in the room temperature IR difference spectrum (11van Thor J.J. Zanetti G. Ronayne K. Towrie M. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2005; 109: 16099-16108Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 25van Thor J.J. Pierik A.J. Nugteren-Roodzant I. Xie A. Hellingwerf K.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16915-16921Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We identify a new feature having positive and negative peaks at 1697 and 1691 cm-1 with a perturbation of the side chain C=O stretch of Gln-69, based on its characteristic frequency (27Barth A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 141-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) and the absence of this feature in the phototransformed Q69L/T203H mutant (Fig. 4). We found that the Q69L/T203H double mutant can readily be phototransformed, in contrast to the Q69L single mutant, for which the chromophore is ionized in equilibrium (28Delagrave S. Hawtin R.E. Silva C.M. Yang M.M. Youvan D.C. Biotechnology (N. Y.). 1995; 13: 151-154PubMed Google Scholar). Decreased absorbance of a 2552 cm-1 S-H stretching mode (Fig. 3D) is consistent with weakening of the Cys-70 Sγ-H... O Val-68 hydrogen bond in GFPL. The appearance of multiple overlapping CO2 bands (Fig. 3C) suggests significant disorder for the photogenerated CO2. Together with the dominant negative contributions to the difference electron density, the additional disorder of the CO2 molecule underscores the unexpected mobility of the chromophore environment at 100 K. Polarized IR data on oriented single crystals 3G. Y. Georgiev, J. J. van Thor, and J. T. Sage, manuscript in preparation. supports the presence of the Cys-70... Val-68 hydrogen bond and indicates a minimum of three CO2 environments with distinct frequencies and orientations. Negative signals corresponding to crystallographic waters in the chromophore vicinity also contribute prominently to the FL - FA difference map, accompanied by weaker positive features. These include an incompletely hydrogen-bonded water cluster Z245, Z80, and Z220 (numbering for chain A of GFPA), which initially hydrogen bonds to the side chains of Gln-69, Thr-203, and Glu-222, to the amide nitrogen of Val 68, and to Oγ2 of the chromophore (Fig. 2), but undergoes significant restructuring to form a new stable H-bonded position in the fully relaxed GFPR photoproduct state (12van Thor J.J. Gensch T. Hellingwerf K.J. Johnson L.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The D2O-hydrated GFPL - GFPA IR difference spectrum (Fig. 3E) reveals signals in a frequency range characteristic for “dangling” O-D bonds. The dipoles of these weakly hydrogen-bonded waters can presumably reorient to stabilize the ionized chromophore more rapidly than in bulk solvent. Solution measurements at 100 K confirmed that selected features of the GFPL - GFPA IR difference spectrum (Fig. 3) develop with identical kinetics, ruling out significant contributions from additional photo-chemical processes at this temperature. Moreover, identical IR spectral changes, including the appearance of CO2 bands, resulted from illumination at either 254 or 413 nm. The latter measurement indicates the absence of significant heating effects, even with the order of magnitude reduction in the phototransformation quantum yield (12van Thor J.J. Gensch T. Hellingwerf K.J. Johnson L.N. Nat."

The NBS gene product, NBS1 (p95) or nibrin, is a part of the hMre11 complex, a central player associated with double strand break repair. We previously demonstrated that c-Myc directly activates NBS1 expression. Here we have shown that constitutive expression of NBS1 in Rat1a and HeLa cells induces/enhances their transformation. Repression of endogenous NBS1 levels using short interference RNA reduces the transformation activity of two tumor cell lines. Increased NBS1 expression is observed in 40–52% of non-small cell lung carcinoma, hepatoma, and esophageal cancer samples. NBS1 overexpression stimulates phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity, leading to increased phosphorylation levels of Akt and its downstream targets such as glycogen synthase kinase 3β and mammalian target of rapamycin in different cell lines and tumor samples. Transformation induced by NBS1 overexpression can be inhibited by a PI3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002). Repression of endogenous Akt expression by short interference RNA decreases the transformation activity of Rat1a cells overexpressing NBS1. These results indicate that overexpression of NBS1 is an oncogenic event that contributes to transformation through the activation of PI3-kinase/Akt.

However, NBS1 is expressed in highly proliferating tissues developmentally (8Wilda M. Demuth I. Concannon P. Sperling K. Hameister H. Hum. Mol.

Activation of PI3-kinase results in the phosphorylation of Akt (protein kinase B-PKB) to achieve its activation (15Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Ahmed N.N. Datta K. Malstrom S. Stokoe D. McCormick F. Feng J. Tsichlis P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Activated Akt then regulates a wide range of target proteins that control cell proliferation (e.g. glycogen synthase kinase-3β, GSK3β), survival (e.g. BAD), and cell growth (e.g. mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR) (16Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nature Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5130) Google Scholar). The PI3-kinase/Akt pathway obviously regulates processes that are critical for tumorigenesis (17Testa J.R. Bellacosa A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10983-10985Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar), and altered expression or mutation of many components of this pathway has been implicated in human cancer (16Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nature Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5130) Google Scholar, 18Luo J. Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that NBS1 expression is directly activated by c-Myc oncoprotein (19Chiang Y.C. Teng S.C. Su Y.N. Hsieh F.C. Wu K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19286-19291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The c-Myc oncoprotein regulates diverse biological processes such as cell proliferation, growth, differentiation, and metabolism (20Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Deregulated overexpression of c-myc occurs in a broad range of human cancers and is often associated with aggressive, poorly differentiated phenotypes (21Pelengaris S. Khan M. Evan G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 764-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). From the observation that overexpression of NBS1 increases cell proliferation rate and DNA synthesis (19Chiang Y.C. Teng S.C. Su Y.N. Hsieh F.C. Wu K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19286-19291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we speculated that overexpression of NBS1 might play a role in the process of tumorigenesis. Here we have shown that overexpression of NBS1 induces transformation activity. Increased NBS1 expression is observed in some types of human cancer. Overexpression of NBS1 stimulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, leading to the activation of Akt and its downstream target proteins. These results demonstrate that overexpression of NBS1 is an oncogenic event that induces transformation through the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt. Cell Lines and Plasmids—Lymphoblastoid cell lines (CB33, CBMyc·Max, CBMax) and RatNBS lines were previously described (19Chiang Y.C. Teng S.C. Su Y.N. Hsieh F.C. Wu K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19286-19291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The Rat1a and Saos2 cell lines were obtained from Dr. R. Dalla-Favera (Columbia University, New York). A549 cell line is a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) line. The pHeBOCMVNBS plasmid was previously described (19Chiang Y.C. Teng S.C. Su Y.N. Hsieh F.C. Wu K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19286-19291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). HeLaNBS and Saos2NBS cell lines were generated by transfecting the HeBOCMVNBS plasmid into HeLa or Saos2 cells, and the cells were selected under G418 (250 μg/ml). Vector controls for all cell lines were generated by transfecting either pHeBOCMV, pSV2Neo, or pSV2Hygro (22Wu K.J. Polack A. Dalla-Favera R. Science. 1999; 283: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The pSUPERNBSi and pSUPERAktiR (knockdown rat Akt1) plasmids were generated by inserting the oligonucleotides 5′-GATCCCCTTCAGAATAGAGTATGAGCCTTCAAGAGAGGCTCATACTCTATTCTGAATTTTTGGAAA-3′ and 5′-GATCCCCCAACTTCTCAGTGGCACAATTTCAAGAGAATTGTGCCACTGAGAAGTTGTTTTTGGAAA-3′ into the pSUPER plasmid provided by Dr. R. Agami (23Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R.A. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3963) Google Scholar). HeLaNBSi, A549NBSi, and RatNBSAkti cell lines were generated by transfecting pSV2Neo+pSUPERNBSi, pSV2Neo+pSUPERNBSi, or pSV2Hygro+pSUPERAktiR into HeLa, A549, or RatNBS cells, respectively, and the cells were selected under G418 (300 μg/ml) or Hygromycin (150 μg/ml). Wortmannin and LY294002 were purchased from Sigma. Western Blot Analysis—60 μg of Rat1a or A549 cellular extracts or 100 μg of HeLa or Saos2 cellular extracts were loaded to an 8% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were probed with an anti-NBS1 antibody (C-8580; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. or Cell signaling Technology, Inc.), phospho-Akt (Ser-473) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Akt antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), phospho-GSK3β (Ser-9) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), phospho-mTOR (Ser-2448) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), and a polyclonal anti-β-actin antibody (C-11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) as a control for protein loading. Signals were revealed using an ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Data shown here are representative of two or more experiments from independent cell cultures. Soft Agar Colony Assay—The stable clones were plated at three different cell densities (5 × 103, 104, 2 × 104 or 2.5 × 103, 5 × 103, 104) using standard assay conditions as mentioned (22Wu K.J. Polack A. Dalla-Favera R. Science. 1999; 283: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) except that 15% fetal calf serum was used. Data shown here are representative of two or more experiments from independent cell cultures. Treatment with LY294002 was performed by putting LY294002 (50 μm) into both bottom and top agar. Nude Mice Tumorigenicity Assays and Drug Treatment—Tumorigenicity assays were performed as described (24Wood L.J. Mukherjee M. Dolde C.E. Xu Y. Maher J.F. Bunton T.E. Williams J.B. Resar L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5490-5502Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Five mice were used for injection of each clone. Animals were monitored at periodic intervals for the appearance of tumors up to 25 days after injection. Data shown here are representative of two experiments from independent nude mice injections (Fig. 1). Drug (LY294002) treatment of tumor-bearing nude mice was performed as described (25Hu L. Hofmann J. Lu Y. Mills G.B. Jaffe R.B. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1087-1092PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 days after inoculation, one group of mice (n = 4) was treated with LY294002 intraperitoneally (100 mg/kg BW) on alternative days for 2 weeks. The second group of mice (n = 4) received solvent (Me2SO + sunflower oil) alone. RNA Purification from Tumor Samples, RT-PCR, and Real-time PCR Analysis (26Shih J.Y. Lee Y.C. Yang S.C. Hong T.M. Huang C.Y. Yang P.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 1392-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar)—We obtained fresh-frozen lung cancer, hepatoma, and esophageal cancer samples from the Departments of Surgery and Internal Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital. We prepared RNA from fresh-frozen tumor and normal tissues using an RNAeasy kit (Qiagen). We carried out RT-PCR analysis using 1 μg of total RNA isolated from normal and tumor tissues. The primer sequences of NBS1 and TBP (TATA-binding protein internal control) used in RT-PCR were: NBS1, 5′-GAAATTGAGTTCCGCAGTTGTC-3′ and 5′-GGATTCTCATCTTAGCCAAAG-3′; TBP, 5′-CACGAACCACGGCACTGAT-3′ and 5′-CGTCGTCTTCCTGAATCCCT-3′. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed in a PRISM7700 sequence detection system (ABI) with the preset PCR program. The primer sequences used in real-time PCR were: NBS1, 5′-ATGGAGGCCATATTTCCATGAC-3′ and 5′-CAAGCAGCCAGAACTTGGAAG-3′; TBP, 5′-TGGTGGTGTTGTGAGAAGATGG-3′ and 5′-CGGTGGGCACTTACAGAAGG-3′ (26Shih J.Y. Lee Y.C. Yang S.C. Hong T.M. Huang C.Y. Yang P.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 1392-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). 0.1 μg of cDNA and 80 μm of each primer were used for reaction in 1× SYBR Green mixture (ABI) in a total volume of 50 μl. Increased NBS1 expression in tumor tissue is defined as >100% increase over normal tissue. Data shown here are representative of results from two experiments. PI3-Kinase Assay—PI3-kinase assays were performed as described (27Ueki K. Algenstaedt P. Mauvais-Jarvis F. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8035-8046Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates of cell extracts with an anti-p110α antibody (sc-7174; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were used to perform assay. The phosphorylated lipids were visualized by autoradiography and measured by phosphorimaging. Data shown here are representative of results from two experiments and using different clones. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)—The formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded lung cancer samples were cut in 6-μm sections on poly-l-lysine-coated slides. Following deparaffinization with xylene (10 min twice), sections were rehydrated through decreasing concentrations of ethanol (100% × 2 times, 95, 85, and 70%) and washed for 5 min. For antigen retrieval, the specimens were heated in 10 mm citrate buffer (pH 6.0) using a microwave for 12 min. For frozen specimens from dissected tumors in nude mice, 6-μm thick sections of tumor were cut and fixed in acetone, air-dried, and subsequently bathed in Tris-buffered saline solution (pH 7.6). The endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide. For NBS1 and phosphorylated Akt IHC staining, a goat polyclonal anti-NBS1 antibody (1:100) (sc-8580; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and an IHC-specific anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) antibody (1:150)(number 9277S; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) were incubated at 4 °C overnight, respectively. After reacting with a biotinylated secondary antibody for 30 min, antigen-antibody reactions were visualized using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (DAKO LSAB kit; DAKO, Los Angeles, CA), with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole as the chromogen. All slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Overexpression of NBS1 Induced/enhanced Transformation—To explore the role of NBS1 overexpression in the induction of transformation, we used soft agar and nude mice tumorigenicity assays to test whether overexpression of NBS1 could cause the transformation of Rat1a fibroblasts and form tumors. NBS1-overexpressing Rat1a clones (RatNBS) (19Chiang Y.C. Teng S.C. Su Y.N. Hsieh F.C. Wu K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19286-19291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) were used, and the result showed that four different Rat-NBS clones overexpressing NBS1, but not control RatCMV clones, had acquired clonogenicity in soft agar at levels comparable with those displayed by c-Myc-transformed Rat1a cells (RatMyc) (Fig. 1A), roughly correlating with the amount of NBS1 detectable by immunoprecipitation-Western blot analysis (Ref. 19Chiang Y.C. Teng S.C. Su Y.N. Hsieh F.C. Wu K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19286-19291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar and data not shown). Fig. 1B is a representative picture of soft agar colony assay. Injection of these Rat-NBS clones into nude mice caused rapid tumor growth and visible tumor formation compared with no tumor formation in the control RatCMV clones (Fig. 1C). The tumors generated from RatNBS cells were visible by day 10. The average size of the tumors was ∼15 mm in diameter by day 13 (Fig. 1C), demonstrating the in vivo tumorigenicity of RatNBS cells. We also tested whether overexpression of NBS1 is capable of enhancing transformation in a cancer cell line by generating HeLa cells overexpressing NBS1. Fig. 1D shows the increased expression of NBS1 in three different HeLa clones (HeLaNBS) versus the control HeLa clone. The soft agar colony formation activity increased ∼90–150% in these HeLaNBS clones compared with the control HeLa clone (data not shown), demonstrating the ability of NBS1 overexpression to enhance transformation activity in HeLa cells. Clonal populations of HeLa cells transfected with NBS1 expression vector also showed increased colony formation (>100% above control) compared with HeLa cells transfected with control vector alone (data not shown). In addition, when these HeLaNBS clones were injected into nude mice, increased tumor volume was observed in these HeLaNBS clones (Fig. 1E). Fig. 1F is a representative picture taken from these nude mice at day 19. The HeLaNBS clones also had an increased cell proliferation rate and DNA synthesis compared with the control HeLa clone (data not shown). These results indicate that overexpression of NBS1 is capable of inducing/enhancing tumorigenicity of Rat1a/HeLa cells both in vitro and in vivo. siRNA-mediated Repression of Endogenous NBS1 Expression Reduced the Transformation Activity of Two Tumor Cell Lines—We tested whether the levels of NBS1 expression correlated with transformation activity by generating HeLa cells expressing short interference RNA (siRNA) to repress their endogenous NBS1 expression (23Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R.A. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3963) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows the three HeLaNBSi clones with decreased NBS1 protein levels versus the control HeLa clone. Soft agar colony formation activity decreased in these three HeLaNBSi clones versus the control HeLa clone (Fig. 2B). The levels of NBS1 roughly correlated with the levels of soft agar colony numbers. We also tested the in vivo tumorigenic activity of these HeLaNBSi clones by injecting these clones into nude mice. Fig. 2C shows the decreased tumor volume (∼55% of control) of two HeLaNBSi clones versus the control HeLa clone. The NSCLC line A549 was also used to test this correlation. Two A549 clones expressing siRNA to repress endogenous NBS1 expression were generated (Fig. 2D). Fig. 2E shows the decrease (∼40% of control) in soft agar colony numbers in the A549NBSi clones versus the control A549 clone. Nude mice tumorigenicity assays showed the decreased tumor volume (∼45% of control) of these A549NBSi clones versus the control A549 clone (Fig. 2F). These results demonstrate the correlation between the levels of NBS1 expression and in vitro/in vivo transformation activity in two different tumor cell lines. Increased NBS1 Expression Was Observed in a Certain Percentage of Some Different Human Cancer Samples—We wanted to test whether increased NBS1 expression occurs in human tumor samples. Twenty-nine pairs of human NSCLC samples (normal versus tumor tissues) were used to screen for NBS1 expression levels using RT-PCR analysis. Increased NBS1 expression was observed in 52% (15 of 29) of these lung cancer samples, indicating that increased NBS1 expression indeed occurred in human tumor samples. The RT-PCR results were confirmed using quantitative real-time PCR analysis (the fold of increase ranged from 2- to 6-fold). Fig. 3, A and B, shows the pictures of RT-PCR and real-time PCR results in some representative cases. NBS1 protein levels were also examined in these pairs of lung cancer samples, and their levels showed corresponding increases in samples with increased NBS1 mRNA expression. Fig. 3C shows the increased NBS1 protein levels in these representative pairs of lung cancer samples. Screening for increased NBS1 expression in hepatoma and esophageal cancer also showed certain percentages (48 and 40%) of increased NBS1 expression using RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR analysis (Fig. 3D). These results demonstrate that increased NBS1 expression occurs in a certain percentage of three types of human cancer. Overexpression of NBS1 Activated Akt and Led to the Activation of Its Downstream Target Proteins—To search for the signal transduction pathways that mediate transformation induced by NBS1 overexpression, we screened different signal transduction/apoptosis-related molecules for their contribution to transformation in NBS1-overexpressing cell lines. The panel includes extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, Bcl-2, Bax, Akt/PKB, etc. The results of the screening showed that only Akt was activated by NBS1 overexpression. Western blot analysis using an anti-phospho-Akt antibody showed that Akt phosphorylation levels were increased in RatNBS clones (Fig. 4A). This result was confirmed in an osteosarcoma cell line, Saos2 cells overexpressing NBS1 (Fig. 4A). In addition, the A549 clones expressing siRNA (A549NBSi) to repress endogenous NBS1 expression showed decreased Akt phosphorylation levels (Fig. 4B), correlating the levels of NBS1 expression with the levels of Akt phosphorylation. To demonstrate the stimulation of downstream targets by activated Akt, we examined different Akt downstream targets. Among them, GSK3β and mTOR were shown to be hyperphosphorylated in NBS1 overexpression status in RatNBS and Saos2NBS cells (Fig. 4A). Their levels of phosphorylation (GSK3β and mTOR) also decreased in NBS1 knockdown status in A549NBSi cells (Fig. 4B). To confirm that activation of Akt by NBS1 overexpression also occurred in human tumor samples, immunohistochemistry analysis using anti-NBS1 and anti-phospho-Akt antibodies was performed in NSCLC samples. The results showed that 13 of 15 NSCLC samples overexpressing NBS1 had increased Akt phosphorylation levels (data not shown). Representative IHC results are shown in Fig. 4, C–E. These results demonstrate that the levels of NBS1 correlate with the phosphorylation levels of Akt and its downstream targets, GSK3β and mTOR, in different cell lines and human tumor samples. Overexpression of NBS1 Stimulated PI3-Kinase Activity, Which Can Be Inhibited by PI3-Kinase-specific Inhibitors—To test whether the activation of Akt was induced by increased upstream PI3-kinase activity, we performed a PI3-kinase activity assay using RatCMV versus RatNBS cells (27Ueki K. Algenstaedt P. Mauvais-Jarvis F. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8035-8046Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The result showed that PI3-kinase activity indeed increased (∼90% above the control) in the RatNBS clone versus the control RatCMV clone (Fig. 5A). PI3-kinase activity in both clones can be inhibited by LY294002, a PI3-kinase-specific inhibitor. In addition, siRNA experiments to repress endogenous NBS1 levels in A549 cells (A549NBSi) caused a decrease in PI3-kinase activity (data not shown). These results demonstrate the stimulation of PI3-kinase activity by NBS1 overexpression. Both PI3-kinase inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin, also inhibited the Akt phosphorylation levels in the RatNBS clone (Fig. 5B), demonstrating the requirement for the stimulation of PI3-kinase, leading to activation of downstream Akt. We also tested whether LY294002 can inhibit the in vitro tumorigenicity of RatNBS clone using soft agar colony assays. Fig. 5C shows the almost complete inhibition of soft agar colony formation of RatNBS clone by LY294002. We performed experiments using LY294002 to treat nude mice injected with RatNBS cells to test the ability of LY294002 to inhibit RatNBS-induced tumors in vivo. Fig. 5D shows the inhibition (a decrease of ∼65%) of RatNBS tumor growth by LY294002 compared with injection with solvent alone. To test that the shrinkage of tumors was not due to nonspecific toxicity caused by LY294002, immunohistochemistry analysis of tumor tissues from the mice treated without or with LY294002 was performed. The result showed that tumor tissue not receiving LY294002 still had strong phospho-Akt staining, whereas tumor tissue receiving treatment did not have phospho-Akt staining (Fig. 5E). This result demonstrated that treatment with LY294002 decreased the Akt phosphorylation levels in RatNBS cells in vivo. Drug inhibition experiments on in vitro and in vivo tumorigenicity of the RatNBS clone show the ability of a PI3-kinase-specific inhibitor (LY294002) to inhibit tumorigenicity of RatNBS cells. Repression of Akt Expression by siRNA Decreased the Transformation Activity of Rat1a Cells Overexpressing NBS1—We tested whether activation of Akt is critical for transformation mediated by NBS1 overexpression. We used the siRNA approach to repress endogenous Akt expression in RatNBS cells. Fig. 6A shows decreased Akt expression in two different RatNBSAkti clones, expressing siRNA to repress endogenous Akt. Fig. 6B shows decreased soft agar colony formation activity in these two clones compared with the control RatNBS clone. Nude mice tumorigenicity assays showed decreased tumor volume (∼30% of control) of the RatNBSAkti clones versus the control RatNBS clone (Fig. 6C). This result demonstrates that the transformed phenotypes mediated by overexpression of NBS1 in RatNBS cells could be inhibited by siRNA-mediated repression of endogenous Akt. Activation of PI3-Kinase/Akt in c-Myc-overexpressing Lymphoblastoid Cells—To test whether overexpression of c-Myc will also activate PI3-kinase/Akt due to its direct activation of NBS1 expression, Western blot analysis was performed in lymphoblastoid cells overexpressing c-Myc and Max (CBMyc·Max) (19Chiang Y.C. Teng S.C. Su Y.N. Hsieh F.C. Wu K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19286-19291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Fig. 6D shows that indeed CBMyc·Max cells had increased levels of NBS1 and phosphorylated Akt compared with the control CB33 or CB33Max cells. In addition, PI3-kinase assay showed the increased PI3-kinase activity in CBMyc·Max cells (∼35% above control) (Fig. 6E). These results demonstrate that c-Myc overexpression directly activates NBS1 expression (19Chiang Y.C. Teng S.C. Su Y.N. Hsieh F.C. Wu K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19286-19291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), leading to subsequent downstream activation of the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway. In this report, we have demonstrated from the following evidence that overexpression of NBS1 is a dominant oncogenic event: 1) overexpression of NBS1 in Rat1a and HeLa cells induces/enhances their transformation activity; 2) the siRNA approach to repress endogenous NBS1 expression decreases the transformation activity of two tumor cell lines; 3) increased NBS1 expression occurs in a certain percentage of some types of human cancer; and 4) overexpression of NBS1 activates the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway. NBS1, as many other DNA repair checkpoint proteins, was initially known as a putative tumor suppressor to guard the integrity of genome (1Karran P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 2Petrini J.H.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 3D'Amours D. Jackson S.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). NBS1 carries out its checkpoint functions when it is phosphorylated by ATM protein after ionizing radiation (5Lim D.S. Kim S.T. Xu B. Maser R.S. Lin J. Petrini J.H. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2000; 404: 613-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 6Wu X. Ranganathan V. Weisman D.S. Heine W.F. Ciccone D.N. O'Neil T.B. Crick K.E. Pierce K.A. Lane W.S. Rathbun G.

Gatti R.A. Shay J.W. Ziv Y. Shiloh Y. Lee E.Y. Nature. 2000; 405: 474-477Crossref Scopus (435) Google Scholar). However, on the basis of the results presented here, we propose that NBS1 is also an oncoprotein. NBS1 overexpression-induced tumorigenicity may not act through the disruption of the functional Mre11/Rad50/NBS1 (MRN) complex, given the result that NBS1 knockdown cells (HeLaNBSi and A549NBSi), which contained reduced functional MRN complex, did not show enhanced transformation (Fig. 2). On the contrary, the siRNA approach to repress endogenous hMre11 levels increased the clonogenicity activity of HeLa cells, suggesting that the roles of NBS1 versus hMre11 related to transformation activity may be different (data not shown). The induction of tumorigenicity by NBS1 overexpression may go through the activation of an oncogenic pathway (PI3-kinase/Akt in this report) or the repression of a tumor suppressor, whereas mutation of NBS1 could also contribute to tumorigenesis through deficiency in DNA repair leading to genomic instability (1Karran P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 2Petrini J.H.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 3D'Amours D. Jackson S.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). However, deletions or mutations of NBS1 have never or infrequently been shown in some types of human cancer (28Stumm M. von Ruskowsky A. Siebert R. Harder S. Varon R. Wiecker P. Schlegelberger B. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 2001; 26: 60-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 29Varon R. Reis A. Henze G. Einsiedel H.G. Sperling K. Seeger K.

Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2002; 35: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that the incidence rate of increased NBS1 expression is higher than that of NBS1 mutation or deletion in some types of human cancer (Fig. 3D). The higher percentage (40–52%) of increased NBS1 expression in certain human tumor types (non-small cell lung carcinoma, hepatoma, and esophageal cancer) supports its role in promoting transformation/tumorigenesis. Recent studies to discover prognostic markers in uveal melanoma also show that NBS1 overexpression is a significant prognostic marker (32Ehlers J.P. Harbour J.W. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 1849-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which is consistent with our results. Increased NBS1 expression may be due to activation by c-Myc (19Chiang Y.C. Teng S.C. Su Y.N. Hsieh F.C. Wu K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19286-19291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) or other mechanisms because a low percentage (∼10%) of non-small cell lung cancer, hepatoma, and esophageal cancer showed c-Myc overexpression (33Sekido Y.

The proliferation-inducing function of NBS1 is suggested by the expression of NBS1 in highly proliferating tissues developmentally (8Wilda M. Demuth I. Concannon P. Sperling K. Hameister H. Hum. Mol.

In addition, the phenotypes of diminished expansion of the inner cell mass of mutant blastocysts (Nbs1 null) and cellular proliferation defects in Nbs1m/m mouse embryonic fibroblasts also support the role of NBS1 in cellular proliferation (11Zhu J.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1447-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). NBS1 overexpression causes the activation of PI3-kinase/Akt, which induces transformation through increasing cell proliferation and promoting cell growth by phosphorylating its various downstream target proteins (GSK3β and mTOR in this report) (16Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nature Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5130) Google Scholar). Repression of PI3-kinase/Akt pathway in NBS1-overexpressing cells by two different approaches (PI3-kinase-specific inhibitors and siRNA to repress endogenous Akt) establishes the connection between NBS1 and PI3-kinase/Akt pathway, although this result may not indicate that Akt is on an NBS1-induced signaling pathway directly. Activation of PI3-kinase/Akt by increased NBS1 expression argues against the contention that NBS1 overexpression is just an accompanying side event during cancer development. The molecular mechanisms of NBS1 overexpression-mediated activation of PI3-kinase/Akt remain to be determined. Overexpression of NBS1 may contribute to increased PI3-kinase/Akt activity in a certain percentage of non-small cell lung cancer cell lines and patient tumor samples (36Brognard J. Clark A.S. Ni Y.

Increased Akt phosphorylation levels were also shown in our NSCLC samples with NBS1 overexpression (data not shown and Fig. 4, D–E). Overexpression of NBS1 may promote anchorage-independent growth and invasiveness in different types of tumors through activation of PI3-kinase/Akt pathway (39Nakanishi K. Sakamoto M. Yasuda J.

Transformation of NBS1-overexpressing cell lines (RatNBS) can be inhibited by a PI3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002), providing therapeutic implications for tumors with increased NBS1 expression as demonstrated in the tumor samples examined (NSCLC, hepatoma, esophageal cancer) (Fig. 3) (18Luo J.

https://openalex.org/W2016249012,"PchB from Pseudomonas aeruginosa possesses isochorismate pyruvate lyase (IPL) and weak chorismate mutase (CM) activity. Homology modeling based on a structurally characterized CM, coupled with randomization of presumed key active site residues (Arg54, Glu90, Gln91) and in vivo selection for CM activity, was used to derive mechanistic insights into the IPL activity of PchB. Mutation of Arg54 was incompatible with viability, and the CM and IPL activities of an engineered R54K variant were reduced 1,000-fold each. The observation that position 90 was tolerant to substitution but position 91 was essentially confined to Gln or Glu in functional variants rules out involvement of Glu90 in general base catalysis. Counter to the generally accepted mechanistic hypothesis for pyruvate lyases, we propose for PchB a rare [1,5]-sigmatropic reaction mechanism that invokes electrostatic catalysis in analogy to the [3,3]-pericyclic rearrangement of chorismate in CMs. A common catalytic principle for both PchB functions is also supported by the covariance of the catalytic parameters for the CM and IPL activities and the shared functional requirement for a protonated Glu91 in Q91E variants. The experiments demonstrate that focusing directed evolution strategies on the readily accessible surrogate activity of an enzyme can provide valuable insights into the mechanism of the primary reaction.

Isochorismate pyruvate lyase (IPL) 2The abbreviations used are: IPL, isochorismate pyruvate lyase; CM, chorismate mutase; EcCM, CM domain of the bifunctional Escherichia coli chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydratase; PchBH, PchB protein with an N-terminal Met-His6-Ser-Ser-Gly sequence tag; WT, wild type.2The abbreviations used are: IPL, isochorismate pyruvate lyase; CM, chorismate mutase; EcCM, CM domain of the bifunctional Escherichia coli chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydratase; PchBH, PchB protein with an N-terminal Met-His6-Ser-Ser-Gly sequence tag; WT, wild type. catalyzes the conversion of isochorismate to salicylate and pyruvate (Fig. 1). This reaction is the committed step in the biosynthesis of salicylate-based siderophores in several pathogenic bacteria (1Snow G.A. Bacteriol.

Walsh C.T. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 223-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). In plants, salicylate produced from isochorismate is important for the plant defense mechanisms known as local and systemic acquired resistance (7Wildermuth M.C. Dewdney J. Wu G. Ausubel F.M. Nature. 2001; 414: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar, 8Durrant W.E. Dong X. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2004; 42: 185-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanism of the IPL transformation is unknown, but it is formally related to the elimination of pyruvate from other shikimic acid metabolites, including chorismate, 2-amino-2-deoxyisochorismate, and 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate, catalyzed by chorismate lyase, anthranilate synthase, and 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate lyase, respectively (9Walsh C.T. Liu J. Rusnak F. Sakaitani M. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1105-1129Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that proton abstraction by an enzymic general base initiates pyruvate elimination and aromatization in all of these pyruvate lyases (9Walsh C.T. Liu J. Rusnak F. Sakaitani M.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21768-21775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Its gene pchB is part of an operon for the biosynthesis of the siderophore pyochelin (4Serino L. Reimmann C. Baur H. Beyeler M. Visca P. Haas D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 14Serino L. Reimmann C. Visca P. Beyeler M. Della Chiesa V. Haas D. J.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The sequence of PchB is unrelated to the pyruvate lyases mentioned above but instead resembles well characterized chorismate mutases (CMs) of the AroQ class (16Gu W. Williams D.S. Aldrich H.C. Xie G. Gabriel D.W. Jensen R.A. Microb. Comp. Genomics. 1997; 2: 141-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 17MacBeath G. Kast P. Hilvert D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10062-10073Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), which catalyze the [3,3]-sigmatropic Claisen rearrangement of chorismate to prephenate (Fig. 1). PchB has the typical length of an AroQ domain with 20% overall sequence identity. Secondary structure prediction indicated that PchB has the same arrangement of α-helices as in EcCM (13Gaille C. Kast P. Haas D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21768-21775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the CM domain (AroQp) of the bifunctional Escherichia coli chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydratase, for which a crystal structure is available (18Lee A.Y. Karplus P.A. Ganem B. Clardy J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3627-3628Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The quaternary structure of PchB was found to be dimeric as it is for EcCM, and most catalytic residues of EcCM are conserved in PchB. Moreover, it was shown that pchB complements the CM deficiency of an E. coli mutant strain and that PchB has low CM activity in vitro (13Gaille C. Kast P. Haas D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21768-21775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Based on the structural and functional similarity with EcCM, a homology model was constructed for the presumed single active site of the catalytically promiscuous PchB (13Gaille C. Kast P. Haas D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21768-21775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, this model does not provide for a general base to abstract the C2 proton of isochorismate to initiate pyruvate elimination. Because the sequence alignment between PchB and AroQ CM domains is ambiguous at the C terminus, we have considered an alternative alignment involving multiple sequences from the AroQ family. The new alignment would position Glu90 in the vicinity of the C2 proton of the substrate, where it could serve as a general base, as required for the previously proposed general base mechanism (9Walsh C.T. Liu J. Rusnak F. Sakaitani M. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1105-1129Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar).

Other DNA manipulations were done using standard procedures (32Sambrook J. Russel D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd.

Restriction endonucleases T4 DNA polymerase and T4 DNA ligase were from New England Biolabs (Bioconcept, Allschwil, Switzerland). HotStarTaq DNA polymerase and the PCR buffer were from Qiagen (Basel, Switzerland). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland). DNA sequencing using the BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit was performed on an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). All other chemicals were from Fluka/Sigma-Aldrich (Buchs, Switzerland). Engineering of the pchB Expression System—Plasmid pKIL4-HNW (4,873 bp) carries pchB modified to encode PchBH, a version of PchB with an N-terminal Met-His6-Ser-Ser-Gly sequence tag for ease of purification. pKIL4-HNW was constructed by ligating a 4,529-bp NdeI-SpeI fragment of pMG211 and a 344-bp NdeI/SpeI-digested PCR fragment generated with primers 111-ILS (5′-ACCGATGTCATATGCACCATCATCATCATCATTCTTCTGGTATGATGAAAACTCCCGAAGACT-3′) and 112-ILN (5′-CGATACACTAGTTATTATGCGGCACCGCGGGTCTGGCGCCAGTACTTGAT-3′) using pME6152 as template (underlined letters mark restriction sites used for subcloning of PCR fragments). pKSS-TB (2,996 bp) carries a 5′- and 3′-truncated pchB fragment that served as the template for assembling the pchB libraries by PCR. It was constructed by ligating the 2,903-bp EcoRI-SacI fragment of pKSS and the 93-bp EcoRI/SacI-digested PCR fragment generated with primers 113-ETES (5′-CCATAGGAATTCATGCGATGCTCCCCGAGCG-3′) and 114-STEN (5′-CCATAGGAGCTCTGATGATCTGCGCGAACAGTC-3′) on template pKIL4-HNW. The pchB expression plasmid pKIL10A-W was constructed in four consecutive steps: pMG211 (4,690 bp) → pMG211-dR (4,105 bp) → pKIL10-HNW (4,288 bp) → pKIL10A-0 (5,207 bp) → pKIL10A-W (4,288 bp). pMG211-dR is pMG211 with the nahR gene (33Schell M.A. Wender P.E.

It carries the 5′ region of pchB followed by a newly introduced NheI site and the pheS gene as a stuffer fragment. The plasmid was constructed by ligating the 3,962-bp SacII-NdeI fragment of pKIL10-HNW, the 1,083-bp NheI/SacII-digested stuffer fragment generated by PCR with primers 117-NASS (5′-GTCAGAGCTAGCCAGGCGTCAGATGTT-3′) and T7PRO2 (23Gamper M.

For an independent positive control for in vivo complementation experiments, pKSECM-W (4,259 bp), which carries the EcCM gene under the control of Psal and PT7, was assembled by ligating the 315-bp NdeI-SpeI fragment of pKECMB-W (31MacBeath G. Kast P. Hilvert D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with the 3,944-bp NdeI-SpeI fragment from pKIL10A-0. Construction of pchB Libraries—The two partially randomized gene libraries ME1 and ME2 were constructed by PCR amplification of the truncated pchB gene on pKSS-TB (template) using either the degenerate primer pair 120-LMES (5′-GTCAGAGCTAGCGAGGCaGCGATTCCGGCGCCaGAGNNKGTCGCaGCGATGCTCCCCGAGCG-3′) and 121-LMEN (5′-GTCAAACCGCGGGTCTGaCGCCAGTACTTGATMNNMNNaGCGATGTACCAGTGGATGATCTGCGCGAACAGTC-3′) for ME1 or the pair 118-LWTS and 121-LMEN for ME2, respectively (randomized codons in boldface; K = equimolar concentrations of T and G during primer synthesis; M = equimolar concentrations of A and C; N = equimolar concentrations of all four bases). For the library PCR, 10 ng of template DNA, 50 pmol of primers, 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 2.5 units of HotStarTaq DNA polymerase in 50 μl of PCR buffer (Qiagen) were used. The reaction mixture was incubated at 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 25 PCR cycles (1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 51 °C, 1 min at 72 °C) and a final extension step (7 min at 72 °C). The purified PCR products were digested with NheI and SacII. Purified insert (164 bp, 0.2 pmol) and acceptor fragments (4,124 bp, 0.2 pmol) were ligated for 16 h at 15 °C. The ligation products were desalted with the Jetquick PCR Purification Kit (Genomed) and eluted in 2 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). One quarter of the ligated plasmids were electroporated into Phe and Tyr auxotrophic KA12/pKIMP-UAUC cells (20Kast P. Asif-Ullah M. Jiang N. Hilvert D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In Vivo Selection for PchB Variants with CM Activity—The suspension of transformed cells was washed three times with 1× M9 salts (6 mg/ml Na2HPO4, 3 mg/ml KH2PO4, 1 mg/ml NH4Cl, and 0.5 mg/ml NaCl) (32Sambrook J. Russel D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). M9c/P + F minimal medium used for selection is based on 1× M9 salts and additionally contained 0.2% (w/v) d-(+)-glucose, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 5 μg/ml thiamine-HCl, 5 μg/ml 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 5 μg/ml 4-aminobenzoic acid, 5 μg/ml 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 0.1 mm FeSO4, 20 μg/ml l-tryptophan, 100 μg/ml sodium ampicillin, 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 60 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and 20 μg/ml l-phenylalanine. The latter was added to accelerate growth of complementing clones. M9c/P + FY medium additionally contained 20 μg/ml l-tyrosine. For pouring plates, the reagents above were added to an autoclaved suspension of 15 g/liter of purified agar (Sigma-Aldrich, no. A-7002) after letting it cool to 55 °C. Aliquots of the washed cell suspensions were plated onto M9c/P + F minimal plates and incubated at 34 °C for 3 days to obtain colonies. Control platings to determine the library size were done on non-selective M9c/P + FY plates and incubated at 34 °C for 2 days. Library diversity was calculated as described previously (35Patrick W.M. Firth A.E. Blackburn J.M. Protein Eng. 2003; 16: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Single colonies growing on selective plates were restreaked onto LB Amp150 Cam30 agar plates (containing 150 μg/ml sodium ampicillin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol). Plasmid DNA from purified clones was isolated and sequenced with primer 04-T7TR (23Gamper M. Hilvert D. Kast P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14087-14094Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The complementation ability of representative selected library members was verified by retransforming the corresponding plasmids into KA12/pKIMP-UAUC and testing transformants on M9c/P + F and M9c/P + FY minimal media plates at 34 °C. Transformants with pKIL10A-W and pKIL10A-0 were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Construction of PchBH Mutants R54K and Q91N by Site-directed Mutagenesis—Plasmids pKIL10A-R54K (4,288 bp) and pKIL10A-Q91N (4,288 bp) coding for the R54K and the Q91N variants were constructed by PCR amplification of the truncated pchB gene on pKSS-TB with the primer pair 119-LWTN and 199-R54K (5′-GTCAGAGCTAGCGAGGCaGCGATTCCGGCGCCaGAGAAAGTCGCaGCGATGCTCCCCGAGCG-3′) and the pair 118-LWTS and 200-Q91N (5′-GTCAAACCGCGGGTCTGaCGCCAGTACTTGATGTTCTCaGCGATGTACCAGTGGATGATCTGCGCGAACAGTC-3′), respectively (mutated codons in boldface). The PCR products were digested with NheI and SacII, and the corresponding gel-purified insert (164 bp) and acceptor fragments (4,124 bp) were ligated. Growth Rates in Liquid Minimal Media—Growth rates were determined in liquid M9c/P + F and M9c/P + FY media (modified by omitting FeSO4 and increasing concentrations of sodium ampicillin to 150 μg/ml and isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 100 μm). For each mutant, a 5-ml M9c/P + FY preculture was inoculated with a single colony and grown overnight at 30 °C and 220 rpm. 40 μl of this preculture were diluted 1:100 into selective M9c/P + F medium (two parallel 4-ml cultures) and into non-selective M9c/P + FY medium (positive control). The cultures were again incubated at 30 °C and 220 rpm, and the OD600 nm was directly monitored in the test tubes using a Spectronic Helios Beta UV-Vis spectrophotometer equipped with a test tube holder (Thermo Electron Corp., West Palm Beach, FL). The exponential growth phase was fitted to an exponential equation to deduce growth rates defined as: μ =Δln(OD600 nm)/Δt. Gene Expression and Protein Purification—T7 RNA polymerase-driven pchB expression in E. coli strain KA13 (at 30 °C) and protein purification by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography were performed following published protocols (23Gamper M. Hilvert D. Kast P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14087-14094Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). All proteins examined in this work had the PchBH format. Protein purity was verified by SDS-PAGE using the Phast System (Amersham Biosciences, Otelfingen, Switzerland). Protein concentrations were determined by UV spectroscopy using molar extinction coefficients derived from the amino acid sequence using the Wisconsin Package Version 10.3 (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA), which gave results similar (within 10%) to those obtained with the Micro BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD spectra were measured with an Aviv CD spectrometer model 202 (Aviv Biomedical, Lakewood, NJ) at 25 °C in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) with 4 μm protein in a cuvette with a path length of 0.2 cm. Spectra were recorded five times for each sample from 260 to 195 nm and averaged. The step size and the bandwidth were 1 nm, and the averaging time at each wavelength was 1 s. Chorismate Mutase and Isochorismate Pyruvate Lyase Assays—Chorismate was produced using E. coli strain KA12 (36Grisostomi C. Kast P. Pulido R. Huynh J. Hilvert D. Bioorg. Chem. 1997; 25: 297-305Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and isochorismate was isolated from K. pneumoniae 62-1/pKS3-02 (28Schmidt K. Leistner E. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1995; 45: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Steady-state parameters (kcat and Km) were derived from the initial rates of substrate disappearance. For the CM reaction, the absorbance change at 274 nm (Δϵ274 = 2,630 m–1 cm–1) or 310 nm (Δϵ310 = 370 m–1 cm–1) was followed using an established protocol (37Mattei P. Kast P. Hilvert D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For the IPL reaction, an analogous on-line UV spectroscopic assay was established monitoring the absorbance decrease at 278 nm (Δϵ278 = 6,640 m–1 cm–1) as a function of time between isochorismate (ϵ278 = 8,300 m–1 cm–1; Ref. 38Rusnak F. Liu J. Quinn N. Berchtold G.A. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1425-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and the products of the conversion to salicylate (ϵ278 = 1,630 m–1 cm–1) and pyruvate (ϵ278 = 27 m–1 cm–1). Appropriate corrections for background reaction without enzyme were made. Substrate purity was assessed by determining the difference in absorption before and after full enzymatic conversion of a substrate sample. Substrate concentrations were varied between 7 μm and 2.3 mm (chorismate) or between 0.3 and 100 μm (isochorismate). Standard kinetics were measured in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) at 30 °C. For pH variation studies, universal buffer (as in Ref. 17MacBeath G. Kast P. Hilvert D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10062-10073Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar but without NaCl) was used between pH 4.9 and 9.0. Enzyme Inhibition Studies—Two inhibitors, the endo-oxabicyclic diacid 1 first described by Bartlett (39Bartlett P.A. Johnson C.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 7792-7793Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar) as a potent transition state analog of the CM reaction and adamantane-1-phosphonate 2 known to inhibit (some) CMs (40Chao H.S.-I. Berchtold G.A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2778-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), were probed for inhibition of both PchB activities (for the structures of 1 and 2, see Fig. 6A). Substrate concentrations were varied between 10 and 400 μm (for chorismate) and between 0.2 and 20 μm (for isochorismate) at fixed inhibitor concentrations, ranging from 0 to 12 μm for 1 and from 0 to 10 mm for 2. Ki values were derived from the replot of the slopes of Lineweaver-Burk reciprocal plots against inhibitor concentration (41Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations: How to Solve Mathematical Problems in General Biochemistry. 2nd. John Wiley & Sons, New York1976Google Scholar). Sequence Comparison and Homology Modeling—The primary sequence of PchB has ∼20% sequence identity with the CMs of the AroQ class (16Gu W. Williams D.S. Aldrich H.C. Xie G. Gabriel D.W. Jensen R.A. Microb. Comp. Genomics. 1997; 2: 141-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 17MacBeath G. Kast P. Hilvert D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10062-10073Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) available in GenBank™ (42Benson D.A. Karsch-Mizrachi I. Lipman D.J. Ostell J. Wheeler D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D34-D38Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). While homology over most of the protein is weak, identities include specific conserved amino acid residues known from structural and mechanistic studies to be important for the function of AroQ CMs (18Lee A.Y. Karplus P.A. Ganem B. Clardy J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3627-3628Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 25Taylor S.V. Kast P. Hilvert D. Angew. Chem. Int.

A. 1997; 94: 8491-8496Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the assignment of certain active site residues is not completely unambiguous. Two slightly different sequence alignments, based on a comparison between PchB and EcCM alone (alignment A) or on a multiple sequence alignment between PchB and other members of the AroQ class (alignment B), are shown in Fig. 2. Based on the x-ray structure of EcCM complexed with transition state analog inhibitor 1 (18Lee A.Y. Karplus P.A. Ganem B. Clardy J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3627-3628Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar), separate homology models for the active site of PchB were built for each sequence alignment. For model building, the relevant active site residues in the EcCM structure were exchanged with the corresponding residues of PchB. The protein backbone was kept rigid, while side chain rotamer conformations were chosen that minimized steric overlap. Of the about 20 amino acids shared by EcCM and PchB (see alignment A or B in Fig. 2), 10 belong to the set of 19 EcCM residues with side chains within 6 Å of any carbon or oxygen atom of bound inhibitor 1, indicating strong conservation of the mechanistic machinery between AroQ CMs and PchB. Fig. 3 shows a simplified schematic representation of both models of the active sites for PchB and of EcCM with bound substrates isochorismate and chorismate, respectively. Because the of arrangement potentially critical active site residues (Tyr87, Ile88, Glu90, and Gln91) differs in the two PchB models, two alternative reaction mechanisms for the IPL reaction can be postulated, depending on the structural model considered. In the past, pyruvate lyase reactions have been formulated as general base-dependent processes (9Walsh C.T. Liu J. Rusnak F. Sakaitani M. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1105-1129Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar), involving abstraction of a proton from the substrate (see “Discussion”). In alignment B and model B, the glutamate at position 90 could serve the role as general base in PchB (Figs. 2B and 3B). Subsequent cleavage of the ether bond could be facilitated by polarization of the ether oxygen by Lys43 lying on the opposite side of the active site. In contrast, the catalytic center in model A lacks such a base. The critical residues Lys43 and Gln91, whose homologs are thought to facilitate the cleavage of the ether bond of chorismate in EcCM (18Lee A.Y. Karplus P.A. Ganem B. Clardy J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3627-3628Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 44Liu D.R. Cload S.T. Pastor R.M. Schultz P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1"
https://openalex.org/W2012355926,"The mammalian non-histone “high mobility group” A (HMGA) proteins are the primary nuclear proteins that bind to the minor groove of AT-rich DNA. They may, therefore, influence the formation and/or repair of DNA lesions that occur in AT-rich DNA, such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) induced by UV radiation. Employing both stably transfected lines of human MCF7 cells containing tetracycline-regulated HMGA1 transgenes and primary Hs578T tumor cells, which naturally overexpress HMGA1 proteins, we have shown that cells overexpressing HMGA1a protein exhibit increased UV sensitivity. Moreover, we demonstrated that knockdown of intracellular HMGA1 concentrations via two independent methods abrogated this sensitivity. Most significantly, we observed that HMGA1a overexpression inhibited global genomic nucleotide excision repair of UV-induced CPD lesions in MCF-7 cells. Consistent with these findings in intact cells, DNA repair experiments employing Xenopus oocyte nuclear extracts and lesion-containing DNA substrates demonstrated that binding of HMGA1a markedly inhibits removal of CPDs in vitro. Furthermore, UV “photo-foot-printing” demonstrated that CPD formation within a long run of Ts (T18-tract) in a DNA substrate changes significantly when HMGA1 is bound prior to UV irradiation. Together, these results suggest that HMGA1 directly influences both the formation and repair of UV-induced DNA lesions in intact cells. These findings have important implications for the role that HMGA protein overexpression might play in the accumulation of mutations and genomic instabilities associated with many types of human cancers.

These findings have important implications for the role that HMGA protein overexpression might play in the accumulation of mutations and genomic instabilities associated with many types of human cancers. In most organisms, DNA helix-distorting bulky lesions are repaired by nucleotide excision repair (NER) 5The abbreviations used are: NER, nucleotide excision repair; HMG, high mobility group; CPD, cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; nt, nucleotide; PRRII, positive regulatory region II; IL-2Rα, interleukin-2 receptor α-subunit; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; HA, hemagglutinin; T4 endo V, T4 endonuclease V. involving the excision and replacement of 24–32 nt of the damaged DNA strand (1de Laat W.L. Jaspers N.G.J. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 768-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Many factors, such as (a) the type of DNA damage, (b) the DNA sequence surrounding the lesion, (c) the position in chromatin, and (d) the interactions with DNA-binding proteins, are known to affect the efficiency of NER (2Pfeifer G.P. Photochem. Photobiol. 1997; 65: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 3Balajee A.S. Bohr V.A. Gene. 2000; 250: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 4Smerdon M.J. Conconi A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 227-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For instance, inhibitory effects of nucleosomes on NER have been observed in vitro and in intact cells (5Liu X. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23729-23735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 6Kosmoski J.V. Ackerman E.J. Smerdon M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S.

Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 1133-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In a similar way, certain DNA-binding proteins, such as transcription factor IIIA and HMGB1 proteins, are known to repress NER at their cognate sequences (11Conconi A. Liu X. Koriazova L. Ackerman E.J. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1387-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 12Malina J. Kasparkova J. Natile G. Brabec V. Chem.

A.). 1994; 91: 10394-10398Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Conversely, transcriptional activators and the RNA polymerase II elongation complex are associated with enhanced repair of transcribing genes (14Frit P. Kwon K. Coin F. Auriol J. Dubaele S. Salles B. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1391-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Svejstrup J.Q. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in contrast to HMGB1, another member of the HMG protein superfamily that specifically binds to nucleosomes, HMGN1, has been shown to likewise enhance NER of UV-damaged DNA in vivo (16Birger Y. West K.L. Postnikov Y.V. Lim J.H. Furusawa T. Wagner J.P. Laufer C.S. Kraemer K.H. Bustin M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1665-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Stable DNA photoproducts produced by UV-induced covalent linkage between adjacent bases are prototypes of helical distorting, bulky lesions (17Douki T. Court M. Sauvaigo S. Odin F. Cadet J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11678-11685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Among a variety of possible UV-induced photoproducts, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) are the most abundant, stable forms (17Douki T. Court M. Sauvaigo S. Odin F. Cadet J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11678-11685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and, if unrepaired, are known to cause mutations and skin cancer (2Pfeifer G.P. Photochem. Photobiol. 1997; 65: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 18de Gruijl F.R. van Kranen H.J. Mullenders L.H. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 2001; 63: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). CPDs alter DNA structure from normal B-form, causing severe bending of the helical axis and disruption of Watson-Crick base pairs at the lesion sites (19Park H. Zhang K. Ren Y. Nadji S. Sinha N. Taylor J.-S. Kang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 2002; 99: 15965-15970Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Additionally, these lesion-induced distortions can obstruct progression of both RNA and DNA polymerases (20Tornaletti S. Hanawalt P.C. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 21Cordonnier A.M. Fuchs R.P. Mut. Res./DNA Repair. 1999; 435: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Besides direct blockage of polymerases, however, UV photoproducts can inhibit transcription by competing with normal promoters for transcription factors (22Vichi P. Coin F. Renaud J.-P. Vermeulen W. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Moras D. Egly J.-M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7444-7456Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) or possibly by interrupting formation of the transcription initiation complex (23Tommasi S. Swiderski P.M. Tu Y. Kaplan B.E. Pfeifer G.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15693-15703Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 24Liu X. Conconi A. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13710-13717Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The HMGA proteins are a family of non-histone chromosomal proteins that mediate a variety of biological functions, including regulation of gene transcription, modulation of chromatin structure, and induction of neoplastic transformation and metastatic progression (reviewed in Ref. 25Reeves R. Gene. 2001; 277: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). HMGA1a, HMGA1b (alternatively spliced forms of the HMGA1 proteins), and HMGA2 are principal members of the family and share distinct structural properties, such as three separate DNA-binding domains (called “AT-hooks”) and an acidic C-terminal domain (25Reeves R. Gene. 2001; 277: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). The HMGA proteins bind to nucleosomes (26Reeves R. Nissen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21137-21146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), four-way junctions (27Hill D. Pedulla M. Reeves R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2135-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), supercoiled DNA (28Nissen M.S. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4355-4360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and the minor groove of AT-rich sequences (29Solomon M.J. Strauss F. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1986; 83: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the structure of DNA (rather than its sequence) is thought to be important for HMGA binding. HMGA binding also induces changes in DNA structure which, in the case of gene transcriptional activation, lead to formation of multinucleoprotein complexes called “enhanceosomes” (30Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar) in the regulatory promoter elements of the gene. Finally, HMGA1a is a proto-oncogene (31Wood L.J. Maher J.F. Bunton T.E. Resar L.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4256-4261PubMed Google Scholar) that is overexpressed in a large number of different naturally occurring cancers (25Reeves R. Gene. 2001; 277: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) and whose experimental up-regulation induces metastatic progression and increased malignancy of neoplastic cells (32Reeves R. Edberg D.D. Li Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 575-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Consideration of these characteristics of CPDs and HMGA proteins led us to suspect that these proteins might participate in the process of DNA repair or DNA damage formation at AT-rich sequences. To investigate this possibility, we examined the consequences of HMGA1 overexpression and DNA binding on the repair of CPD lesions in intact cells and in vitro, respectively. The UV sensitivity and efficiency of global genomic repair was investigated in transgenic human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines containing an inducible HMGA1 gene. The results of these studies demonstrated that HMGA1 overexpression in human cells inhibits their ability to survive exposure to UV light and significantly reduces their efficiency for global genomic nucleotide excision repair. To further investigate the possible mechanism(s) involved in HMGA1 inhibition of NER in intact cells, in vitro repair experiments were also performed. A complex of the HMGA1 protein with the PRRII region of the IL-2Rα gene promoter (33John S. Reeves R. Lin J. Child R. Leiden J. Thompson C. Leonard W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1786-1796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was employed as a model for studying the effects of these proteins on both DNA damage and repair in a cell-free system. The results of these in vitro studies demonstrated that UV photoproducts do not markedly affect HMGA1 binding to lesion-containing DNA. Nevertheless, HMGA1 binding does change the CPD yield spectrum in a poly(dT) sequence (or T18-tract) of the PRRII fragment, suggesting that HMGA1 binding perturbs the DNA structure of the T18-tract, which leads to altered CPD formation. Most importantly, and in agreement with the results in living cells, we found that repair of CPDs in the PRRII DNA-HMGA complex by Xenopus oocyte nuclear extracts is strongly inhibited by HMGA1 binding. Taken together, these findings suggest that inhibition of DNA repair processes by HMGA proteins may contribute to the genetic and chromosomal instabilities commonly found in cancerous cells which, almost universally, overexpress these proteins. Cell Culture and Cell Cycle Distribution Analysis—The human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF7-tet (i.e. MCF7/Tet-OFF) (BD Biosciences) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 μg/ml G418 (Research Products International). Clonal cell line MCF7–7C-Cs is a derivative of MCF7/Tet-OFF cells that has been stably transfected with a tetracycline-regulated pTRE vector encoding HA-tagged HMGA1a cDNA (32Reeves R. Edberg D.D. Li Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 575-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). This stably transfected line was maintained in the presence of 100 μg/ml of hygromycin. The MCF7–7C-Cs cell line expresses high levels of transgenic HA-tagged HMGA1a protein when grown in medium lacking tetracycline (these are referred to as “ON” cells). To prevent expression of the HA-tagged HMGA1 transgenes, the MCF7–7C-Cs cells were cultured in medium containing 2 μg/ml tetracycline (and are referred to as “OFF” cells). The Hs578T line of human mammary carcinoma cells (HTB-126; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. Prior to all experiments the levels of endogenous and transgenic HA-tagged HMGA1 proteins in test plate cell cultures were determined by Western blot analysis of cell extracts prepared with TRIzol (Invitrogen), using either a monoclonal antibody against the HA tag of transgenic proteins (32Reeves R. Edberg D.D. Li Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 575-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) or a specific polyclonal antibody against HMGA1 proteins (37Reeves R. Nissen M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 155-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Western blots reacted with a polyclonal horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated anti-actin rabbit antibody (Sigma) served as loading controls. Once overexpression of HMGA1 protein was confirmed in test plates, parallel experimental cell cultures were harvested and fixed in cold absolute ethanol. Cells were then stained with 0.01 mg/ml propidium iodide for DNA content analysis by flow cytometry using a BD Biosciences FACS Caliber cytometer and Cell Quest software. Analysis of Survival and Colony-forming Ability of HMGA1-overexpressing Cells following UV Irradiation—Ten days post-induction of transgenic HMGA1 protein expression, cell cultures were analyzed for survival following UV irradiation. For UV exposure, medium was removed from culture plates and cells were irradiated using low pressure Hg lamps (Sylvania Model G30T8) at doses of 2, 10, 25, 50, and 100 J/m2 (measured with a Spectroline DM-254N short wave UV meter (Spectronic Corp.), with non-irradiated cells serving as a control. Cell survival post-irradiation was monitored via trypan blue (0.4%) exclusion and cell viability counting using a hemacytometer. Briefly, cells were first treated with trypsin/EDTA to remove monolayers, followed by centrifugation. Cell pellets were then resuspended in limited volumes of growth medium and diluted 1:1 in 100 μl of 0.4% trypan blue dye. After 5 min, 20 μl of cell suspension was loaded onto a Levy Ultra Plane hemacytometer and the number of viable cells determined. Percent survival was calculated by comparison to non-UV-irradiated controls. To evaluate the ability of cells to proliferate after UV exposure, ∼2.5 × 105 transgenic MCF-7 cells were plated in 100-mm cell culture dishes containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 μg/ml G418. Cells in the exponential growth phase were then either irradiated at one of several UV doses (2, 10, 25, 50, or 100 J/m2) or left unirradiated (control). Following irradiation, cells were harvested and replated in the appropriate medium at a concentration of 1000 cells/100-mm dish. After 10 days, colonies were stained with crystal violet (0.1% in 95% ethanol) and scored using a light microscope. Colony counts in UV-treated samples were compared with the number of colonies formed in non-UV-irradiated plates to determine percent of colony formation. RNA Interference-mediated HMGA1 Knockdown Analyses—All cell cultures were maintained as described above for survival determination. Once cells reached 50% confluence, medium was replaced with antibiotic-free medium for 24 h. Cells were then transfected with 20 nm short interfering RNA targeting the HMGA1 gene (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using Lipofectamine 2000® (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h post-transfection, cells were assayed for HMGA1 protein levels via Western blotting, and survival analyses after UV exposure were repeated following the protocol described above. Again, percent survival was calculated by comparison to non-UV-irradiated controls. Global Genomic Repair of CPD Lesions in Living Cells—Both MCF-7-tet (OFF) and MCF7–7C-Cs (ON) cells were cultured as described above. Once cells reached confluence, as determined by light microscopy, 2 mm hydroxyurea was added to each plate for 1 h to suppress residual cell cycle progression. After hydroxyurea treatment, medium was removed and cells were irradiated at 10 J/m2. Medium was then replaced, and cells were incubated under standard conditions described above (see survival determination methods) for various times post-irradiation to allow repair to occur. At the desired time post-irradiation, genomic DNA was isolated from the cells by published methods (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. 2nd. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 6.53-6.54Google Scholar). Briefly, cells on each plate were resuspended in 1 ml of 0.3 m sucrose, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Then the mixture was transferred into a microcentrifuge tube and incubated on ice for 5 min. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min, washed once with the buffer (without Nonidet P-40), and resuspended in 1.5 ml of 150 mm NaCl and 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). The nuclei were incubated with proteinase K (final concentration: 0.3 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h, after which 0.15 mg of DNase-free RNase A was added and incubation continued for an additional 30 min. The DNA was isolated by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The DNA samples (5 μg) were cleaved at CPDs using T4 endonuclease V (T4 endo V) as described above, and ∼5 μg of DNA/sample were separated on 1% alkaline-agarose gels at 20 V for 20 h. DNA was depurinated (0.25 N HCl for 30 min) and transferred to nylon membranes in 0.4 N NaOH. Radioactive probes were generated from EcoRI-digested MCF-7 cell genomic DNA followed by random priming (RadPrime™; Invitrogen). Quantification of CPDs was performed on data from phosphorimages of the Southern blots of these gels, using ImageQuant software and number-average DNA length analysis (39Bespalov V.A. Conconi A. Zhang X. Fahy D. Smerdon M.J. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 2001; 38: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Preparation of the IL-2Rα Gene Promoter PRRII DNA Fragment—Standard PCR was performed with Taq polymerase to amplify a 213-bp DNA fragment (–153 to +60, +1 denotes the transcription start site of IL-2Rα) using a plasmid containing the PRRII (–472 to +109) of the human IL-2Rα gene as a template (34Reeves R. Leonard W.J. Nissen M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4666-4679Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The PCR primer pair sequences were 5′-CCTGGTTTGAAAAATTACCGC (–153 to –133) and 5′-ATGTGGGATGGGAAGAATCG (+60 to +42). After 30 cycles of PCR, the products were extracted with PCI (phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, 25:24:1) and then ethanol precipitated. The DNA was dissolved in TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA), quantified by absorbance at 260 nm, and stored at –20 °C. For HMGA1 binding assays, DNA was end labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. To obtain a single end-labeled DNA fragment, the 5′-end of a primer (+60 to +42) was labeled with 32P by T4 polynucleotide kinase and used for the PCR step. To introduce UV photoproducts, 10 μl of DNA (or HMGA1-DNA complex) solution was irradiated under a bank of low pressure Hg UV lamps (primarily 254 nm), and the UV dose was measured with a Spectroline DM-254N short wave UV meter (Spectronic Corp.). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA) of HMGA1-DNA Complexes—Recombinant human HMGA1a protein (referred to as HMGA1 for simplicity in this report) was produced from Escherichiacoli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS carrying pET7C-hHMG-I (34Reeves R. Leonard W.J. Nissen M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4666-4679Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The isolated 213-bp PRRII DNA fragment was incubated with increasing amounts of HMGA1 in 18 μl of binding buffer (17 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 41 mm NaCl, 1.7 mm EDTA, 333 ng/ml poly(dG·dC), and 67 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the solution was mixed with 2 μl of 10× loading buffer (25% glycerol, 100 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bromphenol blue, 1 mg/ml xylene cyanol), loaded onto a 6.5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE (90 mm Tris-borate, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA) buffer, and electrophoresed in 0.25× TBE at 17 V/cm for 2 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the gel was vacuum dried, exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Amersham Bioscience), and visualized with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Bioscience Model 445–0P90). CPD Formation in HMGA1-DNA Complexes—Samples containing ∼0.56 pmol DNA (estimated from the concentration of PCR primers) and various amounts of HMGA1 were mixed in 56 μl of HMGA1 binding buffer as described above. The mixtures were irradiated with various doses of (primarily) 254 nm UV light (0–2000 J/m2), and 6-μl aliquots of the mixtures were loaded onto a 6.5% native gel for EMSA. The remaining sample for each UV dose was used for CPD mapping as described below. In Vitro Repair of CPDs in HMGA1-DNA Complexes—Single endlabeled DNA (200 nm) was irradiated with a UV dose of 400 J/m2, creating an average of ∼2 CPDs/fragment. About 1.4 pmol of a 213-bp PRRII DNA fragment was incubated with ∼6-fold excess of HMGA1 in 140 μl of binding buffer to saturate all HMGA1 binding sites within the DNA. The saturation was monitored by EMSA, showing a single band migrating at ∼700 bp of naked DNA (Fig. 4B, lane 8). The 20-μl aliquots of the binding mixture were mixed with 20 μl of repair buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm dNTP, 70 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone) and 3.2 μlof Xenopus oocyte nuclear extracts (provided by Dr. E. Ackerman, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA), followed by incubation at room temperature for various times (35Oda N. Saxena J.K. Jenkins T.M. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Ackerman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13816-13820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The DNA was isolated and treated with T4 endo V to specifically cleave DNA near CPD lesions, and the resulting DNA fragments were fractionated on a 7 m urea, 6% acrylamide gel as described below. CPD Mapping and UV Photofootprinting—DNA was isolated from each sample using phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation. After drying the pellet, the DNA was resuspended in 9 μl of T4 endo V reaction buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm EDTA). About 8 ng of T4 endo V was added to the solution and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The resulting DNA fragments were fractionated by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel (20 × 60 cm) with 1× TBE at 60 W for 4 h and visualized on a PhosphorImager as described earlier. Intensities in CPD bands were measured using ImageQuant NT software (Amersham Biosciences). Loading differences were corrected by normalizing the intensity of each band to the sum of all band intensities in a lane. Thus, the value of each band was expressed as the percentage of the total intensity of a lane. The average CPDs/strand was obtained from the intensity of the intact fragment (i.e. Po), assuming a Poisson distribution of UV-damaged fragments as described previously (36Bohr V.A. Okumoto D.S. Friedberg E.C. Hanawalt P.C. DNA Repair: A Laboratory Manual of Research Procedures. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1988: 347-366Google Scholar). Overexpression of HMGA1 Proteins Inhibits NER in MCF7 Cells—Mammalian cells that are deficient in various aspects of DNA repair exhibit, in most cases, increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents (43Freidberg E.C. Walker G.C. Sieder W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1995: 653-658Google Scholar). To gain insight into whether the HMGA1 proteins play a role in NER of UV-induced CPD lesions in vivo, the UV sensitivity of genetically engineered human cell lines was examined by two methods, colony-forming ability and dye exclusion after UV exposure. For these studies, human MCF7 mammary epithelial cell lines were used that contain stably integrated, tetracycline-regulated transgenes coding for either the HMGA1a or HMGA1b isoform proteins (32Reeves R. Edberg D.D. Li Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 575-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The endogenous levels of non-transgenic HMGA1 proteins in these MCF7 cells are very low (32Reeves R. Edberg D.D. Li Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 575-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Induction of transcriptional expression of the HMGA1 transgenes is controlled by addition of varying amounts of tetracycline to the cell culture medium. Western blot analysis has demonstrated that within 10 days of inducing the cells to express the transgenic protein the intracellular concentration of HMGA1a is greatly increased (>10-fold) in the HMGA1a ON cells, compared with the concentration in HMGA1a OFF cells (data not shown). Quantitative assessments have also demonstrated that, after longer periods of induction, the amount of transgenic HMGA1a protein in the ON cells can reach up to ∼40-fold higher than in the OFF cells (44Treff N.R. Pouchnik D. Dement G.A. Britt R.L. Reeves R. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It should be emphasized that the range observed in many naturally occurring human tumors is 15 to >50-fold more than normal cells (60Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 35-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and thus the data presented here represent effects seen within the physiological range of HMGA1 protein overexpression found in various cancer cells. The viability of cell lines was monitored by the colony-forming assay after exposure to various doses of UV radiation, and the percent colonyforming ability was determined from the non-irradiated colonies as controls (Fig. 1A). At UV doses from 2 to 100 J/m2, MCF7 cells overexpressing HMGA1a proteins were less capable of forming viable colonies (50 cells or more) when compared with MCF7 cells not overexpressing these proteins (i.e. OFF cells). The greatest differences in viability occurred at UV doses of 10 and 25 J/m2, which induce the physiological dose equivalent of CPDs observed in human cells after only a few minutes of exposure to solar UVB on a bright summer day (e.g. see Ref. 17Douki T. Court M. Sauvaigo S. Odin F. Cadet J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11678-11685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar and references therein). Given previous data demonstrating induction of cell cycle progression by HMGA1 proteins (44Treff N.R. Pouchnik D. Dement G.A. Britt R.L. Reeves R. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), flow cytometric analysis was employed to determine whether cell cycle distributions between the two cell lines were different (Fig. 1B). No significant differences in the number of gated cells at each cell cycle stage were observed, indicating that although HMGA1 overexpressing cells do exhibit a faster doubling time, the cell cycle distribution of ON cells in a random population is the same as that of OFF MCF7 cells containing only very low levels of endogenous HMGA1 proteins. To further investigate UV sensitivity in these cell lines, a trypan blue dye exclusion assay was employed to monitor cell viability (Fig. 2A). With this assay, cells are not required to attach to culture dishes and traverse the cell cycle as in colony-forming assays but are simply required to survive a UV exposure ("
https://openalex.org/W1967035512,"Scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI) mediates the selective uptake of lipids from high density lipoproteins and is expressed in several types of tissues. However, to date little is known about its role in adipocytes. In this study, we investigated the cellular distribution of SR-BI in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and its regulation by hormones known to increase lipid storage such as angiotensin II (Ang II) and insulin. SR-BI was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm as determined by laser-scanning confocal analysis of the immunofluorescence labeling of SR-BI or the study of an enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged SR-BI fusion protein. Exposure of cells to either insulin or Ang II (1-2 h) induced the mobilization of SR-BI from intracellular pools to the plasma membrane. This was further confirmed by Western blotting on purified plasma membrane and by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of the SR-BI receptor. Similar results were also observed in primary adipocytes. We also demonstrated that, in the presence of either insulin or Ang II, SR-BI translocation to the cell membrane is functional, because insulin and Ang II induced a significant increase in the high density lipoprotein-delivered 22-(N-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazo-4-yl)-amino-23,24-bisnor-5-cholen-3-ol uptake and in total cholesterol content. These data demonstrate that SR-BI can be acutely mobilized from intracellular stores to the cell surface by insulin or Ang II, two hormones that exert lipogenic effects in adipocytes. This suggests that SR-BI might participate in the storage of lipids in the adipose tissue.

These data demonstrate that SR-BI can be acutely mobilized from intracellular stores to the cell surface by insulin or Ang II, two hormones that exert lipogenic effects in adipocytes. This suggests that SR-BI might participate in the storage of lipids in the adipose tissue. Scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI) 2The abbreviations used are: SR-BI, scavenger receptor class B, type I; Ab, antibody; Ang II, angiotensin II; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; HDL, high density lipoprotein; NBD-chol, 22-(N-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazo-4-yl)-amino-23,24-bisnor-5-cholen-3-ol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. is a membrane protein that can bind various classes of modified and unmodified lipoproteins. High density lipoproteins (HDLs), to which SR-BI binds with high affinity, are now considered as its physiological ligands (1Krieger M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 523-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 2Trigatti B.L. Rigotti A. Braun A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 276-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As a consequence of HDL binding, it has been shown that SR-BI mediates the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters, a process that clearly differs from the low density lipoprotein receptor endocytic pathway (3Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Rigotti A. Miettinen H.E. Krieger M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 357-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). SR-BI is particularly abundant in several tissues, including the liver and steroidogenic tissue (4Rigotti A. Miettinen H.E. Krieger M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 357-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Several studies have reported a determinant role for hepatic SR-BI in the control of HDL cholesterol. Thus, mice lacking a functional SR-BI gene have increased levels of plasma cholesterol, whereas overexpression of SR-BI in mouse liver by adeno-virus injection lowers HDL levels and increases biliary cholesterol (5Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rigotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M. Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 6Wang N. Arai T. Ji Y. Rinninger F. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Modulation of SR-BI expression in vivo has also revealed that in steroidogenic tissues this receptor plays a major role in delivering cholesterol to be used for the synthesis of steroid hormones (4Rigotti A. Miettinen H.E. Krieger M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 357-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). These studies have left unresolved the role of this receptor in adipose tissue known to express SR-BI (9Acton S. Scherer P. Lodish H. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SR-BI is also expressed in adipocyte cell lines and is strongly induced during the course of adipose differentiation, suggesting a role for SR-BI in the fully differentiated adipocyte (9Acton S. Scherer P. Lodish H. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To get some insight into the function of SR-BI in adipocytes, we studied the regulation of SR-BI expression and its intracellular distribution in 3T3-L1 cells exposed to different hormonal conditions favoring either triglyceride storage or lipid mobilization. Our results show that angiotensin II (Ang II) and insulin translocate SR-BI from cytoplasmic compartments to the cell membrane of adipocytes. This translocation is concomitant with an increase in HDL-delivered cholesterol uptake and cell cholesterol content. Human plasma HDLs were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). A monoclonal antibody (Ab) to GLUT4 clone 1F8, was obtained from R&D Systems. 22-(N-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazo-4-yl)-amino-23,24-bisnor-5-cholen-3-ol (NBD-cholesterol or NBD-chol), and Alexa Fluor 488 and 546, goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugates, were supplied by Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Rabbit anti-SR-BI IgGs were from Novus Biologicals (NB 400-104 and NB 400-113, Novus). Anti-GRP75 IgG was from BD Transduction Laboratories. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), penicillin/streptomycin, and trypsin-EDTA were from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum was from Perbio (PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria). Lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) was prepared from the same batches of fetal bovine serum used for the differentiation of 3T3-L1, as described previously (10Le Lay S. Krief S. Farnier C. Lefrere I. Le Liepvre X. Bazin R. Ferre P. Dugail I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16904-16910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were from Sigma. Cell Culture Condition—3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes were grown to confluence on either glass coverslips or 8-well Labtek plates (Polylabo) in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 mm HEPES, 25 mm sodium bicarbonate, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Differentiation of confluent preadipocytes was induced by adding methyl isobutylxanthine (100 μm), dexamethasone (0.25 μm), and insulin (1 μg/ml) to the above solution. After 48 h, the culture medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 μg/ml insulin for 8 days. At this stage, cells were fully differentiated and displayed the characteristic lipid droplet accumulation of mature adipocytes. Adipocytes were isolated from the epididymal fat pads of 2-month-old Wistar rats by collagenase treatment as described previously (10Le Lay S. Krief S. Farnier C. Lefrere I. Le Liepvre X. Bazin R. Ferre P. Dugail I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16904-16910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Fluorescent Immunochemistry—Cells were grown on coverslips and differentiated as described above. They were then washed three times with PBS and fixed with formaldehyde in PBS (3%; 45 min), followed by exposure to PBS plus glycine (50 mm; 30 min) and then PBS plus bovine serum albumin (2%; 30 min). Cells were then permeabilized with saponin (0.01%; 5 min) in PBS. Immunolabeling was performed in PBS with the antibody (SR-BI (1:200)) and then visualized with the appropriate Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:200. Coverslips were mounted onto slides with either Vectashield or SlowFade and observed with a Zeiss laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM 500). EGFP-SR-BI Construct—A full-length mouse SR-BI cDNA sequence (a kind gift from X. Collet) in pRc/CMV was excised with Hind III and XbaI. After purification, it was ligated into the HindIII XbaI sites of pEGFP-C3. The resulting vector thus encoded the green fluorescent protein tag fused at the N-terminal part of the SR-BI protein. This construct was introduced into differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes by electroporation as described previously (11Boizard M. Le Liepvre X. Lemarchand P. Foufelle F. Ferre P. Dugail I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29164-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fluorescence was imaged in living cells 2 days after transfection by confocal microscopy. Western Blot Analysis—3T3-L1 adipocyte total membranes or purified plasma membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (12Hajduch E. Alessi D. Hemmings B. Hundal H. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 13Hyde R. Christie G.R. Litherland G.J. Hajduch E. Taylor P.M. Hundal H.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The protein contents of each isolated membrane fraction were determined using the Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed after SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose sheets (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) using standard procedures. Mouse SR-BI or GLUT4 label was revealed using the ECL system. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis of Surface SR-B1—Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were resuspended in DMEM containing a 1:100 dilution of a blocking SR-BI antibody that recognized the extracellular loop of SR-B1. After 1 h at 37°C the cells were pelleted, and a second Alexa-Fluor 488 antibody (1:100) was added for 1 h at 37°C. The cell suspension was washed twice in PBS and used for fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (Epics Altra). High Density Lipoprotein Labeling—HDL loaded with either NBDchol) or BODIPY-cholesterol ester were reconstituted as described previously (15Pitas R.E. Innerarity T.L. Weinstein J.N. Mahley R.W. Arteriosclerosis. 1981; 1: 177-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Dagher G. Donne N. Klein C. Ferre P. Dugail I. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1811-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Uptake of HDL-derived NBD-chol—To assess the uptake of HDL-derived NBD-chol, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated in DMEM and 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum at 37 °C in the presence of HDL loaded with NBD-chol. NBD-chol uptake kinetics were determined using laser confocal fluorescence microscopy on single living cells as described previously (16Dagher G. Donne N. Klein C. Ferre P. Dugail I. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1811-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, cholesterol influx was initiated by the addition of NBD-chol and followed by the acquisition of digital images at different time intervals using a time course module (Zeiss AIM software). The effect of various hormonal agents was assessed by preincubating cells in the presence of the hormones prior to NBD-chol addition. The average pixel intensity (region of interest) of each single cell as a function of time was determined using Zeiss software and expressed as mean ± S.E. The kinetic of NBD-chol uptake was analyzed by the Marquardt algorithm using Ultrafit Biosoft software (Cambridge, UK). The calculated time constants were analyzed statistically using Student's t test. Cholesterol Determinations—Differentiated cells on 100-mm dishes were lysed in PBS, and total lipids were extracted as described by Folch et al. (17Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol was determined using a cholesterol assay kit from Randox Laboratories. SR-BI Protein Expression during 3T3-L1 Differentiation into Adipocytes—The presence of SR-BI proteins was analyzed during differentiation of 3T3-L1 from fibroblasts to mature adipocytes. Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody detected two immunoreactive bands in 3T3L1 cells (Fig. 1). The lower band of ∼55 kDa corresponds to the predicted molecular mass of SR-BI deduced from the cDNA sequence, whereas the upper band of ∼80kDa is classically observed in an adrenocortical cell line and identified as the glycosylated form of the protein (18Babitt J. Trigatti B. Rigotti A. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. Xu S. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13242-13249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A indicates that the SR-BI protein followed the same pattern as that reported previously for SR-BI mRNA, namely a strong induction (∼10-fold) during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes. Thus, 3T3-L1 differentiated adipocytes express high levels of the SR-BI protein. We next examined whether the total amount of the SR-BI protein could be modulated in adipocytes. We tested the effect of the addition of various hormones known to favor lipid storage or mobilization. After 24 h in the presence of lipogenic hormones such as insulin (100 nm) or Ang II (100 nm) we detected no change in the SR-BI protein content of adipocytes (Fig. 1B). Thus, hormones that physiologically regulate the adipocyte function by inducing fat storage do not significantly change the total amount of the SR-BI protein in 3T3L1 adipocytes. Intracellular Distribution of SR-BI in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—The intra-cellular distribution of SR-BI in fat cells was studied by immunofluorescence. Staining control adipocytes with the SR-BI antibody revealed a punctuated label distributed all over the cell cytoplasm that excluded the nucleus (Fig. 2C). The intracellular SR-BI was further confirmed by a z-scanning (0.3 μm) of the cells, revealing a scarce labeling of the cell surface and an important intracytoplasmic presence of the receptor (results not shown). The distribution and trafficking of SR-BI using a EGFP-SR-BI construct in living cells was then assessed. For this purpose, we developed a plasmid encoding EGFP fused to murine SR-BI. Control analysis by Western blot in transfected COS cells revealed that the EGFP-SR-BI fusion protein migrated at the expected position relative to native SR-BI, i.e. 110 kDa (Fig. 2A). When cells were transfected, only 1-2% of cells expressed EGFP-SR-BI, which was distributed in a punctuate pattern all over the cytoplasm (Fig. 2B) similarly to that observed with SR-BI Ab (Fig. 2C). Immunofluorescence microscopy of EGFP-SR-BI transfected cells, using an SR-BI Ab recognizing both the endogenous and the green fluorescent protein-tagged receptor (Fig. 2, B and C), showed that the overall distribution of SR-BI was not altered by the expression of EGFP-SR-BI, because a significant but not complete overlap of endogenous and EGFP-tagged receptors was observed (Fig. 2D). On the other hand, the response of EGFP-SR-B1 to Ang II is similar to that observed in non-transfected cells (see below and Fig. 3). We concluded from these results that EGFP-SR-BI is a reliable reporter of SR-BI. When we examine the dynamics of EGFP-SR-BI trafficking in live cells (see supplemental data available in the on-line version of this article), fluorescent spots were stationary except for 3-4% of the spots that moved laterally and also along the plasma membrane. The traffic rate of SR-BI varied from 0.48 to 0.10 μm/sec with a mean ± S.E. of 0.25 ± 0.12 μm, a magnitude similar to that observed for protein traffic along microtubules. Angiotensin II and Insulin Induce the Translocation of SR-BI at the Cell Surface—When adipocytes (3T3-L1) were pretreated with either Ang II for 2 h (Fig. 3D) or insulin for 1 h (Fig. 3E) and then fixed and labeled with SR-B1Ab, we observed a substantial change in SR-BI distribution. Labeling of the cell membrane was markedly increased. This was associated with a dramatic decrease in labeling of cytoplasm (com-pare with control cells; Fig. 3A). Similar results were observed for Ang II in EGFP-SR-BI-transfected cells (Fig. 3, G and H). Together, these results suggest that the treatment of adipocytes with Ang II or insulin induce the translocation of SR-BI from intracellular stores to the cell surface. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases are required for a wide range of cellular processes, including protein traffic to the plasma membrane and recycling (19Backer J.M. Mol. Cell Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 3: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20Martys J.L. Wjasow C. Gangi D.M. Kielian M.C. McGraw T.E. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10953-10962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To test whether SR-BI mobilization to plasma membrane requires phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, we performed experiments in which cells were pretreated with 100 nm wortmannin (10 min). In these conditions, insulin (Fig. 3F) or Ang II (results not shown) failed to mobilize SR-BI to the cell surface. We also observed that SR-BI remained located intracellularly if introduced as an EGFP construct in undifferentiated preadipocytes (Fig. 3I) which did not yet express endogenous SR-BI at that early stage (see day 0 in Fig. 1A). In such undifferentiated cells, neither insulin nor Ang II (Fig. 3, J and K) modified SR-BI intracellular distribution, indicating that the translocation of the receptor to the plasma membrane was dependent on the fully mature adipocyte differentiated phenotype. To further ascertain these observations, we performed an immunoblot analysis of SR-BI in isolated plasma membranes from adipocytes. As depicted in Fig. 4A, we observed an increase in SR-BI content of plasma membranes of cells exposed to Ang II. Similarly, in a time course study insulin increased plasma membrane SR-BI, an effect detectable after 30 min of exposure to the hormone (Fig. 4B). It is noteworthy that the SR-BI content of plasma membranes increased with a similar magnitude (3-fold) upon the addition of insulin or Ang II. We compared the effect of insulin on SR-B1 translocation with that on GLUT4, a protein known to be translocated to the cell surface by this hormone. We observed that GLUT4 was recruited to the plasma membrane more rapidly than SR-BI. Indeed, as shown by others (21Sato Y. Ito T. Udaka N. Kanisawa M. Noguchi Y. Cushman S.W. Satoh S. Tissue Cell. 1996; 28: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) the recruitment of GLUT4 was maximal after 15 min of insulin treatment, whereas for SR-BI 45-60 min were required (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, both proteins behaved similarly upon insulin removal (Fig. 4C). Thus, the redistribution to internal pools of either protein occurred within 30-60 min, in accord with previous results reported for GLUT4 (22Nishimura H. Zarnowski M. Simpson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19246-19253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also performed fluorescence flow cytometric analysis of SR-BI receptor cell surface expression. Control or AngII-treated cell suspensions were exposed for 1 h at 37 °C to a blocking SR-BI Ab recognizing an extracellular epitope and then labeled with an Alexa 488 secondary antibody. Fig. 4D depicts the cell distribution of the relative fluorescence intensity in control cell population (trace b) or that pretreated with Ang II (trace c). An increase in cell surface receptors was observed in cells pretreated with Ang II. Finally, we used rat isolated fat cells instead of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to test the effect of insulin and AngII. We observed that both hormones increased the SR-BI content of plasma membranes (Fig. 4E). In these experiments GLUT4 was used as a control for the insulin effect. Ang II had no effect on GLUT4, as shown previously (23Wu-Wong J.R. Berg C.E. Wang J. Chiou W.J. Fissel B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8103-8110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Altogether, these results strongly suggest that insulin and Ang II induce the trans-location of SR-BI from cytoplasmic compartments to cell membrane. SR-BI Mobilized at the Cell Surface Is Functional—We next asked the question of whether the SR-BI present on the plasma membrane after insulin or Ang II stimulation is functional. Because SR-BI receptor was reported to bind HDL and to mediate selective delivery of cholesterol and cholesterol esters, we assessed the uptake of NBD-chol from HDL as a functional test. As shown in Fig. 5A, Ang II and insulin significantly stimulates NBD cholesterol influx. Furthermore, a blocking SR-BI Ab hampers the stimulation of NBD-chol uptake by Ang II (Fig. 5A), suggesting that the effect of the hormone on the entry of NBD-chol requires SR-BI. Similar results were observed with insulin (not shown). Pretreatment of cells with wortmannin significantly decreased basal NBD-chol uptake, and no stimulation could be observed in the presence of insulin (Fig. 5A). We also assessed the effect of 100 nmol/liter Losartan (Parke-Davis), a specific antagonist of angiotensin receptors, type I (AT1). A significant reduction in Ang II-stimulated NBD-chol influx was observed, suggesting the involvement of AT1 receptors in this effect. Finally, we evaluated the changes in cholesterol contents of cells that had been incubated in lipid depleted medium for 16 h and then provided with cholesterol containing HDL for 3 h in the presence or absence of insulin and Ang II (Fig. 5B). We observed that the addition of HDL significantly increased cell cholesterol content by 40% within 3 h and that the intracellular accumulation of cholesterol from HDL was almost doubled in the presence of insulin or Ang II. Together, these data indicate that the Ang II or insulin-induced translocation of SR-BI to the cell membrane is associated with enhanced cholesterol uptake and intracellular content. Previous reports have revealed the role of SR-BI in mediating HDL-derived cholesterol ester-selective uptake in different cell types, and several authors reported its presence in adipocytes and 3T3-L1 cells (Refs. 24Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar, 25Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 26Vassiliou G. McPherson R. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1683-1693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar and the present results). However, to date little is known about SR-BI regulation and function in fat cells. In the present study we show for the first time that insulin and Ang II translocates SR-BI from its cytoplasmic location to the plasma membrane of adipocytes. Evidence for such a translocation stems from confocal analysis of SR-BI and EGFP-SR-BI distribution in cells, immunoblot analysis of plasma membrane extracts, and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of SR-BI receptors at cell membranes. This translocation process is rapid and implicates a mobilization of intracellular pools, as no significant increase in SR-B1 protein level was observed. This short term regulatory effect seems to be specific to 3T3L1 and primary adipocytes because, in other cell types such as the adrenal gland and the gonads, trophic hormones were reported to stimulate SRB1 expression after 24 h. This was associated with enhanced uptake of HDL-delivered cholesterol esters and steroidogenesis (25Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 27Li X. Peegel H. Menon K.M.J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3043-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Reaven E.

Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1616-1628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In adipocytes, mobilization of transport proteins to the cell membrane is a key event in the cellular response to insulin. Thus, the intracellularly stored GLUT4 glucose transporter and the fatty acid transport proteins are rapidly redistributed to the plasma membrane in presence of insulin (31Cushman S. Wardzala L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4758-4762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ruan H. Pownall H.J. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 33Stahl A. Evans J.G. Pattel S. Hirsch D. Lodish H.F. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 477-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Our observation goes along with these findings. Indeed, insulin and Ang II, both known to promote lipid storage in adipose tissue (34Massiera F. Bloch-Faure M. Ceiler D. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Gasc J.M. Quignard-Boulange A. Negrel R. Ailhaud G. Seydoux J. Meneton P. Teboul M. FASEB. J. 2001; 15: 2727-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), induce the translocation of SR-BI to the plasma membrane. The uptake of fatty acids by adipose tissue and muscle is facilitated by CD36, a closely related member of the class B scavenger receptor family. Interestingly, SR-BI but not CD36 is mobilized to the cell membrane in conditions favoring fatty acid storage. Indeed, a stable plasma membrane localization of CD36 was observed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and was not modified by insulin (33Stahl A. Evans J.G. Pattel S. Hirsch D. Lodish H.F. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 477-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Thus, among the members of the scavenger receptor family expressed in adipocytes, SR-B1 is involved in trafficking to and from the cell membrane. This suggests that it might participate in the process of lipid storage in fat cells. This redistribution, associated with an increase in both cholesterol influx and cell content, suggests that SR-BI translocation could play a crucial role in regulation of the lipid metabolism of the cell.

The formation of inactive complexes may sequester syntaxin and allow tomosyn and amisyn to act as inhibitors of exocytosis. We aimed to use adrenal chromaffin and PC12 cells to probe this possible mode of action of amisyn and tomosyn in dense core granule exocytosis. Although tomosyn is expressed by adrenal chromaffin and PC12 cells, amisyn expression could not be detected allowing examination of the effect of introduction of amisyn expression onto a neuronal-like background. Overexpression of m-tomosyn1 and expression of amisyn both inhibited Ca2+-induced exocytosis in transfected PC12 cells. Surprisingly, this inhibition was not removed when amisyn and tomosyn constructs were used in which key residues required for efficient binding to syntaxin1 were mutated. The effect of amisyn was further characterized using carbon fiber amperometry in chromaffin cells. Expression of amisyn had no effect on the basic characteristics of the amperometric spikes but reduced the number of spikes elicited. This inhibitory action on the extent of exocytosis was also seen with the amisyn mutant deficient in syntaxin1 binding. In addition, expression of amisyn resulted in an increase in the lifetime of the prespike foot, and this effect was abolished by the mutations. These results show that tomosyn and amisyn can negatively regulate exocytosis independently of syntaxin and also that amisyn can regulate the stability of the fusion pore.

Neurotransmitters are released by regulated exocytosis where calcium triggers the fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane following vesicle recruitment, docking, and priming (1Jahn R.

These effects have been ascribed to interaction with syntaxin1 and the formation of non-productive SNARE complexes. Using PC12 and adrenal chromaffin cells as model neurosecretory cells (2Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 581-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), we show that they express tomosyn but not amisyn. Expression of amisyn or overexpression of m-tomosyn1 inhibited exocytosis, but surprisingly this was not affected by mutations that disrupt their binding to syntaxin1. Furthermore, expression of amisyn resulted in an increase in the stability of the initial fusion pore. These findings suggest, therefore, that amisyn and tomosyn have distinct regulatory roles in the control of exocytosis. Plasmids and Antibodies—A plasmid encoding amino acids 4-266 from the cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin 1A fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) was a gift from Dr. R. Scheller (University of Stanford). The amisyn plasmid was generated by PCR amplification using the BIO-X-ACT polymerase enzyme (Bioline Ltd., London, UK) from human brain cDNA (BD Biosciences). The resulting PCR product was inserted into pcDNA 3.1(-), using the XbaI and EcoRV restriction sites. Note that this plasmid encoded a 210-amino-acid version of amisyn not the incorrect N-terminally extended version first reported (23Scales S.J. Hesser B.A. Masuda E.S. Scheller R.H. J. Biol.

The full-length tomosyn plasmid was generated by PCR using a template encoding the human form of tomosyn (IMAGE clone 5272542). The PCR product was then ligated into pcDNA 3.1(-), using the NheI and BamHI restriction sites. A frameshift mutation derived from the IMAGE clone was corrected by site-directed mutagenesis. All described mutations were introduced using the Stratagene QuikChange system or the four-primer method. An anti-amisyn rabbit antiserum was custom produced against the peptide sequence NSLRAVLTCSTMSAKSAISKEIFAPLDEC by Co-valAb (Cambridge, UK) France using standard procedures. Mouse monoclonal anti-tomosyn was obtained from BD Biosciences. Preparation of Cytosol and Membrane Extracts—Rat brains were homogenized in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 m KCL, 250 mm Sucrose, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8). The sample was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant retained as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A by homogenization and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in buffer B (10 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCL, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.8), then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min and resuspended again in buffer B. 4% (v/v) Triton X-100 was slowly added with mixing, incubated at 4 °C for 45 min with frequent mixing. This membrane fraction was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Both fractions were dialyzed overnight and clarified by centrifuging at 100,000 × g for 60 min. Reverse Transcription-PCR Amplification—RNA was isolated from PC12 and chromaffin cells using standard protocol of the RNase mini kit (Qiagen). The isolated RNA was then converted to cDNA using the ImProm-II Reverse Transcription system (Promega). For the PCR amplification of amisyn the following primers were used: 3′-AGG ATA GGC GAT ATC TCA ACA TTT GTG-5′ and 5′-TGT TCT AGA ATG AGT GCC AAA-3′. For the PCR amplification of a tomosyn1 fragment the following primers were used: 3′-GGC CGG ATC CCG TAC CTC AGA ACT GGT ACC ACT TCT TAT CTT TGT-5′ and 5′-AGA AGC TAG CAT GGG AGA GTC ATC CTC GGG-3′. Growth Hormone Assay—Analysis of release of growth hormone used a modification of the growth hormone (GH) release assay (32Wick P.F. Senter R.A. Parsels L.A. Uhler M.D. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10983-10989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Graham M.E. Fisher R.J. Burgoyne R.D. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106/ml on collagen-coated 24-well trays, cultured in RPMI with 5% fetal bovine serum and 10% horse serum, and left overnight. The following day each well was transfected with 1 μg of growth hormone plasmid along with 1 μg of the test plasmid and 6 μg of Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were left for 4-6 h, after which time the transfection mixture was removed and replaced with 1 ml of fresh culture medium containing 10 mm CdCl2 to induce expression of GH. Cells were permeabilized 36 h later with KGEP (139 mm K+-glutamate, 5 mm EGTA, 20 mm PIPES, 2 mm ATP, and 2 mm MgCl2) with 20 μm digitonin for 6 min and challenged by the addition of KGEP solutions with 0 or 10 μm Ca2+. After 15 min the medium was removed for assay, cells were solubilized in water for 20 min, and the sample collected for assay. Samples were analyzed for growth hormone levels using a human growth hormone ELISA kit (Roche Diagnostics) following the manufacturers instructions. In all experiments the amount of growth hormone released was expressed as a percentage of the total cellular content of growth hormone. For immunofluorescence, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Staining was performed using a 1/100 dilution of anti-human GH antibody (DAKO) for 1 h then a 1/100 dilution anti-rabbit IgG (sigma) for 1 h, followed by a 1/50 dilution of streptavidin/Texas Red (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min. Staining was visualized by laser scanning confocal microscopy with a Leica TCS-SP-MP microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany). Transfection of PC12 Cells and Western Blotting—PC12 cells were cultured and transfected as above. After 3 days the cells were solubilized in Laemmli buffer and boiled, and the samples separated on SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (142 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4 and 1.5 mm NaH2PO4, in 51 dH20, pH 7.4) and incubated in 3% nonfat dried milk phosphate-buffered saline for 45 min. The membrane was incubated with primary antibody 1 h, washed, and incubated in secondary antibody. After multiple washes bound antibody was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). GST-syntaxin Binding Assay—Full-length amisyn and tomosyn protein were produced as 35S-labeled proteins by using the Promega TnT quick coupled transcription/translation system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Glutathione-Sepharose beads were washed in binding buffer (150 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Tween 20, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) resuspended in 100 μg of Escherichia coli extract and left for 1 h at 4 °C. GST-syntaxin1A (the cytoplasmic domain) or GST alone were added to the solution to a final concentration of 1 μm, left for a further 1 h at 4 °C before adding the radiolabeled protein and incubating for a further 2 h at 4 °C. Using cytosignal spin filters, the supernatant was collected for analysis. The beads were washed twice with 1 mg/ml gelatin, washed three times using 5% glycerol in binding buffer and bound proteins eluted in Laemmli buffer. Following SDS-PAGE gel before the gel was dried overnight, exposed to BioMax MR film, and developed using standard procedures. Chromaffin Cell Culture—Isolated bovine adrenal chromaffin cells (34Burgoyne R.D. Boulton A. Baker G. Taylor C. Neuromethods, Volume 20: Intracellular Messengers. Humana Press Inc., New Jersey1992: 433-470Google Scholar) were plated on non-tissue culture treated 10-cm Petri dishes at a density of 1 × 106/ml and left overnight at 37 °C. Non-attached cells were sedimented by centrifugation and resuspended in growth medium at a concentration of 1 × 107/ml. Plasmids encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (20 μg), and the test protein (20 μg) were added per ml of cells. Cells and plasmids (1 ml) were electroporated at 250 V and 975 μF for one pulse in 4-mm cuvettes using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II. Cells were diluted to 1 × 106/ml in fresh growth medium, and 1 ml of these were added to 10 13-mm Petri dishes. They were made up to a volume of 3 ml with fresh growth medium and maintained in growth medium for 3-5 days. Amperometric Analysis—Prior to use transfected chromaffin cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated in bath buffer (130 mm potassium glutamate, 0.2 mm EGTA, 20 mm PIPES, 2 mm ATP, and 2 mm MgCl2, pH 6.5) and viewed using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope. Transfected cells were identified as those that expressed EGFP. Control cells were identified as those cells that had undergone electroporation and were in the same dish as transfected cells but did not express EGFP. A 5-μm diameter carbon fiber electrode (NPI Electronic, Tamm, Germany) was placed in contact with the cell using a PatchMan micromanipulator (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). For stimulation a digitonin permeabilization protocol was used (35Jankowski J.A. Schroeder T.J. Holz R.W. Wightman R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18329-18335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A glass micropipette with a resistance of 1.5 megohms was filled with cell permeabilization/stimulation buffer (139 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm PIPES, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2 20 μm digitonin and 10 μm free Ca2+, pH 6.5) and positioned on the opposite side of the cell from the carbon fiber. A Transjector 5246 (Eppendorf) was used to pressure eject the buffer onto the cell for 20 s with a 100 hectopascal pulse. A holding voltage of +70 mV was applied across the carbon fiber tip and the Ag/AgCl reference electrode placed in the bath. Amperometric responses were monitored with a VA-10 amplifier (NPI Electronic), collected at 4 kHz, digitized with a Digidata 1200B acquisition system, and monitored online with the AxoScope 7.0 program (Axon Instruments). Data were subsequently analyzed using an automated peak detection and analysis protocol within the technical graphics program Origin (Microcal). Spikes were only analyzed in detail if they had a base width greater than 6 ms and an amplitude greater than 40 pA. This amplitude was chosen so that analysis were confined to spikes arising immediately beneath the carbon fiber and to limit effects on the data of diffusion times from exocytotic sites distant from the carbon fiber. Spike feet were defined from foot onset as the time at which amperometric current rose 2.5 times above noise level to spike onset as the time at which amperometric spike current began to rise, determined by differentiation of the amperometric trace. Means and S.E. were calculated from all the cells or spikes tested under each condition and statistical differences were assessed using non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, as none of the values for the parameters were normally distributed. Expression of Tomosyn but Not Amisyn in Chromaffin and PC12 Cells—To characterize the properties of the antiserum that was raised against the N terminus of amisyn it was tested on rat brain cytosol and membrane samples (Fig. 1A). The results showed that amisyn is present in cytosol and membrane fractions, confirming previous observations (23Scales S.J. Hesser B.A. Masuda E.S. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28271-28279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The specificity of the antibody was confirmed with another Western blot with the same samples but this time in the presence of the immunizing peptide, which abolished the appearance of any bands on the blot (Fig. 1A). The possible presence of amisyn in PC12 and chromaffin cells was examined, but no amisyn could be detected in either of these cell types (Fig. 1A). The expression of tomosyn was also examined. Tomosyn1 was mainly a cytosolic protein in brain extracts. Unlike amisyn, tomosyn1 was found in both PC12 and chromaffin cells (Fig. 1B). To confirm the lack of expression of amisyn in PC12 and chromaffin cells, reverse transcription-PCR was performed on RNA extracted from these cells. There was no evidence of any PCR products derived from mRNA extracted from PC12 or chromaffin cells, but a PCR product was found in the brain sample and a tomosyn1 product found from both PC12 and chromaffin cells (Fig. 1C). Generation of Amisyn and Tomosyn Mutants with Disrupted Binding to Syntaxin 1A—An assay was established to examine the in vitro binding of amisyn and m-tomosyn1 to syntaxin1A with the aim of analyzing the effect of mutations introduced into the VAMP-like domain (Fig. 2A) that could potentially reduce the binding to syntaxin. The mutations were chosen based on sequence comparison with VAMP2 and using the layers defined from the structure of the neuronal SNARE complex (10Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). The binding study was performed using the cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin1A fused to GST and an in vitro transcription/translation system to generate radiolabeled full-length amisyn and tomosyn (Fig. 2B). Less of the radiolabeled amisyn mutants were produced compared with the wild-type protein by the in vitro transcription and translation in this experiment. Binding of amisyn to GST-syntaxin1A was easily detected with ∼35% in the bound fraction, whereas no binding to control GST-coated beads was observed. To generate mutations that could potentially disrupt the interaction of amisyn with syntaxin1A, the arginine in the predicted position of the zero layer in the VAMP-like domain of amisyn was mutated to glutamine (R176Q). This mutation introduced into the isolated VAMP-like domain of amisyn has previously been shown to reduce its ability to assemble into a thermostable SNARE complex (23Scales S.J. Hesser B.A. Masuda E.S. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28271-28279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations were also introduced into the -1 and +1 hydrophobic layer positions to generate a triple mutant (L173A,R176Q,L180A). Both the single and the triple mutations abolished the binding of amisyn to syntaxin1A in vitro (Fig. 2B). Similarly, binding of full-length m-tomosyn1 generated by in vitro transcription and translation to GST-syntaxin1 was examined. Again specific binding of the wild-type protein was detected with ∼80% of tomosyn found bound to GST-syntaxin1 and no binding detectable to the GST control. The triple mutations in m-tomosyn1 substantially reduced the binding to GST-syntaxin (Fig. 2C). Effect of Expression of Amisyn or Overexpression of m-Tomosyn1 on Exocytosis in PC12 Cells and Requirement for Syntaxin Binding—It has been assumed that the inhibitory effect of tomosyn1 on exocytosis results from its interaction with syntaxin and formation of non-functional SNARE complexes. This has not, however, been tested experimentally nor has the effect of full-length amisyn on exocytosis been examined. With the availability of mutations in amisyn or m-tomosyn1 that abrogated their interactions with syntaxin1A, we were able to examine the effect of full-length constructs of these two proteins with or without the mutations on exocytosis. To examine the effect on exocytosis, use was made of a well characterized GH assay, which involves co-transfecting PC12 cells with the plasmid of interest and a plasmid encoding human GH (32Wick P.F. Senter R.A. Parsels L.A. Uhler M.D. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10983-10989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Graham M.E. Fisher R.J. Burgoyne R.D. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As GH is not expressed by PC12 cells, this allows the assay of exocytosis specifically from transfected cells. The PC12 cells were transfected with control plasmid or to express amisyn, or the syntaxin binding-defective mutants. The mutants were expressed to similar levels as the wild-type protein (Fig. 3A). To bypass any effects of transfected constructs on receptors or channels, the cells were permeabilized with digitonin and challenged with 0 or 10 μm Ca2+ after which released and retained GH were assayed, and released GH was expressed as a percentage of total GH. There are examples where the overexpression of proteins in PC12 cells disrupts GH storage leading to its constitutive secretion and reduced cellular levels (36Schluter O.M. Khvotchev M. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40919-40929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) or accumulation in the secretory pathway and severalfold increases in cellular levels (37Khvotchev M.V. Ren M. Takamori S. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10531-10539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of GH. No significant effect of any of the amisyn constructs on total cellular GH levels was observed (Fig. 3C). In addition, immunofluorescence with anti-GH indicated that the GH in both the control and amisyn-expressing cells had a punctate localization throughout the cell consistent with its accumulation in secretory granules (Fig. 3E). Expression of wild-type amisyn resulted in inhibition of both basal and stimulated exocytosis (Fig. 3A). Expression of amisyn constructs with syntaxin binding mutations did not prevent the inhibitory effect, and in fact it was reproducibly seen that the R176Q and the triple amisyn mutant were more inhibitory than wild-type amisyn (Fig. 3A) suggesting that the inhibitory effect of amisyn on exocytosis does not require its ability to bind to syntaxin1. Overexpression of tomosyn has previously been shown to inhibit exocytosis in PC12 and adrenal chromaffin cells (30Yizhar O. Matti U. Melamed R. Hagalili Y. Bruns D. Rettig J. Ashery U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2578-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 31Hatsuzawa K. Lang T. Fasshauer D. Bruns D. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31159-31166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We set out to examine whether the inhibition by m-tomosyn1 was dependent on its interaction with syntaxin1 by expressing the triple mutant that is impaired in syntaxin binding and testing its effect in the GH assay. The full-length m-tomosyn1 construct resulted in a small increase in total cellular GH levels, but no effect of the triple mutant was observed (Fig. 3D), and GH had the expected punctate localization in cells overexpressing m-tomosyn1 (Fig. 3E). As shown in Fig. 3B, full-length wild-type m-tomosyn1 inhibited basal and stimulated exocytosis, and as seen for amisyn the triple mutant inhibited exocytosis to a greater extent than wild-type protein. Effect of Expression of Amisyn on the Number of Release Events and Exocytosis Dynamics in Adrenal Chromaffin Cells—The growth hormone data show that expression of amisyn inhibits exocytosis, but to determine what effects, if any it has on the kinetics of vesicular release, carbon fiber amperometry was used in assays on adrenal chromaffin cells. This approach also has the advantage that it measures release of endogenous catecholamine from secretory granules with a half-life of >15 days (38Corcoran J.J. Wilson S.P. Kirshner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6208-6214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and so the effects of expression cannot be because of effects on granule biogene"
https://openalex.org/W1978628638,"Backbone-cyclized proteins are becoming increasingly well known, although the mechanism by which they are processed from linear precursors is poorly understood. In this report the sequence and structure of the linear precursor of a cyclic trypsin inhibitor, sunflower trypsin inhibitor 1 (SFTI-1) from sunflower seeds, is described. The structure indicates that the major elements of the reactive site loop of SFTI-1 are present before processing. This may have importance for a protease-mediated cyclizing reaction as the rigidity of SFTI-1 may drive the equilibrium of the reaction catalyzed by proteolytic enzymes toward the formation of a peptide bond rather than the normal cleavage reaction. The occurrence of residues in the SFTI-1 precursor susceptible to cleavage by asparaginyl proteases strengthens theories that involve this enzyme in the processing of SFTI-1 and further implicates it in the processing of another family of plant cyclic proteins, the cyclotides. The precursor reported here also indicates that despite strong active site sequence homology, SFTI-1 has no other similarities with the Bowman-Birk trypsin inhibitors, presenting interesting evolutionary questions.

The precursor reported here also indicates that despite strong active site sequence homology, SFTI-1 has no other similarities with the Bowman-Birk trypsin inhibitors, presenting interesting evolutionary questions. Naturally occurring circular proteins are becoming increasingly well known, with examples in bacteria, plants, and animals discovered over recent years (1Trabi M. Craik D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 132-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These topologically interesting proteins have a continuous cycle of peptide bonds in their backbone and, accordingly, are devoid of N or C termini. Such proteins were unknown a decade ago, and they differ from previously known cyclic peptides, such as the immunosuppressant cyclosporin and other cyclic peptides found in micro-organisms, in that they are conventional gene products rather than the output of nonribosomal synthetic processes. This new class of protein has excited interest as cyclization of a protein backbone has the potential to provide stabilization relative to conventional proteins, both in a thermodynamic sense (2Zhou H.X. Acc. Chem. Res. 2004; 37: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and biologically (3Felizmenio-Quimio M.E. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22875-22882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Because circular proteins have no termini, they have no target sites for amino- or carboxypeptidases. Furthermore, because the termini of conventional proteins are often flexible, and the degree of flexibility can be reduced by cyclization, entropic factors can lead to improved receptor binding affinities of circular proteins over corresponding acyclic proteins. Thus, circular proteins potentially have a range of advantages over conventional proteins and may find interesting applications in protein engineering, agriculture, and drug design (4Craik D.J. Simonsen S. Daly N.L. Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery Dev. 2002; 5: 251-260PubMed Google Scholar).SFTI-1 2The abbreviations used are: SFTI-1, sunflower trypsin inhibitor 1; BBI, Bowman-Birk inhibitor; RE, regular expression; EST, expressed sequence tag; RP-HPLC, reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; PDB, protein data bank; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.2The abbreviations used are: SFTI-1, sunflower trypsin inhibitor 1; BBI, Bowman-Birk inhibitor; RE, regular expression; EST, expressed sequence tag; RP-HPLC, reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; PDB, protein data bank; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. is a 14-amino-acid, backbone-cyclized protein found in the seeds of Helianthus annus (sunflower), which possesses potent trypsin inhibitory activity as well as weaker inhibitory activity against proteases such as thrombin (5Konarev A.V. Anisimova I.N. Gavrilova V.A. Shewry P.R. Mugnozza G.T.S. Porceddu E. Pagnotta M.A. Genetics and Breeding for Crop Quality and Resistance.

Biol. 1999; 290: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Based on sequence homology, SFTI-1 appears to be related to the Cys-rich trypsin inhibitors called the Bowman-Birk inhibitors (BBIs) that are widely distributed within plants of the Fabaceae (leguminous) and Poaceae (graminaceous) families (7Birk Y. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1985; 25: 113-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 8Prakash B. Selvaraj S. Murthy M.R. Sreerama Y.N. Rao D.R. Gowda L.R. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 560-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Two classes of BBIs have been identified as follows: the first class, found in the Poaceae, possessing a single active site, and the second class, found in both plant families, possessing two active sites that are capable of inhibiting both chymotrypsin and trypsin simultaneously in a 1:1:1 stoichiometry (9McBride J.D. Watson E.M. Brauer A.B. Jaulent A.M. Leatherbarrow R.J. Biopolymers. 2002; 66: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 10Song H.K. Kim Y.S. Yang J.K. Moon J. Lee J.Y. Suh S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 1133-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). SFTI-1 appears to be a natural peptide mimetic of the BBIs as it shares strong sequence and structural homology with the trypsin inhibitory loop of the BBI family (Fig. 1) (6Luckett S. Garcia R.S. Barker J.J. Konarev A.V. Shewry P.R. Clarke A.R. Brady R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 11Korsinczky M.L. Schirra H.J. Rosengren K.J. West J.

Remarkably, despite strong sequence and structural conservation, SFTI-1 has only been found in the seeds of the sunflower, which, as a member of the Compositae, is phylogenetically removed from other plant families containing BBIs. Furthermore, no other proteins sharing similarity with the BBIs have been identified in the Compositae (12Konarev A.V. Anisimova I.N. Gavrilova V.A. Vachrusheva T.E. Konechnaya G.Y. Lewis M. Shewry P.R. Phytochemistry. 2002; 59: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), suggesting that SFTI-1 is restricted to a single, phylogenetically isolated species.Two other classes of cyclic proteins have been discovered in the plant kingdom, namely the cyclotides (13Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Mulvenna J. Plan M.R. Trabi M. Curr. Protein. Pept. Sci. 2004; 5: 297-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and the cyclic knottins (3Felizmenio-Quimio M.E. Daly N.L. Craik D.J.

Nguyen D.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5722-5730Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), but only the cyclotides have been characterized at a genetic level to reveal their linear precursor (15Jennings C.

The conservation of key residues, particularly Asn and Asp residues, in the cyclotide precursor has led to the suggestion that proteases such as asparaginyl endoproteases are involved in the cyclization reaction (13Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Mulvenna J. Plan M.R. Trabi M. Curr. Protein. Pept. Sci. 2004; 5: 297-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 15Jennings C. West J. Waine C. Craik D. Anderson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10614-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The involvement of proteases in cyclization has been further suggested by the report of in vitro cyclization of linearized SFTI-1 with trypsin (17Marx U.C. Korsinczky M.L. Schirra H.J. Jones A. Condie B. Otvos L. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21782-21789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and the characterization of the biosynthetic pathway of the cyclic sex pilin subunit TrbC. In the pilin system a serine protease-like enzyme, TraF, mediates both the cleavage of the TrbC precursor and the subsequent ligation of the N and C termini via aminolysis of an acyl intermediate (18Kalkum M. Eisenbrandt R. Lurz R. Lanka E. Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 382-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Eisenbrandt R. Kalkum M. Lurz R. Lanka E. J.

Both of these reactions rely on the presence of certain residues, and if the in vivo cyclization of plant proteins proceeds via a protease-catalyzed path, then the determination of precursor sequences for all classes of plantcyclized proteins is of paramount importance for understanding the cyclization mechanism.To date, nothing is known about the biosynthetic pathway of SFTI-1, and a number of possibilities has been suggested (21Korsinczky M.L.J.

A resolution of this problem has been hampered by the small size of SFTI-1, which restricts the usefulness of PCR approaches due to the limited sequence available for degenerate primer design and the diminutive product produced. Furthermore, the cyclic nature of SFTI-1 complicates primer design because the order in which residues appear in the linear precursor is unknown. Because SFTI-1 is expressed only in seeds, isolation of cDNA containing the SFTI-1 transcript is also problematic due to the unknown timing of its expression. Accordingly, in this work, an approach utilizing bioinformatics and data base screening was perceived to be the most appropriate, and most likely to succeed, method of determining the sequence of the SFTI-1 precursor.In this paper the sequence and structure of the linear precursor of SFTI-1 is reported. The mature peptide was first reported in 1999, but until now it was not known whether it was a gene product or nonribosomally produced. The presence of a linear precursor in the sunflower suggests that SFTI-1 is gene-expressed, and the sequence of the 52-amino acid precursor that is processed into mature cyclic SFTI-1 shares interesting parallels with the cyclotides, the largest known family of naturally occurring circular proteins. The structure reported here shows that the major structural elements of the reactive site loop of SFTI-1 are present before processing, whereas the precursor region adopts a much greater degree of conformational freedom. The sequence of the precursor further indicates that, apart from the reactive site loop, SFTI-1 does not bear any further resemblance to the BBIs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRegular Expression Searches—For regular expression searching of the sunflower data base, a regular expression (RE) coding for the active site residues (CTKSIPPIC) was generated. For searching of the Arabidopsis genomic data base, a regular expression was generated coding for the active site residues of known dicot BBIs (Fig. 2). The scripting language PERL was used to search flat file data bases of DNA sequences in FASTA format for protein patterns corresponding to the regular expressions. The script used the BioPERL modules to translate each sequence in six reading frames and these translations were searched for the particular regular expression. If a match was made then the script returned the pattern found as well as 20 residues on either side of the pattern. If the data base being searched contained EST sequences, then the results were filtered by examining the preceding 20 amino acids for stop codons and discarding hits if these elements were present. The remaining hits were then analyzed manually using GENSCAN and SignalP. If a genomic data base was being examined, then the contig containing the hit was retrieved and analyzed using GENSCAN; if the hit was recognized as an open reading frame, it was further analyzed with SignalP. By using this procedure, searches were made by utilizing the SFTI-1 active site RE and the BBI trypsin-reactive loop RE on a sunflower EST data base and the complete genome sequence data bases of Arabidopsis.FIGURE 2An alignment of the active site residues from SFTI-1 and various BBIs; mung bean trypsin inhibitor (PDB code 1SMF), adzuki bean trypsin inhibitor (PDB code 1TAB), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (PDB code 1BBI).

This DNA was used in the PCR using primers (Proligo Australia Pty. Ltd., Lismore, New South Wales, Australia) designed from the data base hit. The forward primer coded for the sequence MATTMAK (5′-ATGGCAACCACAATGGCA-3′), and the reverse primer coded for the sequence KSIPPIC (5′-AAATCGGGGGAATCGACTTA-3′). PCR products were excised from agarose gel and cloned into pCR®2.1-TOPO vector using Invitrogen TOPO® cloning kit for sequencing.High Pressure Liquid Chromatography—Preparative reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) was performed on a Waters 600-MS controller system equipped with a Waters 484 tunable absorbance detector. Samples were manually loaded onto a Vydac C18 column (22 × 250 mm, 300-Å pore size, 10-μm particle size) and eluted at a flow rate of 8 ml/min with a linear gradient of 0 – 80% Buffer B (90% HPLC grade acetonitrile in H2O, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) for 80 min with UV detection at 230 nm. Semipreparative RP-HPLC was performed using the same conditions and equipment with a Vydac C18 column (10 × 250 mm, 300-Å pore size, 10-μm particle size) and a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Analytical RP-HPLC was performed on a Waters 600 controller system equipped with a Waters 486 tunable absorbance detector. Samples were auto-injected using a Waters 717plus onto a Vydac C18 analytical column (4.6 × 250 mm, 300-Å pore size, 5-μm particle size). Samples were eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a linear gradient of 0 – 80% Buffer B for 40 min with UV detection at 215 nm.Mass Spectrometry—All mass data were obtained using electrospray/time of flight mass spectrometry on a Mariner instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems). A 25-μl sample was injected into an Applied Biosystems 140B solvent delivery system and passed through the mass spectrometer at a flow rate of 80 μl/min with a constant organic solvent ratio of 80% Buffer B. Protein mass peaks were recorded in the linear mode between 1,000 and 25,000 m/z+ with a step size of 0.1 or 0.2 Da and a delay time of 0.3 s. The nozzle potential was set between 60 and 100 V, and data were acquired as [M + 2H]2+ and processed using Biospec Data Explorer 3.0.0.0 (PerSeptive Biosystems) software.Expression of Pro-SFTI-1—The PCR was used to amplify pro-SFTI-1 from sunflower DNA using the same procedure as above. The forward primer in this reaction coded for the sequence GYKTSIS with a SapI site included at the 5′ end (5′-GCTCTTCCAACGGTTACAAAACCTCTATCTC-3′) and the reverse primer coded for the sequence PDGRP* and included a PstI site at the 5′ end (5′-CTGCAGTTATGGCCTGCCATCGGGA-3′). The PCR product was excised from agarose gel and cloned into pTWIN1 to produce a plasmid encoding pro-SFTI-1 N-terminally fused to the intein. This plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli (strain ER2566) and was then grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin to an A600 of 0.5. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and the culture was incubated overnight at 15 °C.After incubation the cells were harvested by spinning at 5000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in Buffer B1 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by sonication. This mixture was centrifuged at 19,000 × g for 30 min, and 40 μl of the supernatant was analyzed by using SDS-PAGE to confirm the presence of the fusion protein in the soluble fraction. A column was packed with 10 ml of chitin beads, equilibrated with 10 bed volumes of Buffer B1 at 4 °C, and the supernatant loaded at ∼1 ml/min. The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of Buffer B1. On column cleavage of the intein fusion protein was induced by overnight incubation of the column in Buffer B2 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at room temperature, and pro-SFTI-1 was eluted with Buffer B1. The eluant was further purified using preparative HPLC, and the presence of pro-SFTI-1 was confirmed by using mass spectrometry. The peak containing pro-SFTI-1 was lyophilized yielding dry peptide.Synthesis of Pro-SFTI-1—The SFTI precursor was assembled using manual solid phase peptide synthesis with t-butoxycarbonyl/O-benzotriazole-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate chemistry on a 0.5 mm scale. The C-terminal proline was attached to the resin via a 4-(oxymethyl)-phenylacetimido-methyl linker (t-butoxycarbonyl-Pro-4-(oxymethyl)-henylacetimido-methyl resin 100–200 mesh, Novabiochem), and amino acids were added to the resin by using O-benzotriazole-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate with in situ neutralization. Cleavage of the peptide from the resin was achieved using hydrogen fluoride with p-cresol and p-thiocresol as scavengers (9:0.5:0.5 (v/v) hydrogen fluoride/cresol/thiocresol). The reaction was allowed to proceed at –5 to 0 °C for 90 min. The hydrogen fluoride was removed, and the peptide was precipitated with diethyl ether. After filtration, the peptide was solubilized in 50% Buffer A (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid/water)/Buffer B (90% acetonitrile/0.05% trifluoroacetic acid/water) and lyophilized. The crude peptide was initially purified using preparative HPLC followed by semi-preparative HPLC. Mass spectrometry was used to identify peaks containing pro-SFTI-1.Purified pro-SFTI-1 was oxidized in ammonium carbonate with and without glutathione. In the former reaction, pro-SFTI-1 was incubated overnight in 0.1 m ammonium carbonate at room temperature. In the latter, pro-SFTI-1 was incubated overnight at room temperature in 0.1 m ammonium carbonate with 10 mm reduced glutathione and 1 mm oxidized glutathione. The products were purified with semi-preparative HPLC, and the correct peak was identified by using mass spectrometry.NMR Spectrometry and Structure Calculations—Approximately 2 mg of dry pro-SFTI-1 was dissolved in 550 μl of 90% H2O, 10% D2O (99.9%, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Woburn, MA). Spectra were recorded at 295, 298, and 305 K on a Bruker Avance-600 NMR spectrometer. All two-dimensional spectra were recorded in phase-sensitive mode using time-proportional phase incrementation for quadrature detection in the t1 dimension (22Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3516) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional experiments performed included a DQF-COSY (23Rance M. Sorensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar), a TOCSY (24Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3101) Google Scholar) with a mixing time of 80 ms, an ECOSY (25Griesinger C. Sorensen O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1987; 75: 474-492Google Scholar) and NOESY spectra (26Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4816) Google Scholar) with mixing times of 100, 150, and 200 ms. Solvent suppression for NOESY and TOCSY experiments was achieved using a modified WATERGATE sequence (27Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklen V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3499) Google Scholar). For the DQF-COSY experiment, the water signal was suppressed by lower power irradiation during the relaxation delay (1.8 s). Spectra were routinely acquired over 8802 Hz with 4096 complex data points in F2 and 512 increments in the F1 dimension, with 40 scans per increment (96 for NOESY). A series of one-dimensional and TOCSY spectra were run immediately after dissolving the fully protonated sample in D2O foridentification of slowly exchanging amide protons.Spectra were processed on a Silicon Graphics Indigo work station using XWIN-NMR (Bruker) software. The t1 dimension was zero-filled to 2048 data points, and shifted sinebell window functions were applied prior to Fourier transformation. Chemical shifts were referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate sodium salt at 0.00 ppm. Two-dimensional spectra were assigned using TOCSY cross-peaks for intra-amino acid assignments and NOESY cross-peaks for sequential assignment (28Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids, Wiley-Interscience, New York1986: 130-161Google Scholar). Spectra were analyzed with the program SPARKY (29Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3 Manual, University of California, San Francisco2004Google Scholar).The intensities of cross-peaks in NOESY spectra with a mixing time of 100 ms were calibrated, and distance constraints were derived using CYANA (30Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). Corrections for pseudoatoms were added to distance constraints where needed (31Wüthrich K. Billeter M. Braun W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Backbone dihedral angle restraints were derived from 3JHNHα coupling constants measured from line shape analysis of antiphase cross-peak splitting in the DQF-COSY spectrum. Angles were restrained to –120°± 40° for 3JHNHa >9 Hz. Positions of slowly exchanging amides were analyzed within preliminary structures, and in two cases hydrogen bonds were unambiguously assigned and added to the restraints. After initial structure calculations using CYANA, sets of 50 structures were calculated using a torsion angle simulated annealing protocol within CNS (32Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Rice L.M. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 325-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The resulting structures were subjected to further molecular dynamics and energy minimization in a water shell (33Linge J.P. Nilges M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The final ensemble of 20 structures was deposited in the PDB as 2AB9.Platelet Aggregation Assays—Platelet aggregation assays were performed using human platelet-rich plasma by drawing blood from a human volunteer who had not had aspirin or related products for at least 14 days. The aggregation assay was performed by adding 50 μlofa 0.6 mm solution of cyclic SFTI-1 to 400 μl of platelet-rich plasma at 37 °C. After incubation for 5 min 25 μl of 0.2 mm adenosine diphosphate was added and the light transmittance recorded.RESULTSRegular Expression Searching—SFTI-1 contains only 14 amino acids, of which only seven share sequence identity with the BBIs. Accordingly, BLAST searches are ineffective when searching for homologous sequences due to the short query sequence. Hence, to locate proteins that contain sequence identity to the active site of SFTI-1 and the Bowman-Birk inhibitors, the RE capabilities of the Perl scripting language were used to examine various plant data bases. Using the sequence of SFTI-1 and the active site residues of known Bowman-Birk inhibitors, an RE was generated that coded for the seven-residue loop that constitutes the active site in SFTI-1 and the BBIs (Fig. 2). This RE was used in a Perlscript that translated each data base entry in six reading frames and searched each translation for the pattern specified in the RE. By utilizing this approach, it was hoped that both the precursor of SFTI-1 would be identified in sunflower sequence data bases and that peptides similar to SFTI-1 would be identified in the model plant Arabidopsis. The search of the Arabidopsis genome yielded no significant hits using the RE, but the same search of a sunflower EST data base produced a significant hit for a gene that encoded the full sequence of mature SFTI-1 embedded in a 52-amino acid precursor protein.Description of Identified Genes—Fig. 3 sets out the putative precursor of SFTI-1, denoted prepro-SFTI-1, identified in RE searches of the sunflower EST data base. The program SignalP (34Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4920) Google Scholar) was used to identify signal sequence, and output from this program suggested that the precursor contains a 21-amino acid N-terminal signal sequence. Following the signal sequence, a 14-amino acid pro-peptide precedes the 14 amino acids that putatively constitute the mature SFTI-1 sequence. The mature sequence is followed by a three-residue tail. Most interestingly, the first two residues of this short tail (Gly-Arg) are the same as the first two N-terminal residues of the mature sequence. Consequently, the exact processing points of SFTI-1 cannot be identified. As processing of SFTI-1 from this precursor must include two proteolytic cleavages at the N and C termini prior to cyclization, these cleavages can occur at three separate positions to produce the same cyclic peptide (see Fig. 3). As an aside, this highlights the “seamlessness” of backbone cyclization as a post-translational modification and mirrors the situation in the cyclotides, in which the linear precursors coded in the Oak1, Oak2, and Oak3 clones could in principle be processed in four different positions to produce the same cyclic peptide (15Jennings C.

A predicted endoplasmic reticulum signal region is shown in the black box and the putative mature peptide in the white box. In order to produce cyclic SFTI-1 the precursor must be cleaved at the N-terminal and the C-terminal, but the repeat of a Gly-Arg motif at either end of the mature sequence provides three different cleavage combinations (middle) to produce the same cyclic peptide (bottom). This is similar to the situation encountered in the Oak clones from O. affinis (15Jennings C. West J. Waine C. Craik D. Anderson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This study describes a generation of edible transgenic crop expressing, functional protective antigen (PA). In vitro studies showed that the plant-expressed antigen is qualitatively similar to recombinant PA. Immunization studies in mouse animal models indicated the generation of PA-specific neutralizing antibodies and stressed the need for improving expression levels to generate higher antibody titers. Genetic engineering of a plant organelle offers immense scope for increasing levels of antigen expression. An AT-rich PA gene (pagA) coding for the 83-kDa PA molecule was thus cloned and expressed in tobacco chloroplasts. Biolistics was used for the transformation of a chloroplast genome under a set of optimized conditions. The expression of the pagA gene with 69% AT content was highly favored by an AT-rich chloroplast genome. A multifold expression level of functional PA was obtained as compared with the nuclear transgenic tobacco plants. This report describes for the first time a comprehensive study on generating transgenic plants expressing PA, which may serve as a source of an edible vaccine against anthrax. Two important achievements of expressing PA in an edible crop and use of chloroplast technology to enhance the expression levels are discussed here."
https://openalex.org/W1993290085,"Abstract Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are ligand-gated ion channels formed by five homologous subunits that are involved in processes including signal transduction, proliferation, and apoptosis. The developmental role of these receptors, however, is unclear. In the present investigation, α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in mouse lungs from embryonic day (E)13.5 to postnatal day (PN)20. Transcriptional mechanisms that regulate α7 were assessed by the transfection of murine bronchiolar cells with a reporter containing 1.1 kb of the mouse α7 promoter, TTF-1, and Egr-1. α7 was initially detected at E13.5 in pulmonary mesenchymal cells and in the epithelium of the primitive tubules at E15.5. From E18.5 to PN1, α7 was expressed in conducting airway and saccule epithelial cells. By PN10, expression was observed in the peripheral epithelium and on luminal membranes of bronchiolar epithelial cells in the proximal lung, a pattern that continued through PN20. From E15.5 to PN20, type II alveolar cells expressed both prosurfactant protein C and α7. From E18.5 to PN20, Clara cells in the bronchiolar epithelium co-expressed Clara cell secretory protein and α7. TTF-1 dose-dependently activated α7 transcription in vitro by binding specific TTF-1 regulatory elements in the mouse α7 promoter. Furthermore, α7 was not detected in TTF-1-null mice and markedly increased in TTF-1-overexpressing mice. Conversely, Egr-1 inhibited α7 expression. Temporal-spatial α7 expression supports the concept that these receptors function during normal pulmonary morphogenesis. A model is also supported whereby α7 is induced by the essential pulmonary transcription factor TTF-1 and suppressed by Egr-1 during pulmonary development."
https://openalex.org/W2063003826,"A comprehensive series of solution and crystallographic studies reveal how simple, achiral, bivalent ligands of the cyclic pyruvate of glycerol promote face-to-face complex formation of the pentraxin, serum amyloid P component (SAP) into decamers.

The design, synthesis, and characterization of tailored multivalent ligands is currently a rapidly expanding frontier for novel pharmaceuticals (1Boas U. Heegaard P.M. Chem. Soc. Rev. 2004; 33: 43-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). In our design of inhibitors for the radially symmetric, pentameric bacterial toxins of Escherichia coli 0157, we observed that tailored multivalent ligands could provide a dramatic amplification in avidity over monovalent ligands (2Kitov P.I.

Besides inhibition enhancements, aggregation of receptors is essential for triggering a variety of biological responses; e.g. dimerizer-regulated gene expression offers pharmacological regulation to gene therapies (5Pollock R.

Although the multivalency effect caused by ligand chelation can be readily rationalized in general (6Kitov P.I. Bundle D.R. J. Am. Chem.

Serum amyloid P component (SAP) 1The abbreviations used are: SAP, serum amyloid P component(s); MOβDG, methyl 4,6-(1-carboxyethylidene)-β-d-galactoside; DLS, dynamic light scattering; GFC, gel filtration chromatography; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. belongs to the pentraxin family of circulating serum proteins and is characterized by 5-fold radial symmetry of the identical, noncovalently associated subunits. A part of the innate immune system, SAP binds a variety of ligands, including proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids, in a Ca2+-dependent manner. SAP seems to provide marginal advantage in fighting certain infections, but its primary role is believed to be the disposal of cellular debris released by apoptotic and necrotic cells, thereby preventing autoimmunity (8Noursadeghi M.

As a universal component of abnormal amyloid deposits, including the cerebral amyloid beta of Alzheimer disease, P component plays a role in protecting fibrils from proteolysis and promoting amyloid deposition both in vitro and in vivo (11Tennent G.A.

Inhibition of SAP has recently been proposed as a pharmaceutical target, and bivalent d-proline derivatives were reported to show therapeutic efficacy in dramatically reducing serum SAP levels as well as shrinking amyloid deposits in mice (13Pepys M.B.

Despite the low intrinsic affinity of d-proline for the Ca2+-binding site, the bivalent derivatives bridge two pentameric SAP with submicromolar activity. To extend our current understanding of the use of multivalent ligands in the treatment of amyloid diseases, we have synthesized a series of simple but potent bivalent inhibitors of SAP that incorporate linkers of different flexibility. The interactions of two of the most potent ligands with SAP have been thoroughly characterized through solution studies including dynamic light scattering, crystal structures of SAP-ligand complexes, and a thermodynamic model for binding. These studies reveal several striking structural and thermodynamic implications of linker flexibility in multivalent binding and pose intriguing questions regarding the factors that determine the stability of ligand-induced face-to-face protein complexes. Gel Filtration Chromatography (GFC)—GFC was carried out using a PerSeptive Biosystems BioCAD Sprint liquid chromatography system. For most experiments, the running buffer was TN buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, and 20 mm CaCl2). Typically, 20 μl of protein solution (1 mg/ml SAP) in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) was mixed with 20 mm CaCl2 and either 2′-dAMP, compound 1, or compound 3 (each at 20 mg/ml; compounds shown in Scheme 1). The protein-ligand mixtures were equilibrated overnight at 4 °C before loading onto a Superose 6 GL 10/300 column (Amersham Biosciences) or a Zorbax GF-250 9.4/250 column (Agilent Technologies). The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min, the temperature was 25 °C, and elution was monitored by measuring absorbance at 280 nm. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)—Hydrodynamic radius analysis was carried out at 25 °C using a Protein Solutions DynaPro molecular sizing instrument (Proterion Corp.). Samples containing SAP (0.5 mg/ml) and one of three compounds (2′-dAMP (10 mm), compound 1 (10 mm), or compound 3 (40 mm)) were equilibrated in buffer A plus 20 mm CaCl2 overnight at 4 °C prior to DLS measurements. Hydrodynamic radius analysis of SAP with compounds 1 and 2 was also carried out over a range of concentrations. Samples containing SAP (1 mg/ml) and 0-10 mm of compounds 1 or 2 were equilibrated in buffer B (250 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 50 mm calcium acetate) overnight at 4 °C before DLS measurements. DLS measurements were only accepted if the light intensity count rate was steady to within ±20% and the polydispersity reading was less than 20%. All of the samples were measured in triplicate. Crystallization—SAP was dialyzed extensively against buffer A and concentrated to 10 mg/ml prior to crystallization. All of the crystals were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method (1 μl of protein and 1 μl of ligand and 1 μl of reservoir equilibrated against 1 ml of reservoir solution) at 21 °C. Two crystal forms were grown in the presence of compound 1. Form A (SAP·15) grew at a ligand concentration of 40 mm with a reservoir solution consisting of 250 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 50 mm calcium acetate, 9% (w/v) PEG 8000, 20% (w/v) PEG 400. Crystals appeared overnight and continued to grow for a week, giving approximate dimensions of 0.4 mm × 0.1 mm × 0.05 mm. Form B (SAP2·15) grew at a ligand concentration of 10 mm with a reservoir solution consisting of 250 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 50 mm calcium acetate, 11.5% (w/v), PEG 4000, 10% (w/v) PEG 400, 5% (w/v) sorbitol. Crystals appeared after several weeks giving approximate dimensions of 0.13 mm × 0.25 mm × 0.05 mm. Crystals in the presence of compound 2 grew at a ligand concentration of 40 mm with a reservoir solution consisting of 250 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 50 mm calcium acetate, 12% (w/v) PEG 8000. Crystals appeared after 3 or 4 days and continued to grow for several weeks, giving approximate dimensions of 0.4 mm × 0.05 mm × 0.03 mm. Prior to data collection, the crystals grown in the presence of compound 2 were adapted to a cryopreservation solution by transferring crystals to a 5-μl drop (250 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 50 mm calcium acetate, 16% (w/v) PEG 8000, and 3% (w/v) PEG 400) and equilibrating against 1 ml of well solution (250 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 50 mm calcium acetate, 16% (w/v) PEG 8000, and 30% (w/v) PEG 400) overnight. Structure Determination—Diffraction data were measured from single crystals flash frozen under a nitrogen cryo stream (∼110 K) using a MAR image plate and X-rays produced with a rotating copper anode (Rigaku RU300H). Higher resolution data were also measured on single crystals using an ADSC Quantum-315 CCD detector at the Advanced Light Source on Beamline 8.3.1 (λ = 1.115 Å). The data were processed, scaled, and merged using DENZO, SCALEPACK (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab The protein chains from the SAP pentamer of the 2′-dAMP complex (Protein Data Bank code 1LGN) were used as the search model for all molecular replacement calculations (16Hohenester E. Hutchinson W.L. Pepys M.B. Wood S.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 570-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The structure of SAP complexed with compound 1 at 40 mm (SAP·15 or crystal form A) was determined using Molrep (17Vagin A.A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4153) Google Scholar). A single pentamer was located in the asymmetric unit, giving rise to reasonable crystal packing and a solvent content of 57%. Refmac (version 5.1.24) (18Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar) was initially used to carry out rigid body refinement with each of the five protomers as rigid bodies (100-2.8 Å resolution, Rwork = 0.318, Rfree = 0.308). The structure of SAP complexed with compound 1 at 10 mm (SAP2·15 or crystal form B) was determined using AMoRe (19Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar). Four pentamers were located in the asymmetric unit, giving rise to reasonable crystal packing and a solvent content of 59%. AMoRe was used to carry out rigid body refinement with each protomer as a rigid body (20-3.5 Å, Rfac = 0.331). The structure of SAP complexed with compound 2 at 40 mm concentration was determined using CNS (version 1.0) (20Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

Two pentamers were located in the asymmetric unit, giving rise to reasonable crystal packing and a solvent content of 52%. CNS was used to carry out rigid body refinement with each protomer as a rigid body (20-3.8 Å resolution, Rwork = 0.334, Rfree = 0.345). Refmac was used for the refinement of individual atomic positional and temperature factor parameters, as well as translation-libration-screw axis motion parameters for each protomer. Noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were applied only for refining the structure of SAP complexed with compound 2, because of the relatively low limit of diffraction. Xfit (21McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) was used for inspecting electron density maps and interactive model building. Procheck (22Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W.

Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1806) Google Scholar) were used to evaluate stereochemical parameters in the model. The data collection and refinement statistics for all crystal structures are summarized in Table III. Synthesis and Activity of Novel Bivalent Inhibitors—SAP has previously been shown to bind to a number of bacterial and plant oligosaccharides in a Ca2+-dependent manner (24Pepys M.B. Booth D.R. Hutchinson W.L. Gallimore J.R. Collins P.M. Hohenester E. Amyloid J. Protein Folding Disorders. 1997; 4: 274-295Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of a complex of SAP and methyl 4,6-(1-carboxyethylidene)-β-d-galactoside (MOβDG) recently revealed how the cyclic pyruvate ketal moiety in many of these natural carbohydrate polymers can directly interact with the Ca2+-binding site and adjacent regions of SAP (25Thompson D. Pepys M.B. Tickle I. Wood S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Based on this structural information, we hypothesized that a minimal fragment consisting of the cyclic pyruvate ketal of glycerol could be used to form the core binding element of a novel series of bivalent inhibitors intended to form face-to-face assemblies of SAP pentamers. As part of a much larger series, bivalent derivatives 1 and 2 as well as monovalent analog 3 were synthesized, and the SAP binding activity for each compound was evaluated by a solid phase assay (supplementary material). These compounds have a simple, achiral structure and can be obtained in high yield from inexpensive starting materials. In this report, we focus our studies on two compounds differing primarily in the rigidity of the linker segment. The end groups and the lengths of the linkers in compounds 1 and 2 are identical, but the piperazine ring in compound 2 prevents rotation around three central bonds, thereby restricting the flexibility of the tether. As a result, the apparent binding of compound 2 to SAP, as measured by solid phase competitive ELISA, is nearly 30-fold higher than that of the more flexible analog 1, which in turn binds 140-fold better than 3. Balancing linker rigidity against geometric requirements for optimal orientation of the end groups is a common issue in the design of multivalent ligands. The difference in activity seen in this case prompted the additional studies described below (Scheme 1). Oligomeric States of SAP in Solution—To directly observe the different oligomeric states adopted by serum amyloid P component in the presence of bivalent ligands in solution, GFC and DLS were used. As shown previously, SAP in TN buffer elutes at the same volume in the absence of any ligands and in the presence of 2′-dAMP (26Hutchinson W.L. Hohenester E. Pepys M.B. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 482-493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Table I). Previously reported crystallographic and small angle x-ray scattering studies also indicate that SAP adopts two different decameric forms under these conditions (16Hohenester E. Hutchinson W.L. Pepys M.B. Wood S.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 570-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 27Emsley J. White H.E. O'Hara B.P. Oliva G. Srinivasan N. Tickle I.J. Blundell T.L. Pepys M.B.

Biol. 1997; 272: 408-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). SAP in the presence of a monovalent ligand, either MOβDG or compound 3, elutes at a larger volume, suggesting the presence of a pentameric state, which is consistent with previous crystallographic and solution studies (25Thompson D. Pepys M.B. Tickle I. Wood S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 28Ashton A.W. Boehm M.K. Gallimore J.R. Pepys M.B. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 408-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). SAP in the presence of compound 2 elutes at a smaller volume consistent with a decameric state, which agrees with the DLS measurements and crystallographic studies described below.Table IGel filtration chromatographyElution volumeSuperose 6 GLZorbax GF-250mlSAP12.97.1SAP + 112.87.1SAP + 313.87.7SAP + 2′ -dAMP13.07.2 Open table in a new tab DLS confirms and provides a finer probe of oligomeric populations than GFC (Table II). In TN buffer, unliganded SAP and SAP bound to an excess of either 2′-dAMP or compound 2 have hydrodynamic radii (Rh) greater than 6 nm. In comparison, SAP bound to compound 3 in TN buffer or SAP alone in acetate buffer have hydrodynamic radii of 5.4 and 5.8 nm, respectively. The larger hydrodynamic radii in the first three samples is consistent with the presence of a decameric form as shown previously by GFC, solution x-ray scattering, and x-ray crystallography (16Hohenester E. Hutchinson W.L. Pepys M.B. Wood S.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 570-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Hutchinson W.L. Hohenester E. Pepys M.B. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 482-493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Table IIDynamic light scatteringHydrodynamic radiusnmSAP6.1 ± 0.21SAP + 16.2 ± 0.30SAP + 35.8SAP + 2′ -dAMP6.1 ± 0.06SAP in acetate5.4 ± 0.15 Open table in a new tab DLS was also used to monitor the variation in hydrodynamic radii for samples of SAP equilibrated with varying concentrations of the bivalent compounds 1 and 2 (Fig. 1). As the concentrations of the bivalent compounds increase from 0.25 to 10 mm, the average hydrodynamic radius of the particles in solution increases from a value expected for a pentamer (designated SAP·15 or SAP·25) and reaches a plateau near a value expected for a decamer (designated SAP2·15 or SAP2·25). As the concentration of compound 1 is further increased, the hydrodynamic radius decreases back to the value expected for a pentamer, SAP·15. In contrast, even at the highest concentrations of compound 2 that could be tested (100 mm), the hydrodynamic radius remains at the value expected for a decamer, SAP2·25. To quantitatively account for the variation in populations of pentamers and decamers in solution as a function of ligand concentration, a thermodynamic model based on the principles of mass action was developed (for a complete derivation, please refer to the supplementary material). The model leads to the relationships below that permit the two variables, free receptor concentration and free ligand concentration [L], to be solved numerically at any given values of the total concentrations of ligand [L]o and receptor [R]o, where Kpentamer(i) and Kdecamer(i) are the stability constants for the formation of pentameric and decameric complexes.[R]0=[R](1+∑Kpentamer(i)[L]i+2∑Kdecamer(i)[L]i[R])(Eq. 1) [L]0=[L]+∑iKpentamer(i)[L]i[R]+∑iKdecamer(i)[L]i[R]2)(Eq. 2) Stability constants for various pentameric and decameric complexes in which the receptor exists are defined as follows,Kpentamer(i)=[RLi][R][L]i(Eq. 3) Kdecamer(i)=[RLiR][R]2[L]i(Eq. 4) where i is the number of ligands in a complex; i varies from 1 to 5. Parametrization of the model relies on two intrinsic binding constants, k and K. The “intrinsic” binding constant k quantifies the strength of the interaction between each individual binding site of the receptor and a single affinity element of the ligand. A second “multivalent” binding constant K quantifies the strength of the hypothetical complex, where each binding fragment of bivalent ligand engaged in interaction with single binding site of two receptor molecules. For simplicity, K assumed to be constant independent of occupancy in each particular complex. The values for k and K may vary for different bivalent ligands and can be derived by fitting binding data to the model. The values of k and K can also be derived from competitive ELISA measurements under conditions at neutral pH where the binding is stronger. Accounting for the reduced binding affinity seen under the lower pH conditions used for the DLS experiments, it appears that the values of k and K derived from ELISA measurements are consistent with those obtained by fitting our model to the DLS data (Fig. 1). Fig. 2 shows relationships between k and K and corresponding stability constants Kpentamer(i) and Kdecamer(i). The thermodynamic model and the crystallographic structures described below both help to provide a framework for understanding the basis of the differences in the binding behaviors of compounds 1 and 2. Crystal Structures of SAP-Ligand Complexes—To establish the molecular structural basis of ligand-induced SAP oligomerization, crystal structures were determined for complexes formed between SAP and compound 1 at 10 mm (decamer SAP2·15) and at 40 mm (pentamer SAP·15) (crystal forms A and B, respectively), as well as for SAP bound to compound 2 at 40 mm (Table III). The oligomeric forms seen in the crystal structures are consistent with the distributions of oligomeric forms observed by DLS at different concentrations of compounds 1 and 2. Most surprisingly, however, compound 2 forms a decamer in which two of the expected ligands for the complex SAP2·25 are absent, producing a complex SAP2·23 with only three bivalent ligands present. In all of the complexes, the carboxylate group of the cyclic pyruvate ketal ring in each ligand coordinates directly to the two calcium ions of a single SAP protomer (Fig. 3). Direct interactions between negatively charged groups and both calcium ions are a common feature of the three previously characterized SAP complexes with 2′-deoxy-AMP (16Hohenester E. Hutchinson W.L. Pepys M.B. Wood S.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 570-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), MOβDG (25Thompson D. Pepys M.B. Tickle I. Wood S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and a bivalent d-proline analog (13Pepys M.B. Herbert J. Hutchinson W.L. Tennent G.A. Lachmann H.J. Gallimore J.R. Lovat L.B. Bartfai T. Alanine A. Hertel C. Hoffmann T. Jakob-Roetne R. Norcross R.D. Kemp J.A. Yamamura K. Suzuki M. Taylor G.W. Murray S. Thompson D. Purvis A. Kolstoe S. Wood S.P. Hawkins P.N. Nature. 2002; 417: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Each carboxylate oxygen atom directly coordinates to one calcium ion while simultaneously accepting a bifurcated hydrogen bond donated from a calcium ligand (Asn59 and Gln148) and shared with an oxygen acceptor within the pyruvate ketal ring (Fig. 3). The only other direct interactions between the protein and the ligand consist of van der Waals' contacts between the ligand methyl group and a hydrophobic pocket formed by side chains from Leu62, Tyr64, and Tyr74. This hydrophobic contact is also seen in the complex between SAP and MOβDG (25Thompson D. Pepys M.B. Tickle I. Wood S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the decameric complexes SAP2·15 and SAP2·23, separate pentamers are cross-linked by multiple bivalent ligands (Figs. 4 and 5). In the decameric complex SAP2·15, the planes of the two pentamer rings are nearly parallel (interplanar angle of 0.8°). All 10 Ca2+-binding sites are occupied by ligand in the same conformation, and the Ca2+-Ca2+ distances for each pair of cross-linked protomers lies within the range of 17.2-19.4 Å. A similar situation is seen in the decameric complex formed with 2′-deoxy-AMP (16Hohenester E. Hutchinson W.L. Pepys M.B. Wood S.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 570-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (interplanar angle of 0.1°, Ca2+-Ca2+ distances in the range of 10.9-11.0 Å). In contrast, the decameric complex SAP2·23 shows that the two pentamer rings are tilted relative to each other (interplanar angle of 4.6°). Moreover, only six of the 10 Ca2+-binding sites are occupied by ligand, with three pairs of opposing protomers being cross-linked by bivalent ligands and the remaining four"
https://openalex.org/W2104859416,"Although electrical coupling along the arteriolar endothelium is central in arteriolar conducted response and in control of vascular resistance, little is known about the pathophysiological effect of hypoxia and reoxygenation (H/R) on this coupling. We examined this effect in a monolayer of cultured microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) derived from wild-type (WT) or connexin (Cx)40-/- mice (Cx40 is a key gap junction protein in ECs). To assess electrical coupling, we used a current injection technique and Bessel function model to compute the monolayer intercellular resistance. Hypoxia (0.1% O2, 1 h) followed by abrupt reoxygenation (5-90 min) reduced coupling (i.e., increased resistance) in WT but not in Cx40-/- monolayer. H/R increased superoxide production and reduced protein kinase A (PKA) activity in both monolayers. Activation of PKA by 8-bromo-cAMP prevented the reduction in coupling. Preloading of the WT monolayer with the antioxidant ascorbate prevented reductions in both PKA activity and cell coupling. Inhibition of PKA with 6-22 amide during normoxia mimicked the reduction in coupling. Finally, hypoxia followed by slow reoxygenation caused no change in superoxide level, PKA activity, or coupling. Using intravital microscopy, we assessed the physiological relevance of these findings in terms of KCl-induced conducted vasoconstriction in arterioles of WT mouse cremaster muscle in vivo. Ischemia (1 h) followed by abrupt reperfusion (15-30 min) reduced conduction. 8-bromo-cAMP prevented this reduction, while 6-22 amide mimicked this reduction in control nonischemic arterioles. We propose that abrupt reoxygenation reduces interendothelial electrical coupling via oxidant- and PKA-dependent signaling that targets Cx40. We suggest that this mechanism contributes to compromised arteriolar function after H/R."

The results show a strong dependence of the relative stability of these bonds on the physico-chemical environment. A set of conditions has been identified in which the stability of polymers becomes comparable with that of the precursor monomers.

We have observed (Refs. 9Saladino R. Crestini C. Ciambecchini U. Ciciriello F Costanzo G. Di Mauro E. ChemBioChem. 2004; 5: 1558-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 10Saladino R.

ChemBioChem. 2005; 6: 1368-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar and references therein) that the one-carbon compound formamide is an highly versatile building block for the synthetic processes yielding all the necessary precursor nucleic bases. In terms of its possible role in allowing or favoring the formation of informational nucleic polymers, formamide chemistry also provides a possible solution to the lack of reactivity between ribose/deoxyribose with bases through a formose-like reaction yielding acyclonucleosides (10Saladino R. Ciambecchini U. Crestini C. Costanzo G. Negri R. Di Mauro E. ChemBioChem. 2003; 4: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The reported activity of formamide as activator of transphosphorylation (see “Discussion”) provides additional possible relevance to its role in prebiotic reactions leading to pre-genetic informational polymers. The plausibility of its prebiotic role is related to (i) its presence in interstellar medium, in comets and asteroids (12Millar T.J. Ehrenfreund P. Irvine W. Owen T. Becker L. Blank J. Brucato J. Colangeli L. Derenne S. Dutrey A. Despois D. Lazcano A. Robert F. Astrobiology: Future Perspectives. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston2004: 17-31Google Scholar), hence on early Earth; (ii) the ease of its formation by hydrolysis of HCN and its stability in liquid form over a wide range of temperatures (2.5-210 °C), thus favoring its concentration from dilute aqueous solutions; and (iii) the above mentioned catalyst-induced wealth of nucleic precursors. The question arises as to whether the physico-chemical conditions (moderately high temperature and varying concentration of formamide in water) allowing active synthesis and potentially leading to polymerization favor or impair the survival of the polymerized materials. In reconstructing the passage from monomers to the information-bearing polymers that we know at present, two major pieces of the mosaic are markedly missing: the knowledge of the mechanisms leading to the formation of the β-glycosidic and of the 3′-5′ phosphodiester bonds and, once the polymer had been formed, the physico-chemical reason(s) leading to its very survival as a polymer. In other words, which is the Darwinian selective advantage that overcame the intrinsically higher instability of the polymeric form? The analysis presented here focuses on the second question and is centered on two specific aspects: (i) we limit our analysis to DNA polymers and (ii) we explore the possibility that in formamide-containing solutions conditions exist in which the 3′- and the 5′-phosphoester bonds in the polymer are more stable than the corresponding ones in the monomer. The stability of the phosphoester bonds of nucleic acids was analyzed in the 1960s and 1970s under various physico-chemical conditions. For comprehensive reviews of initial studies, see Chapter 10 in Ref. 13Kochetov N.K. Budovskii E.I. Sverdlov E.D. Simukova N.A. Turchinskii M.F. Shibaev V.N. Kochetov N.K. Budovskii E.I. Organic Chemistry of Nucleic Acids. Plenum Press, London and New York1972: 477-532Google Scholar. These studies determined interesting differences, for instance, that the rate of cleavage of glycosidic bonds of free deoxynucleosides (14Shapiro R. Kang S. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 1806-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 15Garrett E.R. Mehta P.J. J. Am. Chem.

Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 5151-5154Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), that hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds in deoxynucleosides is >deoxynucleotides >DNA (17Shapiro H.S. Chargaff E. Biochim.

Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3610-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). At apurinic sites in DNA, the deoxyribose residue occurs in equilibrium between the free aldehyde and the furanose form, leading to the cleavage of the phosphodiester bonds at both 5′- and 3′-positions (Ref. 21Saladino R. Mincione E. Crestini C. Negri R. Di Mauro E. Costanzo G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5615-5619Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar and references therein). However, a systematic and comprehensive comparison of the stability of the phosphoester bonds in the precursor monomers (both ribo and 2′-deoxyribo) versus the stability of the same bonds when present in DNA and RNA was not performed. A set of clear conclusions allowing a definitive picture of the relative stabilities of the phosphoester bonds in DNA and in RNA under various conditions is lacking. We have undertaken this analysis. We report here two first sets of data on DNA: we have defined (i) the stability of the 3′- and the 5′-phosphoester bonds in a model deoxyribo oligonucleotide as a function of temperature and of the water/formamide w/w ratios and (ii) the stability of the 3′- and the 5′-phosphoester bonds in monophosphate deoxynucleosides under a corresponding set of conditions. The comparison of these two sets of data provides information relevant to the monomer-versus-polymer stability bias. Adenine, 2′-deoxyribose, 2′-deoxyribose 5′-monophosphate, 2′-deoxyadenosine, 2′-deoxyadenosine 5′-monophosphate, and 2′-deoxyadenosine 3′-monophosphate were from Sigma, analytical grade. Oligonucleotides—The degradation of oligonucleotides by formamide was studied on homogeneous polymers embedded in mixed sequence stretches. The overall approach consisted of the analysis of the degradation products of two synthetic 2′-deoxyoligonucleotides, each made of two short mixed sequence tails (10 and 6 bases, respectively) and of a central 30-base-long homogeneous stretch of As or Ts. The oligonucleotides used were Oli1, 5′-ACCTAACCGG(A)30CCGGTT-3′, and Oli2, 5′-CCCGAACCGG(T)30CCGGTT-3′. These oligonucleotides were designed such as to be complementary. Upon annealing, 4-nucleotide-long 5′-protruding tails remain at both extremities that can be used for selective labeling at 3′. In this study only the poly(dA) oligonucleotide (Oli1) was labeled and analyzed, as described (9Saladino R. Crestini C. Ciambecchini U. Ciciriello F Costanzo G. Di Mauro E. ChemBioChem. 2004; 5: 1558-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For 3′-labeling, 2 μg of each oligonucleotide were annealed with the same amount of the complementary oligo and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. Labeling was performed using T7 Sequenase (USBC; Amersham Biosciences). The labeled oligo was purified on a 16% denaturing acrylamide (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) gel, and the polyacrylamide was removed by a NuncTrap Probe purification column (Stratagene). 2 pmol (typically 30,000 cpm) of DNA were processed for each sample. For 5′-labeling, 2 μg of poly(dA) oligonucleotide (Oli1) were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Labeling was performed using polynucleotide kinase (Roche Applied Science), and the labeled oligo was purified and processed as above. HPLC Analysis—Samples were resuspended at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml in water or in the appropriate formamide reaction mixtures (usually in 0.5-1.0 ml). Temperatures and incubation times are indicated. 10-μl aliquots of the reaction mixtures were diluted to a final concentration of 50% formamide in a final volume of 20 μl and injected into a Supelcosil™ LC-18-S 5-μm HPLC column (Supelco) 15 cm × 4.6 mm. Elution was performed at a flow rate of 2 ml/min at room temperature with methanol:30 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 5.3 (2.5:97.5), UV = 254 nm, pressure = 1.5 atm, on a HPLC Beckman System Gold instrument. Identification of the peaks was performed by comparison with real samples. Oligonucleotide Degradation Protocols and Analyses—3′- and 5′-labeled oligonucleotides were treated under the time, temperature, and solution conditions indicated where appropriate. To stop the reaction a solution of 5 × 10-4 m (final concentration) of tetrasodium pyrophosphate (Sigma) dissolved in water was added to a final volume of 40 μl. The samples were vortexed for 1 min and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min. This procedure was performed twice. The wash was ethanol precipitated, resuspended in 5 μl of formamide buffer, heated for 2 min at 95 °C, and loaded on a 16% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide). For these methods, see also Ref. 9Saladino R. Crestini C. Ciambecchini U. Ciciriello F Costanzo G. Di Mauro E. ChemBioChem. 2004; 5: 1558-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar. Half-lives of the Bonds of the 3′- and 5′-Phosphoester Bonds in Oligonucleotides—For oligomers, the half-lives of the phosphodiester bonds were determined with standard procedure from plots similar to those reported in Figs. 2 and 3. Lines were drawn tangential to the initial part of the curves (i.e. Fig. 2), and the t12 was graphically determined.FIGURE 3As in Fig. 2, for the same oligo labeled at the 5′-extremity. The positions analyzed are the 11th and the 25th, as indicated. Filled symbols refer to a long-range kinetics (up to 4 h); open symbols refer to an experiment focusing on the initial part of the degradation reaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For the 3′-bonds, the half-life was calculated for the bonds located in three different positions from the label: the 7th, 20th, and 35th bonds, counting from the labeled extremity. We assumed that each bond in the poly(dA) stretch is cleaved with the same efficiency as the other bonds, and we have not taken into consideration poly(dA) internal nearest neighbor, sequence context, and cleavage-induced extremity effects, for which we have not observed any evidence. The homogeneity of cleavage in the poly(dA) stretch contrasts with the sequence dependence of formamide-induced cleavage rates. We have previously reported that the rate of cleavage in formamide is G ≥ A > C ≫ T (22Saladino R. Crestini C. Mincione E. Costanzo G. Di Mauro E. Negri R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 2041-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23Negri R. Costanzo G. Saladino R. Di Mauro E. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 910-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The focus of the present analysis is the determination of the stability of the 3′- and 5′-phosphoester bonds related to adenine. Based on these considerations, we assumed that the actual half-life of, say, the 7th bond is given by the experimentally determined value (that is, the % value of the band under consideration relative to the total signal of the lane) multiplied by 7 and divided by 2; that of, say, the 20th bond by the observed value multiplied by 20 and divided by 2, etc. This procedure was adopted to average out experimental imprecision (deriving from gel electrophoresis, image scanning, background subtractions, tangential lane drawing, etc.) and to verify the linearity of the analytical range. When cleaving a terminally labeled oligomer, this type of kinetic analysis is meaningfully performed only in the less than one cut/molecule range (typically, cleaved molecules <30%). Above this % value, multiple hits prevent reliable analysis. This procedure provides a quantitative evaluation of the linearity of the analyzed range: under ideal conditions the t12 of the 7th × 7 must correspond to that of the 20th × 20 and to that of the 35th × 35. To average out deviations from such correspondence, the t12 value is calculated as the average of one central position and of two positions close to the two opposite extremities. The data are reported “as the sample average value” μ ± the “sample S.D. value” σ of the t12 values obtained by this procedure in the three different positions. These are computed as shown in Equation 1.μ=(a+b+c)3σ=(a-μ)2+(b-μ)2+(c-μ)23 The positions were selected as indicative of a centrally located bond (the 20th) and of two oppositely located bonds proximal to the extremities (the 7th to the 3′- and the 35th to the 5′-extremity, respectively). For 5′, the same procedure was followed, analyzing the positions 11th and 25th from the 5′-labeled extremity (Fig. 3). The smearing of the upper part of the gel, typical for 5′-labeled oligos (9Saladino R. Crestini C. Ciambecchini U. Ciciriello F Costanzo G. Di Mauro E. ChemBioChem. 2004; 5: 1558-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), prevented analysis of more label-distal positions. For monomers, the t12 values were graphically calculated from the data reported in Figs. 6, 7, 8.FIGURE 7HPLC analysis of the degradation kinetics of 3′-monophosphate deoxyadenosine.

Panels B and C show two additional instances of the profiles obtained (25%, panel B; 100%, panel C). The treatments were always performed for two ranges of times, short (0-20 min) and long (20 min-12 h). The fast hydrolytic degradation of DNA and the regularity of the cleavage ladders are evident (panel A). Depurination is known to be faster than depyrimidination (11Saladino R. Crestini C. Neri V.

Turchinskii M.F. Shibaev V.N. Kochetov N.K. Budovskii E.I. Organic Chemistry of Nucleic Acids. Plenum Press, London and New York1972: 477-532Google Scholar). The degradations reported in the accompanying panels (B and C) performed in the presence of increasing amounts of formamide show that as a general trend formamide appreciably protects DNA from the hydrolytic process. The variations from this trend, namely at low formamide concentration and at high temperatures, are reported and discussed below. Fig. 2 shows the quantitative evaluation of this type of degradation experiment. Panel A shows the cleavage kinetics at three different positions of the oligomer (namely, the 7th, 20th, and 35th positions) in H2O. Considering the number of 3′-phosphoester bonds in this 46-mer oligonucleotide (= 45) and the slower hydrolysis of the bonds proximal to the 9 pyrimidine residues (22Saladino R. Crestini C. Mincione E. Costanzo G. Di Mauro E. Negri R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 2041-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23Negri R. Costanzo G. Saladino R. Di Mauro E. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 910-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), each phosphoester bond would account upon complete cleavage for ∼2.5% of the overall radioactive signal. Fig. 2A shows that this maximal value is rapidly reached for the 35th position (6.3 min); position 20 takes 14.7 min and position 7 48.4 min. The half-life is given by the projection on the abscissa of the intersection of the tangent with the ideal 1.25% line. In panel A the decrease of signal due to “multiple hits” becomes evident immediately after the maximum has been reached, as shown by the sloping down of curve a starting at 10 min and of curve b at 20 min. The multiple hit events being proportionally less frequent for the bond proximal to the labeled extremity (the 7th), no sloping effect is observed for curve c. The average t12 of the 3′-phosphoester bond under these conditions (90 °C, H2O) is 142 ± 24 min. Panel B describes the effect of increasing formamide on the 3′-phosphoester cleavage reported above: enhancement by the low concentrations (i.e. 3%, see below) and protection by the higher ones. The 5′-Bond—The same analysis was performed on the same oligo, labeled at the 5′-extremity. The resulting data are shown in Fig. 3. The average half-life of the 5′-phosphoester bond is 230 min ± 37 (90 °C, H2O). Formamide (panel B) has an overall protective effect. A detailed analysis was performed of the effect of temperature and formamide on the stability of the DNA chain. At the fixed time of 8 h, the kinetics of degradation was analyzed for the temperatures of 40, 50, 60, 70, 75, 80, and 90 °C at formamide concentrations of 0, 10, 25, 33, 66, and 100%. Fig. 4 shows two instances of this analysis on a 3′-labeled oligonucleotide. Panel A describes the increasing hydrolytic degradation as a function of increasing temperature in water; Panel B shows the effect of formamide on this degradation reaction. The data on panel B reveal that in the presence of formamide the degradation first increases as a function of the increasing temperature from 40 to 75 °C, then decreases at 80 °C (as shown by the arrow), and then increases again at 90 °C. This was taken as an indication of two different degradative reaction pathways, each dependent on a specific set of conditions (namely, dependent on the defined combination of temperature and water/formamide ratio). This observation was extended and confirmed by an extensive analysis of the effects of the physico-chemical variables (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5Scanning profiles of electrophoresis analyses similar to those shown in Fig. 4. The reactions were run at the formamide concentrations indicated on top and at the temperatures indicated on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 5 shows a series of scanning profiles obtained from electrophoretic analyses similar to those shown in Fig. 4, presented as a function of increasing temperature (vertical) and increasing formamide % (horizontal). The first vertical row from the left (H2O, 0% formamide) describes the effect of increasing temperature in enhancing the rate of hydrolysis. The diagnostic feature inside each panel is the displacement of the degradation profile from the origin of the scanned lane on the left (the leftmost peak corresponding to the uncleaved sample) toward the bottom of the lane (the right side of the plot). The results are interpreted according to the two following different degradation mechanisms. At temperatures ∼100 °C or above and in the absence of water, formamide reacts with both purine and pyrimidine nucleobases by nucleophilic addition at position C (8Westall F. Hofmann B. Brack B.

This reaction pathway can be referred to as Hydrolysis following Nucleobase Degradation (HND). 2The abbreviations used are: HNDhydrolysis following nucleobase degradationHNShydrolysis following nucleobase substitutionHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. hydrolysis following nucleobase degradation hydrolysis following nucleobase substitution high pressure liquid chromatography. In water the hydrolytic cleavages of the oligonucleotide occur following the direct cleavage of the β-glycosidic bond (mainly leading to the removal of the non-degraded base). This mechanism can be referred to as Hydrolysis following Nucleobase Substitution (HNS). Both hydrolytic pathways are detailed under “Discussion” and in Fig. 11A, pathways A and B. Inspection of the profiles (Fig. 5, three leftmost panels) of the samples treated at increasing concentrations of formamide revealed its increasingly protective effect against HNS hydrolysis, as evident in the upper horizontal rows of panels (40 and 50 °C, increasing formamide from left to right). The last vertical row on the right (100% formamide, increasing temperatures from top to bottom) shows patterns caused by β-elimination cleavage due to the HND pathway. This latter reaction is markedly sequence-dependent as indicated in the “80 °C-100%” panel. The order of cleavage is G ≥A > C ≫ T (21Saladino R. Mincione E. Crestini C. Negri R. Di Mauro E.

In conclusion, the left panels (both upper and bottom) show the products of hydrolysis following nucleobase substitution (HNS), whereas the panels on the right show the products of hydrolysis following nucleobase degradation (HND). HNS hydrolysis decreases from left to right and, in central panels, from top to bottom, as shown by the intermediate behavior observed at intermediate conditions, where the two mechanisms coexist. The chemical rational of these two reaction pathways is described under “Discussion.” The β-Glycosidic Bond—The stability of the β-glycosidic bond in nucleosides in water was determined in pioneering studies under several conditions (24Kochetov N.K. Budovskii E.I. Sverdlov E.D. Simukova N.A. Turchinskii M.F. Shibaev V.N. Kochetov N.K. Budovskii E.I. Organic Chemistry of Nucleic Acids. Plenum Press, London and New York1972: 425-448Google Scholar). We describe here the effect of formamide on the stability of this bond. Measurements were performed as a function of formamide concentration in water and of temperature. In addition to its interest per se, determination of the stability of this bond is a prerequisite for analysis of the stability of phosphoester bonds in nucleotides and in polymers thereof. Fig. 6 shows the HPCL analysis of the degradation of deoxyadenosine (%, ordinates) as a function of time (abscissa) and of the concentration of formamide in the aqueous medium (from 0 to 100%, as indicated in each panel). The upper right panel side provides the interpretation key. The red letters indicate the starting compound, in this case deoxyribose (dR) bound to the nucleic base (B), in this case adenine. The cleavage (arrow) of the glycosidic bond (red) yields a compound (deoxyribose; black) that is not detected under our conditions and the base (B, green). The same color code is used in the plots of the following figures. The kinetic disappearance of the deoxyadenosine (red line) is accompanied by the appearance of the base (green line). The two curves cross at 50% value (within minor experimental error). Thus, no other cleavage than that of the β-glycosidic bond occurs in this range of conditions. The half-life of this bond at 90 °C in water is 8.5 × 103 min. Increasing concentrations of formamide first decrease and then (>25%) markedly increase the stability of this bond. Fig. 9A summarizes this double effect exerted by increasing formamide on the stability of the β-glycosidic bond, observed both in the deoxyadenosine and in the deoxyadenosine monophosphate (these latter data are from Fig. 8). The 3′-Phosphoester Bond—In addition, the degradation rates of the 3′-monophosphate form of deoxyadenosine were analyzed as a function of both temperature and formamide concentrations (Fig. 7). The disappearance of the 3′-dAMP (blue) in water (upper panel) is matched by the appearance of the nucleoside (red), thus being primarily"

We use a new biophysical technique, involving the monitoring of the low energy circular dichroism spectra of 2-aminopurine residues site-specifically placed in the boxB RNA loop, to investigate this binding interaction. The low energy CD spectra of these 2-aminopurine probes reflect specific asymmetric interactions with adjacent nucleotide bases. Consequently, these CD spectra provide detailed and specific conformational information about the RNA chain at these chromophores that cannot be obtained from changes in the related fluorescence signals of these probes. CD changes were observed on binding the N peptide to boxB RNA that correspond to structural changes that had been previously seen by NMR, thus validating our experimental approach. The low energy CD method was then used to quantify the ordered and disordered states of the free hairpin loop and to show that a significant fraction of the boxB loop assumes a product-like structure in the absence of protein. A boxB derivative with an intact stem and a reduced concentration of ordered loop was identified and used to show that the extent of the reaction between protein and boxB depends on the concentration of structured loop in the RNA reactant population. This result has general implications for the conformational specificity of RNA-protein interactions.

Consequently, these CD spectra provide detailed and specific conformational information about the RNA chain at these chromophores that cannot be obtained from changes in the related fluorescence signals of these probes. CD changes were observed on binding the N peptide to boxB RNA that correspond to structural changes that had been previously seen by NMR, thus validating our experimental approach. The low energy CD method was then used to quantify the ordered and disordered states of the free hairpin loop and to show that a significant fraction of the boxB loop assumes a product-like structure in the absence of protein. A boxB derivative with an intact stem and a reduced concentration of ordered loop was identified and used to show that the extent of the reaction between protein and boxB depends on the concentration of structured loop in the RNA reactant population. This result has general implications for the conformational specificity of RNA-protein interactions. Protein N, which is coded by bacteriophage λ, regulates the transcription of phage genes during the lytic phase of growth by inducing an antitermination phenotype in the elongating transcription complex (1Friedman D. Gottesman M. Hendrix R.W. Roberts J.W. Stahl F.W. Weisberg R.A. Lambda II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983: 21-52Google Scholar, 2Greenblatt J. Nodwell J.R. Mason S.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In this process, N causes transcription of the delayed early genes of phage λ by stimulating read-through of intrinsic and Rho-dependent terminators located within a few kilobases downstream of the λ pL and pR promoters. The specificity of the N effect on these genes depends on the transcription of a λ sequence called nut (N-utilization), which codes for two RNA regulatory elements, designated boxA and boxB (3Salstrom J.S.

N peptide, the amino-terminal 22 amino acid residues of the λN protein, comprises a basic (arginine-rich) RNA binding domain. This peptide binds to boxB RNA with an affinity (Kd) of ∼10–9 m, which is close to the Kd measured for this interaction with the intact protein (7Van Gilst M.R. Rees W.A. Das A. von Hippel P.H.

As a consequence of the binding interaction with boxB RNA, the N peptide, which is largely unfolded in solution, assumes a bent α-helical conformation. BoxB, the specific target for λN binding on the RNA transcript, is an RNA hairpin that is 15 nucleotides in length with a stem that contains 5 stacked bp and a five-membered loop. NMR studies have shown that the peptide binds to the 5′ surface of the boxB hairpin and causes the loop to assume a structure identical to that of the GNRA tetraloop (13Heus H.A. Pardi A.

Formation of structured boxB RNA as a consequence of N binding appears to involve several conformational changes in the loop domain (Fig. 1). These include (i) increased stacking between bases at positions 7 and 8 of the loop, (ii) extrusion of the base at position 9 from the loop, which then does not participate in base stacking, and (iii) the induction of base stacking between nonadjacent residues at boxB positions 8 and 10. We have recently demonstrated that the low energy CD spectrum (i.e. the spectrum above 300 nm) of 2-aminopurine (2-AP) 4The abbreviations used are: 2-AP, 2-aminopurine; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; ssRNA, single-stranded RNA.4The abbreviations used are: 2-AP, 2-aminopurine; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; ssRNA, single-stranded RNA. can be used to observe conformational changes in the vicinity of a single mono- or dinucleotide residue within DNA (17Johnson N.P. Baase W.A. von Hippel P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3426-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). 2-AP is a structural isomer of adenine in which the amino group has been moved from position 6 to position 2 of the purine ring. Unlike adenine, 2-AP has a low energy electronic transition at 305 nm that is fluorescent (18Ward D.C. Reich E. Stryer L. J. Biol.

In particular, the incorporation of 2-AP into DNA does not significantly disrupt the structure or stability of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (20Eritja R. Kaplan B.E. Mhaskar D. Sowers L.C. Petruska J.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10200-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). DNA molecules that contain 2-AP residues exhibit two general types of low energy CD signals (17Johnson N.P. Baase W.A. von Hippel P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3426-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The first reflects exciton coupling between adjacent 2-AP bases stacked in a B-form right helical conformation, such as in dsDNA (28Johnson W.C. Tinoco I. Biopolymers. 1969; 8 (715–731): 409-432Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 29Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry. W.H.

This signal is characterized by a CD spectrum with a low energy positive peak located at a wavelength above the maximum UV absorbance of the 2-AP residue, no CD intensity at the absorbance maximum, and a negative band at lower wavelength. The negative band can be masked by the tail of the large CD signal of the oligonucleotides near 270 nm; thus, in practice, a positive band above 320 nm is often the most reliable indicator of exciton coupling between 2-AP residues. The second class of 2-AP-dependent low energy CD signals comprises a single band centered at the wavelength of maximum UV absorbance. This signal has been observed for 2-AP residues in DNA that are not adjacent and is characteristic of 2-AP dimers in conformations that do not permit exciton coupling. In this paper, we report the CD spectroscopic properties of nutR boxB RNA sequences (16Scharpf M. Sticht H. Schweimer K. Boehm M. Hoffmann S. Rosch P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2397-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) containing site-specifically inserted 2-AP residues (TABLES ONE and TWO). Since low energy CD is a new way to observe conformational features of RNA, we validate the technique by showing that the local conformational changes identified in the loop of the N-boxB complex by NMR structural studies can also be observed by CD measurements of these 2-AP-containing RNA hairpins. We then use this method to study the conformation of the loop sequence of boxB in ssRNA and in the hairpin. Results show that that, in the absence of protein, a significant fraction of the boxB RNA molecules assumes a conformation characteristic of the “product conformation” that is observed in the N peptide-boxB complex. Finally, we use boxB derivatives with an intact stem and different fractions of structured loop to show that specific binding with the N peptide depends on the quantity of structured loop in free boxB RNA. These results have general consequences for the binding mechanisms of specific RNA-protein interactions (see “Discussion”).TABLE ONEOligonucleotide sequences capable of forming stem-loop structures and their designationsOligonucleotideSequenceAP05′-GCCCUGAAAAAGGGC-3′AP75′-GCCCUGXAAAAGGGC-3′AP85′-GCCCUGAXAAAGGGC-3′AP95′-GCCCUGAAXAAGGGC-3′AP105′-GCCCUGAAAXAGGGC-3′AP785′-GCCCUGXXAAAGGGC-3′AP895′-GCCCUGAXXAAGGGC-3′AP8105′-GCCCUGAXAXAGGGC-3′ Open table in a new tab TABLE TWOOligonucleotide sequences with disrupted stem-loop structures and their designationsOligonucleotideSequenceAP05′-GCCCUGAAAAAGGGC-3′AP0d5′-GCCCUGAAAAAGGCG-3′AP810d5′-GCCCUGAXAXAGGCG-3′AP810p5′-GCCCUGAXAXAAGGC-3′ssR05′-GCCCUGAAAAACGCG-3′ssR95′-GCCCUGAAXAACGCG-3′ssR895′-GCCCUGAXXAACGCG-3′ssR8105′-GCCCUGAXAXACGCG-3′ssRC3′-CGGGACUUUUUGCGC-5′ssD05′-GCCCTGAAAAACGCG-3′ssD895′-GCCCTGAXXAACGCG-3′ssDC3′-CGGGACTTTTTGCGC-5′ Open table in a new tab Chemicals, Peptides, and Oligonucleotides—N peptide (NH2-MDA QTR RRE RRA EKQ AQW KAA N-COOH) was purchased from Global Peptide Service (Fort Collins, CO), and peptide concentrations were determined by UV absorbance, using a molar absorptivity (ϵ280) of 5600 m–1 cm–1. Oligonucleotides, synthesized and high pressure liquid chromatography-purified by Qiagen or TriLink Biotechnologies, were dissolved in buffer, heated to 70 °C, and slowly cooled. Concentrations were determined from the A260 values of single-stranded oligonucleotides at 80 °C, using the recently reported molar absorptivity values of Cavaluzzi and Borer (31Cavaluzzi M.J. Borer P.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e13Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and a molar absorptivity of 1700 m –1 cm–1 for the 2-aminopurine monophosphate residue (19Smagowic J. Wierzchowski K.L. J. Luminescence. 1974; 8: 210-232Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The concentration units used for RNA are expressed in mol of oligonucleotide/liter. Unless otherwise stated, experiments were performed at 20 °C in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl and 0.1 mm EDTA. Measurement of Fluorescence and CD Spectra and Thermal Melting Experiments—Fluorescence spectra were measured using a Jobin-Yvon Fluorolog spectrometer. Samples in a 10 × 4-mm cuvette, with the long path length oriented in the direction of the incident light, were excited at 305 nm, and emission spectra between 310 and 450 nm were recorded; results are reported as counts/s at the emission maximum near 370 nm. CD spectra (3.5–8 μmol of oligonucleotide/liter) were taken at wavelengths between 450 and 200 nm on a Jasco model J-720 CD spectrometer equipped with a thermostated cell holder. The results are the average of 8–20 spectra and are presented as Δϵ, the difference in molar extinction coefficient of left and right circularly polarized light, per mol of residue. Low energy CD intensities at wavelengths greater than 300 nm are presented on a per mol of 2-AP residue present basis (units, liter(mol of 2-AP)–1 cm)–1). Thermal denaturation experiments were performed by increasing the temperature of the cuvette by 2 °C/min, and melting was monitored by UV absorbance at 260 nm or by CD at the indicated wavelength. ssRNA and dsRNA—Since the low energy CD method had not previously been used to study RNA, we first characterized the CD properties of ssRNA and dsRNA oligonucleotides labeled with 2-AP at specific sites. The ssRNA molecules that we have designated ssR0, ssR9, ssR89, and ssR810 (see TABLE TWO for the nomenclature of the oligonucleotides used) have the same sequence as boxB RNA, except for permutations in the stem sequence that disrupt base pairing. Equimolar concentrations of the complementary RNA oligonucleotide ssRC were added to form the corresponding dsRNA molecules, dsR0, dsR9, dsR89, and dsR810. Thermal melting increased the absorbance at 260 nm of these dsRNA complexes by 25% and showed a cooperative transition with a melting temperature (Tm) of 74 °C for all of the molecules examined. These results demonstrate that 2-AP residues do not significantly disrupt the stability of dsRNA, as also previously reported for dsDNA (20Eritja R. Kaplan B.E. Mhaskar D. Sowers L.C. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 5869-5884Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). As expected, incorporation of single-stranded oligonucleotides containing 2-AP residues into dsRNA molecules resulted in significant quenching of the 2-AP fluorescence intensity (TABLE THREE) and, in general, increased the magnitude of the low energy CD signals in parallel to the fluorescence quenching. However, as shown in what follows, because the low energy CD spectra reflect the asymmetry of the conformational relationships between 2-AP residues and immediately adjacent stacked (or unstacked) bases or base pairs, this method provides much more specific and detailed information about local conformation within the RNA chain than do the 2-AP fluorescence changes.TABLE THREEFluorescence intensity of polynucleotides containing AP (counts/s per μm AP × 103)OligonucleotideFl (RNA alone)aFluorescence of the RNA alone.Oligonucleotide complexFl (after formation of double-stranded complexes)bThe same fluorescence as in column 2 after formation of double-stranded complexes (results for ssR9, ssR89, and ssR810) or after titration with N (the remaining results).ssR915dsR091.0ssR893.2ds890.58ssR8104.9ds8101.5AP713AP7-N6.3AP820AP8-N7.9AP923AP9-N50AP1019AP10-N14AP780.85AP78-N0.07AP891.5AP89-N1.2AP8101.4AP810-N0.66a Fluorescence of the RNA alone.b The same fluorescence as in column 2 after formation of double-stranded complexes (results for ssR9, ssR89, and ssR810) or after titration with N (the remaining results). Open table in a new tab The low energy CD spectra (Fig. 2, A and C) of ssR0 exhibited a small trough at 311 nm. At 0 °C, the CD spectrum of ssR9 displayed a similar trough at 311 nm, which disappeared at 20 °C. The low energy CD spectrum of ssR810 showed a shoulder near 315 nm. The CD spectrum of ssR89 exhibited more structure than the other derivatives, with a low energy peak and a high energy trough centered at around 315 nm. This spectroscopic signal is characteristic of base stacking between adjacent 2-AP residues (17Johnson N.P. Baase W.A. von Hippel P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3426-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Formation of dsRNA molecules dramatically increased the intensity of the CD spectrum above 300 nm and changed its sign (Fig. 3A), largely as a consequence of the appearance of a trough at 300 nm. To isolate the effect of the 2-AP residue, the CD spectrum of dsR0 was subtracted from that of the double-stranded molecules containing 2-AP residues (Fig. 3A, insert). The intensities of these difference spectra were 2.5 times larger at 0 °C than at 20 °C. No CD signal was observed for the difference spectra of dsR9 at 0 °C or 20 °C. The CD difference spectrum of dsR810 showed a single band at 320 nm, as expected for 2-AP residues that are not adjacent (17Johnson N.P. Baase W.A. von Hippel P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3426-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A single negative band at 316 nm was also observed in the CD difference spectrum of dsR89, indicating that there is no exciton coupling between the adjacent 2-AP residues in this construct (17Johnson N.P. Baase W.A. von Hippel P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3426-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast, the CD spectra of a dsDNA oligonucleotide with the same sequence as dsR89 (TABLE TWO, third section) exhibited exciton bands centered at 320 nm (Fig. 3B). This result suggests that different low energy CD spectra of adjacent 2-AP residues in dsRNA and dsDNA may reflect the A-form and the B-form oligonucleotide conformations, respectively. Consistent with this conclusion, we have previously shown that adjacent 2-AP residues in the DNA strand of an A-form RNA-DNA hybrid oligonucleotide also did not exhibit exciton coupling (17Johnson N.P. Baase W.A. von Hippel P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3426-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, we have found more recently that the presence or absence of exciton coupling in A-form RNA-DNA hybrid duplexes may be sensitive to the local sequence context of the 2-AP probes. 5K. Datta, unpublished results. This issue is currently being explored further with relevant RNA-DNA hybrid sequences. The BoxB Hairpin—Oligonucleotides with complementary sequences at the 5′- and 3′-extremities (TABLE ONE) form hairpin structures. The formation of a stem-loop structure can change the fluorescence of the included 2-AP residues by a factor of 2–3. The sign and magnitude of this fluorescence intensity change varies with the position of the 2-AP residue(s) in the loop (TABLE THREE). The low energy CD spectra of boxB hairpins containing 2-AP residues are remarkably different from the CD spectra of the corresponding ssRNA with 2-AP at the same position (Fig. 2). The spectrum of a boxB hairpin containing a 2-AP residue located at position 7 (AP7) showed a small trough at 312 nm and could not be distinguished from the CD signal of the stem-loop with no 2-AP residues. The CD spectra of AP8, AP9, and AP10 showed peaks at 320 nm, with intensities of 1.7, 2.4, and 0.6 liter(mol of 2-AP)–1 cm–1, respectively. No exciton coupling is expected for these molecules, and the CD has a maximum intensity at the same wavelength as the UV absorbance. The CD spectra of AP89 and AP810 contained peaks at 317 nm with intensities of 1.9 and 0.95 liter(mol of 2-AP)–1 cm–1, respectively (Fig. 2D). Hence the exciton coupling that was observed in the CD spectrum of ssR89 (Fig. 2C) disappeared in AP89. In contrast, the spectrum of AP78 showed a peak at 325 nm and a trough at 317 nm, indicating base stacking (17Johnson N.P. Baase W.A. von Hippel P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3426-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Differences between the CD signals obtained with ssRNA and an RNA stem-loop can be explained by the conformational changes that occur when the boxB sequence forms a stem-loop (see “Discussion”). The N-BoxB Complex—In order to determine that binding of the N peptide to the various boxB derivatives was complete under our reaction conditions, we titrated oligonucleotides with N peptide and monitored the fluorescence quenching of the 2-AP residues of the various boxB constructs (Fig. 4). Binding N peptide increases base stacking in the loop and can also be followed by UV hypochromism (not shown). Peptide binding decreased the fluorescence intensities of all of the derivatives tested except AP9 (TABLE THREE). The intensity of the AP9 fluorescence was increased by N binding as a result of a decrease in the quenching of 2-AP residues caused by interactions with neighboring nucleotide residues (32Jean J.M. Hall K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Fluorescence titration curves show that 3.7 μm AP7, AP8, and AP9 bind N peptide with a 1:1 stoichiometry. Similar binding curves were observed for AP78 and AP89 (data not shown). However, well defined equivalence points were not observed with this concentration of AP10 or AP810. Rather both of these oligonucleotides bound N peptide with a reduced apparent Kd value of ∼5 μm. These results permitted us to establish the concentration conditions under which the N peptide binds quantitatively to various 2-AP-modified boxB RNA constructs. The binding of N peptide changed the intensities of the low energy CD spectra of boxB derivatives containing a single 2-AP residue differently, depending on the position of the 2-AP residue within the construct (Fig. 5). Thus, complex formation increased the intensity of the CD spectra of AP7 and AP8 by a factor of 2–3. The low energy CD of AP10 remained small, even in the presence of a 2-fold excess of N peptide, although under these conditions binding is expected to occur (Fig. 4). N peptide decreased the CD of AP9, and no CD intensity above 310 nm was observed for AP9 in the presence of a 1.4-fold excess of N peptide (data not shown). The addition of equimolar N peptide to a boxB hairpin containing two adjacent 2-AP residues did not change the shapes of the low energy CD spectra (Fig. 6, A and B). The CD band at 325 nm that was observed for AP78 is also present in the CD spectrum of the complex, although the intensity of the spectrum for the complex was increased by a factor of 2.5. In contrast, peptide binding increased the CD peak of AP89 at 317 nm by only 20%. Comparison of the low energy CD spectra of AP810 in the presence and absence of N peptide shows that N binding increased the intensity of the CD spectrum above 320 nm and decreased the intensity at lower wavelengths (Fig. 6C). It is possible that the N peptide may not bind AP810 to saturation at these oligonucleotide concentrations (Fig. 4). We therefore measured the CD spectra of AP810 in the presence of a 2-fold excess of N peptide. Excess peptide increased the intensity of the peak at 325 nm from 1.1 to 1.2 liter(mol of 2-AP)–1 cm–1 and decreased the trough at 320 nm from 0.6 to 0.4 liter(mol of 2-AP)– 1 cm–1. These results indicate the presence of base stacking between 2-AP residues at positions 8 and 10 in the N-boxB complex, consistent with NMR results showing that N peptide binding induces a GNRA tetraloop conformation in boxB (14Su L.

J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2397-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Tetraloop Formation in the Absence of Peptide—These latter results indicate that CD changes due to base stacking between AP residues located at loop positions 8 and 10 can be used to monitor tetraloop formation. Such base stacking may contribute to the shape of the low energy CD spectrum of hairpin construct AP810 (Fig. 6C). An apparent CD band is observed in the spectrum of the hairpin, with a small positive intensity (∼+0.2 liter(mol of 2-AP)–1 cm–1) at 325 nm and a negative signal (∼–0.17 liter(mol of 2-AP)–1 cm–1) at 312 nm, compared with the ssRNA control. These results suggest that formation of a stem-loop structure within an ssRNA molecule that carries the boxB sequence results in the formation of a measurable population of tetraloop, even in the absence of N peptide. If this hypothesis is correct, destabilizing the loop would be expected to disrupt the putative tetraloop conformation. We therefore decreased the stability of the hairpin by introducing mismatches into the stem and measured the CD. The AP810p and AP810d constructs are derivatives of AP810, with one proximal and two distal mismatches in the stem sequence, respectively (TABLE TWO, second section). The effect of the mismatch on the stem structure was determined from the CD spectra below 300 nm, which reflect the presence of single-stranded DNA or dsDNA. AP810 and AP810p have identical CD bands at 267 nm (Fig. 7A). The intensity of this peak decreases by half and undergoes a 4-nm red shift in the CD spectrum of AP810d, resulting in a signal that corresponds to the spectrum of the ssRNA oligonucleotide, ssR810. These results suggest that under our reaction conditions, the oligonucleotides AP810 and AP810p have hairpin structures with an intact stem. In contrast, the two distal mismatches of AP810d destabilize the stem, and, judging from the CD spectrum, this oligonucleotide assumes the unstructured conformation expected for the equivalent ssRNA. Based on the intensities of the low energy CD spectrum (Fig. 6D), AP810d (which has no stem-loop structure) showed no base stacking between AP residues. AP810p, with one proximal mismatch, displayed base stacking that was intermediate between that shown by AP810 and AP810d. These results suggest that the tetraloop structure in the AP810p construct is reduced by ∼50% compared with AP810 by a mismatch near the loop that does not destroy the hairpin stem. Low energy CD measurements of oligonucleotides containing 2-AP residues can probe the secondary structure of DNA at the mono- and dinucleotide levels (17Johnson N.P. Baase W.A. von Hippel P.H. Proc.

https://openalex.org/W2164108953,"Both Rad51 and Rad52 are required for homologous genetic recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Rad51 promotes heteroduplex joint formation, a general step in homologous recombination. Rad52 facilitates the binding of Rad51 to replication protein A (RPA)-coated single-stranded DNA. The requirement of RPA can be avoided in vitro, if the single-stranded DNA is short. Using short single-stranded DNA and homologous double-stranded DNA, in the absence of RPA, we found that Rad52 (optimal at three per Rad51) was still required for Rad51-promoted heteroduplex joint formation in vitro, as assayed by the formation of D-loops, suggesting another role for Rad52. Rad51 has to bind to the single-stranded DNA before the addition of double-stranded DNA for efficient D-loop formation. Immunoprecipitation and single-stranded DNA-bead precipitation analyses revealed the presence of the free and DNA-bound complexes of Rad51 and Rad52 at a 1 to 2 stoichiometry. In the presence of single-stranded DNA, in addition to Rad51, Rad52 was required for extensive untwisting that is an intermediate step toward D-loop formation. Thus, these results suggest that the formation of the stoichiometric complex of Rad52 with Rad51 on single-stranded DNA is required for the functional binding of the protein-single-stranded DNA complex to the double-stranded DNA to form D-loops.

Homologous genetic (or DNA) recombination is required for the precise repair of DNA double strand breaks and for the disjunction of homologous chromosomes during meiosis that generates genetic variation within species. A heteroduplex joint, formed by the pairing of a single-stranded DNA-tail derived from a double strand break with the complementary sequence within intact homologous double-stranded DNA, is a general intermediate of homologous recombination. In vitro, RecA of Escherichia coli efficiently promotes the formation of heteroduplex joints (“homologous pairing”) between closed circular double-stranded DNA and homologous single-stranded DNA fragments (the products are called “D-loops” (1McEntee K.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51, a protein homologous to RecA (6Aboussekhra A. Chanet R. Adjiri A. Fabre F. Mol. Cell.

In this reaction, RPA is required for removing secondary structures in the circular single-stranded DNA substrate (8Namsaraev E. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5359-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol.

Rad51 alone promotes the formation of D-loops between closed circular double-stranded DNA and short single-stranded DNA fragments, although it is much less efficient than RecA (11Tracy R.B.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1148-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The heteroduplex joint formation promoted by Rad51 is extensively stimulated in the presence of either Rad54 or Rdh54/Tid1 (13Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 14Petukhova G. Sung P. Klein H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It is believed that Rad51 plays a key role in heteroduplex joint formation during homologous recombination, but it requires one or more other proteins for the reaction. Some limited cases of mitotic homologous recombination require Rad52, but not Rad51. In vitro, Rad52 binds to both single- and double-stranded DNA molecules and promotes annealing between complementary single-stranded DNA molecules (15Mortensen U.H. Bendixen C. Sunjevaric I.

In the case of human Rad52, it was shown to promote the formation of D-loops between closed circular double-stranded DNA and short single-stranded DNA fragments, under conditions very different from those required for the formation of D-loops by either RecA or Rad51 (18Kurumizaka H.

In vitro, Rad52 stimulates Rad51- and RPA-promoted heteroduplex joint formation between circular single-stranded DNA and linear double-stranded DNA (28Sung P. J. Biol.

RPA is required for this reaction, but the binding of Rad51 to single-stranded DNA is inhibited by previously bound RPA on the single-stranded DNA. Thus, it is assumed that Rad52 promotes the loading of Rad51 onto the RPA-coated circular single-stranded DNA and stabilizes Rad51 binding to the single-stranded DNA (29Song B. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15895-15904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 33New J.H. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol.

By the use of a short single-stranded DNA that bypasses the requirement of RPA for heteroduplex joint formation, we now show that Rad52 plays an additional important function in the Rad51-promoted formation of D-loops. Taq DNA polymerase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, and all restriction endonucleases were purchased from Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. Pfu polymerase was obtained from Promega Co. Hydroxyapatite (Bio-Gel HTP) was purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories. Micro Spin S-400 HR column, Probe Quant G-50 Micro Column, and the Q-Sepharose FF, Mono Q HR5/5, and Sephacryl S-300 HR matrices were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Phage DNAs—We used the methods described by Cunningham et al. (35Cunningham R.P. DasGupta C. Shibata T. Radding C.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 223-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) for the preparation of circular single-stranded DNA and form I DNA of phage M13mp19 (M13) and ϕx174. Circular pUC119 single-stranded DNA was prepared according to the method described by the same authors (35Cunningham R.P. DasGupta C. Shibata T. Radding C.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 223-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA—The plasmid pNS11, carrying ARG4 gene together with part of the DED81 gene of S. cerevisiae, was kindly provided by Dr. Ohta of RIKEN Discovery Research Institute. The plasmid was constructed by the insertion of a PstI fragment containing part of DED81 and ARG4, which has a hot-spot region of genetic recombination in meiosis (36Wu T.C. Lichten M. Science. 1994; 263: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 37Liu J. Wu T.C. Lichten M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4599-4608Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), into the PstI site of pUC119. Form I DNA of pNS11, harbored in E. coli XL1-Blue MRF′, was prepared by disruption with lysozyme and Sarkosyl, extraction with phenol, and sucrose-gradient centrifugation, as described by Cunningham et al. (35Cunningham R.P. DasGupta C. Shibata T. Radding C.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 223-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The presence of the hot-spot sequence did not stimulate (or inhibit) the formation of D-loops by Rad51-Rad52 (data not shown). Linear Double-stranded DNA—Linear double-stranded DNA of ϕx174am3 was prepared by digestion of form I DNA by PstI. The pNS11 linear double-stranded DNA was generated by EcoRV cleavage near the middle of the insert containing the ARG4 gene. These DNAs were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Linear Single-stranded DNA—Single-stranded DNA fragments of pNS11 (259 bases), which contained a downstream 20-base region of a meiotic double strand break site (37Liu J. Wu T.C. Lichten M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4599-4608Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), were prepared as follows: first, pNS11 double-stranded DNA fragments (pNS11dsf) were amplified by PCR in a mixture containing 1 ng of pNS11, 0.25 mm dNTP, 0.5 μm AG4dsF primer (ACTTTTTGGATAAGCTGGCG), AG4dfR primer (GAAGAACCTGTTGAATAGGCG), 0.05 unit/μl Taq DNA polymerase, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, and 1.5 mm MgCl2 (total 50 μl). The mixture was preincubated for 3 min at 95 °C, and then was subjected to 25 cycles of amplification at 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C, followed by 5 min at 72 °C. The amplified pNS11dsf was purified on a Micro Spin S-400 HR column. Then, we amplified the pNS11 single-stranded DNA fragments in a mixture (total of 500 μl) containing pNS11dsf (50 μl), 2 μm AG4sfD primer (GGAAGAGACGCATTGTAAAGG), 0.25 mm dNTP, and 0.03 unit/μl Pfu polymerase in Pfu buffer (Promega Co.). The reaction conditions were as follows: 1 min at 94 °C, and 20 cycles for 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. The amplified pNS11 single-stranded DNA fragments were separated on a 3.0% NuSieve GTG-agarose gel (BMA Products), recovered with a SUPREC-01 spin filter (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.), and concentrated by ethanol precipitation. Fragments of single-stranded pUC119 DNA were prepared by digestion of its circular single-stranded DNA with HaeIII (10–15 units of HaeIII per microgram of single-stranded DNA), incubated for 16 h at 37 °C). This pUC119 single-stranded DNA fragments digestion yields 13 putative fragments from 56 to 2,830 bases. The pNS11 single-stranded DNA fragments and pUC119 single-stranded DNA fragments were 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled DNA was purified with a Probe Quant G-50 Micro Column, and by phenol-chloroform extraction, and then was precipitated by ethanol in the presence of ammonium acetate. The concentrations of these DNAs are expressed as the molar concentration of nucleotide residues. Relaxed Double-stranded DNA (Form IV DNA)—M13 form I DNA (3.3 μg) was incubated with 30 units of calf thymus DNA topoisomerase I (Promega) for 1 hat 37 °C, and the relaxed double-stranded DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. RecA was prepared from E. coli DR1453, as described by Shibata et al. (38Shibata T. Osber L. Radding C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), except that Mono Q HR5/5 was used instead of DEAE-cellulose. The concentration of RecA was determined based on the extinction coefficient determined by Tsang et al. (39Tsang S.S. Muniyappa K. Azhderian E. Gonda D.K. Radding C.M. Flory J. Chase J.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 295-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). RPA was prepared from S. cerevisiae CG378, as described by Alani et al. (40Alani E. Thresher R. Griffith J.D. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 54-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The purified RPA was dialyzed against a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol. The concentration of RPA was determined based on the extinction coefficient provided by Sugiyama et al. (9Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). We confirmed that the purified RPA stimulated the homologous pairing and strand exchange between circular single-stranded DNA and linear double-stranded DNA promoted by Rad51. Plasmid and Strain—The expression plasmid (pT7-Sc51) carrying the RAD51 gene was kindly provided by Dr. Shinohara of Osaka University (7Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). The plasmid was introduced into E. coli BLR(DE3), which is an recA-deficient strain. The expression of Rad51 by the strain was induced as described by Shinohara et al. (7Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Purification—For the purification of Rad51, the following buffers were used: lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 3 mm EDTA, 200 mm KCl, 20% sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 10 mm dithiothreitol; buffer A containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm PMSF; buffer B containing 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2 mm PMSF; buffer C containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.2 mm PMSF; Rad buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 100 mm KCl. During the purification, Rad51 was monitored by measuring the single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity and by SDS-PAGE. All purification procedures were performed on ice or at 4 °C. The cells (80 g) were suspended in 160 ml of lysis buffer, and, after lysozyme was added to 1 mg/ml, the mixture was incubated for 30 min. After the addition of Brij58 to a final concentration of 0.4%, the mixture was allowed to stand for 30 min. The crude extract (fraction I, 220 ml, 2,000 mg of protein) was recovered by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. To fraction I, Polymin P (pH 7.5, BMH Chemicals Ltd.) was added to 0.3%, and the mixture was stirred for 20 min. The precipitates, which were collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min, were resuspended in 80 ml of buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl, and the suspension was stirred for 30 min. The precipitates were again recovered by centrifugation, and Rad51 was extracted with 160 ml of buffer A containing 1.1 m NaCl, by homogenizing and stirring for 1 h. After centrifugation, ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 35% saturation. The resulting precipitates were recovered, dissolved in buffer A containing 200 mm NaCl, and then dialyzed against the same buffer (fraction II, 9.8 ml, 100 mg of protein). Fraction II was applied to a Q-Sepharose FF column (1.6 × 10 cm) equilibrated with buffer A containing 200 mm NaCl. The column was washed with 45 ml of the same buffer, and was eluted with 150 ml of a linear gradient of NaCl from 200 to 600 mm. Rad51, which eluted at 370 mm NaCl, was pooled (fraction III, 21 ml, 47 mg of protein). Fraction III was applied to a column of hydroxyapatite Bio-Gel HTP (1.5 × 6.2 cm) equilibrated with buffer B. After washing the column with 12 ml of buffer B, the proteins were eluted with 90 ml of a linear gradient of potassium phosphate from 20 to 200 mm. Rad51, which eluted at 70 mm phosphate, was pooled (fraction IV, 16 ml, 14 mg of protein). Fraction IV was concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (45% saturation), dissolved in 2 ml of buffer C containing 200 mm KCl, and fractionated on a Sephacryl S-300 HR gel filtration column (2.2 × 41 cm) that had been equilibrated with buffer C containing 200 mm KCl. Rad51, which eluted in the void volume, was pooled (fraction V, 4.3 ml, 5.5 mg of protein). Fraction V was applied to a Mono Q HR5/5 column equilibrated with buffer C containing 200 mm KCl. The column was washed with 5 ml of the same buffer, and the proteins were eluted with 20 ml of a linear gradient of KCl from 200 to 700 mm. Rad51, which eluted at 410 mm KCl, was pooled (fraction VI, 1.0 ml, 2.5 mg of protein). Fraction VI was diluted with 2 volumes of buffer C and was fractionated again on a Mono Q HR5/5 column, equilibrated with buffer C containing 200 mm KCl and 5% glycerol. The column was washed with 1 ml of the same buffer, and the proteins were eluted with 20 ml of a linear gradient of KCl from 200 to 600 mm. Rad51 eluted at 420 mm KCl, and was pooled. The pooled fraction was dialyzed against Rad buffer, and then 20-μl aliquots were stored at –80 °C (fraction VII, 0.63 ml, 1.04 mg of protein, 36 μm). The molar concentration of Rad51 in fraction VII was determined from the extinction coefficient reported by Sugiyama et al. (9Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The purified Rad51 exhibited a single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity similar to that described by Sung (10Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). It also promoted homologous pairing and strand exchange between circular single-stranded DNA and linear double-stranded DNA in the presence of RPA, at a stoichiometry of one Rad51 molecule per four nucleotides of the single-stranded DNA (data not shown). Cloning—The PCR-amplified RAD52 open reading frame (ORF) from the first ATG codon was cloned from S. cerevisiae CG378 genomic DNA, after PCR amplification with the primers RAD52N (ACGCGACCGGTATCATATG), which encodes an NdeI site, and Rad52C (AGCGTTTCAAGTAGCTTGC). The sequence of the RAD52 ORF was confirmed by DNA sequencing. For expression from the third ATG codon (16Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) in the RAD52 ORF, a fragment between NdeI and NspV in the cloned RAD52 ORF was replaced between the same restriction endonuclease sites by a fragment of a PCR product amplified with the primers R52ATG3 (GGCTTTGGTGTGTTGCATATGAATG) and R52FC (GGATCGAACTTCACCTTATCG), and the RAD52 ORF was cloned into the pET3a vector (pNS97). Expression—The E. coli BLR(DE3) strain carrying pNS97 was cultured in 12 liters of LB medium, containing 1% Tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 1% NaCl (pH 7.5), with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol, at 30 °C. The expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Purification—For the purification of Rad52, the following buffers were used: buffer K containing 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol; buffer T containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol; and lysis buffer and Rad buffer, which were the same as those buffers for Rad51. During the purification, Rad52 was monitored by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis. All purification procedures were performed on ice or at 4 °C. The cells (32 g) expressing Rad52 were suspended in 64 ml of lysis buffer and disrupted with lysozyme and Brij58, as described for the Rad51 purification. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 1 h), and the supernatant (fraction I, 88 ml, 1,047 mg of protein) was treated with ammonium sulfate to 30% saturation. The resulting precipitate was dissolved in buffer K containing 200 mm NaCl, and was dialyzed against the same buffer (fraction II, 12 ml, 160 mg of protein). Fraction II was diluted to 150 mm KCl with buffer K, and applied to a column of SP-Sepharose FF (1.6 × 5.0 cm) equilibrated with buffer K containing 150 mm NaCl. The column was then washed with 30 ml of the same buffer, and the proteins were eluted with 90 ml of a linear gradient of NaCl from 150 to 500 mm in buffer K. Rad52, which eluted at 280 mm NaCl, was pooled (fraction III, 21 ml, 41 mg of protein). Fraction III was concentrated by the addition of ammonium sulfate to 35% saturation, and was applied to a Sephacryl S-300 HR column (2.2 × 41 cm) equilibrated with buffer T containing 200 mm NaCl. Rad52, which eluted in the void volume, was pooled (fraction IV, 8.0 ml, 15 mg of protein). This fraction was diluted to 150 mm NaCl with buffer T, and was applied to a Mono Q HR5/5 column equilibrated with buffer T containing 150 mm NaCl. The column was developed with 20 ml of a linear gradient of NaCl, from 150 to 650 mm in buffer T. Rad52 was eluted at 180 mm NaCl. The fraction was pooled, dialyzed against Rad buffer (fraction V, 1.2 ml, 3.58 mg of protein, 54 μm), and stored at –80 °C. In the buffer described by Shinohara et al. (16Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), which contained 50% glycerol, Rad52 tended to aggregate and precipitate. The molar concentration of Rad52 in fraction V was determined from the extinction coefficient reported by New et al. (31New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The purified Rad52 exhibited annealing activity between complementary single-stranded DNAs (data not shown) and stimulated (data not shown) the strand exchange by Rad51 and RPA, at the same stoichiometry of Rad52 as described by New and Kowalczykowski (33New J.H. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26171-26176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). ATPase was assayed as described by Shibata et al. (38Shibata T. Osber L. Radding C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), except that [α-32P]ATP was used instead of [α-3H]ATP as the substrate. The products were analyzed by a Variable Image Analyzer Typhoon 8600 (Molecular Dynamics). Standard D-loop Assay—Heteroduplex joint formation was assayed by using the method developed for the homologous pairing assay described previously (41Arai N. Kawasaki K. Shibata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3514-3522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with some modifications. The standard reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 0.4 μm [32P]pNS11 single-stranded DNA fragments, 60 μm pNS11 form I DNA, 0.4 μm Rad51, 1.2 μm Rad52, 30 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.1), 12 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2.0 mm ATP. The concentration of KCl in the reaction, which was derived from both the Rad51 and Rad52 preparations, was maintained between 4.5 and 12.5 mm, a range within which the efficiency of D-loop formation is not affected. Before their addition to the reaction mixture, the purified Rad51 and Rad52 were mixed without ATP and magnesium and preincubated for at least 30 min on ice to allow complex formation, as described by Song and Sung (29Song B. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15895-15904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The mixture of Rad51 and Rad52 is referred to as Rad51-Rad52. The reaction mixture (18 μl), without Rad51-Rad52 and form I DNA, was preincubated for 2–3 min at 37 °C, and then 1 μl of 8.0 μm Rad51–24.0 μm Rad52 was added to it. After an incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, 1 μl of 1,200 μm pNS11 form I DNA was added, and the mixture was further incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. To stop the reaction, 1.7 μlof500 mm EDTA and 1.3 μl of 10% SDS were added, and the mixtures were then transferred to ice. For deproteinization of the DNA, a 2-μl aliquot of 1.3 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma) was added, and the reaction was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. After the addition of 2 μl of BPB-dye (0.1% bromphenol blue-50% (v/v) glycerol), the products were separated by electrophoresis (4 V/cm, 1.5 h) on a 1.0% agarose gel with TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA). The gel was dried on Gel Bond film (BMA Inc.) by heating at 50 °C under an air stream and was exposed to a Phosphor Screen (Amersham Biosciences) for 12–16 h. The distribution of radioactivity was analyzed with a Variable Image Analyzer Typhoon 8600. The amounts of D-loops formed were determined by the uptake of the radioactivity derived from the [32P]pNS11 single-stranded DNA fragments, at a position between pNS11 form I DNA and form II DNA. D-loop Assay with Linear Double-stranded DNA—The reaction mixture was the same as that for the standard D-loop assay, except that 0.4 μm [32P]pUC119 single-stranded DNA fragments and 20 μm pNS11 linear double-stranded DNA were used, instead of 0.4 μm [32P]pNS11 single-stranded DNA fragments and 60 μm pNS11 form I DNA, respectively. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μl of cold 3 m NaCl, 2.5 μl of cold stop solution (5% Sarkosyl, 250 mm EDTA), and 3 μl of cold phenol/Tris (phenol (pH 7.0) saturated with Trizma base), and the mixture was kept on ice for at least 10 min. After the addition of 2 μlof cold BPB-dye, the products were separated by electrophoresis (2–3 V/cm, 5 h) on a 1.0% agarose gel in TAE buffer containing 150 mm sodium acetate. Gel electrophoresis was performed below 10 °C. Detection of radioactivity was performed as described for the standard D-loop assay. Dissociation of D-loops between Form I DNA and Single-stranded DNA Fragments—After the reactions for the standard D-loop assay, except that with 20 μm form I DNA, which was conducted in twice the volume (40 μl), the reaction mixture was divided into 3"
