https://openalex.org/W2107411016,"The mechanism of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced nonapoptotic cell death is largely unknown, although the mechanism of TNF-induced apoptosis has been studied extensively. In wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblast cells under a caspase-inhibited condition, TNF effectively induced cell death that morphologically resembled necrosis. In this study, we utilized gene knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts cells and found that tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) I mediates TNF-induced necrotic cell death, and that RIP, FADD, and TRAF2 are critical components of the signaling cascade of this TNF-induced necrotic cell death. Inhibitors of NF-κB facilitated TNF-induced necrotic cell death, suggesting that NF-κB suppresses the necrotic cell death pathway. JNK, p38, and ERK activation seem not to be required for this type of cell death because mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors did not significantly affect TNF-induced necrotic cell death. In agreement with the previous reports that the reactive oxygen species (ROS) may play an important role in this type of cell death, the ROS scavenger butylated hydroxyanisole efficiently blocked TNF-induced necrotic cell death. Interestingly, during TNF-induced necrotic cell death, the cellular ROS level was significantly elevated in wild type, but not in RIP-/-, TRAF2-/-, and FADD-/- cells. These results suggest that RIP, TRAF2, and FADD are crucial in mediating ROS accumulation in TNF-induced necrotic cell death.

TNF elicits its biological effects in responding cells by binding to the receptors, TNFRI and TNFRII. Both TNF receptors belong to the TNF/nerve growth factor receptor superfamily, which is characterized by multiple cysteine-rich domains in their extracellular regions (1Aggarwal B.B. Nat. Rev.

Although many of the TNF-mediated processes can be regulated by either one of its receptors, TNFRI and TNFRII, apoptosis is mainly induced through TNFRI (1Aggarwal B.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar, 2MacEwan D.J. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 3Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J.

Tremendous progress has been made recently in our understanding of the mechanisms of the distinct pathways of TNF receptor signaling. The binding of TNF to TNFRI leads to the trimerization of TNFRI followed by recruitment of TNFRI-associated death domain protein (TRADD) (2MacEwan D.J. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 3Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J.

Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). TRADD serves as a platform to recruit other adapter proteins, FAS-associated death domain protein (FADD), TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), and receptor-interacting protein (RIP, the death domain kinase) to build a receptor complex, which may be modified and released from the membrane to form different sub-complexes during the signaling process (1Aggarwal B.B.

Several distinct TNFRI signaling pathways have been identified, namely, NF-κB, JNK, p38, and ERK activation and cell death, which are elaborately regulated and mutually interfering (2MacEwan D.J. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 6Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar). RIP and TRAF2 are two key factors in TNF-induced NF-κB activation (7Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P.

Upon TNF ligation, TNFRI receptor complex is formed, and the IKK complex is then recruited through TRAF2 and activated (10Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z.G. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of Iκβ kinase activation is not fully understood, studies have shown that it is mediated by RIP and may involve MEK kinase (MEKK)3 (10Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z.G. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 11Yang J. Lin Y. Guo Z. Huang H. Liao W. Liu Z.-G. Su B. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Activated Iκβ kinase then phosphorylates IκBs, the inhibitory proteins of NF-κB that mask NF-κB nuclear translocation signal to sequester NF-κB in the cytoplasm (6Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar, 12Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3326) Google Scholar). Subsequently, IκBs are rapidly polyubiquitinated and degraded, and the released NF-κB is translocated into the nucleus to activate its target genes (6Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar, 12Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3326) Google Scholar). It has been shown that several target genes of NF-κB, such as cIAP-1, cIAP-2, and IEX-1L, have anti-apoptotic properties (13Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

RIP and TRAF2 are also crucial in JNK, p38, and ERK activation (15Devin A. Lin Y. Liu Z.G. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 16Lee T.H. Huang Q. Oikemus S.

The cascade of these MAP kinase activation pathways is not well understood in detail, although MEKK1 and ASK1 are suggested to play a role (17Xia Y. Makris C. Su B. Li E. Yang J. Nemerow G.R.

The role of JNK in TNF-induced cell death is still controversial: it may be pro- or anti-apoptotic, necrotic, or irrelevant (19Sakon S. Xue X. Takekawa M. Sasazuki T. Okazaki T. Kojima Y. Piao J.H.

Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). TNF induces both apoptotic and necrotic cell death, depending upon cell types and treatment condition (24Fiers W. Beyaert R. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7719-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 25Denecker G. Vercammen D. Steemans M. Van den Berghe T. Brouckaert G. Van Loo G. Zhivotovsky B. Fiers W. Grooten J. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 829-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). FADD is essential for TNF-induced apoptosis as it recruits caspase-8 (26Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2111) Google Scholar, 27Varfolomeev E.E. Schuchmann M. Luria V Chiannilkulchai N.

Immunity. 1998; 9: 267-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). Caspase-8 is then activated, thereby initiating a caspase cascade, which results in apoptosis (28Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar, 29Faleiro L. Kobayashi R. Fearnhead H. Lazebnik Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2271-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). BID, a member of the Bcl2 family and a target of caspase-8, may play a critical role in caspase-8 activation and amplification of apoptosis signals through the mitochondria (20Deng Y. Ren X. Yang L.

Despite the rapid progress in elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of TNF signaling to apoptosis, the signaling pathway to necrotic cell death in response to TNF is not well studied. RIP was found to be essential for Fas, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and TNF-induced necrosis in lymphocytes (32Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). ROS was found to be required for necrotic cell death in L929 cells, a unique murine fibroblast cell line that is defective in TNF-induced apoptosis (33Garg A.K. Aggarwal B.B. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 39: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 34Goossens V. Grooten J. De Vos K. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Med. 1998; 187: 1477-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar), as well as in NF-κB subunit p65- or TRAF2/TRAF5-null mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells (19Sakon S. Xue X. Takekawa M. Sasazuki T. Okazaki T. Kojima Y. Piao J.H. Yagita H. Okumura K. Doi T. Nakano H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3898-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and depletion of cellular ATP is also suggested to be involved in TNF-induced necrosis (36Los M. Mozoluk M. Ferrari D. Stepczynska A. Stroh C. Renz A. Herceg Z. Wang Z.Q. Schulze-Osthoff K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 978-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). However, the roles of each component of the TNFRI signaling complex in TNF-induced necrotic cell death have not been well addressed. Moreover, the signaling mechanism that leads to TNF-induced necrotic cell death has remained elusive. In this study, by utilizing gene knockout cells, we systematically delineated the necrotic signaling pathway induced by TNF. Here we established that the RIP-, TRAF2-, and FADD-mediated ROS accumulation plays a pivotal role in TNF-induced necrotic cell death. Reagents and Plasmids—Anti-RIP and JNK1 antibodies were purchased from PharMingen. Anti-FLAG (M2) and actin antibodies were obtained from Sigma. Anti-TRAF2 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-FADD was a gift from Dr. Jianke Zhang. The mammalian expression plasmids for TRAF2, RIP, and FADD have been described previously (23Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar, 37Lin Y. Devin A. Cook A. Keane M.M. Kelliher M. Lipkowitz S. Liu Z.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6638-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Z-VAD-fmk, BAY-11, MG132, p38 inhibitor SB203580, JNK inhibitor SP600125, and MEK inhibitor U0126 were purchased from Calbiochem. 5(6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescence diacetate (CM-H2 DCFDA) was obtained from Molecular Probes. Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) was obtained from Sigma. Cell Culture and Transfection—RIP-/- and TRAF2-/- MEF cells were described previously. TNFRI-/- and TNFRII-/- MEF cells were generated from TNFRI and TNFRII knockout mice, respectively. FADD-/- and FADD reconstituted FADD-/- MEF cells were provided by Dr. Jianke Zhang (38Kuang A.A. Diehl G.E. Zhang J. Winoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25065-25068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as described previously (37Lin Y. Devin A. Cook A. Keane M.M. Kelliher M. Lipkowitz S. Liu Z.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6638-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 39Lin Y. Ryan J. Lewis J. Wani M.A. Lingrel J.B. Liu Z.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5849-5856Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Stable transfected RIP and TRAF2 cell lines were selected with hygromycin from the TRAF2-/- cells transfected with each gene of interest and pHygromycin. Western Blot Analysis—After treatment with different reagents as described in the figure legends, cells were collected and lysed in M2 buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Fifty micrograms of the cell lysate from each sample was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted. The proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL), according to the manufacturer’s (Amersham Biosciences) instruction (39Lin Y. Ryan J. Lewis J. Wani M.A. Lingrel J.B. Liu Z.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5849-5856Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cell Death Assays—Cells cultured in 12-well plates were treated as described in the figure legends. Cell death was observed under the microscope and characterized by cell rounding up and detaching from the plates. For quantification of cell death, a cytotoxicity detection kit was used to measure the percentage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche Applied Science). Each experiment was repeated at least three times with duplicate samples. The figures shown are averages of the results of three experiments. For morphological study of cell death, cells were cultured on cover slides and treated with TNF, cycloheximide, and Z-VAD-fmk for 5 h. The cells were stained with 50 μg/ml of ethidium bromide and 50 μg/ml of acridine orange and immediately observed and photographed under a fluorescence microscope. Detection of ROS Accumulation—Cells in 12-well plates were cultured in phenol red-free medium and treated with TNF, cycloheximide, and Z-VAD-fmk for the indicated time periods. CM-H2-DCFDA (1 μm/ml) was added 30 min before collecting cells. The stained cells were analyzed with a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) and data were processed with the CellQuest program (BD Biosciences). TNF Induces Necrotic Cell Death in MEF Cells When Caspases Are Blocked—To study the mechanism of TNF-induced nonapoptotic cell death, we decided to use MEF cells as a model because this enabled us to utilize the gene-knockout fibroblast cells that are null for several components of the TNF receptor signaling cascade. First, we tested whether TNF induces nonapoptotic cell death in this type of cell. We pretreated wild-type mouse fibroblast cells with Z-VAD-fmk, a membrane-permeable pan-caspase inhibitor, followed by treatment with TNF and cycloheximide (CHX). As a control, cells without pre-treatment were treated with TNF/CHX to induce apoptosis. Although the caspases were blocked after Z-VAD-fmk pre-treatment (data not shown), cells were still sensitive to TNF-induced cell death, which was even more extensive at early time points when compared with that without Z-VAD-fmk pretreatment (Fig. 1A). However, Z-VAD-fmk pretreatment efficiently blocked TNF-induced apoptotic cell death in HeLa cells, which not only indicated the effectiveness of Z-VAD-fmk used in our study, but also suggested that the caspase-independent cell death is cell type-specific (Fig. 1B). The cell death induced by TNF under the caspase-blocked condition is morphologically distinct from the typical apoptosis because it did not exhibit the classic apoptosis features such as cell membrane blebbing, shrinkage of cytoplasm and nucleus, and chromatin condensation (Fig. 1C). Instead, the dead cells maintained morphologically normal nuclei and showed disrupted cytoplasmic membrane and loose cytoplasm, which resembles the morphology of necrosis. These results suggest that, under caspase-inhibited conditions, TNF induces necrotic cell death in MEF cells. TNF Induced Necrotic Cell Death Mainly through TNFRI— To see which of the TNF receptors transduces the necrotic cell death signal, we treated the TNFRI- or TNFRII-knockout MEF cells and compared them with wild-type cells. As expected, TNF-induced apoptosis occurred through TNFRI, the same as when treated with TNF plus CHX; cell death is defective in TNFRI-/- cells, whereas in TNFRII-/- cells, it was similar to that in wild-type cells (Fig. 2). When pre-treated with Z-VAD-fmk to induce necrotic cell death, TNFRII-/- cells died and showed necrotic morphology (data not shown). However, the extent of cell death was reduced compared with wild-type cells, suggesting that, although TNFRII is not essential for TNF-induced necrotic cell death, it contributes to this process. This result is consistent with a recent report (40Chan F.K. Shisler J. Bixby J.G. Felices M. Zheng L. Appel M. Orenstein J. Moss B. Lenardo M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51613-51621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In contrast, necrotic cell death was not observed in TNFRI-/- cells (Fig. 2), suggesting that TNF-induced necrotic cell death signal is mediated mainly through TNFRI. TNF-induced Necrotic Cell Death Requires RIP, TRAF2, and FADD—As TNF-induced necrotic cell death is mainly mediated by TNFRI, we decided to investigate which component of the TNFRI signaling complex is required for this cell death process. Therefore, we utilized gene knockout cells that have RIP, TRAF2, or FADD deletions. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, whereas TNF-induced apoptosis in RIP-/- and TRAF2-/- cells is comparable with wild-type cells, TNF-induced necrotic cell death was defective in RIP-/- cells and markedly decreased in TRAF2 -/- cells, suggesting that RIP and TRAF2 are required for TNF-induced necrotic cell death. To rule out the possibility that flaws other than the deletion of their respective genes in the knockout cells may affect the process of necrosis, we reconstituted RIP or TRAF2 expression in RIP-/- or TRAF2-/- cells (Fig. 3C) and tested the sensitivity to TNF-induced necrotic cell death in the resulting cells. The reconstitution of RIP or TRAF2 expression efficiently restored TNF-induced necrotic cell death in RIP-/- or TRAF2-/- cells. These results suggested a crucial role of RIP in TNF-induced necrosis, which is consistent with a previous study (32Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Additionally, our results suggest that TRAF2 also plays an important role in TNF-induced necrotic cell death. FADD is a critical component of the TNF-induced apoptosis pathway (26Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2111) Google Scholar, 27Varfolomeev E.E. Schuchmann M. Luria V Chiannilkulchai N. Beckmann J.S. Mett I.L. Rebrikov D. Brodianski V.M. Kemper O.C. Kollet O. Lapidot T. Soffer D. Sobe T. Avraham K.B. Goncharov T. Holtmann H. Lonai P. Wallach D. Immunity. 1998; 9: 267-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). To see whether TNF-induced necrotic cell death requires FADD, we compared FADD-/- MEF cells with wild-type MEF cells. As expected, TNF-induced apoptosis is defective in FADD-/- cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Surprisingly, TNF-induced necrotic cell death is also defective in this type of cell, indicating that TNF-mediated necrotic cell death also requires FADD. To confirm this result, FADD-/- cells with FADD expression reconstituted (Fig. 3C) were treated with apoptotic (TNF/CHX) and necrotic (TNF/CHX/Z-VAD-fmk) conditions. The reconstitution of FADD expression not only efficiently restored TNF-induced apoptosis (data not shown), but also partially restored TNF-induced necrotic cell death (Fig. 3D), suggesting that despite a crucial role for FADD in apoptosis, FADD also plays a positive role in TNF-induced necrotic cell death. NF-κB Activation Blocks TNF-induced Necrotic Cell Death— Because TNF-induced NF-κB activation is anti-apoptotic and necrotic cell death occurs when apoptosis is abrogated in MEF cells, we sought to investigate whether activation of NF-κB is required for TNF-induced necrotic cell death. NF-κB is a transcription factor that exerts its function through augmenting the expression of its target genes. The high concentration of cycloheximide (10 μg/ml), which was included to induce necrotic cell death, might block de novo protein synthesis and, therefore, it is unlikely that NF-κB is required for necrotic cell death. To test this possibility, we chose the NF-κB inhibitor, IκBα, as a read-out marker, because the IκBα gene is one of the NF-κB-activated targets. Normally, when cells are exposed to TNF, IκBα is first degraded and then recovers rapidly (6Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar, 12Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3326) Google Scholar, Fig. 4A, lanes 5–7). However, under the necrotic cell death condition that included CHX, no recovery of IκBα was observed (Fig. 4A, lane 3). These results confirmed that, under our necrotic cell death conditions, NF-κB-activated gene expression was blocked; however, necrotic cell death was still observed (Fig. 4C). Because no correlation between NF-κB-activated gene expression and necrotic cell death was observed, it is unlikely that NF-κB is required for TNF-induced necrotic cell death. Next, we tested whether NF-κB had a negative role in TNF-induced necrotic cell death in MEF cells. Cells were pretreated with NF-κB inhibitor BAY-11 or proteasome inhibitor MG132, followed by TNF plus Z-VAD-fmk treatment. BAY-11 inhibits NF-κB activation through the blockage of IκB phosphorylation, whereas MG132 inhibits NF-κB activation through the blockage of IκB degradation (41Goossens V. Grooten J. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 192-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4B, both Bay-11 and MG132 blocked NF-κB activation efficiently, as measured by IκBα degradation. Although there was no cell death observed when cells were treated with TNF/Z-VAD-fmk, a significant portion of cells died when pretreated (in addition to TNF/Z-VAD-fmk treatment) with Bay-11 or MG132 to block NF-κB (Fig. 4C). This result suggests that NF-κB negatively regulates TNF-induced necrotic cell death in MEF cells. Because CHX is required to achieve the full necrotic effect and Bay-11 or MG132 only partially facilitated TNF-induced necrotic cell death, there might be other factors in addition to NF-κB that negatively regulate the TNF-induced necrotic cell death pathway. TNF-induced Necrotic Cell Death Does Not Require JNK, p38, and ERK Activation—To see whether the activation of MAP kinases is required for TNF-induced necrotic cell death, we pretreated the wild-type MEF cells with JNK inhibitor SP600125, p38 inhibitor SB203580, or MEK inhibitor U0126 before induction of TNF-induced necrotic cell death. U0126 blocks ERK activation through blockade of MEK, the upstream kinase of ERK. Although the inhibitors efficiently inhibited their respective MAP kinases (data not shown), there was only a marginal effect by each inhibitor on TNF-induced necrotic cell death (Fig. 5). These results suggest that neither JNK, p38, nor ERK is required for TNF-induced necrotic cell death. Important Role of ROS in TNF-induced Necrotic Cell Death—It has been reported previously that TNF induces the accumulation of cellular ROS, and that ROS is required for necrotic cell death in L929 cells as well as in NF-κB subunit p65- or TRAF2/TRAF5-null MEF cells (19Sakon S. Xue X. Takekawa M. Sasazuki T. Okazaki T. Kojima Y. Piao J.H. Yagita H. Okumura K. Doi T. Nakano H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3898-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 33Garg A.K. Aggarwal B.B. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 39: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 34Goossens V. Grooten J. De Vos K. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8115-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 35Vercammen D. Beyaert R. Denecker G. Goossens V. Van Loo G. Declercq W. Grooten J. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1477-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 42Izban K.F. Ergin M. Qin J.Z. Martinez R.L. Pooley Jr., R.J. Saeed S. Alkan S. Hum. Pathol. 2000; 31: 1482-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To see whether ROS in MEF cells is increased under our necrotic cell death conditions, we stained the cells with CM-H2 DCFDA, a cell-permeable fluorescence dye that reacts to a broad spectrum of ROS at different time points after the induction of TNF-induced necrotic cell death. As shown in Fig. 6A, elevated ROS levels were detectable 4 h after TNF/CHX/Z-VAD-fmk treatment and gradually increased. The starting time point of ROS increase (4 h) correlated well with the onset of cell death (Fig. 1A). Then, we tested whether ROS accumulation is required for TNF-induced necrotic cell death by pretreatment of the cells with a ROS scavenger BHA. BHA dramatically inhibited ROS accumulation (Fig. 6B) and efficiently suppressed TNF-induced necrotic cell death (Fig. 6C), suggesting that, as in L929 cells, ROS plays an important role in TNF-induced necrotic cell death in MEF cells. ROS Accumulation Is Dependent upon RIP, TRAF2, and FADD—Next we examined whether ROS accumulation under our necrotic cell death conditions requires the presence of RIP, TRAF2, and FADD. As again, in wild-type MEF cells, ROS was significantly increased 8 h after challenging the cells with TNF/CHX/Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 7A). In contrast, there was no detectable ROS increase in RIP-/- and FADD-/- cells. In TRAF2-/- cells, the ROS level was only slightly elevated. These results suggest that RIP, FADD, and TRAF2 are components critical to transducing the signal to induce ROS accumulation in MEF cells. In this report, we have systematically delineated the TNF-induced necrotic cell death pathway with gene knockout MEF cells. The results suggest that TNFRI mediates, and TNFRII may facilitate, necrotic cell death. The components of the TNFRI signaling complex, RIP, TRAF2, and FADD, were required for TNF-induced necrotic cell death. Although NF-κB suppressed TNF-induced necrotic cell death, MAP kinases, JNK, p38, and ERK, seemed to be dispensable. Interestingly, RIP-, TRAF2-, and FADD-mediated ROS accumulation was found to be crucial in TNF-induced necrotic cell death. Although TNF-induced necrotic cell death had been observed as early as 1993 (43Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 317-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar), the study of its mechanism was retarded because most of the attention and effort was focused on the mechanism of TNF-induced apoptosis. Most studies on TNF-induced necrotic cell death either used L929, a unique mouse fibroblast cell line that is defective in TNF-induced apoptosis (34Goossens V. Grooten J. De Vos K. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8115-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 35Vercammen D. Beyaert R. Denecker G. Goossens V. Van Loo G. Declercq W. Grooten J. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1477-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar), or lymphocytes (32Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Thus the generality of these findings should be further addressed. Additionally, the signaling cascade of the TNF-induced necrotic cell death pathway has not been clearly characterized. In this study, we found that TNFRI is essential, and TNFRII as well has some positive role in TNF-induced necrotic cell death. This result is in agreement with a recent report showing that TNFRII facilitates TNFRI-mediated programmed necrosis in Jurkat cells (40Chan F.K. Shisler J. Bixby J.G. Felices M. Zheng L. Appel M. Orenstein J. Moss B. Lenardo M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51613-51621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). However, the question of how TNFRII facilitates TNFRI-mediated necrotic signaling remains to be addressed. Further, as RIP and TRAF2 are critical for TNF-induced necrotic cell death but dispensable for TNF-induced apoptosis, it seems that the distinct death signals may bifurcate at the level of RIP and TRAF2 (Fig. 7B). RIP is essential for TNF-induced NF-κB activation but dispensable for apoptosis (7Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 8Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Cleavage of RIP by caspase 8 triggers the apoptosis process (44Lin Y. Devin A. Rodriguez Y. Liu Z.G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2514-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). In Jurkat cells, RIP kinase activity was found to be required for TNF-, Fas-, and TRAIL-induced necrosis (32Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). In this study, we confirmed that RIP is essential for TNF-induced necrotic cell death in MEF cells. However, we did not observe the requirement of RIP kinase activity for TNF-induced necrotic cell death by transient transfection of RIP-/- MEF cells with RIP(K45A), a kinase-deficient RIP mutant (data not shown). As our effort to establish stable lines with high level expression of RIP kinase dead mutant (RIP(K45A)) in RIP-/- cells has not been successful so far, the requirement of RIP kinase activity for TNF-induced necrotic cell death in MEF cells remains to be elucidated. Because TRAF2 and FADD have also been found to be necessary for TNF-induced necrotic cell death in MEF cells, it is likely that the formation of the TNFRI signaling complex, consisting of RIP, TRAF2, and FADD, is essential for the generation of a necrotic signal when caspases are blocked. It is highly possible that TRADD, the first adaptor protein to be recruited to TNFRI, and which serves as a platform for RIP, TRAF2, and FADD interacting, is also required. Because TRADD gene knockout cells are currently not available, whether TRADD is involved in TNF-induced necrotic cell death remains for future study. It has been reported that, in Jurkat cells, TNF-induced necrosis does not require FADD (32Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). However, TRAIL-induced necrosis does require FADD (32Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). In our study, FADD was clearly shown to be required. The reason for this discrepancy is currently unclear. It is possible that the requirement of FADD is not only death receptor-specific but also cell type-specific (24Fiers W. Beyaert R. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7719-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 25Denecker G. Vercammen D. Steemans M. Van den Berghe T. Brouckaert G. Van Loo G. Zhivotovsky B. Fiers W. Grooten J. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 829-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 45Barnhart B.C. Alappat E.C. Peter M.E. Semin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that, during TNF-induced necrotic cell death in MEF cells, ROS is accumulated. Blockage of ROS also inhibited cell death, suggesting a crucial role of ROS in this type of cell death. Consistently, the antioxidant enzyme manganese-containing superoxide dismutase has been shown to block the cytotoxicity of TNF in MCF7 cells (46Li J.J. Oberley L.W. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1991-1998PubMed Google Scholar). ROS accumulation is impaired in RIP-/-, TRAF2-/-, and FADD-/- cells, suggesting that these molecules are essential for transducing the signal to induce ROS, and ROS is downstream of RIP, TRAF2, and FADD for TNF-induced necrotic cell death in MEF cells. Consistent with this conclusion, it has been reported that TRAF2 mediates ROS production in HEK293 cells (47Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. Arch R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42728-42736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, because the known pathways, namely NF-κB and MAP kinase activation, are not required for TNF-induced necrotic cell death and ROS accumulation in MEF cells (data not shown), how the signal is transduced to ROS metabolic machinery is an open question. Additionally, how ROS accumulation mediated the execution of necrotic cell death is also currently unknown. It is unlikely that ROS mediates PARP activation to execute necrotic cell death, as there was no correlation between ROS accumulation, PARP activation, and ATP decrease observed in MEF cells (data not shown). Among the ROS scavengers, BHA efficiently inhibited, whereas others, such as TEMPL and NAC, only slightly or marginally inhibited TNFinduced necrotic cell death (data not shown). It is possible that the newly generated ROS in the mitochondria mediated a death signal in situ. This explanation is supported by the facts that BHA is the only ROS scavenger that can enter mitochondria (35Vercammen D. Beyaert R. Denecker G. Goossens V. Van Loo G. Declercq W. Grooten J. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1477-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). A recent report using p65 knockout and TRAF2/TRAF5 double knockout cells showed that TNF alone induced necrosis through ROS-mediated JNK activation, which was not observed in wild-type cells (19Sakon S. Xue X. Takekawa M. Sasazuki T. Okazaki T. Kojima Y. Piao J.H. Yagita H. Okumura K. Doi T. Nakano H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3898-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). This finding was thought to be the result of the impaired NF-κB activation, in agreement with our finding that NF-κB suppresses TNF-induced necrotic cell death (this study). However, we found no requirement for JNK in necrosis in wild-type MEF cells. This might be due to the difference in cell lines (33Garg A.K. Aggarwal B.B. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 39: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 47Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. Arch R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42728-42736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the presence of CHX in our system may cause the bypass of JNK by blocking the anti-necrotic signals and/or facilitating the necrotic signals. Taken together, our results revealed a critical role for RIP, TRAF2, and FADD in mediating ROS generation in TNF-induced necrotic cell death. Further study elucidating the mechanism of the signal from the TNF receptor complex to the generation of ROS and that of ROS in necrotic cell death will facilitate our understanding of cell death control and improve the value in the clinical application of TNF.

To determine the ability of different subunits to assemble into heteromeric channels, a number of ASIC1a-, ASIC1b-, ASIC2a-, ASIC2b-, and ASIC3-containing homo- and heteromeric channels were studied by whole-cell patch clamp recordings with respect to pH sensitivity, desensitization kinetics, and level of sustained current normalized to peak current. Analyzing and comparing data for these three features demonstrated unique heteromeric channels in a number of co-expression experiments. Formation of heteromeric ASIC1a+2a and ASIC1b+2a channels was foremost supported by the desensitization characteristics that were independent of proton concentration, a feature none of the respective homomeric channels has. Several lines of evidence supported formation of ASIC1a+3, ASIC1b+3, and ASIC2a+3 heteromeric channels. The most compelling was the desensitization characteristics, which, besides being proton-independent, were faster than those of any of the respective homomeric channels. ASIC2b, which homomerically expressed is not activated by protons per se, did not appear to form unique heteromeric combinations with other subunits and in fact appeared to suppress the function of ASIC1b. Co-expression of three subunits such as ASIC1a+2a+3 and ASIC1b+2a+3 resulted in data that could best be explained by coexistence of multiple channel populations within the same cell. This observation seems to be in good agreement with the fact that ASIC-expressing sensory neurons display a variety of acid-evoked currents.

This observation seems to be in good agreement with the fact that ASIC-expressing sensory neurons display a variety of acid-evoked currents. It is well established that tissue acidification, which may be present in inflammatory and ischemic conditions, causes pain (1Steen K.H. Reeh P.W. Neurosci.

In line with this, peripheral sensory neurons exhibit sensitivity toward acid by activating several types of depolarizing currents (4Bevan S. Yeats J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 433: 145-161Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 5Krishtal O.A. Pidoplichko V.I. Neuroscience. 1981; 6: 2599-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 6Petruska J.C.

Although the repertoire of ion channels responsible for these currents is not fully known, the family of acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) 1The abbreviations used are: ASIC, acid-sensing ion channel; ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel; DEG, degenerin; FaNaC, Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-amide-activated Na+ channel; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DRG, dorsal root ganglion; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. is believed to be an important constituent. The ASIC family is a member of the ENaC/DEG superfamily, which also includes the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs), the mechanically gated degenerins of Caenorhabditis elegans (DEGs), and a neuropeptide-gated channel of Helix aspersa (FaNaC). The membrane topology of all channels within this superfamily comprises two transmembrane domains, intracellular N and C termini and a large extracellular loop with a number of conserved cysteine residues (7Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Currently, four genes encoding six ASIC transcripts have been cloned and characterized from mammalian organisms. ASIC1a (BNaC2) and ASIC1b (ASIC1β) are the products of alternatively spliced transcripts of the ASIC1 gene that differ in the N-terminal region, including the first transmembrane domain and the proximal part of the large extracellular domain (8Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 9Chen C.C. England S. Akopian A.N. Wood J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These, too, have unique N termini and share the C-terminal amino acids (11Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Sakai H. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol.

Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Except for ASIC2b and ASIC4, all subunits have the ability to form functional homomeric channels when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes or mammalian cells. The functional and pharmacological properties of homomeric ASIC1a match one type of acid-evoked current described in peripheral sensory neurons (16Escoubas P. de Weille J.R. Lecoq A. Diochot S.

Lazdunski M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8026-8033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the properties of ASIC3-mediated currents mimic acid-evoked currents in cardiac sensory neurons, believed to mediate the pain of angina (18Sutherland S.P. Benson C.J. Adelman J.P. McCleskey E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Different ASIC subunits often co-localize within the same neurons (19Alvarez de la Rosa D. Zhang P. Shao D. White F. Canessa C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2326-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and heteromeric channels are likely to exist, as is the case for most ligand-gated ion channels. However, the exact composition of endogenous acid-sensitive channels is at present largely unknown. To study heteromerization of ASICs, we examined co-expressions of different ASIC subunits in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. By analyzing currents obtained in whole-cell voltage clamp experiments using ultrafast solution exchange for providing acidification, data for all possible combinations of ASICs (except ASIC4) were obtained. These data reveal unique properties for several of the homomerically expressed ASIC subunits and clearly demonstrate the formation of heteromeric channels in a number of co-expression experiments. Interestingly, not all the tested co-expressions led to channels that could be identified as unique; in the case of experiments involving co-expression of three different subunits, the data suggested existence of multiple channel populations. To summarize, this is the first comprehensive study of ASICs co-expressed in a mammalian expression system. Cloning of ASICs—Poly(A)+ mRNA was purified from fetal rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons using the Oligotex® direct mRNA mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. ASIC1b, ASIC2b, and ASIC4 were cloned from fetal rat DRG poly(A)+ mRNA, whereas ASIC1a, ASIC2a, and ASIC3 were cloned from rat total brain poly(A)+ mRNA (Clontech) using reverse transcription PCR. First and second strand cDNA was obtained in a one-tube reverse transcriptase-PCR reaction using Avian myoblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, DYNazyme™ DNA polymerase (Finnzymes), and the following primer sets (MWG Biotech): ASIC1a –53s TGTGCCTGTGCCTGTTTGAGAG and ASIC1a 1678as ATGCAGTTAAGTCCACAGGGTAGC; ASIC1b –50s ATGCAGTTAAGTCCACAGGGTAGC and ASIC1b 960as CAGGGTGAGGGCAGGTAGATGA; ASIC2a –110s CACCGGCAGCAGCAGGAC and ASIC2a 1614as CTGCGCTTGCTGTCTCCTGTC; ASIC2b –14s CAGGGTGAGGGCAGGTAGATGA and ASIC2b 1787as CCCCCTTGACCGTGGTGA; ASIC3 –6s GCCGCCATGAAACCTCGCTCCGGACTGGAGGAGGCCC and ASIC3 744as GGGCTCATCCTGGCTGTGAAT; and ASIC3 515s GTGGGCCTGAGAACTTCACAGTG and ASIC3 1602as CTAGAGCCTTGTGACGAGGTAACAGGT.

The cDNAs were cloned into pSwas, which is a custom-designed vector derived from pZero™ (Invitrogen), and positive clones were sequenced bidirectionally. ASIC1a, ASIC2a, ASIC2b, and ASIC4 were subcloned directly into the pNS1z vector. The ASIC1b fragment, which encoded the N-terminal part of the channel, was subcloned into pNS1z-ASIC1a, substituting the corresponding part of ASIC1a. ASIC3 was cloned in two overlapping fragments and subcloned in pNS1z in a unique restriction site of ASIC3 (BsrGI) within the overlapping region. The pNS1z vector is a customized vector derived from pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) with expression of the insert under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Expression of ASICs—All constructs were expressed in CHO-K1 cells (ATCC No. CCL61). CHO-K1 cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air and passaged twice/week. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (10 mm HEPES, 2 mm GlutaMAX) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-proline (Invitrogen). CHO-K1 cells were co-transfected with the plasmids containing ASICs and a plasmid encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein using the LipofectAMINE PLUS kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. When more than one ASIC subunit was expressed, this was done in a 1:1 ratio. For each transfection we attempted to use an amount of DNA that would yield whole-cell currents within a reasonable range (0.5–10 nA) to avoid saturation of the patch clamp amplifier: ASIC1a and ASIC1b, 800 ng; ASIC2a and ASIC3, 400 ng; ASIC1a+1b, 2 × 250 ng; ASIC1a+2a, 2 × 100 ng; ASIC1a+2b and ASIC1b+2b, 2 × 400 ng; ASIC1a+3 and ASIC2a+3, 2 × 25 ng; ASIC1b+3, 2 × 75 ng; ASIC1b+2a and ASIC2a+2b, 2 × 200 ng; and ASIC1a+2a+3, ASIC1a+2b+3, and ASIC1b+2a+3, 3 × 75 ng. Electrophysiological measurements were performed 16–48 h after transfection. Electrophysiology—All experiments were performed under voltage clamp using conventional whole-cell patch clamp methods (20Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15145) Google Scholar) at 20–22 °C. A Macintosh G4 computer was used to control an EPC-9 amplifier (HEKA-electronics) via an ITC-16 interface. The experimental conditions were defined by the Pulse software accompanying the amplifier, and data were sampled at 2 kHz and low pass-filtered at 667 Hz. Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (Modulohm) using a horizontal electrode puller (Zeitz-Instrumente). The pipette was filled with an intracellular solution containing 120 mm KCl, 31 mm KOH, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.2. The pipette electrode was a chloridized silver wire, and the reference electrode was a silver chloride pellet electrode (In Vivo Metric) fixed to the experimental chamber. The electrodes were zeroed with the open pipette in the bath just prior to sealing, and the pipette resistances were 1.5–3.0 megohms. Series resistance compensation was set at 80%. Coverslips with cells were transferred to the recording chamber (RC-25F, Warner Instruments) mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Olympus). Transfected cells were identified by the emission of green fluorescence when exposed to UV light. After giga-seal formation, the whole-cell configuration was attained by suction. Cells were continuously superfused at a rate of 2.5 ml/min with an extracellular solution (Na-R) containing 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, and 5 mm MES adjusted to pH 7.4. Test solutions were made from standard Na-R, adjusting pH with HCl. Rapid pH changes were achieved by placing a piezo-driven double-barreled application pipette (theta tube) in front of the cell. Using this system, complete solution exchange can be achieved in <1 ms, as measured by the liquid junction potential shift (data not shown). Currents were measured at the peak of the response and normalized to the current evoked by a pH 4 stimulus. Data Analysis—Using the software GraphPad Prism® 3.0, pH dose-response curves were fitted to the equation I/Imax = 1/(1+(EC50/[H+])n), where EC50 denotes the proton concentration [H+] yielding 50% activation and n is the Hill coefficient. In a few instances, the current was not fully saturated at pH 4 when fitting to this equation. In these cases, the current amplitudes were subsequently normalized to the value of I/Imax at saturation as estimated from the fit to obtain a maximal I/Imax of 1.0. Time constants of desensitization were calculated using IgorPro software (WaveMetrics) by fitting the falling phase of the evoked current to a single exponential function I(t) = K0 + K1exp(–K2t), where the time constant of desensitization, τdesens, equals 1/K2, K0 denotes the amplitude of the non-desensitizing current, and K0 + K1 is the peak current; i.e. all ASIC subunit combinations yielded currents that desensitized incompletely at pH 4.0. Results are presented as mean ± S.E., and comparisons were made using a two-tailed t test or one-way analysis of variance. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to be significant. ASIC subunits were transiently expressed, either singly or as combinations, in CHO cells. All functional channels yielded transient acid-evoked whole-cell currents that displayed varying levels of sustained current. These whole-cell currents were characterized with respect to three different properties: 1) the pH sensitivity (pH50 and Hill slope); 2) the time constant of desensitization (τdesens), measured at various pH values; and 3) the amplitude of the residual non-desensitizing current at pH 4.0 (Table I). Some ASIC channels exhibited desensitization kinetics that were dependent on the applied proton concentration, whereas others had kinetics that were independent of proton concentration. When comparing channels with these different kinetic properties, values of τdesens determined at a proton concentration close to the pH50 values or in some cases pH100 values for activation were used.Table IFunctional properties of CHO cells expressing indicated ASIC subunits individually or in combinationsHalf-maximum pH activation (pH50)Hill slopeMean time constant of desensitization at pH50 (τdesens)Sustained current normalized to peak current (pH 4.0) (Isustained/Ipeak)s%ASIC1a5.80.750.64 ± 0.09,* n = 42.5 ± 1.5, n = 7ASIC1b6.14.80.89 ± 0.11,* n = 44.4 ± 1.9, n = 6ASIC2a4.52.21.4 ± 0.2,* n = 77.5 ± 0.8, n = 20ASIC36.41.60.29 ± 0.02, n = 926 ± 2.2, n = 25ASIC1a/ASIC1b6.00.651.3 ± 0.06,* n = 75 ± 1.3, n = 18ASIC1a/ASIC2a5.51.30.41 ± 0.07, n = 55.7 ± 1.7, n = 15ASIC1a/ASIC2b6.21.10.97 ± 0.19,* n = 53.5 ± 1.2, n = 17ASIC1a/ASIC36.31.50.16 ± 0.03, n = 53.7 ± 0.6, n = 17ASIC1b/ASIC2a4.92.41.0 ± 0.08, n = 714 ± 1.5, n = 14ASIC1b/ASIC2bNDNDNDNDASIC1b/ASIC36.03.10.23 ± 0.01, n = 415 ± 2.3, n = 25ASIC2a/ASIC2b4.83.93.5 ± 0.6,* n = 517 ± 1.6, n = 13ASIC2a/ASIC35.72.40.19 ± 0.02, n = 6105 ± 45, n = 21ASIC2b/ASIC36.51.80.23 ± 0.02, n = 519 ± 4.0, n = 26ASIC1a/ASIC2a/ASIC35.10.650.37 ± 0.02, n = 1414 ± 2.5, n = 37ASIC1a/ASIC2b/ASIC36.31.00.21 ± 0.04, n = 62.7 ± 0.9, n = 18ASIC1b/ASIC2a/ASIC34.91.00.55 ± 0.09, n = 1018 ± 2.9, n = 21 Open table in a new tab Homomeric Expression of ASIC Subunits—The expression of ASIC1a, ASIC1b, ASIC2a, or ASIC3 in CHO cells resulted in functional acid-sensitive channels (Fig. 1, A–E), but ASIC2b and ASIC4 could not be activated even at pH 4. Whereas ASIC1a, ASIC1b, and ASIC2a displayed transient activation characteristics, ASIC3 was found to have two different activation profiles. In some cells ASIC3 had a transient activation profile (Fig. 1D), but in other cells a slower activating current followed the transient current (Fig. 1E). The proton affinities for the various channels varied by two orders of magnitude (Fig. 2A and Table I), with ASIC3 being the most sensitive subunit (pH50 = 6.4) and ASIC2a the least sensitive (pH50 = 4.5). Although pH50 was similar for the two ASIC1 splice variants, activation of ASIC1a occurred across a larger pH range, whereas ASIC1b was activated and saturated within a narrow pH range (Fig. 2A). This is clearly reflected in the Hill coefficients, with ASIC1a and ASIC1b having Hill slopes of 0.75 and 4.8, respectively. The Hill coefficients for ASIC2a and ASIC3 were intermediate to those of the two ASIC1 splice variants (Table I).Fig. 2Biophysical properties of homomeric ASICs. A, sensitivity of homomeric ASICs to lowering of extracellular pH from a holding of pH 7.4, showing that ASIC3 is most and ASIC2a least sensitive to low pH and that activation of ASIC1a and ASIC1b can be clearly separated. Currents are normalized to pH 4.0 currents (Imax), except ASIC2a currents, which are not fully saturated at pH 4 and therefore subsequently have been normalized to I/Imax at saturation as estimated from the initial pH dose-response fit. B and C, desensitization kinetics of homomeric ASICs indicated by mean time constants of desensitization (τdesens), revealing that desensitization of ASIC1a, ASIC1b, and ASIC2a is increased when pH is lowered, whereas the rate of desensitization of the transient ASIC3 current is constant despite changes in pH. n = at least four cells for each data point. Bars indicate mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The values of τdesens were strongly dependent upon the proton concentration used for activation of ASIC1a, ASIC1b, and ASIC2a, as the rate of desensitization increased with increasing proton concentrations (Fig. 2, B and C). This is a feature commonly observed for ligand-gated ion channels. In contrast, the desensitization rate of the transient current of ASIC3 was independent of the applied pH (pH 6.5–4.0; p = 0.25) (Fig. 2B). Despite their different pH50 and Hill slopes, no significant differences in the desensitization rates of ASIC1a and ASIC1b were observed at pH50 (p > 0.14). The sustained current remaining at pH 4.0 was in the range of 3–8%, relative to the peak current, for ASIC1a, -1b, and -2a (Table I). ASIC3 displayed a significantly larger sustained current of 26% (p < 0.001) (Table I). ASIC1a Co-expressed with ASIC1b, ASIC2a, ASIC2b, or ASIC3—Co-expression of ASIC1a and one other ASIC subunit gave rise to functional acid-sensitive channels in all cases (Fig. 1, F–I). Proton sensitivities of the different subunit combinations fell into two categories. The ASIC1a+1b, ASIC1a+2a, and ASIC1a+2b combinations all showed proton sensitivities similar to ASIC1a (Fig. 3, A and B, respectively), whereas the sensitivity of the ASIC1a+3 combination was indistinguishable from that of ASIC3 homomeric channels (Fig. 3C). For three of four of these combinations desensitization kinetics were affected in one way or another relative to the respective homomeric receptors; only ASIC1a+2b appeared unchanged compared with the ASIC1a homomeric receptor. The desensitization rate of the ASIC1a+1b combination was dependent on the proton concentration as was the case for the respective homomeric channels (Fig. 4A). Contrary to this, the rates for the ASIC1a+2a and ASIC1a+3 combinations were independent of the proton concentration (p > 0.98 and p > 0.48, respectively) (Fig. 4, B and C). Comparing desensitization rates at pH50, ASIC1a+1b was significantly slower than ASIC1a and ASIC1b (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively), whereas ASIC1a+3 was significantly faster than ASIC1a and ASIC3 (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively). Due to the pH dependence of ASIC1a desensitization, a comparison of the rates of ASIC1a+2a and ASIC1a was complex with significant differences at some proton occupancy levels but not at others. However, measured at pH = 4.0 (∼pH100), ASIC1a+2a desensitization was significantly slower than that of ASIC1a (p < 0.05) but faster than that of ASIC2a (p < 0.001). The sustained current at pH 4.0 of all the combinations was in the range of 3–6% of peak currents, which is not significantly different from homomeric ASIC1a (Table I). Interestingly, when compared with homomeric ASIC3, the ASIC1a+3 combination displayed a major reduction of the level of sustained current (p < 0.001). ASIC1b Co-expressed with ASIC2a, ASIC2b, or ASIC3— ASIC1b co-expressed with ASIC2a or ASIC3 in CHO cells yielded functional channels (Fig. 1, J–K); however, contrary to all other combinations of subunits, ASIC1b+2b did not exhibit proton-activated currents in 30 of 36 cells. In the transfection procedure for ASIC1b+2b, an increase of DNA levels to the highest level possible (before cellular death occurred) was tried, but still, in the few cells that did show a proton-evoked current, the amplitude was very low (<100 pA). For this reason it was concluded that ASIC1b+2b is a non-functional combination, and no data are presented. The proton sensitivity of the ASIC1b+2a combination (Fig. 3D) resembled that of ASIC2a, whereas the sensitivity of ASIC1b+3 (Fig. 3E) was almost identical to that of homomeric ASIC1b. The values of τdesens of both ASIC1b+2a and ASIC1b+3 were independent of the proton concentration used for stimulation (p > 0.23 and p > 0.15, respectively) (Fig. 4, D and E). Again, comparing proton-independent with proton-dependent desensitization is problematic. In general, desensitization rates of ASIC1b+2a could be characterized as intermediate to the respective homomeric channels; ASIC1b+2a was significantly faster than ASIC2a at pH50 (p < 0.05) but significantly slower than ASIC1b at pH100 (p < 0.05). The general picture of ASIC1b+3 was one of a channel desensitizing faster than the respective homomeric channels (Fig. 4E). Indeed, it desensitized significantly faster than ASIC1b at pH50 (p < 0.001); however, despite the pH independence of both ASIC3 and ASIC1b+3 significant differences were not observed for all proton occupancy levels. Still, at pH100 (pH = 4.0) ASIC1b+3 clearly desensitized significantly faster than ASIC3 (p = 0.01). For the ASIC1b+2a combination the level of sustained current at pH 4.0 relative to peak current was 14%, which represents a significant increase compared with either homomeric channel (p < 0.001). The level of sustained current for the ASIC1b+3 combination (15%) was intermediate to the levels determined for the respective homomeric channels (Table I). Co-expression of ASIC2a+2b, ASIC2a+3, and ASIC2b+3— Acid-sensitive channels were formed from co-expressing dual combinations of ASIC2a, ASIC2b, and ASIC3 (Fig. 1, L–O). The activation characteristics of ASIC2a+3 resembled ASIC3 with two different profiles. In some cells ASIC2a+3 had an apparent simple transient activation profile (Fig. 1M), whereas in other cells a slower activating current followed the transient current (Fig. 1N). Despite functionality of all these subunit combinations, the acid sensitivity of ASIC2a and ASIC3 was largely unaffected by the presence of ASIC2b (Fig. 3, D and F, respectively), whereas the sensitivity of ASIC2a+3 was intermediate to either homomeric channel (Fig. 3F). Overall, desensitization kinetics of ASIC2a+2b and ASIC2b+3 were identical to the kinetics of homomeric ASIC2a and ASIC3, respectively (p > 0.05) (Fig. 4, F and G). The τdesens values of ASIC2a+3 were independent on the proton concentration (p > 0.54) (Fig. 4G). At pH50 ASIC2a+3 desensitized significantly faster than ASIC2a (p < 0.01); however, although desensitization of ASIC2a+3 always appeared faster than ASIC3 (Fig. 4G), this difference did not reach significance. Interestingly, the desensitization phase of ASIC2a+3 was masked at pH ≤ 4.5 due to activation of a prominent sustained current (see below). Whole-cell currents measured from cells co-expressing ASIC2a+2b maintained a level of sustained current of 17% at pH 4.0; this represents a significant increase relative to the 7.5% determined for homomeric ASIC2a (p < 0.0001) (Table I). Interestingly the ASIC2a+3 combination displayed a pronounced mean sustained current of 105% at pH 4. The reason for a measured sustained current larger than the peak current is the second slower activating current observed in some cells, which frequently exceeds the amplitude of the transient peak. The sustained current of 105% was significantly greater than the values corresponding to both homomeric ASIC2a and ASIC3 (p < 0.05). The level of sustained current determined for ASIC2b+3 was of a similar magnitude to that of ASIC3 homomers (p > 0.16) (Table I). Co-expression of ASIC1a+2a+3—Co-expressing these three subunits gave rise to channels with peculiar characteristics (Fig. 1P). The proton sensitivity of acid-evoked currents in these cells was highly unusual (Fig. 5A), with activation starting at pH 6.5 and not fully saturating at pH 4, which is also clearly reflected in a low Hill slope of 0.65 (Table I). The τdesens values of ASIC1a+2a+3-mediated whole-cell currents displayed unusual pH dependence, in the range of pH 6–4.5, in that τdesens actually increased with increasing proton concentration (p < 0.01) (Fig. 6A). The desensitization rate at pH50 was similar to that of ASIC1a+2a (p > 0.05) but significantly slower when compared with the rates of ASIC1a+3 and ASIC2a+3 (p < 0.001). The level of sustained current at pH 4.0 did not differ significantly from that of ASIC1a+2a and ASIC1a+3 (p > 0.05) but was significantly lower than that of ASIC2a+3 (p < 0.01) (Table I). Co-expression of ASIC1a+2b+3—Although this co-expression experiment yielded functional channels (Fig. 1Q) the channel characteristics were similar to those of ASIC1a+3. First, the proton sensitivity of acid-evoked currents was virtually identical to that of ASIC1a+3-mediated currents (Fig. 5B). Next, desensitization kinetics were not significantly different from those of ASIC1a+3 at any pH value (p > 0.05) (Fig. 6B). Finally, the level of sustained current normalized to peak current at pH 4.0 was not significantly different from that of ASIC1a+3 (p > 0.35) (Table I). Co-expression of ASIC1b+2a+3—The last triple co-expression tested also yielded functional acid-sensitive channels (Fig. 1R) but again with peculiar characteristics. With respect to the proton sensitivity, the ASIC1b+2a+3 combination was reminiscent of ASIC1a+2a+3 (Fig. 5A) and was thus less acid-sensitive than any of the corresponding pairwise subunit combinations (Table I). Time constants of desensitization for ASIC1b+2a+3-mediated currents were also unusual compared with other subunit combinations, as τdesens increased at increasing proton concentration (Fig. 6A).

https://openalex.org/W2042834905,"Sperm-specific phospholipase Cζ (PLCζ) is known to induce intracellular Ca2+ oscillations and subsequent early embryonic development when expressed in mouse eggs by injection of RNA encoding PLCζ (Saunders, C. M., Larman, M. G., Parrington, J., Cox, L. J., Royse, J., Blayney, L. M., Swann, K., and Lai, F. A. (2002) Development 129, 3533-3544). The present study addressed characteristics of purified mouse PLCζ protein that was synthesized using the baculovirus/Sf9 cell expression system. Microinjection of recombinant PLCζ protein into mouse eggs induced serial Ca2+ spikes quite similar to those produced by the injection of sperm extract, probably because of repetitive Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum caused by continuously produced inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Recombinant PLCδ1 also induced Ca2+ oscillations, but a 20-fold higher concentration was required compared with PLCζ. In the enzymatic assay of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolyzing activity in vitro at various calcium ion concentrations ([Ca2+]), PLCζ exhibited a significant activity at [Ca2+] as low as 10 nm and had 70% maximal activity at 100 nm [Ca2+] that is usually the basal intracellular calcium ion concentration level of cells. On the other hand, the activity of PLCδ1 increased at a [Ca2+] between 1 and 30 μm. EC50 was 52 nm for PLCζ and 5.7 μm for PLCδ1. Thus, PLCζ has an ∼100-fold higher Ca2+ sensitivity than PLCδ1. The ability of purified PLCζ protein to induce Ca2+ oscillations qualifies PLCζ as a proper candidate of the mammalian egg-activating sperm factor. Furthermore, such a high Ca2+ sensitivity of PLC activity as PLCζ that can be active in cells at the resting state is thought to be an appropriate characteristic of the sperm factor, which is introduced into the ooplasm upon sperm-egg fusion, triggers Ca2+ release first, and maintains Ca2+ oscillations. Sperm-specific phospholipase Cζ (PLCζ) is known to induce intracellular Ca2+ oscillations and subsequent early embryonic development when expressed in mouse eggs by injection of RNA encoding PLCζ (Saunders, C.

Therefore, the identification of the Ca2+ oscillation-inducing sperm factor, which is the egg-activating sperm factor, is currently being studied as a central subject to elucidate the mechanisms of fertilization. Recently, Saunders et al. (5Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A.

Matsuda M. Parrington J. Katan M. Swann K. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). PLCζ is the smallest PLC identified to date, lacking the N-terminal PH domain (Fig. 1A) (5Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. Development. 2002; 129: 3533-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that is found in all isoforms of PLCβ, -γ, and -δ and is the site for interaction with membrane phospholipids (12Katan M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Because PLCζ as well as PLCδ lacks a regulatory domain such as the G protein-binding site of PLCβ or the SH domain of PLCγ for phosphorylation by tyrosine kinase, the activation mechanism of PLCζ and PLCδ is unknown. Therefore, it is also necessary to access how PLCζ undergoes the active state for production of InsP3. Here we first show that recombinant PLCζ protein induces Ca2+ oscillations in mouse eggs and that PLCζ possesses an extremely high Ca2+ sensitivity in the PtdInsP2 hydrolyzing activity to be active even at the resting state of cells. Cloning of PLCζ and PLCδ1—cDNA encoding full-length PLCζ (GenBank™ accession number AF435950) was cloned from a cDNA library originated from mouse testis mRNAs. PLCζ cDNA was amplified by PCR using Pfu polymerase and the following primers: forward, 5′-GAC AAGCGGCCCAGATCATG-3′; internal forward primer involving an EcoRI site, 5′-GGAATTCATATGGAAAGCCAACTTCATGAG-3′; reverse, 5′-CTAACGCGTCAGTTACATGCG-3′; internal reverse primer involving an XbaI site, 5′-GTCTAGATTACTCTCTGAAGTACCAAACATAAATAAAC-3′. cDNA of PLCδ1 (GenBank™ accession number AF133125) derived from the mouse testis was amplified using 5′-GGAATTCATATGGACTCCGGTCGGGAC-3′ involving an EcoRI site and 5′-GCTCTAGA TTAGTCCTGGATGGAGATCTTC-3′ involving an XbaI site. PLCζ and PLCδ1 were subcloned into pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene) using EcoRI and XbaI sites. A PLCζ variant lacking three EF-hand domains (GenBank™ accession number AK006672), designated as s-PLCζ, was cloned using the same primers as those for PLCζ except the internal forward primer, 5′-GGAATTCATATGGAGATCGATCACTCTGATTC-3′. A mutant PLCζ lacking three EF-hand domains and a catalytic X domain, PLCζΔEFX, was constructed using 5′-GGAATTCATATGGAGATCGATCACTCTGATT-3′ involving an EcoRI site, 5′-GTCTAGATTACTCTCTGAAGTACCAAACATAAATAAAC-3′ involving an XbaI site, 5′-GTGGGTACCTTATCTGAAACCCACGAG-3′ involving a KpnI site, and the reverse primer. The correct nucleotide sequences of PLCζ (1Miyazaki S. Shirakawa H. Nakada K. Honda Y. Dev. Biol. 1993; 158: 62-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), s-PLCζ, PLCδ1 (10Lee K.L. Kim J.K. Seo M-K. Cha J.-H. Lee K.J. Rha H.K. Mi D.S. Jo Y.-H. Lee K-H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and PLCζΔEFX were confirmed using a BigDye Terminator Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Synthesis and Purification of PLCζ and PLCδ1—Recombinant PLCζ or PLCδ1 was prepared by a baculovirus expression system (13Nagano K. Fukami K. Minagawa T. Watanabe Y. Ozaki C. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2872-2879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Using EcoRI and XbaI sites, the open reading frames of PLCζ, s-PLCζ, PLCδ1, and PLCζΔEFX were subcloned into a baculovirus expression vector, pFastBac HT (Invitrogen), which contains an N-terminal His tag sequence. The recombinant baculoviruses were generated by transformation into DH10Bac, and the transformants containing a PLC-inserted bacmid were selected by blue/white screening (see Instruction Manual by Invitrogen). Sf9 cells were grown at 28 °C in Sf900 serum-free medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal bovine serum. The cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were infected with baculoviruses and incubated for 3 days. The infected cells (3 liters for PLCζ and 300 ml for PLCδ1) were lysed with a French pressure cell in a lysis buffer (120 mm KCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5). The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant filtrated through a 0.22-μm filter was applied to nickel-chelating Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with a wash buffer (400 mm KCl, 50 mm imidazole, and 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5), and protein was eluted with an elution buffer (400 mm KCl, 300 mm imidazole, and 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5). Purified PLC was dialyzed against an intracellular buffer (120 mm KCl and 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5). The final solution was designated as PLC solution. Measurement of PLC Activity—The PLC activity was assayed by hydrolysis of PtdInsP2 (13Nagano K. Fukami K. Minagawa T. Watanabe Y. Ozaki C. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2872-2879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) by mixing 10 μl of PLC solution with 30 μl of Ca2+ buffer and 10 μl of phospholipid micelle solution. The final concentration was 50 μm phosphatidylethanolamine (Sigma), 40 μm PtdInsP2 (Sigma), 1 μCi/ml (∼100 nm) [3H]PtdInsP2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 nm to 100 μm Ca2+, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Ca2+ buffers of various [Ca2+] were prepared by EGTA/CaCl2 mixture (14Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture containing 25,000 dpm of [3H]PtdInsP2 was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding 2 μm of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). Radioactive InsP3 was extracted by adding 0.5 ml of 1 n HCl (13Nagano K. Fukami K. Minagawa T. Watanabe Y. Ozaki C. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2872-2879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and radioactivity in the upper aqueous phase was measured for 1 min in a liquid scintillation counter. PLC for assay was used at the concentration that produced a maximal [3H]InsP3 level of ∼4,000 dpm at a certain range of [Ca2+]. Under these conditions, [3H]InsP3 formation was linear as the function of time and enzyme concentration. Preparation of Eggs—Mature eggs were obtained from the oviducts of B6D2F1 female mice superovulated by intraperitoneal injection of gonadotropins (see Ref. 6Oda S. Deguchi R. Mohri T. Shikano T. Nakanishi S. Miyazaki S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 172-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar for details). The eggs were collected into M2 medium supplement with bovine serum albumin (4 mg/ml) (6Oda S. Deguchi R. Mohri T. Shikano T. Nakanishi S. Miyazaki S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 172-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The eggs were loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (5 μm) (Molecular Probes Inc.) for 8 min at 37 °C. The eggs were then transferred to a plastic dish mounted on an inverted fluorescence microscope and heated at 30-32 °C. Injection of PLC and [Ca2+]i Measurement—PLC solution was injected into the eggs through a glass micropipette (15Kumakiri J. Oda S. Kinoshita K. Miyazaki S. Dev. Biol. 2003; 260: 522-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The injected amount was 5 pl (egg volume, ∼200 pl). [Ca2+]i was measured by a conventional Ca2+ imaging method using an image processor (Argus 200, Hamamatsu Photonics) (see Ref. 15Kumakiri J. Oda S. Kinoshita K. Miyazaki S. Dev. Biol. 2003; 260: 522-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar for details). Images were acquired every 20 s for 30-40 min by applying 340- and 380-nm lights and measuring fluorescence (F) of fura-2 at 510 nm. Data were processed to calculate the fluorescence ratio F340/F380. PLCζ and PLCδ1 with N-terminal His tags were purified up to a major single band shown by silver staining (Fig. 1B). The molecular mass including the His tag was ∼78 and ∼90 kDa, consistent with the full-length PLCζ (647 amino acids) (5Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. Development. 2002; 129: 3533-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and PLCδ1 (756 amino acids) (16Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. Moon K.H. Suh H.W. Rhee S.G. Cell. 1988; 54: 161-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), respectively. Exogenously applied PLC was predicted to produce InsP3 continuously in the eggs and, thereby, cause repetitive Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Microinjection of recombinant PLCζ into the mouse eggs did induce Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 2A, n = 10 eggs). The first Ca2+ transient lasting for 4-5 min was followed by sharp Ca2+ spikes at intervals of 2-3 min. The interspike interval was progressively prolonged. The pattern is very similar to that of Ca2+ oscillations induced by injection of sperm extract (2Jones K.T. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 42: 1-10PubMed Google Scholar, 6Oda S. Deguchi R. Mohri T. Shikano T. Nakanishi S. Miyazaki S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 172-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), although Ca2+ oscillations of lower frequency occur in eggs fertilized with a single spermatozoon (17Deguchi R. Shirakawa H. Oda S. Mohri T. Miyazaki S. Dev. Biol. 2000; 218: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The minimal PLCζ concentration in the injection solution for induction of Ca2+ oscillations was ∼60 μg/ml, and that found in the egg was calculated to be 1.5 μg/ml. The total amount injected was calculated as 300 fg/egg. It has been shown that low frequency Ca2+ oscillations similar to those at fertilization are produced after injection of PLCζ RNA by expressed PLCζ of 45-75 fg/egg estimated from densitometric calibration using an antibody against PLCζ (5Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. Development. 2002; 129: 3533-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The difference in the effective amount of PLCζ for induction of Ca2+ oscillations might be derived from that in some modification of the PLCζ molecule in the cell to a more active form. Injection with a 2-fold lower PLCζ (0.75 μg/ml in the egg) produced only a single Ca2+ transient after a time lag of ∼2 min (Fig. 2B, n = 3). This Ca2+ response pattern is usually observed upon injection of diluted sperm extract (data not shown). The critical PLCζ concentration for induction of a single Ca2+ release was between 15 and 30 μg/ml in the injection solution (Fig. 2, B and C). A protein similar to but shorter than PLCζ (s-PLCζ) is expressed in the mouse testis (GenBank™ accession number AK006672). s-PLCζ lacks 110 amino acid residues from the N terminus corresponding to the EF1, EF2, and EF3 domains but is identical to PLCζ in EF4 and the succeeding region (Fig. 1A). The s-PLCζ gene has not been found in the mouse genome, and s-PLCζ is probably a splicing variant of PLCζ. Recombinant s-PLCζ elicited no Ca2+ spike at the concentration 37-fold higher than that of PLCζ (Fig. 2D), indicating that the EF domain(s) is significant in the induction of Ca2+ oscillations. Recombinant PLCδ1, which possesses basically similar domain features to those of PLCζ except the PH domain (Fig. 1A), induced Ca2+ oscillations at the concentration of 1.2 mg/ml in the injection solution (30 μg/ml in the egg) (Fig. 3A, n = 6) and only a few Ca2+ transients at 0.8 mg/ml (Fig. 3B, n = 3). Thus, an ∼20-fold higher concentration was required for induction of Ca2+ oscillations compared with PLCζ. PLCδ1 induced no Ca2+ response at 0.6 mg/ml (Fig. 3C) or at the lower concentration range at which PLCζ induced Ca2+ oscillations (data not shown). The PLC activity (PtdInsP2 hydrolyzing activity) of PLCζ in vitro was measured at [Ca2+] between 10-9 and 10-4 m in comparison with that of PLCδ1 (Fig. 4). No PLC activity was detected for PLCζΔEFX at any [Ca2+] (Fig. 4B), indicating that the samples from Sf9 cells had no intrinsic PLC activity. The assay was performed using the amount of PLC that was capable of generating maximal [3H]InsP3 of ∼4,000 dpm, which corresponded to 0.32 nmol of InsP3, under the condition that retained the linearity of InsP3 formation to the reaction time and the enzyme concentration during incubation for 5 min. The amount used was 50 ng for PLCζ and 1 ng for PLCδ1 in 50 μl of reaction mixture corresponding to 1 μg/ml and 0.02 μg/ml, respectively. This concentration of PLCζ was in the same range as the intracellular concentration of injected PLCζ that induced Ca2+ release (Fig. 2, A and B). The specific activity of PLCζ was 1.3 μmol/mg/min at 1 μm Ca2+ and that of PLCδ1 was 65 μmol/mg/min at 30 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 4). The specific activity was 50-fold higher for PLCδ1. Nevertheless, PLCζ induced Ca2+ oscillations at 20-fold lower concentrations than PLCδ1 (Figs. 2A and 3A). This implies that PLCζ has a 1000-fold higher efficiency than PLCδ1 in induction of Ca2+ oscillations in the egg when calculated on the basis of the specific PLC activity in vitro under the assumption of comparable dependence on [Ca2+]. To address the advantageous characteristics of PLCζ for induction of Ca2+ oscillations, the dependence of PLC activity on [Ca2+] was examined in vitro. The PLC activity of recombinant PLCδ1 was substantially recognized at 1 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 4A). The activity steeply increased between 1 and 30 μm Ca2+ and attained a saturation level at 30 μm Ca2+. The [Ca2+] for half-maximal PLC activity, EC50, was obtained by fitting a curve to the data using the Hill equation. It was calculated as 5.7 μm (Hill constant, 1.7). In contrast, the PLC activity of recombinant PLCζ was significantly recognized at [Ca2+] as low as 10 nm and reached a maximum at 1 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 4B). EC50 was 52 nm (Hill constant, 0.9), that is, ∼100-fold lower than that for PLCδ1. It should be noted that PLCζ had 70% activity of the maximal level at 100 nm Ca2+, which is the resting [Ca2+]i level in mouse eggs (6Oda S. Deguchi R. Mohri T. Shikano T. Nakanishi S. Miyazaki S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 172-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 18Nakano Y. Shirakawa H. Mitsuhashi N. Kuwabara Y. Miyazaki S. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1997; 3: 1087-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) as well as somatic cells (19Miyazaki S. Jpn. J. Physiol. 1993; 43: 409-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This implies that PLCζ can be active even at the resting state of cells. PLCζ has the highest Ca2+ sensitivity among PLC isoforms identified and characterized to date (20Allen V. Swigart P. Cheung R. Cookcroft S. Katan M. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 21Pawelczyk T. Matecki A. Eur. J.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5020-5028Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). [Ca2+]i increases from 100 nm up to 500-1000 nm in each Ca2+ spike during Ca2+ oscillations in fertilized mouse eggs (25Jones K.T. Nixon V.L. Dev. Biol. 2000; 225: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In Fig. 4B, this [Ca2+] range does not involve a steep Ca2+ dependence, which may be favorable for a positive feedback and pulsatile rise of the PLC activity. The Ca2+ dependence of PLCζ as a whole formed a bell-shaped curve (Fig. 4B), which may cause oscillatory changes in the PLC activity associated with Ca2+ oscillations. However, this seems to be insignificant, because the PLCζ activity substantially decreased at [Ca2+] as high as 10 μm. Ca2+ oscillations could occur on the basis of Ca2+ dependence of the InsP3 receptor (1Miyazaki S. Shirakawa H. Nakada K. Honda Y. Dev. Biol. 1993; 158: 62-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), even if any oscillatory change of PLC activity is absent. They are produced by artificial supply of InsP3 at a sustained low level in the ooplasm (26Sato Y. Miyazaki S. Shikano T. Mitsuhashi N. Takeuchi H. Mikoshiba K. Kuwabara Y. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 58: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A single injection of a nonhydrolysable agonist of InsP3, adenophostin B, into the mouse egg produces long-lasting Ca2+ oscillations (18Nakano Y. Shirakawa H. Mitsuhashi N. Kuwabara Y. Miyazaki S. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1997; 3: 1087-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrated two critical properties of PLCζ using purified recombinant PLCζ protein: the high Ca2+ oscillation-inducing activity in the egg and the high Ca2+ sensitivity in the PtdInsP2 hydrolyzing activity. These properties may rely on the N-terminal EF-hand domains of PLCζ, because s-PLCζ lacking three EF-hand domains was incapable of inducing Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 2D) and exhibited significant Pt-dInsP hydrolyzing activity only when [Ca2+] was over 1 μm (data not shown). The EF domains of PLCζ might have a high affinity to Ca2+. The higher Ca2+ sensitivity of PLCζ is likely to give the ability to trigger Ca2+ release in cells at the resting state. The two properties of PLCζ described above are appropriate for a Ca2+ oscillation-inducing sperm factor, because the sperm factor is thought to be introduced into the ooplasm upon sperm-egg fusion, first triggering Ca2+ release and then maintaining Ca2+ oscillations (2Jones K.T. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 42: 1-10PubMed Google Scholar, 4Swann K. Rev. Reprod. 1996; 1: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It has been shown that boar sperm extract possesses one-third of the maximal PtdInsP2 hydrolyzing activity at 100 nm Ca2+ (27Rice A. Parrington J. Jones K.T. Swann K. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, sperm-specific PLCζ is a strong candidate of the mammalian egg-activating sperm factor. There might be an inactivation mechanism for PLCζ activity in the sperm before it is introduced into the ooplasm. PLCδ1 possessed the much higher enzymatic activity in vitro, but had the much lower Ca2+ oscillation-inducing activity in vivo compared with PLCζ. PLCδ1 has been shown to be expressed in mouse immature germ cells, spermatogonia, but not detected in differentiated spermatids and spermatozoa (10Lee K.L. Kim J.K. Seo M-K. Cha J.-H. Lee K.J. Rha H.K. Mi D.S. Jo Y.-H. Lee K-H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, PLCδ1 is unlikely to be the sperm factor. The superiority of PLCζ to PLCδ1 in the Ca2+ oscillation-inducing activity is thought to be derived from the much higher Ca2+ sensitivity (∼100-fold difference in EC50). However, the large difference in the efficiency of inducing Ca2+ oscillations is not interpreted only in terms of Ca2+-dependent PLC activity in vitro and suggests an additional advantage of PLCζ. There might be an egg factor that promotes the activation of PLCζ or special target membranes for PLCζ in the ooplasm. Further studies are necessary to determine whether PLCζ is the physiological sperm factor at fertilization as well as to elucidate the activation and modification mechanism of PLCζ on the basis of the molecular structure. We thank Drs. T. Awaji, H. Shirakawa, and S. Mitani for valuable advice and discussion throughout the present study."

Although exocytosis of these granules is crucial for hemostasis and thrombosis, the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we show that incubation of permeabilized platelets with unprenylated active mutant Rab27A-Q78L, wild type Rab27A, and Rab27B inhibited the secretion, whereas inactive mutant Rab27A-T23N and other GTPases had no effects. Furthermore, we affinity-purified a GTP-Rab27A-binding protein in platelets and identified it as Munc13-4, a homologue of Munc13-1 known as a priming factor for neurotransmitter release. Recombinant Munc13-4 directly bound to GTP-Rab27A and -Rab27B in vitro, but not other GTPases, and enhanced secretion in an in vitro assay. The inhibition of secretion by unprenylated Rab27A was rescued by the addition of Munc13-4, suggesting that Munc13-4 mediates the function of GTP-Rab27.

Rab GTPases are essential regulatory molecules in vesicle transport (2Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar, 3Zerial M. McBride H.

Rab GTPases are localized to specific organelles and regulate several steps of vesicle transport including vesicle movement along cytoskeletal tracks and vesicle tethering to the target membrane by employing effector molecules that interact with GTP-bound Rab proteins (2Takai Y.

In addition, in cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells in ashen mice, lytic granule secretion is impaired presumably at the docking/fusion step (11Stinchcombe J.C. Bossi G. Booth S. Griffiths G.M. Immunity. 2001; 15: 751-761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 12Haddad E.K. Wu X. Hammer III, J.A. Henkart P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that the bleeding time of ashen mice is prolonged because of platelet dysfunction caused by a lack of intact platelet dense core granules (4Wilson S.M. Yip R. Swing D.A. O'Sullivan T.N. Zhang Y. Novak E.K. Swank R.T. Russell L.B. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Blood. 2002; 100: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, it is important to note that platelets also contain Rab27B, a homologue of Rab27A with 71% identity in the amino acid level, which may compensate for the defect of Rab27A in platelets in ashen mice (14Barral D.C. Ramalho J.S. Anders R. Hume A.N. Knapton H.J. Tolmachova T. Collinson L.M. Goulding D. Authi K.S. Seabra M.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These studies emphasize the requirement of further investigation into the mechanisms by which Rab27 may control the biogenesis and exocytosis of dense core granules in platelets. The final step of vesicle transport is docking and fusion with the target membrane, which is mediated by trans-SNARE 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; PKC, protein kinase C; SLO, streptolysin-O; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; TOF-MS, time-of-flight mass spectrometry.1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; PKC, protein kinase C; SLO, streptolysin-O; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; TOF-MS, time-of-flight mass spectrometry. complex between the vesicle SNARE and the target membrane SNARE (15Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence has revealed that Rab GTPases function upstream of SNARE pairing (2Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar, 3Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2662) Google Scholar). In addition to Rab GTPases, SNARE complex formation is directly regulated by several factors such as Munc18 and Munc13-1. In neuronal cells, Munc18 is thought to bind to the closed conformation of syntaxin1, a target membrane SNARE, to inhibit the trans-SNARE complex formation (16Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 17Yang B. Steegmaier M. Gonzalez Jr., L.C. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In contrast, Munc13-1 acts as a priming factor in neuronal secretion (18Ashery U. Varoqueaux F. Voets T. Betz A. Thakur P. Koch H. Neher E. Brose N. Rettig J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3586-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Munc13-1 is suggested to promote formation of an open conformation of syntaxin1 and induce the assembly of trans-SNARE complexes. This is supported by the fact that transmission defects of unc-13 mutants in Caenorhabditis elegans could be rescued by expression of open form of syntaxin (19Richmond J.E. Weimer R.M. Jorgensen E.M. Nature. 2001; 412: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Munc13-1 and its homologues, Munc13-2 and Munc13-3, are expressed exclusively in brain, except for ubMunc13-2, a splicing variant of Munc13-2 (20Brose N. Hofmann K. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25273-25280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 21Augustin I. Betz A. Herrmann C. Jo T. Brose N. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In brain, each Munc13 isoform expression pattern is spatially restricted, although there is some overlap between isoforms. Munc13-1-deficient mice exhibit partial defects in glutamatergic neuron neurotransmitter release (22Augustin I. Rosenmund C. Sudhof T.C. Brose N. Nature. 1999; 400: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), whereas Munc13-1/Munc13-2 double knockout mice have complete loss of synaptic transmission in not only glutamatergic neurons but also GABAergic neurons (23Varoqueaux F. Sigler A. Rhee J.S. Brose N. Enk C. Reim K. Rosenmund C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9037-9042Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). These studies in mice have revealed the essential and general roles of Munc13s in neurotransmitter release. Recently, the fourth Munc13 homologue, Munc13-4, was identified (24Koch H. Hofmann K. Brose N. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In contrast to Munc13-1–3, Munc13-4 is expressed in non-neuronal tissues (24Koch H. Hofmann K. Brose N. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and its biological function remains to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that Rab27 regulates the Ca2+-induced dense core granule secretion in platelets by showing that the addition of unprenylated Rab27 in an in vitro assay with permeabilized platelets inhibited the secretion. Furthermore, we identified a novel GTP-Rab27-binding protein in platelets as Munc13-4 and demonstrate that Munc13-4 mediates the function of GTP-Rab27 to promote the secretion. Antibodies, Constructs, Materials, and Others—Anti-Na,K-ATPase rabbit polyclonal antibody (25Akayama M. Nakada H. Omori K. Masaki R. Taketani S. Tashiro Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1986; 11: 259-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. K. Omori (Kansai Medical University, Kadoma, Japan). Anti-His6 and anti-PKCα monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Qiagen and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled antimouse and anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences and were used as secondary antibodies for Western blot analysis visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Biosciences). Unless otherwise specified, all of the other chemicals were purchased from Sigma, except for SLO, which was from Dr. S. Bhakdi (Mainz University, Mainz, Germany) (26Palmer M. Harris R. Freytag C. Kehoe M. Tranum-Jensen J. Bhakdi S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1598-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) or from the intensities of the bands in Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels using bovine serum albumin as a standard. cDNA encoding Rab27A was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Nozawa (Gifu International Institute of Biotechnology, Gifu, Japan) (27Nagata K. Satoh T. Itoh H. Kozasa T. Okano Y. Doi T. Kaziro Y. Nozawa Y. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and mutants Rab27A-Q78L and Rab27A-T23N were generated by PCR mutagenesis. cDNAs encoding Rap1B (28Matsui Y. Kikuchi A. Kawata M. Kondo J. Teranishi Y. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 1010-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and Rab3B (29Matsui Y. Kikuchi A. Kondo J. Hishida T. Teranishi Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11071-11074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were from Dr. Y. Takai (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan), and Rab4B (30Chavrier P. Vingron M. Sander C. Simons K. Zerial M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 6578-6585Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and Rab5A (30Chavrier P. Vingron M. Sander C. Simons K. Zerial M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 6578-6585Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) were from Dr. M. Zerial (Max Plank Institute, Dresden, Germany). Human Rab27B cDNA was isolated from the Marathon-Ready human bone marrow cDNA (Clontech) by PCR. All of these cDNAs were subcloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pDEST17 (Invitrogen) for His6-tagged recombinant protein production. GST fusion proteins of Rab3B, Rab4B, Rab5A, Rab27A, and Rab27B were produced by subcloning the cDNAs into pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences). These His6-tagged and GST fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. For full-length Munc13-4 recombinant protein production, the cDNA of Munc13-4 was subcloned into pDEST10 (Invitrogen), and a baculovirus encoding the full-length Munc13-4 was produced using the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen). His6-tagged Munc13-4 recombinant protein was produced in Sf9 insect cells upon infection with the virus and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, followed by further purification with MonoQ anion exchange chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). All of the purified recombinant proteins were extensively dialyzed against buffer A (50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.2, 78 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and stored at -80 °C until use. All of the sequences of the PCR products were confirmed by sequencing using a 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The Assay for Secretion of Dense Core Granules—The standard assay method for the Ca2+-induced dense core granule secretion was essentially as described previously (31Shirakawa R. Yoshioka A. Horiuchi H. Nishioka H. Tabuchi A. Kita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33844-33849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) except that human platelet cytosol was used (32Yoshioka A. Shirakawa R. Nishioka H. Tabuchi A. Higashi T. Ozaki H. Yamamoto A. Kita T. Horiuchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39379-39385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) instead of rat brain cytosol. Unless otherwise specified, the standard assay was following: Freshly obtained washed platelets (1 × 108 platelets/assay, counted with the Coulter Counter) were incubated with [3H]serotonin (∼20,000 cpm/assay) (Amersham Biosciences) to allow uptake into dense core granules. After washing the platelets, the platelet plasma membrane was permeabilized with SLO in Buffer A, where the calculated free calcium ion concentration was ∼20 nm (33Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). The permeabilized platelets were incubated with an ATP regeneration system, human platelet cytosol at 1.5 mg of proteins/ml (for Fig. 1) or 0.8 mg of proteins/ml (for Fig. 6), and tested materials at 4 °C for 30 min followed by further incubation at 30 °C for 2 min. Finally, the platelets were stimulated with 20 μm Ca2+ (33Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar) at 30 °C for 1 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of ice-cold Buffer A containing 10 mm EGTA. After removing platelets by centrifugation, [3H]serotonin released in the supernatant was measured by a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman). The secretion levels of [3H]serotonin were expressed as percentages of the total [3H]serotonin in the permeabilized platelets before the final incubation.Fig. 6Munc13-4 enhances the dense core granule secretion and rescues the inhibition by unprenylated Rab27A. A, permeabilized platelets were first incubated with the indicated concentrations of Munc13-4, and the Ca2+-induced secretion of dense core granules for 1 min was analyzed in the standard assay condition by measuring secreted [3H]serotonin preloaded in dense core granules as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, permeabilized platelets were first incubated in the absence (open circles) or the presence (closed circles) of 0.2 μm Munc13-4 and then incubated with Ca2+ at 20 nm (broken lines) or 20 μm (solid lines) for the indicated periods. The Ca2+-induced secretion of dense core granules for indicated periods was analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, permeabilized platelets were first incubated in the absence or presence of unprenylated Rab27A at 2.0 μm with various concentrations of Munc13-4. The Ca2+-induced secretion of dense core granules for 1 min was analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results shown are expressed as the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) GST-Rab27A Affinity Column Chromatography—Human platelet pellets were provided by Kyoto Red Cross Blood Center and resuspended in Buffer A. After disruption of the platelets by sonication, the sample was centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatant was dialyzed against Buffer A and stored as human platelet cytosol at -80 °C until use. For the affinity chromatography, GTPγS- or GDP-bound GST-Rab27A was prepared by incubation of 30 μg of GST-Rab27A with 1 mm GTPγS or GDP in Buffer A containing 10 mm EDTA at 30 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 15 mm MgCl2 (34Christoforidis S. McBride H.M. Burgoyne R.D. Zerial M. Nature. 1999; 397: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Then the GST- or GST-Rab27A-coated beads were prepared by incubation of glutathione-Sepharose beads with GST or pretreated GST-Rab27A at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by washing the beads with Buffer A three times. The coated beads were incubated with the platelet cytosol (30 mg of proteins) at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by washing the beads with Buffer A three times, and the bead-associated proteins were extracted by the SDS sample buffer. The samples were analyzed in a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel (4–20% gradient gel; Daiichi Chemical). Cloning of Munc13-4 —The TOF-MS analysis of the GTPγS-Rab27A-binding protein at 120 kDa was performed by Kyoto Science Co. (Kyoto, Japan). The report first showed that a candidate protein could be FLJ00067, which contained an incomplete sequence with possible introns and C-terminal deletion. We reconstituted the full-length sequence with several expressed sequence tags overlapping with FLJ00067 and identified it as a human homologue of rat Munc13-4 (24Koch H. Hofmann K. Brose N. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Using the sequences, we designed primers and amplified the full-length cDNA by PCR using the Marathon-Ready human bone marrow cDNA (Clontech). The PCR product was cloned into pENTR (Invitrogen) and verified by sequencing using a 3100 Genetic Analyzer. Anti-Munc13-4 and -Rab27 Antibodies—cDNA encoding the N-terminal region of Munc13-4 (residues 1–262) was obtained by PCR and subcloned into pDEST17 (Invitrogen). The His6-Munc13-4 (1–262) protein was produced and purified as described above. Anti-Munc13-4 and anti-Rab27A rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated using His6- Munc13-4 (1–262) and His6-Rab27A as antigens, respectively. The anti-Rab27A antibody recognized both Rab27A and Rab27B. For transient expression of Munc13-4, HeLa cells were transfected with pcDNA (Invitrogen) containing full-length Munc13-4 using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Assay Analyzing Direct Interaction of Munc13-4 with Rab27—Binding of Munc13-4 with small GTPases was carried out by affinity chromatography. Glutathione-Sepharose beads coated with GTPγS- or GDP-bound Rab GTPases (each 1 μg) were prepared by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C in Buffer A. Then the prepared beads were incubated with purified 0.5 μg of His6-Munc13-4 for 1 h at 4 °C in Buffer A and washed three times with Buffer A at 4 °C. Bead-associated His6-Munc13-4 was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Munc13-4 antibody. Density Gradient Separation of Platelet Organelles—We first loaded [3H]serotonin into dense core granules of platelets from 50 ml of freshly obtained blood and permeabilized the platelets with SLO. Then, after centrifugation to remove most of cytosol and resuspension in 1 ml of Buffer A containing the ATP regeneration system, the platelets were disrupted by sonication and centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min to remove unbroken platelets. The supernatant was layered on the top of metrizamide stepwise gradient (each 1.0-ml layer at 1.30–1.00 g/ml in density decreasing by each 0.03 g/ml from the bottom) in Buffer A containing the ATP regeneration system and centrifuged at 28,000 rpm with Beckman Rotor SW40 for 2 h at 4 °C as described (31Shirakawa R. Yoshioka A. Horiuchi H. Nishioka H. Tabuchi A. Kita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33844-33849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the fractions were analyzed by Western blot with indicated antibodies and counting radioactivity of [3H]serotonin. The separation of the membrane and cytosolic fraction was performed by centrifugation at 300,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C after disrupting platelets by sonication or at 600 × g for 5 min after the SLO permeabilization of platelets. Unprenylated Rab27 Inhibits the Ca2+-induced Dense Core Granule Secretion—In the present study, we used a previously established in vitro assay system using SLO-permeabilized platelets by monitoring secreted [3H]serotonin preloaded into dense core granules (31Shirakawa R.

Agonists promote granule secretions by increasing intracellular calcium ion concentrations in platelets (36Knight D.E. Scrutton M.C. Thromb. Res. 1980; 20: 437-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Upon permeabilization of platelets the intracellular and extracellular concentrations of calcium are equal; therefore we used calcium chloride as a stimulus. In the assay, the secretion of the granules was reconstituted by the addition of ATP and exogenous platelet cytosol, and the response observed was equivalent to intact platelets in the time course and the Ca2+ sensitivity (31Shirakawa R.

Small GTPases produced in E. coli are not modified by the addition of prenyl groups at their C termini (37Nuoffer C. Peter F. Balch W.E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), which is essential for the correct localization and activity (2Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar, 3Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2662) Google Scholar, 38Pereira-Leal J.B. Hume A.N. Seabra M.C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Incubation of permeabilized platelets with Rab27A and Rab27B purified from E. coli inhibited the Ca2+-induced dense core granule secretion in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Incubation of permeabilized platelets with other small GTPases such as Rab3B, Rab4B, Rab5A, or Rap1B, a Ras family small GTPase whose GTP-bound form has been shown to be increased upon platelet activation (39Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), had no effect (Fig. 1B), indicating that the effect of Rab27 is specific. We prepared and purified mutant Rab27A-T23N, which preferentially binds GDP, and Rab27A-Q78L, which lacks GTPase activity (40Menasche G. Feldmann J. Houdusse A. Desaymard C. Fischer A. Goud B. de Saint Basile G. Blood. 2003; 101: 2736-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Incubation of permeabilized platelets with Rab27A-Q78L, but not Rab27A-T23N, inhibited the secretion in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). Inhibition by unprenylated Rab27A-Q78L, wild type Rab27A, and Rab27B could be due to sequestration of putative Rab27 effector molecules from endogenous membrane-associated GTP-Rab27 by forming nonfunctional complexes with effector proteins. These data demonstrate that Rab27 is involved in the regulation of dense core granule secretion in platelets. Identification of Munc13-4 as a GTP-Rab27-binding Protein in Platelet Cytosol—To elucidate the mechanism of action of Rab27, we attempted to identify GTP-Rab27-binding proteins that might mediate the function of Rab27 in the granule secretion, from platelet cytosol by affinity chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2A, we detected one major protein migrating at ∼120 kDa on GTPγS-GST-Rab27A beads (lane 4) but not on GDP-GST-Rab27A- (lane 5) or GST beads (lane 3). TOF-MS analysis of the protein and a data base search revealed that the 120-kDa protein was the human homologue of rat Munc13-4 (24Koch H. Hofmann K. Brose N. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) because most of the peptide masses obtained by the TOF-MS analysis were detected all over the human Munc13-4 molecule (Fig. 2B). Human Munc13-4 consists of 1,090 amino acids, and the primary structure is 88% identical to that of rat Munc13-4. As is the case with Munc13-1–3, Munc13-4 contains two calcium-binding C2 domains and Munc13 homology domains, whereas Munc13-4 lacks the long N-terminal region containing a phorbol ester-binding C1 domain present in Munc13-1–3 (21Augustin I. Betz A. Herrmann C. Jo T. Brose N. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 24Koch H. Hofmann K. Brose N. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). We generated an antibody against the N-terminal region of human Munc13-4 (residues 1–262). The antibody recognized a 120-kDa protein in HeLa cells transfected with Munc13-4 but not in mock transfected cells (Fig. 3A). The antibody recognized a single band at 120 kDa in platelet lysate (Fig. 3B) and also the 120-kDa protein eluted from the GTPγS-GST-Rab27A-loaded affinity chromatography column (data not shown), confirming that the 120-kDa protein that we identified is indeed Munc13-4. To examine whether the interaction of Munc13-4 with Rab27 is direct, we produced and purified full-length His6-Munc13-4 using the baculovirus expression system in Sf9 insect cells (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, recombinant Munc13-4 could bind directly to GTPγS-Rab27A but only slightly to GDP-Rab27A in vitro. Furthermore, Munc13-4 demonstrated a weaker interaction with GTPγS-Rab27B, compared with GTPγS-Rab27A. Importantly, Munc13-4 did not bind to GTPγS-Rab3B, -Rab4B, or -Rab5A (Fig. 4B). Thus, the interaction of Munc13-4 with Rab27 is direct, GTP-dependent, and specific. Localization of Munc13-4 —Munc13-1 has been demonstrated to localize specifically to the presynaptic plasma membrane, although it does not contain a membrane-spanning region (20Brose N. Hofmann K. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25273-25280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Munc13-4 also lacks a transmembrane region. We examined the subcellular localization of Munc13-4 in platelets. As shown in Fig. 5A, Munc13-4 was equally distributed between the cytosolic and membrane fractions in SLO-permeabilized platelets, whereas Rab27 was exclusively membrane-associated. As expected, PKCα was found predominantly in the soluble supernatant fraction (Fig. 5A). When isolated platelets were directly sonicated and centrifuged at 300,000 × g, localization of Munc13-4, Rab27, and PKCα was similar to the results in the SLO-permeabilized platelets (Fig. 5B"

Osteoblasts and odontoblasts synthesize a polymeric collagenous matrix, which forms a template for apatite initiation and elongation. Coordinated and controlled reaction between type I collagen and bone/dentin-specific noncollagenous proteins are necessary for well defined biogenic crystal formation. However, the process by which collagen surfaces become mineralized is not understood. Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) is an acidic noncollagenous protein expressed during the initial stages of mineralized matrix formation in bone and dentin. Here we show that DMP1 bound specifically to type I collagen, with the binding region located at the N-telopeptide region of type I collagen. Peptide mapping identified two acidic clusters in DMP1 responsible for interacting with type I collagen. The collagen binding property of these domains was further confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Transmission electron microscopy analyses have localized DMP1 in the gap region of the collagen fibrils. Fibrillogenesis assays further demonstrated that DMP1 accelerated the assembly of the collagen fibrils in vitro and also increased the diameter of the reconstituted collagen fibrils. In vitro mineralization studies in the presence of calcium and phosphate ions demonstrated apatite deposition only at the collagen-bound DMP1 sites. Thus specific binding of DMP1 and possibly other noncollagenous proteins on the collagen fibril might be a key step in collagen matrix organization and mineralization.

Thus specific binding of DMP1 and possibly other noncollagenous proteins on the collagen fibril might be a key step in collagen matrix organization and mineralization. Mineralized tissues such as bone and dentin are hierarchically organized biocomposites possessing unique mechanical properties (1Weiner S. Wagner H.D. Annu. Rev. Mater. Sci. 1998; 28: 271-298Crossref Scopus (2225) Google Scholar). Understanding the biomineralization process is of great value for synthesis of bioengineered bone and dentin-like materials with optimum structural properties. Type I collagen accounts for 90% of the total protein in the organic matrix of bone and dentin (1Weiner S. Wagner H.D. Annu. Rev. Mater. Sci. 1998; 28: 271-298Crossref Scopus (2225) Google Scholar). It not only provides the structural framework with viscoelastic properties but also defines compartments for ordered mineral deposition. Studies have demonstrated that the apatite crystals are first nucleated in the gap region, and the growing mineral platelets are highly organized in a staggered manner within the collagen fibrils (2Traub W. Arad T. Weiner S. Matrix. 1992; 12: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 3Jager I. Fratzl P. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1737-1746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). It is well established that type I collagen matrix does not have the capacity to induce matrix-specific mineral formation from metastable calcium phosphate solutions that do not spontaneously precipitate. Several in vitro studies have demonstrated that ordered mineralization of apatite on collagen fibril is impossible without additives (4Saito T. Arsenault A.L. Yamauchi M. Kuboki Y. Crenshaw M.A. Bone. 1997; 21: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 5Bradt J. Mertig M. Teresiak A. Pompe W. Chem. Mater. 1999; 11: 2694-2701Crossref Scopus (283) Google Scholar). As a result, much attention has been drawn to the noncollagenous proteins (NCPs) 1The abbreviations used are: NCP, noncollagenous protein; AFM, atomic force microscopy; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; DMP, dentin matrix protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; TPCK, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone. 1The abbreviations used are: NCP, noncollagenous protein; AFM, atomic force microscopy; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; DMP, dentin matrix protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; TPCK, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone. that are tightly bound to the collagen fibers in mineralized tissues. Bone and/or dentin-specific NCPs are mostly acidic in nature and are rich in glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and phosphoserines (6Boskey A.L. Connect. Tissue Res. 1996; 35: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 7Butler W.T. Ritchie H. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 169-179PubMed Google Scholar). They possess high calcium binding capacity and hydroxyapatite affinity (8Chen Y. Bal B.S. Gorski J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24871-24878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Veis A. Calcif.

Tissue Int. 2002; 71: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In vitro mineralization analyses suggest that these NCPs can greatly influence the apatite deposition rate and morphology of crystals, therefore they can be considered as nucleators or inhibitors of mineralization (11Hunter G.K. Hauschka P.V. Poole A.R. Rosenberg L.C. Goldberg H.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Results from genetic disease analyses and transgenic animal models show that dysfunctional NCPs cause impaired mineralization in vivo (12Xiao S. Yu C. Chou X. Yuan W. Wang Y. Bu L. Fu G. Qian M.

All of these results suggest an active regulatory role for NCPs during the biomineralization process. Several NCPs have been reported to bind to the collagen surface (8Chen Y. Bal B.S. Gorski J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24871-24878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Dahl T. Sabsay B. Veis A. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 123: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Phosphophoryn in particular was shown to bind at the e-band in the middle of the gap region (15Traub W. Jodaikin A. Arad T. Veis A. Sabsay B. Matrix. 1992; 12: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Other studies have demonstrated that NCPs bind to charge group constellations favoring binding at the gap zone boundaries in collagen fibrils (16Fujisawa R. Nodasaka Y. Kuboki Y. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1995; 56: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), where the mineral is initiated in vivo (2Traub W. Arad T. Weiner S. Matrix. 1992; 12: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, there is still no in-depth study pertaining to the specific nature of collagen-NCP interaction and how it modulates mineralization. Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) is an acidic noncollagenous protein (17George A. Sabsay B. Simonian P.A. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-12630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is now known to be present in the mineralized matrix of both dentin and bone (18Qin C. Brunn J.C. Jones J. George A. Ramachandran A. Gorski J.P. Butler W.T. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 2001; 109: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization experiments have demonstrated that the initial expression of DMP1 coincides with bone and dentin mineralization (19Kamiya N. Takagi M. Histochem. J. 2001; 33: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 20George A. Silberstein R. Veis A. Connect. Tissue Res. 1995; 33: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), indicating that DMP1 is actively involved in regulating the temporal and spatial aspects of mineral initiation. This assumption was further confirmed by preliminary results showing that recombinant DMP1 can initiate apatite nucleation in vitro (21He G. Dahl T. Veis A. George A. Connect. Tissue Res. 2003; 44 (suppl.): 240-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To understand DMP1-mediated spatial regulation of matrix-mediated mineralization, we hypothesize that specific collagen fibril-DMP1 interaction is necessary for mineral induction. In this study we have demonstrated that DMP1 binds to the N-telopeptide of fibrillar type I collagen in vitro in a regular, periodic manner. Further, the functional collagen binding domains in DMP1 have also been identified and characterized. These results provide the molecular basis underlying the initial steps involved in mineralized tissue formation, namely the specific binding of NCPs on collagen template. Solid-phase Binding Assay of DMP1 with Monomeric Collagen— Lathyritic rat skin collagen was prepared as described previously (22Payne K.J. Veis A. Biopolymers. 1988; 27: 1749-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The collagen was then dissolved in 0.01 m HCl at a 1 mg/ml concentration. Collagen binding property (23Dickeson S.K. Mathis N.L. Rahman M. Bergelson J.M. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32182-32191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was determined by coating microtiter plates (Immulon 4, Dynex Technologies) with 5 μg of type I collagen in 100 μl of 0.1 m acetic acid/well overnight at 4 °C. Wells were washed three times with PBS and blocked with 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS at 37 °C for 2 h before the addition of varying concentrations of the GST-fused recombinant DMP1 (24Srinivasan R. Chen B. Gorski J.P. George A. Connect. Tissue Res. 1999; 40: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). After incubation at room temperature for 2 h with gentle shaking, the wells were extensively washed with PBST (PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20). They were then incubated with mouse anti-GST monoclonal antibody (1:1000, Sigma) for 2 h. The plates were washed three times with PBST, and then alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) diluted 10,000-fold with blocking buffer was added to the wells. After incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the wells were washed again with PBST. The color was developed by adding 100 μl of 1.3 m diethanolamine, pH 9.8, containing 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) to the wells. After 15 min of incubation the absorbance at 405 nm (A405 nm) was measured using a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp.). Experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated with independently prepared DMP1 preparations. Colorimetric readings from wells blocked with BSA without collagen coating were set as the base line and subtracted from reading values of other wells. Bound protein in each well was calculated based on the reference colorimetric readings from wells pre-coated with known amount of the corresponding protein. The KD values were determined from the corresponding Scatchard plot analysis. Data are presented as the mean value ± S.E. from a representative experiment (n = 3). Solid-phase Binding Assay of DMP1 with N-Telopeptide—The rat α1(I) N-telopeptide, EMSYGYDEKSAGVAVP, was synthesized and purified as described previously (25George A. Malone J.P. Veis A. Proc. Indian Acad. Sci. (Chem. Sci.). 1999; 111: 121-131Google Scholar). The peptide was biotinylated by biotinamidohexanoic acid 3-sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide (Sigma) based on the protocol provided by the manufacturer. 10 μg of recombinant DMP1 in 100 μl of PBS was adsorbed onto Immulon 4 flat-bottom plate wells overnight at 4 °C. After washing once with 400 μl of wash buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), the wells were blocked with 400 μl of blocking solution (0.5% BSA in PBS) for 2 h. The wells were then rinsed with 400 μl of washing buffer four times and incubated with 100 μl of biotinylated N-telopeptide for 2 h in a concentration-dependent gradient. After four washes with 400 μl of washing buffer, the wells were incubated with ExtrAvidin®-alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) for 1 h with a dilution at 1:50,000. The wells were then washed with washing buffer, developed with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma), and read with a colorimetric microtiter plate reader at 405 nm. Wells were set up in triplicate, and the final readings were averaged. DMP1 Subcloning—To identify the functional domain in DMP1 that interacts with type I collagen, the coding sequence of DMP1 cDNA was subamplified into two parts (nucleotides 58–1029 and 1009–1365) by PCR with a set of primers flanking the required sequence region. Both of the PCR fragments were then inserted into the pGEX-4T3 vector (Amersham Biosciences) and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-DE3 cells (Invitrogen). The GST fusion protein, induced and purified by standard procedures, was cleaved by thrombin at 4 °C overnight. The corresponding recombinant peptides were termed N-DMP1 (residues 20–343) and C-DMP1 (residues 337–456). Identification of Collagen Binding Domains in DMP1 by Proteolytic Digestion and Mass Spectrometric Analysis—100 μg of C-DMP1 in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, was mixed with 2 μg of Proteomics Grade Trypsin (TPCK-treated, Sigma) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. After incubation, the reaction was terminated by the addition of trypsin inhibitor (T9003, Sigma), and the mixture was loaded on a 1-ml collagen-immobilized Sepharose 4B column equilibrated with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5. The column was then washed extensively with 500 mm NaCl to dissociate nonspecific binding. The eluted solution and the original trypsin digests were subjected to MALDI analysis. An aliquot of the peptide mixture (1 μl) was spotted onto the MALDI target plate and overlaid with 1 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid solution (20 mg/ml in 100% acetonitrile). A Voyager-DE STR MALDI mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) equipped with delayed extraction was employed for peptide mass mapping in positive reflector mode. Peptide mass maps were identified based on the theoretical digests map obtained by the online protein-cutter program (delphi.phys.univ-tours.fr/Prolysis/cutter.html). Site-directed Mutagenesis of DMP1 cDNA—Based on MALDI analyses, two amino acid clusters in DMP1 were mutated to examine their collagen binding function. The primers used were: a, GGA TCC GCC AGA TAC CAA AAT ACT GAA; b, GTC CTC CTC ACT GGA CTC ACT GTT CTT TG; c, AGT GAG TCC AGT GAG GAG GAC AGA GCT GAA C; d, GC GGC CGC ATC TTG GCA ATC ATT GTC; e, AGA GTC ACT GTC CCT GTT TTC CTC AGA CGG CT; f, GAC AGT GAC TCT CAG GAC AGT AGC GCG ATC C. D1-col-m1 Construct—Using “ab” and “cd” primers separately, DMP1 cDNA was subamplified into two parts (58–1068 and 1048–1440). The PCR products were gel-purified, mixed in a 1:1 ratio, and used as the template for further amplification using “ad” as primers, to generate full-length DMP1 cDNA with mutated sequence. The PCR product was inserted into TA vector (PCR4TOPO, Invitrogen), released with BamHI/NotI, and ligated into pGEX4T-3 vector (Amersham Biosciences) which was digested by BamHI/NotI. D1-col-m2 Construct—Using “ae” and “df” primers separately, DMP1 cDNA was subamplified into two parts (58–1296, 1285–1440). The PCR products were gel-purified, mixed in a 1:1 ratio, and used as the template for further amplification using “ad” as primers. The PCR product was inserted into TA vector (PCR4TOPO, Invitrogen), released with BamHI/NotI, and ligated into pGEX4T-3 vector (Amersham Biosciences) which was digested by BamHI/NotI. D1-col-m3 Construct—The construction process is the same as for D1-col-m2 except that the PCR template used was D1-col-m1 cDNA. All of the constructs were inserted into pGEX4T-3 plasmid and transformed into BL21-DE3 (Invitrogen) E. coli. The recombinant proteins were expressed and purified as mentioned above. Fibrillogenesis Experiment—Collagen fibril assembly was monitored by spectrophotometric turbidity measurements at 313 nm as a function of time at 26 °C (26George A. Veis A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2372-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The “cold-start” method was used to initiate fibrillogenesis (27Payne K.J. King T.A. Holmes D.F. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 1185-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). At 4 °C, 500 μl of a solution containing 0.2 mg/ml type I collagen in 0.01 m HCl was mixed with 500 μl (0, 2, and 10 μm DMP1) of solution in double strength phosphate buffer (9.3 mm Na2HPO4, 5.83 mm KH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.04) separately, resulting in a 0.1 mg/ml collagen solution with 0, 1, and 5 μm DMP1 setups. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) Analyses—For AFM analyses, reconstituted collagen fibrils were prepared at 26 °C for 15 min as mentioned above. 10 μl of collagen solution was adsorbed onto freshly peeled mica surface for 10 min. After washing with water, the sample was air-dried, and collagen fibrils were imaged by tapping mode using multimode Nanoscope III AFM (Digital Instruments) equipped with a D-scanner. Silicon cantilevers with a 300-MHz resonance frequency were used. The average diameter and bandwidth of the fibrils were analyzed by “off-line section analyses.” For TEM analysis, colloidal gold-DMP1 complex was prepared according to the method of Slot and Geuze (28Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 87-93PubMed Google Scholar) using a 4 μg/ml gold suspension to yield a particle size of 4–6 nm after centrifugation. Carbon-formvar-coated nickel grids were floated on a drop of fibrillar collagen suspension for 2 h at room temperature. The grids were subsequently washed with water and suspended on a drop of DMP1-gold solution surface overnight at 4 °C. The grids were then washed with water and negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate for 1 min. Colloidal gold-labeled bovine serum albumin prepared according to the same procedure was used as a negative control for collagen binding analysis. The samples were examined with an electron microscope (JEOL 1200 EX) operating at 120 kV. In Vitro Apatite Nucleation Assay—The in vitro apatite nucleation assay was conducted as described previously (21He G. Dahl T. Veis A. George A. Connect. Tissue Res. 2003; 44 (suppl.): 240-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, collagen-DMP1-coated grids were inserted into a channel connecting two halves of an electrolytic cell, with one compartment containing calcium buffer (165 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) and the other phosphate buffer (165 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4). The ionic concentration and ionic strength mimicked the physiological condition. When an external 1-mA current was applied, the ions traversed over the grid surface continuously. The buffers were changed regularly to maintain a constant ionic environment and were tested periodically. The nucleation experiment was conducted for 5 days. Grids coated with collagen fibrils served as control. Binding of DMP1 to Immobilized Type I Collagen—A solidphase binding assay was used as the method of choice for characterization of interactions between collagen and noncollagenous proteins (8Chen Y. Bal B.S. Gorski J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24871-24878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dickeson S.K. Mathis N.L. Rahman M. Bergelson J.M. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32182-32191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The binding curves shown in Fig. 1 demonstrate that the full-length DMP1 bound to collagen in a concentration-dependent and saturated manner (with an apparent KD = 3.8 ± 1.7 μm and maximum binding amount at Bmax = 68 ± 12.6 nmol/5 μg type I collagen). To identify the specific domain responsible for this interaction, DMP1 cDNA was subcloned into two parts and expressed recombinantly. A solid-phase binding assay clearly demonstrated that only the C-terminal end of DMP1 had affinity to the immobilized collagen with an apparent KD = 2 ± 0.5 μm and maximum binding amount at Bmax = 15 ± 2.3 nmol/5 μg of type I collagen (Fig. 1). DMP1 Specifically Binds to the N-Telopeptide Region of the Collagen Fibril—In an attempt to study the specific domain on the collagen molecule that was responsible for interaction with DMP1, solid-phase binding assays were performed with synthesized N-telopeptide (Fig. 2). Results from this study showed that the N-telopeptide demonstrated strong specific binding affinity with DMP1 with a KD of 0.3 ± 0.12 μm. The binding amount Bmax was found to be 2.2 ± 0.3 nmol/10 μg of coated DMP1, which represents an ∼1:1 molar ratio. This observation suggests that in the collagen fibril assembly the N-telopeptide region could be a major site for specific binding of DMP1. Mapping the Collagen Binding Sites on DMP1—To identify the amino acid residues on DMP1 that are directly responsible for collagen binding, the C-terminal DMP1 was trypsinized and passed through a collagen-immobilized column. MALDI-TOF analysis demonstrated that three peptides bound on the collagen column: 349DSESSEEDR357 (theoretical [M+H]+ = 424SEENR429 (theoretical [M+H]+ = 634.63), 429DSDSQDSSR437 (theoretical [M+H]+ = 996.92) (Fig. 3). Of these, two peptide clusters, 349DSESSEEDR357 and 424SEENRDSDSQDSSR437 at the C-terminal end of DMP1 demonstrated high binding affinity with immobilized collagen. No peptides were found to be retained because of nonspecific affinity to the Sepharose 4B column. To further confirm this data, mutations were introduced in the putative collagen binding clusters by substitution with neutral sequences as shown in Fig. 4A, and three mutated proteins were expressed as recombinant proteins. Two of these recombinant proteins contained 1053.97), individually mutated sites (D1-col-M1, D1-col-M2), and the other recombinant protein contained mutations in both of the collagen binding peptides (D1-col-M3). These recombinant proteins were then employed for solid-phase binding assays, and their collagen-binding efficiency was examined. Compared with native DMP1, D1-col-M1 and D1-col-M2 demonstrated collagen binding properties, but their maximum binding amount (Bmax) was 25 ± 3.2 nmol/5 μg of collagen for D1-col-M1 and 20 ± 2.5 nmol for D1-col-M2. These values were significantly lower than that of native DMP1 (68 ± 12.6 nmol). No collagen binding affinity was seen with D1-col-M3 (Fig. 4B). These results further confirmed that both 349DSESSEEDR357 and 424SEENRDSDSQDSSR437 were responsible for binding collagen monomers.Fig. 4Characterization of the collagen binding sites in DMP1. A, protein constructs were designed with putative collagen binding sites mutated by site-directed mutagenesis as described under “Materials and Methods.” B, solid-state binding assay of the mutated rDMP1s with Type I collagen. The binding profiles demonstrated that both clusters impaired the effect of collagen binding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) DMP1 Accelerates Type I Collagen Fibrillogenesis and Increases the Fibril Diameter—To determine the role of DMP1 during collagen fibrillogenesis, fibril formation was initiated by the cold-start procedure. In a typical collagen fibrillogenesis experiment, the turbidity plot is characterized by a sigmoidal curve, constituted by a lag phase (defined as the intercept of the line of maximum slope with the horizontal axis) during which the hydrodynamic parameters of the monomers do not appear to change, followed by a rapid fibril growth phase and finally a plateau region (29Na G.C. Butz L.J. Carroll R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12290-12299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under the present experimental conditions, the kinetics of fibril assembly demonstrated that in the absence of DMP1, the lag period appeared longer and was ∼5 min. However, the lag period dropped to 3 and 2 min when 1 and 5 μm DMP1 was added in separate turbidity experiments (Fig. 5). The slopes of the growth phase and the final turbidity increased with the presence of DMP1. These changes were found to be concentration-dependent, with progressively accelerated fibril formation in the presence of increasing amounts of DMP1. AFM analyses have been successful in visualizing biomolecules at nanoscale and possess the advantage of maintaining biological molecules and their interactions at near physiological conditions (30Agarwal G. Kovac L. Radziejewski C. Samuelsson S.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11091-11098Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 31Paige M.F Rainey J.K. Goh M.C. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 3211-3216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). When analyzed by AFM, fibrils reconstituted in the presence of DMP1 appeared to be well formed with clear D periodic banding patterns (Fig. 6). However, using the software analysis all of the reconstituted fibrils had a bandwidth of ∼67 nm, irrespective of the presence of DMP1. The increase in the turbidity values suggested that the diameter of the constituted fibrils were larger in the presence of DMP1. In the absence of DMP1 the diameter of the fibrils formed was measured at 150 ± 15 nm. However, when 1 μm DMP1 was added to 0.1 mg/ml collagen solution, the average diameter of the final fibrils was 302 ± 38 nm, with a strong tendency toward aggregating and forming bigger fibrils (Fig. 6). Thus these results demonstrate that the addition of DMP1 markedly accelerates the kinetics of collagen fibril assembly.Fig. 6Determination of the diameter of the collagen fibrils by AFM. Reconstituted collagen fibrils prepared without DMP1 (A) and with 1 μm DMP1 (B) were adsorbed onto a freshly peeled mica surface and imaged by tapping mode AFM. Multiple images were obtained, and the average diameter and bandwidth of the fibrils were analyzed by off-line section analyses. The diameter of reconstituted collagen fibrils in the absence of DMP1 was found to be 150 ± 15 nm and in the presence of 1 μm DMP1 was 302 ± 38 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) DMP1 Is Located in the Gap Region of the Reconstituted Collagen Fibril Surface—The localization of DMP1 on collagen fibrils was investigated by colloidal gold labeling as this is the classical method used to characterize collagen-NCP interactions (16Fujisawa R. Nodasaka Y. Kuboki Y. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1995; 56: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). TEM analysis of DMP1-gold complex incubated on grids pre-coated with reconstituted collagen fibrils and negatively stained confirmed that DMP1-gold complex was detected at the edge of the gap region (Fig. 7, A–D). Of the 138 gold particles examined, ∼95% was located in the gap region. These data corroborate well with results showing specific binding of DMP1 to the N-telopeptide, as this region is located at the edge of the gap region. As a negative control, gold-colloid particles with BSA were found to be randomly distributed and did not associate with type I collagen fibrils (Fig. 7E). In Vitro Mineralization—In vitro mineralization experiments were conducted with our newly established system (21He G. Dahl T. Veis A. George A. Connect. Tissue Res. 2003; 44 (suppl.): 240-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The advantage of this in vitro system is that it maximizes specific mineral depositions during the prolonged experimental period. In the current study, nickel grids bound with collagen fibrils, with and without adsorbed DMP1, were inserted into the system and subjected to mineralization for 5 days. The grids were then subjected directly to TEM analyses. Results demonstrate that no mineral deposition was found on the control collagen surface (Fig. 8, A–D), confirming that the main function of collagen in mineralized tissues is to act as a scaffold. On the contrary, numerous mineral particles were found on collagen surface adsorbed with DMP1 (Fig. 8, E–H). This result strongly suggests that DMP1 can temporally and spatially initiate mineralization when immobilized on the surface of the collagen fibri"
https://openalex.org/W2119695679,"Chemerin is a novel protein identified as the natural ligand of ChemR23 (chemerinR), a previously orphan G protein-coupled receptor expressed in immature dendritic cells and macrophages. Chemerin is synthesized as a secreted precursor, prochemerin, which is poorly active, but converted into a full agonist of chemerinR by proteolytic removal of the last six amino acids. In the present work, we have synthesized a number of peptides derived from the C-terminal domain of human prochemerin and have investigated their functional properties as agonists or antagonists of human chemerinR. We found that the nonapeptide 149YFPGQFAFS157 (chemerin-9), corresponding to the C terminus of processed chemerin, retained most of the activity of the full-size protein, with regard to agonism toward the chemerinR. Extension of this peptide at its N terminus did not increase the activity, whereas further truncations rapidly resulted in inactive compounds. The C-terminal end of the peptide appeared crucial for its activity, as addition of a single amino acid or removal of two amino acids modified the potency by four orders of magnitude. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis identified residues Tyr149, Phe150, Gly152, Phe154, and Phe156 as the key positions for chemerinR activation. A modified peptide (YHSFFFPGQFAFS) was synthesized and iodinated, and a radioligand binding assay was established. It was found that the ability of the various peptides to activate the chemerin receptor was strictly correlated with their affinity in the binding assay. These results confirm that a precise C-terminal processing is required for the generation of a chemerinR agonist. The possibility to restrict a medium sized protein to a nonapeptide, while keeping a low nanomolar affinity for its receptor is unusual among G protein-coupled receptors ligands.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary.1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. constitute the largest family of membrane receptors, and members of this family represent the ultimate targets of over half the biologically active molecules used presently as therapeutic agents (1Drews J. Science. 2000; 287: 1960-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). The GPCR family still includes a large number of orphan receptors, which have been made available through various cloning procedures, such as PCR amplification using degenerate oligonucleotides and systematic sequencing of cDNA libraries and genomes. Some of these orphan receptors have allowed over the past few years to uncover novel extracellular signaling pathways involved in various physiological or pathological processes (2Marchese A.

Such new ligands were purified on the basis of their activity on an orphan receptor and subsequently characterized through mass spectrometry and sequencing analysis, a process referred to as reverse pharmacology. These new ligands include, among others, nociceptin/orphanin FQ (4Meunier J.C. Mollereau C. Toll L. Suaudeau C. Moisand C. Alvinerie P. Butour J.L. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Monsarrat B.

The involvement of some of these new systems in important physiological processes has already been amply demonstrated, such as the role of orexins in the control of feeding and sleep (6Sakurai T.

As a consequence, a number of these newly identified receptors constitute promising targets for future drug development. ChemR23 was first described as a human orphan G protein-coupled receptor, originally cloned from genomic DNA by low stringency PCR (11Samson M. Edinger A.L. Stordeur P. Rucker J. Verhasselt V. Sharron M. Govaerts C. Mollereau C. Vassart G. Doms R.W. Parmentier M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 1689-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The mouse ortholog, sharing 80% identity at the amino acid level, was described in parallel as Dez (12Methner A. Hermey G. Schinke B. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have recently identified the natural ligand of this receptor, following the identification of a specific biological activity in a human ascitic fluid secondary to an ovary carcinoma (13Wittamer V. Franssen J.D. Vulcano M. Mirjolet J.F. Le Poul E. Migeotte I. Brezillon S. Tyldesley R. Blanpain C. Detheux M. Mantovani A. Sozzani S. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Communi D. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). This biological activity was purified, and the ligand was characterized by mass spectrometry as deriving from the tazarotene-induced gene (Tig)-2. However, the Tig-2 gene encodes a secreted protein, prochemerin, which is poorly active on chemerinR. Prochemerin requires the removal of six amino acids at its C-terminal end, to become a high affinity agonist of chemerinR. The extracellular protease, which is responsible for this activation, is presently not known, but a number of cell lines, including CHO-K1 and COS-7 cells, were shown to process prochemerin adequately. Prochemerin belongs to the structural cathelicidin/cystatin family of proteins, which includes precursors of bactericidal peptides (cathelicidins), precursors of mediators active on leukocytes through G protein-coupled receptors (prokininogen, cathelicidin precursors) as well as cysteine protease inhibitors (cystatins) (14Zanetti M. Gennaro R. Romeo D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 15Salvesen G. Parkes C. Abrahamson M. Grubb A. Barrett A.J. Biochem.

ChemerinR is expressed primarily on immature dendritic cells and macrophages, suggesting a role in the early steps of the mounting of an immune response. Chemerin was indeed shown to promote intracellular calcium release in monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells and to induce chemotaxis of these cell populations in an in vitro setting. The production of bioactive chemerin in bacteria, yeast, or mammalian cells is a tedious process, which has impaired the study of its function so far. In this work, we have tested the functional activity of peptides derived from the C-terminal domain of prochemerin and have determined that a nonapeptide could mimic functional properties of chemerin onto its receptor with high potency (EC50 of 7 nm). The structure-activity relationships of this peptide are analyzed as well as its pharmacological properties on chemerinR-expressing cell lines. Cell Culture—CHO-K1 cell lines expressing the human recombinant chemerin receptor have been described previously (13Wittamer V. Franssen J.D. Vulcano M. Mirjolet J.F. Le Poul E. Migeotte I. Brezillon S. Tyldesley R. Blanpain C. Detheux M. Mantovani A. Sozzani S. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Communi D. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Briefly, a bicistronic eukaryotic expression vector encoding human chemerinR was used to generate stable transfectants in a CHO-K1 cell line co-expressing a mitochondria-targeted form of apoaequorin and Gα16 (WTA11-ChemerinR cell line). Cells were maintained in Ham’s F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 400 μg/ml G418. Peptide Synthesis—All the peptides used were synthesized by solid phase methodology using the Fmoc (9-fluorenyl-methoxycarbonyl) strategy with an automated Symphony apparatus. The peptides were cleaved, precipitated with 10 volumes of cold ether and purified on reverse phase and ion exchange chromatographies to reach our purity criteria (over 97%). The peptide purity was assessed by capillary electrophoresis, and the conformity was verified by electrospray mass spectrometry. Functional Assay—The functional response of chemerinR to peptides was analyzed by measuring the aequorin luminescence in the WTA11-ChemerinR cell line, as described (17Stables J. Green A. Marshall F. Fraser N. Knight E. Sautel M. Milligan G. Lee M. Rees S. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were collected from plates with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5 mm EDTA, pelleted for 2 min at 1000 × g, resuspended in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium at a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml and incubated for 3 h in the dark in the presence of coelenterazine H (Molecular Probes) at a final concentration of 5 μm. Cells were diluted 5-fold before use. Peptides in a volume of 50 μl were added to 50 μl of cell suspension, and luminescence was measured for 20 s in a Packard luminometer. Functional parameters were determined with the program Prism (Graphpad Software) using nonlinear regression applied to a sigmoidal dose-response model. Binding Assays—The YHSFFFPGQFAFS peptide derived from chemerin 146–157 was radioiodinated on the tyrosine by the IODO-GEN technique and separated from unincorporated radioiodine using a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge. The specific activity of this tracer was estimated to 1250 Ci/mmol. Transfected CHO-K1 cells stably expressing chemerinR were collected from plates with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5 mm EDTA, gently pelleted for 2 min at 1000 x g, and resuspended in binding buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2,5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% bovine serum albumin). A mixture of protease inhibitors (one Complete™ tablet/50 ml, Roche Diagnostics) was added before use. Binding assays were performed in Minisorb Tubes (Nunc), using 800,000 cells in a final volume of 200 μl. For saturation binding assays, increasing concentrations of tracer were used. Total binding was measured in the absence of competitor, and nonspecific binding was measured with an excess (1 μm) of unlabeled ligand. For competition binding assays, 0.5 nm tracer (about 100,000 cpm) was used with variable concentrations of competitors. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 27 °C, then bound tracer was separated by filtration through GF/B filters presoaked in 1% bovine serum albumin. The filters were washed four times with ice-cold binding buffer supplemented with 500 mm NaCl and counted in a scintillation counter. Data resulting from competition binding assays were normalized for the nonspecific binding (0%) and the specific binding in the absence of competitor (100%). Binding parameters were determined with Prism using nonlinear regression applied to a one-site competition binding model. Peptides Derived from the C Terminus of Processed Chemerin Are Potent Agonists of the Chemerin Receptor—Previous work has demonstrated that the proteolytic processing of prochemerin into chemerin is essential for the biological activity of the protein (13Wittamer V. Franssen J.D. Vulcano M. Mirjolet J.F. Le Poul E. Migeotte I. Brezillon S. Tyldesley R. Blanpain C. Detheux M. Mantovani A. Sozzani S. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Communi D. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). This processing affects the C-terminal end of the protein, located after the last cysteine involved in the disulfide bonds that presumably stabilize the cystatin fold that characterizes this secreted protein. We therefore reasoned that the C terminus of the protein might constitute an unstructured flexible domain and that peptides derived from this domain could retain part of the biological activities of the full-size protein on the chemerin receptor. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized a first set of peptides derived from the C-terminal end of prochemerin and chemerin. Chemerin 139–157 represents the last 19 amino acids of the active processed protein, starting at Gln139, four amino acids after the last cysteine (see Table I for sequences). As a control, the corresponding peptide prochemerin 139–163 was synthesized, which contains as C-terminal extension the six amino acids of the precursor, which are cleaved off during its proteolytic processing. Prochemerin 158–163, the six amino acids peptide removed during processing, was also synthesized. These three peptides were tested for their ability to trigger intracellular calcium release through the chemerinR, using an aequorin-based assay. For this purpose, a CHO-K1 cell line expressing the human recombinant chemerin receptor, apoaequorin and Gα16 was used, as previously described (13Wittamer V. Franssen J.D. Vulcano M. Mirjolet J.F. Le Poul E. Migeotte I. Brezillon S. Tyldesley R. Blanpain C. Detheux M. Mantovani A. Sozzani S. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Communi D. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Human recombinant chemerin and prochemerin, expressed in CHO-K1 cells and purified from conditioned media by affinity chromatography and high pressure liquid chromatography (13Wittamer V. Franssen J.D. Vulcano M. Mirjolet J.F. Le Poul E. Migeotte I. Brezillon S. Tyldesley R. Blanpain C. Detheux M. Mantovani A. Sozzani S. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Communi D. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), were used as references. As shown in Fig. 1A and Table I, prochemerin 139–163 was devoid of any biological activity up to concentrations of 10 μm, whereas chemerin 139–157, lacking the last six amino acids of the former, activated the chemerin receptor with high potency (EC50 of 16.7 ± 3.2 nm). The activity of this peptide is only slightly less potent as compared with recombinant human chemerin (EC50 of 4.5 ± 0.7 nm). As described previously, recombinant prochemerin was poorly active (EC50 of 393 ± 116 nm), and this preparation is most probably contaminated by trace amounts of the processed protein, resulting in an overestimation of its actual potency. As expected, no activity was displayed by prochemerin 158–163 (data not shown). On one hand, these results are consistent with our previous data on full-size proteins, which had highlighted the functional importance of the C-terminal proteolytic processing of prochemerin, transforming a poorly active precursor into a high affinity agonist. On the other hand, these results were surprising, because they suggest that chemerin can be down-sized to an unstructured C-terminal peptide of 19 amino acids, without significant loss of biological activity.Table INomenclature of peptides and parameters of their binding and functional properties on the chemerin receptorPeptide nomenclaturePeptide sequenceFunctional parameterspEC50pIC50Recombinant prochemerin1-1636.45 ± 0.15NDaND, not determined.Recombinant chemerin1-1578.38 ± 0.078.18 ± 0.27Prochemerin 139-163QRAGEDPHSFYFPGQFAFSKALPRS≤5NDChemerin 139-157QRAGEDPHSFYFPGQFAFS7.79 ± 0.087.70 ± 0.07Prochemerin 158-163KALPRS≤5NDChemerin 139-158QRAGEDPHSFYFPGQFAFSK≤5≤6Chemerin 139-156QRAGEDPHSFYFPGQFAF7.02 ± 0.067.16 ± 0.09Chemerin 139-155QRAGEDPHSFYFPGQFA≤5≤6Chemerin 139-154QRAGEDPHSFYFPGQF≤5NDChemerin 139-153QRAGEDPHSFYFPGQNDNDChemerin 151-157PGQFAFS≤5NDChemerin 150-157FPGQFAFS5.84 ± 0.16≤6Chemerin 149-157 (named chemerin-9)YFPGQFAFS8.15 ± 0.028.26 ± 0.09Chemerin 148-157FYFPGQFAFS8.11 ± 0.12NDChemerin 146-157HSFYFPGQFAFS7.94 ± 0.12NDChemerin 145-157PHSFYFPGQFAFS7.85 ± 0.01ND[Ala149] chemerin-9AFPGQFAFS6.32 ± 0.086.65 ± 0.14[Ala150] chemerin-9YAPGQFAFS6.84 ± 0.126.60 ± 0.13[Ala151] chemerin-9YFAGQFAFS7.38 ± 0.086.89 ± 0.14[Ala152] chemerin-9YFPAQFAFS5.18 ± 0.11≤6[Ala153] chemerin-9YFPGAFAFS7.46 ± 0.087.59 ± 0.11[Ala154] chemerin-9YFPGQAAFS5.30 ± 0.05≤6[Ala156] chemerin-9YFPGQFAAS4.43 ± 0.08≤6[Ala157] chemerin-9YFPGQFAFA7.32 ± 0.067.23 ± 0.09Tyr-[Ser 149] chemerin 146-157YHSFSFPGQFAFS6.82 ± 0.10NDTyr-[Phe149] chemerin 146-157YHSFFFPGQFAFS7.76 ± 0.117.72 ± 0.05a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Accurate Processing of the Prochemerin C Terminus Is Critical for Bioactivity—Following the observation that chemerin-derived peptides retain a strong biological activity onto chemerinR, we used additional synthetic peptides to determine the structural determinants that are critical for the bioactivity of chemerin. We first investigated the requirement for accurate processing of prochemerin at its C terminus, by adding or removing single amino acids at this end of chemerin 139–157 (Table I). As shown in Fig. 2A and Table I, addition of a single amino acid (prochemerin 139–158) strongly affected the potency of the peptide, because no activation of chemerinR was observed up to concentrations of 10 μm. A similar loss of potency was obtained after removal of two or three amino acids (chemerin 139–155 and 139–154). However, removal of a single amino acid resulted in a peptide able to activate the receptor but with a 6-fold drop of potency (chemerin 139–156, EC50 of 97 ± 13 nm). These data demonstrate that an accurate processing of prochemerin C terminus is required, to generate potent chemerinR agonists. Identification of the Nonapeptide YFPGQFAFS as the Shortest Peptide Retaining High Potency—After specifying the optimal C-terminal end of bioactive peptides, we truncated the N terminus of chemerin 139–157 to determine the shortest peptide retaining high potency. As shown in Fig. 3A and Table I, shortening the peptides to 13 or 12 amino acids (chemerin 145–157 and 146–157) did not change much of the activity, as compared with chemerin 139–157. Shortening further the peptides down to 10 and 9 amino acids (chemerin 148–157 and 149–157) actually increased slightly the potency (EC50 of 8.2 ± 2.1 nm and 7.1 ± 0.3 nm for the decapeptide and nonapeptide, respectively). However, removal of Tyr149, resulting in the octapeptide chemerin 150–157, decreased the potency by two orders of magnitude (EC50 of 1.5 ± 1 μm). For shorter peptides (chemerin 151–157), no activation of chemerinR was obtained up to concentrations of 10 μm. These results demonstrate that residues 139–149 do not contribute to the bioactivity of the peptides and that chemerin can be trimmed down to its C-terminal nonapeptide Tyr149-Phe150-Pro151-Gly152-Gln153-Phe154-Ala155-Phe156-Ser157, without significant loss of potency as compared with the full-size protein. This minimal C-terminal nonapeptide, that represents a new reference peptide for chemerinR pharmacology was renamed chemerin-9. The rapid loss of potency following further truncation suggests an important role of Tyr149 and Phe150 in chemerinR binding and/or activation. Aromatic Residues in Chemerin-9 Are Critical for Receptor Activation—Within the minimal nonapeptide active on the chemerin receptor, we next investigated the relative contribution of each amino acid by using an l-alanine-scanning mutagenesis approach. Eight alanine-substituted chemerin-9 analogues (Ala155 was not mutated) were synthesized and tested for their bioactivity on the chemerinR-expressing cell line. Fig. 4A and Table I show that alanine substitution for Pro151, Gln153, and Ser157 resulted in moderate (5- to 6-fold) decreases of potency (EC50 of 42.5 ± 7.5 nm, 35.8 ± 5.9 nm, and 48.3 ± 5.7 nm, respectively) as compared with the unsubstituted nonapeptide (EC50 of 7.1 ± 0.3 nm). The consequence of alanine substitution for Tyr149 and Phe150 was more damaging, shifting the potency by about two orders of magnitude (EC50 of 496 ± 80 nm and 155 ± 42 nm, respectively). However, the most dramatic effects were observed following Gly152, Phe154, and Phe156 replacement. In these situations, the potencies were decreased by three orders of magnitude or more, as compared with the reference nonapeptide (EC50 of 6.7 ± 2.1 μm, 5.1 ± 1.2 μm, and >10 μm, respectively). These data demonstrate that the aromatic residues Tyr149, Phe150, Phe154, and Phe156, as well as Gly152, constitute key residues for chemerin receptor activation and suggest that some of these residues likely contribute to the direct interaction between chemerin and its receptor. Development of a Radioligand for the Chemerin Receptor— From the results of the alanine-scanning mutagenesis, it appeared that the single tyrosine residue present in full-size chemerin (Tyr149) plays a critical role in receptor activation. This observation is consistent with the fact that all previous attempts to develop a binding assay based on the iodination of this tyrosine in full-size chemerin were unsuccessful. To obtain a bioactive peptide that would be suitable for iodination, we first tested whether this tyrosine could be substituted either for Phe or Ser. We selected the dodecapeptide chemerin 146–157 as the template for these modifications, and we added in parallel a tyrosine at the N terminus of this peptide, a position expected to be neutral for bioactivity, even after addition of the bulky iodine atom (Table I). These two analogs were tested for their ability to promote functional activation of chemerinR, as compared with the reference peptide. As shown in Fig. 5, the substitution by serine affected significantly the potency of the peptide (Tyr-[Ser149]-chemerin 146–157, EC50 of 159 ± 35 nm), to a level similar to the substitution of Tyr149 by alanine in the nonapeptide (see above). In contrast, the exchange of Tyr for Phe had a milder effect on the activity (Tyr-[Phe149]-chemerin 146–157, EC50 of 19 ± 5 nm). These results indicate that it is the aromatic ring of tyrosine, and not the hydroxyl group, that is important for the bioactivity of the peptide. They also validated the use of the Phe substitute as a substrate for radioiodination. Using the IODO-GEN technique, a tracer with a specific activity of 1250 Ci/mmol was obtained, and this tracer was used in a saturation binding assay, using chemerinR-expressing CHO-K1 cells. Saturation binding data were compatible with a single binding site for 125I-Tyr-[Phe149]-chemerin 146–157 (Fig. 6). A dissociation constant (Kd) of 23.9 ± 9.4 nm and a binding capacity (Bmax) of 23,801 ± 401 binding sites per cell were derived from a competitive binding assay using the unlabeled peptide as competitor. In the conditions used, nonspecific binding represented about 30% of the total binding at the KD concentration of tracer, and no specific binding was observed on untransfected CHO-K1 cells.Fig. 6Saturation binding assay on chemerinR-expressing CHO-K1 cells. Saturation binding experiment performed on chemerinR-expressing CHO-K1 cells using 125I-Tyr-[Phe149]-chemerin 146–157 as tracer. Nonspecific binding was determined by using 1 μm unlabeled peptide as competitor. Only specific binding is represented. Curve fitting was performed using the GraphPad Prism software, using a nonlinear regression algorithm and a single site model, providing an apparent Kd of 22 nm. The curve represent the mean ± S.E. of duplicate data points and is representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Residues Involved in Bioactivity Are Also Necessary for Receptor Binding—With the aim of complementing the pharmacological characterization of chemerin-derived peptides, we used the binding assay to explore the ability of these peptides to compete with 125I-Tyr-[Phe149]-chemerin 146–157 binding to the receptor. pIC50 values calculated from competition binding curves are displayed in Table I for the peptides tested in this assay. As shown in Fig. 2B, chemerin 139–157 inhibited binding of the tracer with an IC50 of 20.3 ± 3.2 nm. The functionally inactive peptides prochemerin 139–163 and prochemerin 139–158 did not bind to the receptor up to concentrations of 1 μm. The C-terminally truncated peptide chemerin 139–156 had a 4-fold lower affinity (IC50 of 70 ± 14 nm), as compared with chemerin 139–157, whereas chemerin 139–155 did not bind. Fig. 3B illustrates that chemerin-9 (chemerin 149–157) bound the receptor with high affinity (IC50 of 5.7 ± 1.0 nm), whereas the N-terminally truncated peptide chemerin 150–157 exhibited little, if any, binding to chemerinR. The whole set of alanine-substituted peptides were tested in the binding assay (Fig. 4B). Substitution of Gln153 and Ser157 resulted in a moderate (less than one log) decrease of affinity (IC50 of 27.1 ± 7.2 nm and 61 ± 13 nm, respectively), whereas that of Pro151 affected some more the binding affinity (IC50 of 149 ± 39 nm), as compared with chemerin-9. As observed in the functional assay, the alanine substitution of Tyr149 and Phe150 affected binding strongly (IC50 of 248 ± 77 nm and 273 ± 88 nm, respectively), and no detectable competition of the tracer was observed for the mutants of Gly152, Phe154, and Phe156. Altogether, the binding data correlate therefore fairly well with the results of the functional assay for all peptides tested, and in every case, the reduction of potency or the absence of activation can be attributed solely to a binding defect. Tyr149, Phe150, Gly152, Phe154, and Phe156 appear therefore as key residues involved in the binding of the peptides (and full size chemerin) to the chemerin receptor. Chemerin is a protein of 163 amino acids that we have recently identified as the natural ligand of the previously orphan receptor ChemR23, renamed as the chemerin receptor. Chemerin is able to recruit immature dendritic cells and macrophages, which are the major expression sites of the receptor. Studying the pharmacology and function of this new system has been impaired so far by the difficulty of producing functiona"
https://openalex.org/W2061774676,"ATF6 is a key transcriptional activator of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which allows mammalian cells to maintain cellular homeostasis when they are subjected to a variety of environmental and physiological stresses that target the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). ATF6, a 90-kDa ER transmembrane protein, contains three evolutionarily conserved N-linked glycosylation sites within its carboxyl luminal domain. Although it is well established that p90ATF6 activation requires transit from the ER to the Golgi, where it is cleaved by the S1P/S2P protease system to generate a nuclear form p60ATF6 that acts as a transcriptional activator, the functional significance of p90ATF6 N-linked glycosylation is unknown. Here we show that ER Ca2+ depletion stress, a triggering mechanism for the UPR, induces the formation of ATF6(f), which represents de novo partial glycosylation of newly synthesized p90ATF6. By mutating a single amino acid within the N-linked glycosylation site closest to the carboxyl terminus of p90ATF6, we recreated ATF6(f). This mutation sharply reduces p90ATF6 association with calreticulin, a major Ca2+-binding chaperone for N-glycoprotein. We further determined that ATF6(f) exhibits a faster rate of constitutive transport to the Golgi, resulting in a higher level of p60ATF6 in the nucleus and stronger transactivating activity in the absence of ER stress. Additional analysis of p90ATF6 mutants targeting single or multiple N-glycosylation sites also showed higher constitutive transactivating activity than wild type ATF6. Because accumulation of underglycosylated proteins in the ER is a potent inducer for the UPR, these studies uncover a novel mechanism whereby the glycosylation status of p90ATF6 can serve as a sensor for ER homeostasis, resulting in ATF6 activation to trigger the UPR.

ATF6, a 670-amino acid glycoprotein with the electrophoretic mobility of a 90-kDa protein (p90ATF6), is constitutively expressed in a variety of mammalian cells (1Zhu C. Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4957-4966Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It contains a single transmembrane domain with 272 amino acids oriented in the ER lumen. ER stress induces proteolysis of the membrane-bound p90ATF6, releasing the soluble amino portion of p60ATF6, which relocates to the nucleus and activates the transcription of a wide variety of ER stress-inducible promoters, of which Grp78/BiP is the most well characterized (2Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar, 3Li M. Baumeister P. Roy B. Phan T. Foti D. Luo S. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 2000; 6: 1355-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar). Conservation of protease cleavage sites led to the discovery that Golgi-localized S1P/S2P proteases that process sterol response element binding proteins in response to cholesterol deprivation also process ATF6 in response to ER stress (4Ye J. Rawson R.B. Komuro R. Chen X. Dave U.P. Prywes R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1355-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar). Specific luminal domains of p90ATF6 have been mapped which are required for translocation to the Golgi (5Chen X. Shen J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13045-13052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). It was further determined that GRP78 retains p90ATF6 in the ER by inhibiting its Golgi localization signals (6Shen J. Chen X. Hendershot L. Prywes R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). However, whether other proteins also contribute to the ER retention of p90ATF6 and how ER stress causes ATF6 transit to the Golgi remain to be determined. p90ATF6 exists constitutively as a glycosylated protein. The consensus sequence for N-linked glycosylation sites consists of the Asn-X-Ser/Thr, where X denotes any amino acid except proline (7Bause E. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The ER luminal domain of human p90ATF6 contains three such sites at 472, 584, and 643 amino acids, and the three sites are also conserved in mouse p90ATF6. The fully glycosylated form of ATF6, a 670-amino acid protein, exhibits an electrophoretic mobility of 90 kDa in denaturing SDS-gels in part because of the glycosylation modifications. N-Linked glycans have been shown to play a pivotal role in protein folding, sorting, and transport (8Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). Thus far, the functional significance of N-linked glycosylation of p90ATF6 is not understood. Interestingly, blockage of N-linked protein glycosylation by treating cells with reagents such as tunicamycin (Tu) results in malfolded protein formation in the ER, ATF6 activation, and the onset of UPR. In Tu-treated cells, p90ATF6 is completely nonglycosylated (2Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). In cells treated with DTT, a small fraction of p90ATF6 becomes O-linked glycosylated in the Golgi (6Shen J. Chen X. Hendershot L. Prywes R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). In cells treated with thapsigargin (Tg), which depletes the ER Ca2+ store by specific inhibition of the ER Ca2+-ATPase (9Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar), we reported earlier that in kinetics in parallel with activation of the UPR, p90ATF6 showed an additional appearance of a faster migrating form distinct from the completely nonglycosylated form ATF6 (3Li M. Baumeister P. Roy B. Phan T. Foti D. Luo S. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5096-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). While searching for the nature and functional significance of this new form of p90ATF6, we discovered that ER Ca2+ depletion stress induces the formation of a newly synthesized, partially glycosylated form of p90ATF6, referred to below as ATF6(f). This new form can be generated by mutation of a single amino acid at residue 645 within the N-linked glycosylation site closest to the carboxyl terminus of p90ATF6. We discovered that this mutation reduces sharply the association between p90ATF6 and calreticulin (CRT), a multifunctional ER luminal protein, which acts as a Ca2+-binding protein as well as a molecular chaperone for ER glycoproteins (8Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar, 10Michalak M. Robert Parker J.M. Opas M. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). ATF6(f) exhibits a faster rate of constitutive transport to the Golgi, resulting in a higher level of p60ATF6 in the nucleus and higher transactivating activity toward the Grp78 promoter, a major target of the UPR. Additional analysis of p90ATF6 mutants targeting single or multiple N-glycosylation sites also showed higher constitutive transactivating activity than wild type ATF6. Because accumulation of underglycosylated proteins in the ER is a potent inducer for the UPR, these studies uncover a novel mechanism whereby the glycosylation status of p90ATF6 can serve as a sensor for ER homeostasis, resulting in ATF6 activation to trigger the UPR. Cell Culture Conditions—COS-7, NIH3T3, and 293T cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin-streptomycinneomycin antibiotics at 37 °C. The CHO-7 and S2P-defective M19 cells were generously provided by Dr. Joseph L. Goldstein (University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas) and have been described (4Ye J. Rawson R.B.

For stress induction, cells were grown to 80% confluence and treated with 300 nm Tg or 1.5 μg/ml Tu for various time intervals as indicated. Tg, Tu, and cycloheximide (CHX) were purchased from Sigma. Endoglycosidase H was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Plasmids—The plasmid pCGN-ATF6 containing hemagglutinin epitope (HA)-tagged full-length human ATF6 driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter was provided by Dr. Ron Prywes (Department of Biological Science, Columbia University), and its construction has been described previously (1Zhu C. Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4957-4966Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). pTK-HSV-ATF6 was provided by Dr. Joseph L. Goldstein, and its construction has been described previously (4Ye J. Rawson R.B. Komuro R. Chen X. Dave U.P. Prywes R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1355-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar). The site-specific mutants pCGN-ATF6(T645I), pCGN-ATF6(T586I), pCGN-ATF6(T474I), pCGN-ATF6(DoubleM), pCGN-ATF6(TripleM), and pTK-HSV-ATF6(T645I) were constructed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutated base in the construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The construction of the -169/Luc reporter gene, which spans from -169 to -29 of the rat Grp78 promoter with all three endoplasmic reticulum stress elements, has been described previously (11Roy B. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 12Luo S. Lee A.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 787-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transient Transfection and Assay of Reporter Gene Activity—COS-7, 293T, CHO-7, or M19 cells were grown to 60–80% confluence. One μg of the -169/Luc reporter gene was cotransfected with various amounts of pCGN-ATF6 or pTK-HSV-ATF6 plasmids by using PolyFect or SuperFect reagents (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Empty vector was added to adjust the total amount of plasmids to be the same, and the β-galactosidase reporter gene driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter was used as internal control for transfection efficiency as described previously (3Li M. Baumeister P. Roy B. Phan T. Foti D. Luo S. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5096-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were either grown in normal culture conditions or subjected to Tg and Tu treatment. After drug treatment, cell lysates were prepared for Western blots or luciferase assays, which were performed using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI). Each transfection was performed in duplicate and repeated three or four times. Western Blotting—Conditions for Western blot analysis of endogenous ATF6 using a rabbit polyclonal ATF6 antibody, HA-ATF6, and β-actin have been described previously (3Li M. Baumeister P. Roy B. Phan T. Foti D. Luo S. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5096-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). For the detection of endogenous ATF6 using a mouse monoclonal antibody against the amino-terminal 273 amino acids of ATF6 (Imgenex, San Diego), the primary antibody was diluted at 1:500 in 5% milk and incubated with the transferred membrane at 4 °C overnight. The secondary antibody used was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at a dilution of 1:3,000. For the detection of HSV-ATF6, the mouse monoclonal anti-HSV tag (Novagen, Madison, WI) antibody was used as the primary antibody at a dilution of 1:10,000. For detection of GRP78, the anti-KDEL mouse monoclonal antibody (StressGen, Victoria, BC, Canada) was used as the primary antibody at a dilution of 1:1,500. For detection of CRT, the anti-CRT mouse monoclonal antibody (Calbiochem) was used at a dilution of 1:1,000. For detection of calnexin (CNX), the anti-CNX rabbit polyclonal antibody (StressGen) was used at a dilution of 1:2,000. Biochemical Fractionation—293T cells grown in 150-mm-diameter dishes to 70% confluence were transfected with various pTK-HSV-ATF6 expression plasmids. The conditions for the preparation of soluble nuclear protein have been described previously (3Li M. Baumeister P. Roy B. Phan T. Foti D. Luo S. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5096-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). For the isolation of microsomes, 293T cells transfected with pCGN-ATF6 or pCGN-ATF6(T645I) expression plasmids were processed for preparation of microsomes were as described (13Reddy R.K. Mao C. Baumeister P. Austin R.C. Kaufman R.J. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20915-20924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation Assays—The conditions for coimmunoprecipitation have been described previously (3Li M. Baumeister P. Roy B. Phan T. Foti D. Luo S. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5096-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). 200 μg of microsome extract from each sample were incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) and 10 μl of mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 10 μl of rabbit anti-CRT polyclonal antibody (StressGen). After the incubation, the beads were washed four times. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then subjected to silver staining with a SilverQuest silver staining kit (Invitrogen) or Western blotting. Northern Blotting—The methods for total cellular RNA extraction and Northern blot hybridizations have been described (14Cao X. Zhou Y. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 494-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The cDNA probes used for the detection of Grp78 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase have been described previously (15Zhou Y. Lee A.S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). RT-PCR Conditions—RT-PCR was performed using the SuperScript™ Preamplification System (Invitrogen). For each reaction, 5 μg of total RNA and 1 μl of 0.5 μg/μl oligo(dT) were incubated in sterilized ddH2O for total volume of 12 μl at 70 °C for 10 min, then put on ice for 5 min, and spun down. Four μl of 5× first stand buffer, 2 μl of 0.1 m DTT, 1 μl of 10 mm dNTP were added subsequently and incubated in a 42 °C water bath for 2 min. 200 units of SuperScript reverse transcriptase were added. The reactants were incubated at 42 °C for 1 h and then inactivated at 70 °C for 15 min. Two μl of RT product was subjected to PCR using AmpliTaq Gold™ (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at a final magnesium concentration of 1.5 mm. The PCRs were first heated for 3 min at 94 °C. The PCR cycle was 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. After the completion of 45 PCR cycles, the mixture was incubated for 7 min at 72 °C. The PCRs were performed using GeneAmp PCR system 2400 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The primers used were: 5′-ATF-TM, 5′-ATGAAGTTGTGTCAGAGAAAC-3′ (base 1121–1141 of the ATF6 coding sequence); 3′-ATF-TM, 5′-CTCTTTAGCAGCAGAAAATCCTAG-3′ (base 1297–1317 of the ATF6 coding sequence); 5′-HindIII-hATF, 5′-AACCACAAGCTTAGGGAGCCGGCTGGGGTT-3′ (base 4–21 of the ATF6 coding sequence with the addition of the HindIII site at the 5′ end); 3′-BamHI-hATF, 5′-GTTGGATCCAGCTGCGGGTGCTATTGTAATGACTCA-3′ (base 1986–2010 of the ATF6 coding sequence with the addition of the BamHI site at the 5′ end). Immunofluorescence Staining—COS-7 cells were plated in 8-well Tek-II slides (Nalge-Nunc, Naperfield, IL) at 40% confluence and transfected with either HA-ATF6 or HA-ATF6(T645I) using Polyfect reagent. 36 h after transfection, the cells were treated with either 10 mm DTT (Roche Applied Science) or 2.5 μg/ml brefeldin A (Sigma) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were incubated with anti-HA rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1:500 dilution in TBS-Tween buffer with 1% bovine serum albumin, followed by incubation in 4 μg/ml in PBS of anti-rabbit polyclonal Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Golgi staining was accomplished by incubating the fixed cells with a 1:500 dilution of fluorescence-conjugated anti-Golgi antibody (BD Biosciences). The cells were visualized on a Zeiss confocal microscope at 400× magnification. Five images of each time point containing at least 250 cells were taken and numbered to facilitate a blind controlled observation. Cells containing Golgi-localized HA-ATF6 were counted and confirmed by two separate investigators. The experiment was repeated twice. ER Ca2+ Depletion Induces a New Form of Full-length ATF6 —Upon treatment of NIH3T3 cells with Tg, the level of Grp78 mRNA remained low during the first 2 h and gradually increased to a high level that was sustained up to 16 h (Fig. 1A). The steady-state level of endogenous p90ATF6 as detected by a polyclonal antibody showed a transient reduction during the first 2 h of Tg treatment; however, the level of p90ATF6 was replenished by 4 h and by 8 h, the amount of ATF6 was elevated instead, correlating with sustained high level induction of Grp78 mRNA (Fig. 1B). In addition, the replenished form of p90ATF6 appeared to consist of a doublet band, referred to below as ATF6 and ATF6(f). Longer electrophoresis time further resolved the p90ATF6 doublet into two distinct bands, and the doublet was sustained throughout Tg treatment (Fig. 1C). The formation of ATF6(f) is not cell type-specific because it was also observed in other cell lines such as hamster CHO-7 after 2.5 h of Tg treatment and could be detected using a monoclonal antibody against the first 273 amino acids of ATF6 (Fig. 1D). It is noted that in these Western blots the S1P/S2P cleavage product p60ATF6 was not readily detectable after Tg treatment unless the amount of cell lysates applied was 5–10 times higher; under such conditions, the amount of p90ATF6 is usually saturated, obscuring the new form (data not shown). The formation of ATF6(f) is not restricted to endogenous p90ATF6, as the doublet formation was clearly evident for exogenously expressed, HA-tagged ATF6 following 4 h of Tg treatment (Fig. 1E). Thus, a large fraction of the full-length, transmembrane form of p90ATF6 remains uncleaved after ER Ca2+ depletion and is undergoing changes giving rise to a new form of ATF6. ER Ca2+ Depletion Does Not Induce Alternative Processing of the ATF6 Transmembrane Domain—We next investigated the molecular basis for the p90ATF6 doublet formation. One mechanism could be Tg-induced alternative processing of ATF6 mRNA. To test whether Tg treatment changes the size of the ATF6 mRNA, in particular, whether the transmembrane domain is altered by mRNA splicing, RT-PCR was performed using RNA extracted from nontreated NIH3T3 cells and cells treated with Tg for 2, 8, and 16 h. To scan for size alterations, four pairs of primers were designed (Fig. 2A). For all four primers, the sizes of the RT-PCR products were as predicted (2,007, 1,314, 890, and 197 bp). No new band was detected after Tg treatment, suggesting no change in ATF6 mRNA size (Fig. 2B). Thus, alteration of the transmembrane domain of p90ATF6 through mRNA splicing is unlikely to account for the new form of ATF6. Newly Synthesized ATF6 Becomes Partial Glycosylated Upon ER Ca2+ Deprivation—p90ATF6 contains three evolutionarily conserved N-linked glycosylation sites within its ER luminal domain, and in nonstressed cells p90ATF6 is a glycosylated protein (Fig. 3A). One mechanism for ATF6(f) formation is that Tg treatment results in partial glycosylation of a fraction of p90ATF6. In this scenario, ATF6(f) should exhibit an electrophoretic mobility faster than the fully glycosylated form but slower than the fully nonglycosylated form. If the new form of p90ATF6 is localized in the ER or cis-Golgi, it should be sensitive to endoglycosidase H, which removes simple, high mannose N-linked oligosaccharide characteristic of ER localization but cannot remove N-linked glycans that have been processed in the trans-Golgi (16Maley F. Trimble R.B. Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr., T.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Alternatively, if Tg results in a subpopulation of p90ATF6 relocated to the trans-Golgi where it undergoes further glycosylation modification, ATF6(f) should be endoglycosidase H-resistant. In both cases, blockage of p90ATF6 N-glycosylation by treatment of cells with Tu should eliminate ATF6(f). If the new form of p90ATF6 is caused by other mechanisms unrelated to N-glycosylation, it should persist upon simultaneous treatment with Tg and Tu. To test these different mechanisms, HA-tagged ATF6 was transfected into COS-7 cells followed by treatment of Tg or Tu alone or a combination of both Tg and Tu. Four lines of evidence support the partial N-linked glycosylation mechanism in the ER. First, ATF6(f) exhibited an electrophoretic mobility faster than the fully glycosylated form in nonstressed cells but slower than the nonglycosylated form of p90ATF6 generated by Tu, referred to as ATF6(Ψ-) (Fig. 3B). Second, simultaneous treatment of Tg and Tu reduced the p90ATF6 doublet to a single band with electrophoretic mobility identical to ATF6(Ψ-), which indicates that the critical mechanism for ATF6(f) formation is N-linked glycosylation inhibition. Third, both the fully glycosylated form and ATF6(f) were reduced to the nonglycosylated form upon endoglycosidase H treatment (Fig. 3B), thus ATF6(f) is not caused by altered glycosylation in the trans-Golgi. Lastly, we generated ATF6(f) by site-specific mutation of the glycosylation site closest to the carboxyl end. This site was chosen because progressive deletion of the carboxyl end of p90ATF6 showed that the new form of p90ATF6 was largely eliminated when this site was trimmed, whereas the sites at amino acids 472 and 584 remained intact (data not shown). Mutant T645I was created where the threonine residue at 645 adjacent to the asparagine residue was mutated to isoleucine (Fig. 3A). N-Glycosylation occurs on the ER luminal side of the membrane and requires the protein recognition sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr. An asparagine residue not followed by a serine or threonine as shown will not be recognized by the oligosaccharyl transferase, a key enzyme in N-linked glycosylation mechanism, and therefore will not be glycosylated (17Wormald M.R. Dwek R.A. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: R155-R160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The wild type or the T645I mutant was transfected into COS-7 cells, and the cell lysates were prepared after Tg treatment. As predicted, in nonstressed cells, the electrophoretic mobility of T645I was faster than the fully glycosylated HA-ATF6 (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 1 and 3) but identical to HA-ATF6(f) generated by Tg treatment (compare lanes 2 and 3). Upon Tg treatment, T645I remained largely as one band (Fig. 3C, lane 4). As in the case for wild type p90ATF6, treatment of T645I with Tu alone or Tu in combination with Tg resulted in the fully nonglycosylated form (Fig. 3D). To address further whether ATF(f) is formed by partial deglycosylation of full glycosylated p90ATF6 or de novo partial glycosylation of newly synthesized p90ATF6, CHX was used to inhibit protein synthesis in control and Tg-treated cells. As showed in Fig. 3E, Tg-induced formation of ATF6(f) was blocked by CHX pretreatment, suggesting that ATF6(f) represents de novo partial glycosylation of newly synthesized p90ATF6 rather than partial deglycosylation of fully glycosylated p90ATF6, which should not be affected by CHX treatment. T645I Mutation Results in a Higher Constitutive Rate of Transport to the Golgi—To examine the functional consequence of partial glycosylation of p90ATF6, we first compared the cellular distribution of the mutant and wild type protein through confocal microscopy. COS-7 cells were transfected with either HA-ATF6 (wild type) or T645I. In both cases, immunofluorescence of the HA tag showed that although the majority of both proteins were localized in the perinuclear region consistent of the ER, constitutive relocalization to the Golgi, as revealed by colocalization with a specific Golgi marker, could also be detected. Examples of HA-ATF6 scored as ER and Golgi staining in the transfected cells are shown in Fig. 4, A and B. In nonstressed cells, Golgi location was detected in about 2% of the cells transfected with wild type ATF6. Cells transfected with the T645I mutant showed about 5.5% of ATF6 localized in the Golgi, representing about a 2.5-fold increase compared with wild type ATF6 (Fig. 4C). Upon treatment with DTT, a potent UPR inducer used previously to demonstrate ATF6 relocalization to the Golgi (6Shen J. Chen X. Hendershot L. Prywes R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar), both wild type and the T645I mutant showed increased transit to the Golgi; by 30 min of DTT treatment, the difference between the mutant and the wild type protein was marginal (Fig. 4C). As expected, the relocalization of p90ATF6 from the ER to Golgi was suppressed substantially in cells treated with brefeldin A, which causes redistribution of the Golgi to the ER (Fig. 4D). CRT Association with ATF6 Is Sharply Reduced in the T645I Mutant—To examine possible contributing factors for the higher constitutive translocation to the Golgi for the T645I mutant, wild type HA-ATF6 or the T645I mutant was transfected into 293T cells, and microsome fractions were prepared. Coimmunoprecipitation followed by silver staining was used to identify protein partners that showed differential interaction between the wild type and mutant HA-ATF6 (Fig. 5A). Although the signal was weak, this approach yielded a candidate protein around 65 kDa that associated with the wild type ATF6 but was hardly detectable with the T645I mutant. The common band at 90 kDa was confirmed to be HA-ATF6 by Western blot, and the common band at 78 kDa showed electrophoretic mobility identical to that of GRP78 (Fig. 5A and data not shown). Although the amount of the p65 band was insufficient for direct sequencing, its electrophoretic mobility is similar to CRT, a 63-kDa Ca2+-binding protein that also serves as chaperone for glycoproteins in the ER lumen. To test directly the interaction between CRT and the two forms of p90ATF6, microsomal fractions were prepared from 293T cells that were transfected with either HA-ATF6 or T645I. Using anti-HA antibody as the immunoprecipitating antibody followed by Western blot with anti-CRT antibody, we observed a substantial decrease in the amount of CRT interacting with T645I compared with wild type ATF6 (Fig. 5B). Thus, CRT exhibits the same binding property as the 65 kDa band identified by silver staining. Reprobing the same filter with anti-HA antibody confirmed that equivalent amounts of wild type and mutant HA-ATF6 were immunoprecipitated. Further, Western blot analysis with microsome extracts confirmed that the endogenous level of CRT was also equivalent in cells expressing the wild type and the mutant ATF6 (Fig. 5B). The reduction in binding to CRT is specific because ATF6 binding to CNX, another ER chaperone with affinity for newly synthesized monomeric glycoproteins (18Bergeron J.J. Brenner M.B. Thomas D.Y.

https://openalex.org/W2061317143,"Integrin-mediated adhesion plays an important role in B cell development and activation. Signaling initiated by antigens, chemokines, or phorbol esters can rapidly convert integrins to an activated adhesion-competent state. The binding of integrins to their ligands can then induce actin-dependent cell spreading, which can facilitate cell-cell adhesion or cell migration on extracellular matrices. The signaling pathways involved in integrin activation and post-adhesion events in B cells are not completely understood. We have previously shown that anti-Ig antibodies, the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1; CXCL12), and phorbol esters activate the Rap1 and Rap2 GTPases in B cells and that Rap activation is essential for SDF-1-induced B cell migration (McLeod, S.

L., and Gold, M. R. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 41756–41767). We show here that preventing Rap activation by expressing Rap-specific GTPase-activating protein II (RapGAPII) significantly decreased lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1- and α4 integrin-dependent binding of murine B cell lines to purified adhesion molecules and to other cells. Conversely, augmenting Rap activation by expressing a constitutively active form of Rap2 enhanced B cell adhesion, showing for the first time that Rap2 can promote integrin activation. We also show that blocking Rap activation inhibited anti-Ig-induced cell spreading and phorbol ester-induced actin polymerization as well as anti-Ig- and SDF-1-induced phosphorylation of Pyk2, a tyrosine kinase involved in morphological changes and chemokine-induced B cell migration. Thus, the Rap GTPases regulate integrin-mediated B cell adhesion as well as processes that control B cell morphology and migration.

Integrin-mediated adhesion plays an important role in B lymphocyte maturation, trafficking, and activation. The major integrins on B cells are lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1 1The abbreviations used are: LFA-1, lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1; VLA-4, very late antigen-4; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; ECM, extracellular matrix; VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1; BCR, B cell antigen receptor; SDF-1, stromal cell-derived factor-1; RapGAPII, Rap-specific GTPase-activating protein II; PdBu, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RalGDS, Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; FAK, focal adhesion kinase. ; αLβ2 integrin), very late antigen-4 (VLA-4; α4β1 integrin), and α4β7 integrin. LFA-1 binds to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1; CD54) (1Harris E.S. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23409-23412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). VLA-4 and α4β7 integrin bind to the extracellular matrix (ECM) component fibronectin and to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1; CD106) (1Harris E.S. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A.

Rev. 2002; 186: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). During B cell development, VLA-4 on B cell progenitors binds to VCAM-1 on bone marrow stromal cells. This interaction plays an essential role in B cell development by retaining B cell precursors in the bone marrow, where they can receive survival signals and differentiation signals (3Miyake K. Weissman I.L. Greenberger J.S. Kincade P.W. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 4Arroyo A.G. Yang J.T. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O.

Med. 2001; 193: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Once a B cell exits the bone marrow, it must migrate into and within lymphoid organs to encounter antigens. The entry of B lymphocytes into the lymph nodes, Peyer's patches, bone marrow, and white pulp cords of the spleen involves adhesion mediated by the LFA-1, VLA-4, and α4β7 integrins (5Leuker C.E. Labow M. Muller W. Wagner N. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 6Berlin-Rufenach C. Otto F. Mathies M. Westermann J. Owen M.J. Hamann A. Hogg N. J. Exp.

Butcher E.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 807-814PubMed Google Scholar). These integrins allow B cells to bind to endothelial cells that line the blood vessels and then transmigrate across the endothelial cell layer into the lymphoid tissue. Once a B cell has bound antigen within the lymphoid organ, it must receive T cell help to become activated and to differentiate into an antibody-producing plasma cell. The cognate interaction between T helper cells and B cells is stabilized by multiple receptor-ligand interactions, including the binding of LFA-1 to ICAM-1 (9Dang L.H. Rock K.L. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3273-3279PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, germinal center B cells use both LFA-1 and VLA-4 to bind to follicular dendritic cells and receive survival signals (10Koopman G.

Meijer C.J. Pals S.T. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 1297-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Integrins on the surface of resting lymphocytes normally have low affinity and low avidity for their ligands. However, external stimuli such as chemokines and antigens generate intracellular signals that rapidly activate integrins, converting them to a clustered high affinity/high avidity state that can bind adhesion molecules on other cells or ECM components (1Harris E.S.

Immunol. Rev. 2002; 186: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The nature of this “inside-out” signaling that promotes integrin activation is not completely understood. Many signaling pathways contribute to integrin activation, including the pathways that involve phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein kinase C, Fyb/ADAP (adhesion and degranulation adaptor protein), and the Rho GTPase (12Laudanna C. Kim J.Y. Constantin G. Butcher E. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 186: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 13Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Irie S. Takatsu K. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell.

Rev. 2002; 186: 172-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Once activated, integrins can bind their ligands and initiate intracellular signaling pathways that regulate many aspects of cell behavior, including cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (16Miranti C.K. Brugge J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E83-E90Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The reorganization of a cell's actin cytoskeleton and the resulting morphological changes are important for many cellular processes, including cell-cell adhesion, cell motility, lymphocyte extravasation, and cell migration on an ECM substrate or across cell surfaces (17Brakebusch C. Fassler R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2324-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions are often accompanied by cell spreading, a flattening of the cell that increases the surface area of the contact region with other cells or the ECM, thereby allowing stronger adhesion. The Rap GTPases appear to play a key role in cell adhesion and post-adhesion events. In mammalian cells, there are four 23-kDa Rap proteins, Rap1A, Rap1B, Rap2A, and Rap2B, each encoded by a separate gene. The Rap1A and Rap1B proteins are 97% identical and assumed to be functionally equivalent. The same is true for Rap2A and Rap2B, which have 60% overall identity to the Rap1 proteins. Although the effector-binding regions of Rap1 and Rap2 are identical at eight of nine residues, it is not clear whether Rap1 and Rap2 have identical, overlapping, or distinct functions. Until recently, little was known about the function of the Rap proteins in mammalian cells. However, a number of reports have now shown that expressing constitutively active Rap1 promotes integrin activation in T cells and myeloid cells, whereas blocking the activation of endogenous Rap GTPases prevents receptor-induced integrin activation (13Katagiri K.

Moreover, in Dictyostelium discoideum and Drosophila melanogaster, orthologs of the mammalian Rap1 GTPase regulate cell morphology, actin polymerization, and cell migration (27Rebstein P.J.

In B cells, integrin-dependent adhesion, actin polymerization, and cell spreading can be induced by antigens and anti-Ig antibodies that cluster the B cell antigen receptor (BCR), by chemokines such as stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), and by phorbol esters (30Postigo A.A.

In this study, we investigated whether Rap activation mediates the effects of anti-Ig antibodies, SDF-1, and phorbol esters on integrin-dependent adhesion, cell spreading, and actin polymerization in B cells, processes that are important for chemokine-induced migration and for chemokine- or antigen-induced B cell adhesion. We show that activation of endogenous Rap in B cells is important for these stimuli to induce LFA-1- and α4 integrin-dependent adhesion. Moreover, by expressing a constitutively active form of Rap2, we show for the first time that Rap2 can promote integrin-dependent adhesion. We also show that Rap activation in B cells is important for cell spreading, actin polymerization, and the phosphorylation of Pyk2, a tyrosine kinase involved in regulating cell morphology as well as chemokine-induced B cell migration. Cell Culture—The A20 and WEHI-231 murine B cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The M2-10B4 murine bone marrow stromal cell line (39Lemoine F.M. Dedhar S.

All cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm pyruvate, 15 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (complete medium). Expression of RapGAPII and Rap2V12 in B Cell Lines—cDNAs encoding FLAG-tagged RapGAPII or Rap2V12 in the pMSCVpuro vector (Clontech) were gifts from Dr. Michiyuki Matsuda (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). A20 cell clones stably expressing RapGAPII, Rap2V12, or the empty pMSCVpuro vector were generated by electroporation (41Christian S.L. Lee R.L. McLeod S.J. Burgess A.E. Li A.H.Y. Dang-Lawson M.

All experiments were performed using RapGAPII-expressing A20 clone 16, and the results were confirmed using clone 3. The Rap2V12-expressing A20 cells were an oligoclonal bulk population that was not subjected to single cell cloning. Bulk populations of WEHI-231 cells stably expressing RapGAPII, Rap2V12, or the empty pMSCVpuro vector were generated by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer (42Krebs D.L. Yang Y. Dang M. Haussmann J.

The expression of FLAG-RapGAPII or FLAG-Rap2V12 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma). Rap Activation Assays—Cells were resuspended at 2 × 107/ml in 0.5 ml of modified HEPES-buffered saline (43Ingham R.J. Santos L. Dang-Lawson M. Holgado-Madruga M. Dudek P. Maroun C.R. Wong A.J.

The cells were solubilized by adding an equal volume of Rap lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Igepal (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm Na3VO4) to the cell suspension and then removing insoluble material by centrifugation. Rap activation assays were performed as described previously (37McLeod S.J. Ingham R.J. Bos J.L. Kurosaki T. Gold M.R. J. Biol.

Briefly, a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the Rap1/2-binding domain of the RalGDS protein (GST-RalGDS) was used to selectively precipitate the active GTP-bound forms of Rap1 and Rap2, which were then detected by sequential immunoblotting with antibodies to Rap2 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) and Rap1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Flow Cytometry—To analyze the cell-surface expression of the LFA-1 and α4 integrins, cells were stained with 30 μg/ml rat anti-mouse LFA-1 monoclonal antibody TIB-213 (FD441.8; American Type Culture Collection) (44Sanchez-Madrid F.

The VCAM-1-Fc fusion protein was produced in COS cells and purified from the culture supernatant by protein A affinity chromatography. The plasmid encoding the VCAM-1-Fc fusion protein was constructed as follows. cDNA encoding domains 1–3 of murine VCAM-1 was generated by reverse transcription-PCR using RNA from the murine endothelial cell line ENDO-D1. After sequencing, the PCR product was subcloned into the Fc fusion vector pIG, which carries the genomic fragment encoding the hinge and constant regions of human IgG1 (46Fawcett J. Holness C.L. Needham L.A. Turley H. Gatter K.C. Mason D.Y. Simmons D.L. Nature. 1992; 360: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Adhesion Assays Using Immobilized ICAM-1 or VCAM-1—Adhesion assays were performed using a modification of the method described by Welder et al. (45Welder C.A. Lee D.H. Takei F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2203-2210PubMed Google Scholar). Nunc Maxisorp 96-well plates were coated at room temperature for 60–90 min with either soluble ICAM-1 or VCAM-1-Fc (30 μg/ml) diluted in 0.1 m carbonate buffer (pH 9.6). The wells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and blocked with 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature. A20 cells were resuspended at 1.25 × 106/ml in Hanks' buffered saline solution with 2% fetal calf serum (binding buffer) and stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma) or anti-IgG antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) for 25 min at 37 °C. The cells were then pelleted, resuspended at 1.25 × 106/ml in binding buffer containing 10 μg/ml 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. When the cells were stimulated with SDF-1, they were stained with 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate prior to being stimulated with SDF-1 for 20 min. After being labeled and stimulated, the cells were pelleted and resuspended at the same concentration in binding buffer, except for cells to be treated with neutralizing antibody to either LFA-1 or α4 integrins. These cells were resuspended at 1.25 × 107/ml in 50 μl of binding buffer containing 50 μg/ml anti-LFA-1 monoclonal antibody TIB-213 or anti-α4 integrin monoclonal antibody PS/2, incubated for 5 min at room temperature, and diluted to 1.25 × 106/ml in binding buffer. For each sample, 1.25 × 105 cells in 0.1 ml of binding buffer was added to triplicate wells of the soluble ICAM-1- or VCAM-1-Fc-coated 96-well plate. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 25 min, and the total fluorescent signal (excitation at 485 nm and emission at 530 nm) from each well was measured using a Bio-Tek FL600 microplate fluorescence reader (Bio-Tek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT). The wells were then washed manually five to six times with 37 °C binding buffer to remove non-adhering cells, and the fluorescent signal from each well was measured again. Data are represented as the percent of cells that remained adhered after washing. This was calculated by dividing the post-wash fluorescence (remaining adhered cells) by the pre-wash fluorescence (total input cells) for each well. Cell-Cell Adhesion Assays—To assess the homotypic aggregation of WEHI-231 cells, 2 × 106 cells were resuspended in 2 ml of complete medium and added to each well of a 6-well plate. The cells were incubated with 2 nm PdBu in the presence or absence of 30 μg/ml anti-LFA-1 monoclonal antibody TIB-213 for 16 h at 37 °C and then photographed. The number of single cells and aggregates, as well as the number of cells per aggregate, was determined for several random fields. To assess the adhesion of A20 cells to the M2-10B4 bone marrow stromal cell line, A20 cells (2 × 106 in 1 ml of complete medium) were plated on a 75% confluent monolayer of M2-10B4 cells in a 6-well plate. Where indicated, 30 μg/ml anti-α4 integrin monoclonal antibody PS/2 or 10 μg/ml rabbit anti-CXCR4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the medium. The A20 cells were allowed to adhere for 4–5 h before washing the wells twice with complete medium and then photographing the remaining cells. The number of A20 cells adhering to the M2-10B4 cells was determined by counting random fields of cells. Cell Spreading Assays—A20 cells (7.5 × 105 cells in 1.5 ml of complete medium) were added to each well of a 6-well tissue culture plate and cultured with or without 10 μg/ml goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies. The cells were allowed to adhere and spread overnight at 37 °C and then were observed by light microscopy. For each well, three different observers each determined the number of spread cells in three random fields containing ∼300 cells each. In addition, the cells were photographed using a camera system attached to an Olympus IX70 microscope. Cells that had a flattened morphology or were phase-dark were scored as spread. Actin Polymerization Assays—The amount of polymerized F-actin was analyzed on a single cell basis by flow cytometry essentially as described by Bleul et al. (47Bleul C.C. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Casasnovas J.M. Aiuti A. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Single cell suspensions of A20 cells (4 × 105 cells in 0.4 ml of modified HEPES-buffered saline) were added to polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes and stimulated with 15 nm PMA for various times at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 9% formaldehyde, 2 μg/ml FITC-phalloidin (Sigma), and 0.25 mg/ml lysophosphatidylcholine (Sigma). After 10 min at 37 °C, the mean fluorescence intensity was determined using a FACScan flow cytometer and taken as a measure of the amount of polymerized F-actin. Where indicated, the cells were incubated with rat anti-mouse LFA-1 monoclonal antibody TIB-213 (30 μg/ml final concentration) for 30 min at 37 °C before being stimulated with PMA. Pyk2 Tyrosine Phosphorylation—Where indicated, 6-well tissue culture plates were coated with a collagen/fibronectin ECM (48Freundlich B. Avdalovic N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 62: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The collagen/fibronectin ECM was prepared by adding 1.5 ml of a 2% gelatin solution (type B from bovine skin, Sigma) to each well of the plate and then incubating the plate overnight at 37 °C. The next morning, the gelatin was aspirated; 1.5 ml of fetal calf serum was added to each well; and after incubating the plate at 37 °C for 1 h, the wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Vector control and RapGAPII-expressing A20 cells (5 × 106 cells in 1 ml of modified HEPES-buffered saline) were added to wells that had been either left untreated or coated with the collagen/fibronectin ECM. After 20 min at 37 °C, the cells were stimulated with goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies or SDF-1. Reactions were terminated by adding 0.25 ml of cold 5× lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 5% Triton X-100, 140 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm Na2MoO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin). The cell extracts were placed on ice for 10 min and then centrifuged for 15 min in the cold to remove insoluble material. The cell extracts were mixed with 1 μg of goat anti-Pyk2 antibody (sc-1514, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C and then transferred to tubes containing 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) for 1 h. Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The filters were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 (Upstate Inc., Charlottesville, VA) or with antibody that recognizes Pyk2 phosphorylated at either Tyr579 or Tyr580 (BioSource International, Camarillo, CA). The filters were then reprobed with goat anti-mouse Pyk2 antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Rap Activation Regulates Integrin-mediated B Cell Adhesion to ICAM-1 and VCAM-1—In B cells, integrin activation and the subsequent integrin-mediated adhesion mediate many important processes and can be stimulated by phorbol esters, antigens, anti-Ig antibodies, and chemokines such as SDF-1. To investigate the role of Rap activation in cell adhesion, cell spreading, and actin polymerization in B cells, we blocked the activation of endogenous Rap1 and Rap2 by expressing a Rap-specific GTPase-activating protein, RapGAPII, in A20 murine B lymphoma cells (41Christian S.L. Lee R.L. McLeod S.J. Burgess A.E. Li A.H.Y. Dang-Lawson M. Lin K.B.L. Gold M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41756-41767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). RapGAPII promotes the conversion of active GTP-bound Rap1 and Rap2 to the inactive GDP-bound forms while having no effect on the activation of other GTPases, including Ha-Ras (49Mochizuki N. Ohba Y.

Using a Rap activation assay in which a GST-RalGDS fusion protein is used to selectively precipitate the active GTP-bound forms of Rap1 and Rap2, we have shown that RapGAPII expression significantly inhibited the ability of phorbol esters (Fig. 1A), anti-Ig antibodies (41Christ"
https://openalex.org/W2011906109,"The transcription factor STAT3 is most important for the signal transduction of interleukin-6 and related cytokines. Upon stimulation cytoplasmic STAT3 is phosphorylated at tyrosine 705, translocates into the nucleus, and induces target genes. Notably, STAT proteins are also detectable in the nuclei of unstimulated cells. In this report we introduce a new method for the real time analysis of STAT3 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling in living cells which is based on the recently established fluorescence localization after photobleaching (FLAP) approach. STAT3 was C-terminally fused with the cyan (CFP) and yellow (YFP) variants of the green fluorescent protein. In the resulting STAT3-CFP-YFP (STAT3-CY) fusion protein the YFP can be selectively bleached using the 514-nm laser of a confocal microscope. This setting allows studies on the dynamics of STAT3 nucleocytoplasmic transport by monitoring the subcellular distribution of fluorescently labeled and selectively bleached STAT3-CY. By this means we demonstrate that STAT3-CY shuttles continuously between the cytosol and the nucleus in unstimulated cells. This constitutive shuttling does not depend on the phosphorylation of tyrosine 705 because a STAT3(Y705F)-CY mutant shuttles to the same extent as STAT3-CY. Experiments with deletion mutants reveal that the N-terminal moiety of STAT3 is essential for shuttling. Further studies suggest that a decrease in STAT3 nuclear export contributes to the nuclear accumulation of STAT3 in response to cytokine stimulation. The new approach presented in this study is generally applicable to any protein of interest for analyzing nucleocytoplasmic transport mechanisms in real time.

In particular, the family members of the α-helix bundle cytokines comprising the hematopoietins and interferons exert their biological effects by the activation of STAT transcription factors (for review, see Ref. 1Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2501) Google Scholar). According to the canonical model (2Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Huang L.H. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar), signaling through the Janus kinase/STAT pathway is triggered by the binding of a cytokine to class I or class II cytokine receptors which leads to the activation of receptor-associated tyrosine kinases of the Janus kinase family. The activated Janus kinases phosphorylate the receptor on tyrosine residues followed by the recruitment of STAT monomers to these phosphorylated tyrosine motifs. While bound to the receptor, STATs are phosphorylated at a single tyrosine residue and subsequently form dimers by intermolecular phosphotyrosine-SH2 domain interactions. The STAT dimers freely diffuse through the cytosol (3Lillemeier B.F. Köster M. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2508-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), associate with importin-α (4Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), and translocate via the nuclear pore complexes to the nuclear compartment to transactivate target genes. This canonical model has been challenged by accumulating data suggesting that STATs dimerize prior to activation. The preformation of STAT dimers seems to be independent of tyrosine phosphorylation (5Stancato L.F. David M. Carter-Su C. Larner A.C. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

Furthermore, recent observations from several laboratories suggest that a subpopulation of STAT proteins is located in the nucleus of unstimulated cells (8Haan S. Kortylewski M. Behrmann I.

The latter finding is either the result of a static subcellular distribution or a continuous dynamic shuttling of STAT molecules between the cytosol and the nucleus. STAT3 is one of the seven mammalian STAT proteins. It acts as a signal transducer for many cytokines and growth factors (16Levy D.E. Lee C.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1143-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar) and is of particular importance for the family of IL-6-type cytokines (17Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Haan S. Hermanns H.M. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2518) Google Scholar). STAT3 participates in a variety of biological processes such as the induction of acute phase protein synthesis in hepatocytes (18Wegenka U.M. Buschmann J. Lütticken C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), the regulation of hematopoiesis and the immune response (16Levy D.E. Lee C.K. J. Clin.

As a consequence of these diverse functions, STAT3 plays a crucial role in inflammatory, autoimmune, and certain neoplastic diseases (24Schindler C.W. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1133-1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice having a targeted deletion of STAT3 die early during embryonic development (22Takeda K. Noguchi K. Shi W. Tanaka T. Matsumoto M. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3801-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). STAT proteins consist of six domains: an N-terminal domain involved in cooperative DNA binding, a coiled coil domain, a DNA binding domain, a linker domain, an SH2 domain, and a C-terminal transactivation domain. The structure of a truncated, tyrosine-phosphorylated, dimeric STAT3 bound to DNA has been solved by x-ray crystallography (25Becker S. Groner B. Müller C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). The dimerization of STAT3 molecules is enforced by reciprocal binding of the phosphotyrosine-containing regions to the SH2 domains, which is a prerequisite for nuclear accumulation and DNA binding of STAT3. The activity of the C-terminal transactivation domain is modulated by phosphorylation at serine 727 (26Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2628-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The major part of the data concerning the nucleocytoplasmic transport mechanisms of STAT proteins was obtained for STAT1 (27McBride K.M. Reich N.C. Science's STKE. 2003; http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2003/195/re13PubMed Google Scholar) and STAT5 (12Zeng R. Aoki Y. Yoshida M. Arai K. Watanabe S. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 5138-5145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Only recently, some reports concentrated on the structural requirements for the nuclear translocation of STAT3. Several amino acid residues in the coiled coil domain and DNA binding domain were identified to be essential for nuclear translocation of STAT3 (29Ma J. Zhang T. Novotny-Diermayr V. Tan A.L. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29252-29260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Furthermore, three export signals were defined in the C-terminal part of the coiled coil domain, the DNA binding domain, and the linker domain (15Bhattacharya S. Schindler C. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we focus on the nuclear translocation of STAT3 in unstimulated as well as in IL-6-stimulated HepG2 cells. We established a novel real time method for the analysis of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling in living cells which is based on the recently described FLAP (fluorescence localization after photobleaching) approach (30Dunn G.A. Dobbie I.M. Monypenny J. Holt M.R. Zicha D. J Microsc. 2002; 205: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 31Zicha D. Dobbie I.M. Holt M.R. Monypenny J. Soong D.Y. Gray C. Dunn G.A. Science. 2003; 300: 142-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Our application involves a fluorescent fusion protein consisting of STAT3 connected to two independent fluorophores (STAT3-CFP-YFP) combined with pulse bleach techniques. The new method allowed us to investigate the dynamics of the nucleocytoplasmic transport of STAT3 by monitoring the general subcellular distribution of fluorescently labeled STAT3 and synchronous tracing a selectively bleached subpopulation. Applying this novel approach we found that (i) STAT3 constitutively shuttles between the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments in unstimulated cells; (ii) constitutive shuttling of STAT3 is independent of tyrosine phosphorylation; (iii) balanced shuttling of STAT3 requires the interplay of export and import signals; and (iv) reduced nuclear export contributes to IL-6-induced nuclear accumulation of STAT3. All experiments were carried out using the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 and the simian monkey kidney cell line COS7 (both purchased from ATCC, Rockville, MD). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 1:1 mix with 15 mm Hepes and l-glutamine (Cambrex Corp., East Rutherford, NJ) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum was employed for culturing of HepG2 cells, whereas COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax-I (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum. For starvation conditions cells were cultured in pure serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax-I, sodium pyruvate, 4.5 g/liter glucose, and pyridoxine (Invitrogen). Transient transfection of plasmids into HepG2 cells was performed by using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. COS7 cells were transiently transfected utilizing the DEAE-dextran method. pSVL-STAT3-CY was cloned on the basis of pSVLΔEcoRI gp130-ET-CFP-YFP and pSVLΔEcoRI STAT3-YFP (32Herrmann A. Sommer U. Pranada A.L. Giese B. Küster A. Haan S. Becker W. Heinrich P.C. Müller-Newen G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These plasmids encode fluorescent fusion proteins that consist of the N-terminal signal protein STAT3 or gp130 and the C-terminal fluorescent YFP or CFP-YFP tag, respectively. All of these plasmids contain a single XhoI and a single BstEII restriction site. The XhoI site is located in the multiple cloning site upstream of the start codon. The BstEII site connects the STAT3 or gp130 encoding part with the part that encodes the fluorescent tag. Thus, the basic plasmids were cut by using the restriction enzymes XhoI and BstEII (Roche Applied Science). Afterwards the fragment encoding STAT3 was ligated into the pSVLΔEcoRI vector that included the DNA sequence for the CFP-YFP tag. Cloning of STAT3(1–320)-CY—A fragment corresponding to amino acids 113–320 of STAT3 was amplified by PCR introducing a BstEII site with the antisense primer (5′-cggtgaccag gcactcttca ttaagtttct g-3′). After cloning into the TOPO-vector (Invitrogen) the DNA was sequenced. The verified plasmid was digested with XbaI (Roche Applied Science) and BstEII and cloned into pSVL-STAT3-CY cut with the same enzymes. Cloning of STAT3(321–771)-CY—A fragment encoding amino acids 321–610 of STAT3 was generated by PCR introducing an XhoI site and a start codon with the sense primer (5′-ctcgagatgt tcgtggtgga gcggcag-3′). The product was analyzed as described above, cut with XhoI and XmaI (New England BioLabs), and cloned into pSVL-STAT3-CY digested with the same enzymes. Cloning of STAT3(Y705F)-CY—Using pCAG GS Neo HA STAT3(Y705F) (33Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) as a template, a fragment corresponding to amino acids 596–771 of STAT3(Y705F) was created by PCR introducing a BstEII site at the C terminus with the antisense primer (5′-gtgtgaggtg accacatggg ggaggt-3′). The product was analyzed as described above, digested with XmaI and BstEII, and ligated into pSVL-STAT3-CY cut with the same enzymes. Antibodies against STAT3 (BD Biosciences), phosphorylated STAT3 (Sigma), and GFP (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA) were used for immunoprecipitation (3 μl/ml lysate) and for Western blot analysis (1:1,000 dilution). Secondary antibodies were purchased from DAKO (Hamburg, Germany). HepG2 cells were cultured on 10-ml dishes, starved for 16 h, stimulated with 20 ng/ml recombinant human IL-6 for the indicated periods of time, and lysed by treatment with radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0,5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 15% glycerol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0,25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were incubated with the respective specific antibody for 16 h at 4 °C, which was previously immobilized to protein A-Sepharose for immunoprecipitation. After two washing steps with ice-cold lysis buffer the proteins were eluted with 4× Laemmli buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and subsequently transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by semidry blot technique. For detection the membrane was blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin in TBS-N (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0,1% Nonidet P-40) for 1 h, rinsed three times with TBS-N, incubated with the appropriate antibody (1:1,000 dilution in TBS-N) for 16 h at 4 °C, washed twice with TBS-N for 10 min, treated with a suitable horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2,000 dilution) for 30 min, again washed twice with TBS-N for 10 min, and finally exposed to enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) followed by fluorography. The membrane was stripped in stripping buffer (2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 78 μlof β-mercaptoethanol/10 ml) for 35 min at 70 °C, washed twice with TBS-N for 10 min, and treated with the primary and secondary antibodies as indicated in the figure. HepG2 cells were cultured on 6-well plates (9.6 cm2/well), transiently transfected with pGL3 α2 M Luc (luciferase construct with α2-macro-globulin promoter), pCR™3 LacZ (galactosidase construct with a constitutively active promoter) (Amersham Biosciences) and the indicated plasmid by using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), starved with serum-free medium for 16 h, and stimulated with 20 ng/ml IL-6 for 16 h. The preparation of the lysates and the luciferase measurements were carried out according to the instructions that were supplied with the luciferase kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activity values were normalized to the transfection efficiency that was measured as β-galactosidase activity. The experiments were done in triplicate, and the mean ± S.D. values were calculated. The imaging and bleaching studies were performed by using a Zeiss LSM 510 (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with an argon and a helium-neon laser, a 63× water-corrected objective, and a perfusion chamber (manufactured in house) in which living adherent cells could be studied microscopically. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmid and grown on glass coverslips for later transfer to the perfusion chamber. Prior to the experiments the cells were starved for 16 h. The perfusion chamber was loaded with the coverslip and filled with cell culture medium. A constant temperature of 37 °C was maintained by a thermostat. For real time imaging studies cyan fluorescence was excited at λ = 458 nm and detected by using a bandpass filter BP 470–490. Yellow fluorescence was excited at λ = 514 nm and a bandpass filter BP 530-600 was used. The experiments were carried out by stimulation with 20 ng/ml IL-6 at time point 0, and thereafter pictures were taken every 30 s or at the indicated time points.

In terms of studying transport processes it is helpful to label a population of fluorescent signal proteins using a bleaching approach as done in fluorescence loss in photobleaching experiments (34Lippincott-Schwartz J. Snapp E. Kenworthy A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 444-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). The problem with fluorescent fusion proteins containing a single fluorophore is that as soon as bleaching has been performed it is impossible to follow their concentration because they have lost their fluorescence. To overcome this problem, the protein of interest can be fused to two distinct fluorophores as in the recently described FLAP method (30Dunn G.A. Dobbie I.M. Monypenny J. Holt M.R. Zicha D. J Microsc. 2002; 205: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 31Zicha D. Dobbie I.M. Holt M.R. Monypenny J. Soong D.Y. Gray C. Dunn G.A. Science. 2003; 300: 142-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). As a modification of this approach, we have constructed a STAT3-CFP-YFP fusion protein (STAT3-CY) as a functional variant of STAT3 with two different fluorescent tags (Fig. 1A). The STAT3 part consisting of 771 amino acids is identical with wild type murine STAT3α. A linker of 3 amino acids connects STAT3 with the C-terminal fluorophores CFP and YFP. For further studies, we have generated three STAT3 variants as CFP-YFP fusion proteins. In STAT3(Y705F)-CY tyrosine 705 has been mutated to phenylalanine. STAT3(1–320)-CY contains the N-terminal moiety, STAT3(321–771)-CY the C-terminal moiety of STAT3 (Fig. 1A). COS7 cells were transfected with STAT3, STAT3-CY, or the deletion mutants. After lysis of stimulated and unstimulated cells immunoprecipitations were performed with a GFP antibody that also recognizes YFP and CFP. Subsequently, the recombinant proteins were detected in Western blot with the GFP antibody (Fig. 1B, top panel). The mobilities of the fusion proteins in SDS-PAGE correspond well with the calculated molecular masses of 149, 93, and 110 kDa for STAT3-CY, STAT3(1–320)-CY, and STAT3(321–771)-CY, respectively. As expected, an antibody directed against an N-terminal epitope of STAT3 recognizes STAT3-CY and STAT3(1–320)-CY but not STAT3(321–771)-CY (Fig. 1B, middle panel). Tyrosine phosphorylation in response to cytokine stimulation is observed only for STAT3-CY and not for the deletion mutants (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). An unspecific band appears in all lanes at the position of STAT3-CY. Nevertheless, stimulation-induced phosphorylation of STAT3-CY is clearly detectable. Nontagged STAT3 is not detected because it has not been precipitated by the GFP antibody. The following experiments were carried out to demonstrate that STAT3-CY is as functional as wild type STAT3 with respect to transactivation and nuclear translocation. The transactivation capability of STAT3-CY was tested in a reporter gene assay (Fig. 1C). IL-6 stimulation of mock-transfected HepG2 cells leads to a pronounced induction of the α2-macroglobulin promoter mediated by endogenous STAT3. A significantly enhanced induction was observed in cells transfected with wild type STAT3. Transfection of HepG2 cells with the fluorescent constructs STAT3-YFP and STAT3-CY led to results similar to those shown for wild type STAT3. Real time imaging studies with IL-6-stimulated HepG2 cells that were transfected with STAT3-CY (Fig. 2A) demonstrate identical kinetics with regard to nuclear translocation as observed in studies with wild type STAT3 and single-tagged STAT3-YFP (32Herrmann A. Sommer U. Pranada A.L. Giese B. Küster A. Haan S. Becker W. Heinrich P.C. Müller-Newen G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The highest concentrations of fluorescent STAT3 within the nucleus were found between 15 and 40 min after IL-6 stimulation. From these findings we conclude that the fluorescent tags do not interfere with the basic functions of STAT3. IL-6 stimulation did not affect the subcellular distribution of STAT3(Y705F)-CY (Fig. 2B) or the deletion mutants (not shown). In unstimulated cells the distribution of STAT3 (Y705F)-CY was indistinguishable from STAT3-CY. Notably, the subcellular distributions of the two deletion mutants differed markedly. Whereas STAT3(1–320)-CY was almost equally distributed between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, STAT3(321–771)-CY was largely excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 2C). The YFP Fluorophore in STAT3-CY Can Be Bleached Selectively—STAT3-CY was designed to have two independent fluorophores that can be bleached selectively. The yellow fluorescent fluorophore is bleached efficiently and selectively using intense laser light at a wavelength of 514 nm. According to the excitation spectrum of CFP the cyan fluorophore should not be affected. This prediction has been tested by bleaching STAT3-CY nuclear foci that are often formed upon IL-6 stimulation of transfected HepG2 cells (Fig. 2, A and D). The formation of these subnuclear structures can also be observed in the case of wild type STAT3 and single-tagged STAT3-YFP (32Herrmann A. Sommer U. Pranada A.L. Giese B. Küster A. Haan S. Becker W. Heinrich P.C. Müller-Newen G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Application of a 514-nm laser pulse to a single dot (Fig. 2D, upper panels, arrows) by using the laser of the confocal microscope leads to a strong decrease in YFP fluorescence, whereas CFP fluorescence remains largely unaffected (Fig. 2D, lower panels, arrows). The selective bleaching of YFP enabled marking of a subpopulation of STAT3-CY and following its fate by determining the ratio of YFP to CFP fluorescence. Fig. 3A shows a general setup of the pulse bleach experiments in which we studied the nuclear import and export processes of STAT3-CY in living cells. For this purpose one “bleach ROI” and three “detection ROIs” were defined. Within the area of the bleach ROI the YFP moiety of STAT3-CY can be bleached with 514-nm laser pulses. The detection ROIs monitored cytosolic, nuclear, and background fluorescence intensities. In the following figures the data are presented in diagrams that show background-corrected fluorescence intensities of CFP and YFP within the indicated cytosolic or nuclear ROIs. A Dynamic Equilibrium between Nuclear Import and Export Results in Constant Subcellular Concentrations of STAT3-CY in Unstimulated Cells—Fig. 3A and the first image in Fig. 2A show the subcellular distribution of STAT3-CY in unstimulated HepG2 cells. Interestingly, STAT3-CY is detectable within the nucleus. Monitoring of fluorescence intensities within the cytosolic and nuclear detection ROIs without any bleaching proves that subcellular concentrations of STAT3-CY remain constant in unstimulated cells for at least 20 min (Fig. 3B. Slight intensity variations are caused by random cellular movements, small shifts in the focus plane, or little bleaching because of data recording. We asked whether the observed constant subcellular distribution of STAT3-CY is caused by the lack of any transport between cytosol and nucleus or whether it is a result of a dynamic equilibrium between nuclear import and export processes. For this reason we examined the nuclear transport process by pulse bleach experiments. In addition to the three detection ROIs, a bleach ROI was defined in the cytosol as outlined above. Yellow and cyan fluorescence intensities in the cytosol and the nucleus were measured for 20 min. At time point 30 s a strong bleach pulse at a wavelength of 514 nm was a"
https://openalex.org/W2061941384,"The ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) mediates the efflux of cellular unesterified cholesterol and phospholipid to lipid-poor apolipoprotein A-I. Chymase, a protease secreted by mast cells, selectively cleaves pre-beta-migrating particles from high density lipoprotein (HDL)(3) and reduces the efflux of cholesterol from macrophages. To evaluate whether this effect is the result of reduction of ABCA1-dependent or -independent pathways of cholesterol efflux, in this study we examined the efflux of cholesterol to preparations of chymase-treated HDL(3) in two types of cell: 1) in J774 murine macrophages endogenously expressing low levels of scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI), and high levels of ABCA1 upon treatment with cAMP; and 2) in Fu5AH rat hepatoma cells endogenously expressing high levels of the SR-BI and low levels of ABCA1. Treatment of HDL(3) with the human chymase resulted in rapid depletion of pre-beta-HDL and a concomitant decrease in the efflux of cholesterol and phospholipid (2-fold and 3-fold, respectively) from the ABCA1-expressing J774 cells. In contrast, efflux of free cholesterol from Fu5AH to chymase-treated and to untreated HDL(3) was similar. Incubation of HDL(3) with phospholipid transfer protein led to an increase in pre-beta-HDL contents as well as in ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux. A decreased cholesterol efflux to untreated HDL(3) but not to chymase-treated HDL(3) was observed in ABCA1-expressing J774 with probucol, an inhibitor of cholesterol efflux to lipid-poor apoA-I. Similar results were obtained using brefeldin and gliburide, two inhibitors of ABCA1-mediated efflux. These results indicate that chymase treatment of HDL(3) specifically impairs the ABCA1-dependent pathway without influencing either aqueous or SR-BI-facilitated diffusion and that this effect is caused by depletion of lipid-poor pre-beta-migrating particles in HDL(3). Our results are compatible with the view that HDL(3) promotes ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux entirely through its lipid-poor fraction with pre-beta mobility."

We conclude that hDlg may be a determinant in E-cadherin-mediated adhesion and signaling in mammalian epithelial cells. Cadherins mediate cell-cell adhesion through homotypic, calcium-dependent interactions involving their extracellular domains. Classical cadherins have highly conserved cytoplasmic domains that bind α-catenin, β-catenin, and plakoglobin (1Vleminckx K. Kemler R. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). These complexes link actin microfilaments and other integral membrane proteins, allowing the formation of junctional complexes, the organization of the actin cytoskeleton at junctional complexes, the establishment of membrane domains, and the modulation of signal transduction pathways (1Vleminckx K.

In intestinal epithelium renewal, E-cadherin plays a crucial role in the coordination between cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and death. Indeed, expression of a dominant-negative N/E-cadherin in villus enterocytes results in the disruption of cell-cell junctions associated with increased epithelial cell migration, alteration of the differentiated phenotype, and increased apoptosis (4Hermiston M.L. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of this transgene in the crypt compartment leads to overproliferation (5Hermiston M.L. Gordon J.I. Science. 1995; 270: 1203-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contact regulates intestinal epithelium homeostasis remain largely undefined.

This activation is required for the association of adherens junction components with the cytoskeleton, thereby inducing morphological and functional differentiation. Indeed, following PI3K inhibition, intestinal epithelial cells exhibit a less cylindrical phenotype, a significant alteration of actin architecture, and a very poorly defined apical junction complex but without any change in E-cadherin localization (3Laprise P.

Therefore, the recruitment of PI3K to sites of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contact appears to be a critical step in initiating the induction of adherens junction formation and in differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells. The mechanisms involved in PI3K recruitment to E-cadherin adhesion complex remain to be elucidated. Members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase-like protein family contribute to proper junction formation and cell polarity (6Caruana G. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 46: 511-518PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the membrane-associated guanylate kinase-like protein DLG-1, a Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of the Drosophila disc-large tumor suppressor (Dlg), is required for the proper assembly and function of adherens junctions (7Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 451-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 8Woods D.F. Hough C. Peel D. Callaini G. Bryant P.J. J.

Indeed, Firestein and Rongo (9Firestein B.L. Rongo C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3465-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) have shown recently that DLG-1 is predominantly localized at the adherens junctions of the epidermis, intestine, and pharynx of embryos and adult nematodes. DLG-1-deficient embryos exhibited abnormal adherens junction formation and disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton without any change in E-cadherin localization (9Firestein B.L. Rongo C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3465-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Moreover, human Dlg (hDlg) contains many protein-protein interaction domains, including three PDZ (PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1) domains, an SH3 domain, a GUK domain, and alternatively spliced insertions (10Lue R.A.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a role for hDlg in the regulation of cadherin-mediated adhesion in human intestinal cells. Although a functional role of Dlg/DLG-1 has been suggested in adherens junction formation (7Woods D.F. Bryant P.J.

Cell. 2001; 12: 3465-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), there is currently no evidence supporting this hypothesis in a mammalian system. In the present study, the role and regulation of hDlg in mammalian epithelial cells are investigated. We demonstrate that human intestinal epithelial cells express several forms of hDlg whose changes in phosphorylation state correlate with the initiation of differentiation. Moreover, by using an RNA interference approach, hDlg is shown to be necessary for adherens junction integrity and for functional differentiation of human intestinal epithelial cells. Finally, hDlg is shown to bind to p85/PI3K and that both proteins are part of a common macromolecular complex with E-cadherin at the site of cell-cell contact. Antibodies—Anti-hDlg used for immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation, anti-ERK-1, and anti-GST were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). hDlg was detected by Western blot using anti-NAG antibody (13McLaughlin M.

Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Segments of fetal small intestine and fully differentiated Caco-2/15 cells (30 days post-confluence) were embedded in optimum cutting temperature compound and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections of 3 μm were spread onto silane-coated glass slides and air-dried. Sections or PBS-washed Caco-2/15 cell cultures, grown on Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL), were fixed with methanol/acetone (30–70%) for 15 min at –20 °C and blocked with PBS/bovine serum albumin 2% (20 min at room temperature). Samples were immunostained for 1 h with primary antibody and 30 min with secondary antibody. For F-actin staining, fixed cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml FITC-phalloidin for 30 min. Negative controls (no primary antibody) were included in all experiments.

Segments were then incubated under agitation with ice-cold isolation buffer (2.5 mm EDTA and 0.25 mm NaCl) for 2 min. After each interval, cell suspensions were centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min. Pellets were then washed with ice-cold KRB buffer and lysed in chilled Triton lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm orthovanadate, and 40 mm β-glycerophosphate). Crypt or villus origin of the various cell fractions was determined by evaluation of the activities of several brush border enzymes. The specific activity (units/mg of protein) of alkaline phosphatase (114.10 units/mg in crypt cell preparations; 323.13 units/mg in villus cell preparations), threalase (0.04 units/mg in crypt cell preparations; 0.32 units/mg in villus cell preparations), and sucrase-isomaltase (0.08 units/mg in crypt cell preparations; 0.17 units/mg in villus cell preparations) was measured as described previously (16Ménard D.

Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—These analyses were performed as described previously (3Laprise P. Chailler P. Houde M. Beaulieu J.F. Boucher M.J. Rivard N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8226-8234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). RT-PCR Analysis—RNA was purified from cultured cells with the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). The reactions were performed on 1.3–2 μg of purified RNA using the Advantage RT-PCR kit from BD Biosciences Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Aliquots of the cDNA preparations were submitted to a two-step PCR (13McLaughlin M. Hale R. Ellston D. Gaudet S. Lue R.A. Viel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6406-6412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) to identify cDNA sequences coding for known alternatively spliced insertions. Primers F5 and BL6 (Fig. 2) were used in the primary PCR. Insertions I2, I3, and I4 were identified using, in the secondary reaction, primer A paired with primers G, H, or F, respectively (Fig. 2). The presence or absence of insertions I1A and I1B was determined by secondary PCRs containing combinations of primers BL14 or BL19 and BL31 or D (Fig. 2). The PCR products were identified as described previously (13McLaughlin M. Hale R. Ellston D. Gaudet S. Lue R.A. Viel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6406-6412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of hDlg by λ and YOP Phosphatases—Caco-2/15 cells were solubilized in Triton lysis buffer, and 600 μg of lysate was immunoprecipitated with hDlg antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and twice with the corresponding phosphatase buffer (supplied by the manufacturer). The reactions were performed in a final volume of 50 μl for 30 min at 30 °C using either λ phosphatase (1000 units; New England Biolabs, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), YOP phosphatase (2500 units; New England Biolabs), or heat-inactivated phosphatases (65 °C, 1 h). After treatment, the beads were washed again with Triton lysis buffer, and 4× Laemmli’s buffer was added prior to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. RNA Interference—Double-stranded RNAs (siRNA) were designed as described by Donze and Picard (18Donze O. Picard D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 46-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and prepared using the Ribomax large scale RNA production system (Promega, Nepean, Ontario, Canada). Sense and antisense RNA were treated with RNase-free DNase for 15 min at 37 °C and mixed together. The RNA mix was then heated at 100 °C for 2 min and annealed at 37 °C for 1 h. Targeted sequences began at nucleotides 194, 528, 991, and 1329 of the hDlg-1 gene, respectively (10Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Caco-2/15 or HIEC cells were transfected with 50 nm of siRNA using OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Cells were fixed at 72 h post-transfection for immunofluorescence or lysed for Western blot analysis. Macromolecular Complex Analysis—3-Day post-confluent Caco-2/15 cells were washed twice with PBS and treated with 200 μg/ml (in PBS) of DSP cross-linker (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min at room temperature. After solubilization in Laemmli’s buffer without β-mercaptoethanol, 75 μg of proteins from untreated and treated cells were separated in duplicate on 5% SDS-PAGE gels. E-cadherin containing macromolecular complexes was visualized by Western blot, and the corresponding region on the duplicate was excised from the gel, reduced, and loaded on top of a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The separated proteins were analyzed by Western blot. Far Western Analysis—Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in chilled Triton lysis buffer. 800 μg (about 100 μl) of cell lysate were boiled in 1% SDS for 5 min (denaturing conditions). Protein samples were subsequently diluted to a concentration of 0.1% SDS, subjected to the immunoprecipitation protocol, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked for at least 1 h at 25 °C in PBS containing 5% powdered milk and 0.05% Tween 20. Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with GST-E-cadherin (12Reuver S.M. Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or GST-p85 SH2 domains (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) diluted at a concentration of 2 μg/ml in the blocking solution. Membranes were washed 4 times (10 min each) in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and then incubated sequentially with an anti-GST and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Blots were visualized by chemiluminescence. Dephosphorylation of hDlg by PP1 Phosphatase—Subconfluent Caco-2/15 cells lysates were prepared under the same SDS denaturing conditions used for far Western analysis to eliminate protein-protein interactions. After immunoprecipitation with hDlg antibodies, the beads were treated with PP1 phosphatase (2500 units; New England Biolabs) or heat-inactivated phosphatase as described for YOP and λ phosphatase treatments. Reporter Construct and Luciferase Assays—The sucrase-isomaltase reporter construct (SI luciferase), which contains the human sucraseisomaltase promoter cloned upstream of the luciferase gene, was a kind gift of Dr. P. G. Traber (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia). Subconfluent Caco-2/15 were seeded in 24-well plates and co-transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) with 0.1 μg of SI luciferase reporter together with 50 nm of siRNA/194, siRNA/1329, or siRNA/GFP. 72 h after transfection, luciferase activity was measured according to the Promega protocol. Expression and Localization of hDlg in Human Intestinal Epithelial Cells—Expression of Dlg/hDlg was first analyzed by Western blot in crypt and villus cell populations isolated from adult mouse jejunum and in subconfluent proliferating and confluent differentiating Caco-2/15 cells. Caco-2/15 cell line is an intestinal cell line that spontaneously differentiates into a small bowel phenotype with microvilli, apical junctional complex formation, and polarization several days after reaching confluence (3Laprise P. Chailler P. Houde M. Beaulieu J.F. Boucher M.J. Rivard N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8226-8234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis of recovered intestinal epithelial cell preparations revealed relatively pure preparations of poorly differentiated crypt and fully differentiated villus cell populations (see “Experimental Procedures”). Lysates from crypt and villus cell preparations both revealed two major bands of ∼110–120 kDa, whereas in fully differentiated villus cells, two additional species with high electrophoretic mobilities were also prominent (Fig. 1A, left panel, see arrows). Expression patterns for hDlg protein in undifferentiated subconfluent and differentiating confluent Caco-2/15 cells were also comparable with that observed in crypt and villus cell populations, respectively, with the exception of an additional band just barely detectable in human confluent Caco-2/15 cells (Fig. 1A, right panel, see arrowhead). To characterize the intracellular distribution of hDlg in human fetal intestine and to evaluate hDlg localization at E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contact sites, frozen sections of a 20-week-old human fetal jejunum were labeled with antibodies toward E-cadherin, hDlg, and ZO-1. As illustrated in Fig. 1B, hDlg and E-cadherin stainings were both detected along the lateral cell-cell interfaces throughout the villus axis. The superimposition of both stainings demonstrated a strong co-localization of these proteins in differentiated enterocytes. In contrast, ZO-1 immunoreactivity was restricted to the apex of the lateral membrane of epithelial cells and did not co-localize with hDlg. hDlg expression was also confirmed in Caco-2/15 cells. As reported previously for the parental cell line Caco-2 (12Reuver S.M. Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), E-cadherin and hDlg co-localized homogeneously at cell-cell interfaces in 1-day post-confluent Caco-2/15 cells (Fig. 1C). The interaction between E-cadherin and hDlg was confirmed by their co-immunoprecipitation in confluent Caco-2/15 cells (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results confirm that hDlg co-localizes with E-cadherin in human intestinal epithelial cells. The Western blot data could suggest that intestinal epithelial cell differentiation is associated with the expression of specific alternatively spliced forms of hDlg. To examine further this hypothesis, hDlg variants were characterized in Caco-2/15 cells. The region of hDlg located between the N-terminal self-association domain and the first PDZ repeat is characterized by two alternatively spliced SH3-binding domains called I1A and I1B (Fig. 2) (13McLaughlin M. Hale R. Ellston D. Gaudet S. Lue R.A. Viel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6406-6412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). RT-PCR analysis was therefore performed to evaluate the combinations of I1A and I1B insertions found in hDlg transcripts from the following cell lines: normal crypt-like HIEC cells that are proliferative and undifferentiated (14Perreault N. Beaulieu J.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 224: 356-364Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar); PCDE cells that are primary cultures of differentiated villus enterocytes (15Perreault N. Beaulieu J.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 245: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar); and subconfluent or confluent differentiating Caco-2/15 cells. The combinations of insertions I1A and I1B were tested with four different combinations of primers (13McLaughlin M. Hale R. Ellston D. Gaudet S. Lue R.A. Viel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6406-6412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Only one combination (I1A present and I1B absent) was consistently absent in all studied cell types (data not shown). These results suggest that neither confluency nor differentiation affected the expression of the SH3-binding insertions I1A and I1B. However, changes in the recruitment of SH3-containing proteins by insertions I1A and I1B during differentiation cannot be ruled out. The region of hDlg located between the SH3 and the GUK domains is characterized by four alternatively spliced insertions: I2, I3, I4, and I5 (Fig. 2). Our initial RT-PCR analysis focused on insertions I2 and I3 whose presence correlates with distinct intracellular localizations of hDlg isoforms (13McLaughlin M. Hale R. Ellston D. Gaudet S. Lue R.A. Viel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6406-6412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The only qualitative difference observed when HIEC, PCDE, and Caco-2/15 cells, collected at various stages of cell density, were analyzed pertained to the presence of a transcript containing insertion I4 in subconfluent Caco-2/15 cells, whereas I4 was not detected once cells reached confluence. I4 was also not detected in either HIEC or PCDE cells (data no shown). Decreased Phosphorylation of hDlg during Differentiation of Intestinal Epithelial Cells—Because the different protein expression profiles observed in Fig. 1A between undifferentiated and differentiated intestinal epithelial cells cannot be explained by the existence of different alternatively spliced insertions, we investigated whether hDlg phosphorylation could be responsible for this difference. hDlg was immunoprecipitated from subconfluent and confluent Caco-2/15. Beads containing hDlg immune complexes were then incubated with the dual specificity λ phosphatase in order to dephosphorylate the putative phosphorylation sites on hDlg. As shown in Fig. 3A, immunoprecipitated hDlg exhibited two bands in control subconfluent Caco-2/15 cells (left panel), in contrast to five bands in control confluent Caco-2/15 cells (right panel). Interestingly, treatment of hDlg immunoprecipitates with the λ phosphatase revealed five distinct forms of hDlg in subconfluent Caco-2/15 cells (Fig. 3A, left panel, see arrows), including the two forms of lower molecular mass normally observed in confluent cells (right panel). On the other hand, in confluent Caco-2/15 cells, treatment of immunoprecipitated hDlg with phosphatase λ appeared to stabilize the five forms of hDlg (Fig. 3A, right panel, see arrows). Hence, subconfluent Caco-2/15 cells expressed the same variants of hDlg than that observed in confluent cells, but their phosphorylation levels decreased when cells reached confluency and underwent differentiation. The observed decrease in hDlg phosphorylation when Caco-2/15 cells reach confluence prompted us to further determine whether this decreased phosphorylation was correlated with cell cycle arrest and/or with induction of the differentiation process. Subconfluent Caco-2/15 cells were treated with hydroxyurea, a pharmacological inhibitor of the cellular ribonucleoside reductase, in order to arrest cell cycle in G1/S phase (19Calzado M.A. MacHo A. Lucena C. Munoz E. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2000; 120: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), followed by analysis of hDlg protein expression profiles by Western blot. Treatment of subconfluent Caco-2/15 cells with hydroxyurea did induce cell cycle arrest in late G1 as confirmed by the strong inhibition of cell proliferation. 2P. Laprise, A. Viel, and N. Rivard, unpublished data. hDlg expression was not affected however by the hydroxyurea treatment (Fig. 3B, left panel). To analyze further hDlg expression in relation to proliferation, crypt-like HIEC cells were also investigated because these proliferative and undifferentiated intestinal epithelial cells block their proliferation upon reaching confluence but never initiate differentiation (14Perreault N. Beaulieu J.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 224: 356-364Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 3B (middle panel), hDlg expression in subconfluent growing HIEC was comparable with that observed in subconfluent Caco-2/15 cells. Of note, hDlg expression was not altered in confluent quiescent HIEC, suggesting that the expression of the fast migrating forms (dephosphorylated forms) is unrelated to the proliferation state of intestinal epithelial cells. However, treatment of immunoprecipitated hDlg with λ phosphatase revealed the fast migrating forms in subconfluent growing HIEC cells, suggesting that HIEC expressed these variants that remained undetected due to their phosphorylated state (Fig. 3B, right panel). Taken together, these results indicate that intestinal epithelial cells express several hDlg variants and that the dephosphorylation of some of these variants is correlated with the initiation of cell differentiation. hDlg Controls Adherens Junction Integrity—The co-localization of hDlg with E-cadherin in differentiated intestinal epithelial cells further prompted us to determine whether hDlg might control adherens junction integrity.

https://openalex.org/W2096687538,"The adhesive interactions of cells with laminins are mediated by integrins and non-integrin-type receptors such as α-dystroglycan and syndecans. Laminins bind to these receptors at the C-terminal globular domain of their α chains, but the regions recognized by these receptors have not been mapped precisely. In this study, we sought to locate the binding sites of laminin-10 (α5β1γ1) for α3β1 and α6β1 integrins and α-dystroglycan through the production of a series of recombinant laminin-10 proteins with deletions of the LG (laminin G-like) modules within the globular domain. We found that deletion of the LG4–5 modules did not compromise the binding of laminin-10 to α3β1 and α6β1 integrins but completely abrogated its binding to α-dystroglycan. Further deletion up to the LG3 module resulted in loss of its binding to the integrins, underlining the importance of LG3 for integrin binding by laminin-10. When expressed individually as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase or the N-terminal 70-kDa region of fibronectin, only LG4 was capable of binding to α-dystroglycan, whereas neither LG3 nor any of the other LG modules retained the ability to bind to the integrins. Site-directed mutagenesis of the LG3 and LG4 modules indicated that Asp-3198 in the LG3 module is involved in the integrin binding by laminin-10, whereas multiple basic amino acid residues in the putative loop regions are involved synergistically in the α-dystroglycan binding by the LG4 module.

Laminins are the major basement membrane proteins expressed ubiquitously throughout the metazoa. Laminins are heterotrimers of three subunits, termed α, β, and γ chains, which assemble into cross-shaped molecules with three short arms and one long rod-like arm. To date, five α chains, three β chains, and three γ chains have been identified, combinations of which yield at least 12 isoforms with distinct subunit compositions (1Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 213-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). These isoforms have been shown to be involved in many biological processes, including cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, and differentiation (1Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 213-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 2Timpl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The interaction of cells with laminins is mediated by a variety of cell surface receptors including integrins and non-integrin-type receptors such as α-dystroglycan and syndecans (1Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 213-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 3Henry M.D. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Integrins are of crucial importance among these receptors with respect to controlling the growth and differentiation of cells. There are more than 20 integrins with distinct subunit compositions, of which α3β1 and α6β1 integrins have been shown to be the major laminin receptors expressed in many cell types (4Kikkawa Y.

The G domain consists of five tandem repeats of LG modules of ∼200 amino acid residues, designated LG1 through LG5. However, the binding sites within the G domain for integrins and α-dystroglycan remain to be defined. Laminin-10 (α5β1γ1) is a major laminin isoform widely expressed in adult tissues (15Miner J.H. Lewis R.M. Sanes J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28523-28526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Mice lacking the laminin α5 gene exhibit embryonic lethality resulting from severe developmental abnormalities, such as syndactyly, exencephaly, and placental dysmorphogenesis (16Miner J.H. Cunningham J. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1713-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Laminin-10 also seems to be essential for hair morphogenesis because ablation of laminin-10 results in arrest of hair follicle development at the hair germ elongation phase (17Li J. Tzu J. Chen Y. Zhang Y.P. Nguyen N.T. Gao J. Bradley M. Keene D.R. Oro A.E. Miner J.H. Marinkovich M.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2400-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Previously, we purified laminin-10/11 from the conditioned medium of human lung carcinoma cells and demonstrated that adhesion of epithelial cells to laminin-10/11 was mediated mainly by α3β1 integrin (4Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15854-15859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), although adhesion of fibroblastic cells was mediated through both α3β1 and α6β1 integrins (5Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Fujiwara H. Sonnenberg A. Sekiguchi K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 869-876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The roles of α3β1 and α6β1 integrins as major receptors for laminin-10/11 were confirmed further by direct binding of laminin-10/11 to α3β1 and α6β1 integrins (6Nishiuchi R. Murayama O. Fujiwara H. Gu J. Kawakami T. Aimoto S. Wada Y. Sekiguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recently, Yu and Talts (18Yu H. Talts J.F. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) produced recombinant fragments modeled after the G domain of the mouse α5 chain and demonstrated that the fragment consisting of the LG1–3 modules had cell adhesive activity dependent on α3β1 and α6β1 integrins, whereas the fragment consisting of the LG4–5 modules was capable of mediating cell adhesion via interaction with α-dystroglycan. However, precise mapping of the binding sites for integrins and α-dystroglycan within the G domain of the α5 chain remains undefined. In the present study, we produced a panel of recombinant laminin-10 mutants with serial deletions of the LG1–5 modules and examined their binding activities to purified α3β1 and α6β1 integrins, α-dystroglycan, and heparin. Our results show that the LG3 module is indispensable for binding to α3β1 and α6β1 integrins, although the LG3 module alone is not sufficient to recapitulate the integrin binding activity. In contrast, the binding site(s) for α-dystroglycan and heparin have been mapped to the LG4 module, which alone can exhibit potent binding activities toward α-dystroglycan and heparin. We also attempted to identify the amino acid residues involved in integrin and α-dystroglycan binding by site-directed mutagenesis of the LG3 and LG4 modules, respectively. cDNA Cloning and Construction of Expression Vectors—A full-length cDNA encoding the human laminin α5 subunit (GenBank accession AF443072) was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR as a series of ∼1.2-kb fragments, and each fragment was subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI) or pCRscript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was extracted from A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells and used as a template for reverse transcription-PCR. The list of primer sequences is available upon request. After sequence verification, error-free cDNA fragments were ligated in tandem to construct a cDNA encompassing the whole open reading frame. The α5 cDNA was inserted into the NheI/PmeI sites of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), yielding the α5 chain expression vector pcDNA-α5. Expression vectors for laminin β1 (pCEP-β1) and γ1 (pcDNA3.1-γ1) were prepared as described previously (19Hayashi Y. Kim K.H. Fujiwara H. Shimono C. Yamashita M. Sanzen N. Futaki S. Sekiguchi K.

Expression vectors for laminin α5 chains lacking LG5 (nucleotides 1–10554; pcDNA-α5ΔLG5), LG4–5 (nucleotides 1–9891; pcDNA-α5ΔLG4–5), LG3–5 (nucleotides 1–9360; pcDNA-α5ΔLG3–5), LG2–5 (nucleotides 1–8802; pcDNA-α5ΔLG2–5), and LG1–5 (nucleotides 1–8241; pcDNA-α5ΔLG1–5) were constructed as follows. cDNA fragments encompassing nucleotides 5795–8241 (for the deletion of LG1–5), 5795–8802 (for the deletion of LG2–5), 5795–9360 (for the deletion of LG3–5), 9365–9891 (for the deletion of LG4–5), and 9365–10554 (for the deletion of LG5) were amplified by PCR using KOD DNA polymerase (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) with an NotI (for the deletions of LG1–5, LG2–5, and LG3–5) or AscI (for the deletions of LG4–5 and LG5) site at the 5′-end and a stop codon and a PmeI site at the 3′-end. The PCR products were digested with NotI/PmeI or AscI/PmeI, and the resultant cDNA fragments were recloned into the pcDNA-α5 vector cleaved with the same restriction enzymes. Expression vectors for individual LG modules of the laminin α5 chain as GST fusion proteins were prepared as follows. cDNAs encoding the individual modules were amplified by PCR using pcDNA-α5 as a template. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and XhoI and inserted into the corresponding restriction sites of the pGEX4T-1 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). The PCR primers used were 5′-TTCAATGAATTCTCAGGGGTGCAGC-3′ and 5′-CGGGTCCTCGAGCTACTTGGAGCGGGC-3′ (for LG1), 5′-GCCCGCGAATTCTCGACCGGGGACCCG-3′ and 5′-GGCGCGCTCGAGCTACAGGTCGGCGGTGC-3′ (for LG2), 5′-ACCGCCGAATTCCTGGTGGGGCGCGCC-3′ and 5′-CGGGGTCTCGAGCTACAGGGCGGGTGC-3′ (for LG3), 5′-AATGAATTCAGGACCACCCGAGAC-3′ and 5′-TATCTCGAGCTAGGGGCCCAAGATGCAG-3′ (for LG4), and 5′-GTCACAGAATTCATCTTGGGCCCCCTG-3′ and 5′-CTGCAGGCTCGAGACTAGGCGGCTGG-3′ (for LG5). Expression vectors for fusion proteins of the LG3 and LG4 modules with the N-terminal 70-kDa domain of human fibronectin (FN70K), designated FN70K-LG3 and FN70K-LG4, respectively, were prepared as follows. The expression vector pMTX-1 for the truncated form of human fibronectin (20Matsuyama S. Ichihara-Tanaka K. Sekiguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) was digested with HindIII and NotI and inserted into the corresponding restriction sites of pFLAG-CMV-5c (Sigma), yielding the expression vector pFLAG-FN70K for FN70K with a FLAG tag. cDNA fragments encoding the LG3 and LG4 modules were amplified by PCR using pcDNA-α5 as a template with an NotI site at the 5′-end and an EcoRV site at the 3′-end. The PCR products were digested with NotI/EcoRV and inserted into the corresponding restriction sites of the expression vector pFLAG-FN70K. The PCR primers used were 5′-ATATGCGGCCGCACCGCCGACCTGCTG-3′ and 5′-TATGATATCTTGCAGGGCGGGTGC-3′ (for LG3) and 5′-ATATGCGGCCGCAGGACCACCCGAGAC-3′ and 5′-ATAGATATCGGGGCCCAAGATGCAG-3′ (for LG4). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of the LG4 module was accomplished by overlap extension PCR with KOD polymerase using pGEX-LG4 encoding the GST-LG4 fusion protein as a template. The list of primer sequences used for the site-directed mutagenesis is available upon request. For site-directed mutagenesis of the LG3 module, the cDNA fragment encoding LG3 was excised from pcDNA-α5ΔLG4–5 with AscI and PmeI and recloned into pSecTag2A (Invitrogen) at the AscI/PmeI sites. The resulting plasmid was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis of the LG3 module by overlap extension PCR as described above. The list of primer sequences used for the site-directed mutagenesis is available upon request. The purified PCR products containing the mutations were digested with AscI and PmeI and inserted into the corresponding restriction sites of the expression vector pcDNA-α5ΔLG4–5. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant laminin-10 (rLN10) and its mutants were produced using the FreeStyle™ 293 Expression system (Invitrogen). Briefly, 293-F cells were simultaneously transfected with expression vectors for α5, β1, and γ1 using 293fectin (Invitrogen), and grown in serum-free FreeStyle™ 293 Expression medium for 72 h. For the expressions of rLN10 and rLN10 lacking LG5, 200 μg/ml heparin was included in the medium to inhibit the proteolytic cleavage between the LG3 and LG4 modules (21Amano S. Scott I.C. Takahara K. Koch M. Champliaud M.F. Gerecke D.R. Keene D.R. Hudson D.L. Nishiyama T. Lee S. Greenspan D.S. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22728-22735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The conditioned media were clarified by centrifugation and passed through immunoaffinity columns conjugated with an anti-human laminin α5 mAb 5D6 (22Fujiwara H. Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17550-17558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The columns were washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 500 mm NaCl to remove bound heparin, and then bound laminins were eluted with 0.1 m triethylamine, neutralized, and dialyzed against TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). Individual LG modules of the α5 chain produced as GST fusions were induced in Escherichia coli with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B columns (Amersham Biosciences) after lysis of the cells by sonication. Bound proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm glutathione. Purified proteins were dialyzed against TBS. GST-LG3 was recovered as insoluble aggregates upon sonication and then solubilized in TBS containing 8 m urea and dialyzed against TBS before passing through a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. FN70K, FN70K-LG3, and FN70K-LG4 were produced using the FreeStyle™ 293 Expression system as described above. The conditioned media were applied to anti-FLAG M2 columns (Sigma), and the columns were washed with TBS. Bound proteins were competitively eluted from the columns with 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma) and dialyzed against TBS. Proteins and Antibodies—α3β1 and α6β1 integrins were purified from human placenta and reconstituted into 3H-labeled phosphatidylcholine liposomes as described previously (6Nishiuchi R. Murayama O. Fujiwara H. Gu J. Kawakami T. Aimoto S. Wada Y. Sekiguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). α-Dystroglycan was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle according to Brancaccio et al. (23Brancaccio A. Schulthess T. Gesemann M. Engel J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. α-Dystroglycan partially purified using DEAE-Sephacel and wheat germ agglutinin-agarose chromatography was purified further by laminin-1 affinity chromatography, followed by CsCl gradient centrifugation (10Pall E.A. Bolton K.M. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3817-3821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Heparin-BSA was purchased from Sigma. mAbs against the human laminin α5 chain (15H5 and 5D6) were produced in our laboratory (22Fujiwara H. Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17550-17558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A mAb against human laminin γ1 (mAb 1920) was purchased from Chemicon. A mAb against human fibronectin (FN9-1) was obtained from Takara Biomedicals (Kyoto, Japan). A mAb against human β1 integrin (AIIB2) developed by Dr. Caroline Damsky (University of California, San Francisco) was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Iowa City, IA). A polyclonal anti-GST antibody was produced by immunizing rabbits with purified GST and affinity-purified on a GST-conjugated Sepharose column. Binding Assays for Integrins, α-Dystroglycan, and Heparin—Integrin binding assays were performed using α3β1 and α6β1 integrins reconstituted into 3H-labeled phosphatidylcholine liposomes as described previously (6Nishiuchi R. Murayama O. Fujiwara H. Gu J. Kawakami T. Aimoto S. Wada Y. Sekiguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with the proteins to be tested at 20 nm, blocked with 1% BSA, and incubated with integrin-liposomes in the presence of 1 mm Mn2+ at room temperature for 6 h. Plates were washed with TBS containing 1 mm Mn2+, and the bound integrin-liposomes were recovered with 1% SDS and quantified with a Packard Tri-Carb 1500 liquid scintillation analyzer. For binding assays for α-dystroglycan and heparin, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with 5 μg/ml α-dystroglycan or 5 μg/ml heparin-BSA, blocked with 1% BSA, and incubated with rLN10, its mutant forms, or individual LG modules expressed as GST or FN70K fusion proteins in TBS containing either 1 mm CaCl2/MgCl2 or 1 mm EDTA at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with TBS, bound proteins were quantified with the anti-laminin γ1 mAb (rLN10 and its mutants), anti-GST antibody (GST fusion proteins), or anti-fibronectin mAb FN9-1 (FN70K fusion proteins) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies. Cell Adhesion Assay—Cell adhesion assays were performed using HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells (5Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Fujiwara H. Sonnenberg A. Sekiguchi K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 869-876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with 5 nm rLN10 or its mutants at 4 °C overnight and blocked with 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. HT1080 cells were harvested with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA, suspended in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at a density of 3 × 105 cells/ml, and then plated on the wells coated with rLN10 or its mutants at 3 × 104 cells/well. After incubation in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 30 min, the attached cells were fixed and stained with Diff-Quik (International Reagents Corp., Japan), washed with distilled water, and extracted with 1% SDS for colorimetric quantification at 590 nm. Cell adhesion inhibition assays were performed based on the cell adhesion assays. HT1080 cells were preincubated with a function-blocking anti-β1 integrin mAb (AIIB2) or control mouse IgG for 20 min at room temperature and then added to the precoated wells. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the cells attached to the substrates were quantified as described above. Production of Wild-type Laminin-10 and Its Deletion Mutants—To map the binding sites for integrin and α-dystroglycan within the G domain of the laminin α5 chain, we expressed rLN10 and a series of its deletion mutants lacking LG modules (Fig. 1A) by triple transfection of cDNAs encoding the laminin α5, β1, and γ1 subunits into 293-F cells. Secretion of endogenous laminins containing β1 and/or γ1 chains was undetectable in 293-F cells (data not shown). Both wild-type and mutant proteins were purified from conditioned media using immunoaffinity columns conjugated with an anti-α5 chain mAb. To minimize the cleavage at the spacer segment between the LG3 and LG4 modules, wild-type rLN10 and its mutant lacking LG5 (rLN10ΔLG5) were expressed in cells grown in medium containing heparin because heparin has been shown to inhibit partially the proteolytic processing of laminin-5 at the spacer region (21Amano S. Scott I.C. Takahara K. Koch M. Champliaud M.F. Gerecke D.R. Keene D.R. Hudson D.L. Nishiyama T. Lee S. Greenspan D.S. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22728-22735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The authenticity of the recombinant proteins was verified by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with a mAb against the α5 chain. Under reducing conditions, each recombinant protein gave three bands upon silver staining, one corresponding to the α5 chain, with a molecular mass of 300,000–400,000 depending on the extent of the deletion, and two lower bands corresponding to the β1 and γ1 chains (Fig. 1B). When wild-type rLN10 and rLN10Δ LG5 were expressed in 293-F cells grown in medium without heparin, the majority of the recombinant proteins were processed at the spacer region, yielding bands that comigrated with rLN10 lacking the LG4–5 modules (rLN10ΔLG4–5; data not shown). Under nonreducing conditions, rLN10 and its deletion mutants barely entered the gel, confirming that they were purified as trimers of the α5, β1, and γ1 chains. Cell Adhesive and Integrin Binding Activities of Wild-type Laminin-10 and Its Deletion Mutants—The purified rLN10 and its deletion mutants were assayed for their cell adhesive activities using HT1080 cells. rLN10ΔLG5 and rLN10ΔLG4–5 exhibited potent cell adhesive activities equivalent to that of wild-type rLN10, but those lacking the LG3–5, LG2–5, and LG1–5 modules were barely able to mediate cell adhesion to substrates (Fig. 2). Cell adhesion to wild-type rLN10 and the mutants lacking LG5 and LG4–5 was strongly inhibited by a function-blocking mAb against β1 integrin, confirming the role of β1 integrins as major cell surface receptors for laminin-10 (5Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Fujiwara H. Sonnenberg A. Sekiguchi K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 869-876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Nishiuchi R. Murayama O. Fujiwara H. Gu J. Kawakami T. Aimoto S. Wada Y. Sekiguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cell adhesion to wild-type rLN10 and the mutants lacking LG4–5 and LG5 was also inhibited by a combination of anti-α3 integrin and anti-α6 integrin mAbs, but not by either mAb alone (data not shown), consistent with previous observations (5Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Fujiwara H. Sonnenberg A. Sekiguchi K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 869-876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A dramatic loss of the cell adhesive activity upon deletion of LG3 indicated that the LG3 module is indispensable for the potent cell adhesive activity of laminin-10 and that LG3-dependent cell adhesion is mainly mediated by α3β1 and/or α6β1 integrins. To confirm the importance of the LG3 module in the binding of laminin-10 to α3β1 and α6β1 integrins, we examined the binding of rLN10 and its mutants to these integrins. We purified α3β1 and α6β1 integrins from placenta and examined their binding to laminin-10 and its mutants after reconstitution into 3H-labeled phosphatidylcholine liposomes (Fig. 3). As expected, the mutants lacking the LG5 and LG4–5 modules were capable of binding to both α3β1 and α6β1 integrins with potencies that were comparable with that of wild-type rLN10, although mutants lacking LG3–5, LG2–5, or LG1–5 were almost devoid of any activity. The binding activities of mutants lacking LG5 and LG4–5 to these integrins were completely abrogated in the presence of EDTA (data not shown), confirming that the mutants lacking LG5 and LG4–5 retained the same integrin binding properties as intact laminin-10. α-Dystroglycan and Heparin Binding Activities of Wild-type Laminin-10 and Its Deletion Mutants—We also examined the binding of wild-type laminin-10 and its deletion mutants to α-dystroglycan and heparin by solid phase binding assays using microtiter plates coated with α-dystroglycan or heparin-BSA. Wild-type rLN10 was capable of binding to α-dystroglycan in the presence of Ca2+ ions but not in the presence of EDTA (Fig. 4), consistent with previous reports that the binding of laminin-1/2 to α-dystroglycan is Ca2+-dependent (8Ervasti J.M.

In contrast, wild-type rLN10 bound to heparin irrespective of the presence of Ca2+ or EDTA, confirming that heparin binding to laminin-10 does not require divalent cations, e.g. Ca2+ (12Andac Z. Sasaki T. Mann K. Brancaccio A. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 13Talts J.F. Andac Z. Gohring W. Brancaccio A. Timpl R.

Among the deletion mutants tested, rLN10ΔLG5 retained full binding activities toward α-dystroglycan and heparin, but other mutants including rLN10ΔLG4–5 were only marginally active at binding to either α-dystroglycan or heparin (Fig. 4). These results provide loss-of-function evidence that both α-dystroglycan and heparin bind to the LG4 module of laminin-10. Receptor Binding Activities of Individual LG Modules—The binding profiles of the deletion mutants of laminin-10 toward α3β1/α6β1 integrins and α-dystroglycan/heparin suggested that the LG3 module was the likely binding site for α3β1 and α6β1 integrins, whereas the LG4 module was the likely binding site for α-dystroglycan and heparin. To explore these possibilities further, we expressed the individual LG modules of the α5 chain in bacteria as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 5A) and assayed their abilities to bind α3β1/α6β1 integrins as well as α-dystroglycan/heparin. Only GST-LG4 was capable of binding to α-dystroglycan and heparin among the five GST-LG modules (Fig. 5B), confirming that LG4 is the major binding site for both α-dystroglycan and heparin. In contrast, neither LG3 nor any of the other LG modules showed any significant binding to α3β1 or α6β1 integrins (Fig. 5C), except that GST-LG1 exhibited a very weak integrin binding activity. Because the failure of LG3 and the other LG modules to bind to these integrins could result from misfolding and/or the absence of glycosylation resulting from their expression in bacteria, we expressed the LG3 and LG4 modules in 293-F cells as fusion proteins with FN70K, which serves as a vehicle for the secretion of"

However, caspases themselves have been shown to regulate the activity of a number of signaling cascades, raising the possibility that the effect of XIAP in these pathways is indirect. Here we examine this question by introducing point mutations in XIAP predicted to disrupt the ability of the molecule to bind to and inhibit caspases. We show that whereas these mutant variants of XIAP lost caspase-inhibitory activity, they maintained their ability to activate Smad, NF-κB, and JNK signaling pathways. Indeed, the signaling properties of the molecule were mapped to domains not directly involved in caspase binding and inhibition. The activation of NF-κB by XIAP was dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the RING domain. On the other hand, the ability of XIAP to activate Smad-dependent signaling was mapped to the third baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) and loop regions of the molecule. Thus, the anti-apoptotic and signaling properties of XIAP can be uncoupled.

Recent studies have determined the crystal structure of XIAP interacting with caspase-3, -7, and -9 and revealed great detail of the molecular determinants necessary for these interactions. The linker region between BIR 1 and BIR 2 is important for binding to caspase-3 and -7 (6Chai J. Shiozaki E. Srinivasula S.M. Wu Q. Dataa P. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y.

The amino acids in the linker region upstream of BIR 2 bind to the active site of caspase-3 and -7 in an antiparallel orientation, inhibiting the enzymatic activity of these caspases. The residue Asp148 in XIAP is particularly important for the ability of XIAP to bind to these caspases (7Riedl S.J. Renatus M. Schwarzenbacher R. Zhou Q. Sun C. Fesik S.W. Liddington R.C.

A hydrophobic pocket in the surface groove of BIR 3 of XIAP mediates this interaction. This pocket is occupied by the first four amino acids of processed caspase-9 (p12 subunit). The residue Trp310 in BIR 3 forms part of this pocket and is critical for binding to caspase-9 (22Sun C. Cai M. Meadows R.P. Xu N. Gunasekera A.H. Herrmann J. Wu J.C. Fesik S.W. J. Biol.

This binding is mediated by tetrapeptide sequences present in the amino-terminal portion of the mature form of these proteins that have significant similarity to amino-terminal sequences present in mature caspase-9 (p12 subunit). The binding of these molecules or caspase-9 to XIAP is mutually exclusive (17Sun C. Cai M. Gunasekera A.H. Meadows R.P. Wang H. Chen J. Zhang H. Wu W. Xu N. Ng S.C. Fesik S.W.

Thus, Smac/DIABLO and Omi/HtrA2 are negative regulators of XIAP that function to release XIAP from caspases; in the case of Omi/HtrA2, proteolytic cleavage of XIAP also participates in this negative regulation (33Srinivasula S.M.

In addition to the ability of XIAP to inhibit caspases, other roles for this molecule have been demonstrated, including its participation in a number of signaling pathways. XIAP has been found to be a cofactor in transforming growth factor-β and bone morphogenetic protein (TGF-β/BMP) signaling pathways. The TGF-β superfamily is a group of cytokines that function as growth regulators with diverse effects depending on the target tissue (35de Caestecker M.P. Piek E. Roberts A.B. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1388-1402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Letterio J.J. Roberts A.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 137-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). XIAP can bind to the cytoplasmic domain of the type I BMP receptor (ALK-3) and can affect BMP-regulated dorsal-ventral polarity in a Xenopus developmental model (11Yamaguchi K. Nagai S.

Similarly, an association between XIAP and the type I TGF-β receptor (ALK-5) results in synergistic activation of TGF-β-dependent transcription by XIAP (12Birkey Reffey S. Wurthner J.U. Parks W.T. Roberts A.B. Duckett C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26542-26549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In addition, ectopic expression of XIAP has been shown to activate stress-responsive signaling pathways, such as the N-terminal c-Jun kinase (JNK) pathway (37Sanna M.G. da Silva Correia J. Ducrey O.

The activation of JNK1 was reported to contribute to the protective effect conferred by XIAP (41Sanna M.G. Da Silva Correia J. Luo Y. Chuang B. Paulson L.M. Nguyen B. Deveraux Q.L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; Google Scholar) and is thought to result from interactions between XIAP and factors such as TAB1 (11Yamaguchi K. Nagai S. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nishita M. Tamai K. Irie K. Ueno N. Nishida E. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and ILPIP (41Sanna M.G. Da Silva Correia J. Luo Y. Chuang B. Paulson L.M. Nguyen B. Deveraux Q.L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; Google Scholar) that activate the MAP3 kinase TAK1. The activation of NF-κB in endothelial cells can result from activation of IκB kinase by TAK1 (40Hofer-Warbinek R. Schmid J.A. Stehlik C. Binder B.R. Lipp J. de Martin R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22064-22068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), but in other cell models it is not mediated by this pathway (12Birkey Reffey S. Wurthner J.U. Parks W.T. Roberts A.B. Duckett C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26542-26549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Whether the caspase-inhibitory properties of XIAP play any role in its signaling properties is not known. Caspases not only play a central role in apoptosis but can regulate other signaling cascades. Caspase-1, -4, and -5 participate in IL-1β and IL-18 processing and maturation; similarly, a role for caspase-8 in signaling events involved in T-cell proliferation has been demonstrated (42Newton K. Strasser A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 819-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Caspases can participate in NF-κB signaling through the ability of caspase-3 to cleave the amino-terminal portion of IκB-α, an inhibitory factor that prevents nuclear translocation of NF-κB, leading to a stabilization of IκB-α and blockade of κB-mediated transcription (43Barkett M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 20664-20670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Additionally, Relish, a Drosophila homolog of NF-κB, has been found to be cleaved by the Drosophila caspase Dredd, leading to Relish activation (45Stoven S. Silverman N. Junell A. Hedengren-Olcott M. Erturk D. Engstrom Y. Maniatis T. Hultmark D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5991-5996Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Similarly, the mammalian NF-κB subunit c-Rel can also be cleaved by caspase-3, although the functional significance of this event is unclear (46Barkett M. Dooher J.E. Lemonnier L. Simmons L. Scarpati J.N. Wang Y. Gilmore T.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1526: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, we set out to determine whether the caspase-inhibitory activity of XIAP was required for its signaling properties. Here we report that point mutations in XIAP that abrogate its antiapoptotic activity do not affect its signaling activities, demonstrating that these properties are separate and independent of each other. In addition, the data presented demonstrate that the various signaling properties of XIAP can be mapped to different regions of the molecule. Cell Culture and Transfections—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells and the Smad4-deficient human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-468, were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection. All cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine. Transfection of 293 cells was performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure as described previously (47Duckett C.S. Gedrich R.W. Gilfillan M.C. Thompson C.B. Mol.

The bacterial GST expression vectors for the XIAP constructs were prepared by subcloning the inserts into the BamHI and NotI sites of pGEX 4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The HA-tagged XIAP plasmids were constructed by subcloning the inserts from the respective pEBG constructs previously described (48Duckett C.S. Li F. Wang Y. Tomaselli K.J. Thompson C.B.

In addition, pEBB-HA-BIR 1, pEBB-HA-BIR 2, pEBB-HA-BIR 3, pEBB-HA-BIR 1-2, pEBB-HA-BIR 2-3, and pEBB-HA-BIR 1-2-3 were generated by PCR using pEBB-XIAP as template with the boundaries for each construct as indicated in Fig. 5A. Luciferase Assays—For all reporter assays, cells were seeded into 6-well plates, and all treatment groups were performed in triplicate. For the NF-κB reporter assays in 293 cells, 50 ng of 2κB-luc reporter along with 2 μg of the indicated expression vectors were transfected into each well. Total DNA amount was equalized with control vector. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were washed once with PBS and lysed in 0.5 ml of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured as described previously (12Birkey Reffey S. Wurthner J.U. Parks W.T. Roberts A.B. Duckett C.S. J. Biol.

For the TGF-β-mediated reporter experiments in MDA-MB-468 cells, 200 ng of SBE-JONK reporter, 20 ng of Myc-Smad4, and 1 μg of the indicated expression vector were transfected into each well. At 24 h post-transfection, the medium was changed to Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium plus 0.2% FCS with or without 5 ng/ml human TGF-β1 (Roche Applied Science). The luciferase assay was performed 24 h later as described above. Western Blot—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were plated into 6-well dishes and were transfected with 2 μg of the indicated expression vector and lysed 24–48 h later using Triton X-100 lysis buffer (49Richter B.W.M. Mir S.S. Eiben L.J. Lewis J. Reffey S.B. Frattini A. Tian L. Frank S. Youle R.J. Nelson D.L. Notarangelo L.D. Vezzoni P. Fearnhead H.O. Duckett C.S. Mol.

Protein samples were resolved using 4–12% gradient Novex BisTris gels (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen), and blocked with 5% milk solution in TBS plus 0.2% Tween 20. For the XIAP Western blots, the membranes were incubated with a monoclonal antibody to XIAP (H59520; Transduction Laboratories) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Detection of the HA-tagged XIAP mutants was performed using a monoclonal antibody directed against the HA tag (HA11; Covance). Antibody detection was performed by the ECL Western blot detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Caspase Assays and Recombinant Proteins—The recombinant GST-XIAP fusion proteins were prepared by transforming the pGEX-4T1 vectors into BL21 (DE3)-competent cells (Stratagene). Cultures were allowed to grow until A600 = 0.6 and were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cultures were kept shaking at 30 °C for an additional 3 h. Bacterial pellets were lysed using GST lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) followed by sonication. The clarified lysates were run over a glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), washed with GST lysis buffer, and eluted in a buffer containing free glutathione (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.615 g/dl of glutathione). The eluates were then dialyzed overnight at 4 °C (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% CHAPS) and stored at -80 °C until use. The S-100 extracts were prepared from 293 cells as described previously (49Richter B.W.M. Mir S.S. Eiben L.J. Lewis J. Reffey S.B. Frattini A. Tian L. Frank S. Youle R.J. Nelson D.L. Notarangelo L.D. Vezzoni P. Fearnhead H.O. Duckett C.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 4292-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The caspase assays were set up by mixing 125 ng of the indicated GST fusion protein with 293 S-100 extracts and incubating this mixture for 30 min at 4 or 37 °C. Following the 30-min incubation, dATP was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the reaction mixture was incubated for an additional 20 min. An aliquot of the reaction was analyzed for caspase-3 activity, an indirect measurement of apoptosome and caspase-9 activation. The assay was performed in a caspase reaction buffer (50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) with the addition of 20 μm DEVD-AFC; cleavage was measured using a fluorescence plate reader (Cytofluor 4000; Perseptive Biosystems). To measure direct inhibition of caspase-3 activity, increasing amounts of recombinant GST fusion proteins were added to 10 ng of purified recombinant caspase-3 (BD Biosciences) in caspase reaction buffer with the addition of DEVD-AFC, and cleavage was monitored as described above. Kinase Assays—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of HA-JNK1 and 2 μg of the indicated plasmids. HA-JNK1 was precipitated with a monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5; Roche Applied Science), and kinase assays were performed as previously described (12Birkey Reffey S. Wurthner J.U. Parks W.T. Roberts A.B. Duckett C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26542-26549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Activation of JNK1 was determined by in vitro phosphorylation of recombinant GST-c-Jun-(1–79) and was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of HA-JNK1 and XIAP was confirmed by immunoblotting of lysates with HA- and XIAP-specific antibodies as described above. The -fold activation was normalized to the total amount of HA-JNK1 detected in each case. Generation of XIAP Mutants—XIAP is capable of binding to and inhibiting the enzymatic activity of key caspases involved in the activation of cell death pathways, conferring protection from intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic stimuli (Fig. 1A). In order to evaluate the potential contribution of caspase inhibition to the signaling properties of XIAP, mutations intended to disrupt the ability of XIAP to bind to and inhibit caspases were introduced in the molecule as previously described (24Bratton S.B. Lewis J. Butterworth M. Duckett C.S. Cohen G.M. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Using site-directed mutagenesis, the mutations D148A and W310A were introduced to disrupt the binding to caspase-3 and -7 or caspase-9, respectively (Fig. 1B). These mutations were introduced independently (XIAP D148A or XIAP W310A) or simultaneously (XIAP D148A/W310A) to generate three XIAP caspase-binding mutants. In order to assess the contribution of the RING domain of XIAP and its E3 ubiquitination activity to its ability to activate signal transduction, two additional mutants of XIAP were generated. A mutation creating a stop codon just prior to the RING domain at amino acid 448 (XIAP ΔRING) was introduced. In addition, a point mutation at histidine 467 (H467A), which results in loss of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (19Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar), was also generated. Functional Characterization of XIAP Caspase-binding Mutants—The caspase-inhibitory activity of XIAP proteins, including the wild type form and the point mutations expected to affect caspase binding, was tested in vitro. The ability of recombinant XIAP proteins to directly inhibit purified recombinant caspase-3 was tested first. To determine whether there was a difference in inhibitory activity between the various recombinant XIAP proteins, increasing amounts of recombinant XIAP were incubated with 10 ng of purified recombinant caspase-3. Both the wild type and W310A mutant showed caspase-3-inhibitory activity starting at 10 ng of recombinant XIAP. The mutants that contained the D148A mutation targeting the caspase-3 binding motif in XIAP were unable to inhibit recombinant caspase-3 activity even at the highest con"
https://openalex.org/W2095122897,"P2X receptors comprise a family of ATP-gated ion channels with the basic amino acids Lys-68, Arg-292, and Lys-309 (P2X1 receptor numbering) contributing to agonist potency. In many ATP-binding proteins aromatic amino acids coordinate the binding of the adenine group. There are 20 conserved aromatic amino acids in the extracellular ligand binding loop of at least 6 of the 7 P2X receptors. We used alanine replacement mutagenesis to determine the effects of individual conserved aromatic residues on the properties of human P2X1 receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. ATP evoked concentration-dependent (EC50 ∼1 μm) desensitizing currents at wild-type receptors and for the majority of mutants there was no change (10 residues) or a <6-fold decrease in ATP potency (6 mutants). Mutants F195A and W259A failed to form detectable channels at the cell surface. F185A and F291A produced 10- and 160-fold decreases in ATP potency. The partial agonists 2′,3′-O-(4-benzoyl)-ATP (BzATP) and P1,P5-di(adenosine 5′)-pentaphosphate (Ap5A) were tested on a range of mutants that decreased ATP potency to determine whether this resulted predominantly from changes in agonist binding or gating of the channel. At K68A and K309A receptors BzATP and Ap5A had essentially no agonist activity but antagonized, or for R292A potentiated, ATP responses. At F185A receptors BzATP was an antagonist but Ap5A no longer showed affinity for the receptor. These results suggest that residues Lys-68, Phe-185, Phe-291, Arg-292, and Lys-309 contribute to ligand binding at P2X1 receptors, with Phe-185 and Phe-291 coordinating the binding of the adenine ring of ATP. P2X receptors comprise a family of ATP-gated ion channels with the basic amino acids Lys-68, Arg-292, and Lys-309 (P2X1 receptor numbering) contributing to agonist potency. In many ATP-binding proteins aromatic amino acids coordinate the binding of the adenine group. There are 20 conserved aromatic amino acids in the extracellular ligand binding loop of at least 6 of the 7 P2X receptors. We used alanine replacement mutagenesis to determine the effects of individual conserved aromatic residues on the properties of human P2X1 receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. ATP evoked concentration-dependent (EC50 ∼1 μm) desensitizing currents at wild-type receptors and for the majority of mutants there was no change (10 residues) or a <6-fold decrease in ATP potency (6 mutants). Mutants F195A and W259A failed to form detectable channels at the cell surface. F185A and F291A produced 10- and 160-fold decreases in ATP potency. The partial agonists 2′,3′-O-(4-benzoyl)-ATP (BzATP) and P1,P5-di(adenosine 5′)-pentaphosphate (Ap5A) were tested on a range of mutants that decreased ATP potency to determine whether this resulted predominantly from changes in agonist binding or gating of the channel. At K68A and K309A receptors BzATP and Ap5A had essentially no agonist activity but antagonized, or for R292A potentiated, ATP responses. At F185A receptors BzATP was an antagonist but Ap5A no longer showed affinity for the receptor. These results suggest that residues Lys-68, Phe-185, Phe-291, Arg-292, and Lys-309 contribute to ligand binding at P2X1 receptors, with Phe-185 and Phe-291 coordinating the binding of the adenine ring of ATP. P2X receptors for ATP are a novel family of ligand-gated cation channels comprised of seven receptor subunits (P2X1–7) that associate most likely as homo- and heterotrimeric channels to give a range of properties (for review see Ref. 1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar). They have been implicated in a variety of actions, as diverse as mediating fast synaptic transmission (2Evans R.J.

There is considerable interest in developing P2X receptor subtype selective drugs, for example, P2X1 receptor-targeted drugs may have applications in the regulation of male fertility (4Mulryan K.

P2X receptors have intracellular amino and carboxyl termini, two transmembrane domains, and a large extracellular ligand binding loop (8Surprenant A. Buell G. North R.A. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 224-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and are structurally distinct from the Cys loop and glutamatergic receptor superfamilies of ion channels. There is also little or no similarity between the P2X receptors and other families of nucleotide-binding proteins. To develop a structural model of the P2X receptor site-directed mutagenesis has been used to determine the role of conserved amino acids as well as investigating membrane topology, the contributions of transmembrane domains, and intracellular regulation (for a comprehensive review see Ref. 1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar). Our studies have concentrated on the P2X1 receptor that regulates smooth muscle contraction (4Mulryan K. Gitterman D.P.

Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We have previously identified positively charged amino acids that may coordinate the action of negatively charged phosphate groups of ATP (12Ennion S. Hagan S. Evans R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29361-29367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) as well as investigating the role of disulfide bonds (13Ennion S.J. Evans R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and conserved negatively charged residues (14Ennion S.J. Ritson J. Evans R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). The site(s) of recognition of the adenine group that gives nucleotide selectivity to the P2X receptors and what residues are associated with the adenine and ribose moieties of ATP are unclear. Some insight into the amino acids responsible for drug binding has come from studies on other ATP-binding proteins where work based on mutagenesis and crystal structures has identified the contribution of aromatic amino acids. For example, phenylalanine (F) coordinates the recognition of the adenine group of ATP by DEAD box helicases (15Tanner N.K. Cordin O. Banroques J. Doere M. Linder P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) and tyrosine (Y) may form hydrogen bonds with the ribose of ATP by UvrB DNA helicase (16Theis K. Chen P.J. Skorvaga M. Van Houten B. Kisker C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6899-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In addition conserved aromatic amino acids may also contribute to cation-π interactions (17Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2366) Google Scholar, 18Beene D.L. Brandt G.S. Zhong W. Zacharias N.M. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10262-10269Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). For P2X receptors it is possible that the electrostatic potential on the face of the aromatic ring coordinates the binding of magnesium complexed to the phosphate groups of ATP or other cations as co-factors of ATP action. In this study we have used alanine replacement mutagenesis of conserved aromatic amino acids in the extracellular loop of the P2X1 receptor (Fig. 1) to determine their role in the functional properties of the receptor. Our prediction is that if a residue is important for ATP action then replacement of the conserved aromatic amino acid with alanine would result in change in the properties of the receptor. Similarly a lack of effect of the mutation would indicate that a conserved aromatic amino acid was not essential for normal receptor function. The mutants correspond to residues that are completely conserved in the P2X receptor family (P2X1 receptor residues Tyr-55, Tyr-274, Trp-164, Trp-259, Phe-185, Phe-243, Phe-276, and Phe-291), positions where there is a conserved aromatic group (Tyr, Trp, or Phe: Tyr-90, Phe-195, Phe-289, Phe-297, and Phe-311) and where there is a conserved aromatic group in 6 P2X receptor subtypes (Trp-85, Phe-100, Phe-198, Phe-230, Phe-293, Phe-315, and Phe-326) (Fig. 1). We have expressed mutant receptors in Xenopus oocytes and determined the effects on agonist and antagonist action as well as receptor expression. Mutants F185A and F291A resulted in decreases in the EC50 (potency) of ATP (10- and 160-fold, respectively) indicating that these residues contribute to the actions of agonists at the P2X1 receptor. Previously we identified positively charged amino acids in the extracellular loop of the P2X1 receptor (Lys-68, Arg-292, and Lys-309) that regulate ATP potency (12Ennion S. Hagan S. Evans R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29361-29367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), however, in these studies we were unable to determine whether this resulted from a direct effect on agonist binding to the receptor. The potency of ATP is a combined measure of the ability of ATP to bind to the receptor (affinity) and the subsequent functional opening of the channel (gating). Recent crystallographic and electrophysiological studies on ionotropic glutamate receptors have suggested that partial agonists can be used in delineate effects on agonist binding versus gating of the channel (19Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5736-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 20Jin R. Banke T.G. Mayer M.L. Traynelis S.F. Gouaux E. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). We used the partial agonists 2′,3′-O-(4-benzoyl)-ATP (BzATP) 1The abbreviations used are: BzATP, 2′,3′-O-(4-benzoyl)-ATP; Ap5A, P1,P5-di(adenosine 5′)-pentaphosphate. and P1,P5-di(adenosine 5′)-pentaphosphate (Ap5A) to investigate further the mechanisms underlying the decrease in ATP potency at mutant P2X1 receptors and have identified regions of the extracellular loop that contribute to ATP binding. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The human P2X1 receptor construct, described previously (12Ennion S. Hagan S. Evans R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29361-29367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), was used as a template for production of plasmids containing conserved aromatic residue mutations to alanine. Point mutations were introduced using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Phenylalanine residues at positions 100, 185, 195, 198, 230, 243, 276, 289, 291, 293, 297, 311, 315, and 326 were mutated to alanine. Tryptophan residues at positions 85, 164, and 259 were mutated to alanine and tyrosine residues at positions 55, 90, and 274 were mutated to alanine. Production of the correct mutations and absence of coding errors in the P2X1 mutant constructs was verified by DNA sequencing (Automated ABI Sequencing Service, University of Leicester). P2X1 Mutant and Wild-type Receptor Expression in Xenopus laevis Oocytes—Mutant and wild-type plasmids were transcribed to produce sense strand cRNA (mMessage mMachine™, Ambion) as described (12Ennion S. Hagan S. Evans R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29361-29367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Manually defoliculated stage V X. laevis oocytes were injected with 50 nl (50 ng) of cRNA using an Inject+Matic microinjector (J. Alejandro Gaby, Genéva, Switzerland) and stored at 18 °C in ND96 buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm sodium pyruvate, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6). Media was changed daily prior to recording 3–7 days later. Electrophysiological Recordings—Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were made from X. laevis oocytes using a GeneClamp 500B amplifier with a Digidata 1322 analog to digital converter and pClamp 8.2 acquisition software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) essentially as described previously (12Ennion S. Hagan S. Evans R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29361-29367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). External ND96 bath solution contained 1.8 mm BaCl2 replacing 1.8 mm CaCl2 to prevent activation of endogenous calcium-activated chloride channels. ATP (Mg salt, Sigma) was applied via a U-tube perfusion system as was BzATP, Ap5A, UTP, ITP, GTP, and CTP (Sigma). The P2 receptor antagonist suramin (Bayer) was bath-perfused and also co-applied with ATP from the U-tube. Reproducible responses to agonists were recorded when there was a 5-min interval between applications. Concentration response curves were fitted with the Hill equation: Y = [(X)nH × M[/[(X)nH + (EC50)nH], where Y is response, X is agonist concentration, nH is the Hill coefficient, M is maximum response, and EC50 is the concentration of agonist evoking 50% of the maximum response. pEC50 is the -log10 of the EC50 value. The concentration ratio for suramin (3 μm) was calculated (EC90 response in the presence of suramin/EC90 response in the absence of suramin) and used to estimate antagonist potency; pKB estimate = log10(concentration ratio - 1) - log10[suramin concentration]. Relative efficacy (∈) for comparison of wild-type and mutants was calculated using the equation: ∈ = Imax (partial agonist)/Imax (ATP). All data are shown as mean ± S.E. with significant differences calculated using the Student’s t test. n corresponds to the number of oocytes tested. Western Blotting—Expression levels of wild-type and mutant receptors were estimated by Western blot analysis of total cellular protein and cell surface proteins. Oocytes injected with wild-type or mutant receptor cRNA were homogenized in buffer H (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, and 10 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture) at 20 μl/oocyte. Total cellular protein samples were prepared as described previously (12Ennion S. Hagan S. Evans R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29361-29367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) was used to label cell surface proteins and estimate the level of wild-type or mutant receptor trafficked to the cell surface membrane. Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin is impermeable to the cell membrane and can only biotinylate proteins available at the cell surface. Oocytes previously injected with wild-type or mutant receptor cRNA were treated with Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (0.5 mg/ml) in ND96 for 30 min. Oocytes were homogenized in buffer H and the spin-cleared supernatant was mixed with streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma) and treated as described previously (13Ennion S.J. Evans R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). All samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min prior to loading. Samples were run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and screened for immunoreactivity for the anti-P2X1 antibody (1:500) (Alomone, Israel). Effects of Mutation of Conserved Aromatic Amino Acids on the Response to ATP—ATP evoked concentration-dependent desensitizing inward currents with an EC50 of ∼1 μm at wild-type (WT) P2X1 receptors similar to those reported previously (12Ennion S. Hagan S. Evans R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29361-29367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, Table I). Of the 20 conserved aromatic amino acid mutants tested alanine substitution was tolerated and ATP-evoked responses were evoked from all of them except F195A and W259A (Fig. 2, Table I). Mutants F100A, F230A, F276A, F297A, and W164A had no effect on ATP potency or the time course of the response. Mutants F198A, F289A, F293A, Y274A, and W85A had no effect on ATP potency but there was a small (less than 2-fold) change in the time course of the current. There was a modest (less than 6-fold) decrease in ATP potency and effect on the time course of the response (less than 2-fold) for mutants F243A, F311A, F315A, F326A, and Y55A. Y90A gave a modest decrease in ATP potency (∼2-fold) but no significant change in the time course of the response. It seems unlikely that any of the above functional mutants contribute a major role to the actions of ATP at the receptor and any changes in parameters most likely result from small modifications in receptor structure. F185A had a 10-fold decrease in ATP potency but had no effect on the time course of the response. Mutant F291A resulted in an ∼160-fold decrease in ATP potency, with a slight (1.6-fold) slowing in the rate of receptor desensitization. These results suggest that of the conserved aromatic amino acids Phe-185 and Phe-291 are most likely to be involved in ATP action at the P2X receptor.Table ISummary of data for ATP action at P2X1 WT and aromatic mutants EC50 data are representative of data collected from three to seven oocytes. pEC50 is -log10 of the EC50. Peak data was collected on first application of a maximal ATP concentration (n = 5-12). Half-time represents the time from peak to 50% decay of the current after an application of a maximal stimulating concentration of ATP (n = 4–6). Suramin pKB values were calculated using pKB = log10(concentration ratio -1) -log10[suramin concentration].

These properties could result from either reduced receptor expression and/or an impairment of the channel to open and pass current in response to the binding of ATP. To address this we have determined the levels of both total (Western blot using a crude cell lysate) and cell surface (Western blotting to detect P2X1 receptor labeled with membrane impermeant sulfo-NHS-LC biotin) P2X1 receptors for WT and mutants where there was a reduction in peak current amplitude (Fig. 3). WT P2X1 receptors were detected in both total cell lysates and following cell surface biotinylation and migrated as a single band of ∼53 Kd corresponding to a glycosylated monomeric receptor subunit. The equivalent levels of total and cell surface expression for WT, F198A, and F291A indicates that the modest decrease in peak current amplitude (50 and 20%, respectively) may result from a change in channel opening. Both F198A and Y55A mutants resulted in an ∼50% decrease in peak current amplitude, however, for the Y55A there is a marked decrease in both surface and total levels of receptor expression compared with WT suggesting that the reduction in expression accounts for the reduction in peak current amplitude. The mutants that failed to form functional channels (F195A and W259A) were below the limit of detection at the cell surface. However, when we mutated these residues to tyrosine functional channels that were indistinguishable from WT were produced (with peak currents of -7644 ± 313 and -8406 ± 597 nA and pEC50 values of 6.22 ± 0.15 and 5.81 ± 0.15 for F195Y and W259Y, respectively, n = 3–8) indicating that the conservative aromatic substitution with tyrosine can rescue channel function. For the F195A mutant we were unable to detect any receptor expression in total cellular lysates indicating that this receptor is inefficiently translated and/or selectively degraded; this suggests that this conserved aromatic residue is required for the normal folding and expression of the protein. In contrast the W259A mutant receptor was detected in total cell lysates, albeit at a reduced level (∼22% of P2X1 WT) indicating that inefficient trafficking of the receptor to the cell surface contributes significantly to the lack of functional response of this mutant. A similar effect was seen for the equivalent mutation in a P2X2 receptor background (21Nakazawa K. Ojima H. Ohno Y. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 324: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These results show that alanine cannot functionally substitute for the conserved amino acids at positions Phe-195 and Trp-259 and the role of these conserved aromatic amino acids in ATP action remains to be determined. Conserved Aromatic Amino Acids and Agonist Selectivity—In a range of nucleotide binding enzymes the nucleotide specificity is governed by aromatic amino acids, for example, in the F1-ATPase it is suggested that tyrosine 368 in the α-subunit confers adenine nucleotide specificity, whereas the β-subunit binding site that lacks a tyrosine residue also binds GTP and ITP (22Abrahams J.P.

We therefore tested whether point mutations to remove conserved tyrosine residues or other conserved aromatic amino acids that had the greatest effect on ATP potency (F185A and F291A) resulted in any change in nucleotide action at P2X1 receptors. The nucleotides UTP, GTP, CTP, and ITP (all 100 μm) were weak partial agonists at the WT P2X1 receptor with an order of efficacy CTP > UTP > ITP > GTP (0.31, 0.06, 0.04, and 0.02, respectively). Mutants F291A and Y274A resulted in increased efficacy to GTP, UTP, and GTP, respectively, but not to the other nucleotides tested. This suggests that these residues may contribute to nucleotide selectivity at the P2X1 receptor. Mutants F185A, Y55A, and Y90A either had no effect or a reduction in agonist efficacy for nucleotides UTP, GTP, CTP, and ITP (Fig. 4). Use of the Partial Agonist BzATP to Investigate Binding Versus Gating Effects—Our work has identified a number of mutations in the P2X1 receptor, including the aromatic amino acids Phe-185 and Phe-291 (this study) as well as the positively charged residues Lys-68, Arg-292, and Lys-309, that result in a decrease in agonist potency (12Ennion S. Hagan S. Evans R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29361-29367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 13Ennion S.J. Evans R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The interpretation of the underlying mechanism for these changes in ATP potency (a measure of the amount of agonist required to induce channel opening), however, raises a number of issues about agonist action. In particular whether the shift is because of a change in binding affinity at the receptor (including any conformational change in the protein associated with ligand binding, e.g. the glutamate induced closure of the ligand binding clam shell (23Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.Q. Gouaux E. Nature. 1998; 395: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar)) and/or the functional translation of agonist binding to the opening of the channel; i.e. gating.

Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar)), show no agonist or antagonist action at P2X1 receptors. This demonstrates that both an adenine ring and a triphosphate chain are required for high affinity binding at the P2X1 receptor and suggests that a conformational change in the protein is associated with high affinity binding of ATP (see Fig. 9). Recent work on ionotropic glutamate receptors has revealed that partial agonists result in different ligand-binding core conformational states (degree of closure of the clam shell) that in turn control the open probability of the channel (20Jin R. Banke T.G. Mayer M.L. Traynelis S.F. Gouaux E. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) and suggest that partial agonists may be able to discriminate between mutations that interfere with agonist binding versus channel opening. At WT P2X1 receptors BzATP evokes concentration-dependent desensitizing responses with an EC50 of ∼0.5 μm (pEC50 6.31 ± 0.11), similar to the potency of ATP (Fig. 5, A and C). However, the maximum response to BzATP is reduced compared with that of ATP indicating that BzATP is a partial agonist with an efficacy of 0.55 ± 0.06 (full agonist efficacy of 1) (as reported previously (26Evans R.J. Lewis C. Buell G. Valera S. North R.A. Surprenant A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 178-183PubMed Google Scholar)) (Table II), in addition, the time course of maximal responses was also slower than those of ATP (time to peak was increased to 922 ± 47 ms and the half-time of the response was prolonged to 2756 ± 130 ms, n = 6).

We observed that SHP-1 effectively antagonized Src-dependent phosphorylations in HEK293 cells. This occurred by dephosphorylation of Src substrates, because Src activity was unaffected in the presence of SHP-1. One reason for efficient dephosphorylation was activation of SHP-1 by Src. Recombinant SHP-1 had elevated activity subsequent to phosphorylation by Src in vitro, and SHP-1 variants with mutated phosphorylation sites in the C terminus, SHP-1 Y538F, and SHP-1 Y538F,Y566F were less active toward Src-generated phosphoproteins in intact cells.

SHP-1 modulates also the function of immunoreceptors (12D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases such as Lck (13Lorenz U. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

In other pathways, SHP-1 may also exert a positive function. Thus, a role of SHP-1 for differentiation of glia cells (15Wishcamper C.A. Coffin J.D. Lurie D.I. J. Comp.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5955-5963Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have been reported. Also, SHP-1 has the capacity to activate Src kinase by dephosphorylation of the inhibitory phosphotyrosine in the Src C terminus and may thus stimulate Src-dependent phosphorylations in certain cell types (17Somani A.K.

SHP-1 can translocate into the nucleus, however, its nuclear substrates are still elusive (18Tenev T. Böhmer S.A. Kaufmann R. Frese S. Bittorf T. Beckers T. Böhmer F.D. Eur. J.

Böhmer F.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26376-26384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), a cytoplasmic protein that possesses armadillo-like repeats, participates in cell-cell adhesion complexes, and has the capacity to translocate to the nucleus. p120ctn is also a prominent substrate for the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Src (23Mariner D.J.

The function of p120ctn tyrosine phosphorylation and hence, the role of PTP-mediated dephosphorylation, is not yet known. In addition to SHP-1, the transmembrane PTPs PTPμ and Dep-1 were reported to dephosphorylate p120ctn (24Zondag G.C. Reynolds A.B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol.

The substrate selectivity of PTPs in intact cells depends in a combinatorial way on targeting domains, and on the selectivity of the PTP catalytic domain (27Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). In the case of SHP-1 and the structurally related PTP SHP-2, this concept has been supported by domain swapping experiments (28Tenev T. Keilhack H. Tomic S. Stoyanov B. Stein-Gerlach M. Lammers R. Krivtsov A.V. Ullrich A. Böhmer F.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5966-5973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 29O'Reilly A.M. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 161-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Both, selectivity of the SH2 domains and the catalytic domains contribute to selective signaling effects in different cell models. The activity of SHP-1 is regulated by several mechanisms. A firmly established regulation mechanism is activation of SHP-1 through occupation of the SH2 domains by tyrosine-phosphorylated ligands (30Pei D. Lorenz U. Klingmüller U. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15483-15493Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This mechanism has been inferred by multiple lines of evidence. Very recently, determination of the crystal structure of SHP-1 has directly shown that, exactly as previously observed for SHP-2 (31Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), SHP-1 exists in a closed, autoinhibited conformation (32Yang J. Liu L. He D. Song X. Liang X. Zhao Z.J. Zhou G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6516-6520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In this fold, the N-terminal SH2 domain occludes the catalytic center. Binding of a phosphorylated ligand to the N-terminal SH2 domain stabilizes a conformation of this domain, which can no longer bind into the active site and thereby the enzyme is released from autoinhibition. The binding selectivity for the SHP-1 N-terminal SH2 domain has been characterized in much detail and a binding consensus hXpYXXh (x, any amino acid; h, hydrophobic; pY, phosphotyrosine) has been defined (33Burshtyn D.N. Yang W. Yi T. Long E.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13066-13072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 34Beebe K.D. Wang P. Arabaci G. Pei D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13251-13260Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition to SH2 domain ligand binding, other mechanisms have been proposed to modulate SHP-1 activity. Notably, several modifications of the C-terminal tail domain of SHP-1 lead to activity changes in vitro. These include truncation (30Pei D. Lorenz U. Klingmüller U. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T.

Keilhack H. Opitz F. Zschörnig O. Böhmer F.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11993-12002Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Major phosphorylation sites have been mapped at tyrosines 536 and 554. Different tyrosine kinases were shown to phosphorylate one or both of these sites, including the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase and Lck (37Lorenz U. Ravichandran K.S. Pei D. Walsh C.T.

It is currently not clear whether lipid binding or tyrosine phosphorylation play a role for SHP-1 activity regulation in vivo. However, the existence of an SHP-1 variant with an alternate C terminus, SHP-1L (39Jin Y.J. Yu C.L. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28301-28307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), suggests that this domain of the molecule may fulfill an important function. Potentially, it could also be involved in targeting of SHP-1. For example, a nuclear localization signal has been mapped to the C terminus (20Craggs G. Kellie S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23719-23725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and the phosphorylation sites may have the capacity to recruit SHP-1 substrates (40Yang W. Tabrizi M. Berrada K. Yi T. Blood. 1998; 91: 3746-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with the SH2 domain specificity, the substrate selectivity of the SHP-1 catalytic domain is less well characterized. Comparison of different phosphopeptide substrates (35Dechert U. Affolter M. Harder K.W. Matthews J. Owen P. Clark-Lewis I. Thomas M.L. Aebersold R. Jirik F.R. Eur. J.

Freitas M.A. Pei D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6202-6210Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have provided some insights. According to these data, negatively charged amino acids N-terminal to the phosphotyrosine and possibly hydrophobic residues in the +3 position may be critical for substrate binding to the SHP-1 catalytic domain. Here we describe novel phosphopeptide substrates for SHP-1 that are superior to previously described ones. They all correspond to efficient Src phosphorylation sequences. Based on enzymatic data and modeling studies we propose that Src and SHP-1 may have complementary substrate selectivity. In intact cells, Src substrates are efficiently dephosphorylated by SHP-1. Efficient recognition of Src substrates by the SHP-1 catalytic domain and the activation of SHP-1 by Src-dependent phosphorylation at the C-terminal phosphotyrosines play a role in this process. Src substrates only poorly interact with SHP-1 SH2 domains and activation of SHP-1 by C-terminal phosphorylation may be particularly important under these conditions. cDNA Constructs, Recombinant Proteins, and Antibodies—A human c-src cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. D. Fujita, University of Calgary, and subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pRK5RS. GST-Src was obtained from a pRK5RS c-src/EcoRI fragment, cloned into EcoRI-digested pBluescript KS (pBKKS, Stratagene) in such orientation that the EcoRV site of pBKKS was in front of the ATG of c-src. This construct was treated with EcoRV and NotI and the obtained c-src DNA was subcloned into SmaI- and NotI-digested pGEX-5X-2 (Amersham Biosciences). The constructs for eukaryotic expression of SHP-1 wild type and SHP-1 C455S and for bacterial expression of GST-SHP-1 wild type and SHP-1 domains have been described earlier (11Keilhack H. Muller M.

Throughout, the 597-amino acid epithelial SHP-1 variant (GenBank™ NM_080548) was used and numbering of mutations refers to this sequence. The SHP-1 Y538F, SHP-1 Y566F, and SHP-1 Y538F,Y566F mutations were obtained by PCR mutagenesis using pairs of oligonucleotides: 5′-GCCAGGAGTCGGAGTTCGGGAACATCACC-3′/5′-GGTGATGTTCCCGAACTCCGACTCCTGGC-3′ (for Y538F) and 5′-CAAGGAGGATGTGTTTGAGAACCTGCAC-3′/5′-GTGCAGGTTCTCAAACACATCCTCCTTG-3′ (for Y566F). Two PCR fragments for each mutation were obtained by using one of these oligonucleotides and either the corresponding upstream or downstream oligonucleotide (5′-GACCATCCAGATGGTGCGGG-3′/5′-CTAGTCTAGAGGACAGCACCGCTCACTTCCT-3′) as primers. PCR fragments were then fused by another PCR using the upstream/downstream pair of oligonucleotides as primers. The corresponding wild type DNA in GST-SHP-1 was replaced by the mutagenized fragments using Eco47III and XbaI (for Y538F or Y566F single mutation) or BglII and StuI (for Y538F,Y566F double mutation) sites. pcDNA3 constructs of these mutants were obtained by subcloning them from the GST constructs using EcoRI and XbaI sites flanking the SHP-1 gene. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Expression and purification of GST fusion proteins and GST-free recombinant SHP-1 was done as described earlier (36Frank C. Keilhack H. Opitz F.

The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and proteins were eluted by boiling with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Peptide Synthesis and Purification—The “optimal Src substrate,” the YEEI, the Cdc2 phosphopeptides, and the corresponding non-phosphorylated peptides were obtained from Biosyntan (Berlin, Germany). The p120ctn pY296 peptide DDLDpYGMMSD-NH2 and the corresponding non-phosphorylated peptide DDLDYGMMSD-NH2 were synthesized by the solid phase method using a model 396 MPS Advanced ChemTec Peptide Synthesizer, incorporating N-(9-fluorenyl)methyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) amino acids according to the standard protocol for 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate/1-hydroxybenzotriazole/N,N′-diisopropylethylamine couplings. Amino acid derivatives and coupling reagents were from Novabiochem (Bad Soden, Germany) and Orpegen (Heidelberg, Germany). Peptide assembly was performed on Rink-amide 4-methylbenzhydrylamino resin. Cleavage and deprotection of the peptides was achieved using 95% trifluoroacetic acid, 2.5% water, and 2.5% triisopropylsilane for 2–3 h. The crude peptides were purified by semipreparative reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a Knauer C18 column (32 × 250 mm) using an elution gradient (5–55% in 120 min) of 90% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. Peptides were >95% pure as analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography on a Vydac 218TP column (4.6 × 250 mm) and had the expected amino acid composition according to amino acid analysis. The molecular masses were confirmed using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on a triple quadrupole instrument Quattro (Fisons Biotech VG, Altrincham, England). Enzyme Assays—To assay Src activity, cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with agarose-linked anti-v-Src monoclonal antibody 327 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem, Bad Soden, Germany). Activity assays were done with acid-treated enolase as a substrate in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP as described by Bagrodia et al. (44Bagrodia S. Chackalaparampil I. Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D. Nature. 1991; 349: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), except that the ATP concentration was increased to 10 μm and no β-mercaptoethanol was included into the kinase reaction. Alternatively, Src optimal substrate peptide AEEEIYGEFEAKKK (45Songyang Z. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar) was used as a substrate. Aliquots of the immunoprecipitates were incubated with the peptide at 30 μm and [γ-32P]ATP (10 μm, 10 μCi per sample) in a buffer containing 10 mm MnCl2, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate in a final volume of 100 μl at 30 °C. At different time points 20-μl aliquots were removed and mixed with 20 μl of 40 mm EDTA. The samples were briefly centrifuged and 10-μl aliquots of the supernatant were spotted on phosphocellulose paper (Whatman P81) and allowed to dry in air. The paper was washed 3 times with 75 mm phosphoric acid, dried, and exposed to the screen of a GS250 Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). To test activation of SHP-1 by Src-mediated phosphorylation in vitro, 1 μg of recombinant SHP-1 (or the GST fusion proteins as indicated in the figure legends) was incubated under agitation with the ∼1/100 molar amount of GST-Src in 30 μl of a solution containing 1 mm ATP, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 10 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C for 30 min. Controls were done without GST-Src or without ATP. Then, pNPP and DTT were added to final concentrations of 10 and 100 mm, respectively (final volume 50 μl), and the incubation was continued for another 30 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 100 μl of 1 n NaOH and pNPP hydrolysis was measured at 405 nm. Enzymatic activity of SHP-1 toward different phosphopeptides was assayed using malachite green for quantification of released phosphate with tyrosine phosphatase assay kit 1 from Upstate Biotechnology (Lace Placid, NY). Briefly, the phosphopeptides were incubated at a concentration of 200 μm with 4.4 ng/ml of the GST fusion protein of the SHP-1 catalytic domain (GST-SHP-1CAT) in a reaction buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 5 mm DTT, at room temperature for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of malachite green reagent and the amount of released free phosphate was determined by measuring the absorption at 620 nm. To obtain kinetic constants, a continuous fluorimetric assay for protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity according to Zhang et al. (46Zhang Z.Y. Maclean D. Thieme-Sefler A.M. Roeske R.W. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) was used. Different concentrations of phosphopeptide were incubated in reaction buffer (50 mm 3,3-dimethylglutaric acid, pH 6.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT) at 30 °C for 5 min. The reaction was started by addition of catalytic amounts (0.8–8 nm) of GST-SHP-1CAT. Dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine was determined by following the increase of fluorescence at 305 nm after excitation with 282 nm with a “FluoroMax-2 fluorescence spectrometer” (ISA JOBIN YVON-SPEX, Instruments S.A., Inc.). Data fitting according to Zhang et al. (46Zhang Z.Y. Maclean D. Thieme-Sefler A.M. Roeske R.W. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) resulted in large variations of the constants obtained for different substrate concentrations. Therefore, a conventional analysis was performed using the program Grace-5.1.7. (Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel). Initial velocities were determined by linear regression of points in the first 10 s of reaction. Means of data from at least triplicate determinations were subjected to fitting according to the Michaelis-Menten model. Kinetic values obtained with the single data sets were in a range of ±15%. Molecular Modeling—Structural models for the complexes of the SHP-1 catalytic domain with various phosphopeptides were generated using the molecular modeling package InsightII (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). The model structures are based on the 2.5-Å crystal structure of the catalytic domain of human SHP-1 (synonym: PTP-1C) complexed with the SHPS-1/SIRPα-derived phosphopeptide substrate SIRPαpY469 (Ref. 41Yang J.

Note that numbering refers to the hematopoietic 595-amino acid variant of SHP-1 (GenBank™ NM_002831). The peptides were initially modeled using the builder and biopolymer modules of InsightII. Docking into the active binding site was performed by exchanging the corresponding residues of the peptide substrate in the experimental complex structure. The side chains of the substrate in the crystal structure (EDTLTpYADLD) were replaced by those of the phosphorylated optimal Src substrate or the p120ctn pY296 peptide (Table I). To analyze the contribution of individual residues of the optimal Src substrate, single residues were replaced by the corresponding ones in p120ctn pY296 and the SIRPαpY469 peptide. In addition, residues of SHP-1 that are expected to play a role for substrate specificity (47Andersen J.N. Mortensen O.H. Peters G.H. Drake P.G. Iversen L.F. Olsen O.H. Jansen P.G. Andersen H.S. Tonks N.K. Møller N.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7117-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) were replaced by the corresponding ones in PTP1B (Barford et al. (48Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), Protein Data Bank code 2hnp). The modeled complex conformations were used as starting structures for a 600 step-conjugated gradient energy minimization with the protein backbone harmonically restrained to the x-ray coordinates (force constant: 100.0 kcal/mol/Å2) and free peptides using the cvff-force field as implemented in the discover module of InsightII. An implicit solvent model with a distant dependent dielectric constant of 4.0 was applied. The ranking corresponds to the differences of interaction energies between peptide and catalytic domain relative to the optimal Src substrate (in kcal/mol). It should be noted that the calculated interaction energy is basically a measure of the steric and electrostatic peptide-protein complementarity.Table IEfficiency of substrate peptide interaction with the catalytic domain of SHP-1 Designations and sequences of phosphopeptides used in this study are given.Peptide name—5—4—3—2—10+1+2+3+4+5VmaxKmkkatkkat/KmRanks-1μms-1 μ10-6m-1s-1kcal/molCdc2IGEGTpYGVVYKNDNDNDYEEIEEEPQpYYEEEIbThe sequence of this peptide continues PIYL.

We investigated apoA-I-mediated cAMP signaling in cultured human fibroblasts induced with (22R)-hydroxycholesterol and 9-cis-retinoic acid (stimulated cells). Treatment of stimulated fibroblasts with apoA-I for short periods of time (≤45 min) increased ATP binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner. Concomitantly, apoA-I increased the intracellular level of cAMP in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The maximal cAMP level was reached within 10 min at 10 μg/ml apoA-I representing a 1-fold increase. The ability of apoA-I to mediate cAMP production was only observed in stimulated fibroblasts. Furthermore, overexpression of ABCA1 in Chinese hamster ovary cells resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in apoA-I-mediated cAMP accumulation as compared with untransfected cells. In contrast, forskolin increased cAMP production significantly in unstimulated fibroblasts as well as in untransfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. Pharmacological inhibition of protein kinase A (H89) completely blocked apoA-I-mediated ABCA1 phosphorylation. Naturally occurring mutations of ABCA1 associated with Tangier disease (C1477R, 2203X, and 2145X) severely reduced apoA-I-mediated cAMP production, ABCA1 phosphorylation, 125I-apoA-I binding, and lipid efflux, without affecting forskolin-mediated cAMP elevation. In contrast, the protein kinase A catalytic subunit was able to phosphorylate ABCA1 similarly from mutant and normal cell lines in vitro. Together, our results indicate that apoA-I activates ABCA1 phosphorylation through the cAMP/protein kinase A-dependent pathway, apoA-I-mediated cAMP production required high level expression of functional ABCA1, and Tangier disease mutants have defective apoA-I-mediated cAMP signaling. These findings suggest that apoA-I may activate cAMP signaling through G protein-coupled ABCA1 transporter.

This process plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of HDL particles (1Brewer Jr., H.B. Santamarina-Fojo S. Am. J.

The importance of ABCA1 in the reverse cholesterol transport process has been strikingly demonstrated by the identification of mutations in ABCA1 gene locus as the molecular defect of Tangier disease (TD) and familial HDL deficiency (4Brooks-Wilson A.

These patients are characterized by extremely low HDL levels caused by inadequate transport of cellular cholesterol and phospholipids to the extracellular space, leading to hypercatabolism of lipid-poor nascent HDL particles (6Batal R.

Thus, factors affecting the active lipidation of apoA-I are likely to affect the homeostasis of plasma HDL cholesterol and the reverse cholesterol transport process, one of the major mechanisms by which HDL may prevent atherosclerotic vascular disease (7Tall A.R. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1255-1274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We have documented previously (8Haidar B. Denis M. Krimbou L. Marcil M. Genest Jr., J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2087-2094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) that the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent pathway plays a pivotal role in ABCA1 phosphorylation and modulates cellular lipid efflux mediated by apoA-I in fibroblasts. In a related observation, See et al. (9See R.H. Caday-Malcolm R.A. Singaraja R.R. Zhou S. Silverston A. Huber M.T. Moran J. James E.R. Janoo R. Savill J.M. Rigot V. Zhang L.H. Wang M. Chimini G.

In addition, it has been shown that PKA or protein kinase C (PKC) controls the function of ABC transporters, cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator, and P-glycoprotein by their phosphorylation (10Picciotto M.R.

A number of kinases have been implicated in cellular lipid efflux including mitogen-activated protein kinase and PKC (12Deeg M.A. Bowen R.F. Oram J.F. Bierman E.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

PKC inhibitors severely reduce apolipoprotein-mediated cholesterol efflux (14Li Q. Tsujita M. Yokoyama S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12045-12052Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and at the same time, protein kinase agonists such as 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate increase cholesterol efflux (15Haidar B. Mott S. Boucher B. Lee C.Y. Marcil M. Genest Jr., J. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 249-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, it was reported that cAMP-mediated cholesterol efflux to apoA-I is associated with the binding, uptake, and resecretion of apoA-I in a calcium-dependent pathway in murine macrophages (16Takahashi Y. Smith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11358-11363Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Such cross-talk between cAMP signaling and Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent signaling pathways might play a key functional role in vivo in the activation of ABCA1 by its phosphorylation, allowing apoA-I lipidation.Although it is clear that the cellular signaling process plays an important role in cellular lipid homeostasis and lipid efflux, structural determinants of molecular interactions between cell signaling molecules and apoA-I have not been elucidated. We hypothesize that apoA-I activates cAMP signaling directly or via cross-talk mechanisms with other signal transduction pathways. The present study aims at providing evidence for links between apoA-I, intracellular cAMP production, and ABCA1 phosphorylation, and examining how these interactions could be affected by cAMP regulators, PKA inhibitors, or by naturally occurring mutants of ABCA1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPatient Selection—Patients with TD were selected as described previously (2Marcil M. Bissonnette R. Vincent J. Krimbou L. Genest J. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1366-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All of these subjects carry a mutation at the ABCA1 gene locus and had clinical signs of TD. Cellular studies in all TD subjects revealed a marked impairment of apoA-I-mediated phospholipid and cholesterol efflux. Molecular analysis of the ABCA1 gene revealed a compound heterozygous state for subjects TD-1 and -3 and a homozygous nonsense point mutation in subject TD-2 (see Table I). Fibroblasts from three normolipidemic subjects were used as controls.Table ILevels of intracellular cAMP, ABCA1 phosphorylation, specific apoA-I binding, and lipid efflux in normal and ABCA1-deficient stimulated cell lines†Cell linePredicted protein alterationIntracellular cAMP levelsABCA1 phosphorylation,Specific 125I-apoA-I bindingCellular lipid effluxBasal+ApoA-I+ForskolinPhospholipidCholesterolfmol/mg cell protein% increase% of control%Control, n = 3628 ± 1181140 ± 70aCompared to basal level, p < 0.001.1289 ± 151aCompared to basal level, p < 0.001.220 ± 29100 ± 2.8100 ± 6.4100 ± 6.0TD-1C1477RbSplice site mutation on the second allele (IVS25 + 1, Gly → Cys), part of the transcript deleted; TD-1 and TD-3, compound heterozygous (mutation on the second allele not determined in TD-3); TD-2, homozygous for the ABCA1 gene mutation.792 ± 13745 ± 1081330 ± 167cCompared to basal level, p < 0.05.NDdND, not detectable.22 ± 2.625 ± 1.914 ± 1.6TD-22203X682 ± 106629 ± 801030 ± 135cCompared to basal level, p < 0.05.NDND11 ± 1.05.1 ± 0.5TD-32145X578 ± 25584 ± 13950 ± 87cCompared to basal level, p < 0.05.ND16 ± 3.79.0 ± 0.77.2 ± 0.5a Compared to basal level, p < 0.001.b Splice site mutation on the second allele (IVS25 + 1, Gly → Cys), part of the transcript deleted; TD-1 and TD-3, compound heterozygous (mutation on the second allele not determined in TD-3); TD-2, homozygous for the ABCA1 gene mutation.c Compared to basal level, p < 0.05.d ND, not detectable.

Exon-specific oligonucleotides were synthesized for each exon of the ABCA1 gene. Direct sequencing was performed on all patients, and single nucleotide changes were assessed by comparison between species to identify highly conserved residues. All detected nucleotide changes were assessed in large DNA samples that were from control individuals with normal HDL-C and from the same origin.In Vivo Phosphorylation and Immunoprecipitation—Confluent cells were stimulated or not with 2.5 μg/ml (22R)-hydroxycholesterol and 5 μm 9-cis-retinoic acid for 20 h, and the medium was replaced by minimum Eagle’s medium-free phosphate solution (Invitrogen). Cells were then labeled with 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 45 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of apoA-I (Biodesign International), 8-Br-cAMP, or okadaic acid.

Confluent cells were stimulated with 2.5 μg/ml (22R)-hydroxycholesterol and 5 μm 9-cis-retinoic acid for 20 h, and then surface proteins were biotinylated with 500 μg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)-ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C on a platform rotator. Cells were then washed with ice-cold quench buffer (1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)) and once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were swollen on ice for 10 min and then homogenized with 20 strokes in a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation at 2000 × g, at 4 °C, for 10 min to remove unbroken cells and nuclei, the supernatant was recentrifuged at 100,000 × g, at 4 °C, for 60 min. The resulting supernatant was discarded, and the final membrane pellet was resuspended in 250 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer; 100 μg of protein was added to 30 μl of streptavidin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated overnight on a platform mixer at 4 °C. The gel was pelleted and washed five times with immunoprecipitation buffer. SDS-PAGE gel and Western blotting were performed as described above.Intracellular cAMP Assay—Twenty-five thousand cells were seeded in 24-well plates (fibroblasts, ABCA1-expressing CHO cells, and untransfected CHO cells). The next day the cells were incubated overnight in a serum-free medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/bovine serum albumin, 1 mg/ml) supplemented with 2 μCi/ml [3H]adenine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the presence or absence of (22R)-hydroxycholesterol and 9-cis-retinoic acid. Cells were then washed once with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/HEPES (20 mm) and incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine with different concentrations of apoA-I for the indicated times. Adenylyl cyclase was activated with 40 μm forskolin. After the removal of the medium, the reaction was stopped with 500 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the cells were mechanically scraped and layered on the top of WA-1 acid Alumina columns (Sigma). The separation of [3H]cAMP so formed was achieved according to the method already described (18Alvarez R. Daniels D.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and slightly modified (19Allouche S. Polastron J. Jauzac P. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2461-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In brief, the columns were washed sequentially with 4 ml of 0.5 mm HCl and 0.5 ml of 0.1 m ammonium acetate and then collected into scintillation vials with 4 ml of 0.1 m ammonium acetate. The intracellular cAMP level was expressed in fmol/mg of cell protein. All of the experiments were performed in triplicate.In Vitro Phosphorylation by PKA Catalytic Subunit—Cells were stimulated with (22R)-hydroxycholesterol and 9-cis-retinoic acid, and the ABCA1 protein was immunoprecipitated as described above. The complex protein A-Sepharose-ABCA1 (25 μl) was added to PKA reaction buffer containing 20 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and incubated with 180 nm PKA catalytic subunit (Calbiochem) at 30 °C for 15 min in a total volume of 50 μl. [32P]ABCA1 was separated on SDS-6% polyacrylamide gel and then separated proteins were transferred into polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and detected by phosphorimaging.ApoA-I Binding Assay—ApoA-I binding assay was performed as we have described previously (20Denis M. Haidar B. Marcil M. Bouvier M. Krimbou L. Genest Jr., J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7384-7394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with minor modification. Briefly, purified human plasma apoA-I was iodinated with 125I by IODO-GEN (Pierce) to a specific activity of 800–1200 cpm/ng of apoA-I. Cells from three normal controls and three TD subjects (see Table I) were grown on 24-well plates and stimulated as described above. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C with 10 μg/ml 125I-apoA-I (under saturating binding conditions) in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C and then washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin and twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cell association radioactivity and cell protein were measured after digestion in 0.1 n NaOH. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 40-fold excess of unlabeled apoA-I. Results are expressed as nanograms of specific 125I-apoA-I binding/mg of cell protein. For appropriate comparison, results were presented as percent of controls (see Table I).Cellular Lipid Efflux—Phospholipid and cholesterol efflux were determined as described previously (2Marcil M. Bissonnette R. Vincent J. Krimbou L. Genest J. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1366-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Marcil M. Yu L. Krimbou L. Boucher B. Oram J.F. Cohn J.S. Genest Jr., J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 50,000 cells were seeded in 12-well plates. At midconfluence, the cells were labeled with 1–5 μCi/ml [3H]choline or 0.2 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 48 h. At confluence, cells were cholesterol-loaded (20 μg/ml) for 24 h. After a 24-h equilibration period, cells were stimulated with 2.5 μg/ml (22R)-hydroxycholesterol and 5 μm 9-cis-retinoic acid for 20 h. Phospholipid or cholesterol efflux was determined at either 2 or 24 h with 10 μg/ml apoA-I. Cellular lipid efflux was determined as follows: 3H cpm in medium/(3H cpm in medium + 3H cpm in cells); the results were expressed as the percentage of the total radiolabeled phospholipids or cholesterol.Statistical Analysis—Intracellular cAMP levels have been compared statistically by Student’s t test. Two-tailed p < 0.05 values were considered significantly different.RESULTSIn the present study, we labeled the cells with [32P]orthophosphate for 45 min at 37 °C to better assess a small variation of ABCA1 phosphorylation (8Haidar B. Denis M. Krimbou L. Marcil M. Genest Jr., J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2087-2094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, ABCA1 is phosphorylated at a basal level in untreated normal intact cultured human fibroblasts in which ABCA1 was induced with (22R)-hydroxycholesterol and 9-cis-retinoic acid (stimulated cells). Inclusion of the Ser-Thr phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (10 μm) during 32PO4 labeling resulted in a significant increase in the level of ABCA1 phosphorylation. In addition, the treatment of cells with 8-Br-cAMP (1 mm) in the presence of okadaic acid during the 32PO4 labeling further increased ABCA1 phosphorylation levels up to 6–8-fold.To establish the relationship between apoA-I and ABCA1 phosphorylation activity, normal intact stimulated cells were treated with increasing amounts of apoA-I (0, 10, and 50 μg/ml) during 32PO4 labeling. Phosphorylated ABCA1 was immunoprecipitated and normalized to total and cell surface ABCA1 protein as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 1B (lower panel), treatment of stimulated fibroblasts with apoA-I increased ABCA1 phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner, compared with the basal phosphorylation level of ABCA1 in untreated cells. One representative experiment is shown in the upper panel of Fig. 1B. On the other hand, apoA-I treatment (45 min) did not increase significantly the total ABCA1 level or cell surface ABCA1 protein. The effect of apoA-I treatment (10 μg/ml, 45 min) on ABCA1 phosphorylation was also observed in unstimulated cells, and this effect was markedly enhanced in stimulated cells (100 ± 7.8, 187 ± 9.6, and 365 ± 12.6% for base-line, unstimulated, and stimulated cells, respectively).Because cAMP has been suggested as the mediator of apoA-I-mediated ABCA1 phosphorylation (8Haidar B. Denis M. Krimbou L. Marcil M. Genest Jr., J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2087-2094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 9See R.H. Caday-Malcolm R.A. Singaraja R.R. Zhou S. Silverston A. Huber M.T. Moran J. James E.R. Janoo R. Savill J.M. Rigot V. Zhang L.H. Wang M. Chimini G. Wellington C.L. Tafuri S.R. Hayden M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41835-41842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the question was raised whether the increase in ABCA1 phosphorylation induced by apoA-I was associated with an increase in cAMP production. As shown in Fig. 2A, treatment of stimulated fibroblasts with apoA-I (10 μg/ml) resulted in a rapid increase of the intracellular levels of cAMP in a time-dependent manner, reaching maximal levels within 10 min, and then decreased slightly at 30 min. At the same time, treatment of stimulated normal cells with increasing amounts of apoA-I (0, 1, 5, 10, and 50μg/ml) increased intracellular cAMP levels in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). The maximal cAMP level was reached at 10 μg/ml apoA-I, representing a 1-fold increase, compared with the basal intracellular cAMP level in untreated cells (506 ± 15 versus 1119.9 ± 66.2 fmol/mg of cell protein, respectively). Above 10 μg/ml apoA-I, the intracellular cAMP levels decreased gradually. In contrast, treatment of unstimulated normal fibroblasts with increasing amounts of apoA-I did not elevate cAMP concentrations above basal levels. A control experiment was performed to probe the specificity of apoA-I response. We demonstrate that apoA-I (10 μg/ml) was able to mediate cAMP production in stimulated but not in unstimulated normal fibroblasts from three different normal cell lines (Fig. 3A). As expected, forskolin (FRK) increased intracellular cAMP similarly in either unstimulated or stimulated cells (Fig. 3A). We observed that stimulation of cells with (22R)-hydroxycholesterol and 9-cis-retinoic acid for 16–24 h increased ABCA1 protein levels and specific 125I-apoA-I binding by 4-fold, compared with unstimulated cells (data not shown).Fig. 2Concentration and time dependence of apoA-I-mediated cAMP production. A, stimulated normal fibroblasts were incubated with 10 μg/ml apoA-I for varying periods of time (0, 5, 10, 30, and 60 min), and then intracellular cAMP levels were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The plotted values are the means ± S.D. of triplicate measures. B, stimulated and unstimulated normal fibroblasts were incubated with increasing amounts of apoA-I (0, 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 μg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C, and intracellular cAMP levels were determined. The plotted values are the means ± S.D. of triplicate values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Effect of ABCA1 level on apoA-I-mediated cAMP production. A, unstimulated and stimulated normal fibroblasts from three different cell lines were incubated with either 10 μg/ml apoA-I or 40 μm FRK for 15 min at 37 °C, and intracellular cAMP levels were determined. Plotted values are the means ± S.D. of triplicate values from three different cell lines. B, CHO cells stably transfected with a human ABCA1 (CHO-ABCA1) and untransfected CHO cells (CHO-WT) were incubated with either 10 μg/ml apoA-I or 40 μm FRK for 15 min at 37 °C, and intracellular cAMP levels were determined. Results shown in A and B are representative of three different independent experiments. NS, not significant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Having determined that the ability of apoA-I to mediate cAMP production was observed only in stimulated fibroblasts, the question was posed whether ABCA1 expression is sufficient to increase intracellular cAMP. We next examined the ability of ABCA1 expression to induce apoA-I-mediated cAMP production in CHO cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, CHO cells stably transfected with a human ABCA1 showed a significant increase in cAMP production in the presence of 10 μg/ml apoA-I, as compared with wild type CHO cells. On the other hand, FRK significantly increased cAMP production above basal levels in ABCA1-CHO cells as well as in wild type CHO cells.To provide further evidence for a specific role of PKA in apoA-I-mediated ABCA1 phosphorylation activity, we examined the effect of H89 PKA inhibitor on ABCA1 phosphorylation. Treatment of normal stimulated cells with increasing amounts of H89 (0, 1, 5, and 10 μm) in the presence of apoA-I (10 μg/ml) almost completely inhibited apoA-I-mediated ABCA1 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Effect of H89 protein kinase A inhibitor on apoA-I-mediated ABCA1 phosphorylation. Lower panel, stimulated normal fibroblasts were [32P]orthophosphate-labeled (as in Fig. 1) in the presence of 10 μg/ml apoA-I with increasing amounts of H89 (0, 1, 5, and 10 μm). 32P-Labeled ABCA1 was immunoprecipitated and quantified by phosphorimaging. Percent decrease of [32P]ABCA1 from three different samples from the same cells is presented. The plotted values are the means ± S.D. of triplicate measures. One experiment representative of three is shown in the upper panel. The ABCA1 protein was detected on the same membrane by anti-ABCA1 antibody and used as a control for protein loading.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether naturally occurring mutations of ABCA1 may affect the ability of apoA-I to mediate cAMP production and ABCA1 phosphorylation activity, stimulated fibroblasts from normal control and three ABCA1 mutants associated with Tangier disease (Table I) were incubated in the absence or"
https://openalex.org/W2171820755,"Parotid acinar cells exhibit rapid cytosolic calcium signals ([Ca2+]i) that initiate in the apical region but rapidly become global in nature. These characteristic [Ca2+]i signals are important for effective fluid secretion, which critically depends on a synchronized activation of spatially separated ion fluxes. Apically restricted [Ca2+]i signals were never observed in parotid acinar cells. This is in marked contrast to the related pancreatic acinar cells, where the distribution of mitochondria has been suggested to contribute to restricting [Ca2+]i signals to the apical region. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the mitochondrial distribution and the role of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in shaping the spatial and temporal properties of [Ca2+]i signaling in parotid acinar cells. Confocal imaging of cells stained with MitoTracker dyes (MitoTracker Green FM or MitoTracker CMXRos) and SYTO dyes (SYTO-16 and SYTO-61) revealed that a majority of mitochondria is localized around the nucleus. Carbachol (CCh) and caged inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-evoked [Ca2+]i signals were delayed as they propagated through the nucleus. This delay in the CCh-evoked nuclear [Ca2+]i signal was abolished by inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake with ruthenium red and Ru360. Likewise, simultaneous measurement of [Ca2+]i with mitochondrial [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]m), using fura-2 and rhod-FF, respectively, revealed that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was also inhibited by ruthenium red and Ru360. Finally, at concentrations of agonist that evoke [Ca2+]i oscillations, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, and a nuclear [Ca2+] delay, CCh also evoked a substantial increase in NADH autofluorescence. This autofluorescence exhibited a predominant perinuclear localization that was also sensitive to mitochondrial inhibitors. These data provide evidence that perinuclear mitochondria and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake may differentially shape nuclear [Ca2+] signals but more importantly drive mitochondrial metabolism to generate ATP close to the nucleus. These effects may profoundly affect a variety of nuclear processes in parotid acinar cells while facilitating efficient fluid secretion.

Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4254) Google Scholar). For example, gene transcription in T cells can be differentially regulated by the frequency of [Ca2+]i oscillations (3Dolmetsch R.E. Xu K. Lewis R.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar), and in vascular smooth muscle cells global Ca2+ signals control contraction, whereas localized Ca2+ release (Ca2+ sparks) causes vasodilatation (4Jaggar J.H. Porter V.A. Lederer W.J. Nelson M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C235-C256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These examples highlight the importance of understanding the mechanisms that underlie the “shaping” of [Ca2+]i signals and how ultimately different patterns of [Ca2+]i signals can differentially activate physiological end points. By comparing the spatial and temporal kinetics of [Ca2+]i signaling in the morphologically and functionally related exocrine acinar cells of the pancreas and salivary glands, we have demonstrated previously (5Giovannucci D.R. Bruce J.I. Straub S.V. Arreola J. Sneyd J. Shuttleworth T.J. Yule D.I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 540: 469-484Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar) how different [Ca2+]i signals may be tuned to evoke specific physiological responses in these cells. The major function of pancreatic acinar cells is the exocytosis of zymogen granules that can be activated by apically confined [Ca2+]i signals (6Maruyama Y. Inooka G. Li Y.X. Miyashita Y. Kasai H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3017-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), suggested to be the major physiological [Ca2+]i signal evoked by threshold agonist concentrations (7Petersen O.H. CIBA Found. Symp. 1995; 188: 85-103PubMed Google Scholar). These apically confined [Ca2+]i signals are in part because of the distribution of mitochondria, which form a belt around the apically located zymogen granules (8Straub S.V. Giovannucci D.R. Yule D.I. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 9Tinel H. Cancela J.M. Mogami H. Gerasimenko J.V. Gerasimenko O.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4999-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). These perigranular mitochondria likely serve two main functions. First, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake provides a buffer barrier thereby preventing the spread of [Ca2+]i waves to the basal part of the cell (8Straub S.V. Giovannucci D.R. Yule D.I. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 9Tinel H. Cancela J.M. Mogami H. Gerasimenko J.V. Gerasimenko O.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4999-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 10Park M.K. Ashby M.C. Erdemli G. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1863-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Second, the Ca2+ taken up by mitochondria drives ATP production locally for the energy-consuming exocytotic process (11Maechler P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1803-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The major function of parotid acinar cells is fluid secretion, and this is most effectively activated by rapid global [Ca2+]i signals. We proposed that rapid global [Ca2+]i signals facilitate the almost simultaneous activation of Ca2+-dependent Cl- channels on the apical membrane and Ca2+-dependent K+ channels on the basolateral membrane (5Giovannucci D.R. Bruce J.I. Straub S.V. Arreola J. Sneyd J. Shuttleworth T.J. Yule D.I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 540: 469-484Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The latter maintain the membrane potential at hyperpolarizing potentials and the driving force for Cl- efflux, thereby ensuring efficient ion and water movement (12Nauntofte B. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: G823-G837PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, even at threshold stimulation parotid acinar cells exhibit rapid global [Ca2+]i signals, and apically confined [Ca2+]i signals were never observed (5Giovannucci D.R. Bruce J.I. Straub S.V. Arreola J. Sneyd J. Shuttleworth T.J. Yule D.I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 540: 469-484Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Given the many similarities between parotid and pancreatic acinar cells, the differences in the spatial and temporal patterns of [Ca2+]i signaling between these two cell types are difficult to reconcile if they have a similar distribution of mitochondria. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the mitochondrial distribution and the role of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in shaping [Ca2+]i signals in parotid acinar cells. The study revealed for the first time that there was an absence of any definitive perigranular mitochondria in parotid cells compared with that observed in pancreatic acinar cells. The specific mitochondrial distribution in parotid cells therefore likely facilitates the rapid, global [Ca2+]i signals observed. In contrast, the mitochondria are localized mainly to a region surrounding the nucleus in parotid acinar cells. In addition, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in this region differentially shapes nuclear [Ca2+] signals and enhances metabolism and thus ATP generation close to the nucleus. This may serve to differentially modulate a variety of processes within the nucleus. Isolation of Parotid Acinar Cells—Single cells or small clusters of parotid acinar cells were isolated from freshly dissected parotid glands from wild type Swiss Black mice by sequential digestion with (single cells) or without (cell clusters) trypsin followed by collagenase as described previously (5Giovannucci D.R.

Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1340-1348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Following isolation, cells were resuspended in 1% bovine serum albumin containing basal modified Eagle's media supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C and gassed with 5% CO2 and 95% O2 until ready for use. Prior to experimentation, aliquots of cell suspensions were loaded with the appropriate fluorescent dyes in a HEPES-buffered physiological saline solution (HEPES/PSS) containing the following (in mm): 5.5 glucose, 137 NaCl, 0.56 MgCl2, 4.7 KCl, 1 Na2HPO4, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.2 CaCl2, after which they were resuspended in HEPES-PSS and kept at 4 °C until ready for use. For measurement of [Ca2+]i, cells were loaded with 2 μm fura-2/AM for 30 min at room temperature. For the simultaneous measurement of cytosolic and mitochondrial [Ca2+], cells that had been pre-loaded with fura-2 were then loaded with 10 μm dihydro-rhod-FF/AM for 10 min at 4 °C. Dihydro-rhod-FF was formed by reacting 10 μl of 1 mg/ml NaBH4 with 40 μl of 1 mm rhod-FF stock solution. In some experiments (to confirm mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake) cells were simultaneously loaded with 5 μm rhod-FF and 0.5 μm MitoTracker Green FM for 10 min at 4 °C. Pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was achieved by pre-incubating cells with 30 μm ruthenium red (RuRed) (Sigma) (14Matlib M.A. Zhou Z. Knight S. Ahmed S. Choi K.M.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4949-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) for 30 min at room temperature. Stock solutions of Ru360 (1 mm) were made up in deoxygenated water immediately prior to use. Digital Imaging of Cytosolic and Mitochondrial [Ca2+]—Cells were allowed to adhere to a glass coverslip and continually perfused with HEPES-PSS using a gravity-fed perfusion system and automatic valves for rapid switching of solutions (Warner Instruments Inc., Hamden, CT). All [Ca2+] imaging experiments were performed using an inverted epifluorescence Nikon microscope with a 40× oil immersion objective lens (numerical aperture, 1.3) and a digital imaging system consisting of a TILL polychrome IV monochromator illumination system, a Sensicam 12-bit charged coupled device camera, and TILL VisION acquisition and analysis software as described previously (16Bruce J.I. Yule D.I. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48172-48181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To achieve maximum spatial and temporal resolution of CCh-evoked [Ca2+]i signals in the apical, nuclear, and non-nuclear basal regions, fluorescent images were captured with no binning at rates of 12-16 Hz, depending on image size, with 5-ms exposure times for both 340 and 380 nm images. 340/380 ratio images were calculated offline. For the simultaneous measurement of cytosolic and mitochondrial [Ca2+], fura-2- and rhod-FF-loaded cells were excited alternately with light at 340 (10 ms), 380 (10 ms), and 550 nm (50 ms). Fura-2- and rhod-FF-emitted fluorescence was collected sequentially through a fura-2-rhodamine dual emission dichroic beamsplitter with dual emission bandpass filter (510 ± 15 and 600 ± 25 nm) (Chroma Technology Corp., Rockingham, VT). Sequential images were acquired at a rate of 1 Hz, and changes in mitochondrial [Ca2+] were represented by ΔF/F0 ratio; where ΔF/F0 = 100((F - F0)/F0), F is the recorded fluorescence (in levels of gray), and F0 is the average starting fluorescence recorded over the initial 10 frames of the image sequence. In some experiments mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was confirmed by dual loading cells with MitoTracker Green FM and rhodFF. These cells were excited with light at 488 ± 15 (10 ms) and 550 ± 25 nm (50 ms), and the emitted fluorescence from both dyes was collected through a fluorescein isothiocyanate/TRITC dual emission dichroic beamsplitter and bandpass filter (520 ± 15 and 600 ± 25 nm, Chroma). All experiments were performed at room temperature. Flash Photolysis of Caged InsP3—For measurement of [Ca2+]i during flash photolysis of caged InsP3, single parotid acinar cells were loaded with 75 μm Oregon Green 488 BAPTA 2 (OGB2), which was introduced to the cell interior by means of diffusion through a patch pipette similar to that described previously (5Giovannucci D.R.

The standard intracellular pipette solution contained the following (in mm): 140 CsCl, 10 HEPES-Tris, 1.5 MgCl2, 3 MgATP, 1 N-(hydroxyethyl)ethylenediaminetriacetic acid, 0.075 OGB2, and 0.003 d-myo-InsP3 P-4(5)-1-(2-nitrophenyl)-ethyl ester (caged InsP3), pH 7.3. After acquiring the whole cell configuration, 4 min were allowed for equilibration of dye with the cytosol, after which cells were excited at 488 ± 15 nm, and emitted fluorescence was collected. Flash photolysis of caged InsP3 was achieved using a pulsed xenon arc lamp (TILL Photonics, Eugene, OR) to provide a 0.5-ms flash of UV light (360 ± 7.5 nm). Sequential images were acquired at a rate of 1 Hz, and changes in [Ca2+]i following flash photolysis of caged InsP3 were represented by ΔF/F0 ratio of OGB2 fluorescence. Confocal Imaging of Mitochondria and Nuclei—To assess the distribution of mitochondria and nuclei, clusters of parotid acinar cells were simultaneously loaded with either 50 nm MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes, OR) and 1 μm SYTO-16 (Molecular Probes), respectively, for 2 min at room temperature or 0.5 μm MitoTracker Green FM (Molecular Probes) and 1 μm SYTO-61 (Molecular Probes), respectively, for 10 min at 37 °C. Images were acquired using a Nikon C1 visible light laser scanning confocal microscope with a 40× (1.3 NA) and 100× (1.4 NA) oil immersion objective either simultaneously or sequentially for each dye. MitoTracker Green FM and SYTO-16 were excited by the 488-nm argon laser line, and emission was collected through a 543-nm bandpass filter and photomultiplier tube. MitoTracker Red CMXRos and SYTO-61 were excited by the 543- and 633-nm lines, respectively, from He-Ne lasers, and emission was collected through a 585 ± 30- and a 670 ± 20-nm bandpass filter and photomultiplier tube, respectively. Image stacks in the Z dimension with 0.5-0.8-μm step size were acquired using an automated focus. Volume-rendered three-dimensional reconstructed images were then calculated offline by the Nikon EZ-C1 analysis software using a maximum projection algorithm. Digital Imaging of NADH Autofluorescence—By using the conventional epifluorescence imaging system described above, unloaded cells were excited with light at 350 nm with an exposure of 100 ms, and NADH autofluorescence was collected through a 400-nm dichroic and 450 ± 45-nm bandpass filter. Sequential images were acquired at a rate of 1 Hz, and changes in NADH autofluorescence were represented by ΔF/F0 ratio. Data Analysis and Experimental Design—Due to the nature of most experiments, an unpaired experimental design was applied (unless otherwise stated in the text), whereby statistical significance was determined between control cells and cells pre-treated with mitochondrial inhibitors using an unpaired t test or Mann-Whitney test. For any parameter analyzed from several cells in a particular experiment, an average value was determined. These values were in turn averaged to give the values expressed in the text as means ± S.E. CCh- and InsP3-evoked Ca2+ Signals Are Significantly Slower in the Perinuclear Region of Parotid Acinar Cells—We have shown previously (5Giovannucci D.R. Bruce J.I. Straub S.V. Arreola J. Sneyd J. Shuttleworth T.J. Yule D.I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 540: 469-484Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), by using flash photolysis of caged InsP3, that Ca2+ release initiates in the apical region but very rapidly becomes global in nature even at threshold concentrations of InsP3. Most important, the apically confined [Ca2+]i signals typical of pancreatic acinar cells were never observed in parotid acinar cells (5Giovannucci D.R. Bruce J.I. Straub S.V. Arreola J. Sneyd J. Shuttleworth T.J. Yule D.I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 540: 469-484Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In these studies, however, it was also noted that in ∼35% of cells (8 of 23 cells), there was a region in the basal part of the cell where the increase in [Ca2+]i was smaller and exhibited slower kinetics than other regions of the cell (Fig. 1A). We hypothesized that this region corresponded to the nucleus and that this anomalous [Ca2+]i change would therefore only be observed where the focal plane imaged passed through the nucleus. Several reports have suggested that differential [Ca2+] signals in the nucleus can be attributed to nuclear dye artifacts that are particularly prevalent with single wavelength fluorescent dyes such as OGB2 (17Thomas D. Tovey S.C. Collins T.J. Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Cell Calcium. 2000; 28: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). This is because the affinity of such dyes for Ca2+ may be affected by the different protein, ionic, pH, and osmotic environment in the nucleus compared with the cytosol. In an attempt to minimize potential dye artifacts and mimic a more physiological stimulus, intact parotid acinar cells were loaded with the ratiometric dye, fura-2, and stimulated with 300 nm CCh to track the spatiotemporal [Ca2+]i signals in a similar manner to Fig. 1A.Fig. 1, B and C, shows a bright field image, a SYTO-16-fluorescent image, pseudocolor-enhanced fluorescent ratio images (Fig. 1, Bi, panels A-H and Ci, panels A-H), and the corresponding kinetic profiles of CCh-evoked [Ca2+]i signals (Fig. 1, Bii and Cii) in the apical (blue), non-nuclear basal (green), and the nuclear region (red). The location of the nucleus was confirmed by staining cells with 1 μm SYTO-16 at the end of each experiment. Because [Ca2+] signals rapidly propagate from the apical region to the basal region of parotid acinar cells (5Giovannucci D.R. Bruce J.I. Straub S.V. Arreola J. Sneyd J. Shuttleworth T.J. Yule D.I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 540: 469-484Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), boxes for analysis of the nuclear and non-nuclear basal region were strategically placed equidistant from the apical region to reveal any delay in the nucleus. Although these experiments were not performed on a confocal microscope, care was taken to ensure that the focal plane was as close to the center of the nucleus as possible to avoid contamination from out-of-focus light coming from dye above and below the nucleus. Cells were discarded from analysis if the nucleus was out of focus. Fig. 1B shows an initial [Ca2+]i signal evoked by 300 nm CCh in the apical, basal, and nucleus of a typical control untreated cell. These data show that the CCh-evoked [Ca2+]i signal is significantly delayed in the nucleus compared with a corresponding non-nuclear basal region, thereby supporting preliminary data using flash photolysis of caged InsP3 (Fig. 1A). The time to half-maximum response was 0.19 ± 0.07 s slower in the basal region compared with the apical region, whereas the nuclear response was 0.47 ± 0.08 s slower than the apical region (Fig. 1B and Table I). This nuclear [Ca2+]i delay was quantified by subtracting the time between the half-maximum increase in the apical and non-nuclear basal region (A-B) from the time between the half-maximum increase in the apical and nuclear basal region (A-N) in every cell (Table I). On average, the nuclear Ca2+ delay was found to be 0.28 ± 0.1 s. The observed differences in the kinetics of CCh-evoked [Ca2+]i signals in the nucleus versus the non-nuclear basal region could be due to differential fura-2 compartmentalization into intracellular organelles. One might predict that this would be more pronounced in the non-nuclear basal region compared with the nucleus due to the presence of endoplasmic reticulum. The average fluorescence signal from this region would therefore be affected by the “saturated” fura-2 signal emitted from the endoplasmic reticulum. To test this, a series of pilot experiments were performed whereby fura-2-loaded cells were permeabilized by perfusing with a “cytosol-like” solution containing 0.4 IU/ml streptolysin-O (BD Biosciences), identical to that described previously (13Bruce J.I. Shuttleworth T.J. Giovannucci D.R. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1340-1348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Permeabilization caused a complete loss of cytosolic dye, as monitored by the fura-2 isosbestic 360-nm fluorescence signal (data not shown). Any residual fluorescence would most likely be due to dye trapped within the intracellular organelles. Under these conditions it was found that streptolysin-O treatment decreased fluorescence from 1166 ± 110 gray levels above background to 70 ± 12 gray levels above background (6 experiments, in which >4 cells were imaged). This was not significantly different from autofluorescence of non-loaded cells treated identically (fluorescence decreased from 63 ± 7 to 49 ± 8 gray levels above background; 6 experiments, in which >4 cells were imaged), confirming that fura-2 compartmentalization into intracellular organelles is unlikely to contribute to the nuclear [Ca2+] delay.Table ISummary of mean data from experiments shown in Fig. 1Control (n = 6)Ruthenium red (n = 4)Ru360 (n = 6)Apical time to peak (s)2.88 ± 0.181.81 ± 0.23ap < 0.05, significantly different from control parameter (unpaired Student's t test).2.08 ± 0.26ap < 0.05, significantly different from control parameter (unpaired Student's t test).Basal time to peak (s)3.11 ± 0.23bp < 0.0001, significantly different from apical (Wilcoxon test for pairs).1.86 ± 0.22ap < 0.05, significantly different from control parameter (unpaired Student's t test).2.07 ± 0.27ap < 0.05, significantly different from control parameter (unpaired Student's t test).Nucleus time to peak (s)3.50 ± 0.29bp < 0.0001, significantly different from apical (Wilcoxon test for pairs).1.92 ± 0.28ap < 0.05, significantly different from control parameter (unpaired Student's t test).2.16 ± 0.32ap < 0.05, significantly different from control parameter (unpaired Student's t test).Apical peak Δ ratio0.49 ± 0.070.42 ± 0.050.50 ± 0.03Basal peak Δ ratio0.38 ± 0.07bp < 0.0001, significantly different from apical (Wilcoxon test for pairs).0.40 ± 0.050.47 ± 0.03Nucleus peak Δ ratio0.39 ± 0.08bp < 0.0001, significantly different from apical (Wilcoxon test for pairs).0.40 ± 0.060.49 ± 0.04Time between 1/2max in apical and 1/2max in basal (A-B) (s)0.19 ± 0.070.15 ± 0.070.10 ± 0.02Time between 1/2max in apical and 1/2max in nucleus (A-N) (s)0.47 ± 0.08cp < 0.0001, significantly different from A-B (paired Student's t test).0.17 ± 0.07ap < 0.05, significantly different from control parameter (unpaired Student's t test).0.12 ± 0.04ap < 0.05, significantly different from control parameter (unpaired Student's t test).Nuclear delay (A-N)-(A-B) (s)0.28 ± 0.01dp < 0.0001, significantly different from zero (one sample t test).0.02 ± 0.01ap < 0.05, significantly different from control parameter (unpaired Student's t test).0.03 ± 0.03ap < 0.05, significantly different from control parameter (unpaired Student's t test).a p < 0.05, significantly different from control parameter (unpaired Student's t test).b p < 0.0001, significantly different from apical (Wilcoxon test for pairs).c p < 0.0001, significantly different from A-B (paired Student's t test).d p < 0.0001, significantly different from zero (one sample t test). Open table in a new tab The Delayed CCh-evoked Nuclear [Ca2+] Signals Are Abolished by Inhibition of Mitochondrial Ca2+ Uptake—To test if this nuclear [Ca2+] delay is due to mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake slowing the rate at which [Ca2+] increases in the nucleus, cells were pre-incubated with mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake inhibitors, RuRed and Ru360. Although RuRed is known to have nonspecific effects (18Ma J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 1031-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 19Kargacin G.J. Ali Z. Kargacin M.E. Pfluegers Arch. 1998; 436: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), a derivative Ru360 is a more specific and potent inhibitor of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake (14Matlib M.A. Zhou Z. Knight S. Ahmed S. Choi K.M. Krause-Bauer J. Phillips R. Altschuld R. Katsube Y. Sperelakis N. Bers D.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4949-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). At the concentrations and pre-incubation times tested, both RuRed and Ru360 have been shown previously (20Zhou Z. Bers D.M. Pfluegers Arch. 2002; 445: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) to inhibit significantly mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in intact cells. In the present study pre-incubation with either 30 μm RuRed or 10 μm Ru360 for 30 min prior to stimulation with CCh altered the kinetics of the CCh-evoked [Ca2+]i increase (Fig. 1C and Table I). Most important, the nuclear [Ca2+] delay was significantly reduced from 0.28 ± 0.1 s (n = 6) to 0.02 ± 0.01 s (n = 4) by RuRed and to 0.03 ± 0.03 s (n = 6) by Ru360 (Fig. 1C and Table I). Further analysis showed that both RuRed and Ru360 significantly reduced the time to peak response in all regions of the cell and abolished any spatial differences in the time to peak values (Table I). Moreover, in control cells the magnitude of the CCh-evoked [Ca2+]i response in the basal region (0.37 ± 0.07 ratio units) and nucleus (0.39 ± 0.08 ratio units) was significantly lower than the corresponding apical region (0.49 ± 0.07 ratio units), although there was no significant difference between all three regions of RuRed- or Ru360-treated cells (Table I). These data indicate that both the magnitude (in the basal and nuclear regions) and rate of Ca2+ release (in all cellular regions) are markedly increased by inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. These data are consistent with previous studies (21Hajnoczky G. Hager R. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14157-14162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) suggesting that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake suppresses the local feedback activation of Ca2+ release by buffering local [Ca2+]. One might also predict, from these data, that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake shapes [Ca2+]i signals in all regions of the cell consistent with a homogeneous distribution of mitochondria. However, upon closer examination, the effect of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake inhibitors was most striking in the nucleus. This is therefore consistent with perinuclear mitochondria providing a buffer barrier around the nucleus that impedes the"

To identify candidate regulatory pathway(s) linking drug exposure to up-regulation of fnbB, we disrupted the global response regulators agr, sarA, and recA in the highly quinolone-resistant strain RA1. Whereas agr and sarA mutants of RA1 exposed to CPX still displayed increased adhesion to fibronectin, the CPX-triggered response was abolished in the uvs-568 recA mutant, but was restored following complementation with wild type recA. Steady-state levels of recA and fnbB, but not fnbA, mRNA were co-coordinately increased >3-fold in CPX-exposed strain RA1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed specific binding of purified S. aureus SOS-repressor LexA to recA and fnbB, but not to fnbA or rpoB promoters. DNase I footprint analysis showed LexA binding overlapping the core promoter elements in fnbB. We conclude that activation of recA and derepression of lexA-regulated genes by CPX may represent a response to drug-induced damage that results in a novel induction of a virulence factor leading to increased bacterial tissue adherence.

Staphylococcus aureus is an important cause of infections that prolong the mean length of hospital stays and increase mortality significantly (1Pittet D. Wenzel R.P. Arch. Intern. Med. 1995; 155: 1177-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 2Vaudaux P. Francois P. Lew D.P. Waldvogel F.A. Waldvogel F.A. Bisno A.L. Infections Associated with Indwelling Medical Devices. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2000: 1-26Google Scholar). Implanted biomaterials, such as indwelling catheters and orthopedic devices, also become rapidly coated with plasma proteins, predominantly fibrinogen and fibronectin (2Vaudaux P. Francois P. Lew D.P. Waldvogel F.A. Waldvogel F.A. Bisno A.L. Infections Associated with Indwelling Medical Devices. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2000: 1-26Google Scholar). Adhesion of S. aureus to these extracellular matrix or coated implants is a crucial step in the early stage of infection. S. aureus and many other bacterial species express surface adhesins collectively called microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs) 1The abbreviations used are: MSCRAMMs, microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules; CPX, ciprofloxacin; FnBP, fibronectin-binding protein; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentrations. that specifically recognize particular plasma or extracellular matrix proteins (3Patti J.M. Allen B.L. McGavin M.J. Höök M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 585-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Of these, two distinct, but related, fibronectin-binding protein genes in S. aureus, fnbA and fnbB, have been cloned and analyzed. These two adjacent genes appear partly redundant because both must be inactivated to eliminate fibronectin adhesion (4Greene C. McDevitt D. François P. Vaudaux P. Lew D.P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Several complex regulons, notably agr and sarA, regulate fibronectin-binding proteins (FnBPs) and other surface proteins (5Novick R.P Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1429-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). During the exponential phase, sarA can up-regulate fnb genes, whereas in contrast, agr, which is activated by an octapeptide quorum-sensing signal, down-regulates fnb genes during the post-exponential phase by a short regulatory RNA, RNAIII (5Novick R.P Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1429-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). Studies also suggest that sigB, which encodes a stress σ factor, σB (6Kullik I. Giachino P. Fuchs T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4814-4820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is involved in the regulation of both the sarA and agr loci (7Manna A.C. Bayer M.G. Cheung A.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3828-3836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gertz S. Engelmann S. Schmid R. Ziebandt A.K. Tischer K. Scharf C. Hacker J. Hecker M. J.

Fibronectin-binding protein expression therefore remains incompletely explained and is a consequence of complex interplay of multiple regulatory elements. Subinhibitory concentrations of various antibiotics on S. aureus can also affect the production of virulence factors such as FnBPs (10Proctor R.A. Hamill R.J. Mosher D.F. Textor J.A. Olbrantz P.J. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1983; 12: 85-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Proctor R.A. Olbrantz P.J. Mosher D.F. Antimicrob.

Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 2817-2823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The acquisition of drug resistance determinants, such as the methicillin resistance mec-element, may alter the expression of surface adhesins (15Vaudaux P.E. Monzillo V. Francois P. Lew D.P. Foster T.J. Berger-Bächi B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 564-570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fluoroquinolones are widely used clinical antibiotics, but shortly after their introduction, resistant strains of S. aureus appeared, in particular among methicillin-resistant strains (16Hooper D.C. Lancet Infect. Dis. 2002; 2: 530-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). High level resistance to fluoroquinolones in S. aureus involves combined mutations in two distinct chromosomal loci: grlA, the gene coding for the topoisomerase IV A subunit GrlA, and in gyrA, the gene coding for DNA gyrase A subunit GyrA (16Hooper D.C. Lancet Infect. Dis. 2002; 2: 530-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that the exposure of a grlA gyrA mutant of S. aureus to subminimal inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of ciprofloxacin (CPX) significantly increased the surface FnBPs, and also concomitantly led to increased bacterial attachment to both in vitro fibronectin- and ex vivo coated polymethylmethacrylate coverslips (17Bisognano C. Vaudaux P.E. Lew D.P. Ng E.Y. Hooper D.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 906-913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bisognano C. Vaudaux P. Rohner P. Lew D.P. Hooper D.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1428-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This response to CPX was more robust in the grlA gyrA double mutant than in single gyrA or grlA mutants, or in their isogenic quinolone-susceptible parents. Increased adhesion resulting from growth in the presence of CPX was also observed in clinical isolates of fluoroquinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant, and methicillin-sensitive (18Bisognano C. Vaudaux P. Rohner P. Lew D.P. Hooper D.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1428-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) strains, which suggested a general, rather than strain-specific, response to the drug. Promoter fusions to luciferase suggested that CPX preferentially up-regulated fnbB, but not fnbA in vivo. The drug-induced effect on fnbB was abolished by rifampin, which further suggested that the cellular response to the drug was mediated at the transcriptional level. Bacterial exposure to antibiotics may trigger several types of stress responses including the SOS response (19VanBogelen R.A. Kelley P.M. Neidhardt F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 26-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two major regulatory genes of the classical SOS response have been described in detail: lexA (also called dinR in Bacillus subtilis) and recA (20Walker G.C. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. Vol. 2. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1987: 1346-1357Google Scholar, 21Winterling K.W. Chafin D. Hayes J.J. Sun J. Levine A.S. Yasbin R.E. Woodgate R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2201-2211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Courcelle J. Khodursky A. Peter B. Brown P.O. Hanawalt P.C. Genetics. 2001; 158: 41-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Classically, derepression of the SOS-response genes occurs when RecA, in response to genotoxic damage, is activated. RecA then serves as a coprotease to aid LexA repressor autocleavage thus provoking the subsequent induction of an ensemble of DNA repair and recombination genes. LexA affinity for each targeted promoter is variable and some genes may be partially induced, whereas others remain repressed until high or persistent DNA damages occur (23Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 975-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, the SOS response may represent a graded monitor of the inducing environmental stress rather than a simple on-off switch (22Courcelle J. Khodursky A. Peter B. Brown P.O. Hanawalt P.C. Genetics. 2001; 158: 41-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sutton M.D. Smith B.T. Godoy V.G. Walker G.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 479-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Because fluoroquinolones are DNA-damaging agents, DNA repair mechanisms and/or homologous recombination are likely to be activated. Whereas sporadic reports provided evidence of SOS induction by fluoroquinolone exposure in various bacterial species, the predominant use of high and rapidly bactericidal antibiotic concentrations limited the physiological significance of these observations (25Phillips I. Culebras E. Moreno F. Baquero F. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1987; 20: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 26Power E.G. Phillips I. J. Med.

In this study, we sought to identify molecular pathway(s) that linked sub-MICs CPX exposure to transcriptional up-regulation of FnBP(s) expression in highly fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. Combined genetic and biochemical approaches suggest that both RecA and LexA are specifically implicated in the mechanism linking fluoroquinolone exposure and fnbB virulence factor up-regulation. Importantly, our results suggest that the LexA-SOS regulon in S. aureus comprises more than genes strictly involved in recombination and DNA repair and extends to include a novel regulation of an MSCRAMM virulence factor.

Vaudaux P.E. Lew D.P. Ng E.Y. Hooper D.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 906-913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Dunn procedure for comparison of specific groups (32Vaudaux P. Francois P. Bisognano C. Kelley W.L. Lew D.P. Schrenzel J. Proctor R.A. McNamara P. Peters G. Von Eiff C. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 5428-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Comparisons were considered significant when all increases or decreases accumulated for three coating concentrations of fibronectin yielded p values <0.05 with two-tailed significance. Quantitative Steady-state mRNA Analysis—Total RNA was prepared using the RNeasy™ midi-Kit (Qiagen), or the FastRNA kit Blue (Bio 101, Inc.) in conditions minimizing RNA degradation (33Cheung A.L. Eberhardt K.J. Fischetti V.A. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 511-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). RNA was quantified using the Platinum™ quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR kit (Invitrogen). PrimerExpress (Applied Biosystems) was used to design primers and probes, which were used at 0.2 and 0.1 μm, respectively. The primer sets were: 5′-caccgaaaactgtgcaagca and 5′-ttcctgtagtttccttatcagcaactt for fnbB; 5′-acaagttgaagtggcacagcc and 5′-ccgctacatctgctgatcttgtc for fnbA; 5′-agactcagttgctgctttaacacct and 5′-tacgtaacgcttgtgacattaaacg for recA; and 5′-ggcaagcgttatccggaatt and 5′-gtttccaatgaccctccacg for the 16 S rRNA of S. aureus. 5′-FAM and a 3′-TAMRA derivatized probes were: 5′-tagaaacttcgcgagttgatttgccatcg for fnbB; 5′-agaacggcatcagaaagtaagccacgtg for fnbA; 5′-aaggagaaatgggagacactcacgttggt for recA; and 5′-cctacgcgcgctttacgccca for 16 S rRNA. Data were acquired on an ABI Prism 7700 and analyzed with Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems). Total RNA in each sample was normalized to 16 S rRNA. Genetic Manipulations—Transduction was performed using bacteriophage ϕ85 or ϕ80α. Transformation of genomic DNA and electroporation were performed as described (28Stahl M.L. Pattee P.A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 406-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lee J.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 47: 209-216PubMed Google Scholar). RA1 was constructed using high molecular weight DNA prepared from SS1 to transform EN1252a. Transformants were screened for loss of erythromycin resistance but retention of novobiocin resistance. The removal of the erythromycin marker exerted no significant influence on fnbB gene activation and promotion of fibronectin-mediated adhesion by 1/8 of the MIC of CPX. The recA uvs-568 allele (29Bayles K.W. Brunskill E.W. Iandolo J.J. Hruska L.L. Huang S. Pattee P.A. Smiley B.K. Yasbin R.E. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 147: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was transduced from strain BF10 into RA1 by a tight association (95%) with Tn551. Strains ALC355, ALC637, and ALC2057 were used to transduce Δagr::tetM, or sarA::Tn917LTV1 and sarA::kan, respectively, to RA1. Genotypes were verified using a PCR assay. For chromosomal insertions, plasmids pCL84, pCB1, or pCB2 were first transferred into CYL316 (31Lee C.Y. Buranen S.L. Ye Z.H. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 103: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Plasmid geh integrates were then transferred by generalized transduction with phage ϕ85 to strain RA1, followed by a second step transfer of uvs-568. Transductants were screened for failure to express lipase activity with Bacto Spirit Blue Agar (Difco). UV sensitivity was evaluated with increasing UV (254 nm) from 0 to 5 s using an XL1000 Spectrolinker (Spectronics Corporation) at 15 cm and 7200 μJ cm-2. Recombinant DNA Methods—Genomic DNA from RA1 was purified as described (18Bisognano C. Vaudaux P. Rohner P. Lew D.P. Hooper D.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1428-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The recA+ gene was PCR amplified using primers: 5′-cgggatcccgaagattattaaattggcttagaaca-3′ and 5′-cggaattccgctactattttctaaagttttgaagc-3′ corresponding to nucleotides -156 to -131 and +1261 to +1286, respectively, of contig 8104 in the TIGR S. aureus COL data base. 2www.tigr.org. EcoRI and BamHI (underlined) sites were incorporated in the primers and the PCR product was cloned into EcoRI-BamHI-cleaved pCL84 to yield plasmid pCB1. The recA sequence was verified from two independent isolates and was identical to the composite recA sequence published previously (29Bayles K.W. Brunskill E.W. Iandolo J.J. Hruska L.L. Huang S. Pattee P.A. Smiley B.K. Yasbin R.E. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 147: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) except for one silent mutation in codon 260. Plasmid pCB2 was constructed using the QuikChange™ method (Stratagene). Complementary primers that inserted 5 bp, including an EcoRI restriction site resulting in a frame shift from RecA-codon 34, were: (5′-gtgacaatataggtgaattcgccgagtttcaac-3′ and 5′-gttgaaactcggcgaattcacctatattgtcac-3′. The S. aureus lexA gene was PCR-amplified using a 5′ primer that introduced the NdeI restriction site (underlined) at the initial ATG codon 5′-cgggaattccatATGagagaattaacaaaacgac-3′. The downstream primer contained a XhoI site (underlined), 5′-ccgctcgagcggttacatttcgcggtacaaaccaattac-3′. The product was cleaved with NdeI and XhoI and ligated with pET20b+ (Novagen). The expression clone was sequence verified. The promoters of recA, rpoB, fnbA, and fnbB were PCR-amplified using primers that incorporated upstream EcoRI and downstream SmaI, or BamHI, sites (underlined). Amplified product sizes are indicated: 5′-ggaattccttggcttagaacaacaaattaattg-3′ and 5′-tcccccgggggataaagctttttgacgatcgttatcc-3′ for precA (230 bp); 5′-cgggatcccgagcttgaaatgaaatggatattctg-3′ and 5′-cggaattccagattcacccctcaaaaattatgt-3′ for prpoB (238 bp); primers for FnbA and FnbB were as described (4Greene C. McDevitt D. François P. Vaudaux P. Lew D.P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and yielded 425- and 465-bp products, respectively. PCR products were digested and were cloned in pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene). All promoter clones were sequence verified. Luciferase Assays—Luciferase activity was measured as described (4Greene C. McDevitt D. François P. Vaudaux P. Lew D.P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 18Bisognano C. Vaudaux P. Rohner P. Lew D.P. Hooper D.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1428-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The specific light units were determined by normalization of the relative light units by the A540 nm of the culture at the time of sampling. Purification of S. aureus LexA—BL21 (λDE3)/pLysE (Novagen) carrying pCB3 was diluted 1:100 into LB broth supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and grown at 37 °C until A600 = 0.8. Cells were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, grown for an additional 3 h, harvested, and then resuspended in ice-cold Buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10% sucrose). Lysozyme was added to 0.2 mg/ml and the cells were incubated on ice for 30 min and then quick frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cells were thawed on ice, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and β-mercaptoethanol were added to 1 and 2 mm, respectively. The lysate was sonicated to reduce viscosity, then centrifuged at 100,000 × g in a Beckman 60 Ti rotor for 30 min. Polyethyleneimine was added to a final concentration of 1% (v/v) and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g (Sorvall HB6) for 10 min. The supernatant was recovered and solid ammonium sulfate (0.331 g/ml, 55% w/v) was added. The extract was centrifuged at 15,000 × g (Sorvall HB6) for 15 min and the pellet was resuspended in a minimal volume of ice-cold Buffer B (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Fraction I). Fraction I was loaded onto a 15-ml heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in Buffer B. The flow-through was collected and dialyzed against 1 liter of Buffer C (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). One and a half volumes of Buffer C without NaCl was added to the dialysate and the solution was loaded immediately onto an 80-ml P11-phosphocellulose (Whatman) column equilibrated in Buffer D (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The column was washed with 5 bed volumes of Buffer D, then eluted with a linear gradient 0.2 m to 1 m NaCl in Buffer D. The majority of LexA eluted at 0.4 m NaCl (Fraction II). Peak fractions were pooled, diluted with 2 volumes of Buffer D, and immediately applied to a hydroxyapatite column (20 ml) equilibrated in Buffer D. The column was washed with 5 bed volumes of Buffer B, then LexA was eluted with a linear gradient of 20 mm to 0.4 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, in Buffer D. The majority of LexA eluted at 0.2 m potassium phosphate (Fraction III). Peak fractions were pooled, dialyzed overnight against 2 liters of Buffer E (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol), and concentrated using Centriprep-10 columns (Millipore). The dialysate was adjusted to 50% glycerol and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford assay and bovine serum albumin standards. The Fraction III protein was greater than 95% pure as judged by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels. The specific activity (3000 units/mg) was defined as the amount of LexA required to gel shift 5 fmol of radiolabeled precA promoter fragment. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—DNA fragments were generated by digesting plasmids pCB4, pCB5, pCB6, pCB7, and pCB8 with HpaII, or with HpaII and SapI for pCB5. The fragments were 3′-radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP. Labeled fragments were incubated with the indicated amounts of purified LexA in binding buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 4 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA) containing 1 μg of poly (dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) in a final volume of 50 μl. Binding reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, then analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide gels and autoradiographed. For quantitative gel shifts 10 pm of each promoter fragment prepared by PCR was 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase to a specific activity of 107 cpm/μg. LexA was serially diluted in binding buffer supplemented with 100 μg/ml gelatin. DNase I Footprinting—The promoters of recA and fnbB were re-PCR amplified from pCB4 and pCB5. Fragments were 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and divided into two aliquots. pCB4 was digested with ClaI, or HindIII; pCB5 was digested with HincII, or DdeI. Fragments were gel purified and desalted. LexA binding reactions were assembled on ice as described for gel shift analysis. DNase I (Amersham Biosciences) conditions were titrated in pilot cleavage reactions. Reactions were terminated by adding 12.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, and Proteinase K at 0.4 mg/ml, extracted with phenol-chloroform, and ethanol precipitated using 0.4 mg/ml glycogen carrier. DNA pellets were resuspended in loading buffer (98% deionized formamide, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.025% (w/v) xylene cyanol FF, and 0.025% (w/v) bromphenol blue), applied on 6% sequencing gels, dried, and autoradiographed. Dideoxy sequencing marker ladders for each fragment were run in parallel and prepared using the same primers as for PCR. Inactivation of recA, but Not agr or sarA, Abolishes the CPX-promoted Fibronectin Adhesion of Fluoroquinolone-resistant S. aureus—To evaluate the role of global regulators agr and sarA on drug-induced enhanced attachment to fibronectin, null mutants in strain RA1 were tested in the absence or presence of subinhibitory levels of CPX. We observed that promotion of fibronectin-mediated adhesion by growth in the presence of 1/8 of the MIC of CPX (4 μg/ml) was significant (p < 0.05) and equivalent when comparing strains RA1 and RA1 Δagr::tetM (hereafter RA1agr) after growth in the presence of antibiotic (Fig. 1). Whereas adhesion of RA1 sarA::Tn917LTV1 (hereafter RA1sarA) after growth in CPX-free medium was markedly lower than adhesion of either RA1 or RA1agr, we observed that the CPX-promoted increase in fibronectin-mediated attachment was higher with strain RA1sarA (about 7-fold) than with strains RA1 or RA1agr (about 2-fold) (Fig. 1). The lower relative adhesion of RA1sarA when grown in CPX-free medium compared with strains RA1 and RA1agr can be explained, in part, by (a) the previously reported down-regulation of fnbA transcription in a sarA mutant of S. aureus (35Wolz C. Pöhlmann-Dietze P. Steinhuber A. Chien Y.T. Manna A. Van Wamel W. Cheung A. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 230-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and also by (b) the derepression of sarA-regulated extracellular proteases known to accelerate degradation of cell surface proteins such as FnBP (36Karlsson A. Saravia-Otten P. Tegmark K. Morfeldt E. Arvidson S. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4742-4748Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We also observed a stimulation of the fnbB promoter in RA1sarA strain with 1/8 of the MIC of CPX using an independent pfnbB-luxAB reporter assay (data not shown). Collectively, we conclude that insertional inactivation of either agr or sarA does not abolish CPX-induced fnbB expression. The contribution of recA to the CPX-induced up-regulation of FnBP was analyzed next. The introduction of the uvs-568 recA mutation in strain RA1 (hereafter RA1recA) led to increased UV sensitivity (data not shown) and decreased fluoroquinolone resistance, as assessed by a 16-fold decrease in CPX MIC in RA1recA compared with RA1, RA1agr, and RA1sarA. Inactivation of recA did not significantly alter its adhesion profile compared with its parent RA1 in the absence of drug treatment (data not shown). However, when RA1recA was grown in the presence of either ¼ (not shown) or 1/8 of the MIC of CPX, drug-dependent promotion of fibronectin-mediated adhesion was abolished (Fig. 1). This result suggested that recA was involved in the mechanism linking CPX exposure to induction of a virulence adhesion. We also tested a RA1sarA/recA double mutant constructed using an alternative sarA::kan null allele that was phenotypically comparable in RA1 to the sarA:: Tn917LTV1 mutant (not shown). Our results show"
https://openalex.org/W2015912130,"A novel approach to study coupling of substrate and ion fluxes is presented. EmrE is an H+-coupled multidrug transporter from Escherichia coli. Detergent-solubilized EmrE binds substrate with high affinity in a pH-dependent mode. Here we show, for the first time in an ion-coupled transporter, substrate-induced release of protons in a detergent-solubilized preparation. The direct measurements allow for an important quantitation of the phenomenon. Thus, stoichiometry of the release in the wild type and a mutant with a single carboxyl at position 14 is very similar and about 0.8 protons/monomer. The findings demonstrate that the only residue involved in proton release is a highly conserved membrane-embedded glutamate (Glu-14) and that all the Glu-14 residues in the EmrE functional oligomer participate in proton release. Furthermore, from the pH dependence of the release we determined the pK of Glu-14 as 8.5 and for an aspartate replacement at the same position as 6.7. The high pK of the carboxyl at position 14 is essential for coupling of fluxes of protons and substrates. A novel approach to study coupling of substrate and ion fluxes is presented. EmrE is an H+-coupled multidrug transporter from Escherichia coli. Detergent-solubilized EmrE binds substrate with high affinity in a pH-dependent mode.

The high pK of the carboxyl at position 14 is essential for coupling of fluxes of protons and substrates. Coupling of ion and substrate fluxes allows for concentrative transport across biological membranes, a process highly relevant to human physiology and disease. Obligatory coupling of fluxes at the mechanistic level implies that one of the steps in the catalytic cycle cannot occur in the absence of one of the reactants. In an effort to identify the molecular basis of coupling, binding and release of substrates and coupling ions has been studied using several approaches. These include measurements of transient electrical responses (e.g. Ref. 1Loo D. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), substrate-induced changes in accessibility or reactivity of specific residues (e.g. Ref. 2Sahin-Toth M. Karlin A. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10729-10732Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and binding of inhibitors to the membrane-bound or detergent-solubilized proteins (e.g. Ref. 3Humphreys C. Beidler D. Rudnick G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, despite the important information provided by this type of studies, most of them are either indirect or they are done in the membrane where it may be difficult to isolate the binding reaction from other steps in the catalytic cycle. In this work we measure directly for the first time substrate-induced proton release in a detergent-solubilized transporter. EmrE, a proton-coupled multidrug transporter from Escherichia coli, is used as the experimental model system (4Schuldiner S. Granot D. Mordoch S.S. Ninio S. Rotem D. Soskin M. Tate C.G. Yerushalmi H. News Physiol. Sci. 2001; 16: 130-134PubMed Google Scholar, 5Schuldiner S. Granot D. Steiner S. Ninio S. Rotem D. Soskin M. Yerushalmi H. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 155-162PubMed Google Scholar). It is a small transporter, 110 amino acids long, that extrudes various drugs in exchange for protons, thereby rendering bacteria resistant to these drugs (4Schuldiner S. Granot D. Mordoch S.S. Ninio S. Rotem D. Soskin M. Tate C.G. Yerushalmi H. News Physiol. Sci. 2001; 16: 130-134PubMed Google Scholar, 5Schuldiner S. Granot D. Steiner S. Ninio S. Rotem D. Soskin M. Yerushalmi H. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 155-162PubMed Google Scholar). The protein functions as an oligomer and has been characterized, purified, and reconstituted in a functional form (6Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The detergent-solubilized EmrE is quite unique in its ability to bind substrates with high affinity; therefore, it provides an experimental system to study also proton release. In addition, the size of the protein allows identification of the residue involved in this reaction. EmrE has only one membrane-embedded charged residue, Glu-14, which is conserved in more than 100 homologous proteins (7Ninio S. Rotem D. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48250-48256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 8Ninio S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12000-12005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Carboxylic residues embedded in the membrane were shown to be important for activity in various ion-coupled transporters. In some cases, these carboxyls are involved in substrate recognition and binding; in others, they are part of the coupling ion binding site (reviewed in Refs. 9Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14711-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar and 10Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). EmrE is unique in that a single carboxyl is involved in recognition of both substrate and the coupling ion (11Yerushalmi H. Mordoch S.S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12744-12748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Substrate binding increases dramatically between pH 6.5 and 8.0, suggesting that deprotonation of the site is required (9Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14711-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 12Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Conversely, release of substrate from the protein is accelerated at low pH values, suggesting that protonation is required for efficient release (12Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). When Glu-14 is replaced with Asp, substrate binding and release are practically independent of pH in the range 6.5–8.0 (12Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This is most likely because the Asp at position 14 has a lower pK, and therefore the protein is largely deprotonated above pH 6.0. The findings described above have been substantiated for the transport cycle through experiments with proteoliposomes reconstituted with purified wild type and mutant proteins (13Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5264-5269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we have proposed that the mutual dependence for interaction with EmrE is the molecular basis of coupling between protons and substrates fluxes (9Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14711-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 10Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Direct observation of the substrate-induced proton release allows for quantitation of the reaction. The stoichiometry and the pH dependence of the reaction were measured in the wild type protein as well as in two other mutants: a protein with a single carboxyl at position 14 and one with a carboxyl that displays a lower pK. We conclude that the glutamyl residue at position 14 in the wild type protein is the only amino acid involved in proton release and that all the Glu-14 residues in the oligomer participate in the release reaction. The pK of the carboxyls involved was measured from the pH dependence of the release reaction. The high pK of the carboxyl at position 14 is essential for coupling fluxes of protons and substrates. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—E. coli TA15 (14Goldberg E.B. Arbel T. Chen J. Karpel R. Mackie G.A. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells were transformed with plasmid pGP1–2, which encodes for the regulated expression of T7 polymerase under the inducible control of the λ PL promoter (15Tabor S. Richardson C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar). The plasmids used for EmrE gene expression are pT7–7 (15Tabor S. Richardson C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar) derivatives with the hexahistidine tag using a Myc epitope as linker (12Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Throughout this paper, for simplicity, Myc- and His-tagged protein is named EmrE. The E14D-EmrE and E25C/D84C-EmrE (SC-EmrE, single carboxyl construct) mutants were previously characterized (11Yerushalmi H. Mordoch S.S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12744-12748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 12Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Overexpression and Purification of EmrE—E. coli TA15 cells that bear plasmids pGP1–2 and pT7–7 containing His-tagged EmrE constructs were grown at 30 °C in minimal medium A supplemented with 2.5 μg/ml thiamine, 0.5% glycerol, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. When the culture reached A600 = 1, the temperature was elevated rapidly to 42 °C to allow for T7 polymerase expression for 15 min, and then the temperature was decreased back to 30 °C. Two hours later the cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed once with buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose before storage at –70 °C. For membrane preparation, cells were resuspended in the same buffer containing 2.5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 15 μg/ml DNaseI, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (5 ml of buffer/g cells). Membranes were prepared by disrupting the cells using a Microfluidics microfluidizer processor (M-110EHi). Nondisrupted cells were discarded by centrifugation (4225 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), and the membranes were collected by centrifugation at 240,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was washed and resuspended in 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (membrane protein concentration ∼20 mg/ml), frozen in liquid air, and stored at –70 °C. Wild type EmrE and the mutants were purified by solubilizing membranes (∼5 mg of protein/ml) in 1% DDM, 1The abbreviations used are: DDM, n-dodecyl-β-maltoside; TPP+, tetraphenylphosphonium; DCCD, N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide; EmrE, EmrE tagged with Myc epitope and six His residues; SC-EmrE, EmrE with only one carboxyl at position 14. 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 40 min at 25 °C. Unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation at 240,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. In the case of SC-EmrE, β-mercaptoethanol (15 mm) was added throughout purification to prevent cysteine crosslinking. The solubilized protein was loaded on HiTrap™ chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) mounted on Akta Explorer (Amersham Biosciences) and washed with 0.08% DDM, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris-HCl, and 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.5 till A280 of the flowthrough decreased below 0.05. EmrE was eluted with a gradient of up to 300 mm imidazole. Major peak fractions were pooled, and the protein solution was brought to ∼10 mg/ml EmrE (according to A280). Concentrations of imidazole and Tris were decreased below 1 mm through a series of dilution-concentration cycles with 0.08% DDM and 150 mm NaCl solution using a 30-kDa cutoff Centriprep (AmiconR Bioseparations). The protein stock was aliquoted, frozen in liquid air, and stored at –70 °C. H+ Assay—Measurements were carried out at 20 °C in a glass cell with magnetic stirring, and a stream of argon was applied to decrease the effect of CO2 on pH. pH was monitored using pHC4000–8 microelectrode (Radiometer Analytical) connected to a PHM240 pH meter (MeterLab™, Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark). Data were recorded using WINview CP Series RS232 data acquisition software (SuperLogics). The solution containing 0.4–4 μm EmrE (7–70 μg), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.08% DDM was brought to the pH of interest by addition of diluted NaOH or acetic acid. To assay proton release, TPP+ (4 nmol or other substrate in saturating amounts) was added and followed after 60–100 s by 5 nmol NaOH that was used as an internal standard to calculate the absolute amount of the protons released. On this small range of pH changes, the relation between amount of released (consumed) protons and the solution pH was assumed linear. The calculation of the actual changes after substrate or NaOH addition was done from the digital recorded traces using linear regression to compensate for pH drifts. DCCD Inhibition—The protein stock was diluted to 4 μm in the assay solution, titrated to pH 6.5 with diluted NaOH, and incubated with 200 μm DCCD for 2 h in glass tubes with magnetic stirring before the measurement. Substrate-induced H+ Release in Wild Type and Mutants— Addition of saturating concentrations of the high affinity substrate TPP+ to unbuffered detergent-solubilized EmrE (pH 7.0) induces a rapid acidification of the medium of about 0.15 pH units (Fig. 1A). The absolute amount of protons released is calculated from calibration with an aliquot of NaOH and is about equimolar to the EmrE monomers. To show that this is a property related to the protein function, EmrE was pretreated with DCCD, a hydrophobic carbodiimide that covalently reacts with Glu-14 and prevents substrate binding and transport (11Yerushalmi H. Mordoch S.S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12744-12748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, DCCD also blocks the TPP+-induced H+ release. Furthermore, when the E14C-EmrE mutant, a protein that does not bind substrate (12Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), replaces the wild type protein no acidification is detected upon addition of TPP+ (Fig. 1C). To further characterize the reaction, other substrates of EmrE were tested for their ability to induce proton release. This is shown in Fig. 2, A–D for saturating concentrations of ethidium, a substrate with a lower affinity, tetraphenyl antimonium (TPSb+), acriflavine, and dequalinium salts. The saturation is demonstrated in Fig. 2A where a further aliquot of substrate does not bring on release. In addition, the two substrates compete for the same site because addition of TPP+ after TPSb+ does not provoke release. We conclude that the H+ release reaction described above reflects a step in the catalytic cycle of EmrE that involves deprotonation of one or more residues in the EmrE protein. Stoichiometry of H+ Released per Monomer in Wild Type and in a Protein with a Single Carboxyl—The amount of protons released increased linearly with the increase of TPP concentration and saturates at about ∼ 3–5 μm (data not shown). The concentration of TPP+ required to elicit maximal response is in the same concentration range as EmrE. Albeit this concentration is well above the affinity of EmrE to TPP+ at pH 7.0 (about 50 nm), it is necessary to saturate the high EmrE concentration used in these experiments. At a saturating concentration of TPP+, the dependence of proton release on protein concentration is linear in the range tested, 0.33–4.0 μm (0.4–4.8 nmol, Fig. 3A, diamonds). The results demonstrate that at these conditions ∼0.8 protons are released per EmrE monomer. The same stoichiometry was observed when ethidium, another substrate of EmrE, was used to elicit proton release (Fig. 3A, circles). Wild type EmrE contains three carboxyls: Glu-14 in the membrane domain and Glu-25 and Asp-84 in the loops. In previous work SC-EmrE, a mutant with a single carboxyl residue at position 14, was shown to display binding and transport abilities very similar to those of the wild type protein (11Yerushalmi H. Mordoch S.S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12744-12748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and it was suggested that Glu-14 is the only carboxyl needed for coupling of proton and substrate fluxes. To test directly the contention that the protons are released from Glu-14, the protein was purified and challenged with substrate. The SC-EmrE protein displays proton release of a magnitude similar to that of the wild type protein. As shown in Fig. 3B, the dependence of proton release on protein concentration was linear in the range tested and the stoichiometry in these experiments was 0.74 H+/mol SC-EmrE, only slightly lower than that displayed by the wild type protein. The pH Dependence of H+ Release Allows Estimation of pK of Glu-14 —The studies described above were performed at pH 7.0, where the response to substrate was maximal. The magnitude of release varied significantly at different pH values. The results in Fig. 4A demonstrate a bell shape response with a maximum at around pH 7.0. A very small response is detected at pH 5.2, which increases with increase in pH up to about pH 7.0–7.2 and then decreases to nearly undetectable values at pH 9.0 and above. The pH dependence is virtually identical when SC-EmrE is used (Fig. 4B, squares), suggesting that the pH dependence reflects mainly the affinity of Glu-14 to protons (Fig. 5, step 1) relative to the affinity of TPP+ (Fig. 5, step 2). Because all the release is from Glu-14, we conclude that at pH 7.0 and below the carboxyl is practically fully protonated in the absence of substrate and becomes fully deprotonated upon addition of saturating substrate concentrations. The decrease in proton release at alkaline pH values is not due to decreased TPP+ binding because this increases with increasing pH and plateaus up to very high pH values (11Yerushalmi H. Mordoch S.S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12744-12748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 12Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We propose that the decrease is due to a lower fraction of protonated Glu-14 and that this is a reflection of the pK of this residue. This is a spontaneous reaction, independent of the presence of substrate (Fig. 5, step 1). From the decrease in substrate-dependent release, we can therefore estimate a pK. The point at which the ratio of proton released per monomer is half maximal is around pH 8.3–8.5 (Fig. 4A). On the other side of the scale, at acidic pH values, we propose that the lower response is due to the increase in proton concentration that hinders release from a carboxyl with very high and unusual affinity to protons. Indeed, this suggestion is borne out by two results. 1) The TPP+ concentration used in these experiments (3 μm) is saturating at pH 7 and above. At lower pH values, TPP+ concentrations as high as 1 mm are needed to induce maximal response (Fig. 4A, inset). 2) Correspondingly, when the affinity to protons changes such as in E14D-EmrE (carboxyl with lower pK), the protein is capable of robust H+ release at pH values as low as 4.5 (Fig. 4B, filled circles). The response increases and peaks between pH 5.8 and 6.0 and decreases thereafter at increasing pH values. Following the reasoning discussed above, we estimate the pK of the carboxyl in the E14D-EmrE mutant as around 6.5, the point where the release decreases to 50% of the maximal value. This may be an overestimate because the magnitude of the maximal release was about 0.5 mol/mol EmrE, lower than the values observed with wild type EmrE. This is possibly due also to competition between protons and substrate and other nonspecific effects of the low pH that may prevent the protein from reaching its maximal activity.Fig. 5Kinetic model of the transport cycle. EmrE (C) releases H+ (step 1) prior to substrate binding (step 2). It then translocates the substrate to the trans face of the membrane (step 3). Proton binding (step 4) accelerates substrate release (step 5). When the binding site is protonated (step 6) or occupied by substrate (step 3) it can face either side of the membrane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this report, we describe substrate-induced proton release in a detergent-solubilized preparation of EmrE, a multidrug transporter from E. coli. Detergent-solubilized EmrE binds substrate with high affinity in a pH-dependent fashion (12Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The above findings and further characterization of the response in a single carboxyl mutant (11Yerushalmi H. Mordoch S.S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12744-12748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) implied that deprotonation of Glu-14 is necessary to allow substrate binding. The experiments described here directly demonstrate the above contention and allow quantitation and characterization of the H+ release reaction. Thus, the stoichiometry of the release and the pH dependence were measured in the wild type protein as well as in a fully active mutant with a single carboxyl at position 14 (SC-EmrE) and a mutant with a carboxyl with a lower pK (E14D-EmrE). In SC-EmrE there are only two other residues besides Glu-14 that could act as potential proton donors or acceptors: Lys-22 and His-110. His-110 is the carboxyl-terminal amino acid and was previously modified to Cys or completely removed with no impairment whatsoever of the activity (13Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5264-5269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Lys-22 is fully conserved in the SMR family (7Ninio S. Rotem D. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48250-48256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but replacement with Arg yielded a protein with activity practically indistinguishable from the wild type (13Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5264-5269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Even the Cys replacement was functional though its activity was lower than that of the wild type (13Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5264-5269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Therefore, the results presented here unequivocally demonstrate that proton release is solely from the carboxyl of the glutamyl residue at position 14. In addition, a replacement with Asp at position 14 results in a mutant with a lower pK and modified pH dependence of all the reactions tested. We can therefore conclude that the pH dependence of EmrE is dictated solely by the unusually high pK of the carboxyl at position 14. Substrate binds (Fig. 5, step 2) only to the deprotonated EmrE species (9Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14711-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 10Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Substrate binding at high pH does not induce release because deprotonation (Fig. 5, step 1) occurs spontaneously as dictated by the pK of Glu-14. At lower pH values substrate binding shifts the equilibrium as dictated by simple mass laws. Binding to a protein that has already lost its proton would seem not productive from the point of view of coupling of substrate and proton fluxes. However, the finding that the rate of substrate release is accelerated at high proton concentrations (12Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) suggests that release of the substrate at the trans side of the membrane (Fig. 5, step 5) is dependent on prior binding of a proton to the site (step 4). This fact provides another site for obligatory coupling between substrate and proton interaction with the protein. In the case of the E14D mutant, it binds and releases substrate in a practically pH-independent mode in the range 6.5–8.8 and thus cannot efficiently couple the reaction to the proton gradient. It catalyzes facilitated diffusion type of transport at rates that are about 60% of the rates of the wild type protein (13Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5264-5269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These findings hint that in the case of E14D the unloaded, unprotonated transporter can return at a rate high enough to support the uncoupled reaction. Thus, a fundamental requirement for coupling seems to be a residue (in our case Glu-14) with a highly distinct and properly tuned pK. Change in pK of carboxyls in proteins is usually either because of a low dielectric environment or charge proximity that can result in ion pairing or charge clusters. In the case of the EmrE oligomer, there is evidence that the Glu-14 residues of two neighbor monomers are very close to each other (16Soskine M. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12043-12048Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 17Koteiche H.A. Reeves M.D. McHaourab H.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6099-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Aspartyl residues in the same position would be farther apart and thereby display pKs closer to the pK of a carboxyl in aqueous environment. Previous studies show that TPP+ binds to the oligomer with a stoichiometry of 2–3 monomers/TPP+ (12Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 18Tate C.G. Ubarretxena-Belandia I. Baldwin J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 229-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The fact that 0.8 H+ are released per monomer demonstrates that binding of one substrate molecule to the oligomer brings on release of protons from all the Glu-14 residues in the oligomer. This finding suggests that all the Glu-14 residues are functionally equivalent in the oligomer. Apparent negative dominance is observed when mixing an inactive E14C mutant with wild type protein (19Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31044-31048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, later studies showed that this is the result of a 20-fold decrease in the affinity to the substrate (20Rotem D. Sal-man N. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48243-48249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). That the binding site is contributed by each of the subunits was also demonstrated by experiments in which the hetero-oligomer with Cys residues only in the inactive monomer was challenged with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), a sulfhydryl reagent. NEM inhibited the activity of this hetero-oligomer even though it does not have any effect on the activity of the wild type (20Rotem D. Sal-man N. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48243-48249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggested that protons and substrate share the same binding domain and that Glu-14 is an essential residue in this domain (8Ninio S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12000-12005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 9Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14711-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 10Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 21Gutman N. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16082-16087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The simplest interpretation of our data is based on the scheme described in Fig. 5 where the substrate binds only to the non-protonated species and pushes the equilibrium away from protonation. In such a mechanism, substrate does not necessarily change the pK of the carboxyl upon binding as was previously suggested (9Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14711-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The experimental approach described in this study and our interpretation of the results could be applied to a symporter as well with only slight modifications. In a symporter, substrate would bind exclusively to the protonated form of the transporter. Therefore, at the appropriate pH, substrate binding to an H+ symporter will cause removal of H+ from the medium. EmrE is specially suited to the experiments described in this work because of the ability of the detergent-solubilized protein to bind substrates and protons. The detergent-solubilized preparation allows for direct observation of individual steps in the transport cycle. The availability of a scalar system simplifies the quantitation and characterization but needs careful substantiation for the transport reaction through experiments with proteoliposomes as performed with EmrE (13Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5264-5269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The only difference we were able to detect between the properties of the membrane-bound and the detergent-solubilized protein is the inability of the latter to recognize methyl viologen, one of the substrates of EmrE (12Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Although EmrE is a very sturdy and stable protein, the detergent requirement for maintenance of function is quite strict and is fulfilled only by a handful of detergents, DDM being the best among the ones tested. 2M. Aharon and S. Schuldiner, unpublished results. Another advantage of EmrE is the low number of titratable groups, a fact that lowers the buffer capacity of the system and allows for a high signal to noise ratio. Finally, the size of the protein allows for an accurate assignment of the residue involved in proton binding and release. EmrE has only one membrane-embedded residue, Glu-14, and it is highly conserved. Our previous studies have suggested that Glu-14 is part of the substrate-binding domain and that there is an overlap between the proton- and substrate-binding domains. The simplest interpretation of the results presented here is that substrates and protons compete for the same site. Many studies of H+-coupled transporters have elegantly and unequivocally documented vectorial transport of protons as part of the transport cycle. These studies, including our own, have always implied the binding and release of protons in the catalytic cycle of the transporter. Here we provide for the first time direct experimental evidence for this reaction in a detergent-solubilized protein. Exploration of this reaction has provided a tool for its quantitation, determination of pK of the groups involved, and identification of the residues involved directly in proton release. It will now be possible to observe this reaction in shorter time spans and observe subtle influences in the rate of release by modifying residues that may be in the pathway of the proton on its way from and to Glu-14, the critical acceptor/donor.

Gonzalez-Candelas F. Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 2002; 25: 429-444Google Scholar). However, some amitochondriate parasitic protists such as Trichomonas vaginalis, T. fetus, Hexamita inflate, and one of the most commonly transmitted intestinal pathogens, Giardia intestinalis, have been shown to use the ADH pathway (2Knodler L.A. Sekyere E.O. Stewart T.S. Schofield P.J. Edwards M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4470-4477Google Scholar, 3Biagini G.A. Yarlett N. Ball G.E. Billetz A.C. Lindmark D.G. Martinez M.P. Lloyd D. Edwards M.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 128: 11-19Google Scholar). Recently, the first two proteins of the ADH pathway, ADI and OCT, were shown to be among 16 immunodominant proteins in Giardia, underscoring the importance of the ADH pathway in this parasite (4Palm J.E. Weiland M.E. Griffiths W.J. Ljungstrom I. Svard S.G. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 187: 1849-1859Google Scholar). Preliminary results from ADI gene silencing experiments in G. intestinalis using an RNAi construct did not yield viable organisms, suggesting that ADI plays an essential role in this pathogen. 2T. Nash, personal communication. Moreover, ADI competes with human nitric oxide synthase by scavenging arginine from the intestinal environment. Therefore, nitric-oxide synthesis in the intestinal epithelium, used as a host defense mechanism against microbial infection, can be blocked by ADI (4Palm J.E. Weiland M.E. Griffiths W.J. Ljungstrom I. Svard S.G. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 187: 1849-1859Google Scholar, 5Eckmann L. Laurent F. Langford T.D. Hetsko M.L. Smith J.R. Kagnoff M.F. Gillin F.D. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1478-1487Google Scholar). The genetic organization of the ADH gene cluster is now known for many organisms. The structure and regulation of the operon encoding the ADH pathway have been most thoroughly studied in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6Baur H. Luethi E. Stalon V. Mercenier A. Haas D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 53-60Google Scholar, 7Gamper M. Zimmermann A. Haas D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4742-4750Google Scholar, 8Luthi E. Mercenier A. Haas D. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1986; 132: 2667-2675Google Scholar). Pathogenic strains of this Gram-negative bacterium primarily infect immunocompromised patients, such as those suffering from burns, cystic fibrosis, and AIDS, and those undergoing chemotherapy (9Smith R.S. Iglewski B.H. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 56-60Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa is a leading source of hospital-acquired infections, and it is the cause of lung damage that results in a high mortality rate of cystic fibrosis patients. The ADH pathway provides the major route of arginine catabolism in this organism and is, therefore, important for the survival and propagation of P. aeruginosa. The pathway is activated under anaerobic conditions and in the presence of extracellular arginine (7Gamper M. Zimmermann A. Haas D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4742-4750Google Scholar, 10Lu C.D. Winteler H. Abdelal A. Haas D. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2459-2464Google Scholar). The absence of the ADI gene in the human genome, together with its important function in both pathogenic protozoa and bacteria make the enzyme an attractive therapeutic drug target for the treatment of bacterial and parasitic infections. Moreover, interest has increased in ADI as a potential agent of anti-angiogenesis (11Beloussow K. Wang L. Wu J. Ann D. Shen W.C. Cancer Lett. 2002; 183: 155-162Google Scholar) as well as anti-leukemic and non-leukemic murine tumors (12Wheatley D.N. Campbell E. Pathol. Oncol. Res. 2002; 8: 18-25Google Scholar). We present here the crystal structure of ADI from P. aeruginosa. Structural similarity to a number of arginine-modifying or substituted arginine-modifying enzymes provides the framework for proposing a reaction mechanism for ADI. Protein Production—The ADI gene from P. aeruginosa PAO1 was amplified using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene), genomic DNA (ATCC 47085D), and 5′ and 3′ end primers. The forward primer is 5′-CACCCTGGTGCCGCGCGGCAGCCATATGAGCACGGAAAAAACCAAACTT-3′, and the reverse is 5′-TCAGTAGTCGATCGGGTCGC-3′. In the forward primer, the sequence encoding a thrombin cleavage site is underlined, and an NdeI restriction site is shown in italic. The PCR product was introduced into pET100/d-TOPO expression vector by the TOPO directional cloning procedure (Invitrogen). Recombinant plasmids were isolated from Escherichia coli TOP10 strain (pET100/ADIh). An expression construct (pET100/ADIn) for the production of native protein without the His tag was prepared by digestion with NdeI and self-ligation. For production of the selenomethionine-containing protein, the E. coli strain B834(DE3) was transformed with the pET100/ADIh recombinant plasmid. Minimum Eagle's medium was supplemented with ampicillin and selenomethionine. Cells were grown at 30 °C to 0.5 A600 when 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added for protein expression. After 4 h the cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 0.5 m NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole. Then, cells were broken by passage through a French press. The soluble fraction was separated by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 30 min and applied on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid metal affinity column (Qiagen). Protein was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 m NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole. To remove the N-terminal sequence containing the His6 tag, thrombin was added at a 1:2000 molar ratio and left for 2 h at room temperature in a solution of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl. Thrombin was removed by passing the solution through a benzamidine column (Amersham Biosciences). Cleaved protein was separated from intact protein and from the N-terminal peptide on a second nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The protein was further purified by ion-exchange chromatography on a Source 15 Q column (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions containing protein were collected and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 50 mm NaCl. Finally, the protein was concentrated to 6 mg/ml, flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen, and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. Protein integrity and purity were assessed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS. Native protein was produced from E. coli strain BL21(DE3) transformed with the pET100/ADIn plasmid. Cells were grown in LB medium, and the protein was expressed under the same conditions as those described above. Native ADI was purified on an AKTAexplorer10 chromatographic station (Amersham Biosciences) using two major chromatographic steps: ion exchange and hydrophobic chromatography. An additional gel-filtration step was used if necessary to remove a small fraction of protein aggregates. Enzyme activity was determined according to a previously described procedure (6Baur H. Luethi E. Stalon V. Mercenier A. Haas D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 53-60Google Scholar). Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography—Analytical size exclusion chromatography was performed on an AKTAexplorer10 chromatography work station, using a Superdex-200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). Runs were performed at 0.4 ml/min in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) and 0.1 m NaCl. Crystallization and Data Collection—Selenomethionine-containing crystals were obtained in hanging drops using the vapor diffusion method at room temperature. The protein solution was mixed with an equal volume of mother liquor containing 33% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 6% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), and 4% acetone, and equilibrated against the mother liquor reservoir. Crystals appeared within 6–8 days and grew to ∼0.15 × 0.15 × 0.2 mm. These crystals were obtained under different conditions, have different cell parameters, and exhibit better diffraction quality than those reported previously (13Oudjama Y. Tricot C. Stalon V. Wouters J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 2150-2152Google Scholar). Diffraction data for crystals produced from selenomethionine-containing protein were acquired at the Industrial Macromolecular Crystallography Association Collaborative Access Team's (IMCA-CAT) 17-ID beamline at Advanced Photon Source (APS, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL). For data acquisition, the IMCA-CAT beamline was equipped with a Quantex210 charge-coupled device detector. Data processing was carried out using HKL2000 software (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar). The solvent occupies 55% of the crystal volume, and the asymmetrical unit contains four protein molecules.

Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Google Scholar) was used to determine selenium sites at a resolution of 3.0 Å. Phase determination and phase improvement were carried out with the Solve/Resolve programs (16Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1937-1940Google Scholar). The quality of the initial phase set was improved by density modification and extended to a resolution of 2.6 Å. The resulting electron density map revealed a 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry axis and two other symmetry axes with translational components, relating four independent molecules in asymmetrical units to one another. Four-fold averaging produced an interpretable electron density map. The polypeptide chain of one molecule was built on a silicon graphics octane work station using the interactive computer graphics program “O” (17Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 941-944Google Scholar). After adding the side chains, the remaining molecules in the asymmetrical unit were generated by applying the non-crystallographic symmetry operators. Structure refinement was carried out using the CNS program (18Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar) with all data between 20 and 2.45 Å. The four molecules in the asymmetrical unit were refined independently. The resulting model was inspected and modified on a graphics work station using “O” software. In the final stages of the refinement, water molecules were added to the model based on an electron density map difference of Fo - Fc (where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factors, respectively), using peaks with density ≥3σ as the acceptance criterion. Structure analysis was carried out using a number of computer programs, including PROCHECK for analysis of geometry (19Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar), Quanta for solvent-accessible surface area calculations (Molecular Simulations, Inc.), DALI (20Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Google Scholar) and SSM (21Krissinel E. Henrick K. Kungl A.J. Kungl P.J. Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Molecular Structural Biology, September 3–7, 2003. Austrian Chemical Society, Vienna2003: 88Google Scholar) for identifying structural homologues, and PyMOL for depiction of the structure (22DeLano W.L. The PyMOL User's Manual. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Modeling—Molecular modeling was carried out with the QUANTA2000/CHARMM26 software package (Molecular Simulations, Inc.). The citrulline ligand was extracted from the dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) structure (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1H70) and placed in the active site of ADI based on the superimposition of the two structures. The arginine ligand was placed manually in a position equivalent to that of citrulline. The salt bridge between Arg-401 and Asp-166 was disrupted by changing the Arg-401 side chain conformation using the QUANTA rotamer library. The model was optimized in QUANTA by energy minimization of the arginine substrate and the surrounding residues. Structure Quality—The refinement results are summarized in Table I. The electron density map in the vicinity of the active side is shown in Fig. 2. There are four protein molecules in the asymmetrical unit, A, B, C, and D, containing a total of 1630 amino acid residues and 492 water molecules. The monomers exhibit root-mean-square deviations of α-carbon positions in the range 0.2–0.7 Å. The five N-terminal residues of each molecule are not visible in the electron density map. In addition, no electron density is associated with the protein surface residues 249, 250, 273, 274, and 418 in molecule A, 151, 152, 273, 274, and 347–351 in molecule B, 352 in molecule C, and 273, 274, 345–352, and 418 in molecule D. They were omitted from the final model. Overall Structure—ADI from P. aeruginosa forms tetramers with an approximate symmetry of 222. The packing is mediated by two perpendicular non-crystallographic symmetry axes and a crystallographic axis (Fig. 3). In the crystal, molecules A and B belong to one tetramer and molecules C and D to a second tetramer. The analytical gel filtration experiments show that the tetramer is the predominant form in solution as well. The buried contact surface area per monomer is 2785 Å2, ∼16% of the monomer surface area. Hydrophobic monomer contact surface area is 1029 Å2, ∼21% of the total hydrophobic surface area of the monomers. The overall fold of ADI consists of five ββαβ modules in cyclical arrangement, generating a pseudo 5-fold symmetrical barrel and an additional 85-residue α-helical domain inserted between the first and the second ββαβ modules (Fig. 4). The three β strands in each ββαβ module are arranged as a mixed β sheet, approximately parallel to the barrel pseudo 5-fold axis. As previously predicted (23Leiper J.M. Santa Maria J. Chubb A. MacAllister R.J. Charles I.G. Whitley G.S. Vallance P. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 209-214Google Scholar, 24Shirai H. Blundell T.L. Mizuguchi K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 465-468Google Scholar), the core barrel of ADI is structurally similar to DDAH (25Murray-Rust J. Leiper J. McAlister M. Phelan J. Tilley S. Santa Maria J. Vallance P. McDonald N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 679-683Google Scholar) and to two amidinotransferases, arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) (26Humm A. Fritsche E. Steinbacher S. Huber R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3373-3385Google Scholar) and arginine:inosamine-phosphate amidinotransferase (IPAT) (27Fritsche E. Bergner A. Humm A. Piepersberg W. Huber R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17664-17672Google Scholar) (Table II). Yet, the amino acid sequence identity between ADI and these proteins is low, ranging between 15 and 17%. The root-mean-square deviation values of α-carbon positions between the aligned residues of ADI and the other three proteins range between 1.9 and 2.9 Å. So far, ADI is the largest enzyme of the structural superfamily (418 versus ∼360 residues for the amidinotransferases and 254 residues for DDAH). The 85-residue insertion is unique to ADI and includes five α-helices (α′1–5 in Fig. 4), a short 3/10 helix, and a single short β strand (not highlighted in Fig. 4, for clarity). The automated structure comparison programs SSM (21Krissinel E. Henrick K. Kungl A.J. Kungl P.J. Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Molecular Structural Biology, September 3–7, 2003. Austrian Chemical Society, Vienna2003: 88Google Scholar) and DALI (20Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Google Scholar) did not reveal a significant similarity between this α-helical domain and any structure currently in the PDB. The α-helical domain mediates tetramer formation (the contact between the yellow and blue molecules and between the green and magenta molecules in Fig. 3). All other structural relatives of ADI are dimers.Table IIADI structural homologsPDB ID codeProtein nameZ-scoreRSMDaRMSD, root-mean-square deviationAligned residuesSequence identityÅ%SSM program search 1H70DDAH10.61.923215 1BWDIPAT10.92.024517 4JDWAGAT9.12.325416DALI program search 1H70DDAH26.02.325016 1JDWAGAT26.42.928116 1BWDbThe automatic DALI search did not identify IPAT as a structural homologue, and the result listed in the table was obtained by pairwise search of the ADI and 1BWD coordinatesIPAT26.52.827816a RMSD, root-mean-square deviationb The automatic DALI search did not identify IPAT as a structural homologue, and the result listed in the table was obtained by pairwise search of the ADI and 1BWD coordinates Open table in a new tab Another unique feature of ADI is the β strand insertions in the first and third ββαβ modules, extending these β sheets with the topologies βββαβ and ββαβββ, respectively (Fig. 4, B and C). The core ββαβ modules are always the same; the first β strand occupies the inner most position and makes a hairpin loop connection to a second antiparallel β strand, which is in turn linked to the third parallel β strand via a crossover connection containing an α-helix, forming a mixed β sheet. However, in module I the 3-stranded β sheet is augmented with a β strand (βI1′) adjacent to the first one (βI1). In module III the β sheet is extended by two antiparallel β strands βIII4′ and βIII5′, which are inserted between the second β strand (βIV2) and the α-helix (αIV) of module IV (Fig. 4, B and C). This insertion contains a short α-helix (α′6, residues 295–298). Active Site Architecture—The active site topology of ADI is similar to that of the other enzymes of the structural superfamily DDAH, IPAT, and AGAT. The catalytic triad Cys-His-Glu/Asp seen in the other arginine modifying enzymes is also conserved in ADI, as well as many other residues involved in substrate binding (Fig. 4C). Note that the special arrangement of the catalytic triad here is different from that of the well studied thiol and serine proteases (28Ye S. Goldsmith E.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 740-745Google Scholar, 29Bode W. Huber R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 241-252Google Scholar), because the cysteine and histidine residues do not interact with each other (the distance between the two is ∼7 Å). Although the two amidinotransferases (IPAT and AGAT) have the same orientation as the target scissile bond of the substrate with respect to the cysteine and histidine catalytic residues, the bond to be cleaved is different (Cζ–Nϵ versus Cζ–Nη). Consequently, the substrate orientation in AGAT and IPAT is different compared with that of DDAH (25Murray-Rust J. Leiper J. McAlister M. Phelan J. Tilley S. Santa Maria J. Vallance P. McDonald N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 679-683Google Scholar, 26Humm A. Fritsche E. Steinbacher S. Huber R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3373-3385Google Scholar) and ADI. AGAT and IPAT catalyze amidinotransferase reactions in which the amidino group of arginine is transferred to a second substrate, producing the amidino derivatives of the substrates and ornithine (Fig. 5). In contrast, DDAH and ADI are hydrolytic enzymes, catalyzing the same bond cleavage (Cζ–Nη) (Fig. 5). Therefore, further comparisons were made with the structure of the C249S mutant DDAH in complex with citrulline ((25Murray-Rust J. Leiper J. McAlister M. Phelan J. Tilley S. Santa Maria J. Vallance P. McDonald N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 679-683Google Scholar) PDB code 1H70). Superimpositions of these two structures and of six conserved active site residues, including the catalytic triad (Cys-406, His-278, and Glu-224 in ADI), are shown in Fig. 6. The nearly identical locations of these residues together with the structure-based sequence alignment support the active site assignment of ADI.Fig. 6Structural relationship between ADI and DDAH. A, superimposition of the ADI (gray) and DDAH (cyan) monomers. The C249S mutant DDAH in complex with citrulline (PDB code 1H70) was used. The citrulline product is shown in green. B, superimposition of the active site residues of ADI and DDAH. Colors are the same as in A. The residues of ADI are labeled.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The active site of ADI is strikingly enriched with charged residues (Fig. 7A). It contains only one hydrophobic residue, Phe-163. The charge state of the catalytic residue, Cys-406, remains to be determined. An exquisite network of ion pair interactions ensures structural integrity and may also play a role in enzyme activity. Most of these residues are invariant in the known ADI sequences. The Asp-280 carboxylate group interacts with the imidazole group of His-405, which in turn interacts with Glu-13 (not shown). Of these three residues, Asp-280 and Glu-13 are invariant in all known ADIs, and His-405 is sometimes replaced by an arginine. An unusual feature of this network is the presence of another invariant residue, Arg-165, of which the guanidinium group stacks against the His-405 imidazole ring, and both residues are buried (Fig. 7A). The desposition of Arg-165 is fixed by electrostatic interactions with the main chain oxygen atoms of Thr-408 and His-405 and with the hydroxyl group of Thr-408 (not shown in the figure). The charge network is further extended by the interaction between Glu-224 and His-278, which in turn interacts with the carboxyl group of Asp-227. The last ionic cluster involves Asp-166, Arg-185, and Arg-401 (Fig. 7A). This network is extended beyond the active site to include Glu-188 (not shown), which forms an ion pair with Arg-185. Proposed Michaelis Complex and Catalytic Mechanism—The ADI active site is blocked because the side chain of Arg-401 forms an ion pair with the carboxyl group of Asp-166 and occupies approximately the same position as the guanidinium group of an arginine substrate (Fig. 7A). Thus, the enzyme must undergo conformational transition on substrate binding. Hindering substrate access to the active site may play a regulatory role in preventing degradation at low intracellular concentrations of arginine. For docking, the dihedral angles of the Arg-401 side chain were modified to allow access to the binding site, and the Michaelis complex of ADI with arginine was modeled as described under “Materials And Methods.” In the model, the guanidinium group of the arginine substrate is fixed tightly by interactions with the carboxyl groups of Asp-166 and Asp-280 (Fig. 7B). The hydrophobic part of the arginine side chain interacts with the conserved Phe-163, and its carboxyl group forms ionic interactions with Arg-185 and Arg-401. The interaction with Arg-401 is speculative, however, because the actual conformation adopted by the Arg-401 side chain is unknown. Orienting the arginine substrate in this manner places the plane of the guanidinium group between two side chains, the thiol group of Cys-406 and the imidazole group of His-278. Based on mutagenesis studies and structural data, catalytic mechanisms for DDAH and AGAT were proposed (25Murray-Rust J. Leiper J. McAlister M. Phelan J. Tilley S. Santa Maria J. Vallance P. McDonald N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 679-683Google Scholar, 26Humm A. Fritsche E. Steinbacher S. Huber R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3373-3385Google Scholar, 30Fritsche E. Humm A. Huber R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3026-3032Google Scholar). The overall structural similarity of DDAH, AGAT, and ADI, the conservation of the catalytic triad, and the common orientation of the scissile bond relative to the catalytic cysteine suggest a similar reaction mechanism for the three enzymes. With this consideration in mind, we propose a two-step reaction for arginine hydrolysis by ADI involving a covalent intermediate (Fig. 8). The reaction begins with binding of arginine in the active center, concomitant with swapping of the Arg-401 side chain out of the pocket. The pKa of Cys-406 has not yet been determined, thus we do not know the ionization state of this residue in the resting state. The mechanism illustrated in Fig. 8 is written for a thiol group. If Cys-406 is ionized in the resting state, we assume that the proton would reside on Asp-280, the closest proton-accepting group to Cys-406 (3.7 Å). The Michaelis complex and the tetrahedral transition state I would change slightly, but the mechanism would be essentially the same. The first chemical step is initiated by the nucleophilic attack of the Cys-406 thiol group on the guanidinium group Cζ atom, and concomitant proton transfers to the nitrogen atom, Nη, and from Nη to His-278 (Fig. 8). The electrophilicity of Cζ is modulated by interaction of the guanidinium group with Asp-166 and Asp-280, and His-278 serves as a general base. In turn, the ionization state of Asp-280 could be modulated by its network partners His-405, Arg-165, and Glu-13, and the ionization state of Asp-166 could be influenced by Arg-185. This first tetrahedral transition state is followed by the formation of a transient covalent intermediate and the release of ammonia after cleavage of the Cζ–Nη bond (Fig. 8). In the second step of the reaction, ammonia is replaced by a water molecule. This water molecule is activated by His-278 and attacks the Cζ atom of the covalent intermediate. Here again, His-278 serves as the general base. Finally, the carbon-sulfur bond between the enzyme and the resulting citrulline is cleaved, and free enzyme is generated for the next catalytic cycle. It is worthwhile noting that an alternative mechanism that invokes Asp-280 as a general base instead of His-278 can also be proposed. This would imply that the unusual charge network of Asp-280, His-405, Arg-165, and Glu-13 plays a major catalytic role. This network is conserved in all known ADI amino acid sequences as well as in IPAT and AGAT but is not conserved in DDAH. In contrast, His-278 is a conserved residue in all superfamily members. In conclusion, the crystal structure of arginine deiminase and the enzyme-substrate complex model suggest further experiments to elucidate the proposed mechanism. Furthermore the ADI structure provides a framework for a rational design of new therapeutic agents against bacterial and parasitic infections.

https://openalex.org/W2076208523,"We identified VTA1 in a screen for mutations that result in altered vacuole morphology. Deletion of VTA1 resulted in delayed trafficking of the lipophilic dye FM4-64 to the vacuole and altered vacuolar morphology when cells were exposed to the dye 5-(and 6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (CDCFDA). Deletion of class E vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) genes, which encode proteins that affect multivesicular body formation, also showed altered vacuolar morphology upon exposure to high concentrations of CDCFDA. These results suggest a VPS defect for Δvta1 cells. Deletion of VTA1 did not affect growth on raffinose and only mildly affected carboxypeptidase S sorting. Turnover of the surface protein Ste3p, the a-factor receptor, was affected in Δvta1 cells with the protein accumulating on the vacuolar membrane. Likewise the α-factor receptor Ste2p accumulated on the vacuolar membrane in Δvta1 cells. We demonstrated that many class E VPS deletion strains are hyper-resistant to the cell wall disruption agent calcofluor white. Deletion of VTA1 or VPS60, another putative class E gene, resulted in calcofluor white hypersensitivity. A Vta1p-green fluorescent protein fusion protein transiently associated with a Pep12p-positive compartment. This localization was altered by deletion of many of the class E VPS genes, indicating that Vta1p binds to endosomes in a manner dependent on the assembly of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport. Membrane-associated Vta1p co-purified with Vps60p, suggesting that Vta1p is a class E Vps protein that interacts with Vps60p on a prevacuolar compartment.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the multivesicular body (MVB) 1The abbreviations used are: MVB, multivesicular body; CDCFDA, 5-(and 6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate; CPS, carboxypeptidase S; ESCRT, endosomal sorting complex required for transport; VPS, vacuolar protein sorting; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TAP, tandem affinity purification; HA, hemagglutinin. 1The abbreviations used are: MVB, multivesicular body; CDCFDA, 5-(and 6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate; CPS, carboxypeptidase S; ESCRT, endosomal sorting complex required for transport; VPS, vacuolar protein sorting; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TAP, tandem affinity purification; HA, hemagglutinin. has at least two functions: delivery of membrane proteins destined for degradation into the lumen of the vacuole and delivery of the vacuolar hydrolase CPS (1Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Proteins encoded by class E VPS genes are required for proper formation of the MVB. Membrane proteins destined for invagination into the MVB are monoubiquitinated and then bound to the ubiquitin-binding protein Vps27p (2Bilodeau P.S. Urbanowski J.L. Winistorfer S.C. Piper R.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). This is followed by the sequential recruitment of three cytosolic protein complexes referred to as endosomal sorting complex required for transport I (ESCRT I) (Vps23p, Vps28p, and Vps37p) (3Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar), ESCRT II (Vps22p, Vps25p, and Vps36p) (4Babst M. Katzmann D.J. Snyder W.B. Wendland B. Emr S.D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 283-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), and ESCRT III (Vps20p, Snf7p, Vps24p, and Vps2p) (5Babst M. Katzmann D.J. Estepa-Sabal E.J. Meerloo T. Emr S.D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 271-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The membrane association of each complex is dependent on the presence of the preceding complex. ESCRT I and ESCRT II exist as complexes in the cytosol. The components of ESCRT III are monomeric in the cytosol and are recruited to the membrane in an ordered manner. Vps20p and Snf7p can associate with the membrane independently of the other members of ESCRT III, while Vps2p and Vps24p require the binding of Vps20p and Snf7p to membranes for their membrane association. Once bound to the membrane, the release of all three complexes to the cytosol is mediated by Vps4p, an AAA-type ATPase (6Babst M. Wendland B. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2982-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Other proteins shown to be involved in the formation of the MVB include Vps60p (7Kranz A. Kinner A. Kolling R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), Did2p (8Amerik A.Y. Nowak J. Swaminathan S. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3365-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), Vps44p (9Bowers K. Levi B.P. Patel F.I. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4277-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and Vps31p/Bro1p (10Odorizzi G. Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Audhya A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1893-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Vps44p is a Na+/H+ anti-porter on the late endosome. Vps31p/Bro1p was recently shown to interact with Snf7p, a component of ESCRT III. The roles of Vps60p and Did2p have yet to be defined, but they share significant sequence similarity with the ESCRT III proteins.We identified VTA1 in a screen for mutations that result in altered vacuole morphology. Here we present genetic and biochemical evidence that Vta1p is a class E Vps protein that specifically interacts with Vps60p. Vta1p was required for the sorting of the plasma membrane proteins Ste2p and Ste3p into the MVB, while the absence of Vta1p resulted in a kinetic delay in the delivery of the lipophilic dye FM4-64 to the vacuole and a mild missorting of the vacuolar hydrolase CPS. We also showed that Vta1p is a soluble protein that associates with a Pep12p-positive compartment in a manner dependent on the assembly of all three ESCRT complexes.MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast Strains and Media—Strains used in this study are listed in Table I. BY4743 and the homozygous diploid deletions derived from it were obtained from Research Genetics. vta1-5a was generated by dissecting the Research Genetics homozygous diploid deletion strain and twice backcrossing one of the derived haploids to the wild type haploid strain BY4741. The other haploid deletion strains were generated by PCR amplifying the DNA surrounding the deletion from the Research Genetics diploid and transforming it into BY4743. The transformants were plated on YPD (1% Bacto yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 2% dextrose) for 24 h and then replica-plated to YPD containing 200 μg/ml G418. The resulting strains were sporulated, dissected, and genotyped. All deletions were confirmed by PCR. To generate DY3444Δvta1 and DY4167Δvta1, a region surrounding the vta1::KANMX4 locus from the Research Genetics diploid strain was amplified by PCR and transformed to the diploid DY3466. The resulting heterozygote was sporulated, and the appropriate genotypes were selected. DY4167 VTA1-TAP was generated as described previously by homologous recombination with a PCR product derived from the plasmid pBS1479 (Cellzome) (11Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). Yeast were grown either in CM (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% dextrose, and all amino acids except those required for plasmid maintenance) or in YPD. YEP raffinose differs from YPD solely in that dextrose is replaced with 2% raffinose. Solid media were made by adding 1.5% agar. Calcofluor white plates were made by adding calcofluor white (Sigma, fluorescent brightener 28) to a final concentration of 20–40 μg/ml into YPD.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeRef.BY4743MATa/MATα his3/his3 ura3/ura3 leu2/leu2 lys2/+ met15/+27Brachmann C.B.

For construction of pMet3GFP, the EcoRV/PstI fragment from M2265 (obtained from D. Stillman, University of Utah) containing the MET3 promoter was inserted into YCp33 that had been cut with SalI, treated with Klenow polymerase, and then cut with PstI. The resulting plasmid (YCp33MET3) was digested with BamHI and KpnI and ligated to the BamHI/KpnI fragment from pGFP-c-fus (12Niedenthal R.K. Riles L. Johnston M. Hegemann J.H. Yeast. 1996; 12: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) containing the GFP open reading frame and the CYC1 terminator sequence. PCR-amplified VTA1, VPS20, and VPS60 were inserted as BamHI/SmaI fragments into pMET3GFP, resulting in pVTA1GFP, pVPS20GFP, and pVPS60GFP, respectively.Labeling of Vacuoles—FM4-64 staining was done as described previously (13Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). Briefly 5 OD units of cells were incubated in 1 ml of YPD containing 40 μm FM4-64 for 10 min at 30 °C, washed once with YPD, and further incubated in dye-free YPD at 30 °C. For 5-(and 6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (CDCFDA) staining, cells were grown to midlog phase in YPD overnight or in CM-uracil overnight before shifting to YPD for 3 h. 10 OD units of cells were harvested, resuspended in 1 ml of CM with 1 μl of 200 mm CDCFDA, and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 500 μl of CM. Cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy and differential interference contrast optics.Sorting and Detection of CPS-GFP—The CPS-GFP construct was obtained from S. Emr (14Odorizzi G. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 1998; 95: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). For analysis of CPS trafficking, cells were grown to midlog phase, harvested, and disrupted by vortexing with glass beads in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl with protease inhibitors (Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Triton X-100 was added to the postnuclear supernatants to a final concentration of 1%. Samples were incubated on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min. 50 μg of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, and GFP was detected by Western analysis with an anti-GFP antibody (Covance).Ste3p Localization and Degradation—pRS414 Ste3GFP and pRS414 Ste3HA were obtained from B. Horazdovsky (Mayo). DY3444 and DY3444Δvta1 expressing Ste3p-GFP were grown overnight in CM-Trp containing 70 μg/ml adenine to suppress vacuolar accumulation of the red pigment caused by the ade2 mutation. Localization was determined by fluorescence microscopy analysis of Ste3p-GFP using an Olympus epifluorescence microscope with 100× oil immersion objective. Ste3p degradation assays were done as described previously (15Davies B.A. Topp J.D. Sfeir A.J. Katzmann D.J. Carney D.S. Tall G.G. Friedberg A.S. Deng L. Chen Z. Horazdovsky B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19826-19833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) except that cells were grown in CM-Trp overnight to A600 = 0.6 before addition of cycloheximide. Polyclonal HA antibody was obtained from T. Stevens (University of Oregon).Chitin Measurement—Chitin was measured as described previously (16Ketela T. Green R. Bussey H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3330-3340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Protein Analysis—For Western analysis and purification of TAP-tagged proteins, cells were pelleted, washed, spheroplasted, and Dounce-homogenized in TBSM (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 600 mm mannitol) with protease inhibitors (Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Homogenates were centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min to obtain a post-nuclear supernatant. The postnuclear supernatant was then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min to obtain S16 and P16 fractions. TAP-tagged proteins were isolated as described previously (11Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). Briefly the P16 fraction was solubilized in TBSM containing 1% Triton X-100. TAP-tagged proteins were purified using rabbit IgG-agarose beads (Sigma). Proteins, released by cleavage with tobacco etch virus protease, were then bound to a calmodulin column and eluted with EDTA. A similar protocol was used for TAP-tagged proteins present in the S16 fraction but without detergent. Western analysis was done using peroxidase-conjugated anti-peroxidase (Sigma), anti-GFP (Covance), or anti-c-Myc (9E10) (Covance) antibodies. For size exclusion chromatography, cells were Dounce-homogenized in 20 mm K+ Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol with protease inhibitors. The S16 fraction was isolated as above and combined with 19 volume of 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1.5 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40. One milliliter was loaded on a Superdex 200 fast protein liquid chromatography column. One-milliliter fractions were collected.Immunofluorescence—Wild type and Δvta1 strains were prepared for immunofluorescence as described previously (17Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jiralerspong S. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Kaplan J. Science. 1997; 276: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Antibody to Pep12p was obtained from Molecular Probes. Secondary antibody, Alexa 594-conjugated to goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes), was used at a dilution of 1:750. Images were collected as single wavelengths on an Olympus FVX confocal fluorescent microscope with a 60× Pianapo objective (1.4 numerical aperture oil) using Fluoview 2.0.39 software. Z sections (0.5 μm) are shown. Rabbit anti-Snf7p antibody was obtained from M. Babst (University of Utah). Cells were prepared for immunofluorescence as described previously (17Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jiralerspong S. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Kaplan J. Science. 1997; 276: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar) and imaged using an Olympus epifluorescence microscope.Vta1p-GFP and CPS-GFP Microscopy—Strains expressing either Vta1p-GFP or CPS-GFP were grown to midlog phase, mounted on slides, and imaged using an Olympus epifluorescence microscope as described above for Ste3p-GFP imaging.RESULTSIdentification of VTA1—We identified VTA1 (VPS twenty associated) in a screen for abnormal vacuolar morphology using the Research Genetics deletion collection of homozygous diploids. Wild type and Δvta1 cells incubated with a 10 μm concentration of the vacuolar dye CDCFDA showed normal multilobed vacuolar morphology (data not shown). When the concentration of the dye was increased to 200 μm, the Δvta1 cells, in contrast to wild type cells, exhibited a non-lobed vacuole (Fig. 1A). Greater than 85% of Δvta1 cells exhibited non-lobed vacuoles compared with only 10% of wild type cells. This phenotype was confirmed in a haploid strain, vta1-5a, generated by two rounds of backcrossing (data not shown). Staining with LysoSensor Green DND-189, a pH-dependent vacuolar dye, was not different in the Δvta1 strain compared with the wild type (data not shown).VTA1 has been classified as a class E VPS gene (18Yeo S.C. Xu L. Ren J. Boulton V.J. Wagle M.D. Liu C. Ren G. Wong P. Zahn R. Sasajala P. Yang H. Piper R.C. Munn A.L. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3957-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Deletion of any of the other characterized class E VPS genes resulted in the same non-lobed vacuolar morphology in response to CDCFDA as seen in the Δvta1 strain (data not shown). This phenotype was seen in the Research Genetics homozygous diploid deletion strains and in haploid deletion strains generated in our laboratory. Deletion of VPS33 (class C), VPS39 (class B) (19Raymond C.K. Howald-Stevenson I. Vater C.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1389-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), or non-VPS related genes did not result in the altered vacuolar morphology in response to CDCFDA (data not shown), suggesting that this is a phenotype specific to deletion of class E VPS genes.We examined the uptake of the membrane dye FM4-64 to determine whether endocytosis was altered in the Δvta1 strain. Inspection of Δvta1 cells revealed a kinetic delay in the trafficking of FM4-64 to the vacuole (Fig. 1B). This delay was most evident between 45 (as shown) and 90 min (data not shown) after internalization of the dye. The delay resulted in an accumulation of the dye in a prevacuolar compartment. As shown by the data presented below, this compartment is a class E vesicle.Phenotypes of a VTA1 Deletion Strain—Mutations in VPS genes often result in abnormal vacuole morphology as well as missorting of vacuolar hydrolases. To examine whether deletion of VTA1 affects sorting of CPS, we utilized a GFP-tagged CPS protein in which the GFP epitope was on the cytoplasmic tail of CPS. In wild type cells, the chimeric protein is sorted into the MVB and is then delivered to the lumen of the vacuole. Within the lumen of the vacuole CPS is released from the membrane as an active hydrolase (3Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). The remainder of the molecule, GFP attached to the transmembrane domain of CPS, stays membrane-associated and is then further cleaved releasing a soluble GFP molecule of ∼27 kDa. If the protein is not sorted into the MVB, the GFP does not get released and remains membrane-bound. The CPS portion of the fusion protein can still be cleaved, but the GFP portion remains associated with the transmembrane domain as evidenced by the slightly larger band (∼33 kDa) seen by Western analysis using a GFP antibody (20Reggiori F. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5176-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The missorting of CPS-GFP can be followed by fluorescence microscopy analysis (Fig. 2A). In wild type cells, GFP fluorescence was found in the lumen of the vacuole. In most class E VPS mutants, fluorescence was not found in the vacuolar lumen but rather was associated with the vacuolar membrane and concentrated in the perivacuolar class E compartment. In Δvta1 cells, GFP fluorescence was found in the vacuolar lumen with a significant fraction still associated with the vacuolar membrane.Fig. 2CPS is partially missorted in Δvta1 and Δvps60 cells. A, wild type (BY4741) or the indicated deletion strains expressing CPS-GFP were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. B, the indicated strains expressing a CPS-GFP fusion protein were homogenized and analyzed by Western analysis as described under “Materials and Methods.” The indicated bands represent GFP that has been cleaved from CPS. DIC, differential interference contrast.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Missorting of CPS-GFP in Δvta1 cells can also be shown through Western analysis (Fig. 2B). Deletion of class E genes results in the absence of soluble GFP, reflecting the defective processing of CPS-GFP. The missorting of CPS in Δvta1 cells contrasts with cells deleted for VPS20 or VPS4, which encode characterized class E Vps proteins (3Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 5Babst M. Katzmann D.J. Estepa-Sabal E.J. Meerloo T. Emr S.D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 271-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). In Δvta1 cells, both soluble and membrane-bound GFP cleavage products were seen. We also examined the distribution of CPS-GFP in cells deleted for VPS60. VPS60 encodes a coiled-coil protein homologous to VPS32/SNF7 and other members of the ESCRT III complex (7Kranz A. Kinner A. Kolling R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Deletion of VPS60 does not lead to a growth defect on raffinose but does lead to a delay in FM4-64 trafficking to the vacuole (7Kranz A. Kinner A. Kolling R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). By fluorescence, the distribution of CPS-GFP in Δvps60 cells appeared similar to that seen in Δvps4 and Δvps20 cells (Fig. 2A). By Western analysis, the misprocessing of CPS-GFP was similar to that seen in Δvta1 cells as both soluble and membrane-bound GFP cleavage products were seen (Fig. 2B).Plasma membrane proteins destined for degradation are also sorted through the MVB. Ste3p, the a-factor receptor, is present on the plasma membrane and is trafficked to the vacuole for degradation in a ubiquitin-dependent process (21Davis N.G. Horecka J.L. Sprague Jr., G.F. J.

The half-life of Ste3p-HA was increased in Δvta1 cells compared with wild type cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Fluorescence microscopy revealed that in wild type cells, Ste3p-GFP was delivered to the lumen of the vacuole, while in Δvta1 cells, Ste3p-GFP accumulated in a prevacuolar structure and on the limiting membrane of the vacuole (Fig. 3C). The prevacuolar structure that contained Ste3p-GFP also accumulated FM4-64. A similar result was observed for Ste2p, the α-factor receptor (Fig. 4). The missorting of Ste2p in Δvta1 cells was evident but less severe than that seen in Δvps4 or Δvps20 cells. The pattern of missorting of Ste2p-GFP in Δvps60 cells was similar to that seen in Δvta1 cells.Fig. 3Analysis of Ste3p degradation and localization. A, 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 min after the addition of cycloheximide, lysates were generated from DY3444 (wild type) and DY3444Δvta1 strains expressing Ste3p-HA encoded on a plasmid as described under “Materials and Methods.” Protein was detected by Western analysis with a polyclonal HA antibody.

Similar to Δvps60, Δvta1 cells were able to grow at both 37 °C and 39 °C and to grow on raffinose at 30 °C. A growth defect was only observed when the Δvta1 cells were grown on raffinose at 39 °C (Fig. 5A).Fig. 5Growth defects of Δvta1.

To verify that this phenotype segregated as a single locus, we sporulated the Δvta1 diploid and backcrossed the haploid to the parental strain (BY4741). On each cross, calcofluor white hypersensitivity segregated 2:2 (n = 6) with deletion of VTA1 (data not shown). The severity of the calcofluor white pheno-type permitted us to examine the effect of complementing plasmids. Transformation of Δvta1 cells (S288c background) with either a high or low copy plasmid containing VTA1 resulted in complementation of both calcofluor white sensitivity (Fig. 5B) and growth on raffinose at 39 °C (Fig. 5A). Addition of carboxyl-terminal epitopes (c-Myc, TAP, and GFP) did not affect complementation (Fig. 5 and data not shown).In contrast to the calcofluor white sens"

We show in this paper that cytokines and nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors regulate S-nitrosation of an initiator caspase, procaspase-9, in a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, HT-29. A NOS inhibitor, NG-methyl-l-arginine, enhanced the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced cleavage of procaspase-9, procaspase-3, and poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase, as well as the level of apoptosis. NG-Methyl-l-arginine, however, did not affect the cleavage of procaspase-8. These results suggest that nitric oxide regulates the cleavage of procaspase-9 and its downstream proteins and, subsequently, apoptosis in HT-29 cells. Labeling S-nitrosated cysteines with a biotin tag enabled us to reveal S-nitrosation of endogenous procaspase-9 that was immunoprecipitated from the HT-29 cell extracts. Furthermore, the treatment with TNF-α, as well as NOS inhibitors, decreased interferon-γ-induced S-nitrosation in procaspase-9. Our results show that S-nitrosation of endogenous procaspase-9 occurs in the HT-29 cells under normal conditions and that denitrosation of procaspase-9 enhances its cleavage and consequent apoptosis. We, therefore, suggest that S-nitrosation regulates activation of endogenous procaspase-9 in HT-29 cells.

On the other hand, S-nitrosation of recombinant active caspase-3 treated with a nitric oxide donor, S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP), was identified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (67Zech B. Wilm M. van Eldik R. Brune B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20931-20936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This report, however, raises the issue of relevance to endogenous caspases in the cells and did not characterize the modification site. Nitrosation of the active-site cysteine in endogenous procaspase-3 and its denitrosation through Fas signaling were observed in various immune cells by using photolysis chemiluminescence (68Mannick J.B. Hausladen A. Liu L. Hess D.T. Zeng M. Miao Q.X. Kane L.S. Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Science. 1999; 284: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Also, the relation of S-nitrosation to cellular localization of procaspase-3 was addressed (69Mannick J.B. Schonhoff C. Papeta N. Ghafourifar P. Szibor M. Fang K. Gaston B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1111-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). These reports applied more direct methods to endogenous procaspase-3 compared with previous literature. One concern is that they used the whole immunoprecipitates of procaspases, and, therefore, it is possible that S-nitrosation could be detected also from other proteins precipitated with procaspase-3. Combining the separation of the components precipitated with procaspase-9 by molecular weight and a labeling method for S-nitrosated cysteine, we were able to visualize S-nitrosation of endogenous procaspase-9. Furthermore, nitric-oxide synthase inhibitors and a death signal decreased S-nitrosation of procaspase-9. These results suggest that denitrosation of endogenous procaspase-9 enhances its cleavage and consequently apoptosis. Cell Culture and Chemical Treatment—Human colon epithelial adenocarcinoma cell line, HT-29 (generously provided from the Peter Sorger laboratory in the Department of Biology, MIT), was maintained in McCoy’s 5A medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and l-glutamine (Invitrogen) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cells were seeded onto culture plates at a density of 5 × 104/cm2 and grown for 24 h. Then, 200 units/ml of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (Roche Applied Science) was applied for 24 h to sensitize the cell line to death signals (70O'Connell J. Bennett M.W. Nally K. O'Sullivan G.C. Collins J.K. Shanahan F. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 71Xu X. Fu X.Y. Plate J. Chong A.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2832-2837PubMed Google Scholar), followed by treatment with 50 ng/ml of TNF-α (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) for the indicated hours. Cells were co-treated with TNF-α and nitric oxide inhibitors, NG-methyl-l-arginine (NMA) (Sigma), 1400w, l-N5-(1-iminoethyl)-ornithine, and l-thiocitrulline (Calbiochem), whereas S-nitrosoglutathione (Sigma) was applied for 2 h before TNF-α treatment. In the Biotin Switch Method, cells were treated with NMA or 1400w for 4 h following 24 h of IFN-γ treatment. Cell Death Assay—Apoptosis was measured with cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plus (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, cell lysates equivalent to 103 cells were incubated with both anti-histone antibody labeled with biotin and anti-DNA antibody conjugated with peroxidase in streptavidin-coated microplates for 2 h. Microplate wells were washed and incubated with substrates for colorimetric measurement at wavelength 405 nm with reference at 490 nm. Western Blotting—Cells lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 0.5% Igepal, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml bestatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min. Total protein concentration in the supernatant was measured by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of proteins were then separated in 15% Tris-HCl gel (Bio-Rad) except 10% gel for PARP by using a Bio-Rad mini-SDS-PAGE system and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked in TBS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl) with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% non-fat milk and then incubated with a primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. Anti-mouse caspase-8 antibody, anti-rabbit cleaved caspase-9 antibody, anti-rabbit cleaved caspase-3 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), anti-mouse PARP antibody, anti-mouse caspase-9 antibody, and anti-mouse Apaf-1 antibody (BD Biosciences) were used as primary antibodies. After washing with TBS buffer with 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated in the blocking buffer with secondary anti-IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) for 1 h. The membranes were then developed with supersignal West Femto substrate (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation—50 μl of polyclonal anti-rabbit procaspase-9 antibody (BD Biosciences) was immobilized onto 150 μl of Aminolink plus coupling gel beads (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s instruction and stored in the same volume of phosphate-buffered saline. For control beads, normal rabbit serum was immobilized under the same conditions. Cell lysates containing 5 mg of total protein were incubated with 20 μl of the immobilized antibody at 4 °C overnight. After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, and the beads were washed with TBS buffer containing 0.1% Igepal and 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (Sigma) extensively. Bound proteins were eluted by 0.1 m of glycine (pH 2.9) and immediately neutralized with ammonium hydroxide. Detection of S-Nitrosation by the Biotin Switch Method—The procedure was performed according to the protocol by Jaffrey and Snyder (72Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar, 73Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Sci. STKE. 2001; 2001: L1Google Scholar). Briefly, eluates of procaspase-9 immunoprecipitation and rabbit muscle creatine phosphokinase (Sigma) as controls were, respectively, incubated with 20 mm methyl methanethiosulfonate (Sigma) followed by acetone precipitation. Precipitates were centrifuged and resuspended in HENS buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.01 mm neocuproine, and 1% SDS) and then incubated with 1 mm ascorbic acid and 4 mm N-[6-(biotinamido)hexyl]-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)propionamide (biotin-HPDP) (Pierce) for 1 h. Because biotin-HPDP is cleavable under the reducing conditions, prepared samples were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels without dithiothreitol. Biotinylated samples were then detected by blotting as described above except that 3% bovine serum albumin was used in the blocking buffer instead of non-fat milk, incubation with primary antibody was omitted because of the biotin labeling, and Neutravidin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) was used instead of secondary antibody. If necessary, each membrane was reprobed with anti-mouse caspase-9 antibody by Western blotting. NG-Methyl-l-Arginine Enhanced the TNF-α-induced Apoptosis of HT-29 Cells—Treatment with the nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, NMA, enhanced the level of apoptosis induced by TNF-α at the 24-h point (Fig. 1A). Also, treatment with NMA alone induced apoptosis of IFN-γ-sensitized cells. The cell death assay detects only the end point of apoptosis, so we did not observe significant increases of cell death at earlier time points. Our results demonstrated that blocking the production of nitric oxide enhanced the effect of a death signal, suggesting, in turn, that endogenously produced nitric oxide can protect cells. Next, we examined the effects of a nitric oxide donor, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), on apoptosis. We used GSNO, because it is a more likely endogenous nitric oxide donor in the cells than other agents. Treatment with GSNO decreased the induction of apoptosis by TNF-α and/or NMA but did not show statistical significance (Fig. 1B). The partial inhibitory effect by GSNO could result from its poor permeability into the cells. Another NOS inhibitor, 1400w, also enhanced the TNF-α-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1C). Nitric-oxide Synthase Inhibitors Enhanced the TNF-α-induced Cleavage of Caspases—Fig. 2 shows that co-treatment with NMA and TNF-α enhanced the cleavage of procaspase-9, -3, and PARP compared with the treatment with TNF-α alone at both the 8- and 24-h time points. However, co-treatment with NMA did not affect the cleavage of procaspase-8. Procaspase-3 and PARP are well known downstream substrates of caspase-9 and -3, respectively, meaning that their cleavage can represent the activity of upstream enzymes. Therefore, NMA treatment up-regulated both the cleavage and activity of caspase-9 and -3. Treatment with NMA alone induced the cleavage of procaspase-9 in IFN-γ-sensitized cells (data not shown). These observations suggest that nitric oxide-mediated signals act on the downstream events of caspase-8, which include the activation of procaspase-9. Also, other NOS inhibitors, i.e. 1400w, l-N5-(1-iminoethyl)-ornithine, and l-thiocitrulline, enhanced the cleavage of procaspase-9 by TNF-α (data not shown). In addition, pretreatment with GSNO as a nitric oxide donor decreased the cleavage of procaspase-9, -3, and PARP by TNF-α, again not affecting procaspase-8, and reversed the effect of NMA to enhance the cleavage of procaspase-9, -3, and PARP by TNF-α (data not shown). The Biotin Switch Method Visualized S-Nitrosation of Procaspase-9 —The results mentioned above indicated that altering the level of cellular nitric oxide by using nitric oxide-related chemicals affected the cleavage of caspases, as well as the level of apoptosis. Nitric oxide-mediated signals thus are apparently involved in regulating the cleavage of procaspase-9 and its downstream proteins and consequent apoptosis. Previous reports have implicated S-nitrosation of caspases as a negative regulatory modification (41Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2157309751,"A tissue-protective effect of interleukin-11 (IL-11) for the intestinal mucosa has been postulated from animal models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Despite the fact that the clinical usefulness of the anti-inflammatory effects of this cytokine is presently investigated in patients with IBD, there are no data available regarding the target cells of IL-11 action and the mechanisms of tissue protection within the human colonic mucosa. IL-11 responsiveness is restricted to cells that express the interleukin-11 receptor alpha-chain (IL-11Ralpha) and an additional signal-transducing subunit (gp130). In this study, we identified the target cells for IL-11 within the human colon with a new IL-11Ralpha monoclonal antibody and investigated the functional expression of the receptor and downstream effects of IL-11-induced signaling. Immunohistochemistry revealed expression of the IL-11Ralpha selectively on colonic epithelial cells. HT-29 and colonic epithelial cells (CEC) constitutively expressed IL-11Ralpha mRNA and protein. Co-expression of the signal-transducing subunit gp130 was also demonstrated. IL-11 induced signaling through triggering activation of the Jak-STAT pathway without inducing anti-inflammatory or proliferative effects in colonic epithelial cells. However, IL-11 stimulation resulted in a dose-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt, a decreased activation of caspase-9, and a reduced induction of apoptosis in cultured CEC. In HLA-B27 transgenic rats treated with IL-11, a reduction of apoptotic cell numbers was found. This study demonstrates functional expression of the IL-11Ralpha restricted on CEC within the human colonic mucosa. IL-11 induced signaling through triggering activation of the Jak-STAT pathway, without inducing anti-inflammatory or proliferative effects. The beneficial effects of IL-11 therapy are likely to be mediated by CEC via activation of the Akt-survival pathway, mediating antiapoptotic effects to support mucosal integrity."

Here, we have identified human PIRH2 (hPIRH2) as a TIP60-interacting protein. To investigate its regulation, we characterized hPIRH2 in parallel with hPIRH2 variants possessing mutations of conserved RING finger residues. We observed that wild-type hPIRH2 is an unstable protein with a short half-life and is a target for RING domain-dependent proteasomal degradation. Accordingly, we found that hPIRH2 was ubiquitylated in cells. The TIP60-hPIRH2 association appeared to regulate hPIRH2 stability; coexpression of TIP60 enhanced hPIRH2 protein stability and altered hPIRH2 subcellular localization.

The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor that, through modulation of gene expression, can induce apoptosis or cell cycle arrest in response to cellular insults, including DNA damage (1Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2694) Google Scholar). Several regulatory mechanisms control p53 activities, including post-translational modifications (2Brooks C.L.

MDM2 can also mediate nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of ubiquitylated p53 so that p53 can be degraded in the cytoplasm (15Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat.

Other mechanisms indirectly control MDM2 activities; HAUSP is a ubiquitin protease that can remove ubiquitin groups from p53 upon DNA damage (30Li M. Chen D. Shiloh A. Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Qin J. Gu W. Nature. 2002; 416: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar), reversing MDM2 effects. Nucleolar compartmentalization of MDM2 by alternative reading frame (ARF) or the ribosomal protein L11 can separate MDM2 from p53, producing a p53-dependent response to stress (31Weber J.D.

Clark P.A. Rowe J. Peters G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). MDM2 is an unstable protein capable of autoubiquitylation, which leads to its own destruction (13Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol.

Additionally, TIP60 was shown to associate with MDM2, resulting in ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of TIP60 (60Legube G. Linares L.K. Lemercier C. Scheffner M. Khochbin S. Trouche D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1704-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).Here, we demonstrate that human PIRH2 (hPIRH2) is an unstable protein that is ubiquitylated and targeted for RING domain-dependent proteasomal destruction. We also demonstrate that hPIRH2 can interact with TIP60, which bears similarities to the MDM2-ARF/L11 associations; we show that TIP60 can stabilize hPIRH2 protein levels and produce hPIRH2 subcellular relocation and, in some cells, nucleolar compartmentalization. We propose that hPIRH2 stability is likely to be regulated by multiple post-translational mechanisms, some of which are described herein.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Two-hybrid Screening—Yeast PJ69–4A (a gift from Philip James) was sequentially transformed with pAS2-1 (Clontech) containing full-length TIP60α cDNA and human brain cDNA in pACT-2 (Clontech). Prototrophs growing on synthetic dropout medium lacking adenine, leucine, and tryptophan were assayed for β-galactosidase activity with 2-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside substrate (Sigma). Library plasmids from positive clones were isolated and verified by endonuclease digestion and then sequenced with pACT-2 primers (Clontech) and retransformed into PJ69–4A containing pAS2-1 or pAS2-1-TIP60 cDNA. Transformants were assayed for TIP60-specific interactions using 2-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside and prototrophic growth on synthetic dropout medium.DNA Manipulation—Sequencing results compared with human expressed sequence tags using BLAST identified one clone containing a partial cDNA encoding hPIRH2. Full-length hPIRH2 cDNA from the IMAGE consortium (clone 4651778) was subsequently characterized in this study. Primers 5′-ggatccatggcggcgacggcccgg-3′ and 5′-gaatccttgctgatccagtgaaat-3′ were used to amplify full-length hPIRH2, and cDNA was cloned into pcDNA4.1 (Invitrogen) using BamHI and EcoRI to produce Myc-tagged hPIRH2 (hPIRH2-Myc).hPIRH2-Myc was subjected to in vitro mutagenesis using QuikChange (Stratagene). Conserved RING domain cysteines were altered to serines using oligonucleotides C145S/C148S (5′-cgacagaattctccaatatctttggaggacattc-3′ and 5′-gaatgtcctccaaagatattggagaattctgtcg-3′) and C164S (5′-gctcatgtcttgccatctggacatc-3′ and 5′-gatgtccagatggcaagacatgagc-3′). Primers 5′-ggatccgggcggcgacggccccg-3′ and 5′-ggggatccctcattgctgatccag-3′ were used for cloning wild-type and C145S/C148S hPIRH2 into pEGFP (Clontech) and pACT-2 using BamHI. 2Details of hPIRH2 deletion constructs are available upon request. Constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. pCMV5-driven expression of human FLAG-TIP60 and TIP60-RFP has been described (46Gaughan L. Logan I.R. Cook S. Neal D.E. Robson C.N. J. Biol.

FLAG-TIP60 or FLAG-TIP60D (where “D” represents acetylase-dead) cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA4.1 using EcoRI to produce pcDNA4-FLAG-TIP60 or pcDNA4-FLAG-TIP60D, respectively.Cell Culture—PC3M, 293, LNCaP, and COS-7 cells maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma) and l-glutamine were transfected with Superfect (QIAGEN Inc.). FLAG-TIP60- or FLAG-TIP60D-expressing doxycycline-induced cells were produced by transfection of pcDNA4-FLAG-TIP60 or pcDNA4-FLAG-TIP60D and pcDNA6-TR into PC3M cells, followed by selection in blasticidin and Zeocin (Invitrogen). Individual clones were expanded and tested for TIP60 induction with 1 μg/ml doxycycline. MG132 and cycloheximide were from Calbiochem. GFP transfectants were grown on glass coverslips before fluorescence microscopy analysis.Immunoprecipitation and Antibodies—The antibodies used were as follows: anti-Myc antibody 9B11 (Cell Signaling), anti-ubiquitin antibody PD41 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-TIP60 antibody N-17 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-pentahistidine antibody (QIAGEN Inc.), anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma), anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-nucleolin antibody 4E2 (Research Diagnostics Inc.), and Alexa 350-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc.). For immunoprecipitation, 5 × 105 293 cells seeded on 90-mm dishes (Corning Inc.) were transfected with the indicated plasmids. 48 h later, cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with protease inhibitors, and lysates were clarified by ultra-centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min and then precleared in 50% protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 4 h. Samples were mixed with 2 μg of antibody and fresh protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 12 h. Immune complexes recovered by centrifugation were washed three times with 100 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl and then resuspended in 40 μl of Laemmli buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting as shown.RESULTSTIP60 Interacts with the RING Finger Protein hPIRH2— Yeast two-hybrid screening with a human brain cDNA library fused to the Gal4 activation domain identified a clone encoding amino acids 31–261 of the RING domain-containing hPIRH2 protein that interacted robustly with TIP60 fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Fig. 1A). The TIP60-hPIRH2 interaction is specific, as hPIRH2 did not interact with pLAM5′ (Fig. 1A), and TIP60 did not interact with another RING domain-containing protein (BRCA1) in yeast (Fig. 1C).To confirm TIP60-hPIRH2 association, co-immunoprecipitation of proteins produced in vitro and from transiently transfected 293 cells was performed. FLAG-TIP60 and full-length wild-type hPIRH2-Myc proteins were specifically co-immunoprecipitated from 293 cells with anti-TIP60 antibody N-17 as shown in Fig. 1B. Western blotting showed that immunoprecipitation did not recover large amounts of TIP60 protein, in agreement with reports of low TIP60 solubility (60Legube G. Linares L.K. Lemercier C. Scheffner M. Khochbin S. Trouche D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1704-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Western blotting for the Myc epitope showed specific hPIRH2-Myc coimmunoprecipitation with FLAG-TIP60, demonstrating that the two proteins complex in 293 cells (Fig. 1B).hPIRH2 contains a RING finger motif, identical to that of mPIRH2, between residues 145 and 186. To investigate whether the hPIRH2 RING structure mediates the TIP60 interaction, two conserved key cysteine residues were mutated (Fig. 1D). The mutant hPIRH2 protein carrying mutations of Cys145 and Cys148 (C145S/C148S hPIRH2-Myc) also co-immunoprecipitated with TIP60 (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the hPIRH2 RING domain structure is dispensable for the TIP60-hPIRH2 interaction. 35S-Radiolabeled TIP60 and hPIRH2 proteins, produced in vitro using a coupled transcription/translation system, were also specifically co-immunoprecipitated with anti-His antibody directed against TIP60 (data not shown).TIP60-hPIRH2 interaction was analyzed further in yeast. First, full-length wild-type hPIRH2 was assayed for TIP60 interaction and demonstrated a similar interaction strength as the clone encoding amino acids 31–261 of hPIRH2 (∼60-fold over background levels) (Fig. 1C). Next, to delineate regions of hPIRH2 that interact with TIP60, hPIRH2 deletion constructs were assayed with TIP60 in yeast. A construct encoding amino acids 40–261 of hPIRH2 was capable of TIP60 interaction, although to a much lesser degree than full-length hPIRH2 (Fig. 1C). Additionally, hPIRH2 residues 80–261 interacted with TIP60 to the same degree as residues 40–261, whereas residues 94–261 failed to interact with TIP60 (Fig. 1C). This suggests that hPIRH2 amino acids 31–40 likely mediate the TIP60 interaction, but that amino acids 80–94 may also participate in TIP60 interaction. Overall, it is clear the hPIRH2 N terminus mediates TIP60 interaction(s).TIP60 interacted with full-length C145S/C148S hPIRH2 to the same degree as full-length wild-type hPIRH2 in yeast, but not with the N-terminal deletion construct encoding residues 120–261 containing the hPIRH2 RING domain (Fig. 1C). Together, the deletion construct and C145S/C148S mutation data show that the hPIRH2 RING domain is dispensable for TIP60-hPIRH2 interactions. The mPIRH2 RING domain is also dispensable for p53 interaction (40Leng R.P. Lin Y. Ma W. Wu H. Lemmers B. Chung S. Parant J.M. Lozano G. Hakem R. Benchimol S. Cell. 2003; 112: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), which is mediated by mPIRH2 residues 120–137 (40Leng R.P. Lin Y. Ma W. Wu H. Lemmers B. Chung S. Parant J.M. Lozano G. Hakem R. Benchimol S. Cell. 2003; 112: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). TIP60 therefore does not bind to the same residues as p53. Pilot data indicated that the TIP60 atypical zinc finger contributed to the TIP60-hPIRH2 interaction and that histone acetylase-deficient TIP60 could also interact with hPIRH2. 3K. Halkidou, I. R. Logan, S. Cook, D. E. Neal, and C. N.

Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). mPIRH2 is a bona fide RING domain-dependent E3 enzyme that can mediates p53 ubiquitylation (40Leng R.P.

Several E3 enzymes can also autoubiquitylate in cells, targeting themselves for proteasomal destruction (13Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol.

Proteins ubiquitylated (either in cis or in trans) may be expected to exhibit a relatively short half-life due to rapid turnover by the proteasome (7Pickart C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 544-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) and accumulation in high molecular mass polyubiquitylated species upon proteasomal inhibition. Experiments to examine the possibility that hPIRH2 may regulate its own expression were undertaken. First, the half-life of hPIRH2 was examined. hPIRH2 expression was examined in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with either wild-type or C145S/C148S hPIRH2-Myc and then treated with cycloheximide, a potent inhibitor of protein translation in eukaryotes (62Lin H.K. Wang L. Hu Y.C. Altuwaijri S. Chang C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4037-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Western analysis showed wild-type hPIRH2 exhibited a relatively short half-life, as hPIRH2 protein levels decreased within 3 h and more dramatically within 5 h (Fig. 2A, left panels). Densitometry analysis indicated that the hPIRH2 half-life (normalized to α-tubulin levels) was ∼3.5 h. The C145S/C148S hPIRH2 RING domain double mutant showed no reduction in protein levels with cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 2A, right panels), illustrating that it is a stable protein and suggesting that destruction of hPIRH2 is dependent upon an intact hPIRH2 RING domain. Interestingly, high molecular mass C145S/C148S hPIRH2 RING domain mutant species were also detected that were not present in wild-type hPIRH2-transfected cells. Similar results were obtained in other cell lines tested. 3K. Halkidou, I. R. Logan, S. Cook, D. E. Neal, and C. N.

Only one enzyme that belongs to the extended family of SMases is present in S. cerevisiae, Isc1p; however, little is known about its regulation or physiologic function. Deletion of ISC1 in S. cerevisiae resulted in a growth defect, and the slow growth phenotype was rescued by plasmid-borne expression of Isc1, confirming its role in growth. The levels of phytoceramide exhibited an Isc1p-dependent increase of ∼4-fold after 24 h of growth. In addition, the specific activity of Isc1p was significantly elevated (>3-fold) between the early logarithmic and the late logarithmic/start of stationary phases of growth. The activation of the enzyme was not associated with increased levels of the protein, indicating that the mechanism is independent of transcription/translation. Interestingly, this activation was lost upon delipidation of the enzyme, raising the possibility of regulation by associated lipids. Confocal microscopy revealed that the enzyme was predominantly in the ER during early growth but became associated with mitochondria in late logarithmic growth. These results were also supported by differential centrifugation and isolation of mitochondria and further confirmed in mitochondria purified using sucrose gradients at the different stages of growth. These results reveal that the activity and localization of Isc1p are regulated in a growth-dependent manner. A novel mechanism for activation of Isc1p through localization to mitochondria is proposed. The results also suggest a role for Isc1p-generated ceramides in optimal regulation of growth.

Sphingomyelinases (SMases) hydrolyze the phosphodiester linkage of SM, producing ceramide and phosphorylcholine. Such activity was found to exist in organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals, including S. cerevisiae, and SMases and SMase-like enzymes have been recently cloned from mice, humans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (16Mizutani Y.

Comparison of recent reports on Isc1p (18Sawai H. Okamoto Y. Luberto C. Mao C. Bielawska A. Domae N. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

They both (a) hydrolyze SM; (b) require Mg2+ for optimal activity; (c) demonstrate a neutral pH optimum; (d) are activated by anionic phospholipids; (e) present ∼30% identity; and (f) contain a newly discovered domain that is conserved in the entire family of SMases, the P-loop-like domain (20Okamoto Y. Vaena De Avalos S. Hannun Y.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7855-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which appears to be important for substrate binding and/or catalysis. Indeed, Isc1p has emerged as the leading enzyme in the study of the mechanisms of this emerging family of sphingophospholipid phosphodiesterases. A recent study demonstrated that the second transmembrane domain and the C terminus of Isc1p are required for binding of Isc1p to anionic phospholipids, especially CL, PG, and PS, phospholipids that are potent and essential activators of the enzyme in vitro (22Okamoto Y. Vaena De Avalos S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46470-46477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It was also shown that the C terminus interacts with the remainder of the enzyme, and it was proposed that this interaction plays a critical role in enzyme function through a novel tethering mechanism of enzyme activation by lipid cofactors (22Okamoto Y. Vaena De Avalos S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46470-46477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Since mammalian SMases play roles in cell growth and the molecular mechanisms for the regulation of these enzymes are not well understood, we became interested in determining whether Isc1p plays a role in cellular growth of S. cerevisiae, in which case the regulation of Isc1p may become an important model. Although deletion of ISC1 rendered viable cells, these cells have growth defects, and a recent study showed that Css1p, the S. pombe homologue of Isc1p, is required for viability, that it regulates the coordination of cell wall formation, and that its function can be complemented by Isc1p (19Feoktistova A. Magnelli P. Abeijon C. Perez P. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Gould K.L. Genetics. 2001; 158: 1397-1411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report that Isc1p is required for optimal growth of S. cerevisiae and that the enzyme is activated during growth. Overexpression of ISC1 under the control of a heterologous promoter and analysis of microsomal fractions suggested that this increase in specific activity was not due to transcriptional/translational activation. Interestingly and instead, data from confocal microscopy in combination with biochemical experiments using isolated and purified mitochondria demonstrated that Isc1p translocates/localizes to the mitochondria during the postdiauxic phase of growth. Therefore, these results show that Isc1p is regulated (activated and translocated) during growth and suggest a novel mechanism for the activation of Isc1p through the in vivo translocation/localization to the mitochondria during the late logarithmic and postdiauxic phases of S. cerevisiae growth.

Spheroplasts were prepared according to previous reports (25Zinser E. Daum G. Yeast. 1995; 11: 493-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 26Rieder E. Emr S. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York2000: 3.7.1-3.7.25Google Scholar). Cells were pretreated with 0.1 m Tris-SO4, pH 9.4, containing 10 mm dithiothreitol for 10 min at 30 °C. After centrifugation, cells were washed and suspended in 1.2 m sorbitol, 20 mm potassium phosphate, and Zymolase 100T was added for 50 min. The spheroplasts thus formed were harvested by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min at room temperature and broken by 15 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Assay of Isc1p Activity—Since untransformed Δisc1 cells present no sphingomyelinase activity and because the activity of partially purified enzyme from Isc1p-overexpressing cells was unstable, as described previously (22Okamoto Y. Vaena De Avalos S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46470-46477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), unless otherwise stated, cell lysates were used to determine Isc1p activity as described with modifications (18Sawai H.

Briefly, cell lysates were incubated in 100 μl of buffer containing 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 nmol (6.7 mol %) of PS, 10 nmol (6.7 mol %) of unlabeled SM, and 100,000 dpm of [choline-methyl-14C]SM at 30 °C for 30 min. After the incubation, 1.0 ml of chloroform, 0.5 ml of methanol, and 0.2 ml of water were added according to the method of Folch et al. (27Folch J. Leos M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the radioactivity in a portion (400 μl) of the upper phase was mixed with Safety Solve (Research Products International) for liquid scintillation counting. Protein Determination, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blotting—Five micrograms of total protein (for detection using anti-FLAG antibody in overexpressor extracts), 30 μg of total protein (for anti-FLAG detection in single copy expression), or 10 μg unless otherwise specified, were resuspended in reducing buffer, resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked, and immunoblotting was performed as previously described (28Vaena de Avalos S. Blader I.J. Fisher M. Boothroyd J.C. Burleigh B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 639-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Isolation of Subcellular Membranes—To obtain microsomal fractions, cell lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the microsomal and cytosolic fractions. Microsomal membranes were delipidated by incubation in lysis buffer in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The suspensions were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min, and aliquots from the supernatants were used for enzymatic determinations under the conditions described above for the Isc1p activity assay. For differential centrifugation experiments, cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min to obtain the P13 pellets. The supernatants were transferred and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the P100 pellets. Isolation of mitochondria was based on published procedures (26Rieder E. Emr S.

Daum G. Yeast. 1995; 11: 493-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Spheroplasts were prepared in buffer A (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1.2 m sorbitol) and resuspended in buffer B containing 10 mm K+-MES, pH 6.0, 0.6 m sorbitol, 0.5 mm EDTA. After the addition of 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, the cellular homogenate was prepared, and crude mitochondrial preparations were obtained as described by Glick and Pon (29Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Isolation of Purified Mitochondria—Crude mitochondria were isolated as described above, suspended in buffer C (0.6 m sorbitol, 20 mm K+-MES, pH 6.0), and layered on top of a density gradient composed of 30–60% sucrose constructed in 1-ml steps differing in 3.3% sucrose increments in buffer C. The gradient was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 3 h at 4 °C using a SW41 rotor. Pure mitochondria were harvested from the lower third of the gradient as previously described (30Gaigg B. Simbeni R. Hrastnik C. Paltauf F. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1234: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 31Schumacher M.M. Choi J.Y. Voelker D.R. J. Biol.

Measurements of Mass Levels of Phytoceramide—Cells were harvested and washed with water, and lipids were extracted following the method of Bligh and Dyer (32Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). The chloroform organic phase was divided into aliquots, dried down, and processed for inorganic phosphorous determination or phytoceramide measurements using the Escherichia coli diacylglycerol kinase assay. Phytoceramide was quantitated using external standards and normalized for phosphorous content (33Perry D.K. Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 22-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy—Cells were examined under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Olympus I X 70) with a Plan Apo × 60 oil objective (numerical aperture 1.4), and images were captured using PerkinElmer Ultraview software that was set at the spinning disc mode. Cell Fixation and Fluorescence Staining—Mitochondria were stained as described (34Achleitner G. Gaigg B. Krasser A. Kainersdorfer E. Kohlwein S.D. Perktold A. Zellnig G. Daum G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were collected by centrifugation and gently suspended in growth medium containing 500 nm dye MitoTracker™ Red CM-H2XROS (Molecular Probes), incubated for 30 min in the dark at 30 °C, and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were fixed for 2 h with 3.7% formaldehyde in the medium and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and spheroplasts were obtained as described above. For immunofluorescence, spheroplasts were loaded on a glass slide precoated with poly-l-lysine. Washing, blocking, and antibody incubations were performed in a humid chamber as described (35Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. 2000: 133-135Google Scholar), and the cells were covered with a coverslip for microscopical visualization. The excitation wavelength for GFP was 488 nm, and 525/550-nm emission was detected. The excitation wavelength for MitoTracker Red was 568, and the emission detection was >590 nm. No optical cross-talk between the emission channels was observed. For quantification of the colocalization of GFP-Isc1 with intracellular markers, the number of cells showing colocalization was expressed as a percentage of the total number of evaluable cells. Double-labeling experiments were performed using MitoTracker Red and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) as described above. To invert the fluorophores, MitoTracker Green FM- (Molecular Probes) and Alexa Fluor 633-conjugated antibodies (Molecular Probes) were also used. Deletion of ISC1 (Δisc1) caused cells to grow slowly. The defect in growth was readily detectable at late log and stationary phases when compared with the parental wild type strain (Fig. 1). The optical density (OD) values for Δisc1 strain (ko) grown for 72 h were comparable with the values for the 24-h wild type cultures, and, at most, Δisc1 reached ∼70% of the wild type stationary phase growth. The Δisc1 slow growth phenotype was rescued by plasmid-borne expression of ISC1 (Fig. 1), confirming that the slow growth was indeed caused by loss of ISC1. Thus, Isc1p is required for optimal cellular growth. The above results suggested the hypothesis that Isc1p enzyme activity may be regulated differentially during different phases of yeast growth, and two approaches were undertaken in order to determine whether Isc1p is selectively activated. First, the levels of phytoceramide were measured in extracts prepared from wild type or Δisc1 cells, grown for 4, 12, 24, and 48 h after dilution of the culture to 0.1 A600 units, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lipids were extracted, and the levels of phytoceramide were analyzed by the diacylglycerol kinase assay. Both wild type and Δisc1 showed an initial decrease (∼50%) in the levels of phytoceramide during the first 10 h of growth. This reduction was followed by a ∼4-fold increase of the total level of phytoceramide in the wild type cells after 24 h of growth (five A600 units). In contrast, the phytoceramide content in the deletion strain did not increase over this time period (Fig. 2). Therefore, these results demonstrate that the later production of phytoceramide is dependent on the expression of Isc1p, suggesting that Isc1p may be preferentially activated in the different phases of growth. Second and based on the above, we investigated whether Isc1p showed changes in its activity during different growth phases. To evaluate this, the specific activity of Isc1p was measured in cellular extracts prepared from wild type or Δisc1 cells obtained at different times during the growth phases. As expected, no activity was observed in the lysates from the knock-out strain at any time during growth, thus ruling out a temporally dependent induction of another gene product with an enzymatic function similar to that of Isc1p. In contrast, the basal specific activity of native Isc1p in vitro was markedly elevated with the phase of growth, showing a significant increase of ∼3-fold from 4 to 24 h (Fig. 3a), which was sustained up to 96 h of culture, although at a somewhat reduced level (2–3-fold). These data suggest that Isc1p activity is regulated during the logarithmic and postdiauxic phases of growth. Next, we investigated whether the activation of Isc1p during growth was due to transcriptional or other regulatory events. For this purpose and to monitor the expression of ISC1, a 5′-FLAG-tagged version of ISC1 under the control of its endogenous promoter was constructed, cloned into a single copy plasmid, and transformed into the background of the ISC1 deletion strain. An increase of specific activity of FLAG-Isc1 at 24 versus 4 h was again found (Fig. 3b), similar to that observed with the wild type strain, indicating that the FLAG-tagged version of Isc1p is also active and regulated over time similar to the endogenous Isc1. The 4- and 24-h time points were chosen for future experiments, since they evidenced increases of specific activity in extracts from all strains expressing ISC1. Next, and in order to determine whether the increase in activity was due to the synthesis of more protein, microsomal fractions were prepared from cells expressing FLAG-Isc1 cultured for 4 or 24 h, and immunoblotting was performed. A specific ∼55-kDa band (predicted size for FLAG-Isc1) was detected with the anti-FLAG antibody in the fractions from both time points (Fig. 3b). Notably, immunoblotting analysis, performed on equal loading of total protein, did not reveal an increase in the expression levels of Isc1p at 24 h compared with 4 h, and actually a decrease was reproducibly observed. Thus, it is concluded that the increase in specific activity of Isc1p is not due to an increase in the relative expression levels of Isc1p. Since these results argue against a transcriptional/translational mechanism of Isc1p regulation, other mechanisms of activation were investigated. In order to perform additional biochemical experiments, a higher amount of Isc1 protein was required. For this purpose, FLAG-Isc1 was overexpressed under the control of a promoter inducible by galactose, in the background of ISC1 deletion strain. This approach also allowed further investigation to determine whether regulation of Isc1p activity was at the level of transcription, since these studies employed a heterologous promoter. Initially, we determined whether this strain exhibited the same features that the wild type did. Again, an increase (∼4–5-fold) of specific activity at 24 versus 4 h was reproducibly obtained (Fig. 3c). Importantly, these results demonstrate that the increase in specific activity is promoter-independent and validate the use of this construct to investigate the basis of t"
https://openalex.org/W2024962704,"Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) is a nuclear protein kinase that responds to acute rises in intracellular calcium by phosphorylating and activating proteins involved in transcription. Consistent with these roles, CaMKIV is found predominantly in the nucleus of cells in which it is expressed. Here we evaluate nuclear entry of CaMKIV and demonstrate that the protein kinase homology domain is both necessary and sufficient for nuclear localization. Unexpectedly, although catalytic activity is required for nuclear translocation, it is not required for CaMKIV to interact with the nuclear adaptor protein, importin-α. Because the catalytically inactive molecules remain in the cytoplasm, these data suggest that this interaction is not sufficient for nuclear entry. We evaluated a role for other proteins known to interact with CaMKIV in regulation of its nuclear entry. Although our data do not support a role for calmodulin or protein phosphatase 2A, the catalytically inactive CaMKIV proteins interact more avidly with CaM-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK), which is restricted to the cytoplasm. We find that the catalytically inactive proteins do not inhibit nuclear entry of wild-type CaMKIV but do inhibit the ability of the wild-type protein kinase to stimulate cyclic AMP response element-binding protein-mediated transcription. Because activation loop phosphorylation is required for the transcriptional roles of CaMKIV, these data suggest that CaMKK phosphorylation of CaMKIV may occur in the cytoplasm. We propose that sequestration of CaMKK may be the molecular mechanism by which catalytically inactive mutants of CaMKIV exert their “dominant-negative” functions within the cell.

After full activation by the three-step mechanism mentioned above, the activity of CaMKIV becomes autonomous and no longer requires bound Ca2+/CaM (13Chatila T. Anderson K.A. Ho N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21542-21548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). CaMKIV enzyme activity appears to be negatively regulated by the heterotrimeric protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which physically associates with the kinase (14Sakagami H. Kondo H. Brain Res. 1996; 719: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The nuclear localization of CaMKIV is well established (3Nakamura Y. Okuno S. Sato F. Fujisawa H. Neuroscience. 1995; 68: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14Sakagami H. Kondo H. Brain Res. 1996; 719: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry of endogenous CaMKIV in brain slices illustrates that CaMKIV is concentrated in the nucleus of neurons (15Deisseroth K. Heist E.K. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry of cultured cells ectopically expressing CaMKIV also shows nuclear staining (16Matthews R.P. Guthrie C.R. Wailes L.M. Zhao X. Means A.R. McKnight G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6107-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which CaMKIV enters the nucleus remains to be elucidated. Because CaMKIV is 60 kDa (17Ohmstede C.-A. Jensen K.F. Sahyoun N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5866-5874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is unlikely to enter the nucleus by diffusion through the nuclear pore as is typical of proteins less than 40 kDa (18Feldherr C.M. Akin D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 933-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Rather, it seemed likely that CaMKIV would gain access to the nuclear compartment via the nuclear import machinery and thus would require association with the importin or karyopherin proteins. We have developed a human embryonic kidney 293A (HEK293A) cell system to evaluate the contributions of the domain structure, catalytic activity, and the known binding partners of CaMKIV to nuclear localization. We find that the C-terminal domain of CaMKIV that contains the CaM binding site and the only candidate nuclear localization sequence (NLS) is not important for nuclear entry. Instead, we find that the kinase homology domain can bind to importin-α and is necessary for nuclear entry. However, importin-α binding is not sufficient for nuclear entry of CaMKIV as full-length proteins with point mutations resulting in kinase inactivation are retained in the cytoplasm. Although phosphorylation of the activation loop is not required for the movement of CaMKIV into the nucleus, the catalytically inactive CaMKIV proteins bind more avidly to the cytoplasmic CaMKK. Intriguingly, the catalytically inactive mutant kinases inhibit the ability of the wild-type enzyme to drive CREB-mediated transcription in a dose-dependent manner. However, they do not influence the movement of CaMKIV into the nucleus, suggesting that they function in another capacity in the cytoplasm. These results suggest a novel role for protein kinase activity in facilitating the nuclear entry of CaMKIV and provide a mechanistic explanation for the dominant-negative action of the catalytically inactive CaMKIV mutant proteins. Cells and Cell Culture—A HEK293A cell line, obtained from QBI (Quantum Biotechnologies), was used for all cell culture experiments and cultured as described by the company. Construction of Plasmids—The rCaMKIV cDNA was made using the Stratagene reverse transcription-PCR kit. The RNA was isolated from an adult female Sprague-Dawley rat cerebellum. The entire rCaMKIV construct was verified by sequencing (Amersham Biosciences Thermo Sequenase kit). The rCaMKIV cDNA was subcloned into the pRC-CMV vector. pEYFP-C1-rCaMKIV-WT, pEYFP-C1-rCaMKIV 1–314, and pEYFP-C1-rCaMKIV T196A were made by directionally subcloning the rCaMKIV-WT cDNA from the pRC-CMV-rCaMKIV WT, rCaMKIV 1–314, and rCaMKIV T196A vectors into the pEYFP-C1 vector (Clontech C-Terminal Enhanced Fluorescent Protein Vector) using the SacII and XbaI sites within the multicloning site of pEYFP-C1. PEYFP-C1-rCaMKIV K71M was made by subcloning the rCaMKIV K71M cDNA from the rCaMKIV Q- 1–314 vector into the pEFYP-C1-rCaMKIV WT vector using the BstEII and SmaI sites within the rCaMKIV cDNA. pEYFP-C1-rCaMKIV 1–36 was made by digesting pEYFP-C1-rCaMKIV WT with BamHI and XbaI, filling in the ends of the remaining plasmid with Klenow, and religating the fragment to create pEYFP-C1-rCaMKIV 1–36. The deletion was confirmed by sequencing; an Arg residue was added following Pro36. pEYFP-C1-rCaMKIV 306–474, pEYFP-C1-rCaMKIV 28–314, and pEYFP-C1-rCaMKIV E207K were made using the Stratagene Site-directed Mutagenesis kit.

The FLAG-hCaMKIV WT, FLAG-hCaMKIV K75E, FLAG-hCaMKIV E211K, and FLAG-hCaMKIV T200A expression plasmids were available in our laboratory. Transient Transfections—Transient transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) or LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subcellular Localization Experiments—HEK293A cells were plated at a density of 0.1 × 106/35-mm glass-bottomed microwell dish (Mat Tek). The DNA:Opti-MEM ratio was 0.5 μg of the indicated constructs (see figure legends) into 50 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), and the Lipo-fectAMINE:Opti-MEM ratio was 7.5 μl into 50 μl for each 35-mm dish. 36–40 h post-transfection, the cells were viewed by confocal microscopy. Leptomycin B (LMB) Treatment—Cells were transfected as indicated under “Subcellular Localization Experiments” except that the cells were treated with 10 ng of LMB (Sigma) or an equal volume of MeOH for 3 h before the cells were viewed by confocal microscopy. Confocal Microscopy—HEK293A cells were plated as described under “Subcellular Localization Experiments.” The living HEK293A cells were incubated with 25 μg/ml DAPI (Sigma) for 1 h. After this incubation, the DAPI was rinsed from the cells, 3 × 1 ml with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were viewed using a Zeiss Axiovert 100 confocal microscope and captured using Carl Zeiss Microscope Systems LSM version 3.99 software. The DAPI signal registered on the A364 channel, and the YFP/GFP proteins were visualized on the A488 channel. The merged images are false-colored: the DAPI staining in red and the YFP/GFP staining in green. Transient Transfection, CREB-Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay— HEK293A cells were plated at a density of 0.2 × 106/35-mm dish. The DNA:Opti-MEM ratio was 0.4 μg of the indicated protein kinase DNAs (see figure legends) and the additional CREB-luciferase reporter gene DNA mix (0.02 μg of β-galactosidase, 0.16 μg of Gal4-CREB, 0.4 μg of 5× Gal4-TATA-luciferase) into 100 μl of Opti-MEM. The Lipo-fectAMINE:Opti-MEM ratio was 15 μl into 100 μl. The cells were stimulated with 2.5 μm ionomycin (Calbiochem) or an equal volume of dimethyl sulfoxide carrier (Sigma) for 16–20 h and then harvested. Transfections were performed in triplicate for each condition tested on at least three occasions. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described by Kane and Means (20Kane C.D. Means A.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Transient Transfections of FLAG-tagged CaMKIV for Protein Production from HEK293A Cells—HEK293A cells were plated at a density of 1.6 × 106/100-mm dish. The DNA:Opti-MEM ratio was 4.0 μg of the indicated DNAs (see figure legends) into 400 μl. The LipofectAMINE 2000:Opti-MEM ratio was 15 μl into 400 μl. The cells were harvested 16 h post-transfection. Purification of FLAG-tagged CaMKIV from Transiently Transfected HEK293A Cells—The cells were harvested by rinsing them once with Hanks' balanced saline solution without metals (Invitrogen) then scraped into 1 ml of Nonidet P-40-based lysis buffer (2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 nm okadaic acid, 1 mm Na2VO4). The cells were incubated on ice with occasional flicking for 30 min, then they were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was the crude cell lysate. The crude cell lysate was incubated with 10 μl of α-FLAG resin (Sigma) for 4 h at 4 °C with rotation. The α-FLAG resin was washed twice in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40-based lysis buffer and once in 1 ml of TBS (137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4). The FLAG peptide (Sigma) was added to the TBS-washed resin to a final concentration of 300 ng/μl in a reaction volume of 50 μl. The resin was incubated on ice with occasional flicking for 1 h. The eluted FLAG-tagged CaMKIV was recovered in the supernatant by spinning the sample at 1,000 × g for 5 s. Coomassie Gel Analysis—Cell lysates were harvested in the Nonidet P-40-based lysis buffer as described above. Either 5 μl of crude cell lysate or 20 μl of purified lysate was resolved by 10% PAGE. The resolved proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.53Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis—Cell lysates were harvested and electrophoresed as described above. The resolved proteins were transferred from the gels to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). There they were probed with the following antibodies: α-CaMKIV (BD Biosciences), α-PP2A (BD Biosciences), α-CaMKK (BD Biosciences), α-GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), α-FLAG-m2 (Sigma), and α-CaMKI (generated by C. R. Kahl in Dr. Anthony Means's laboratory at Duke University) at a 1:1,000 dilution. The following antibodies used α-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.): α-CaMKIV, α-PP2A, α-CaMKK, and α-FLAG-m2. α-GFP and α-CaMKI used α-rabbit secondary antibodies at a 1:5,000 dilution (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). All immunoreactivity was detected using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). 125I-CaM overlay assay was performed as described by Anderson et al. (9Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G.

In Vitro Binding Assay with GST Fusion Proteins—Wild-type and mutant recombinant FLAG-tagged CaMKIV proteins were expressed in HEK293A cells as described above. GST or GST-importin-α was produced and purified using glutathione-Sepharose resin as described by Moore et al. (22Moore J.D. Yang J. Truant R. Kornbluth S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). 200 ng of each purified GST chimeric protein was mixed with the purified FLAG-tagged CaMKIV proteins in 500 μl of Nonidet P-40-based lysis buffer, and the proteins were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with rotation. The beads were then washed four times with 1 ml of Nonidet P-40-based lysis buffer and suspended in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.53Google Scholar). The bound proteins were detected by immunoblotting, α-FLAG-m2 antibody. In Vitro Phosphorylation Assays—The ability of purified CaMKIV and/or CaMKK to phosphorylate purified CREB, importin-α, or importin-β in vitro was assayed as follows. 75 ng CaMKIV, 200 ng of CaMKKβ, or 75 ng of CaMKIV and 200 ng of CaMKKβ were preincubated in kinase assay buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 μm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, and 1 μm CaM) in a volume of 30 μl). Preincubation consisted of 200 μm cold ATP and took place for 20 min with the purpose of fully activating CaMKIV with CaMKK without labeling it. Then, the incubated reactions were initiated by the addition of 0.2 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/mmol) and 2.5 μg of the indicated substrate: CREB, importin-α, or importin-β. After the 10-min reaction at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated with the addition of 7 μl of SDS protein loading sample buffer (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.53Google Scholar). The proteins were resolved using 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The incorporation of 32P into the protein substrates was determined by autoradiography. Development of a Cell-based System to Investigate the Subcellular Localization of CaMKIV—Although CaMKIV is predominantly localized to the nucleus, the mechanism of its localization remains to be elucidated. To evaluate this process, we examined the subcellular localization of ectopically expressed CaMKIV in HEK293A cells. Because it is unknown how mutations made within the CaMKIV proteins affect its interaction with the CaMKIV antibodies, we added an YFP tag at the N terminus of CaMKIV. As shown in Fig. 1A, overexpressed YFP-tagged wild-type CaMKIV localizes to nuclei of living HEK293A cells. We expressed the YFP tag alone or fused either to the NLS of the SV40 large T antigen or to β-galactosidase to determine whether the YFP tag influenced subcellular localization of fusion proteins. Expression of these fusion proteins demonstrated that YFP alone was distributed uniformly throughout the cell (Fig. 1B). Adding the SV40 large T antigen NLS resulted in accumulation of the GFP fusion protein in the nucleus (Fig. 1C), and the GFP-β-galactosidase fusion protein remained in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1D). Based on these observations, we concluded that YFP-CaMKIV fusion proteins would accurately reflect the intracellular localization of CaMKIV and CaMKIV mutant proteins. The Catalytic Domain of CaMKIV Is Necessary and Sufficient to Direct the Nuclear Localization of CaMKIV—Because CaMKIV is a ∼60-kDa protein (17Ohmstede C.-A. Jensen K.F. Sahyoun N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5866-5874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is not predicted to diffuse freely into the nucleus. Proteins greater than 40 kDa containing a polybasic NLS, like the prototypical NLS (PKKKRKV132) of the SV40 large T antigen, bind to importin-α and are actively transported into the nucleus (23Kalderon D. Richardson W.D. Markham A.F. Smith A.E. Nature. 1984; 311: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 24Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1859) Google Scholar, 25Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). We examined the amino acid sequence of CaMKIV for the presence of a canonical NLS and found that the only candidate NLS was a portion of the CaM binding domain (ARRKLK323). Therefore, we generated truncation mutants of the wild-type protein, each fused to YFP, and visualized their subcellular localization by confocal microscopy. Fig. 2A is a schematic representation of the regions each truncation protein encompassed and indicates the fragment containing the putative NLS. The first 314 amino acids of CaMKIV contain both the serine-rich N terminus and the protein kinase domain. As shown in Fig. 2B, this protein fragment entered the nucleus as a YFP fusion protein. We created two additional YFP fusion proteins to separate the serine-rich N terminus from the kinase homology domain to determine which was required for nuclear localization of CaMKIV. Our observations showed that YFP fused to the serine-rich N terminus distributed uniformly throughout the cell (Fig. 2B). In contrast, YFP fused to the kinase homology domain, CaMKIV 28–314, generated a nuclear-targeted protein kinase (Fig. 2B). These results suggested that the kinase homology domain was sufficient for nuclear entry of CaMKIV. We generated a YFP-tagged version of the C-terminal 168 amino acids (CaMKIV 306–474) and examined its localization in cells to be certain that the catalytic domain was not only sufficient but also necessary for nuclear entry. As seen in Fig. 2B, this fusion protein localized to the cytoplasm. These results were contrary to what we predicted because the putative NLS resides in the C-terminal 168 amino acids (ARRKLK323) and did not function as a NLS in the context of the truncated molecule. Thus, the protein kinase domain is both necessary and sufficient to direct nuclear entry of CaMKIV as a YFP fusion protein. Catalytic Activity Is Required for CaMKIV to Enter the Nucleus—Because of our findings that the protein kinase domain targeted CaMKIV to the nucleus, we questioned whether the activity of the protein kinase domain was required for nuclear translocation of CaMKIV. Catalytic activity of CaMKIV can be prevented by introduction of a single point mutation into the ATP binding domain. Therefore, we introduced this mutation (K71M) into the N-terminal 1–314 fragment and assessed its subcellular localization by confocal microscopy. This construct did not express well and proved deleterious for cellular survival. 2S. M. Lemrow and A. R. Means, unpublished observation. Therefore, we conducted all of our subsequent studies using mutations introduced into the full-length enzyme. We mutated the ATP binding domain (K71M) in the context of the full-length enzyme and evaluated its expression by immunoblotting. As seen in Fig. 3B, YFP-CaMKIV K71M was inactive in a CREB-mediated transcription assay. Therefore, we examined its subcellular localization by confocal microscopy. Viewing the cells revealed that this catalytically inactive mutant protein kinase (K71M) was confined to the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A) which supported the idea that catalytic activity was required for nuclear localization. To confirm the notion that catalytic activity was required for nuclear entry, we mutated the catalytic glutamate residue (Glu207) in the large lobe of the protein kinase. Based on structural analysis of other protein kinases, Glu207 was predicted to be responsible for stabilizing the internal charge of the catalytic lysine (Lys71) when the γ-phosphate of ATP is transferred to the protein substrate (26Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar, 27Hunter T. Cooper J.A. Boyer P.D. Krebs E.G. The Enzymes. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 17Google Scholar). The YFP-CaMKIV E207K fusion protein was inactive in a CREB-mediated transcription assay (Fig. 3B). This catalytically inactive mutant protein kinase (E207K) also localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A). These results confirm that nuclear entry of full-length CaMKIV required not only the presence of the protein kinase domain but also its intrinsic catalytic activity. Because kinase-competent CaMKIV molecules are substrates for the CaMKKs, we investigated whether phosphorylation of the activation loop (Thr196) was required for nuclear entry. Strikingly, the activation loop mutant, YFP-CaMKIV T196A, localized to the nucleus (Fig. 3A) but did not drive CREB-mediated transcription (Fig. 3B), confirming previous results (9Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G. Selbert M.A. Edelman A.M. Fremeau R.T. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31880-31889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These observations demonstrated that although catalytic activity was required for nuclear entry, phosphorylation of the activation loop was not. LMB Failed to Alter the Subcellular Localization of Catalytically Inactive CaMKIV Mutant Protein Kinases—Because catalytically inactive YFP-CaMKIV proteins reside in the cytoplasm, we speculated that catalytic activity might control nuclear export rather than nuclear import. To address this question, cells expressing either wild-type or catalytically inactive YFP-CaMKIV were treated with LMB, a CRM1-mediated nuclear export inhibitor, and the subcellular localization of these proteins was visualized by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3C, treatment of cells with LMB for 3 h failed to alter the cytoplasmic localization of either the K71M or the E207K mutant CaMKIV protein. Fig. 3D verified the potency of the LMB by demonstrating that GFP-HDAC4, a protein that is exported in a CRM1-dependent manner, was only observed in the nucleus in the presence of the drug (28Zhao X. Ito A. Kane C.D. Liao T.S. Bolger T.A. Lemrow S.M. Means A.R. Yao T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35042-35048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116)"
https://openalex.org/W2076135395,"Coenzyme Q (Q) functions in the electron transport chain of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The biosynthesis of Q requires a number of steps involving at least eight Coq polypeptides. Coq5p is required for the C-methyltransferase step in Q biosynthesis. In this study we demonstrate that Coq5p is peripherally associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane on the matrix side. Phenotypic characterization of a collection of coq5 mutant yeast strains indicates that while each of the coq5 mutant strains are rescued by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae COQ5 gene, only the coq5-2 and coq5-5 mutants are rescued by expression of Escherichia coli ubiE, a homolog of COQ5. The coq5-2 and coq5-5 mutants contain mutations within or adjacent to conserved methyltransferase motifs that would be expected to disrupt the catalysis of C-methylation. The steady state levels of the Coq5-2 and Coq5-5 mutant polypeptides are not decreased relative to wild type Coq5p. Two other polypeptides required for Q biosynthesis, Coq3p and Coq4p, are detected in the wild type parent and in the coq5-2 and coq5-5 mutants, but are not detected in the coq5-null mutant, or in the coq5-4 or coq5-3 mutants. The effect of the coq5-4 mutation is similar to a null, since it results in a stop codon at position 93. However, the coq5-3 mutation (G304D) is located just four amino acids away from the C terminus. While C-methyltransferase activity is detectable in mitochondria isolated from this mutant, the steady state level of Coq5p is dramatically decreased. These studies show that at least two functions can be attributed to Coq5p; first, it is required to catalyze the C-methyltransferase step in Q biosynthesis and second, it is involved in stabilizing the Coq3 and Coq4 polypeptides required for Q biosynthesis. Coenzyme Q (Q) functions in the electron transport chain of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The biosynthesis of Q requires a number of steps involving at least eight Coq polypeptides. Coq5p is required for the C-methyltransferase step in Q biosynthesis. In this study we demonstrate that Coq5p is peripherally associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane on the matrix side.

Ubiquinone, or coenzyme Q (Q), 1The abbreviations used are: Q, coenzyme Q (ubiquinone); QH2, ubiquinol; DDMQH2, demethyl demethoxy ubiquinol; DDMQ, demethyl demethoxy ubiquinone or 2-methoxy-6-polyprenyl-1,4-benzoquinone; DMQH2, demethoxy ubiquinol; DMQ, demethoxy ubiquinone or 2-methoxy-5-methyl-6-polyprenyl-1,4-benzoquinone; DHFB, dihydroxy farnesyl benzoate or 3,4-dihydroxy-5-polyprenyl benzoic acid; DMeQ3, demethyl Q3 or 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-5-farnesyl benzoic acid; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis (hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. is a polyprenylated benzoquinone lipid that is a critical component of the electron transport pathways of both eukaryotes and prokaryotes (1Crane F.L. J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 2001; 20: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Qn consists of a hydrophobic isoprenoid tail and a quinone head group. The tail length (n) varies depending on the organism studied; Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains Q6, Escherichia coli contains Q8, and humans contain Q10. The tail anchors Q in the membrane, while the head group is responsible for the redox chemistry, undergoing reversible redox cycling between the quinone (Q), semiquinone, and hydroquinone (QH2) forms. In eukaryotes Q is primarily associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane and is best known for its role in respiratory metabolism as a member of the electron transport chain shuttling electrons from Complex I (NADH:Q oxidoreductase) and Complex II (succinate:Q oxidoreductase) to Complex III (the cytochrome bc1 complex) (2Dutton P.L.

QH2 also acts as a lipid-soluble antioxidant, capable of scavenging lipid peroxyl radicals directly, or indirectly, by reducing α-tocopheroxyl radicals (3Ernster L. Forsmark-Andree P. Clin. Investig. 1993; 71: S60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 4Kagan V.E. Nohl H. Quinn P.J. Cadenas E. Packer L. Handbook of Antioxidants. Marcel Dekker, New York1996: 157-201Google Scholar). In the plasma membrane, Q participates in a trans-plasma membrane electron transport chain, in which intracellular NADH is oxidized and extracellular ascorbate free radicals are reduced (5Santos-Ocana C. Cordoba F. Crane F.L. Clarke C.F. Navas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8099-8105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recently, Q has been implicated in having a role in the rate of aging in the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (6Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. Science. 2002; 295: 120-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Q supplementation is shown to be effective in slowing the progression of Parkinson’s disease symptoms (7Shults C.W. Oakes D. Kieburtz K. Beal M.F. Haas R. Plumb S. Juncos J.L. Nutt J. Shoulson I. Carter J. Kompoliti K. Perlmutter J.S. Reich S. Stern M. Watts R.L. Kurlan R. Molho E. Harrison M. Lew M. Arch.

Ferrante K.L. Jenkins B.G. Hersch S.M. Beal M.F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1592-1599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proposed biosynthetic pathway of Q was elucidated by the characterization of E. coli and S. cerevisiae Q-deficient mutants (9Jonassen T. Clarke C.F. Kagan V.E. Quinn P.J. Coenzyme Q: Molecular Mechanisms in Health and Disease. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2001: 185-208Google Scholar, 10Meganathan R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 203: 131-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast, Q-deficient mutant strains have been placed into eight complementation groups, coq1-coq8 (9Jonassen T. Clarke C.F. Kagan V.E. Quinn P.J. Coenzyme Q: Molecular Mechanisms in Health and Disease. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2001: 185-208Google Scholar, 11Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are respiratory deficient and hence unable to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources such as glycerol. The E. coli Q-less mutants sort into ten complementation groups, ubiA-ubiH, ubiX, and ispB, and fail to grow on media containing succinate as the sole carbon source (10Meganathan R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 203: 131-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-methyltransferase step was identified as being defective in E. coli ubiE mutants which accumulate the Q biosynthetic intermediate DDMQH2 (Fig. 1, compound 3) (12Young I.G. McCann L.M. Stroobant P. Gibson F. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 105: 769-778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lee P.T. Hsu A.Y. Ha H.T. Clarke C.F. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1748-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The yeast COQ5 gene product was shown to be required for the C-methyltransferase step converting DDMQH2 to DMQH2 (Fig. 1, compounds 3 and 4, respectively) (14Barkovich R.J. Shtanko A. Shepherd J.A. Lee P.T. Myles D.C. Tzagoloff A. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9182-9188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The COQ5 and ubiE genes harbor four sequence motifs common to a wide variety of S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferase enzymes (13Lee P.T. Hsu A.Y. Ha H.T. Clarke C.F. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1748-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15Katz J.E. Dlakic M. Clarke S. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 525-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These motifs are found in a diverse group of enzymes that share a Class I methyltransferase structure (16Schubert H.L. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 329-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). A growing body of genetic evidence suggests that a complex of Coq polypeptides is responsible for Q biosynthesis. First, the same early intermediate, 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate accumulates in the panel of Q-less yeast mutants (coq3, coq4, coq5, coq6, coq7, and coq8/abc1) (17Poon W.W. Do T.Q. Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. Mol. Aspects Med. 1997; 18: S121-S127Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This is not the case with E. coli ubi mutants, where mutants accumulate the distinct Q-intermediate diagnostic of the blocked step of the Q biosynthetic pathway (18Gibson F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1973; 1: 317-326Crossref Google Scholar). Second, the coq7-1 point mutant (G104D), in contrast to the coq7-null mutant, accumulates DMQ, an intermediate only two steps away from Q (Fig. 1, compound 4) (19Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2995-3004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Finally, levels of the Coq3 polypeptide and corresponding O-methyltransferase activity are substantially lower in each of the coq-null mutants (20Hsu A.Y. Do T.Q. Lee P.T. Clarke C.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that a multisubunit complex of Coq polypeptides is involved in Q biosynthesis in yeast. This study identifies the Coq5 as a mitochondrial matrix polypeptide peripherally associated with the inner membrane, and demonstrates that Coq5p is essential for the stability and activity of other Coq polypeptides involved in Q biosynthesis. Strains and Growth Media—The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Growth media for yeast (21Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2000: 171-181Google Scholar) were prepared as described and included YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose), YPG (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 3% glycerol), and YPGal (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% galactose, 0.1% dextrose). E. coli were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth. When required, ampicillin was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. All solid media contained 2% Difco Bacto agar. Yeast and bacteria were grown at 30 °C and 37 °C, respectively.Table IGenotypes and sources of S. cerevisiae strainsStrainGenotypeSourceW303-1AMATα, ade2-1, his3-1,15, leu2-3,112, trp1-1, ura3-1R.

Open table in a new tab Construction of Yeast Expression Plasmids Containing E. coli ubiE— The pUE3 plasmid (13Lee P.T. Hsu A.Y. Ha H.T. Clarke C.F. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1748-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) contains the E. coli ubiE ORF fused to an amino-terminal mitochondrial leader sequence of COQ3, and expression is driven by the S. cerevisiae CYC1 promoter. pQM represents the single copy empty vector control for pUE3, and contains only the mitochondrial leader sequence and the CYC1 promoter segment (22Hsu A.Y. Poon W.W. Shepherd J.A. Myles D.C. Clarke C.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9797-9806Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A 1.24-kb BamHI/KpnI fragment of pUE3 was inserted into the multicopy vector pRS426 (23Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to generate pHUE3–1, a multicopy version of pUE3. To construct pS5PE1, pUE3 was digested with BamHI and EcoRI, to remove the DNA segment containing the CYC1 promoter, and a 1.0-kb fragment containing the promoter region of the COQ5 gene was inserted. The COQ5 promoter region (–1000 to –1) was prepared by PCR amplification of the template pBOB (14Barkovich R.J. Shtanko A. Shepherd J.A. Lee P.T. Myles D.C. Tzagoloff A. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9182-9188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) with the primers pQ5P-1 (–1000 to –980; 5′-CGCGGATCCGCGTTGAAGGGATTCCTTTGAGG-3′) and pQ5P-2 (–21 to –1; 5′-CCGGAATTCCGGTATATCTTTCTTGCTGCGAT-3′). The resulting 1.0-kb PCR product containing the COQ5 promoter was digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and this fragment replaced the CYC1 promoter in pUE3 as described. The 1.86-kb BamHI/KpnI fragment of pS5PE1 was inserted into pRS426 to generate pM5PE1, a multicopy version of pS5PE1. Sequence Analysis—DNA segments containing the protein coding region, and 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of COQ5 alleles were produced by PCR amplification of genomic DNA from yeast strains CH83-B1 (coq5-2), CH256-3A (coq5-3), CH259-5D (coq5-4), and CH316-6B (coq5-5). The 5′-primer pBCOQ5 (5′-CCGTGATACTATCGGCGATA-3′) corresponded to position –400 to –380, and the 3′-primer pTCOQ5 (5′-TGGCTATCACATGGCACAGG-3′) corresponded to +1040 to +1020 relative to the +1 position of the COQ5 coding region. DNA sequence analysis of the PCR product was performed as described previously (13Lee P.T. Hsu A.Y. Ha H.T. Clarke C.F. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1748-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Generation of Antisera Against Coq5p and Western Blot Analysis—A segment of the COQ5 ORF (+91 to +924) encompassing the predicted mature Coq5p was amplified with the primers pHF5 (+91 to +113; 5′-GAAGATCTCAAAGAAGAAGAAGTTAATAGTC-3′) and pHR5 (+924 to +896; 5′-GAAGATCTTTAAAVTTTAATGCCCCAATG-3′). An ∼0.83-kb fragment of COQ5 ORF was digested with BglII and inserted into the BglII site of the expression vector pTrcHisB (Invitrogen) to generate pTHQ5–1. A fusion protein containing a His6 tag at the N terminus was overexpressed in the E. coli strain DH5α. Expression of the recombinant Coq5p was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C and continued for 3 h. For purification of Coq5p, harvested cells were resuspended in 5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9 buffer containing 6 m urea and cells were disrupted by five freeze-thaw cycles and sonicated. The supernatant obtained after a 1-h centrifugation at 12,000 rpm was applied to a Ni(II)-NTA column (Qiagen). The column was washed with buffer (as above, but containing 20 mm imidazole), and the recombinant Coq5p was eluted with 250 mm imidazole in the above buffer containing 6 m urea. The His6-Coq5 fusion protein was further purified by 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon P membrane. The electrophoretically pure preparation of the fusion protein was eluted from the membrane and used to generate antiserum in rabbits (Cocalico Biologicals, Inc., Reamstown, PA). The specificity of the antiserum was confirmed by immunoblotting against mitochondria from a wild type strain and a strain containing coq5::HIS3 disruption allele. Western blot analysis was carried out as described (24Belogrudov G. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4571-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: anti-Coq3p, 1:2000; anti-Coq5p, 1:2000; anti-β subunit of F1-ATPase, 1:15,000; anti-Cyt c1, 1:1000; anti-Cyt b2, 1:5000; anti-CCPO, 1:5000; anti-Mge1p, 1:5000; and anti-porin, 1:5000. Horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies to rabbit IgG (Calbiochem) were used at a 1:1000 dilution. Mitochondrial Localization of Coq5p—Yeast were grown in YPGal media to OD600 of ∼4. Preparation of spheroplasts and cell lysate fractionation were performed as described (25Yaffe M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 627-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Crude mitochondria were further purified over a linear Nycodenz gradient (26Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Proteinase K protection experiments were carried out as described in (27Glick B.S. Brandt A. Cunningham K. Muller S. Hallberg R.L. Schatz G. Cell. 1992; 69: 809-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) using Nycodenz-purified mitochondria. Mitochondrial subfractionation was carried out by generating mitoplasts (26Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) followed by sonication (3 × 30 s on ice slurry, 50% duty cycle, 4 output setting; Sonifier W350, Branson Sonic Power Co.). Mitochondrial membrane and soluble fractions were separated by centrifugation (150,000 × g, 60 min, 4 °C). The membrane fraction was washed by repeated centrifugation. Equal aliquots of starting mitochondria, intermembrane space, membrane, and matrix fractions were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and after transfer to nitrocellulose were subjected to Western blot analysis. In Vitro C-Methyltransferase Assay—Assays of C-methyltransferase activity were performed with 2-farnesyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinol (compound 3, Fig. 1) as substrate to a final concentration of 50 μm (14Barkovich R.J. Shtanko A. Shepherd J.A. Lee P.T. Myles D.C. Tzagoloff A. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9182-9188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The assay was modified so that reactions were similar to those described for the γ-tocopherol methyltransferases (28Koch M. Lemke R. Heise K.P. Mock H.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Each reaction mixture (500 μl) contained 50 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm NADH, and 0.2–0.4 mg crude yeast mitochondrial protein. Reactions were started with the addition of S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H] methionine to a final concentration of 1 μm (PerkinElmer Life Science Products, 81.5 Ci/mmol) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Assays performed under these conditions with wild-type mitochondria showed linear rates of product formation. Reactions were stopped by addition of 5 μl of glacial acetic acid and oxidized with 25 μl of fresh 1% ammonium cerium(IV) nitrate. Lipids were extracted with 2 ml of 1:2 (v/v) chloroform/methanol and 500 μl of 0.9% (w/v) NaCl and centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5 min. The organic layer was transferred to a new tube and dried under nitrogen gas, separated by HPLC and assayed for radioactivity (22Hsu A.Y. Poon W.W. Shepherd J.A. Myles D.C. Clarke C.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9797-9806Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In Vitro O-Methyltransferase Assay—Protein concentration was determined with the BCA assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Assays of O-methyltransferase activity were performed with 3,4-dihydroxy-5-farnesylbenzoic acid (compound 1, Fig. 1) or 2-farnesyl-3-methyl-5-hydroxy-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinol (compound 5, Fig. 1) as substrate (29Poon W.W. Barkovich R.J. Hsu A.Y. Frankel A. Lee P.T. Shepherd J.N. Myles D.C. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21665-21672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The corresponding farnesylated analogs of methylated products (compounds 2 and 6, Fig. 1) served as the respective product standards. Each reaction mixture (250 μl) contained 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm ZnSO4, and 1 mg of crude yeast mitochondrial protein. Assays with compound 5 as substrate also contained 1 mm NADH. The final concentration of substrate per reaction was 50 μm. Reactions were started with the addition of S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine to a final concentration of 0.43 μm (PerkinElmer Life Science Products, 63.8 Ci/mmol) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by addition of 5 μl glacial acetic acid. The lipids were extracted twice with 1 ml of 5:2 (v/v) hexane/ethanol, dried under nitrogen. HPLC and assays for radioactivity were performed as described above. RNA Isolation and Northern Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from the yeast strains listed in Table I. Yeast were grown in YPGal media and harvested in mid-log phase (OD600 = 1.0). RNA was isolated by the hot phenol method as described (30Chanfreau G. Rotondo G. Legrain P. Jacquier A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3726-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). RNA was resolved by electrophoresis on a 1% formaldehyde gel and subsequently transferred to a Hybond-N+ charged nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was rinsed in 2× SSC (1× SSC: 0.15 m sodium chloride, 0.014 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0), UV-treated, and prehybridized in hybridization buffer containing 7% SDS, 0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% bovine serum albumin, at 65 °C for 20 min. Hybridization was performed at 65 °C overnight in hybridization buffer containing both the CHC1 and one of the COQ radiolabeled probes. Membranes were washed once with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min and once with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min, and placed under a phosphorimager screen overnight and analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, version 4.0). Four radiolabeled probes were used. A DNA segment containing 440 bp of the COQ5 ORF (924 bp) was amplified from pRSHA5–1 by PCR with primers pHF5 and pSW5–2 (+507 to +482; 5′-CTTGAAATATTTTCCTTGTTCCAT-3′). A DNA segment containing the COQ3 ORF (951 bp) and 650 bp upstream was amplified from pRS12A2–2.5Sma (31Clarke C.F. Williams W. Teruya J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16636-16644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by PCR with primers pBC3–1 (–650 to –631; 5′-TAAATTTCTGAGCTCGCCCCCGGGTATTTCATTTG-3′) and pBC3–2 (5′CGCGGGATCCATTCAGTCTCTGAATAGCCA-3′) generating a product of 420 bp.

A clathrin heavy chain specific probe was prepared from pCHCe200 (32Payne G.S. Hasson T.B. Hasson M.S. Schekman R. Mol. Cell.

The resulting PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel and purified using a DNA purification kit (Qiagen). The purified PCR products were labeled by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Science Products) and the Prime-It RmT Random Primer Labeling Kit (Stratagene). Unincorporated nucleotides were eliminated with the NucTrap push column (Stratagene). A Subset of the Yeast coq5 Mutant Strains Are Rescued by E. coli ubiE—Previous work showed that a yeast strain harboring the coq5-2 mutation was rescued for growth on glycerol media by expressing E. coli ubiE, a functional homologue of COQ5 (14Barkovich R.J.

The rescuing plasmid used in these studies, pUE3, contained the E. coli ubiE coding region fused in-frame to a mitochondrial leader sequence, and expression was driven by the yeast CYC1 promoter. To examine whether E. coli ubiE could completely substitute for yeast COQ5, a panel of coq5 mutants, including a coq5-null mutant (coq5Δ) were transformed with pUE3 and tested for the ability to grow on YPG media, which contains glycerol as a nonfermentable carbon source. As shown in Fig. 2, the E. coli ubiE gene restored growth of the yeast coq5-2 and coq5-5 mutants, but not of coq5Δ, coq5-3, or coq5-4 mutant yeast. These data indicate that the E. coli ubiE gene rescues only a subset of the yeast coq5 mutant strains. Identical results were obtained following transformation with pHUE3-1, a multicopy version of pUE3, and when ubiE was expressed from the yeast COQ5 promoter, present on either single copy (pS5PE1) or multicopy (pM5PE1) plasmids (Table II). Conversely, each of the coq5 mutants is rescued when transformed with plasmids containing the yeast COQ5 gene (Table II).Table IIA subset of yeast coq5 mutant strains are rescued by E. coli ubiEPlasmidPromoterMito leaderCopy numberGeneRelevant genotypecoq5ΔaStrain αW303Δcoq5.coq5-2bStrain CH83-B1.coq5-3cStrain CH256-3A.coq5-4dStrain CH259-5D.coq5-5eStrain CH316-6B.pQM1CYC1COQ3low------pG17-T1COQ5COQ5lowCOQ5+++++pUE3CYC1COQ3lowubiE-+--+pHUE3-1CYC1COQ3highubiE-+--+pS5PE1COQ5COQ3lowubiE-+--+pM5PE1COQ5COQ3highubiE-+--+a Strain αW303Δcoq5.b Strain CH83-B1.c Strain CH256-3A.d Strain CH259-5D.e Strain CH316-6B. Open table in a new tab Complementation Analysis of coq5 Mutants—Complementation analysis was carried out with the yeast coq5 mutant strains. As shown in Table III, diploids resulting from the mating of coq5-3 and coq5-2, or coq5-3 and coq5-5 mutants, were able to grow on YPG media, while diploids produced in all other crosses were defective for growth on YPG. These results suggest that at least two categories of coq5 mutant alleles are present in the panel of coq5 mutants: one that is defective in the C-methyltransferase step (and can be rescued by E. coli ubiE), and another that is defective in a secondary function of Coq5p.Table IIIComplementation of coq5-3 by only the coq5-2 and coq5-5 mutantsα W303Δcoq5 (Δcoq5)αCH83-B3 (coq5-2)αCH259-5D (coq5-4)αCH316-6B (coq5-5)Δcoq5----aW303Δcoq5coq5-2----aCH83-B1coq5-3-+-+aCH256-3Acoq5-4----aCH259-6Bcoq5-5----aCH316-4C Open table in a new tab Sequence Analysis of coq5 Mutant Alleles—To identify the defect in each of the coq5 mutants, DNA segments encompassing the COQ5 coding region plus 400 bp of 5′-flanking and 100 bp of 3′-flanking sequence were amplified from yeast strains bearing the coq5-2, coq5-3, coq5-4, or coq5-5 alleles. Sequence analysis revealed that each coq5 mutant allele harbored a unique nucleotide substitution, resulting in the following amino acid changes: G199D in coq5-2; G304D in coq5-3; W93STOP in coq5-4; and G121R in coq5-5 (Fig. 3). The early stop mutation present in coq5-4 results in a phenotype similar to the coq5Δ mutant. As with the coq5Δ mutant strain, coq5-4 is neither rescued by E. coli ubiE, nor does it complement the coq5-2 or coq5-5 mutants.

To probe the mechanism by which Egr2 is regulated, we used a yeast two-hybrid assay and identified an RNA helicase, Ddx20 (DP103/Gemin3), as an Egr2-interacting protein. Mammalian two-hybrid assays indicated that Ddx20 can interact with Egr1, Egr3, and Egr4, in addition to Egr2, making it the only known cofactor that interacts with all four Egr family members. Using several Egr2 target promoters, we found that Ddx20 repressed Egr2-mediated transcriptional activation with significant promoter specificity. In addition, Ddx20 repressed Egr2-mediated activation of the endogenous insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene. Interestingly, the C-terminal segment of Ddx20, which lacks the DEAD box helicase domain, was sufficient for its robust and specific repression. We also examined possible interactions between Ddx20 and Nab proteins, the only other known corepressors of the Egr family, and found that these two corepressors act independently. Finally, transcriptional repression assays performed in the presence of a histone deacetylase inhibitor (trichostatin A) indicate that although repression of certain promoters by Ddx20 requires histone deacetylase activity, another repression mechanism must also be involved. Because Egr2 is critical for hindbrain development and peripheral nerve myelination, modulation of Egr2 by Ddx20 may play an important role in maintaining the correct expression level of Egr2 target genes.

Once induced, Egr proteins activate genes that cause cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis depending upon the stimulus. The Egr proteins share a highly conserved DNA-binding domain consisting of three C2H2 zinc fingers that recognize a GC-rich sequence, as well as shorter regions of homology outside of the DNA-binding domain (1Vesque C. Charnay P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2485-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 2Crosby S.D. Veile R.A. Donis-Keller H. Baraban J.M. Bhat R.V. Simburger K.S. Milbrandt J. Proc. Natl.

Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2275-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), targeted disruption of these genes demonstrates distinct physiological roles for these proteins (4O'Donovan K.J. Tourtellotte W.G. Millbrandt J. Baraban J.M. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 167-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). One of the most dramatic phenotypes in this family arises from targeted disruption of Egr2/Krox-20 (hereafter referred to as Egr2); homozygous null mutants of Egr2 all die within 1 or 2 weeks after birth and exhibit defects in hindbrain patterning, peripheral nerve myelination, and bone formation (5Schneider-Maunoury S.

Targeted disruption of Egr2 causes the disappearance of rhombomeres r3 and r5, hindbrain segments in which Egr2 is normally expressed. Egr2 regulates several homeobox genes (Hoxa2, Hoxb2, and Hoxb3) (9Sham M.H. Vesque C. Nonchev S. Marshall H. Frain M. Gupta R.D. Whiting J. Wilkinson D. Charnay P. Krumlauf R.

Dev. 1997; 65: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which help determine the anterior-posterior positional identity of the rhombomeres. Another target gene of Egr2 in the developing hindbrain is Ephrin A4 (EphA4) (12Theil T. Frain M. Gilardi-Hebenstreit P. Flenniken A. Charnay P. Wilkinson D.G. Development. 1998; 125: 443-452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which encodes a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor. EphA4, along with other members of the Eph family and their ligands, is involved in restricting the intermingling of cells between odd- and even-numbered rhombomeres (13Mellitzer G. Xu Q. Wilkinson D.G. Nature. 1999; 400: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Finally, ectopic expression of Egr2 in r2, r4, and r6 confers odd-numbered rhombomere characteristics upon even numbered rhombomeres (14Giudicelli F. Taillebourg E. Charnay P. Gilardi-Hebenstreit P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).Egr2-null mice also exhibit defects in peripheral nerve myelination, which is essential for rapid conduction of nerve impulses along an axon. In these mice, Schwann cells are blocked at an early stage of myelination with a reduction of major myelin proteins such as myelin protein zero and myelin basic protein (7Topilko P. Schneider-Maunoury S. Levi G. Baron-Van Evercooren A. Chennoufi A.B.Y. Seitanidou T. Babinet C. Charnay P. Nature. 1994; 371: 796-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Microarray analysis of primary Schwann cells with ectopic expression of Egr2 demonstrates that Egr2 induces several genes necessary for myelination, such as myelin protein zero (MPZ), peripheral myelin protein (PMP22), and Connexin 32 (15Nagarajan R. Svaren J. Le N. Araki T. Watson M. Milbrandt J. Neuron. 2001; 30: 355-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Additional genes induced by Egr2 expression include genes that encode enzymes necessary for synthesis of the lipids that comprise myelin.Based upon the myelination defects observed in Egr2 null mice, human patients with the peripheral myelinopathies— Charcot-Marie Tooth disease, Dejerine-Sottas syndrome, and congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy—were examined for mutations in EGR2. These diseases, ranging in severity from the more mild condition, Charcot-Marie Tooth disease, to the more severe myelinopathies, Dejerine-Sottas syndrome and congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy, are most commonly caused by mutations in MPZ, PMP22, and Connexin 32 (16Warner L.E.

Sci. 2003; 210: 61-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Most of these patients have mutations in the DNA-binding domain of EGR2 that significantly reduce its DNA-binding activity. Because heterozygous Egr2 knockout mice exhibit a normal phenotype (7Topilko P. Schneider-Maunoury S. Levi G. Baron-Van Evercooren A. Chennoufi A.B.Y. Seitanidou T. Babinet C. Charnay P. Nature. 1994; 371: 796-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), it is surprising that the DNA-binding domain mutations are dominant (25Warner L.E. Svaren J. Milbrandt J. Lupski J.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1245-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Recently, however, it has been demonstrated that one of the dominant EGR2 mutants can interfere with the ability of wild-type Egr2 to activate a subset of Egr2 target genes in primary Schwann cells (15Nagarajan R. Svaren J. Le N. Araki T. Watson M. Milbrandt J. Neuron. 2001; 30: 355-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the dominant-negative activity is that EGR2 requires a cofactor or cofactor complex that is sequestered by the mutant EGR2 proteins.Although much progress has been made in understanding the physiological role of Egr2 and its regulation of target genes involved in hindbrain patterning and peripheral nerve myelination, the mechanism by which Egr2 protein regulates target genes remains relatively obscure. NAB1 and NAB2 are currently the only known corepressors of Egr2 activity (26Russo M.W. Sevetson B.R. Milbrandt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1995; 92: 6873-6877Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 27Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Apel E.D. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3545-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). NAB proteins bind directly to a conserved domain found in Egr1, Egr2, and Egr3 and repress Egr-mediated transcriptional activation of many Egr target genes. However, NAB proteins were recently found to activate rather than repress Egr activity on promoters of the luteinizing hormone β (LHβ) and fas ligand (fasL) genes (28Sevetson B.R. Svaren J. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9749-9757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). One of the congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy-associated EGR2 mutations abrogates the EGR2/NAB interaction, suggesting that this interaction is essential for properly regulating EGR2 target genes in Schwann cells (25Warner L.E. Svaren J. Milbrandt J. Lupski J.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1245-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).The activation of Egr2 target genes depends not only upon the levels of Egr2 that are induced but also upon the relative levels of Egr2 cofactors. Identification of other cofactors that regulate Egr2 will be required to develop a mechanistic understanding of how Egr2 regulates its transcriptional network. To this end, we have identified and characterized an Egr2 corepressor, Ddx20 (DP103/Gemin3).MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast Two-hybrid Screen—A high throughput yeast two-hybrid screen (29Fields S. Song O.

Amino acids 180–470 of the Egr2 protein containing the S382R, D383Y mutations were fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in pBUTE (a kanamycin-resistant version of GAL4 bait vector pGBDUC1), and the construct was transformed into yeast strain PJ694 (31James P. Halladay J. Craig E. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 18 million clones were screened via mating. After isolation of prey plasmids from positive pools, 30 prey plasmids were positive after retransformation into the bait-containing strain as well as a strain containing an additional Egr2 bait (Egr2NΔ180.R409W).Plasmids—The HA-Egr1, HA-Egr2, HA-Egr3, and HA-Egr4 constructs were described previously (28Sevetson B.R.

VP16-Ddx20.612–825 was generated by ligating the Ddx20.612–825 fragment isolated in the yeast two-hybrid screen into pVP16. Flag-Ddx20.612–825 contains an N-terminal 3xFLAG epitope fused to amino acids 612–825 of Ddx20 in the pcDNA3.1 vector. Full-length VP16-Ddx20 and Flag-Ddx20 were described previously (32Ou Q.

The full-length Nab2 construct contains the entire mouse Nab2 open reading frame in the pcDNA3.1 expression vector. The EphA4 promoter construct was created by cloning a 475-base pair enhancer fragment from the mouse EphA4 gene (containing multiple Egr2 binding sites) upstream of a minimal E1B TATA element in the pGL2 vector. The NAB2 reporter construct contains -750 to +250 of the mouse NAB2 promoter, cloned into KpnI-XhoI pGL2.

For Gal4 tethering experiments, amino acids 612–825 of Ddx20 were fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in the pM2 vector.Cell Culture and Transfections—For reporter assays, JEG-3 cells (a human trophoblast cell line) were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The JEG-3 cells were plated at 3 × 104 cells/well of a 12-well plate. Cells were transfected with the indicated expression plasmids, 250 ng of the indicated luciferase reporter plasmids, 100 ng of a cytomeglaovirus-driven lacZ reporter and pBluescript as required to make a total of 1 μg of DNA per transfection using either LT1 (Mirus, Madison, WI) or calcium phosphate. For Fig. 6, trichostatin A was added 24 h after transfection. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were harvested and the levels of luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were measured and analyzed as described previously (34Svaren J. Sevetson B.R.

QT6 cells were transfected with a total of 10 μg of DNA using LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus). 5 μg of each expression vector was used in various combinations as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection by washing twice with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and then extracted with 1 ml of lysis buffer (5% glycerol, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 140 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) with the addition of complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche) for 10 min at room temperature. 50 μl of the protein lysate and 150 μl of buffer A (lysis buffer with 50 mm NaCl and no protease inhibitors) were added to 25 μl of anti-FLAG beads (Sigma) or anti-HA beads (Roche) that had been washed twice with 500 μl of buffer A. The reactions were incubated overnight at 4°C on a rocking platform followed by five washes with 500 μl of buffer A. After the final wash, the proteins were eluted in 1× Laemmli sample buffer and detected by Western blot analysis using anti-Flag M2 (Sigma) and anti-Egr2 (Covance).Quantitative Real-time PCR—HeLa cells were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and were plated at 3 × 104 cells/ml in a 6-well plate. After 24 h, the cells were transfected as described above. Forty-eight hours after transfection, RNA was isolated from the cells using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and analyzed by quantitative PCR as described previously (38Svaren J. Ehrig T.

Amino acids 180–470 of Egr2 (removing the N-terminal activation domain; Fig. 1A) were fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, and this construct was used to screen mouse embryonic and mouse B and T cell libraries. Previous work demonstrated that expression of the Egr1 DNA-binding domain in yeast dramatically retarded their growth (39Wilson T.E. Day M.L. Pexton T. Padgett K.A. Johnston M. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3718-3724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that mutations of the DNA-binding domain relieve the growth impairment. Therefore, an additional modification of the Egr2 bait construct was the insertion of a neuropathy-associated mutation in the second zinc finger of the DNA-binding domain (S382R, D383Y), which significantly impairs the ability of Egr2 to bind DNA (18Warner L.E.

The neuropathy-associated mutations S382R,D383Y and R409W used in the yeast two-hybrid bait constructs are also indicated. In the Ddx20 diagram, all eight conserved domains of the conserved DEAD box domain are shown in gray. The region between amino acids 612–825, underlined by a black bar, is the portion of Ddx20 identified in the yeast-two hybrid assay. For B and C, QT6 cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing HA-Egr2 along with Flag-Ddx20, FlagDP103.612–825, or pBluescript as a negative control. B, lysates from the transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag conjugated beads and the isolated proteins were visualized with an anti-Egr2 polyclonal antibody. The amount of input lysate shown is 20% of the protein used in the coimmunoprecipitation assay. C, the expressed proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA conjugated beads and the isolated proteins were visualized with an anti-Flag monoclonal antibody. The amount of input lysate shown is 4% of the total protein used in the coimmunoprecipitation assay. For B and C, all lanes shown are from the same exposure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Of the 30 positive clones identified, Ddx20 (also known as DP103 and Gemin3) was isolated once with the original bait construct (Egr2NΔ180.S382R,D383Y). Ddx20 belongs to the DEAD box family of proteins named for the highly conserved Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp motif that is embedded within a domain that often exhibits ATPase and RNA helicase activities (Fig. 1A). Consistent with the presence of these motifs, Ddx20 has both ATPase and helicase activities (40Grundhoff A.T. Kremmer E. Tureci O. Glieden A. Gindorf C. Atz J. Mueller-Lantzsch N. Schubach W.H.

To eliminate the possibility that Ddx20 interacted specifically with the Egr2 mutant used in the screen, a confirmation assay was performed with a second Egr2 bait (Egr2NΔ180.R409W), which contained a mutation (R409W) in the third zinc finger corresponding to a Charcot-Marie Tooth disease-associated mutation (18Warner L.E.

Recently, other groups have shown an interaction between Ddx20 and several transcriptional activators: Epstein-Barr virus proteins EBNA2 and EBNA3C (40Grundhoff A.T. Kremmer E. Tureci O. Glieden A.

EBNA2, EBNA3C, SMN, SF-1, and METS all interact with the C-terminal half of Ddx20. Consistent with these findings, the portion of Ddx20 isolated in the yeast two-hybrid screen consisted of amino acids 612 to the end of Ddx20 (Ddx20.612–825).To further test the interaction between Egr2 and Ddx20 in a co-immunoprecipitation experiment, QT6 cells were cotransfected with HA-tagged full-length Egr2 and Flag-tagged Ddx20.612–825. Egr2 was precipitated with anti-FLAG affinity beads only in the presence of Ddx20.612–825 (Fig. 1B). To determine whether full-length Ddx20 and Egr2 could interact, we repeated the assay with full-length Ddx20 fused to an N-terminal FLAG epitope and demonstrated that Egr2 precipitated with the anti-FLAG affinity beads only when Ddx20 was present. In addition, we used anti-HA affinity beads to precipitate Ddx20.612–825 in the presence of HA-Egr2 (Fig. 1C), and the results confirmed that Egr2 interacts with the C terminus of Ddx20. Anti-Flag affinity beads were unable to precipitate HA-Egr2 (Fig. 1B), whereas anti-HA affinity beads were unable to precipitate either Flag-Ddx20.612–825 (Fig. 1C) or Flag-Ddx20 (data not shown) indicating that the co-immunoprecipitation results are specific.The Egr2/Ddx20 interaction was independently tested using a modified mammalian two-hybrid assay. A luciferase reporter plasmid containing four Egr binding sites upstream of a minimal promoter (4xEgr.syn) was cotransfected with an Egr2 expression plasmid, and the promoter activation was assayed in the presence of a Ddx20/VP16 fusion protein. If the Ddx20/VP16 fusion can interact with Egr2, the luciferase activity should be increased above the activity observed with Egr2 alone. As shown in Fig. 2B, coexpression of Ddx20-VP16 with Egr2 activated the 4xEgr.syn luciferase activity >4-fold over Egr2 alone, suggesting that Ddx20-VP16 interacts with Egr2 in mammalian cells.Fig. 2Ddx20 interacts with all four members of the Egr family. JEG-3 cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing four Egr binding sites upstream of a minimal prolactin promoter (4xEgr.syn), 25 ng of a plasmid expressing the indicated Egr construct, and the indicated amounts of a plasmid expressing full-length Ddx20 fused at its N terminus to the VP16 activation domain (Ddx20-VP16). Results are normalized to the luciferase activity of the reporter plasmid alone. Means and standard deviations of two replicate experiments are shown. VP16-Ddx20 itself activated 4xEgr.syn ∼6-fold over reporter alone (data not shown). This slight activation is probably caused by interaction with endogenous Egr proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ddx20 Interacts with Egr1, Egr3, and Egr4 —Egr2 shares a highly conserved DNA-binding domain with the other members of the Egr family (Egr1, Egr3, and Egr4) as well as other shorter conserved motifs (1Vesque C.

Cotransfection of Ddx20-VP16 and Egr1 activated the 4xEgr.syn luciferase activity >2-fold over Egr1 alone (Fig. 2A). Addition of Ddx20-VP16 and Egr3 stimulated the 4xEgr.syn luciferase activity 5-fold over Egr3 alone (Fig. 2C). Similarly, Ddx20-VP16 and Egr4 stimulated the reporter >3-fold over Egr4 alone (Fig. 2D). Thus, our data suggest that Ddx20 interacts with all four members of the Egr family making Ddx20 the only known cofactor to interact with Egr4.Ddx20 Represses the Activity of Egr2 in a Promoter-dependent Manner—Ddx20 represses the activity of steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) (32Ou Q.

https://openalex.org/W1999615291,"Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is an essential component of the translational machinery that binds m7GTP and mediates the recruitment of capped mRNAs by the small ribosomal subunit. Recently, a number of proteins with homology to eIF4E have been reported in plants, invertebrates, and mammals. Together with the prototypical translation factor, these constitute a new family of structurally related proteins. To distinguish the prototypical translation factor eIF4E from other family members, it has been termed eIF4E-1 (Keiper, B. D., Lamphear, B. J., Deshpande, A. M., Jankowska-Anyszka, M., Aamodt, E. J., Blumenthal, T., and Rhoads, R. E. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 10590-10596). We describe the characterization of two eIF4E family members in the zebrafish Danio rerio. Based on their relative identities with human eIF4E-1, these zebrafish proteins are termed eIF4E-1A (82%) and eIF4E-1B (66%). eIF4E-1B, originally termed eIF4E(L), has been reported previously as the zebrafish eIF4E-1 counterpart (Fahrenkrug, S. C., Dahlquist, M. O., Clark, K., and Hackett, P. B. (1999) Differentiation 65, 191-201; Fahrenkrug, S. C., Joshi, B., Hackett, P. B., and Jagus, R. (2000) Differentiation 66, 15-22). Sequence comparisons suggest that the two genes probably evolved from a duplication event that occurred during vertebrate evolution. eIF4E-1A is expressed ubiquitously in zebrafish, whereas expression of eIF4E-1B is restricted to early embryonic development and to gonads and muscle of the tissues investigated. The ability of these two zebrafish proteins to bind m7GTP, eIF4G, and 4E-BP, as well as to complement yeast conditionally deficient in functional eIF4E, show that eIF4E-1A is a functional equivalent of human eIF4E-1. Surprisingly, although eIF4E-1B possesses all known residues thought to be required for interaction with the cap structure, eIF4G, and 4E-BPs, it fails to interact with any of these components, suggesting that this protein serves a role other than that assigned to eIF4E.

The importance of the function of eIF4E is illustrated by the lethality of eif4e gene disruption in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (15Altmann M. Muller P.P. Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. J. Biol.

In contrast to the conserved cap binding core, the N and C termini of eIF4Es vary in length, showing little or no conservation across the phyla. Most of the residues in these regions have been shown to be dispensable for cap binding and complementation in yeast (17Vasilescu S. Ptushkina M. Linz B. Muller P.P. McCarthy J.E. J. Biol.

The relationship between eIF4E phosphorylation and eIF4E activity is not fully understood, although phosphorylation has been shown to be important for normal growth (31Lachance P.E. Miron M. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Lasko P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1656-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The positive correlation between phosphorylation and overall protein synthetic rate initially led to the supposition that phosphorylation increases the ability of eIF4E to bind cap structures. However, subsequent kinetic analysis has revealed that phosphorylation diminishes the ability of eIF4E to bind cap by increasing the off-rate of eIF4E, suggesting that phosphorylation may serve to facilitate release of eIF4E from the 5′ cap structure during the initiation cycle (32Scheper G.C. van Kollenburg B.

Recruitment of mRNA by eIF4E can also be regulated by its association with a family of small eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs), the members of which share homology with eIF4G and act as competitive inhibitors of the eIF4E/eIF4G interaction (22Marcotrigiano J. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 707-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 24Raught B. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Recently, a number of proteins with homology to eIF4E have been reported in plants, invertebrates, and mammals. Together with the translation factor, these constitute a new family of structurally related proteins. This multiplicity of eIF4Es could reflect simple functional redundancy or that the eIF4E-related proteins support alternate roles. These issues have been addressed to a limited extent in Caenorhabditis elegans, in which the existence of several eIF4E-like factors can be partially explained by the necessity of recruiting mRNAs with both 7-methyl- and 2,2,7-methylguanosine caps to the initiation complex. In most systems, however, the biological significance of multiple eIF4E-like genes remains to be explored. We describe here the characterization of two eIF4E family members in the zebrafish Danio rerio. Based on their relative identity with human eIF4E-1, these zebrafish proteins are termed eIF4E-1A and eIF4E-1B. The similarity of structure in the core regions of eIF4E-1A and eIF4E-1B to human eIF4E-1 suggests that both proteins could function as bona fide translation factors. However, we demonstrate that only eIF4E-1A possesses eIF4E-like activities and that this factor, unlike eIF4E-1B, is able to complement eIF4E deficiency in S. cerevisiae. Thus, by the analyses described, zebrafish eIF4E-1A is a functional equivalent of human eIF4E-1, whereas the role of eIF4E-1B remains to be determined. Rearing and Spawning Zebrafish—Adult Fish were purchased from Aquarium Center (Baltimore, MD) and kept at 28.5 °C in a constant flow-through system. Embryos were obtained by spontaneous spawning, maintained at 28.5 °C, and staged as described (35Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book.3 Ed. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR1995Google Scholar). Staged embryos were immediately snap-frozen and stored at -80 °C for future use. Culture of Zebrafish Cell Lines, zfl—Cells were grown at 28 °C in L-15 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum but without sodium bicarbonate. Reverse Transcription and PCR Amplification Reactions—One volume of fresh tissue, embryos, or harvested cells was homogenized in 8 volumes of Trizol (Invitrogen), essentially as described (36Chomczynski P. BioTechniques. 1993; 15 (536-537): 532-534PubMed Google Scholar). For PCR, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT)18 in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Amplification reactions (primers as indicated) were performed under standard conditions for either Pfu (Stratagene) or Taq (Fisher) DNA polymerases with 5 cycles of annealing at 58 °C, followed by 35 cycles of annealing at 68 °C. Extension for all cycles was allowed for 1 min at 72 °C. Whenever purified PCR products were transferred into plasmids, insertions were sequenced in both orientations to ensure that no errors had been introduced due to amplification. For expression studies, DNA-contamination controls included reactions treated identically but lacking reverse transcriptase, as well as reactions lacking template. The products were resolved by TAE-agarose electrophoresis and recorded in a fluorimager (Amersham Biosciences). Generation of cDNAs Encoding Zebrafish eIF4E Family Members eIF4E-1A and eIF4E-1B—A partial cDNA (EST AA542678) cloned into the vector pSPORT1 (Invitrogen) was purchased from Genome Systems Inc. and found to contain residues equivalent to all but the initiation codon and 5′-UTR of eIF4E-1A mRNA. From this partial cDNA and overlapping sequence information from the EST data base, a cDNA fragment encoding the complete eIF4E-1A protein was generated by PCR amplification using Pfu polymerase, the sense primer z4E1ANcoI5-23(F), named for the corresponding nucleotides following the ATG of eIF4E-1A, and the antisense primer z4E1ABamHI927-906(R), named by the same convention. Similarly, a cDNA fragment encoding eIF4E-1B was generated from the plasmid pBKSII(-)-zeIF4E-L (2Fahrenkrug S.C. Dahlquist M.O. Clark K. Hackett P.B. Differentiation. 1999; 65: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), using the sense primer z4E1BNcoI5-42(F) and the antisense primer z4E1BBamHI653-632(R). In either case, the purified PCR product was digested with NcoI and BamHI and transferred into the vector pCITE4a(+) (Novagen). Generation of cDNA Encoding Zebrafish 4E-BP—A DNA fragment encoding zebrafish 4E-BP was isolated following amplification by RT-PCR using Taq DNA polymerase. Primers for amplification were based on the nucleotide alignment of multiple partial sequences encoding zebrafish 4E-BP in the EST data bank, forward primer z4EBPNdeI3-24(F) and reverse primer z4EBPBamHI339-319(R). PCR products were transferred into the vector pGEM-T-easy (Promega) generating pGEMTEz4EBP. Based upon consensus sequences from alignment of multiple ESTs, no errors had been introduced during amplification. The insert was transferred into pCITE4a(+) following digestion with NdeI and BamHI generating pCITE4az4EBP. Generation of cDNA Encoding the eIF4E-binding Domain of Human eIF4GI—The 1366-bp ApaI/BamHI fragment from plasmid pBSKII(-)HFC1 (a gift from the laboratory of Dr. R. E. Rhoads) was modified by addition of the sequence CATATGTCCATGG, 5′ of the intact ApaI site such that the ATG of both the NdeI and NcoI sites introduced were in-frame with the eIF4GI coding sequence. Following the modification, the NdeI/BamHI fragment was transferred into the NdeI and BamHI sites within pCITE4a(+), generating pCITE4ah4GI4EBDHis. This encodes a protein containing amino acids 159-614 of eIF4GI fused to a C-terminal His tag and containing the eIF4E-binding domain. Use of eIF4E-deficient Yeast Strain (JOS003)—Generation of a G418-resistant S. cerevisiae strain, JOS003, lacking an endogenous functional yeast eif4e gene is described elsewhere (37Joshi B. Robalino J. Schott E.J. Jagus R. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In essence, the endogenous yeast eif4e gene was replaced by homologous recombination with a linear DNA fragment containing the G418 resistance cassette KanMX4 (37Joshi B. Robalino J. Schott E.J. Jagus R. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 38McKendrick L. Morley S.J. Pain V.M. Jagus R. Joshi B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5375-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This strain is able to survive due to the expression of Leu-selectable, extrachromosomal, human eIF4E-1, driven by the glucose-repressible, galactose-dependent GAL1 promoter. Medium lacking galactose and containing glucose suppresses growth of this strain, allowing complementation tests to be performed. All yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in either YP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone) or synthetic complete (SC) medium lacking only leucine or both leucine and uracil, as necessary. Medium was supplemented with either 2% d-galactose or 2% d-glucose (dextrose) as carbon source and 200 μg/ml G418 for continuous selection of cells lacking the yeast eif4e gene. Construction of cDNAs Encoding Variants of eIF4E-1A and eIF4E-1B Lacking the Regions N-terminal to the Conserved Cores—cDNAs encoding variants of eIF4E-1A and eIF4E-1B, which lack the regions N-terminal to the conserved cores (eIF4E-1A-(Δ1-33), and eIF4E-1B-(Δ1-32), respectively), were generated by PCR amplification using the primers z4E1ANcoI98-118(F) and z4E1ABamHI927-906(R) or z4E1BNcoI95-118(F) and z4E1BamHI653-632(R), respectively. NcoI-BamHI fragments were subsequently transferred into the plasmid pCITE4a. Construction of cDNAs Encoding Variants of eIF4E-1A-(Δ1-33) and eIF4E-1B-(Δ1-32) Fused to the N-terminal Residues of eIF4E-1B and eIF4E-1A, Respectively—DNA fragments encoding for the N-terminal region of eIF4E-1B-(Δ33-214) or sequence lacking the potential to code for this region (Δ1-32) were generated by PCR from eIF4E-1B cDNA using the primers z4E1BNcoI5-23(F) and z4E1BPstI105-84(R) and z4E1BPstI112-132(F) and z4E1BBamHI653-632(R), respectively. The PCR product encoding the N-terminal region of eIF4E-1B (eIF4E-1B-(Δ33-214)) was transferred into NcoI-PstI digested pCITE4aeIF4E-1A to generate a cDNA encoding a protein corresponding to the conserved core of eIF4E-1A fused to the N-terminal region of eIF4E-1B, eIF4E-1B-(Δ33-214)-eIF4E-1A-(Δ1-33). The PCR product lacking the potential to code for the N-terminal region of eIF4E-1B (eIF4E-1B-(Δ1-32)) was transferred into PstI-BamHI digested pCITE4aeIF4E-1A in order to generate a cDNA corresponding to the conserved core of eIF4E-1B fused to the N-terminal region of eIF4E-1A, eIF4E-1A-(Δ34-215)-eIF4E-1B-(Δ1-32). eIF4E Complementation Assay in S. cerevisiae Conditionally Lacking Functional eIF4E—Initially, NcoI-BamHI fragments from pCITE4aeIF4E constructs were transferred into the Escherichia coli expression vector pET11d. XbaI-BamHI fragments derived from the resulting pET11deIF4E constructs were subsequently transferred into the Ura-selectable yeast expression vector pRS416GPD (39Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar), which allows expression under the control of the constitutive yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter. JOS003 transfected with pRS416GPDeIF4E constructs were selected on SCGal medium containing G418 and lacking Leu and Ura. Complementation tests were performed either by streaking or plating ∼1,000 cells from a log-phase culture on YP-medium containing G418 and either galactose or dextrose. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3 days, and growth was assessed visually by colony formation. Growth on plates containing dextrose indicates the ability of an ectopic eif4e gene to complement eIF4E deficiency. Preparation of Protein Extracts from Cultured Cells or Tissues—In general, cultured cells or tissues were homogenized in 10 volumes of ice-cold buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm KCl, 0.5% Elugent, and Complete™ Protease Inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Homogenates were clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 4 °C, for 10 min). Supernatants (2-5 mg/ml protein) were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C until used. Preparation of Recombinant eIF4E and 4E-BP from E. coli—The relevant pET11deIF4E constructs were transfected into BL21(DE3)-pLysS cells and expressed as described (40Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 49-56Google Scholar). 500-ml cultures, derived from the relevant cells grown in LB medium, were induced at 0.5-0.6 A600 with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 30 min, followed by further 1.5 h of induction in the presence of 0.2 μg/ml rifampicin. The recombinant proteins were recovered from inclusion bodies, essentially by the method of Rudolph and co-workers (41Rudolph R. Bohm G. Lilie H. Jaenicke R. Creighton T.E. Protein Function: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 57-100Google Scholar, 42Lilie H. Schwarz E. Rudolph R. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) using solubilization in guanidine-HCl, followed by staged dialyses. His-tagged 4E-BP was purified from E. coli cell extracts by affinity chromatography using HisBind (Novagen). In Vitro Expression and Protein/Protein Interaction Assays—For production of 35S-radiolabeled proteins translated in vitro, the relevant pCITE4a constructs were used as templates in the rabbit reticulocyte-coupled transcription-translation system, containing [35S]Met (0.25 mCi/ml), essentially as described previously (43Jagus R. Joshi B. Miyamoto S. Beckler G. Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yamada K.M. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 11.12.11-11.12.26Google Scholar). For interaction assays, the fragment of human eIF4GI containing the eIF4E-binding domain from pCITE4ah4GI4EBDHis or zebrafish 4E-BP was co-translated with either S-tagged eIF4E-1A or eIF4E-1B in 50-μl reactions for 60 min at 30 °C. Reactions were diluted with 10 volumes of S-binding/washing buffer (Novagen) and incubated with 15 μl of S-protein-agarose (Novagen) for 45 min at 20 °C. S-protein-agarose beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed 10 times with buffer (1 ml each), prior to elution with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples of fractions, equivalent to 2 μl of the initial translation reactions, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For the interaction of zebrafish ovary eIF4Es with His-tagged 4E-BP, anti-His/protein G-Sepharose beads were prepared by binding anti-His5 antibody (Qiagen) to protein G-Sepharose beads in binding buffer containing 300 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, at 4 °C, with shaking, overnight. The beads were washed 6 times in binding buffer and incubated with His-tagged 4E-BP for 2 h at 4 °C. Binding of His-tagged 4E-BP was confirmed by Western analysis of bound material, using INDIA-HisProbe-HRP (Pierce) and ECL for visualization of bead-bound His-tagged protein. Recombinant eIF4E-1A and eIF4E-1B or ovary extracts (pooled from 10 fish) were incubated with His-tagged human 4E-BP bound to anti-His/protein G-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. After 3 washes in binding buffer and 3 washes in low salt binding buffer containing 25 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, bound proteins were eluted in 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and analyzed for the presence of eIF4E-1A and -1B by high-Tris SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. m7GTP-affinity Chromatography—Ovary extracts (from one fish) o"

A mutant S. pombe strain lacking expression of the ddb1 gene exhibited slow replication through both early and late regions causing a slow S phase phenotype. We attributed the phenotypes in the ddb1 strain to an increased activity of the replication checkpoint kinase Cds1. However, the basis for a high basal Cds1 activity in the ddb1 strain was not clear. It was shown that Ddb1 associates with the Cop9/signalosome. Moreover, the phenotypes of the Δddb1 strain are remarkably similar to the Δcsn1 (or Δcsn2) strain that lacks expression of the Csn1 (or Csn2) subunit of the Cop9/signalosome. Cop9/signalosome cooperates with Pcu4 to induce proteolysis of Spd1, which inhibits DNA replication by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase. Therefore, we investigated whether Ddb1 is required for the proteolysis of Spd1. Here we show that a S. pombe strain lacking expression of Ddb1 fails to induce proteolysis of Spd1 in S phase and after DNA damage. Moreover, deletion of the spd1 gene attenuates the Cds1 kinase activity in cells lacking the expression of ddb1, suggesting that an accumulation of Spd1 results in the increase of Cds1 activity in the Δddb1 strain. In addition, the double mutant lacking spd1 and ddb1 no longer exhibits the growth defects and DNA damage sensitivity observed in the Δddb1 strain. Our results establish an essential role of Ddb1 in the proteolysis of Spd1. In addition, the observation provides evidence for a functional link between Ddb1 and the Cop9/signalosome.

The Schizosaccharomyces pombe Ddb1 protein is homologous to the DDB1 subunit of the mammalian damaged DNA-binding protein DDB, 1The abbreviations used are: DDB, damaged DNA-binding protein; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HU, hydroxyurea; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; MBP, myelin basic protein.1The abbreviations used are: DDB, damaged DNA-binding protein; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HU, hydroxyurea; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; MBP, myelin basic protein. which contains an additional subunit DDB2 (1Hwang B.J. Chu G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The mammalian DDB has been implicated in global genomic repair (1Hwang B.J. Chu G.

The DDB2 subunit, which is not found in S. pombe or other lower organisms, is critical for recognition of damaged DNA and the global genomic repair functions of DDB (4Otrin V.R. Kuraoka I. Nardo T. McLenigan M. Eker A.P.M. Stefanini M. Levine A.S. Wood R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3182-3190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The S. pombe Ddb1 protein has been shown to be required for normal cell growth, progression through the S phase, and proper chromosome segregation (5Zolezzi F. Fuss J. Uzawa S. Linn S. J. Biol.

Although it is not clear whether those functions are conserved in the mammalian DDB1 protein, both mammalian and yeast Ddb1 have been shown to associate with Cop9/signalosome, a large complex with homology to the 19 S lid complex of the proteasome (7Groisman R.

The interaction of the mammalian DDB with the signalosome has been linked to repair, whereas the interaction of the yeast Ddb1 with signalosome has not been characterized. Cop9/signalosome was identified as a regulator of photomorphogenesis in plants (for review, see Ref. 9Cope G.A. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 2003; 114: 663-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). It was shown to control the levels of the plant transcription factors Hy5 and HyH through subcellular localization and proteolysis (10Osterlund M.T. Ang L.H. Deng X.W. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 113-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The plant signalosome complex associates with the E2 conjugating enzyme Cop1 and E3 ubiquitin ligase that are involved in the proteolysis of the Hy5 and HyH transcription factors depending upon the availability of light. Signalosome has been characterized also from mammals and fission yeast (11Mundt K.E. Porte J. Murray J.M. Brikos C. Christensen P.U. Caspari T. Hagan I.M. Millar J.B. Simanis V. Hofmann K. Carr A.M.

FASEB J. 1998; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Like the plant signalosome, the mammalian and the yeast signalosomes are involved in controlling proteolysis mediated by the cullin family of the E3 ubiquitin ligases. All cullins are modified by neddylation (NEDD8 conjugation), which is believed to be required for their ubiquitin ligase activity (13Lammer D. Mathias N. Laplaza J.M. Jiang W. Liu Y. Callis J.

For example, it was shown that the fission yeast mutant lacking expression of any of the signalosome subunits Csn1, Csn2, Csn3, Csn4, and Csn5 exhibited accumulation of the neddylated form of Pcu1 and Pcu3 (16Lyapina S.

Recent studies on the function of the S. pombe Csn1 and Csn2 subunits revealed their role in positively regulating the activity of the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) through a proteolysis of the inhibitor Spd1 (8Liu C. Powell K.A. Mundt K. Wu L. Carr A.M. Caspari T. Genes Dev. 2003; 9: 1130-1140Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Spd1 retains the Suc22 subunit of RNR in the nucleus. The periodic proteolysis of Spd1 in early S phase releases Suc22, which associates with Cdc22 in the cytoplasm to reconstitute the active RNR that is required for the biosynthesis of dNTPs (8Liu C. Powell K.A. Mundt K. Wu L. Carr A.M. Caspari T. Genes Dev. 2003; 9: 1130-1140Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It was shown that the Csn1 subunit of signalosome cooperated with Pcu4 to enhance the proteolysis of Spd1 (8Liu C. Powell K.A. Mundt K. Wu L. Carr A.M. Caspari T. Genes Dev. 2003; 9: 1130-1140Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The proteolysis of Spd1 occurs also during DNA damage requiring the activation of the checkpoint pathway (8Liu C. Powell K.A. Mundt K. Wu L. Carr A.M. Caspari T. Genes Dev. 2003; 9: 1130-1140Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It was shown that the checkpoint-dependent proteolysis of Spd1 involved Csn1 because the S. pombe strains lacking this gene failed to induce proteolysis of Spd1 after ionizing radiation (8Liu C. Powell K.A. Mundt K. Wu L. Carr A.M. Caspari T. Genes Dev. 2003; 9: 1130-1140Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These observations established a positive role of the S. pombe signalosome in the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated proteolysis of Spd1. Moreover, it was shown that mutation of Spd1 caused a reversal of many of the growth-related phenotypes of the S. pombe strains lacking expression of csn1 (8Liu C. Powell K.A. Mundt K. Wu L. Carr A.M. Caspari T. Genes Dev. 2003; 9: 1130-1140Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 11Mundt K.E. Porte J. Murray J.M. Brikos C. Christensen P.U. Caspari T. Hagan I.M. Millar J.B. Simanis V.

Our recent studies on a S. pombe strain lacking expression of Ddb1 exhibited a remarkable overlap of the phenotypes that were described for the strains lacking expression of the Csn1 or Csn2 subunits of the signalosome. As in the case of the Δcsn1 or Δcsn2 strain, the Δddb1 strain exhibited slow growth and extended S phase. We showed that there was a delay in the progression of DNA synthesis in the Δddb1 strain (6Bondar T. Mirkin E.V. Ucker D.S. Walden W.E. Mirkin S.M. Raychaudhuri P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37006-37014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Δddb1 strain was hypersensitive to DNA damage in S phase and failed to recover from hydroxyurea (HU) block (6Bondar T. Mirkin E.V. Ucker D.S. Walden W.E. Mirkin S.M. Raychaudhuri P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37006-37014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Further, as in the case of the Δcsn1 strain, the Δddb1 strain exhibited a high level of the active Cds1 kinase. Because of these overlaps in the phenotypes, we considered the possibility that Ddb1 might be involved in the same pathway with signalosome to regulate Spd1 during S phase and after DNA damage. Here we show that Ddb1 is an essential component in the proteolysis of Spd1. The S. pombe strain lacking expression of Ddb1 fails to induce proteolysis of Spd1 during the cell cycle and after DNA damage or replicative stress. Moreover, mutation in the Spd1 gene reverses many of the defects that were observed in the Δddb1 strain. The observations provide evidence for a functional link between Ddb1 and signalosome in the cell cycle- and checkpoint-regulated proteolysis of the replication inhibitor Spd1. Yeast Cultures—Cells were cultured in yeast extract plus supplements (YE5S) medium at 32 °C. Temperature-sensitive strains were cultured at room temperature (22 °C) and synchronized by a shift to 35 °C for 3 h. Genetic crosses were performed on EMM-glutamate plates. The double mutant strains were constructed by random spore analysis followed by selection on appropriate media. Genotypes were then confirmed by genomic PCR (Table I).Table IStrain listStrainGenotypeSourceARC 556h + ade6-M216 ura4-D18leu1-32Paul NurseFY 319h-ade6-M216 ura4-D18 leu1-32 can1-1 cdc25-22Susan ForsburgTB 13-1h+ ade6-M216 ura4-D18 leu1-32 ddb1::kanrOur stockTB 16h+ ade6-M216 ura4-D18 leu1-32 cdc25-22 ddb1::kanrOur stockKP 38h- ade6-704 ura4-D18 leu1-32 spd1::ura4Antony CarrTB 31-1h90 ade6-704 ura4-D18 leu1-32 ddb1::kanr spd1::ura4This studyh- spd1-GSTPaul NurseTB 36-21h+ ddb1::kanr spd1:GSTThis study Open table in a new tab UV Irradiation—For the UV sensitivity experiments, equal aliquots of cells were plated on YE5S agar in triplicate and irradiated with 0–200 J/m2 UV-C at a rate of 30 J/m2/s. Colonies were counted after incubation at 32 °C for 3 days. Survival is expressed as a percentage of colonies observed on the mock-treated plates. For the Spd1 degradation assay, cells grown in YE5S were collected on a Millipore filter, irradiated with 450 J/m2 UV-C, and resuspended in the original media. Aliquots were removed for Western blotting analysis immediately before or 20 and 40 min after irradiation. Protein Extracts and Western Blotting—For protein extracts, cells were washed with STOP buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, pH 8.0), resuspended in HB buffer (25 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 15 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 40 μg/ml aprotinin), and broken open by vortexing with glass beads at 4 °C. The extract was cleared by centrifugation. The protein concentration was estimated by the Bradford method. Extracts were boiled in SDS loading buffer and separated on SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 5% dry milk in PBS containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, the membrane was probed with anti-Cds1 antibody (a kind gift from Teresa Wang, Stanford University), anti-GST, anti-ubiquitin (Santa Cruz), or anti-Spd1 antibody (kindly provided by Paul Nurse, Cancer Research UK) followed by an appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody. For anti-Spd1 and anti-ubiquitin Western blotting, the membrane was autoclaved prior to blocking; the anti-Spd1 antibody was precleared by incubation with nitrocellulose to adsorb background signal. The signal was visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Pulse-Chase—Cells were growth into log phase in YE5S, span down, and resuspended in YE5S without methionine at 2 × 107 cells/ml. After a 1-h incubation, Tran35S-label (ICN) was added to 20 μCi/ml, and the cells were labeled for 1 h. Cells were washed with water and resuspended in YE5S supplemented with 1 mg/ml cold methionine and 10 mm HU. At different time points, cells were harvested, washed with STOP buffer, and lysed in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100) with protease inhibitors. 1 mg of the extract was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2hat4 °C, and the bound Spd1-GST was washed three times with 1 ml of NETN buffer and then eluted with 100 mm glutathione in NETN. The eluted Spd1-GST was mixed with SDS loading buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and the radioactive bands visualized by autoradiography and quantified by PhosphorImager. In Vivo Ubiquitination—Log phase cells expressing Spd1-GST along with a control untagged strain were grown in YE5S in the presence of 10 mm HU for 3 h. Cell extraction and GSH bead binding were performed exactly as for the pulse-chase assay except that 5 μm N-ethylmaleimide was added to the lysis buffer, and Spd1-GST was eluted with SDS-loading dye. 25 mg of total protein of the control and Spd1-GST strains and 4 mg of total protein for the Δddb1Spd1-GST strain were used to normalize the amount of Spd1-GST. The Spd1-GST-ubiquitin conjugates were visualized by Western blotting. Cds1 Kinase Assay—1-mg protein extracts were incubated with 0.5 μl of anti-Cds1 rabbit antibody prebound to 20 μl of protein G beads for 1 h at 4 °C with constant mixing. The kinase reaction was performed as described previously (6Bondar T. Mirkin E.V. Ucker D.S. Walden W.E. Mirkin S.M. Raychaudhuri P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37006-37014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). FACS—Preparation of cell ghosts and flow cytometry were done as described previously (6Bondar T.

S Phase Proteolysis of Spd1 Requires Ddb1—We showed that the S. pombe strain lacking expression of ddb1 exhibited a defective S phase, including slow replication, which could be explained by the increased Cds1 kinase activity in that strain (6Bondar T. Mirkin E.V. Ucker D.S. Walden W.E. Mirkin S.M. Raychaudhuri P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37006-37014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the signalosome mutant Δcsn1, which failed to cause proteolysis of Spd1 in S phase, also exhibited an extended S phase and increased Cds1 activity (8Liu C. Powell K.A. Mundt K. Wu L. Carr A.M. Caspari T. Genes Dev. 2003; 9: 1130-1140Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 11Mundt K.E. Porte J. Murray J.M. Brikos C. Christensen P.U. Caspari T. Hagan I.M. Millar J.B. Simanis V. Hofmann K. Carr A.M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1427-1430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether Ddb1 is required for the proteolysis of Spd1. The proteolysis of Spd1 is critical for the biosynthesis of dNTPs, which is essential for DNA synthesis. A deficiency in Spd1 proteolysis is expected to slow down S phase progression and cause replicative stress, which would explain many of the phenotypes (including the increased Cds1 activity) observed in the Δddb1 strain (6Bondar T. Mirkin E.V. Ucker D.S. Walden W.E. Mirkin S.M. Raychaudhuri P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37006-37014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We compared the steady-state levels of Spd1 in the Δddb1 strain with that in the wild type strain in Western blot assays using a specific antiserum raised against Spd1. The results of that analysis clearly indicated a significant accumulation of Spd1 in the Δddb1 strain compared with the wild type (Fig. 1A). The proteolysis of Spd1 occurs in S phase during each cycle of division to allow for an increase in the RNR activity (8Liu C. Powell K.A. Mundt K. Wu L. Carr A.M. Caspari T. Genes Dev. 2003; 9: 1130-1140Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To analyze the cell cycle proteolysis of Spd1, we compared the cdc25-22 strain with the Δddb1 cdc25-22 strain (19Russell P. Nurse P. Cell. 1986; 45: 145-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). The cdc25-22 encodes a temperature-sensitive allele of cdc25, which allows synchronization of the cells in G2 phase of the cell cycle. The cells were arrested by incubating for 3 h at a nonpermissive temperature (35 °C) followed by release to a permissive temperature (22 °C). At different times after the release, cells were harvested for protein extraction and cell cycle distribution analysis. The cell cycle distribution was determined by counting the septation index (Fig. 1B), which confirmed the synchronous progression of the cells through the cell cycle. Cell extracts were prepared following a procedure described previously (6Bondar T. Mirkin E.V. Ucker D.S. Walden W.E. Mirkin S.M. Raychaudhuri P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37006-37014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). 0.5-mg extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis, which was probed with Spd1 antibody or with Cds1 antibody (as a loading control). The level of the Spd1 protein decreased in S phase of the wild type cells, but there was no detectable change in the level of Spd1 observed in the extracts from the Δddb1 strain (Fig. 1B). The lack of decrease in the levels of Spd1 in the Δddb1 strain is consistent with a requirement for Ddb1 in the proteolysis of Spd1 in S phase. Treatment with HU, which reduces the levels of dNTPs and causes an S phase arrest, was shown to cause proteolysis of Spd1 (8Liu C. Powell K.A. Mundt K. Wu L. Carr A.M. Caspari T. Genes Dev. 2003; 9: 1130-1140Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The proteolysis of Spd1 occurs in HU-treated cells because the cells are in S phase. Moreover, a proteolysis of Spd1 increases the activity of RNR which helps recovery of the cells from HU arrest. We measured the steady-state level of the Spd1 protein in the wild type strain and in the Δddb1 strain or in strains in which the endogenous Spd1 is replaced by Spd1-GST. The treatment with 10 mm HU for 3 h caused a dramatic reduction in the steady-state levels of native Spd1 or Spd1-GST in the wild type background. However, in the Δddb1 background, the levels of Spd1 (Fig. 2A) or Spd1-GST (Fig. 2B) remained essentially unaffected. To confirm further a deficiency in the proteolysis of Spd1 in the Δddb1 strain, we determined the decay rate of Spd1-GST in the wild type and in the Δddb1 cells after a treatment with HU. The cells were pulse labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h before the addition of HU. The pulse-labeled cells were transferred to medium containing unlabeled methionine (chase) and 10 mm HU. At different time intervals, cells were harvested, and the cell lysates were bound to GSH beads to purify the Spd1-GST protein. After an extensive wash, the proteins bound to the GSH beads were eluted and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography (Fig. 3A). The band intensities were quantified by PhosphorImager and plotted against time of chase (Fig. 3B). As expected, the addition of HU caused a much faster decay of Spd1-GST in the wild type background relative to that observed in the Δddb1 strain treated with HU (Fig. 3B). The half-life of Spd1-GST in the Δddb1 strain was greater than 3 h in the presence of HU, whereas in the wild type background the half-life was less than 2 h. These observations further confirm the notion that the proteolysis of Spd1 is defective in the Δddb1 strain.Fig. 3Efficient decay and ubiquitination of Spd1 require Ddb1. A, Spd1-GST strains (wild type (wt) and Δddb1 background) were labeled with [35S]methionine, and the label was chased for 3 h in the presence of 10 mm HU. Extracts were bound to glutathione beads, eluted and resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. The band intensities were quantified by PhosphorImager (B). C, Spd1-GST or Δddb1 Spd1-GST cells were treated with 10 mm HU for 3 h, and Spd1-GST was purified on glutathione beads and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The extract of an untagged strain was used as a control for nonspecific binding of ubiquitinated proteins to the glutathione beads. The ubiquitin-Spd1-GST conjugates were detected by Western blotting with anti-ubiquitin (α-Ub) antibody. The same membrane was reprobed with anti-GST antibody to verify equal loading of Spd1-GST protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because it was shown that Spd1 is degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (8Liu C. Powell K.A. Mundt K. Wu L. Carr A.M. Caspari T. Genes Dev. 2003; 9: 1130-1140Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we sought to investigate whether the Δddb1 strain is deficient in ubiquitinating Spd1-GST. To enrich the cell population for S phase cells where Spd1 is normally degraded, we looked at the ubiquitination of Spd1-GST in the presence of HU. The extracts from the HU-treated wild type and the Δddb1 strains expressing Spd1-GST were compared for the levels of ubiquitinated Spd1-GST. Because the level of Spd1-GST in the HU-treated Δddb1 strain is at least 6-fold higher than that in the wild type background, we normalized extract loads to the amounts of Spd1-GST. The extracts were bound to GSH beads to purify the Spd1-GST protein. Also, to control for the binding of nonspecific ubiquitinated protein to GSH beads, an equal amount of extract from an untagged wild type strain was used in a parallel set. The bound fractions were analyzed for ubiquitinated Spd1-GST using a Western blot assay and a monoclonal antibody against ubiquitin. The blot was also probed with GST antibody to confirm approximately equal loading of the Spd1-GST. As seen in Fig 3C, polyubiquitinated Spd1-GST was detected from cells with wild type background but not the Δddb1 background. The results are congruent with the notion that the Δddb1 strain is deficient in inducing the ubiquitination of Spd1. Deletion of the Spd1 Gene Reduces the Constitutively High Cds1 Activity in Δddb1 Strain—We showed that the Δddb1 strain exhibited a constitutively high basal activity of the replication checkpoint kinase Cds1 (6Bondar T. Mirkin E.V. Ucker D.S. Walden W.E. Mirkin S.M. Raychaudhuri P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37006-37014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The high basal Cds1 activity was linked to many if not all growth-related defects and DNA damage sensitivity in the Δddb1 strain because mutation in the cds1 gene reversed the defects, and the double mutant Δddb1 Δcds1 behaved like the wild type strain. It was, however, not clear why the Δddb1 strain exhibited a high basal level of the Cds1 activity. Interestingly, the Δcsn1 strain also exhibited a high basal Cds1 activity, and deletion of the spd1 gene reduced the Cds1 activity to a level observed for the wild type cells. Therefore, we sought to investigate whether a deletion of the spd1 gene would reduce the Cds1 activity in Δddb1 cells. We constructed a double mutant, Δddb1 Δspd1, lacking the expression of both ddb1 and spd1 genes. The double mutant was compared with the single mutants and with the wild type strain for the basal Csd1 activity. To assay for the Cds1 activity, cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against Cds1. The immunoprecipitates were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads. The beads containing the immunopurified Cds1 were used to measure the activity of Cds1. In parallel, aliquots of the extracts were subjected to Western blot assays to compare the protein level of Cds1 from the various extracts (Fig. 4). The kinase activity of Cds1 was measured following a procedure described previously using myelin basic protein and [γ-32P]ATP as substrates. The reaction product was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The phosphorylated MBP was quantified by PhosphorImager. Consistent with our previous results, the Δddb1 strain exhibited a significantly high level of the activated Cds1. In addition, we observed that the double mutant lacking expression of both Δddb1 and Δspd1 exhibited a much lower level of active Cds1. The level of active Cds1 in the double mutant was comparable with the Δspd1 single mutant strain (Fig. 4). These observations are consistent with the notion that the high Cds1 activity in Δddb1 strain is a result of the deficiency in the proteolysis of Spd1. Mutation in the spd1 Gene Reversed the Growth and Size Abnormalities in the Δddb1 Strain—The Δddb1 cells exhibited several growth-related defects, including elongated cell phenotype, increased doubling time, small colony size, and slow S phase progression. We attributed those defects in the Δddb1 cells to the high basal Cds1 activity. Because the spd1 mutation attenuated the Cds1 activity in the Δddb1 cells, we predicted that the growth-related defects in the Δddb1 strain would not be observed in the Δddb1 Δspd1 double mutant. The Δddb1 mutant displays slow growth, which is reflected by smaller colony size compared with the wild type cells. If Spd1 is the cause of t"

Selective thrombin exosite II mutations did not affect the DS-catalyzed inactivation rate significantly (23Sheehan J.P. Tollefsen D.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol.

Blocking exosite II with HD22, a single-stranded DNA aptamer only had a modest effect on this inactivation rate, and DS with a chain length of 12–20 saccharide units was found to be as effective as higher Mr DS in catalyzing thrombin inactivation (25Liaw P.C.Y.

Haemostas. 2003; 1: 1535-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These findings, and the assumption that DS template action, like heparin, engages exosite II, led to the proposal of a mechanism in which direct interaction of the HCII N-terminal domain with exosite I is predominant, and GAG template action may be less important, or not even obligatory. In the mechanism of high affinity heparin-catalyzed thrombin inactivation by AT, tight binding was shown to occur between AT and the heparin molecule, containing high affinity pentasaccharide repeats, with an apparent dissociation constant KAT(H) of 0.01–0.02 μm (29Nordenman B. Danielsson A.Å. Björk I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 90: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and this binary complex bound free thrombin to form the productive ternary complex. By contrast, low affinity heparin with Mr 7,900 bound AT with KAT(H) 19 μm, and thrombin with KT(H) 0.69 μm, resulting in preferred formation of the T·H binary complex, which bound free AT (4Olson S.T.

Preferred formation of AT·H and T·H complexes as intermediates on the pathway to ternary complex formation is governed by the differences in the dissociation constants of the binary complexes. Heparin acts as a template in the ternary T·H·AT complexes with high and low affinity heparin, bridging AT helices A and D, and thrombin exosite II. No acidic N-terminal sequence is present in AT, and the heparin-catalyzed thrombin inactivation mechanism is driven by template formation, as evidenced by the bell-shaped, logarithmic dependence of the inactivation rate constant on the heparin concentration (30Streusand V.J.

J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28660-28665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, unlike for the heparin-catalyzed thrombin-AT reaction, no mechanism is available for the GAG-catalyzed thrombin-HCII reaction that simultaneously describes the template and allosteric behavior, and fits the GAG and HCII dependences of the inactivation rate constant, consistent with independently obtained protein-GAG binding constants. The aim of the present work was to characterize the roles of heparin and DS in the inactivation of thrombin by HCII, and, for the first time, to define a mechanism that fits both the HCII and GAG concentration dependences of thrombin inactivation kinetics, and is consistent with binary T·GAG and HCII·GAG complex dissociation constants obtained independently by equilibrium binding. The results support the conclusions that the preferred pathway for ternary complex formation with thrombin, HCII and GAGs proceeds via the T·GAG binary intermediate, and that the inactivation mechanism combines GAG template action and allosteric regulation via direct HCII binding to thrombin exosite I in the T·GAG complex. Although the proposed mechanism involves obligatory ternary complex formation by GAG template action, it does not contradict the allosteric interaction between the HCII N-terminal sequence and thrombin exosite I, but it places this interaction in a preferred pathway of T·GAG interacting with HCII, rather than HCII·GAG interacting with thrombin. The present study also demonstrated a novel binding site for DS on thrombin, outside exosite II, which may participate in GAG template formation, and could explain the limited attenuating effect of exosite II ligands and thrombin exosite II mutants in the DS-catalyzed inactivation.

Equilibrium Binding of Thrombin and HCII to DS and Heparin, Measured by Quantitative Affinity Chromatography—Binding of thrombin and HCII to Mr 18,000 DS and Mr 16,000 and 20,300 heparin was analyzed by quantitative affinity chromatography (QAC) under nonsaturating matrix conditions (49Nichol L.W.

Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4856-4860Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), using low substitution grade heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for thrombin binding, or heparin-Sepharose prepared by coupling unfractionated porcine heparin to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B, at 2 mg of heparin/ml drained gel (45March S.C. Parikh I. Cuatrecasas P. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 60: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar), for HCII binding. QAC allows the quantitation of competitive displacement of thrombin or HCII by heparin or DS from heparin-Sepharose. To determine kax[X]0, the product of the concentration of matrix binding sites [X]0 and the association constant kax for protein and matrix-bound heparin, binding isotherms of bound versus free protein were established in the absence of GAG, under nonsaturating thrombin and HCII conditions. Thrombin and HCII binding experiments were performed in separate PEG-coated microcentrifuge tubes with continuous mixing, or, for HCII, in a 10-ml Amicon concentrator cell, using the recycling partition method (50Hogg P.J. Winzor D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and sequential additions of small aliquots of concentrated ligand solution. Increasing amounts of thrombin or HCII were incubated with a constant volume of matrix, <5% of the total, constant incubation volume (1 ml, microcentrifuge tubes; 6.5 ml, recycling partition method). Residual thrombin in the supernatant was assayed by hydrolysis of S2288 at 405 nm. Residual HCII was determined by protein absorbance of the supernatant at 280 nm, and by GAG-catalyzed thrombin inactivation in the presence of competing chromogenic substrate as described below. Appropriate thrombin and HCII concentration ranges for GAG binding were limited to nonsaturation matrix conditions defined by the initial, quasi-linear portion of the hyperbolic bound versus free protein binding isotherms to heparin-Sepharose matrix in the absence of competing GAG. In separate experiments, thrombin and HCII at constant concentrations (12 nm thrombin, and 3.4, 7.6, and 8.6 μm HCII, in the heparin binding experiments; 0.46 μm thrombin and 3 μm HCII, in the DS binding experiments), were incubated with a constant amount of heparin-Sepharose matrix, and increasing concentrations of GAG. In the heparin binding experiment, initially 51% thrombin and 54–58% HCII were bound to the matrix; in the DS binding experiment, initially 97% thrombin and 56% HCII were bound, at total protein concentrations well below matrix saturation. Bound thrombin ([T]bound) and HCII ([HCII]bound) as a function of the increasing total GAG concentration ([GAG]o) was analyzed using hyperbolic Equations 1 and 2, and the mass balance for total T or HCII ([T or HCII]o = [T or HCII]bound + [T or HCII]free), to obtain KT(H), KHCII(H), KT(DS), and KHCII(DS) (55Tian W.-X.

[6F]FFR-T was titrated with Mr 30,000 DS in pH 7.8 buffer, in the absence and the presence of 5 μm Hir54-65(SO3-). [6F]FPR-T was titrated with DS in pH 7.4 and 7.8 buffer. In separate experiments, [6F]FPR-T was titrated with high (12,000) and low Mr (5,000) heparin, in the absence and presence of 5 μm Hir54-65(SO3-). Labeled thrombin concentrations were below or at KT(H), to avoid heparin-induced thrombin aggregation (54Hogg P.J. Jackson C.M. Labanowski J.K. Bock P.E. J. Biol.

In separate experiments, [5F]Hir54-65(SO3-) was titrated with thrombin, in the absence and presence of 176 μm Mr 30,000 DS; 27.6 and 206 μm Mr 12,000 heparin; and 117 μm Mr 5,000 heparin. Direct binding of GAGs to labeled thrombin and MzT(-F1), expressed as the fractional change in initial fluorescence (ΔF/Fo), was analyzed by fitting of the quadratic equation for binding of a single ligand (39Bock P.E.

The observed fluorescence change is given by the contribution of the T*·GAG complex, weighted by the maximum fluorescence change associated with its formation (Equation 3), ΔFFo=([T*·GAG]n[T*]o)ΔFmax,T(GAG)Fo(Eq. 3) in which [T*]0 is the total concentration of the labeled thrombin or MzT(-F1), and n is the number of equivalent and independent binding sites for GAG. Binding of thrombin to [5F]Hir54-65(SO3-) was analyzed similarly, where the fractional change in fluorescence was given by Equation 4, ΔFFo=([T·Hir*]n[Hir*]o)ΔFmax,T(Hir)Fo(Eq. 4) in which [Hir*]0 is the total concentration of the labeled peptide (Hir*), T is thrombin, and n is the number of binding sites for GAG. [6F]FPR-T reported GAG and Hir54-65(SO3-) binding by unequal fluorescence changes, while GAG binding to thrombin had no effect on ΔFmax/Fo in the [5F]Hir54-65(SO3-) titrations. Experiments with simultaneous GAG and peptide binding to thrombin were analyzed by Equations 5 and 6 for the ternary complex model (see Scheme 1), as described previously (53Verhamme I.M. Olson S.T.

https://openalex.org/W2061407457,"Annexin 2 belongs to the annexin family of proteins that bind to phospholipid membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Here we show that, under mild acidic conditions, annexin 2 binds to and aggregates membranes containing anionic phospholipids, a fact that questions the mechanism of its interaction with membranes via Ca2+ bridges only. The H+ sensitivity of annexin 2-mediated aggregation is modulated by lipid composition (i.e. cholesterol content). Cryo-electron microscopy of aggregated liposomes revealed that both the monomeric and the tetrameric forms of the protein form bridges between the liposomes at acidic pH. Monomeric annexin 2 induced two different organizations of the membrane junctions. The first resembled that obtained at pH 7 in the presence of Ca2+. For the tetramer, the arrangement was different. These bridges seemed more flexible than the Ca2+-mediated junctions allowing the invagination of membranes. Time-resolved fluorescence analysis at mild acidic pH and the measurement of Stokes radius revealed that the protein undergoes conformational changes similar to those induced by Ca2+. Labeling with the lipophilic probe 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine indicated that the protein has access to the hydrophobic part of the membrane at both acidic pH in the absence of Ca2+ and at neutral pH in the presence of Ca2+. Models for the membrane interactions of annexin 2 at neutral pH in the presence of Ca2+ and at acidic pH are discussed. Annexin 2 belongs to the annexin family of proteins that bind to phospholipid membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Here we show that, under mild acidic conditions, annexin 2 binds to and aggregates membranes containing anionic phospholipids, a fact that questions the mechanism of its interaction with membranes via Ca2+ bridges only. The H+ sensitivity of annexin 2-mediated aggregation is modulated by lipid composition (i.e. cholesterol content). Cryo-electron microscopy of aggregated liposomes revealed that both the monomeric and the tetrameric forms of the protein form bridges between the liposomes at acidic pH. Monomeric annexin 2 induced two different organizations of the membrane junctions. The first resembled that obtained at pH 7 in the presence of Ca2+. For the tetramer, the arrangement was different. These bridges seemed more flexible than the Ca2+-mediated junctions allowing the invagination of membranes. Time-resolved fluorescence analysis at mild acidic pH and the measurement of Stokes radius revealed that the protein undergoes conformational changes similar to those induced by Ca2+. Labeling with the lipophilic probe 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine indicated that the protein has access to the hydrophobic part of the membrane at both acidic pH in the absence of Ca2+ and at neutral pH in the presence of Ca2+. Models for the membrane interactions of annexin 2 at neutral pH in the presence of Ca2+ and at acidic pH are discussed.

Weber K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1688-1695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AnxA2 is composed of two structural domains, the core and the N-terminal tail. The core domain contains four repeats (I–IV) of ∼70 residues structured in a bundle of five α-helices organized in a right-handed superhelix. Each repeat harbors a Ca2+-binding site on the convex face of the molecule (2Burger A. Berendes R. Liemann S. Benz J. Hofmann A. Gottig P. Huber R. Gerke V. Thiel C. Romisch J. Weber K. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The N-terminal tail contains the P11 binding region (3Johnsson N. Marriott G. Weber K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2435-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 4Becker T. Weber K. Johnsson N. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4207-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5Rety S. Sopkova J.

The role of AnxA2 is still not well understood, but the protein has been implicated in membrane-membrane and membrane-cytoskeleton interactions and, specifically, in the regulation of intracellular transport steps such as exocytosis and endocytosis (for reviews see Refs. 6Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149–150: 301-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar and 7Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-mediated binding of annexins to membranes at neutral pH is dependent on the presence of anionic phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine (PS) or phosphatidylinositol (8Glenney Jr., J.R. Tack B. Powell M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 9Blackwood R.A. Ernst J.D. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). A large set of data shows that Ca2+ binding to annexins in the absence of membranes induces a conformational change. In the case of AnxA5, it results in the swinging out of Trp-187 in repeat III from a buried to a solvent-exposed position (10Meers P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3325-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 11Sopkova J. Renouard M. Lewit-Bentley A. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11962-11970Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Trp-212 in AnxA2 detects also a Ca2+-induced conformational change in repeat III, but this residue remains buried in the protein (15Pigault C. Follenius-Wund A. Lux B. Gerard D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1037: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 16Ayala-Sanmartin J. Vincent M. Sopkova J. Gallay J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15179-15189Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The major difference between the membrane-free and the membrane-bound forms of annexin 2 is the Ca2+ sensitivity. Although the Ca2+-induced conformational change of AnxA2 in the presence of phospholipid membranes requires Ca2+ close to the millimolar concentration, (AnxA2-P11)2 needs only submicromolar concentration (8Glenney Jr., J.R. Tack B. Powell M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 9Blackwood R.A. Ernst J.D. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 16Ayala-Sanmartin J. Vincent M. Sopkova J. Gallay J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15179-15189Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The conformational change correlates with membrane aggregation and not with membrane binding (17Ayala-Sanmartin J. Gouache P. Henry J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15190-15198Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This suggested that the Ca2+-induced conformational change of annexin 2 is essential for its aggregative function but not for membrane binding. Recent observations suggest that the mechanism of binding of these proteins to cellular membranes could be more complex and would not absolutely require Ca2+. A Ca2+-independent binding of annexin 2 to membranes has been described for chromaffin granules (18Drust D.S. Creutz C.E. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19Ayala-Sanmartin J. Henry J. Pradel L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1510: 18-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), endosomes (20Jost M. Zeuschner D. Seemann J. Weber K. Gerke V. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 221-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), other biological membranes (21Liu L. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and liposomes (19Ayala-Sanmartin J. Henry J. Pradel L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1510: 18-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 22Powell M.A. Glenney J.R. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 23Ayala-Sanmartin J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This Ca2+-independent binding also requires the presence of anionic phospholipids such as PS in the bilayer (19Ayala-Sanmartin J. Henry J. Pradel L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1510: 18-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A pH-dependent membrane binding has been described for several annexins. Annexins 2, 5, and 6 extracted from matrix vesicles partition into organic phases at acidic pH (24Genge B.R. Wu L.N. Adkisson H.D.T. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10678-10685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting an increase in the hydrophobicity of the proteins. Annexins 1, 2, 5, 6, and 12 are able to bind to phospholipidic membranes at mild acidic pH in the absence of Ca2+ (25Hoekstra D. Buist-Arkema R. Klappe K. Reutelingsperger C.P.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3015-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) suggested that these annexins became more hydrophobic at acidic pH. Langen et al. (28Langen R. Isas J.M. Hubbell W.L. Haigler H.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14060-14065Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) proposed the change of two α-helices and their inter-helical hydrophilic loop into a transmembrane α-helix. The proposed conformational change of repeat II occurred only in the presence of membranes. However, this hypothesis is not consistent with experiments in which AnxA5 labeled by the fluorophore bis-1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate at pH 7 or 5, either in the presence or absence of vesicles, showed similar fluorescence spectra, indicating the absence of macroscopic pH-dependent changes in the environment of the probe (25Hoekstra D. Buist-Arkema R. Klappe K. Reutelingsperger C.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14194-14202Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Here, the effect of acidification of the medium on the capacity of membrane binding and membrane aggregation, on the nature of the annexin 2-membrane junctions, and on the H+ phospholipid-induced conformational changes were investigated. Models for the H+-mediated membrane association and aggregation of annexin 2 are discussed. Type III-B l-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC), l-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine (PS), BAPTA, bovine serum albumin, and ovalbumin were from Sigma. AnxA2 produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and P11 produced in Escherichia coli were purified as described (17Ayala-Sanmartin J. Gouache P. Henry J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15190-15198Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). (AnxA2-P11)2 was obtained by mixing equimolar quantities of AnxA2 and P11. The AnxA2 mutant L127W/W212F (31Thiel C. Weber K. Gerke V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14732-14739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Dr. V. Gerke (Münster, Germany). AnxA5 was a kind gift of Dr. A. Hofmann. 3-(Trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine ([125I]TID) (9.25 MBq/50 μl) was from Amersham Biosciences. Large unilamellar vesicles (50–100 nm liposomes) were prepared by extrusion as described previously in buffer A (Hepes 40 mm, pH 7, KCl 30 mm, EGTA 1 mm) (32Faure A.V. Migne C. Devilliers G. Ayala-Sanmartin J. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 276: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The liposomes used in this study were PC/PS and PC/PS/cholesterol (75:25 and 50:25:25 by weight). Binding of the proteins to membranes was performed as described (23Ayala-Sanmartin J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In brief, after 170,000 × g centrifugation, pellets and supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The pH was controlled using buffers A, pH 7, B (Mes 40 mm, pH 6, KCl 30 mm, EGTA 1 mm), and C (Na+ acetate 40 mm, pH 4, KCl 30 mm, EGTA 1 mm). Intermediate pH values were obtained by mixing the different buffers and were controlled with a pH meter. EGTA is a poor chelator at acidic pH but was conserved in the buffers to keep the homogeneity in composition. The effect of salt concentration (KCl) on AnxA2 binding was tested at pH 5.2 and 4.5. KCl did not change the pH of the solutions. Liposomes (25 μg) were incubated with 4 μg of AnxA2 in 50 μl of buffer at pH 7 or pH 4. The mixtures were incubated 20 min at room temperature and then were centrifuged for 30 min at 170,000 × g. Primary pH 7 pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of buffer at pH 7, as were primary pH 4 pellets (pH 4 to pH 7 reversibility). After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, the samples were centrifuged as before. The secondary pellets and primary and secondary supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Liposomes were prepared by extrusion. Chromaffin granules were obtained as described (17Ayala-Sanmartin J. Gouache P. Henry J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15190-15198Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) in buffer E (Hepes 10 mm, pH 7, saccharose 0.3 m). Aggregation experiments were performed as described (17Ayala-Sanmartin J. Gouache P. Henry J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15190-15198Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In brief, aggregation was measured by the increase in the turbidity at 340 nm for liposomes, and at 540 nm for chromaffin granules for 7 min at 28 °C. The pH was controlled as described for the membrane binding experiments. 30 μg of liposomes in 50 μl of buffer (pH 4.5 or pH 7 in the presence of 1 mm free Ca2+) were incubated with 1 μCi (in 1 μl ethanol) of [125I]TID for 15 min at room temperature in the dark to allow the hydrophobic probe to partition into membranes. Thereafter, 10 μg of protein were added, and the samples were incubated for 10 min in the dark to allow the annexins to bind to the membranes. Samples were transferred into quartz cuvettes and irradiated at a distance of 5 cm for 20 min with a 366-nm UV lamp. 10 μl of 5× Laemmli loading buffer were added to the reaction mixtures, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 15% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and placed on hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) for 72 h at –80 °C with intensifying screens. Quantification was performed by scaning of autoradiograms and density analysis with ScnImage software taking as 100% the signal observed for each annexin (2 or 5) at pH 4.5 in the absence of Ca2+. For mass spectrometry, the AnxA2-labeled samples were lipid-extracted. Briefly, 150 μl of methanol and 50 μl of chloroform were added to the 50-μl samples and then mixed. Then 150 μl of water were added, and the samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 7 min. The water/methanol phase containing salts was discarded. 150 μl of methanol were added to the chloroform/lipid and protein-containing interphase. After vortexing and centrifugation as described above, the lipid containing supernatant was discarded; the proteic pellet was washed with methanol/chloroform (3:1 v/v), centrifuged, dried, and conserved at –20 °C until use. Liposomes (15 μg) were mixed with 15 μg of AnxA2 or (AnxA2-P11)2 in a buffer adjusted at the desired pH using a mixture of buffers and were controlled with a pH meter. The final concentration of the suspension was 1 mg/ml. The reaction was stopped after 15 min of incubation. For the reversibility experiments, liposomes and (AnxA2-P11)2 were first mixed in buffer C and then dialyzed against buffer A for 1 h at room temperature. The annexin/liposome suspensions were vitrified by plunging in liquid ethane, following standard fast-freeze procedures (33Dubochet J. Adrian M. Chang J.J. Homo J.C. Lepault J. McDowall A.W. Schultz P. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1988; 21: 129-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar). The grids were mounted in a Gatan-626 cryoholder, and cryo-TEM observations were performed at –170 °C on a Philips CM120 electron microscope operating at 120 kV. Micrographs were recorded at a magnification of ×45,000 under low dose conditions. Reduction-Alkylation—Each annexin sample (∼3 μg) was dissolved in 5 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3 buffer, pH 8. The reduction step was performed with dithiothreitol. 10 mm dithiothreitol was added in 300 m excess and incubated at 57 °C for 1 h. The alkylation step was performed with 350 m excess of 55 mm iodoacetamide. The reaction was left to proceed at room temperature in the dark for 45 min. Tryptic Digestion—Aliquots were subjected to trypsin digestion by overnight incubation at room temperature in 50 mm NH4HCO3 buffer, pH 8, using an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1/30 (w/w). Aliquots of 5 μl were deposited on an MALDI probe for mass spectrometry analysis. Mass Spectrometry—The study was carried out on the Autoflex® MALDI-TOF MS (Bruker Daltonics®, Bremen, Germany). Ionization was accomplished with the 337-nm beam from a nitrogen laser with a repetition rate of 5 Hz. Tryptic digests were deposited on a MALDI probe with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in acetone as matrix. A camera allowed visualization of the sample crystallization homogeneity before measurements. Spectra were obtained in the reflector and linear positive modes. Internal calibration was performed with trypsin autolysis peptides at monoisotopic m/z 842.50 and 2211.10. 70 μg of AnxA2 or (AnxA2-P11)2 were subjected to exclusion chromatography in a Superose 12 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated at the desired pH at 50 ml h–1 flow and 2 MPa pressure. Stokes radii measurements were performed with the Superose 12 column as described by Gerke and Weber (1Gerke V. Weber K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1688-1695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity and anisotropy decays were obtained by the time-correlated single photon counting technique from the polarized components Ivv(t) and Ivh(t) on the experimental set-up installed on the SB1 window of the synchrotron radiation machine Super-ACO (Anneau de Collision d'Orsay) (34Vincent M. Gallay J. Demchenko A.D. J. Phys. Chem. 1995; 99: 14931-14941Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Time resolution was ∼10 or 20 ps, and the data were stored in 2048 channels. Automatic sampling cycles including 30 s of accumulation time for the instrument response function and 90 s of acquisition time for each polarized component were carried out such that a total number of 2–4 × 106 counts was reached in the fluorescence intensity decay. Analyses of fluorescence intensity and anisotropy decays as sums of exponentials were performed by the maximum entropy method (MEM) (35Brochon J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 262-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 36Vincent M. Brochon J.C. Merola F. Jordi W. Gallay J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8752-8761Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 37Vincent M. Gallay J. Eur. Biophys. J. 1991; 20: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Aggregation and binding curves were obtained by fitting the experimental data to the equation y = a + ((b – a)/1 + 10(logk–x)n), in which a is the minimal y; b is the maximal y; k is a constant; and n a constant representing the Hill number. The statistical analysis and curves fitting were performed with Graphpad Prism software. pH-dependent Binding of AnxA2 and (AnxA2-P11)2 to Liposomes—Preliminary to the study of annexin 2 binding to liposomes at acidic pH, it was verified that AnxA2 and (AnxA2-P11)2 remained soluble at the pH used for these experiments (from pH 7 to 4). The dissociation of (AnxA2-P11)2 was also evaluated. For this purpose, (AnxA2-P11)2 was subjected to exclusion chromatography at different pH values. These experiments demonstrated that the tetramer is 100% stable at pH from 7.4 to 6.5. At pH 6, P11 started to dissociate, and 60% of the protein remained in a tetrameric form. However, aggregation and binding experiments showed that, at pH 6, a condition in which the monomeric form is not bound to liposomes, the aggregation and binding of the tetrameric annexin 2 was in the range of 60–90% (see below). We concluded that at pH 6, 60–90% of the protein remained in the tetrameric form. Because the small fraction of monomeric AnxA2 at pH6 is inactive (not bound), we were able to work properly with the tetramer in the pH 7–6 range. The binding of AnxA2 and (AnxA2-P11)2 to PC/PS unilamellar liposomes was monitored at different pH values. Liposome binding of annexin 2 increased with the H+ concentration (Fig. 1A). The binding of (AnxA2-P11)2 was detected at pH just below neutrality and showed 50% of bound protein at pH 6.3. The binding of AnxA2 started at a higher H+ concentration (pH lower than 6) and exhibited a half-maximal value at pH 5.7. It is worth noting that the binding efficiency of AnxA2 was more than 90% at pH 5. The binding of P11 dimer to PC/PS liposomes was also studied (Fig. 1A). Unexpectedly, P11 bound to liposomes at acidic pH. Although the slopes of binding for (AnxA2-P11)2 and P11 (Hill number –1.24 and –0.59, respectively) were different, as well as the pH range of binding (pH 7–6 and pH 6–4, respectively), it remained unclear whether the small fraction of membrane-bound P11 observed at pH 6 interferes with the binding to membranes of (AnxA2-P11)2 and, if so, to what extent. Because EGTA is a poor chelating reagent at acidic pH, the involvement of Ca2+ at acidic pH was investigated in the presence of BAPTA (10 mm), a chelating agent with higher affinity for Ca2+. Fig. 1B shows that at pH 4.5 in the presence of BAPTA half of the protein is associated to membranes. If BAPTA is a good chelator of Ca2+ at this pH, then the membrane-bound protein does not result from Ca2+-mediated binding. If BAPTA is not an efficient chelator and if Ca2+ is involved in binding, then the addition of 1 mm Ca2+ must increase binding. Fig. 1B shows that this is not the case; moreover, in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ and in the absence of BAPTA the fraction of protein associated to membranes is practically identical. These experiments show that Ca2+ is not involved in the acidically mediated membrane binding of AnxA2. Requirement of Negatively Charged Phospholipids for the Binding of AnxA2 to Liposomes at Acidic pH—AnxA2 was added to PC and to PC/PS liposomes at pH 4.7 (Fig. 1C). After centrifugation, no protein was detected in the pellets from pure PC liposomes, indicating that AnxA2 was not able to bind to PC liposomes at acidic pH. The binding of AnxA2 to liposomes required the presence of PS. AnxA2 was also able to associate with liposomes containing other negatively charged lipids including phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidic acid (data not shown). Influence of the Ionic Strength on Binding and Release of AnxA2 at Acidic pH—The effect of ionic strength on the pH-induced binding of AnxA2 was investigated. AnxA2 binding at pH 5.2 and 4.5 was studied in the presence of increasing KCl concentrations. The binding of AnxA2 to PC/PS liposomes was inhibited by KCl (Fig. 1D). At both pH values, the decrease in binding started at 40 mm KCl with a 50% inhibition obtained at 45 mm and 90 mm KCl for pH 5.2 and pH 4.5, respectively. Thus, ionic force reduced the binding of AnxA2 to negatively charged phospholipids, and this inhibition was less efficient at high H+ concentration. Because ionic strength hindered the binding of AnxA2, we studied whether AnxA2 previously bound to liposomes could be released by an increase in ionic strength. AnxA2 was first incubated with liposomes at pH 5.2 in the presence of 30 mm KCl, and then the annexin-liposome complexes were incubated with either 100 or 200 mm KCl. Under both conditions, the protein was dissociated from membranes (70% solubilization, Fig. 1E). These results are consistent with an electrostatic nature of the pH-mediated binding. pH-dependent Membrane Aggregation Mediated by AnxA2 and (AnxA2-P11)2—Membrane aggregation properties of AnxA2 and (AnxA2-P11)2 were also investigated at acidic pH in the absence of Ca2+. Both forms induced PC/PS liposome aggregation, although the extent of aggregation depended on the nature of the annexin form and occurred at different pH values (Fig. 2). (AnxA2-P11)2 aggregation started at a pH lower than 6.5 and reached a value of 60% at pH 6. In the case of AnxA2, the aggregation was observed at a lower pH (below pH 5.5) with a half-maximal value at pH 4.7. The pH-mediated aggregation properties of (AnxA2-P11)2 were also studied on biological membranes. (AnxA2-P11)2 started to aggregate chromaffin granules below pH 7 and attained 90% aggregation at pH 6 with an apparent half-maximal aggregation at pH 6.3, exhibiting more efficient aggregation than with liposomes. Chromaffin granules started to precipitate at pH 5 precluding the study of aggregation by AnxA2. Because (AnxA2-P11)2-mediated chromaffin granules aggregation showed higher H+ sensitivity than the PC/PS liposomes, we examined the possibility that the lipid composition was involved in this change on H+ sensitivity. Because the presence of cholesterol in PC/PS liposomes has an influence in the Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent binding and aggregation of annexins (19Ayala-Sanmartin J. Henry J. Pradel L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1510: 18-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23Ayala-Sanmartin J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we characterized the membrane aggregation of annexin 2 with PC/PS/cholesterol (50:25:25) liposomes. As shown in Fig. 2, the H+ sensitivity of aggregation of cholesterol-containing liposomes was increased for both forms of annexin 2. The half-maximal aggregation value for AnxA2 was shifted from 4.7 in PC/PS liposomes to 5.6 in PC/PS/cholesterol liposomes. With the tetramer, the H+ sensitivity was also shifted with 80% of aggregation at pH 6. These experiments suggest that, similarly to the Ca2+-mediated properties, the lipid composition and/or the formation of membrane microdomains is important for the H+-mediated binding and aggregation. The interactions of annexin 2 with membranes at acidic pH in the absence of Ca2+ were investigated in more detail. Observation by Cryo-TEM of Liposomes Aggregated by AnxA2 at Acidic pH—Liposome aggregates induced by annexin 2 at acidic pH were subjected to cryo-TEM observation. Within these aggregates, a peculiar organization of electron dense material was visible between the lipid bilayers of two juxtaposed liposomes exhibiting a so-called junction. This dense material was arranged into either one or two layers between the membranes (Fig. 3). Each lipid bilayer was resolved into two dark stripes corresponding to the lipid polar head groups. When one extra layer was present, the junction exhibited five dark stripes with an overall thickness of about 135 Å, which were interpreted as, successively, two lipid leaflets of the first membrane, one layer of AnxA2 molecules, and two leaflets of the second lipid membrane (Fig. 3, A–C). When two protein layers were present, the junction exhibited six dark stripes with an overall thickness of about 165 Å proposed to contain, successively, two leaflets of one lipid membrane, two layers of AnxA2 molecules, and two lipid leaflets of the other membrane (Fig. 3, D–F). Although liposome aggregation was mediated through a straight contact between two liposomes, it is important to note that another type of contact was frequently observed. One liposome could be partially or totally encapsulated into a larger liposome revealing invaginated assemblies (Fig. 3, G and H) and multilamellar structures (not shown). The contact between these two liposomes appeared as curvilinear junctions made of two lipid bilayers and one or two layers of AnxA2 molecules. The features of these curved junctions"

Transcriptional activation for a number of these genes has been shown to occur via direct interaction of MarA with a 20-bp degenerate asymmetric “marbox” sequence. It was not known whether repression by MarA was also direct. We found that purified MarA was sufficient in vitro to repress transcription of both purA and hdeA. Transcription and electrophoretic mobility shift experiments in vitro using mutant promoters suggested that the marbox involved in the repression overlapped the -35 promoter motif and was in the “backward” orientation. This organization contrasts with that of the class II promoters activated by MarA, in which the marbox also overlaps the -35 motif but is in the “forward” orientation. We conclude that MarA, a member of the AraC/XylS family, can act directly as a repressor or an activator, depending on the position and orientation of the marbox within a promoter.

The Escherichia coli MarA protein, a member of the AraC/XylS family of transcriptional regulators, mediates cellular responses to stress through the differential control of a large number of chromosomal genes comprising the mar regulon (1Alekshun M.N.

Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 2067-2075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MarA homologs SoxS and Rob in E. coli are also stress-response proteins (2Gallegos M.-T. Schleif R. Bairoch A. Hofmann K. Ramos J.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation of those mar regulon members that have been studied occurs when MarA binds as a monomer to the promoter region at a degenerate asymmetric 20-bp DNA sequence known as the “marbox” (6Martin R.G.

The mechanisms by which MarA activates members of the mar regulon and the details of MarA, SoxS, and Rob interactions with the marbox DNA have been investigated (for example see Refs. 6Martin R.G.

Gronenborn A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 113-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). MarA was originally described as an activator. Its expression directly induced transcription of all previously studied mar regulon members except ompF, whose down-regulation resulted indirectly from MarA activation of the antisense RNA micF, which then inhibited the translation of ompF (12Cohen S.P. McMurry L.M. Levy S.B. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5416-5422Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 13Delihas N. Forst S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Repression by MarA has been shown recently in vivo for several dozen genes by two independent macroarray studies, although the gene overlap between the two studies was not large (4Barbosa T.M. Levy S.B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3467-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 5Pomposiello P.J. Bennik M.H. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3890-3902Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). To determine whether the repression by MarA was direct or occurred by an indirect action, we focused on two genes, purA and hdeA. In the intact cell, transcription of purA was decreased in cells constitutively producing MarA (4Barbosa T.M. Levy S.B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3467-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Expression of hdeA was repressed by induced expression of MarA (see Ref. 5Pomposiello P.J. Bennik M.H. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3890-3902Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, Supplemental Material). purA codes for adenylosuccinate synthase, which plays an important role in the de novo pathway of purine nucleotide biosynthesis and is required for adenosine monophosphate synthesis from inosine -5′-monophosphate (14Wolfe S.A. Smith J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19147-19153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An association between purA and virulence has also been proposed (15Dunstan S.J. Simmons C.P. Strugnell R.A. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 732-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hoffman J.A. Badger J.L. Zhang Y. Kim K.S. Microb. Pathog. 2001; 31: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). hdeA encodes a periplasmic protein involved in acid resistance (17Gajiwala K.S. Burley S.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 18Waterman S.R. Small P.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 925-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In Shigella flexneri and E. coli, both acidresistant organisms, hdeA is present, but it is absent in Salmonella, which is merely acid-tolerant (17Gajiwala K.S. Burley S.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We show here that MarA directly represses both purA and hdeA. Thus MarA is a dual regulator capable of both activation and repression, depending upon the promoter.

Restriction enzyme digestions followed standard procedures (19Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 1.84-1.87Google Scholar). PCR amplification utilized either Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) or TripleMaster Polymerase Mix (proofreading) (Eppendorf) in a GeneAmp® PCR System 9700 thermocycler (PE Applied Biosystems, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Oligonucleotide synthesis and DNA sequencing were performed by the Tufts University Core Facility. RNA Preparation and Northern Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from cells using the Qiagen RNeasy kit. Two micrograms of RNA were fractionated by electrophoresis in a denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel, which was then blotted onto a Hybond-N (Amersham Biosciences) membrane. RNA was visualized by both ethidium bromide staining of the gel and by methylene blue staining of the membrane. purA or hdeA probes were amplified by PCR using AG100 chromosomal DNA as template. For purA,an ∼1270-bp region was amplified using the primer pair F2:P-Rev (GAAAACGATTGGCTGAAC:AAGGTGGATTCAGACCAG). For hdeA,an ∼396-bp region was amplified using the primer pair HdeA1:HdeA2 (TTGATTCGTGACGGCTCT:ATGCAAGGAAGTACGATGT). Hybridization of membrane-bound RNA to the purA or hdeA probes was performed as described previously (4Barbosa T.M. Levy S.B. J.

The wild type 225-bp purA promoter-containing template was amplified using primer pair purApF:purApR (GGAAAACGATTGGCTGAAC:CGTTCAGTCAGAAGATCG). PCR products containing mutated purA marboxes were made using reverse primer purApR together with a mutated forward primer. The 5′ end of a mutated forward primer corresponded to the 5′ end of the PCR product shown in Fig. 5; its arbitrary 3′ terminus was either… AACTCTG-3′ (for D2F and D3F) or… GAAAAGC-3′ (for all others). All purA templates yielded a transcript of 105 nt. For hdeA, a 193-bp PCR product of the promoter region was amplified using the primer pair HdeA1a:HdeA2a (TCTGATGCATCTGTAACTCA:GAAGCAGACCACCAAGAATA). Mutant PCR products were made with the reverse primer HdeA2a together with primers beginning at the 5′ end shown in Fig. 6. All hdeA transcripts were 94 nt long. The 167-bp gnd promoter-containing PCR product used the primers GNDF:GNDR (TCGCAACTTTGATCGAAT:TACATACTCCTGTCAGGT); the transcript was 55 nt long.

(21Jair K.-W. Martin R.G. Rosner J.L. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Wolf Jr., R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 7100-7104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was a generous gift of Victoria Bartlett and Michael Alekshun (Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Boston). Single round (5 min) transcription in vitro was carried out essentially as described (22Jair K.-W. Fawcett W.P. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Wolf R.E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) in 30 μl using PCR products as DNA templates. The Reaction Buffer at pH 7.8 contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 3 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm sodium chloride, and 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Other components of the pre-incubation mixture are as follows: E. coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme (σ70; Epicentre), 40 nm; the RNase inhibitor SUPERase In™ (Ambion), 500 units/ml; test DNA (purA, hdeA, or nfnB promoter-containing DNAs); and control DNA (gnd promoter-containing DNA) each at 2 nm. In most experiments involving mutant templates with lower transcription levels, the concentration of each test DNA was raised to 4 or 6 nm. Purified His6-MarA, diluted as needed in Reaction Buffer, was added to the pre-incubation mixture on ice to give 200 nm; the buffer in which His6-MarA was prepared was similarly diluted and added to the control. Open complexes were allowed to form at 37 °C for 15 min, when a heparin/nucleotide mixture was added to initiate transcription; the final concentrations were heparin, 1.2 mg/ml, and nucleotides, 0.3 mm UTP, 0.96 mm ATP, CTP, and GTP with [α-32P]UTP at 0.5 μCi/ml (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After 5 min, an equal volume of Ambion gel loading buffer II was added to stop the reaction; the samples were boiled for 3 min, chilled, and fractionated by electrophoresis on a 7% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel in Tris borate EDTA, pH 8.3. Quantification of Transcript Levels—Radioactivity was detected by exposure of membranes/dried gels to Kodak BioMax MS x-ray film; alternatively, exposure to a storage phosphor screen was followed by scanning with a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Film images for methylene blue-stained membranes showing ribosomal RNA were scanned into Adobe Photoshop, and the bands were quantified using NIH Image 1.62. Transcripts from both Northern blots and from transcription reactions in vitro were quantified after PhosphorImager scanning by ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences). The amounts of the two major transcripts produced, in vivo by hdeA or in vitro by purA, were combined. The amount of each test transcript was normalized by the level of the ribosomal RNA (for Northern blots) or gnd transcript (for in vitro transcriptions). Identification of Putative Marboxes—Putative marboxes were identified using the “search patterns” utility of Colibri (genolist.pasteur.fr/Colibri/) with the 20-bp degenerate consensus sequence A(CAT)RGCACRWWNNRYYAAA(CAT)N, where R indicates A or G; W indicates A or T; Y indicates T or C; and N indicates A, T, G, or C (7Martin R.G. Rosner J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1611-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Only marboxes between 150-bp upstream and 100-bp downstream of the transcriptional start that had 15 or more matches and the 5th C invariant were considered. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA) for purA—Binding of purified His6-MarA to DNA from the purA promoter region was measured by EMSA. The DNA used for fragments of 107–185-bp was amplified by PCR using a chromosomal AG100 template, whereas the 20–29-mers encompassing marboxes were made by annealing equimolar concentrations of complementary DNA oligomers. The forward oligomers for the 20-bp marboxes were marbox 1 (AGTGCAAAAAGTGCTGTAAC), marbox 2 (TTGAGTGCAAAAAGTGCTGT), and marbox 3 (AGGTCATTTTTGAGTGCAAA). The forward oligomer for the wild type 29-bp fragment comprising overlapping marboxes 1 and 2 was TTTTGAGTGCAAAAAGTGCTGTAACTCTG. Two mutant oligomers were designed such that all 4-bp of RE1 of either marbox 1 or marbox 2 were mutated; the mutations are shown in Fig. 5, MB1.1F and MB2.1F, respectively. In all cases, DNA was labeled at the 3′ end with digoxigenin-11-ddUTP (DIG gel shift kit, Roche Applied Science), and the EMSA reactions were performed as described previously (20Barbosa T.M. Levy S.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Transient Induction of MarA Caused a Decrease of purA and hdeA Expression in Cells—The earlier E. coli DNA macroarray experiments showing that constitutively produced MarA reduced expression of purA (4Barbosa T.M. Levy S.B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3467-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) were confirmed subsequently using Northern assays (data not shown). To determine whether this repression was a result of MarA function, as opposed to a stress-related artifact associated with the constitutive overproduction of MarA, we controlled expression of marA with the IPTG-inducible lac promoter in plasmid pMB102 (5Pomposiello P.J. Bennik M.H. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3890-3902Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) in the mar-deleted strain JHC1096 (Table I). In the same experiment we also examined the expression of hdeA, which had been observed in another macroarray study to be repressed upon MarA induction in cells (5Pomposiello P.J. Bennik M.H. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3890-3902Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). After a 1-h induction of MarA by IPTG, a decline was seen in the levels of transcripts of purA (Fig. 1A) and hdeA (Fig. 1B). Typically, the decrease at 1 mm IPTG was ∼3-fold for purA and 6–25-fold for hdeA, with less IPTG required for hdeA. Each of the two bands in Fig. 1B probably includes both genes of the hdeAB operon (23Arnqvist A. Olsen A. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 35Tucker D.L. Tucker N. Ma Z. Foster J.W. Miranda R.L. Cohen P.S. Conway T. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3190-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar); therefore, hdeB was probably also repressed. No decrease was seen in cells bearing the vector control (pJPBH) (Fig. 1, A and B). These results show that the decrease in purA and hdeA expression was caused, directly or indirectly, by transiently synthesized MarA rather than by a stress reaction due to constitutively overabundant MarA. Purified MarA Repressed Transcription of purA and hdeA in Vitro—To determine whether repression was direct or indirect, we tested the effect of purified His6-MarA protein on transcription of purA and hdeA in vitro. This protein, engineered to facilitate purification and hereafter referred to as MarA, had been shown previously to activate nfnB transcription in vitro (20Barbosa T.M. Levy S.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The DNA templates for the single round transcription reactions were PCR products bearing a promoter, its transcriptional start, and 55–105 bp downstream. The transcriptional start sites of the purA gene (14Wolfe S.A. Smith J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19147-19153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the hdeAB operon (23Arnqvist A. Olsen A. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) have been defined. We mixed the promoter-containing DNA of purA or hdeA with that of the control gnd (a promoter that is unresponsive to MarA) (21Jair K.-W. Martin R.G. Rosner J.L. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Wolf Jr., R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 7100-7104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Jair K.-W. Fawcett W.P. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Wolf R.E.J. Mol.

Skarstad K. Thony B. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Wolf Jr., R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2507-2513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The promoter for the MarA-activated gene nfnB (20Barbosa T.M. Levy S.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), also mixed with gnd DNA, was tested in parallel as a positive control for MarA activity. In the presence of 200 nm MarA, there was a 5–6-fold activation in nfnB transcription, as expected (Fig. 2). As anticipated, MarA did not affect the expression from the control gnd promoter. The same concentration and batch of MarA protein, on the other hand, repressed both purA and hdeA (Fig. 2). The average repression ratio was 0.44 for purA (see Fig. 5, WT) and 0.60 for hdeA (see Fig. 6, WT) relative to controls without MarA. These results showed that MarA by itself could directly repress purA and hdeA transcription. DNA Sequences Involved in Binding by MarA, EMSA—Activation of transcription by MarA involves binding of this protein as a monomer to a degenerate 20-bp “marbox” located upstream from or overlapping the -35 motif within the promoter (6Martin R.G. Gillette W.K. Rhee S. Rosner J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 10Rhee S. Martin R.G. Rosner J.L. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10413-10418Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). It seemed likely that for repression, a marbox in the promoter region would also be involved, although perhaps with a different location or orientation. The purA promoter region contained five consensus marboxes (see “Experimental Procedures” for criteria); all were upstream of the translational start site. By EMSA using PCR products covering various regions of the purA promoter, we showed that MarA bound with similar affinity to fragments spanning bp -140 to +45, -121 to -14, and -96 to +45, relative to the transcriptional start (data not shown). Therefore, binding occurred between bp -96 and -14, eliminating three of the marboxes from consideration. The remaining were marbox 1 (forward, bp -49 to -30, 15/20 consensus bp) and the overlapping marbox 2 (backward, bp -33 to -52, 15/20 consensus bp) (see Fig. 5). Further mobility shift assays with 20-bp DNA fragments comprising the individual marboxes showed that MarA did not bind to a “control” poor consensus backward “marbox 3” (bp -42 to -61; only 12/20 consensus bp) but did bind to marboxes 1 and 2. The affinity for marbox 2 (Kd < 100 nm) was greater than that for marbox 1 (Kd > 400 nm) (Fig. 3A), suggesting that marbox 2 was preferred. It was not straightforward to further distinguish the relative importance of marboxes 1 and 2 because they overlapped at 17 of their 20 bp (see Fig. 5). We therefore took advantage of the two highly conserved marbox “recognition elements,” RE1 and RE2, of 4 bp each which are particularly critical for activation by SoxS (27Griffith K.L. Wolf Jr., R.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1141-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and presumably by MarA. The crystal structure of MarA bound to marbox DNA shows the two recognition helices of the protein in contact with the recognition elements of the marbox (10Rhee S. Martin R.G. Rosner J.L. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10413-10418Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We mutated all 4 bp of RE1 of either marbox 1 or marbox 2 (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 5) in 29-bp duplexes containing both purA marboxes 1 and 2. The mutations in the RE1 of one marbox did not affect the RE1 of the other. We found that MarA still bound to mutated purA marbox 1 but did not bind to mutated marbox 2 (Fig. 3B). This result confirmed the importance of marbox 2. In the case of hdeA, there were six consensus marboxes (Fig. 4; see “Experimental Procedures” for criteria). However, EMSA experiments were not conclusive because a shift in mobility was seen for only a very small fraction of hdeA promoter DNA, even with MarA at 750 nm. DNA Sequences Involved in Repression by MarA, Transcription Assays in Vitro—For purA, the EMSA analyses had identified marbox 2 as more important for MarA binding but did not prove its involvement in MarA-mediated transcriptional repression. Therefore, we repeated the in vitro transcription reactions using promoters with mutations in marboxes 1 and 2 to look for loss of repression. Both deletions and point mutations were used. Some of these mutations caused a reduction in transcription itself (see “Discussion”), so a doubling or tripling in the amount of template DNA (including with wild type controls) was used to enhance the amount of transcript (see “Experimental Procedures”). For purA, changing 3 bp in RE2 of marbox 2 did not prevent repression (Fig. 5, MB2.2F) nor did deletions of 7 or 14 bp in marboxes 1 and 2 (Fig. 5, purD2F, purD3F, and DelF). Truncation of the final 6 bp of marbox 2 decreased but did not eliminate repression (Fig. 5, purApF2). The unexpected repression still seen despite marbox deletions and truncation is discussed below. Nevertheless, repression was clearly prevented by the alteration of all 4 bp of RE1 in marbox 2 (Fig. 5, MB2.1F), whereas no effect was seen for mutations in RE1 of marbox 1 (Fig. 5, MB1.1F and mut1F). These latter results again pointed to marbox 2, and not marbox 1, as critical for repression of purA. For hdeA, a template missing marbox 1, the last 13 bp of marbox 6 and the last 6 bp of marbox 5 still showed repression (Fig. 6, MB5.5), as did a template missing all of marbox 5 (and consequently the last 2 bp of marbox 3) (Fig. 6, ΔMB5). Therefore, it appeared that marboxes 1, 5, and 6 were not needed for repression. Not surprisingly, mutations of the last 2 bp of marbox 3 did not block repression (Fig. 6, MB3a). However, alteration of all 4 bp of RE2 of marbox 3 did block repression (Fig. 6, MB3b). Therefore, marbox 3 was necessary for repression of hdeA. To investigate the role of RE1 of marbox 3, two of its 4 bp (within the -35 hexamer) were changed, but this reduced basal levels of transcription such that quantification was not possible. When the -35 hexamer (atgaca) was mutated to the consensus hexamer (ttgaca), transcription increased notably; repression by MarA still occurred (Fig. 6, MB3e), even though the mutation also affected 1 bp of RE1 of marbox 3. When this single mutation in the -35 hexamer was then combined with the RE2 mutations of MB3b, transcription remained high, and repression was again lost (Fig. 6, MB3k). These results together indicated that marbox 3, and particularly its RE2, was critical for repression of hdeA by MarA. No further mutations were attempted in RE1 as it completely overlapped the -35 hexamer. By using transcription analysis in vitro, we have demonstrated that purified MarA protein was sufficient to down-regulate expression of purA and hdeA via the promoter region of these genes. How the same protein is able both to activate and to repress transcription probably relates to the identity and location of DNA sequence motifs that are recognized by MarA. For our studies here, we presumed that marboxes within the promoter region would be involved. By a combination of EMSA and transcription experiments in vitro using wild type and mutant marboxes, we found that the marbox most likely to contribute to repression of both purA and hdeA overlapped the -35 promoter motif and was oriented in the “backward” direction. “Class II” promoters activated by MarA also have marboxes overlapping the -35 motif, but these marboxes are in the forward direction (6Martin R.G. Gillette W.K. Rhee S. Rosner J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Presumably the two different marbox orientations result in two types of interactions between MarA, RNA polymerase, and/or DNA, one leading to activation and the other to repression. In the case of purA, marbox 2 was defined as critical by its affinity for MarA in EMSA and by the fact that point mutations in RE1 of marbox 2 prevented both the mobility shift and the repression by MarA in vitro. Although deletions within this marbox did not prevent repression, this result could readily be explained (for the 7-bp deletions) by the formation of new backward marboxes from the resultant joined sequences, with consensus bp of 15/20 (D2F) or 16/20 (D3F) (see Fig. 5). In the case of the 14-bp deletion (DelF), the newly created marbox was 1 bp too short, but it had 14 consensus bp. However, mutant template purApF2, lacking the terminal 6 bp of the marbox, was still somewhat repressed (Fig. 5). That finding suggested that only the first part of this marbox was needed for repression. Transcription using the templates with deletions was considerably reduced, possibly due to destruction of a potential “UP element” (28Estrem S.T. Gaal T. Ross W. Gourse R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9761-9766Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) comprising bp -41 to -57 in the purA promoter. For hdeA, even though repression of transcription was seen in vitro, EMSA experiments showed minimal binding of MarA to the hdeA promoter region. Discrepancies between DNA binding as measured by EMSA and by other means have also been observed for other promoters, for example ybjC (29Martin R.G. Gillette W.K. Martin N.I. Rosner J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 355-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and inaA (6Martin R.G. Gillette W.K. Rhee S. Rosner J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We therefore depended upon the transcription assays in vitro to define the particular marbox critical for repression of hdeA. Specifically, upstream marboxes 1, 5, and 6 were not required. Marbox 3, overlapping the -35 promoter motif, was critical for repression, because there was no repression if mutations were placed in all 4 bp of its RE2 (Fig. 6). The role of RE1 of marbox 3 remained unclear because RE1 completely overlapped the -35 hexamer and could not be extensively mutagenized. The last 2 bp of marbox 3 could be deleted without eliminating repression in vitro (ΔMB5), suggesting that, as with purA, an entire 20-bp marbox may not be needed for repression (Fig. 6). Of note, RE2 was important for repression of hdeA but not purA. Two relatives of MarA were reported to directly repress transcription of other promoters, but the marbox involved was not determined. IscR, a newly recognized member of the AraC family of transcriptional regulators and a “distant” MarA relative (20% identity, 40% amino acid similarity), was able to function in vitro as a transcriptional repressor of the iscRSUA operon (30Schwartz C.J. Giel J.L. Patschkowski T. Luther C. Ruzicka F.J. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14895-14900Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, we had observed down-regulation of the same promoter by constitutive expression of MarA (4Barbosa T.M. Levy S.B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3467-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) (iscS = b2530). Also, the MarA homolog SoxS repressed its own expression in whole cells and bound its own promoter in vitro (31Nunoshiba T. Hidalgo E. Li Z. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7492-7494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); no further studies of this observation have been reported. The physiological significance of the repression of purA and hdeA by MarA is not known. Other proteins also repress purA and hdeA. The purA promoter is repressed by PurR in the presence of purines (32He B. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1009-1013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the promoter of hdeA is repressed by HN-S (33Hommais F. Krin E. Laurent-Winter C. Soutourina O. Malpertuy A. Le Caer J.P. Danchin A. Bertin P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 20-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The hdeA promoter can be recognized by both σ70 and RpoS (23Arnqvist A. Olsen A. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and MarA can activate both σ70- and RpoS-dependent promoters (34Van Dyk T.K. Ayers B.L. Morgan R.W. Larossa R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 785-792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, GadX binds to a region in the hdeA promoter (35Tucker D.L. Tucker N. Ma Z. Foster J.W. Miranda R.L. Cohen P.S. Conway T. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3190-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) which overlaps the MarA-binding site, marbox 3. The repression of purA by MarA was quantitatively similar in vivo and in vitro, whereas that of hdeA was greater in vivo (∼6–25-fold) than in vitro (∼1.7-fold). Possibly repression in vivo of hdeA by MarA is aided by a cellular product that is constitutive or is induced by MarA. From our results we postulate that MarA represses by binding to a region of the promoter that overlaps the RNA polymerase -35 binding motif. Certain other repressors also have binding sites that overlap or lie between the RNA polymerase-binding motifs; they may provide models for MarA action (36Choy H. Adhya S. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1287-1299Google Scholar, 37Gralla J.D. Collado-Vides J. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1232-1245Google Scholar). LexA sterically blocks the binding of RNA polymerase to the uvrA promoter (38Bertrand-Burggraf E. Hurstel S. Daune M. Schnarr M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). MerR bends the -10 motif of the merT promoter away from RNA polymerase, causing a reduction in the rate of open complex formation (39Ansari A.Z. Bradner J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Nature. 1995; 374: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 40Caslake L.F. Ashraf S.I. Summers A.O. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1787-1795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Arc protein at the Pant promoter of bacteriophage P22 slows the rate of open complex formation (41Smith T.L. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8868-8872Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although our sample of genes directly repressed by MarA is small, the location and orientation of the marboxes in the two repressed genes studied here are unlike that in either of the two classes of the MarA-activated genes. We have postulated that it is the backward marbox overlapping the -35 motif that uniquely gives rise to repression. Other cases in which proteins activate some promoters and repress others have been described (37Gralla J.D. Collado-Vides J. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1232-1245Google Scholar). However, we have found no previous example in which the change between activation and repression relies on the orientation of the binding site. We thank Michael N. Alekshun and Mark Silby for helpful comments. We are also grateful to Victoria Bartlett and Michael N. Alekshun for providing the purified MarA protein, Bruce Demple (Harvard School of Public Health) for plasmid pMB102, and Xiaowen Bina for pJPBH."

We previously employed site-directed mutagenesis to locate candidate catalytic residues of S. pombe Fcp1 (16Hausmann S. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21213-21220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 18Hausmann S. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13627-13632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We found that alanine substitutions for Asp170, Asp172, Arg223, Asp258, Lys280, Asp297, and Asp298 abolished phosphatase activity with either p-nitrophenyl phosphate or CTD-PO4 as substrates. Structure-activity relationships were subsequently determined by introducing conservative substitutions at each essential position. Because the seven essential amino acids identified in S. pombe Fcp1 are conserved in Fcp1 orthologs from other organisms, we predicted that they comprise the phosphatase active site. A goal of the present study was to more fully delineate the phosphatase active site and the catalytic mechanism of Fcp1. Therefore, we conducted additional mutational analysis of the FCPH domain, guided by sequence comparisons to diverse Fcp1 homologs (Fig. 1). We report the effects of 17 mutations at 11 conserved positions of S. pombe Fcp1, which identify four new residues (Thr174, Tyr237, Thr243, and Tyr249) as important for activity with both specific and nonspecific substrates. Based on the crystal structures available for related DXDX(T/V) phosphatases, we discuss plausible catalytic roles for the essential side chains of Fcp1. Although the mutational studies illuminate the chemical mechanism of Fcp1, they do not instruct us on the basis for specific recognition of the phosphorylated CTD. Previously, we showed that S. pombe Fcp1 displays an inherent preference for a particular CTD phosphorylation array. Using equivalent 28-aa CTD peptides of identical amino acid sequence and phosphoserine content, which differed only in the positions of phosphoserine within the tetraheptad sequence, we found that Fcp1 was 10-fold more active in dephosphorylating Ser2-PO4 than Ser5-PO4 (16Hausmann S. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21213-21220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Here we systematically investigated the structural features of the CTD Ser2-PO4 substrate that promote optimal phosphatase activity. Our results show that: (i) Fcp1 acts distributively during the hydrolysis of substrates containing tandem Ser2-PO4 heptads; (ii) Fcp1 fails to hydrolyze the N-terminal Ser2-PO4-containing heptad when the substrate is phased as (Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7)n; (iii) the minimal optimal CTD substrate for Fcp1 is a single heptad of phasing S5P6S7Y1S2P3T4; and (iv) single alanine mutations of flanking residues Tyr1 or Pro3 result in 6-fold decrements in CTD phosphatase activity. Fcp1 Mutants—Amino acid substitution mutations (and diagnostic restriction sites) were introduced into the fcp1+ cDNA by the two-stage overlap extension method as described previously (16Hausmann S. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21213-21220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). pET-Fcp1 was used as the template for the first-stage amplification. The mutated full-length cDNAs generated in the second-stage amplification were digested with NcoI and BamHI and then inserted into pET16m. The inserts of the resulting pET-Fcp1* plasmids were sequenced completely to confirm the desired mutations and exclude the acquisition of unwanted changes during amplification or cloning. The pET-Fcp1* and pET-Fcp1 plasmids were introduced into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-RIL, and the mutant Fcp1 proteins were purified from soluble bacterial lysates by nickel-agarose affinity chromatography as described previously for wild-type Fcp1 (16Hausmann S.

Protein concentrations were determined by using the Bio-Rad dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard. CTD Phosphopeptides—The following CTD Ser2-PO4 peptides containing an unmodified N-terminal amine and a C-terminal acid were synthesized and purified by the Sloan-Kettering Microchemistry Core Laboratory as described in Ref. 29Ho C.K.

Additional CTD Ser2-PO4 peptides containing an N-terminal amine and a C-terminal amide were as follows: 9-mer SPSYSPTSP; 8-mer SPSYSPTS; 7-mer SPSYSPT. The peptides were dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA and stored at 4 °C. The molar concentrations of the phosphopeptides were initially estimated from the absorbance at 274 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.4 × 103m–1 for tyrosine. The content of Ser2-PO4 was then determined for each peptide by measuring the release of inorganic phosphate after digestion with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP; purchased from Roche Applied Science) as follows: CIP reaction mixtures (25 μl) containing ∼2.5 nmol of CTD phosphopeptide and CIP (2 units) were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched by adding 0.5 ml of malachite green reagent (BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Release of phosphate was determined by measuring A620 and interpolating the value to a phosphate standard curve. The phosphopeptide concentrations measured by CIP were in good agreement (±10%) with the concentrations calculated from the UV absorbance. The amounts of input CTD Ser2-PO4 substrate specified in the Fcp1 reactions are based on the concentrations determined by CIP digestion. Phosphatase Assay—Reaction mixtures (100 μl) containing 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 5.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNØP), and Fcp1 as specified were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched by adding 900 μl of 1 m sodium carbonate. Release of p-nitrophenol (pNØ) was determined by measuring A410 and interpolating the value to a pNØ standard curve. CTD Phosphatase Assay—Reaction mixtures (25 μl) containing 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 5.5), 10 mm MgCl2, CTD phosphopeptide, and Fcp1 were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched by adding 0.5 ml of malachite green reagent. Release of phosphate was determined by measuring A620 and interpolating the value to a phosphate standard curve. Product Analysis by MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—Reaction mixtures (300 μl) containing 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 5.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 25 μm phosphopeptide (YSPTSPS)4 (= 100 μm Ser2-PO4) and 0.3 μm Fcp1 were incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots (25 μl) were withdrawn at the times specified, and the reaction was quenched by adding 10 μl of 5 m formic acid. Aliquots (1 μl) of the mixture were diluted 100-fold with 0.1% formic acid and loaded onto a 2-μl column of Poros 50 R2 reverse-phase chromatography beads (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) packed into an Eppendorf gel-loading tip. The adsorbed peptides were eluted with 8 μl of 30% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. An aliquot (0.5 μl) of the eluted peptide pool was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS), using a Bruker UltraFlex TOF/TOF instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany), as described previously (40Erdjument-Bromage H.

The spectra were obtained in the negative ion mode, by averaging multiple acquisitions. The distribution of tetra-, tri-, di-, and monophosphorylated CTD peptides in each sample (Fig. 3B) was calculated as the ratio of the observed peak heights of the individual tetra-, tri-, di-, or monophosphorylated peptides to the sum of the heights of the tetra-, tri-, di-, and monophosphorylated peptide peaks. S. pombe Fcp1 Preferentially Dephosphorylates Ser2 at Neutral pH—We reported previously that purified recombinant S. pombe Fcp1 dephosphorylates a 28-aa CTD phosphopeptide (YSPTSPS)4 consisting of four tandem repeats of the CTD heptad sequence in which all Ser2 positions are Ser-PO4 (16Hausmann S. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21213-21220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). S. pombe Fcp1 was 10-fold more active with this Ser2-PO4 CTD substrate than with a 28-aa CTD phosphopeptide (YSPTSPS)4 consisting of four heptads in which all Ser5 positions are Ser-PO4 (16Hausmann S. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21213-21220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These in vitro experiments, which provided the first biochemical evidence that any Fcp1 ortholog has intrinsic preference for a particular phosphorylation array, were performed at pH 5.5, which is the optimal pH for the catalytic activity of S. pombe Fcp1 with both nonspecific (pNØP) and specific (CTD-PO4) substrates (16Hausmann S. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21213-21220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Our biochemical data for Ser2-PO4 preference by S. pombe Fcp1 agree with genetic experiments showing that transient inactivation of S. cerevisiae Fcp1 in vivo results in a selective increase in the steady-state level of Ser2-PO4 in the large subunit of template-engaged RNA polymerase II (41Cho E.J. Kobor M.S. Kim M. Greenblatt J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3319-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Despite the concordance of these in vitro and in vivo studies, our biochemical evidence for Ser2-PO4 preference by S. pombe Fcp1 has been called into question in a recent review article because our experiments were performed at pH 5.5 (42Palancade B. Bensaude O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 3859-3870Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Although S. pombe maintains neutral intracellular pH (between pH 7.1 and 7.3 (43Karagiannis J. Young P.G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2929-2941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), it is sensible that S. pombe Fcp1, as a DXDX(T/V) phosphatase, would display optimal activity at mildly acidic pH in vitro, because the phosphoryl transfer mechanism calls for an unprotonated aspartate nucleophile and a protonated aspartate general acid catalyst. To explore this issue further, we evaluated the substrate specificity of purified S. pombe Fcp1 at pH 7.0 (Fig. 2). We see that Fcp1 preferentially dephosphorylates the Ser2-PO4 substrate at neutral pH. From the slopes of the titration curves, we calculated that the specific activity with the (YSPTSPS)4 substrate was 6-fold greater than the activity with the (YSPTSPS)4 substrate. These data vitiate the notion that pH 5.5 somehow provoked S. pombe Fcp1 to prefer Ser2-PO4. Fcp1 Is a Distributive Enzyme—The kinetics of dephosphorylation of the (YSPTSPS)4 substrate under conditions of substrate excess are shown in Fig. 3A. Approximately 14% of the input phosphoserine residues were hydrolyzed after 2 min; from this initial rate we calculated a turnover number of 0.39 s–1. Phosphate release increased with time and reached a plateau at 60 min, at which time about 70% of the input phosphoserine residues had been hydrolyzed. The end point value at 60 min was not increased when the concentration of Fcp1 was increased 3-fold (not shown), suggesting that either: (i) about one-fourth of the input substrate peptide was unreactive with Fcp1 or (ii) one of the Ser2-PO4 sites within the tetraheptad peptide was protected from Fcp1. To explore this issue, aliquots of the reaction mixture were withdrawn at serial times, quenched with acid, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, which fractionates the peptide pool based on molecular mass. This allowed us to gauge the distribution of products as the input tetraphosphorylated CTD substrate was converted to species of lower mass differing by multiples of 80-Da increments (signifying the loss of integral numbers of phosphate groups). The first instructive findings emerged from the product distribution at the 60-min reaction end point, showing that there was no residual tetraphosphorylated CTD substrate and that 87% of the product corresponded to singly phosphorylated CTD peptide (1×PO4) and 13% corresponded to doubly phosphorylated CTD (2×PO4) (Fig. 3B). These results confirmed that all of the input CTD substrate was reactive with Fcp1 and that the reaction ceased after three of the four phosphates were hydrolyzed. The structural basis for this restricted end point is explored in depth below. The evolution of the product distribution during the 60-min reaction (Fig. 3B) allowed a clear discrimination between processive and distributive modes of action by S. pombe Fcp1 on a multiply phosphorylated CTD array. In a purely processive mechanism under conditions of substrate excess, Fcp1 would sequentially hydrolyze all available Ser2-PO4 on the peptide to which it initially bound before dissociating to a new substrate peptide. In that event, we would expect to detect at all times a product distribution consisting of a mixture of the unreacted 4×PO4 substrate and the 1×PO4 CTD “end-product,” with a steady increase in the abundance of end-product as a function of time and little accumulation of CTD peptides with intermediate phosphorylation states. In contrast, in a purely distributive mechanism, Fcp1 would dissociate from the CTD peptide after hydrolysis of only one Ser2-PO4 position and then be available to rebind to other CTD peptides in the substrate pool. In a distributive mechanism, we would expect to see a serial flux of product through each of the dephosphorylated species, i.e. that the triphosphorylated CTD (3×PO4) predominates at the earliest times before it decays to a diphosphorylated CTD (2×PO4), which is converted in turn to the 1×PO4 CTD end-product. Indeed, the distributive pattern is exactly what we observed (Fig. 3B). At the earliest time analyzed (2 min), virtually all of the input substrate had been consumed and converted primarily to 3×PO4 CTD (78%) and to a lesser extent to 2×PO4 CTD (22%). The 3×PO4 species declined steadily in abundance over 20 min. The 2×PO4 CTD accumulated steadily between 2 and 10 min, plateaued at 10–20 min (comprising 62% of the CTD pool) and declined thereafter, concomitant with the steady accumulation of the 1×PO4 product. Note that no 1×PO4 product was detected at the earliest times (≤5 min) and that this species did not appear until such time as a significant fraction of the CTD had been converted to 2×PO4 CTD (Fig. 3B). These results provide strong evidence for a distributive catalytic mechanism for hydrolysis of Ser2-PO4. The kinetic profile also hinted that removal of the first phosphate was faster than removal of the second phosphate, which was in turn faster than removal of the third phosphate. Fcp1 Dephosphorylates a CTD Phosphopeptide Containing Two Heptad Repeats—The preceding experiment using a tetraheptad CTD Ser2-PO4 substrate showed clearly that Fcp1 is capable of dephosphorylating three of the four heptads. We considered two possible explanations for this result: (i) Fcp1 requires two Ser2-PO4 moieties to bind and hydrolyze the CTD or (ii) Fcp1 requires a minimal length CTD peptide flanking each Ser2-PO4 and that either the N-terminal heptad or the C-terminal heptad of the 28-aa substrate lacks the required flanking residues. To address this issue, we synthesized a 14-aa diheptad CTD peptide YSPTSPSYSPTSPS phosphorylated at Ser2 of each heptad. Reaction of Fcp1 with 100 μm of the 2×PO4 CTD peptide resulted in Pi release proportional to the amount of input enzyme in the range of 0.16–1.25 μg of Fcp1 (Fig. 4A, titration curve (•)); 48% of the input phosphoserine was hydrolyzed at saturating enzyme levels (2.5–5 μg of Fcp1). Apparently, only one of the two available Ser2-PO4 heptads served as a substrate for Fcp1. To determine which phosphoserine was dephosphorylated and which was resistant, we synthesized two 14-mer monophosphorylated CTD peptides, which contained Ser2-PO4 in either the N-terminal heptad (YSPTSPSYSPTSPS) or the C-terminal heptad (YSPTSPSYSPTSPS). Reaction of Fcp1 with 100 μm of the 1×PO4 C-terminal peptide resulted in quantitative Pi release that was proportional to input Fcp1 (Fig. 4A, titration curve (▪)). In contrast, Fcp1 was unreactive with 100 μm of the 1×PO4 N-terminal peptide at up to 5 μg of input enzyme (Fig. 4A, titration curve (□)). From the slopes of the titration curves, we calculated that Fcp1 specific activity with the 1×PO4 N-terminal peptide was 0.5% of the specific activity with the 1×PO4 C-terminal peptide substrate. A kinetic analysis under conditions of substrate excess showed that the rate and extent of Pi release were similar for the 14-mer 2×PO4 substrate and the 1×PO4 C-terminal phosphoheptad substrate (Fig. 4B). From the slopes of the curves, we calculated turnover numbers of ∼0.09 s–1 for the two diheptad CTD substrates. These experiments demonstrate that: (i) a diheptad CTD peptide suffices for effic"

Although Rac1 has not been shown to be a substrate for Dbs in either in vitro or in vivo assays, the Rat ortholog of Dbs (Ost) has been shown to bind specifically to GTP·Rac1 in vitro. The dependence of the Rac1/Dbs interaction on GTP suggests that Dbs may in fact be an effector for Rac1. Here we show that the interaction between activated Rac1 and Dbs can be recapitulated in mammalian cells and that the Rac1 docking site resides within the pleckstrin homology domain of Dbs. This interaction is specific for Rac1 and is not observed between Rac1 and several other members of the Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor family. Co-expression of Dbs with activated Rac1 causes enhanced focus forming activity and elevated levels of GTP·RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells, indicating that Dbs is activated by the interaction. Consistent with this, activated Rac1 co-localizes with Dbs in NIH 3T3 cells, and natively expressed Rac1 relocalizes in response to Dbs expression.

To summarize, we have characterized a surprisingly direct pleckstrin homology domain-mediated mechanism through which Rho GTPases can become functionally linked. The Rho proteins constitute a large branch of the Ras super-family of small GTPases. Like most small GTPases, Rho proteins function as binary switches cycling between a functionally inert GDP-bound conformation and a biologically active GTP-bound conformation. In their GTP-bound state, Rho proteins are able to participate in signaling pathways by forming productive interactions with effector proteins. The best described cellular functions of Rho proteins are their contributions to the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, their ability to activate multiple mammalian transcription factors, and their ability to impinge directly on the cell cycle machinery (1Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 2Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2096) Google Scholar). With such a diversity of roles, it is not surprising that Rho proteins have been implicated in a wide variety of cellular activities including invasion and motility, neurite growth and retraction, cytokinesis, cell growth and proliferation, and phagocytosis (2Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2096) Google Scholar, 3Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev.

Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 403-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One family of proteins that regulates the steady state levels of GTP·Rho in cells is the Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) 1The abbreviations used are: RhoGEF, Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor; DH, Dbl homology; PH, pleckstrin homology; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase. (6Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 7Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The mammalian RhoGEF family is thought to consist of over 60 members, a number of which have been identified on the basis of their transforming activity in murine fibroblasts. A well established biochemical model for RhoGEF-mediated GTPase activation has now been established (8Cherfils J. Chardin P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 306-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Small GTPases bind to nucleotides with high affinities and are generally unstable in the nucleotide-free state. Upon its own activation, a RhoGEF will form a low affinity ternary complex with the inactive GTPase and its associated GDP, which then rapidly converts to a stable guanine nucleotide exchange factor-GTPase binary complex, displacing both the GDP and Mg2+. Although this complex is relatively stable in the absence of exogenous nucleotide, the intracellular levels of GTP are high (generally 30-fold higher than GDP), which favors GTP binding. GTP will, in turn, displace the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, and the GTPase will assume an activated conformation. Once in the activated state, the GTPase is able to establish stable complexes with effector molecules. Thus, whereas RhoGEFs typically have a much greater affinity for the GDP-bound conformation of the GTPase, effector proteins have a greater affinity for the GTP-bound conformation. Virtually all members of the RhoGEF family share a common 300-amino acid structural motif composed of a Dbl homology (DH) domain arranged in tandem with a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (6Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 7Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The DH domain is unique to the RhoGEF family and contains virtually all of the residues required for substrate recognition, binding, and exchange (9Ron D. Zannini M. Lewis M. Wickner R.B. Hunt L.T.

Cell. 2000; 102: 625-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Mutations within the DH domain that abrogate exchange activity are invariably associated with loss of signaling and transforming activity (6Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 7Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The role of the PH domain in the context of RhoGEFs is uncertain. Like the DH domain, disruption of the PH domain, by truncation or point mutation, is generally associated with loss of transforming and signaling activity (6Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 7Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Replacement of the PH domains of Dbs and Lfc with a prenylation signal partially restores transforming activity, suggesting that one function of the domain is to promote the translocation of RhoGEFs to plasma membranes (13Whitehead I.

Such a function is likely to be facilitated by phosphoinositides, which have been shown to be low affinity (micromolar Kd values) ligands for many PH domains, including the one in Dbs (15Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 16Snyder J.T. Rossman K.L. Baumeister M.A. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Lemmon M.A. Sondek J. J. Biol.

However, since the affinity of PH domains for phosphoinositides is quite low (15Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), and prenylation signals can only partially restore the transforming activity of Dbs (14Whitehead I.P. Lambert Q.T. Glaven J.A. Abe K.

For example, the binding of phosphoinositides to the PH domains of RhoGEFs is also reported to modulate exchange allosterically (20Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D.

Finally, there is also evidence that PH domains can participate directly in GTPase binding and exchange independently of phospholipid binding. For example, the crystal structure of Dbs in complex with Cdc42 reveals a conformation in which residues from the PH domain contribute directly to the catalytic interface, primarily through interactions with Switch 2 (23Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Substitution of the relevant residues within the PH domain abrogates exchange activity, both in vitro and in vivo (17Rossman K.L. Cheng L. Mahon G.M. Rojas R.J. Snyder J.T. Whitehead I.P. Sondek J.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). For the moment, such direct involvement of the PH domain in regulating catalytic activity appears limited to Dbs, since the structures of the DH/PH domain modules of Tiam1 and Sos do not share this unique conformation (24Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 25Soisson S.M. Nimnual A.S. Uy M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J.

Dbs is a member of the RhoGEF family that was identified in a screen for cDNAs whose expression causes deregulated proliferation in NIH 3T3 cells (26Whitehead I. Kirk H. Kay R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 713-721PubMed Google Scholar). Like many members of the RhoGEF family, Dbs has potent transforming activity in NIH 3T3 cells as measured by loss of contact inhibition, growth in low serum, and anchorage-independent growth (14Whitehead I.P. Lambert Q.T. Glaven J.A. Abe K. Rossman K.L. Mahon G.M. Trzaskos J.M. Kay R. Campbell S.L. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7759-7770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Whitehead I. Kirk H. Kay R.

In addition to the DH/PH domain, Dbs encodes a putative amino-terminal Sec14 domain, two spectrin-like repeats, and a carboxyl-terminal Src homology 3 domain. However, only the DH and PH domains are required for cellular transformation. Throughout its DH/PH domain, Dbs is very similar to Dbl (65% identity), and like Dbl, it has in vitro catalytic activity for RhoA and Cdc42 (14Whitehead I.P. Lambert Q.T. Glaven J.A. Abe K. Rossman K.L. Mahon G.M. Trzaskos J.M. Kay R. Campbell S.L. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7759-7770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Horii Y. Beeler J.F. Sakaguchi K. Tachibana M. Miki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4776-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Although Dbs can also target RhoA and Cdc42 in vivo, substrate usage can vary in a cell type-specific manner. In NIH 3T3 cells, Dbs preferentially activates RhoA; in 293T cells, it activates Cdc42; and in COS-7 cells, it does not appear to activate either GTPase (28Cheng L. Rossman K.L. Mahon G.M. Worthylake D.K. Korus M. Sondek J. Whitehead I.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6895-6905Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). 2L. Cheng, G. M. Mahon, E. V. Kostenko, and I. P. Whitehead, unpublished observations. An analysis of Dbs mutants that have more restricted target specificities has implicated RhoA as an important mediator of transformation in NIH 3T3 cells (28Cheng L. Rossman K.L. Mahon G.M. Worthylake D.K. Korus M. Sondek J. Whitehead I.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6895-6905Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that we and others have only been able to detect Dbs-mediated exchange activity on RhoA and Cdc42, it has been reported that a full-length version of the Rat ortholog of Dbs (Ost) can specifically interact with Rac1 in an in vitro binding assay (27Horii Y. Beeler J.F. Sakaguchi K. Tachibana M. Miki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4776-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, Ost preferentially interacts with Rac1 when it is in its GTP-bound state, suggesting that Ost may be an effector of Rac1 rather than an activator. A functional relationship between Ost and Rac1 is further suggested by the observation that dominant inhibitory Rac1 can block Ost transforming activity (29Lorenzi M.V. Castagnino P. Chen Q. Hori Y. Miki T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4742-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To further investigate the possibility that Dbs may be an effector for Rac1 and thus may have the capacity to coordinately regulate Rac1 and RhoA activity, we have examined the relationship between Rac1 and Dbs in vivo. Here we show that an interaction between GTP·Rac1 and the PH domain of Dbs can be detected in mammalian cells and that this interaction has functional consequences for Dbs catalytic and transforming activity. These studies suggest a simple mechanism through which RhoGEFs can directly link Rho proteins in regulatory cascades and suggest a novel PH domain-mediated activity that may partially explain the invariant topography of the DH/PH domain module. Molecular Constructs—The pAX142 mammalian expression vector has been described previously (26Whitehead I. Kirk H. Kay R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 713-721PubMed Google Scholar). pAX142-dbs-HA6, pAX142-dbs-HA7, pAX142-dbs-HA8, pAX142-dbl-HA1, pAX142-lfc-D6HA, pAX142-lsc-D7HA, and pAX142-ect2-HA1 contain hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged derivatives of the respective RhoGEFs that have been described previously (30Westwick J.K.

Dbs-HA7 is identical to Dbs-HA8 except that it is fused at the carboxyl terminus to the plasma membrane-targeting sequence (GCM-SCKCVLS) present at the carboxyl terminus of H-Ras. pAX142-dbs-HA, pAX142-dbs-HA9, and pAX142-dbs-HA10 contain residues 1–1139, 791–967, and 968–1097 of Dbs, respectively, fused at their amino termini to an HA epitope tag. cDNA sequences of all constructs were verified by automated sequencing. pAX142-rac1(61L), pAX142-rac1(17N), pAX142-rhoA(63L), pAX142-cdc42(17N), and pAX142-cdc42(12V) have been described previously (14Whitehead I.P.

GST-PBD and GST-C21 contain the Rho binding domains from the Cdc42/Rac1 effector protein PAK3 and the RhoA effector protein Rhotekin, respectively (28Cheng L. Rossman K.L. Mahon G.M. Worthylake D.K.

Cell Culture, Transfection, and Transformation Assays—NIH 3T3 and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with either 10% bovine calf serum (NIH 3T3; JRH) or 10% fetal bovine serum (293T; Sigma). Primary focus formation assays were performed in NIH 3T3 cells exactly as described previously (31Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected by Lipofect-AMINE reagent (Invitrogen), and focus formation was scored visually at 14 days. Protein Expression—Protein expression in transiently transfected 293T and NIH 3T3 cells, was determined by Western blot analysis as described previously (13Whitehead I. Kirk H. Tognon C. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Kay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18388-18395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Protein was visualized with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Co-immunoprecipitations—Co-immunoprecipitations in 293T and NIH 3T3 cells were performed as described previously (32Mahon G.M. Wang W. Korus M. Kostenko E. Cheng L. Sun T. Arlinghaus R.B. Whitehead I.P. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 437-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixtures (Calbiochem). Lysates were precleared with 0.25 μg of agarose-conjugated normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) by rotation for 30 min at 4 °C and precipitated with agarose-conjugated mouse monoclonal HA antibody (F7; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) by rotation at 4 °C for 2 h. The immunoprecipitate was washed four times with cold lysis buffer and then resuspended in loading dye. Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA Activation Assays—Affinity purification assays to measure cellular levels of GTP·Rac1, GTP·Cdc42, and GTP·RhoA were performed as described previously (28Cheng L. Rossman K.L. Mahon G.M. Worthylake D.K. Korus M. Sondek J. Whitehead I.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6895-6905Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Total and GTP-bound Cdc42, RhoA, and Rac1 were detected by monoclonal antibodies (Cdc42 and RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Rac1 (BD Transduction Laboratories)). Immunostaining—NIH 3T3 cells were transiently co-transfected with 1 μg of either pAX142 or pAX142-dbs-HA6 and 1 μg of either pAX142 rac1(61L) or pAX142 rhoA(63L) using LipofectAMINE reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). At 24 h post-transfection, cells were trypsinized and plated on coverslips at low density. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde (in phosphate-buffered saline) for 10 min and then permeabilized and blocked in 0.1% Triton X-100, 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. Coverslips were then incubated in a humidity chamber with a rabbit anti-HA polyclonal antibody (Y-11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in conjunction with either a mouse anti-Rac1 monoclonal antibody (clone 102; BD Transduction Laboratories) or a mouse anti-RhoA monoclonal antibody (clone 119; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), for 1 h in 0.1% Triton X-100 with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Coverslips were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with green-fluorescent Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit to detect HA-tagged Dbs and red fluorescent Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG to detect either RhoA or Rac1 (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), for 30 min in the dark. Coverslips were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and mounted on glass slides using FluorSave reagent (Calbiochem). Cells were viewed with an Olympus IX50 inverted microscope, and images were captured using the optronics digital CCD camera system. Images were analyzed in Adobe Photoshop. Dbs Interacts with Rac1 in a GTP-dependent Manner in Vivo—Dbs-HA6 is an HA-tagged, oncogenic version of Dbs that contains intact DH and PH domains along with flanking sequences (30Westwick J.K. Lee R.J. Lambert Q.T. Symons M. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Whitehead I.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16739-16747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Rac1(61L) and Cdc42(12V) are GTPase-defective, GAP-insensitive mutants that accumulate in the GTP-bound form, whereas Cdc42(17N) and Rac1(17N) are dominant inhibitory mutants that accumulate in the GDP-bound form. We have shown previously in in vitro assays that Dbs-HA6 can catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP on Cdc42 and RhoA but not Rac1 (14Whitehead I.P. Lambert Q.T. Glaven J.A. Abe K. Rossman K.L. Mahon G.M. Trzaskos J.M. Kay R. Campbell S.L. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7759-7770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the in vitro data, when we expressed Dbs-HA6 in 293T cells, we observed elevated levels of GTP·Cdc42 but not GTP·Rac1 (Fig. 1A). To determine whether the in vitro association of Dbs with GTP·Rac1 could be recapitulated in this cell type, we co-expressed Dbs-HA6 with either Rac1(61L), Rac1(17N), Cdc42(12V), or Cdc42(17N) and then performed co-immunoprecipitations using an anti-HA (F7; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) monoclonal antibody. Although we were readily able to detect an interaction between Dbs and Rac1(61L), we were only able to detect a weak interaction between Dbs and Rac1(17N) (Fig. 1B). In contrast, we were not able to detect an association between Dbs-HA6 and Cdc42(12V) but were able to detect an interaction between Cdc42(17N) and Dbs (Fig. 1C). Our observation that Dbs binds to GDP·Cdc42 but not GTP·Cdc42 is typical of an interaction between a Rho-GEF and its substrate. However, our observation that Dbs has a higher affinity for GTP·Rac1 than GDP·Rac1 confirms the in vitro data (27Horii Y. Beeler J.F. Sakaguchi K. Tachibana M. Miki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4776-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and suggests that Dbs may function as an effector for Rac1 in vivo. Since an interaction between full-length Ost and Rac1 has been demonstrated in vitro (27Horii Y. Beeler J.F. Sakaguchi K. Tachibana M. Miki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4776-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), we also wondered whether Rac1(61L) could interact with full-length Dbs in vivo. To confirm such an interaction, we constructed a full-length HA-tagged version of Dbs (designated Dbs-HA). When we co-expressed Dbs-HA with Rac1(61L) in 293T cells, we were readily able to detect an interaction by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1D). Specificity of the Rac1/Dbs Interaction—To determine whether the ability to form stable complexes with activated Rac1 in 293T cells is a characteristic of all RhoGEFs, we examined four additional RhoGEF family members for an interaction with Rac1(61L). Dbl-HA1, Lfc-D6HA, Lsc-D7HA, and Ect2-HA1 are constitutively activated, HA-tagged versions of RhoGEFs that contain intact DH/PH domain modules (30Westwick J.K. Lee R.J. Lambert Q.T. Symons M. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Whitehead I.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16739-16747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Each RhoGEF family member was co-expressed with Rac1(61L) in 293T cells, and co-immunoprecipitations were performed. Dbs-HA6 was also included in the panel as a positive control for binding. Despite the fact that all panel members were expressed at roughly equivalent levels, we were only able to detect an interaction between Rac1(61L) and Dbs-HA6 (Fig. 2). This suggests that the interaction with GTP·Rac1 does not extend to all RhoGEF family members and may reflect a novel relationship between Rac1 and Dbs. GTP·Rac1 Interacts with the PH Domain of Dbs—Since Dbs does not interact with Rac1 in a manner that is consistent with a substrate interaction, we wondered whether the Rac1 binding site in Dbs lies outside of the catalytic DH domain. To address this possibility, we subdivided Dbs-HA6 into several smaller fragments (Fig. 3A) and examined them for their ability to interact with Rac1(61L) (Fig. 3B). Dbs-HA8 is a transformation-defective version of Dbs-HA6 that lacks all sequences carboxyl-terminal to the DH domain. Dbs-HA7 is equivalent to Dbs-HA8 except that it is fused to an isoprenylation signal derived from H-Ras. We have shown previously that this membrane localization signal restores transforming activity to the transformation-defective Dbs-HA8 derivative (14Whitehead I.P. Lambert Q.T. Glaven J.A. Abe K. Rossman K.L. Mahon G.M. Trzaskos J.M. Kay R. Campbell S.L. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7759-7770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dbs-HA9 contains the isolated PH domain, and Dbs-HA10 contains the residues that are located carboxyl-terminal to the PH domain. Each member of the panel as well as Dbs-HA6 was co-expressed with Rac1(61L) in 293T cells, and co-immunoprecipitations were performed (Fig. 3B). Although all derivatives were expressed at roughly equivalent levels, an interaction was only observed with Dbs-HA6 and Dbs-HA9. We conclude that the Rac1 docking site within Dbs resides within the PH domain. It has been shown previously that the PH domain of Dbs contributes several residues (Tyr889 and Lys885) to the catalytic interface with its substrate, Cdc42 (23Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and that substitution of these residues blocks exchange activity, both in vitro and in vivo (17Rossman K.L. Cheng L.

Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To determine whether the PH domain-mediated interaction with Rac1 requires a contribution from these residues, we introduced the relevant substitutions into Dbs-HA6 (Y889F and K885A) and then examined these mutants for Rac1 binding (Fig. 3C). Neither of these two mutants was impaired in its ability to bind with Rac1(61L), again suggesting that the interaction between Rac1 and Dbs differs from the conventional interaction between this RhoGEF and its substrates. The GTP·Rac1/Dbs Interaction Can Occur Independently of Phosphoinositide Binding—Many RhoGEFs, including Dbs, have been shown to interact with phosphoinositides in a PH domain-dependent manner (16Snyder J.T. Rossman K.L. Baumeister M.A. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Lemmon M.A. Sondek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45868-45875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we identified the lipid binding pocket within the PH domain of Dbs and characterized point mutations that are completely defective in phosphoinositide binding (17Rossman K.L.

Since activated Rac1 is thought to be localized to the plasma membrane in NIH 3T3 cells (33Michaelson D. Silletti J. Murphy G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M. Philips M.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), we wondered whether Rac1(61L) binding in vivo is dependent upon an association between the PH domain and lipids. To address this possibility, several of the Dbs phosphoinositide-binding mutations (K892E, K849E/K851E, and R855E/K857E) were"

Asp-59 was the only site at which a protonatable residue appeared to be essential for pH gating. Mutation of Glu-110 or Glu-114 in PL2 did not affect the pH0.5 of gating. A chimera, where the entire periplasmic domain of HhUreI was fused to the membrane domain of Streptococcus salivarius UreI (SsUreI), retained the pH-independent properties of SsUreI.

Labigne A. De Reuse H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1021-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Expression of UreI is essential for survival of H. pylori in acid at physiological urea concentrations in vitro and for infection of either mouse or gerbil stomach (11Skouloubris S. Thiberge J.M. Labigne A. De Reuse H. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4517-4521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Mollenhauer-Rektorschek M. Hanauer G. Sachs G. Melchers K. Res. Microbiol. 2002; 153: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). HpUreI accelerates urea flux across the inner membrane and thereby increases access of medium urea to the intrabacterial urease by 300-fold as compared with uptake by simple diffusion (9Weeks D.L. Sachs G. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The increased rate of uptake under acidic conditions results in a 10- to 20-fold increase of intrabacterial urease activity increasing buffering of cytoplasmic and periplasmic pH (8Scott D.R. Marcus E.A. Weeks D.L. Lee A. Melchers K. Sachs G. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Channel closure at neutral pH serves to safeguard against lethal alkalinization (13Meyer-Rosberg K. Scott D.R. Rex D. Melchers K. Sachs G. Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 886-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) due to excessive urease activity. Among the UreIs, the six transmembrane segments are ∼85% homologous, and the cytoplasmic domain is also conserved; however, the periplasmic domains, with either 24 (SsUreI and HhUreI) or 47 (HpUreI) amino acids, are non-conserved. HpUreI is acid-activated, whereas SsUreI is pH-independent. SsUreI has only one protonatable residue in its periplasmic domain in comparison to the fourteen present in HpUreI. The paucity of protonatable residues in the former is consistent with the pH independence of this urea channel (9Weeks D.L. Sachs G. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here we show that UreI of H. hepaticus, with only 24 periplasmic amino acids, is proton-gated like HpUreI. Being composed of only 170 amino acids, HhUreI represents the simplest known acid-gated channel. In contrast to mutations of HpUreI (9Weeks D.L. Sachs G. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 10Bury-Mone S. Skouloubris S. Labigne A. De Reuse H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1021-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Mollenhauer M. Mit freund lichen Grüβen. University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany2002Google Scholar), active mutants of all six protonatable periplasmic amino acids of HhUreI could be generated with almost full retention of urea transport at acidic pH, allowing analysis of each of their roles in pH gating. While it was possible to observe acid activation in histidine-less mutants, both histidines and carboxylic acid residues likely coordinate to create a distributed pH sensor with a pH0.5 of 6.8, nearly one pH unit higher than in HpUreI. Further, the pH independence of chimeras containing the SsUreI membrane domain and the HhUreI periplasmic domain indicates that protonation-induced periplasmic conformational changes must also affect the membrane conformation to produce acid gating in HhUreI. Urease Assays—The pHp8080 (15McGee D.J. May C.A. Garner R.M. Himpsl J.M. Mobley H.L. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2477-2484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) plasmid encoding the entire H. pylori urease gene cluster and NixA was mutated using the QuikChange mutagenesis system (Stratagene) to create the E138D mutation in ureI shown previously to completely inactivate channel activity of HpUreI. The resulting plasmid pHp8080/138D was complemented in trans by pBlSK (Stratagene) containing ureI of H. pylori or H. hepaticus. SE5000 Escherichia coli containing both pHp8080/138D and pBlSK/UreI were grown overnight in Luria Broth (LB) supplemented with 20 μm NiCl2. 100 μl of overnight culture was added to 900 μl of Hp Buffer (100 mm NaH2PO4, 138 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 1 mm glutamine, and 5 mm [14C]urea with a specific activity of 10 mCi/mmol) at various pHs and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with constant agitation. Urease activity was measured radiometrically (16Scott D.R. Weeks D.L. Hong C. Postius S. Melchers K. Sachs G. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 58-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) where plastic wells containing 0.5 m KOH-soaked filter paper hung from rubber stoppers were used to collect the total 14CO2 that resulted from the hydrolysis of urea by urease. The reaction mixture was terminated by the addition of 5 n H2SO4 to expel all 14CO2 from solution. The wells were placed in scintillation mixture (Hionic-Fluor, Packard Instruments, Meriden, CT), and the radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Urease activity is reported as nmol of CO2 released/min/mg of protein. Protein concentration was determined using the Pierce protein assay. There was no change of medium pH during the incubation. Data represent three independent assays performed in triplicate. Oocyte Vectors and Mutagenesis—Point mutants and chimeras of the ureIs were constructed using a two-step method of site-directed mutagenesis (9Weeks D.L. Sachs G. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Mutagenic PCR products were digested with XbaI and KpnI (New England Biolabs) and ligated into pcDNA3.1– (Invitrogen) downstream of a T7 promoter and upstream of a 170-bp poly(A) tract. The poly(A) tract, not present in the parental vector used previously, increased protein expression ∼5-fold over levels reported in previous studies (7Weeks D.L. Eskandari S. Scott D.R. Sachs G. Science. 2000; 287: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 9Weeks D.L. Sachs G. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To achieve comparable steady state levels of uptake and to avoid premature equilibration, the time of incubation was shortened to 6 min from the previous time of 30 min. As a result of shorter reaction times, background urea uptake due to UreI-independent diffusion of urea across the oocyte plasma membrane was significantly reduced. All constructs were sequenced (Keck Sequencing Facility, New Haven, CT) prior to use as a template for RNA generation. RNA Preparation—10 μg of ureI pcDNA3.1– vectors were linearized by digestion with EcoRI (New England Biolabs). The reaction product was column-purified (Wizard preps, Promega) and eluted in 50 μl to achieve a final concentration of 200 ng/μl. The linearized vectors were then used as templates for in vitro transcription to capped RNA using the mMessage mMachine cRNA kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Urea Uptake Assays—Xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with 46.6 nl of cRNA (1 μg/μl) using the Nanoject II injection system (Drummond) at room temperature and then incubated at 18 °C in Barth’s solution (88 mm NaCl, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 1 mm KCl, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, 2.4 mm NaHCO3 and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) for 24 h to allow for expression prior to performing the assay. 6–8 oocytes containing each cRNA were transferred into 1 ml of Ringer’s reaction buffer (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 50 μm [14C]urea buffered with 20 mm Mes (pH ≤ 6.0) or 20 mm Hepes (pH ≥ 6.5)) at room temperature for 6 min. The oocytes were then washed twice by transfer to 25 ml of Barth’s solution (pH 7.4) to remove any external [14C]urea and then transferred to individual vials for quantification by liquid scintillation counting. For measurement of pH dependence of wild-type or mutant UreIs, the oocytes were suspended at varying pH using the Mes and Hepes buffers as above. Data represent at least three independent experiments performed each with a minimum of 5–7 oocytes. The pH0.5 of a channel construct was the pH at which uptake corresponded to the midpoint between maximal and minimal uptake. Urease Activity in Transformed E. coli—Urease activity was measured as a function of medium pH in intact E. coli expressing active H. pylori urease and an inactivated HpUreI as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Complementation with wild-type HhUreI or HpUreI then allowed a 6-fold acid activation of urease with half-maximal activity at pH 7.1 and 6.2, respectively, due to urea uptake through UreI (Fig. 1a). Although useful, this method of assessing UreI channel gating is an indirect one sensitive to levels of urease expression. The pH of half-maximal activation of various constructs obtained using this system was right-shifted by 0.2–0.3 units as compared with direct measurements of activation obtained via quantification of uptake into Xenopus oocytes. The shift in pH0.5 was most likely the result of limited urease expression in the E. coli system, which enabled saturation of urease activity at pHs above those required to achieve maximal channel open probability. pH Activation of Transport by the UreIs in Xenopus Oocytes— The uptake of [14C]urea into oocytes expressing the wild-type HhUreI in Xenopus oocytes was pH-dependent with half-maximal urea uptake at pH 6.8 (Fig. 1b). This is defined here as the pH0.5 of wild-type HhUreI. Background urea uptake in mock-injected oocytes was less than 1 pmol of urea/oocyte/6 min (Table I), whereas HhUreI-injected oocytes had uptake of ∼11 pmol of urea/oocyte/6 min at pH 5.0, a 19-fold enhancement of urea transport. Urea uptake at pH 7.5 was also greater in oocytes injected with wild-type HhureI cRNA than when injected with inactive HhureI mutants or in sham-injected oocytes. Hence, wild-type HhUreI has a low but finite open probability at neutral pH. HpUreI has a lower pH0.5 of activation of 6.0 (9Weeks D.L. Sachs G. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and unlike HhUreI, uptake by HpUreI is undetectable at neutral pH (Table I). SsUreI-catalyzed urea uptake was pH-independent, and the maximal rate of urea uptake was slightly higher than for HhUreI-expressing oocytes (Fig. 1b).Table IUrea transportpH 5.0pH 7.5pH0.5pmol of urealoocyte/6 minWild-type UreIH. hepaticus UreI11.4 ± 0.41.3 ± 0.16.8S. salivarius UreI14.3 ± 0.214.3 ± 0.2H. pylori UreI13.0 ± 0.40.7 ± 0.16.0Sham-injected0.6 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.1Mutations of H. hepaticus UreIH23N15.4 ± 0.61.8 ± 0.7n.d.H50Q10.4 ± 0.64.1 ± 0.56.2H50L13.2 ± 0.63.8 ± 0.66.3H50K10.7 ± 0.39.5 ± 0.3N54T12.8 ± 0.41.7 ± 0.36.8E56Q9.7 ± 0.40.8 ± 0.16.2N58T11.9 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.16.4D59E8.8 ± 0.31.5 ± 0.16.1D59N1.3 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.1n.d.E110Q12.6 ± 0.61.8 ± 0.36.7E114Q11.4 ± 0.83.5 ± 0.47.0E114D2.7 ± 0.40.9 ± 0.2n.d.H170K12.4 ± 0.81.3 ± 0.16.3H170Q11.0 ± 1.01.7 ± 0.66.3H50Q/H170Q10.4 ± 0.52.2 ± 0.56.2Mutations of S. salivarius UreIE59Q12.4 ± 0.414.3 ± 0.4 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2 shows a model of the two-dimensional structure of the HhUreI accompanied by the alignment of HhUreI and SsUreI. The putative periplasmic domains, PL1, PL2, and the C terminus, are relatively well defined by hydrophilic amino acids at their boundaries and by various predictive algorithms. All six protonatable residues and two asparagines in the HhUreI periplasmic domain, the glutamic acid conserved in the sixth transmembrane segment (TM6) of all UreIs, and the lone histidine in the cytoplasmic domain of HhUreI were mutated to identify protonatable residues relevant to pH activation. Replacement of the single histidine, His-23, in the cytoplasmic domain with Asn or replacement of the lone glutamic acid in the membrane domain by glutamine had no effect on urea transport. Hence, these residues are not implicated in medium pH regulation of urea transport (data not shown). Mutation of His-50 in PL1 to either glutamine or leucine resulted in an increase of urea uptake at pH 7.5 with near wild-type uptake at pH 5.0 (Table I and Fig. 3). Hence, there was retention of acid activation but a decreased stability of the closed conformation at alkaline pH. The pH0.5 of H50L was left-shifted to pH 6.3 as compared with the wild-type pH0.5 of 6.8. The pH0.5 of H50Q was decreased slightly farther to pH 6.2. Mutation of His-50 to the positively charged Lys resulted in a fully active channel at both neutral and acidic pH. Other mutations such as H50Y and H50N showed less than 30% of wild-type maximal activity and were not further studied (data not shown). Mutation of the C-terminal His-170 to Gln or Lys lowered the pH0.5 to ∼6.3 suggesting that this histidine may also be involved in proton gating of wild-type HhUreI (Table I and Fig. 3). Mutation of both periplasmic histidines in HhUreI to glutamine (H50Q/H170Q) had an effect similar to that of the H50Q mutation, namely, increased uptake at alkaline pH and a left-shifted pH0.5 of channel activation (Table I and Fig. 3). Histidines, therefore, are not essential for the acid gating of HhUreI, but their presence close to the transmembrane boundaries of TM2 and TM6 affects the pH profile of activation. Three glutamates and one aspartate are predicted to be in the HhUreI periplasmic domain (Fig. 2). The participation of these residues in pH sensing is strongly suggested by the observation of pH gating in the histidine-less mutant (H50Q/H170Q). Substitution of Glu-56 by Gln in PL1 shifted the pH0.5 to ∼6.2 (Table I and Fig. 3). Mutation of Asp-59 to the neutral Asn, Ser, or Thr inactivated uptake of urea at any pH, whereas substitution with Glu allowed uptake with a lowered pH0.5 of pH ∼6.1. Asp-59 was in fact the only site at which a protonatable residue appeared to be essential for pH gating. Mutation of Asn-58 to Thr also led to a decrease in pH0.5 to pH 6.4. While Asn-58 is not protonatable, the proximity of this mutation to Asp-59 may have decreased the native hydrogen-bonding capacity of the aspartyl side group. In keeping with this interpretation, the mutation of the more distal Asn-54 to Thr did not affect pH0.5. In contrast to mutations in PL1, mutations in PL2 did not significantly alter the pH profile of activation. Mutation of Glu-110 to Gln had a near wild-type pH0.5 of 6.7. Similarly, mutation of the Glu-114 to glutamine resulted in only a modest shift in pH0.5 to pH 7.0. The latter also showed a modest increase in open probability at pH 7.5; however, as uptake continued to decrease at pH 8.0, this effect was likely at least partially due to the rightward shift of pH0.5. The S. salivarius urea channel is medium pH-independent (Table II and Fig. 3) with no homology in the periplasmic domain to either H. pylori or H. hepaticus UreI but 85% homology in the membrane domain (Fig. 2). Minor similarities exist, namely a permanently charged lysine in place of the protonatable histidine in the HhUreI C terminus and a glutamic acid, Glu-59, in place of the critical Asp-59 residue of HhUreI. The mutation, E59Q, in SsUreI had no effect on transport (Table I). The availability of the highly homologous membrane domain of SsUreI allowed evaluation of the contribution of changes in the membrane domain to the different states of HhUreI. Chimeras exchanging the periplasmic loops and C-terminal segments were constructed to determine whether the presence of the periplasmic domain of HhUreI was sufficient to confer the property of pH gating onto the pH-insensitive SsUreI.Table IIUrea transportpH 5.0pH 7.5pmol of urea/oocyte/6 minChimeras with SsUreI membrane domainWt-Ss14.3 ± 0.214.3 ± 0.2Hh1-Ss11.5 ± 0.611.2 ± 0.3Hh2-Ss11.9 ± 0.511.7 ± 0.6HhC4-Ss0.8 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.1HhC10-Ss10.7 ± 0.411.9 ± 0.3Hh1,2-Ss8.9 ± 0.310.2 ± 0.4Hh1,2,C10-Ss12.4 ± 0.312.4 ± 0.6Chimeras with HhUreI membrane domainWt-Hh11.4 ± 0.41.3 ± 0.1Ss1-Hh10.6 ± 0.610.9 ± 0.6Ss2-Hh1.5 ± 0.40.9 ± 0.2SsC3-Hh3.7 ± 0.40.8 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab Chimeras between the SsUreI Periplasmic Regions and the HhUreI Membrane Domain—Replacement of the PL1 of HhUreI with that of SsUreI (Ss1-Hh) resulted in a transporter fully and equally active at alkaline and acidic pH. This result implies that PL1 imparts a specific conformation to the channel that allows channel closure at neutral pH. Furthermore, the presumed role of PL1 in acid gating of this channel would appear to be dependent on a protonation-induced disruption of this closed conformation. All data pertaining to the chimeras are presented in Table II. Replacement of PL2 of HhUreI with PL2 of SsUreI (Ss2-Hh) inactivated the channel. Presumably, the structure of PL2 may confer stability to the open conformation of the transmembrane helices, stability otherwise inherent in the pH-independent SsUreI. Replacement of the four C-terminal amino acids of HhUreI with the three C-terminal amino acids of SsUreI (SsC3-Hh) resulted in a transporter with about 30% open probability at acidic pH and a closed state at neutral pH. Hence, changes in the C terminus also affect pH gating of this channel as was also seen with the mutation of His-170. As postulated for PL2, the HhUreI C terminus may confer stability to the open conformation of the channel. Chimeras between the HhUreI Periplasmic Domain and the SsUreI Membrane Domain—Replacement of either the first or second periplasmic loops of SsUreI with those of HhUreI (Hh1-Ss or Hh2-Ss) resulted in a protein with transport properties similar to those of the wild-type SsUreI, namely, equal and high pH-independent uptake. Replacement of the three C-terminal amino acids of SsUreI with the four amino acids of HhUreI (HhC4-Ss) resulted in an inactive channel. However, if the preceding six C-terminal residues were also exchanged (HhC10-Ss), a fully active channel with properties similar to wild-type SsUreI was obtained. Hence, the specific structure of TM6 and the C terminus of SsUreI is not required for channel function. Moreover, as the C-terminal lysine of SsUreI is replaced by a histidine in the HhC10-Ss without disrupting transport at either pH 5.0 or 7.5, protonation of the C terminus does not affect the open probability of the native SsUreI. In multiloop chimeras with the S. salivarius UreI membrane domain, replacement of both the first and second periplasmic loop with those of HhUreI (Hh1,2-Ss) generated an active channel at both acidic and alkaline pH, similar to the results where the periplasmic loops were substituted individually (Hh1-Ss and Hh2-Ss). All three periplasmic domains could also be simultaneously replaced by those of HhUreI (Hh1,2,C10-Ss), with retention of full pH-independent activity like that of the wild-type SsUreI. Hence, the membrane domain of HhUreI, but not that of SsUreI, is able to close in response to deprotonation of the periplasmic domain. Therefore, the properties of the membrane domain of SsUreI appear to be dominant, and changes of conformation in the periplasmic domain of HhUreI are by themselves unable to affect the conformation of the transmembrane helices of SsUreI. Previously, mutagenesis of the UreI of H. pylori was performed to identify the sites involved in pH gating. Mutations were analyzed either directly, by quantitative measurement of [14C]urea uptake into Xenopus oocytes (9Weeks D.L. Sachs G. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), or indirectly, by measurement of urease activity in H. pylori where ureI was mutated by allelic replacement (10Bury-Mone S. Skouloubris S. Labigne A. De Reuse H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1021-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) or in an ureI-deficient strain of H. pylori complemented by various mutated ureIs (14Mollenhauer M. Mit freund lichen Grüβen. University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany2002Google Scholar). All methods showed that urea transport through HpUreI is acid-activated. However, with regards to characterization of one key residue, His-123, the results of Bury-Mone et al. (10Bury-Mone S. Skouloubris S. Labigne A. De Reuse H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1021-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) were found to contradict the findings obtained using Xenopus oocytes. With the exception of this report by Bury-Mone and colleagues (10Bury-Mone S. Skouloubris S. Labigne A. De Reuse H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1021-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), functional descriptions of HpUreI expressed in oocytes and H. pylori have been indistinguishable (17Rektorschek M. Buhmann A. Weeks D. Schwan D. Bensch K.W. Eskandari S. Scott D. Sachs G. Melchers K. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Further, the urea channel of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Yut, has been shown to function similarly both in oocytes and in H. pylori (4Sebbane F. Bury-Mone S. Cailliau K. Browaeys-Poly E. De Reuse H. Simonet M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Finally, another laboratory (14Mollenhauer M. Mit freund lichen Grüβen. University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany2002Google Scholar), analyzing mutants of H. pylori UreI in H. pylori, confirmed many of the original findings of the oocyte studies including those of His-123. Thus, the hypothesis that the mechanism of pH gating might differ when HpUreI is expressed in oocytes as compared with H. pylori requires additional substantiation. Here we have shown that HhUreI is an acid-gated urea channel like HpUreI whether expressed in E. coli or in Xenopus oocytes. Acidification opens the channel, and protons are the only activating ligands in these experiments. Since the chimera containing the entire periplasmic domain of HhUreI and the membrane and cytoplasmic domains of SsUreI was pH-insensitive, a change of both periplasmic and membrane conformation in HhUreI must result from protonation of the relevant periplasmic residues. HhUreI is homologous in its membrane and cytoplasmic domains to those of HpUreI and SsUreI but differs markedly in the periplasmic domain. In evolution, it seems likely that an archetypical pH-insensitive UreI, perhaps SsUreI, was modified to attain both flexibility in the transmembrane helices and protonatable amino acids that allowed for pH gating. The evolution of the acid gate was probably an adaptation to increased constitutive expression of urease activity and the danger of high activity at alkaline pH for these neutralophiles (13Meyer-Rosberg K. Scott D.R. Rex D. Melchers K. Sachs G. Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 886-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Several ion-conducting channels have been shown to be sensitive to either cytoplasmic or external pH. Examples include the vanilloid (VR1) and N-methyl d-aspartate receptors, the Kv1.1 (ROMK) and Slo1-BK channels, the family of acidsensing ion channels, and an outwardly rectifying Cl– channel found in Sertoli cells (19Jordt S.E.

These channels are typically large multisubunit assemblies sensitive to effects on multiple regions of the protein by modulatory and allosteric regulation. Studies have revealed various mechanisms by which protons can either enhance or abrogate transport. In the case of the vanilloid receptor, the primary effect of extracellular protons is to potentiate the binding of capsaicin (19Jordt S.E. Tominaga M. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8134-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). For the acid-sensing ion channels, extracellular protons enhance the release of Ca2+, enabling ion conduction (25Immke D.C. McCleskey E.W. Neuron. 2003; 37: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In the voltage-sensitive ROMK channel (Kir1.1) and the Slo1-BK channel, intracellular protons modify local surface potential, thereby shifting the voltage dependence of activation (21Flagg T.P. Yoo D. Sciortino C.M. Tate M. Romero M.F. Welling P.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 544: 351-362Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 22Avdonin V. Tang X.D. Hoshi T. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2969-2980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). pH-sensitive transport of a neutral solute has also been described in aquaporin 3 (AQP3) in which extracellular protons block transport by competing with glycerol for binding sites within the channel conduction pathway (26Zeuthen T.

In a manner more analogous to H. pylori and H. hepaticus UreI, protons directly activate transport in channels such as the ClC-2G channel (27Stroffekova K. Kupert E.Y. Malinowska D.H. Cuppoletti J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: 1113-1123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the N-methyl d-aspartate receptor (in the presence of saturating concentrations of glutamate) (20Low C. Lyuboslavsky P. French A.

Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1212-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and the KATP channel (28Xu H. Wu J. Cui N. Abdulkadir L. Wang R. Mao J. Giwa L.R. Chanchevalap S. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38690-38696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of the ClC-2G channel showed that transport could be abolished by substitution of one or more carboxylic amino acids (27Stroffekova K. Kupert E.Y. Malinowska D.H. Cuppoletti J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: 1113-1123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several residues were thus associated with channel gating; however, attempts to draw a clear mechanism for pH activation were frustrated by inactive mutants as the observed loss of function could have resulted from structural disruption rather than loss of pH-sensing capability. In the case of the KATP channel, a single pH-sensing histidine was found to be central to activation by intracellular acidity with a pH0.5 of 6.0 (28Xu H. Wu J. Cui N. Abdulkadir L. Wang R. Mao J. Giwa L.R. Chanchevalap S. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38690-38696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast, an extensive mutagenesis study of the N-methyl d-aspartate receptor channel found that no single residue could be identified as the pH sensor (20Low C. Lyuboslavsky P. French A. Le P. Wyatte K. Thiel W.H. Marchan E.M. Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Gernert K. Williams K. Traynelis S.F. Zheng F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1212-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Mutation of a variety of amino acids that were protonatable, non-protonatable but hydrogen bond-forming, and those that were neither hydrogen bond acceptors nor donors resulted in altered pH sensitivity. Data such as these suggested that protonatable residues in different regions were spatially coordinated to generate an overall pH0.5 of activation distinct from the individual pKa values of involved side chains. Given that neutral residue replacement of five of six protonatable periplasmic residues in HhUreI failed to abrogate pH gating, either the single irreplaceable residue, Asp-59, must dominate channel activation as in the case of the KATP channel (28Xu H. Wu J. Cui N. Abdulkadir L. Wang R. Mao J. Giwa L.R. Chanchevalap S. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38690-38696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), or multiple residues must contribute toward the formation of a more diffusely organized pH sensor. Findings in the current work are in keeping with the latter hypothesis. Individual mutation of at least four residues in PL1 and the C terminus significantly alters the pH0.5 of HhUreI suggesting that the transition between the open and closed states is accomplished by the restructuring of a network of hydrogen bonds. Finally, as pH gating persists in the absence of periplasmic histidines and the pH0.5 of 6.8 in the wild type is well above the predicted pKa of an aspartyl or glutamyl side chain, channel gating likely reflects the response of a coordinated system rather than protonation of a single residue. The requirement of the membrane domain of HhUreI for pH activation in the chimeric constructs with the SsUreI membrane domain also showed the need for interaction between periplasmic and membrane domains. The relative simplicity of this pH-gated neutral solute channel, as compared with the ion channels studied thus far, and the ability to generate active chimeras of a pH-gated and a pH-independent channel have, therefore, provided the basis for a model involving both periplasm and membrane in pH activation of urea transport. A hypothetical model consistent with the mutational data is shown in Fig. 4. It is postulated that the formation of hydrogen bonds between His-50 and Asp-59 as well as between Glu-56 and His-170 results in an increase in separation between TM2, TM3, and TM6. Relative motion of these and an unspecified transmembrane segment (perhaps TM4 since it has a hydrophilic face) allows entry of urea into a monomeric channel under acidic but not neutral conditions. The decision to draw the functional pore as a monomer is based on the lack of support for functional interaction between subunits in co-expression experiments designed to show dominant negative interactions between wild-type and mutant channels. The four transmembrane helices shown forming the pore are predicted to be the minimum number of helices capable of forming a conduction pathway (18Spencer R.H. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 207-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 20Low C. Lyuboslavsky P. French A. Le P. Wyatte K. Thiel W.H. Marchan E.M. Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Gernert K. Williams K.

None of the pro-nucleotides inhibited adenylyl cyclase per se, whether isolated from rat brain or OB1771 cells. These compounds exhibit the hallmarks of prodrugs.

In general, the problem of membrane permeability has been circumvented by the use of nucleosides in studies with intact cell systems. Consequently, to inhibit cAMP formation in intact cells, investigators have relied on adenine nucleosides (e.g. Refs. 11Fain J.N. Pointer R.H. Ward W.F. J. Biol.

To circumvent the general problem of poor permeability of nucleotides in intact cells, biodegradable lipophilic groups have been chemically linked to nucleoside phosphate group(s), giving families of pro-nucleotides that are uncharged and membrane-permeable (25Alexander P.

Second, the otherwise highly selective and often rate-limiting initial phosphorylation of a nucleoside is bypassed because the nucleoside monophosphate has been transported into the cell (25Alexander P.

The nucleoside monophosphate can then readily be phosphorylated by intracellular enzymes to the corresponding polyphosphate, often the most potent and desired form. Third, its specificity can be controlled by use of specific bases or nucleosides. Fourth, its efficacy to affect cells and tissues can be controlled by the choice and character of the phosphate-protecting moieties. The efficacy of pro-nucleotides relies on their uptake, their intracellular deprotection, either spontaneously (34Meier C. Lorey M. De Clercq E. Balzarini J. Bioorg. Med. Chem.

Although this compound exerted effects on intact cells, it was difficult to handle because of poor solubility in most solvents usable with cells. Presented here are the syntheses of protected phosphate derivatives of 9-substituted adenines and their effects on adenylyl cyclase in isolated enzyme and intact cell systems. From earlier studies three classes of compounds emerged as potentially useful inhibitors of adenylyl cyclases. The first one is typified by β-l-2′,3′-dideoxyadenosine-5′-triphosphate (β-l-2′,3′-dd-5′-ATP; IC50 ∼24 nm (6Shoshani I. Boudou V. Pierra C. Gosselin G. Johnson R.A. J. Biol.

In this study, we observed that trichostatin A (TSA), a specific histone deacetylase inhibitor, could effectively inhibit the growth of v-Src-transformed (IV5) cells and abrogate their ability to form colonies in soft agar. Further analysis demonstrated that, although TSA reduced the expression of Eps8 in a dose- and time-dependent manner, both the protein expression and kinase activity of v-Src remained constant, and the abundance and phosphotyrosine levels of Src substrates, including cortactin, focal adhesion kinase, p130Cas, paxillin, and Shc, were not altered. Notably, removal of TSA from the medium restored not only the expression of Eps8, but also cellular growth. Northern and reverse transcription-PCR analyses revealed the significant reduction of eps8 transcripts in TSA-treated IV5 cells relative to control cells. When active Src-expressing chicken embryonic cells were forced to overexpress p97Eps8, they became resistant to TSA-mediated anti-proliferation. Furthermore, using small interference RNA of eps8, we demonstrated the requirement for Eps8 in IV5 cell proliferation. Thus, our results highlight a critical role for p97Eps8 in TSA-exerted growth inhibition of v-Src-transformed cells.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar, 4Brown C.E. Lechner T. Howe L. Workman J.L. Trends Biochem.

Adding acidic acetyl groups to lysine residues neutralizes the basic nature of histones and decreases their affinity for DNA. Therefore, the altered nucleosomal conformation increases the accessibility of transcriptional regulators to chromatin templates. Because histones are the major components in “chromatin remolding,” their acetylation may also affect other DNA-templated processes, including DNA replication, repair, recombination, and chromosome segregation (6Aalfs J.D.

Kobayashi M. Nagashima K. Wakisaka Y. Koizumi K. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1976; 29: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Later, it was characterized as a noncompetitive inhibitor of histone deacetylase (8Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). TSA can induce a variety of biological responses, including induction of differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis (8Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Although TSA reverses cellular transformation caused by sis, ras, and src oncogenes in vitro (9Sugita K. Koizumi K.

Coombes R.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 971-976PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its anti-carcinogenic effect, TSA also affects angiogenesis (13Kim M.S. Kwon H.J. Lee Y.M. Baek J.H. Jang J.E.

Eps8 is a substrate for both receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (15Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoska V. Castafnino P. Miki T. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3799-3808Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 16Gallo R. Provenzano C. Carbone R. Di Fiore P.P. Castellani L. Falcone G. Alema S.

Acta. 1999; 1450: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Two Eps8 isoforms (p97Eps8 and p68Eps8) can be recognized by anti-Eps8 antibody (15Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoska V. Castafnino P. Miki T. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3799-3808Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Although p68Eps8 has been speculated to be a proteolytic or an alternatively spliced product of p97Eps8, its exact coding sequences and function are still unclear. Aberrant overexpression of p97Eps8 in cells not only enhances mitogenic responsiveness to epidermal growth factor (18Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), but also causes cellular transformation (19Maa M.-C. Hsieh C.Y. Leu T.-H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Like various intracellular signal transducers, p97Eps8 contains several protein-protein interaction modules, including an SH3 domain, a putative nuclear targeting sequence, a split PH domain, a degenerated SH2 domain, and several proline-rich regions (15Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoska V. Castafnino P. Miki T. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3799-3808Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 20Wong W.T. Carlomagno F. Druck T. Barletta C. Croce C.M. Huebner K. Kraus M.H. Di Fiore P.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3057-3061PubMed Google Scholar). Through these domains, p97Eps8 has been reported to associate with a variety of signaling proteins such as Shc (21Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Salcini A.E. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3805-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), Shb (22Karlsson T. Songyang Z. Landgren E. Lavergne C. Di Fiore P.P. Snafi M. Pawson T. Cantley L.C. Claesson-Welsh L. Welsh M.

Piccoli C. Wong W.T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition, the split PH domain confers to p97Eps8 the ability to associate with the plasma membrane in response to serum stimulation, which is crucial for p97Eps8-induced transformation (19Maa M.-C. Hsieh C.Y. Leu T.-H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Recent accumulating evidence indicates that, by interacting with E3b1 and RN-tre, p97Eps8 is involved in the control of Rac and Rab5 signaling, respectively (25Scita G. Nordstrom J. Carbone R.

Scita G. Zeriai M. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Reflecting its crucial role in signal transduction, the amount of p97Eps8 is modulated by growth and differentiation (16Gallo R. Provenzano C. Carbone R. Di Fiore P.P. Castellani L. Falcone G. Alema S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1929-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate a strong correlation between TSA-mediated anti-carcinogenesis and the reduced expression of Eps8, which could be attributable to diminished eps8 transcript levels in v-Src-transformed cells. Remarkably, small interference RNA (siRNA) of eps8 significantly inhibited proliferation of v-Src-transformed cells, and ectopically expressed p97Eps8 imparted TSA resistance to cells expressing active Src. These results not only confirm p97Eps8 as an oncoprotein involved in v-Src-mediated transformation, but also reveal that its expression is TSA-sensitive. Cells and Lysate Preparation—The v-Src-expressing C3H10T1/2 (IV5) cells were a generous gift from Dr. Sarah J. Parsons (27Luttrell D.K. Kuttrell L.M. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Chicken embryonic (CE) cells expressing mock control, active Src (c-Src 518 amber mutation), and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) or p97Eps8 in the active Src background were generated as described previously (17Maa M.-C. Lai J.-R. Lin R.-W. Leu T.-H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Temperature-sensitive v-Src-expressing Rat-1 (R1/LA29) cells were kindly provided by Dr. Michael J. Weber (28Wasilenko W.J. Payne M. Fitzgerald D.L. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cells grown to near-confluence were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as described (29Maa M.-C. Leu T.-H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Materials—TSA was purchased from Sigma. Antibody against Eps8 was either homemade (C-Eps8) (17Maa M.-C. Lai J.-R. Lin R.-W. Leu T.-H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-FAK polyclonal antibody directed against the C-terminal region of FAK was described previously (30Leu T.-H. Maa M.-C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6992-7000Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Anti-Src (GD11) and anti-cortactin (4F11) antibodies were provided by Dr. Sarah J. Parsons. Antibodies recognizing p21WAF1/CIP1, histone H3, acetylated histone H3, and phospho-Tyr317 Shc were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lack Placid, NY), and antibodies against Shc, p130Cas, and paxillin were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody PY20 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. TSA Treatment and Cell Proliferation—IV5 and CE cells and CE cells expressing mock control, active Src, and FAK or p97Eps8 in the active Src background were incubated with or without various concentrations of TSA for different periods of time. Cells were washed, trypsinized, and counted using a hemocytometer. Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and in Vitro Kinase Reaction—Immunoprecipitation of cortactin, FAK, Shc, p130Cas, and paxillin was performed with their respective antibodies as described previously (31Maa M.-C. Wilson L.K. Moyers J.S. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2429-2438PubMed Google Scholar). For analysis of Tyr(P), cortactin, Eps8, FAK, Shc, phospho-Tyr317 Shc, p130Cas, paxillin and Src, Western immunoblotting was performed with their respective antibodies, and detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The v-Src immunocomplex kinase reaction was carried out as described previously (17Maa M.-C. Lai J.-R. Lin R.-W. Leu T.-H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Analysis of Histone Acetylation—IV5 cells that had been treated with or without TSA were suspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.5), 50 mm sodium bisulfite, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, and 8.6% sucrose) and lysed in a Dounce homogenizer. The nuclei were collected by centrifugation and suspended in water. Histones were extracted with 0.4 n H2SO4, and acid-soluble histones were precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid. Histones were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western blot analysis. Total and acetylated histones H3 were detected with their respective antibodies. Anchorage-independent Growth—Approximately 1500 cells were suspended in 0.5% agarose-containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum and various amounts of TSA and layered over an agarose plug on a 6-well plate. The agarose plug contained 1% agarose in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated for 2 weeks, during which time fresh medium and TSA were added to the plates every 3 days. Colonies composed of more than eight cells were counted after 14 days. Northern Analysis—Total cellular RNA was harvested by acidic phenol extraction (RNAtrap®, Protech) as suggested by the manufacturer and quantified using a spectrophotometer. RNA (20 μg) was loaded onto a 1% agarose gel cast in 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 5 mm NaOAc, and 1 mm EDTA containing 0.6% formaldehyde. RNA was transferred onto a nylon membrane by capillary blotting and fixed by UV cross-linking. The mouse eps8-containing full-length open reading frame or β-actin cDNA probes (prepared as described under “Reverse Transcription-PCR”) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. The blots were washed three times at room temperature for 10 min with 2× SSC and 1% SDS, twice at 60 °C for 20 min with 1× SSC and 0.1% SDS, and twice at room temperature for 10 min with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated as described above. Approximately 5 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into single-stranded cDNA in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 10 μl of 5× reaction buffer, 60 pmol of oligo(dT)15, 40 units of RNase inhibitor, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). The reaction was carried out at 42 °C for 1 h. Single-stranded cDNA products (1 μl) were then amplified by PCR. The PCR was carried out in a 50-μl mixture containing 5 μl of 10× reaction buffer, 0.2 mm dNTP, 0.2 μm forward and reverse primers for eps8 encoding p97Eps8, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase using an Applied Biosystems GeneAmp PCR System 2400. As an internal standard, a pair of primers for β-actin was included at the same time. The PCR was carried out according to the following program. The cDNA was denatured for 5 min at 94 °C and amplified for 30 cycles under optimal conditions: 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by a 5-min elongation step at 72 °C. Different numbers of cycles were tested to ensure linear phase amplification of the cDNA. The sequences of primer pairs used were as follows: p97Eps8, 5′-ATGAATGGTCATATGTCTAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTGTGTGACAGTCCCCGGTG-3′ (antisense); and β-actin, 5′-ATCATGTTTGAGACCTTCAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CATCTCCTGCTCGAAGTCTA-3′ (antisense). The PCR products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel and detected by ethidium bromide staining. Construction and Transfection of eps8 siRNA—To construct a plasmid expressing eps8 siRNA, two complementary eps8-containing oligonucleotides (sense strand, 5′-GATCCCGCAGCAGCTCCAGTGACAGTTTCAAGAGAACTGTCACTGGAGCTGCTGTTTTTTGGAAA-3′; and antisense strand, 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAACAGCAGCTCCAGTGACAGTTCTCTTGAAACTGTCACTGGAGCTGCTGCGG-3′) were synthesized, annealed, and ligated into the pSilencer hygro vector (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. To generate IV5 cells expressing eps8 siRNA or the nonspecific negative control, pSilencer-Eps8 or the negative control pSilencer hygro vector, respectively, was transfected into IV5 cells using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) following the method recommended by the manufacturer. These cells were then cloned by hygromycin (400 μg/ml) selection for ∼10 days. TSA Inhibits the Proliferation and Transformation of Cells Expressing v-Src—Previous studies have indicated that TSA can reverse transformed phenotypes caused by multiple oncogenes (9Sugita K. Koizumi K. Yoshida H. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 168-172PubMed Google Scholar, 10Futamura M. Monden Y. Okabe T. Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Yokoyama S. Nishimura S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1119-1123PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kwon H.J. Owa T. Hassig C.A. Shimada J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3356-3361Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In an attempt to study the influence of TSA on the cellular growth of v-Src-transformed (IV5) cells, various concentrations of TSA (0, 1, 10, and 100 ng/ml) were applied to IV5 cells for different periods of time, and their proliferation was assessed. As shown in Fig. 1A, whereas 1 ng/ml TSA exerted a slightly inhibitory effect, 10 ng/ml TSA significantly caused growth inhibition of IV5 cells after a 48-h exposure. When the TSA concentration reached 100 ng/ml, a complete block of cellular growth was detected. With respect to transformation, ∼2 ng/ml TSA could repress 50% colony formation of IV5 cells in soft agar (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that TSA is an effective growth and transformation inhibitor for cells expressing v-Src. TSA Induces Histone Acetylation in v-Src-transformed Cells—TSA is a well known histone deacetylase inhibitor that can augment histone acetylation. To confirm its effect in IV5 cells, cells were cultured with or without 100 ng/ml TSA for various periods of time, and the histones were isolated. Western blot analysis demonstrated that, prior to incubation with TSA (0 h), the levels of acetylated histone H3 in IV5 cells were low (Fig. 2). Incubation with TSA resulted in the accumulation of acetylated histone H3, the level of which then remained constant over a 36-h incubation period. Interestingly, unlike previously documented up-regulation (32Biggs J.R. Kudlow J.E. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 901-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 33Nakano K. Mizuno T. Sowa Y. Orita T. Yoshino T. Okuyama Y. Fujita T. Ohtani-Fujit N. Matsukawa Y. Tokino T. Yamagishi O. Nomura H. Sakai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22199-22206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), the level of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 was TSA-insensitive in IV5 cells (Fig. 2). TSA Treatment Does Not Affect v-Src Enzymatic Activity—As shown above, we have demonstrated that TSA can effectively inhibit v-Src-mediated transformation. Because v-Src is a tyrosine kinase and because its activity plays an important role in oncogenesis, we investigated the influence of various concentrations of TSA on the tyrosyl phosphorylation of proteins in IV5 cells after a 24-h treatment. As demonstrated in Fig. 3A, no significant alteration in the amounts of v-Src along with the Tyr(P) content of a number of cellular proteins occurred in TSA-exposed IV5 cells, suggesting that TSA did not alter v-Src expression and its kinase activity. To further confirm this point, an in vitro kinase assay using the Src immunoprecipitates from IV5 cells exposed to various concentrations of TSA was performed. According to Fig. 3B, TSA did not alter the activity of Src even when its concentration reached 200 ng/ml. Consistently, no significant changes in the Tyr(P) residues of Src potential substrates, including cortactin, FAK, p130Cas, paxillin, and phospho-Tyr317 Shc, were detected (Fig. 3C). These data show that the activity of v-Src remained constant in TSA-treated IV5 cells. Down-regulation of p97Eps8 in TSA-treated v-Src-transformed Cells—Because p97Eps8 was previously demonstrated to be an oncoprotein whose expression is enhanced in v-Src-transformed cells (17Maa M.-C. Lai J.-R. Lin R.-W. Leu T.-H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we were interested to know whether the TSA-induced antitumorigenic effects in IV5 cells are mediated through p97Eps8. To address this issue, the levels of p97Eps8 in IV5 cells incubated with or without various concentration of TSA for 24 h were analyzed. As demonstrated in the dose-response experiment (Fig. 4A), in agreement with growth inhibition by TSA, an obvious reduction of Eps8 (both p97Eps8 and p68Eps8) was detected in cells treated with 10 ng/ml TSA, whereas nearly complete abrogation of p97Eps8 was observed when the concentration of TSA reached 100 ng/ml. By contrast, the constant expression of the other Src substrates (i.e. cortactin, FAK, p130Cas, paxillin, and Shc) in response to TSA in IV5 cells, implying the down-regulation of Eps8 by TSA, was quite specific (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, TSA reduced the expression of Eps8 in a time-dependent manner; and after 12–24 h of exposure to 100 ng/ml TSA, Eps8 expression almost totally vanished (Fig. 4B). In addition to IV5 cells, this TSA-suppressed Eps8 expression was also observed in other C3H10T1/2-derived cell lines expressing v-Src (data not shown). Most important, similar phenomena could also be detected in R1/LA29 cells expressing temperature-sensitive v-Src (28Wasilenko W.J. Payne M. Fitzgerald D.L. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Whereas Eps8 could be induced by a temperature shift (39 to 35 °C) (28Wasilenko W.J. Payne M. Fitzgerald D.L. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), its down-regulation could be achieved by TSA treatment (Fig. 4C). In contrast, consistent with our previous finding, the expression of cortactin was TSA-insensitive (Fig. 4C). Removal of TSA Can Restore the Expression of p97Eps8 and Cellular Growth—Because TSA-inhibited cellular growth of v-Src-transformed cells coincided with the down-regulation of Eps8, we therefore speculated that TSA exerts its anti-mitogenic effect through Eps8 reduction. If this hypothesis were correct, TSA removal should restore Eps8 expression, which, in turn, results in resumption of v-Src-transformed cell proliferation. To prove this speculation, IV5 cells initially exposed to TSA (100 ng/ml) for 24 h were incubated with TSA-free medium. The growth curve and expression of Eps8 in these cells were then analyzed. As expected, TSA withdrawal resulted in the resumption of cellular growth as compared with its persistent presence (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, whereas a dramatic reduction of Eps8 was observed in 24-h TSA-treated cells, significantly increased Eps8 expression was detected in IV5 cells after 6-h TSA removal, and the longer the cells were incubated with TSA-free medium, the more Eps8 expression was restored (Fig. 5B). Concurrent with our previous finding that TSA did not modulate the expression of v-Src in IV5 cells, no appreciable alteration in v-Src expression after TSA removal was observed (Fig. 5B). Reduced eps8 Transcript Levels in TSA-treated v-Src-transformed Cells—Two eps8 transcripts (i.e. 4.7 and 3.8 kb) were reported previously (15Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoska V. Castafnino P. Miki T. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3799-3808Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Characterization of the N terminus of p97Eps8 (amino acids 1–175) disclosed its absence in p68Eps8 (17Maa M.-C. Lai J.-R. Lin R.-W. Leu T.-H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Analysis of its corresponding cDNA by Northern blotting revealed only the 4.7-kb transcript, which was believed to encode p97Eps8 (data not shown). Because TSA could down-regulate the expression of Eps8, we thereby wondered whether TSA could influence the abundance of eps8 transcripts. To answer this question, total RNAs extracted from control and TSA-treated IV5 cells were analyzed by Northern blotting. As demonstrated in Fig. 6A, the abundance of both 4.7- and 3.8-kb eps8 transcripts was significantly decreased in TSA-treated cells within 12 h. Further reverse transcription-PCR analysis utilizing specific primers for the 4.7-kb eps8 transcript revealed that TSA treatment led to a decrease in the expected 678-bp product (Fig. 6B). These results imply that TSA-mediated decreases in p97Eps8 expression could be partly attributable to the reduction of its corresponding eps8 transcript. Ectopically Expressed p97Eps8 Confers Resistance to TSA— The strong correlation between TSA-mediated growth arrest and TSA-reduced p97Eps8 expression in IV5 cells prompted us to investigate the involvement of p97Eps8 in TSA-mediated anti-carcinogenesis in cells expressing v-Src. To address this point, CE cells expressing barely detectable Eps8 levels were chosen as our model system (Ref. 17Maa M.-C. Lai J.-R. Lin R.-W. Leu T.-H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar and data not shown). CE cells ectopically expressing active Src or active Src along with p97Eps8 were incubated with or without TSA, and their mitogenesis in response to TSA was assessed. As demonstrated in Fig. 7A, whereas TSA (100 ng/ml) totally inhibited the cellular growth of active Src-expressing cells, overexpression of p97Eps8 almost completely reversed this inhibition. In comparison, overexpression of FAK did not alleviate this TSA-mediated growth arrest (Fig. 7B). These results indicate that p97Eps8 is indeed an important TSA target whose down-regulation contributes to the antitumorigenic activity of TSA in v-Src-transformed cells. Down-regulation of Eps8 Inhibits the Cellular Growth of v-Src-transformed Cells—The above results strongly suggested that Eps8 plays an essential role in IV5 cell proliferation. To substantiate this hypothesis, plasmids expressing nonspecific or eps8-specific siRNA were generated and introduced into IV5 cells. Whereas there was a >50% reduction of Eps8 expression (both 97- and 68-kDa proteins) in two selected IV5 cell lines constitutively expressing eps8 siRNA (i.e. siRNA-1 and siRNA-2), the expression of Eps8 was unchanged in those cell lines expressing nonspecific siRNA (i.e. Ctrl-1 and Ctrl-2) compared with parental IV5 cells (Fig. 8A). Concomitantly, the proliferation of these cells was examined. As shown in Fig. 8B, in comparison with IV5, Ctrl-1, and Ctrl-2 cells, the cellular growth of siRNA-1 and siRNA-2 cells was suppressed. This finding implies the requirement for Eps8 in IV5 cell proliferation. The level of histone acetylation is determined by equilibration between histone acetylase and histone deacetylase, which affects the dynamics of chromatin folding during gene transcription (34Emiliani S. Wolfgang F. Van Lint C. Al-Abed Y. Verdin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2795-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of histone deacetylase such as n-butyrate and TSA were found to cause accumulation of hyper-acetylated histone H4 within cells (35Hoshikawa Y. Kwon H.J. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). A variety of biological responses, including cell cycle progression, differentiation, and apoptosis, are affected by TSA. In this study, we have demonstrated that TSA can effectively cause growth inhibition of v-Src-transformed cells and concomitantly down-regulate the expression of p97Eps8. Interestingly, no alterations in the amounts and enzymatic activity of v-Src were detected in TSA-treated v-Src-transformed cells, and withdrawal of TSA restored both p97Eps8 expression and cellular growth. The increased TSA resistance of cells overexpressing p97Eps8 further confirmed the importance of diminished p97Eps8 expression in the antitumorigenic effect exerted by TSA. As an extension, inhibition of the mitogenesis of v-Src-transformed cells by eps8 siRNA further verified the requirement for Eps8 in IV5 cell proliferation. Inhibition of the c-src promoter and repression of c-src mRNA as well as protein expression by TSA have been reported (36Kostyniuk C.L. Dehm S.M. Batten D. Bonham K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6340-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This seems to be in conflict with our finding that TSA did not interfere with Src expression and its kinase activity in IV5 cells. However, these independent results are not contradictory. This is because the cells that we used were transfected with v-src cDNA, which is under the influence of the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat instead of the cognate c-src promoter that retains TSA-sensitive regions (27Luttrell D.K. Kuttrell L.M. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Given that TSA is a well documented histone deacetylase inhibitor and that we observed significant reduction of eps8 transcripts in TSA-treated IV5 cells, it is tempting to speculate that the TSA-mediated down-regulation of p97Eps8 is exerted at the transcriptional level because similar results were obtained when IV5 cells were exposed to butyrate, another well known histone deacetylase inhibitor (data not shown). Whereas acetylation of histone proteins might alter the chromatin structure and allow binding of transcription factors, acetylation of non-histone proteins such as transcription factors and components of the basal transcriptional machinery might affect their activity. Alternatively, acetylation of histone and non-histone proteins might create (or eliminate) a signal that is recognized by another factor(s). This is reminiscent of protein phosphorylation, which can either alter the conformation and function of a protein or provide the binding sites for effector molecules. These models may partially overlap and are not mutually exclusive. Nevertheless, we did not exclude the possibility that TSA treatment might decrease the stability of eps8 mRNA and its translation product. Although p97Eps8 has been verified as an oncoprotein, the biological significance of its augmented expression in v-Srctransformed cells (17Maa M.-C. Lai J.-R. Lin R.-W. Leu T.-H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 19Maa M.-C. Hsieh C.Y. Leu T.-H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) is still obscure. The suppression of IV5 cell proliferation by eps8 siRNA unveiled the importance of Eps8 in transmitting growth signals in v-Src-transformed cells. Our observation that active Src-expressing CE cells with ectopically expressed p97Eps8 resisted TSA-mediated anti-proliferation substantiates this notion. It is noteworthy that, for reasons unknown, we were unable to obtain high ectopic p97Eps8 expressers from IV5 cells that already had substantially high amounts of Eps8. Therefore, CE cells expressing barely detectable Eps8 levels (Fig. 7A and data not shown) were chosen as our alternative to study p97Eps8-conferred TSA resistance. Remarkably, unlike p97Eps8, CE cells ectopically expressing FAK in the background of active Src did not become TSA-resistant (Fig. 7B). This is consistent with unaltered FAK expression in TSA-treated IV5 cells (Fig. 4C) and implies the specificity of TSA action. Intriguingly, in addition to p97Eps8, the expression of p68Eps8 was also down-regulated in response to TSA, in essential agreement with the reduced abundance of eps8 transcripts observed in our Northern blot analysis (Fig. 6A). Because the identity and biological function of p68Eps8 are still unknown, the implication of its down-regulation in TSA-mediated growth arrest of v-Src-transformed cells is unclear at this moment. To date, TSA has been shown to modulate the expression of a spectrum of genes. It has been reported that, like p97Eps8, the down-regulation of Arp2 (actin-related protein-2), Arp3, and RhoA (37Rombouts K. Knittel T. Machesky L. Braet F. Wielant A. Hellemans K. De Bleser P.

Oh E.S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 826-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) correlates with impaired migration in hepatic stellate cells and reduced tumorigenic activity in colon carcinoma cells. In contrast, a variety of proteins can be up-regulated by TSA. The prominent examples include p21WAF1/CIP1 (32Biggs J.R. Kudlow J.E. Kraft A.S. J. Biol.

J. 1995; 310: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). p21WAF1/CIP1 is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase, and Stra13 is a transcriptional repressor of the c-myc gene. Thus, by up-regulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 and Stra13, TSA could cause cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition, respectively. However, we did not observe TSA-mediated p21WAF1/CIP1 induction in IV5 cells (Fig. 2). This discrepancy is likely due to the different cells studied in various systems. It is particularly noteworthy that eps8 is not among the TSA-responsive genes identified by microarrays (42Mariadason J.M. Corner G.A. Augenlicht L.H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4561-4572PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the role of eps8 in transformation and its sensitivity to TSA treatment, our findings might supplement and expand our understanding of the mechanisms by which TSA exerts its anti-proliferation in cancer cells.

https://openalex.org/W2118978432,"Tyrosinase (Ty) is a type 3 copper protein involved in the rate-limiting step of melanin synthesis. It is shown that the endogenous Trp fluorescence of tyrosinase from Streptomyces antibioticus is remarkably sensitive to the redox state. The fluorescence emission intensity of the [(Cu(I) Cu(I)] reduced species is more than twice that of the oxygen-bound [Cu(II)- O22--Cu(II)] form. The emission intensity of the oxidized [Cu(II)-OH–-Cu(II)] protein (Tymet) appears to be dependent on an acid-base equilibrium with a pKa value of 4.5 ± 0.1. The binding of fluoride was studied under pseudo first-order conditions using stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy. The kinetic parameters kon, Kd, and the fraction of fluorescence emission quenched upon fluoride binding show a similar pH dependence as above with an average pKa value of 4.62 ± 0.05. Both observations are related to the dissociation of Cu2-bridging hydroxide at low pH. It is further shown that Ty is rapidly inactivated at low pH and that halide protects the enzyme from this inactivation. All results support the hypothesis that halide displaces hydroxide as the Cu2-bridging ligand in Tymet. The relevance of the experimental findings for the catalytic cycle is discussed. The data are consistent with the data obtained from other techniques, validating the use of fluorescence quenching as a sensitive and effective tool in studying ligand binding and substrate conversion.

The details of the interaction of inhibitors with the dinuclear copper enzyme tyrosinase (Ty 1The abbreviations used are: Ty, tyrosinase; Hcs, hemocyanins; LMCT, ligand to metal charge transfer; l-DOPA, 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine; COs, catechol oxidases. ; EC 1.14.18.1) are still far from being completely understood. They are the subject of this report. Tyrosinases are involved in the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of melanin pigments, which fulfill various roles in living organisms. In mammals, melanins are responsible for skin, eye, inner ear, and hair pigmentation, and defects in Ty are related to a range of medical conditions like type I human oculocutaneous albinism (1Oetting W.S. King R.A. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1994; 103: S131-S136Google Scholar, 2Oetting W.S. Pigm. Cell Res. 2000; 13: 320-325Google Scholar). In fruits and mushrooms, melanin formation is responsible for the browning of tissue occurring after bruising or long storage time (3van Gelder C.W. Flurkey W.H. Wichers H.J. Phytochemistry. 1997; 45: 1309-1323Google Scholar), and in insects it is thought that melanins assist in wound healing and sclerotization of the cuticle (4Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2563-2605Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, the melanogenic pathway is complex and involves several enzymatic and non-enzymatic steps (5Sánchez-Ferrer A. Rodríguez-López J.N. García-Cánovas F. García-Cánovas F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 1-11Google Scholar). The pathway starts with the Ty-catalyzed hydroxylation and subsequent oxidation of l-tyrosine to l-DOPAquinone, which is then converted to DOPAchrome. DOPAchrome, in turn, is a precursor in the synthesis of polyphenolic melanin pigments. Although the Ty activity has been studied for over a century (see Refs. 3van Gelder C.W. Flurkey W.H. Wichers H.J. Phytochemistry. 1997; 45: 1309-1323Google Scholar, 4Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2563-2605Google Scholar, 5Sánchez-Ferrer A. Rodríguez-López J.N.

Dillinger R. Tuczek F. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2000; 39: 1587-1591Google Scholar for recent reviews), both the enzyme structure and its detailed mechanism of action remain to be solved. Tyrosinase contains a so-called type 3 copper site that is composed of two closely spaced copper ions, which are each coordinated by 3 histidine residues (4Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2563-2605Google Scholar, 8Bubacco L. Salgado J. Tepper A.W. Vijgenboom E. Canters G.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 215-220Google Scholar). The type 3 site also occurs in the hemocyanins (Hcs), which function as oxygen carriers and storage proteins in arthropods and molluscs, and in the plant catechol oxidases (COs), which oxidize diphenols to the corresponding quinones but lack the Ty hydroxylation activity. Although the type 3 proteins fulfill different functions, the dinuclear active site seems to be highly conserved as witnessed by its characteristic spectroscopic signatures and the available crystal structures for several Hcs (9Cuff M.E. Miller K.I. van Holde K.E. Hendrickson W.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 855-870Google Scholar, 10Hazes B. Magnus K.A. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Dauter Z. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G.J.

Eicken C. Sacchettini J.C. Krebs B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1084-1090Google Scholar). The differences in functionality are therefore thought to derive from variations in the accessibility of substrates to the active site or the ability of substrates to appropriately dock into the active center (7Decker H. Dillinger R. Tuczek F. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2000; 39: 1587-1591Google Scholar, 13Decker H. Tuczek F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 392-397Google Scholar, 14Gerdemann C. Eicken C. Krebs B. Acc. Chem. Res. 2002; 35: 183-191Google Scholar). The Ty type 3 site can exist in various forms as follows: (a) the [Cu(I) Cu(I)]-reduced Tyred species; and (b) the [Cu(II)- O22--Cu(II)] Tyoxy species, in which molecular oxygen is bound as peroxide in a μ-η2:η2 side bridging mode to the Cu2 center. The Tyoxy form, which results from the binding of molecular oxygen to Tyred, is competent to react with both monophenols and diphenols and is characterized by a strong ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT) band centered around 345 nm and a low O-O stretching vibration frequency of ∼750 cm–1 (4Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2563-2605Google Scholar). (c) The [Cu(II)-OH–-Cu(II)]-oxidized met form (Tymet) is competent to react with diphenols only. The Tymet form results when Tyoxy reacts with a diphenol to produce the corresponding quinone. Detailed knowledge of the interaction of Ty with its inhibitors is of paramount importance for understanding the Ty enzyme mechanism, as well as for the development of novel Ty inhibitors relevant to skin treatment and the economically important prevention of the browning of fruits, vegetables, and mushrooms, for example. Consequently, steady-state kinetic studies of Ty inhibition are abundant, and many inhibitors have been identified (e.g. Refs. 15Cabanes J. García-Carmona F. García-Canovas F. Iborra J.L.

Yokozawa T. Chung H.Y. Life Sci. 1999; 65: L241-L246Google Scholar). Yet direct spectroscopic investigations of inhibitor binding to tyrosinases have been few, partly because of the scarcity of suitable spectroscopic probes. For example, Tymet shows no strong UV-visible absorption bands and is EPR-silent due to the antiferromagnetic coupling between the two unpaired spins on the copper ions (4Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2563-2605Google Scholar). Spectroscopic studies mainly pertained to the half-oxidized species, in which one of the copper ions in the active site occurs in the Cu(II) and the other in the Cu(I) oxidation state (Tyhalf-met), rendering the site suitable for study by EPR techniques. Although EPR studies on Tyhalf-met have yielded much information regarding the coordination geometry of the oxidized copper and the changes that occur when ligands bind to the active site, the half-met form does not occur naturally and the technique allows for the investigation of only one of the copper ions in the type 3 site. It was a step forward recently when the oxidized Tymet derivative appeared amenable to paramagnetic NMR (8Bubacco L. Salgado J. Tepper A.W. Vijgenboom E. Canters G.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 215-220Google Scholar, 25Bubacco L. Vijgenboom E. Gobin C. Tepper A.W.J.W. Salgado J. Canters G.W. J. Mol. Catal. B Enzymatic. 2000; 8: 27-35Google Scholar, 26Tepper A.W.J.W. Bubacco L. Canters G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30436-30444Google Scholar); the S = 1 spin state of Tymet was found to be thermally accessible at room temperature, providing sufficient paramagnetism for the signals of the coordinating histidine protons to shift outside the diamagnetic envelope. The NMR studies demonstrated that also Ty contains a classical type 3 site in which, like in Hcs and COs, the two copper ions are coordinated by six histidine residues through their Nϵ atoms (8Bubacco L. Salgado J. Tepper A.W. Vijgenboom E. Canters G.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 215-220Google Scholar). Furthermore, large changes in the Tymet paramagnetic 1H NMR spectrum are observed when inhibitors bind to the active site (25Bubacco L. Vijgenboom E. Gobin C. Tepper A.W.J.W. Salgado J. Canters G.W. J. Mol. Catal. B Enzymatic. 2000; 8: 27-35Google Scholar, 26Tepper A.W.J.W. Bubacco L. Canters G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30436-30444Google Scholar), allowing us to follow ligand binding and to obtain structural information on the complexes. For instance, it was shown that halides interact with both the oxidized and reduced Ty, where the affinity for halide ion and the mechanism of inhibition depend both on the nature of the halide ion and the oxidation state of the type 3 site (26Tepper A.W.J.W. Bubacco L. Canters G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30436-30444Google Scholar) ( Kdred, I– < Br– < Cl– « F–; Kdmet, F– < Cl– < Br– « I–). The binding of halide to Tymet is strongly pH-dependent, i.e. halide only binds to the acidic form of the enzyme, resulting in stronger inhibition with decreasing pH. As a consequence of the instability of the enzyme at low pH and of the relatively long experimental times required, in the past we were able to estimate only an upper limit of 5.5 for the pKa of the process modulating the halide binding (26Tepper A.W.J.W. Bubacco L. Canters G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30436-30444Google Scholar). In the same study it was also proposed that halides bridge the two copper ions in the active site. Fluorescence studies on proteins, in which use is made of the emission of endogenous Tyr and Trp residues, have been widely performed to study protein structure and dynamics.

J. 1982; 205: 173-180Google Scholar) have been the subject of such investigations. Yet Hc or Ty protein fluorescence has never been used to study inhibitor binding. This report focuses on the fluorescence properties of the Ty from Streptomyces antibioticus as a function of pH and inhibitor binding. Fluoride was chosen (26Tepper A.W.J.W. Bubacco L. Canters G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30436-30444Google Scholar) as a model compound to study the transient-state kinetics of its binding to the Tymet enzyme, as well as its pH dependence. Stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy was used to obtain insight into the interaction of fluoride with Ty, as well as to validate the use of fluorescence quenching in studying ligand binding kinetics. The inactivation of Ty was studied at various pH values and under different conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the kinetics of inhibitor binding to oxidized tyrosinase. Protein Isolation and Purification—Tyrosinase was obtained from liquid cultures of S. antibioticus carrying the Ty pIJ703 overexpression plasmid (25Bubacco L. Vijgenboom E. Gobin C. Tepper A.W.J.W. Salgado J. Canters G.W. J. Mol. Catal. B Enzymatic. 2000; 8: 27-35Google Scholar). The enzyme was purified from the growth medium according to published procedures (25Bubacco L. Vijgenboom E. Gobin C. Tepper A.W.J.W. Salgado J. Canters G.W. J. Mol. Catal. B Enzymatic. 2000; 8: 27-35Google Scholar). The pure enzyme was obtained as a mixture of Tymet, Tyred, and Tyoxy, and the purity exceeded 95% in all cases as estimated by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were routinely determined optically using a value of 82 mm–1 cm–1 for the extinction coefficient at 280 nm (41Jackman M.P. Hajnal A. Lerch K. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 707-713Google Scholar). The protein was stored at –80 °C at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in 100 mm Pi buffer at pH 6.8 containing 20% glycerol as a cryoprotectant. Prior to further experiments, glycerol was removed from the storage buffer by dialysis at 4 °C against 100 mm Pi at pH 6.80. The reduced enzyme was prepared by reduction with hydroxylamine as described previously (26Tepper A.W.J.W. Bubacco L. Canters G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30436-30444Google Scholar) and used immediately. Optical Spectroscopy—Optical measurements were performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda 800 spectrometer. Steady-state fluorescence measurements were performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 50B fluorimeter. For recording the emission spectra, the freshly prepared enzyme was diluted in the measurement buffer immediately prior to the measurement. Anaerobic, air-saturated, or oxygen-saturated buffers were prepared by extensive bubbling with pure argon, air, or oxygen, respectively. The concentration of oxygen was assumed to be 0.27 mm for the air-saturated solutions at 20 °C and 1.32 mm for the oxygen-saturated solutions (42Dean J.A. Lange's Handbook of Chemistry. 15th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1999Google Scholar). For the oxygen titration experiments, small aliquots of oxygen-saturated buffer were introduced into the cuvette through an air-tight septum using a 10-μl Hamilton syringe. Kinetics—Stopped-flow experiments were performed using a computer-controlled Applied-Photophysics SX18MV stopped-flow system equipped with a PBP 05-109 Spectrakinetic monochromator. The system was temperature controlled at 21 °C using a Neslab RTE-111 circulation cryostat. Ty fluorescence was detected using a photomultiplier tube equipped with an optical cut-off filter of 320 nm supplied with the stopped-flow system, thus resulting in the detection of all emitted light above 320 nm. The enzyme was introduced into the reaction chamber from a stock solution kept at 4 °C. Fluoride binding traces were fitted to a single exponential decay function of the form Ft = F∞ + A·exp(–kobs·t), where Ft denotes the fluorescence at time t; F∞ is the fluorescence level at completion of the binding reaction; A is the signal amplitude, and kobs is the observed rate constant. The fitting was performed using the least squares fitting algorithm implemented in the stopped-flow software. The reported kinetic parameters kobs and A represent the average of at least four measurements. The standard errors were less than 10% in all cases. Because fluoride ion protonates at low pH-forming HF, effective free fluoride concentrations were calculated using a value of 3.14 for the pKa for the HF ↔ F– + H+ equilibrium (42Dean J.A. Lange's Handbook of Chemistry. 15th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1999Google Scholar). pH-dependent Inactivation of Ty—From previous studies (26Tepper A.W.J.W. Bubacco L. Canters G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30436-30444Google Scholar), it is known that the Ty from S. antibioticus is unstable at low pH. The closely related Ty from Streptomyces glaucescens (93% sequence identity with S. antibioticus Ty) is more stable in Tris·HCl buffer than in phosphate buffer, especially at the lower pH values (43Lerch K. Ettlinger L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 31: 427-437Google Scholar). To investigate the pH stability of S. antibioticus Ty, and its dependence on the presence of halide ion, we performed experiments at 21 °C where the protein in 5 mm Pi at pH 7.20 was pH-jumped by rapidly mixing with 200 mm phosphate buffer at the pH of interest in 1:1 volume ratio (end buffer concentration 102.5 mm Pi) using stopped-flow. The reported pH values were measured on the final mixed solutions. The mixture was allowed to incubate for a fixed amount of time after which the solution was rapidly mixed with a 5 mm solution of t-butylcatechol in 5 mm Pi at the pH of the experiment. After reaching the steady-state (t < ∼50 ms), linear product formation was observed. The steady-state velocity of formation of the stable reaction product t-butylquinone was optically measured at 410 nm for 1 s. Fig. 1 shows the normalized reaction rates versus incubation time under various conditions. The inactivation profiles obtained in the absence of halide (solid data points in Fig. 1) clearly show a pH-dependent inactivation of the protein. The data were fitted to a single exponential decay function yielding inactivation rate constants of 2.09, 0.43, and 0.16 min–1 at pH 3.63, pH 4.40, and pH 4.85, respectively. Curiously, little inactivation of the enzyme could be detected when 6 mm of either fluoride or chloride was present in the incubation and reaction mixtures at pH 4.40 (open symbols in Fig. 1). Here product formation was measured for 5 s to compensate for the inhibitory effect of halide. Apparently, the presence of halide significantly stabilizes the protein at low pH. Fluorescence Emission of Ty in Its Three Different Oxidation States—Fluorescence emission spectra of Tyred under anaerobic (Fig. 2A) and air-saturated (Fig. 2D) conditions at pH 6.80 and 21 °C are presented in Fig. 2. Whereas under anaerobic conditions only Tyred is present, under air-saturated conditions the protein exists as a mixture of 94% Tyoxy and 6% Tyred as calculated from KO2 and [O2] (see below and Fig. 3). Spectra of samples containing the resting form of the enzyme (predominantly Tymet) were recorded under anaerobic (Fig. 2B) and aerobic (Fig. 2C) conditions. All species display a similar line shape for the emission band with a maximum centered at 343 ± 2 nm and a half-width of 60 ± 2 nm. Little fine structure can be distinguished, and the absence of a shoulder at 300–310 nm with all species indicates that the emission is dominated by Trp fluorescence. The partial quenching of the fluorescence by oxygen (see Fig. 2) does not exhibit Stern-Volmer characteristics (in line with what may be expected on the basis of literature data (66Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer/Plenum, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 242Google Scholar)) but is the result of oxygen binding (see below). When bound oxygen is displaced from Tyoxy by incubation with bromide (26Tepper A.W.J.W. Bubacco L. Canters G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30436-30444Google Scholar), an increase in fluorescence is observed in which the magnitude parallels the decrease in the optical absorption at 345 nm typical of Tyoxy (data not shown). Therefore, it appears that the Ty fluorescence intensities depend on the oxidation state of the protein, the emission intensities of Tyred and Tyoxy differing by a factor of more than 2. The optical absorption spectra in the 250–300 nm region were identical for all three preparations (resting Ty, Tyred + Tyoxy, and Tyred; not shown).Fig. 3The binding of molecular oxygen to Tyred rendering Tyoxy, at pH 6.80 and 21 °C measured by following the changes occurring in the endogenous Ty fluorescence upon titrating an anaerobic solution of Tyred (0.5 μm) with a solution saturated with O2 ([O2] = 1.32 mm). The solid line represents the best fit to Equation 5 with Kd 16.5 ± 1.2 μm and fq(max) 0.59. The conditions are as follows: 100 mm Pi, λex 290 nm, and λem = 345 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The relative fluorescence intensity of the resting form of the enzyme (Fig. 2, B and C) depends on the presence of oxygen in the sample. This can be explained by considering that the resting form of the enzyme contains a percentage of Tyred and Tyoxy in addition to a predominant amount of Tymet (4Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2563-2605Google Scholar, 5Sánchez-Ferrer A. Rodríguez-López J.N. García-Cánovas F. García-Cánovas F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 1-11Google Scholar). Under anaerobic conditions only Tymet and Tyred are present, and the total fluorescence is given by Equation 1, F1=x·Fmet+(1-x)·Fred(Eq. 1) where F1 is the observed emission intensity; x is the fraction Tymet in the sample; Fmet is the normalized fluorescence intensity of Tymet; and Fred is the normalized fluorescence intensity of Tyred. When oxygen is present, an equilibrium between Tyred and Tyoxy is established, the ratio of the two species depending on the oxygen dissociation constant KO2 and [O2]. The total emission is then given by Equation 2, F2=x·Fmet+(1-x)·1-KO2[O2]+KO2·Foxy+(1-x)·KO2[O2]+KO2·Fred(Eq. 2) From the measured emission intensities at λmax and Equations 1 and 2, the fraction of Tymet as well as the relative Tymet emission intensity can be calculated according to the following Equations 3 and 4, x=(F1-F2)KO2+(F1-F2-Fred+Foxy)[O2](Foxy-Fred)[O2](Eq. 3) and Fmet=(FredF1-FredF2)KO2+(FoxyF1-FredF2)[O2](F1-F2KO2+(F1-F2-Fred+Foxy)[O2](Eq. 4) By using 0.27 mm for [O2], 16.5 μm for KO2 (see below and Fig. 3), 1 for Fred, 0.41 for Foxy (see below), and the measured intensities F1 and F2, amounting to 0.76 and 0.60, respectively, a value of 0.71 is obtained for the fraction Tymet in the sample (x) and a value of 0.66 for the fractional emission intensity Fmet relative to that of Tyred. In a resting Ty sample in air-saturated buffer at pH 6.80 and 21 °C, it is calculated that Tyoxy and Tyred contribute a fraction of 0.21 to the total fluorescence, whereas 0.79 of the emission originates from the Tymet species. We found the fraction of Tymet in our fresh preparations to be constant under the used experimental conditions. Oxygen Binding—We have studied the steady-state binding of molecular oxygen to Tyred, rendering Tyoxy, by following the changes occurring in the Ty Trp fluorescence as described above (λex 290 nm and λem 345 nm). For this, 3.0 ml of a freshly prepared anaerobic solution of 0.1 μm Tyred in 100 mm Pi at pH 6.80 was introduced in a sealed 3.5-ml quartz cuvette, after which this solution was titrated with microliter amounts of a 100 mm Pi buffer saturated with oxygen. The fluorescence emission intensity at 345 nm at given [O2] was measured using a 5-s instrument integration time. The resulting measured intensities, expressed as F/F0 versus [O2], are represented in Fig. 3. The data could be accurately fitted assuming the binding of a single oxygen using Equation 5, FF0=1-fq·[L][L]+Kd(Eq. 5) where F denotes the observed fluorescence intensity; F0 denotes the fluorescence intensity in the absence of ligand; [L] denotes the ligand concentration; Kd denotes the dissociation constant for ligand L; and fq denotes the fractional decrease in fluorescence upon complete saturation with the ligand, i.e. at [L] » Kdapp. Values of 16.5 ± 1.2 μm for the oxygen dissociation constant and of 0.59 for fq were obtained. The latter value means that the fluorescence intensity of the Tyoxy species amounts to 0.41 of the Tyred fluorescence intensity. The pH Dependence of Ty Fluorescence—Because we found that Ty is unstable at low pH (see Fig. 1), we measured the pH dependence of Ty fluorescence by pH jump stopped-flow at a time scale where the protein has not decayed to any measurable extent. For this, we rapidly mixed an ∼2 μm Ty solution in 1mm Pi at pH 7.20 with a 200 mm air-saturated Pi buffer at the pH of interest in a 1:1 volume ratio ([Ty] ∼1 μm; 3.8 < pH < 9.0). The fluorescence level was then measured for 0.25 s. The measurements were performed with three Ty preparations: resting Ty (71% Tymet, 27% Tyoxy, and 2% Tyred), reduced Ty (94% Tyoxy and 6% Tyred), and resting Ty in the presence of 100 mm fluoride. In the time period of the measurement, the fluorescence was stable. The actual pH values were measured on the mixed solutions. The obtained emission intensity data, expressed as the fractions of emission intensity relative to that of Tyred, are presented in Fig. 4. For the reduced sample containing Tyoxy and Tyred, there is no detectable pH dependence of the emission intensity. For the resting Ty sample, the emission intensity decreases at low pH. Because the emission of the reduced sample was not sensitive to the pH, the observed variation in emission must be due to changes in the contribution of Tymet. Accordingly, the experimental data were corrected for the contribution of Tyoxy and Tyred to the emission (0.21 of F0 at pH 6.80) and normalized using the calculated value of Fmet of 0.66 at pH 6.80. The corrected data are plotted in Fig. 4. The Tymet emission data can be interpreted by assuming that the fluorescence level is under control of a single acid/base equilibrium according to Equation 6, Fobs=FA·[H+]+FB·Ka[H+]+Ka(Eq. 6) where Fobs denotes the observed fluorescence level at given pH; FA denotes the fluorescence level of the acidic form of the protein, and FB the fluorescence level of the basic form of the protein. Fitting the data to Equation 6 yields a pKa value of 4.5 ± 0.1 and a value of 0.42 for FA, i.e. the relative fluorescence level of the acidic form of the enzyme relative to the fluorescence level of Tyred. Remarkably, the fluorescence level of resting Ty + fluoride is independent of the pH between pH 3.75 and pH 6.25. Here a [F–] of 100 mm was present in both the enzyme and the buffer solution. At this [F–], the Tymet enzyme can be considered to be fully saturated with F– at all pH values used in the experiment, whereas fluoride does not interact with Tyred and Tyoxy (see Ref. 26Tepper A.W.J.W.

Two transcripts have been identified in humans (GenBank™ accession numbers AF332192 and AB044245) and one in mice (AK016791), but the mouse transcript fails to encode the RFX-specific DNA-binding domain. This suggests the presence of another RFX4 transcript in mice containing the DBD. Neither target genes nor the physiological role of RFX4 are known, but abundant expression in the testis and some expression in the brain have been shown in humans (11Morotomi-Yano K. Yano K.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5962-5966Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 24Klein D.C. Moore R.Y. Reppert S.M. Suprachiasmatic Nucleus: The Mind's Clock. Oxford University Press, New York1991Google Scholar). Interestingly, the mouse RFX4 transcript was localized to the SCN. Mice and Tissues—Male mice (C57BL/6 strain) purchased from Japan SLC, Inc. (Hamamatsu, Japan) were trained in light/dark (LD) cycles (12L:12D) for at least 10 days before being transferred to constant darkness (DD). On the 4th day under DD, the cortex and SCN were isolated by micropunching. For gene expression analysis in response to light exposure, the mice were exposed to light at circadian time (CT)14 and sacrificed 20 or 45 min later. For further RFX4 induction studies, mice exposed to light at CT6, -14, or -22 were sacrificed 45 min later. The light exposure intensity was 200 lux. Control mice were sacrificed at the same CT time points but without light exposure. To determine whether the gene expression was rhythmic, the animals were sacrificed at CT2, -6, -10, -14, -18, and -22. Then, the SCN and cortex tissues were perforated using a puncher with a 400-μm inner diameter. SCN tissues were obtained from the anterior section, and the cortical tissues were obtained near the most dorsal area from the next caudal section. The pineal gland and retina were prepared as described elsewhere (25Wiechmann A.F. J. Pineal. Res. 2002; 33: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). RNA Preparation, cDNA Synthesis and Sequencing—Total RNA was prepared from the SCN, cortex, and testis with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and then treated with DNase-I (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA was synthesized with an oligo-(dT)18 primer using the SuperScript II First-Strand Synthesis System according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR was performed in a 25-μl reaction, which included 2.5 units of KOD DNA polymerase (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan). The primers were F1 (5′-TCC ACT AGT TCT TTC TTT TCC CCT TTT ATC-3′), R1 (5′-TTA TTT GAG TGT GAA ACC ATC CAT ATC TTG-3′), F2 (5′-ACT TTC TGG TAA CTA CAT CGG CTG AAA AT-3′), and R2 (5′-CTA GAC CAG GGA CAG AAA TTC ACG TTC TC-3′). The PCR conditions were 96 °C for 4 min followed by 35 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 10 s, and 74 °C for 1.5 min. The RT-PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced. To prevent any misreading due to nucleotide misincorporation by the DNA polymerase, RT-PCR was conducted independently three times. For DNA sequencing, three clones were picked from the PCR products obtained from all three independent amplifications. We aligned these 9 sequences, determined the sequence of mNYD-sp10 and bRfx4, and registered the sequences in DDBJ with accession numbers AB089184 and AB086957, respectively. Messenger RNA Quantification—The amount of mouse RFX4 mRNA was measured by real-time PCR using SYBR-Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with the ABI PRISM 7700 (Applied Biosystems) (26Karsai A. Muller S. Platz S. Hauser M.T. BioTechniques. 2002; 32 (794–796): 790-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The amount of mRNA was determined through normalization with the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) mRNA signal. The primers were mouse RFX4 (forward, 5′-GGC ATA GCG GTG AAG GAG AG-3′; reverse, 5′-AAA GTC TGG CAG CAA TGT CC-3′), mPer2 (forward, 5′-GGT CGA CAT TAG ACG GTG CT-3′; reverse, 5′-CCC CCA AAT TCC GTA TTT CT-3′) and GAPDH (forward, 5′-GAG GCC GGT GCT GAG TAT GTC GT-3′; reverse, 5′-GGT GGT GCA GGA TGC ATT GCT G-3′). Pre-heating was performed at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 50 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s and 78 °C for 40 s. Five mice were used for the real-time PCR analysis for each sample point, and the analysis was performed twice. In Situ Hybridization—Two mice were used for the in situ hybridization analysis at each sample point. Whole brain tissue was fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline solution for 24 h followed by immersion in a 20% sucrose/phosphate-buffered saline solution for 24 h. Then, the brains were sliced into 30-μm sections with a Cryostat (Leica, Nussloch, Germany). To prepare the probes for analysis, bRfx4-specific regions were amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into pGEM-T Easy (see Fig. 5C). After DNA sequence confirmation, this fragment was utilized as a probe. The primers employed were the following: forward, 5′-ATT ACT GAG TGT CCC CTC GC-3′; reverse, 5′-GGG TTC CTC CAG TAA CCC AC-3′ (see Fig. 5C). Radiolabeled probes were synthesized using [α-33P]UTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with the manufacturer’s protocols for cRNA synthesis. Hybridization was performed as described by Tei et al. (27Tei H. Okamura H. Shigeyoshi Y. Fukuhara C. Ozawa R. Hirose M. Sakaki Y. Nature. 1997; 389: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). The hybridized sections were exposed to BioMax film (Kodak, Rochester, NY). To determine the quantitative number of the transcripts, the optical densities of the SCN from six sections from the rostral to caudal ends were quantified with an Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad). The intensities of the six sections were summed after conversion into the relative optical densities produced by the 14C-acrylic standards (Amersham Biosciences). Data were normalized with respect to the difference between signal intensities in equal areas of the SCN and the corpus callosum. Preparation of Antibodies and Western Blot Analysis—To prepare polyclonal anti-RFX4 antibodies, rabbits were immunized with synthetic peptides (amino acids 41–60, NDENEEKENNRASKPHSTPA) (see Fig. 5C). Immunization and preparation of antiserum were performed by KITAYAMA LABES, Ina, Japan. We named the polyclonal antibody anti-bRFX4-2. To verify the antibody specificity, two COS7 transfectants were made with either the mouse bRfx4 or FLAG-tagged mouse bRfx4 constructs. Full-length mouse bRfx4 cDNA was obtained by the PCR with primers forward 278 (5′-ATG CAT TGT GGG TTA CTG GAG-3′) and reverse 2,485 (5′-TCA CTT AGC CCA TCC AGT G-3′) using total RNA isolated from the SCN and cloned into the pME18S expression vector. For the FLAG-tagged mouse bRfx4 construct, the pCMV-Tag2 vector was used (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Both constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The SCN and testis were prepared from male mice (C57BL/6), and their extracts were obtained as described previously (28Zhou S. Tannery N.H. Yang J. Puszkin S. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12655-12662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extracts of the COS7 cells transfected with bRfx4 or FLAG-tagged bRfx4 were also prepared and used for a control. These extracts were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to an Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were reacted with an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or rabbit anti-RFX4 polyclonal antibodies followed by anti-mouse IgG (Dakocytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) or anti-rabbit IgG (Dakocytomation) treatment. Signal detection was performed with SuperSignal West Dura extended duration substrate reagent (Pierce), and quantitation was performed with a LightCapture (AE-6960, ATTO Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Immunoprecipitation was performed according to the method described by Morotomi-Yano et al. (11Morotomi-Yano K. Yano K. Saito H. Sun Z. Iwama A. Miki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 836-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The lysis buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 1% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mm EDTA, 500 mm KCl, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Histochemical Staining—Histochemical staining was performed as described previously (29Baqui M.M. Gereben B. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Bianco A.C.

The FLAG-bRfx4 construct was transfected into COS7 cells with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in the chamber slide. 22 h later, staining was performed using M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (1:500, Sigma). A Novel Form of Mouse RFX4 Transcript Is Expressed in the SCN—Recently, the full-length human RFX4 (hereafter referred to as hRFX4) cDNA was isolated, and the interaction of its product with other RFX products was demonstrated. Nonetheless, its physiological function remains unknown. Gene expression analysis of hRFX4 showed that its expression is restricted to the testis (11Morotomi-Yano K. Yano K. Saito H. Sun Z. Iwama A.

In mice, the RFX4 (AK016791) transcript was identified in the testis, but it lacks the RFX-specific DBD (30Kawai J. Shinagawa A. Shibata K. Yoshino M. Itoh M. Ishii Y. Arakawa T. Hara A. Fukunishi Y.

Nature. 2001; 409: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). RFX4 expression was examined in several tissues in mice, and its expression was found in the testis, brain, heart, and ovary with expression ratios of 1, 1/36, 1/100, and 1/200, respectively. We failed to detect its expression in other tissues such as kidney, spleen, thymus, liver, muscle, lung, and uterus. These results are consistent with the publicly expressed sequence tag (EST) information. In this study, we focused on the transcript expressed in the brain. Further analyses using the SCN and cortex tissues revealed significant expression in the SCN, which serves as a biorhythm center (Fig. 1). Two types of alternatively spliced products of RFX4, NYD-sp10 and hRFX4, have been isolated in humans. The hRFX4 product has the DBD motif, which is a characteristic of the RFX transcription factor family (11Morotomi-Yano K. Yano K. Saito H. Sun Z. Iwama A. Miki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 836-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). NYD-sp10 lacks this domain. In mice, one transcript, AK016791, has been identified, but it lacks the DBD motif (11Morotomi-Yano K. Yano K. Saito H. Sun Z. Iwama A. Miki Y. J. Biol.

To date, these findings suggest the existence of a second RFX4 transcript in mice, which encodes an RFX4 homologue containing the DBD motif. A BLAST search (31Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71457) Google Scholar) for NYD-sp10, hRFX4, and AK016791 in the Uni-Gene collection of mouse ESTs (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Uni-Gene/Mm.Home.html) found a cluster (Mm. 32654, build 111) containing 35 3′-ESTs and 15 5′-ESTs. All of the 3′-ESTs and 10 of the 5′-ESTs were identical to the corresponding regions of the NYD-sp10 transcript. The other five 5′-ESTs were all isolated from neural tissues. None of the sequences in this cluster were homologous to hRFX4 or AK016791. PCR using total RNA purified from the mouse brain with primers designed in the 5′-ESTs and 3′-ESTs that were registered in Mm. 32654 generated a 3.7-kbp fragment. Sequencing this fragment revealed that the transcript was different from the previously reported transcripts. The novel transcript, which we refer to as brain-specific RFX4 (bRfx4), encodes a peptide consisting of 735 amino acid residues containing the B, C, DIM, and DBD domains (Fig. 2). This is the first reported mouse RFX4, which contains the DBD motif. We also obtained a mouse orthologue of NYD-sp10, mNYD-sp10, using primers F2 and R1, which were designed using the NYD-sp10 5′-untranslated regions and 3′-untranslated regions from the mouse genome (Gen-Bank™ accession number NW_000030) (Fig. 3, A and B, lane F2 + R1 in the testis). A search for bRfx4 in the public genome sequence data base revealed that the 5′-ESTs had been transcribed from novel exons upstream of the first exon of the mNYD-sp10 transcript (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3The mouse RFX4 novel transcript is expressed in the SCN.

To confirm this, the expression of these mouse RFX4 transcripts was compared in the SCN and the testis using several primers specific for each transcript. We found that bRfx4 is expressed in the SCN, but mNYD-sp10 and AK016791 are only expressed in the testis (Fig. 3). In situ hybridization was also performed with testis sections using a bRfx4-specific probe (Fig. 5C) but failed to detect any signal (data not shown). As mentioned above, we also searched for a mouse hRFX4 orthologue, but we did not find any ESTs in the public data base. Induction of the bRfx4 Transcript by Light Exposure— Though the disruption of the RFX5 gene causes immunodeficiency in mice (12Reith W. Satola S. Sanchez C.H. Amaldi I. Lisowska-Grospierre B.

Hochstrasser D.F. Mach B. Reith W. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), the physiological roles of the other RFX genes in mammals are unknown. The abundant expression of mouse RFX4 in the SCN may indicate that bRfx4 function is related to the circadian clock, because the SCN is the central clock locus for circadian rhythm. After real-time PCR, in situ hybridization was performed using brain sections, and strong signals were found in the SCN with three different probes prepared from the bRfx4 transcript. We also found significant but weak signals in the nucleus accumbens of the cerebellar cortex (data not shown). The circadian rhythm generated in the SCN is transferred to most of the peripheral tissues in the body. Although peripheral tissues also have their own oscillator, they are thought to be governed by the central clock in the SCN. The circadian gene-related phenotypes were examined in bRfx4 expression. One of these phenotypes is an induction of gene expression by light exposure in a subjective night-specific manner. To date, several such genes have been identified in the SCN (32Kornhauser J.M.

Another characteristic observed in some of the circadian genes is their rhythmic expression throughout an entire day (41Takahashi J.S. Curr. Opin.

The expression change of mouse bRfx4 was analyzed as a result of light exposure in the SCN using real-time PCR. We detected a slight and an ∼2.5-fold induction at 20 and 45 min after light exposure, respectively (Fig. 4A). No induction was observed in the cortex, pineal gland, and retina (Fig. 4A). Three additional bRfx4 primer sets were utilized, and similar results were obtained (data not shown). Next, to test whether bRfx4 induction is subjective night-specific, its expression was measured in the SCN at CT6 (subjective day), CT14 (early subjective night), and CT22 (late subjective night) after light exposure. Whereas significant induction was detected at CT14 and CT22, little induction was observed at CT6 (Fig. 4B). No induction was detected in the cortex at any of the three CT points (Fig. 4B). To determine whether the expression of the gene is rhythmic, gene expression was measured over a period of 1 day at 4-h intervals, CT2, -6, -10, -16, and -22. We did not detect any significant rhythmic expression in the SCN (Fig. 4C). mPer2 expression was also measured, and clear rhythmic expression was detected, confirming the assay reliability (Fig. 4C). In situ hybridization was performed, and a clear induction of gene expression was detected in the SCN 45 min after light exposure at CT22 (Fig. 5, A and B). To confirm this, three different probes prepared from bRfx4 cDNA were utilized, each of which obtained similar results. Results using the bRfx4-specific probe are shown. Induction of gene expression was detected in all SCN sections: rostral, central, and caudal (Fig. 5A). The sum of the intensities from all six SCN sections covering the entire SCN region is shown in Fig. 5B. It has been suggested that circadian clock entrainment is regulated at the gene expression level (22Florez J.C. Takahashi J.S. Ann. Med. 1995; 27: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).

The expression of novel RFX4 is clearly localized in the SCN, and its induction occurs only during subjective night. Several light-induced genes have been identified in the SCN, and a significant number of them have the cyclic AMP-response element sequence, which functions as a cis-controlling element for light induction, in the upstream region of their initiation codon (47Ginty D.D.

Bioinformatic analysis revealed the presence of the cyclic AMP-response element sequence at –6,807 and –11,500 of the mouse RFX4 gene. Both sequences are conserved between mice and humans (Fig. 3A). This fact is consistent with the bRfx4 induction in response to light exposure. We also searched for the X-box sequence (GTNRCCNNR-GYAAC) (5Gajiwala K.S. Chen H. Cornille F. Roques B.P. Reith W.

However, no X-box exists in human PER1 and PER3 genes, suggesting that these genes are not RFX4 targets. To obtain evidence for the presence of gene products in the SCN, antibodies for mouse bRfx4 were generated using a synthetic peptide. On the other hand, full-length bRfx4 cDNA was cloned, and a FLAG-tagged bRfx4 gene was prepared and introduced into an expression vector. COS7 transfectants with these constructs were used for antibody verification. The anti-bRfx4 antibody detected a band at ∼80 kDa, which has the same estimated molecular weight in both COS7 transfectants with bRfx4 or FLAG-bRfx4. The band detected in the FLAG-tagged bRfx4 transfectant was also detected by the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. Furthermore, the products immunoprecipitated by the anti-FLAG antibody were detected by the antibody to RFX4 and vice versa (data not shown). These results demonstrated an availability of antibodies and also indicated that the identified bRfx4 encodes an 80-kDa polypeptide in COS7 transfected cells. Interestingly, the band was comprised of four bands with small molecular mass differences, all of which were also detected by the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 6A). Different phosphorylation patterns might explain the multiple bands. Using the antibodies, the SCN and testis were examined. A signal was detected at ∼80 kDa in the SCN but not in the testis (Fig. 6A). In addition, we examined localization of bRFX4 using the COS7 cells, in which the FLAG-bRfx4 construct was introduced, and detected signals only in the nucleus (Fig. 6B). The results reported in this study suggested that the product encoded by the novel RFX4 transcript plays a role in the entrainment mechanism. Since this manuscript was submitted, a paper has appeared (49Blackshear P.J. Graves J.P. Stumpo D.J. Cobos I. Rubenstein J.L. Zeldin D.C.

They could not find any transcripts of bRFX-4 in the brain of the transgenic mice.

We have utilized the receptor-associated protein (RAP), a universal inhibitor of high affinity ligand binding to LRP, to evaluate the participation of LRP in the endocytosis of HL and lipoprotein lipase (LPL). We isolated a total endosome fraction from rat livers after a 30-min infusion of recombinant RAP, administered as a glutathione S-transferase conjugate (GST-RAP). GST-RAP infusion had no effect on the concentration of HL in liver homogenates, but its concentration in blood plasma increased progressively by 20%, and enrichment over homogenate of HL in endosomes was reduced by 50% as compared with infusion of GST alone. The concentrations of LPL in liver and plasma were 1.4 and 0.5%, respectively, those of HL, but endosomal enrichment of the two enzymes was similar (∼10-fold). GST-RAP infusion had no effect on the concentration of LPL in liver but increased its concentration in blood plasma by 250% and reduced its endosomal enrichment by 95% or greater. GST-RAP infusion also reduced endosomal enrichment of LRP by 40%, but enrichment of several other endocytic receptors was unaffected. Endosomal enrichment of several membrane trafficking proteins associated with the endocytic pathway in hepatocytes was unaffected by GST-RAP with the exception of early endosome endosome antigen 1, which was reduced by 85%. We conclude that HL is partially and LPL almost exclusively taken up into rat hepatocytes after binding to the endocytic receptor LRP.

Investig. 1998; 101: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that remodeling of chylomicron remnant lipids by HL facilitates receptor binding via apoE (9Brasaemle D.L. Cornely-Moss K. Bensadoun A. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 455-465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), leading to efficient endocytosis via coated pits. In the absence of apoE, HL may provide a less efficient pathway for removal of remnant lipoproteins containing apoB-48 (10Bergeron N. Kotite L. Vergés M. Blanche P. Hamilton R.L. Krauss R.M.

In human hepatoma cells, fibroblasts, and Chinese hamster ovary cells, internalization and degradation of HL bound to HSPGs are mediated mainly by LRP (11Kounnas M.Z. Chappell D.A. Wong H.

Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12893-12898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its internalization and degradation by human fibroblasts are dependent upon LRP (14Chappell D.A.

Initial binding of LPL to HSPGs is necessary for degradation (14Chappell D.A. Fry G.L. Waknitz M.A. Iverius P.-H. Williams S.E. Strickland D.K. J. Biol.

Brady S.E. Havel R.J. Circulation. 1988; 28: II-145Google Scholar) that HL is concentrated in hepatocytic endosomes from rat liver, and we report here evidence that LRP contributes in vivo to the endocytosis of HL destined for lysosomal degradation. We also report evidence that lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which is removed from the blood mainly by the rat liver (17Peterson J. Olivecrona T. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 4: 262-270Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar), is taken up into rat hepatocytes exclusively by this endocytic receptor. Reagents and Antibodies—α2-Macroglobulin (α2MG) (Sigma) was activated with methylamine and radioiodinated (125I) as described (18Mokuno H. Brady S. Kotite L. Herz J. Havel R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13238-13243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP) was encoded as a bacterial glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein in the plasmid pGEX-DGRAP and prepared as described (19Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly encoded GST alone was used as a control. Rabbit polyclonal anti-LRP was raised against the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the human protein (20Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-LDL receptor (IgG 4A4) was raised against the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the human receptor (21van Driel I.R. Goldstein J.L. Sudhof T.C. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Ashwell G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12685-12690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The following antisera against human proteins were generously provided: polymeric immunoglobulin receptor SC166 (J.-P. Kraehenbuhl, ISREC, Lausanne, Switzerland); transferrin receptor H68.4 (I. Trowbridge, Salk Institute, San Diego); cellubrevin (R. Jahn, Yale University, New Haven, CT); endobrevin (W. Hong, Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Singapore); and Rab11 121 (R. Parton, University of Queensland, Australia). Other antibodies were purchased commercially as follows: epidermal growth factor receptor 1005, sc-03 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); Rab5 44-332 (QCB Inc., Hopkinton, MA); early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) E41120 and Golgi matrix protein of 130-kDa (GM130) clone 35, G65120-050 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Isolation of Endosomes—Initial experiments to evaluate the presence and distribution of HL in endosomes were carried out in male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with 17-α-ethinyl estradiol, which highly induces LDL receptors in hepatocytes. In these rats, three highly purified endosome fractions, early endosomes, late endosomes (multivesicular bodies), and a receptor-recycling compartment (RRC), can readily be isolated (23Belcher J.D. Hamilton R.L. Brady S.E. Hornick C.A. Jaeckle S. Schneider W.J. Havel R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6785-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The volume and mass of the multivesicular body fraction characteristically increases 15 min after injection of human LDL. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 300–350 g and treated with estradiol for 5 days as described (23Belcher J.D. Hamilton R.L. Brady S.E. Hornick C.A. Jaeckle S. Schneider W.J. Havel R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6785-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), were fasted overnight and then anesthetized with Isoflurane (Schering-Plough Animal Health Corp.). Before or 15 min after injection of LDL (1.0–1.5 mg of protein) through an exposed femoral vein, livers were exposed with an abdominal incision. The portal vein was then cannulated. The vena cava was opened below the liver, and the liver was flushed through the portal vein with up to 100 ml of ice-cold 0.15 m NaCl containing 0.1% EDTA. The liver was weighed, and three endosome fractions were prepared exactly as described (23Belcher J.D. Hamilton R.L. Brady S.E. Hornick C.A. Jaeckle S. Schneider W.J. Havel R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6785-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Their purity was assessed by negative staining electron microscopy (24Hornick C.A. Hamilton R.L. Spaziani E. Enders G.H. Havel R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1558-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of administering RAP upon the endocytosis of HL and LPL, we used untreated male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 230–270 g, from which we isolated a total endosome fraction from liver homogenates. Rats fasted overnight were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (75–95 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg), administered intraperitoneally in a volume of ∼0.3 ml 0.15 m NaCl. Additional anesthetic was given as needed to maintain light anesthesia. A midline incision was made over the trachea, and a carotid artery was exposed, cannulated with PE-60 polyethylene tubing advanced ∼1 cm caudad through a small incision, and tied in place. The incision was closed with surgical clips. GST-RAP or GST was injected into the carotid artery as a pulse of 1 ml followed by a constant infusion with a pump at a rate of 4 ml/h. The least amount of GST-RAP required to prevent the hepatic uptake of radioiodinated α2MG over a period of 30 min, determined as described below, was utilized. Control animals received an equimolar amount of GST. Blood samples of 50–100 μl were obtained from the orbital plexus 1 and 15 min after starting the infusions and placed in tubes containing EDTA (final concentration ∼0.2%). At 27 min, the liver was exposed through an abdominal incision, and the portal vein was cannulated with PE-50 polyethylene tubing and tied in place. At 30 min, a final blood sample was obtained from the inferior vena cava, following which the vena cava was opened and the liver flushed as described above. The chest was then opened to ensure cessation of breathing. Livers were removed, weighed, and immediately placed in ice-cold 0.15 m NaCl. Routinely, four rats were studied in a given day, receiving GST-RAP and GST alternately, and two livers were used from each group to isolate endosomes. Livers were homogenized within 2 h of harvesting. The initial stages of endosome isolation from homogenates were identical to those used for estradiol-treated rats. At the final step, however, only two rather than four sucrose solutions were used, with densities of 1.033 and 1.13 g/ml, to create a discontinuous gradient with a single interface at which a single “total” endosome fraction accumulated after centrifugation in a Beckman SW 41 rotor at 197,500 gav for 90 min. This procedure yielded sufficient material (1.0–1.5 mg of endosomal protein) for all of the analyses described below. Negative stains confirmed that this fraction was composed of structures resembling early, late, and receptor-recycling endosomes, with no apparent differences between rats given GST-RAP or GST. Selection of Dose of GST-RAP—Untreated rats, anesthetized as described above and with cannulated carotid arteries, were injected with various amounts of GST-RAP, administered as a pulse followed by a constant infusion. Immediately after the pulse, the rats received 50 μg (2.5–5 × 107 cpm) of 125I-labeled, activated α2MG in a volume of 0.5–1 ml, injected into an exposed femoral vein. Blood samples of 50–100 μl were obtained at 1, 5, 10, and 20 min later from the orbital plexus and at 30 min from the exposed inferior vena cava, followed by flushing the liver and opening the chest as described above. The liver was removed and weighed, and a small portion was taken for assay of 125I. Analyses—Protein was quantified (25Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7065) Google Scholar) in liver fractions (homogenate and endosomes). Total cholesterol (26Allain C.C. Poon L.S. Chan C.S. Richmond W. Fu P.C. Clin. Chem. 1974; 20: 470-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (7242) Google Scholar) and triglycerides (27Bucolo G. David H. Clin. Chem. 1973; 19: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar) were quantified in plasma (mg/dl) and liver fractions (mg/mg protein). Rat HL (28Cisar L.A. Bensadoun A. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 380-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and LPL (29van Vlijmen B.J. Rohlmann A. Page S.T. Bensadoun A. Bos I.S. van Berkel T.J.C. Havekes L.M. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35219-35226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) masses were estimated by specific ELISAs in plasma (ng/ml) and liver fractions (ng/mg protein). In estradiol-treated rats, HL activity against an emulsified triglyceride substrate was also assayed in homogenate and endosome fractions (30Belcher J.D. Sisson P.J. Waite M. Biochem. J. 1985; 229: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Values for these enzymes in endosomes are expressed as fold enrichment over homogenate. Enzyme masses in total plasma were calculated for a plasma volume of 4.5% of body weight and compared with corresponding values for total liver (ng/mg protein × total liver protein). Proteins in liver fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting as described (31Enrich C. Jäckle S. Havel R.J. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 226-232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Components were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Band intensities were quantified with the IPlab Gel program (Signal Analytics Corp., Vienna, VA) and expressed as volume units/mg of protein. All estimates of enrichment in endosomes/homogenate were from the same exposure of a given gel. Statistical Analysis—The number of experiments is indicated in the legend of each figure and table (n). Student’s paired t test was used to estimate the significance of difference between experimental and control conditions. HL Is Enriched in a Characteristic Pattern in Hepatocytic Endosomal Fractions—In rat liver, ligands taken up from the blood by high affinity receptors rapidly enter endosomal compartments in hepatocytes (32Havel R.J. Hamilton R.L. Hepatology. 1988; 8: 1689-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Little HL circulates in the blood of rats, and most is present in the extracellular space of the liver (space of Disse), presumably bound to proteoglycans (3Shafi S. Brady S.E. Bensadoun A. Havel R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 709-720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Schoonderwoerd K. Verhoeven A.J. Jansen H. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We found, however, that this protein, evaluated by its activity against triglyceride substrate and mass (estimated immunochemically), was enriched in three endosome fractions from estradiol-treated rats in a distinctive pattern: highest in multivesicular bodies (late endosomes), intermediate in early endosomes, and lowest in receptor-recycling endosomes (Table I). This pattern is characteristic of ligands and receptors destined for lysosomal degradation in hepatocytes, and the opposite of that was observed for receptors and ligands, such as the LDL receptor and transferrin, that recycle to the cell surface (23Belcher J.D. Hamilton R.L. Brady S.E. Hornick C.A. Jaeckle S. Schneider W.J. Havel R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6785-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 34Jäckle S. Runquist E.

Chem. 1991; 266: 1396-1402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total HL activity recovered in multivesicular bodies increased from 0.31 ± 0.06 to 0.77 ± 0.27% of total liver homogenate (mean and S.D., n = 5) 15 min after loading the liver with human LDL, with no change in enrichment. Endosomal HL actively hydrolyzed triglycerides in endocytosed chylomicron remnants, and its activity in homogenate and endosomes was completely inhibited by goat antiserum against dog HL (data not shown). The extent of enrichment of HL in multivesicular bodies over liver homogenate (20–30-fold) was lower than that observed for ligands such as LDL (∼200-fold). This presumably reflects the relatively large pool of HL on liver cell surfaces (3Shafi S. Brady S.E. Bensadoun A. Havel R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 709-720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Schoonderwoerd K. Verhoeven A.J. Jansen H. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that HL may leave this pool by binding to receptors that enter hepatocytes via coated pits.Table IEnrichment of hepatic lipase in endosomes isolated from livers of estradiol-treated ratsEndosome fractionActivityaFold enrichment over liver homogenate (n = 3; mean and S.E.); homogenate activity = 5.28 ± 0.82 nmol min—1 mg protein—1MassbFold enrichment over homogenate (n = 1); homogenate mass = 28 ng/mg proteinEarly endosomes13.5 ± 5.712.2Multivesicular bodies30.1 ± 8.919.7Receptor-recycling compartment4.1 ± 2.72.6a Fold enrichment over liver homogenate (n = 3; mean and S.E.); homogenate activity = 5.28 ± 0.82 nmol min—1 mg protein—1b Fold enrichment over homogenate (n = 1); homogenate mass = 28 ng/mg protein Open table in a new tab Selection of Dose of GST-RAP to Inhibit Binding of Lipases to LRP—RAP prevents binding of all high affinity ligands, such as HL and LPL, to LRP. GST-RAP has manyfold higher affinity for LRP than for the LDL receptor (18Mokuno H. Brady S. Kotite L. Herz J. Havel R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13238-13243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Medh J.D. Fry G.L. Bowen S.L. Pladet M.W. Stickland D.K. Chappell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 536-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Previous studies (18Mokuno H. Brady S. Kotite L. Herz J. Havel R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13238-13243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that GST-RAP is rapidly endocytosed into rat hepatocytes after intravenous injection. Accordingly, to avoid appreciable binding of GST-RAP to the LDL receptor, we first determined the smallest dose of GST-RAP, given as a pulse intravenously and followed by a continuous infusion, that would completely prevent binding of a known high affinity ligand for LRP in fasted male Sprague-Dawley rats. As shown in Fig. 1, a pulse of 2 mg of GST-RAP, followed by infusion at a rate of 0.13 mg/min for 30 min, almost completely eliminated the clearance of 50 μg of activated α2MG, whereas a 50% lower amount of GST-RAP yielded only partial inhibition of clearance as compared with infusion of GST. The effective dose was utilized in all subsequent experiments. Effect of GST-RAP on the Concentration of HL and LPL in Plasma and Liver and Their Enrichment in Hepatocytic Endosomes—During the 30-min infusion of GST-RAP, the concentration of HL increased progressively in blood plasma (Fig. 2A and Table II). After 30 min, the concentration of HL in plasma had increased significantly by 20% in animals given GST-RAP, whereas no change occurred in control animals given GST. However, the liver still contained 99% of the total mass of HL in liver + plasma in rats given GST-RAP, as it did in those given GST (Table II). The increasing concentration of plasma HL in the GST-RAP group is consistent with reduced internalization of hepatic HL, which is mainly extracellular (3Shafi S. Brady S.E. Bensadoun A. Havel R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 709-720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Schoonderwoerd K. Verhoeven A.J. Jansen H. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Indeed, as shown in Fig. 2B, enrichment of HL in the hepatocytic total endosome fraction was about 50% lower in animals given GST-RAP than in those given GST (p < 0.05). The effect of GST-RAP infusion on the concentration of LPL in plasma and its enrichment in endosomes was more pronounced than that observed for HL. As shown in Fig. 2C and Table III, the concentration of LPL in plasma was 2.5-fold higher in rats given GST-RAP than in those given GST, and LPL became undetectable in hepatocytic endosomes in the former group. Given the sensitivity of the ELISA for LPL, we estimate that endosomal enrichment of LPL was reduced by at least 95%. Enrichment of LPL in endosomes of control animals given GST (10-fold) was similar to that of HL in corresponding controls (8-fold), even though the mass of LPL in liver was less than 1% that of HL (compare Tables II and III). Livers contained 96.5% of the combined mass of LPL in liver + plasma in GST-infused control animals. This value was lower, 93.8%, in animals given GST-RAP (Table III). These results, taken together, suggest that HL is internalized into hepatocytes in part, and LPL is internalized almost entirely by a RAP-sensitive process or processes.Table IIConcentration and distribution of HL in liver and plasma during infusions of GST or GST-RAP Total HL mass in plasma was calculated for a plasma volume of 4.5% of body weight.

Brady S. Kotite L. Herz J. Havel R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13238-13243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LRP is enriched in hepatocytic endosome fractions from untreated as well as estradiol-treated rats in a pattern consistent with extensive receptor recycling (37Lund H. Takahashi K. Hamilton R.L. Havel R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9318-9322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). GST-RAP is known to block similarly the endocytosis of all other high affinity ligands for LRP (38Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). We found no effect of the 30-min infusion of GST-RAP upon the mass of LRP in liver homogenates, as estimated by Western blotting (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, however, endosomal enrichment was about 40% lower in animals given GST-RAP than in those given GST (p < 0.05). As in estradiol-treated rats (23Belcher J.D. Hamilton R.L. Brady S.E. Hornick C.A. Jaeckle S. Schneider W.J. Havel R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6785-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the LDL receptor was also comparably enriched in endosome fractions from untreated rats in a pattern consistent with receptor recycling. 2M. Vergés and R. Havel, unpublished observations. GST-RAP infusion had no effect upon its endosomal enrichment, however. Furthermore, enrichment of other high affinity receptors studied previously in untreated or estradiol-treated rats (35Jäckle S. Runquist E.A. Miranda-Brady S. Havel R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1396-1402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Vergés M. Havel R.J. Mostov K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Effect of GST-RAP Upon Endosomal Purity and Endosomal Trafficking Machinery—To determine whether GST-RAP affected the purity of our endosome fractions, we first addressed Golgi contamination by probing for GM130, a cis-Golgi marker (40Nakamura N. Rabouille C. Watson R. Nilsson T. Hui N. Slusarewicz P. Kreis T.E. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1715-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). GM130 was only slightly enriched in endosomes from GST-infused animals (∼3-fold over homogenate), and no difference was found in endosomes from animals given GST-RAP (data not shown). Enrichment of total cholesterol and triglycerides in endosomes was also unaffected by GST-RAP infusion (Table IV). Plasma concentrations of total cholesterol and triglycerides in blood samples taken at the end of the infusions were also comparable in animals given GST (cholesterol 57 ± 3.7 mg/dl and triglycerides 66 ± 7.4 mg/dl) and GST-RAP (cholesterol 49 ± 4.4 mg/dl and triglycerides 55 ± 6.4 mg/dl, n = 6).Table IVTotal cholesterol and triglycerides in hepatocytic endosomes after infusion of GST or GST-RAP Fold enrichment for total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) was determined as describe"

This recent discovery has fostered the search for NS3 protease inhibitors. However, the enzyme’s unusual induced fit behavior and peculiar molecular architecture have imposed considerable obstacles to the development of small molecule inhibitors. In this article, we demonstrate that such unique induced fit behavior and the chymotrypsin-like catalytic domain can provide the structural plasticity necessary to generate protein-based inhibitors of the NS3 protease. We took advantage of the macromolecular scaffold of a Drosophila serpin, SP6, which intrinsically supports chymotrypsin-like enzyme inhibition, to design a novel class of potent and selective inhibitors. We show that altering the SP6 reactive site loop (RSL) resulted in the development of the first effective (Ki of 34 nm) and selective serpin, SP6EVC/S, directed at the NS3 protease. SP6EVC/S operates as a suicide substrate inhibitor, and its partitioning between the complex-forming and proteolytic pathways for the NS3 protease is HCV NS4A cofactor-dependent and -specific. Once bound to the protease active site, SP6EVC/S partitions with equal probability to undergo proteolysis by NS3 at the C-terminal site of the engineered RSL, (P6)Glu-Ile-(P4)Val-Met-Thr-(P1)Cys-↓-(P1′)Ser, or to form a covalent acyl-enzyme complex characteristic of cognate protease-serpin pairs. Our results also reveal a novel cofactor-induced serpin mechanism of enzyme inhibition that could be explored for developing effective and selective inhibitors of other important induced fit viral proteases of the Flaviviridae family such as the West Nile virus NS3 endoprotease.

Once bound to the protease active site, SP6EVC/S partitions with equal probability to undergo proteolysis by NS3 at the C-terminal site of the engineered RSL, (P6)Glu-Ile-(P4)Val-Met-Thr-(P1)Cys-↓-(P1′)Ser, or to form a covalent acyl-enzyme complex characteristic of cognate protease-serpin pairs. Our results also reveal a novel cofactor-induced serpin mechanism of enzyme inhibition that could be explored for developing effective and selective inhibitors of other important induced fit viral proteases of the Flaviviridae family such as the West Nile virus NS3 endoprotease.

Pause A. Shi Y. Sonenberg N. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 867-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The clinical significance of HCV and the need to rapidly identify new therapeutic approaches has resulted in intensive study of the molecular properties of this virus; yet, thus far, no efficient therapy or vaccine exists (1Tan S.L. Pause A. Shi Y. Sonenberg N. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 867-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 2De Francesco R. Tomei L. Altamura S. Summa V. Migliaccio G. Antiviral. Res. 2003; 58: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Moreover, although considerable progress has been made in understanding HCV biology (3Rosenberg S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 4Tellinghuisen T.L. Rice C.M. Curr. Opin.

Pause A. Shi Y. Sonenberg N. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 867-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The discovery that HCV nonstructural 3 (NS3) protease may be involved in the modulation of important host cell functions (5Foy E. Li K. Wang C. Sumpter Jr., R. Ikeda M. Lemon S.M. Gale Jr., M. Science. 2003; 300: 1145-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), in addition to its role in the maturation of the viral polyprotein precursor (NS3-NS5) (6Reed K.E. Rice C.M. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 55-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), has fostered the search for NS3 protease inhibitors (2De Francesco R. Tomei L. Altamura S. Summa V. Migliaccio G. Antiviral. Res. 2003; 58: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 7Narjes F. Koch U. Steinkuhler C. Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2003; 12: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The NS3 protease is an induced fit serine protease that adopts a chymotrypsin-like fold (8De Francesco R. Steinkuhler C. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 149-169PubMed Google Scholar). The action of a virus-encoded protein cofactor, NS4A, is required for some but not all of the NS3-dependent proteolytic cleavage events in vitro (9Koch J.O. Lohmann V. Herian U. Bartenschlager R. Virology. 1996; 221: 54-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and ex vivo (10Lin C. Pragai B.M. Grakoui A. Xu J. Rice C.M. J.

The commonly accepted model of action for the NS3 protease suggests that the protease undergoes an induced fit in the presence of the NS4A cofactor (12Bartenschlager R. J.

Intercalation of NS4A into the N-terminal domain of NS3 results in a rearrangement of the active site, consistent with the observed increase in the catalytic efficiency reported for the recombinant NS3/4A protease (15Landro J.A.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001: 563-564Google Scholar). The proposed mechanism of substrate-induced protease activation provides a framework to explain how the NS3 protease could be partially active even in the absence of the NS4A cofactor (15Landro J.A. Raybuck S.A. Luong Y.P. O'Malley E.T. Harbeson S.L. Morgenstern K.A. Rao G. Livingston D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9340-9348Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 16Po A. Martin M. Richer M.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001: 563-564Google Scholar). Unlike proteases of the long chain subfamily (17Bianchi E. Pessi A. Biopolymers. 2002; 66: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), such as human elastase, NS3 protease has short loops resulting in a featureless, shallow, and solvent-exposed substrate binding site, a feature that makes development of small molecule inhibitors difficult (2De Francesco R. Tomei L. Altamura S. Summa V. Migliaccio G. Antiviral. Res. 2003; 58: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 7Narjes F. Koch U. Steinkuhler C. Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2003; 12: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The interaction between the NS3 protease and its substrates is characterized by a series of weak contacts that extend over 10 amino acid residues, requires a cysteine in the P1 position, and relies on high charge densities (17Bianchi E. Pessi A. Biopolymers. 2002; 66: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, substrate recognition by the NS3 protease is more reminiscent of the protein-protein interactions found in an enzyme-protein inhibitor pair than of a “conventional” enzyme-substrate complex (12Bartenschlager R. J. Viral Hepat. 1999; 6: 165-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 17Bianchi E. Pessi A. Biopolymers. 2002; 66: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this article, we hypothesized that the bioengineering of a naturally occurring serine protease inhibitor (serpin) scaffold could provide a new approach to developing high affinity, selective NS3 protease inhibitors (18Jean F. Stella K. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Reason A.J. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 19Jean F. Thomas L. Molloy S.S. Liu G. Jarvis M.A. Nelson J.A. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2864-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Serpins differ from non-serpin inhibitors in that they require a large inhibitor conformational change in order to trap proteases in an irreversible complex (20Gettins P.G. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). The conformational change is initiated by the reaction of the active serine of the protease with the reactive site loop (RSL) of the serpin that results in a covalent species involving an acyl ester linkage to the γO of the protease active site serine. This cleaves the RSL, which then moves 71 Å to the opposite pole of the serpin, taking the tethered protease with it (20Gettins P.G. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar, 21Stratikos E. Gettins P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We selected a Drosophila serpin, SP6, to serve as a prototype of the macromolecular inhibitor scaffold, because SP6 has been shown to inhibit chymotrypsin-like proteases (22Han J. Zhang H. Min G. Kemler D. Hashimoto C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We show that engineering of the RSL of SP6 resulted in the development of SP6EVC/S, the first selective and effective serpin directed at the NS3 protease. SP6EVC/S operates as a suicide substrate inhibitor with the slow tight binding mechanism characteristic of serpin molecules. Partitioning between the covalent serpin acyl-enzyme complex-forming and proteolytic pathways for NS3 protease is both HCV NS4A cofactor- and serpin-dependent, supporting the recent model of cofactor- and substrate-induced NS3 activation as a mechanism of narrow specificity (23Tong L. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4609-4626Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Materials—pyroGlu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (pERTKR-MCA) was obtained from Bachem, trypsin (EC: 3.4.21.4) from Sigma, and anti-FLAG from Affinity Bioreagents. Synthesis of Peptidyl Analogs—All peptides were prepared by solid phase synthesis with the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) methodology using a multiple automated peptide synthesizer (24Pimenta D.C. Fogaca S.E. Melo R.L. Juliano L. Juliano M.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide purity and composition was demonstrated by reverse phase HPLC (RP-HPLC), matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS), and amino acid analysis (University of Toronto Advanced Protein Technology Center). The following peptides were used in this study: Ac-KKKGSVVIVGRIILSGR-NH2 (HCV-Pep4A); Ac-KKKGSVVVVGRIILSGR-NH2 (HCV-I25V); Ac-KKKGSVVIVGRWILSGR-NH2 (HCV-I29W); Ac-KKKGSVVVVGRWILSGRNH2 (HCV-I25V/I29W); Ac-KKKGSLVVVTSWVVNGN-NH2 (GBVA-Pep4A); Ac-KKKGATCVRRCWSITSV-NH2 (GBVB-Pep4A); and Ac-KKKGSLVVVTDWDVKGG-NH2 (GBVC-Pep4A).

Stock peptide solutions (10 mm) were prepared in Me2SO and stored at –20 °C. The His-tagged HCV NS3 Serine Protease and His/FLAG-tagged SP6 Variants—His-tagged NS3 expression plasmid encoding the N-terminal 181 amino acids of NS3 was kindly provided by Dr. N Kakiuchi, National Institute of Bioscience and Human Technology of Japan (25Vishnuvardhan D. Kakiuchi N. Urvil P.T. Shimotohno K. Kumar P.K. Nishikawa S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). His/FLAG-tagged SP6 was prepared from pET21a-SP6 (22Han J. Zhang H. Min G. Kemler D. Hashimoto C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) by standard PCR methods using an oligonucleotide primer encoding the FLAG epitope (Fig. 1). Desired changes in the RSL of parental SP6 were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene). Primers incorporating the desired changes were synthesized by Alpha DNA Inc. Multiple amino acid changes were introduced by sequential rounds of mutagenesis using newly synthesized SP6 variants as template. Introduction of the desired changes was confirmed by sequencing (Sheldon Biotechnology Center, McGill University, Montreal, Canada). Expression and Purification of HCV NS3 and Recombinant SP6 Variants—Recombinant NS3 protease and SP6 variants were expressed in the cytosol of bacteria (Escherichia coli BL21 pLysS) and purified as reported previously (18Jean F. Stella K. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Reason A.J. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) by nickel binding interaction chromatography (HiTrap Columns; Amersham Biosciences) using an AK-TApurifier FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). Protein purity and composition were demonstrated by RP-HPLC (18Jean F. Stella K. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Reason A.J. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), MALDI-TOF MS (Fig. 1) (University of Victoria-Genome British Columbia Proteomics Facility), Western blot (Fig. 2), and amino acid analysis (University of Toronto). Proteins were aliquoted, snap frozen, and stored at –86 °C. Enzymatic Assays—The enzyme assay data were obtained by using a SpectraMax Gemini XS spectrofluorometer equipped with a temperature-controlled 96-well plate reader (Molecular Dynamics) using excitation/emission wavelengths of 370/460 nm to measure release of 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) (16Po A.

Lazure C. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Trypsin assays were performed using pyroGlu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide as a fluorogenic substrate (27Jean F. Boudreault A. Basak A. Seidah N.G. Lazure C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19225-19231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), whereas a novel intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic peptide substrate (IQFS-1), based on the fluorescence energy transfer between the donor/acceptor couple (Abz and Tyr(NO2)), was used for NS3 protease (26Jean F. Basak A. DiMaio J. Seidah N.G. Lazure C. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Trypsin assays were performed at 30 °C in 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.3) containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.5% Triton X-100. NS3 protease assays were performed at 30 °C in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.3), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100. An NS3/4A protease heterocomplex was generated by preincubating NS3 with a saturating amount of HCV-Pep4A (7 μm) for 15 min at 30 °C (16Po A. Martin M. Richer M. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Jean F. Lebel M. Houghten R.A. Peptides: The Wave of the Future, Proceedings of the 2nd International/17th American Peptide Symposium. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001: 563-564Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE of Protease-Serpin Reactions—Reactions were performed under the buffer conditions for enzyme assays. Samples were collected at 1 h (unless otherwise noted), mixed immediately with reduced SDS-loading buffer at 95 °C, and heated for 10 min. SDS-gel electrophoresis (18Jean F. Stella K. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Reason A.J. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) was performed in a 10% gel, and the protein was visualized by Coomassie Blue or analyzed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody following transfer to nitrocellulose (18Jean F. Stella K. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Reason A.J. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 19Jean F. Thomas L. Molloy S.S. Liu G. Jarvis M.A. Nelson J.A. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2864-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Western blots were visualized directly using the VersaDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad). The resulting digital images were quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Determination of the RSL Cleavage Site and Covalent Serpin-Protease Complex Formation by MS—SP6C/S and SP6EVC/S (0.2 μm) were incubated with NS3/4A (2 μm:7 μm) for 1 h at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped with an aqueous 0.3% (v/v) CF3COOH solution (final 0.1% (v/v) CF3COOH). Stoichiometry ([I0] /[E0]) was chosen so that the reaction products were generated at sufficient levels to be detected by MALDI-TOF MS (University of Victoria). Alternatively, after completion, products were resolved on a 10% SDS gel. The high molecular weight complex band (EI*) was visualized with Coomassie Blue and excised from the gel. Trypsin digestion of the protein was performed by in-gel cleavage (28Kurzchalia T.V. Gorvel J.P. Dupree P. Parton R. Kellner R. Houthaeve T. Gruenberg J. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18419-18423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting peptide fragments were recovered by a series of extractions using 10% formic acid, and the mixture was resolved by RP-HPLC. Identification of each peptidyl fragment was performed using a quadruple TOF MS (University of Victoria). Stoichiometry of Inhibition (SI) and Determination of Ki—Values for SI and Ki were determined as described previously (18Jean F. Stella K. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Reason A.J. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) using active-site titrated NS3/4A protease. The active concentration of NS3/4A protease was determined by active site titration with PepInh-1, a novel tight-binding reversible inhibitor of NS3/4A protease (Ki = 2.8 ± 0.2 nm). 2M. J. Richer, P. Hamill, and F. Jean, unpublished results. Subsequent titrations were performed by pre-incubating each serpin variant with NS3 or NS3/4A for 30 min at 30 °C and adding increasing amounts of inhibitors to a fixed amount of protease. The residual protease activity was determined by the addition of IQFS-1 (100 μm). [E0] and Ki were obtained as described previously (18Jean F. Stella K. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Reason A.J. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 29Knight C.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 85-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Measurements were also made using the progress curve method for the reaction started with enzyme (18Jean F. Stella K. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Reason A.J. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Engineering Drosophila SP6 Scaffold to Target the HCV NS3 Viral Protease—Because previous studies have demonstrated that SP6 architecture can inhibit chymotrypsin-like serine proteases (22Han J. Zhang H. Min G. Kemler D. Hashimoto C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we selected this novel Drosophila serpin scaffold to bioengineer an inhibitor directed at the NS3 protease. The design of the SP6-RSL was based on a quantitative kinetic analysis performed with IQFSs based on NS3-dependent cleavage sites of the HCV polyprotein. 3M. J. Richer, M. M. Martin, A. Po, L. Juliano, and F. Jean, unpublished results. We observed that the binding energy for the substrate is derived from a series of weak interactions distributed along an extended contact surface (P6–P4′) (30Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4766) Google Scholar). The major determinants of substrate recognition include conserved residues in (P1)Cys, (P1′)Ser, and (P6)Glu positions. P3, P4 and P4′ residues also contribute to efficient substrate recognition, although less dramatically. The RSL sequence of SP6 variants prepared in this study is shown in Fig. 1 and includes single or multiple mutations introduced to optimize the interactions between the RSL of SP6 and the substrate binding sites of NS3 (S6–S1′) (30Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4766) Google Scholar). Selective Inactivation of HCV NS3/4A Protease Activity by Bioengineered SP6EVC/S—We screened for serpin inhibitory activity by incubating the SP6 variants with trypsin or NS3/4A before adding the appropriate substrate (Fig. 2A). Although the native SP6 inhibited trypsin completely, it was not effective against NS3/4A protease activity (Fig. 2A). As predicted, engineering the SP6-RSL to include all the key molecular determinants needed for optimum recognition by the viral protease generates a serpin (SP6EVC/S) that efficiently inactivates NS3/4A protease activity (Fig. 2A). Importantly, optimizing the RSL of SP6 to target NS3 also resulted in a loss of trypsin inhibition. SP6C/S, whose RSL is lacking the P4 and P6 mutations, inhibited both trypsin and NS3. The inhibition of trypsin was less efficient and did not involve a classical serpin mechanism (no apparent SDS-heat stable complex; data not shown). Substitution of the serine residue in P1′ position of SP6EVC/S by a proline residue (SP6EVC/P) resulted in a loss of inhibitory activity against NS3/4A protease (Fig. 2A). This was a surprising result, because a similar substitution in a synthetic peptidyl substrate based on the HCV NS5A/5B junction resulted in a competitive inhibitor of NS3 (31Ingallinella P. Bianchi E. Ingenito R. Koch U. Steinkuhler C. Altamura S. Pessi A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12898-12906Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This first survey of inhibitory activity of the SP6 variants confirmed the potential of SP6 as a scaffold to design NS3 specific inhibitors. HCV-Pep4A Is Required for Specific Interaction of HCV NS3 Protease with Serpin—The influence of the HCV-Pep4A (NS4A cofactor, residues 21–34; Fig. 5) on the mechanism of inhibition of NS3 protease by the SP6 variants was evaluated. SP6 variants were incubated with NS3 or NS3/4A, and the reactions were analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 2B). Incubation of each serpin in the absence of NS3 protease showed a single ∼44-kDa protein (Fig. 2B, lanes 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13), which corresponds to the predicted mass of the SP6 variants (Fig. 1). Including HCV-Pep4A in the incubation with NS3 resulted in a shift of SP6C/S and SP6EVC/S (Fig. 2B, lanes 6, 9, and 12) to a single high Mr band (∼70 kDa) corresponding to the predicted molecular masses of serpin-NS3 complexes (64.4 kDa). Native SP6, SP6C, and SP6EVC/P could not form a complex with NS3/4A (less than 2% with SP6C), and the SP6 variants were not cleaved, indicating that these variants are not effective inhibitors of NS3 (Fig. 2B, lanes 3, 6, and 15). In contrast, the EI* complex observed with SP6C/S and SP6EVC/S was associated with the presence of the cleaved forms (Ic ∼ 39 kDa) of the serpin (Fig. 2B, lanes 9, 12). These data indicate that SP6C/S and SP6EVC/S, in the presence of HCV-Pep4A, can interact with the protease. We concluded that HCV-Pep4A is required for efficient formation of SDS-stable complexes between NS3 protease and SP6C/S or SP6EVC/S. HCV NS3 Protease Forms a Stable Covalent Acyl-Enzyme Complex with SP6EVC/S—MS analysis was used to identify the high Mr band resolved on SDS-PAGE for the NS3/4A-SP6EVC/S reaction (Fig. 2B, lane 12). MS/MS sequence analysis of five tryptic peptidyl fragments from the high Mr band was obtained. Four of the fragments sequenced were derived from SP6 (15FTSELFQLLSAGGLK29, 146ITELVSADSFSDNTR160, 161LVLLNALHFK170, and 239TGIYALAEK247), and one corresponded to the NS3 protease (12GLLGCIITSLTGR24). These results are consistent with the idea that the high Mr band detected by Western blot is an SDS-heat stable serpin acylenzyme complex. MALDI-MS was used to demonstrate the formation of a covalent serpin acyl-enzyme complex between SP6EVC/S and NS3 protease. MS analysis of the NS3/4A-SP6EVC/S reaction performed in optimized conditions to yield maximum amounts of complexes revealed the presence of stable covalent species with an observed mass of 64308.88 (Fig. 3B). The calculated mass for the NS3-SP6EVC/S serpin-protease complex is 64427.41 (relative error 0.18%). Other species detected included the liberated SP6EVC/S N-terminal (39845.62) (Fig. 3B) and C-terminal (3932.05) (Fig. 3A) fragments, native NS3 protease (24338.00) (Fig. 3B), and HCV-Pep4A (1851.31) (Fig. 3A). Thus, MS analysis of the NS3/4A-SP6EVC/S reaction revealed products consistent with the formation of a covalent complex (inhibitor pathway) characteristic of serpin-enzyme interactions and cleavage of the engineered RSL at the P1 position (substrate pathway) (20Gettins P.G. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). SP6EVC/S Inhibits HCV NS3/4A Protease by the Slow Tight Binding Mechanism Characteristic of Serpin Molecules—The temporal relationship between complex formation and inhibition of NS3 protease activity was examined. The rate of complex formation (kobs) of NS3/4A protease by SP6C/S and SP6EVC/S was examined by SDS-PAGE, and the value was determined as described previously (32Zhou A. Carrell R.W. Huntington J.A.

NS3 or NS3/4A was combined with each of the serpin variants, and complex formation was measured at various time points (Fig. 4, A and B). The kobs with NS3/4A protease for SP6EVC/S (3.3 ± 0.4 × 10–2 s–1) is ∼3× more rapid than the value estimated for SP6C/S (1.2 ± 0.2 × 10–2 s–1). In the absence of HCV-Pep4A, the rate of serpin-protease complex formation was much slower (SP6EVC/S-NS3, 50% complete (t½) at 4 h; SP6C/S-NS3 < 1% at 4 h; data not shown). By comparison, the t½ values of SP6EVC/S-NS3/4A and SP6 trypsin complex formation were 85 s (Fig. 4B) and 20 s (data not shown), respectively. Typical of serpinenzyme interactions, the inhibition of NS3/4A by SP6C/S (Fig. 4C) and SP6EVC/S (Fig. 4D) obeyed slow binding inhibition kinetics as indicated by biphasic plots in which maximal inhibition was achieved more rapidly with increasing concentrations of serpin (18Jean F. Stella K. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Reason A.J. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The serpin-enzyme complexes were kinetically trapped, because no NS3 protease activity was recovered for up to 3 h (Fig. 4, C and D). These results confirm the SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 4, A and B, insets) and support the formation of covalent complexes demonstrated by MS analyses (Fig. 3B). SP6EVC/S Is a Tight Binding Titrant of the HCV NS3/4A Protease—After formation of the serpin/enzyme acyl intermediate (EI′) (20Gettins P.G. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar), serpins may either be cleaved and released (Ic) or trap the enzyme in a kinetically stable SDS-resistant complex (EI*) (Fig. 4B, inset) (20Gettins P.G. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). The relative flux of a serpin through these pathways reflects its efficiency as an inhibitor for a given enzyme and is described as the stoichiometry of inhibition (20Gettins P.G. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). SI is defined as the ratio of moles of serpin needed to inhibit 1 mol of protease (20Gettins P.G. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Titration experiments were performed to determine the SI for NS3/4A-SP6C/S and NS3/4A-SP6EVC/S (18Jean F. Stella K. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Reason A.J. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 29Knight C.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 85-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The concentration of NS3/4A ([E0]) was determined by titrating the enzyme activity with PepInh-1 (data not shown). In a parallel analysis, NS3/4A activity was titrated with SP6C/S (Fig. 4E) or SP6EVC/S (Fig. 4F). Regression analysis of residual NS3/4A activity as a function of [I0]/[E0] shows that SP6C/S inhibits NS3 with an SI of ∼4 (3.8), whereas SP6EVC/S inhibits with an SI of ∼2 (2.1). This means that, after binding to the active site of NS3, SP6EVC/S partitions with equal probability between the substrate and the inhibition pathways (20Gettins P.G. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Analysis of the titrations by curve fitting (Fig. 4, E and F) revealed an overall Ki of 125 ± 16 nm for NS3/4A-SP6C/S and 34 ± 5 nm for NS3/4A-SP6EVC/S. These results indicated that SP6EVC/S is a tight binding titrant of the NS3/4A protease operating as a suicide substrate inhibitor. HCV NS4A Is an Obligate Cofactor for HCV NS3 Protease Inhibition by SP6EVC/S—We evaluated the stimulatory effects of other NS4A functional homologues from the Flaviviridae family (33Ryan M.D. Monaghan S. Flint M. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 947-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We synthesized three NS4A peptides containing the putative minimal activating NS4A sequence (amino acids 22–33) of GBVA, GBVB, and GBVC (34Lin C. Thomson J.A. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4373-4380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the products of the NS3/4A/serpin reactions showed that only HCV-Pep4A significantly enhanced complex formation (Fig. 5B, lanes 1 and 6). As a control, we measured the stimulatory effects of the NS4A peptides in trans-cleavage reactions using IQFS-1. The results showed that cleavage strictly depends on the addition of HCV-Pep4A (Fig. 5B, left panel). No other NS4A analog could activate NS3 protease activity even when used in 5-fold excess of the saturating concentration for HCV-Pep4A (data not shown). Thus, the cofactor dependence for complex formation parallels the changes seen for enzymatic activity, for which only the presence of HCV-Pep4A increases hydrolysis rates. Role of Ile25 and Ile29 of the NS4A on Serpin Acyl-Enzyme Complex Formation—Comparison of the primary sequences of Flavivirus NS4A functional homologues with several Hepacivirus strains demonstrates that hydrophobic amino acids are highly conserved at positions 25 and 29 of the central region of NS4A protein (data not shown). Although these two residues are strictly conserved within isolates of the same genus, they differ markedly across the Hepacivirus and Flavivirus strains (Fig. 5A). We synthesized three HCV-Pep4A variants by substituting residues at positions 25 (HCV-I25V), 29 (HCV-I29W), and 25 and 29 (HCV-I25V/I29W) for the corresponding residues conserved in NS4A of GBVs. Analysis of the products of the NS3/4A/serpin reactions showed that mutation at Ile25 or Ile29 had an important effect on SP6C/S-NS3 complex formation with cofactor activity values reduced to ∼56.5% (HCV-I25V) and 20.3% (HCV-I29W) of wild-type levels (Fig. 5C, right panel). The double mutations at Ile25 and Ile29 (HCV-I25V/I29W) had a more dramatic effect, reducing activity to only 3.6% of wild-type. In contrast, the effect of the individual mutations (Ile25 or Ile29) was less pronounced with the SP6EVC/S variant (87.1% and 69.7%), with complete reduction of the NS4A-mediated complex activation observed only when the reaction was performed with the double mutant, HCV-I25V/I29W (Fig. 5C, right panel). It should be noted that SP6EVC/S can form an acyl-enzyme complex via an NS4A-independent mechanism (30.6% of wild-type control), supporting a plausible role for the serpin itself in enzyme activation (Fig. 5C, right panel). The effects that these substitutions in the HCV-Pep4A impart on the active site of NS3 protease were investigated using IQFS-1 (Fig. 5C, left panel). We found that substituting residues 25 and 29 individually with the corresponding residues from GBV NS4A resulted in a substantial decrease in the NS3/4A endoproteolytic activity (HCV-I25V, 51.8%; HCV-I29W, 24.5%) (Fig. 5 C, left panel). The double mutant of NS4A cofactor peptide, HCV-I25V/I29W, had little cofactor activity (15.3%) (Fig. 5C, left panel). The requirement of the same functional domain and hydrophobic amino acids of NS4A for each trans-processing activity of NS3 (serpin or substrate recognition and catalysis) indicated a critical role for NS4A in these two biochemical pathways and a complex interplay between the cofactor, viral protease, and serpin. This is further supported by the important increase in Ki (127 ± 13 nm) and SI (8.3 ± 0.6) determined for NS3/SP6EVC/S in the presence of HCV-I29W (data not shown). Taken together, the results of this study indicate the critical requirement of a fully activated heterodimeric protease (NS3/4A) for SP6EVC/S to effectively form a complex with and inhibit the NS3 protease. This article presents the design and characterization of a novel class of potent and selective HCV NS3 protein inhibitors. We selected a novel Drosophila serpin, SP6, as a prototype of a protein inhibitor scaffold because it has been shown to inhibit chymotrypsin-like proteases (22Han J. Zhang H. Min G. Kemler D. Hashimoto C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Engineering of the RSL of SP6 resulted in the development of SP6EVC/S, the first selective and effective serpin directed at the NS3 protease. Kinetic studies have shown that SP6EVC/S inhibits NS3 by the slow tight binding mechanism typical of serpins and operates as a suicide substrate inhibitor. Biochemical analysis of the serpin mechanism of NS3 protease inhibition revealed that HCV NS4A is an obligate cofactor for enzyme inhibition by SP6EVC/S. Although many serpins identified to date have a narrow specificity, others act as broad-based protease inhibitors (20Gettins P.G. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Modifications affecting sequences and/or size of the serpin-RSL strongly influence the type of target enzymes and/or the rate of their inactivation (20Gettins P.G. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). By testing the specificity of five SP6 variants, we show the importance of an appropriate RSL sequence for developing a selective and potent inhibitor of HCV NS3 protease. In particular, we demonstrate the essential requirement of three key residues within the SP6-RSL (P1(Cys), P1′(Ser), and P6(Glu)) to trigger effective formation of an irreversible serpin-NS3 protease complex. These results also suggest that bioengineering of other serpin scaffolds that intrinsically support chymotrypsin-like serine protease inhibition could result in novel prototypes of the serpin-based inhibitors of HCV NS3 protease. Indeed, our preliminary studies with engineered α1-antitrypsin variants 4A. Po and F. Jean, unpublished results. support this hypothesis. Because enzyme inhibition by serpins is a biochemical reaction, an associated rate of inhibition can be increased or decreased by cofactors or allosteric effectors (20Gettins P.G. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). The branched nature of the serpin inhibitory pathway also ensures two possible products of the reaction between serpin and protease, namely a kinetically trapped acyl-enzyme complex and a cleaved serpin. In our study on the SP6-NS3 pair, we demonstrated that the virally encoded cofactor, NS4A, regulates not only the rate of serpin-protease complex formation (kobs) and the overall inhibition constant (Ki) but also the partitioning between the complex-forming and proteolytic pathways (SI). For example, we observed a 2–3 log increase in the kobs values for the SP6-NS3 pair in the presence of HCV-Pep4A. These results agree with recent findings by Bianchi et al. (35Bianchi E. Orru S. Dal Piaz F. Ingenito R. Casbarra A. Biasiol G. Koch U. Pucci P. Pessi A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13844-13852Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and support a mechanistic model of action for NS4A in which cofactor binding induces an NS3 structure that is already, but not entirely, pre-organized for substrate/inhibitor binding. Hence, this NS4A-mediated stabilization mechanism, which helps to pre-organize the binding site, could explain in part the rapid formation of stable acyl-enzyme complexes with the SP6 variants, but only for NS3/4A heterodimeric serine protease. Second, our kinetics studies on NS3/4A/SP6C/S, NS3/4A/SP6EVC/S, and NS3/4A-I29W/SP6EVC/S demonstrated an important contribution of each individual component of the ternary complex (protease/cofactor/serpin) in the mechanism of inhibition and the regulation of the outcome of the serpin-branched pathway. This is consistent with the recently proposed model in which, in addition to the NS4A cofactor, the substrate/substrate-based inhibitor plays an important role in activating the NS3 protease catalytic mechanism by conformational stabilization of the catalytic triad (36Barbato G. Cicero D.O. Nardi M.C. Steinkuhler C. Cortese R. De Francesco R. Bazzo R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 371-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We are attempting to cocrystallize NS3/4A/SP6EVC/S to provide structural information on this rather unique ternary complex. In addition, we are examining the potential of this novel cofactor-induced serpin mechanism of enzyme inhibition for developing effective and selective protein inhibitors of other important induced fit viral proteases from the Flaviviridae family (e.g. West Nile virus NS3 and dengue virus NS3).

Kelly for constructive comments and proofreading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2035773125,"Work in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has shown that Atp12p binds to unassembled α subunits of F1 and in so doing prevents the α subunit from associating with itself in non-productive complexes during assembly of the F1 moiety of the mitochondrial ATP synthase. We have developed a method to prepare recombinant Atp12p after expression of its human cDNA in bacterial cells. The molecular chaperone activity of HuAtp12p was studied using citrate synthase as a model substrate. Wild type HuAtp12p suppresses the aggregation of thermally inactivated citrate synthase. In contrast, the mutant protein HuAtp12pE240K, which harbors a lysine at the position of the highly conserved Glu-240, fails to prevent citrate synthase aggregation at 43 °C. No significant differences were observed between the wild type and the mutant proteins as judged by sedimentation analysis, cysteine titration, tryptophan emission spectra, or limited proteolysis, which suggests that the E240K mutation alters the activity of HuAtp12p with minimal effects on the physical integrity of the protein. An additional important finding of this work is that the equilibrium chemical denaturation curve of HuAtp12p shows two components, the first of which is associated with protein aggregation. This result is consistent with a model for Atp12p structure in which there is a hydrophobic chaperone domain that is buried within the protein interior.

This result is consistent with a model for Atp12p structure in which there is a hydrophobic chaperone domain that is buried within the protein interior. Atp12p was first identified in studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants that are respiratory-deficient due to a defect in mitochondrial F1 assembly. The core structure of F1 is a hexameric unit of alternating α and β subunits that surrounds a rod-shaped γ subunit (1Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar). Yeast atp12 mutants fail to assemble the α3β3 oligomer, and instead accumulate F1 α and β subunits as large, insoluble aggregates in the matrix of the organelle (2Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This particular phenotype is observed also in yeast mutants that lack a functional Atp11p, another molecular chaperone of the mitochondrial F1 assembly pathway (3Ackerman S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). There is also F1 protein aggregation in yeast null mutants that are missing either the α subunit or the β subunit, as such strains accumulate the lone β or α subunit as aggregated proteins inside mitochondria (2Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Because lack of the γ subunit does not produce aggregation of α and β subunits (4Paul M.F. Ackerman S. Yue J. Arselin G. Velours J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26158-26164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is believed that γ assembles into the F1 structure after Atp11p- and Atp12p-mediated steps have secured the formation of a soluble αβ intermediate (3Ackerman S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The amount of yeast Atp12p in the mitochondrial matrix is roughly 100 times smaller than the amount of F1 protein (5Wang Z.G. Sheluho D. Gatti D.L. Ackerman S.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1486-1493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This molar ratio seems appropriate in consideration of the fact that Atp12p does not bind to α subunits that are part of the F1 oligomer but, instead, associates with unassembled α subunits. Because unassembled F1 proteins do not accumulate to a significant degree in the cell (6Burns D.J. Lewin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12066-12073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Atp12p concentration in mitochondria may be comparable with the concentration of free F1 α subunit protein. Therefore, the amount of Atp12p is not likely to be a limiting factor in mitochondrial F1 biogenesis under normal conditions in the cell. However, reducing the level of active Atp12p in mitochondria is anticipated to correlate directly with a decreased flux through the F1 assembly pathway. Such considerations underscore the important role of human Atp12p (HuAtp12p) and its potential ties to mitochondrial disease. We have now developed a method to purify recombinant HuAtp12p in high yield from a bacterial expression system, and this has enabled us to expand the analysis of the physical and functional properties of the molecular chaperone beyond what was formerly achieved in studies of the yeast protein in mitochondrial samples. One significant aspect of the work has been to evaluate wild type HuAtp12p in comparison with a mutant form of the protein that harbors a Glu → Lys substitution at a conserved position in the amino acid sequence. In particular, we show that the wild type HuAtp12p behaves in vitro as a molecular chaperone, whereas the mutant HuAtp12pE240K is defective in this capacity. Despite this clear functional difference, the wild type and mutant proteins are reported to be similar with respect to sedimentation properties, intrinsic fluorescence under native conditions, cysteine accessibility, and protease sensitivity. Spectroscopic analysis of HuAtp12p unfolding in guanidine hydrochloride is also presented, which suggests the presence of a hydrophobic subdomain in the protein structure. Plasmid Construction—Recombinant plasmids for the production of human Atp12p (HuAtp12p) in Escherichia coli were constructed in the His-tag vector pPROEX HTa (Invitrogen) and were designed to produce the mature form of the protein without the mitochondrial leader peptide. The DNA for wild type HuAtp12p was prepared using the PCR to amplify an 806-bp fragment inclusive of HuAtp12p codons 33–289, start and stop codons, and flanking restriction sites for cloning. The forward and reverse primers were, respectively, 5′-CCGGAATTCATGATCCCGTCTCCAGCCCGGGCTTAC-3′ and 5′-CCGAGGTACCGGTCACTCCTTCAGGAGCTTGTGCTT-3′ and are annotated to highlight the EcoRI and KpnI restriction sequences (underlines), ATG and TGA codons (double underlines), and HuAtp12p coding sequences (bold) contained within. The plasmid template was pCUPHUATP12/YEp (7Wang Z.G. White P.S. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30773-30778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The PCR product and pPROEX HTa vector were each digested with a combination of EcoRI and KpnI, and the linear fragments were ligated and used to transform E. coli strain RRI. The resultant new plasmid (pPROEX/Atp12h) was used to prepare wild type HuAtp12p for this work and also served as the template for PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis via the Stratagene QuikChange method to introduce a Glu → Lys change at position 240 in the recombinant protein. The two complementary oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis were sensestrand primer 5′-GCCGTGCTGCTGTCTAGACTGAAGGAGGAGTACCAGATC-3′ and antisense-strand primer 5′-GATCTGGTACTCCTCCTTCAGTCTAGACAGCAGCACGGC-3′ and encompassed HuAtp12p DNA sequence 697–735 with three silent mutations (underline) to create a XbaI site for screening purposes and a G → A (bold) mutation to convert Glu-240 to lysine. The PCR reaction (50 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm NH4(SO4)2, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 ng of pPROEX/ATP 12-h plasmid (DNA template), and 125 ng of each primer. After the reaction was incubated at 95 °C for 2 min and then allowed to slowly cool to room temperature, 3 μl of QuikSolution (Stratagene), 6 μl of 2 mm deoxynucleotide triphosphate mixture, and 1 μl of Pfu Turbo (2.5 units) were added, and the tube was incubated at 68 °C for 5 min. Next, PCR was performed for 18 cycles (95 °C for 50 s, 60 °C for 50 s, 68 °C for 11 min). The resultant mixture was digested with DpnI at 37 °C for 1 h to destroy the original plasmid DNA template, after which 10 μl was used to transform competent E. coli cells. Bacterial colonies harboring the mutant plasmid (called pPROEX/Atp12hE240K) were identified by restriction analysis in an EcoRI/XbaI digest and tested in small scale experiments for isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced production of recombinant protein. One such expressing clone was selected and used for large scale production/purification of the mutant Atp12p protein (HuAtp12pE240K). DNA sequencing confirmed that only the desired mutation is present in the plasmid insert of pPROEX/Atp12phE240K. Purification of Recombinant HuAtp12p Wild Type and Mutant Proteins—HuAtp12p and HuAtp12pE240K were overproduced in E. coli RRI cells and purified according to the following method. An overnight LB ampicillin (40 mg/liter) culture of plasmid-bearing cells was diluted 200 times into 1 liter of 2XYT (1% yeast extract, 1.6% tryptone, 0.5% NaCl) plus ampicillin, and the cells were grown at 37 °C until A600 nm = 0.5, at which time the culture was supplemented to include 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and incubated overnight with shaking at 37 °C. The next morning the cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), resuspended in 40 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, and sonically irradiated in a 50-ml beaker for 30 s, 5 times, at maximum power output using a Branson Sonifer model 450. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to 1 μm during cell breakage to prevent proteolysis, and lysozyme was added at 0.2 mg/ml to enhance breaking. After the addition of streptomycin sulfate to 1% final concentration, the disrupted cells were centrifuged at 145,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the resultant supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe disc, diluted 3-times with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and applied to a DEAE column (8.7 × 2.5 cm). The column was developed with a salt gradient in the same buffer that contained 0–1 m NaCl. Column fractions containing HuAtp12p were pooled and dialyzed for 1 h against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to lower the salt concentration, and the dialysate was loaded on a cobalt column (Talon resin, Clontech; 5.1 × 1.5 cm) previously equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The cobalt column was washed with 50 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40 mm imidazole, 0.3 m NaCl buffer, and His-tag HuAtp12p was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m imidazole, 0.3 m NaCl. Final preparations of HuAtp12 and HuAtp12E239K were dialyzed overnight versus 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, brought to 10–15 mg/ml using Centricon 10 concentrators, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Sedimentation Analysis—Sucrose solutions were prepared in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100. Linear gradients (4.4 ml) of 7–20% (w/v) sucrose were overlaid on top of 0.4 ml of 80% (w/v) sucrose in 5-ml ultracentrifuge tubes. Protein samples (0.2 ml) applied to the gradients contained 4 μg of purified recombinant HuAtp12p (wild type or mutant) in a mixture with molecular weight standards (Mr horse hemoglobin = 64,500) and (Mr myokinase = 21,000). The tubes were centrifuged in a Beckman SW55Ti rotor at 37,800 rpm for 18 h at 4 °C, and gradient fractions (300 μl) were collected from the bottom of the tube. The fractions were probed by Western analysis with a polyclonal antibody raised against yeast Atp12p and assayed for peak positions of hemoglobin and myokinase as previously described (8Wang Z.G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2993-3002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Aggregation Suppression Experiments—Measurements of thermally induced aggregation of citrate synthase (CS) 1The abbreviations used are: CS, citrate synthase; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride. were carried out essentially as described (9Jakob U. Lilie H. Meyer I. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7288-7294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Porcine heart CS (Sigma) was diluted to 0.075 μm in 1 ml of 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, buffer that was prewarmed to 43 °C in a thermostatted cell of a SLM Aminco-Bowman Series 2 fluorescence spectrometer. Right angle light scattering was recorded over time at 43 °C with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 465 nm and slit widths at 4 nm. HuAtp12p (wild type or mutant) or other additives were included in the incubation at the concentrations indicated for each experiment. CS concentration was determined using the extinction coefficient of 1.78 for a 1 mg/ml solution of the dimer at 280 nm (10Singh M. Brooks G.C. Srere P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4636-4640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteolytic Digestion—For analytical experiments 5 μg of wild type or mutant HuAtp12p were mixed with serial dilutions of trypsin or chymotrypsin ranging from 0.01 to 3% in 20 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Proteolysis was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37 °C, at which point the reactions were stopped with the addition of trichloroacetic acid to 10%. Precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, suspended in SDS gel buffer, and resolved in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. To identify the principal proteolytic fragment of highest molecular weight, a 100-μg sample of HuAtp12p was first digested with either trypsin or chymotrypsin at 1% in 67 μl, and after the reaction was quenched, the acid-precipitated protein was resolved in an SDS gel, and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, WESTRAN®) as described (11Matsudaira P.

The amino-terminal residues of the immobilized proteolytic fragment were identified by Edman degradation at the protein sequencing facility of the Department of Genetics at the University of Georgia. Chemical Denaturation Studies and Data Analysis—Wild type or mutant HuAtp12p (1 μm) was incubated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl supplemented with increasing amounts of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) at 23 °C for 3 h. Equilibrium was reached during this time period. The concentration of GdnHCl in each experimental sample (0–5 m range) was determined from its refractive index (12Nozaki Y. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 26: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra were recorded between 300 and 400 nm after excitation at 280 nm. Slit widths were set at 4.0 nm. The red shift in intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra at increasing GdnHCl concentrations were quantified as the intensity-averaged emission wavelength, λavg (13Royer C.A. Mann C.J. Matthews C.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1844-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), calculated according to Equation 1, λavg=∑(Iiλi)/∑(Ii)Eq. 1 where λi and Ii are the emission wavelength and its corresponding fluorescence intensity at that wavelength. Base-line and transition-region data for the first and second component of the HuAtp12p GdnHCl equilibrium denaturation curve were fitted to a two-state linear-extrapolation model (14Fersht A.R. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1999Google Scholar) according to Equation 2, ΔGunfolding=ΔGH2O-m[D]=-RTInKunfoldingEq. 2 where ΔGunfolding is the free energy change for unfolding at a given denaturant (GdnHCl) concentration, ΔGH2O is the free energy change for unfolding in the absence of denaturant, m is a slope term that equates the change in ΔGunfolding per unit concentration of GdnHCl, R is the gas constant (1.987 cal mol-1 K-1), T is the temperature (296.15 K), and Kunfolding is the equilibrium constant for unfolding. The linear extrapolation model expresses the signal (λavg) as a function of GdnHCl concentration according to Equation 3 (15Clarke J. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4322-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), yi={yN+mN[X]i+(yD+mD[X]i)×exp[m([X]i-[D]50%)/RT]}/{1+exp[m([X]i-[D]50%)/RT]}Eq. 3 where yi is the observed signal, yN and yD are the base-line intercepts corresponding to, respectively, native and denatured proteins, mN and mD are the corresponding base-line slopes, [X]i is the denaturant concentration corresponding to the ith addition, m is the slope of a ΔG unfolding versus [X] plot, R and T are the gas constant and temperature as defined above. [D]50% is the denaturant (GdnHCl) concentration at the midpoint of the transition, in which there is an equal amount of the folded and unfolded protein (Kunfolding = 1). Therefore, from Equation 2, it follows that ΔGH2O=m[D]50%Eq. 4 The change in free energy of unfolding on mutation, ΔΔGH2O, between wild type and mutant HuAtp12 can be calculated from the difference between the ΔGH2O values derived from Equation 4. Miscellaneous Procedures—Citrate synthase activity was measured at 23 °C following the procedure of Srere (16Srere P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2157-2165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception that the buffer was 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The number of free sulfhydryl groups in HuAtp12p was determined with the Ellman reagent, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), using an extinction coefficient at 412 nm of 13,400 m-1 for the 5-nitro-2-thiobenzoate liberated in the reaction as previously described (17Wang Z.G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4887-4894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed the method of Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207129) Google Scholar). Western analysis and detection of immuno-decorated Atp12p by chemiluminescence was as described (5Wang Z.G. Sheluho D. Gatti D.L. Ackerman S.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1486-1493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, protein was estimated using the procedure of Lowry et al. (19Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Emission spectra for excited tryptophans in HuAtp12p were recorded between 300 nm and 400 nm for 1-ml samples of protein in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Purification of Recombinant HuAtp12p—The complete cDNA for HuAtp12p encodes a protein with 289 amino acids, which includes a mitochondrial targeting sequence at the amino terminus (7Wang Z.G. White P.S. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30773-30778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the precursor protein to the mature form is estimated to occur at/near the junction of Thr-32 and Ile-33 following its passage into mitochondria (7Wang Z.G. White P.S. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30773-30778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In previous work we have shown that the polypeptide fragment of HuAtp12p encompassing Ile-33 through Glu-289 closely approximates the true mature form of the protein since this fragment rescues the respiratory defect of a yeast Δatp12 deletion strain and binds to the F1 α subunit in a yeast two-hybrid screen (7Wang Z.G. White P.S. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30773-30778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the present work we have extended our studies of Atp12p function to experiments that explore features of the purified protein. The first step in this project has been to subclone codons 33–289 of HuAtp12p cDNA in a bacterial expression vector to create the plasmid pPROEx/Atp12ph (see “Experimental Procedures”). Induction of expression from pPROEx/Atp12ph leads to high production of His-tagged HuAtp12p (Mr = 32,770) in E. coli (Fig. 1, lane 1) of which 60–70% partitions to the soluble fraction after centrifugation of sonically irradiated cells (Fig. 1, lane 2). The protein is purified to near homogeneity after successive chromatographic steps through DEAE and cobalt columns (Fig. 1, lane 3). Previous work with yeast Atp12p identified a Glu → Lys mutation that inactivates the protein in vivo (8Wang Z.G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2993-3002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To study the effect of this mutation in vitro we performed site-directed mutagenesis of the pPROEx/Atp12ph plasmid insert to convert the corresponding glutamic acid (Glu-240) of HuAtp12p to lysine (see “Experimental Procedures”). Highly pure preparations of the His-tagged mutant protein (HuAtp12pE240K) (Fig. 1, lane 4) are obtained following the same method described above for wild type recombinant HuAtp12p purification. Sedimentation Analysis of HuAtp12p—Samples of purified wild type or mutant HuAtp12p were centrifuged through 7–20% sucrose gradients that were formed on top of an 80% sucrose solution deposited at the bottom of the centrifuge tube. The behavior of both proteins relative to molecular weight standards was found to be similar with a single peak at the predicted location for a 32.7-kDa monomer (Fig. 2). The absence of immunologically detectable signal in fractions 2 and 3 of the gradient shows that there are no large aggregates of HuAtp12p present in the protein preparations, as these would have been trapped at the 20:80% sucrose interface (black arrow). Molecular Chaperone Assays with HuAtp12p—We have proposed that the true substrate of Atp12p in mitochondria is a folded F1 α subunit monomer (5Wang Z.G. Sheluho D. Gatti D.L. Ackerman S.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1486-1493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Atp12p is believed to act by temporarily shielding a hydrophobic element of the α subunit surface that will ultimately be buried at the non-catalytic site interface with an adjacent β subunit of the assembled α3β3 oligomer. To study this activity in vitro we initially tried to obtain recombinant F1 α subunit as a soluble monomer. Because there are no Atp12p homologs in E. coli and there is no evidence from yeast two-hybrid screens of mitochondrial Atp12p interaction with E. coli F1 α, 2D. Sheluho and S. H. Ackerman, unpublished studies.our work was focused on constructing plasmids for the expression of yeast and bovine mitochondrial F1 α. Unfortunately, forms of these recombinant proteins that accumulated either in the cytosol or in the periplasm (via a leader peptide) were not soluble; the former produced inclusion bodies, and the latter were found to be tightly associated with the membrane, requiring harsh alkaline conditions for extraction. 2D. Sheluho and S. H. Ackerman, unpublished studies. Ultimately, efforts to recover the α subunit from urea-denatured inclusion bodies in a conformation that would be bound by Atp12p in vitro were not successful. 2D. Sheluho and S. H. Ackerman, unpublished studies. As for using surrogate protein substrates to study the molecular chaperone activity of HuAtp12p and assess the effect of mutations in vitro, we found that, for example, HuAtp12p did not inhibit the aggregation of reduced insulin b-chains, an assay that had proved particularly useful in assessing in vitro the molecular chaperone activity of yeast Atp11p (20Sheluho D. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39945-39949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Instead, in our screen of potential substrates we identified mitochondrial CS as a suitable client protein for HuAtp12p. CS is a dimeric protein of 2 identical 48-kDa subunits that catalyzes the formation of citric acid and CoA from oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA. In the absence of substrates CS is inactivated and rapidly aggregates after exposure to 43 °C, a property that has made it popular as a model substrate for studies of molecular chaperone activity in vitro (9Jakob U. Lilie H. Meyer I. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7288-7294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 21Bose S. Weikl T. Bugl H. Buchner J.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 23Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C.

Chem. 2002; 277: 46026-46034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We monitored thermally induced aggregation of CS at 43 °C by measuring the apparent fluorescence due to light scattering at 465 nm of solutions containing the enzyme in the absence or presence of other proteins. The presence of wild type HuAtp12p in the mixture has different effects on the CS aggregation phenomenon depending on the molar ratio of molecular chaperone (monomer) relative to CS dimers. At low molar ratios (3:1 and below), the degree of sample light scattering is exacerbated over what is observed for solutions of CS alone (Fig. 3A, data shown for 1:1 and 2:1 ratios). Molar ratios of HuAtp12p:CS in the range of 4:1–7:1 provide conditions under which the rate of CS aggregation is reduced, although the final degree of light scattering is the same as in the absence of HuAtp12p (Fig. 3A, data shown for 4:1 and 5:1 ratios). Raising the level of HuAtp12p to 8-fold molar excess over CS reduces the final level of sample light scattering to ∼40% of the maximum observed in the absence of effector protein (Fig. 3A, open triangles). Increasing the molar ratio of HuAtp12p:CS above 8:1 does not further improve the level of protection (data not shown). The amount of CS and HuAtp12p protein recovered in the particulate fraction after centrifugation of 1:1 and 8:1 protein mixtures exposed to 43 °C is shown in the inset of Fig. 3A. Bovine serum albumin fails to prevent thermally induced aggregation of CS when the effector protein is present at 8-fold or even 16-fold molar excess relative to CS dimers (Fig. 3B). Companion studies examined HuAtp12p for an affect on preventing loss of CS enzymatic activity at 43 °C. We found that the kinetics of CS inactivation is unaltered in the presence of the chaperone (Fig. 3C). In contrast to the wild type protein, the mutant HuAtp12pE240K does not prevent the aggregation of CS at 43 °C when present in an 8-fold molar excess relative to the enzyme dimer concentration in the cuvette (Fig. 4). Increasing the molar ratio to 16:1 increased the time necessary to observe maximal CS aggregation, but the final degree of light-scattering observed for the sample was the same as in the absence of HuAtp12p. Physical Characterization of Wild Type and Mutant HuAtp12p—Several parameters were measured for wild type HuAtp12p and HuAtp12pE240K to determine whether gross alterations of the three-dimensional structure of the two proteins could explain the loss of activity in the mutant. Titration of free sulfhydryl groups with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) gave similar results with both proteins; of the three cysteines in mature HuAtp12p, one is accessible to the reagent under non-denaturing conditions, whereas all three react with the probe after denaturation of either the wild type or mutant protein in 8 m urea. The tryptophan emission spectra of the wild type and mutant proteins were also similar, with no significant difference in the amplitude or wavelength of maximal fluorescence (data not shown). We also examined the recombinant proteins for sensitivity to proteolytic digestion (Fig. 5). Wild type HuAtp12p (Fig. 5, upper panels) and HuAtp12pE240K (Fig. 5, lower panels) were exposed to increasing amounts of trypsin or chymotrypsin and then loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gels to analyze the products of digestion. The digestion patterns for wild type and mutant HuAtp12p are essentially the same. Both proteases yield one principal digestion product of ∼29 kDa, which correlates well with the size of the mature HuAtp12p protein encoded by the expression plasmid. Aminoterminal sequencing of the 29-kDa fragments showed that they result from either trypsin or chymotrypsin cleavage of 7 or 9 amino acids, respectively, downstream from the start of HuAtp12p-coding region (Fig. 5, bottom). Hence, the limited proteolysis only removes the tag sequence at the amino terminus of the recombinant proteins and does not disclose the presence of hypersensitive proteolytic sites in either the wild type or mutant proteins. Chemical Unfolding Studies—GdnHCl denaturation curves were obtained for wild type and mutant HuAtp12p. Purified recombinant protein was incubated with increasing GdnHCl concentrations at 23 °C for 3 h. Exposure to the chaotrope resulted in changes of the intrinsic fluorescence emission from the HuAtp12p proteins that were manifest as"
https://openalex.org/W2004812924,"The locus control region of the β-globin gene cluster has been used previously to direct erythroid expression of globin genes from retroviral vectors for the purpose of gene therapy. Short erythroid regulatory elements represent a potentially valuable alternative to the locus control region. Among them, the GATA-1 enhancer HS2 was used to replace the retroviral enhancer within the 3′-long terminal repeat (LTR) of the retroviral vector SFCM, converting it into an erythroid-specific regulatory element. In this work, we have functionally studied an additional GATA-1 enhancer, HS1. HS1 participates in the transcriptional autoregulation of GATA-1 through an essential GATA-binding site that is footprinted in vivo. In this work we identified within HS1 a new in vivo footprinted region, and we showed that this sequence indeed binds a nuclear protein in vitro. Addition of HS1 to HS2 within the LTR of SFCM significantly improves the expression of a reporter gene. The deletion of the newly identified footprinted sequence in the retroviral construct further increases expression up to a level almost equal to that of the wild type retroviral LTR, without loss of erythroid specificity, suggesting that this sequence may act as a negative regulatory element. An improved vector backbone, MΔN, allows even better expression from the new GATA cassette. These results suggest that substantial improvement of overall expression can be achieved by the combination of multiple changes in both regulatory elements and vectors.

As GATA-2 is expressed in a wider range of cell types than GATA-1, this implies that other regulatory elements are necessary for appropriate GATA-1 regulation. Sequences relevant for this additional level of regulation have not yet been fully characterized. Regulatory elements of erythroid genes have been employed in retroviral vectors to express, in model systems, globin genes for therapeutic purposes. In particular, the locus control region (LCR) of the human β-globin cluster, which confers high level, position-independent, erythroid expression of globin genes, gave encouraging initial results (17May C.

These short elements might thus provide a valuable alternative to LCR for the development of new vectors (23Russell D. Blood. 2001; 98: 2595-2596Crossref Google Scholar). In this context, the characterization of additional control elements conferring high levels of specific expression is essential for vector optimization. Among the enhancers studied, the GATA-1 HS2 element showed significant activity both in retroviral and lentiviral vectors (19Grande A. Piovani B. Aiuti A. Ottolenghi S. Mavilio F. Ferrari G.

By adding HS1 to HS2 within the retroviral LTR and by deleting an inhibitory sequence within HS1, we obtained retroviruses that express downstream reporter genes at similar efficiencies as those retaining the wild type LTR, without loss of erythroid specificity.

The sequence in boldface type in the wild type oligonucleotide corresponds to the in vivo footprinted region (see “Results”) and is deleted in the Δ59-69oligo. Underlined nucleotides represent the mutated sites. Retroviral Constructs—The retroviral vectors SFCM, containing an intact Moloney enhancer and its derivative Δ·SFCM (in which the 3′-LTR enhancer is deleted), have been described previously (19Grande A. Piovani B. Aiuti A. Ottolenghi S. Mavilio F. Ferrari G. Blood. 1999; 93 (and references therein): 3276-3285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HS2 site of the mouse GATA-1 gene was inserted in place of the deleted enhancer into the Δ·SFCM vector to generate GATA·SFCM (19Grande A. Piovani B. Aiuti A. Ottolenghi S. Mavilio F. Ferrari G. Blood. 1999; 93 (and references therein): 3276-3285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), here renamed as HS2·SFCM. Additional constructs were generated by inserting appropriate HS1 fragments into either Δ·SFCM or HS2·SFCM. The genomic 461-nt BamHI BglII HS1 fragment (14Ronchi A. Ciro M. Cairns L. Basilico L. Corbella P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Cross M. Ghysdael J. Ottolenghi S. Genes Funct. 1997; 1: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was modified with XhoI linkers and cloned into the compatible SalI site in the Δ·SFCM LTR polylinker, 10 nt upstream to the SnaBI site where HS2 was originally cloned. In the constructs carrying both HS1 and HS2, HS1 was inserted in the same SalI site into the HS2·SFCM vector to generate HS1·HS2·SFCM. All HS1 mutants (see the above oligonucleotides for mutations) were generated by PCR and sequenced to confirm the mutation. In the HS1GATA-·HS2·SFCM vector the HS1 GATA-1-binding site at positions 130-136 (14Ronchi A. Ciro M. Cairns L. Basilico L. Corbella P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Cross M. Ghysdael J. Ottolenghi S. Genes Funct. 1997; 1: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was changed from CTTATC to CTTAAA. The LGSΔN vector was derived by replacing the TKNeoR sequence in the SFCMM-3 vector (29Verzeletti S. Bonini C. Marktel S. Nobili N. Ciceri F. Traversari C. Bordignon C. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 2243-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) with the 730-bp Eco47III-ScaI EGFP fragment from pEGFP-C3 (Clontech). HS2·LGSΔN was obtained by cloning the BamHI 200-bp GATA-1 HS2 cassette (19Grande A. Piovani B. Aiuti A. Ottolenghi S. Mavilio F. Ferrari G. Blood. 1999; 93 (and references therein): 3276-3285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into the SalI/BglII sites of LGSΔN, whereas ΔHS1·HS2·LGSΔN was derived by ClaI/NdeI digestion of the ΔHS1·HS2 elements from the ΔHS1·HS2·SFCM vector and cloning into ClaI/NdeI sites of LGSΔN. Cells—GATA-1 ts Epo bone marrow (BM) and GATA-1 ts Epo YS (yolk sac) are erythropoietin (Epo)-dependent immortalized hematopoietic progenitors derived from bone marrow and yolk sac of mice transgenic for a mutant SV40 T gene encoding a thermosensitive T protein driven by the GATA-1 promoter linked to either the HS2 or the HS1 sites, respectively (11Cairns L.A.

These cells grow at 32 °C, the permissive temperature for the thermosensitive T protein with a doubling time of 20-24 h, in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 0.3 unit/ml Epo. Transduction of Mouse and Human Cell Lines—For transduction of mouse cells, packaging lines for SFCM vectors were obtained by plasmid transfection of the ecotropic line GP+E86 (31Markowitz D. Goff S. Bank A. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and selection in 0.8 mg/ml G418. For viral infections, subconfluent packaging lines were treated with mitomycin C (1 μg/ml) for 3 h at 37 °C, carefully washed, and replated (1 × 106 cells) into 6-cm diameter dishes in 3 ml of RPMI 1640, 10% FCS. The next day, 0.6-1 × 106 mouse hematopoietic cells in 1 ml of complete Epo-containing medium were added to each dish and grown for 24 h at 32 °C. The hematopoietic cells growing in suspension were collected, washed, and grown for 2 days prior to selection. G418 was then added at 0.8 mg/ml, and resistant cells were obtained within 10-15 days. Selected cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry (see below). For each infection, the copy number of constructs integrated within the resistant cells was evaluated by Southern blotting by using a probe for the neomycin resistance gene and checked for equal loading by further probing with a genomic fragment downstream of the GATA-1 locus. The copy numbers were essentially identical between all samples and close to one integration (on average) per cell (as determined by comparison with serial dilutions of appropriately digested viral DNA mixed with genomic DNA of non-infected cells). NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS (Hyclone) and infected for 16 h with undiluted viral supernatants containing 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). Further analyses were carried out on transduced and control bulk cultures. For transduction of human cells viral stocks were produced by transient transfection of Phoenix-Ampho cells as described previously (32Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Human erythroblastic K562 and HEL cell lines (ATCC) were grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS and transduced by spinoculation (33Sanyal A. Schuening F.G. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 2859-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) in the presence of Polybrene (8 μg/ml). For transduction of mouse hematopoietic cells with LSGΔN and MΔN viral stocks, spinoculation was used as above. FACS Analysis—Expression of the reporter gene (ΔLNGFr) was monitored by flow cytometry (FACScan, BD Biosciences) using the murine anti-human p75-NGFr monoclonal antibody 20-4 (ATCC). A goat monoclonal anti-mouse IgG (Fab-specific) conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate or phycoerythrin was used as secondary antibody (Pharmingen). An “In Vivo” Footprint in GATA HS1—DNA fragments from the HS1 region of the mouse GATA-1 gene have been shown previously to have enhancer activity, when linked to the GATA-1 promoter alone or in combination with HS2 and other GATA-1 regulatory elements, in transient transfections, and in transgenic assays (13McDevitt M.A. Fujiwara Y.

Biol. 2000; 20: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The activity of HS1 is totally dependent on a strong GATA-1-binding site (14Ronchi A. Ciro M. Cairns L. Basilico L. Corbella P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Cross M. Ghysdael J. Ottolenghi S. Genes Funct. 1997; 1: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 15Vyas P. McDevitt M.A. Cantor A.B. Katz S.G. Fujiara Y. Orkin S.H.

Biol. 2000; 20: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) that appears to be occupied in vivo, as indicated by in vivo footprinting (14Ronchi A. Ciro M. Cairns L. Basilico L. Corbella P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Cross M. Ghysdael J. Ottolenghi S. Genes Funct. 1997; 1: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To identify additional functional motifs within HS1, we further extended the dimethyl sulfate (DMS) in vivo footprinting analysis of HS1 (Fig. 1A). Transcription factors bound to specific DNA sequences protect guanines from in vivo DMS-induced methylation and thus from subsequent in vitro piperidine cleavage of the methylated sites. The following ligation-mediated PCR results in the absence of bands at the positions corresponding to the guanines protected “in vivo” (24Becker P.B. Weih F. Schutz G. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 568-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 25Quivy J.P. Becker P.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2779-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows that six guanines (lower strand) within an 11-nt sequence between positions 59 and 69 of HS1 are footprinted “in vivo” in hematopoietic mouse erythroleukemia cells (MEL) grown in culture; a weaker footprint is also detected on the CACCC motif between positions 78 and 82 (not shown). In Vitro Binding Studies of the Footprinted Region—To better characterize proteins responsible for the in vivo footprint, we performed EMSA. A 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (wt, see “Experimental Procedures”) spanning from nt 46 to 96 generates a complex pattern consisting of an intense slow band and additional faster bands in the presence of nuclear extracts from the hematopoietic cell lines: human K562 erythroleukemia cells, murine GATA-1 ts Epo BM, and GATA-1 ts Epo YS cells (30Cairns L. Cirò M. Minuzzo M. Morlé F. Starck J. Ottolenghi S. Ronchi A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 195: 38-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), (Fig. 2); however, when an oligonucleotide deleted between nucleotides 59 and 69 (Δ59-69)is used, one of these bands is clearly missing (Fig. 2B, arrow, compare lanes 1 and 2). The protein responsible for this band will be called from now on the GATA-1 HS1 “in vivo footprinting protein” (IVFP). As expected, unlabeled oligonucleotides including a CACCC box sequence from the human β-globin gene and the GC-rich region (positions 81-111) from the HS1 itself compete all bands, with the exception of the IVFP band (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4 and lanes 7 and 8); an unrelated control oligonucleotide has no effect (lanes 5 and 6). We further tested two additional oligonucleotides (Fig. 2): “core mutant” carries mutations centered on nucleotides involved in the in vivo footprint, whereas the “5′ mutant” is mutated at the upstream border of the footprinted region (see “Experimental Procedures” for sequences). The mutation in oligonucleotide core mutant (Fig. 2B, lane 4) has the same effect as the deletion of nucleotides 59-69, i.e. loss of IVFP binding, whereas the upstream mutation in oligonucleotide 5′ mutant does not significantly affect IVFP binding (Fig. 2B, lane 3). To better resolve the IVFP band, we used in EMSA experiments poly(dC·dG) as a competitor, instead of poly(dI·dC) (Fig. 2B, lanes 5-18). Under these conditions, only the IVFP band is visible (lane 5) with the wt oligonucleotide and is efficiently competed by the unlabeled wt oligonucleotide itself (Fig. 2B, lanes 6-8) and by the 5′ mutant oligonucleotide (lanes 12-14) but not by the deleted (lanes 9-11) or core mutant (lanes 15-17) oligonucleotides. The IVFP protein appears to be relatively widespread, although its amount varies between different cell types. In particular, it is expressed in both mouse and human cells, particularly in human K562 and mouse erythroleukemia MEL cells, in SV40-T immortalized bone marrow (GATA-1 ts Epo, BM) and yolk sac (GATA-1 ts Epo, YS) erythropoietin-dependent cells (11Cairns L.A. Crotta S. Minuzzo M. Moroni E. Granucci F. Nicolis S. Schiro R. Pozzi L. Giglioni B. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Ottolenghi S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4577-4586Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 30Cairns L. Cirò M. Minuzzo M. Morlé F. Starck J. Ottolenghi S. Ronchi A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 195: 38-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar),2 and in lymphoid cells (CH27, A20, and BAF3) (Fig. 2C and data not shown). By using mutant oligonucleotides with these extracts, we obtained results similar to those shown for K562 (data not shown). HS1 DNA Sequences Co-operate with HS2 in Retrovirally Mediated Gene Expression in Hematopoietic Cells—To analyze functional effects of the HS1 DNA sequences, we used a modified SFCM retroviral vector, as described previously (19Grande A. Piovani B. Aiuti A. Ottolenghi S. Mavilio F. Ferrari G. Blood. 1999; 93 (and references therein): 3276-3285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this vector, the Moloney-leukemia virus enhancer in the 3′-LTR is deleted (Δ·SFCM) and can be replaced by an exogenous enhancer; following retroviral infection of the target cells, the new enhancer is moved to the 5′-LTR from which it drives retroviral transcription and expression of a truncated form of nerve growth factor receptor (ΔLNGFr), a reporter gene. In addition, an internal SV40 promoter drives the expression of a neomycin resistance gene (Fig. 3A). Our strategy was therefore to infect in vitro hematopoietic cell lines with appropriate constructs and to select cells expressing the neo-resistance gene by G418 treatment. Following complete selection, the proportion of expressing cells and levels of expression were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The copy number of integrated constructs was examined by Southern blotting using a neo-resistance probe (for the detection of the retroviral DNA) and a GATA-1 3′ genomic probe for detection of an endogenous gene and normalization. The copy numbers were very similar between the various constructs and close to 1 copy per cell, as expected for the relatively low probability of infection in these experiments (between 25 and 50% of cells transduced). For these experiments, we primarily used two cell lines, GATA-1 ts Epo (BM) and GATA-1 ts Epo (YS) (11Cairns L.A. Crotta S. Minuzzo M. Moroni E. Granucci F. Nicolis S. Schiro R. Pozzi L. Giglioni B. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Ottolenghi S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4577-4586Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 30Cairns L. Cirò M. Minuzzo M. Morlé F. Starck J. Ottolenghi S. Ronchi A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 195: 38-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar),2 which represent erythropoietin-dependent multipotent cells derived from bone marrow and yolk sac cells immortalized in vitro by SV40 T-antigen (driven by a transgenic GATA-1 promoter linked to HS2 or HS1 respectively). These cells are 95-100% positive for endogenous GATA-1 (based on nuclear immunofluorescence tests) (30Cairns L. Cirò M. Minuzzo M. Morlé F. Starck J. Ottolenghi S. Ronchi A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 195: 38-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and are thus expected to express foreign constructs depending on GATA regulatory elements. In a first series of experiments (Fig. 3B), we compared the activities of retroviral constructs (HS1·SFCM and HS2·SFCM) containing HS1 or HS2 as the foreign enhancer replacing the original Moloney enhancer. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of cells infected with the wild type SFCM is given as 100% activity. The MFI of each construct is given below as percentage of activity relative to that of the"
