https://openalex.org/W1969408132,"Calorie restriction extends lifespan in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals1. In yeast, the SIR2 gene mediates the life-extending effects of calorie restriction2. Here we show that the mammalian SIR2 orthologue, Sirt1 (sirtuin 1), activates a critical component of calorie restriction in mammals; that is, fat mobilization in white adipocytes. Upon food withdrawal Sirt1 protein binds to and represses genes controlled by the fat regulator PPAR-γ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ), including genes mediating fat storage. Sirt1 represses PPAR-γ by docking with its cofactors NCoR (nuclear receptor co-repressor) and SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors). Mobilization of fatty acids from white adipocytes upon fasting is compromised in Sirt1+/- mice. Repression of PPAR-γ by Sirt1 is also evident in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, where overexpression of Sirt1 attenuates adipogenesis, and RNA interference of Sirt1 enhances it. In differentiated fat cells, upregulation of Sirt1 triggers lipolysis and loss of fat. As a reduction in fat is sufficient to extend murine lifespan3, our results provide a possible molecular pathway connecting calorie restriction to life extension in mammals."

https://openalex.org/W2129033519,"In the copper oxide parent compounds of the high-transition-temperature superconductors1 the valence electrons are localized—one per copper site—by strong intra-atomic Coulomb repulsion. A symptom of this localization is antiferromagnetism2, where the spins of localized electrons alternate between up and down. Superconductivity appears when mobile ‘holes’ are doped into this insulating state, and it coexists with antiferromagnetic fluctuations3. In one approach to describing the coexistence, the holes are believed to self-organize into ‘stripes’ that alternate with antiferromagnetic (insulating) regions within copper oxide planes4, which would necessitate an unconventional mechanism of superconductivity5. There is an apparent problem with this picture, however: measurements of magnetic excitations in superconducting YBa2Cu3O6+x near optimum doping6 are incompatible with the naive expectations7,8 for a material with stripes. Here we report neutron scattering measurements on stripe-ordered La1.875Ba0.125CuO4. We show that the measured excitations are, surprisingly, quite similar to those in YBa2Cu3O6+x (refs 9, 10) (that is, the predicted spectrum of magnetic excitations7,8 is wrong). We find instead that the observed spectrum can be understood within a stripe model by taking account of quantum excitations. Our results support the concept that stripe correlations are essential to high-transition-temperature superconductivity11."

https://openalex.org/W1976842211,"Catalase plays a major role in cellular antioxidant defense by decomposing hydrogen peroxide, thereby preventing the generation of hydroxyl radical by the Fenton reaction. The degree of catalase deficiency in acatalasemic and hypocatalasemic mice varies from tissue to tissue. They therefore may not be suitable for studying the function of this enzyme in certain models of oxidant-mediated tissue injury. We sought to generate a new line of catalase null mice by the gene targeting technique. The mouse catalase (Cat or Cas1) gene was disrupted by replacing parts of intron 4 and exon 5 with a neomycin resistance cassette. Homozygous Cat knockout mice, which are completely deficient in catalase expression, develop normally and show no gross abnormalities. Slices of liver and lung and lenses from the knockout mice exhibited a retarded rate in decomposing extracellular hydrogen peroxide compared with those of wild-type mice. However, mice deficient in catalase were not more vulnerable to hyperoxia-induced lung injury; nor did their lenses show any increased susceptibility to oxidative stress generated by photochemical reaction, suggesting that the antioxidant function of catalase in these two models of oxidant injury is negligible. Further studies showed that cortical injury from physical impact caused a significant decrease in NAD-linked electron transfer activities and energy coupling capacities in brain mitochondria of Cat knockout mice but not wild-type mice. The observed decrease in efficiency of mitochondrial respiration may be a direct result of an increase in mitochondrion-associated calcium, which is secondary to the increased oxidative stress. These studies suggest that the role of catalase in antioxidant defense is dependent on the type of tissue and the model of oxidant-mediated tissue injury.

Catalase (EC 1.11.1.6; H2O2 oxidoreductase) is a heme-containing homotetrameric protein (for a review, see Ref. 1Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Google Scholar). Catalase can decompose hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in reactions catalyzed by two different modes of enzymatic activity: the catalatic mode of activity (2H2O2 → O2 + 2H2O) and the peroxidatic mode of activity (H2O2 + AH2 → A + 2H2O) (2Keilin D. Hartree E.F. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1936; 119: 141-159Google Scholar, 3Keilin D. Hartree E.F. Biochem. J. 1945; 39: 293-301Google Scholar, 4Oshino N. Oshino R. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 555-556Google Scholar). Although several substrates such as methanol and ethanol can be oxidized by the peroxidation reaction, the physiological significance of this catalase function is not understood. Decomposition of H2O2 by the catalatic activity of catalase follows the fashion of a first-order reaction, and its rate is dependent on the concentration of H2O2. In fact, catalase belongs to the group of enzymes that catalyze reactions at a rate near kinetic perfection; the reaction rate is only limited by the rate at which the enzyme collides with the substrate (5Berg J.M. Tymoczko J.L. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 5th Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York2002: 205-206Google Scholar). Catalase is ubiquitously present in all prokaryotes and eukaryotes. With the exception of erythrocytes, it is predominantly located in peroxisomes of all types of mammalian cells where H2O2 is generated by various oxidases (6Bosch V.D.H. Schutgens R.B.H. Wanders R.J.A. Tager J.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 157-197Google Scholar). However, a certain amount of catalase has also been found in mitochondria of rat heart (7Radi R. Turrens J.F. Chang L.Y. Bush K.M. Crapo J.D. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22028-22034Google Scholar). Since H2O2 serves as a substrate for Fenton reaction to generate the highly reactive hydroxyl radical, catalase is believed to play a role in cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms by limiting the accumulation of H2O2.The role of catalase in defending cells and tissues against oxidative stress has been studied extensively. As expected, overexpression of catalase renders cells more resistant to toxicity of H2O2 and oxidant-mediated injury from exposure to hyperoxia (8Lindau-Shepard B.A. Shaffer J.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 15: 581-588Google Scholar, 9Erzurum S.C. Lemarchand P. Rosenfeld M.A. Yoo J.-H. Crystal R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1607-1612Google Scholar, 10Yoo J.H. Erzurum S.C. Hay J.G. Lemarchand P. Crystal R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 297-302Google Scholar). In addition, transgenic mice overexpressing catalase are protected against myocardial injury following administration of adriamycin and development of hypertension from treatment with norepinephrine or angiotension (11Kang Y.J. Chen Y. Epstein P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12610-12616Google Scholar, 12Yang H. Shi M.J. Van Remmen H. Chen X.L. Vijg J. Richardson A. Guo Z.M. Am. J. Hypertens. 2003; 16: 1-5Google Scholar). On the other hand, no catalase-mediated protection for the heart against adriamycin toxicity is evident in certain lines of transgenic mice in which catalase is extensively overexpressed (11Kang Y.J. Chen Y. Epstein P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12610-12616Google Scholar). Furthermore, mouse L cells and rat aortic smooth muscle cells overexpressing catalase display heightened oxidant sensitivity and retarded growth with increased cell death, respectively, compared with the corresponding parental cells (13Speranza M.J. Bagley A.C. Lynch R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19039-19043Google Scholar, 14Brown M.R. Miller Jr., F.J. Li W.G. Ellingson A.N. Mozena J.D. Chatterjee P. Engelhardt J.F. Zwacka R.M. Oberley L.W. Fang X. Spector A.A. Weintraub N.L. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 524-533Google Scholar). Since H2O2 is known to control cell proliferation through modulation of cell signaling (15Rhee S.G. Chang T.S. Bae Y.S. Lee S.R. Kang S.W. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: S211-S215Google Scholar), whether overexpression of catalase further down-regulates the physiological level of H2O2 and thereby perturbs essential cellular function in these transfected cells and transgenic mouse heart remains to be investigated.Catalase deficiency in humans was first documented by Dr. Takahara in 1946 (16Takahara S. Miyamoto H. Jpn. J. Otol. 1948; 51: 163-164Google Scholar). Japanese acatalasemic patients are phenotypically normal with the exception of an increased tendency in development of progressive oral gangrene, presumably as a result of tissue damage from H2O2 produced by peroxide-generating bacteria such as streptococci and pneumococci as well as by the phagocytic cells at the sites of bacterial infection (for a review, see Ref. 17Eaton J.W. Ma M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2371-2383Google Scholar). In addition, several independent lines of mutant mice with decreased blood catalase activity were initially discovered by Feinstein and colleagues from the progeny of x-ray-irradiated mice (18Feinstein R.N. Howard J.B. Braun J.T. Seaholm J.E. Genetics. 1966; 53: 923-933Google Scholar). The catalase activities in blood of acatalasemic (Csb) and hypocatalasemic (Csc) mice are 1.1-2.4 and 16-20% of that of wild-type mice, respectively (18Feinstein R.N. Howard J.B. Braun J.T. Seaholm J.E. Genetics. 1966; 53: 923-933Google Scholar, 19Feinstein R.N. Braun J.T. Howard J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1967; 120: 165-169Google Scholar). Missense mutations in the catalase gene of these mice leading to amino acid substitutions (Q11H in acatalasemic mice and N439S in hypocatalasemic mice) are believed to contribute to the observed decreases in catalase activitiy (20Shaffer J.B. Preston K.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 1043-1050Google Scholar, 21Wang D.-H. Tsutsui K. Sano K. Masuoka N. Kira S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1522: 217-220Google Scholar). The tissues of acatalasemic mice apparently express normal levels of catalase mRNA compared with those of wild-type mice. However, the severity of catalase deficiency in these mice varies from tissue to tissue (22Shaffer B.J. Sutton R.B. Bewley G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12908-12911Google Scholar). Further studies suggest that the Q11H substitution may destablize the tetrameric structure of catalase, thereby making it more vulnerable to protease-mediated degradation (21Wang D.-H. Tsutsui K. Sano K. Masuoka N. Kira S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1522: 217-220Google Scholar, 22Shaffer B.J. Sutton R.B. Bewley G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12908-12911Google Scholar, 23Aebi H. Suter H. Feinstein R.N. Biochem. Genet. 1968; 2: 245-251Google Scholar, 24Jones G.L. Masters C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 173: 463-471Google Scholar, 25Suzuki K. Ogata M. Acta Med. Okayama. 1991; 45: 363-369Google Scholar). Expression of the catalase gene in tissues of hypocatalasemic mice is less well studied (18Feinstein R.N. Howard J.B. Braun J.T. Seaholm J.E. Genetics. 1966; 53: 923-933Google Scholar, 19Feinstein R.N. Braun J.T. Howard J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1967; 120: 165-169Google Scholar). Current results indicate that catalaseN439S is more labile to heat and exhibits a decreased specificity activity compared with wild-type catalase (21Wang D.-H. Tsutsui K. Sano K. Masuoka N. Kira S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1522: 217-220Google Scholar, 26Feinstein R.N. Sacher G.A. Howard J.B. Braun J.T. Arch. Biochem. Biphys. 1967; 122: 338-343Google Scholar, 27Feinstein R.N. Braun J.T. Howard J.B. Biochem. Genet. 1968; 1: 277-285Google Scholar, 28Feinstein R.N. Suter H. Jaroslow B.N. Science. 1968; 159: 638-640Google Scholar). The residual catalase activities in tissues of acatalasemic and hypocatalasemic mice make them less applicable as models for understanding the function of this enzyme in oxidant biology and disease.To circumvent the limitations associated with the current models of catalase-deficient mice, we generated a line of catalase null mice using the gene targeting technique. Mice completely deficient in catalase develop normally and are apparently healthy. In addition, although tissues of catalase knockout mice show a retarded rate in consuming extracellular H2O2, the mice are not more susceptible to hyperoxia-induced lung injury and lens damage from oxidative stress generated by photochemical reaction compared with wild-type mice. However, brain mitochondria of these mice are more vulnerable to trauma-induced impairment in oxidative phosphorylation than those of wild-type mice. This new model of acatalasemic mice will be valuable for understanding the function of catalase in defending animals against oxidant-mediated tissue injury as well as in modulation of cell signaling pathways.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTargeted Disruption of the Mouse Catalase Gene—Custom PCR screening of a mouse 129SV genomic library constructed in bacterial artificial chromosomes was performed by Incyte Genomics (St. Louis, MO) using two sets of primers designed for amplifying exons 2 and 7 (29Reimer D.L. Bailley J. Singh S.M. Genomics. 1994; 21: 325-336Google Scholar). Two independent genomic clones (clones 22957 and 22958) were isolated. Further restriction mapping and Southern blot analysis suggested that these two bacterial artificial chromosome clones were identical (data not shown). Two BamHI genomic DNA fragments from the bacterial artificial chromosome clone were then subcloned into vector pKS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The structures of these two genomic DNA fragments were determined by DNA sequencing and restriction mapping. The results showed that the 5.8-kb BamHI genomic DNA fragment contains exons 2-4 and the 6.9-kb BamHI genomic DNA fragment part of exons 5-8 of the mouse Cat gene (Fig. 1A).To construct the targeting vector, the BamHI-EcoRI fragment containing part of exon 5 and exon 6 was first cloned into vector pKS. The 5′ end BamHI restriction site was then disrupted by ligation of the BamHI-digested plasmid that was blunt-ended with Klenow fragment. The genomic fragment was subsequently released from the resultant plasmid by digestion with restriction enzymes XbaI (which is located in the multiple cloning sites of pKS vector) and EcoRI and ligated into the corresponding restriction sites in vector pPNT (30Tybulewicz V.C.J. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.T. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Google Scholar). The BamHI fragment containing exons 2-4 was released from the pKS vector by digestion with NotI and SalI (which are located in the multiple cloning sites of pKS vector) and cloned into the NotI and XhoI sites of pPNT containing the 3′ arm (part of exons 5 and 6) of the catalase gene. The targeting vector was linearized by NotI digestion and transfected into R1 embryonic stem cells (31Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Google Scholar). Two homologous recombinant clones (clones 422 and 465) of embryonic stem cells were identified from 600 clones screened by Southern blot analysis and microinjected into C57BL/6 blastocysts following the standard protocol (32Bradley A. Roberston E.J. Tetratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1987: 113-151Google Scholar). Furthermore, germ line transmission of the targeted allele was achieved by the chimeric mice derived from either of the clones. Heterozygous knockout mice were interbred to generate homozygous knockout mice.Preparation of Tissue Samples for Gene Expression Studies—Tissues from wild-type (Cat+/+), heterozygous Cat knockout (Cat+/-), and homozygous Cat knockout (Cat-/-) mice were homogenized in guanidinium isothiocyanate solution, and total RNA was isolated according to the method described by Chirgwin et al. (33Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Google Scholar). Thirty micrograms of total RNA were denatured with glyoxal and subjected to blot analysis according to the procedures described by Thomas (34Thomas P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5201-5205Google Scholar). For enzyme activity assays, the mouse tissues were homogenized in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 3% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with a Polytron homogenizer, followed by sonication. The homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min and stored at -70 °C before use in enzyme activity assays. Protein concentrations of tissue homogenates were determined by the use of a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce).Activity Assays for Antioxidant Enzymes—The activity of catalase was determined by following decomposition of 10 mm H2O2 in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, through monitoring the linear decrease of absorbance at 240 nm for 30 s (35Aebi H. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 121-126Google Scholar). The amounts of H2O2 decomposed by calatase were calculated using the millimolar extinction coefficient of H2O2 (ϵ240 = 0.0436). Total glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) 1The abbreviations used are: Gpx, glutathione peroxidase; Gpx1, cellular Gpx; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOD, superoxide distmuase; CuZn-SOD, copper-zinc SOD; Mn-SOD, manganese-SOD; CCII, cotrolled cortical impact injury; TBI, traumatic brain injury; RCI, respiratory control index; P/O ratio, ADP/O ratio; TEMED, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine. activity was determined using hydrogen peroxide as substrate in a reaction coupled to NADPH oxidation in the presence of sodium azide to inhibit the activity of catalase (36Flohé L. Günzler W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 114-121Google Scholar).Staining of Enzyme Activities of Catalase, Gpx, Copper-Zinc Superoxide Dismutase (CuZn-SOD), and Manganese Superoxide Dismutase (Mn-SOD) in a Polyacrylamide Gel—Tissue activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, CuZn-SOD, and Mn-SOD were also monitored by direct staining of enzyme activity in a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (37Sun Y. Elwell J.H. Oberley L.W. Free Radic. Res. Commmun. 1988; 5: 67-75Google Scholar, 38Beauchamp C. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of tissue proteins from Cat+/+, Cat+/-, and Cat-/- mice were initially separated on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide (7.5% for catalase and Gpx assays and 10% for SOD assay) gel. For staining of catalase or Gpx activity, the gel was initially soaked in water or 1 mm reduced glutathione, respectively, and the substrate (0.003% hydrogen peroxide for catalase or 0.008% cumene hydroperoxide for Gpx) was then added. The gel was washed and stained in a solution of 1% ferric chloride and 1% potassium ferricyanide. The regions of the gel with catalase or glutathione peroxidase activity were stained with a yellow or white color, respectively, and the other regions were stained with a dark green or blue color. For straining of SOD activity, the gel was initially incubated in 0.001% riboflavin and 0.0003% TEMED, followed by soaking in 0.2% nitro blue tetrazolium (38Beauchamp C. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Google Scholar). Reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium by superoxide anion radical forms a blue precipitate. Removal of superoxide anion radical by SODs results in an achromatic area on the gel. The native Mn-SOD migrates slower on the gel than does CuZn-SOD. The stained gel was documented using an EPSON EXPRESSION™ 1600 Color Image Scanner.Consumption of Extracellular H2O2by Liver and Lung Slices—The mice were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital, and liver and lung were perfused free of blood through the left ventricle. The tissues were then cut into 0.75-mm slices using a McIlwain tissue chopper (Surrey, UK). The thickness of tissue has been found to exhibit the maximum rate of oxygen consumption (39Freeman B. O'Neil J. Environ. Health Perspect. 1984; 56: 51-60Google Scholar). H2O2 is capable of diffusing freely through the cells. Ten milligrams of liver or lung slices from Cat+/+, Cat+/-, and Cat-/- mice were incubated at 37 °C in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 55.5 mm glucose (PBS-G) with constant shaking. Ten microliters of stock H2O2 were then added to PBS-G to reach an initial concentration of H2O2 at 10, 40, or 300 μm. The concentrations of H2O2 in PBS-G at different incubation times were determined by the quantitative fluorometric assay (40Hyslop P.A. Sklar L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 280-286Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of supernatant were removed at each time point and added into 0.2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.076 mg/ml of horseradish peroxidase and 1.56 mmp-hydroxyphenylacetic acid in a well of a 96-well plate. The extent of fluorescence at 400 nm excited by 323 nm of light was measured using the SPECTRAmax® GEMINI Dual-Scanning Microplate Spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Following the measurement, 10 μl of known concentration of H2O2 were added into the same well, and the reading was taken again. The concentrations of H2O2 in samples were calculated by comparing the intensities of sample fluorescence with those of the added H2O2. During the studies, we found that the lowest detectable concentration of H2O2 was around 1 μm; therefore, any data below this limit were discarded. The rates of H2O2 decomposition were calculated by linear regression using the GraphPad Prism software version 3.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Differences in the rates of degrading H2O2 (estimated from the slop of each curve in Fig. 3) by lung or liver slices of Cat+/+, Cat+/-, and Cat-/- mice at each concentration of H2O2 were first assessed by one-way analysis of variance. Comparison between the rates of H2O2 decomposition by any two samples was performed by Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test.Fig. 3Decomposition of extracellular hydrogen peroxide by lung and liver slices of Cat+/+, Cat+/-, and Cat-/-mice. Consumption of H2O2 by lung (A) and liver (B) slices was determined at initial concentrations of H2O2 at 10, 40, and 300 μm. +/+, +/-, and -/-, tissues harvested from Cat+/+, Cat+/-, and Cat-/- mice, respectively. The rates of H2O2 decomposition are summarized in Table II. n > 6 for each experiment. Values are mean ± S.E. *, p < 0.01 versus lung slices of Cat+/- or Cat-/- mice at the same initial concentrations of H2O2. †, p < 0.001 when comparing the same tissues from any two groups of mice with different genotypes in the Cat allele at the same initial concentrations of H2O2. ‡, p < 0.001 versus liver slices of Cat+/+ or Cat+/- mice at 10 μm H2O2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Hyperoxic Exposure of Mice—The Cat+/+, Cat+/-, and Cat-/- mice at 10 weeks of age were used in exposure to >99% oxygen in polystyrene chambers. The oxygen concentration varied less than 2%, and CO2 concentration was maintained less than 5% by providing ∼12 complete gas exchanges/h. During the exposure, food and water ad libitum were provided, and the mice were kept under a 12-h on, 12-h off light cycle at all times. The mice were sacrificed at 72 h of exposure by overdose of pentobarbital, and the lungs were isolated. The left lobe was gently blotted dry with a piece of paper towel, and the total weight (wet weight) was measured. The lungs were then dried at 80 °C under vacuum overnight and weighed again for measuring the dry weight.Exposure of Lens to Oxidative Stress Generated by Photochemical Reaction—The method for quantifying damage in animal lens following exposure to photochemically induced oxidative stress has been previously described (41Spector A. Wang G.-M. Wang R.-R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7485-7489Google Scholar, 42Spector A. Wang G.-M. Wang R.-R. Garner W.H. Moll H. Curr. Eye Res. 1993; 12: 163-179Google Scholar, 43Spector A. Yang Y. Ho Y.-S. Magnenat J.-L. Wang R.-R. Ma W. Li W.-C. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 521-540Google Scholar). Briefly, lenses were removed from the eyes of Cat+/+ and Cat-/- mice immediately following sacrifice. The lenses were then incubated overnight in 1 ml of medium 199 at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Only lenses that were completely transparent were used in the study. Each lens was placed in 300 μl of medium 199 containing 1.5 μm riboflavin in a well of a 96-well plate and then incubated for 10 min in 4% O2, 5% CO2, and 91% N2 at 35-37 °C in an air-tight acrylic box. The photochemical stress was initiated by turning on two 15-watt daylight lamps 8 inches above the top of the enclosure. The control lenses were incubated in the same medium but without exposure to light. Previous studies have shown that the photochemical reaction used generates mainly superoxide anion radical and H2O2 and to a much lesser extent hydroxyl radical (41Spector A. Wang G.-M. Wang R.-R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7485-7489Google Scholar). In addition, development of opacity in lenses following photochemical stress could be prevented by the addition of exogenous catalase, suggesting the pathogenic role of H2O2 in this model of cataract (42Spector A. Wang G.-M. Wang R.-R. Garner W.H. Moll H. Curr. Eye Res. 1993; 12: 163-179Google Scholar).At the end of 5 h of exposure, the medium was replaced by 200 μl of medium 199 containing 30 μCi of [3H]thymidine and incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 2 h. The lenses were then washed with medium 199 and homogenized in 5% trichloroacetic acid. The trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity was counted. For measuring choline uptake, [3H]thymidine in the medium was replaced with 1.5 μCi of [14C]choline. Following 2 h of incubation, the lenses were washed three times with cold medium 199, carefully blotted, weighed, and then homogenized in 0.1 m NaOH. The radioactivity in the homogenate was counted.Mouse Model of Controlled Cortical Impact Injury (CCII)—The Cat+/+, Cat+/-, and Cat-/- mice at 8-10 weeks of age were used in the study. The procedures of anesthesia and craniotomy have been previously described (44Lighthall J.W. Goshgarian H.G. Pinderski C.R. J. Neurotrauma. 1990; 7: 65-76Google Scholar, 45Smith D.H. Soares H.D. Piece J.S. Perlman K.G. Saatman K.E. Meaney D.F. Dixon C.E. McIntosh T.K. J. Neurotrauma. 1995; 12: 169-178Google Scholar, 46Xiong Y. Gu Q. Peterson P.L. Muizelaar J.P. Lee C.P. J. Neurotrauma. 1997; 14: 23-34Google Scholar). Briefly, a 6-mm diameter of skull cap over the right parietal cortex centered between bregma and lambda was removed to expose the underlying dura mate. CCII at an impact velocity of 7.6 m/s, an impact depth of 1 mm, and a dwell time of 200 ms was delivered using a pneumatic impactor as described previously. Control mice did not receive any treatment. A sham group of mice received the same craniotomy as traumatic brain injury (TBI) animals but without any mechanical injury.Assay of Mitochondrial Respiratory and Phosphorylating Activities—The animals were decapitated at day 1 after TBI or sham. The ipsilateral hemisphere from a single mouse was placed in ice-cold isolation medium (or SEE medium; 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), and mitochondria were isolated by repeated centrifugations and washes as described before (46Xiong Y. Gu Q. Peterson P.L. Muizelaar J.P. Lee C.P. J. Neurotrauma. 1997; 14: 23-34Google Scholar). Mitochondrial respiratory activities were assayed polarographically using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, OH) fitted into a 1.0-ml thermostated chamber at 30 °C. The reaction solution consisted of 150 mm sucrose, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 0.6-1.5 mg of mitochondrial protein. The final concentrations of substrates in the chamber were 5.0 mm/2.5 mm for glutamate/malate (for measuring electron transfer activities through complexes I, III, and IV) or 5.0 mm for succinate in the presence of 0.25 μm rotenone (for measuring electron transfer activities through complexes II, III, and IV). State 3 respiration (in the presence of substrates) was initiated by the addition of 304 nmol of ADP for substrates of glutamate and malate or 202 nmol of ADP for substrate of succinate. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption in the presence of substrates and after all added ADP is converted into ATP is defined as State 4 respiration. Respiratory control index (RCI) is defined as the ratio of respiratory rates at State 3 to those at State 4. The ADP/O ratio (P/O ratio) was determined by dividing the amount (nmol) of ADP phosphorylated during State 3 respiration by the amount (nanoatoms) of oxygen consumed (47Lee C.P. Sciamanna M. Peterson P.L. Methods Toxicol. 1993; 2: 41-49Google Scholar). Mitochondrial respiration was also measured in the presence of 0.4 mm EGTA, a calcium-chelating agent.Statistical Analysis—Data were first analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. Difference in two samples was then assessed by Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test. Difference with a p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSGeneration and Characterization of Cat Knockout Mice—As shown in Fig. 1A, the BamHI genomic DNA fragment of the mouse Cat gene, containing parts of intron 4 and exon 5, was replaced by a neomycin resistance cassette in the gene targeting vector. The BamHI restriction site located in exon 5 was also purposely disrupted in the targeting vector. This allowed distinction of the targeted Cat allele from the endogenous Cat allele by DNA blot analysis of BamHI-digested genomic DNA. The heterozygous Cat (Cat+/-) knockout mice were interbred to generate homozygous knockout (Cat-/-) mice. An example of DNA blot analysis of mouse genomic DNA is shown in Fig. 1B. The 6.9-kb hybridization band is derived from the wild-type allele, and the 8.6-kb hybridization band is derived from the mutated allele.Inactivation of the mouse Cat gene by gene targeting was then confirmed by an expression study. As shown in Fig. 2A, a 50-70% decrease of Cat mRNA was found in tissues of Cat+/- mice in comparison with Cat+"

https://openalex.org/W2132871071,"The relative importance of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) 1 and PMCA4 was assessed in mice carrying null mutations in their genes (Atp2b1 and Atp2b4). Loss of both copies of the gene encoding PMCA1 caused embryolethality, whereas heterozygous mutants had no overt disease phenotype. Despite widespread and abundant expression of PMCA4, PMCA4 null (Pmca4-/-) mutants exhibited no embryolethality and appeared outwardly normal. Loss of PMCA4 impaired phasic contractions and caused apoptosis in portal vein smooth muscle in vitro; however, this phenotype was dependent on the mouse strain being employed. Pmca4-/- mice on a Black Swiss background did not exhibit the phenotype unless they also carried a null mutation in one copy of the Pmca1 gene. Pmca4-/- male mice were infertile but had normal spermatogenesis and mating behavior. Pmca4-/- sperm that had not undergone capacitation exhibited normal motility but could not achieve hyperactivated motility needed to traverse the female genital tract. Ultrastructure of the motility apparatus in Pmca4-/- sperm tails was normal, but an increased incidence of mitochondrial condensation indicated Ca2+ overload. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry showed that PMCA4 is the most abundant isoform in testis and sperm and that it is localized to the principle piece of the sperm tail, which is also the location of the major Ca2+ channel (CatSper) required for sperm motility. These results are consistent with an essential housekeeping or developmental function for PMCA1, but not PMCA4, and show that PMCA4 expression in the principle piece of the sperm tail is essential for hyperactivated motility and male fertility. The relative importance of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) 1 and PMCA4 was assessed in mice carrying null mutations in their genes (Atp2b1 and Atp2b4).

Plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases (PMCAs) 1The abbreviations used are: PMCA1 and PMCA4, plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase isoforms 1 and 4 (Pmca1 and Pmca4 refer to the genes for each isoform); neoR, neomycin resistance; ES cells, embryonic stem cells; RT, reverse transcriptase; Pmca1+/+ and Pmca1+/-, PMCA1 wild-type and heterozygous mutant mice, respectively; Pmca4+/+, Pmca4+/-, and Pmca4-/-, PMCA4 wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous mutant mice, respectively; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. are highly regulated Ca2+ extrusion pumps that provide fine-tuning of intracellular Ca2+ levels (1Carafoli E.

In mammals, they comprise a family of four distinct isoforms, each encoded by a separate gene, with PMCA1 and PMCA4 being expressed in most if not all adult tissues, and PMCA2 and PMCA3 having a very limited tissue distribution (3Shull G.E.

Tissue- and developmental stage-specific alternative splicing of exons encoding two different regulatory domains leads to additional diversity, with the potential for as many as 32 protein variants (8Strehler E.E. Zacharias D.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 21-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 9Chicka M.C. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18464-18470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Given the importance of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis and signaling, it seems likely that PMCA activity is necessary for both tissue-specific physiological functions and the “housekeeping” function of maintaining intracellular Ca2+ in a range compatible with cell viability. PMCA2 and PMCA3, which are invariably coexpressed with another isoform, are likely to serve tissue-specific functions. In fact, studies of Pmca2 null mutants have shown that ablation of this isoform leads to profound hearing and balance problems (10Kozel P. Friedman R.A. Erway L.C. Yamoah E.N. Liu L.H. Riddle T. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Cardell E.L. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18693-18696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 11Street V.A. Mckee-Johnson J.W.

Comm. 1999; 261: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) due to the loss of PMCA activity in stereocilia of sensory hair cells of the inner ear. The widespread distribution of PMCA1 and PMCA4 in adult tissues has led to the suggestion that these isoforms might play critical housekeeping functions (5Greeb J. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18569-18576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Stauffer T.P. Hilfiker H. Carafoli E. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25993-26003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If this were the case, then a null mutation in either isoform could cause a loss of viability of one or more cell types either in the embryo, with consequent embryolethality or structural malformations, or after birth. Alternatively, the loss of one or the other of these isoforms might be tolerated if the other isoform could provide sufficient compensation for its absence or if it served an entirely tissue-specific rather than a housekeeping function. In the latter case, one might expect to observe a physiological deficit, but not cell death. To begin assessing the relative importance of PMCA1 and PMCA4 with respect to both house-keeping and organ-specific functions, and to determine whether there is any redundancy in their functions, we developed and analyzed mice with null mutations in their genes. The results suggest that PMCA1, but not PMCA4, is an essential housekeeping isoform; however, the data also showed that there were tissues in which PMCA4 was the more abundant isoform and that its absence, under some conditions, led to apoptosis. Another group recently reported that the loss of PMCA4 causes a sperm motility defect and male infertility (14Schuh K. Cartwright E.J. Jankevics E. Bundschu K. Liebermann J. Williams J.C. Armesilla A.L. Emerson M. Oceandy D. Knobeloch K.P. Neyses L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; (Epub ahead of print)PubMed Google Scholar). The current experiments confirm and extend those findings. Our data show that PMCA4 is the major isoform in sperm, that it is expressed specifically in the principle piece of the sperm tail, and that it is required for hyperactivated, but not non-hyperactivated, sperm motility. Interestingly, the Ca2+ channel that controls Ca2+ influx into the sperm tail is also restricted to the principle piece (15Ren D. Navarro B. Perez G. Jackson A.C. Hsu S. Shi Q. Tilly J.L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 413: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Thus, the major Ca2+ influx and efflux mechanisms regulating Ca2+ in the sperm tail and hyperactivated motility are both located in the principle piece of the sperm tail. Preparation of Mutant Mice and Genotype Analysis—Mouse Pmca1 and Pmca4 genomic sequences from a 129/SvJ library were used to prepare targeting constructs. The pMJKO vector (16Periasamy M. Reed T.D. Liu L.H. Ji Y. Loukianov E. Paul R.J. Nieman M.L. Riddle T. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Lorenz J.N. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2556-2562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) contained both the neoR gene for positive selection of targeted ES cells and the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase gene for negative selection. To prepare the Pmca1 construct, a 3.0-kb PCR fragment extending from codon 380 in exon 9 to codon 465 in exon 10 was inserted 5′ to the neoR gene, and a 2.7-kb SspI fragment, beginning in intron 10 and terminating in intron 11, was inserted between the neoR gene and the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase gene. For Pmca4, we used a 3.1-kb PCR fragment extending from codon 317 in exon 9 to codon 447 in exon 11 and a 2.1-kb fragment extending from codon 475 in exon 11 to codon 675 in exon 13. Electroporation and analysis of ES cells, blastocyst-mediated transgenesis, and breeding of male chimeras with Black Swiss mice, were performed as described previously (16Periasamy M. Reed T.D. Liu L.H. Ji Y. Loukianov E. Paul R.J. Nieman M.L. Riddle T. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Lorenz J.N. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2556-2562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Because the ES cells were derived from 129/SvJ strain mice, the initial mice analyzed were of a mixed 129/SvJ and Black Swiss background. For later studies the mice were bred onto the Black Swiss background. DNA from ES cells and tail biopsies were analyzed by Southern hybridization using Pmca genomic probes. For Pmca1, we used a 198-bp 3′ outside probe from exon 12 (codons 623–688) and a 196-bp 5′ inside probe from exon 9 (codons 380–445). For Pmca4, we used a 1.6-kb 5′ outside probe extending from codon 304 in exon 8 to codon 320 in exon 9 and a 1 kb 3′ inside probe extending from codon 670 in exon 13 to codon 708 in exon 14. Genotyping of mice was performed by blot hybridization of tail (or spleen) DNA or by PCR using a combination of three primers that simultaneously amplify wild-type and mutant alleles. For Pmca1 genotyping, forward (5′-GTGAGACACCTGGACGCTTGTGAGACC-3′) and reverse (5′-TCCCCGTTACCAGGTAGGACAGGA-3′) primers, corresponding to sequences from the 5′ and 3′ ends of exon 10, respectively, amplified a 183-bp product (codons 457–517) from the wild-type allele. For the mutant allele, a reverse primer complimentary to sequences in the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter (5′-GCATGCTCCAGACTGCCTTG-3′) that drives the neoR gene, and the forward primer from the 5′ end of exon 10 amplified a 126-bp product. For Pmca4, forward (5′-CTGTGGGAACCCCGTTGGTCTCTTTC-3′) and reverse (5′-GCACCCAGGCGATGGATGGCAAAGCT-3′) primers, derived from the 3′ and 5′ ends of intron 10 and intron 11, respectively, amplified a 335-bp product from the wild-type allele. For the mutant allele, a 157-bp product was amplified using a reverse primer complimentary to sequences in the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter (5′-GCATGCTCCAGACTGCCTTG-3′) that drives the neoR gene and the forward primer from the 3′ end of intron 10. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from tissues of 8- to 12-week-old mice, and hybridization analysis was performed as described previously (10Kozel P. Friedman R.A. Erway L.C. Yamoah E.N. Liu L.H. Riddle T. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Cardell E.L. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18693-18696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The PMCA1 probe was a 0.43-kb fragment containing the last coding exon (103 codons) and 3′ untranslated sequence. The PMCA4 probe consisted of a 0.3-kb fragment containing 5′ untranslated sequence and the first 51 codons and a 0.3-kb fragment corresponding to the last 100 codons of the PMCA4 mRNA. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or L32 ribosomal subunit cDNA probes were used as loading controls. RT-PCR Analysis of Mutant and Wild-type PMCA1 and PMCA4 mRNAs—First strand cDNA was prepared from total RNA of mutant or wild type brain, kidney, stomach, and lung using oligo(dT) primers and reverse transcriptase. For PMCA1, the PCR primers corresponded to codons 380–388 from exon 9 and the reverse complement of codons 681–688 from exon 12. For PMCA4, the PCR primers corresponded to codons 322–330 from exon 9 and the reverse complement of codons 588–595 from exon 12. The PCR fragments were separated on a 2% agarose gel, visualized with ethidium bromide, and then subcloned and sequenced. Estimation of Relative Levels of PMCA1 and PMCA4 mRNAs—First strand cDNA was synthesized using RNA from multiple tissues, reverse transcriptase, and oligo(dT) as a primer. For simultaneous PCR amplification of PMCA1 and PMCA4 cDNA fragments, a reverse primer (5′-CTCAGAGGCACCCTTGCTGAAGATGCGG-3′) corresponding to PMCA1 codons 596–605 and PMCA4 codons 586–595 and a forward primer corresponding to PMCA1 codons 263–271 and PMCA4 codons 259–267 (5′-GGTACTCACGTGATGGAAGGTTCTGG-3′) were used. The primers had two mismatches relative to each mRNA but allowed efficient amplification of products for PMCA1 and PMCA4 but not for PMCA2 or PMCA3. The resulting PCR products were a 1029-bp PMCA1 fragment and a 1011-bp PMCA4 fragment corresponding to the same region of both isoforms. To estimate the relative amounts of each mRNA, the samples were first digested with restriction enzymes that cut one or the other product. ClaI cleaves the PMCA1 fragment into 395- and 634-bp pieces, and BglI cleaves the PMCA4 fragment into 495- and 516-bp pieces. Undigested samples, or samples digested with ClaI alone, BglI alone, or both enzymes together were analyzed on ethidium bromide-stained 1.5-% agarose gels. There was no evidence of contamination by cDNAs for the corresponding regions of PMCA2 or PMCA3 mRNAs, which do not contain ClaI and BglI sites. Histological Tissue Survey—The following tissues were placed in 10% formaldehyde, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and used for a routine histological survey: cerebrum and cerebellum; eye; submandibular lymph nodes; parotid, sublingual, and submandibular salivary glands; esophagus, stomach, small intestine, cecum, and colon; heart, diaphragm, masseter, and quadriceps muscles; lung, trachea, liver, pancreas, spleen, and kidney; adrenal glands; uterus, ovary, testis, and seminal vesicles; and skin. Portal Vein Contractility Measurements—Pmca4+/+ and Pmca4-/- mice, 10–12 weeks old, were euthanized, and contractility experiments were carried out on segments of isolated portal vein as described previously (17Meyer J.M. Flagella M. Sutliff R.L. Lorenz J.N. Nieman M.L. Weber C.S. Paul R.J. Shull G.E. Am. J. Phisiol. 2002; 283: H1846-H1855PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sutliff R.L. Weber C.S. Qian J. Miller M.L. Clemens T.L. Paul R.J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2077-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The frequencies of spontaneous contractions were measured, and tension-time integrals were calculated. For experiments in which contraction in response to acetylcholine or endothelin were measured, concentration-isometric force relationships were determined after two sequential stimulations with 15 mm KCl. A Harvard Apparatus Differential Capacitor Force Transducer and a Biopac MP100 Data Acquisition System were used to record force measurements, and data analysis was carried out using the Biopac AcqKnowledge software program. Histological, Morphometric, and Ultrastructural Analysis of Portal Veins—For light microscopy, cross-sections of portal veins were stained with toluidine blue or a trichrome stain (azure II, methylene blue, or basic fuchsin). Sections for electron microscopy were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Portal veins were assessed in 20 Pmca4-/- and 19 Pmca4+/+ mice. Twenty-one of the mice were of the original mixed 129/SvJ and Black Swiss background, and 18 were of the Black Swiss background. Portal veins were collected under varying conditions of euthanasia or anesthesia (CO2 and Avertin), fixation (perfusion, immersion), and after force measurements were conducted. The cell death response was measured by digitizing the length of the portal vein endothelium and counting the number of dense nuclei (those with highly condensed chromatin) in the underlying smooth muscle. The apoptotic index was calculated by dividing the number of such cells by the total number of microns digitized times 100. Because the muscle thickness did not vary among groups, this provided a measure of smooth muscle cell death. Portal veins were also assessed by electron microscopy to confirm that the observed cell death was due to apoptosis rather than necrosis. Sperm Motility Assays—As a preliminary assessment of sperm motility, female mice were mated with Pmca4-/- or Pmca4+/+ male mice (n = 3 for each genotype). Oviducts were excised 4 h after copulation and examined for the presence of motile sperm and fertilized eggs. Sperm were isolated from epididymides of 8- to 12-week-old Pmca4-/- and Pmca4+/+ mice, and their motility prior to hyperactivation was assessed as described previously (19Woo A.L. James P.F. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20693-20699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In vitro hyperactivated sperm motility was analyzed using the same buffers and procedures described by Suarez et al. (20Suarez S.S. Vincenti L. Ceglia M.W. J. Exp. Zool. 1987; 244: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The sperm suspension was diluted with an equal volume of medium containing 40 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and videotaped after 2 min, 10 min, and 90 min. The video was digitized to an uncompressed QuickTime movie file, video footage was contrast-enhanced using Adobe AfterFX, and tracking and data output were performed using Alias/wavefront Maya4. A tracking module was programmed to pinpoint the head of the sperm, creating a track of the sperm path. Parameters collected for analyzing the paths of individual sperm using the SAS General Linear Model were: the total distance/s traveled by the sperm (track speed), the distance/s along the center path (path velocity, an estimate of the net forward motion), the mean amplitude of the sperm path, and the cycles per second. Sperm Ultrastructure—After 90 min, the sperm from the hyperactivation assay were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in fixative, and prepared for electron microscopy as described above. The ratio of orthodox and condensed mitochondria was determined by counting 346 and 566 mitochondrial profiles in the midpiece of the sperm tail in samples from Pmca4+/+ and Pmca4-/- mice, respectively. Immunoblot and Immunohistochemical Analysis of PMCA4 in Sperm—For immunoblot analysis, proteins in homogenates of both testes and sperm, each from three pairs of 10- to 12 week-old Pmca4-/- and Pmca4+/+ mice, were separated by reducing 7% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. Relative PMCA levels were determined using the 5F10 monoclonal antibody (Affinity Bioreagents) that recognizes all PMCA isoforms (21Caride A.J. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). For immunohistochemistry, sperm were placed on slides and allowed to air dry for 30 min. The sperm were fixed overnight in phosphate-buffered formalin at 4 °C, washed four times in PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% SDS in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After removal of detergent by repeated washing in PBS, nonspecific sites were blocked by a 1-h incubation in blocking medium prior to incubation with 50 μl of blocking medium only (as control) or blocking medium containing a 1:100 or 1:500 dilution of the JA9 monoclonal antibody (generously provided by Dr. John Penniston, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN), which recognizes a PMCA4-specific epitope in the N-terminal region of the protein (21Caride A.J. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The blocking medium consisted of 5% normal goat serum in 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% gelatin, and 0.01% sodium azide in PBS. After incubation with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, the slides were washed four times with the incubation medium at room temperature. The primary antibodies were detected with goat anti-mouse IgG labeled with fluorescein (1:50) for 1 h and washed three times with PBS. After mounting with VectaMount (Vector Laboratories) and staining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (1:10), which binds to DNA and yields a blue fluorescence, images were obtained by phase contrast microscopy. Generation of Mice with a Null Mutation in the Pmca1 Gene and Gross Phenotype—The Pmca1 gene was disrupted by replacing codons 466–529, including the catalytic phosphorylation site (aspartic acid 475), with the neoR gene (Fig. 1A). Targeted ES cells were used for blastocyst-mediated transgenesis, and when the resulting chimeric male mice were bred with Black Swiss females, germ line transmission of the mutant allele was achieved (Fig. 1B). Mating of heterozygous breeding pairs yielded live wild-type and heterozygous pups, in a 1:2 ratio, as shown by Southern blot (Fig. 1B, right panel) and PCR analysis (Fig. 1C) of genomic DNA. Northern blot analysis revealed no differences in the apparent levels of the 5.5- and 7.5-kb PMCA1 mRNAs in various tissues of Pmca1+/- and wild-type mice (Fig. 1D), suggesting either that the wild-type allele was up-regulated or that an mRNA lacking exon 10 might be expressed from the mutant allele. Such a small difference in size would not be detected by blot hybridization. RT-PCR analysis of mRNA from wild-type and Pmca1+/- mice confirmed that the donor site of exon 9 was spliced to the acceptor site of exon 11, thereby producing an mRNA that lacked codons for amino acids 449–529 (Fig. 1E), which are essential for pump activity. Generation of Mice with a Null Mutation in the Pmca4 Gene and Gross Phenotype—A similar strategy was used for disruption of the Pmca4 gene (Fig. 2A). The region of exon 11 encoding amino acids 448–474, which includes the catalytic phosphorylation site (aspartic acid 465), was replaced with the neoR gene. Chimeric males were bred with Black Swiss females, and germ line transmission was achieved (Fig. 2B). Mating of heterozygous mice yielded live wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous mutant offspring (Fig. 2C) in a normal 1:2:1 Mendelian ratio. There was no apparent reduction in the levels of PMCA4 mRNA in Pmca4-/- tissues, nor was there a detectable difference in the size of the ∼8.5-kb mRNA (Fig. 2D), suggesting that exon 11 might have been deleted during processing of the mRNA. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that exon 10 was spliced to exon 12, thereby deleting codons 439–519 (Fig. 2E). There was no evidence of structural malformations or growth retardation among Pmca4-/- mice in utero. Breeding of homozygous mutants of each sex with wild-type mice showed that female Pmca4-/- mice were fertile; however, male Pmca4-/- mice of both the original mixed 129/SvJ and Black Swiss background and the pure Black Swiss background used for later studies were infertile. When the mutation was carried on the original mixed 129/SvJ and Black Swiss background there was a significant incidence of adult Pmca4-/- mice with skin around the jaw that was raw from scratching. This phenotype correlated with enlarged submandibular lymph nodes. Like the apoptotic phenotype described below, however, this characteristic disappeared as the mice were bred onto the Black Swiss background. Otherwise, Pmca4-/- pups and adults of both sexes were indistinguishable from wild-type littermates in both appearance and behavior and appeared normal with respect to survival and growth. Analysis of tissues taken immediately after euthanasia revealed no histopathological evidence that the loss of PMCA4 causes cell death, as might have occurred if it served an essential housekeeping function in certain cell types. As discussed below, however, portal vein smooth muscle was subject to apoptosis in vitro. Relative Levels of PMCA1 and PMCA4 mRNAs in Mouse Tissues—It seemed possible that the loss of PMCA1 null mutants during embryogenesis and the relatively normal appearance of PMCA4 null mutants even through adulthood could reflect major differences in expression levels of the two pumps. To assess the relative levels of PMCA1 and PMCA4 mRNA in mouse tissues, RT-PCR analysis was performed using primers that simultaneously amplify the corresponding regions of both mRNAs (Fig. 3A). The resulting fragments were then digested with restriction enzymes that recognize only one or the other of the two fragments and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3B). Only PMCA1 mRNA was detected in liver, but all other tissues contained mRNA for both isoforms. Brain, intestine, kidney, lung, and stomach had higher levels of PMCA1 than PMCA4 mRNA. In contrast, aorta, portal vein, urinary bladder, diaphragm, seminal vesicles, and testes had higher levels of PMCA4 than PMCA1 mRNA. Many of the tissues examined had less than a 2-fold difference between the two isoforms, consistent with the relative abundance of PMCA1 and PMCA4 mRNAs observed in human tissues (13Stauffer T.P. Hilfiker H. Carafoli E. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25993-26003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Altered Phasic Contractions and Apoptosis in Pmca-deficient Portal Vein Smooth Muscle—One of the tissues in which PMCA4 mRNA levels are higher than those of PMCA1 is portal vein. To determine whether the loss of PMCA4 might affect portal vein function, we analyzed contractility of isometrically mounted Pmca4-/- and Pmca4+/+ portal veins. In our initial studies, using mice on the original mixed 129/SvJ and Black Swiss background, normal phasic contractions and tension-time integrals were observed in wild-type but not in Pmca4-/- portal veins (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, the knockout exhibited no increase in force in response to acetylcholine or endothelin (data not shown). Although this observation was consistent with a specialized function for PMCA4, as described in more detail below, smooth muscle cells from Pmca4-/- portal veins from the mixed background mice exhibited evidence of apoptosis. However, in later studies using portal veins from Pmca4-/- mice on a Black Swiss background, portal vein contractility was normal, as indicated by the occurrence of phasic contractions and tension-time integrals that were not significantly different from those of the corresponding wild-type portal veins (Fig. 4B). Further investigation led to the conclusion that the change in phenotype was due to the difference in mouse strains rather than in experimental protocols. A possible explanation for the occurrence of this strain-dependent effect was that portal veins from Black Swiss mice were less sensitive to the overall reduction in Ca2+ extrusion activity caused by the loss of PMCA4 than portal veins of the mixed background mice. Therefore, we reasoned that the additional loss of one copy of the Pmca1 gene in Pmca4-/- portal veins might lead to a sufficient overall reduction in PMCA activity to elicit the original phenotype. PMCA4 and PMCA1 mutants were crossed to obtain Pmca4-/-Pmca1+/- mutants on the Black Swiss background. Portal vein contractility was impaired, with mutant portal veins exhibiting weak to moderate phasic contractions (Fig. 4C). The tension-time integral for Black Swiss Pmca4-/-Pmca1+/- portal veins was sharply reduced relative to that of both wild-type portal veins and Black Swiss Pmca4-/- portal veins, although it was not as severely affected as Pmca4-/- portal veins from the original mixed background strain. Portal veins normally remain viable and exhibit phasic contractions for many hours after being placed in the organ bath. Thus, the absence of phasic contractions observed in the initial experiments was consistent with the possibility that PMCA4 plays a specialized role in portal vein contractility; however, histological and ultrastructural analysis revealed that portal vein smooth muscle cells from Pmca4-/- mice of the original mixed background were susceptible to apoptosis. Cell death was not apparent in fresh portal veins of either genotype (Fig. 5, A–D), but was significant in Pmca4-/- portal veins after 4 h of contractility experiments in vitro (Fig. 5, E and F). The number of apoptotic smooth muscle cells per 100 μm along the length of the portal vein wall was 8.1 ± 1.6 and 0.12 ± 0.12 for Pmca4-/- and Pmca4+/+ mice, respectively (p < 0.0001). The increase in apoptotic cells in Pmca4-/- smooth muscle was confirmed by ultrastructural analysis of the smooth muscle cell"

K562-R and LAMA-R cells that were markedly resistant to induction of mitochondrial dysfunction (e.g. loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, Bax translocation, cytochrome c, and apoptosis-inducing factor release) and apoptosis by imatinib mesylate exhibited a pronounced reduction in expression of Bcr/Abl, Bcl-xL, and STAT5 but a striking increase in levels of activated Lyn. Whereas basal expression of Bcl-2 protein was very low in parental cells, imatinib-resistant cells displayed a marked increase in Bcl-2 mRNA and/or protein levels. Treatment of LAMA-R cells with the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 significantly reduced Lyn activation as well as Bcl-2 mRNA and protein levels. Transient or stable transfection of LAMA84 or K562 cells with a constitutively active Lyn (Y508F), but not with a kinase-dead mutant (K275D), significantly increased Bcl-2 protein expression and protected cells from lethality of imatinib mesylate. Ectopic expression of Bcl-2 protected K562 and LAMA84 cells from imatinib mesylate- and PP2-mediated lethality. Conversely, interference with Bcl-2 function by co-administration of the small molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor HA14-1 or down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression by small interfering RNA or antisense strategies significantly increased mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis induced by imatinib mesylate and the topoisomerase inhibitor VP-16 in LAMA-R cells. In marked contrast, these interventions had little effect in parental LAMA84 cells that display low basal levels of Bcl-2. Together, these findings indicate that activation of Lyn in leukemia cells displaying a Bcr/Abl-independent form of imatinib mesylate resistance plays a functional role in Bcl-2 up-regulation and provide a theoretical basis for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting Bcl-2 in such a setting.

This translocation stems from a head-to-tail fusion of the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) at band q11 of chromosome 22 with the proto-oncogene (c-ABL) at band q34 of chromosome 9. This leads in turn to the expression in virtually all Ph+ CML patients of the chimeric fusion protein p210 Bcr/Abl, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase (1Lugo T.G. Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Witte O.N. Science. 1990; 247: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). The etiologic role of the BCR/ABL oncogenic tyrosine kinase in the pathogenesis of CML has been well documented (2McLaughlin J. Chianese E. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Expression of Bcr/Abl not only contributes to leukemic transformation but also represents a barrier to the successful treatment of this disorder. For example, Bcr/Abl stimulates diverse downstream survival signal transduction pathways, including those related to STAT5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 5), Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt that, collectively, provide affected cells with survival and proliferative advantages (4Nieborowska-Skorska M.

Imatinib mesylate (STI-571, Gleevec, CGP57148B) is a 2-phenylamino pyrimidine that targets the ATP-binding site of the kinase domain of Abl (11Schindler T. Bornmann W. Pellicena P. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Science. 2000; 289: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). Imatinib mesylate is lethal to Bcr/Abl-positive cells in culture (12Druker B.J. Tamura S.

Resistance to imatinib mesylate stems from BCR/ABL gene amplification, leading to overexpression of Bcr/Abl protein (16le Coutre P. Tassi E. Varella-Garcia M. Barni R. Mologni L. Cabrita G.

Recently, a putatively Bcr/Abl-independent form of imatinib mesylate resistance has been reported by several groups (20Nimmanapalli R. O'Bryan E. Huang M. Bali P. Burnette P.K. Loughran T.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 672-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), display a decline in Bcr/Abl protein and/or mRNA levels and a corresponding increase in expression/activity of the Lyn and Hck kinase (21Donato N.J.

Shishodin S. Albitar M. Hayes K. Kantarjian H. Talpaz M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 672-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Lyn and Hck represent members of the Src tyrosine kinase family and have been implicated in the regulation of cell survival and proliferation, among numerous other functions (23Lionberger J.M. Wilson M.B. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18581-18585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 24Bates R.C. Edwards N.S. Burns G.F. Fisher D.E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5275-5283PubMed Google Scholar). Lyn exists in two isoforms, p56 and p53, derived from alternatively spliced mRNAs (25Stanley E. Ralph S. McEwen S. Boulet I. Holtzman D.A. Lock P. Dunn A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3399-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of Lyn is tightly regulated through tyrosine phosphorylation at the conserved Tyr-508 (26Shangary S. Lerner E.C. Zhan Q. Corey S.J. Smithgall T.E. Baskaran R. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 289: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Evidence derived from both murine and human model systems suggests that Lyn is a potentially important downstream target of Bcr/Abl (27Danhauser-Riedl S. Warmuth M. Druker B.J. Emmerich B. Hallek M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3589-3596PubMed Google Scholar); moreover, Lyn has been shown to be activated in Bcr/Abl-positive cells obtained from CML patients in blast crisis as well as in HL-60 human leukemia cells transfected with Bcr/Abl (28Ptasznik A. Urbanowska E. Chinta S. Costa M.A. Katz B.A. Stanislaus M.A. Demir G. Linnekin D. Pan Z.K. Gewirtz A.M. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Together, such findings raise the possibility that activation of Lyn can subserve the anti-apoptotic functions of Bcr/Abl, including conditions in which expression of Bcr/Abl is diminished, for whatever reason. Although the role that Lyn plays in protecting cells from lethal stimuli has been examined in some detail (29Grishin A.V. Azhipa O. Semenov I. Corey S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10172-10177Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the functional relationship that exists between this Src kinase and Bcr/Abl remains to be fully elucidated. Moreover, no information exists concerning interactions hyperactivated Lyn might have with Bcl-2 family members. To address these issues, we have examined the molecular profile of human CML cells that have become resistant to imatinib mesylate in association with the loss of Bcr/Abl and activation of the Lyn kinase. Here we report that in such cells activation of Lyn is associated with a pronounced increase in the levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and that disruption of Lyn activation through either pharmacologic or genetic strategies has a significant functional impact on Bcl-2 expression and resistance to mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. In addition, pharmacological or genetic disruption of Bcl-2 function increases the susceptibility of these resistant cells to lethality of imatinib mesylate or the topoisomerase II inhibitor VP-16. These findings may have implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies directed against leukemia cells exhibiting novel forms of imatinib mesylate resistance. Cells and Reagents—LAMA84 were purchased from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Braunschweig, Germany). Imatinib-resistant LAMA84 cells (LAMA-R) were generated by culturing cells in gradually increasing concentrations of imatinib mesylate (beginning at 0.1 μm and increasing in stepwise increments of 0.1 μm) until a level of 1 μm (30Yu C.

K562-R and LAMA-R were maintained in the medium containing 1 μm imatinib mesylate and were washed free of drug before all experimental procedures. All experiments were performed utilizing logarithmically growing cells (4–6 × 105 cells/ml). Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, STI-571), provided by Dr. Elizabeth Buchdunger (Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland), was dissolved in Me2SO at a stock concentration of 50 mm, stored at –20 °C, and subsequently diluted with serum-free RPMI medium prior to use. 4-Amino-5-[4-chlorophenyl]-7-[t-butyl]pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2), a selective inhibitor of the Src family tyrosine kinases (31Wilson M.B.

Etoposide (VP-16), a topoisomerase II inhibitor, was obtained from Sigma. These agents were dissolved in Me2SO as a stock solution and stored at –80 °C. In all experiments, the final concentration of Me2SO did not exceed 0.1%. Transient and Stable Transfection with cDNAs—cDNAs encoding full-length, kinase-defective (K275D, in which Asp is substituted for Lys-275 in the ATP-binding pocket), and constitutively active (Y508F, in which Tyr-508 is substituted in the conserved tail of the C terminus with Phe) Lyn were subcloned into pcDNA3 containing an HA tag (26Shangary S. Lerner E.C. Zhan Q. Corey S.J. Smithgall T.E. Baskaran R. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 289: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 cDNA (wild type) in pUSEamp was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). LAMA84 and K562 cells (1 × 106 per condition) were transiently transfected with three forms of Lyn cDNA (i.e. wild type, K275D, and Y508F) and Bcl-2 cDNA, respectively, using the Amaxa Nucleofector Device (program T-16) with Cell Line-specific Nucleofector Kit V (Amaxa GmbH, Cologne, Germany). Alternatively, K562 and LAMA84 cells were transfected with K275D and Y508F constructs as well as their empty vector counterparts (pcDNA3), respectively, and stably transfected clones were selected by limited dilution using G418. Bcl-2 RNA Interference and Antisense Oligonucleotides—1 × 106 LAMA84 and LAMA-R cells were transfected with 2 μg of Bcl-2-annealed dsRNAi oligonucleotide (5′-GUACAUCCAUUAUAAGCUGTT-3′/3′-TTCAUGUAGGUAAUAUUCGAC-5′, Orbigen, San Diego, CA) and SignalSilence Control siRNA (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), respectively, using the Amaxa Nucleofector Device (program T-16, Kit V). Alternatively, LAMA84 and LAMA-R cells were transfected with 5 μgof a Bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide (5′-TCTCCCAGCGTGCGCCAT-3′, G3139, Calbiochem) or a scrambled control oligonucleotide (5′-TACCGCGTGCGACCCTCT-3′, G3622, Calbiochem) as described for transfection with dsRNAi. Transfection efficiency (>80% at 24 h post-transfection) was monitored by using fluorescein-labeled dsRNAi or antisense oligonucleotide and flow cytometric analysis. Bcl-2 protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis. Apoptosis and Viability—The extent of apoptosis was evaluated by annexin V-FITC staining and flow cytometry. Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were stained with annexin V-FITC (Pharmingen) and 5 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI, Sigma) in 1× binding buffer (10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaOH, 2.5 mm CaCl2) for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. The samples were analyzed by flow cytometry within 1 h to determine the percentage of cells displaying annexin V+ (early apoptosis) or annexin V+/PI+ staining (late apoptosis). The ViaCount assay was performed to evaluate cell viability in the experiments involving transient transfection. 1 × 105 cells were stained with Guava ViaCount Reagent, and the percentage of viable cells was determined using a Guava Personal Cytometer (Gauva Technologies, Hayward, CA) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The ViaCount assay distinguishes between viable and nonviable cells, based on the differential permeability of DNA-binding dyes in the ViaCount Reagent, and was found to correlate closely with the results of annexin/PI staining. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (Δψm)—2 × 105 cells were stained with 40 nm 3,3-dihexyloxacarbocyanine (DiOC6; Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for 20 min and then analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage of cells exhibiting decreased level of DiOC6 uptake, which reflects loss of Δψm, was determined using FACScan from BD Biosciences. Cell Growth and Survival (MTT Assay)—5 × 104 (in 100 μl volume)/well cells were seeded into 96-well plates and incubated with 20 μl of CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution (Promega, Madison, WI) as per the manufacturer's instructions, and the absorbance at 490 nm was recorded using a 96-well plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Western Blot—Whole-cell pellets were lysed in SDS sample buffer, and 30 μg of protein for each condition was subjected to Western blot analysis following the procedures described in detail previously (35Dai Y. Yu C. Singh V. Tang L. Wang Z. McInistry R. Dent P. Grant S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5106-5115PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated, the blots were reprobed with antibodies against β-actin (rabbit polyclonal, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) or α-tubulin (mouse monoclonal, Calbiochem) to ensure equal loading and transfer of proteins. The following antibodies were used as primary antibodies: phospho-Bcr (Tyr-177) antibody (rabbit polyclonal, Cell Signaling), c-Abl antibody (mouse monoclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), STAT5 antibody (rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Bcl-xL antibody (rabbit polyclonal, Cell Signaling), anti-PARP (poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase, mouse monoclonal, Biomol), phospho-Lyn (Tyr-507) antibody (rabbit polyclonal, Cell Signaling), Lyn antibody (rabbit polyclonal, Cell Signaling), anti-human Bcl-2 oncoprotein (mouse monoclonal, Dako, Carpinteria, CA), Bax antibody (rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), XIAP antibody (mouse monoclonal, Transduction Laboratories), phospho-CrkL (Tyr-207) antibody (rabbit polyclonal, Cell Signaling), CrkL (32H4) antibody (mouse monoclonal, Cell Signaling), phospho-Hck (Tyr-411) antibody (rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Hck antibody (rabbit polyclonal, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and HA probe (rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In some cases, the density of blots was quantified using FluoChem 8800 Imaging System (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA) and VideoTesT-Master software (VideoTesT, Ltd., St. Petersburg, Russia). Translocation of Bax, Cytochrome c, and AIF—4 × 106 cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by incubating for 30 s in lysis buffer (75 mm NaCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, and 350 μg/ml digitonin). After centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 1 min, the supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was collected in an equal volume of 2× sample buffer, and the pellet (mitochondria-rich fraction) was lysed by sonication in 1× SDS sample buffer. For both cytosolic and pellet fractions, the proteins were quantified, and 30 μg of protein per condition was separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot, as described above, using Bax antibody, cytochrome c antibody (mouse monoclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and AIF antibody (mouse monoclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as primary antibody. RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from 1 × 106 cells using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with QIAshredder spin column (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. 1 μg per condition of total RNA was subjected to RT-PCR using One-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) and PTC-200 Peltier Thermal cycler (MJ Research, Reno, NV). The primers (forward, 5′-CGACTTCGCCGAGATGTCCAGGCAG-3′; reverse, 5′-GACCCACGGATAGACCCGGTGTTCA-3′) were used for Bcl-2. RT-PCR was performed under the conditions as follows: reverse transcription at 50 °C for 30 min, initial PCR activation step at 95 °C for 15 min, three-step cycling (denaturing at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min) for 30 cycles, and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The reactions were run, in parallel, for actin as endogenous control. PCR products of Bcl-2 (388 bp) were analyzed in 2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide. Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared as described above. The real time RT-PCR was performed on the ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the TaqMan One-step PCR Master Mix Reagents kit (P/N, 4309169). All the samples were tested in triplicate under the conditions recommended by the fabricant. The cycling conditions are as follows: 48 °C/30 min; 95 °C/10 min; and 40 cycles of 95 °C/15 s and 60 °C/1 min. The cycle threshold was determined to provide the optimal standard curve values (0.98 to 1.0). The probes (5′-CCTGGTGGACAACATCGCCCTGT-3′) and primers for Bcl-2 (forward, 5′-CCTGGTGGACAACATCGCCCTGT-3′; reverse, 5′-GCCGGTTCAGGTACTCAGTCAT-3′) were designed using the Primer Express 2.0 version. The probes were labeled at the 5′ end with 6-carboxyfluorescein and at the 3′ end with 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine. Ribosomal RNA (18 S rRNA) from the Pre-developed TaqMan Assay Reagents (P/N, 4310893E) was used as endogenous control. Statistical Analysis—For analysis of apoptosis, Δψm, MTT, viability, and real time quantitative RT-PCR, values represent the means ± S.D. for at least three separate experiments performed in triplicate. The significance of differences between experimental variables was determined by using the Student's t test. Imatinib-resistant CML Cells Exhibit Loss of Bcr/Abl and Down-regulation of Bcr/Abl Downstream Targets—The response of K562 and LAMA84 cells and their resistant counterparts (K562-R and LAMA-R) to imatinib mesylate was compared. Following an exposure to 0.5–10.0 μm imatinib, K562 (48 h) and LAMA84 cells (24 h) displayed progressive increases in annexin V/PI positivity, whereas their resistant counterparts were minimally affected (Fig. 1, A and B). Thus, both the K562-R and LAMA-R cell lines displayed marked resistance to imatinib mesylate-mediated lethality. Attempts were then made to establish the basis for imatinib mesylate resistance in the two resistant cell lines. Parental K562 and LAMA84 cells, as well as their resistant counterparts, were exposed to 1 μm imatinib mesylate for 48 (K562 and K562-R) and 24 h (LAMA84 and LAMA-R), after which Western blot analysis was performed. As shown in Fig. 1C, both K562-R and LAMA-R cells displayed a dramatic reduction in levels of total and phosphorylated Bcr/Abl, as well as markedly diminished expression of Stat5 and Bcl-xL, well described Bcr/Abl downstream targets (36Horita M. Andreu E.J. Benito A. Arbona C. Sanz C. Benet I. Prosper F. Fernandez-Luna J.L. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), compared with parental cells. Treatment of both sensitive and resistant cells with imatinib mesylate resulted in reductions in Bcl-xL levels, whereas expression of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein XIAP was only diminished following imatinib mesylate exposure in sensitive cells. Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 1, A and B, imatinib mesylate-induced PARP cleavage was largely abrogated in K562-R and LAMA-R cells. Thus, both K562-R and LAMA-R cells appeared to exhibit a Bcr/Abl-independent form of imatinib mesylate resistance, analogous to that previously described by Donato et al. (21Donato N.J. Wu J.Y. Stapley J. Gallick G. Lin H. Arlinghaus R. Talpaz M. Blood. 2003; 101: 690-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 22Donato N.J. Wu J.Y. Stapley J. Lin H. Arlinghaus R. Aggarwal B. Shishodin S. Albitar M. Hayes K. Kantarjian H. Talpaz M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 672-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) in K562 cells and patient samples. Bcr/Abl-independent Imatinib Resistance Is Associated with Marked Activation of Lyn and Increased Expression of Bcl-2— Expression of phosphorylated Bcr/Abl and related proteins in resistant cells was examined next. As shown in Fig. 2A, levels of phospho-Bcr/Abl (activated) were dramatically reduced in K562-R and LAMA-R compared with their parental counterparts. Furthermore, consistent with earlier results involving K562 cells (21Donato N.J. Wu J.Y. Stapley J. Gallick G. Lin H. Arlinghaus R. Talpaz M. Blood. 2003; 101: 690-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of the Src kinase Lyn was markedly increased in both resistant cell lines"

https://openalex.org/W2066541040,"To examine early events in osteoblast differentiation, we analyzed the expression of about 9,400 genes in the murine MC3T3 cell line, whose robust differentiation was documented cytochemically and molecularly. The cells were stimulated for 1 and 3 days with the osteogenic stimulus containing bone morphogenic protein 2. Total RNA was extracted and analyzed by Affymetrix GeneChip oligonucleotide arrays. A regulated expression of 394 known genes and 295 expressed sequence tags was detected. The sensitivity and reliability of detection by microarrays was shown by confirming the expression pattern for 20 genes by radioactive quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Functional classification of regulated genes was performed, defining the groups of regulated growth factors, receptors, and transcription factors. The most interesting finding was concomitant activation of transforming growth factor-β, Wnt, and Notch signaling pathways, confirmed by strong up-regulation of their target genes by PCR. The transforming growth factor-β pathway is activated by stimulated production of the growth factor itself, while the exact mechanism of Wnt and Notch activation remains elusive. We showed that bone morphogenic protein 2 stimulated expression of Hey1, a direct Notch target gene, in mouse MC3T3 and C2C12 cells, in human mesenchymal cells, and in mouse calvaria. Small interfering RNA-mediated inhibition of Hey1 induction led to an increase in osteoblast matrix mineralization, suggesting that Hey1 is a negative regulator of osteoblast maturation. This negative regulation is apparently achieved via interaction with Runx2: Hey1 completely abrogated Runx2 transcriptional activity. These findings identify the Notch-Hey1 pathway as a negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation/maturation, which is a completely novel aspect of osteogenesis and could point to possible new targets for bone anabolic agents.

These findings identify the Notch-Hey1 pathway as a negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation/maturation, which is a completely novel aspect of osteogenesis and could point to possible new targets for bone anabolic agents. Bone is a dynamic tissue that is constantly remodeled, i.e. degraded and renewed. These two processes are accomplished by two main types of bone cells: bone-forming osteoblasts of mesenchymal origin and bone-resorbing osteoclasts of hematopoietic origin (1Baron R. Primer on the Metabolic Bone Diseases and Disorders of Mineral Metabolism. 5th Ed. American Society for Bone and Mineral Research, Washington, D. C.2003: 1-9Google Scholar). A synchronized action of osteoblasts and osteoclasts enables balanced bone remodeling. If this balance is changed in a way that bone resorption exceeds bone formation, osteoporosis occurs, a disease prevalent in old age and characterized by bone loss and a high risk of fractures. Most treatments for osteoporosis available so far target osteoclasts and inhibit bone resorption. In osteoporosis, however, bone loss exceeds the degree of bone gain that can be restored by inhibitors of resorption. Therefore, there is a large need for anabolic agents that would accelerate osteoblast differentiation and promote bone formation. For that purpose, knowledge about molecular events involved in osteoblast differentiation is crucial. Previously osteoblast differentiation was examined mostly at the cellular or single gene level. Many external regulating factors are known, but critical molecular steps in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation are largely unknown. One key player was identified recently as the Runx2 transcription factor (2Karsenty G. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Another transcription factor, Osterix (Osx), which cooperates with and is genetically downstream of Runx2, has also been identified (3Nakashima K. Zhou X. Kunkel G. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 2002; 108: 17-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2784) Google Scholar). However, more molecular players in osteoblast differentiation remain to be identified. In vivo, bone forming osteoblasts develop from mesenchymal precursors, and this process can be mimicked in vitro. Different cellular phenotypes during osteogenesis were tentatively defined as osteoprogenitors, preosteoblasts, mature osteoblasts, and mineralizing osteoblasts, each of them characterized by an overlapping set of marker genes (4Aubin J.E. Liu F. Malaval L. Gupta A.K. Bone. 1995; 17: 77S-83SCrossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Classical cytochemical markers of osteoblast differentiation are alkaline phosphatase and mineralized bone nodules. To examine osteoblast differentiation in vitro, a crucial step is the use of appropriate primary cells or cell lines and defined culture conditions, which allow an ordered stepwise differentiation process. To avoid many inherent problems observed with differentiation of osteosarcoma cell lines, which are transformed and may not be representative of the physiological situation, we used a non-transformed mouse calvarial cell line, MC3T3-E1. This cell line is also known for phenotypic variation in culture (5Leis H.J. Hulla W. Gruber R. Huber E. Zach D. Gleispach H. Windischhofer W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); therefore, we used a cell clone obtained at a low passage number from a laboratory that kept the cells at their original maintenance conditions (6Sudo H. Kodama H.A. Amagai Y. Yamamoto S. Kasai S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). To ensure that the cells also show expected behavior at the molecular level, we selected from this MC3T3-E1 cell batch a further clone, which efficiently activated a Runx2-dependent reporter gene and activated Runx2 mRNA and protein. This clone of MC3T3-E1 cells exhibited very robust and fast differentiation properties. We then used this MC3T3-E1 cell clone to examine a genome-wide pattern of gene expression during early differentiation along osteoblastic lineage. The quality and biological relevance of these analyses was confirmed by detection of a number of osteoblastic markers and genes known to be regulated during osteogenesis. Importantly we also uncovered novel genome-wide aspects of gene regulation in osteoblasts by defining three major activated signaling pathways. We further studied the function of one of them, a transcription factor of the Hairy and Enhancer of Split (HES) 1The abbreviations used are: HES, Hairy and Enhancer of Split; AA, ascorbic acid; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; BMP-2, bone morphogenic protein 2; EST, expressed sequence tag; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GP, β-glycerophosphate; Hey1, Hairy and Enhancer of Split-related with YRPW motif 1; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; OSE2, osteoblast-specific element 2; PTH, parathyroid hormone; PTHR, parathyroid hormone receptor; qrRT, quantitative radioactive reverse transcription; RAMP1, receptor (calcitonin) activity-modifying protein 1; Runx2, Runt-related transcription factor 2; siRNA, small interfering RNA; Smad, MAD (mothers against decapentaplegic) homolog; Tcf7, transcription factor 7, T-cell specific; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; Wnt, wingless-type murine mammary tumor virus integration site family; OCN, osteocalcin; OPN, osteopontin; SPARC, secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (osteonectin); ColIα1, collagen Iα1; Osx, Osterix; TIEG, transforming growth factor-β-inducible early gene; MREL, mean relative expression level; mut, mutated; wt, wild-type; MTS, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IGFBP, IGF-binding protein; SSTR2, type 2 somatostatin receptor; SCYA7, small inducible cytokine A7; NOV, nephroblastoma overexpressed gene; PTH-rP, PTH-related protein; OPG, osteoprotegerin; LEF1, lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1. 1The abbreviations used are: HES, Hairy and Enhancer of Split; AA, ascorbic acid; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; BMP-2, bone morphogenic protein 2; EST, expressed sequence tag; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GP, β-glycerophosphate; Hey1, Hairy and Enhancer of Split-related with YRPW motif 1; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; OSE2, osteoblast-specific element 2; PTH, parathyroid hormone; PTHR, parathyroid hormone receptor; qrRT, quantitative radioactive reverse transcription; RAMP1, receptor (calcitonin) activity-modifying protein 1; Runx2, Runt-related transcription factor 2; siRNA, small interfering RNA; Smad, MAD (mothers against decapentaplegic) homolog; Tcf7, transcription factor 7, T-cell specific; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; Wnt, wingless-type murine mammary tumor virus integration site family; OCN, osteocalcin; OPN, osteopontin; SPARC, secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (osteonectin); ColIα1, collagen Iα1; Osx, Osterix; TIEG, transforming growth factor-β-inducible early gene; MREL, mean relative expression level; mut, mutated; wt, wild-type; MTS, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IGFBP, IGF-binding protein; SSTR2, type 2 somatostatin receptor; SCYA7, small inducible cytokine A7; NOV, nephroblastoma overexpressed gene; PTH-rP, PTH-related protein; OPG, osteoprotegerin; LEF1, lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1. family, Hey1. By manipulating the expression of Hey1 in both the positive and negative direction, we could define its role in osteogenesis and link its function to a main osteoblast regulator, a transcription factor of the Runt family, Runx2. Cell Culture—The parental MC3T3-E1 cell line was a kind gift of T. Kokkubo (Novartis) (6Sudo H. Kodama H.A. Amagai Y. Yamamoto S. Kasai S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). The MC3T3-1b clone was generated after transfection with OSE2-luciferase reporter gene, measuring the activity of Runx2, followed by a selection for a clone in which luciferase was activated by the osteogenic stimulus (100-400 ng/ml BMP-2, 50 μm ascorbic acid (AA), 10 mm β-glycerophosphate (GP)). The cells were grown in α-minimum Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% l-glutamine in T175 flasks (40 ml/flask). The stimulation was done in the same medium. For RNA isolation, alkaline phosphatase, and Alizarin Red S staining, cells were plated on 6-cm dishes (3 × 105cells/dish in 5 ml of medium), 48-well plates (1 × 104 cells/well in 1 ml of medium), and 12-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well in 3 ml of medium), respectively. Cells were grown to confluence for 3 days at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and then stimulated with 10 mm GP (Sigma), 50 μm AA (Wako), and 1 μg/ml BMP-2 (Nico Cerletti, Novartis). Control cells were stimulated with 10 mm β-glycerophosphate alone. For Alizarin Red S staining, cell cultures were fed with fresh medium and osteogenic factors twice weekly. Alkaline Phosphatase Staining—Three days after stimulation, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 0.5 ml/well formalin/methanol/H2O (1:1:1.5) for 15 min at room temperature, and washed three times with water. For staining, one FAST 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium tablet from Sigma (alkaline phosphatase substrate) was dissolved in 10 ml of water, and 0.5 ml of substrate solution was added to the fixed cultures for 15 min at room temperature. After staining, cultures were washed three times with water and air-dried. Alizarin Red S Staining for Mineralization—Fourteen or 17 days after stimulation, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 0.5 ml/well formalin/methanol/H2O (1:1:1.5) for 15 min at room temperature, and washed three times with water. Saturated Alizarin Red S solution was filtered, and 1.5 ml/well was added and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed four to five times with water and air-dried. RNA Isolation—Cells were harvested in the lysis buffer containing guanidinium isothiocyanate. Total RNA was extracted, treated with DNase I, and purified according to the manufacturer's protocol (RNeasy minikit, Qiagen). Calvariae were dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For total RNA isolation, frozen calvariae were crushed in a Bio-Grinding device (Biospec Products) one to two times. Crushed bone was refrozen in liquid nitrogen; 1 ml of TRIzol (Invitrogen) was added, and samples were rotated for 1 h. After 1 min of centrifugation at 13,000 rpm, the supernatant was collected, and phenol-chloroform extraction was performed. 0.2 ml of 1-bromo-3-chloropane (Sigma) was added to each tube, and tubes were strongly shaken and then incubated for 2-3 min at room temperature followed by a 15-min centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. The upper colorless aqueous phase (RNA phase) was collected, RNA was precipitated with isopropanol, and the pellet was washed with 75% ethanol, air-dried, and dissolved in 40 μl of water. RNA was cleaned and DNase I-treated using the RNeasy Clean-Up kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative Radioactive RT-PCR (qrRT-PCR)—This method was performed as described previously by us (7Cappellen D. Luong-Nguyen N.H. Bongiovanni S. Grenet O. Wanke C. Susa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21971-21982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Briefly 10 units of RNase inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics) and 100 μg of random hexanucleotides (Amersham Biosciences) were added to 1 μg of DNase I-treated total RNA. Samples were denatured for 5 min at 65 °C and chilled on ice. Then samples were adjusted to 20 μl with a nuclease-free solution containing another 10 units of RNase inhibitor, a 2.5 mm concentration of each dNTP, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 60 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. 20 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Stratagene) was added (cDNA) or not (RT-) to each sample. The reverse transcription reaction was performed for 2 h at 42 °C and stopped by incubation for 5 min at 95 °C. Samples were then diluted 5-fold with nuclease-free water and stored at -80 °C until use. 1 μl of cDNA or RT-was used as a PCR template. PCRs were performed in a final volume of 25 μl containing a 100 μm concentration of each dNTP, 1 μCi of [α-32P]dATP, a 1 μm concentration of each primer, and 1.25 units of “Hot Start” thermostable DNA polymerase and corresponding reaction buffer (FastStart Taq, Roche Diagnostics). For PCR analysis of parathyroid hormone receptor (PTHR), Dlx2, receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1), JunB, Fra-1, and Wnt6, the reaction mixture contained 5% glycerol in addition. The amplification protocol was as follows: initial step of 5 min at 94 °C, 12-33 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 57/60 °C (all genes were at 57 °C except PTHR, Dlx2, RAMP1, JunB, and Fra-1, which were at 60 °C) for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min 20 s. The amplification was terminated with a final incubation step at 72 °C for 10 min. Aliquots of PCR products were mixed with loading buffer (final concentrations, 5% glycerol, 10 mm EDTA, 0.01% SDS, 0.025% xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue dyes) and analyzed on 8% native polyacrylamide gels. Gels were vacuum-dried, exposed to phosphor storage screens, and imaged by PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The signals on images were quantified by the ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). For each gene analyzed, a cycle curve experiment was performed, and the optimal number of PCR cycles for the quantitative analysis was chosen within the linear range of amplification. The primers (forward and reverse, given in the 5′ to 3′ orientation) and the number of cycles used in PCR were as follows:alkaline phosphatase (ALP), CCCAAAGGCTTCTTCTTGC and GCCTGGTAGTTGTTGTGAG, 30 cycles; Msx2, CGCCTCGGTCAAGTCGGAA and GCCCGCTCTGCTAGTGACA, 31 cycles; PTHR, ACCCCGAGTCTAAAGAGAAC and GCCTTTGTGGTTGAAGTCAT, 28 cycles; osteocalcin (OCN), GGGCAATAAGGTAGTGAACAG and GCAGCACAGGTCCTAAATAGT, 28 cycles; Runx2 (α/m and ϵ), ATGCTTCATTCGCCTCAC and CTCACGTCGCTCATCTTG, 29 cycles; osteopontin (OPN), CACAAGCAGACACTTTCACTC and GAATGCTCAAGTCTGTGTGTT, 23 cycles; osteonectin (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC)), CCCTGCCAGAACCATCATTG and TTGCATGGTCCGATGTAGTC, 23 cycles; collagen Iα1 (ColIα1), CCCTGCCTGCTTCGTGTAAA and CCAAAGTCCATGTGAAATTATC, 22 cycles; 18 S ribosomal subunit RNA (18 S rRNA), CCTGGATACCGCAGCTAGGA and GCGGCGCAATACGAATGCCCC, 12 cycles; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), CTGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG and AGATCCACGACGGACACATT, 19 cycles; Smad1, TGCTGGTGGATGGTTTCACA and TGTCGCCTGGTGTTTTCAATA, 29 cycles; Smad6, GCAACCCCTACCACTTCAG and GCCTCGGTTTCAGTGTAAGA, 28 cycles; JunB, CAGCCTTTCTATCACGACGA and GGTGGGTTTCAGGAGTTTGT, 31 cycles; Id2, CCGATGAGTCTGCTCTACAA and CCGTGTTCAGGGTGGTCAG, 27 cycles; Dlx2, AAACCACGCACCATCTACTC and TCGCCGCTTTTCCACATCTT, 31 cycles; Fra-1, ACCGCCCAGCAGCAGAAGT and AGGTCGGGGATAGCCAGTG, 30 cycles; Tcf7, ACTCTGCCTTCAATCTGCTC and GGGTGTGGACTGCTGAAATG, 27 cycles; low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5), GCCAGTGTGTCCTCATCAAG and ACGCTGGCAGACAAAGTAGA, 25 cycles; transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), CCAAAGACATCTCACACAGTA and TGCCGTACAACTCCAGTGAC, 27 cycles; TGF-β3, CACCGCTGAATGGCTGTCT and CATTGGGCTGAAAGGTGTGA, 26 cycles; TIEG, TTCAGCAGCAAGGGTCACTC and GACAGGCAAACTTCTTCTCAC, 28 cycles; Hey1, GCCGACGAGACCGAATCAAT and GCTGGGATGCGTAGTTGTTG, 30 cycles; RAMP1, TCTGGCTGCTGCTGGCTCA and TTTCCCCAGTCACACCATAG, 31 cycles; Osterix (Osx), ATGGCGTCC TCTCTGCTTGA and GAAGGGTGGGTAGTCATTTG, 30 cycles. Gene Expression Analysis by High Density Oligonucleotide Microarrays—The results shown in this study are derived from three independent experiments with MC3T3 cells. In each experiment, the cells were treated identically: no stimulation, day 0; GP treatment at days 1 and 3; and osteogenic stimulus treatment (GP/AA/BMP-2) at days 1 and 3. Total RNA from each sample was extracted and analyzed on oligonucleotide microarrays. Before microarray analysis, for each experiment we performed a marker gene analysis and cytochemical staining for alkaline phosphatase and mineralization to ensure that cells responded appropriately to the osteogenic stimulus. Microarray hybridizations were performed in the Pharmacogenomics Area, Novartis Pharma Development. Affymetrix GeneChip® Murine Genome U74Av2 arrays were used that consist of coated glass slides with series of oligonucleotide probes synthesized in situ. These arrays contain probes for ∼9,400 genes (∼5,700 functionally characterized genes and ∼3,700 expressed sequence tag (EST) clusters). Biotin-labeled cRNA probes were generated from each sample to be analyzed, starting from 5 μg of DNase I-treated total cellular RNA prepared as described above. The cRNA probes were individually hybridized on the arrays, and the signals were detected according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Hybridization data were analyzed using the MAS 5.0 (Affymetrix), NPGN (Novartis Pharmacogenetics Network), and Expressionist 3.0 (GeneData, Basel, Switzerland) software. Genes were considered as significantly expressed in a given experiment if they were classified as P (present), but not as M (marginal) or A (absent), at least at one time point. Twenty was chosen as the minimal significant hybridization signal value; all lower values were set to 20. All genes discussed and studied herein were detected with gene-specific probes but not with probe sets that recognize gene families. Genes were selected as regulated by osteogenic stimulus if their expression deviated more than 2-fold from the corresponding time-matched control, at any time point, in at least two of three experiments. Table I shows that mean relative expression levels (MRELs) for all three experiments were around 1, showing that most of the genes do not change their expression levels upon treatment. Standard deviation of the MREL represents a degree of variation in the expression level compared with the mean value for all the genes. Thresholds of 2-fold reflect approximately 1 standard deviation around the MREL for all experiments. In addition to this statistical criterion, biological data indicated that 2-fold is a meaningful difference since some of the known BMP-2-regulated genes (such as Dlx2 and Dlx5) were induced to a similar degree (see “Results” and Table II).Table IMean relative expression level of all genes on the microarray in three separate experimentsExp. 1Exp. 2Exp. 3Day 1Day 3Day 1Day 3Day 1Day 3T/CMREL1.151.311.201.281.191.21S.D.1.502.701.662.182.052.22 Open table in a new tab Table IIGrowth factors regulated during osteoblastic differentiation of MC3T3 cellsNameDescriptionPSNAccession numberRELDay 1Day 3Up-regulated transcriptsTGF-β1Transforming growth factor-β1101918_atAJ0098622.074.51Gremlin2BMP antagonist103975_atAB0110303.052.31TGF-β3Transforming growth factor-β3102751_atM327452.372.72PDGFαPlatelet-derived growth factor, α94932_atM294640.992.70IGFBP10Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1092777_atM324902.701.61ActivinInhibin β-A100277_atX696192.451.13Down-regulated transcriptsIGFBP2Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 298627_atX815800.490.83PTHRPParathyroid hormone-like peptide104262_atM600570.850.48IGFBP6Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 6103904_atX815840.720.46SCYA7Small inducible cytokine A794761_atX700580.740.45TGF-β2Transforming growth factor-β293300_atX574130.950.43SCYD1Fractalkine, neurotactin; small inducible cytokine D198008_atU925650.440.41FGF7Fibroblast growth factor 799435_atZ227030.610.37VEGF-DVascular endothelial growth factor D92365_atX995720.750.35VEGF-AVascular endothelial growth factor A103520_atM952000.980.34AngiotensinogenAngiotensin precursor101887_atAF0458870.630.34PHIPhosphohexose isomerase100573_f_atM142200.330.52Ccl5Chemokine (CC motif) ligand 5, RANTES98406_atAF0659470.420.25NOVNephroblastoma overexpressed gene100507_atY092570.210.33 Open table in a new tab By analyzing osteoblast marker genes for each independent experiment, we observed that the kinetics of the differentiation process is not always the same, although the cells were treated exactly the same way. For example, PTHR was induced to a much higher degree at day 3 in experiment 3 as compared with experiments 1 and 2, suggesting that the differentiation process was faster and/or stronger in experiment 3 (data not shown). Higher standard deviations of MREL at day 1 in experiment 3 (Table I) also show that in this experiment more genes are regulated already at day 1, suggesting a faster differentiation process than in experiments 1 and 2. Because of this expected biological variability, we considered as significantly regulated only genes showing regulation in two of three experiments, a criterion that better tolerates the biological variability of the differentiation process. When calculating average expression from three experiments, the median value, which gives less significance to outlier values, was used. C2C12 myoblastic cells were treated with GP (10 mm) and BMP-2 (400 ng/μl) or GP alone for 1 and 3 days. Total RNA was extracted (RNeasy minikit, Qiagen), and samples were analyzed on the Affymetrix GeneChip Murine Genome U74Av2 arrays. Human mesenchymal stem cells (Poietics™, Cambrex) obtained from human bone marrow withdrawn from the posterior iliac crest of the pelvic bone of a 19-year-old female donor were treated with 10 mm βGP, 50 μm AA, and 1000 ng/ml BMP-2. Total RNA was extracted (RNeasy minikit, Qiagen), and the samples were analyzed on the Affymetrix GeneChip HG-U133A. Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—cDNA was synthesized using the High-Capacity cDNA Archive kit (product number 4322171 by Applied Biosystems), starting from 1 μg of RNA, according to the manufacturer's protocol. For real time quantitative RT-PCR, an ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) was used. Reactions were performed in a 394-well format in a 10-μl total volume using 5 μl of 2× Master Mix (TaqMan universal PCR Master Mix, Applied Biosystems), 0.5 μl of 20× primers, probes synthesized by Applied Biosystems, Assay-On-Demand (18 S rRNA, 4310893E; Hey1, Mm00468865_m1), and 2 μl of cDNA (equivalent to 20 ng of RNA). Thermal conditions were as follows: 10 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 94 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. Negative controls were included in each PCR experiment, with RT-instead of cDNA. -Fold inductions and expression ratios between two samples were calculated from differences in threshold cycles at which an increase in reporter fluorescence above a base-line signal could be first detected (Ct value). Results were averaged from triplicate determinations. 18 S rRNA was used as a normalization control. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfection—MC3T3 cells were plated on 6-well plates (0.5 × 105 cells/well in 2 ml of medium). After 24 h, siRNA transfection was performed in a total volume of 1 ml using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. siRNA concentration was 0.1 μm, and the amount of Oligofectamine used was 4 μl/well. Transfection was stopped after 4 h by adding 0.5 ml of medium containing 30% serum and the osteogenic stimulus. RNA was isolated after 1, 2, 3, or 4 days. For Alizarin Red S staining, medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and the osteogenic stimulus was changed twice weekly. Staining was performed after 17 days. The siRNA sequence of sense strand Hey1 siRNA was GCTAGAAAAAGCTGAGATC with dTdT overhangs purified by ion exchange-high pressure liquid chromatography (Xeragon Inc.). The sense strand sequence of control siRNA was AGAAGGAGCGGAATCCTCG with dTdT overhang (provided by François Natt, Novartis). Transient Co-transfections and the Luciferase Assay—Runx2 and Hey1 cDNA were cloned into the pcDNA3.1 (+) expression vector and used in a luciferase reporter assay. Primers used for Hey1 cDNA cloning were: sense, GACCCTCCTCGGAGCCCAC; antisense, TTAGAAAGCTCCGATCTCTGTCC. The OG2luc plasmid containing the minimal osteocalcin promoter in front of the luciferase gene was used as a reporter construct. This luciferase expression vector (without OG2 promoter) was a kind gift from Roland Schule, Freiburg, Germany. Eight times repeated wild-type (8XOSE2 wt) or mutated (8XOSE2 mut) Runx2-binding sites have been cloned upstream of the OG2 minimal promoter (Johann Wirsching, Novartis). Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (4 × 103 cells/well in 200 μl of medium) and grown for 24 h. Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. An MTS assay for cell number normalization and luciferase assays were performed 24 h after transfection. For the MTS assay, 20 μl/well of MTS solution (Cell Titer 96 Aqueous One Solution Reagent, Promega) was added to the medium (100 μl/well). Cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Absorbance was measured at 490 nm in a microplate reader. For the luciferase assay, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and 50 μl/well 1× lysis buffer (Promega) was added and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Subsequently the cultures were shaken for 5 min at room temperature and frozen for 1 h at -70 °C. Upon thawing, 20 μl of lysate was transferred into a white 96-well plate (Costar £3912, opaque plate), 2 × 50 μl of Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega) was added, and luciferase luminescence was measured (MicroLumat LB 96P, Berthold). In response to osteogenic stimulus (BMP-2, AA, and GP), the MC3T3-1b clone of MC3T3-E1 cells (referred to hereafter as MC3T3) showed a strong increase in alkaline phosphatase activity at day 3 (Fig. 1A). Runx2 protein levels were also increased by day 3 (Fig. 1B). Furthermore the cells produced bone nodules, which mineralized by days 11-14 (Fig. 1C). After a longer exposure to osteogenic stimulus, the number of nodules increased dramatically, covering more than 50% of the dish area."

Here we use long-term satellite telemetry to reveal that leatherbacks range throughout the North Atlantic, indicating that closing limited areas to longline fisheries will probably have only partial success in reducing turtle bycatch. Although turtles dive very deeply on occasion (one descended to a maximum depth of 1,230 metres, which represents the deepest dive ever recorded for a reptile), they generally restrict their diving to less than 250 metres, which increases the chance that they will encounter longline hooks."

https://openalex.org/W2032651414,"Conservation efforts should focus on hot spots frequented by these ancient reptiles. The dramatic worldwide decline in populations of the leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea)1 is largely due to the high mortality associated with their interaction with fisheries2, so a reduction of this overlap is critical to their survival. The discovery of narrow migration corridors used by the leatherbacks in the Pacific Ocean3 raised the possibility of protecting the turtles by restricting fishing in these key areas. Here we use satellite tracking to show that there is no equivalent of these corridors in the North Atlantic Ocean, because the turtles disperse actively over the whole area. But we are able to identify a few ‘hot spots’ where leatherbacks meet fisheries and where conservation efforts should be focused."

The hypolipidemic effects of fibrate drugs and the therapeutic benefits of the thiazolidinedione drugs are due to their activation of PPARα and -γ, respectively. In this study, isohumulones, the bitter compounds derived from hops that are present in beer, were found to activate PPARα and -γ in transient co-transfection studies. Among the three major isohumulone homologs, isohumulone and isocohumulone were found to activate PPARα and -γ. Diabetic KK-Ay mice that were treated with isohumulones (isohumulone and isocohumulone) showed reduced plasma glucose, triglyceride, and free fatty acid levels (65.3, 62.6, and 73.1%, respectively, for isohumulone); similar reductions were found following treatment with the thiazolidinedione drug, pioglitazone. Isohumulone treatment did not result in significant body weight gain, although pioglitazone treatment did increase body weight (10.6% increase versus control group). C57BL/6N mice fed a high fat diet that were treated with isohumulones showed improved glucose tolerance and reduced insulin resistance. Furthermore, these animals showed increased liver fatty acid oxidation and a decrease in size and an increase in apoptosis of their hypertrophic adipocytes. A double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study for studying the effect of isohumulones on diabetes suggested that isohumulones significantly decreased blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels after 8 weeks (by 10.1 and 6.4%, respectively, versus week 0).

PPARγ is highly expressed in adipocytes where it regulates the genes responsible for growth and differentiation following activation by both natural and synthetic ligands. Activation of PPARγ was shown to not only stimulate the differentiation of adipocytes but to also induce their apoptotic death, thereby preventing adipocyte hypertrophy (2Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H.

PPARα, another nuclear fatty acid receptor that is widely expressed in the liver, muscle, kidney, and intestine mediates the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. Activators of PPARα, such as fibrates, lower circulating lipid levels and are commonly used to treat hypertriglyceridemia and other dyslipidemic states. Abnormalities in fatty acid metabolism underlie the development of insulin resistance and alterations in glucose metabolism. Recent studies (3Ye J.M. Doyle P.J. Iglesias M.A. Watson D.G. Cooney G.J.

Hops, the female inflorescences of the hop plant (Humulus lupulus L.), are used as a preservative and flavoring in beer. Isohumulones, called iso-α acids, are the compounds that impart the bitter flavor to beer. Specifically, they are converted from humulones, i.e. α acids, derived from hops by isomerization during the brewing process. Humulone was shown to inhibit angiogenesis by suppressing cyclooxygenase-2, one of the key enzymes involved in carcinogenesis (10Shimamura M. Hazato T. Ashino H. Yamamoto Y. Iwasaki E. Tobe H.

We further demonstrated that the treatment of mildly diabetic mice and patients with isohumulones improved their insulin sensitivity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—Isomerized hop extract (IHE; ISOHOPCON2) was purchased from English Hop Products Co. Ltd. (Kent, UK). IHE contains isohumulones at a purity of 79%. Isohumulone, isocohumulone, and isoadhumulone were purified from IHE by centrifugal partition chromatography. Specifically, IHE was neutralized to pH 7.0 with acetic acid and subjected to centrifugal partition chromatography (25 °C, 600 rpm). Ethyl acetate and 0.1 m ammonium acetate were used as the stationary and mobile phases, respectively. Fractionated isohumulones were adjusted to pH 3.0 with HCl, after which they were extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The extracts were washed twice with saturated NaCl and the purified isohumulones dried to determine their total yields, after which they were dissolved in ethanol. Pioglitazone was purified from Actos (Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan) by extraction with chloroform and methanol. Fenofibrate was purchased from Sigma.Transient Transfection Assay—An expression plasmid containing the ligand binding domain of human PPARγ fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain was constructed as described previously (13Lehmann J.M.

The plasmid encoding for the full-length human PPARα fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain was constructed in a similar manner. The PPARγ/GAL4 chimera expression plasmid and pG5luc plasmid (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) were transfected into CV-1 cells by liposomal delivery using LipofectAMINE™ (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HepG2 cells were transfected with the PPARα/GAL4 chimera expression plasmid and the luciferase reporter plasmid. Isohumulones and other PPAR agonists were added to the media immediately after transfection. The cells were lysed 48 h later, and their luciferase activity and protein concentration were determined using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega Corp.) and Dc Protein Assay (Bio-Rad), respectively; luciferase activity was normalized to protein concentration. Assays were performed in triplicate.Animals—This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines for the animal care, handling, and termination from Kirin Pharmaceutical. Male KK-Ay mice (15Saha A.K. Kurowski T.G. Colca J.R. Ruderman N.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: E95-E101PubMed Google Scholar) were purchased from Clea Japan (Tokyo, Japan). Female C57BL/6N mice were purchased from Charles River Breeding Laboratories (Tokyo, Japan). Mice were maintained under a constant 12-h light/dark cycle (light from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.). Six-week-old male KK-Ay mice were maintained for 2 weeks either on a standard diet (16Reeves P.G. Nielsen F.H. Fahey Jr., G.C. J. Nutr. 1993; 123: 1939-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (6691) Google Scholar) or on a diet containing 0.18% (w/w) isohumulone, 0.18% (w/w) isocohumulone, or 0.05% (w/w) pioglitazone. Six-week-old female C57BL/6N mice were maintained on a high fat diet for 10 weeks as described previously (17Ikemoto S. Takahashi M. Tsunoda N. Maruyama K. Itakura H. Ezaki O. Metabolism. 1996; 45: 1539-1546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Some of these animals were administered isocohumulone or isohumulone, in 0.2 m sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.7), orally, each at doses of 10 or 100 mg/kg body weight for their final 14 days on the diet; oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were then performed on these animals. Other mice similarly received either 5 or 50 mg/kg body weight of isocohumulone for 10 days, after which they were subjected to insulin tolerance testing (ITT). Plasma glucose, triglycerides, and free fatty acid levels were measured enzymatically with the glucose C II Wako, the triglyceride G test Wako, and the NEFA C Wako (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan), respectively.OGTT and ITT—For oral glucose testing, d-glucose (1g/kg body weight) was administered by stomach tube after an overnight fast. Blood samples were collected from the orbital sinus before and 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after delivery of the glucose load, under light anesthesia. For insulin tolerance testing, human insulin (Humulin R, Lilly) was injected intraperitoneally (0.75 units/kg body weight) into nonfasted animals. Blood samples were collected from the tail vein before and 15, 30, and 60 min after insulin injection, and blood glucose levels were determined using GLUTEST SENSOR (Sanwa Kagaku Kenkyusho Co., Ltd. Nagoya, Japan). Immunoreactive insulin was quantified using an insulin assay kit (Morinaga, Kanagawa, Japan). Plasma glucose level was measured as described above. The area under the glucose (1 mg/dl = 1 cm) and insulin (1 ng/ml = 1 cm) curves generated from data collected during the OGTT (60 min = 1 cm) was calculated using WinNonlin Standard Node version 3.1 software (Pharsight Corp., Mountain View, CA). The insulin resistance index (IR) was calculated by multiplying the glucose area by the insulin area, as described previously (18Mondon C.E. Dolkas C.B. Oyama J. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 240: E482-E488PubMed Google Scholar).RNA Preparation and Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan), and 5 μg of total RNA were utilized for reverse transcription using oligo(dT) primers with the ThermoScript™ RT-PCR system (Invitrogen). The reverse transcription products were used for quantitative PCR, which was carried out with the LightCycler™ PCR and Detection System using a FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Diagnostics) as described previously (19Cohen B. Barkan D. Levy Y. Goldberg I. Fridman E. Kopolovic J. Rubinstein M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7697-7700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Relative expression levels of the mRNA of the target genes were normalized to 36B4 (20Laborda J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of isohumulones on PPARα and fatty acid oxidation in liver, specific primers for acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO) and fatty acid translocase/CD36 (FAT) genes were used. The primers specific for adipocyte differentiation-related protein (adipocyte-ADRP) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL), targets for PPARγ and involved in lipid uptake and storage, were also used for the analysis. The following sense and antisense primers were used (GenBank™ accession numbers are in parentheses) as follows: 36B4 (X15267), nucleotides 740-759 and 907-929; adipocyte-ADRP (NM024406), nucleotides 218-236 and 364-385; LPL (NM008509), nucleotides 37-58 and 242-265; ACO (AF006688), nucleotides 1392-1415 and 1607-1628; FAT (L23108), nucleotides 331-352 and 509-531.Acyl-CoA Oxidase Activity—Activity of ACO was determined as described previously (21Kushiro M. Masaoka T. Hageshita S. Takahashi Y. Ide T. Sugano M. J. Nutr. Biochem. 2002; 13: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6-week-old female C57BL/6N mice fed a standard diet were orally administered 100 mg/kg body weight of isohumulone or isocohumulone for 6 days. Their livers were then isolated and homogenized in a solution containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 3 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.2). The homogenates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min, and their supernatants were used as an enzyme source, and peroxisomal palmitoyl-CoA oxidation rates were analyzed.Histological Analysis of Adipose Tissue and Determination of Adipocyte Size—C57BL/6N mice that were fed a high fat diet for 10 weeks were orally administered isocohumulone or isohumulone at a dose of 100 mg/kg weight, or pioglitazone at a dose of 10 mg/kg weight, for 10 days after which their subcutaneous white adipose tissue was removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Fixed specimens were dehydrated, embedded in tissue-freezing medium (Tissue Tek OTC compound; Sakura Finetechnical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sections (14 μm) were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Adipocyte size was determined using Win-ROOF software (Mitani Co. Ltd., Fukui, Japan). More than 200 cells/mouse in each group were analyzed as described previously (22Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Miki H. Tamemoto H. Yamauchi T. Komeda K. Satoh S. Nakano R. Ishii C. Sugiyama T. Eto K.

Other sections were stained using the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling technique (Mebstain Apoptosis Kit Direct, Medical and Biological Laboratories Co. Ltd., Nagoya, Japan) to detect apoptotic nuclei.Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Pilot Study in Type 2 Diabetics—This study was approved by the ethics committee of Kirin Brewery Co., Ltd., and complied with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Twenty volunteers with mild type 2 diabetes (both males and females) were included in this study. Ten men and ten women were randomized into one of two groups receiving either placebo or a capsule containing 100 mg of IHE. The subjects were between 45 and 65 years of age (mean = 53 years) and had fasting blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels between 110 and 140 (mg/dl) and 6.4 and 8.0 (%), respectively. IHE, containing isohumulones at a purity of 79%, was used in this study. The ability of IHE to transactivate PPARα and -γ and to improve glucose tolerance in KK-Ay mice was identical to that seen with isohumulones isolated from the extract (data not shown). The subjects were randomized to one of two groups that received either a placebo or a capsule containing 100 mg of IHE (equivalent to about 80 mg of isohumulones) twice a day for 12 weeks. Laboratory tests were performed every 4 weeks for 12 weeks.Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as the means ± S.D. The data in the animal experiments were analyzed by nonrepeated measures analysis of variance followed by a Dunnett's test. Significance was assumed if the p value was <0.05.RESULTSIsohumulones Activate Both PPARα and PPARγ—Fig. 1 shows the chemical structure of three major homologs of isohumulones, isohumulone, isocohumulone, and isoadhumulone. The effects of isohumulones on PPARα and -γ were evaluated in transient co-transfection assays using mammalian cell lines. Because mammalian cell lines contain endogenous nuclear receptors that can complicate the interpretation of the results, chimera systems were used in which the ligand binding domain of PPARα or PPARγ was fused to the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (23Kliewer S.A. Sundseth S.S. Jones S.A. Brown P.J. Wisely G.B. Koble C.S. Devchand P. Wahli W. Willson T.M. Lenhard J.M. Lehmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4318-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar). To evaluate the ability for transactivation of PPARγ, an expression vector encoding chimeric PPARγ and GAL4 was transfected into CV-1 cells with a reporter plasmid containing the reporter luciferase gene with five GAL4 binding sites in the promoter region. In the case for PPARα, a chimeric plasmid encoding the full-length of PPARα protein fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 was used, because the chimeric construct containing PPARα ligand binding and GAL4 DNA binding domains did not provide enough luciferase activity in the presence of a PPARα agonist, fenofibrate (data not shown). Furthermore, human hepatoma cells, HepG2, instead of CV-1 were used for the assay to obtain a higher sensitivity.A dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity was observed following the addition of isohumulones to cells transfected with the PPARγ/GAL4 chimera construct. The addition of either 10 μm isohumulone, isocohumulone, or isoadhumulone induced a 3.8-, 3.5-, and 2.8-fold increase in luciferase activity, respectively, compared with the vehicle control (Fig. 2A). These activities were almost the same as those seen when 1 μm pioglitazone, a specific agonist of PPARγ, was added to the cells. Isohumulone and isocohumulone also activated the PPARα/GAL4 chimera construct in a dose-dependent manner; 10 μm isohumulone and isocohumulone increased luciferase activity by about 3.2- and 1.9-fold, respectively, compared with the vehicle control (Fig. 2B). Isoadhumulone had no effect on the PPARα/GAL4 chimera construct, suggesting that the side chain of isohumulone may be involved in the activation of the PPARα receptor. The activity of isohumulone at 30 μm was almost the same as that of 3 μm fenofibrate, a PPARα-selective agonist.Fig. 2Isohumulone-induced PPAR transactivation.A, CV-1 cells were co-transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid, pG5 luc, containing five copies of GAL4 upstream activating sequence in the promoter region and an expression vector for the human PPARγ ligand binding domain fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. Results are the relative luciferase expression levels normalized with the protein concentration of the cell lysates. B, HepG2 cells were co-transfected with pG5 luciferase, and an expression vector for the human PPARα coding region fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. Isohumulone (IH), isocohumulone (IcH), and isoadhumulone (IaH) at the indicated concentrations were added to the transfected cells. Pioglitazone (Pio) and fenofibrate (Feno) were used as positive controls for PPARγ and PPARα transactivation, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Isohumulones Prevent the Development of Diabetes in KK-Ay Mice—Treatment of KK-Ay mice with isohumulones for 2 weeks significantly lowered their plasma triglyceride (62.6% for isohumulone and 76.4% for isocohumulone, respectively) and free fatty acid levels (73.1% for isohumulone and 84.8% for isocohumulone, respectively). These reductions were comparable with those seen in 0.05% pioglitazone-treated mice (60.5 and 69.9%, respectively) (Fig. 3, A and B). The nonfasting plasma glucose levels of isohumulones-treated mice were also reduced to 65.3% of controls for isohumulone and 87.1% of controls for isocohumulone, although they were higher than those seen in animals fed pioglitazone (35.1%) (Fig. 3C). Most interesting, there was a significant difference in body weight gain between these groups despite their equivalent caloric intake. Thus, pioglitazone induced a 10% increase in body weight, whereas isohumulones did not induce an increase in body weight compared with the control group (Fig. 3D).Fig. 3Isohumulone and isocohumulone prevented the development of diabetes in KK-Ay mice. Male KK-Ay mice were fed either a standard diet or a diet containing 0.18% isohumulone (IH), 0.18% isocohumulone (IcH), or 0.05% pioglitazone (Pio) for 2 weeks. Fasting blood samples were collected, and plasma triglyceride and free fatty acid levels were measured (A and B). Nonfasting plasma glucose levels were also determined (C), and body weights were measured weekly (D).

On their last 14 days on the diet, they were orally administered isocohumulone. OGTTs and ITTs were performed on their 10th and 14th day of isocohumulone treatment, respectively. After glucose loading, plasma glucose levels in the mice treated with isocohumulone at 10 and 100 mg/kg/day were significantly reduced compared with mice treated with vehicle at all time points except for the mouse treated with 100 mg/kg of isocohumulone at 120 min (Fig. 4A). Fasting plasma insulin levels were significantly reduced in animals treated with 100 mg/kg isocohumulone (2396 ± 520 and 1605 ± 570 (pg/ml) for vehicle-treated and 100 mg isocohumulone-treated mice, respectively). Plasma insulin levels during the OGTT were also reduced in the isocohumulone-treated animals (Fig. 4B). The insulin resistance indices of mice treated with isocohumulone (1094.4 ± 259.2 and 1034.0 ± 259.2 for 10 mg of isocohumulone-treated and 100 mg of isocohumulone-treated mice, respectively) were significantly (p < 0.01 using the Dunnett's test) lower than that seen in the control group (2217.3 ± 792.9), indicating that isocohumulone improved insulin sensitivity in mice fed a high fat diet. Improvement in insulin sensitivity was also observed by the treatment with isohumulone; significant decrease in IR was observed in the group receiving 100 mg/kg of isohumulone (1240.2 ± 259.5, p < 0.01 using the Dunnett's test, data not shown). Results of the ITT showed a greater glucose lowering effect in mice treated with isocohumulone for 10 days than in vehicle-treated animals (Fig. 4C). Plasma glucose levels in mice treated with 5 or 50 mg/kg of isocohumulone were significantly reduced to 76.8 and 69.3% of controls after 60 min and to 82.8 and 69.3% of controls after 120 min.Fig. 4Isocohumulone ameliorated insulin resistance in high fat diet-fed C57BL/6N mice. Female C57BL/6N mice were fed a high fat diet for 10 weeks. For glucose tolerance testing, isocohumulone (IcH) was orally administered to mice at a dose of 10 or 100 mg/kg body weight for 14 days. The mice were then subjected to an OGTT. Control (Ctrl) mice received buffer alone. Plasma glucose (A) and insulin (B) concentrations were plotted on the graph (mean ± S.D., n = 5-6). For insulin tolerance testing, high fat diet-fed mice were administered isocohumulone at a dose of 5 or 50 mg/kg body weight for 10 days. Blood glucose concentrations during the ITT were plotted on the graph (mean ± S.D., n = 6) (C). *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 for vehicle versus treatment with isocohumulone at each indicated time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Isohumulones Up-regulated the Expression of Genes Involved in Fatty Acid Oxidation in the Liver—Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis of the mRNAs for ACO and fatty acid translocase/CD36 (FAT) genes in the liver of KK-Ay mice treated with isohumulone, isocohumulone, or pioglitazone were performed (Fig. 5A). ACO and FAT, whose expressions are regulated by PPARα, are involved in peroxisomal β-oxidation of fatty acids and in the uptake of long chain fatty acids through the cell membrane, respectively (24Memon R.A.

Treatment of mice with isohumulone, isocohumulone, or pioglitazone increased ACO and its mRNA levels by 1.6-, 1.7-, and 2.7-fold, and FAT mRNA levels by 2.9-, 3.3-, and 2.8-fold, compared with the control mice, respectively. The significant increase in ACO and FAT mRNA levels in the pioglitazone-treated mice was likely due to activation of PPARα by pioglitazone because induction of PPARα/GAL4 chimera transactivation with pioglitazone was observed in our reporter assay (date not shown). An increase in the activity of ACO was observed in the liver of C57BL/6N mice treated with isohumulone or isocohumulone (Fig. 5B).Fig. 5Effects of isohumulone and isocohumulone on liver and white adipose tissue.A and C, total RNA was isolated from liver and subcutaneous adipose tissue of KK-Ay mice fed diets containing 0.18% isohumulone (IH), 0.18% isocohumulone (IcH), or 0.05% pioglitazone (pio).

One of these factors, AK155 or IL-26, was discovered because of its overexpression in human T lymphocytes after growth transformation by the simian rhadinovirus herpesvirus saimiri. In addition, the gene is transcribed in various types of primary and immortalized T-cells. Here we describe epithelial cells, namely colon carcinoma cells and keratinocytes, as targets of this T-cellular lymphokine. Purified recombinant IL-26 induced the rapid phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription factors 1 and 3. As a result, secretion of IL-10 and IL-8, as well as cell surface expression of CD54 were enhanced. Moreover, we show that the IL-26 protein binds to heparin, is released from the cell surface, and can be functionally inhibited by heparin. The sensitivity to recombinant IL-26 of various cell lines strictly correlated with the expression of the long chain of the IL-20 receptor. Because blocking antibodies against either the short chain of the IL-10 receptor or the long chain of the IL-20 receptor inhibited IL-26-dependent signal transduction, and transient expression of these receptor chains induced IL-26 responsivity in non-sensitive cells, we propose that the IL-20 receptor 1 and IL-10 receptor 2 chains participate in forming the IL-26 receptor.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2557-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) comprises a series of initially orphan receptor chains in addition to the prototypic heterodimeric receptor for IL-10. The IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) consists of a long transmembrane chain (IL-10R1, Ref. 30Liu Y. Wei S.H. Ho A.S. de Waal Malefyt R. Moore K.W. J.

Thus, our aim was to define the role of IL-26 in this complicated functional environment of the IL-10 cytokine family members and their receptors. Cell Cultures—Human Colo-205 and SW-403 colon carcinoma, HepG2 hepatoma, HeLa cervical carcinoma, Panc-I pancreatic carcinoma, RTS3b (kindly provided by Irene Leigh, London) and SCC12F skin carcinoma (kindly provided by Lawrence Young, Birmingham), and 293T human embryonal kidney cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human Lovo and Colo-320 colon carcinoma cells, the Hodgkin's line KMH-2, the T-leukemia line Jurkat, and Chinese hamster ovary cells were kept in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. The primary human keratinocyte line HaCaT in an early passage was kindly provided by Norbert Fusenig (Heidelberg) and cultivated as published (38Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar). Cultures of CB-15, CB-84, and other HVS-transformed human T-cells followed published protocols (39Biesinger B. Müller-Fleckenstein I. Simmer B. Lang G. Wittmann S. Platzer E. Desrosiers R.C.

Methods Microbiol. 2002; 32: 657-692Crossref Google Scholar). Monocytes were purified from fresh blood using magnetic beads with antibodies against CD14 (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach). Dendritic cells were differentiated from primary CD14+ monocytes (41Zhou L.J. Tedder T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2588-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe) with described FLAG-tagged IL-26 expression constructs (4Knappe A. Hör S. Wittmann S. Fickenscher H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3881-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). For the reconstitution of the IL-26 receptor in a non-responsive cell line, Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected in 24-well plates using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) and 2 μg of plasmid DNA per well. The IL-20R1 and IL-10R2 cDNAs were expressed from pcDEF3-based vectors (31Kotenko S.V. Krause C.D. Izotova L.S. Pollack B.P. Wu W. Pestka S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 894-5903Crossref Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 34Dumoutier L. Leemans C. Lejeune D. Kotenko S.V. Renauld J.C. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3545-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) served as a transfection control. The transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells were treated with IL-26 or control medium at 36 h post-transfection for 30 min at room temperature and then lysed for Western blot analysis. The heparin drug Liquemin N was purchased from Roche Pharmaceuticals, biotinylated heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa was purchased from Merck (Schwalbach), chondroitin sulfate A (chondroitin-4 sulfate) from bovine trachea, chondroitin sulfate B (dermatan sulfate) from porcine intestinal mucosa, chondroitin sulfate C (chondroitin-6 sulfate) from shark cartilage, heparan sulfate from bovine kidney, and heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa were purchased from Sigma (Taufkirchen). Cytokine Purification and Interaction Studies—The cell-free supernatant of HVS-transformed human T-cells was passed through a heparin-agarose column (1 ml, Amersham Biosciences). After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, proteins were eluted with 0.6 and 2.0 m of NaCl. The fractions were tested for IL-26 by Western blotting. Recombinant N-terminally histidine-tagged IL-26 (His-IL-26) was highly purified (at least 95%, according to Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels) after denaturation via nickel-chelate chromatography from bacterial lysates and stepwise renaturation, as published previously (4Knappe A. Hör S. Wittmann S. Fickenscher H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3881-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). For each individual preparation, the concentration-dependent biological activity was titrated on Colo-205 cells for STAT3 phosphorylation in Western blots in order to permit comparable test conditions. The purified His-IL-26 protein was also used to raise polyclonal antisera in rabbits (Charles River, Kisslegg). To test for a direct interaction between IL-26 and heparin, polystyrene microwell surfaces (MaxiSorp plates, Nunc, Wiesbaden) were coated with IL-26 (up to 20 μg/ml) for 2 h at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was blocked with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 3% fetal bovine serum for 2 h at room temperature. As probe for the interaction, biotinylated heparin (up to 10 μg/ml) was added in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h at room temperature. After washing twice with water, a streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate (R&D systems, Wiesbaden; 1:200 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline) was added for 1 h at room temperature followed by two washing steps with water. Finally, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine peroxidase substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry, Gaithersburg, MD) was added, and the reaction was stopped with 5% H2SO4. The absorbance was read at 450 nm using a Multiskan Ascent microplate photometer (Thermo Electron, Dreieich). Similar solid phase interaction experiments were performed to test the interaction of IL-26 or IL-20 with the extracellular domain of IL-20R1. For this purpose, 293T cells were transiently transfected with expression constructs for either the extracellular domain of IL-20R1, FLAG-tagged IL-20 (IL-20FLAG in pCEP4, Ref. 33Xie M.H. Aggarwal S. Ho W.H. Foster J. Zhang Z. Stinson J. Wood W.I. Goddard A.D. Gurney A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31335-31339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) or GFP (pEGFPN1, Clontech) as a control. The extracellular domain of IL-20R1 was amplified using the primers HF894 5′-GGCCCAGCCGGCCGTTCCCT GTGTCTCTGGTGG-3′ and HF898 5′-GGATCCCGTTCTGTTTGATTTAGTATTC-3′ after reverse transcription from HaCaT total RNA and cloned into pSeqTagHygroB (Invitrogen). Culture supernatants were harvested 48 h after transfection. Polystyrene plates were coated with 200 μl of supernatant from 293T cells expressing the extracellular domain of IL-20R1 or GFP overnight at 4 °C. The probes with either purified, recombinant His-IL-26 (0.1 or 1.0 ng), or IL-20 FLAG-containing culture supernatant, or phosphate-buffered saline alone were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, the plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with mouse monoclonal antibodies against the FLAG tag (mouse anti-FLAG M2, Sigma; 1:2000 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% fetal calf serum) or the His tag (mouse anti-penta-His, Qiagen 1:1000 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% fetal calf serum), respectively. This was followed by another 3-fold washing and incubation with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibodies (Dianova, Hamburg, 1:2000 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% fetal calf serum) for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were washed again, and binding was detected and quantified as described. Three chemically synthesized peptides (Biosyntan, Berlin, Germany or Coring, Gernsheim, Germany) with blocked end groups were used for circular dichroism spectroscopy studies of the cytokine-heparin interaction: IL-10AB (residues 14-58 of mature IL-10, representing the helices A and B: HFPGNLPNMLRDLRDAFSRVKTFFQMKDQLDNLLLKESLLEDFKG); IL-26AB (residues 14-57 of mature IL-26, representing the helices A and B: RGTLSQAVDALYIKAAWLKATIPEDRIKNIRLLKKKTKKQF-MKN); IL-26B (residues 37-54 of mature IL-26, representing helix B: EDRIKNIRLLKKKTKKQF). Far-ultraviolet circular dichroism spectra of IL-10AB, IL-26AB, and IL-26B were recorded at 20 °C in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4 in a 10-mm cell from 195 to 250 nm at 50 nm/min on a Jasco J810 circular dichroism spectropolarimeter at a peptide concentration of 10 μm. For the heparin titration experiments a 1-, 2-, and 3-fold molar excess of heparin (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) was added to the peptide samples. At each heparin concentration, reference spectra were measured in order to allow for a subsequent correction for the heparin signal in the CD spectra. All spectra were measured eight times and averaged for each peptide and reference sample. The ellipticity [Θ]MRW was calculated after subtraction of the reference from the peptide spectra. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction—The expression of type II cytokine receptor chains was tested by RT-PCR. Total cellular RNA was prepared by the acidic phenol-chloroform method. Using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random oligonucleotide primers, cDNA was prepared. The following primers were used for PCR: HF855 5′-ACTTCAGCCTCCTAACCTC-3′ and HF856 5′-CTATTGCTGCTGCCACTAC-3′ (IL-10R1, 534-bp fragment), HF857 5′-TATTGGACCCCCTGGAATG-3′ and HF858 5′-GTAAACGCACCACAGCAAG-3′ (IL-10R2, 411-bp fragment), HF859 5′-CTGTGTCTCTGGTGGTTTG-3′ and HF860 5′-CGCAGTAAAGAGTGTTCGG-3′ (IL-20R1, 553-bp fragment as main product), HF861 5′-CAGACAGAATGTGTGGAGG-3′ and HF862 5′-TTAGACAAACCACCCTGCC-3′ (IL-20R2, 449-bp fragment), HF863 5′-GATATGTCACCAAGCCGCC-3′ and HF864 5′-GTCTTTGCCAGAACCTTCC-3′ (IL-22R, 484-bp fragment), JCS1146 5′-GGGAACCAAGGAGCTGCTATG-3′ and JCS1147 5′-TGGCACTGAGGCAGTGGTGTT-3′ (IL-28R, 370-bp fragment), HF147 5′-GCAGGGGGGAGCCAAAAGGG-3′ and HF148 5′-TGCCAGCCCCAGCGTCAAAG-3′ (glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, GAPDH, 570-bp fragment). Immunoprecipitation, Western Blotting, and Flow Cytometry—For immunoprecipitation, up to 10 ml of culture supernatant were used. Anti-IL-26 serum (100 μl) was first preincubated with 50 μl of protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science). After washing the beads in phosphate-buffered saline, the culture supernatants were added to the coated beads and agitated overnight at 4 °C. After 3-fold washing, the beads were heat-denatured and loaded on polyacrylamide gels. For Western blotting, proteins from denaturing polyacrylamide gels were transferred onto polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Millipore, Eschborn) by semidry electrotransfer. STAT factor signaling was investigated with the following rabbit antibodies: STAT1 (9172), pSTAT1 (against phosphorylated tyrosine residue 701 of STAT1, 9171), STAT3 (9132), pSTAT3 (against phosphorylated tyrosine residue 705 or STAT3, 9131, all from Cell Signaling Technology, Frankfurt). In cultures, the following antibodies were used in order to block IL-26-mediated signaling: polyclonal rabbit antisera against recombinant His-IL-26 (Charles River), affinity-purified polyclonal goat antibody against IL-26 (AF1375, R&D Systems), murine monoclonal anti-IL-10R1 (3F9, DNAX Research Institute, Palo Alto), and murine monoclonal anti-IL-10R2 (MAB874, R&D Systems). To produce polyclonal murine anti-IL-20R1 antibodies, P815 mastocytoma cells were transfected with the human IL-20R1 cDNA cloned into the pEF-BOS plasmid before injection into DBA/2 mice. After rejection of the tumors, the sera of these mice had high titers of neutralizing anti-hIL-20R1 antibodies and were used at a 1:500 dilution. IL-8 and IL-10 production was measured using Duoset ELISA antibody sets (R&D Systems). Flow cytometry was performed with antibodies against CD50 (ICAM-3, clone HP2/19), CD54 (ICAM-1, clone 84H10), and CD102 (ICAM-2, clone BT-1; all from Beckman Coulter). Cell Surface Association of IL-26—In contrast to eukaryotic expression systems for other related cytokines, only a small fraction of IL-26 was detectable in secreted form, whereas most of the intrinsically expressed or recombinant IL-26 was found to be cell-associated (4Knappe A. Hör S. Wittmann S. Fickenscher H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3881-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculated that this association could be caused by the attachment of IL-26 to cell surface proteoglycans. In the presence of low heparin concentrations (20 units/ml) in the culture medium of HVS-transformed T-cells, the yields of IL-26 immunoprecipitations using rabbit antisera against the recombinant His-tagged IL-26 protein were strongly enhanced (Fig. 1A). Moreover, the amounts of IL-26 in the culture supernatants of transfected 293T cells were strongly augmented when heparin was added to the medium (Fig. 1B). Correspondingly, native IL-26 from supernatants of HVS-transformed T-cells was efficiently enriched on a heparin column. Whereas 0.6 m salt did not influence the retention of the cytokine on the column, IL-26 was eluted in the first fractions in 2 m sodium chloride (Fig. 1C). This strongly suggests that IL-26 is attached to the cell surface through binding to proteoglycans. The direct interaction of IL-26 with heparin was further investigated by solid phase binding experiments on polystyrene surfaces in which the amounts of both IL-26 and biotin-conjugated heparin correlated with signal strength (Fig. 1D). To further confirm this interaction, we used circular dichroism spectroscopy to monitor heparin-dependent structural changes in IL-10- and IL-26-derived peptides. The choice of the IL-26 peptides investigated was guided by the published sequence alignment of the IL-10 cytokine family (9Fickenscher H. Hör S. Küpers H. Wittmann S. Knappe A. Sticht H. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and by the length and location of the secondary structure elements deduced from the IL-10 crystal structure. One peptide (IL-26B) corresponds to helix B of the IL-10 family cytokines and contains an IL-26-sp"
https://openalex.org/W2007762885,"S100 calcium-binding proteins such as S100B are elevated in primary malignant melanoma and are used as markers for this and numerous other cancers. Wild-type p53 protein levels are relatively low in these cancer cells (i.e. when compared with cells without S100B) but are elevated when RNA antisense to S100B is introduced. This result implicates S100B in the down-regulation of p53 and is consistent with the large decreases in p53 protein levels observed previously in transient co-transfections of p53 and S100B (Lin, J., Blake, M., Tang, C., Zimmer, D., Rustandi, R. R., Weber, D. J., and Carrier, F. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 35037–35041). Down-regulation of p53 in primary malignant melanoma cells is likely the result of a direct interaction with S100B, which was observed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Furthermore, p53 binds regions of the S100B promoter, one of which matches the 20-nucleotide p53-binding consensus DNA sequence perfectly. Therefore, when p53 levels increase, it contributes to its own demise by up-regulating the transcription of S100B as part of a negative feedback loop. This is analogous to what is found for another protein that down-regulates p53, namely hdm2 (human double mutant 2).

This is analogous to what is found for another protein that down-regulates p53, namely hdm2 (human double mutant 2). The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription activator that signals for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and plays a pivotal role in the maintenance and regulation of normal cellular functions (1Levine A.J.

If p53 is inactivated by mutation, as is found in >50% of human cancers, the cell cycle proceeds unregulated, and cell growth proliferates. Likewise, apoptosis pathways are not induced, and proliferating cells transform into cancerous ones (3Woods D.B. Vousden K.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 10Agarwal M.L. Taylor W.R. Chernov M.V. Chernova O.B. Stark G.R. J. Biol.

On the other hand, if p53 levels are too high, then phenotypes associated with aging, particularly those associated with problems in skin and bone, are observed (11Tyner S.D. Venkatachalam S. Choi J.

Nature. 2002; 415: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). For these reasons, it is important that p53 protein levels are highly regulated, which is achieved by post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins inside the cell (5Appella E.

The interactions of p53 with members of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins (i.e. S100B) are particularly intriguing because they link p53 biology to calcium-mediated signal transduction pathways. There are now >20 members of the S100 family of EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins, and they are widely distributed in human tissue (16Zimmer D.B. Cornwall E.H. Landar A. Song W. Brain Res.

In a manner similar to that of calmodulin, a Ca2+-dependent conformational change is required for S100B to bind target proteins such as p53 (20Rustandi R.R. Baldisseri D.M. Weber D.J. Nat. Struct.

Although it is not completely clear how S100 proteins affect cell growth, S100B and several other S100 proteins (i.e. S100A1, mts1) interact with the tumor suppressor protein p53, resulting in significantly reduced p53 levels, and p53-dependent transcription activation of target genes is inhibited (22Grigorian M.

In primary malignant melanoma cancer cells, we report here that S100B interacts directly with p53 and that inhibiting S100B with siRNA restores the functional p53 protein. These data support the notion that higher than normal levels of S100B, as found in malignant melanoma, are likely contributing to tumor progression by excessive down-regulation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Cells and Cell Treatments—Primary human melanoma C8146A cells were obtained from Dr. Frank L. Meyskens (University of California, Irvine, CA). The cells were grown in F-10 media (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The human glioblastoma U118 MG cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. All of the other melanoma cell lines were purchased from the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, NCI-Frederick, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD, and grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum. The human large cell lung carcinoma H1299 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The human colorectal carcinoma cell line RKO was provided by Al Fornace, Jr. (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), and the cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The UV source was a Philips 30-watt germicidal lamp, and the intensities of the UV lamp were determined with a UVX Radiometer (UVP Inc., Upland, CA). Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase (CAT) Assays—A fragment of the S100B promoter (nucleotides (nt) 1The abbreviations used are: nt, nucleotide(s); CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; hdm2, human double mutant 2; siRNA, small interference RNA. 1–3080; GenBank™ numbering) containing seven consensus p53 binding sites (prS100B-1 to prS100B-7) 2Regions of the S100B promoter that are similar to or match the p53 binding consensus sequence (5′-RRRC(A/T)(T/A)GYYY-3′ 0–13 nt 5′-RRRC(A/T)(T/A)GYYY-3′) are listed below. The nucleotides 1705–1735 in the S100B promoter (termed prS100B-3; 5′-GGGCAAGCTC-3′ 11 nt 5′-GAGCAAGCCT-3′) match perfectly (20/20) the consensus nucleotide sequence for p53 binding. Six additional p53 binding sites occur in the S100B promoter, including the following: nucleotides 149–169 (prS-100B-1; 5′-GGACTTtCaC-3′ 1nt 5′-AAACTTcTCC-3′) and 2172–2292 (prS100B-6; 5′-GGACACATcTCT-3′ 1nt 5′-AGGCATcgTC-3′) that match 17 nucleotides in the p53 consensus sequence (17/20); the nucleotides 1455–1478 (prS100B-2; 5′-GGGCAgGCCC-3′ 4 nt GGGGcctCCT-3′) and 2795–2820 (prS100B-7; 5′-cAGCAAGTCC-3′ 6nt 5′-ctGCTTGgTC-3′) that match 16 nucleotides of the p53 consensus sequence (16/20); and the nucleotides 1995–2021 (prS100B-4; 5′-AAACTgGgTT-3′ 7 nt 5′-GGACgTGaTg-3′) and 2115–2146 (prS100B-5; 5′-AttCTTGTga-3′ 12 nt AAACTgGCCC-3′), which match 15 sites (15/20). The p53 binding regions in the third intron of GADD45 (19/20 match; 5′-GAACATGTCT-3′ 0 nt 5′-AAGCATGCTg-3′) and the hdm2 promoter RE1 (18/20 match; 5′-GGtCAAGTTC-3′ 0 nt 5′-AGACAcGTTC-3′) and RE2 (17/20 match; 5′-AGttAAGTCC-3′ 0 nt 5′-tGACTTGTCT-3′) are also listed for comparison. Nucleotides shown in lower case do not match the consensus sequence. and three shorter fragments (nt 1435–3080, containing prS100B-2 to prS100B-7; nt 1679–3080, containing prS100B-3 to prS100B-7; and nt 1744–3080, containing prS100B-4 to prS100B-7) of the human S100B promoter (GenBank™ accession number M59486) were amplified by PCR from the pGBS-4437 plasmid (Linda Van Eldik, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL) containing the full-length human S100B promoter (25Castets F. Griffin W.S. Marks A. Van Eldik L.J. Brain Res. 1997; 46: 208-216Google Scholar). The four PCR products were each inserted into the KpnI and XhoI sites of the pCAT3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and used for transient transfection. The CAT reporter gene construct containing five GADD45 p53-binding sites (p53REX) was provided by Al Fornace Jr. (NCI, National Institutes of Health). The expression vectors used in this study for p53 and GADD153 have been described previously (23Lin J. Blake M. Tang C. Zimmer D. Rustandi R.R. Weber D.J. Carrier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35037-35041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The plasmids were transiently transfected into H1299 cells, and the CAT assay was performed as described previously (23Lin J. Blake M. Tang C. Zimmer D. Rustandi R.R. Weber D.J. Carrier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35037-35041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) with the exception that 50 μg (S100B promoter) or 0.5 μg (GADD45 p53 binding site) of cellular extracts were used for the assay. For transcription activation of the S100B promoter by endogenous p53 without or with UV treatment, the CAT assay was performed as above with the exception that no p53 plasmid was co-transfected, and 25 μg (S100B promoter) or 2.5 μg (GADD45 p53 binding site) of cellular extracts were used for the assay. The levels of CAT activity were evaluated by a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) using the ImageQuant software, and the percentage of relative errors was <15% for each experiment done in quadruplicate. Small Interference RNA (siRNA)—The 2-nt double-stranded RNA was synthesized by Ambion (Austin, TX) with standard purification. The sequence (5′-GGAAUUCAUGGCCUUUGUU-3′) corresponds to the S100B C-terminal end (nt 216–234) plus a two dT 3′-overhang. This region of S100B was chosen because it is a region of sequence that is not homologous with other S100 proteins and, thus, is specific for S100B. Scramble siRNA was bought from Ambion (Silencer negative control number 1 siRNA, catalog number 4611). Different concentrations of siRNA (2 and 20 nm) were transfected into C8146A melanoma cells using Ambion siPORT lipid transfection agent according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The cells were harvested 48 h later and analyzed by Western blots (see below). Western Blots—The Western blot analyses were performed, as described previously (23Lin J. Blake M. Tang C. Zimmer D. Rustandi R.R. Weber D.J. Carrier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35037-35041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), on 100 μg of C8146A protein extracts or on 100 μg of U118MG protein extracts. The cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% non-ionic detergent P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 mm dithiothreitol). The proteins were run on a 12% polyacrylamide gel, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and reacted with either p53 mouse monoclonal antibody (DO-1, Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA) at 1:1000 dilution, S100B rabbit polyclonal antibody (Research Diagnostics Inc., Flanders, NJ) at 1:1000 dilution, p21 rabbit monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) at 1:100, Bcl-2 mouse monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Research Products) at 1:100 dilution, MDM2 mouse monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Research Products) at 1:100 dilution, or actin mouse monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Research Products) at 1:5000 dilution to control for even protein loading. The blots were then reacted with their respective secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and reacted with a chemiluminescence substrate (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the manufacturer. Recombinant S100B protein was produced and purified to homogeneity as described previously (23Lin J. Blake M. Tang C. Zimmer D. Rustandi R.R. Weber D.J. Carrier F. J. Biol.

The cell pellets were lysed for 2 h in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm. The supernatants (1 mg) were incubated with either p53 antibody (DO-1, cross-linked to agarose beads; Oncogene Research Products) or S100B antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Myc mouse monoclonal antibody (cross-linked to agarose bead; Oncogene Research Products) and His rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as a negative controls (i.e. as non-related antibodies). Protein A-agarose beads (50 μl; Oncogene Research Products) were then added to the antibody-cell extract mixture, and all reactions were mixed gently overnight at 4 °C. The beads were spun down and washed six times with lysis buffer without detergent and loaded on a 12% polyacrylamide gel for SDS-PAGE. The samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with control antibody, S100B antibody, or p53 antibody as described above. A peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody that does not cross-react with the IgG heavy chain (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) was used to detect p53 co-immunoprecipitated with the S100B antibody. Mobility Shift Assay—The electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed essentially as described previously (27Carrier F. Bae I. Smith M.L. Ayers D.M. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mut. Res. 1996; 352: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with the exception that salmon sperm DNA (1 μg) and purified recombinant p53 were used. The baculovirus-expressed p53 was obtained from Proteomics Inc. (Baltimore, MD). Baculovirus-expressed p53 was used (0.6 and 3 μg) for binding to the GADD45 and the S100B oligonucleotides, respectively. The probes were purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (Vydac C-4) and labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) as described previously (27Carrier F. Bae I. Smith M.L. Ayers D.M. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mut. Res. 1996; 352: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide sequences from the S100B promoter matching 20 (termed prS100B-3), 17 (termed prS100B-1), and 16 (termed prS100B-2) nucleotides of the 20 nucleotide consensus p53 binding site (see footnote 2) were sense 5′-GCC TGG GCA AGC TCT GTG CTT CAC AGA GCA AGC CTG TGT-3′, sense 5′-GTT CTG GGA CTT TCA CTA AAC TTC TCC TAC CAT-3′, and sense 5′-CAG AGG GCA GGC CCG GCT GGG CCC TCC TGC TGA-3′. Wild-type S100B and p53 Protein Levels in Primary Malignant Melanoma Cells—Primary malignant C8146A melanoma cells have relatively high levels of S100B, but wild-type p53 levels are markedly lower in these cancer cells as compared with U118 cells with little or no S100B (Fig. 1A). This observation is consistent with what is found in transient co-transfections of S100B and p53, where levels of the tumor suppressor protein were significantly reduced by the addition of S100B (>100-fold) (23Lin J. Blake M. Tang C. Zimmer D. Rustandi R.R. Weber D.J. Carrier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35037-35041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Using increasing amounts of purified recombinant S100B protein (Fig. 1A; lanes 3–6), we estimated that the levels of S100B in the melanoma C8146A cells are at least 50 times higher than in the U118 cells (Fig. 1A). To verify whether the S100B-p53 correlation was specific to C8146A cells or could be found in other melanoma cells, we performed Western blots analysis in five other melanoma cell lines known to have a p53 wild-type genotype (28O'Connor P.M. Jackman J. Bae I. Myers T.G. Fan S. Mutoh M. Scudiero D.A. Monks A. Sausville E.A. Weinstein J.N. Friend S. Fornace Jr., A.J. Kohn K. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4285-4300PubMed Google Scholar). The data shown in Fig. 1B indicate that cells having relatively low S100B levels (i.e. LOX-IM VI, UACC-62, and SK-MEL-5) have higher levels of p53, whereas in UACC-2571, C8146A, and Malme 3M cells the S100B levels are relatively high and the p53 levels are lower as compared with the other melanoma lines. This indicates that the S100B-p53 correlation (i.e. high S100B/low p53 levels) is consistent in at least six melanoma cell lines. To determine whether S100B contributes directly to the lowering of p53 levels in the melanoma cancer cells, siRNA corresponding to the C terminus of S100B (siRNAS100B) was introduced into primary C8146A melanoma cells and compared with results from scrambled siRNA that does not interfere with S100B production (Fig. 2). The addition of the S100B antisense RNA lowered S100B levels by 2.4 ± 0.3-fold and correspondingly, increases in p53 levels (2.5 ± 0.3-fold) were observed (Fig. 2; 20 nm siRNAS100B). Likewise, levels of the p21 protein, Bcl-2, and hdm2 (i.e. genes activated by p53) were also up-regulated by comparable amounts with the addition of the siRNA of S100B when p53 levels are elevated (Fig. 2). These results with antisense RNA indicate that S100B contributes directly to the down-regulation of functional p53 inside primary malignant melanoma cancer cells and that inhibiting S100B protein production with siRNAS100B restores active p53. S100B Interacts with p53 in Malignant Melanoma—Numerous studies have characterized the high affinity Ca2+-dependent interaction between S100B and p53 in vitro (20Rustandi R.R. Baldisseri D.M. Weber D.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 21Rustandi R.R. Drohat A.C. Baldisseri D.M. Wilder P.T. Weber D.J.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2000: 521-539Google Scholar). However, it is critically important to determine whether S100B and p53 interact directly inside cells. To do this, co-immunoprecipitation of the S100B-p53 complex was monitored in C8416 melanoma cells (Fig. 3). The data in Fig. 3 indicate that, in addition to the immunoprecipitation of S100B, the S100B antibody can co-immunoprecipitate p53 (lane 1). The reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiment performed with p53 antibody (lane 2) confirmed the formation of a complex between p53 and S100B in primary malignant melanoma (C8416 cells). As a control, it was shown that nonspecific antibodies of the same isotype could not immunoprecipitate p53 (lane 3) and S100B (lane 4). Therefore, it is likely that a direct interaction between the S100B and p53 proteins contributes to decreased levels of the tumor suppressor, p53, in melanoma with elevated S100B. Regions of the S100B Promoter Bind p53—When p53 protein levels rise, the transcription of a number of genes involved in the cell cycle and apoptosis are activated. As part of a feedback loop, p53 also up-regulates the transcription of hdm2 (mdm2 in mice), a protein involved in the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53 itself (7Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar, 32Freedman D.A. Wu L. Levine A.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 96-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 33Momand J. Wu H.H. Dasgupta G. Gene. 2000; 242: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In a situation analogous to that of hdm2, the promoter for S100B has seven regions in its promoter (named prS100B-1 to prS100B-7) that correspond to the consensus sequence for p53 binding.2 In fact, one DNA sequence, prS100B-3, matches perfectly the 20-nucleotide p53-binding consensus sequence (20/20 nucleotide match).2 Mobility shift assays (Fig. 4) were performed with purified p53 to determine whether sequences in the promoter of S100B (prS100B-1, prS100B-2, and prS100B-3) were bona fide p53 binding sites, using the p53 regulatory sequence from GADD45, a p53 downstream effector gene (34Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. el-Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2930) Google Scholar), as a positive control. The data shown in Fig. 4 indicate that a complex of slower mobility was generated with both GADD45 and the prS100B-3 probes (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 5, respectively). Moreover, both bands were super-shifted by the p53 antibody (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 6, respectively) and, thus, represent genuine p53 complexes. However, despite the fact that the prS100B-3 sequence matches the consensus sequence perfectly, five times more protein and DNA were necessary to generate the protein-DNA complex with the prS100B-3 promoter sequence when compared with data from the GADD45 sequence (Fig. 4). In a separate experiment, when equal concentrations of protein and DNA were used in such band shift assays, the intensity of the super-shifted DNA band, as measured by densitometry, was 6.5 ± 0.8-fold lower for the prS100B-3 promoter sequence than for the GADD45 DNA. This may be due to the fact that two of the A/T variants in the consensus sequence are A in the GADD45 sequence, which is preferred, but are T in the prS100B-3 sequence (Fig. 4). Another difference between these p53 binding sites is the length of the intervening DNA sequence that links the two 10-nucleotide stretches of DNA that interact with p53 (11 nt in prS100B-3 versus 0 nt in GADD45; Fig. 4). Similar data were obtained with the two other p53 consensus sites in the S100B promoter (nt 149–169, prS100B-1; nt 1455–1478, prS100B-2); however, these sites had lower affinity for p53 than did the 20/20 sequence, prS100B-3 (data not shown). Together, these data suggest that the regulation of S100B transcription by p53 would occur only after genes with higher affinity p53 sites in their promoters are occupied. Transcription Is Activated When p53 Binds Regions of the S100B Promoter—The full-length S100B promoter contains seven p53 binding sites (nt 1–3080; prS100B-1 to prS100B-7).2 Three shorter constructs containing only six sites (nt 1435–3080; prS100B-2 to prS100B-7), five sites (nt 1679–3080; prS100B-3 to prS100B-7), or four consensus p53 binding sites (nt 1744–3080; prS100B-4 to prS100B-7), respectively, were also cloned into a CAT reporter gene construct to determine whether p53 affects S100B transcription. Transient transfections performed in the p53 null cells H1299 (p53-/-) indicated that each S100B promoter construct was activated in a p53-dependent manner (Fig. 5; lanes 8–11). Likewise, it was found that endogenous wild-type p53 in RKO cells (34Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. el-Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2930) Google Scholar) (p53+/+) could also activate the S100B promoter constructs and that UV treatment amplified this transcription activation activity as found with other genes activated by p53 (Fig. 6). However, it is likely that negative regulatory elements exist in the S100B promoter that affect the p53-dependent transcription activation of S100B, because cutting the S100B promoter back to make smaller constructs was found to increase the amount of p53-dependent transcription activation in both cell lines (Figs. 5 and 6). These results are not too surprising, however, because previous studies of the S100B promoter indicate that the overall regulation of this S100 gene is complex, often cell-type specific, and involves multiple positive and negatively regulatory elements (25Castets F. Griffin W.S. Marks A. Van Eldik L.J. Brain Res. 1997; 46: 208-216Google Scholar).Fig. 6Transcription activation of the S100B promoter by endogenous wild-type tumor suppressor protein p53 (in RKO cells) without or with UV treatment.A, Western blots of p53 and S100B in the human colorectal carcinoma cell line RKO before and after UV treatment. Actin was used as loading control. B, lanes 1–7, controls that are not treated with UV radiation include the following: RKO cell without any transfected construct (lane 1); control in the absence of the S100B promoter construct (lane 2); transcription activation by endogenous p53 as measured by CAT activity for the full-length S100B promoter, S100B 7p53, that includes all seven p53 binding sites (nt 1–3080; prS100B-1 to prS100B-7) (lane 3); p53 transcription activation of a promoter construct of S100B with six of the p53 binding sites, S100B 6p53 (nt 1435–3080; prS100B-2 to prS100B-7) (lane 4); p53 transcription activation of a promoter construct from S100B that has five p53-binding sites (nt 1679–3080; prS100B-3 to prS100–7) (lane 5); p53 transcription activation by an S100B promoter construct (nt 1744–3080; prS100B-4 to prS100B-7) containing four of the seven consensus p53 binding sites (lane 6); and positive control showing the p53 transcription activation of a well characterized p53-regulated gene, GADD45 (lane 7). Lanes 8–14 are the same as those in lanes 1–7, except that UV treatment was also applied as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The S100B CAT assays were performed with 25 μg of cell extract, whereas the GADD45 assay was performed with 2.5 μg of cell extract. C, bar graph of the relative CAT activity for each construct (lanes 1–14) from panel A. The bars labeled with the numbers 17.3 and 40.4 (lanes 7 and 14) are off-scale and have CAT activities of 17.3 ± 1.1 and 40.4 ± 2.1 relative percentage conversions, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As with the band shift assay (Fig. 4), it was found that a reporter gene construct containing p53 binding sites from the GADD45 gene sequence was more efficiently activated than the S100B promoter. Even when 10 times less protein extract was used, the CAT activity generated by the GADD45 reporter gene construct was higher than the levels obtained with the highest S100B activity (Fig. 6). Taken together, the DNA-binding and transcription activation activity assays are consistent and suggest that p53 can only activate the transcription of the S100B gene when the tumor suppressor protein levels are relatively high (as compared with the p53 levels needed to activate other genes such as GADD45). In its active form, each subunit of tetrameric p53 binds Zn2+ and contains a sandwich of two antiparallel β-sheets that serve as a scaffold for a loop-sheet-helix DNA binding domain (35Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2150) Google Scholar). When cells are under stress (i.e. UV radiation, DNA damage, etc.), elevated levels of p53 bind specific DNA sequences and activate the transcription of downstream targets, including a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (p21WAF/CIP1), cell cycle control proteins (cyclin G, GADD45), genes involved in apoptosis (i.e. Bcl2), and, eventually, proteins such as S100B and hdm2, which, in turn, negatively regulate p53 protein levels inside the cell via feedback control (1Levine A.J.

In Fig. 7, a scheme is presented for how p53 is down-regulated by hdm2 and S100B as a part of feedback control to ensure that p53 levels do not get elevated to excessive levels. For S100B, the affinity of p53 for its promoter regions are relatively low (Figs. 4, 5, 6), which suggests that regulation of S100B by p53 would occur only after higher affinity promoter sites are occupied (i.e. for GADD45). This idea is further supported by p53 transcription activation assays performed with shorter constructs of the S100B promoter (Figs. 5 and 6), which indicates that additional negative regulatory elements exist in the full-length promoter that reduce p53-dependent transcription activation of the S100B gene. Specifically, at the levels of the p53 protein necessary to activate the transcription of S100B, numerous other genes (i.e. GADD45, p21, etc.) will have already been transcribed. This, of course, is a scenario that one might expect for the regulation of a gene such as S100B, which is involved in a feedback loop that ultimately leads to lowering the levels of functional p53. Interestingly, p53 is also known to up-regulate the transcription of another S100 protein, S100A2 (36Tan M. Heizmann C.W. Guan K. Schafer B.W. Sun Y. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) by binding the p53-binding consensus sequences found in its promoter. 3A region of the S100A2 promoter (-2146 to -2126; GenBank™ accession number Y07755) nearly matches the p53-binding consensus sequence (18/20), binds p53, and activates p53-dependent transcription of a reporter gene (36Tan M. Heizmann C.W. Guan K. Schafer B.W. Sun Y. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Other S100 proteins that have DNA sequences in their promoters that nearly match the consensus p53-binding sequence(s) include the following: S100A1 (15/20, -1011 to -984; GenBank™ accession number U26356), S100A4 (15/20 × 3, -129 to -107, -453 to -426, and -680 to -658; 16/20, -145 to -119; 17/20, -1466 to -1437; GenBank™ accession number U94663), and S100A9 (16/20, -2488 to -2456; 17/20, 327 to 322; 18/20 × 3, -204 to -178, -1092 to -1068, and -3171 to -3150; GenBank™ accession number AJ250496). S100A7 (GenBank™ accession number AF050167) does not have a DNA sequence in its promoter that closely matches the p53-binding consensus sequence, and the promoters for other S100 protein family members are not yet available in the GenBank™ nucleotide sequence database. Furthermore, several other S100 proteins (i.e. S100A1, S100A4, and S100A9) have consensus p53 binding sequences in their respective promoters, 3A region of the S100A2 promoter (-2146 to -2126; GenBank™ accession number Y07755) nearly matches the p53-binding consensus sequence (18/20), binds p53, and activates p53-dependent transcription of a reporter gene (36Tan M.

S100A7 (GenBank™ accession number AF050167) does not have a DNA sequence in its promoter that closely matches the p53-binding consensus sequence, and the promoters for other S100 protein family members are not yet available in the GenBank™ nucleotide sequence database. so it is likely that several other S100 proteins are also regulated by p53. However, more work needs to be done before general conclusions can be made about the functional significance of regulatory pathways involving p53 and other S100 family members. The lowering of p53 protein levels inside cells by S100B that was observed here (Fig. 2) and previously (23Lin J. Blake M. Tang C. Zimmer D. Rustandi R.R. Weber D.J. Carrier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35037-35041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) is most likely related to the ability of S100B to bind directly to p53 (Fig. 3), dissociate the p53 tetramer (29Baudier J. Delphin C. Grunwald D. Khochbin S. Lawrence J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11627-11631Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and/or cause conformational changes in the extreme C terminus and tetramerization domains of the tumor suppressor (30Rustandi R.R. Baldisseri D.M. Drohat A.C. Weber D.J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1743-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Such effects by S100B may work synergistically with the hdm2 protein/pathways, which are involved in the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53 (37Ashcroft M. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7637-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), although this concept needs to be rigorously established. Nonetheless, an important distinction between these two negative regulatory proteins (hdm2 versus S100B) is that the S100B interaction with the C terminus of p53 is Ca2+-dependent (21Rustandi R.R. Drohat A.C. Baldisseri D.M. Wilder P.T. Weber D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1951-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and links p53 biology to calcium-mediated signaling pathways and extracellular growth responses, whereas, hdm2 binds the N terminus of p53 in a calcium-independent manner and is regulated by other proteins (i.e. p14ARF)/signaling pathways and the phosphorylation state of p53 (33Momand J. Wu H.H. Dasgupta G. Gene. 2000; 242: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 37Ashcroft M. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7637-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 38Prives C. Cell. 1998; 95: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). It is important to understand how cancer cells, such as those in malignant melanoma, can proliferate even though they have wild-type p53. One possible explanation for this paradigm is that elevated levels of the proteins that negatively regulate p53, such as S100B, may be a culprit. Specifically, the overall effect of elevated S100B levels on wild-type p53 could mimic cellular aberrations such as gene amplification and mutations that are encountered with non-functional mutants of p53. Specifically, several melanomas have wild-type p53 and higher than normal levels of S100B, and the prognosis for patients such as these is generally poorer than for those with lower S100B levels (39Cochran A.J. Lu H.F. Li P.X. Saxton R. Wen D.R. Melanoma Res. 1993; 3: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 40Boni R. Heizman C.W. Doguoglu A. Ilg E.C. Schafer B.W. Dummer R. Burg G. J. Cutan.

Cell Res. 1990; 187: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For primary skin cancer cells, we show that there is a direct interaction between p53 and S100B and that functional wild-type p53 levels can be restored when S100B levels are lowered by siRNA (Fig. 2). This result directly implicates S100B in the down-regulation of wild-type p53 and is consistent with the large decreases in p53 protein levels observed previously in transient co-transfections of p53 and S100B (23Lin J. Blake M. Tang C. Zimmer D. Rustandi R.R. Weber D.J. Carrier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35037-35041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). With these results in mind, perhaps a small molecule inhibitor that binds S100B, blocks the S100B-p53 interaction, and restores wild-type p53 levels (i.e. an siRNAS100B mimic) could be useful in therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancers with elevated S100B, such as some forms of malignant melanoma and glioma."
https://openalex.org/W1965716030,"In normal β-cells glucose induces insulin secretion by activating both a triggering pathway (closure of KATP channels, depolarization, and rise in cytosolic [Ca2+]i) and an amplifying pathway (augmentation of Ca2+ efficacy on exocytosis). It is unclear if and how nutrients can regulate insulin secretion by β-cells lacking KATP channels (Sur1 knockout mice). We compared glucose- and amino acid-induced insulin secretion and [Ca2+]i changes in control and Sur1KO islets. In 1 mm glucose (non-stimulatory for controls), the triggering signal [Ca2+]i was high (loss of regulation) and insulin secretion was stimulated in Sur1KO islets. This “basal” secretion was decreased or increased by imposed changes in [Ca2+]i and was dependent on ATP production, indicating that both triggering and amplifying signals are involved. High glucose stimulated insulin secretion in Sur1KO islets, by an unsuspected, transient increase in [Ca2+]i and a sustained activation of the amplifying pathway. Unlike controls, Sur1KO islets were insensitive to diazoxide and tolbutamide, which rules out effects of either drug at sites other than KATP channels. Amino acids potently increased insulin secretion by Sur1KO islets through both a further electrogenic rise in [Ca2+]i and a metabolism-dependent activation of the amplifying pathway. After sulfonylurea blockade of their KATP channels, control islets qualitatively behaved like Sur1KO islets, but their insulin secretion rate was consistently lower for a similar or even higher [Ca2+]i. In conclusion, fuel secretagogues can control insulin secretion in β-cells without KATP channels, partly by an unsuspected influence on the triggering [Ca2+]i signal and mainly by the modulation of a very effective amplifying pathway.

Because insulin is the only blood glucose-lowering hormone, tight control of its secretion by pancreatic β-cells is critical. Glucose exerts this control through two major signaling pathways leading to the production of triggering and amplifying signals respectively (1Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1751-1760Google Scholar). ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) 1The abbreviations used are: KATP, ATP-sensitive K+; SUR1, sulfonylurea receptor 1; Sur1KO, Sur1 knockout mice; KIR, potassium inward rectifier channel; [Ca2+]i, cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration; BCH, 2-amino-2-norbornanecarboxylic acid. channels are key players in the triggering pathway. They are composed of the high affinity sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) and the poreforming KIR6.2 (2Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocrine Rev. 1999; 20: 101-135Google Scholar, 3Seino S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 337-362Google Scholar) and serve to transduce metabolic changes into biophysical signals through the following sequence of events. The metabolism of glucose by oxidative glycolysis produces a rise in the ATP/ADP ratio in β-cells, which closes KATP channels in the plasma membrane, thereby causing depolarization with subsequent opening of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, Ca2+ influx from the extracellular medium, and rise in the concentration of cytoplasmic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) (1Henquin J.C.

This rise in [Ca2+]i is the triggering signal for exocytosis of insulin granules. Alone, this triggering signal is poorly effective, but amplifying signals, also issued from glucose metabolism, augment its efficacy (1Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1751-1760Google Scholar, 10Aizawa T. Sato Y. Komatsu M. Diabetes. 2002; 51: S96-S98Google Scholar). The experimental paradigms used to study the amplifying pathway require clamping of [Ca2+]i at an elevated level, which is achieved by depolarizing β-cells either with a sulfonylurea that holds KATP channels closed, or by high KCl in the presence of diazoxide that holds KATP channels open (1Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1751-1760Google Scholar). Because glucose no longer can modulate KATP channel activity, hence the membrane potential, the amplifying pathway has also been referred to as a KATP channel-independent effect of glucose (8Straub S.G. Sharp G.W. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2002; 18: 451-463Google Scholar, 10Aizawa T. Sato Y. Komatsu M. Diabetes. 2002; 51: S96-S98Google Scholar). The nature of the metabolic messengers involved in this pathway is still debated (8Straub S.G. Sharp G.W. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2002; 18: 451-463Google Scholar, 11Sato Y. Henquin J.C.

A. 1999; 96: 760-765Google Scholar), but the intracellular targets of these putative messengers remain to be identified. SUR1 belongs to the family of the ATP-binding cassette proteins and possesses classic nucleotide binding folds (21Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement J.P. Boyd A.E. Gonzalez G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Google Scholar). Besides its localization in KATP channels of the plasma membrane, it is present in large amounts in intracellular membranes (22Ozanne S.E. Guest P.C. Hutton J.C. Hales C.N. Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 277-282Google Scholar, 23Minami K. Yokokura M. Ishizuka N. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25277-25282Google Scholar, 24Geng X. Li L. Watkins S. Robbins P.D. Drain P. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 767-776Google Scholar), possibly forming KATP channels in the insulin granule membrane (24Geng X. Li L. Watkins S. Robbins P.D. Drain P. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 767-776Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that intracellular SUR1/KATP channels might be implicated in the amplifying pathway of insulin secretion, whereas SUR1/KATP channels in the plasma membrane are implicated in the triggering pathway. Two SUR1 knock-out (Sur1KO) mice have been produced, which show no gross abnormalities of glucose homeostasis despite the absence of KATP channels in their β-cells and poor secretion of insulin in response to hyperglycemia (25Seghers V. Nakazaki M. Demayo F. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9270-9277Google Scholar, 26Shiota C. Larsson O. Shelton K.D. Shiota M. Efanov A.M. Hoy M. Lindner J. Kooptiwut S. Junti-Berggren L. Gromada J. Berggren P.O. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37176-37183Google Scholar). In one model, glucose alone was found to exert only minor effects on insulin secretion from isolated islets, except when the period of stimulation was long (25Seghers V. Nakazaki M. Demayo F. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9270-9277Google Scholar) or after pretreatment with agents raising cAMP (27Nakazaki M. Crane A. Hu M. Seghers V. Ullrich S. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3440-3449Google Scholar). In the other model, glucose was also virtually ineffective on in vitro insulin secretion unless protein kinase A or C pathways were activated (26Shiota C. Larsson O. Shelton K.D. Shiota M. Efanov A.M. Hoy M. Lindner J. Kooptiwut S. Junti-Berggren L. Gromada J. Berggren P.O. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37176-37183Google Scholar, 28Doliba N.M. Qin W. Vatamaniuk M.Z. Li C.

These observations prompted the conclusion that the amplifying pathway is defective in β-cells lacking SUR1 (28Doliba N.M. Qin W. Vatamaniuk M.Z. Li C. Zelent D. Najafi H. Buettger C.W. Collins H.W. Carr R.D. Magnuson M.A. Matschinsky F.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: E834-E843Google Scholar). In the present study we compared islets from Sur1KO mice (25Seghers V. Nakazaki M. Demayo F. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9270-9277Google Scholar) and their wild-type controls, with the specific aim of assessing whether the absence of SUR1 (hence also of KATP channels) causes intrinsic defects in the amplifying pathway of glucose or amino acid-induced insulin secretion. The experiments were thus performed under classic conditions, but also under those conditions permitting dissociation of triggering and amplifying pathways in control β-cells, in particular after blockade of their KATP channels by a sulfonylurea. Because, by definition, the amplifying pathway involves changes in Ca2+ action, not in [Ca2+]i, the stability of the latter was consistently verified to obviate pitfalls of KATP channel-independent changes in the triggering signal (1Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1751-1760Google Scholar). Our results indicate that both glucose and amino acids are effective stimulators of insulin secretion in the absence of SUR1, and that their effects involve, in variable proportions, a KATP channel-independent increase in [Ca2+]i and an activation of the amplifying pathway. Animals—The generation and characteristics of Sur1KO mice have been described previously (25Seghers V. Nakazaki M. Demayo F. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9270-9277Google Scholar). Adult animals, all females, were sent from Houston to Brussels where they were used at an age of 10–14 months, i.e. older than the males used in previous studies with this model (25Seghers V. Nakazaki M. Demayo F. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9270-9277Google Scholar, 27Nakazaki M. Crane A. Hu M. Seghers V. Ullrich S. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3440-3449Google Scholar). Controls were C57Bl/6 mice obtained from Charles River Laboratories, Brussels, and housed with test mice for use at a similar age. Only females were used for measurements of insulin secretion, whereas both males and females were used for measurements of islet [Ca2+]i. The Sur1KO mice used in the present study were slightly heavier than their female controls (29.7 ± 0.52 g, n = 32 versus 27.0 ± 0.55 g, n = 32, p < 0.001). There was no difference in morning blood glucose between the two groups, but the variability was greater in Sur1KO (106 ± 6 mg/dl, range 57–192) than in controls (100 ± 3 mg/dl, range 74–139). Solutions and Reagents—The control medium was a bicarbonate-buffered solution containing (mm): NaCl, 120; KCl, 4.8; CaCl2, 2.5; MgCl2, 1.2; and NaHCO3, 24. It was maintained under O2/CO2 (94:6) to a pH of 7.4, and it contained 10 mm glucose and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. A similar solution was used as test medium after adjustment of the glucose concentration and addition of the studied substances. When the concentration of KCl was increased to 30 mm, that of NaCl was decreased accordingly; otherwise the substances were added without osmotic compensation. Ca2+-free solutions were prepared by substitution of CaCl2 with MgCl2 and addition of 200 μm EGTA. Diazoxide was a gift of Schering-Plough Avondale (Rathdrum, Ireland), glutamine was from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), and albumin (fraction V) was from Roche Applied Science, Belgium. Other reagents were from Sigma or from Merck AG (Darmstadt, Germany). Preparations—Islets from Sur1KO or control mice were aseptically isolated by collagenase digestion of the pancreas followed by hand selection (29Jonas J.C. Gilon P. Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1266-1273Google Scholar). The islets were then cultured for about 18 h in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, Belgium) containing 10 mm glucose, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Measurements of Insulin Secretion and Islet Insulin Content—Overnight cultured islets were distributed in batches of 15–40, at room temperature, in control medium containing 1 mm glucose. The number of islets per batch depended on the substance tested in the subsequent experiment. Each batch of islets was then transferred into the chamber of a dynamic perifusion system (30Henquin J.C. Nature. 1978; 271: 271-273Google Scholar). The islets were then perifused at 37 °C with test solutions described in the figure legends. The effluent fractions were collected at 2-min intervals and saved for insulin assay, using rat insulin as a standard and ethanol to precipitate bound insulin (31Heding L.G. Diabetologia. 1972; 8: 260-266Google Scholar). At the end of the experiment, the perifusion was stopped, the chambers were opened, and the islets were recovered and counted before being transferred into Eppendorf tubes. After brief centrifugation, the transfer medium was removed and replaced by 500 μl of an acid ethanol mixture for insulin extraction (32Detimary P. Jonas J.C. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1738-1745Google Scholar). Fractional insulin secretion rate was then calculated as the percentage of islet insulin content that was secreted per minute. By summing total insulin secreted during the experiment and the final insulin content, the insulin content of the islet at the beginning of the perifusions was obtained. It averaged 115.7 ± 2.6 ng/islet (n = 78) for controls and 99.8 ± 2.8 ng/islet (n = 66) for Sur1KO (p < 0.01). This difference is smaller than the 40% reported previously for islets from younger male mice of the same origin (27Nakazaki M. Crane A. Hu M. Seghers V. Ullrich S. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3440-3449Google Scholar). Measurements of Islet [Ca2+]i—Overnight cultured islets were loaded with the Ca2+ indicator fura-PE3 (2 μm, 2 h) in control medium containing 10 mm glucose. Loaded islets were then transferred (three or four at a time) into the perifusion chamber of a spectrofluorimetric system, equipped with a camera, and with which [Ca2+]i was measured as described previously (33Gilon P. Henquin J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20713-20720Google Scholar). Because of technical constraints, the [Ca2+]i experiments are shorter than insulin secretion experiments. Presentation of Results—All experiments have been performed with islets from four to seven different preparations. Except for a few representative recordings of [Ca2+]i in individual islets, results are presented as means ± S.E. The statistical significance of differences between Sur1KO and control islets was assessed by unpaired Student's t test. Effects of Glucose on Insulin Secretion and Islet [Ca2+]i— When the perifusion medium contained a non-stimulatory concentration of glucose (1 mm), the rate of insulin secretion by control islets was very low and stable (Fig. 1). Increasing the glucose concentration to 15 mm induced a biphasic secretion of insulin, which was completely reversible upon return to the low glucose medium. In contrast, Sur1KO islets already secreted large amounts of insulin in the presence of 1 mm glucose. This high rate of secretion, that was unaffected by 3 mm glucose (not shown), progressively declined with time, but remained higher than in control islets even after 3 h of perifusion in 1 mm glucose (Fig. 1). Stimulation of Sur1KO islets with 15 mm glucose consistently caused an early but transient decrease in insulin secretion followed by an almost 3-fold, monophasic increase above the initial rate. Although this high rate of secretion started to decrease after about 50 min (min 90 of the experiment), the stimulatory effect of glucose remained evident for at least 100 min. Lowering the glucose concentration to 1 mm only partially inhibited insulin secretion. Within 15 min, the secretion rate returned to similar values as those before the stimulation but that remained substantially higher than those in Sur1KO islets maintained in 1 mm glucose from the start (Fig. 1). Because insulin secretion by Sur1KO islets was already high in 1 mm glucose, the relative stimulation by 15 mm glucose was much smaller than in control islets, but the absolute increase over baseline was similar in the two groups: 5.9 ± 0.7% per 100 min in controls and 6.2 ± 0.8% per 100 min in Sur1KO. During long experiments, apparent islet [Ca2+]i slowly but steadily increases with time (34Sato Y. Anello M. Henquin J.C. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2252-2257Google Scholar). This increase in control islets continuously perifused with 1 mm glucose can be seen in Fig. 2A. When these control islets were stimulated by 15 mm glucose, a small decrease in [Ca2+]i first occurred, followed by a marked and sustained increase for a few minutes, and eventually appearance of large oscillations (33Gilon P. Henquin J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20713-20720Google Scholar, 35Santos R.M. Rosario L.M. Nadal A. Garcia-Sancho J. Soria B. Valdeolmillos M. Pflügers Arch. 1991; 418: 417-422Google Scholar, 36Roe M.W. Mertz R.J. Lancaster M.E. Worley J.F. Dukes I.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E852-E862Google Scholar). These oscillations are shown in a representative experiment (Fig. 2C) but, because of their asynchrony between islets, are masked by averaging (Fig. 2A). The stimulatory effect of glucose on [Ca2+]i in control islets was rapidly and completely reversible upon return to a medium containing 1 mm glucose. In Sur1KO islets, [Ca2+]i was high already in the presence of 1mm glucose (Fig. 2A) and it was not affected by an increase in the glucose concentration to 3 mm (not shown). When the results obtained in 28 islets maintained in 1 mm glucose for about 60 min were averaged (Fig. 2B), a time-dependent increase by 1.7 nm per min was measured, which must be taken into account to evaluate the true effects of glucose. Stimulation of Sur1KO islets with 15 mm glucose initially caused a marked decrease in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2D), that was so consistent in time not to be distorted by averaging (Fig. 2, A and B). Thereafter, [Ca2+]i increased above control values (islets maintained in 1 mm glucose) (Fig. 2B). During the period 30–40 min, average [Ca2+]i was significantly (p < 0.001) higher in Sur1KO islets stimulated by 15 mm glucose (200 ± 7nm, n = 18) than in islets maintained in 1 mm glucose (169 ± 4 nm, n = 28), although average [Ca2+]i was similar in the two groups during the prestimulatory period (15–25 min). This rebound after the initial drop was, however, transient (Fig. 2, A and B); during steady-state stimulation, average [Ca2+]i was again similar in 15 mm glucose (211 ± 7 nm) and in 1 mm glucose (204 ± 5 nm). When, at the end of the experiments, the glucose concentration was lowered from 15 to 1 mm, [Ca2+]i remained high in these Sur1KO islets (Fig. 2, A and D). The difference in average [Ca2+]i between stimulated and unstimulated Sur1KO islets usually disappeared after 15 min of glucose application, when [Ca2+]i oscillations appeared (Fig. 2D). It was not our purpose to identify the mechanisms underlying the [Ca2+]i oscillations that Sur1KO islets displayed both in 1 mm glucose (Fig. 2E) and in 15 mm glucose (Fig. 2F) nor to investigate the reasons for their variable pattern and generally higher frequency in high glucose (Fig. 2, E and F). However, it is noteworthy that an oscillatory electrical activity is present in Sur1KO islets perifused with low glucose (37Düfer M. Haspel D. Krippeit-Drews P. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Drews G. Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 488-498Google Scholar, 38Ammala C. Dukes I.D. Gengo P. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Seghers V.J. Nakazaki M. Diabetes. 2000; 49 (abstract): A62Google Scholar) and that these oscillations become shorter and faster in high glucose (37Düfer M. Haspel D. Krippeit-Drews P. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Drews G. Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 488-498Google Scholar). These similarities with the [Ca2+]i oscillations that we measured strongly suggest that [Ca2+]i oscillations are controlled by the membrane potential in Sur1KO as in normal β-cells. Whatever the mechanisms of the oscillations, the most important findings in the context of the present study are that [Ca2+]i and insulin secretion in Sur1KO islets are both elevated in low glucose and that high glucose markedly increases insulin secretion without further increasing [Ca2+]i, except during the transient (∼15 min) rebound following the initial decrease. Mechanisms of Insulin Secretion by Sur1KO Islets in the Presence of 1 mm Glucose—In this series of experiments we assessed whether the high rate of insulin secretion by Sur1KO islets in 1 mm glucose can simply be ascribed to the elevation of the triggering signal [Ca2+]i. Control islets were studied in a usual medium or after blockade of KATP channels by a high concentration of tolbutamide (500 μm). Fig. 3 (A and B) shows again that, in the presence of 1 mm glucose, [Ca2+]i was higher and insulin secretion markedly increased in Sur1KO islets as compared with control islets. [Ca2+]i was even higher in control islets perifused with 1 mm glucose and 500 μm tolbutamide, but insulin secretion was surprisingly less than in Sur1KO islets. Despite the major differences in initial [Ca2+], omission of extracellular Ca2+i was followed by a decrease in [Ca2+]i to a similar level in the three groups of islets (Fig. 3A). Simultaneously, basal insulin secretion from control islets marginally, but consistently, increased, whereas the high rates of secretion in Sur1KO and control plus tolbutamide islets decreased, to reach the same rate of secretion as that of control islets (Fig. 3B). All these changes in [Ca2+]i and insulin secretion were entirely reversible upon reintroduction of CaCl2 into the medium. To evaluate the role of energy for insulin secretion by Sur1KO islets in 1 mm glucose, azide, a mitochondrial poison, was added to the perifusion medium. In both control and Sur1KO islets, azide caused an increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3C), which we ascribe to arrest of Ca2+ pumping into and release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Basal insulin secretion from control islets was unaffected, but the high secretion rate from Sur1KO islets was progressively inhibited (Fig. 3D). Removal of azide was followed by a decrease in [Ca2+]i. In Sur1KO islets this decrease was marked and of variable duration, which gives a peculiar, progressive, stepwise pattern to the recovery after averaging (Fig. 3C). Insulin secretion recovered partially but, for unknown reasons, slightly more rapidly than [Ca2+]i. This inhibition of insulin secretion in low glucose is not specific to azide. Thus, inhibition of mitochondrial metabolism by 10 μm FCCP, 5 μm oligomycin, 10 μm rotenone, or simply lowering the temperature to 22 °C also suppressed (90% or more) insulin secretion by Sur1KO islets incubated in 1 mm glucose. These experiments establish that the high rate of insulin secretion by Sur1KO islets in low glucose results from a continuous, unregulated, influx of Ca2+, secondary to the lack of functional KATP channels, and a metabolic regulation of the effectiveness of Ca2+. Sur1KO Islets Are Insensitive to Diazoxide and Tolbutamide—In control islets, [Ca2+]i was high during stimulation by 15 mm glucose (Fig. 4A). Addition of 100 μm diazoxide, to open KATP channels, rapidly lowered [Ca2+]i, an effect that was completely and reversibly counteracted by 100 μm tolbutamide. These changes in [Ca2+]i were paralleled by changes in insulin secretion. Addition of diazoxide during sustained stimulation with glucose virtually abrogated insulin secretion, which was reversibly restored by addition of tolbutamide on top of diazoxide (Fig. 4B). The behavior of Sur1KO islets was strikingly different. Their [Ca2+]i in the presence of 15 mm glucose alone was similar to that in control islets (Fig. 4A), but the insulin secretion rate was again higher (Fig. 4B). Neither diazoxide alone nor its subsequent combination with tolbutamide affected [Ca2+]i or insulin secretion. Note that the apparent, paradoxical, decrease in insulin secretion occurring in the presence of tolbutamide around 100 min of the experiments (Fig. 4B) coincides with the onset of a spontaneous decrease in the effect of glucose alone (Fig. 1). Insulin secretion was also measured in the presence of 1 μm forskolin, which is known to increase the cAMP content of mouse islets ∼10-fold (39Henquin J.C. Meissner H.P. Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 1125-1134Google Scholar). In control islets forskolin was without effect on basal insulin secretion, but it potentiated the response to 15 mm glucose 4- to 5-fold and did not alter the inhibitory effect of diazoxide and its reversal by tolbutamide (Fig. 4C). In Sur1KO islets, forskolin increased insulin release 4-fold already in the presence of 1 mm glucose. Importantly, the stimulation by 15 mm glucose produced qualitatively and quantitatively similar effects as those in the absence of forskolin: an initial transient decrease and a sustained 2.5-fold amplification. Addition of diazoxide and tolbutamide were again without effect. Under these conditions, the changes in [Ca2+]i were similar to those in the absence of forskolin (data not shown). In a series of four experiments similar to those shown in Fig. 4B, tolbutamide was not withdrawn at 110 min, but 1 μm forskolin was added. This resulted in a potentiation of insulin secretion by 4-fold in control islets and 3.5-fold in Sur1KO islets. These experiments thus establish that Sur1KO islets are insensitive to the normal inhibitory and stimulatory effects of diazoxide and tolbutamide and that the stimulatory effect of glucose on insulin secretion persists in the presence of elevated cAMP levels. Insulin Secretion under Conditions Testing the Amplification Pathway in Control Islets—Two experimental approaches are classically used to study the amplifying pathway of glucose-induced insulin secretion: to hold KATP channels closed by a sulfonylurea or to hold them open by diazoxide and depolarize β-cells with KCl before addition of glucose (1Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1751-1760Google Scholar). In control islets, perifused with 1 mm glucose, 500 μm tolbutamide induced a rapid and sustained increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 5A). Subsequent stimulation with 15 mm glucose caused a rapid, transient decrease in [Ca2+]i followed by a return slightly above initial values (34Sato Y. Anello M. Henquin J.C. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2252-2257Google Scholar), whereas the final switch to 1 mm glucose was accompanied by a small increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 5A). Under similar conditions, tolbutamide induced a rapid increase in insulin secretion followed by a lower, sustained second phase, which was markedly and reversibly increased by the subsequent rise in the glucose concentration (Fig. 5B). No initial drop in insulin secretion is visible after averaging, because the phenomenon was not consistent. In Sur1KO islets, [Ca2+]i was high in 1 mm glucose and unaffected by tolbutamide, whereas 15 mm glucose induced a transient decrease in [Ca2+]i followed by a return slightly above initial values (Fig. 5A). Simultaneously, the high rate"

The neurovirulence of these “spongiogenic retroviruses” is determined by the sequence of their respective envelope proteins, although the mechanisms of neurotoxicity are not understood. We have studied a highly neurovirulent virus called FrCasE that causes a rapidly progressive form of this disease. Recently, transcriptional markers of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress were detected during the early preclinical period in the brains of FrCasE-infected mice. In contrast, ER stress was not observed in mice infected with an avirulent virus, F43, which carries a different envelope gene, suggesting a role for ER stress in disease pathogenesis. Here we have examined in NIH 3T3 cells the cause of this cellular stress response. The envelope protein of F43 bound BiP, a major ER chaperone, transiently and was processed normally through the secretory pathway. In contrast, the envelope protein of FrCasE bound to BiP for a prolonged period, was retained in the ER, and was degraded by the proteasome. Furthermore, engagement of the FrCasE envelope protein by ER quality control pathways resulted in decreased steady-state levels of this protein, relative to that of F43, both in NIH 3T3 cells and in the brains of infected mice. Thus, the ER stress induced by FrCasE appears to be initiated by inefficient folding of its viral envelope protein, suggesting that the neurodegenerative disease caused by this virus represents a protein misfolding disorder.

The neurovirulence of these “spongiogenic retroviruses” is determined by the sequence of their respective envelope genes (1DesGroseillers L. Barrette M. Jolicoeur P. J.

Ball J.K. Wong P.K.Y. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 467-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the molecular interactions of the viral envelope protein and the host that lead to neurodegeneration remain to be elucidated. Previous studies by others (3Szurek P.F. Yuen P.H. Ball J.K. Wong P.K.Y. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 467-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Shikova E. Lin Y.C. Saha K. Brooks B.R. Wong P.K.Y. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention of the envelope protein may play a role in the pathogenic process. Supporting this hypothesis, we demonstrated that a transcriptional profile consistent with an ER stress response is activated in the brains of mice infected with a neuropathogenic virus FrCasE but not in mice infected with a nonpathogenic retrovirus F43 (5Dimcheff D.E. Askovic S. Baker A.H. Johnson-Fowler C. Portis J.L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 12617-12629Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The FrCasE and F43 viruses were constructed by using the same retrovirus genetic background but differ in their envelope genes (6Askovic S. McAtee F.J. Favara C. Portis J.L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). FrCasE contains the envelope gene of CasBrE, a neuropathogenic retrovirus originally isolated from wild mice (7Gardner M.B. Henderson B.E. Officer J.E. Rongey R.W. Parker J.C. Oliver C. Estes J.D. Huebner R.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1973; 51: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), whereas F43 contains the envelope gene of a nonpathogenic virus FMLV 57. Both viruses utilize the same receptor for virus entry, infect the brain at high levels, and target the same cell populations (6Askovic S. McAtee F.J. Favara C. Portis J.L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Most interesting, NIH 3T3 cells infected with FrCasE also exhibit a transcriptional profile consistent with ER stress (5Dimcheff D.E. Askovic S. Baker A.H. Johnson-Fowler C. Portis J.L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 12617-12629Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), suggesting that these cells could be used to further analyze the interactions between the virus and the host cell that initiates this response. ER stress is caused by conditions that perturb ER function including nutrient or energy deprivation, calcium fluxes, and the accumulation of misfolded proteins (8Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar, 9Kaufman R.J. Scheuner D. Schroder M. Shen X. Lee K. Liu C.Y. Arnold S.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). When misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, a stereotypical cellular program to eliminate this stress, called the unfolded protein response (UPR), is activated (8Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). Central to the UPR is the binding of BiP (grp78), an ATP-dependent ER chaperone, to misfolded proteins (10Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar, 11Kaufman R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1389-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 12Shen J. Chen X. Hendershot L. Prywes R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). BiP binds transiently to newly synthesized proteins but more persistently to misfolded proteins. Under nonstressed conditions, BiP binds to three ER resident transmembrane proteins called “sensors of ER stress,” which negatively regulates the UPR by keeping these proteins in an inactivated state. When misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, BiP binds instead to the misfolded proteins and allows activation of these UPR sensors, leading to decreased protein synthesis and increased production of ER chaperones (13Rutkowski D.T. Kaufman R.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 20-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). This is followed by activation of ER-associated degradation (ERAD), which shunts misfolded proteins to the proteasome (14Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In this way BiP monitors the folding status of proteins in the ER and regulates the UPR in response to ER stress. Several human neurodegenerative diseases are associated with the accumulation of misfolded host proteins, although the specific role played by misfolded proteins in disease pathogenesis remains elusive. ER stress pathways and the subsequent cellular responses may provide a mechanistic connection between misfolded proteins and disease (11Kaufman R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1389-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). For instance, ER stress can lead to oxidative stress (15Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N.

Shore G.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8608-8618Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The effects of ER stress may participate in the pathogenesis of a number of degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's (18Imai Y. Soda M. Hatakeyama S. Akagi T. Hashikawa T. Nakayama K.I. Takahashi R.

Itoyama Y. Goto K. Kato T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), although the evidence is still circumstantial. Given the importance of misfolded proteins in neurodegenerative diseases, and the possible link between ER stress and retrovirus-induced spongiform neurodegeneration (5Dimcheff D.E. Askovic S. Baker A.H. Johnson-Fowler C. Portis J.L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 12617-12629Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we investigated the virus-host interactions in NIH 3T3 cells that initiate this response. FrCasE not only up-regulated BiP RNA and protein expression in NIH 3T3 cells, but its envelope protein bound a greater amount of BiP for a longer time than the F43 envelope protein. The FrCasE envelope protein was found to be retained in the ER and degraded by the proteasome, whereas that of F43 was processed normally through the secretory pathway. Furthermore, the shunting of viral envelope protein to the degradative pathway resulted in its decreased levels both in NIH 3T3 cells and in the brains of FrCasE-infected mice. These results strongly suggest that binding of misfolded envelope protein to BiP is responsible for the transcriptional activation of the UPR in FrCasE-infected cells. Because signs of ER stress are an early event seen during the preclinical period of the FrCasE-induced neurodegenerative disease, the results presented here support the notion that this represents a virus-induced protein misfolding disease. Cell Culture and Virus Infections—NIH 3T3 cells (ATCC CRL 1658) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum at 37 °Cina5%CO2 humidified incubator. Virus stocks were prepared in Mus dunni cells as described before (22Portis J.L. Czub S. Garon C.F. McAtee F.J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1648-1656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and titers of infectivity of each virus stock were determined on NIH 3T3 cells. Cells were infected, as described previously (22Portis J.L. Czub S. Garon C.F. McAtee F.J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1648-1656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene at a multiplicity of infection of 2–5. This multiplicity of infection was found empirically to result in the expression of viral envelope protein at the cell surface of >95% of the cells in the culture within 24 h of infection. We found no further increase in viral DNA between 24 and 48 h post-infection suggesting that there was no detectable virus spread after the initial infection. The three viruses used in this study were FrCasE (22Portis J.L. Czub S. Garon C.F. McAtee F.J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1648-1656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), F43 (6Askovic S. McAtee F.J. Favara C. Portis J.L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and a new construct FrCasNC, described herein. The FrCasNC construct was generated as described previously (6Askovic S. McAtee F.J. Favara C. Portis J.L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) for the F43 virus, except that NdeI to ClaI sites were used to insert the CasBrE envelope gene into the F43 retrovirus background (Fig. 2). Real Time Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA samples were analyzed using Taqman real time RT-PCR (Applied Biosystems) as described previously (5Dimcheff D.E. Askovic S. Baker A.H. Johnson-Fowler C. Portis J.L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 12617-12629Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The RT-PCRs were performed in triplicate on individual RNA samples, and individual independent infections were repeated in triplicate. Expression values were normalized using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Primer and probe sequences used to amplify BiP, GADD153/CHOP, and virus RNA were reported previously (5Dimcheff D.E. Askovic S. Baker A.H. Johnson-Fowler C. Portis J.L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 12617-12629Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Statistical tests were performed on multiple independent infections using analysis of variance with a Tukey's multiple-comparison post-test and a level of significance of <0.05. Mice, Inoculations and Immunohistochemistry—Inbred Rocky Mountain White mice were bred and raised at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories and were handled according to the policies of the Rocky Mountain Laboratories Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were inoculated with virus stocks prepared in M. dunni cells, as described previously (22Portis J.L. Czub S. Garon C.F. McAtee F.J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1648-1656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or for mock infections with tissue culture medium alone. Mice were inoculated intraperitoneally 24–48 h after birth with 30 μl of virus stocks containing 1.5–3.0 × 105 focus forming units of infectivity. Immunohistochemistry using goat antiserum to viral surface glycoprotein (SU) was performed as described previously (6Askovic S. McAtee F.J. Favara C. Portis J.L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Experiments—NIH 3T3 cells were infected, and 48 h later monolayers were washed 2× with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice for 10 min using the following lysis buffer: 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and apyrase (10 units/ml). BiP interaction with target proteins is ATP-regulated, so we lysed cells in the presence of apyrase, an ATP diphosphohydrolase, to stabilize BiP-envelope interactions following cell lysis. Lysates were centrifuged for 2 min at 6,000 × g to pellet nuclei. Protein quantity was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), and samples were normalized prior to immunoprecipitation. The antibodies, polyclonal rabbit anti-SU (G. Hunsmann, Goettingen, Germany), or mouse monoclonal anti-KDEL (BiP/Grp78 and Grp94) (StressGen) were added to lysates and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads (Pierce) and washed 3× with lysis buffer. Proteins were released from protein A-Sepharose beads by boiling 5 min in 2× sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol and resolved on 10% NuPage® NOVEX Bis-tris gels (Invitrogen). To detect coprecipitated proteins, immunoblot analysis was performed using rabbit anti-SU at a 1:1000 dilution or mouse anti-KDEL at a 1:2000 dilution. A mouse anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma) was used at a 1:5000 dilution to verify BCA protein quantification and demonstrate equal loading of cell extracts. Immunoblots on 10% homogenates of brain stem were performed as described above, except brain stem samples were homogenized in Dounce homogenizers using a lysis buffer containing 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Rabbit anti-SU was used at a 1:1000 dilution and rabbit anti-p30 (capsid protein) (23Czub S. Lynch W.P. Czub M. Portis J.L. Lab. Investig. 1994; 70: 711-723PubMed Google Scholar) at a 1:1000 dilution. Primary antibodies were detected with species-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Bio-Rad) and visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) on autoradiography film (LabScientific Inc.). Metabolic Labeling and Pulse-Chase Experiments—For pulse-labeling experiments, after 48-h infections, cells were washed in warm phosphate-buffered balanced salt, incubated for 30 min in methionine/cysteine-free medium, and then metabolically labeled with 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine for 15 min. Cells were then lysed with buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, and a protease inhibitor mixture and centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used in immunoprecipitations. For experiments investigating BiP binding, 10 units/ml apyrase (Sigma) was added to lysis buffer. For pulse-chase analysis, after the 15-min pulse, the labeling medium was removed, and cells were washed and chased with complete medium supplemented with 2 mm methionine/cysteine at 37 °C for various times and then lysed as above. For proteasome inhibitor experiments, cells were incubated in 50 μm MG132 for 2 h prior to methionine/cysteine wash out. During the pulse and chase periods, 50 μm MG132 was included in media. Immunoprecipitations were performed as above except prior to immunoprecipitation cell lysates were normalized to total trichloroacetic acidprecipitable counts. Immunocomplexes were solubilized by boiling for 5 min in 2× SDS sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol. Samples were resolved on 9% SDS-PAGE gels and, after drying, exposed to a phosphor screen (Amersham Biosciences). Bands were quantified using ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences). For BiP-binding pulse-chase experiments, the amount of envelope coimmunoprecipitated was normalized to the amount of BiP at each time point prior to determining the half-lives. Data were fit to a nonlinear regression for one-phase exponential decay, and half-lives (t½) were calculated from the equation for the best fit curves. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown and infected on 12-mm glass coverslips, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, all at room temperature. Cells were stained for 30 min at room temperature with both primary and secondary antibodies. Viral envelope protein was detected with the same rabbit anti-SU protein used for viral protein studies, and calnexin was detected with goat anti-calnexin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The primary rabbit antibody was developed with AlexaFluor 488 chicken anti-rabbit Ig (Molecular Probes), and the primary goat antibody was detected with AlexaFluor 555 donkey anti-goat Ig (Molecular Probes). Both secondary antibodies were highly cross-absorbed to remove interspecies cross-reactive antibodies. Initial studies using conventional fluorescence microscopy (Nikon Microphot SA) were carried out to show that the secondary antibodies were specific for their respective Ig. For colocalization studies, coverslips were also stained with the DNA dye DRAQ-5 to stain nuclei and were examined by using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences UltraView LCI confocal microscope, and 0.2–0.4-μm optical slices were acquired as a Z-series using PerkinElmer Life Sciences Imaging Suite version 5.4. Selected slices were then overlaid using Image-J software version 1.29x (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, www.rsb.info.nih.gov/ij). Flow Cytometric Analysis—Suspensions of live cells were analyzed for cell-surface expression using a FACStar flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) as described previously (24Fujisawa R. McAtee F.J. Wehrly K. Portis J.L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5619-5625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For viral envelope protein, cells were stained with polyclonal rabbit anti-SU antiserum diluted 1:1000 and detected with AlexaFluor 488 anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:2000. For MHC class I and transferrin receptor, cells were stained with mouse monoclonal antibodies 30.5.7S (ATCC) and TIB-219 (ATCC), respectively, and detected with AlexaFluor 488 anti-mouse Ig. For quantification of total protein, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline prior to adding primary antibodies. Controls for specificity were performed by staining infected and uninfected cells with secondary antibody alone. Dead cells were gated out with propidium iodide, and a total of 10,000 live cells were analyzed. ER Stress Is Influenced by the Quality of CasBrE Envelope Protein—FrCasE induces the up-regulation of several markers of ER stress in the brain (5Dimcheff D.E. Askovic S. Baker A.H. Johnson-Fowler C. Portis J.L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 12617-12629Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), including BiP, an ER chaperone, and CHOP, a bZip transcription factor. We quantified these two transcripts in NIH 3T3 cells 48 h after infection, using real time RT-PCR. As reported previously (5Dimcheff D.E. Askovic S. Baker A.H. Johnson-Fowler C. Portis J.L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 12617-12629Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), both genes were up-regulated 2–3-fold by FrCasE but not F43 (Fig. 1A). However, the difference in the BiP and CHOP responses paralleled a difference in viral RNA load, which was found to be 2–3-fold higher in FrCasE compared with F43 infection (Fig. 1A). This suggested that the ER stress might simply be a consequence of ER overload. To address this issue directly, we utilized another viral construct, FrCasNC, in which 216 nucleotides in the 3′ polymerase gene of FrCasE (between SphI and NdeI) were replaced with sequences from F43 (Fig. 2A). Both viruses contain the envelope gene of CasBrE, which determines neurovirulence in this system. Indeed, the tempo of the neurologic disease induced by FrCasNC and FrCasE was indistinguishable (Fig. 2B), and both viruses induced comparable spongiform neuropathology (Fig. 2C). However, unlike FrCasE, the viral RNA load in FrCasNC-infected NIH 3T3 cells was comparable with that of F43 (Fig. 1B). Both BiP and CHOP were up-regulated by FrCasNC, and the magnitude of the effect was similar to that induced by FrCasE (Fig. 1B). Nevertheless, we monitored newly synthesized envelope protein to further establish that the ER load in FrCasNC and F43 infected cells was comparable (Fig. 1C). Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were pulsed for 15 min with [35S]methionine/cysteine, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antiserum specific for viral surface glycoprotein (SU). After a 15-min pulse, the only radiolabeled protein detected by this antiserum was the envelope precursor polyprotein pr85env. The CasBrE envelope protein encoded by FrCasE and FrCasNC is slightly smaller than that of F43 because it contains one less glycosylation site and has two deletions of 4 and 7 amino acid residues. As expected, newly synthesized pr85env was 2-fold higher in FrCasE than F43-infected cells, and consistent with the viral RNA levels, the amount of FrCasNC was comparable with that of F43 (Fig. 1C). These results suggested that an intrinsic quality of the CasBrE envelope protein, present in both FrCasE and FrCasNC, was sufficient to induce the ER stress response. The CasBrE Envelope Protein Is Retained in the ER—The envelope precursor polyprotein of these viruses (pr85env), which is synthesized in the ER, is cleaved by a cellular protease in the Golgi, generating the surface glycoprotein (SU, ∼70 kDa) and the transmembrane fusion protein (∼15 kDa) (25Swanstrom R. Wills J.W. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 263-334Google Scholar). We previously showed by immunoblot analysis that the ratio of pr85env to SU protein in cell lysates at steady-state was greater for FrCasE than F43, suggesting a delay in exit of the protein from the ER (5Dimcheff D.E. Askovic S. Baker A.H. Johnson-Fowler C. Portis J.L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 12617-12629Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To further examine this question, we used confocal fluorescence microscopy on fixed and permeabilized cells infected with FrCasE, FrCasNC, and F43 to compare the distribution of envelope protein (Fig. 3). The anti-SU antiserum used to stain viral envelope protein reacts with both the pr85env precursor polyprotein and the SU protein. Although the F43 envelope protein exhibited a largely vesicular staining pattern consistent with staining primarily cleaved, post-ER SU protein, the CasBrE envelope protein of FrCasE and FrCasNC had a reticular pattern that colocalized with the ER marker calnexin. These data suggest that the anti-SU antibody stained predominantly the ER-localized CasBrE pr85env precursor protein. There was very little visible colocalization of F43 envelope protein and calnexin (Fig. 3). These results support the notion that the CasBrE envelope precursor protein is retained in the ER relative to that of F43. We next examined the possible role of BiP in the ER retention of this viral protein. BiP binds to exposed hydrophobic regions and retains client protein in the ER, where it assists in protein folding (26Gething M.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Proteins that do not fold properly remain bound to BiP for prolonged periods. We performed coimmunoprecipitation studies using anti-KDEL (reactive with BiP and grp94) and anti-SU (reactive with pr85env and SU protein). Cell lysates were split, one-half being subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) and the other half being boiled directly in sample buffer (Total Extract). Both samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis (see Fig. 4). Immunoprecipitation with anti-KDEL coprecipitated a protein from the virus-infected cells that was reactive with anti-SU and was consistent in size with the respective pr85env proteins (Fig. 4A, compare IP to Total Extract). In addition, it was clear that the amount of pr85env coimmunoprecipitated from lysates of FrCasE and FrCasNC-infected cells was greater than that from F43-infected cells. Immunoprecipitation with anti-SU (Fig. 4B) resulted in the coprecipitation of a protein reactive with anti-KDEL that had a molecular mass of 78 kDa, consistent with that of BiP (Fig. 4B, compare IP to Total Extract). Most interesting, another KDEL-containing ER chaperone (grp 94) was not coprecipitated with pr85env. Finally, it is apparent from the anti-KDEL immunoblot of total extracts (Fig. 4B) that BiP protein was up-regulated in FrCasE and FrCasNC-infected cells, consistent with the analyses of mRNA levels (Fig. 1) (5Dimcheff D.E. Askovic S. Baker A.H. Johnson-Fowler C. Portis J.L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 12617-12629Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies of BiP binding further suggested the folding instability of the CasBrE envelope protein in the ER. Pulsechase analyses were carried out on FrCasE and F43-infected cells, using anti-KDEL antibodies to coimmunoprecipitate BiP and pr85env (Fig. 5A). The amount of pr85env coimmunoprecipitated at each time point was quantified and normalized to BiP. The ratios of pr85env to BiP at each chase time were then compared with the ratio at time 0 and converted to a percentage of pr85env remaining (Fig. 5B). From these measurements, the half-lives of the BiP-Env interaction were estimated. The binding half-life for FrCasE pr85env to BiP was 2.5 h., whereas that for F43 was 1.0 h. Results were confirmed in another independent experiment examining several time points in the 1st h after the pulse. Taken together with results from the steady-state studies, it appears that the ER retention of the CasBrE envelope protein was a function of its prolonged binding to BiP, implying that this protein folds inefficiently in the ER compared with the F43 envelope protein. FrCasE Envelope Protein Is Subjected to Proteasomal Degradation—Proteins that do not fold properly in the ER are subjected to retrograde transport to the cytosol and degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Thus, after synthesis pr85env exits the ER by vesicular transport to the Golgi for normal proteolytic processing or is"

The protein native state shows conformational heterogeneity attributable to the isomerization of the peptide bond preceding a conserved proline residue. The two equally populated cis and trans forms both adopt an elongated antiparallel three α-helix bundle fold but display major differences in the loop between the first two helices and at the C terminus of helix 3. Proline to alanine single point mutation of the residue Pro-30 prevents the cis/trans isomerization. The structure of the P30A mutant is similar to the structure of the trans form of AHSP in the loop 1 region. Both the wild-type AHSP and the P30A mutant bind to α-hemoglobin, and the wild-type conformational heterogeneity is quenched upon complex formation, suggesting that just one conformation is the active form. Changes in chemical shift observed upon complex formation identify a binding interface comprising the C terminus of helix 1, the loop 1, and the N terminus of helix 2, with the exposed residues Phe-47 and Tyr-51 being attractive targets for molecular recognition.

Manson J. Clinton M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). EDRF was renamed AHSP after it was found that it binds specifically to α-hemoglobin in vitro (2Kihm A.J. Kong Y. Hong W. Russell J.E. Rouda S. Adachi K. Simon M.C. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Nature. 2002; 417: 758-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). AHSP knock-out mice show erythrocyte abnormalities similar to those observed in β-thalassemia (2Kihm A.J. Kong Y. Hong W. Russell J.E. Rouda S. Adachi K. Simon M.C. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Nature. 2002; 417: 758-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), and loss of AHSP aggravates the β-thalassemia phenotype in mice (38Kong Y. Katein A.M. Louden C.S. Weiss M.J. Blood. 2003; 102 (abstr.): 149Google Scholar). β-Thalassemia is characterized by a reduction in the synthesis of β-globin chains. Consequently, the α-chains are in excess, and some of them precipitate, leading to defective red blood cells that determine the pathophysiology of β-thalassemia syndromes. The in vivo and in vitro data therefore both suggest that AHSP acts as a molecular chaperone for free α-hemoglobin (2Kihm A.J. Kong Y. Hong W. Russell J.E. Rouda S. Adachi K. Simon M.C. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Nature. 2002; 417: 758-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 3Luzzatto L. Notaro R. Nature. 2002; 417: 703-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Both AHSP and α-hemoglobin are monomeric in solution and bind each other with an association constant of 1 × 107m-1 forming a complex with a 1:1 stoichiometry (4Gell D. Kong Y. Eaton S.A. Weiss M.J. Mackay J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40602-40609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to structurally characterize the AHSP-α-hemoglobin interaction to understand the molecular basis of the AHSP function and its role as a hemoglobin chaperone. We have demonstrated by NMR that the AHSP native state is conformationally heterogeneous in solution and have identified the dynamic source of this behavior as a cis/trans isomerization of residue Pro-30. The slow time scale of this phenomenon allowed us to determine the high resolution three-dimensional structure of the two conformations of the wild-type AHSP under conditions where both conformations are equally populated. We were able to quench the cis/trans equilibrium by rational site-directed mutagenesis (AHSP P30A), and the three-dimensional structure of the mutant was more similar to the trans conformation of the wild type. We have also shown, using chemical shift mapping, that AHSP binds to α-hemoglobin via an interface mainly located in the region between the first and the second helices. The major differences between the structures of the two forms of AHSP are located at the binding interface of the protein, suggesting that each conformation may have different ligand specificity. DNA Cloning—The DNA sequence for the full-length human AHSP was cloned from a human fetal liver cDNA library (Clontech) using the appropriate 5′- and 3′-end primers, which contained BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites, respectively. The resulting PCR product was ligated into a modified pRSETA vector (Invitrogen) containing a soluble hexahistidine-tagged GroEL fusion protein. AHSP mutants (P30A, M45K, and N75I) were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Protein Expression and Purification—The plasmid was transformed into C41 host cells (5Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar) and grown in 2× TY medium or a modified K-MOPS minimal medium (6Neidhardt F.C. Bloch P.L. Smith D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 736-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with 20 mm15NH4Cl and 0.4% [13C]glucose containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. For deuterium-labeled proteins, medium containing 80% D2O was used. The cells were grown at 37 °C, induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when an A600 value of 0.8 was reached, and harvested after 4 h. Proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow resin (Qiagen). The bound protein was eluted from the resin with a buffer containing 250 mm imidazole, incubated with thrombin (10 units/ml) for 4 h at 37 °C, and dialyzed overnight to remove the imidazole. The solution was passed again through the nickel column, and untagged protein was collected in the flow-through. The resulting AHSP was concentrated before being applied to a Superdex 75 gel-filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions containing pure AHSP, as judged by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry, were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed into the NMR buffer. Purification of α-Hemoglobin from Human Blood—CO gas was bubbled through packed red blood cells to form CO-Hb. The packed red blood cells were lysed with two volumes of cold distilled water. The method described by Antonini and Brunori (7Antonini E. Brunori M. Neuberger A. Tatum E.L. Frontiers of Biology. 21. North-Holland, Amsterdam1971: 1-30Google Scholar) was used to produce hemoglobin tetramers. p-Hydroxymercuribenzoate was used to isolate α-hemoglobin. Isolated α-hemoglobin was purified and equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl and 20 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 using a Superdex 75 column from Amersham Biosciences. NMR Sample Preparation—Protein samples for NMR spectroscopy were typically 0.5–1.0 mm in 90% H2O, 10% 2H2O, 5% sodium azide containing 50 mm NaCl and 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) or 150 mm NaCl and 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) for the binding experiments and their corresponding controls. NMR Spectroscopy—All of the NMR spectra were recorded at 298 K on Bruker DRX-500, Avance-600, and Avance-800 spectrometers. Backbone assignments were obtained from two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC and three-dimensional HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCACB, and CBCA- (CO)NH experiments (8Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional TOCSY, double quantum filtered-COSY, and 1H-13C HSQC and three-dimensional HCCH-COSY and 15N-edited total correlation spectroscopy experiments were acquired to complete the side chain assignments. Distance constraints were obtained from two-dimensional NOESY experiments analyzed in combination with 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY spectra recorded at a mixing time of 100 ms. Leu and Val stereospecific methyl assignments were obtained from 1H-13C HSQC spectra of 10% 13C-labeled samples. Three-dimensional HNHB and two-dimensional double quantum filtered-COSY spectra were used for the stereospecific assignment of CβH proton resonances. Spectra were referenced relative to external sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate for proton and carbon signals or liquid ammonium for that of nitrogen. All of the NMR spectra were processed with NMRPipe (9Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11450) Google Scholar) and analyzed with ANSIG (version 3.3) (10Helgstrand M. Kraulis P. Allard P. Hard T. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). 1DNH residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) were measured at 298 K on Pf1 phage-containing samples (11Hansen M.R. Mueller L. Pardi A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar) of the wild-type AHSP (∼0.8 mm, 15N-labeled) and the AHSP mutant P30A (∼0.5 mm, 15N/2H-double labeled) in 50 mm NaCl and 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). Pf1 phage (ASLA Biotech, Ltd., Riga, Latvia) was added at a concentration of 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml for the wild type and the mutant, respectively. 1DNH RDCs were obtained from the peak displacement in the f2 dimension of two separate two-dimensional 1H-15N TROSY spectra (12Lerche M.H. Meissner A. Poulsen F.M. Sorensen O.W. J. Magn. Reson. 1999; 140: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Values of 1JNH obtained from isotropic phase control experiments lacking the Pf1 were subtracted from the peak splittings observed in the aligned phase spectra. All splittings were determined from one-dimensional traces as the displacement that produces the maximum integral of the overlap region between corresponding traces from the two spectra. Complex samples were prepared by adding a 1.5-fold excess of unlabeled α-hemoglobin solution to 15N,13C-labeled AHSP (both in 150 mm NaCl and 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0). Complex formation was monitored at 298 K by two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra. Assignments for bound AHSP were obtained from three-dimensional HNCA, HN(CO)CA, and CBCA(CO)NH experiments (8Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). Structure Calculation—The inter-proton distance constraints were classified into four categories corresponding to 1.8–2.8, 1.8–3.5, 1.8–4.75, and 1.8–6.0 Å, respectively. To maintain a hydrogen bond, constraints of 1.8–2.1 and 2.7–3.1 Å were imposed on the distances between the hydrogen and the donor nitrogen, respectively, and the acceptor oxygen. Torsion angle constraints were obtained from the stereospecific assignment of residue side chains and incorporated in the structure calculation along with the backbone ϕ and Ψ angle constraints determined with the program TALOS (13Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2732) Google Scholar). To incorporate the dipolar couplings into the structure calculation, we obtained initial values of the axial (Da) and rhombic (Dr) components of the molecular alignment tensor using the program PALES (14Zweckstetter M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 3791-3792Crossref Scopus (593) Google Scholar). We could not estimate those values from the histogram distribution of dipolar couplings (15Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 133: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), because as the AHSP structure is highly anisotropic, we cannot assume a uniform isotropic distribution of the N-H vectors. Final values of Da (12.8 Hz) and Dr (3.2 Hz) were obtained for both the wild-type and the P30A mutant through a grid search by minimizing the total energy of the calculated structures. The structures were calculated using a standard torsion angle dynamics-simulated annealing protocol with the program CNS (16Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Circular Dichroism Spectropolarimetry—Spectra were collected on an Aviv 215 spectropolarimeter using a 0.1-cm path length cell. Protein samples were prepared in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). Spectra were collected at 298 K from 200–260 nm by taking points at 1-nm intervals with a bandwidth of 1 nm. A settling time of 1 s and an averaging time of 3 s were used. Spectra were typically the average of three scans. For the thermal denaturation experiments, the ellipticity at 222 nm was monitored from 4 to 98 °C, using a resolution of 0.2 °C, a bandwidth of 1 nm, and a temperature gradient of 1 °C min-1. Conformational Heterogeneity of AHSP—The line width and dispersion of the signals observed in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of AHSP are indicative of a folded protein of molecular weight 11,000. However, the number of correlation signals significantly exceeds that expected for a 102-residue protein (Fig. 1). Assignment of the spectra using triple resonance experiments acquired by using a double labeled (13C, 15N) sample revealed that almost two-thirds of the amide signals (residues 19–53 and 73–94) are duplicated. A monomer/dimer equilibrium can be ruled out as a source of the extra signals on the basis of gel filtration chromatography and 1H amide T2 relaxation measurements (data not shown), both of which indicate that AHSP is monomeric in solution at the concentrations used for protein structural determination by NMR (∼1 mm). This conclusion is in agreement with a previous biophysical characterization of AHSP (4Gell D. Kong Y. Eaton S.A. Weiss M.J. Mackay J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40602-40609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Hence, an intramolecular conformational exchange is the only plausible mechanism responsible for the extra signals in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum (also observed in the 1H and the 1H-13C HSQC spectra). The volume integration of isolated cross-peaks corresponding to the two conformations indicates that the populations of both forms are approximately equal at room temperature. Based on 1H and 15N chemical shift differences, the estimated lower limit of the lifetime of the two species is 0.1 s. Evidence for Pro-30 cis/trans Isomerization—Proline cis/trans isomerization is one of the dynamic processes slow enough to account for the unusual conformational behavior of AHSP (17Wuthrich K. NMR of Protein and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 263Google Scholar). In agreement with this hypothesis, we observed that in the two-dimensional NOESY spectrum, NOEs characteristic of both the cis and the trans conformations of the Asp-29–Pro-30 bond are present (supplementary Fig. 1). The chemical shift difference between the 13Cβ and the 13Cγ nuclei for the two conformations of residue Pro-30 of AHSP are 4.59 and 9.14 ppm. These values are in good agreement with the average values (4.51 and 9.64 ppm, respectively for the trans and the cis conformation of the Xaa–Pro bond) estimated for the two isomers from statistical analysis of 13C chemical shifts of proline residues in proteins (18Schubert M. Labudde D. Oschkinat H. Schmieder P. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The other two proline residues within the folded region of AHSP (Pro-60 and Pro-80) where found to contain trans peptide bonds according to both the NOE pattern and the 13Cβ and 13Cγ chemical shift values criteria. As an independent test of the validity of the Pro-30 cis/trans equilibrium hypothesis, we decided to mutate this residue to an alanine. The AHSP mutant P30A was expressed and purified, and its structure was analyzed by NMR. An overlay of the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the wild-type AHSP and the AHSP mutant P30A is shown in Fig. 2. The single point mutation has a dramatic effect on the NMR spectrum. The number of peaks is significantly reduced, indicating that the mutant adopts a unique conformation in contrast with the two conformations adopted by the wild-type AHSP. Comparison between the Structures of the cis and trans Forms of the Wild-type AHSP—The presence of the conformational equilibrium significantly increased the difficulty of both the assignment of the AHSP spectra and the structure determination. We were, however, able to assign specifically to each conformation a substantial number of medium and long range NOEs similar to those typically used in structure calculations of helical proteins of this size (Table I). 1DNH RDCs were also measured for 69 NH bonds of the two AHSP forms (Table I). These experimental restraints together with dihedral angle constraints (13Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2732) Google Scholar) were used for the structure calculation of the cis and the trans conformations of AHSP. Both backbone and side chains are reasonably well defined for both conformations (Fig. 3). The N-terminal 4 residues and the C-terminal 11 are unstructured in both conformations.Table ISummary of conformational constraints and statistics for the 20 accepted structures of AHSP (cis and trans conformers) and the P30A mutant Calculated structures were accepted when no distance violations were greater than 0.3 Å, no angle violations were greater than 5.0°, and no RDC violations were greater than 2.5 Hz.

In both conformations of AHSP, helix 3 is significantly kinked because of the presence of Pro-80 in the middle of it. The three α-helices are arranged with a very rare right-handed twist. We found that, by using the DALI server (19Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar, 20Holm L. Sander C.

The main backbone differences between the cis and the trans forms are observed in the loop 1 region, where Pro-30 is located, with the cis conformation being more open than the trans (Fig. 3, A and B). The side chain of residue Leu-31 is pointing to opposite directions in both AHSP forms. Although within the cis conformation Leu-31 interacts with Phe-88 but not with Phe-27 (Fig. 3C), the situation is reversed within the trans conformation, with Leu-31 interacting with Phe-27 but not with Phe-88 (Fig. 3D). The cis and the trans forms also show slight differences in the side chain orientation of the aromatic residues forming the hydrophobic core (Fig. 3, E and F). The orientation of the C terminus of helix 3 is different in the structures of both forms of AHSP (Fig. 3, A and B), and this is reflected in the differences in the 1DNH values observed for the cis and the trans conformation in this region. Leu-89, for example, exhibits a 10-Hz change in 1DNH between both forms. Although the major structural differences between the two species are concentrated in loop 1 and the C-terminal part of helix 3 (Fig. 3), the chemical shift differences extend to a much larger area (supplementary Fig. 2) perhaps because of differences in the electrostatic contribution of the helix macrodipoles or to changes in the orientation of the aromatic side chains building up the hydrophobic core of the molecule (Fig. 3, E and F). Comparison between the Structures of the AHSP Mutant P30A and the Wild Type—A structure calculation of the P30A mutant was also performed (Table I). The structures of the two forms of the wild type and the P30A mutant have the same global fold. The sequential NOE pattern for P30A is consistent with the expected trans conformation of the peptide bond connecting residues Asp-29 and Ala-30, and the structure of loop 1 is similar to that seen in the structure of the trans conformation of the Asp-29–Pro-30 peptide bond in the wild-type AHSP. The orientation of the C-terminal part of helix 3 in the P30A mutant is intermediate to that observed in the cis and the trans conformers. Chemical Shift Mapping of the α-Hemoglobin Binding Site—To identify the residues of AHSP involved in binding to α-hemoglobin, we followed the chemical shift changes in the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra of AHSP in the presence and in the absence of α-hemoglobin. Significant differences were observed in amide 1H and 15N chemical shifts throughout the protein sequence (Fig. 4). The largest changes are seen for residues in the C-terminal half of helix 1, loop 1, and the N-terminal half of helix 2 (Fig. 5A and supplementary Fig. 3). Changes of more than 1 ppm occurred in the 13Cα chemical shifts corresponding to the residues surrounding residue Pro-30 (Fig. 5B and supplementary Fig. 3). This indicates that the backbone conformation of loop 1 of AHSP undergoes a rearrangement upon α-hemoglobin binding. 1H, 15N, and 13Cα chemical shift changes were also observed for residues at the end of helix 3, although these were lower in magnitude and are probably not related to direct contact with α-hemoglobin but are rather due to rearrangements in this region as a result of the complex formation.Fig. 5Helix 1, loop 1, and helix 2 of AHSP form a platform for α-hemoglobin recognition. Shown are chemical shift changes upon complex formation (δbound - δfree) mapped onto the structure of the trans conformer of AHSP. A, 1H and 15N amide combined chemical shift changes in Hz. Amino acids showing changes larger than 100 Hz are shown in green. B, 13Cα chemical shift changes in Hz. Amino acids showing changes larger than 75 Hz (>0.5 ppm at 150.9 MHz) are depicted in red. Side chains of these residues have been included. The N and C termini are labeled.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The most remarkable difference between the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the bound and the free protein is that the splitting observed in the spectra of the free form is not observed in the bound protein (Fig. 4). This indicates that once AHSP binds to α-hemoglobin, residue Pro-30 adopts primarily just one conformation. Chemical shift mapping data indicate that the P30A mutant also binds to α-hemoglobin (supplementary Fig. 4). A similar distribution of 1H and 15N chemical shift changes was observed for P30A and wild-type AHSP complexes (supplementary Fig. 5), suggesting that the α-hemoglobin binding site in the mutant is located in the same region of the protein as in the wild type. Natural Variation in AHSP Sequence—It has been proposed that alterations in the expression levels of AHSP or sequence differences in the protein could account for the variation in disease severity observed in β-thalassemia patients with identical mutations in the β-globin gene (26Viprakasit V. Tanphaichitr V.S. Chinchang W. Sangkla P. Weiss M.J. Higgs D.R. Blood. 2004; 103: 3296-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). One sequence polymorphism of AHSP (M45K) has already been reported (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism data base number rs10920), and a second sequence variant (N75I) has been identified during the course of a program to study the natural variation in the sequence of medically important proteins in the general population. 2N. A. Watkins and W. H. Ouwehand, unpublished data. Asn-75 is a solvent-exposed residue that is not part of the proposed α-hemoglobin binding site (see supplementary Fig. 6), and the substitution of an asparagine for an isoleucine at this position would not be expected to alter the function of AHSP. The melting temperature (Tm) of the N75I variant is 54 °C compared with 60 °C for the wild-type protein, indicating that the change in sequence does not significantly alter the stability of the protein. The stability of the M45K variant is also similar to that of wild-type AHSP (Tm of unfolding, 58 °C), and the side chain of residue Met-45 is not part of the AHSP binding interface (supplementary Fig. 6). Both of these variants would therefore be expected to be neutral. Although the existence of conformational heterogeneity in the native state of proteins due to a proline isomerization has been known for many years (for review, see Ref. 27Andreotti A.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9515-9524Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), AHSP is one of the few examples showing long range structural rearrangements for which the structures of the two conformers have been solved (28Grochulski P.

Remarkably, the AHSP conformational heterogeneity disappears upon complex formation with α-hemoglobin (Fig. 4). Although we could not unambiguously determine (based on NOE patterns or 13C chemical shift values) the conformation of the Asp-29–Pro-30 peptide bond in the complex, a variety of evidence points to the trans conformation being the one involved in α-hemoglobin recognition. First, the chemical shifts of the bound state more closely resemble those of the uncomplexed trans form in parts of the protein away from the binding site. Second, the fact that the P30A mutant (in which the Asp-29–Ala-30 peptide bond is in the trans conformation) binds to α-hemoglobin suggests that the trans form of the wild-type protein is the one involved in α-hemoglobin recognition. We have mapped the interaction between AHSP and α-hemoglobin by two different NMR parameters: the average 1H and 15N chemical shifts and the 13Cα chemical shift (which all provide complementary information). The 1H and 15N chemical shifts are more sensitive to variations in tertiary structure, charge distribution, and complex formation, even if these do not lead to substantial local conformational rearrangements. On the other hand, 13Cα chemical shift values are dominated by the backbone conformation of the protein (ϕ and Ψ angles). Fig. 5A shows that nearly all of the amide chemical shift changes map to helix 1, loop 1, and helix 2 and define this surface as the interaction region. This interface has distinctive features, such as a large negative cluster at the beginning of helix 2 (Fig. 6, A and B) and a number of hydrophobic patches (the largest of them in loop 1) (Fig. 6, B and C). The negatively charged region is mainly contributed by two consecutive strictly conserved glutamate side chains (E34 and E35) (supplementary Fig. 7). The solvent-exposed side chains of Phe-47 and Tyr-51 are also likely to be involved in intermolecular interactions. Tyr-51 is strictly conserved among species, whereas Phe-47 can only be substituted by Leu (supplementary Fig. 7), suggesting that hydrophobic residues are required at these two positions. The differences in 13Cα chemical shifts are mainly restricted to the end of helix 2 (from residue 46 to 52) (Fig. 5B) and loop 1. Both regions are likely to undergo conformational changes upon binding. Functional adult HbA consists of two α- and two β-globin chains. The α1β1 interface is positively charged and has a high hydrophobic character, whereas the α1β2 interface is negatively charged and contains fewer hydrophobic residues (Fig. 7). Interestingly, the α1 surface at the α1β1 interface has features complementary to the α-hemoglobin binding site of AHSP (Fig. 6). This suggests that, as has been predicted previously (4Gell D. Kong Y. Eaton S.A. Weiss M.J. Mackay J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40602-40609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), AHSP interacts with α-hemoglobin at the α1β1 interface and not at the α1β2 one. Although we have established a probable role for the trans conformation of AHSP in α-hemoglobin recognition, the biological function of the cis conformer is not clear. Pro-30 is strictly conserved in all the available mammalian AHSP sequences, whereas non-proline residues are found at positions equivalent to residues Pro-60 and Pro-80 (see supplementary Fig. 7). The sequence homology is not restricted to Pro-30 itself, and most of the preceding residues in loop 1 (except Asn-28, which can be changed to another polar residue) are also conserved. This high degree of sequence conservation strongly suggests an evolutionarily conserved role of proline isomerization in AHSP. Other proteins that have similar proline-mediated conformational exchange have been reported to show different ligand specificity for both conformers (31Mallis R.J. Brazin K.N. Fulton D.B. Andreotti A.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 900-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 33Brazin K.N. Mallis R.J. Fulton D.B. Andreotti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Soc. 2003; 125: 15706-15707Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The differences in the conformation of loop 1 between the two forms of the wild-type AHSP are big enough for this also to be the case with AHSP. However, to date no other binding partner for AHSP has been reported, and further work would be necessary to address this point. We thank Dr. K. Nagai for helpful discussion and advice on α-hemoglobin sample preparation and Dr. Stefan M. Freund for help with the NMR spectra acquisition. Download .pdf (.81 MB) Help with pdf files"

In response to As2O3, the ΔΨm dissipation essentially results in the intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (HO·), and super-oxide radical ( O2−). Inhibition of GSH peroxidase (16Jing Y. Dai J. Chalmers-Redman R.M. Tatton W.G. Waxman S.

DNA topoisomerase I (Top1) is an essential nuclear enzyme (26Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar, 27Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar), which relaxes DNA supercoiling ahead of replication and transcription complexes by inducing transient single-strand breaks at many sites in the genome, thereby allowing rotation of the DNA double helix around the intact phosphodiester bonds opposite the enzyme-mediated DNA cleavages. Once the DNA has been relaxed, Top1 religates the breaks and regenerates intact duplex DNA. Biochemically, each Top1-mediated break results from the reversible transfer of a DNA phosphodiester bond to the enzyme catalytic tyrosine (human Tyr-723) (27Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, Top1 cleavage complexes are very transient and remain at very low levels; the DNA religation step is much faster than the cleavage step. These transient Top1 cleavage complexes can be stabilized by camptothecins. These drugs, commonly referred to as “Top1 poisons” or “Top1 inhibitors,” specifically bind at the Top1-DNA interface and trap the cleavage complexes by preventing the DNA religation step (28Hsiang Y.H.

The Top1 poisoning effect of As2O3 is indirect because As2O3 does not induce the formation of Top1 cleavage complexes when incubated with recombinant Top1. These Top1-DNA complexes occur in association with As2O3-induced apoptosis, and we propose that they are due to oxidative DNA lesions generated by As2O3-induced ROS and caspase activation. Finally, we provide evidence for the participation of Top1 in chromatin fragmentation during As2O3-induced apoptosis. Drugs and Chemical Reagents—As2O3, etoposide (VP-16), N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), lipoic acid (LA), and dl-buthionine-(SR)-sulfoximine (BSO) were obtained from Sigma; camptothecin (CPT) was obtained from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, NCI (Bethesda, MD); and the caspase peptide inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-dl-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-fmk) was from Bachem (Torrance, CA). Stock solutions were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) (CPT, VP-16, Z-VAD-fmk) or ethanol (LA) and stored at -20 °C. Further dilutions were made in culture medium just before use. The final concentration of Me2SO or ethanol in culture medium never exceed 0.1% (v/v), which was nontoxic to the cells. As2O3 was diluted in H2O and stored at 4 °C. NAC and BSO were diluted in culture medium prior to use. [2-14C]Thymidine was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Recombinant human Top1 was purified from TN5 insect cells (HighFive; Invitrogen) using a Baculovirus construct for the NH2-terminal truncated human Top1 cDNA as described previously (39Antony S. Jayaraman M. Laco G. Kohlhagen G. Kohn K.W. Cushman M. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7428-7435PubMed Google Scholar, 40Zhelkovsky A.M. Moore C.L. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—The human leukemic cell lines NB4 (APL-derived cells, kindly provided by Dr. M. Lanotte, INSERM U496, Hospital Saint-Louis, Paris, France) and U937 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and a U937-derivative cell clone containing the full-length bcl-2 cDNA (U937/Bcl-2, kindly provided by Dr J. Bréard, INSERM U461, Chatenay-Malabry, France) were grown in suspension in RPMI 1640 medium with glutamax-I (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Woodland, CA) and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The murine leukemia cell line P388 and its camptothecin-resistant, Top1-deficient subline, P388/CPT45 (35Pourquier P. Takebayashi Y. Urasaki Y. Gioffre C. Kohlhagen G. Pommier Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), were gifts from M. R. Mattern and R. K. Johnson (GlaxoSmithKline). Detection of Covalent Top1-DNA Complexes—Top1-DNA complexes were detected using the in vivo complex of enzyme bioassay (41Subramanian D. Kraut E. Staubus A. Young D.C. Muller M.T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2097-2103PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 106 cells were lysed in 1% Sarkosyl and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. Cell lysate was layered on cesium chloride step gradients and centrifuged at 165,000 × g for 20 h at 20 °C. Twenty fractions (0.5 ml each) were collected from the bottom, diluted into an equal volume of 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.6, and applied to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, MA) by using a slot-blot vacuum manifold. Topoisomerase-DNA complexes were detected by immunoblotting using the C21 Top1 mouse monoclonal antibody (a kind gift from Dr. Yung-Chi Cheng, Yale University, New Haven, CT) or a Top2 monoclonal antibody (clone Ki-S1) from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Top1-mediated DNA Cleavage Assay—Approximately 50 fmol of 3′-α-32P-end-labeled 161-bp DNA fragment (39Antony S. Jayaraman M. Laco G. Kohlhagen G. Kohn K.W. Cushman M. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7428-7435PubMed Google Scholar) was incubated with 5 ng of recombinant human Top1 with or without drugs at 25 °C in 10 μl of reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 15 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). Reactions were stopped by adding 0.5% SDS and 3.3 volumes of Maxam Gilbert loading buffer (80% formamide, 10 mm sodium hydroxide, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue, pH 8.0). Aliquots were separated in 16% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (7 m urea) in TBE (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA) for 2 h at 40 V/cm. Imaging and quantitation were performed by using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). DNA Fragmentation—DNA fragmentation-related apoptosis was quantified using the previously reported filter elution assay (42Bertrand R. Kohn K.W. Solary E. Pommier Y. Drug Dev. Res. 1995; 34: 138-144Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with 0.02 μCi/ml [2-14C]thymidine and cultured at 37 °C for 2 days. Then cells were chased in isotope-free medium overnight, resuspended in fresh medium, and treated. One million treated or untreated labeled cells were loaded onto a protein-absorbing filter (Metricel® Membrane Filter, 0.8-μm pore size, 25 mm diameter; Pall Corp.). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.2% sodium Sarkosyl, 2 m NaCl, 0.04 m EDTA, pH 10.0. The filters were then washed with 0.02 m EDTA, pH 10.0. DNA was depurinated by incubation of filters in 1 m HCl at 65 °C and then released from the filters with 0.4 m NaOH at room temperature. Radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry in each fraction (wash, lysis, EDTA wash, and filter). DNA fragmentation was measured as the fraction of disintegrations/min in the lysis fraction plus EDTA wash relative to the total intracellular disintegrations/min. For sub-G1 analysis, DNA content was assessed by staining ethanol-fixed cells with propidium iodide and monitoring by FACScan (BD Biosciences). The numbers of cells with sub-G1 DNA were determined with a CellQuest program (BD Biosciences). Caspase-3 Activity—Caspase-3 activity was measured as described (43Sordet O. Rebe C. Plenchette S. Zermati Y. Hermine O. Vainchenker W. Garrido C. Solary E. Dubrez-Daloz L. Blood. 2002; 100: 4446-4453Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). Twenty micrograms of protein from the resulting supernatant was incubated in buffer assay (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% glycerol, 20 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of 100 μm of the fluorogenic peptide substrate Z-DEVD-AFC (Calbiochem). 7-Amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (AFC) released from the substrate was excited at 400 nm to measure emission at 505 nm. Fluorescence was monitored continuously at 37 °C for 20 min in a dual luminescence fluorimeter (SPECTRAmax® GEMINI XS, Molecular Devices). Enzyme activities were determined as initial velocities expressed as relative intensity/min/mg. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed at 4 °C in buffer containing 1% SDS, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Diagnostics). Viscosity of the samples was reduced by brief sonication, and 20 μg of protein (Bio-Rad Protein Assay; Bio-Rad) were incubated in loading buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 4.6% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 0.003% bromphenol blue), separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, MA). After blocking nonspecific binding sites for 1 h by 0.2% casein in TPBS (phosphate-buffered saline, Tween 20 0.1%), the membrane was incubated for 2 h at room temperature with primary antibody. Antibodies used include rabbit antihuman procaspase-3 (Pharmingen) and Top1 (local source). After three washes in TPBS, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature and then washed three times in TPBS. Immunoblot was revealed using enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce) by autoradiography. Flow Cytometry Analyses—Dihydroethidine (Sigma) was used as a substrate for measuring the production of intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and other ROS. Expression of phosphatidylserine in the external layer of the plasma membrane was determined by studying the fixation of annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate in the presence of Ca2+ in cells that remain nonpermeant to propidium iodide (Annexin-V-FLUOS staining kit; Roche Diagnostics). All these analyses were performed using a FACScan cytometer (BD Biosciences). Top1 Silencing by RNA Interference—A human U6 promoter-driven DNA vector stably expressing siRNA hairpins targeting human Top1 mRNA was constructed. The vectors were obtained by inserting the human Top1 cDNA sequences (5′-CTT GAC AGC CAA GGT ATT C-3′) or negative control sequence (5′-GCG TCC TTT CCA CAA GAT A-3′, with limited homology to any known sequences in the human genome) into pBS/U6 plasmid (44Sui G. Soohoo C. Affarel B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar), respectively. Top1 cDNA sequence as well as negative control sequence together with the U6 promoter were then subcloned into pREP4-HB plasmid (45Liu R. Liu H. Chen X. Kirby M. Brown P.O. Zhao K. Cell. 2001; 106: 309-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) deleted for RSK promoter and containing hygromycin B selection marker. For RNA interference, HCT116 cells were transfected with the Top1 RNA-interfering constructs pREP4/Top1 and pREP4/negative vector, respectively, according to the LipofectAMINE™ 2000 protocol (Invitrogen). Transfected HCT116 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 600 μg/ml hygromycin B. After selection for 10–14 days, HCT116 clones were analyzed for Top1 expression by Western blotting. Silencing Top1 expression was confirmed by confocal microscopy analysis using rabbit antihuman Top1 (local source) and according to the method described previously (43Sordet O. Rebe C. Plenchette S. Zermati Y. Hermine O. Vainchenker W. Garrido C. Solary E. Dubrez-Daloz L. Blood. 2002; 100: 4446-4453Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). As2O3Induces Cellular Top1-DNA Complexes—The presence of Top1-DNA complexes in genomic DNA can be detected after cesium chloride gradient centrifugation and fractionation from tissue culture cells and tumor samples (41Subramanian D. Kraut E. Staubus A. Young D.C. Muller M.T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2097-2103PubMed Google Scholar). In As2O3-treated human promyelocytic NB4 cells, immunoblotting revealed the presence of Top1 in the DNA-containing fractions (fractions 7–11) (Fig. 1A). No Top2-DNA complexes could be detected in these same fractions (Fig. 1A). As expected, Top1-DNA complexes were also observed in NB4 cells exposed to the Top1 inhibitor camptothecin, and Top2-DNA complexes were only observed in cells treated with etoposide (VP-16) (Fig. 1A). However, unlike camptothecin, As2O3 was not able to generate Top1 cleavage complexes in normal DNA in the presence of recombinant human Top1 in vitro (Fig. 1B), indicating that As2O3 does not directly poison Top1. Thus, cellular Top1-DNA complexes are secondary to intracellular modifications induced by As2O3. As2O3-induced Top1-DNA Complexes Are Formed in Cells Undergoing Apoptosis—Given that As2O3 is a known inducer of apoptosis in human leukemic cells (2Miller Jr., W.H. Schipper H.M. Lee J.S. Singer J. Waxman S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3893-3903PubMed Google Scholar), we tested whether the cellular Top1-DNA complexes resulted from the engagement of apoptotic pathway(s) induced by As2O3. Top1-DNA complexes were detected in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A and B) concomitantly with apoptotic DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2C). Also, the formation of the Top1-DNA complexes induced by As2O3 was coincident with the activation of caspase-3, as demonstrated by the decrease of the Mr 32,000 proform of caspase-3 (Fig. 2D, bottom panel) and the ability of cell lysates to cleave DEVD-AFC, a fluorogenic peptide substrate that mimics the target site of caspase-3 and closely related caspases (Fig. 2D, top panel). Kinetics of caspase-3 activation was further confirmed by the caspase-dependent cleavage of the nuclear enzymes Top1 (46Samejima K. Svingen P.A. Basi G.S. Kottke T. Mesner Jr., P.W. Stewart L. Durrieu F. Poirier G.G. Alnemri E.S. Champoux J.J. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4335-4340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) (47Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, NB4 cells exhibited phosphatidylserine on the outer plasma membrane leaflet at the time Top1-DNA complexes were detected (Fig. 2F). Thus, the induction of Top1-DNA complexes by As2O3 in NB4 cells is closely associated with apoptosis. To examine further the relationship between Top1-DNA complexes and apoptosis, we examined the formation of these complexes in As2O3-sensitive and As2O3-resistant cells. We and others (10Larochette N. Decaudin D. Jacotot E. Brenner C. Marzo I. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Xie Z. Reed J. Kroemer G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 12Sordet O. Rebe C. Leroy I. Bruey J.M. Garrido C. Miguet C. Lizard G. Plenchette S. Corcos L. Solary E. Blood. 2001; 97: 3931-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) had found previously that overexpression of full-length Bcl-2 protects U937 leukemia cells against apoptosis induced by As2O3. Bcl-2 overexpression prevented caspase-3 activation and caspase-mediated Top1 cleavage (Fig. 3A) and markedly decreased DNA fragmentation in U937 cells (Fig. 3B). Inhibition of As2O3-induced apoptosis by Bcl-2 overexpression also inhibited the formation of Top1-DNA complexes (Fig. 3C). Collectively, these findings indicate that the formation of Top1-DNA complexes is related to apoptosis in NB4 cells following As2O3 treatment. Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species Production Is Required for As2O3-induced Top1-DNA Complexes—Generation of intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a major determinant for As2O3-induced apoptosis (2Miller Jr., W.H. Schipper H.M. Lee J.S. Singer J. Waxman S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3893-3903PubMed Google Scholar). Because Top1 cleavage complexes can be produced by oxidative DNA lesions (see Introduction), we investigated whether modulation of ROS levels by changing the cellular GSH content would affect the generation of Top1-DNA complexes by As2O3. Treatment of NB4 cells with As2O3 together with NAC (8Dai J. Weinberg R.S. Waxman S. Jing Y. Blood. 1999; 93: 268-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or LA, which up-regulate GSH (7Davison K. Cote S. Mader S. Miller W.H. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2003; 17: 931-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 48Han D. Handelman G. Marcocci L. Sen C.K. Roy S. Kobuchi H. Tritschler H.J. Flohe L. Packer L. Biofactors. 1997; 6: 321-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), prevented both As2O3-induced ROS production (Fig. 4A) and apoptotic DNA fragmentation (Fig. 4B). By using the same experimental conditions, NAC and LA also abrogated As2O3-induced Top1-DNA complexes (Fig. 4C). Conversely, treatment of NB4 cells with a nontoxic concentration of As2O3 (0.5 μm) (Fig. 2C) together with BSO, which induces GSH depletion (49Griffith O.W. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7558-7560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), potentiated both the accumulation of intracellular ROS (Fig. 4D) and apoptosis (Fig. 4E) following As2O3 exposure. Under these conditions, BSO also potentiated the formation of Top1"
https://openalex.org/W2076578338,"The phospho-Ser/Thr-directed prolyl-isomerase Pin1 was originally identified in vertebrate systems as a negative regulator of NIMA, a Ser/Thr protein kinase that regulates the G2/M transition in Aspergillus nidulans. Here we explore the physiological roles of the Pin1 orthologue, PINA, in A. nidulans and evaluate the relevance of the interaction of PINA with NIMA in this fungus. We find pinA to be an essential gene in A. nidulans. In addition, when PINA levels are reduced 50-fold the cells grow at a reduced rate. Upon germination under conditions that repress PINA expression, the cells are delayed in the interphase activation of NIMXcdc2, whereas they traverse the other phases of the cell cycle at a similar rate to controls. These results indicate that a marked reduction of PINA results in a lengthening of G1. Additionally, PINA repression increases the rate at which the cells enter mitosis following release from a hydroxyurea arrest without altering the sensitivity of the fungus to agents that activate the replication or DNA damage checkpoints. In contrast to predictions based on Pin1, the physical interaction between PINA and NIMA is primarily dependent upon the prolylisomerase domain of PINA and the C-terminal 303 amino acids of NIMA. Finally, reduction of PINA levels exacerbates the nimA5 temperature-sensitive mutant, whereas overexpression of PINA decreases the severity of this mutation, results that are consistent with a positive genetic interaction between PINA and NIMA. Thus, although PINA is essential and positively regulates NIMA function, A. nidulans is most sensitive to a reduction in PINA concentration in G1 rather than in G2/M. The phospho-Ser/Thr-directed prolyl-isomerase Pin1 was originally identified in vertebrate systems as a negative regulator of NIMA, a Ser/Thr protein kinase that regulates the G2/M transition in Aspergillus nidulans. Here we explore the physiological roles of the Pin1 orthologue, PINA, in A. nidulans and evaluate the relevance of the interaction of PINA with NIMA in this fungus. We find pinA to be an essential gene in A. nidulans. In addition, when PINA levels are reduced 50-fold the cells grow at a reduced rate. Upon germination under conditions that repress PINA expression, the cells are delayed in the interphase activation of NIMXcdc2, whereas they traverse the other phases of the cell cycle at a similar rate to controls.

Thus, although PINA is essential and positively regulates NIMA function, A. nidulans is most sensitive to a reduction in PINA concentration in G1 rather than in G2/M. Pin1 is an evolutionarily conserved member of the parvulin family of proline isomerases that selectively targets proteins containing proline preceded by phospho-Ser/Thr residues (reviewed in Refs. 1Lu K.P. Liou Y.C. Zhou X.Z. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 164-172Google Scholar and 2Joseph J.D. Yeh E.S. Swenson K.I. Means A.R. Meijer L. Jezequel A. Roberge M. Progress in Cell Cycle Research. 5. Life in Progress Editions, Roscoff, France2003: 477-487Google Scholar). The phospho-epitopes recognized by Pin1 show remarkable sequence similarity with that of the mitosis-specific antibody, MPM-2, and are frequently generated by cdk2 or mitogen-activate protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation (3Yaffe M.B. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X.Z. Stukenberg P.T. Rahfeld J.U. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Fischer G. Cantley L.C. Lu K.P. Science. 1997; 278: 1957-1960Google Scholar). Based on Pin1 interaction studies as well as predictions based on substrate specificity and analysis of Pin1 function in multiple eukaryotic systems, Pin1 has been implicated in numerous signaling pathways critical for cell proliferation. However, the phenotypic consequences of Pin1 deletion, depletion, or inhibition vary greatly among organisms. Whereas Pin1 is essential for growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans, only subtle phenotypes are observed when Pin1 is deleted in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and quite specific ones occur in Drosophila and mouse (4Hanes S.D.

As might be predicted from its substrate specificity, Pin1 has been demonstrated to play an important role in regulating both mitosis and G1. Indeed, temperature-sensitive mutants of the S. cerevisiae and C. albicans Pin1 homologue, Ess1p, arrest cells in mitosis (5Devasahayam G. Chaturvedi V. Hanes S.D. Genetics. 2002; 160: 37-48Google Scholar, 13Wu X. Wilcox C.B. Devasahayam G. Hackett R.L. Arevalo-Rodriguez M. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. Hanes S.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3727-3738Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of Pin1 antisense RNA in HeLa cells has been reported to induce either a mitotic arrest (14Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Google Scholar) or an interphase arrest with high levels of apoptosis (15Rippmann J.F. Hobbie S. Daiber C. Guilliard B. Bauer M. Birk J. Nar H. Garin-Chesa P. Rettig W.J. Schnapp A. Cell Growth & Differ. 2000; 11: 409-416Google Scholar). However, at least in the case of S. cerevisiae, the mitotic role of Ess1p appears to result from transcriptional alterations rather than via direct interaction with critical mitotic regulatory proteins (13Wu X. Wilcox C.B. Devasahayam G. Hackett R.L. Arevalo-Rodriguez M. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. Hanes S.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3727-3738Google Scholar). Regardless, Pin1 has been demonstrated to interact with a number of signaling molecules involved in mitotic progression, including cdc25, wee1, plk1, and NIMA (14Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Google Scholar, 16Shen M. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Lu K.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 706-720Google Scholar, 17Crenshaw D.G. Yang J. Means A.R. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1315-1327Google Scholar). In contrast to the mitotic arrest observed when Pin1 is depleted from HeLa cells, MEFs 1The abbreviations used are: MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; HA, hemagglutinin. 1The abbreviations used are: MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; HA, hemagglutinin. derived from the Pin1 null mouse display no detectible mitotic phenotype but, rather, proliferate slightly more slowly than controls and are impaired in their ability to re-enter the cell cycle after serum starvation (9Fujimori F.

Biochem. 2002; 84: 211-216Google Scholar). In support of a G1 role for Pin1, it is required for the proper timing of primordial germ cell proliferation due to a lengthening of G1 and has been reported to positively regulate c-Jun, β-catenin, and cyclinD1, all of which are involved in G1 progression (10Liou Y.C. Ryo A. Huang H.K. Lu P.J. Bronson R. Fujimori F. Uchida T. Hunter T. Lu K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1335-1340Google Scholar, 11Atchison F.W. Capel B. Means A.R.

Although Pin1 has been demonstrated to interact with and regulate a number of phospho-proteins in numerous systems, it was initially identified as an interactor and suppressor of the lethality induced by overexpression of the Aspergillus nidulans essential G2/M regulatory protein kinase, NIMA, in a yeast two-hybrid screen (14Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Google Scholar). The identification of Pin1 as a negative regulator of NIMA was supported by the observations that not only is the mitotic arrest induced by NIMA overexpression in HeLa cells abrogated by coexpression of Pin1, but overexpression of Pin1 in the absence of active NIMA arrests the cells in G2. Asin HeLa cells, NIMA overexpression in Aspergillus induces a pseudomitotic state characterized by microtubule depolymerization and chromatin condensation. On the other hand, the repression of NIMA activity arrests cells in G2 (22Osmani S.A. Pu R.T. Morris N.R. Cell. 1988; 53: 237-244Google Scholar). Thus, the two-hybrid and HeLa cell results are consistent with the notion that Pin1 could function as a negative regulator of NIMA and a NIMA-like signaling pathway in mammalian cells. To understand the in vivo relevance of the interaction of NIMA with Pin1 we have evaluated the function of the A. nidulans Pin1 homologue, PINA. Similar to the results in the yeasts S. cerevisiae and C. albicans, disruption of PINA in A. nidulans is lethal. However, using an inducible expression system, we find that a 50-fold reduction of PINA expression is sufficient to allow growth, albeit at a markedly slower rate than the wild-type strain. In contrast to the mitotic arrest due to ess1ts mutants, yet similar to defects in Pin1 null cells, PINA depletion delays the timing of G1 progression. Furthermore, we identify a potential role for PINA in regulating the recovery from a replication checkpoint arrest, because cells with reduced levels of PINA enter mitosis more quickly than controls following release from a hydroxyurea-induced arrest without sensitizing the cells to the drug. Finally, in contrast to predictions of earlier studies in S. cerevisiae and HeLa cells, PINA genetically interacts with and is a positive regulator of NIMA kinase function in A. nidulans. A. nidulans and S. cerevisiae Strains and Culture Techniques—The A. nidulans strains used in this study were GR5(pyrG89; pyroA4; wA3), SO6(pyrG89; yA2; wA2; cnxE16; nimA5; choA1; cha1); SWJ32(nimG10; pyrG89; nicA2; chaA1), SWJ193(pabaA1; wA2; nimE6; methB3), CDS46(nimT23; pyrG89; one extra copy nimA-4xHA; nicA2; chaA1), JJ31(alcA:pinA; pyroA4; wA3), JJ32(pyroA4; wA3), JJ32(alcA:pinA; nimG10), JJ33(nimG10), JJ34(alcA:pinA; yA2; wA2; cnxE16; nimA5; choA1; cha1), JJ35(yA2; wA2; cnxE16; nimA5; choA1; cha1), JJ36(alcA: pinA; wA2; nimE6), and JJ37(nimT23; pyrG89; one extra copy nimA-4xHA; alcA:pinA; chaA1). A. nidulans strains were propagated in standard minimal medium containing either dextrose, glycerol, or glycerol plus threonine as the carbon source and the appropriate nutritional supplements at either 30 °C or 37 °C unless otherwise indicated (23Lu K.P. Means A.R. Methods Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 255-275Google Scholar). Benomyl (Sigma-Aldrich) and hydroxyurea (Sigma-Aldrich) were used at final concentrations of 5 μg/ml and 20 mm, respectively. All genetic crosses were performed as described by Pontecorvo (24Pontecorvo G. Demerec M. Advances in Genetics. Academic Press, New York1953: 141-238Google Scholar). For two-hybrid interaction analysis pAD (carrying LEU2) and pBD (carrying TRP1) vectors containing various inserts were cotransformed into strain YRG-2 (Matα, ura3–52, his3–200, ade2–101, lys2–801, trp1–901, leu2–3 112, gal4–542, gal80–538, LYS2::UASGAL1-TATAGAL1-HIS3, URA3::UASGAL4 17mers(x3)-TATACYC1-lacZ) and plated onto medium lacking Leu and Trp. To test for protein interaction, the transformants were plated onto medium lacking Leu, Trp, and His. Standard S. cerevisiae transformation and culture techniques were used (25Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Abelson J.N. Simon M.I. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular and Cell Biology, Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, New York2002: 351Google Scholar). Generation of A. nidulans Vectors and Transformation—pPINAdis was generated by cloning a portion of the PINA gene containing nucleotides 55–552 (equivalent to 55–499 of cDNA, generated by PCR of the genomic PINA clone) into the EcoRI and SmaI sites of pRG1 (26Waring R.B. May G.S. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 79: 119-130Google Scholar). The pAlcPINA vector was generated by cloning the 5′ end of the PINA gene into the SmaI site of pAL3 as a blunted HindIII/XmnI fragment (26Waring R.B. May G.S. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 79: 119-130Google Scholar). All vectors were sequenced prior to use. A. nidulans GR5 cells were transformed as described by Lu and Means (23Lu K.P. Means A.R. Methods Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 255-275Google Scholar). Positive transformants were selected by growth on minimal medium in the absence of uracil and uridine to select for the presence of the pyr4 nutritional marker. Transformants of pPINAdis were maintained as heterokaryons by transfer of mycelia instead of spores. Southern analysis was performed on vegetatively growing mycelia as described by Rasmussen et al. (27Rasmussen C.D. Means R.L. Lu K.P. May G.S. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13767-13775Google Scholar). Transformants of pAlcPINA were streaked three times to ensure strain purity followed by Southern analysis and Western analysis to ensure homologous integration and protein expression. Microscopy and Growth Assays—Nuclear number and staining were performed by growing spores in minimal medium on glass coverslips at a concentration of 104 spores/ml. Germlings were collected at various times after germination followed immediately by fixing and staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole or Hoechst 33258 as described by Harris et al. (28Harris S.D. Morrell J.L. Hamer J.E. Genetics. 1994; 136: 517-532Google Scholar). Chromosome mitotic indices were determined using cells germinated in liquid medium at 30 °C and 200 rpm for ∼5 h followed by cell cycle arrest via temperature shift to 42 °C or the addition of 20 mm hydroxyurea for 3 h. Cells were then released into fresh medium or 30 °C, and samples were fixed and stained and scored for mitotic nuclei as described by Lu and Means (23Lu K.P. Means A.R. Methods Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 255-275Google Scholar). Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Rabbit anti-PINA polyclonal antibodies were generated using keyhole limpet hemocyaninconjugated, bacterially expressed PINA as the antigen. The coupled protein was injected into rabbits, and antiserum was collected using standard techniques (29Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Western analysis of PINA was performed using a 1:5000 dilution of the anti-PINA antisera and detected using either 125I-Protein A (Amersham Biosciences) at a concentration of 105 cpm/ml or HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Western analysis of phospho-Ser-10 histone H3 was performed as described by DeSouza et al. (30De Souza C.P. Osmani A.H. Wu L.P. Spotts J.L. Osmani S.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 293-302Google Scholar). Western analysis of HA-NIMA was performed using the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science) at a dilution of 1:1000 followed by detection using HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. MPM-2 reactive epitopes were detected using 1 μg/ml MPM2 monoclonal antibody (Upstate Cell Signaling) followed by detection via HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. HA-NIMA and PINA were immunoprecipitated from A. nidulans extracts prepared by grinding flash frozen germlings prepared as described by Dayton et al. (31Dayton J.S. Sumi M. Nanthakumar N.N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3223-3230Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation of both PINA and NIMA 500 μg of protein was brought to a total of 500 μl with lysis buffer followed by the addition of the primary antibody (2 μl of anti-PINA and 1 μg anti-HA). Following rocking for 1 h at 4 °C, ∼20 μl of protein A- or G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional hour. Following binding, the beads were washed five times in lysis buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with the addition of 30 μl of SDS-PAGE protein loading buffer and detected by Western analysis following SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and transfer to Immobilon P membrane (Millipore). Generation of S. cerevisiae Vectors—The NIMA and PINA truncations and mutations were cloned into pBD-GAL4 or pAD-GAL4 (Stratagene), respectively. Full-length NIMA was cloned into pBD-GAL4 as described in Crenshaw et al. (17Crenshaw D.G. Yang J. Means A.R. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1315-1327Google Scholar). NIMA truncations (amino acids 1–292, 293–699, 293–396, and 397–699) were generated by PCR and subcloned into pBD-GAL4 as SmaI/SalI fragments. Full-length PINA in pAD-GAL4 was originally generated by Crenshaw et al. (17Crenshaw D.G. Yang J. Means A.R. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1315-1327Google Scholar). PINA point mutants (W33A and C126A) were generated in pAD-GAL4 using the mega-primer mutagenesis technique (32Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407Google Scholar). PINA truncations, WW domain (amino acids 1–68) and PI domain (amino acids 56–176) were generated by PCR and subcloned as EcoRI/XhoI fragments into pADGAL4. All vectors were sequenced prior to use. NIMA and NIMX Kinase Assays—Extracts for NIMXcdc2 histone H1 kinase were prepared and assays were performed as described previously (33Joseph J.D. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38230-38238Google Scholar). 32P labeled phosphate incorporation of SDS-PAGE separated reactions was quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Full-length, bacterially expressed NIMA used for the in vitro kinase assays was generated by first cloning the NIMA cDNA into pET30 expression vector (Novagen) as an NcoI/SalI fragment. NIMA was expressed in freshly transformed BLR(DE3)pLysS competent cells (Novagen) grown at 37 °Ctoan A600 nm of 0.6 at which point the cultures were shifted to room temperature, and protein expression was induced with the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Following centrifugation the bacteria were resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml Pefabloc) and lysed by sonication. Following sonication, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.5%, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min. The extract was then clarified by centrifugation and incubated with nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) for 1 h with rocking at 4 °C. The bound resin was then washed with 20 ml of lysis buffer plus 0.5% Triton X-100, followed by 20 ml of lysis buffer plus 0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole. The bound protein was eluted in lysis buffer containing 250 mm imidazole and stored at –80 °C in 40% glycerol. Recombinant PINA was expressed, purified, and cleaved from the glutathione S-transferase tag as described by Crenshaw et al. (17Crenshaw D.G. Yang J. Means A.R. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1315-1327Google Scholar). NIMA kinase assays were performed using 100 ng of recombinant NIMA or NIMA immunoprecipitated from 500 μgof A. nidulans extract using either the anti-HA 12CA5 monoclonal antibody or anti-HA 3F10-conjugated Sepharose. Immunoprecipitation was as described above with two additional washes with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 1mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2). Conditions for the kinase assay were as follows: 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, 500 μm ATP, 1 mm F-peptide (GRFRRSRRMI), 0.2 μl/reaction [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were performed in 30 μl (for recombinant NIMA) or 50 μl (for immunoprecipitated NIMA) volumes for 10 min and terminated by spotting 20 μl of the reaction onto p81 phosphocellulose filters followed by extensive washing in 75 mm phosphoric acid. Activities were determined followed scintillation counting of the dried filters. When applicable purified, cleaved PINA or BSA was added to the kinase, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min prior to the initiation of the kinase assay. Phosphatase assays were performed at 30 °C using purified PP2A (Calbiochem) in the 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mm MnCl2 at a final concentration of ∼0.02 unit of PP2A/50 μg of NIMA. Time courses of dephosphorylation were terminated either by the addition of protein loading buffer for observation of phosphorylation or the addition of 0.5 μm okadaic acid followed by kinase assay for activity measurements. Either BSA or PINA was incubated with the recombinant NIMA in assay buffer 20 min prior to the initiation of reaction. Hydroxyurea and UV Sensitivity Assay—Hydroxyurea sensitivity of the AlcPinA and control strains was determined by spotting 1 μl of ∼5 spores/ml onto glycerol or glucose minimal medium plates containing graded concentrations of hydroxyurea of up to 10 μg/ml. Growth was compared 3 days after germination at 37 °C. UV sensitivity of the AlcPinA and control strains was compared by UV irradiating germlings 4 h post-germination in minimal medium plus dextrose or glycerol using a Stratalinker UV cross-linker (Stratagene) at various intensities. Following UV irradiation the ∼500 germlings/plate were plated on minimal medium plates containing either glucose or glycerol and 0.01% Triton X-100. Percent survival was determined after 4 days of growth at 32 °C. PINA Is Essential in Aspergillus nidulans—To address the in vivo function of PINA in A. nidulans, we attempted to disrupt the endogenous pinA gene by homologous recombination in the haploid fungus. A schematic representation of the disruption strategy is presented in Fig. 1A. Despite screening over 150 integrated strains by Southern analysis, we were unable to identify any strains in which the endogenous pinA gene was disrupted. Because A. nidulans normally grows in the haploid state the disruption of an essential gene would result in non-viable progeny, thus the inability to identify viable pinA disruptants is consistent with pinA being an essential gene. To confirm that pinA is essential in A. nidulans we disrupted the gene in a heterokaryon in a manner similar to that described for cmkA, cmkB, CaM, and cnaA (27Rasmussen C.D. Means R.L. Lu K.P. May G.S. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13767-13775Google Scholar, 33Joseph J.D. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38230-38238Google Scholar, 34Dayton J.S. Means A.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1511-1519Google Scholar, 35Rasmussen C. Garen C. Brining S. Kincaid R.L. Means R.L. Means A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3917-3924Google Scholar). As diagramed in Fig. 1B, heterokaryon strains can be generated by the disruption of a gene following DNA synthesis or by the fusion of the parental strain with a strain containing the targeted disruption. By this method, heterokaryon strains in which essential genes are disrupted are maintained by the presence of the selectable nutritional marker in the disrupted nucleus and the presence of the wild-type targeted allele in the parental nucleus. The heterokaryon is then propagated by transfer of multinucleate mycelia. When pinA-targeted transformants were maintained as heterokaryons, multiple strains were identified in which pinA was disrupted as indicated by Southern hybridization bands at ∼0.9 kbp (representing the wild-type pinA allele) and 3.0 kbp (representing the pinA-disrupted allele), three examples of which are presented in Fig. 1C. As represented in Fig. 1B the sporulation of a heterokaryon strain generates two populations of spores, one representing the maternal strain, which contains a wild-type allele of the targeted gene but no nutritional marker (in our case pyr4–/pinA+), whereas the second contains both the disrupted gene and the selectable nutritional marker (pyr4+/pinA–). Thus, if pinA is an essential gene, inoculation of the heterokaryon progeny in medium without uracil and uridine would yield no viable germlings, and in medium containing the required nutrients only the spores representing the maternal nuclei will germinate. When the pinA-disrupted heterokaryons were grown in the absence of uracil and uridine, <1% of the spores germinated. However, in the presence of uracil and uridine, ∼54% of the spores underwent multiple rounds of nuclear division and initiated polarized growth within 10 h, and the remaining spores germinated but arrested with a single nuclei and failed to initiate polarized growth (Fig. 1D). The absence of the disrupted pinA allele in the fungus isolated following growth in the presence of uracil and uridine was confirmed by Southern analysis (data not shown). Thus, similar to its homologues in both S. cerevisiae and C. albicans, pinA is an essential gene in A. nidulans. Reduction of PINA Levels Slows A. nidulans Growth—To generate a system in which we could evaluate the physiological roles of PINA in A. nidulans, we created a strain in which the endogenous pinA gene was placed under the control of the regulable alcA promoter. The homologous integration of the alcA promoter has proven useful for regulating the expression of numerous A. nidulans genes in a carbon source-dependent manner (26Waring R.B. May G.S. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 79: 119-130Google Scholar, 36Lu K.P. Rasmussen C.D. May G.S. Means A.R. Mol. Endo. 1992; 6: 365-374Google Scholar, 37McGoldrick C.S. Gruver C. May G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 577-587Google Scholar). When grown in dextrose as the sole carbon source transcription from the alcA promoter is actively repressed. This repression is relieved in the presence of glycerol, allowing low levels of transcriptional activity, and transcription from the alcA promoter is induced in the presence of glycerol plus threonine. A schematic diagram representing the homologous integration of pAlcPinA into the endogenous pinA locus is depicted in Fig. 2A. Following transformation we identified several strains by Southern analysis in which pAlcPinA had integrated into the pinA locus (data not shown). The multiple strains all displayed similar carbon source-dependent PINA expression, and a single strain was randomly chosen for analysis. The carbon source-dependent regulation of the AlcPinA strain in comparison to the nutritionally complemented control strain, generated by transformation of the parental GR5 strain with pAL5 vector containing no cDNA insert (Pal5) is demonstrated in Fig. 2B. When AlcPinA is grown in minimal medium plus dextrose PINA expression is reduced ∼50-fold in comparison to controls. In glycerol expression is reduced ∼3-fold. In glycerol plus threonine PINA expression is induced ∼3-fold. The Pal5 strain displayed no variation of PINA expression in the three different carbon sources. When germinated in the presence of dextrose the AlcPinA strain grows at a slower rate than that of the Pal5 control strain as determined by the increase in average number of nuclei per germling as a function of time (Fig. 2C). In contrast, in the presence of glycerol or glycerol plus threonine both strains grew at the same rate (Fig. 2C and data not shown). Using the data presented in Fig. 2C, the exponential rate of nuclear division of the AlcPinA strain grown in dextrose is calculated to be ∼95 min versus 75 min for the control. In glycerol, both strains have a doubling time of 125 min. Importantly, Fig. 2C clearly demonstrates that the growth delay due to PINA repression is not due to a lag in germination as the slope of the growth curve is decreased when plotted in a log format. Thus, although carbon source-mediated repression of PINA expression is not sufficient to mimic the effects of pinA disruption, the reduction of endogenous PINA levels to ∼2% of wild-type significantly decreases the rate of nuclear division. PINA Is Required for Normal G1 Progression—Because Pin1 has been suggested to play an important role in multiple phases of the cell cycle, we evaluated whether reduced PINA expression caused a specific delay in cell cycle progression in A. nidulans. Because Pin1 was initially identified as a negative regulator of NIMA function, we first analyzed whether reduced PINA levels altered S-phase and G2 progression. First we generated new strains of A. nidulans by crossing either the AlcPinA or the control strain with a strain containing a temperature-sensitive mutation in the G1 cyclin, nimG (31Dayton J.S. Sumi M. Nanthakumar N.N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3223-3230Google Scholar). When these new strains were arrested in G1 at the restrictive temperature and released into a permissive temperature, the timing of mitotic entry as indicated by chromosome mitotic index (Fig. 3A) or histone"

This inverting enzyme transfers glucose from UDP-glucose to the 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine bases of T4 phage DNA. From previous structural analyses we showed that Asp-100 and Asn-70 were, respectively, the catalytic base and the key residue for specific DNA recognition (Larivière, L., Gueguen-Chaignon, V., and Moréra, S. (2003) J. Mol. Biol. 330, 1077–1086). Here, we supply biochemical evidence supporting their essential roles in catalysis. We have also shown previously that BGT uses a base-flipping mechanism to access 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine (Larivière, L., and Moréra, S. (2002) J. Mol. Biol. 324, 483–490). Whether it is an active or a passive process remains unclear, as is the case for all DNA cleaving and modifying enzymes. Here, we report two crystal structures: (i) BGT in complex with a 13-mer DNA containing an A:G mismatch and (ii) BGT in a ternary complex with UDP and an oligonucleotide containing a single central G:C base pair. The binary structure reveals a specific complex with the flipped-out, mismatched adenine exposed to the active site. Unexpectedly, the other structure shows the non-productive binding of an intermediate flipped-out base.

The base-flipping mechanism has been widely studied and largely discussed in several reviews with the publication of the co-crystal structures of DNA methyltransferases, DNA base excision repair glycosylases, and endonucleases (1Chen X.

Rotating the sugar-phosphate backbone around the flipped-out target base (or abasic site) allows the deoxyribose and the base being carried along to enter into the enzyme's active site before the chemistry step is performed. Whether rotation is initiated by an active process in which the enzyme rotates the sugar-phosphate backbone or a passive one in which the enzyme binds to a spontaneously flipped-out base in a transient conformation remains unclear. An active mechanism such as “push-pull” (5Slupphaug G. Mol C.D. Kavli B. Arvai A.S. Krokan H.E. Tainer J.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), “pull-push” (6Wong I.

The T4 bacteriophage β-glucosyltransferase (BGT) 1The abbreviations used are: BGT, β-glucosyltransferase; HMC, hydroxymethyl cytosine; HMU, hydroxymethyl uracil; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; SMUG1, single-strand monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase. uses a base-flipping mechanism to glucosylate the 5-hydroxymethyl cytosines of T4 phage DNA. Indeed, a previous structure of BGT in the presence of UDP and a 13-mer DNA containing an abasic site at the target base revealed that the deoxyribose moiety was flipped-out to an extrahelical position in the active site cavity (11Larivière L. Moréra S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To obtain further information on the base-flipping mechanism, we determined the crystal structure of a binary complex, i.e. BGT in the presence of the same 13-mer oligonucleotide but with an adenine added to the abasic deoxyribose, leading to an A:G mispairing. As expected, the extrahelical mismatched adenine is located in the active site pocket. We also solved the structure of a ternary complex of BGT with UDP and a 13-mer DNA containing a single central C:G base pair. Surprisingly, the structure reveals a non-productive DNA complex. The structural analysis of both complexes indicates a passive role of BGT. These structures also bring new insight into catalytic aspects. The BGT-DNA complex completes our structural study. Indeed, the catalytic mechanism of BGT was outlined by x-ray structures of the enzyme in native forms (12Vrielink A. Rüger W. Driessen H.P.C. Freemont P.S.

Biol. 2002; 324: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Now, it is clear that the inverting BGT possesses a random substrate binding. BGT belongs to the GT-B fold superfamily of the glycosyltransferases, identified as two flexible domains separated by a deep central cleft where the binding substrates are UDP-glucose and the DNA for BGT (16Ünligil U. Rini J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 17Bourne Y. Henrissat B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). UDP-glucose binding induces a large conformational change that brings the two domains together. We have shown previously that BGT transfers the glucose through an in-line mechanism, with Asp-100 being the catalytic base that activates the attacking hydroxymethyl group of the flipped HMC (11Larivière L. Moréra S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 14Larivière L. Gueguen-Chaignon V. Moréra S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1077-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We can now provide kinetic validation of our structural results using synthetic oligonucleotides containing hydroxymethyl uracil (HMU) bases that are substrates for BGT and thus can be glucosylated (18.Kurzeck, J. (2002) Functional and Structural Research on the β-Glucosyltransferase of Bacteriophage T4. Ph.D. dissertation, Ruhr-Universität Bochum, Bochum, GermanyGoogle Scholar). We therefore investigated the role of two key residues as suggested by the x-ray structures. DNA Preparation—The sequence of the 13-mer DNA containing an A:G mismatch site is 5′-GATACTAAGATAG-3′/5′-CTATCTGAGTATC-3′. The sequence of the 13-mer DNA containing a single central C:G base pair is 5′-AAAAAAGTTTTTT-3′/5′-AAAAAACTTTTTT-3′. These oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG-Biotech and hybridized by mixing equal concentrations of 100 μm in purified water, heating to 95 °C (5 min), and cooling to room temperature overnight.

Molecular graphics images were generated using PyMOL (26DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis via PCR—The plasmid pBSK-BGT encoding the wild type BGT protein was used as a template to generate single mutations in the DNA sequence with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). This kit utilizes the double-stranded DNA vector with an insert of interest and a two-primer system to generate site-specific mutations. The sequence of the mutagenic oligonucleotide N70A is 5′-GTTAATTCTTCTATTGCCTTTTTTGGCGG-3′. The construction was sequenced (Génôme Express, Grenoble, France) to check the presence of the mutation of interest. The mutagenized plasmid, designated pBSK-BGT-N70A, carried DNA inserts encoding the mutated BGT protein and was used to transform BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen). The mutant was expressed and purified according to the same procedures as for the wild type protein. Kinetic Assays—The enzymatic activity was measured with a 13-mer DNA containing a single central HMU:G base pair as a substrate. The glucosylation of 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine was measured via the transfer of [14C]glucose. The incubation mixture (final volume of 20 μl at 30 °C) contained 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 25 mm MgCl2, 10–20 μm DNA, 150 μm UDP-Glc (Sigma), 15 μm [14C]UDP-glucose, and 0.05 μm wild type BGT or a D100A or N70A mutant. The reaction was stopped at different incubation times up to 3 h. Samples were spotted onto DE-81 filters. Following three washes with 0.5 m NaH2PO4, the filters were dried and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Structure of the BGT-A:G Mismatch DNA Complex—Details of the crystallographic data and structure refinement at 2.5-Å resolution are shown in Table I. A DNA duplex is bound to three monomers, namely molecule A, molecule B, and a crystal symmetric of molecule B (Fig. 1). A structural comparison of molecules A and B with an unligated protein (Protein Data Bank codes 1JEJ and 2BGT) and the UDP-glucose/UDP and UDP-DNA complexes (Protein Data Bank codes 1JG6 and 1M5R, respectively) shows that they are similar to the substrate-free forms. The root mean square deviations for all Cα atoms are 0.7 and 1.1 Å, respectively. In contrast to UDP-glucose binding, DNA binding has no effect on domain closure. The oligonucleotide is well defined in the electron density map, except for the terminal 1:26 base pair. One end of the DNA interacts with one side of molecule B, whereas the opposite end contacts the other side of the symmetric molecule, forming two nonspecific complexes (Fig. 1). Each end of the DNA lies mainly against the C-terminal domain for molecule B and against the N-terminal domain for the symmetric molecule (Fig. 1). The loop regions (14–18, 214–220, and 235–237) of the N- and C-terminal domains of molecule B establish Van der Waals contacts and polar interactions via Asn-14, Asn-215, Arg-217, and Arg-237 with the DNA backbone, the terminal 13:14 and 12:15 base pairs, and the bases from 16 to 19. Surprisingly, these loop regions contribute to a rather large protein-DNA interface of 1203 Å2. In contrast, the other complex buries an interface of 677 Å2, an area two times smaller than that observed in the specific complex (11Larivière L. Moréra S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) (calculated using the program ASA from A. Lesk, Cambridge, UK, and a 1.4-Å probe). The loop region 101–104 and helix α5 (140–150) of the N-terminal domain and only four residues (225, 226, 259, and 260) of the C-terminal domain make Van der Waals interactions with the DNA. The middle part of the DNA interacts with molecule A, making a specific binary complex (Fig. 1). The mismatched adenine A7 is well defined in the electron density map (Fig. 2A). As expected, it is flipped out of the DNA helix and penetrates into the active site pocket. As proposed, the pyrimidine wedged between Val-18 and Leu-103 makes hydrophobic contact with Asn-10, Pro-19, Glu-22, Thr-99, and Asp-100 (11Larivière L. Moréra S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The B-factor of 82 Å2 indicates mobility facilitated by a rotation of the sugar-phosphate backbone around the target base. The N-terminal domain only binds to the DNA (Fig. 3) and forms a large BGT-DNA interface of 1441 Å2 (calculated using the program ASA from A. Lesk, Cambridge, UK, and a 1.4 Å probe). This value, in the range of other protein-DNA interfaces (28Nadassy K. Wodak S.J. Janin J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1999-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), was higher in the ternary specific complex because of the contribution of the C-terminal domain (11Larivière L. Moréra S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The structural observations for base flipping in the binary complex are identical to those in the ternary complex. The DNA possesses the same large distortion around the flipped adenine that induces a bend of 40° (calculated with CURVES) (29Lavery R. Sklenar H. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1989; 6: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar) with a marked widening of the major groove. It also makes few identical hydrogen bonds with the protein groups from the N-terminal domain (Figs. 4, A and B). Notably, DNA interactions are mainly van der Waals contacts (Figs. 4, A and B). The loop 70–74 penetrates into the DNA duplex through the major groove. The side chain of Asn-70 occupies the space left by the flipped adenine, packs against the orphan guanine G20, and provides hydrogen bonds to both the guanine and the opposite strand backbone with the O4* sugar atom and an oxygen phosphate of base A8 (Fig. 2). Its OD1 atom makes a Watson-Crick base-pairing contact with both N1 and N2 of the guanine. Three other polar interactions are formed between BGT and the orphan guanine. The main chain carbonyl of Phe-71 binds to N1, and the guanidinium group of Arg-115 interacts with O6 and N7 (Fig. 2). These interactions, which are only possible in the absence of a base-pairing partner, are absolutely specific for guanine.

Replacing the guanine base with an adenine base abolishes BGT activity, and the mutant N70A gives the same result with an HMU:G DNA substrate.Fig. 3Ribbon representation of the DNA complexes with a flipped-out deoxyribose/adenosine.

Four inserted residues (Asn-70, Phe-72, Gly-73, and Gly-74) stabilize the distorted conformation of the DNA in the vicinity of the flipped adenine or abasic site through a series of van der Waals contacts (wavy lines).

Unexpectedly, BGT-UDP is bound at the end of the double-stranded DNA. The structure was determined at 1.8-Å resolution and refined to an R-factor of 18.3% (Rfree = 21.2%) with very good stereochemistry and a B-factor for both the protein and the DNA indicating a stable complex (Table I). Two identical ternary complexes occupy the asymmetric unit with an root mean square deviation value of 0.19 Å between all Cα atoms (Fig. 5). Because of UDP binding, BGT adopts the closed conformation that is found in all complexes with at least one bound UDP-glucose or UDP. The two DNA fragments are very well defined, with all of the bases being visible in the electron density map. They display a standard B-form, except at one end where the terminal base pair T13:A14 is completely disrupted with both bases in extrahelical conformations (Fig. 5). The extrahelical position of the terminal thymine brings the base to the entrance of the enzyme's active site (Fig. 2C). The pyrimidine ring and one phosphate oxygen are held in a compact fold by polar interactions with Ser-68 and Ser-192, respectively. The partner adenine A14 prolongs one strand of the other oligonucleotide in the asymmetric unit by stacking onto the adenine A1 (Fig. 5) and interacts with the side chain hydroxyl of Tyr-119 that extends the opposite strand by stacking onto T26 (Fig. 4). As observed in the specific complexes, Phe-72 and Gly-73 form an additional base pair by stacking on the successive base pair T12 and A15 (Fig. 2C), thus inserting the DNA duplex via the major groove. The DNA-BGT interface of 1600 Å2 requires the same protein regions. However, the loop 70–74 moves 2 Å toward the DNA helix, and the positions of the two partner terminal bases are completely different from those of the flipped-out adenine and the orphan guanine G20 (Fig. 2). Although the terminal thymine is extrahelical, it fails to bind properly in the active site pocket. This finding could be explained by the lack of interaction between its partner adenine and Asn-70. Rejection of the terminal adenine is fully consistent with the specificity of Asn-70 for guanine. The absence of constraints and the stabilization of Asn-70 on the DNA substrate leads to an intermediate flipped-out position of the target base, providing a non-productive complex. Strikingly, similar complexes have been reported for the uracil-DNA glycosylase SMUG1 (33Wibley J.E.A. Waters T.R. Haushalter K. Verdine G.L. Pearl L.H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1647-1659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Two crystal structures called jilted and poised complexes by the authors show SMUG1 bound at the end of the DNA substrate with the partner terminal bases in extrahelical conformations (33Wibley J.E.A. Waters T.R. Haushalter K. Verdine G.L. Pearl L.H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1647-1659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). An extrahelical base is located either in the active site pocket or close to it, but with non-productive binding. Just as for BGT, a protein loop inserts into the DNA duplex. Catalytic Mechanism—The structure of the specific BGT-DNA complex reveals through the flipped adenine that BGT does not present binding specificity for the target bases. This observation is in agreement with biochemical data showing that BGT can glucosylate HMU bases (18.Kurzeck, J. (2002) Functional and Structural Research on the β-Glucosyltransferase of Bacteriophage T4. Ph.D. dissertation, Ruhr-Universität Bochum, Bochum, GermanyGoogle Scholar). The structure also shows that BGT does not possess an ordered bi-bi mechanism. Each substrate can bind BGT randomly. Whereas the DNA binding site is independent of the C-terminal domain, UDP-glucose binding requires both domains. Indeed, the two domains form the glucose site. That is why, in contrast to DNA binding, UDP-glucose sugar donor binding leads to rigid body domain closure. Either BGT first binds DNA on its N-terminal domain only and then UDP-glucose brings the C-terminal domain with the loop 189–195 to form the complete active site of BGT, or BGT first binds UDP-glucose, leading to a complex pre-formed for DNA binding. It has been shown that UDP-glucose binding increases the affinity for DNA binding (18.Kurzeck, J. (2002) Functional and Structural Research on the β-Glucosyltransferase of Bacteriophage T4. Ph.D. dissertation, Ruhr-Universität Bochum, Bochum, GermanyGoogle Scholar). However, an extensive study, using the gel mobility technique, of wild type and mutant BGT affinity for oligonucleotides differing in sequence and length was unsuccessful and led to artifactual smearing and nonspecific complex formation. The reason for this failure appears obvious, considering our two structural examples of nonspecific DNA complexes. Similar results for mobility shift assays have been reported for HhaI methyltransferase (34Mi S. Alonso D. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 620-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Domain closure is a common feature among GT-B enzymes and appears to be compulsory for glucose transfer. In BGT, an additional conformational change occurs in loop 189–195, induced by the Asp-100-Arg-191 salt bridge between the two domains. This brings critical residues (Arg-191, Arg-195, and Ser-192) in contact with both the pyrophosphate moiety of UDP-glucose and the DNA backbone of the sugar acceptor. Loop 189–195 accounts for 10% of the total buried protein surface in the BGT-DNA interface in the specific ternary complex (11Larivière L. Moréra S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Ser-192 brings extra stabilization of the bent DNA in the vicinity of the flipped base. Mutating Asp-100 alters the architecture of the active site, as the loop does not undergo the expected conformational change (11Larivière L. Moréra S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Asp-100 is essential for complete formation of the catalytic site by positioning and maintaining the 189–195 loop in a suitable conformation. This loop constrains the UDP-glucose and the flipped HMC to the correct position for catalysis. In addition to its structural role, we showed from a co-crystal structure of D100A-UDP-glucose that Asp-100 was the catalytic base (14Larivière L. Gueguen-Chaignon V. Moréra S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1077-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Now, biochemical data validate the structural results, because the D100A mutant shows no detectable activity. Both the position and the orientation of the flipped mismatched adenine were conserved to model a 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine base that is in agreement with our previous model showing a geometry compatible with an SN2 direct displacement mechanism (11Larivière L. Moréra S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 14Larivière L. Gueguen-Chaignon V. Moréra S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1077-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Base-flipping Pathway and Mechanism—The flipped adenine rotates ∼127° from the major groove. This would be similar for an HMC base. The 5-glucosylhydroxymethyl group of an intrahelical cytosine points toward the major groove. If this base rotates backwards via the minor groove after glucosylation, the group is too bulky to cross the DNA helix without a steric clash. Thus, there is no doubt that the return pathway is through the major groove. Because the glucose transfer reaction is reversible (35Josse J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 1968-1976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the forward pathway is the same and appears to be the shortest. Because BGT penetrates into the DNA duplex via the same groove, the base-flipping step must precede the protein loop insertion step as proposed for UDG from a presteady-state study (6Wong I. Lundquist A.J. Bernards A.S. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19424-19432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because the inserted loop is responsible for all DNA contacts in the vicinity of the extrahelical base, base flipping must occur before the protein and DNA can interact. The structure of the non-productive binding complex shows an intermediate flipped-out base with only three hydrogen bonds on the DNA backbone at the very unstable end of the duplex. Thus, this structure and those of similar complexes in SMUG1 emphasize a passive process (33Wibley J.E.A. Waters T.R. Haushalter K. Verdine G.L. Pearl L.H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1647-1659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The passive mechanism is compatible with NMR measurements of imino proton exchange, indicating that the lifetime of an individual G:C base pair within a DNA duplex is in the 10-ms range (36Guéron M. Leroy J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 261: 383-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In view of the low turnover of BGT (2.3 s-1 (35Josse J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 1968-1976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an active role of the enzyme in accelerating the intrinsic rates of base pair opening is not compulsory. This finding is similar to what has been suggested for DNA methyltransferases (37Winkler F.K. Structure. 1994; 2: 79-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Moreover, the 19F spin relaxation data from the NMR study of the methyltransferase HhaI complexed to a DNA substrate with incorporated 19F nuclei are consistent with a passive role of the enzyme (38Klimasauskas S. Szyperski T. Serva S. Wüthrich K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). HMU:A base pairs are less stable than normal T:A base pairs (39Pasternack L.B. Bramham J. Mayol L. Galeone A. Jia X. Kearns D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2740-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The same is expected for HMC:G compared with C:G. BGT takes advantage of naturally unstable HMC:G base pairs that spontaneously open and invade the DNA duplex, preventing initial flipped-out intermediate bases from returning to the DNA helix. Thus, the starting point of base flipping comes from natural “breathing” of DNA that displays extrahelical bases. Then, BGT stabilizes the fully flipped state in the active site through the key residue Asn-70, which fills the space left by the everted base, specifically recognizes the guanine on the complementary strand, and simultaneously distorts the DNA that locks the flipped-out base for productive binding before catalysis. The undetectable glucose transfer between the N70A mutant and a 13-mer oligonucleotide with a central HMU:G base pair and between the wild type enzyme and a 13-mer oligonucleotide with a central HMU:A base pair confirm the specificity of Asn-70 and its essential role for catalysis. BGT is now the first example of an enzyme that clearly plays a passive role in the base-flipping process. We believe that such a mechanism will be established for other DNA-modifying enzymes that share common features with BGT.
