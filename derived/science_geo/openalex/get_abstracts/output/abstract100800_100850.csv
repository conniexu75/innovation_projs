https://openalex.org/W2065697164,"We describe a novel 30-kDa secretory protein, Acrp30 (adipocyte complement-related protein of 30 kDa), that is made exclusively in adipocytes and whose mRNA is induced over 100-fold during adipocyte differentiation. Acrp30 is structurally similar to complement factor C1q and to a hibernation-specific protein isolated from the plasma of Siberian chipmunks; it forms large homo-oligomers that undergo a series of post-translational modifications. Like adipsin, secretion of Acrp30 is enhanced by insulin, and Acrp30 is an abundant serum protein. Acrp30 may be a factor that participates in the delicately balanced system of energy homeostasis involving food intake and carbohydrate and lipid catabolism. Our experiments also further corroborate the existence of an insulin-regulated secretory pathway in adipocytes.

Our experiments also further corroborate the existence of an insulin-regulated secretory pathway in adipocytes. Insulin-induced glucose transport occurs in heart, striated muscle, and fat tissue. In adipocytes, glucose uptake increases 20- to 30-fold in the presence of insulin. Glucose transport is mediated by the sodium-independent facilitative glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT4, which, in response to insulin, translocate from an intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane(1Simpson I.A.

Nature. 1988; 333: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). GLUT4, which is expressed only in fat and skeletal and cardiac muscle, is the primary transporter involved in this process and is the predominant transporter expressed in these tissues(3de Herreros A.G.

Adipocytes are a principal storage depot for triglycerides and express a specific transport protein allowing them to import free fatty acids(8Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Adipocytes also secrete several proteins potentially important in homeostatic control of glucose and lipid metabolism. Adipsin, equivalent to Factor D of the alternative complement pathway(9Spiegelman B.M. Frank M. Green H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10083-10089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is synthesized exclusively in adipocytes, and its secretion is enhanced severalfold by insulin(10Kitagawa K. Rosen B.S. Spiegelman B.M. Lienhard G.E. Tanner L.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1014: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The function of adipsin in fat cell biology is not known, nor are the roles of complement factors C3 and B that are also secreted by adipocytes(11Flier J.S. Cook K.S. Usher P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1987; 237: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Tumor necrosis factor α, also secreted by adipocytes, is a key mediator of insulin resistance in animal models of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Tumor necrosis factor α directly interferes with the signaling of insulin through its receptor and consequently blocks biological actions of insulin including insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (reviewed in (12Hotamisligil G.S. Spiegelman B.M. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1271-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Adipocytes are the only cell type known to secrete the ob gene product(13Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffel M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar). In the absence of ob (ob-/ob- mice) or its presumed receptor, the db gene product (db-/db- mice) the mice overeat and become obese and diabetic(14Friedman J.M. Leibel R.L. Siegel D.S. Walsh J. Bahary N. Genomics. 1991; 11: 1054-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Here we describe another novel protein, Acrp30, 1The abbreviations used are: Acrp30adipocyte complement-related protein of 30 kDaEndo Hendoglycosidase HBS3bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberatekbkilobase(s)bpbase pair(s)PBSphosphate-buffered salinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. that is exclusively synthesized in adipose tissue and secreted into serum. Like adipsin, secretion of Acrp30 is enhanced severalfold by insulin. While we do not know the function of this protein, its sequence and structural resemblance to complement factor C1q is intriguing. Importantly, our experiments confirm the existence of an insulin-regulated secretory pathway in adipocytes. adipocyte complement-related protein of 30 kDa endoglycosidase H bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate kilobase(s) base pair(s) phosphate-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A full-length cDNA library templated by mRNA from 3T3-L1 adipocytes at day 8 of differentiation (15Baldini G. Hohl T. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5049-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) was screened with a digoxygenin-labeled cDNA fragment obtained from the random sequencing screen. Labeling, hybridization, and detection were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim). One of the positive clones obtained was subjected to automated sequencing on a Applied Biosystems 373-A Sequencer. The entire 1.3-kb insert was sequenced at least 2 independent times on one and once on the complementary strand. Sequence analysis was performed with the DNAstar package and showed an open reading frame of 741 bp encoding a protein of 28 kDa. The sequence has been submitted to GenBankÔ and has the accession number U37222. Homology searches were performed at NCBI using the BLAST network service, and alignments were performed with the Megalign program from DNAstar using the Clustal algorithm. Only the globular domain for the type X collagen was used for the alignment (residues 562-680). A peptide corresponding to the sequence, EDDVTTTEELAPALV (residues 18-32), was used to generate specific anti-Acrp30 antibodies in rabbits (multiple antigen peptide technology, Research Genetics). Isolation of mRNA from tissues and from 3T3-L1 cells at various stages of differentiation was as described in (15Baldini G. Hohl T. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5049-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), as was 32P labeling of DNA, agarose gel electrophoresis of mRNA, and its transfer to nylon membranes. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were starved for 30 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ICN) lacking cysteine and methionine and then labeled for 10 min in the same medium containing 0.5 mCi/ml Express Protein Labeling Reagent (1000 Ci/mmol) (DuPont NEN). The cells were then washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with unlabeled cysteine and methionine, and then fresh growth medium containing 300 μM cycloheximide was added. At the indicated time points, the medium was collected. Insoluble material from the medium was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 10 min); the supernatants were precleared with 50 μl of Protein A-Sepharose for 30 min at 4°C and then immunoprecipitated with 50 μl of affinity-purified anti-Acrp30 antibody for 2 h at 4°C. Immunoprecipitates were washed 4 times in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 60 mM octyl glucoside, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin). A 10-cm plate of day 8 3T3-L1 adipocytes was labeled overnight with [35S]methionine and cysteine as described above. The medium was collected and, by means of several spins in a Centricon 10 microconcentrator, the buffer was replaced with 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM KPi, pH 8.5. A stock solution of 200 mg/ml bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3, Pierce) in dimethyl sulfoxide was prepared fresh and added to the final concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 30 min on ice, and excess cross-linker was quenched by addition of 500 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0. Samples were diluted 1:1 with lysis buffer and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Acrp30 antibodies. Separation of proteins by SDS-PAGE, fluorography, immunoblotting, protein determinations, and densitometric scanning of the gels were performed as described previously(16Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Baldini G. Sargiacomo M. Corley-Mastick C. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In order to identify novel adipocyte-specific proteins, we have randomly sequenced portions of 1000 clones from a subtractive cDNA library enriched in mRNAs induced during adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts(15Baldini G. Hohl T. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5049-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis using one ~250-bp clone showed a marked induction during adipocyte differentiation, and thus a full-length cDNA was isolated and sequenced. The encoded protein, Acrp30, was novel; it contained 247 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 28 kDa. Acrp30 consists of a predicted amino-terminal signal sequence, followed by a stretch of 27 amino acids that does not show significant homology to any protein in the data base and then by 22 perfect Gly-X-Pro or Gly-X-X repeats (Fig. 1, A and B). The carboxyl-terminal globular domain exhibits striking homology to a number of proteins, such as the globular domains of type VIII and type X collagens(17Reichenberger E. Beier F. Lu Valle P. Olsen B.R. von der Mark K. Bertling W.M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the subunits of complement factor C1q (18Reid K.B. Gagnon J. Frampton J. Biochem. J. 1982; 203: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and a protein found in the serum of hibernating animals during the summer months(19Kondo N. Kondo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 473-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Structurally, albeit not at the primary sequence level, the protein resembles the lung surfactant protein (20Floros J. Steinbrink R. Jacobs K. Phelps D. Kriz R. Recny M. Sultzman L. Jones S. Taeusch H.W. Frank H.A. Fritsch E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9029-9033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the hepatocyte mannan-binding protein(21Drickamer K. Dordal M.S. Reynolds L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6878-6887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), both of which have collagen-like domains and globular domains of similar size. Northern blot analysis shows that Acrp30 is expressed exclusively in adipocytes. It is not expressed in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and is induced over 100-fold during adipocyte differentiation. Induction occurs between days 2 and 4, at the same time as other adipocyte- specific proteins such as GLUT4 (22Charron M.J. Brosius F.C. Alper S.L. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2535-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) and Rab3D (15Baldini G. Hohl T. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5049-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). These results were confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). The amount of Acrp30 mRNA may decline somewhat from Day 6 to Day 8 (Fig. 1C), but this drop is not reproducible in other experiments. In any case, we have not studied the accumulation or stability of Acrp30 mRNA after Day 8. An antibody raised against a peptide corresponding to the unique amino-terminal domain of Acrp30 recognized a 3T3-L1 adipocyte protein of approximately 28 kDa (not shown). Acrp30 contains one potential N-glycosylation site, within the collagen domain, but apparently is not glycosylated; Endo H treatment did not cause a shift in molecular mass of Acrp30 at any time during a metabolic pulse-chase experiment (not shown). Acrp30 does become modified post-translationally, since, after 20 min of chase, there was a small but reproducible reduction in gel mobility. This most likely represents hydroxylation of collagen domain proline residues in the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi compartments, by analogy to a similar modification in the structurally related mannan-binding protein(23Colley K.J. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10290-10295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes unstimulated by insulin, 50% of newly made Acrp30 is secreted into the medium at 2.5 to 3 h of chase as judged by densitometric scanning of the immunoprecipitates of intracellular and extracellular 35S-labeled Acrp30. Indeed, Acrp30 can be detected by Western blotting in normal mouse serum. A protein of the identical molecular weight can be detected by Western blot analysis of 3T3-L1 adipocytes (not shown). The anti-peptide antibody is specific for the mouse homologue, as it does not cross-react with bovine, human, or rabbit serum (Fig. 2). To examine effects of insulin on Acrp30 secretion, we monitored the discrete population of newly made protein generated in a short pulse with labeled amino acids followed by inhibition of further protein synthesis by cycloheximide. This offers increased sensitivity compared to examining secretion of the entire cellular complement of Acrp30, particularly in light of the very long t1/2 for secretion of Acrp30. Fig. 3 shows that, during the first 60 min of chase, insulin causes a 4-fold increase in secretion of newly made Acrp30. After 60 min, the rates of Acrp30 secretion are the same in unstimulated and insulin-stimulated cells. Similarly, insulin causes a 4-fold increase in adipsin secretion during the first 30 min of chase, but, afterwards, the rate of adipsin secretion is the same in control and insulin-treated cells (Fig. 3 and (10Kitagawa K. Rosen B.S. Spiegelman B.M. Lienhard G.E. Tanner L.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1014: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)). The ability of insulin to abolish the lag in adipsin secretion has been seen in several separate experiments. We hypothesize that a fraction of newly made adipsin and Acrp30 are sorted, probably in the trans-Golgi reticulum, into regulated secretory vesicles whose exocytosis is induced (in an unknown manner) by insulin, whereas the balance is sorted into vesicles that are constitutively exocytosed. Partial sorting of protein hormones into regulated secretory vesicles has been seen in other types of cultured cells(24Moore H.-P.H. Gumbiner B. Kelly R.B. Nature. 1983; 302: 434-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 25Sambanis A. Stephanopoulos G. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Biotech. Bioeng. 1990; 35: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We do not know how insulin causes an increase in protein secretion; insulin could cause a more efficient overall processing of secretory proteins in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We are currently isolating other adipocyte-specific secretory proteins to study this process in detail. Complement factor C1q consists of three related polypeptides that form heterotrimeric subunits containing a three-stranded collagen “tail” and three globular “heads”; six of these subunits generate an 18-mer complex often referred to as a “bouquet of flowers” (reviewed in (26Thiel S. Reid K.B. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar)). The experiments in Fig. 4 show that Acrp30 has a similar oligomeric structure, but is composed of a single type of polypeptide chain. When analyzed by velocity gradient sedimentation analysis, Acrp30 in blood serum migrates as two species of apparent molecular masses of 90 kDa and 300 kDa (Fig. 4C). Disregarding the presumably nonglobular shape of the complex that could lead to a slight distortion of the molecular weight determination, the former is probably a trimer and the latter could be a nonamer or dodecamer. Isoelectric focusing followed by SDS-PAGE of 35S-Acrp30 secreted by 3T3-L1 adipocytes reveals only a single polypeptide (not shown), suggesting that Acrp30 forms homo-oligomeric structures. Chemical cross-linking using low concentrations of BS3 of 35S medium from 3T3-L1 adipocytes, followed by specific immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, shows mainly dimers and trimers (lanes 1- 5, Fig. 4A). Larger concentrations of the BS3 cross-linking agent generated Acrp30 proteins that migrated as hexamers as well as yet larger species. As extensively cross-linked proteins migrate aberrantly upon SDS-PAGE, it is difficult to determine the exact size of the high molecular mass form indicated by an asterisk. It could represent either a nonamer or a dodecameric structure. Together, panels A and C of Fig. 4 show that Acrp30 forms homotrimers that interact together to generate nonamers or dodecamers. Nonreducing SDS-PAGE reveals that two of the subunits in a trimer are disulfide-bonded together (Fig. 4B), similar to other proteins containing a collagen domain, including the macrophage scavenger receptor(27Resnick D. Freedman N.J. Xu S. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3538-3545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Besides being a homo-oligomer, Acrp30 differs from C1q in containing an uninterrupted stretch of 22 perfect Gly-X-X repeats; this suggests that Acrp30 has a straight collagen stalk as opposed to the characteristic kinked collagen domain in C1q caused by imperfect Gly-X-X repeats in two of the three subunits (26Thiel S. Reid K.B. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We do not yet know the function of Acrp30. However, its expression exclusively in adipocytes, its enhanced secretion by insulin, and its presence in normal serum, suggests that it is, like the ob protein, involved in the control of the nutritional status of the organism. Acrp30 is a relatively abundant serum protein, accounting for up to 0.05% of total serum protein as judged by quantitative Western blotting using recombinant Acrp30 as a standard (data not shown). Even though we have no evidence at this stage, we cannot exclude the possibility that Acrp30, like C3 complement released by adipocytes (28Cianflone K. Roncari D.A. Maslowska M. Baldo A. Forden J. Sniderman A.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9489-9495Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), is converted proteolytically to a bioactive molecule. Our experiments also corroborate the existence of a regulated secretory pathway in adipocytes. We do not yet know whether adipsin and/or Acrp30 are in the same intracellular vesicles that contain GLUT4 and that fuse with the plasma membrane in response to insulin, or whether they are in different types of vesicles. Adipocytes express two members of the Rab3 family, Rab3A and Rab3D(29Baldini G. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4284-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); these are found in vesicles of different density. Rab3s are small GTP-binding proteins involved in regulated exocytic events. Except for adipocytes, Rab3A is found only in neuronal and neuroendocrine cells; in neurons, Rab3A is localized to synaptic vesicles and is important for their targeting to the plasma membrane(30Geppert M. Bolshakov V.Y. Siegelbaum S.A. Takei K. De Camilli P. Hammer R.E. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). An attractive hypothesis under test is that, in adipocytes, Rab3A is localized to vesicles containing Acrp30 and/or adipsin, and that possibly Rab3D mediates insulin-triggered exocytosis of vesicles containing GLUT4. In any case, the mechanism of signal transduction from the insulin receptor to regulated exocytosis of intracellular vesicles remains an important unsolved problem. We thank Drs. Janice Chin, Andy Swick, Mike Gibbs, and Walt Soeller for their help at several stages of this project, Drs. Monty Krieger and Barbara Kahn for helpful discussions, Dr. Bruce Spiegelman for anti-adipsin antibodies and Dr. Peter Murray for the hsp70 cDNA."
https://openalex.org/W2061234826,"Ras-induced malignant transformation requires Ras farnesylation, a lipid posttranslational modification catalyzed by farnesyltransferase (FTase). Inhibitors of this enzyme have been shown to block Ras-dependent transformation, but the mechanism by which this occurs remains largely unknown. We have designed FTI-276, a peptide mimetic of the COOH-terminal Cys-Val-Ile-Met of K-Ras4B that inhibited potently FTase in vitro (IC50 = 500 pM) and was highly selective for FTase over geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I) (IC50 = 50 nM). FTI-277, the methyl ester derivative of FTI-276, was extremely potent (IC50 = 100 nM) at inhibiting H-Ras, but not the geranylgeranylated Rap1A processing in whole cells. Treatment of H-Ras oncogene-transformed NIH 3T3 cells with FTI-277 blocked recruitment to the plasma membrane and subsequent activation of the serine/threonine kinase c-Raf-1 in cells transformed by farnesylated Ras (H-RasF), but not geranylgeranylated, Ras (H-RasGG). FTI-277 induced accumulation of cytoplasmic non-farnesylated H-Ras that was able to bind Raf and form cytoplasmic Ras/Raf complexes in which Raf kinase was not activated. Furthermore, FTI-277 blocked constitutive activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in H-RasF, but not H-RasGG, or Raf-transformed cells. FTI-277 also inhibited oncogenic K-Ras4B processing and constitutive activation of MAPK, but the concentrations required were 100-fold higher than those needed for H-Ras inhibition. The results demonstrate that FTI-277 blocks Ras oncogenic signaling by accumulating inactive Ras/Raf complexes in the cytoplasm, hence preventing constitutive activation of the MAPK cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1968838214,"The role of enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase (E.C. 1.3.1.9), the product of the fabI gene, was investigated in the type II, dissociated, fatty acid synthase system of Escherichia coli. All of the proteins required to catalyze one cycle of fatty acid synthesis from acetyl-CoA plus malonyl-CoA to butyryl-ACP in vitro were purified. These proteins were malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase (fabD), β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III (fabH), β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (fabG), β-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP dehydrase (fabA), and enoyl-ACP reductase (fabI). Unlike the other enzymes in the cycle, FabA did not efficiently convert its substrate β-hydroxybutyryl-ACP to crotonyl-ACP, but rather the equilibrium favored formation of β-hydroxybutyryl-ACP over crotonyl-ACP by a ratio of 9:1. The amount of butyryl-ACP formed depended on the amount of FabI protein added to the assay. Extracts from fabI(Ts) mutants accumulated β-hydroxybutyryl-ACP, and the addition of FabI protein to the fabI(Ts) extract restored both butyryl-ACP and long-chain acyl-ACP synthesis. FabI was verified to be the only enoyl-ACP reductase required for the synthesis of fatty acids by demonstrating that purified FabI was required for the elongation of both long-chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. These results were corroborated by analysis of the intracellular ACP pool composition in fabI(Ts) mutants that showed β-hydroxybutyryl-ACP and crotonyl-ACP accumulated at the nonpermissive temperature in the same ratio found in the fabI(Ts) extracts and in the in vitro reconstruction experiments that lacked FabI. We conclude that FabI is the only enoyl-ACP reductase involved in fatty acid synthesis in E. coli and that the activity of this enzyme plays a determinant role in completing cycles of fatty acid biosynthesis.

We conclude that FabI is the only enoyl-ACP reductase involved in fatty acid synthesis in E. coli and that the activity of this enzyme plays a determinant role in completing cycles of fatty acid biosynthesis. The fatty acid synthase system of Escherichia coli is the paradigm for the type II or dissociated fatty acid synthase systems (for review see (1Magnuson K. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 522-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Each of the individual enzymes are encoded by distinct genes, and the same chemical reaction is often catalyzed by multiple isozymes. There are four basic reactions that constitute a single round of elongation (Fig. 1). The first step is condensation of malonyl-ACP 1The abbreviations used are: ACPacyl carrier proteinacyl-ACPacyl-acyl carrier protein. with either acetyl-CoA to initiate fatty acid synthesis or the growing acyl chain to continue cycles of elongation. The first cycle of elongation is initiated by the condensation of acetyl-CoA with malonyl-ACP catalyzed by β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III (FabH), the product of the fabH gene. Subsequent cycles of elongation are catalyzed by condensing enzyme I (FabB) or II (FabF). Recently, the existence of a fourth condensing enzyme was proposed(2Siggaard-Andersen M. Wissenbach M. Chuck J. Svendsen I. Olsen J.G. von Wettstein-Knowles P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11027-11031Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the map position and sequence of this putative new enzyme are the same as that of the fabF gene(3Magnuson K. Carey M.R. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3593-3595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); therefore there is little concrete evidence for the presence of a fourth condensing enzyme. The β-ketoacyl-ACP is reduced by a NADPH-dependent β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (FabG). Only a single enzyme is known to be responsible for this step, although the existence of other isozymes cannot be ruled out. There are two β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydrases (FabA and FabZ) capable of forming trans-2-enoyl-ACP. The product of the fabA gene is specifically involved in the introduction of a cis-double bond into the growing acyl chain at the β-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP step. The spectrum of reactions catalyzed by the FabZ dehydrase is unknown, but the fact that mutations in the fabZ gene were isolated based on their ability to suppress the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype in lpxA2(Ts) (β-hydroxymyristoyl-ACP:UDP-N-acetylglucosamine acyltransferase) mutants indicates that it plays an important role in long-chain saturated fatty acid formation(4Mohan S.

The last reaction in each elongation cycle is catalyzed by enoyl-ACP reductase (FabI). E. coli is thought to possess two enoyl-ACP reductases, one NADH-dependent and the other NADPH-dependent(5Weeks G. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1180-1189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that more than one isozyme catalyzes this step of fatty acid biosynthesis. acyl carrier protein acyl-acyl carrier protein. The gene encoding the NADH-dependent enoyl-ACP reductase (fabI) was discovered as an outgrowth of research on the mechanism of action of diazaborines, a class of heterocyclic antibiotics. Biosynthesis of fatty acids and phospholipids is inhibited when E. coli or Salmonella typhimurium are treated with diazaborines, and resistance to these antibiotics is associated with an allelic form of the envM gene product (6Turnowsky F. Fuchs K. Jeschek C. Högenauer G. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6555-6565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The envM gene was first identified as a temperature-sensitive mutation with an osmotically-repairable membrane defect(7Egan A.F. Russell R.R.B. Genet. Res. 1973; 21: 3603-3611Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because the EnvM protein, purified from an overproducing strain, possesses NADH-dependent enoyl-ACP reductase activity and binds radiolabeled diazaborine, the gene was renamed fabI(8Bergler H. Wallner P. Ebeling A. Leitinger B. Fuchsbichler S. Aschauer H. Kollenz G. Högenauer G. Turnowsky F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5493-5496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fabI (envM) gene has been sequenced, and the diazaborine resistance is associated with a point mutation in this locus(9Bergler H. Högenauer G. Turnowsky F. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2093-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Similarly, the product of the fabI analog in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the inhA gene product, is the target for the antibiotics isoniazid and ethionamide, and a single point mutation in the inhA gene confers resistance to both antibiotics in M. tuberculosis(10Banerjee A.

InhA has recently been purified, crystallized, and shown to be an NADH-dependent enoyl-ACP reductase(11Dessen A. Quémard A. Blanchard J.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Science. 1995; 267: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The focus of this study is to determine the number of enoyl-ACP reductase enzymes in E. coli and to define the role of enoyl-ACP reductase in regulating cycles of fatty acid elongation. β-[3-3H]Alanine (specific activity, 56 Ci/mmol) and En3Hance were purchased from DuPont NEN. [2-14C]Malonyl-CoA (specific activity, 57 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals Inc. Cerulenin, tetradecanoic acid, and ACP were purchased from Sigma.

Protein amounts were assayed by the Bradford method(14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar), and purity was estimated by electrophoresis in a 2.5 M urea, 15% acrylamide gel(15Post-Beittenmiller D. Jaworski J.G. Ohlrogge J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1858-1865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. All other chemicals were of reagent grade or better. Strain RJH13 (panD fabI(Ts)) (16Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol.

Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 431Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.4% glucose and 0.5 μM β-[3H]alanine (specific activity, 56 Ci/mmol), at which time an aliquot of the culture was removed and placed into a flask prewarmed to 42°C. Samples (0.5 ml) were taken after 10 min of incubation, and cerulenin (1 mg/ml) was added to the remaining portions and incubated for a further 10 min. Samples were immediately pelleted by centrifugation in a microfuge (15,000 rpm, 4°C, 3 min) and then lysed by a procedure using successive treatments with sucrose, lysozyme, EDTA, and Triton X-100(18Clewell D.B. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 62: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). Products were analyzed by conformationally sensitive electrophoresis in 13% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5 M urea (15Post-Beittenmiller D. Jaworski J.G. Ohlrogge J.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1982; 257: 10759-10765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the bands were visualized by fluorography. Strain SJ16 (panD) (20Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 148: 926-932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was grown at 37°C to a density of 5 × 108 cells/ml, and the culture was split; one half was treated with 1 mg/ml cerulenin for 10 min, and the other half was harvested as a control. The crude fatty acid synthase preparation and the fabI(Ts) extract were obtained as described(21Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7927-7931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a 500-ml culture of either E. coli strain UB1005 or RJH13 (fabI(Ts)) was grown to late log phase in LB medium, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer (0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA) and disrupted by passage through a French pressure cell at 18,000 psi. The lysate was centrifuged in a JA-20 rotor at 20,000 rpm at 4°C for 1 h to remove cell debris, and protein in the 45-80% ammonium sulfate cut of the supernatant was collected. This pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of lysis buffer and dialyzed overnight at 4°C against 1 liter of lysis buffer. Protein was determined by the Bradford method(14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). The genes were amplified from genomic DNA obtained from strain UB1005. Primers created novel restriction sites for NdeI at the N-terminal methionine and BamHI downstream of the stop codon. Polymerase chain reaction was performed with Taq DNA polymerase (Promega), and the fragments were ligated into the TA cloning vector pCRII (Invitrogen) and transformed into E. coli OneShot cells (Invitrogen). Following overnight growth, plasmid was isolated and digested with NdeI and BamHI, and the appropriate fragments were isolated by GeneClean (Bio 101, Inc.) and ligated into NdeI and BamHI-digested pET-15b (Novagen). These mixtures were used to transform strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) to ampicillin resistance, and resultant colonies were screened for their ability to overexpress proteins of the correct size following isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside induction. One such clone was chosen for each gene and grown in 100 ml of M9 medium (17Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 431Google Scholar) supplemented with 1% casamino acids (Difco), 0.4% glucose, and 1 mM MgCl2 to a density of approximately 5 × 108 cells/ml. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 1 mM, and incubation was continued for a further 3 h at 37°C. Cells were collected by centrifugation in a JA-20 rotor (8,000 rpm, 4°C, 10 min), and stored at −20°C overnight. Lysis was affected according to (22Petty K.J. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Strugh K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 10.11.8-10.11.22Google Scholar), with the addition of lysozyme to 0.1 mg/ml after resuspension. Soluble protein was applied to a Ni2+-agarose column (QIAGEN) and washed with 40 mM imidazole in a metal-chelation affinity chromatography buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol). His-tagged proteins were eluted with 200 mM imidazole in the same buffer, and the purified proteins were stored at −20°C. To assay for reduction of short chain enoyl-ACPs, reactions (40 μl) contained 50 μM acetyl CoA, 25 μM ACP, 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μM NADH, 100 μM NADPH, 0.1 M LiCl, 30 μg of fatty acid synthase extract from either strain UB1005 or RJH13 (fabI(Ts)) and, when added, 1 μg of purified His-tag FabI. Cerulenin, when present, was at 100 μM. Reactions were preincubated for 5 min at room temperature to allow the cerulenin to inactivate the FabB and FabF condensing enzymes and then initiated by the addition of 25 μM [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (specific activity, 57 Ci/mmol). After incubation at 37°C for 10 min, reactions were stopped by placing the tubes in an ice slurry. Gel loading buffer (10 μl) was then added, and 40 μl of the incubation mixture was fractionated by conformationally sensitive gel electrophoresis in 13% acrylamide gels containing 0.5 M urea(15Post-Beittenmiller D. Jaworski J.G. Ohlrogge J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1858-1865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was performed at 25°C, 32 mA/gel. Fixed gels were soaked in En3 Hance (DuPont NEN) and then subjected to fluorography at −80°C. To investigate the reduction of long-chain saturated and unsaturated acyl-ACPs, reactions were performed as above, except that the acetyl-CoA was replaced with tetradecanoyl-ACP or cis-7-tetradecenoyl-ACP, respectively. Reactions were performed with and without 100 μM NADH and 1 μg of His-tag FabI. The products were analyzed by conformationally sensitive gel electrophoresis in 2.5 M urea, 15% acrylamide gels to separate the long-chain products. A single cycle of fatty acid elongation was reconstructed in vitro by sequentially adding the individual enzymes that catalyze each reaction in the cycle. The reaction mix included, in a volume of 40 μl, 50 μM ACP, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 M Na2PO4, pH 7.0, 100 μM NADH, 100 μM NADPH, 100 μM acetyl-CoA, and 50 μM [14C]malonyl-CoA (specific activity, 57 mCi/mmol). Purified, His-tagged enzymes were added at 0.2-0.6 μg/assay with FabD being added last to initiate the reaction. Reactions were incubated at 37°C for 20 min and then stopped by placing into an ice slush. Analysis of the ACP thioesters was performed by conformationally sensitive gel electrophoresis of the products in 13% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 M urea, and the bands were visualized by fluorography. We purified the five enzymes required to carry out a single cycle of fatty acid synthesis to investigate the role of each enzyme in completing the cycle. Each gene encoding a component of the cycle was cloned into the pET-15b vector, and the proteins were purified by affinity chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In all cases, active enzymes were obtained in a highly purified state (Fig. 2). Acyl-ACPs (14:0 and 14:1Δ7) were prepared using the acyl-ACP synthetase method (12Rock C.O. Garwin J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7123-7128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were pure (>95%) as judged by conformationally sensitive gel electrophoresis (not shown). A single round of fatty acid synthesis was reconstructed in vitro by the sequential addition of purified components to positively identify the intermediates formed by each of the enzymes in the cycle and to verify the role of FabI in completing rounds of elongation (Fig. 3). The addition of malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase plus [2-14C]malonyl-CoA led to the formation of [14C]malonyl-ACP. The addition of β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III (FabH) resulted in the conversion of malonyl-ACP to β-ketobutyryl-ACP. The gel electrophoresis technique underestimated the actual amount of β-ketobutyryl-ACP formed because the high pH, temperature, and urea used to achieve the separation led to degradation and low recovery of the unstable β-ketoesters. The addition of β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (FabG) to the mixture (which also contained NADPH) resulted in the complete conversion of the malonyl-ACP to β-hydroxybutyryl-ACP. Significantly, the addition of β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydrase (FabA) to the mixture resulted in only an 8% conversion of β-hydroxybutyryl-ACP to crotonyl-ACP. Increasing the amount of FabA enzyme in the assay mixture did not lead to increased formation of crotonyl-ACP (Fig. 3). The ratio of β-hydroxybutyryl-ACP and crotonyl-ACP products was determined in this and several other experiments by densitometric analysis of the fluorograph. Crotonyl-ACP accounted for 8-11% of the total density in the β-hydroxybutyryl-ACP plus crotonyl-ACP bands and was independent of the amount of FabA enzyme added to the assay or the length of the incubation. These data indicated that the FabA reaction rapidly reached an equilibrium that favored β-hydroxybutyryl-ACP. The addition of FabI to the reaction mixture yielded butyryl-ACP, and the extent of butyryl-ACP formation increased as the amount of FabI in the assay increased. These data show that the activity of FabI is responsible for pulling cycles of fatty acid elongation. Extracts isolated from wild-type and fabI(Ts) defective strains were used to examine in vitro the role of the FabI protein in fatty acid elongation (Fig. 4). As previously reported(20Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 148: 926-932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), extracts from the wild-type strain incorporated [14C]malonyl-CoA into butyryl-ACP and long-chain acyl-ACP. The addition of cerulenin blocked the activity of FabB and FabF but not FabH, leading to the accumulation of butyryl-ACP. Extracts from strain RJH13 (fabI(Ts)) were unable to form either butyryl-ACP or long-chain acyl-ACP either in the presence or the absence of cerulenin. Two intermediates accumulated in these reactions. The major intermediate comigrated with β-hydroxybutyryl-ACP, and the minor species comigrated with crotonyl-ACP. Densiometric analysis of the fluorograph showed that the crotonyl-ACP band comprised 10% of the total density of the β-hydroxybutyryl-ACP plus crotonyl-ACP bands. The ratio of these two products formed in the crude cell extract was virtually identical to the ratio of products observed in the purified system in the absence of FabI (Fig. 3). The addition of purified FabI protein to the extract from the fabI(Ts) strain restored the ability of the extract to synthesize both long-chain acyl-ACP and butyryl-ACP in the presence of cerulenin. These data show that FabI is essential for the first cycle of fatty acid elongation and is the only component missing from the extracts of strain RJH13 (fabI(Ts)). The data suggested that FabI participated in subsequent elongation cycles, but the possibility remained that another enoyl-ACP reductase (the NADPH-dependent enzyme predicted by Weeks and Wakil (5Weeks G. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1180-1189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) was present in the extracts and contributed to the elongation of saturated or unsaturated fatty acids to produce long-chain acyl-ACP (Fig. 4). To verify that FabI was capable of participating in the elongation of these long-chain species and to rule out the presence of another enzyme, we examined the elongation of 14:0-ACP 2These constructions should be read as follows: the number of carbon atoms:the number of double bonds and the position of the double bond. and 14:1Δ7-ACP (Fig. 5). Extracts from strain RJH13 (fabI(Ts)) were unable to convert either 14:0-ACP or 14:1Δ7-ACP to 16:0-ACP or 16:1Δ9-ACP, respectively. These extracts contained FabB (or FabF) that catalyzed the condensation of [14C]malonyl-CoA with the acyl-ACP, FabG, and FabZ (or FabA) that carried out the NADPH-dependent reduction of the β-ketoacyl-ACPs and the dehydration of β-hydroxyacyl-ACP to the trans-2-enoyl-ACP intermediate. Two intermediates accumulated in each experiment that corresponded in electrophoretic mobility to the β-hydroxyacyl and trans-2-enoyl intermediates in the elongation cycles. Like the electrophoretic relationship between β-hydroxybutyryl-ACP and crotonyl-ACP observed in Fig. 3, the long-chain β-hydroxyacyl intermediates migrated more slowly than the corresponding acyl-ACP, and the long-chain trans-2-enoyl intermediates migrated slightly more quickly than the corresponding acyl-ACP. These relative mobilities were the same as reported previously for long-chain β-hydroxyacyl and trans-2-enoyl acyl-ACP(4Mohan S. Kelly T.M. Eveland S.S. Raetz C.R.H. Anderson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32896-32903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ratio of the long-chain β-hydroxyacyl-ACP to trans-2-enoyl-ACP was quantitated by densitometry for each experiment (Fig. 5). The average ratio of these two intermediates was 1:1 indicating that the equilibrium for the dehydrase operating on the long-chain β-hydroxyacyl-ACPs was more favorable for the formation of the trans-2-enoyl-ACP product than was observed with the short-chain intermediates (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). The addition of purified FabI to these extracts restored the ability of the extracts to elongate 14:0-ACP to 16:0-ACP and 14:1Δ7-ACP to 16:1Δ9-ACP. NADH was required in addition to FabI for the formation of acyl-ACP. These data rule out the existence of a NADPH-dependent enoyl-ACP reductase participating in the elongation of either long-chain saturated or unsaturated fatty acids. These experiments also verified that FabI is capable of reducing the trans-2 double bond in both long-chain saturated and unsaturated enoyl-ACP. Previously, we concluded from the analysis of fatty acid synthesis and long-chain acyl-ACP and malonyl-CoA accumulation in fabI(Ts) mutants that FabI was required for the first elongation cycle that forms butyryl-ACP(16Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15531-15538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We also noted a change in the composition of the short-chain ACP thioester pool, and we examined this pool more closely to determine if our in vitro experiments with extracts from fabI(Ts) mutants and purified components correlated with the in vivo results. Strain RJH13 (panD2 fabI(Ts)) was labeled with β-[3H]alanine to uniformly label the ACP pool, and the composition of this pool was analyzed by conformationally sensitive gel electrophoresis at both the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures using the wild-type strain SJ16 for comparison (Fig. 6). To facilitate the analysis, a portion of each culture was incubated with cerulenin, an irreversible inhibitor of the FabB and FabF condensing enzymes. At the permissive temperature (30°C), the major ACP species in strain RJH13 co-migrated with acetyl-ACP with significant amounts of malonyl-ACP also detected. This pattern of ACP intermediates was essentially the same as in the control strain SJ16. The addition of cerulenin to strain RJH13 grown at 30°C led to the accumulation of butyryl-ACP, which is the same major change in the pool composition found in the wild-type control strain SJ16. In contrast, treatment of strain RJH13 with cerulenin after a temperature shift to 42°C did not lead to the accumulation of butyryl-ACP indicating that the first cycle of fatty acid biosynthesis was blocked in the fabI(Ts) mutants. Shifting strain RJH13 to the nonpermissive temperature (42°C) lead to a significant change in the ACP pool composition. Acetyl-ACP essentially disappeared, malonyl-ACP accumulated, and a new species migrating slightly more quickly than ACP appeared. We also observed the appearance of a new minor species that migrated just ahead of butyryl-ACP. The migration positions of these two ACP intermediates in vivo corresponded to the migration positions of β-hydroxybutyryl-ACP and crotonyl-ACP (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). One important conclusion from these experiments was that the ACP pool composition of fabI(Ts) mutants at the nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 6) was essentially identical to the distribution of products observed in the in vitro system with either purified components (Fig. 3) or extracts from fabI(Ts) mutants (Fig. 4). Densitometric analysis of the fluorograph showed that the band with the migration position of crotonyl-ACP was 13% of the total density in the β-hydroxybutyryl-ACP plus crotonyl-ACP bands. Thus, our in vitro reconstitution experiments accurately reflect the properties of the fatty acid synthase in vivo. Our results point to enoyl-ACP reductase (the fabI gene product) as a determinant factor in completing rounds of fatty acid elongation (Fig. 1). The reactions catalyzed by FabH, FabG, and FabI all result in the extensive conversion to the next intermediate in the cycle as depicted by the thickness of the arrows in Fig. 1. The amount of butyryl-ACP formed is dependent on the amount of FabI protein added due to the dehydration reaction reaching a rapid equilibrium that favors the accumulation of β-hydroxybutyryl-ACP over crotonyl-ACP by a ratio of 9:1. These data indicate that increasing the rate of initiation of a cycle of fatty acid elongation by a factor of 10 would only double the amount of enoyl-ACP product produced by FabA. Although it is not clear whether FabA, FabZ, or both contribute to the dehydration of β-hydroxybutyryl-ACP in vivo, the fact that our in vitro reconstitution experiments reflect the properties of the fatty acid synthase in vivo provides compelling support for the conclusion that FabI activity plays a determinant role in completing rounds of fatty acid elongation."
https://openalex.org/W2029827117,"Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) causes growth arrest in the G1 phase in many cell types. One probable pathway for this growth inhibition is through the TGF-β-mediated up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p15INK4B, which specifically inhibits the enzymatic activities of CDK4 and CDK6. An active cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex is required for pRb phosphorylation to allow the cell cycle to progress from G1 to S phase. To study the molecular mechanism of the p15INK4B induction by TGF-β, we isolated a 780-base pair promoter sequence of the human p15 gene and inserted this fragment upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. When this construct was transiently transfected into HaCaT cells, luciferase activity was induced more than 10-fold upon TGF-β treatment, indicating that the induction of p15INK4B expression by TGF-β is partly exerted at the transcription level. Promoter deletion analysis revealed that the sequence from -110 to -40 relative to the transcription start site is capable of conferring the 10-fold induction by TGF-β. Within this region there are three Sp1 consensus sites. Mutation of one of these sites, GGGGCGGAG, substantially reduced both the induction by TGF-β and the basal promoter activity, whereas mutations in the other two Sp1 sites and the spacer sequences had little effect. In addition, gel mobility shift assay indicates that the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 bind to this Sp1 site. Taken together, these data suggest that a specific Sp1 consensus site is involved in the mediation of TGF-β induction as well as the basal promoter activity of the p15 gene and that Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors might be involved in this regulation.

TGF-β treatment induces growth arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and this effect has been attributed largely to an inhibition of phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product, pRb (4Laiho M. Decaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Livingston D.M. Massague J. Cell. 1990; 62: 175-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle requires phosphorylation of pRb by G1 cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes, particularly the cyclin D-CDK4 and cyclin D-CDK6 complexes(5Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3205) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of pRb releases transcription factors, including members of the E2F transcription factor family, required for the G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle(6Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar).Two distinct families of CDK inhibitors, represented by p16 and p21, have been identified recently and shown to be capable of binding to and inhibiting the activities of various CDK enzymes (for a recent review, see (5Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3205) Google Scholar)). The p16INK4 family of CDK inhibitors specifically interacts with two closely related CDK proteins, CDK4 and CDK6, both of which have been strongly implicated as the physiological pRb kinases. One member of this family, p15INK4B, was specifically up-regulated by TGF-β in human keratinocyte HaCaT cells(7Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1994; 371: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). The steady-state level of p15INK4B mRNA was induced 30-fold upon TGF-β treatment, implicating p15INK4B as a primary effector of the TGF-β-mediated cell cycle arrest(7Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1994; 371: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). Previously it was shown that treatment of HaCaT cells with TGF-β caused rapid transcriptional induction of the p21 gene (also known as cip1/WAF1/sdi1) through a p53-independent pathway, suggesting that p21 is also involved in mediating the cell cycle arrest caused by TGF-β(8Datto M.B. Li Y. Panus J.F. Howe D.J. Xiong Y. Wang X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5545-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar).The signaling pathways downstream of the TGF-β receptor complex that lead to the inhibition of cell cycle progression are still poorly understood. Since both CDK inhibitors, p15 and p21, are up-regulated by TGF-β treatment, they could be coordinately regulated through a similar mechanism. In this study, we attempt to elucidate the mechanism through which TGF-β specifically up-regulates the expression of p15INK4B by a detailed analysis of the p15INK4Bpromoter sequences.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation of p15 Genomic DNAA human placenta genomic library cloned in λ FIX II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened with the full-length human p16 cDNA(9Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (3354) Google Scholar). Of 1.2 million phage plaques screened, eight positives were isolated. Two oligonucleotide primers, 5′ primer (5′ AGGATCCATGGTGATGATGGGCAGCGCCCGC 3′) and 3′ primer (5′ GAAGCTTGGGTAAGAAAATAAAGTCGTTG 3′), specific to p15 cDNA were designed based on the previously published MTS2 genomic sequence (10Kamb A. Gruis N.A. Weaver Feldhaus J. Liu Q. Harshman K. Tavtigian S.V. Stockert E. Day R. Johnson B.E. Skolnick M.H. Science. 1994; 264: 436-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar) and used in polymerase chain reaction amplification to distinguish p15 from p16. Three p15 genomic clones were obtained, and clone G8 was confirmed by DNA sequencing to correspond to the p15 gene as compared with the p15 cDNA sequence(7Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1994; 371: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar, 11Guan K.L. Jenkins C.W. Li Y. Nichols M.A. Wu X. O'Keefe C.L. Matera A.G. Xiong Y. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2939-2952Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). A 1.2-kilobase pair DNA fragment containing a 440-bp exon 1 and 780-bp sequence upstream of 5′-cDNA was isolated from clone G8 and completely sequenced by Sanger's method(12Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Bio/Technology. 1992; 24: 104-108PubMed Google Scholar).Plasmid ConstructsThe HindIII/SacI, ScaI/SacI, SphI/SacI, SmaI/SacI, PvuII/SacI, and EcoRI/SacI fragments of clone G8 were inserted between the SmaI and SacI sites of the pGL2-basic luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate p15P751-luc, p15P463-luc, p15P165-luc, p15P113-luc, p15P35-luc, and p15P23-luc, respectively. Linker scanning mutants of the p15P113-LS series were made by site-directed mutagenesis(13Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar), and mutant sequences are indicated in Fig. 3A. p15P97-luc, p15P69-luc, p15P47-luc, and p15P35-luc were constructed by inserting the HindIII/SacI fragment of p15P113-LS1, XbaI/SacI fragment of the p15P113-LS3, and HindIII/SacI fragment of the p15P113-LS4 between the SmaI and SacI sites of pGL2-basic luciferase reporter plasmid. All mutations were verified by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing.Gel Mobility Shift AssayComplementary oligonucleotides from -68 to -82 on the p15 promoter were annealed and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. HaCaT cells were treated with or without TGF-β for 20 h, and the nuclear extract was prepared according to Dignam et al.(14Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9143) Google Scholar). 1 μg of total nuclear protein was incubated with 0.5 μg of poly(dI•dC) as well as the appropriate oligonucleotide competitors or antisera (as indicated in the figure legend) for 20 min on ice in a 20-μl reaction containing 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl2, 60 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 6% glycerol. 0.2 ng of the end-labeled probe (2 × 105 cpm) were then added, and the incubation was continued for 20 min at 30°C. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. Rabbit anti-human Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies were generous gifts from Dr. J. Horowitz.Luciferase AssaysHaCaT cells were plated onto 6-well plates at a density of 100,000 cells/well. Cells were grown for 48 h and transfected with 6 μg of plasmid DNA per well with the DEAE-dextran method as described elsewhere(8Datto M.B. Li Y. Panus J.F. Howe D.J. Xiong Y. Wang X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5545-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Human TGF-β1 was added to a concentration of 100 pM, and luciferase activity was assayed 20 h later as described(8Datto M.B. Li Y. Panus J.F. Howe D.J. Xiong Y. Wang X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5545-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). For each transfected plasmid, two duplicates were assayed under the same conditions, and the mean relative light units (RLU) were used in all the figures.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONA 780-bp genomic DNA fragment, which contains sequences upstream of the previously reported 5′-ends of the p15INK4B cDNA(7Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1994; 371: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar, 11Guan K.L. Jenkins C.W. Li Y. Nichols M.A. Wu X. O'Keefe C.L. Matera A.G. Xiong Y. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2939-2952Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), was cloned from a human genomic library. The 5′-end of the p15 mRNA was mapped to the adenosine in the sequence CCCCACTCT as shown in Fig. 3A by S1 nuclease protection assay (data not shown). Thus, the cloned 780-bp DNA fragment largely contains the p15 promoter sequence. The sequence around the initiation site matches the initiator sequence as defined by Smale and Baltimore(15Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). No apparent TATA sequence was found around the -25 to -30 region. Therefore, the p15 promoter may be defined as a TATA-less/initiator promoter. The p15 promoter sequences are highly GC-rich (70% G + C from -200 to -1).To determine its inducibility by TGF-β, the 750-bp p15 promoter sequence was inserted upstream of a luciferase reporter gene in the vector pGL2-basic (Fig. 1). When the resultant construct, p15P751-luc, was transiently transfected into HaCaT cells, a 10-15-fold induction of luciferase activity was routinely observed upon TGF-β treatment as measured by RLU (Fig. 1). Thus, the p15 promoter is capable of being induced by TGF-β, and the transcription activation is at least partly responsible for the accumulation of p15 mRNA upon TGF-β treatment(7Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1994; 371: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar).Figure 1:Deletion analysis of the p15 promoter. Luciferase (Luc) constructs with progressive deletions of the p15 promoter sequences are shown. The restriction sites used in the construction of these deletion constructs are indicated. The initiator (Inr) sequence is indicated as an open box, and the transcription initiation site is indicated by an arrow. The deletion constructs were transiently transfected into HaCaT cells and the RLU measured after cells were treated with or without 100 pM human TGF-β1. Each bar represents the mean RLU of two duplicate experiments under the same assay condition. The fold inductions by TGF-β treatment are shown to the left of bar graph.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To identify specific promoter elements that confer the TGF-β induction, a series of 5′ processive promoter deletion constructs were generated (Fig. 1). These deletion constructs were transiently transfected into HaCaT cells and assayed for luciferase activities in the absence or presence of TGF-β. Fig. 1 shows that deletions up to the position of -110 relative to the initiation site did not change the fold of induction by TGF-β although the overall promoter activities in the presence of TGF-β dropped about 3-fold. Deleting sequences from -110 to -30, however, abolished TGF-β induction (Fig. 1), indicating that a TGF-β-responsive element is located in this region.There are three potential Sp1 binding sites within the -110 to -30 sequences upstream of the transcription initiation site of the p15 gene. Previously, a GC-rich sequence (GCCTCC) capable of binding to Sp1 and Sp3 was shown to be responsible for the induction of p21 gene by TGF-β treatment(30Datto M.B. Wang X.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this sequence is identical to the first Sp1 consensus site in the -110 to -30 fragment of the p15 promoter. To test the possibility that this sequence, or the other two Sp1 consensus sites, may be involved in the mediation of p15 promoter induction by TGF-β, we generated more 5′ promoter deletion constructs to delete either one (p15P97-luc), two (p15P69-luc), or all three Sp1 consensus sites (p15P47-luc) and assayed for their luciferase activities in the absence or presence of TGF-β (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 shows that deletion of the first Sp1 consensus site had little effect on either the induction fold by TGF-β or the basal promoter activity of the p15 luciferase construct, whereas deletion up to the second Sp1 consensus site reduced TGF-β induction dramatically from 19-fold of the wild type promoter to 2.8-fold. Deletion of all three Sp1 consensus sites reduced TGF-β induction only slightly further to 1.5-fold near the background level. These data suggest that the second Sp1 consensus site is the most critical sequence for either the induction by TGF-β or the basal promoter activity of the human p15 promoter.Figure 2:Deletion analysis of the Sp1 consensus sites on the p15 promoter. p15P113-luc, which contains three Sp1 consensus sites and is fully inducible by TGF-β, is shown. Luciferase (Luc) constructs with one (p15P97), two (p15P69), and three (p15P47) Sp1 consensus sites deleted are also shown. These constructs were transiently transfected into HaCaT cells and the luciferase activity assayed as described in the legend of Fig. 1. Fold induction by TGF-β is indicated. Inr, initiator.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm the importance of the second Sp1 consensus site in conferring the transcription inducibility of the p15 promoter by TGF-β, a series of scanning mutation constructs were made in the promoter context of p15P113, which contains 113 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site and is fully capable of being induced by TGF-β (Fig. 3A). The scanning constructs were transiently transfected into HaCaT cells and assayed for their luciferase activities in the absence or presence of TGF-β1. With the exception of p15P113-LS3, all mutants did not change significantly the fold of induction upon TGF-β treatment or the basal transcription activity (Fig. 3B). Mutant p15P113-LS3, which contains a mutation in the second Sp1 site within the -110 to -30 region, decreased the fold of induction from 12-fold of the wild type promoter to 4-fold (Fig. 3B). In addition, the basal promoter activity of p15P113-LS3 was also reduced significantly, approaching the background level (Fig. 3B). Together with the promoter deletion analysis, these data suggest that a specific Sp1 consensus site is important for the mediation of TGF-β induction of the p15 gene as well as its basal promoter activity.To identify protein factors interacting with the second Sp1 site, we used DNA sequences from -68 to -82 on the p15 promoter covering the second Sp1 site in the gel mobility shift assay. As shown in Fig. 4, lane 2, three distinctive protein complexes (I, II, and III) were observed when this probe was incubated with nuclear extract prepared from HaCaT cells. All three complexes are specific to the probe since they were readily competed by an excess of cold homologous competitor (Fig. 4, lanes 9 and 10) but were resistant to the competition of nonspecific oligonucleotides (Fig. 4, lanes 7 and 8). Complex I was abolished when antibody against the human Sp1 transcription factor was included in the binding reaction and therefore represents the complex formed between Sp1 and the second Sp1 site on the p15 promoter (Fig. 4, lane 4). Similarly, complexes II and III represent the complexes formed between Sp3 and the second Sp1 site on the p15 promoter since both complexes were abolished when the binding reaction includes antibody against the transcription factor Sp3 (Fig. 4, lane 6). Together with the promoter mutation analysis, these data show that the second Sp1 site within the -110 to -30 region on the p15 promoter, which is capable of conferring the TGF-β inducibility of the p15 promoter, binds to the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3.Figure 4:Factors binding to the second Sp1 site on the p15 promoter. Complementary oligonucleotides covering the second Sp1 site on the p15 promoter were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and used in the gel mobility shift assay. Three protein-DNA complexes (I, II, and III), as indicated by arrows, were observed when the probe was incubated with 1 μg of nuclear protein (lane 2). In lanes 3 and 4, preimmune sera or antibody against human Sp1 were included in the binding reaction, respectively. In lanes 5 and 6, preimmune sera or antibody against human Sp3 were included in the binding reaction. In lanes 7 and 8, a 50- or 250-fold excess of nonspecific oligonucleotides was included in the binding reaction. In lanes 9 and 10, a 50- or 250-fold excess of the homologous oligonucleotides was included in the binding reaction. Lane 1 is probe alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Sp1 consensus sites are present in numerous gene promoters including many housekeeping genes and cellular proto-oncogenes(16Udvadia A.J.

Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). The well characterized transcription factor Sp1 binds to its cognate binding site and activates transcription presumably through its interaction with the TBP-associated factor 110 (TAFII110) (19Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that Sp1 and a member of the Sp1 family, Sp3, are involved in the regulation of many growth-related cellular genes, including c-fos, c-myc, TGF-β1, and TGF-β3 genes, through a cis-acting element termed the pRb control element(16Udvadia A.J.

Gene (Amst.). 1993; 129: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A model has been proposed to postulate that the functional interaction between pRb and Sp1 in vivo results in the “superactivation” of Sp1-mediated transcription(16Udvadia A.J. Templeton D.J. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3953-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Here we show that a specific Sp1 consensus site is involved in the mediation of TGF-β induction of the p15 gene and that the Sp1 and Sp3 proteins could bind to this specific Sp1 site. The same site is also responsible for the basal promoter activity. Evidence is accumulating that basal transcription machinery is also capable of being regulated in cells, presumably through the action of TBP-associated factors (TAFs). For example, p53 transcription activation is mediated by TAFII40 and TAFII60 (23Thut C.J. Chen J.-L. Klemm R. Tjian R. Science. 1995; 267: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) and the presence of TAFII150 and TAFII250 stabilized the preinitiation complex assembled on an initiator-containing promoter while it destabilized the complex on an initiator-less promoter(24Verrijzer C.P. Chen J.-L. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). A temperature-sensitive mutation in TAFII250 has been shown to cause cell cycle arrest(25Wang E.H. Tjian R. Science. 1994; 263: 811-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 26Hisatake K. Hasegawa S. Takada R. Nakatani Y. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1993; 362: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It is possible that some TAFs could relay the cues received from growth signals and affect the transcription preinitiation complex assembled on certain growth-related genes.A GC-rich sequence in the p21 promoter capable of binding to the Sp1 and Sp3 proteins was shown to be responsible for the induction of the p21 gene by TGF-β in HaCaT cells(30Datto M.B. Wang X.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this GC-rich sequence, termed TβRE for TGF-β-responsive element, was capable of conferring TGF-β inducibility when inserted into an exogenous promoter(30Datto M.B. Wang X.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, it is conceivable that the same GC-box binding factor(s) may be involved in the coordinate regulation of both p15 and p21 genes. Several proteins capable of binding to those GC-rich sequences including the Sp1 consensus sites have been identified. Some of these factors have extensive homologies with Sp1 and thus belong to the Sp1 transcription factor family, such as Sp2, Sp3 and ΔSp3(16Udvadia A.J. Templeton D.J. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3953-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), whereas others are entirely different from Sp1, such as ETF and GC-box binding protein (GCF)(27Kageyama R. Pastan I. Cell. 1989; 59: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 28Kageyama R. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15508-15514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, Sp3 and GC-box binding protein have been shown to bind to the GC-boxes, including Sp1 consensus sites, and repress transcription from certain genes(27Kageyama R. Pastan I. Cell. 1989; 59: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 29Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). More experiments are needed to determine if Sp1, its family members, or other novel GC-box binding proteins are involved in the regulation of p15 and p21 genes by TGF-β. It is possible that the subtle sequence variations and the optimal spacing between binding sites for various transcription factors could alter the balance between the positive and negative transcription regulators and consequently exert a different mode of transcription regulation.

Sporn M.B. Sporn M.B. Boberts A.B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 421-427Google Scholar). TGF-β treatment induces growth arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and this effect has been attributed largely to an inhibition of phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product, pRb (4Laiho M. Decaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Livingston D.M. Massague J. Cell. 1990; 62: 175-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle requires phosphorylation of pRb by G1 cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes, particularly the cyclin D-CDK4 and cyclin D-CDK6 complexes(5Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3205) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of pRb releases transcription factors, including members of the E2F transcription factor family, required for the G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle(6Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar).Two distinct families of CDK inhibitors, represented by p16 and p21, have been identified recently and shown to be capable of binding to and inhibiting the activities of various CDK enzymes (for a recent review, see (5Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3205) Google Scholar)). The p16INK4 family of CDK inhibitors specifically interacts with two closely related CDK proteins, CDK4 and CDK6, both of which have been strongly implicated as the physiological pRb kinases. One member of this family, p15INK4B, was specifically up-regulated by TGF-β in human keratinocyte HaCaT cells(7Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1994; 371: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). The steady-state level of p15INK4B mRNA was induced 30-fold upon TGF-β treatment, implicating p15INK4B as a primary effector of the TGF-β-mediated cell cycle arrest(7Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1994; 371: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). Previously it was shown that treatment of HaCaT cells with TGF-β caused rapid transcriptional induction of the p21 gene (also known as cip1/WAF1/sdi1) through a p53-independent pathway, suggesting that p21 is also involved in mediating the cell cycle arrest caused by TGF-β(8Datto M.B. Li Y. Panus J.F. Howe D.J. Xiong Y. Wang X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5545-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar).The signaling pathways downstream of the TGF-β receptor complex that lead to the inhibition of cell cycle progression are still poorly understood. Since both CDK inhibitors, p15 and p21, are up-regulated by TGF-β treatment, they could be coordinately regulated through a similar mechanism. In this study, we attempt to elucidate the mechanism through which TGF-β specifically up-regulates the expression of p15INK4B by a detailed analysis of the p15INK4Bpromoter sequences."

Treatment of E36 cells with the lysosomotropic amine, primaquine, for 16 h doubled the amount of connexin43 detected by immunoblotting and modestly increased the half-life of connexin43 in pulse-chase studies, suggesting that the lysosome played a minor role in connexin43 proteolysis. In contrast, treatment with the proteasomal inhibitor N-acetyl-L-leucyl-L-leucinyl-norleucinal led to a 6-fold accumulation of connexin43 and increased the half-life of connexin43 to ~9 h. The role of ubiquitin in connexin43 degradation was examined in an E36-derived mutant, ts20, which contains a thermolabile ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E1. E36 and ts20 cells grown at the permissive temperature contained similar amounts of connexin43 detectable by immunoblotting. Heat treatment dramatically reduced the amount of connexin43 detected in E36 cells, while connexin43 levels in heat-treated ts20 cells did not change. E36 cells that were heat-treated in the presence of N-acetyl-L-leucyl-L-leucinyl-norleucinal did not lose their connexin43. Pulse-chase experiments showed the reversibility of the block to connexin43 degradation in ts20 cells that were returned to the permissive temperature. Finally, sequential immunoprecipitation using anti-connexin43 and anti-ubiquitin antibodies demonstrated polyubiquitination of connexin43.

The suppression of NO production may be fundamental for survival of neurons. Here, we report that pretreatment of human ramified microglial cells with nearly physiological levels of exogenous NO prevents lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-inducible NO synthesis, because by affecting NF-κB activation it inhibits inducible Ca2+-independent NO synthase isoform (iNOS) mRNA expression. Using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, we have found that both NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and authentic NO solution are able to inhibit LPS/TNFα-inducible iNOS gene expression; this effect was reversed by reduced hemoglobin, a trapping agent for NO. The early presence of SNP during LPS/TNFα induction is essential for inhibition of iNOS mRNA expression. Furthermore, SNP is capable of inhibiting LPS/TNFα-inducible nitrite release, as determined by Griess reaction. Finally, using electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we have shown that SNP inhibits LPS/TNFα-elicited NF-κB activation.

Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). NO production is catalyzed by at least two major forms of the NO synthase (NOS) enzyme: a constitutive Ca2+-dependent NOS isoform (cNOS) and an inducible Ca2+-independent NOS isoform (iNOS), which is expressed after stimulation with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cytokines. Recently, we have demonstrated that LPS and/or TNFα are able to induce iNOS in human ramified microglia leading to a high NO output(2Colasanti M. Persichini T. Di Pucchio T. Gremo F. Lauro G.M.

Recently, we have observed that sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a well known NO donor, elicited inhibition of LPS-induced iNOS expression in rat neutrophils, suggesting a possible suppressive effect on iNOS gene expression by exogenous NO(12Mariotto S. Cuzzolin L. Adami A. Del Soldato P. Suzuki H. Benoni G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 6-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The promoter region of human iNOS gene in vascular smooth muscle cells was shown to contain the consensus sequences for the binding of NFκB, a nuclear transcriptional factor(13Nunokawa Y. Ishida N. Tanaka S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 802-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and iNOS transcription has been recently observed as being regulated by NFκB activation(14Goldring C.E.P. Narayanan R. Lagadec P. Jeannin J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).Here, we used human ramified microglial cells as a model for a better understanding of the molecular mechanism by which NO regulates its own production. To this respect, we hypothesize that a nearly physiological level of exogenous NO may prevent LPS/TNFα-inducible iNOS mRNA expression by affecting NFκB activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsOxyhemoglobin was prepared by reduction of bovine hemoglobin (Sigma) with sodium hydrosulfite (Aldrich); authentic NO solution was obtained by a 30-min bubbling of distilled and deoxygenated water with >99.5% pure NO gas (SIAD S.p.A., Bergamo, Italy) at 4°C. This stock solution is in the low millimolar range (about 2 mM at 25°C); 1% of stock solution was administered 0.5 h before and every 0.5 h during the experiment. Nw-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, SNP, and E. coli LPS (serotype 0127:B8) were from Sigma; TNFα (specific activity, >2 × 107 units/mg of protein) was from Boehringer Mannheim, and L-2,3,4,5-[3H]arginine was from Amersham Corp.Cell CulturePure human ramified microglia derived from human fetal brain (8-18 weeks of gestation) primary cultures were obtained as described previously(2Colasanti M. Persichini T. Di Pucchio T. Gremo F. Lauro G.M. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). The cells (48th-52nd passages in culture) were characterized for specific microglial markers such as lysozyme, α1-chymotrypsin, Fc receptor, GSA1-B4, and RCA-1 and for phagocytic activity. The negativity of cells for glial fibrillary acidic protein, GalC, Factor VIII, and neurofilaments demonstrated that there were no contaminating astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, endothelial cells, or neurons(2Colasanti M. Persichini T. Di Pucchio T. Gremo F. Lauro G.M. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar).Nitrite AnalysisNitrite (NO2-) was determined by using the Griess reagent (1% sulfanilamide, 0.1% naphthylenediamine dihydrochloride, 2.5% H3PO4) in supernatants of 5 × 105 human microglial cells. Absorbance was measured at 540 nm, and NO2- concentration was determined using sodium nitrite as a standard. Since SNP spontaneously generated nitrite, final concentrations of NO2- were estimated by the difference between the SNP-produced NO2- levels either in the presence or in the absence of cells.RT-PCRTotal cellular RNA was purified from 1 × 106 human ramified microglial cells by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi(15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (62983) Google Scholar). Briefly, a single extraction with an acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform mixture was performed. Whole RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA and amplified for the iNOS gene with Thermus aquaticus (Taq) DNA polymerase in a thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer), as described previously (2Colasanti M. Persichini T. Di Pucchio T. Gremo F. Lauro G.M. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Ten microliters of each PCR product (450 bp) were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gel and then visualized after ethidium bromide staining. The mRNA for the constitutive glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was examined as the reference cellular transcript. GAPDH mRNA amplification products were present at equivalent levels in all cell lysates. The reaction was performed by using specific primers as described elsewhere(16Genis P. Jett M. Bernton E.W. Boyle T. Gelbard H.A. Dzenko K. Keane R.W. Reswnick L. Mizrachi Y. Volsky D.J. Epstein L.G. Gendelman H.E. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1703-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar).Assay of Microglial iNOS ActivityHuman microglial iNOS activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of L-2,3,4,5-[3H]arginine to L-2,3-[3H]citrulline according to the modification of the method described by Bredt and Snyder(17Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3114) Google Scholar). 1 × 107 microglial cells were homogenized with Ultra-Turrax homogenizer (5-mm blade) for 20 s in 1 ml of a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mMDL-dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml antipain, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation (10,000 × g, 30 min at 4°C), an aliquot of the supernatant was added to a reaction mixture of a final volume of 100 μl containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 nM [3H]arginine, 1 μM arginine, 1 mM NADPH, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 μg/ml calmodulin, 10 μM FAD, 0.1 mM (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1-biopterin, 1 mM dithiothreitol. The effect of NO donor SNP on enzyme activity was examined by either preincubating the supernatant for 2 h with SNP (10 μM) or adding it directly to the assay mixture. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 25°C. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.4 ml of a 1:1 slurry of Dowex AG 50W-X8 (Bio-Rad, Na+ form) in 50 mM HEPES pH 5.5, and, after 15 min of shaking, radioactivity in the supernatant was measured. Enzyme activity was expressed as picomoles of citrulline formed in 1 min by 1 mg of protein. Protein concentration in the samples was determined by the method of Bradford(18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift AssayNuclear extracts of human microglial cells were prepared according to Schreiber et al.(19Schreiber E. Mattias P. Muller M.M. Schaffiner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3908) Google Scholar) in the presence of leupeptin (10 μg/ml), antipain (5 μg/ml), pepstatin (5 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mM). Protein concentrations of nuclear extracts were determined according to Bradford(18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar). Eight micrograms of nuclear extract were incubated at room temperature for 30 min with 2-5 × 104 cpm of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the consensus NFκB DNA binding site (5′-GATCCAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAGTAC-3′) in a 15-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA, and 10% glycerol. Products were fractionated on a non-denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel. In competition assays, 100 × oligonucleotide competitor was added 15 min before addition of the labeled probe. The intensity of the retarded bands was measured by PhosphorImager SF (Molecular Dynamics).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAs described previously, human ramified microglial cells were found to release high NO amounts(2Colasanti M. Persichini T. Di Pucchio T. Gremo F. Lauro G.M. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). In fact, we observed that stimulation of 5 × 105 microglial cells with a mixture containing LPS (1 μg/ml) + TNFα (500 units/ml) for 24 h caused a marked production of nitrite (NO2-), the breakdown product of NO (from 3.52 ± 0.26 to 15.54 ± 0.66 nmol ml-1; Fig. 1), as measured by Griess reaction. This increase was abolished by NOS inhibitor Nw-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (500 μM) (from 15.54 ± 0.66 to 3.07 ± 0.24 nmol ml-1) (Fig. 1). A 0.5-h pretreatment of human ramified microglial cells with SNP (10 μM) decreased NO production induced by LPS/TNFα (from 15.54 ± 0.66 to 4.07 ± 0.72 nmol ml-1) (Fig. 1). However, this effect was not accounted for by direct modification of iNOS enzymatic activity, as determined using [3H]citrulline generation from L-[3H]arginine. In fact, we have observed that human microglial cells treated with LPS (1 μg/ml) + TNFα (500 units/ml) for 24 h expressed a Ca2+-independent NOS activity (680 pmol/min/mg of protein). When SNP (10 μM) were added directly into the assay mixture or preincubated for 2 h in the enzyme preparations, no significant variations of iNOS activity were observed (data not shown).The following results provide evidence that NO was able to reduce its own production in human ramified microglial cells by affecting iNOS gene expression. As previously observed(2Colasanti M. Persichini T. Di Pucchio T. Gremo F. Lauro G.M. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar), using RT-PCR we found that an 8-h treatment of microglial cells with LPS/TNFα strongly enhanced iNOS mRNA levels (Fig. 2). When LPS/TNFα-treated microglial cells were preincubated with NO donor SNP (10 μM) iNOS gene expression was strongly inhibited (Fig. 2). This effect was significantly reversed by reduced hemoglobin (oxyhemoglobin; 1 μM), a trapping agent for NO. To obtain further evidence that the effect of SNP was mediated by its NO release, SNP was pre-exposed to room light for 2 weeks to prerelease NO, as verified by determination of nitrite levels (data not shown). The resulting cyanide, Fe2+, and nitrite did not interfere with iNOS mRNA induction (Fig. 2). Furthermore, 1% of authentic NO solution was capable of inhibiting iNOS mRNA expression (Fig. 2). Recently, Park et al.(11Park S.K. Lin H.L. Murphy S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) have observed that NO limited iNOS mRNA expression in rat glial cells when it was produced following stimulation with cytokines. However, we have observed that the early presence (0.5 h) of SNP during cell stimulation with LPS/TNFα was essential for iNOS mRNA inhibition. In fact, when SNP was added 4 h after iNOS up-regulation, no inhibition of iNOS mRNA synthesis was observed. Our data indicate that nearly physiological levels of pre-existing exogenous NO may prevent the induction of iNOS gene expression at least in some cell lines such as human microglial cells.Figure 2:Effect of NO on iNOS gene expression in human ramified microglial cells. 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis of the RT-PCR products for iNOS mRNA (450 bp) and for GAPDH mRNA (195 bp) after ethidium bromide staining is shown.

PCR products for the GAPDH gene were taken as the reference cellular transcript. Molecular weight is the 100-bp DNA ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)By using electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we found that treatment with LPS/TNFα induced the activation of NF-κB, which peaked after a 0.5-h stimulation (Fig. 3), this effect being observed elsewhere for an established mouse macrophage cell line(14Goldring C.E.P. Narayanan R. Lagadec P. Jeannin J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A 0.5-h pretreatment of human microglial cells with SNP (10 μM) was able to inhibit LPS/TNFα-elicited NF-κB activation (Fig. 3), suggesting that exogenous NO inhibition of iNOS expression may be due to a decreased NF-κB activation. On the other hand, it has been confirmed recently that in human vascular endothelial cells NO inhibited NF-κB activation, this effect being mediated by induction and stabilization of I-κB(20Peng H-B. Libby P. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14214-14219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar).Figure 3:Effect of SNP on DNA binding activity of NF-κB transcription factor in human ramified microglial cells.

Lane 1, untreated cells; lanes 2-5, cells treated with LPS/TNFα for 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h, respectively; lane 6, the same samples as for lane 2 incubated with 100 × cold NF-κB as specific competitor; lane 7, the same sample as for lane 2 incubated with 100 × nonspecific competitor; lane 8, control cells pretreated with SNP (10 μM) for 0.5 h; lanes 9-12, LPS/TNFα-treated cells preincubated (0.5 h) with SNP for 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Uncontrolled and massive iNOS-induced NO production was suggested to be potentially detrimental to the tissue integrity(21Suzuki H. Menegazzi M. Carcereri de Prati A. Mariotto S. Armato U. Adv. Neuroimmunol. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The present data indicate that nearly physiological concentrations of NO may keep the iNOS expression suppressed by preventing NF-κB activation. This implies that induction of iNOS expression could be regulated, at least in part, by the endogenous NO level likely to be produced by cNOS enzyme, although no data concerning this matter are available so far. When the basal level of NO is at a value such as to suppress iNOS expression, the endogenous NO may contribute to avoid an undesirable and potentially harmful induction of iNOS expression. If the NO level goes down below threshold value, iNOS expression may become easily achievable. In this respect, it seems worthwhile noting that LPS/IFNg, which induces iNOS gene, is also able to simultaneously decrease cNOS mRNA expression in human monocyte/macrophage cells (22Reiling N. Ulmer A.J. Duchrow M. Ernst M. Flad H-D. Hauschildt S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in endothelial cells TNFα has been shown to regulate cNOS expression by shortening its mRNA half-life(23Yoshizumi M. Perrella M.A. Burnett J.C. Lee M.E. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar).Finally, NO donors could be considered potential drugs for the control of microglial iNOS expression induction. Since the latter seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of some neurodegenerative diseases, exogenous NO donor could be as potentially active for the prevention of those pathologies.

Park et al.(11Park S.K. Lin H.L. Murphy S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

However, little is known about the regulatory effects on the mechanism by the variable low concentrations of the available NO before iNOS induction. Recently, we have observed that sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a well known NO donor, elicited inhibition of LPS-induced iNOS expression in rat neutrophils, suggesting a possible suppressive effect on iNOS gene expression by exogenous NO(12Mariotto S.

We now report the cloning of a cDNA for a type II deiodinase using a reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction strategy and RNA obtained from Rana catesbeiana tissues. This cDNA (RC5′DII) manifests limited but significant homology with other deiodinase cDNAs and contains a conserved in-frame TGA codon. Injection of capped in vitro synthesized transcripts of the cDNA into Xenopuslaevis oocytes results in the induction of deiodinase activity with characteristics typical of a type II deiodinase. The levels of RC5′DII transcripts in R. catesbeiana tadpole tail and liver mRNA at stages XII and XXIII correspond well with that of type II deiodinase activity but not that of the type III activity in these tissues.

https://openalex.org/W2019284238,"Integrin-mediated interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix play a fundamental role in the development and function of a variety of tissues by triggering intracellular signals that regulate gene expression. In this study, mouse mammary epithelial cells plated on tissue culture plastic were shown to dramatically up-regulate the steady state levels of mRNA encoding the α1, α2, α3, α5, α6, α7, αv, and β1 integrin subunits, in contrast to cells cultured on a basement membrane matrix or cells in vivo. This pattern of expression was also observed in a mouse mammary epithelial strain, CID-9 and in other mouse cell lines such as MMTE cells and K1735-M2 melanoma cells. The control of integrin expression was mediated at different levels in different cell types. In K1735-M2 cells, transcription of the β1 integrin gene was influenced by the substratum, although the levels of integrin protein remained similar. In mammary epithelial cells, the rates of β1 integrin gene transcription were similar, but mRNA and protein levels were higher in cells cultured on plastic than those on basement membrane. For both cell types, the rate of integrin protein turnover was nearly identical in cells cultured on either substratum. Our results demonstrate that extracellular matrix controls the expression of β1 integrin subunits and that this regulation is exerted at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.

It is becoming increasingly clear that cell-matrix interactions, through specific adhesion receptors, trigger biological responses similar to those transduced by growth factors, hormones, or cytokines(1Ruoslahti E.

We previously showed that interactions between mammary cells and the ECM could regulate the expression of ECM molecules themselves(3Streuli C.H. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1405-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In an in vivo environment, mammary epithelial cells interact with a basement membrane, but on an inadequate substratum in tissue culture, such as on a plastic surface, the cells attempt to recreate their basement membrane by transcribing and translating genes coding for ECM proteins such as fibronectin and laminin(3Streuli C.H. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1405-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We have now asked whether the type of cell-matrix interactions also induce a similar regulation in the expression of cell surface β1 integrin receptors for ECM components. Any matrix-induced changes in the levels and patterns of integrin subunits might alter the way that microenvironmental signals are perceived, trigger the expression of new sets of genes, and modify cell phenotype. We therefore examined the mRNAs coding for different subunits of the β1 integrin family in mammary epithelial cells and compared their expression levels in cells cultured either on a plastic surface or on a laminin-enriched reconstituted basement membrane matrix. We then assessed whether changes in the amounts of mRNA were reflected at the protein level. Our results demonstrate that the nature of the substratum controls the expression of integrins at both the mRNA and protein levels. The ECM-dependent modulation of β1 integrin expression was not ligand-specific since the levels of mRNA encoding a wide variety of α chains of the β1 integrins were altered. This regulation was not restricted to mouse mammary epithelial cells but also applied to other cell types, such as melanoma cells, and cells from other species including epithelial cells from normal human breast. We argue that this pattern of integrin gene expression reflects a general control mechanism activated by cells in an inappropriate environment, which is required for the establishment of sufficient cell-matrix interactions to maintain survival and differentiation. The rat mAb GoH3 directed against the mouse integrin α6 subunit (4Sonnenberg A. Modderman P.W.

Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1405-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), and primary or first passage cultures were used. The mouse mammary epithelial milk-producing strain COMMA 1D-9 (or CID-9) was maintained as described elsewhere(11Schmidhauser C. Bissell M.J. Myers C.A. Casperson G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

K-1735 M2 (or M2) and MMTE cell lines were cultured in DMEM medium (Life Technologies Ltd., Paisley, Scotland) with minimal essential medium nonessential amino acids, 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies), and glucose at 4.5 g/liter. Primary human breast luminal epithelial cells were obtained directly from biopsy and cultured as mouse mammary cells. To induce differentiation in the mammary cultures, cells were first plated on tissue culture plastic or on EHS matrix (prepared as described previously) (12Kleinman H.K. McGarvey M.L. Hassell J.R.

Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 407-417PubMed Google Scholar). To establish cells stably expressing CAT under the control of integrin promoters, CID-9 cells were transfected as described previously with some minor changes(15Schmidhauser C. Casperson G.F. Myers C.A. Sanzo K.T. Bolten S. Bissell M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). M2 cells were plated in DMEM, 5% FCS at 8 × 105 cells/85-mm dish 24 h prior to the transfection. They were cotransfected by incubation for 16 h with calcium phosphate precipitates containing 30 μg of the different plasmids and 3 μg of pSV2neo. The cells were shocked with 25% glycerol in 1 × Hanks' balanced salts for 90 s. The selection was started 36 h after transfection by addition of G418 (Life Technologies) at 1 mg/ml. After ≈2 weeks, the G418-resistant clones were pooled and expanded. Total RNA was isolated using the guanidinium thiocyanate method(16Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar). 10 μg of total RNA were fractionated on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels, and blotted to Hybond-N membrane (Amersham International, Little Chalfont, UK) as described elsewhere(3Streuli C.H. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1405-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Membranes were then probed with cDNA fragments labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (DuPont NEN Ltd., Stevenage, UK) by random oligonucleotide primer synthesis. Cells cultured on EHS matrix were washed and harvested by treatment with 1% dispase for 30 min at 37°C(11Schmidhauser C. Bissell M.J. Myers C.A. Casperson G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9118-9122Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Cells cultured on plastic were detached with trypsin-EDTA, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and suspended in 0.25 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.8). A cell extract was prepared by three cycles of freeze-thawing followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min. The total protein concentration in these lysates was estimated using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd., Hemel Hempstead, UK), and 10 μg of protein were used for CAT assays. The CAT reaction was carried out for 1 h at 37°C in a 150-μl reaction mixture, containing 2 μl of [14C]chloramphenicol (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1991: 9.6.1-9.6.9Google Scholar) (ICN Biomedicals, High Wycombe, UK), 0.53 mM acetyl coenzyme A, 0.25 M Tris-Cl, pH 7.8(11Schmidhauser C. Bissell M.J. Myers C.A. Casperson G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9118-9122Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). After [14C]chloramphenicol extraction with ethyl acetate, acetylated [14C]chloramphenicol was separated from the nonacetylated form by thin layer chromatography. CAT activity was determined by measuring the level of acetylated chloramphenicol using storage PhosphorImager plates (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). 2 × 107 M2 cells and mammary epithelial cells were cultured on plastic or EHS matrix, and their nuclei were isolated and used immediately for in vitro transcription. Nuclei were incubated for 30 min in the presence of [32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham), and the radiolabeled transcripts were collected by proteinase K/SDS digestion, phenol extraction, and ethanol precipitation, as previously described (18Rodaway A.R. Teahan C.G. Casimir C.M. Segal A.W. Bentley D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5388-5396Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Equal numbers of counts of the nascent radiolabeled transcripts were hybridized for 72 h at 65°C to 5 μg of linearized and denatured DNAs attached to Biodyne B transfer membranes (Pall Biosupport Division, Portsmouth, UK). Probes were a 2.9-kb EcoRI fragment of mouse β1 integrin cDNA, a 4.1-kb fragment of GAPDH, and the Bluescript vector as control. After washing steps, the membranes were exposed to storage PhosphorImager plates for quantitative analysis of the levels of newly transcribed RNAs. Cultures were steady state radiolabeled for 20-24 h, with 200 μCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN Biomedicals) in differentiation medium, washed three times with DMEM/F-12 medium, and lysed with 10 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mg/ml MgCl2, 1 mg/ml CaCl2, 0.5% Nonidet-P40, pH 7.4, containing a mixture of protease inhibitors consisting of 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 13 μM aprotinin, 20 μM leupeptin, and 1.5 μM pepstatin A (Sigma). Aliquots of lysates containing equal trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts were reacted for 1 h at 4°C with excess of either rat mAbs or rabbit antisera raised against integrin subunit cytoplasmic domains. Immune complexes were immunoprecipitated for 1 h with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc, South San Francisco, CA). When rat mAbs were used, integrins were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads that were preincubated with rabbit anti-rat IgG. The bound complexes were washed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions on 5 or 6% gels. Gels were dried and autoradiographed with Kodak XAR-5 film at -70°C. Immunoprecipitated material was quantitated by use of storage PhosphorImager plates. Autoradiograms of SDS-PAGE gels and Northern blots were scanned with an Omnimedia flatbed densitometer and Adobe Photoshop 2.0.1. software (Adobe Systems, Inc., Mountain View, CA). Two-dimensional densitometry, using 256 gray scales, was done with Image 1.43 software (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). TLC chromatography of acetylated chloramphenicol two-dimensional images was obtained by exposing storage PhosphorImager plates to TLC plates for 1 h. Digitized images were obtained using a Fujix Bas 2000 Bio imaging analyzer. Individual spots of acetylated and nonacetylated chloramphenicol were quantitated with the Fuji software. This technology was also used to analyze SDS-PAGE gels, nuclear run-ons, and Northern blots. To assess whether the expression of β1 integrins might be regulated by the type of ECM with which cells interact, we evaluated the levels of integrins subunit mRNAs both in primary mouse mammary epithelial cells, cultured under differentiation conditions, and in several cell lines. For all of these studies, we utilized tissue culture plastic and a reconstituted basement membrane (EHS matrix). All of the cell types plated on plastic showed a flattened appearance and grew to form homogenous monolayers (Fig. 1). Cells cultured on top of EHS matrix were rounder and tended to gather in colonies. The colonies that formed were either multicellular clusters (CID-9 cells, primary mammary epithelial cells, M2 cells), or alternatively the colonies sent out processes and displayed a lacelike pattern (MMTE cells). These differences presumably reflect variations in adhesion with neighboring cells or with the ECM. In our initial studies on integrin expression, we focused on mammary epithelial cells. These cells differentiate and synthesize milk proteins in the presence of lactogenic hormones, but differentiation requires β1 integrin-mediated interaction with the basement membrane(13Streuli C.H. Bailey N. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1383-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). By using cDNA probes to most of the α subunits that form heterodimers with the β1 chain, we found that primary cultures of mammary epithelial cells express α2, α3, α5, α6, α7, and αv (Fig. 2A). α8 and α9 were undetectable (not shown). The expression of α1 was very low and was probably due to contamination of our cultures by myoepithelial cells, which in humans are known to express the α1 subunit strongly(19D'Ardenne A.J. Richman P.I. Horton M.A. McAulay A.E. Jordan S. J. Pathol. 1991; 165: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We did not examine α4 mRNA, but no α4 protein was detectable in mammary epithelial cultures. The spectrum of integrin mRNA expression compares well with our subsequent protein analysis and defines for the first time the α integrin subunit expression profile for alveolar epithelial cells isolated directly from pregnant mouse mammary gland (see below). When we compared the mRNA levels of the α subunits and the β1 chain in cells cultured on the plastic and basement membrane substratum, we found that the cells responded to plastic by up-regulating expression of these integrin subunits (Fig. 2A). This was particularly dramatic for the α2, α3, and β1 subunits, although the integrin mRNA levels were so low in cells cultured on EHS matrix that they could not satisfactorily be quantitated with a densitometer. The response was likely to represent an up-regulation, since the integrin mRNA levels both in mammary gland tissue isolated at different stages of development and in purified alveolar epithelial (T0) cells isolated directly from the mammary gland were low and comparable to the levels in cells cultured on EHS matrix (Fig. 2B). The integrin subunit expression profile and response to ECM were similar in a mammary epithelial cell strain, CID-9, that retains its ability to differentiate after stimulation with basement membrane and lactogenic hormones (Fig. 2C). In contrast to the integrin expression pattern, both primary mammary cells and CID-9 cells expressed higher levels of the milk protein gene, β-casein, on the basement membrane matrix, as expected (11Schmidhauser C. Bissell M.J. Myers C.A. Casperson G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9118-9122Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 14Aggeler J. Ward J. Blackie L.M. Barcellos-Hoff M.H. Streuli C.H. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 407-417PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, A and C). In order to determine whether this pattern of integrin regulation was specific for differentiating mammary epithelial cells or not, we examined the dependence on ECM of integrin expression in one other mouse epithelial cell type, MMTE, and one other cell line of nonepithelial lineage, the melanoma cell line K1735-M2 (or M2) (Fig. 3). In MMTE cells, the influence of substrata was dramatic, notably for the α2, α3, and β1 subunits, and was serum-independent (Fig. 3A). The majority of integrin mRNAs tested were also up-regulated in M2 cells cultured on plastic (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that this substratum-dependent control of integrin expression was not confined to mammary epithelial cells either of a differentiating phenotype (primary cultures and CID-9) or of a tumor phenotype (MMTE), but was also seen in cells of a completely different lineage (M2). Having shown that the steady state levels of integrin mRNAs were increased by culture on plastic, we next asked whether this was due to increased transcriptional activity of the integrin promoter by CAT assay and nuclear run-on. M2 cells were transfected with vectors encoding the CAT reporter gene under the control of β1 integrin or SV40 promoter sequences (Fig. 4A). Stably transfected clones were pooled, and their levels of CAT expression were assessed after plating the cells on different substrata. Our results show that transcription from the human β1 integrin distal promoter was more efficient in cells cultured on plastic than on basement membrane (Fig. 4B). The promoter sequence more proximal to the start site did not show any appreciable expression of CAT enzyme in M2 cells cultured on either substrata, indicating that either this region does not contain an ECM-regulated transcription binding site or contains a silencer sequence to outweigh transcriptional activation, as shown for the αIIb integrin subunit(20Fong A.M. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18441-18447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that transcription was regulated by cell-matrix interactions, nuclear run-on assays were performed. Our results show that transcription from the endogenous β1 integrin promoter in M2 cells was increased by culture on a plastic substratum (Fig. 4C), suggesting that a matrix-dependent control element lies within the promoter sequence for this integrin. However, in contrast to M2 cells, β1 integrin transcription in mammary epithelial cells was not up-regulated on plastic, as assessed either by CAT assay (Fig. 4D) or by nuclear run-on (Fig. 4E). This suggests that the ECM-dependent transcription machinery in mammary epithelial cells is different from that in M2 cells. Thus, at least in some cell types, part of the ECM-dependent control of integrin expression occurs at the transcriptional level. The difference between rates of transcription and levels of β1 integrin mRNA suggests that additional controls occur at the level of mRNA stability, although we have not been able to assess this owing to the negligible quantity of integrin mRNA present in any of the epithelial or melanoma cell cultures on EHS matrix. Since the mRNA levels for α and β integrin subunits were increased in cells cultured on plastic, we asked whether the changes in expression were reflected at the level of protein synthesis. Immunoprecipitations with antisera that recognize mouse β1 integrins established that both primary cultures of mammary epithelial cells and the CID-9 cell strain expressed α3, α5, α6, and αv subunits but not α1 or α4. The anti-α3 integrin antiserum specifically precipitated α3 and β1 chains (Fig. 5), while an anti-β1 integrin antibody immunoprecipitated the β1 subunit (100-110 kDa), a lower mobility band (90-93 kDa), and the associated α chains (120-130 kDa) under nonreducing conditions. The 90-93-kDa band was shown to be the β1 chain precursor by a pulse-chase experiment (not shown) and was not immunoprecipitated with the anti-α3 antiserum. Comparison of the levels of subunits in the anti-α3 and the anti-β1 integrin immune precipitates indicated that the major subunit to associate with β1 was α3 (Fig. 5). This suggests that α3β1 is one of the most abundant β1 integrins present in this cell type. The α6 integrin chain was also present in mammary cells and was precipitated by both α6- and β4-specific monoclonal antibodies (Figure 5:, Figure 6:B). To determine whether ECM regulated the expression of any integrin subunits at the protein level, cells cultured on the different substrata were steady state labeled and equal amounts of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable newly synthesized proteins were used for immunoprecipitations. We could not examine the relative abundance of surface-labeled integrin due to the harsh procedure required to dissociate cells from EHS matrix. An anti-β1 integrin peptide antibody that precipitates the β1 chain together with its associated α subunits revealed that, in first passage mammary cultures and in CID-9 cells, the α chains as well as the β1 chain were synthesized at higher levels on plastic than on EHS matrix (Fig. 6A). Immunoprecipitations with α6- and β4-specific monoclonal antibodies showed that expression of α6 and β4 protein was also up-regulated on plastic (Fig. 6B). Scanning densitometry and PhosphorImager analysis demonstrated that the up-regulation varied from 3-fold (β1 chain) to 5-fold (α6 and β4 chains). A 3-fold up-regulation of integrin synthesis was also observed, for both the α and β chains, in primary cultures of luminal epithelial cells isolated from normal human breast (Fig. 6C). This result suggests that matrix-dependent control of β1 integrin expression is conserved across species and may therefore be of widespread importance. Although we found that different cell types cultured on plastic dishes all showed increased levels of integrin mRNA, this was not always reflected at the protein level. For example, in M2 cells, which expressed α1, α3, and α6 integrin subunits (Fig. 7A), as well as α4 (not shown), integrin protein synthesis was either similar on the different substrata (β1 and most of the α subunits), or for the α1 subunit, was 3 times lower on plastic than on basement membrane matrix (Fig. 7B). Since no strict correlation was found between the differential regulation of integrin protein and mRNA expression, we asked whether the turnover rate of these receptors in mammary epithelial cells was higher on plastic than on EHS matrix. First passage mammary epithelial cells were steady state-labeled, and β1 integrins were immunoprecipitated after varying times of a cold chase (Fig. 8A). The kinetics of integrin turnover was very similar on both substrata and the half-life of both the α and β subunits was close to 24 h (Fig. 8B). In addition, we performed analogous experiments with CID-9 and M2 cells and found that the rates of α and β integrin subunit turnover were similar on both plastic and EHS matrix. However, since the absolute values of both α and β subunits were higher in mammary epithelial cells cultured on plastic (Fig. 8A), it follows that the rates of integrin subunit degradation were also higher under these conditions. Together, our results indicate that the amount of integrin subunits expressed by cells is controlled at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, but the mechanisms employed appear to be cell type-specific. Our study establishes that ECM controls the expression of β1 integrins in mammary epithelial cells. When these cells were cultured on a basement membrane matrix, integrin mRNA levels were comparable to those in the mammary gland. By contrast, culturing cells on a plastic substratum triggered a dramatic and sustained expression of the mRNA coding for various β1 integrin subunits. It is likely that multiple mechanisms operate since only a proportion of the increase in mRNA was reflected at the level of protein synthesis. This control of integrin expression was also observed in epithelial cells from normal human breast and in cells from other lineages such as melanoma cells, which suggests that it stems from a general matrix-dependent regulatory mechanism. However, not all of the transcribed mRNAs behaved like those of integrin subunits since the amount of β-casein mRNA was reduced, not increased,"

We have designed a CAAX peptidomimetic, GGTI-287, which is 10 times more potent toward inhibiting geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I) in vitro (IC50 = 5 nM) than our previously reported farnesyltransferase inhibitor, FTI-276. In whole cells, the methyl ester derivative of GGTI-287, GGTI-286, was 25-fold more potent (IC50 = 2 μM) than the corresponding methyl ester of FTI-276, FTI-277, toward inhibiting the processing of the geranylgeranylated protein Rap1A. Furthermore, GGTI-286 is highly selective for geranylgeranylation over farnesylation since it inhibited the processing of farnesylated H-Ras only at much higher concentrations (IC50 > 30 μM). While the processing of H-Ras was very sensitive to inhibition by FTI-277 (IC50 = 100 nM), that of K-Ras4B was highly resistant (IC50 = 10 μM). In contrast, we found the processing of K-Ras4B to be much more sensitive to GGTI-286 (IC50 = 2 μM). Furthermore, oncogenic K-Ras4B stimulation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase was inhibited potently by GGTI-286 (IC50 = 1 μM) but weakly by FTI-277 (IC50 = 30 μM). Significant inhibition of oncogenic K-Ras4B stimulation of MAP kinase by GGTI-286 occurred at concentrations (1-3 μM) that did not inhibit oncogenic H-Ras stimulation of MAP kinase. The data presented in this study provide the first demonstration of selective disruption of oncogenic K-Ras4B processing and signaling by a CAAX peptidomimetic.

The extraction buffer contained 0.2 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 8 M guanidine HCl, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM amino caproic acid, 10 mMN-ethylmaleimide, and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The extraction was performed at 4°C overnight with stirring, and the mixture was diluted and brought to a density of 1.35 g/ml with solid CsCl. A density gradient was established by centrifugation at 130,000 × g, 10°C, for 48 h (Hitachi, 70P-72). The gradient was partitioned into 16 fractions, and the contents of HA and proteins in each fraction were determined by carbazole reaction and micro-BCA method, respectively(21Yoneda M. Suzuki S. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5247-5257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18514) Google Scholar). The lower one-fourth of the gradient which contained above 90% of the total HA was pooled. Furthermore, a second centrifugation with an initial density of 1.38 g/ml and subsequent assays for HA and proteins in partitioned fractions were performed as described above. The lower half of the gradient was pooled and subjected to a third centrifugation with an initial density of 1.45 g/ml, and subsequent assays for HA and proteins in partitioned fractions were as described above. The fractions from the bottom, nos. 4-10, which contained most of the total HA, were pooled and subjected to ethanol precipitation to collect the SHAP•HA complex(21Yoneda M. Suzuki S. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5247-5257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SHAP•HA complex (160 mg) was dissolved in 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mM KCl and 3 mM MgCl2 and treated with 300 units (100 μg) of DNase I at 37°C overnight with agitation. After CaCl2 was added (the final concentration 2 mM), the mixture was treated with 100 μg of thermolysin at 37°C with agitation. After 6 h, another 100 μg of thermolysin were added, and further incubation for 3 h was performed. The same volume of 8 M guanidine HCl (extraction buffer) was added to the digested mixture. After the density was brought to 1.35 g/ml by adding solid CsCl, centrifugation at 130,000 × g for 48 h was performed. The HA content in the partitioned fractions was determined as described above. The HA-containing fractions were precipitated with ethanol and then subjected to digestion with chondroitinase AC II (67 milliunits/mg of HA) in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 6.0, at 37°C overnight. The digested mixture was further subjected to TSK gel HPLC. Two TSK G3000PWXL (7.8 mm × 30 cm, Tosoh) columns were linearly connected for the better separation. The columns were eluted with 0.2 M NH4HCO3 at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The absorbance was measured at 214 nm. The peptide-containing peak was eluted just before the main HA disaccharide peak. The first peak was collected and concentrated by lyophilization. The second HPLC using the same columns was carried out to completely remove a trace of the HA disaccharide product. The fractions containing the SHAP•HA binding region were collected and lyophilized. Further Purification of the SHAP•HA Binding Region by Reverse Phase HPLC-The SHAP•HA binding region was further purified by reverse phase HPLC. The column (TSK ODS-120T, 4.6 ×150 mm, Tosoh) was equilibrated with 0.06% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water. The peptides were eluted by an acetonitrile gradient 0 to 13% acetonitrile in 0.06% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and the absorbance was measured at 214 nm. Protein Sequence Analyses-Automated Edman degradation was carried out in an Applied Biosystems model 476A sequencer with on-line phenylthiohydantoin analysis using an Applied Biosystems model 120A HPLC apparatus. The instruments were operated as recommended in the user bulletins and manuals distributed by the manufacturer. Samples were dissolved in 1%-trifluoroacetic acid aqueous solution admixed with acetonitrile (3:7, v/v), typically at the concentration of 10 pmol/μl, and introduced by a mechanical infusion through a microsyringe into the electrospray needle at a flow rate of 1 μl/min. Negative ion ESI mass spectrometry was performed using a Finnigan MAT TSQ 700 triple stage quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ion source (Analytica of Branford). A potential difference of 3 kV was applied against the ground potential of the needle. Hot nitrogen gas was used as the counter gas to desolve sample droplets in the ion source. Argon gas was used at 0.13 Pa as the collision gas at 20 eV for CID-MS/MS spectra. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as indicated previously(21Yoneda M. Suzuki S. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5247-5257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of dehydro-disaccharides of hyaluronan, chondroitin, chondroitin 4-sulfate, and chondroitin 6-sulfate were performed as indicated elsewhere(37Habuchi O. Matsui Y. Kotoya Y. Aoyama Y. Yasuda Y. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21968-21974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Synovial fluid from knee joints of osteoarthritic patients was used as a source of the complex. Since the synovial fluid was highly viscous and contained a variety of proteins at high concentrations, dissociative conditions (in 4 M guanidine HCl solution) were used for purification. A series of three isopycnic centrifugations with initial densities of 1.35, 1.38, and 1.45 g/ml, respectively, were performed. The density and the contents of HA and protein of each fraction after the third centrifugation suggested the firm association of some proteins with HA (Fig. 1). Fraction nos. 4-10 which contained a constant ratio of protein to HA (about 0.06) were pooled, precipitated with ethanol, and stored as the SHAP•HA complex preparation. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting of the SHAP•HA complex thus prepared from human synovial fluid were performed to confirm that the complex was identical with the one prepared from the incubation mixture of human serum with HA as described previously (22Huang L. Yoneda M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26725-26730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Proteins in the preparation from the synovial fluid were retained in the starting gels of SDS-PAGE, indicating that the complex in the synovial fluid preparation remained undissociated under both dissociative conditions of 4 M guanidine HCl during the centrifugation and 1% (w/v) SDS during the PAGE (Fig. 2A). This was also the case with the SHAP•HA complex prepared from the incubation mixture of human serum with HA as described previously(22Huang L. Yoneda M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26725-26730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of both complex preparations with HA-degrading enzymes, such as protease-free Streptomyces hyaluronidase or chondroitinase AC II released the proteins that corresponded to HC1 and HC2 of ITI (two bands with the higher mobility and the lower mobility, respectively), judging from both the immunoreactivities and the mobilities of proteins in the gels (Fig. 2, B and C). Treatment with alkali (0.02 M NaOH) also caused their release from both the SHAP•HA complex preparations (Fig. 3). Therefore, synovial fluid of human arthritic patients contained a SHAP•HA complex that was identical in both molecular structure and properties to the complex produced by incubation of HA with serum. In addition, when the preparation of the SHAP•HA complex from the pathological synovial fluid was digested with V8-protease and then subjected to SDS-PAGE, two major peptide bands resulted which have partial N-amino acid sequences identical with HC1 and HC2 of human ITI, respectively (data not shown). Taken together, it is very likely that the protein-HA complex obtained from human synovial fluid corresponds to the SHAP•HA complex that we had described previously (22Huang L. Yoneda M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26725-26730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 3Alkali treatment of SHAP•HA complexes from human pathological synovial fluid and from the incubation mixture of human serum with hyaluronan. SHAP•HA complex isolated from pathological human synovial fluid was treated with 0.02 M NaOH for 0, 30, and 60 min (A). The complex from the incubation mixture of human serum and hyaluronan was subjected to the same treatment for 60 min (B). The samples after neutralization with acetic acid were treated with (+)/without (-) Streptomyces hyaluronidase and subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting the same way as described in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Intact ITI and metabolic products of ITI were also present in synovial fluid (data not shown). In our purification procedures, the SHAP•HA complex was recovered in the bottom fractions after the first and second CsCl isopycnic centrifugation, while ITI, PαI, and most of bikunin were in the upper fractions (data not shown). Complete separation from those proteoglycans were appraised by SDS-PAGE of the purified preparation before and after the treatment with either Streptomyces hyaluronidase or chondroitinase AC II and subsequent immunoblotting with anti-human ITI (Fig. 2). Since Streptomyces hyaluronidase degrades HA only while the chondroitinase degrades both HA and chondroitin sulfate, the fact that no distinctive difference was observed in the immunostaining pattern of protein bands between the Streptomyces hyaluronidase- and chondroitinase AC II-treated samples indicated that the purified preparation from the synovial fluid was neither contaminated with ITI nor with PαI. The slight difference in mobility of the stained bands between the two samples could be explained by the difference in size of the products between the two enzymes. It is known that major digestion products of HA with Streptomyces hyaluronidase are tetramers and hexamers while the chondroitinase AC II digestion of HA yields dimers. In addition, there were also some differences between the Coomassie Blue staining and immunostaining patterns (Fig. 2, A and B). These differences could be explained by the apparent differences in the immunoreactivity of the anti-human ITI antibodies between HC1 and HC2. Since DNA has a density similar to HA in the CsCl centrifugation, the possibility that the SHAP•HA complex preparation was contaminated with DNA was not excluded. If this be the case, the DNA might disturb the subsequent processes. Therefore, the preparation was first subjected to DNase I digestion. The SHAP•HA complex was then digested with thermolysin. It was also possible that the bound HA protects SHAP from proteolysis(21Yoneda M. Suzuki S. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5247-5257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a high enzyme/substrate ratio (1:40 in weight) and a long incubation time (9 h) were used to ensure complete digestion. The HA-containing products were purified by CsCl isopycnic centrifugations. The products were further digested with chondroitinase AC II overnight. In our preliminary test Streptomyces hyaluronidase digestion yielded not only different sizes of HA oligosaccharides (tetramers and hexamers) but also the SHAP•HA binding regions with these HA oligosaccharides, which caused difficulties in subsequent separation and purification of the binding regions from free HA oligosaccharides and those from each other. The digestion with chondroitinase AC II, instead, yielded the SHAP•HA binding regions containing only unsaturated disaccharide of HA. Subsequent HPLC on linearly connected two TSK gel columns gave a successful resolution of the binding regions from the HA disaccharide (Fig. 4A, peak I for the binding regions and peak II for the HA disaccharide plus salt). The binding regions were rechromatographed onto the same column to ensure the complete separation from the HA disaccharide (Fig. 4B, peak 1 for the binding regions, peak 2 for the residual HA disaccharide, and peak 3 for buffer salt). The chromatography of peak II in Fig. 4A on SAX 10 column (37Habuchi O. Matsui Y. Kotoya Y. Aoyama Y. Yasuda Y. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21968-21974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that none of any disaccharide products derived from chondroitin, chondroitin 4-sulfate and chondroitin 6-sulfate other than the HA disaccharide was detected in this fraction, judging from the elution positions of the standard disaccharides (data not shown). The result further confirmed no contamination with ITI and PαI in the SHAP•HA complex prepared from the human synovial fluid. Further purification of the SHAP•HA binding regions was performed by applying the peak 1 from the second TSK gel HPLC onto C18 reverse phase HPLC. Elution with an acetonitrile gradient as described in the experimental procedures yielded 12 major peaks detected by the absorption at 214 nm and numbered by numerical order (Fig. 5). Amino acid sequences of peptides, if any, in each peak of the reverse phase HPLC were determined by an automated amino acid sequencer. Peaks 1, 2, 8, 9, and 12 did not contain any detectable amino acid residues. The amino acid sequences determined for peaks 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 11 are shown in Table 1. The fourth cycle for the shorter peptides and the seventh cycle for the longer peptides gave no peak corresponding to any standard amino acid residue under the employed conditions. Although there were other possibilities, the result suggested a modification of the C-terminal amino acid residues of those peptides. The residues might be covalently linked to hyaluronan in a similar way to the binding of the heavy chains to the chondroitin sulfate chain of bikunin in ITI family molecules(30Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Hefta S.A. Th⊘gersen I.B. Rutherford S. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 747-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Th⊘gersen I.B. Valnickova I. Pizzo S.V. Hefta S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8711-8716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In comparison with the C-terminal sequences of the heavy chains of human ITI and PαI, the C-terminal amino acid residue of each peptide might be Asp. In such a case, the SHAP•HA binding regions in those peaks would be expected to contain three different C-terminal tetrapeptides derived from HC1, HC2, and HC3, respectively, and a longer heptapeptide derived from HC1 (Table 2). As a whole, of the SHAP•HA complexes in human pathological synovial fluid, SHAPs were considered to be derived mostly from HC1 and HC2 of ITI and less from HC3 of PαI (Table 2).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Structures of SHAP•HA binding regions were studied by ESI-MS and ESI CID-MS/MS in the negative ion mode. Peaks 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 11 of C18 reverse phase HPLC (see Fig. 5) were subjected to the analyses. ESI-MS was tried first in the positive ion mode, but clear spectra were not obtained. On the other hand, the negative ion mode provided prominent molecular ions at m/z 835 for peak 4, at m/z 808 for peak 5, at m/z 835 and 764 for peak 6, at m/z 808 for peak 7, and at m/z 1065 for peaks 10 and 11, respectively (data not shown). No significant molecular ion was obtained around the molecular ion region at m/z 600-1100 for peak 3, suggesting that major molecules in peak 3 may not be related to the expected molecules. Molecular masses thus obtained were all 361 atomic mass units higher than the calculated molecular masses of (M - H)- for respective peptides, and this increment in the molecular masses appeared to correspond to the covalent glycosylation by a dehydrohexulonosyl N-acetylhexosamine (see Table 2). Further structural studies were carried out by CID-MS/MS having the (M - H)- as precursors for samples of peak 6 (m/z 835) and peak 7 (m/z 808) (Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, respectively). Daughter ions at m/z 227, 341, 358, 456, and 474 for peak 6 represented the tetrapeptide sequences as (VE)-N-D, while ions at m/z 212, 313, and 429 for peak 7 similarly indicated the structure as (VD)-T-D. Lacking a negative charge center, the N-terminal valine did not give a negative daughter ion as a single unit. Ring-opening daughter ions at m/z 501 and 559 shown in Fig. 6 for peak 6 suggested that the peptide VEND- was covalently linked to the C6-hydroxyl group of the N-acetylhexosamine. In addition, the above-mentioned carboxylate ion at m/z 474 for peak 6 suggested that the linkage was an ester between one of the carboxylates of Asp and the C6-hydroxyl group of the N-acetylhexosamine, rather than an amide (see Fig. 6, inset). On the other hand, peak 7 did not give the carboxylate ion at the ester linkage. However, the ion at m/z 489 in Fig. 7 again indicated a structure in which the peptide was linked to the C6-hydroxyl group of the N-acetylhexosamine. Daughter ions at m/z 659 for peak 6 (Fig. 6) and at m/z 632 (with m/z 614) for peak 7 (Fig. 7) indicated an elimination of the terminal dehydroxyhexulonic acid, which suggests that the sugar unit directly linked to the peptides is N-acetylhexosamine in both samples. Thus, the negative charge was found localized in an acidic side chains in the peptides, and the sugar side negative ions were not observed.Figure 7Negative ion ESI CID-MS/MS of the Peak 7 sample. Precursor ion: (M - H)- at m/z 808. The inset shows proposed fragmentations. Weak signals from m/z 700-900 are mostly due to instrument noise.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CID MS/MS analysis of (M - H)- at m/z 764 in peak 6 suggested that the same linkage occurs between HC3 and the HA disaccharide (data not shown). However, its limited sample amount prevented us from carrying out detailed structural studies. Taken together, the analyses demonstrated linkages between the C-6 of the reducing terminal N-acetylhexosamine residue of HA disaccharide and a carboxyl group of the C-terminal aspartic acid of the peptides derived from the heavy chains, HC1, HC2, and HC3 of ITI and PαI. Enghild et al.(30Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Hefta S.A. Th⊘gersen I.B. Rutherford S. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 747-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Enghild J.J. Salvesen G.

Chem. 1993; 268: 8711-8716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that three different heavy chains (HC1, HC2, and HC3) were covalently linked to bikunin by chondroitin sulfate chain in ITI and PαI. We have shown in this study that a similar linkage structure exists between SHAPs (HC1, HC2, and HC3) and HA. Mass spectrometic analyses revealed esterification of the carboxyl group of the C-terminal Asp with C-6 hydroxyl group of reducing terminal N-acetylhexosamine of the unsaturated HA disaccharide. Thus, we conclude that SHAPs (heavy chains of ITI and PαI) are covalently linked to HA by the esterification with the C6-hydroxyl groups of N-acetylglucosamine of HA via the C-terminal Asp. The present study using ESI CID-MS/MS technique did not provide information to show which of the two carboxylate groups in the C-terminal Asp participated in the ester linkage formation. This is because the low energy collision-induced dissociation in the quadrupole instrument under our conditions failed to cleave C-C bonds in the aspartic acid. We assume tentatively that the α-carboxylate is the one which covalently bonds to the C6-hydroxyl group of the N-acetylhexosamine by an ester linkage, by analogy to the previously reported structure for the interchain linkage between the heavy chains and the light chain (bikunin core protein) via a chondroitin sulfate chain originating from the light chain in ITI or PαI(30Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Hefta S.A. Th⊘gersen I.B. Rutherford S. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 747-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Th⊘gersen I.B. Valnickova I. Pizzo S.V. Hefta S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8711-8716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that SHAP•HA complex may be formed simply by transferring the heavy chains from the chondroitin sulfate to HA (substitution reaction of HA for the chondroitin sulfate). However, the mechanism for the reaction has not been determined yet. We noted that two fractions with different retention time in reverse phase HPLC contained peptides with the identical amino acid sequence (for example, peaks 4 and 6 in Table 1 and Table 2). Since there was no significant difference observed between those two fractions by peptide sequencing or by ESI CID-MS/MS, this could be due to difference of the anomeric configuration of hydroxyl group at the reducing end (α and β) of the HA disaccharide. In mouse ovulation, preovulatory synthesis of hyaluronan within the cumulus mass plays an important role for cumulus expansion(8Chen L. Russell P.T. Larsen W.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1993; 34: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Recently, Chen et al.(38Chen L. Mao S.J.T. Larsen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12380-12386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Chen L. Mao S.J.T. McLean L.R. Powers R.W. Larsen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 269: 28282-28287Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) reported that the cumulus extracellular matrix stabilizing factor in fetal bovine serum is a member of the ITI family, and that stabilizing ability is achieved through its direct binding to HA, which is sensitive to ionic strength and has a dissociation constant of 1.9 × 10-8M at pH 7.2. Therefore, the properties of the interaction of cumulus extracellular matrix stabilizing factor with HA appear to be different from those for the formation of SHAP•HA complex. The tight binding of ITI to HA in human pathological synovial fluid was firstly reported in 1965(40Sandson J. Hamerman D. Schwick G. Trans. Assoc. Am. Physician. 1965; 78: 304-313PubMed Google Scholar). The present results show that the formation of a covalent linkage is involved in this binding. TSG-6, a 35-kDa glycoprotein of the proteoglycan tanden repeat HA-binding family, also exists in pathological synovial fluid of patients with arthritis(41Wisniewski H.-G. Maier R. Lotz M. Lee S. Klampfer L. Lee T.H. Vilcek J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6593-6601PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Wisniewski et al.(20Wisniewski H.-G. Burgess W.H. Oppenheim J.D. Vilcek J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7423-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) have shown that TSG-6 forms a covalently bound complex (120 kDa) with serum ITI. This TSG-6•ITI complex was formed rapidly even in the apparent absence of other proteins at 37°C, but not at 4°C. TSG-6 appeared to form a direct covalent bond to the chondroitin 4-sulfate chain of ITI for the stability of the TSG•ITI complex(20Wisniewski H.-G. Burgess W.H. Oppenheim J.D. Vilcek J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7423-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In our study, we have not detected any peptides derived from TSG-6 in the SHAP•HA binding regions prepared from human pathological synovial fluid. Therefore, TSG-6 may not be involved in the formation of SHAP•HA complex in synovial fluid. It is interesting to note that the formation of the SHAP•HA complex from HA and ITI or PαI is accompanied by the release of bikunin. Bikunin contains two tandem repeats of Kunitz-type domains, and the trypsin inhibitor activity of ITI is localized in this part(23Gebhard W. Hochstrasser K. Barrett A.J. Salvesen G. Proteinase Inhibitors. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1986: 375-388Google Scholar, 42Reisinger P. Hochstrasser K. Abrecht G.J. Lempart K. Sailer J.-P. Biol. Chem.

Bikunin is also identified in urine as UTI (urinary trypsin inhibitor), which was shown to be a urine proteoglycan with molecular mass ranging from 40 to 45 kDa(43Balduyck M. Mizon C. Loutfi H.

https://openalex.org/W1963921090,"Our prior work established that comparable concentrations of <i>N</i>-acetylcysteine (NAC) both block the proliferation of PC12 cells and prevent death of trophic factor-deprived sympathetic neurons and PC12 cells. The present work addresses several aspects of the mechanisms of these actions. NAC increases intracellular levels of glutathione (GSH) by approximately 10-fold in PC12 cells. However, blockade of this increase by treatment with buthionine sulfoximine did not affect either promotion of survival or inhibition of DNA synthesis. Thus, these actions of NAC are independent of its effects on intracellular GSH. NAC's actions in our system do not appear to be dependent on its anti-oxidant/radical scavenger properties, but may be due to its activity as a reductant. Consistent with this, several other reducing agents, the most effective of which was 2,3-dimercaptopropanol, mimicked NAC in blocking DNA synthesis and suppressing death of PC12 cells and sympathetic neurons. Finally, we observed that in striking contrast to nerve growth factor and a number of other trophic agents, the survival-promoting effects of NAC on PC12 cells are blocked by actinomycin D. This suggests that NAC may act by inducing specific gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2010302368,"Although a number of eukaryotic DNA helicases have been identified biochemically and still more have been inferred from the amino acid sequences of the products of cloned genes, none of the cellular helicases or putative helicases has to date been implicated in eukaryotic chromosomal DNA replication. By the same token, numerous eukaryotic replication proteins have been identified, but none of these is a helicase. We have recently identified and characterized a temperature-sensitive yeast mutant, dna2ts, defective in DNA replication, and have cloned the corresponding gene (Kuo, C.-L., Huang, C.-H., and Campbell, J. L.(1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 30, 6465-6469; Budd, M. E., and Campbell, J. L.(1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 7642-7646). The DNA2 gene is essential and encodes a 172-kDa protein with DNA helicase motifs in its C-terminal half and an N-terminal half with no similarity to any previously described protein (Budd, M. E., and Campbell, J. L.(1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 7642-7646). Here we show that the helicase domain is required in vivo and that a 3′ to 5′ DNA helicase activity specific for forked substrates is intrinsic to the Dna2p. The N terminus is also essential for DNA replication. Thus, the structure of this new helicase is different from all previously characterized replicative helicases, which is consistent with the complex organization of eukaryotic replication forks, where the activities of not one but three essential DNA polymerases must be coordinated. Although a number of eukaryotic DNA helicases have been identified biochemically and still more have been inferred from the amino acid sequences of the products of cloned genes, none of the cellular helicases or putative helicases has to date been implicated in eukaryotic chromosomal DNA replication. By the same token, numerous eukaryotic replication proteins have been identified, but none of these is a helicase. We have recently identified and characterized a temperature-sensitive yeast mutant, dna2ts, defective in DNA replication, and have cloned the corresponding gene (Kuo, C.-L., Huang, C.-H., and Campbell, J. L.(1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 30, 6465-6469; Budd, M. E., and Campbell, J. L.(1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 7642-7646). The DNA2 gene is essential and encodes a 172-kDa protein with DNA helicase motifs in its C-terminal half and an N-terminal half with no similarity to any previously described protein (Budd, M. E., and Campbell, J. L.(1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 7642-7646). Here we show that the helicase domain is required in vivo and that a 3′ to 5′ DNA helicase activity specific for forked substrates is intrinsic to the Dna2p. The N terminus is also essential for DNA replication. Thus, the structure of this new helicase is different from all previously characterized replicative helicases, which is consistent with the complex organization of eukaryotic replication forks, where the activities of not one but three essential DNA polymerases must be coordinated. A DNA helicase is a central component of the architecture of prokaryotic DNA replication forks. Reconstitution of the basal apparatus for replication of the SV40 virus has established the requirement for a DNA helicase in eukaryotic DNA replication as well. However, SV40 DNA replication requires only the helicase associated with the viral large T antigen and no cellular helicase. Therefore, we have looked for a cellular replicative helicase using yeast genetic analysis. Recently, we characterized a gene, DNA2, which complements a temperature-sensitive yeast strain defective in the elongation stage of DNA replication(1Kuo C.-L. Huang C.-H. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6465-6469Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 2Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The DNA2 gene is essential for viability and encodes a 1522-amino acid protein, the most prominent feature of which is the presence of the six conserved motifs characteristic of DNA helicases. These motifs are localized to the COOH third of the protein (amino acids 1035-1522). In order to demonstrate that the protein had helicase activity, the HA-Dna2 protein was purified 50,000-fold. The immunoaffinity-purified protein was shown to be associated with a DNA-dependent ATPase and a DNA helicase. Interestingly, the helicase is active only on a substrate with a forked structure, as is true of many prokaryotic and viral replicative helicases and appears to translocate in the 3′ to 5′ direction, the polarity of the leading strand at a replication fork (2Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). While these experiments suggest that Dna2p is a replicative helicase, they are preliminary in two ways. First, although mock purifications yield no ATPase or helicase activity, our biochemical approach could not rule out that the ATPase and helicase activities were copurifying with, rather than intrinsic to, the Dna2p. Second, because more than two-thirds of the protein sequence was not conserved in any known helicase and might therefore encode some novel replicative function, our previous results did not allow us to conclude that the essential role of Dna2p in replication was that of a helicase. An example of a DNA-dependent ATPase and helicase whose essential function may not require the helicase activity of the protein is the Rad3 protein. Rad3 is essential for viability and is required for both nucleotide excision repair and for mRNA transcription. When the conserved lysine of the ATP-binding site, GKT, is changed to arginine, the protein loses its DNA dependent-ATPase and helicase. The resulting rad3 mutant is sensitive to UV irradiation but is viable(3Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.G. Bardwell L. Bardwell A.J. Buratowski S. Gulyas K.D. Donahue T.F. Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D.

Thus, the helicase appears to be required for nucleotide excission repair but seems to be dispensable for the essential function of RAD3 in transcription. In this paper, we show that a helicase activity is intrinsic to the Dna2p and that the helicase is required for its in vivo function.

In the plasmids used pJDgal:DNA2K has the DNA2 gene (amino acids 105-1522) cloned into the EcoRI site of pJDgal (5Dohmen R.J. Madura K. Bartel B. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7351-7355Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and pJDgal:DNA2E has the DNA2 gene with codon 1080 changed to glutamate by site-directed mutagenesis and then cloned into the plasmid pJDgal at the EcoRI site. DNA sequencing verified that only one change had occurred. pGAL18-Dna2HA has the Dna2 gene (amino acids 105-1522) cloned into the EcoRI site of pGAL18. All plasmids encode DNA2 genes with the hemagglutinin epitope fused in frame to methionine 105. The first 105 amino acids are dispensable for function (see text). HA-Dna2 protein was purified from BJ5459 cells transformed with pGAL18-Dna2HA or pJDgal:DNA2E. Transformed cells were grown in 2% synthetic raffinose media to 107 cells/ml, galactose was added to 2%, and cells were harvested after 6 h. Frozen cells (3-4 g) were lysed in buffer containing 10% glycerol, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.025 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mM DTT, 1The abbreviations used are: DTTdithiothreitolkbkilobase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reaction. by grinding with a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen. A sample (3 g) was thawed, and protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM benzamidine, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) were added. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min. NaCl was added to 1 M, and polyethylene glycol 8000 was added to 6% to remove DNA. After 15 min, extracts were centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatant (25 mg of protein) was loaded onto a 20-ml hydroxyapatite column. The column was washed with 10 ml of 25 mM KPO4, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, and 3 mM DTT and then eluted with 0.2 M KPO4, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 3 mM DTT. Protein was then purified by immunoaffinity chromatography as described previously(2Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). dithiothreitol kilobase pair(s) polymerase chain reaction. The ATPase reactions (20 μl) contained 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.2 mM [α-32P]ATP, 2.5 mM DTT, and 0.2 mg/ml poly(dA) as indicated and were incubated at 37°C for the times indicated. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 8 μl of 20 mM EDTA containing 40 mM ATP, 40 mM ADP as markers. Reaction mix (1-2 μl) was spotted on a polyethyleneimine plate and developed by ascending chromatography with 1 M HCOOH, 0.4 M LiCl. The plates were autoradiographed, and spots corresponding to ATP and ADP were excised and radioactivity determined. The helicase assay measures displacement of a labeled 38-base oligonucleotide hybridized to M13 DNA over 24 bases and having a 14-nucleotide 5′ noncomplementary tail as described(2Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The occurrence of a helicase domain does not in itself mean that it is part of the essential function of a gene. For instance, the helicase activity of the Rad3 protein is dispensable for its role in mRNA transcription(3Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.G. Bardwell L. Bardwell A.J. Buratowski S. Gulyas K.D. Donahue T.F. Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1993; 75: 1379-1387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 4Naumovski L. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1218-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the helicase domain of Dna2p contributed to its essential physiological function, the invariant lysine 1080 in the major GX4GK(T/S) nucleotide-binding loop was changed to glutamic acid. The lysine is essential for binding the β,g-phosphate of ATP or GTP(6Traut T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The ability of wild-type and ATPase mutant genes to complement the dna2-1ts strain and a dna2Δ deletion strain was then assessed. As shown in Fig. 1, dna2-1ts cells transformed with the Dna2K (wild-type) plasmid are complemented for growth at 37°C, but cells transformed with the Dna2E (mutant) plasmid are not. Wild-type cells transformed with Dna2E grow normally (data not shown). In order to establish that the mutant Dna2E protein could not support growth when it was the only form of Dna2p in the cell, the DNA2/dna2Δ strain, used previously to demonstrate that DNA2 was essential(2Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), was transformed with both wild-type pJDgal:DNA2K and mutant pJDgal:DNA2E plasmids. The transformants were sporulated and tetrads analyzed. Transformants carrying pJDgal:DNA2K gave four viable spores in all tetrads, while pJDgal:DNA2E failed to complement dna2Δ spores, giving rise to 2 viable and 2 inviable spores in each tetrad. Interestingly, the dna2Δ strain transformed with pJDgal:DNA2K grew on glucose as well as on the inducing carbon source galactose. In contrast, the pJDgal:DNA2K plasmid complemented dna2-1ts strains only after induction on galactose (Fig. 1). This suggests that when expression of the wild-type Dna2 protein is low, the dna2-1ts protein may exhibit a dominant negative effect, perhaps by forming inactive heteroallelic oligomers containing a mixture of wild-type and mutant protein. Since the dna2-1ts mutation is recessive in a heterozygous diploid and since pJDgal:DNA2K complements the dna2-1ts strain when grown with galactose, raising the level of wild-type Dna2 protein eliminates the possible dominant negative effect of dna2-1ts protein. The Dna2E mutant was then used to verify that the Dna2 protein had helicase activity. Both the wild-type (HA-Dna2K) and the mutant proteins (HA-Dna2E) were expressed in yeast as hemagglutinin epitope fusion proteins under the control of the inducible GAL10 promoter. Dna2p was partially purified, immunoprecipitated with the hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody 12CA5 from the 0.2 M hydroxyapatite eluant, and assayed for DNA-dependent ATPase activity (Fig. 2). The HA-Dna2K protein converted ATP to ADP and Pi, and the activity was dependent on the addition of DNA, as expected for a DNA helicase. The mutant HA-Dna2E protein, however, exhibited no ATPase activity. Similar amounts of the respective HA-tagged Dna2 proteins were shown to be present in both immunoprecipitates, verifying that the mutant protein was expressed at levels equivalent to wild-type protein (Fig. 2). Thus, the Dna2p is a DNA-dependent ATPase. Both wild-type and mutant protein were purified further and assayed for DNA helicase activity (Fig. 3). We had previously shown that a 3′ to 5′ DNA helicase specific for the forked substrate shown in Fig. 3 copurified from yeast with HA-Dna2p through all steps. Despite many attempts, however, we were not able to completely remove contaminating proteins, preventing us from determining whether the helicase was intrinsic to or merely associated with the HA-Dna2p(2Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, DNA helicase activity is observed with purified wild-type HA-Dna2K protein (Fig. 3, lane 2) but not with the mutant HA-Dna2E protein (Fig. 3, lane 3). Thus, DNA helicase activity is intrinsic to the Dna2 protein. (Interestingly, a structure-specific nuclease activity, which preferentially degrades a substrate with the configuration shown in Fig. 3(2Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), is also present in these highly purified preparations (see below). The nuclease is not affected by the lysine to glutamate mutation, as expected, since ATP is not required for nuclease activity (2Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).) The complementation of the ts mutant and the deletion mutant taken together demonstrate that the DNA-dependent ATPase and helicase activity of Dna2p is required for its essential role in DNA replication. It was therefore of interest to ask whether the dna2-1ts mutation affected the helicase domain. The site of the dna2-1ts mutation was mapped using a marker rescue technique we previously used to locate temperature-sensitive mutations of the POL1 gene, encoding DNA polymerase α (Fig. 4)(7Budd M.E. Wittrup K.D. Bailey J.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing (see Fig. 4) revealed a single amino acid change of proline 504 to serine (CCT to TCT), placing the dna2-1ts mutation in the N-terminal portion of the protein, far from the essential helicase domain (amino acids 1070-1522). Thus, the Dna2p appears to be composed of at least two domains, both required in vivo. Nevertheless, intraallelic complementation of the GAL10-expressed ATPase mutant protein in the dna2-1ts strain did not occur (Fig. 1), suggesting that the functional domains of the Dna2 protein cannot act in trans in vivo. Both sequence conservation and deletion analysis also support an important role for the N-terminal domain. Dna2p is similar over its entire length to the human ha3631 gene product, an open reading frame derived from DNA sequence (accession no. D42046), having 34% overall amino acid sequence identity and 55% similarity to Dna2p(2Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The proline changed by the dna2-1ts mutation is conserved between the Dna2 protein and the ha3631 open reading frame and falls in an N-terminal 20-amino acid stretch that is 55% identical and 98% similar to the human ha3631 gene product. Such strong conservation suggests that the proline and surrounding motif are functionally important. Preparation of a series of deletions into the Dna2 protein was described previously(2Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Deletion of only 25 amino acids at the C terminus results in a protein unable to complement the dna2-1ts mutation. Deletion of 105 amino acids from the N terminus leads to a protein that can complement both the dna2-1ts mutation and a dna2Δ strain and that is active as a helicase(2Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, deletion of an additional 25 amino acids inactivates the protein. What is the role of the N terminus? The sequence does not contain motifs characteristic of any class of protein with known function. It may be essential for helicase activity. Alternatively, it may not contribute directly to the catalytic activity of the helicase but may rather serve as a site of protein/protein interactions. If Dna2 protein is oligomeric, as many helicases are, then association of monomers might be destabilized in the dna2-1ts protein. The partial dominant negative effect described above may suggest an oligomeric structure, in analogy with phage T7 gene 4 mutants(8Notarnicola S.M. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27198-27207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is also possible that the N-terminal domain is required for interaction with other replication proteins. Preliminary evidence suggests that Dna2 protein interacts with the product of another yeast replication gene, the YKL510/RAD27 gene, a homolog of human FEN1 endonuclease, which is involved in processing of Okazaki pieces in the SV40 in vitro replication system (9Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 10Reagan M.S. Pittenger C. Siede W. Friedberg E.C. J.

The YKL510/Rad27 nuclease copurifies with Dna2 helicase through all purification steps (Fig. 3). 2M. E. Budd and J. L. Campbell, unpublished data. Furthermore, a plasmid that overexpresses the YKL510 (RAD27) gene suppresses the dna2-1ts mutation but not dna2Δ.2 Such high copy suppression is considered genetic evidence for interaction of the corresponding gene products in vivo. A deletion of the RAD27 gene results in a strain with temperature-sensitive growth(10Reagan M.S. Pittenger C. Siede W. Friedberg E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 364-371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sommers C.H. Miller E.J. Dujon B. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4193-4196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).2 Thus, the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the dna2-1ts strain may result from an inability of the mutant protein to interact with RAD27 or an additional nuclease involved in Okazaki fragment processing. Even if the latter hypothesis is correct, it is likely that additional factors contribute to the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the dna2-1ts mutation, since dna2-1ts strains exhibit less DNA synthesis at 37°C than rad27Δ strains(2Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 10Reagan M.S. Pittenger C. Siede W. Friedberg E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 364-371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At this stage of characterization of Dna2p, it is hard to predict its precise mechanistic role in DNA replication. The 3′ to 5′ directionality might suggest that unwinding at a chromosomal fork may be coordinated with polymerization of the leading strand. Given the complexity of the eukaryotic replication fork, the requirement for a 3′ to 5′ helicase does not exclude a role for additional helicases in yeast chromosomal DNA replication, including at least one that, like the prokaryotic primosomal helicases, has a 5′ to 3′ polarity."

Together, these molecules have important roles in the catabolism of lipoproteins, proteinases, proteinase-inhibitor complexes, and matrix proteins (for reviews, see (5Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

The members of this receptor family share structural motifs including cysteine-rich epidermal growth factor-like repeats, cysteine-rich ligand binding repeats, repeats containing the tetrapeptide sequence tyrosine-tryptophan-threonine-aspartic acid, and an asparagine-proline-X-tyrosine sequence within the cytoplasmic tail, which is responsible for endocytic signaling in coated pits.The most recently identified member of this receptor family is the VLDL receptor(2Takahashi S. Kawarabayasi Y. Nakai T. Sakai J. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9252-9256Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), so named because it appeared to specifically bind VLDL, probably via interaction with apolipoprotein E (apo E). At present, however, the physiological role of the VLDL receptor is uncertain. This receptor is most abundant in skeletal muscle, heart, adipose tissue, and brain(9Gåfvels M.E. Caird M. Britt D.

This fact, and the observation that the VLDL receptor recognizes apo E-containing lipoproteins, has led to the hypothesis that the VLDL receptor may play an important role in the delivery of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins to peripheral tissues(8Yamamoto T. Takahashi S. Sakai J. Kawarabayasi Y. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1993; 3: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).

It has been suggested that LpL may play an important role in conjunction with the VLDL receptor in the catabolism of lipoproteins(8Yamamoto T. Takahashi S. Sakai J. Kawarabayasi Y. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1993; 3: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).A chicken receptor has been identified that is responsible for the endocytosis of VLDL and vitellogenin(13Bujo H. Hermann M.O. Kaderli M. Jacobsen L. Surawara S. Yamamoto T. Schneider W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5165-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The primary sequence of this receptor has a high degree of similarity with that of the mammalian VLDL receptors, indicating that it represents a chicken homologue. Insight into a function for the chicken VLDL receptor has been gained by identifying a mutant hen that is missing this receptor. Hens with this defect are characterized by hereditary hyperlipidemia and the absence of egg laying(14Nimpf J. Radosavljevic M.J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1393-1398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the chicken VLDL receptor plays a critical role in mediating the transport of triglycerides into growing oocytes.Recently, Battey et al.(15Battey F. Gåfvels M.E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23268-23273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) discovered that a 39-kDa protein, termed the receptor-associated protein (RAP), binds with high affinity to the VLDL receptor and regulates its ligand binding properties. RAP was discovered when it copurified with LRP during ligand affinity chromatography(16Ashcom J.D. Tiller S.E. Dickerson K. Cravens J.L. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 17Jensen P.H. Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). While the biological function of RAP remains unknown, it binds tightly to LRP, gp330, and the VLDL receptor and modulates their ligand binding activities(15Battey F. Gåfvels M.E. Fitzgerald D.J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 21162-21166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The localization of RAP within the endoplasmic reticulum (21Biemesderfer D. Dekan G. Aronson P.S. Farquhar M.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F1011-F1020PubMed Google Scholar) and studies in which the RAP gene was disrupted in mice (22Willnow T.E. Armstrong S.A. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4537-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) suggest that RAP may play an important role in the early processing of these receptors, perhaps in preventing association of the newly synthesized receptors with ligands or in regulating receptor transport or trafficking to the cell surface.The high affinity interaction between RAP and the VLDL receptor suggested that the VLDL receptor, like LRP and gp330, may interact with additional ligands, and the present studies were undertaken to more fully define the ligand binding characteristics of this newly discovered receptor. These studies demonstrate that the VLDL receptor is a multiligand receptor and may play an important role in lipoprotein catabolism, by binding and internalizing both VLDL and lipoprotein lipase, and in proteinase catabolism, by mediating the cellular uptake of urokinase (uPA) complexed to its inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor type I (PAI-1).DISCUSSIONThe VLDL receptor is a newly discovered member of the LDL receptor family whose domain organization is remarkably similar to that of the LDL receptor, with the exception that the VLDL receptor contains an additional copy of a cysteine-rich ligand binding repeat. Despite similarities in the structure of these two receptors, a notable difference in their ligand binding properties exists. The LDL receptor binds and internalizes apo B-100 (LDL) or apo E-containing lipoproteins such as intermediate density lipoprotein, β-migrating VLDL, and VLDL (5Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4304) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the VLDL receptor recognizes apo E-containing lipoproteins but only binds weakly to LDL(2Takahashi S. Kawarabayasi Y. Nakai T. Sakai J. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9252-9256Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The differences in ligand binding properties of these two receptors were further highlighted when recent studies found that RAP binds with high affinity to the VLDL receptor (Kd = 0.7 nM) (15Battey F. Gåfvels M.E. Fitzgerald D.J. Argraves W.S. Chappell D.A. Strauss III, J.F. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23268-23273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but binds weakly to the LDL receptor (Kd = 300 nM)(36Medh J.D. Fry G.L. Bowen S.L. Pladet M.W. Strickland D.K. Chappell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 536-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Since the biological role of the VLDL receptor is not fully understood, the present investigation was initiated to gain insight into its function by further characterizing the ligand binding properties of this receptor.The strategy that was employed to measure the capacity of the VLDL receptor to mediate the cellular internalization of ligands involved introducing the VLDL receptor gene into a cell line deficient in this receptor and demonstrating an enhanced uptake of ligands in those cells expressing the VLDL receptor. A murine fibroblast cell line (26Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) genetically deficient in LRP was utilized for this purpose. An adenoviral vector was chosen to introduce the gene for the VLDL receptor into these cells since adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to mammalian cells in culture has proven to be a highly effective means for introducing genes into a variety of cells(37Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting and RAP ligand blotting experiments confirmed that infection of the PEA13 fibroblasts with Ad-VLDLR led to high levels of expression of this receptor.Using fibroblasts infected with Ad-VLDLR, we documented the ability of the VLDL receptor to mediate the cellular internalization and subsequent degradation of LpL. In this regard, the VLDL receptor is similar to other members of the LDL receptor family, such as LRP and gp330, both of which bind LpL and mediate its cellular catabolism(31Chappell D.A. Fry G.L.

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14176-14181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, Takahashi et al. (39Takahashi S. Suzuki J. Kohno M. Oida K. Tamai T. Miyabo S. Yamamoto T. Nakai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15747-15754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that both LpL and apo E enhance the binding of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins to the VLDL receptor, an effect that has also been noted on LRP-mediated uptake and degradation of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins(40Chappell D.A. Fry G.L. Waknitz M.A. Muhonen L.E. Pladet M.W. Iverius P.-H. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14168-14175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LpL is a key enzyme involved in lipoprotein metabolism and is synthesized by parenchymal cells, such as adipocytes(41Olivecrona T. Chernick S.S. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Garrison M. Scow R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10748-10759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A significant portion of newly synthesized LpL appears to be degraded(42Cisar L. Hoogewerf A.J. Cupp M. Rapport C.A. Bensadoun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1767-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while the remainder is secreted and transferred by an unknown mechanism to nearby vascular endothelium, where it remains bound through interaction with membrane-associated heparan sulfate chains(43Bensadoun A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1991; 11: 217-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 44Stins M.F. Sivaram P. Sasaki A. Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1853-1861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins bind transiently to LpL at the vascular endothelium, and the enzyme rapidly hydrolyzes triglycerides enabling tissues to utilize fatty acids from the lipoproteins, thereby transforming large lipoproteins, such as chylomicrons and VLDL into cholesterol-rich remnant lipoproteins, which can be taken up by the liver.In situ hybridization studies (34Multhaupt H.A.B. Jin H. Arenas-Elliot C. Strauss III, J.F. Gafvels M. Warhol M.J. McCrae K.P. Circulation. 1994; 90: 1-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) have detected VLDL receptor mRNA in human endothelium. These results have been confirmed by Northern blot analysis (29Wittmaack F.M. Gafvels M.E. Bronner M. Matsuo H. McCrae K.R. Tomaszewski J.E. Robinson S.L. Strickland D.K. Strauss III, J.F. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) of mRNA isolated from human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The present studies used RAP ligand blotting and immunoblotting techniques on cell extracts to confirm that the VLDL receptor is expressed in human endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. To assess the function of the VLDL receptor in mediating the internalization of ligands in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, 125I-labeled RAP was utilized as a ligand. These experiments revealed that the VLDL receptor appears to be functional in these cells since they rapidly internalize and degrade RAP. However, the role of the VLDL receptor in regulating levels of LpL on the endothelium at this time remains ambiguous, since variable results were obtained in our experiments. Possibly, this results from variable expression of the VLDL receptor in endothelial cells and the involvement of other cell surface molecules that bind LpL.In addition to its role in the catabolism of LpL and apoE-containing lipoproteins, the VLDL receptor may also play an important role in proteinase catabolism by binding and mediating the cellular internalization of uPA•PAI-1 complexes. uPA is synthesized by endothelial cells as a single chain zymogen, pro-uPA, that is converted to the active two chain enzyme (two chain-uPA) by proteolysis. The conversion of pro-uPA to active two chain-uPA is enhanced upon interaction with the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR). This molecule is a 55-kDa glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored cell surface protein (45Roldan A.L. Cubellis M.V. Masucci M.T. Behrendt N. Lund L.R. Dano K. Appella E. Blasi F.

Chem. 1991; 266: 1926-1933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that is localized on many cell types, including endothelial cells(47Haddock R.C. Spell M.L. Baker C.D. Grammer J.R. Parks J.M. Speidel M. Booyse F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21466-21473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to facilitating activation of pro-uPA, binding of u-PA to uPAR acts to localize uPA activity on the cell surface(48Ellis V. Dano K. Fibrinolysis. 1992; 6: 27-34Google Scholar), where it has been implicated in the process of pericellular proteolysis, cell migration, and tissue remodeling(49Blasi F. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). uPA activity is regulated by PAI-1, a rapidly acting inhibitor that is also produced by the endothelium(50Schleef R.R. Loskutoff D.J. Haemostasis. 1988; 18: 328-341PubMed Google Scholar).Once a complex between uPA and PAI-1 forms, it is rapidly internalized and degraded in a process mediated by LRP(33Herz J. Clouthier D.E. Hammer R.E. Cell. 1992; 71: 411-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 51Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Moller B. Jensen P.H. Moestrup S.K. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C. Munch M. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14543-14546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results of the present investigation confirm that the VLDL receptor, like LRP, can also mediate the cellular catabolism of uPA•PAI-1 complexes. This conclusion is supported by in vitro binding studies, which document a high affinity interaction between uPA•PAI-1 complexes and the purified VLDL receptor. RAP was shown to antagonize the binding. Further, cultured fibroblasts expressing the VLDL receptor following infection with Ad-VLDLR mediate cellular uptake of 125I-labeled uPA•PAI-1 complexes leading to their degradation. Thus, the VLDL receptor, like LRP (51Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Moller B. Jensen P.H. Moestrup S.K. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C. Munch M. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14543-14546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and gp330 (52Moestrup S.K. Nielsen S. Andreasen P. Jorgensen K.E. Nykjaer A. Roigaard H. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16564-16570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), binds to uPA•PAI-1 complexes and mediates their cellular uptake and degradation. This conclusion is supported by recent findings of Heegaard et al.(53Heegaard C.W. Simonsen A.C.W. Oka K. Kjoller L. Christensen A. Madsen B. Ellgaard L. Chan L. Andreasen P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20855-20861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The presence of the VLDL receptor on the vascular endothelium suggests a role for this receptor in regulating fibrinolysis, and our experiments suggest a major role for this receptor on the endothelium in regulating uPA•PAI-1 levels. However, it is apparent that other RAP-insensitive mechanisms exist on the vascular endothelium that contribute to the internalization of uPA•PAI-1 complexes.Both LRP and the VLDL receptor are able to mediate the cellular uptake of pro-uPA directly, although much less pro-uPA is internalized by either receptor when compared with uPA•PAI-1 complexes. This might relate to a decreased affinity of these receptors for pro-uPA when compared with uPA•PAI-1 complexes(28Kounnas M.Z. Henkin J. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21862-21867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nykjaer et al.(54Nykjaer A. Kjoller L. Cohen R.L. Lawrence D.A. Garni-Wagner B.A. Todd III, R.F. van Zonneveld A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25668-25676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that soluble uPAR blocked the binding of pro-uPA to LRP, suggesting that uPAR may protect pro-uPA from LRP-mediated internalization. This observation may also extend to the VLDL receptor and stresses that a major function of uPAR is to protect uPA from being internalized and subsequently degraded.In summary, the present studies have found that the VLDL receptor, like other members of the LDL receptor family, is a multiligand receptor and, in addition to apo E-containing lipoproteins, also binds and mediates the cellular catabolism of LpL as well as uPA•PAI-1 complexes. The present studies detected the VLDL receptor in endothelial cells, and cell uptake experiments suggest that the VLDL receptor plays an important role, along with other molecules, in the regulation of uPA•PAI-1 levels on the vascular endothelium.

Together, these molecules have important roles in the catabolism of lipoproteins, proteinases, proteinase-inhibitor complexes, and matrix proteins (for reviews, see (5Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

Med. 1993; 3: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)). The members of this receptor family share structural motifs including cysteine-rich epidermal growth factor-like repeats, cysteine-rich ligand binding repeats, repeats containing the tetrapeptide sequence tyrosine-tryptophan-threonine-aspartic acid, and an asparagine-proline-X-tyrosine sequence within the cytoplasmic tail, which is responsible for endocytic signaling in coated pits.The most recently identified member of this receptor family is the VLDL receptor(2Takahashi S. Kawarabayasi Y. Nakai T. Sakai J. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9252-9256Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), so named because it appeared to specifically bind VLDL, probably via interaction with apolipoprotein E (apo E). At present, however, the physiological role of the VLDL receptor is uncertain. This receptor is most abundant in skeletal muscle, heart, adipose tissue, and brain(9Gåfvels M.E. Caird M. Britt D.

Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 689-698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), tissues which metabolize fatty acids as an energy source. This fact, and the observation that the VLDL receptor recognizes apo E-containing lipoproteins, has led to the hypothesis that the VLDL receptor may play an important role in the delivery of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins to peripheral tissues(8Yamamoto T. Takahashi S. Sakai J. Kawarabayasi Y. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1993; 3: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a number of tissues that express high levels of the VLDL receptor also express lipoprotein lipase (LpL)(12Kirchgessner T.G. LeBoeuf R.C. Langner C.A. Zollman S. Chang C.H.

https://openalex.org/W2106780768,"This study examines the regulation of the human tissue factor (TF) promotor in vitro and in vivo. Transient transfections were performed in bovine aortic endothelial cells to investigate the role of two fundamentally different AP-1 sites and a closely located NF-κB site in the human TF promotor. The NF-κB site is functionally active, since overexpression of NF-κB(p65) resulted in induction of TF mRNA and activity. Promotor analysis showed that NF-κB induction was dependent on the integrity of the region from base pair −188 to −181. Overexpression of Jun/Fos resulted in TF induction of transcription and protein/activity. Functional studies revealed that the proximal AP-1 site, but not the distal, was inducible by Jun/Fos heterodimers. The distal AP-1 site, which has a G → A switch at position 4, was inducible by Jun homodimers. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays, using extracts of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-stimulated bovine aortic endothelial cells, demonstrated TNFα-inducible binding to the proximal AP-1 site, comprising JunD/Fos heterodimers. At the distal AP-1 site, only minor induction of binding activity, characterized as proteins of the Jun and ATF family, was observed. Consistently, this site only marginally participates in TNFα induction. Functional studies with TF promotor plasmids confirmed that deletion of the proximal AP-1 or the NF-κB site decreased TNFα-mediated TF induction to a higher extend than loss of the distal AP-1 site. However, integrity of both AP-1 sites and the NF-κB site was required for optimal TNFα stimulation. The relevance of these in vitro data was confirmed in vivo in a mouse tumor model. Expression plasmids for a dominant negative Jun mutant or I-κB were packaged in liposomes. When either mutated Jun or I-κB were injected intravenously 48 h before TNFα, a reduction in TNFα-mediated TF expression in the tumor endothelial cells was observed. Simultaneously, fibrin/fibrinogen deposition decreased and free blood flow could be restored. Thus, TNFα-induced up-regulation of endothelial cell TF depends on a concerted action of members of the bZIP and NF-κB family.

Functional studies revealed that the proximal AP-1 site, but not the distal, was inducible by Jun/Fos heterodimers. The distal AP-1 site, which has a G → A switch at position 4, was inducible by Jun homodimers. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays, using extracts of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-stimulated bovine aortic endothelial cells, demonstrated TNFα-inducible binding to the proximal AP-1 site, comprising JunD/Fos heterodimers. At the distal AP-1 site, only minor induction of binding activity, characterized as proteins of the Jun and ATF family, was observed. Consistently, this site only marginally participates in TNFα induction. Functional studies with TF promotor plasmids confirmed that deletion of the proximal AP-1 or the NF-κB site decreased TNFα-mediated TF induction to a higher extend than loss of the distal AP-1 site. However, integrity of both AP-1 sites and the NF-κB site was required for optimal TNFα stimulation. The relevance of these in vitro data was confirmed in vivo in a mouse tumor model. Expression plasmids for a dominant negative Jun mutant or I-κB were packaged in liposomes. When either mutated Jun or I-κB were injected intravenously 48 h before TNFα, a reduction in TNFα-mediated TF expression in the tumor endothelial cells was observed. Simultaneously, fibrin/fibrinogen deposition decreased and free blood flow could be restored. Thus, TNFα-induced up-regulation of endothelial cell TF depends on a concerted action of members of the bZIP and NF-κB family."

The cytoplasmic enzyme is subject to catabolite inactivation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae(2Holzer H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1976; 1: 178-181Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Addition of glucose to yeast cells grown on a nonfermentable carbon source causes a rapid inactivation of FBPase due to phosphorylation and subsequent degradation(3Funayama S. Gancedo J.M. Gancedo C.

Since its discovery(6Gancedo C. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 107: 401-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the proteolytic mechanism of FBPase degradation had remained elusive. The prominent proteolytic activities of the vacuole, especially proteinase yscB, in degrading FBPase in vitro at first suggested this lysosomal enzyme to be the catalyst of FBPase degradation under catabolite inactivation conditions(7Molano J. Gancedo C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 44: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, experiments using mutants defective in the activity of proteinase yscB and other vacuolar proteases seemed to rule out this possibility(8Wolf D.H. Ehmann C. Eur. J.

Nature. 1991; 350: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, mutants defective in proteolytic activities of the yeast proteasome revealed the involvement of this protease complex in glucose-induced degradation of FBPase, indicating this process to be a cytoplasmic event(12Schork S.M.

Ubiquitin, a 76-residue polypeptide found in all eukaryotes, is covalently attached with its carboxyl-terminal glycine to the protein substrate through an isopeptide bond in a multistep reaction. Ubiquitin is first activated through the formation of a thiol ester bond of the carboxyl-terminal glycine with the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1. Thereafter ubiquitin is transferred to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, which subsequently links it to the ɛ-amino group of an internal lysine of the substrate protein. In some cases this last step is performed with the support of a ubiquitin ligase E3, which mediates the recognition of the target protein together with the E2 enzyme. In further successive reactions ubiquitin moieties are linked to the Lys48 residue of each previously conjugated ubiquitin molecule until a polyubiquitin chain is formed(27Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). The specificity of the ubiquitin system for a certain substrate is thought to be a property of the E2 and E3 enzymes. In yeast, 10 UBC (E2) genes have been identified until now (23Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 179-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). UBC1, UBC4, and UBC5 encode a functionally overlapping group of enzymes, which mediate bulk turnover of short-lived and abnormal proteins(28Seufert W. McGrath J.P. Jentsch S.

The UBC6 gene product resides in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and seems to be involved in degradation of endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins (30Sommer T. Jentsch S. Nature. 1993; 365: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). UBC3 (CDC34) and UBC9 encode genes required for degradation of cyclins and regulation of the cell cycle(31Goebl M.G. Yochem J.

The UBC2 (RAD6) gene is involved in different processes including DNA repair and protein degradation via the N-end rule pathway(33Jentsch S. McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A.

Its function in the degradation of the tightly controlled ornithine decarboxylase has been shown in vitro and in vivo(44Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Tamura T. Tanaka K.

The signal rendering FBPase accessible to proteolysis through the proteasome during the catabolite inactivation process had remained unknown. Here we show that glucose-induced degradation of FBPase is signalled via the ubiquitin pathway. YEp96 is a 2-μm S. cerevisiae-Escherichia coli-based shuttle vector that encodes a synthetic version of yeast ubiquitin (Ub) under the control of the copper-inducible CUP1 promotor. YEp110 is identical to YEp96, with the difference that instead of wild-type Ub it encodes yeast Ub with an arginine (instead of lysine) at amino acid position 48 (Ub-R48). YEp112 codes for yeast Ub with an epitope from the hemagglutinin (ha) of influenza virus attached to the amino terminus (haUb). Except for this modification, the plasmid is also identical to YEp96. The plasmids used for expression of the different ubiquitin variants were a gift from M. Hochstrasser(46Hochstrasser M. Ellison M.J. Chau V. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4606-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). For overexpression of the different Ub variants, the S. cerevisiae wild-type strain W3031B (MATα ade2-1 leu2-3 −112 his3-11,15 trp1-1 ura3-1) and the FBPase deletion mutant strain W3031B-K0 (MATα ade2-1 leu2-3 −112 his3-11 trp1-1 ura3-1 fbp1::LEU2) were transformed with plasmid YEp96, YEp110, or YEp112, respectively. Both strains were a gift from H.-L Chiang(11Chiang H.-L. Schekman R. Nature. 1991; 350: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Ubc mutant strains used in this study are congenic to wild-type strain YW01 (MATα lys2-801 leu2-3, 2-112 ura3-52 his3-200 trp1-1(am)). YW09: ubc1::URA3; YW013: ubc4::HIS3; YW017: ubc5::LEU2; YW023: ubc4::HIS3, ubc5::LEU2. The strains were a gift from S. Jentsch(28Seufert W. McGrath J.P. Jentsch S.

Strain CMY762 (MATacim3-1 ura3-52 leu2Δ1 his3Δ-200) and congenic wild-type strain YPH499 were gifts from C. Mann(47Ghislain M. Udvardy A. Mann C. Nature. 1993; 366: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in mineral medium (MV, 0.67% Difco yeast nitrogen base without amino acids) containing 2% glucose or for derepression of FBPase, 2% ethanol as the carbon source, and required supplements. Radiolabeling was done in pulse medium (0.17% Difco yeast nitrogen base without amino acid and ammonium sulfate, 0.5% proline, 100 μM ammonium sulfate, 2% ethanol, and required supplements). In all experiments requiring induction of Ub synthesis, CuSO4 was added to a final concentration of 100 μM. Antibodies against FBPase were raised in rabbits using a FBPase-MS2 fusion protein expressed in E. coli(13Schork S.M. Bee G. Thumm M. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Antibodies to the ha epitope (12CA5) were from Berkeley Antibody Co. Inc. Secondary peroxidase-conjugated anti mouse antibodies (anti-mouse IgG (H+L)) were from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). Yeast strains were cultured in MV medium containing 2% glucose and required supplements until an A600 of 5-6 was reached. After harvesting (for 5 min at 500 × g) and washing, cells were preincubated for 3.5 h in pulse medium at an A600 of 3. Radiolabeling was done by adding [35S]methionine (Amersham, Braunschweig) to the cell suspension to a final concentration of 45 μCi • ml-1 (pulse). After 1.5 h, cells were shifted onto MV medium containing 2% glucose and 10 mM nonradioactive methionine (chase). In the experiments overexpressing different ubiquitin derivatives, CuSO4 (100 μM) was present during the pulse and chase periods. 1-ml samples were taken at the times indicated, and the chase was terminated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 5%). The precipitates were washed twice with cold ethanol (−20°C) and dried. Subsequently cells were lysed in 100 μl of breaking buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 6 M urea, 1% SDS, and 1 mM EDTA) with agitation by glass beads three times for 1 min with intermittent heating at 95°C, followed by a 5-min heating period at the same temperature. The lysate was diluted with 1 ml of IP buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 190 mM NaCl, 6 mM EDTA, and 1.25% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (1 mM PMSF and 20 μg • ml-1 each of chymostatin, pepstatin A, leupeptin, and antipain), centrifuged, and transferred to a new test tube. FBPase antiserum (8 μl) was added, and the samples were gently agitated for 2 h at room temperature. Immunoprecipitates were collected by adding 50 μl of a protein A-Sepharose Cl4-B (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany) suspension (5% w/v in IP) and further incubated for 1 h. The Sepharose beads were centrifuged and washed three times with IP buffer. Proteins were released from Sepharose by boiling in 50-100 μl of 2 times concentrated Laemmli sample buffer (200 mM Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue), separated by SDS-PAGE (10%), and visualized by fluorography. Protein bands were quantitated using a Fuji BAS 2000 bio-imaging analyzer. Yeast cells transformed with Ub-encoding plasmids (YEp96, YEp110, or YEp112) were grown in MV medium containing 2% glucose until an A600 of 5-6. After harvesting (5 min at 500 × g), cells were resuspended in MV medium containing 2% ethanol and 100 μM CuSO4 to an A600 of 5 and incubated for 5 h to derepress FBPase. After the addition of glucose (final concentration, 2%), 1-ml samples were taken at the times indicated and treated with trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 5%). Cell lysis and immunoprecipitation with FBPase antibodies (6 μl/sample) were performed as described above. Proteins were released from the Sepharose beads by boiling in 40 μl of 2 times concentrated Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE (10%), and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose filter (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). The filter was blocked by gently shaking for 3 h at room temperature with PBS-T buffer (50 mM K2HPO4, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 10% nonfat milk. Thereafter the filter was gently treated for 2 h with ha antibodies (1:5000 in PBS-T). After washing three times in PBS-T, secondary antibodies (anti-mouse IgG) were added (1:5000 in PBS-T) to the filter followed by gentle shaking for 45 min. HaUb conjugates were visualized using the ECL™ detection kit from Amersham (Braunschweig, Germany). Ubiquitin-mediated degradation of a protein requires the covalent attachment of ubiquitin moieties, leading to the occurrence of higher molecular mass species of such a protein. The use of an epitope-tagged ubiquitin derivative allows the unambiguous identification of such ubiquitin protein conjugates in vivo(46Hochstrasser M. Ellison M.J. Chau V. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4606-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 48Ellison M.J. Hochstrasser M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21150-21157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If catabolite degradation of FBPase were mediated via the ubiquitin pathway, higher molecular mass species of FBPase would be expected. When pulse-labeled FBPase was immunoprecipitated during catabolite inactivation in cells expressing wild-type ubiquitin from a 2-μm plasmid, at least two additional labeled species with higher mass than FBPase could be detected in the precipitates (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3). The appearance of these larger species was only visible after shifting cells derepressed of FBPase onto glucose medium (compare Fig. 1A, lane 1 with lanes 2 and 3), suggesting that these species are intermediates of the glucose-induced degradation process of FBPase. To test whether these species actually represent ubiquitin conjugates of FBPase, a ha-tagged version of ubiquitin was overexpressed. This ubiquitin variant (haUb) is about 1.5 kDa (14 amino acids) larger than wild-type ubiquitin, resulting in a decrease of the mobility of this molecule on SDS-PAGE. If the larger protein species present in the FBPase precipitates (Fig. 1A) were ubiquitinated forms of this enzyme, in vivo substitution of wild-type ubiquitin with haUb would lead to a slower migration of these species as compared with FBPase ligated to wild-type ubiquitin. Cells transformed with either plasmid YEp96 expressing wild-type Ub or plasmid YEp112 expressing haUb were pulse-labeled during derepression of FBPase. After inducing the inactivation period by addition of glucose, samples were taken. Crude extracts were immunoprecipitated with FBPase antibodies, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). Comparison of the pattern of bands in lanes 2 (expression of wild-type Ub) and 3 (expression of haUb) of Fig. 1B shows that in the presence of haUb the new protein species appearing are of higher molecular mass than those species appearing in the presence of wild-type Ub. This indicates that the newly appearing bands represent ubiquitinated proteins. Moreover, the absence of the corresponding bands in the control patterns obtained from FBPase null mutants also expressing either wild-type or ha-tagged Ub (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 4) reveals that these species are ubiquitinated forms of FBPase. To further confirm this, we tested whether the putative FBPase-ubiquitin conjugates immunoreacted with both FBPase and ha antibodies. Crude extracts from glucose-inactivated cells were immunoprecipitated with FBPase antibodies; proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose filters. The filters were then probed with ha antibodies. As can be seen in Fig. 2, lanes 6, 7, and 8, extracts from cells expressing haUb show a complex spectrum of ha-ubiquitin-FBPase conjugates after shifting cells to glucose. The amount of ubiquitinated FBPase species is highest shortly after glucose addition (Fig. 2, lane 6), followed by a drastic decline along with further incubation of the cells on glucose (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 8). This behavior is consistent with the view that the ubiquitinated forms of FBPase are the substrates of the degradation machinery of the cell. As expected, neither in cells expressing wild-type Ub nor in FBPase null mutant cells (Δfbp1) expressing haUb is any ubiquitin conjugate detectable (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 4 respectively), clearly confirming that the observed bands in Fig. 2(lanes 6-8) represent ubiquitinated forms of FBPase. From these data we conclude that FBPase is ubiquitinated upon glucose addition and that this event triggers catabolite degradation of the enzyme. It has been shown that treatment of cells with cycloheximide at the time of glucose addition prevents degradation of FBPase(11Chiang H.-L. Schekman R. Nature. 1991; 350: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We found that FBPase is also not ubiquitinated under these conditions (not shown). This indicates the necessity upon catabolite inactivation of the new synthesis of a protein(s) that is part of the signaling cascade and indispensible for ubiquitination and degradation of FBPase. For the N-end rule substrates (27Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar) and for the Matα2 repressor (46Hochstrasser M. Ellison M.J. Chau V. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4606-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) it has been shown that proteolysis via the ubiquitin-mediated pathway requires formation of a multiubiquitin chain for their efficient degradation. The ubiquitin molecules are linked within this chain by isopeptide bonds connecting the carboxyl-terminal Gly76 of one ubiquitin moiety to the ɛ-amino group of Lys48 of the adjacent ubiquitin molecule. Lys29 and Lys63 have also been found to be sites for polyubiquitination(49Arnason T. Ellison M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7876-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), but Lys48 has been identified as the primary site of this process. A modified ubiquitin carrying an arginine at position 48 (Ub-R48) instead of lysine can still be conjugated to other proteins but fails to function as an acceptor within the multiubiquitin chain (27Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). Therefore, Ub-R48 can serve as a probe for monitoring the presence of a Lys48-linked multiubiquitin chain in a protein of interest(6Gancedo C. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 107: 401-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis had indicated the appearance of multiply ubiquitinated FBPase molecules during catabolite inactivation (Fig. 2, lane 6). If Lys48-linked multiubiquitination is a prerequisite for glucose-induced degradation of FBPase, the presence of Ub-R48 should affect this process. To address this possibility we compared the degradation rate of FBPase in cells expressing high levels of wild-type ubiquitin (transformed with YEp96) and in cells expressing high levels of Ub-R48 (transformed with YEp110) by pulse-chase analysis. Although glucose-induced degradation of FBPase occurred in cells overexpressing wild-type ubiquitin (Fig. 3A), the presence of Ub-R48 inhibited the degradation of the enzyme (Fig. 3B). It is noticeable that the expression of Ub-R48 resulted in an increase of the amount of the monoubiquitinated FBPase species (see arrow in Fig. 3). The SDS-PAGE pattern of FBPase immunoprecipitates from pulse-labeled cells expressing Ub-R48 did not show multiply ubiquitinated species of FBPase (not shown). Formation of a multiubiquitin chain containing Lys48 linkages seems therefore to be necessary for glucose-induced degradation of FBPase. As degradation of FBPase is nearly blocked in cells expressing Ub-R48, Lys48 must be viewed as the important site for polyubiquitination to render FBPase accessible to proteolysis. Using mutants defective in subunits of the 20 S proteasome we had shown that this particle is involved in catabolite degradation of FBPase (12Schork S.M. Bee G. Thumm M. Wolf D.H. Nature. 1994; 369: 283-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13Schork S.M. Bee G. Thumm M. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In vitro studies had shown that ubiquitinated proteins are degraded by the 26 S proteasome(19Hough R. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2400-2408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Eytan E. Ganoth D. Armon T. Hershko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7751-7755Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 21Driscoll J. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4789-4792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To elucidate whether the 26 S complex is needed for FBPase degradation, we assayed the catabolite inactivation of the enzyme in strains carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation in the CIM3 gene, which encodes a regulatory subunit of the 26 S proteasome(47Ghislain M. Udvardy A. Mann C. Nature. 1993; 366: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Cim3-1 mutant cells arrest the cell cycle at nonpermissive temperature and accumulate Ub-Pro-βgal, degradation of which is ubiquitin-dependent. Pulse-chase analysis of FBPase during glucose-induced degradation indicated that the enzyme is remarkably stabilized in cim3-1 cells relative to the isogenic wild type (Fig. 4). This documents that the entire 26 S proteasome complex is necessary for catabolite inactivation to occur. The finding that catabolite inactivation of FBPase is triggered by ubiquitination pointed to the action of E2 (Ubc) enzymes involved in this process. Therefore we measured the degradation rate of FBPase after the addition of glucose in yeast strains deleted in various UBC genes and thus devoid of the respective activitiy of the Ubc enzyme. Pulse-chase analysis indicated that catabolite degradation of FBPase was unaffected in cells lacking a functional Ubc2 (Rad6), Ubc6, Ubc7, and Ubc10 (Pas2) protein (not shown). In contrast, the degradation was strongly inhibited in ubc1 and ubc4 ubc5 mutant strains (Fig. 5A). The half-life of FBPase was increased 2-fold in ubc1 cells and 4-fold in ubc4 ubc5 double mutant cells (Fig. 5B). Single deletions of either UBC4 or UBC5 led only to a weak but reproducible increase of the half-life of FBPase during the catabolite inactivation process (25 min and 20 min, respectively, versus 17 min in wild-type cells, not shown). This behavior might have been expected, because it is conceivable that the nearly identical Ubc4 and Ubc5 enzymes are functionally redundant(28Seufert W. McGrath J.P. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4535-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 29Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). When measuring the degradation of FBPase by assaying enzymatic activity, similar results were obtained (not shown). It should be noted that all ubc mutants showed the characteristic rapid loss of FBPase activity of about 50% during the first 15 min of catabolite inactivation. This is due to phosphorylation of FBPase (4Müller D. Holzer H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 103: 926-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 5Mazon M.J. Gancedo J.M. Gancedo C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1128-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and indicates that the transduction of the glucose-induced signal is not impaired in the ubc mutant cells. On the basis of genetic studies, it had been shown that Ubc1, Ubc4, and Ubc5 constitute a subfamily of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes with overlapping functions (28Seufert W. McGrath J.P. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4535-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This feature is nicely reflected in the catabolite degradation process of FBPase. Based on the above described findings we assume the following model for catabolite inactivation of FBPase. The addition of glucose to yeast cells grown on a nonfermentable carbon source causes phophorylation (4Müller D. Holzer H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 103: 926-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 5Mazon M.J. Gancedo J.M. Gancedo C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1128-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ubiquitination of the enzyme. The formation of a multiubiquitin chain targets FBPase for degradation through the 26 S proteasome, thereby changing the half-life of the enzyme from over 90 h on ethanol (3Funayama S. Gancedo J.M. Gancedo C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 109: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) to under 20 min (Fig. 5B). The ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc1, Ubc4, and Ubc5 and the glucose-inducible, newly synthesized protein(s) are necessary for FBPase inactivation to occur. It seems unlikely that the glucose-induced synthesis of a new protein concerns the provision of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, because activities of Ubc1, Ubc4, or Ubc5 are already present under the conditions of catabolite inactivation. Ubc1 is expressed in exponentially growing cells and with enhanced levels in stationary phase cells; Ubc4 is also expressed in exponentially growing cells, and Ubc5 is present in stationary phase cells(28Seufert W. McGrath J.P. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4535-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 29Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The catabolite inactivation process of FBPase represents an ideal model to follow the fate of a protein from the signaling event to ubiquitin proteasome-mediated degradation.

Activated Src associates with the cytoskeletal matrix, resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of specific cytoskeletal substrates. We have previously shown that stable association of Src with the cytoskeletal matrix is mediated by the Src SH2 domain in a phosphotyrosine-dependent interaction. In this report, we demonstrate that one of the cytoskeletal binding partners of Src is p80/85 cortactin. The association was observed in lysates of transformed cells but was not seen in normal fibroblasts. The interaction could be reconstituted in vitro using transformed cell extracts and a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the Src SH2 domain but not with GST-Src SH3 or with GST-Src SH2 containing a point mutation in the FLVRES sequence. Confocal microscopy revealed that cortactin redistributed and colocalized with v-Src and a Src SH3 deletion mutant in transformed cells. However, in cells expressing a Src SH2 deletion mutant, the redistribution of cortactin and colocalization with Src did not occur. Furthermore, biochemical fractionation of transformed cells indicated that a significant increase in cortactin distribution to the cytoskeletal fraction occurred, which correlated with a shift in the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of the protein. Cortactin fractionated from cells expressing kinase-defective or myristylation-defective Src mutants did not exhibit this shift. These data suggest a molecular mechanism by which tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin and association with the Src SH2 domain influence the cytoskeletal reorganization induced in Src-transformed cells.

These data suggest a molecular mechanism by which tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin and association with the Src SH2 domain influence the cytoskeletal reorganization induced in Src-transformed cells. The v-Src oncogene mediates cellular transformation by encoding a tyrosine kinase which exhibits elevated levels of catalytic activity. Interaction of pp60v-src with the plasma membrane is essential for achieving transformation and results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of membrane and cytoskeletal proteins. It is thought that tyrosine phosphorylation of key cytoskeletal substrates leads to the dramatic changes in morphology, cytoskeletal reorganization, and decreased adhesive properties characteristic of transformed cells (for review, see (1Jove R. Hanafusa H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) and (2Parsons J.T. Weber M.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1989; 147: 79-127PubMed Google Scholar)). Consistent with this hypothesis, pp60v-src and its nontransforming cellular homolog, pp60c-src differ in their ability to bind to the cytoskeletal matrix(3Hamaguchi M. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2312-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 4Loeb D.M. Woolford J. Beemon K. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2420-2427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When expressed in fibroblasts, v-Src and oncogenic mutants of c-Src stably associate with the cytoskeletal matrix, whereas nontransforming Src variants, including wild-type c-Src, do not. These observations suggest that it is not only the phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins, but also the association of activated Src with specific cytoskeletal substrates that is important for the changes observed upon transformation. We have recently shown that stable association of Src with proteins in the cytoskeletal matrix is mediated by the Src SH2 domain in a phosphotyrosine-dependent interaction(5Okamura H. Resh M.D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2293-2303PubMed Google Scholar). Several proteins, which are tyrosine-phosphorylated in transformed cells, are candidate binding partners for activated Src in the cytoskeletal matrix (6Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1703) Google Scholar, 7Davis S. Lu M.L. Lao S.H. Lin S. Butler J.A. Druker B.J. Roberts T.M. An Q. Chen L.B.

One of these potential cytoskeletal binding partners is p80/85 cortactin. Cortactin is an F-actin binding protein that possesses several interesting structural features, including an SH3 domain, a proline-rich region, and a series of tandem internal repeats that serves as the actin binding domain(10Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 11Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Cortactin is normally phosphorylated on serine and threonine, but it becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to growth factor stimulation or upon transformation by activated Src(11Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 12Maa M.-M. Wilson L.K. Moyers J.S. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24427-24431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In nontransformed cells, cortactin has been shown to transiently associate with c-Src in response to thrombin activation in platelets (14Wong S. Reynolds A.B. Papkoff J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2407-2415PubMed Google Scholar) and in response to FGF-1 in fibroblasts(15Zhan X. Plourde C. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20221-20224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In oncogenic cells, the cortactin locus is amplified and overexpressed in certain human breast and squamous cell carcinomas(16Schuuring E. Verhoeven E. Mooi W.J. Michalides R.J.A.M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 355-361PubMed Google Scholar), while in mice the inappropriate expression of cortactin appears to be associated with the transformation of plasma cells(17Miglarese M.R. Mannion-Henderson J. Wu H. Parsons J.T. Bender T.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1989-1997PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it has been suggested that cortactin may play an important role in the transduction of mitogenic signals, cytoskeletal organization, and cell adhesion. In this report, we demonstrate that v-Src and cortactin form a complex in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed cells that is dependent on the structural integrity of the Src SH2 domain. The association was most readily observed in the cytoskeletal matrix-enriched fraction of the cell and correlated with the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin. The interaction of pp60v-src and cortactin could be reconstituted in vitro by incubating cytoskeletal matrix extracts from transformed cells with GST 1The abbreviations used are: GSTglutathione S-transferase: CEF, chicken embryo fibroblastPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. fusion protein containing the Src SH2 domain, but it was not observed with a GST Src SH2 domain containing a point mutation in the FLVRES sequence. Confocal microscopy revealed that cortactin redistributed from the cell periphery to colocalize with wild-type v-Src in transformed fibroblasts. However, in cells expressing a Src SH2 deletion mutant, the redistribution of cortactin and colocalization with Src did not occur. Upon transformation, a significant increase in cortactin distribution to the cytoskeletal fraction was observed that could be attributed to a shift by the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of the protein. In contrast, cortactin fractionated from cells expressing a kinase-defective Src mutant did not exhibit this shift, consistent with its lack of tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these data demonstrate a functional role for the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin. Our results provide direct evidence for the interaction of tyrosine-phosphorylated cortactin with v-Src and suggest a molecular mechanism by which this association influences the cytoskeletal reorganization induced in Src-transformed cells. glutathione S-transferase: CEF, chicken embryo fibroblast polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Sequences encoding the v-Src SH2 (residues 148-251), SH3 (residues 79-147), and SH3-SH2 domains were generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification using the v-Src plasmid pSR-GEM as template and the appropriate primers. Similarly, generation of the R175K SH2 domain was achieved by polymerase chain reaction amplification of a pSR-GEM plasmid containing the R175K mutation(5Okamura H.

CEF were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mM sodium vanadate and disrupted on ice with lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After clarification, approximately 500 μg of cell lysate was incubated with polyclonal anti-Src. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membrane (Millipore) as described previously(20Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Mayer B.J. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10588-10595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were probed with monoclonal anti-p80/85 cortactin and detected with the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Corp.). Cytoskeletal matrix-enriched fractions were prepared by extracting cells with a 1% Triton X-100 buffer as described previously (10Wu H. Parsons J.T. J.

The Triton X-100-insoluble fraction was scraped into a modified RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris (pH 7.2), 140 mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), clarified, and used for binding experiments. Unless otherwise indicated, 3 μg of GST fusion protein was preadsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with 500 μg of cellular protein for 3 h at 4°C with constant rocking. The beads were washed 4 times with modified RIPA, and the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis through an 8% polyacrylamide gel, and immunoblotted as described above with monoclonal antibody against p80/85 cortactin. CEF expressing the appropriate Src mutants were seeded onto glass coverslips, grown overnight, and processed as described previously(20Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Mayer B.J. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10588-10595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For double staining experiments, the primary antibody solution consisted of a 1:200 dilution of polyclonal anti-Src and 10 μg/ml monoclonal anti-p80/85 in phosphate-buffered saline + 10% calf serum. The secondary antibody solution contained a 1:75 dilution of fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Boehringer Mannheim) and 5 μg/ml of Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes Inc.) in phosphate-buffered saline + 10% calf serum. Cells were visualized with a 100× objective using a Nikon fluorescence microscope coupled to a Molecular Dynamics laser scanning confocal microscope. Normal CEF or cells expressing the appropriate Src construct were fractionated by incubating in 1% Triton X-100 buffer as described above. After solubilizing the Triton-insoluble fraction with RIPA buffer, all fractions were adjusted to equivalent detergent concentrations. Fractions were immunoprecipitated with anti-cortactin antibody, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with either anti-cortactin or anti-phosphotyrosine, as described above. Blots were stripped by incubating in 62.5 mM Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol at 70°C for 30 min with constant agitation. Blots were then blocked overnight before reprobing with primary antibody and processed as above. pp60v-src, but not pp60c-src, stably associates with the cytoskeletal matrix (3Hamaguchi M. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2312-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 4Loeb D.M. Woolford J. Beemon K. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2420-2427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in an interaction mediated by the Src SH2 domain(5Okamura H. Resh M.D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2293-2303PubMed Google Scholar). To identify proteins in the cytoskeleton that interact with Src, pp60src was immunoprecipitated from lysates of normal CEF or CEF expressing pp60v-src. The immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then Western immunoblotted with antibodies to cytoskeletal proteins that are putative Src substrates. Using this method, we identified p80/85 cortactin as an interacting protein. Immunoblotting with anti-cortactin antibody revealed a weak signal in Src immunoprecipitates isolated from whole cell lysates of v-Src-transformed CEF (Fig. 1, lane 2), but not from those of normal cells (lane 1). A stronger cortactin signal was observed in Src immunoprecipitates obtained from a cytoskeleton-enriched fraction of transformed cells (lane 3). Therefore, p80/85 cortactin appears to form a complex in vivo with pp60v-src but not pp60c-src. Previously, we demonstrated that the Src SH2 domain was required for association with the cytoskeletal matrix. We next determined whether this region of Src was specifically responsible for its interaction with cortactin. Since cortactin possesses a proline-rich region, it was also possible that the protein interacted with Src through the Src SH3 domain. To more directly assess potential interactions between the Src homology domains and cortactin, GST fusion proteins containing the Src SH2 and/or SH3 domains were employed. Cellular protein from the cytoskeleton-enriched fraction of Rous sarcoma virus-transformed CEF was incubated with GST fusion proteins attached to glutathione Sepharose beads. As depicted in Fig. 2, GST-Src SH3/SH2 (lane 2) and GST-Src SH2 (lane 4) efficiently bound p80/85 cortactin, while GST alone (lane 1) or GST-Src SH3 (lane 3) failed to bind. In addition GST-SH2(R175K) (lane 5), which contains a point mutation in the phosphotyrosine binding pocket of the Src SH2 domain, failed to bind efficiently. Titration of GST-Src SH2, by incubating increasing amounts of fusion protein with a constant level of cellular protein, revealed concentration-dependent binding. Cortactin association could be detected using as little as 0.1 μg of GST fusion protein, and appeared to reach saturation at 3 μg of GST-Src SH2 (data not shown). In addition, we were able to observe direct association in vitro of purified, phosphorylated cortactin with purified Src SH2 domain. GST-p80 cortactin fusion protein (10Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) expressed in Escherichia coli was purified, and approximately 5 μg of fusion protein were attached to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The bound GST-cortactin fusion protein was phosphorylated in vitro with purified Src, washed extensively, and then cleaved with thrombin to remove the GST moiety. The phosphorylated cortactin fragment was isolated and tested for its ability to associate with GST-Src SH2. Cortactin protein purified and phosphorylated in this manner was able to associate with the Src SH2 domain, while nonphosphorylated cortactin purified and assayed the same way did not appear to interact. Together, these results indicate that the interaction between Src and cortactin is specific and requires an intact Src SH2 domain. Since the Src SH2 domain is required for binding to cortactin, it is likely that a phosphotyrosine residue(s) on cortactin is involved in the association. However, there have been several reports of SH2 domains involved in phosphotyrosine-independent interactions(25Cleghon V. Morrison D.K. J. Biol.

In normal CEF, cortactin is phosphorylated only on serine and threonine, whereas in Src-transformed cells cortactin also becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated(11Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). To verify the involvement of a phosphotyrosine-dependent interaction, fusion proteins were incubated with cell lysate from the cytoskeleton-enriched fraction of uninfected cells in parallel with lysate from transformed cells (Fig. 3). None of the GST fusion proteins bound cortactin from normal cell lysate (lanes 1-3), whereas the GST-Src SH2 fusion bound the cortactin obtained from transformed cells (lane 7). These experiments were also conducted using whole cell lysates from normal and v-Src-transformed cells, with identical results (data not shown). To further confirm that the cortactin-Src interaction observed in lysates from transformed cells is dependent upon SH2-phosphotyrosine association, competition was performed using a phosphopeptide containing the optimal sequence for binding to the Src SH2 domain, pYEEI(22Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar). Simultaneous addition of pYEEI and the cellular lysate to GST-Src SH2 effectively abolished association of the fusion protein with cortactin from transformed cells (Fig. 4).Figure 4Competition of Src SH2-cortactin binding with pYEEI peptide. GST-Src SH2 fusion protein bound to glutathione beads was incubated with cellular protein from transformed cells without peptide (lane 1), or in the presence of 25 μM (lane 2) and 75 μM (lane 3) pYEEI peptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate whether cortactin association is limited to the Src SH2 domain, a panel of GST-SH2 fusions from other proteins was utilized. 5 μg of each SH2 fusion protein was adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with 500 μg of cellular protein from transformed CEF. As shown in Fig. 5, GST-Src SH2 and GST-Abl SH2 bound similar levels of cortactin. GST-Crk SH2 and GST-Nck SH2 also bound cortactin, although with lower efficiency than the GST-Src and -Abl SH2 domains. In contrast, GST-Fps SH2, GST-PI3 kinase SH2, and GST-phospholipase C-γ SH2 bound cortactin very poorly. These results suggest that specificity of cortactin association is maintained in vitro and that other SH2 domain-containing proteins may interact with cortactin in vivo. Based on the finding that cortactin binds to the v-Src SH2 domain in vitro, it was of interest to determine whether the v-Src SH2 domain influences cortactin localization in vivo. Colocalization studies of cortactin and various Src mutants were undertaken using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. In normal CEF, cortactin binds to the ends of F-actin, exhibiting an intense staining in the peripheral extensions of the cell ((11Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and Fig. 6A). Upon transformation, cortactin redistributes (11Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) from the cell periphery to podosomes, sites of membrane-substratum contact containing high levels of cytoskeletal proteins(29Marchisio P.C. Cirillo D. Teti A. Zambonin-Zallone A. Tarone G. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 169: 202-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 30Tarone G. Cirillo D. Giancotti F.G. Comoglio P.M. Marchisio P.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1985; 159: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In cells transformed by wild-type v-Src, redistribution of cortactin resulted in the colocalization of both cortactin (Fig. 6C) and Src (Fig. 6D) to podosomes. In contrast, in cells expressing an SH2 deletion mutant of v-Src, colocalization of v-Src and cortactin did not occur, and no redistribution of cortactin into podosomes was observed. Cells transfected with the Src SH2 deletion mutant exhibited cortactin staining similar to that seen in nontransfected cells with localization predominantly at the cell periphery (Fig. 6E), while Src distribution was primarily perinuclear (Fig. 6F). Deletion of the SH3 domain does not impair the ability of Src to induce morphological transformation. Cells expressing the Src SH3 deletion mutant were examined by confocal microscopy and also found to exhibit colocalization of cortactin and Src proteins (Fig. 6, G and H). Approximately 10-30% of the cortactin population becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon Src transformation or growth factor stimulation(11Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The effect of this tyrosine phosphorylation is unknown since it does not appear to alter F-actin binding, an apparent function of cortactin in normal cells(14Wong S. Reynolds A.B. Papkoff J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2407-2415PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested the possibility that tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin was involved in regulating its subcellular distribution to the cytoskeleton. Cells were extracted with a 1% Triton X-100 buffer (3Hamaguchi M. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2312-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 5Okamura H. Resh M.D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2293-2303PubMed Google Scholar) and were separated into Triton-soluble and -resistant fractions to determine the ability of cortactin to associate with the detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal matrix. Each fraction was immunoprecipitated with anti-cortactin and then immunoblotted with either anti-cortactin or anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Although there was an appreciable amount of cortactin associated with the cytoskeletal fraction in normal CEF, the majority was present in the soluble fraction (Fig. 7A). In cells transformed by v-Src, however, there was a significant shift in cortactin distribution to the detergent-resistant cytoskeletal matrix fraction (Fig. 7A). Likewise, fractionation of cells transformed by an SH3 deletion mutant also showed cortactin to be distributed predominantly in the cytoskeletal matrix. In contrast, mutations within other domains of the v-Src protein prevented cortactin relocalization to podosomes. The distribution of cortactin fractionated from cells expressing a kinase-defective Src mutant (K295M) resembled that seen in uninfected cells, with the majority of cortactin partitioning with the soluble fraction (Fig. 7A). A similar result was obtained with cells expressing a nonmyristylated, cytosolic mutant of v-Src, NY315 (data not shown). Mutations within the SH2 domain of Src also appeared to interfere with cortactin redistribution. Fractionation of cells expressing a Src SH2 deletion mutant showed that the majority of cortactin was detergent soluble, similar to the distribution of cortactin in normal cells. Cortactin isolated from cells expressing a Src SH2 domain point mutant, R175K, was also found predominantly in the soluble fraction, although the difference in cortactin distribution was not as dramatic as that from cells expressing the Src SH2 deletion mutant. The immunoblot was stripped and reprobed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies to determine whether the increase in cytoskeletal distribution was attributable to tyrosine phosphorylation. Cortactin from normal CEF or from CEF expressing the kinase-defective Src contained no phosphotyrosine (Fig. 7B). As expected, cortactin isolated from v-Src-transformed cells, as well as from cells expressing a Src SH3 deletion mutant, did contain phosphotyrosine, and this population fractionated almost exclusively with the cytoskeletal fraction (Fig. 7B). Although the vast majority of cortactin from cells infected with the Src SH2 domain mutants was found in the soluble fraction, there were low levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated cortactin that remained in the cytoskeletal fraction. A similar result was obtained with the nonmyristylated v-Src mutant NY315, with tyrosine-phosphorylated cortactin fractionating with the cytoskeletal matrix. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that Src-dependent phosphorylation of cortactin results in redistribution of cortactin to the detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal matrix. The stable association of transforming variants of Src with the cytoskeletal matrix is consistent with the hypothesis that tyrosine phosphorylation of key cytoskeletal substrates contributes to the striking changes in morphology, adhesion, and cytoskeletal organization observed in oncogenesis. We have previously demonstrated that pp60src interacts with the cytoskeletal matrix through its SH2 domain in a phosphotyrosine-dependent interaction(5Okamura H. Resh M.D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2293-2303PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we show that p80/85 cortactin is one of the cytoskeletal protein binding partners of v-Src. Interaction between Src and cortactin was observed in vivo by coprecipitation from the cytoskeletal matrix-enriched fraction of transformed cells, and in vitro using GST fusion proteins. Several lines of evidence indicate that formation of the complex is mediated by binding of phosphotyrosine residues on cortactin to the Src SH2 domain. The association was not observed, in vitro or in vivo, when lysate from nontransformed cells was utilized, correlating with the lack of tyrosine-phosphorylated cortactin in these cells. Using GST fusion proteins, the cortactin binding site was mapped to the Src SH2 domain. No interaction between Src and cortactin occurred when the Src SH2 domain contained a point mutation in the phosphotyrosine-binding FLVRES sequence. Cortactin did not associate with a GST-Src SH3 fusion protein, even though a proline-rich region is present within cortactin. Moreover, the cortactin-Src SH2 domain interaction could be abolished by addition of the tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide, pYEEI, which binds specifically to the Src SH2 domain. Although tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is dependent on Src kinase activity (Fig. 7B), it is not known whether cortactin is a direct Src substrate. Purified c-Src can phosphorylate a GST-cortactin fusion protein in vitro (data not shown), but the sites of phosphorylation have not been mapped and compared with the sites phosphorylated in vivo. Alternatively, another tyrosine kinase may phosphorylate cortactin. pp60v-src may phosphorylate and thereby activate another tyrosine kinase, which then phosphorylates cortactin and enables association with Src. In fact, a tyrosine kinase different from Src is associated with cortactin, but it appears inactive in nontransformed cells. 2H. Wu, and J. T. Parsons, personal communication. Determination of the kinase directly responsible for cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation, as well as identification of the phosphorylation sites themselves, awaits further study. Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin does not appear to influence its actin binding properties(10Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), and the functional consequences of this modification were not previously known. Our data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin serves to regulate its localization. In normal, untransformed cells, cortactin did not contain detectable phosphotyrosine, and the majority of the protein partitioned with the detergent-soluble fraction. In cells expressing wild-type v-Src or an SH3 Src deletion, cortactin became tyrosine-phosphorylated, and a significant increase in cortactin distribution to the Triton-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction was observed. Immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies demonstrated that the tyrosine-phosphorylated cortactin population partitioned almost exclusively with the detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton (Fig. 7B). Two other v-Src mutants with active kinase domains (R175K and NY315) induced low levels of cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation, and this population of cortactin was localized to the detergent-resistant fraction as well (Fig. 7, Table 1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab What does tyrosine-phosphorylated cortactin bind to in the matrix? Our data suggest that one of the binding partners is the v-Src SH2 domain. Confocal microscopy revealed that cortactin does not relocalize in cells expressing Src SH2 deletion or point mutants. However, the v-Src SH2 domain is probably not the only binding partner for cortactin. Cortactin contains nearly 30 tyrosine residues, some of which, if phosphorylated, would lie within potential “consensus” sequences for binding to Src, Nck, or 3BP2 SH2 domains(22Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C.

Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). In vitro binding assays with the SH2 domains of other proteins suggest that cortactin can also associate with other tyrosine kinases like Abl or with bridging proteins like Crk or Nck (Fig. 5). Yamanashi et al. recently showed that HS1, a cortactin-like protein, becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and binds to the Lyn SH2 domain(32Yamanashi Y. Okada M. Semba T. Yamori T. Umemori H. Tsunasawa H. Toyoshima K. Kitamura D. Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3631-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In addition, the presence of both an SH3 domain and a proline-rich region in cortactin further suggests that cortactin plays an important role in creating a nucleation site for the clustering of other proteins in the cytoskeletal matrix. Interestingly, it has also recently been demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of β1 integrin results in an altered subcellular localization as compared with the nonphosphorylated form(33Johansson M.W. Larsson E. Luning B. Pasquale E.B. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1299-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins may serve as a general means of regulating subcellular localization by promoting association with SH2 domain-containing proteins. Podosome formation is prominent in cells transformed by viruses carrying oncogenic tyrosine kinases such as Src, Abl, and Yes (for review, see (6Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1703) Google Scholar)). However, the molecular mechanism by which Src induces this actin cytoskeleton reorganization is unknown, and actin itself does not appear to be a Src substrate (for review, see (2Parsons J.T. Weber M.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1989; 147: 79-127PubMed Google Scholar)). The reorganization of actin filaments into podosomes upon transformation correlates with an increase in the amount of actin partitioning in the Triton-resistant fraction(34Holme T.C. Kellie S. Wyke J.A. Crawford N. Br. J. Cancer. 1986; 53: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is clear, however, that the increased presence of actin in this fraction alone cannot account for the redistribution of cortactin. In all cases, the redistribution of cortactin to the Triton-resistant fraction and to podosomes was dependent on the presence of an intact v-Src SH2 domain. The interaction of Src and cortactin offers a possible link between transformation by a tyrosine kinase and cytoskeletal reorganization. Tyrosine phosphorylation of this actin binding protein could result in its recruitment to a specific subcellular location, thereby facilitating the aberrant aggregation of actin and other cytoskeletal proteins observed in podosomes. One can question whether podosome association (detergent resistance) of cortactin reflects a general feature of transformation or is the result of interaction between v-Src and cortactin. In the first instance (Model 1), cortactin localization to podosomes would be independent of v-Src localization in podosomes. In Model 2, redistribution of cortactin into podosomes would require the presence of v-Src in podosomes. Our data, summarized in Table 1, support the second model. Cells expressing SH2 domain mutants of Src are partially transformed yet do not exhibit redistribution of cortactin to podosomes, emphasizing the importance of Src localization for this event. The cortactin redistribution is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin and an intact v-Src SH2 domain. Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin alone, however, is not sufficient for cortactin redistribution as illustrated by the NY315 Src mutant. In all instances, the bulk of the cortactin redistributes to the podosomes only when v-Src is also present in podosomes. p80/85 cortactin is not the only protein that interacts with Src in the cytoskeletal matrix. Previous reports have established that activated forms of Src stably interact with a 110-kDa protein (35Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Wang H.-C. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 36Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Wang H.C.-R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3951-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) that is associated with actin stress filaments(37Flynn D.C. Leu T.-H. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7892-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that activated c-Src also stably interacts with pp125FAK(38Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.-H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), a tyrosine kinase associated with focal adhesions(31Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.A. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Unlike cortactin, however, the association of activated Src with pp110 and pp125FAK does not appear to be dependent on Src kinase activity(37Flynn D.C. Leu T.-H. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7892-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 38Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.-H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). pp125FAK isolated from nontransformed cells is autophosphorylated on tyrosine and is able to efficiently bind to the Src SH2 domain(38Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.-H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that Src is initially recruited to the cytoskeletal matrix through an interaction with pp125FAK. As the functional significance of such Src-cytoskeletal associations are determined, it will become possible to elucidate the mechanism by which Src mediates the various cellular changes characteristic of transformation.

First strand cDNA synthesis was carried out with oligo(dT) and random primers using the cDNA Cycle Kit (Invitrogen), and DNA amplification was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers to mouse testis expressed sequence tag F220A (GenBankÔ accession number L26737). Fifty pmol each of 5′-primer (5′-GGATATTGCTGATAATCCAGTTGAAAAC-3′) and 3′-primer (5′-GATATACCTGCCTTTGCTTCAGAGG-3′) were used with Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) for 35 cycles of 94°C, 2 min; 50°C, 2 min; 72°C, 3 min. The single PCR product of 314 bp was ligated into pCRÔII plasmid (Invitrogen), and sequenced by dideoxy chain termination using Sequenase II polymerase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The 314-bp insert of the pCRÔII subclone (TA314) was used as a template for probe synthesis by PCR as above, using [α-32P]dATP in the reaction. 32P-Labeled PCR product was used to probe an adult mouse multiple tissue poly(A+) Northern blot (Clontech) at ~2 × 106 cpm/ml, under manufacturer's conditions. Final washing was performed at 50°C in 0.1 × SSC (1 × SSC is 150 mM NaCl, 15 mM Na3citrate, pH 7.0), 0.1% SDS for 40 min, and hybridizing bands were visualized by autoradiography at -80°C with intensifying screens. Washing at 65°C for 60 min had no effect on either the tissue distribution or number of bands seen. Subclone TA228 was produced by PCR amplification of mouse testis cDNA described above, with 5′-primer (5′-TTGTCCACCAACTTCAGCTCTGGCTGTC-3′) and 3′-primer (5′-AGCTAAGGACCTTTCTATTTGG-3′) for 35 cycles of 94°C, 2 min; 47°C, 2 min; 72°C, 3 min, followed by ligation and sequencing of the 228-bp product as above. Approximately 106 subclones were screened from both a Lambda Max1 mouse testis 5′-stretch cDNA library (Clontech) and Uni-ZapÔ XR mouse diaphragm cDNA library (Stratagene) per manufacturer's instructions. Subclone TA314 was used for probe synthesis by PCR as described above. Final washing of nitrocellulose filters was performed at 65°C in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 60 min. Positive subclones were identified by autoradiography and plaque-purified. Phagemids were excised and rescued from purified phage according to the manufacturer. Stratagene library phagemid, ST9, contained an insert of 1150 bp which overlapped the sequence of all the other phagemid clones isolated. All rescued phagemids were sequenced on both strands as above. Phagemid ST9 was used as template for in vitro transcription/translation using [35S]Met and the TNTÔ Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega), according to the manufacturer. Protein products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and identified by autoradiography without enhancement. Coding sequence contained within the 886-bp fragment of an NcoI/XhoI partial digest of ST9 was ligated into the NcoI/XhoI sites of bacterial expression plasmid, pGEX-KG(18Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar), to produce pGEX-Native (NA) plasmid. Mutation of Gly120 to Cys (G120C) was accomplished by PCR amplification with pGEX-specific 5′-primer (kindly provided by Dr. G. Zhou) and mutated ST9 3′-primer (5′-ACTTCTAGAGATACCTGCATTRCAATGGAC-3′) for 35 cycles of 94°C, 2 min; 45°C, 1.5 min; 72°C, 1.5 min. The 383-bp XbaI fragment of pGEX-NA was replaced with the corresponding XbaI fragment of the PCR reaction to produce pGEX-G120C. The identities of both pGEX constructs were confirmed by sequencing and differed only in the two nucleotides that convert Gly120 codon (GGG) to cysteine (TGC). The pGEX-NA and -G120C plasmids were used separately to transform competent BL21/DE3 bacteria to produce GST-NA and GST-G120C fusion proteins by established procedures(18Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). GST-fusion proteins were separated from bacterial proteins by incubation with glutathione-agarose beads, washing, and elution off the beads in the presence of glutathione. The purity of eluted proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Three different quantitative enzymatic assays were performed on GST-G120C, exactly as described for human dsPTPase, VHR(8Denu J.M. Zhou G. Wu L. Zhao R. Yuvaniyama J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3796-3803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). All assays were performed at 30°C, in a three-component buffer consisting of 0.05 M Tris, 0.05 M Bis-Tris, and 0.1 M acetate. Hydrolysis of PTPase substrate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP), was followed as an increase in absorbance at 405 nm of the reaction product, p-nitrophenol. Initial rates at various initial substrate concentrations were fitted directly to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the nonlinear least squares program, Kinetasyst for the Macintosh (IntelliKinetics, State College, PA). A continuous spectrophotometric assay was used to follow the Tyr(P) dephosphorylation of Tyr(P)/Thr(P)-containing peptides as described previously(8Denu J.M. Zhou G. Wu L. Zhao R. Yuvaniyama J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3796-3803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The complete time course of the reaction was fitted to a modified integrated form of the Michaelis-Menten equation using a nonlinear least squares algorithm to obtain kinetic parameters kcat and Km. The third method involved reverse phase HPLC separation and quantitation of the substrates and products from the reaction of GST-GC with MAP177-189 kinase peptide DHTGFLpTEpYVATR(8Denu J.M. Zhou G.

With this method, the rate of enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis at Thr(P) was determined as above. We identified an expressed sequence tag isolated from mouse testis (GenBankÔ accession number L26737) that contained a partial open reading frame homologous to the active site of dual-specificity protein-tyrosine phosphatases (dsPTPases)(1Keyse S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Several amino acids critical for phosphatase activity were conserved (8Denu J.M. Zhou G. Wu L. Zhao R. Yuvaniyama J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3796-3803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); however, there appeared to be a glycine substitution for the conserved cysteine within the active site of the putative phosphatase (Fig. 1A). Site-directed mutagenesis of the corresponding Cys, to Ser, has been shown previously to inactivate several dsPTPases catalytically(7Zhou G. Denu J.M. Wu L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

Since it was possible that the Gly codon reflected errors in the original data base entry (i.e. a sequencing or PCR error), we initially attempted to confirm the sequence of the open reading frame. Primers were designed to specifically amplify a 314-bp sequence encompassing the Gly substitution and were used in PCR reactions with cDNA of reverse-transcribed mouse testis poly(A+) RNA. As a consequence of the Gly substitution (Val-His-Gly), a unique NcoI site was created (5′-GTC CAT GGG-3′) which would not be found at the active site (Val-His-Cys) of PTPases (5′-GTN CAY TGY-3′). PCR reactions yielded a single product of 314 bp which was completely digested by NcoI (not shown), suggesting not only that the Gly codon substitution existed in the poly(A+) RNA, but that a Cys-containing codon (i.e. catalytically active homologue) did not exist. The entire PCR reaction product was ligated into vector, and the sequence of 30 subclones all contained the glycine substitution (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained using mouse genomic DNA, reverse-transcribed mouse testis total RNA, and reverse-transcribed rat pancreas poly(A+) RNA as templates for PCR (not shown), suggesting that the glycine codon did not arise from post-transcriptional modification and that its expression was not restricted to mouse. Hybridization of the 314-bp PCR product to mouse poly(A+) RNA demonstrated bands at 4.6, 2.4, 1.5 and 1.2 kb, with highest abundance in skeletal muscle, testis, and heart (Fig. 1C). Collectively, these observations suggested that the Gly codon was present in the expressed sequence tag, was also present in genomic DNA as well as poly(A+) RNA, and that it was expressed in several tissues of both mouse and rat. In an effort to obtain a full-length subclone, cDNA libraries from mouse testis and skeletal muscle were screened with the 314 bp PCR product described above. Several overlapping subclones were rescued and sequenced, with the longest clones from the two libraries (ST9 and CT20) schematically represented in Fig. 2A. Additional subclones were identified by PCR (TA228) and data base searches (EST2). All subclones contained identical nucleotide sequence in their 5′ ends (bases 1-759), including the Gly codon in the putative active site; however, the 3′ ends appeared to encode two distinct amino acid sequences. One subset of clones (EST1, TA314, and TA228) contained nucleotides 760-895 which code for the carboxyl terminus seen in the original expressed sequenced tag. The remaining clones (CT20, EST2, and ST9) lacked these 136 nucleotides and consequently encoded a different carboxyl end. Interestingly, nucleotides 896-1273 were identical for all the subclones, suggesting that the two forms were alternatively spliced products of the same mRNA (entire composite nucleotide sequence deposited as GenBankÔ U34973). Moreover, examination of nucleotides 760-895 revealed a strong similarity to the consensus sequences of intron borders (see (19Green M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 559-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) for review), except for substitution of cytosine for guanine at the +1 position of the putative 5′ donor site (Fig. 2B). Substitution for guanine at this position has been shown to attenuate intron splicing efficiency (19Green M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 559-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) and is implicated in the retention of introns in mRNA from genes underlying disease states(20Nakai K. Sakamoto H. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 141: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Thus, the alternative splicing of this region could give rise to proteins with different carboxyl ends (Fig. 2A, Spliced and Unspliced), while preserving the glycine codon within the putative active site. Attempts to isolate the 136-bp “intron” from commercial cDNA libraries were unsuccessful; however, semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR with poly(A+) mouse testis RNA showed a relative abundance of spliced to unspliced product of approximately 100:1, respectively (not shown). Since the size of the ST9 subclone (1.16 kb) approximately equaled the smallest poly(A+) RNA species seen by Northern analysis (Fig. 1C), we examined the nature of the cell-free translation products expressed in a rabbit reticulocyte system. Protein products of ~25 and 23 kDa (Fig. 3A) agreed very well with the predicted sizes (25.4 and 22.6 kDa) of proteins utilizing methionine codons at nucleotide positions 256-258 and 328-330 (GenBankÔ U34973), respectively. Since both methionines reside in the same open reading frame, the upstream Met256-258 was designated residue +1 of an open reading frame coding for 223 amino acids (Fig. 3B). There remains the possibility that the ST9 sequence represents a partial open reading frame contained within longer mRNAs (Fig. 1C); however, additional support for Met256-258 as a translational start site comes from surrounding nucleotide similarity (5′-GGG ACC ATG G-3′) with the consensus sequence of vertebrate start sites (5′-GCC RCC ATG R-3′)(17Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). Met256-258 also correlates with the known start site of human dsPTPase, VHR (9Ishibashi T. Bottaro D.P. Chan A. Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12170-12174Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B), which operationally defines the smallest PTPase domain. We have named the sequence defined by the ST9-Met256-258 reading frame, STYX, for phosphoserine/threonine/tyrosine interaction protein. The putative alternative carboxyl terminus (Unspliced, Fig. 2A) is referred to as STNS, for alternatively spliced intron of STYX. Amino acid comparison of STYX with VHR revealed extensive sequence similarity (46.4%), including the conservation of VHR residues Asp92 and Arg130, previously shown to be important for substrate binding (8Denu J.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3796-3803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).2 The STYX coding sequence shown in Fig. 3B was ligated into pGEX-KG vector (18Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar) and expressed as a GST-fusion protein. Purified GST-STYX fusion protein failed to show any hydrolytic activity toward the PTPase substrate, para-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) (Fig. 4A). Since STYX contained all the structural elements thought to be important for dsPTPase activity(8Denu J.M. Zhou G. Wu L. Zhao R. Yuvaniyama J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3796-3803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), except the active-site Cys, we thought that replacing the naturally occurring Gly with Cys might restore catalytic activity. Mutation of Gly120 to Cys (STYX-G120C) conferred phosphatase activity to the fusion protein, as demonstrated by the hydrolysis of pNPP (Fig. 4A), with a kcat of 4.6 s-1 and a Km of 9.4 mM. Interestingly, preliminary studies showed that native STYX can inhibit the pNPP hydrolytic activity of the Cys-containing mutant. 3M. J. Wishart, personal observation. The dual-specific nature of the STYX-G120C mutant was demonstrated through its dephosphorylation of both Tyr(P) and Thr(P) of diphosphorylated MAP kinase peptide (Fig. 4B). Removal of GST via thrombin cleavage had no effect on the activity of either native STYX or the G120C mutant (not shown). Surprisingly, the kinetics of hydrolysis for STYX-G120C mutant were comparable to native dsPTPase, VHR(8Denu J.M. Zhou G. Wu L. Zhao R. Yuvaniyama J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3796-3803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), including inhibition by vanadate, 4M. J. Wishart, J. M. Denu, J. A. Williams, and J. E. Dixon, manuscript in preparation. suggesting that the Gly-containing STYX possessed all the structural components necessary for phosphorylated substrate binding similar to dsPTPases. We realize that the artificial substrates, pNPP and diphosphorylated peptides, only serve to indicate the potential function of STYX. The search for an in vivo phosphoprotein(s) which selectively bind to STYX is currently underway. We believe that STYX is the first example of a naturally occurring binding domain that is structurally similar to dsPTPases. Recent enzymatic (8Denu J.M. Zhou G. Wu L. Zhao R. Yuvaniyama J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3796-3803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and crystallographic studies2 have implicated aspartic acid and arginine residues, as well as the amide backbone of the conserved catalytic loop, in coordinating and binding substrate phosphoryl groups by dsPTPases. Since STYX contains these structural components of the binding pocket, it may share a degree of overlap in substrate preference with dsPTPases. If this is the case, the function of STYX may be to bind phosphorylated dsPTPase substrates and thereby protect them from serine/threonine phosphatases. The existence of a “protective factor” has been proposed recently for MAPK signaling(5Alessi D.R. Gomez N. Moorhead G. Lewis T. Keyse S.M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 283-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), and STYX would be predicted to have properties consistent with this function. The biological properties of STYX are currently under investigation. We thank Drs. K.-L. Guan and C. Worby for critical reading of the manuscript, and Dr. Gaochao Zhou for helpful suggestions and many of the reagents used throughout the course of this work."

INTRODUCTIONPhosphorylation is a rapid and reversible means of regulating protein activity. Its efficiency is evident in the many signal transduction pathways that use cascades of phosphorylation to effect cellular responses(1Fisher E.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol.

Protein kinase C plays a major role in many of these pathways(4Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4018) Google Scholar, 5Azzi A. Boscoboinik D. Hensey C. Eur. J.

It is a serine/threonine kinase dependent on calcium and phospholipids and activated by diacylglycerols, fatty acids, or phorbol esters at physiological calcium concentrations(7Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar). 12 members of the mammalian protein kinase C family have been identified so far(8Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Regions of conservation as well as proteolysis studies indicate that protein kinase C is comprised of two domains, an N-terminal regulatory domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain(9Coussens L.

Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2291-2297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation is particularly intriguing in that it has been shown to be an intramolecular reaction(12Newton A.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10185-10188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in which regions very distinct in the primary sequence have access to the active site(13Flint A.J. Paladini R.D. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1990; 249: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). When separated from the regulatory domain by proteolysis, the catalytic domain is no longer able to autophosphorylate, even though it is still fully active against substrates(12Newton A.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10185-10188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Six in vitro autophosphorylation sites have been identified in the βII isozyme(13Flint A.J. Paladini R.D. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1990; 249: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Ser16 and Thr17 are located close to the autoinhibitory sequence in the primary structure. Thr314 and Thr324 are located in the hinge region between the catalytic and regulatory domains. Thr634 and Thr641 are in the C terminus and are the only sites conserved in all the conventional protein kinase C isozymes. These residues are outside the region conserved in most other serine/threonine kinases.Recent studies in vitro and in vivo have elucidated a definite role for phosphorylation of protein kinase C. Phosphorylation by a second kinase is thought to be necessary in the activation of the kinase in vivo(14Pears C. Stabel S. Cazaubon S. Parker P.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 283: 515-518Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Cazaubon S.M. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17559-17563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies of Thr497 and Thr500 in protein kinase C isozyme α and β, respectively, have proposed phosphorylation of those residues as critical for activity in vivo and/or in vitro(15Cazaubon S.M.

In addition, mutations of the in vitro autophosphorylation sites in protein kinase C βI suggest a role for the C-terminal sites, Thr635 and Thr643 in protein kinase C localization, activation, and down-regulation(18Zhang J. Wang L. Petrin J. Bishop W.R. Bond R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6130-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Since previous results indicated that protein kinase C is phosphorylated in vivo and that phosphorylation is essential for activation, it is important to determine whether these phosphorylation sites are identical to in vitro autophosphorylation sites. The baculovirus expression system was chosen for protein kinase C expression because of the ease of purifying a single isozyme. Previous work has shown that the gel mobility and in vitro autophosphorylation pattern were identical between protein kinase C βII overexpressed in insect cells and purified from rat brain(13Flint A.J. Paladini R.D. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1990; 249: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphatase-treated protein kinase C from both sources exhibit similar gel shifts, suggesting identical phosphorylation patterns(19Dutil E.M. Keranen L.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newton A.C.

Roberts G.D. Johnson W. Carr S.A. Covey T.R. Biomed. Environ. Mass Spectrom. 1990; 19: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). LC/ESIMS analysis yields singly or multiply protonated peptide ions, and from the m/z value of these ions, the molecular mass of the corresponding peptide can be determined. Similarly, liquid secondary ionization mass spectrometry (LSIMS) analysis usually yields only molecular weight data in the form of protonated peptide ions. These ions can be activated by collision with inert gas atoms, such as helium. The dissociation induced this way usually reveals the amino acid sequence of the peptide analyzed. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) analysis offers a tool to determine the amino acid sequence of the peptide and the exact site(s) of phosphorylation(25Gibson B.W. Cohen P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 480-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); while under reaction conditions required for Edman degradation, the phosphate group is hydrolyzed or eliminated from phosphorylated serines or threonines. Tandem mass spectrometry permits CID analysis in mixtures by allowing the precursor ion selection for collisional activation. Therefore, we used LC/ESIMS and high energy CID analysis to identify the in vivo phosphorylation sites in protein kinase C βII.RESULTSTo study the post-translational modifications of protein kinase C, we expressed protein kinase C βII in insect cells. The tryptic digest of the carboxymethylated protein was analyzed both by reversed-phase HPLC, followed by LSIMS, and by on-line LC/ESIMS. Tryptic peptides were identified by comparison of the molecular masses observed with those predicted from the published sequence(26Knopf J.L. Lee M.H. Sultzman L.A. Kriz R.W. Loomis C.R. Hewick R.M. Bell R.M. Cell. 1986; 46: 491-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar); more than 90% of the sequence was identified (Fig. 1). The missing components are small hydrophilic peptides. Post-translational or other covalent modifications can be indicated by discrepancies between the predicted and observed molecular masses. For example, the expected N-terminal tryptic peptide at mass to charge ratio (m/z) 1897.9 was not detected; however, a molecular mass (1809.0 Da) observed in the LC/ESIMS experiment and later measured also by LSIMS (MH+ at m/z 1808.8) suggested that the N-terminal methionine had been replaced by an N-acetyl group. This hypothesis has been confirmed by high energy CID analysis (data not shown). Phosphopeptides were identified based on the 80-Da mass difference between the predicted and observed molecular masses. Addition of a phosphate group increases the molecular mass of a peptide by 80 Da. Four phosphopeptides were identified in the digest with molecular masses of 1677.4 Da (rt∼ 36 min), 2484.6 Da (rt∼ 51 min), 3630.0 Da (rt∼ 56.5 min), and 2771.5 Da (rt∼ 57 min), corresponding to phosphorylated sequences His636-Arg649, Thr500-Lys520, Glu490-Lys520, and Asn650-Lys672, respectively. Fig. 2 shows the HPLC chromatogram of the tryptic digest. No evidence for phosphorylation on multiple sites on a single tryptic peptide was detected.Figure 2:HPLC chromatogram of carboxymethylated protein kinase C tryptic digest. The tryptic peptides (∼70 pmol) were separated by reversed-phase HPLC on a Vydac C18, 1.0 mm, inner diameter × 250-mm column. Solvent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and solvent B was 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. The eluant was monitored at 215 nm. Phosphopeptide His636-Arg649 started to elute in peak 1. Peak 2 contained both the non-modified and phosphorylated peptides for this sequence. Peptides corresponding to non-modified and phosphorylated Thr500-Lys520 eluted in peak 3 (See Fig. 5). Phosphopeptide Glu490-Lys520 eluted in peak 4. Phosphopeptide Asn650-Lys672 eluted in peak 5. These species were not fully separated and coeluted with other tryptic peptides. Peak 6 contained peptide Asn650-Lys672 without any covalent modification. AUFS (absorbance units full scale) gives the relative peak absorbance.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)High energy CID analysis was used to confirm the peptide sequence and identify the exact site of phosphorylation. High energy CID processes lead to bond cleavages all along the peptide backbone(30Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A.L. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1994; 6: 284-303Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The proton can be retained on either of the newly formed species, yielding an ionic and a neutral fragment; the mass spectrometer only detects ionized molecules. Ions with charge retention at the N terminus are designated as a, b, and c ions, while those at the C terminus are designated as x, y, and z ions, respectively. Fragment ions a and x are the products of a bond cleavage between the α-carbon and the carbonyl group. Ions b and y are formed from cleavage of the peptide bond itself. Fragments c and z are generated when the cleavage occurs between the amino group and the α-carbon. Fragment ions v, w, and d are formed by a backbone and a side chain cleavage, with charge retention on the C or the N terminus, respectively(30Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A.L. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1994; 6: 284-303Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 31Johnson R.S. Martin S.A. Biemann K. Int. J. Mass Spect. Ion Proc. 1988; 86: 137-154Crossref Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The expected mass values of the fragments can be calculated for peptides with known amino acid sequence.The peptide of molecular mass of 1677.6 Da was subjected to high energy CID analysis, which confirmed the amino acid sequence as His636-Arg649 and the presence of a phosphate group at Thr641 (Fig. 3). This peptide was observed without modification as well (rt∼ 37 min). Based on the relative ion abundances of the phosphorylated and non-modified peptides from LC/ESIMS analysis and in vitro autophosphorylation studies(13Flint A.J. Paladini R.D. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1990; 249: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), it is estimated that this site is phosphorylated at least 75%.Figure 3:High energy CID spectrum of phosphorylated peptide His636-Arg649. MH+ = 1677.8. Fragment ions are labeled according to the accepted nomenclature(40Biemann K. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 886-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since both peptides Glu490-Lys520 and Thr500-Lys520 were observed with a molecular mass increase of 80 Da, and peptide Glu490-Lys520 was observed only without the phosphate group, it can be deduced that the modification occurs either on Thr500 or Thr504. Phosphopeptide Glu490-Lys520 was subjected to digestion with various enzymes to produce smaller peptides more suitable for high energy CID experiments. The peptide proved to be resistant to chymotrypsin, and endoproteinase Glu-C removed only the C-terminal nine amino acids. Digestion with endoproteinase Asp-N eventually yielded a phosphopeptide in the desired molecular weight range, D494GVTTKTFC*GTP505 with MH+ at m/z 1364.6, which was then subjected to high energy CID analysis (Fig. 4). Fragment ions with charge retention at the N terminus for the first six residues do not indicate the presence of any covalent modification. However, N-terminal fragment ion a7 (at m/z 755) that results from a cleavage between the α carbon of Thr500 and its carbonyl group exhibits an 80-Da mass shift, corresponding to a phosphate group. Similarly all the other N-terminal ions containing Thr500 display this 80-Da mass shift. C-terminal ion y2, which is formed via peptide bond cleavage between Gly503 and Thr504 with charge retention at the C terminus, was detected at m/z 217, thus indicating no covalent modification at Thr504. Thus, the modification occurred at Thr500. A peptide for Thr500-Lys520 with no modification was detected as a minor component in the LC/ESIMS experiment (rt∼ 51 min, Fig. 5). Peptide Glu490-Lys520 was only detected with the modification. The site occupancy for Thr500 is estimated to be higher than 90%.Figure 4:High energy CID spectrum of phosphorylated peptide Asp494-Pro505. MH+ = 1364.6. N-terminal sequence ions starting from the amino acid at position 7 (Thr500) show the 80-Da mass shift. The cysteine marked with an asterisk is carboxymethylated. Ions labeled with asterisks are matrix-related background ions(41Falick A.M. Medzihradszky K.F. Walls F.C. Rapid Commun.

This spectrum was recorded in an LC/ESIMS experiment from approximately 70 pmol of the tryptic digest. The average molecular masses of the peptides observed are shown. The calculated average molecular masses are 2405.7 and 2485.7 Da for the non-modified and for the phosphopeptide, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The identity of phosphopeptide Asn650-Lys672 was confirmed by Edman degradation (see Table 1). The mass is increased by a single 80-Da increment, indicating one phosphate group per peptide. Since the peptide contains three possible phosphorylation sites, Ser654, Ser660, and Ser664, attempts were made to produce peptides containing individual phosphorylation sites. The peptide was resistant to endoproteinases Glu-C and Asp-N; endoproteinase Asp-N was tried since it was reported to cleave at the N terminus of not only aspartic acids but also at the N terminus of other negatively charged residues such as cysteic acids (32Drapeau G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 839-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and glutamic acids(24Hemling M.E. Roberts G.D. Johnson W. Carr S.A. Covey T.R. Biomed. Environ. Mass Spectrom. 1990; 19: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Chymotryptic digestion yielded a phosphopeptide, Asn650-Phe666, still containing all three serine residues. Based on the UV and LC/ESIMS data, the occupancy of on peptide Asn650-Lys672 is estimated to be greater than 80%. Keranen, Dutil, and Newton have informed us 2L. M. Keranen, E. M. Dutil, and A. C. Newton, personal communication. that the phosphorylation occurs at Ser660. This correlates well with the high degree of conservation of Ser660 in comparison with Ser654 and Ser664 (Fig. 6).TABLE I Open table in a new tab Figure 6:Sequence alignment of phosphopeptide, Asn650-Lys672, of protein kinase C βII with seven other members of the protein kinase C family.

Notably, this phosphopeptide falls within a defined variable region.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThree distinct sites of phosphorylation, Thr500, Thr641, and one of the serines on phosphopeptide, Asn650-Lys672, were determined by mass spectrometry (Fig. 7). Each site was phosphorylated greater than 75%. Thr500 lies in the conserved serine/threonine kinase catalytic region. Thr641 lies outside that conserved region, but the residue itself is conserved in the protein kinase C family. Phosphopeptide Asn650-Lys672 is at the C terminus and lies within a region defined as variable among the major members of the protein kinase C family.Figure 7:Linear representation of the primary sequence of protein kinase C βII, indicating the location of phosphorylation sites. In vivo sites or phosphopeptides, identified by mass spectrometry, are marked by arrows. In vitro autophosphorylation sites are shown in the filled circles. Hatched regions indicate the areas conserved in the protein kinase C family. The region conserved with other serine/threonine kinases is marked by the bracket.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Of the autophosphorylation sites previously identified in vitro(13Flint A.J. Paladini R.D. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1990; 249: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), only Thr641 is detected in this analysis of unstimulated sample. The fact that 75% of the sample is already phosphorylated at this residue explains the apparent low labeling level detected in the in vitro autophosphorylation studies. A single mutation to alanine at the corresponding residue in the βI isozyme decreases activity in vivo, and the mutant is no longer able to autophosphorylate(33Zhang J. Wang L. Schwartz J. Bond R.W. Bishop W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent work using phosphatase treatment and subsequent autophosphorylation of protein kinase C βII has suggested that protein kinase C is solely responsible for phosphorylation of this residue(19Dutil E.M. Keranen L.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).It is notable that only one of six in vitro autophosphorylation sites was found to be phosphorylated in this study. The difference between the level of protein kinase C stimulation in vitro (activation by diacylglycerol, Ca2+, and phosphatidylserine) (13Flint A.J. Paladini R.D. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1990; 249: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and in vivo (no artificial stimulation) could explain a lack of autophosphorylation. However, one of the sites, Thr641, is phosphorylated, which suggests that protein kinase C was activated in vivo. If protein kinase C autophosphorylates itself at Thr641, why are the other autophosphorylation sites also not phosphorylated? Possible explanations are (a) degree of accessibility of Thr641 relative to the other sites, (b) sensitivity or resistance to phosphatases, (c) specific post-translational processing of protein kinase C(19Dutil E.M. Keranen L.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), (d) a second kinase phosphorylating only Thr641(33Zhang J. Wang L. Schwartz J. Bond R.W. Bishop W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or (e) discrepancies between the plasma membrane in vivo and detergent micelles in vitro. Further work will be needed to clarify this issue.The observed phosphorylation of protein kinase C at Thr500 is interesting in view of known serine/threonine kinase structures. In protein kinase A(34Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar), a phosphorylated residue at this position is necessary for the integrity of the active site structure. In the modeled protein kinase C structure, a phosphorylated threonine would be able to interact with surrounding residues in a manner very reminiscent to protein kinase A (17Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27715-27718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These residues are conserved in many other serine/threonine kinases(35Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3782) Google Scholar). Complete in vivo phosphorylation at Thr500 supports the conclusion that it is the activating phosphorylation site conserved in many kinases(36Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Structure. 1994; 2: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar).Phosphorylation at Thr500 agrees with biochemical evidence that this residue is critical for activity. Mutagenesis studies demonstrated that Thr497 and Thr500 in the α and βII isozymes, respectively, were essential for activity(16Cazaubon S. Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 17Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27715-27718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The authors suggested that a second kinase must be phosphorylating and thus activating protein kinase C. In fact, replacement of Thr500 in the βII isozyme with glutamate restored complete activity and suggests that it is the phosphorylation of the residue that is critical(17Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27715-27718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thorsness and Koshland (37Thorsness P.E. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10422-10425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that an aspartate can mimic the presence and an alanine the absence of an inhibitory phosphorylation in isocitrate dehydrogenase. In protein kinase C, it appears that the larger glutamate is better able to maintain the integrity of the active site. These studies are in agreement with our identification of greater than 90% in vivo phosphorylation at Thr500.Deletion studies of protein kinase C α (38Su L. Parissenti A.M. Riedel H. Receptors Channels. 1993; 1: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that phosphorylation near the C terminus is critical for protein kinase C activity. Truncation of 23 amino acids from the C terminus fully inactivates the kinase(38Su L. Parissenti A.M. Riedel H. Receptors Channels. 1993; 1: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar); Ser660 corresponds to the 16th residue from the C terminus in the α isozyme (Fig. 6). In addition, the high degree of conservation of Ser660 suggests a potential family-wide regulation (Fig. 6).We have determined in vivo phosphorylation sites of unstimulated protein kinase C βII. All three of these regions appear to play a strong role in protein kinase C function. Phosphorylation at a particular residue such as Thr500 may be of structural importance. The other phosphorylated sites may be involved in substrate recognition or activator affinity. The fact that activators of protein kinase C increase the phosphorylation state while epidermal growth factor decreases the phosphorylation state (39Mitchell F.E. Marais R.M. Parker P.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 261: 131-136Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) suggests that phosphorylation is an important means of regulating protein kinase C activity. INTRODUCTIONPhosphorylation is a rapid and reversible means of regulating protein activity. Its efficiency is evident in the many signal transduction pathways that use cascades of phosphorylation to effect cellular responses(1Fisher E.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 216: 121-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Pelech S.L. Sanghera J.S. Daya-Makin M. Biochem. Cell.

Protein kinase C plays a major role in many of these pathways(4Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4018) Google Scholar, 5Azzi A. Boscoboinik D. Hensey C. Eur. J.

It is a serine/threonine kinase dependent on calcium and phospholipids and activated by diacylglycerols, fatty acids, or phorbol esters at physiological calcium concentrations(7Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar). 12 members of the mammalian protein kinase C family have been identified so far(8Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Regions of conservation as well as proteolysis studies indicate that protein kinase C is comprised of two domains, an N-terminal regulatory domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain(9Coussens L. Parker P.J. Rhee L. Yang-Feng T.L. Chen E. Waterfield M.D. Francke U. Ullrich A. Science. 1986; 233: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 10Kikkawa U. Takai Y. Minakuchi R. Inohara S. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13341-13348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Protein kinase C autophosphorylates itself in vitro on both its regulatory and catalytic domains(11Mochly-Rosen D. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2291-2297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation is particularly intriguing in that it has been shown to be an intramolecular reaction(12Newton A.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10185-10188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in which regions very distinct in the primary sequence have access to the active site(13Flint A.J. Paladini R.D. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1990; 249: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). When separated from the regulatory domain by proteolysis, the catalytic domain is no longer able to autophosphorylate, even though it is still fully active against substrates(12Newton A.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10185-10188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Six in vitro autophosphorylation sites have been identified in the βII isozyme(13Flint A.J. Paladini R.D. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1990; 249: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Ser16 and Thr17 are located close to the autoinhibitory sequence in the primary structure. Thr314 and Thr324 are located in the hinge region between the catalytic and regulatory domains. Thr634 and Thr641 are in the C terminus and are the only sites conserved in all the conventional protein kinase C isozymes. These residues are outside the region conserved in most other serine/threonine kinases.Recent studies in vitro and in vivo have elucidated a definite role for phosphorylation of protein kinase C. Phosphorylation by a second kinase is thought to be necessary in the activation of the kinase in vivo(14Pears C. Stabel S. Cazaubon S. Parker P.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 283: 515-518Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Cazaubon S.M. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17559-17563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies of Thr497 and Thr500 in protein kinase C isozyme α and β, respectively, have proposed phosphorylation of those residues as critical for activity in vivo and/or in vitro(15Cazaubon S.M. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17559-17563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Cazaubon S. Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 17Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27715-27718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, mutations of the in vitro autophosphorylation sites in protein kinase C βI suggest a role for the C-terminal sites, Thr635 and Thr643 in protein kinase C localization, activation, and down-regulation(18Zhang J. Wang L. Petrin J. Bishop W.R. Bond R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6130-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Since previous results indicated that protein kinase C is phosphorylated in vivo and that phosphorylation is essential for activation, it is important to determine whether these phosphorylation sites are identical to in vitro autophosphorylation sites. The baculovirus expression system was chosen for protein kinase C expression because of the ease of purifying a single isozyme. Previous work has shown that the gel mobility and in vitro autophosphorylation pattern were identical between protein kinase C βII overexpressed in insect cells and purified from rat brain(13Flint A.J. Paladini R.D. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1990; 249: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphatase-treated protein kinase C from both sources exhibit similar gel shifts, suggesting identical phosphorylation patterns(19Dutil E.M. Keranen L.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Mass spectrometry has been successfully used for the determination of phosphorylation sites in various proteins, such as the chemotaxis response regulator protein from Escherichia coli(20Sanders D.A.

LC/ESIMS analysis yields singly or multiply protonated peptide ions, and from the m/z value of these ions, the molecular mass of the corresponding peptide can be determined. Similarly, liquid secondary ionization mass spectrometry (LSIMS) analysis usually yields only molecular weight data in the form of protonated peptide ions. These ions can be activated by collision with inert gas atoms, such as helium. The dissociation induced this way usually reveals the amino acid sequence of the peptide analyzed. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) analysis offers a tool to determine the amino acid sequence of the peptide and the exact site(s) of phosphorylation(25Gibson B.W. Cohen P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 480-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); while under reaction conditions required for Edman degradation, the phosphate group is hydrolyzed or eliminated from phosphorylated serines or threonines. Tandem mass spectrometry permits CID analysis in mixtures by allowing the precursor ion selection for collisional activation. Therefore, we used LC/ESIMS and high energy CID analysis to identify the in vivo phosphorylation sites in protein kinase C βII."

PSGL-1 is a 220-kDa, disulfide-linked homodimeric sialomucin, which, when expressed in COS cells with the appropriate fucosyltransferase, binds P-selectin in a similar calcium-dependent manner to the receptor on neutrophils. PSGL-1 has a signal peptide sequence of 17 amino acids followed by a 24-amino acid PACE propeptide sequence(8Sako D. Chang X.-J. Barone K.M. Vachino G. White H.M. Shaw G. Veldman G.M. Bean K.M.

The mature N terminus of PSGL-1 contains an unusual stretch of 20 amino acids, which is rich in negatively charged aspartate and glutamate residues and which contains three tyrosine residues that meet the consensus sequence for O-sulfation by Golgi sulfotransferase(s)(9Huttner W.B.

At least one of these tyrosine residues is sulfated as evaluated by site-directed mutagenesis and sulfate labeling experiments. (2)D. Sako, K. M. Comess, K. Barone, R. T. Camphausen, D. A.

PSGL-1 also binds E-selectin. In contrast to P-selectin, however, the requirements for E-selectin recognition are much less rigid. E-selectin binds a number of sialomucin and glycoprotein structures if they co-express the sialyl-Lewis x structure(8Sako D. Chang X.-J. Barone K.M. Vachino G. White H.M. Shaw G. Veldman G.M.

L-selectin binds to a number of different counter-receptors, glycoprotein cell adhesion molecule-1, mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1, and CD34, which, like PSGL-1, are also sialomucins(11McEver R.P. Moore K.L. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11025-11028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). A major question currently unresolved is what determines selectin specificity in the recognition of specific counter-receptor structures. P-, E-, and L-selectin are ~60-70% homologous in their N-terminal, lectin motifs, and each similarly recognizes the sialyl-Lewis x and sialyl-Lewis a carbohydrate structures(11McEver R.P. Moore K.L.

Further, binding of P-selectin to its receptor on neutrophils is 4-5 orders of magnitude more avid than the binding to sialyl-Lewis x(4Moore K.L. Varki A. McEver R.P. J.

While differences in specificity and avidity may in part be accounted for either by the presentation of multiple sialyl-Lewis carbohydrate structures on the receptor mucin core or by subtle differences in carbohydrate structure, it is clear that the protein component of the sialomucin also plays a critical role in selectin interaction(8Sako D.

In the present paper, we describe a highly specific metalloproteinase, mocarhagin, which has been purified from the venom of the Mozambiquan spitting cobra, Naja mocambique mocambique. Mocarhagin cleaves a 10-amino acid peptide from the mature N terminus of PSGL-1 and abolishes the ability of PSGL-1 to bind P-selectin. The results are in accord with the negative charge/sulfated tyrosine cluster at the N terminus of PSGL-1 being an important determinant of P-selectin recognition in addition to its recognition of carbohydrate structure. N. mocambique mocambique venom, diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), aprotinin, and pepstatin were purchased from Sigma; Triton X-100 from BDH, Kilsyth, Victoria, Australia; RPMI tissue culture medium from Flow Laboratories, Irvine, Scotland; fetal bovine serum from Cytosystems, Castle Hill, N.S.W., Australia; heparin-Sepharose CL-6B, protein A-Sepharose, and Sepharose CL-6B from Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden; leupeptin from Auspep, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Sodium [125I]iodide and sodium [3H]borohydride were from DuPont NEN. The PSGL-1 peptide, Thr-3 to Glu-17, was synthesized by Chiron, Melbourne, Australia. Synthetic peptides based on the PSGL-1 sequences Gln-1 to Glu-15 and Asp-9 to Arg-23 (Chiron) containing an N-terminal cysteine residue were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Sigma) with m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide (Pierce), and rabbit antisera were raised and affinity-purified as described previously(15Chong B.H. Murray B. Berndt M.C. Dunlop L.C. Brighton T. Chesterman C.N. Blood. 1994; 83: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Non-immune rabbit IgG was also prepared as described previously(5Skinner M.P. Lucas C.P. Burns G.F. Chesterman C.N. Berndt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5371-5374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purification and characterization of mocarhagin, a 55-kDa cobra venom metalloproteinase, is to be published elsewhere. (3)C. M. Ward, R. K. Andrews, A. I. Smith, and M. C. Berndt, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, mocarhagin was purified from crude venom of the snake, N. mocambique mocambique, based on its heparin binding properties. Crude lyophilized venom (0.5 g) was dissolved in water (10 ml) and loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column (1.5 × 40 cm) at 25 ml/h. Following washing with column buffer containing 0.01 M Tris, 0.15 M sodium chloride, pH 7.4 (TS buffer), bound protein was eluted with a linear 250-ml, 0.15-1.0 M sodium chloride gradient in 0.01 M Tris, pH 7.4. Fractions containing mocarhagin, as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were pooled and concentrated in an Amicon ultrafiltration device and then loaded at 25 ml/h onto a Sepharose CL-6B column (1.5 × 70 cm). Peak eluted fractions were dialyzed against TS buffer. DFP-treated mocarhagin was prepared by treating mocarhagin (250 μg/ml) in TS buffer with 8 mM DFP for 1 h at 22°C, followed by extensive dialysis against the same buffer. Binding of 125I-labeled P-selectin to freshly isolated neutrophils and HL60 cells was performed as described previously in detail(5Skinner M.P. Lucas C.P. Burns G.F. Chesterman C.N. Berndt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5371-5374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the effect of pretreatment of neutrophils or HL60 cells with mocarhagin on P-selectin binding, washed cells (2 × 107/ml) in RPMI made 1% in fetal bovine serum were incubated in the presence or absence of 10 mM EDTA followed by mocarhagin (0.025-100 μg/ml, final concentration) for 30 min at 22°C. P-selectin binding was then assessed either directly or after the cells were centrifuged, washed twice, and resuspended in RPMI with 1% fetal bovine serum. In some experiments, DFP-treated mocarhagin was employed in place of mocarhagin. To evaluate the effect of supernatant from mocarhagin-treated cells on P-selectin binding, HL60 cells at 108/ml in 0.01 M Tris, 0.15 M sodium chloride, 0.001 M calcium chloride, pH 7.4, were incubated with mocarhagin (12 μg/ml) for 10 min at 22°C. The supernatant collected following centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min was made 0.1% in BSA and loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column (0.5 × 5 cm) to remove mocarhagin. The flow-through was then tested for its effect on P-selectin binding to HL60 cells. The effect of anti-PSGL-1 peptide antibodies on P-selectin binding was evaluated by incubating washed neutrophils with antibody for 20 min at 22°C prior to the addition of 125I-labeled P-selectin. In additional control experiments, PSGL-1 peptides (100 μM, final concentration) were mixed with anti-PSGL-1 peptide antibody (100 μg/ml, final concentration) prior to addition to the neutrophils. Washed neutrophils or HL60 cells were surface labeled either by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed radioiodination or with sodium periodate/sodium [3H]borohydride(16Booth W. Berndt M.C. Castaldi P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17Berndt M.C. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 59-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled cells in 0.01 M Tris, 0.15 M sodium chloride, 1 mM calcium chloride, pH 7.4, were incubated with mocarhagin (12 μg/ml, final concentration) or buffer for 10 min at 22°C. The cells were centrifuged at 150 × g for 10 min and washed twice with 0.01 M Hepes, 0.15 M sodium chloride, 0.001 M EDTA, pH 7.4. The cells were then lysed with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 at 4°C for 1 h in the presence of the following protease inhibitors: DFP (0.5 mM), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), pepstatin (1 μM), leupeptin (100 μg/ml), and benzamidine (10 mM). The Triton X-100 soluble fractions separated by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatants from the control and mocarhagin-treated cells were mixed with SDS sample buffer and electrophoresed on a 5-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing and non-reducing conditions or on a two-dimensional non-reduced/reduced gel as described by Phillips and Agin(18Phillips D.R.

A control experiment was also performed where the LECg1 protein A-Sepharose beads were pretreated with mocarhagin and then exhaustively washed prior to presentation of sPSGL-1.T7. For immunoprecipitation analysis of untreated and mocarhagin-treated sPSGL-1.T7, the protease was inactivated by the addition of 5 mM EDTA. sPSGL-1.T7 was then immunoprecipitated with anti-PSGL-1 polyclonal antibodies, Rb3026, raised against COS-produced sPSGL-1.T7 (8Sako D.

Purified sPSGL-1.T7 (20 μg) was digested with 1 μg of mocarhagin in a total volume of 100 μl of TS buffer containing 2 mM calcium chloride for 1 h at 37°C. The protease was inactivated by addition of 10 mM EDTA. The sample was concentrated directly onto Pro-spin (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and subjected to N-terminal sequencing on an ABI M476 gas phase protein sequencer. The synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 3-17 of mature PSGL-1 was dissolved at 0.3 mg/ml in 50 mM Hepes saline buffer, pH 7.4, made 1 mM in calcium chloride, and digested with 10 μg/ml mocarhagin for 1 h. After reverse-phase HPLC separation of the reaction products, N-terminal sequence analysis was performed with an Applied Biosystems model 470A protein sequencer. We have recently identified and purified a novel metalloproteinase, mocarhagin, from the venom of the Mozambiquan spitting cobra, N. mocambique mocambique. The proteinase requires either calcium ion or zinc ion for activity and is fully inhibited by excess EDTA and by high concentrations of DFP. Pretreatment of platelets with mocarhagin abolishes their ability to bind the adhesive ligand, von Willebrand Factor. This is due to proteolysis between Glu-282 and Asp-283, DEGDTDLYDYYPEE¯DTEGD, in the α-chain of the platelet GP Ib-V-IX complex, which occurs as the sole detectable cleavage on the intact platelet surface.3 In the course of these studies, we observed that mocarhagin was also a potent inhibitor of P-selectin binding to its myeloid receptor on neutrophils. Pretreatment of either neutrophils or HL60 cells with mocarhagin profoundly and reproducibly affected the subsequent binding of P-selectin to these treated cells with an apparent IC50 of ~0.1 μg/ml. A representative inhibition curve from multiple studies is shown in Fig. 1. Equivalent data were obtained regardless of whether the mocarhagin-treated cells were washed or not washed prior to the addition of P-selectin. Further, inhibition was not reversed by incubation of the treated cells with fresh medium for up to 3 h. Finally, mocarhagin had no apparent effect on the molecular size of P-selectin or on its inherent ability to bind to myeloid cells (data not shown and see Fig. 2). Treatment of mocarhagin with DFP completely blocked its ability to inhibit P-selectin binding even at 100 μg/ml (Fig. 1), a result in accord with proteolysis of the P-selectin receptor. Consistent with this view, the ability of mocarhagin to inhibit subsequent P-selectin binding was divalent cation- and time-dependent. If cells were incubated with 12 μg/ml mocarhagin for 10 s prior to the addition of EDTA and the cells then washed, P-selectin binding was reduced, even with this brief treatment, to 40% of normal (data not shown). Cell surface labeling studies, however, failed to identify a major substrate for mocarhagin on either neutrophils or HL60 cells (data not shown), a finding consistent with the exquisite substrate specificity of mocarhagin suggested by the platelet studies. In addition, the concentrated supernatant from mocarhagin-treated cells, after removal of mocarhagin by absorption with heparin-Sepharose CL-6B, did not inhibit binding of P-selectin to HL60 cells, indicating that a functional fragment of the P-selectin receptor was not released by mocarhagin treatment.Figure 2:Mocarhagin digestion of soluble P-selectin glycoprotein ligand.

The samples were either directly electrophoresed (lanes 1 and 2) or precipitated with the P-selectin IgG chimera LECg1 (lanes 3 and 4) or precipitated with LECg1, which was pretreated with mocarhagin (LECg1 + mo; lane 5), or immunoprecipitated with Rb3026 (lanes 6 and 7) or with Rb3443 (lanes 8 and 9).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PSGL-1 has recently been identified as a functional ligand for P-selectin on HL60 cells(8Sako D.

Since mocarhagin cleaves the α-chain of GP Ib within this negative charge/sulfated tyrosine cluster (see above), we speculated that mocarhagin may abrogate P-selectin binding to neutrophils and HL60 cells by cleaving near the N terminus of PSGL-1, a result that would explain the failure to identify a major substrate for mocarhagin on myeloid cells. That this is indeed the case is confirmed by the data in Fig. 2. Mocarhagin digestion of PACE-cleaved, fucosylated sPSGL-1.T7 resulted in only a minor shift, if any, in electrophoretic mobility of the protein on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (lanes 1 and 2) but completely abolished the binding of sPSGL-1.T7 to the P-selectin IgG chimera, LECg1(8Sako D.

Chem. 1981; 256: 59-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was raised against COS-produced sPSGL-1.T7, precipitated sPSGL-1 independent of mocarhagin digestion (lanes 6 and 7), whereas Rb3443, which was raised against the N-terminal peptide of PACE-cleaved PSGL-1 (QATEYEYLDYDFLPE), only precipitated untreated sPSGL-1.T7 (lanes 8 and 9), indicating that the N-terminal epitope for Rb3443 is lost after mocarhagin digestion. N-terminal microsequencing of purified, mocarhagin-treated sPSGL-1.T7 protein gave the sequence, DFLPETEPPEML. Mocarhagin thus removes the first 10 amino acids from PACE-cleaved sPSGL-1.T7. The site of cleavage for mocarhagin between Tyr-10 and Asp-11 was confirmed using the synthetic peptide, TEYEYLDYDFLPETE, corresponding to residues 3-17 of mature PSGL-1. The mocarhagin cleavage sites on PSGL-1 and the α-chain of GP Ib are similar. Each occurs on the N-terminal site of an aspartate residue and to the C-terminal side of three potential sulfated tyrosine residues (8Sako D. Chang X.-J. Barone K.M. Vachino G. White H.M. Shaw G.

Since the proteolytic activity of mocarhagin is inhibited by heparin,3 this preference for negative charge cluster may in part explain the remarkable substrate specificity of mocarhagin. Confirmation of the critical importance of the N-terminal sequence of PSGL-1 in P-selectin binding was obtained using anti-peptide antibodies. P-selectin binding to neutrophils was inhibited by 80-90% by an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody against residues Gln-1 to Glu-15 of mature PSGL-1 (QATEYEYLDYDFLPE) but not by an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody against residues Asp-9 to Arg-23 (DYDFLPETEPPEMLR) (Fig. 3) or by non-immune rabbit IgG (not shown). Inhibition by the anti-peptide antibody against Gln-1 to Glu-15 was completely blocked by the presence of either the Gln-1 to Glu-15 or Asp-9 to Arg-23 peptides (data not shown), indicating that anti-peptide antibody, at least in part, recognizes the sequence, Asp-9 to Glu-15. Although P-, E-, and L-selectins all recognize similar sialylated carbohydrate structures such as sialyl-Lewis x (11McEver R.P. Moore K.L. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11025-11028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) and many glycoproteins on the surface of myeloid cells contain sialyl-Lewis x (23Lee N. Wang W.-C.

Chem. 1984; 259: 10925-10935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), P-selectin appears to be highly specific in its recognition of PSGL-1. The present data suggest that one cause for this specificity is the negative charge/sulfated tyrosine cluster at the N terminus of mature PSGL-1. Proteolytic removal of a N-terminal 10-amino acid peptide by mocarhagin abolished P-selectin binding to PSGL-1 even though this sequence (QATEYEYLDY) is not glycosylated. One explanation for this phenomenon is that removal of this sequence alters the conformational integrity of PSGL-1 such that P-selectin can no longer interact with critical carbohydrate structures associated with the PSGL-1 mucin core. This is unlikely for two reasons. First, an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody against the N-terminal 15 amino acids of mature PSGL-1 also strongly inhibited P-selectin binding to neutrophils. Second, E-selectin also binds to PSGL-1(8Sako D. Chang X.-J. Barone K.M. Vachino G. White H.M. Shaw G. Veldman G.M. Bean K.M. Ahem T.J. Furie B. Cumming D.A. Larsen G.R.

An alternative explanation of the present observations is that P-selectin binding to PSGL-1 is bimodal with P-selectin binding not only involving carbohydrate recognition but also the negative charge/sulfated tyrosine cluster. The approximately 4 order of magnitude difference in avidity for P-selectin binding to sialyl-Lewis x versus receptor (11McEver R.P. Moore K.L. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11025-11028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) is strongly suggestive that additional structural determinants are involved in binding of P-selectin to its myeloid receptor. This is supported by the observation that P-selectin binding to myeloid cells not only depends on the N-terminal lectin domain but also involves the adjacent epidermal growth factor-like motif(27Kansas G.S.

We, and subsequently others, have demonstrated that P-selectin binds to heparin and to a wide variety of other sulfated glycans and polyanionic structures(5Skinner M.P. Lucas C.P. Burns G.F.

It is tempting to speculate that the N-terminal negative charge/sulfated tyrosine cluster of PSGL-1 represents an equivalent polyanionic recognition site and that the juxtaposition of this sequence with appropriate sialylated carbohydrate structure explains the specificity of P-selectin recognition.

These are the first mechanism-based inhibitors of this class to be described, and the first mechanism-based inhibitors of any sort for the medically important α-amylase. In addition to having potential as therapeutics, compounds of this class should prove useful in subsequent structural and mechanistic studies of these enzymes. Specific inhibitors of glycosidases have proved valuable in a number of applications ranging from mechanistic studies (Legler, 1990; Sinnott, 1990) through their use to study protein glycosylation (Elbein et al., 1984), to possible therapeutic uses such as the control of blood glucose levels via control of the degradation of dietary disaccharides and starch (Truscheit et al., 1981) or control of viral infectivity through interference with normal glycosylation of viral coat proteins (Elbein, 1984; Prasad et al., 1987). A number of naturally occurring reversible glycosidase inhibitors are known such as nojirimycin, castanospermine, swainsonine, and acarbose (Legler, 1990), and these have been subjected to intensive study including the synthesis and testing of a number of analogues. Another class of inhibitors that has been less well studied is that of the covalent, irreversible type, typically affinity labels. These are generally synthetic analogues of sugars containing reactive groups such as epoxides, isothiocyanates and α-halocarbonyls as reviewed recently (Legler, 1990; Withers and Aebersold, 1995). Less common are the more selective mechanism-based inhibitors whose efficacy depends upon binding and subsequent enzymatic action to generate a reactive species. These include the conduritol epoxides (Legler, 1968, 1970), the quinone methide-generating glycosides (Halazy et al., 1990; Briggs et al., 1992), and the glycosylmethyl triazenes (Marshall et al., 1980; Sinnott and Smith, 1976). Interestingly, two naturally occurring inhibitors of this class have now been described: the hydroxymethylconduritol epoxide, cyclophellitol (Atsumi et al., 1990; Withers and Umezawa, 1991), isolated from Phellinus sp.; and the putative quinone methide-generating glycoside salicortin, isolated from Salix (Clausen et al., 1990). An additional, relatively recently described class of mechanism-based inhibitor that has proved successful is that of the 2-deoxy-2-fluoro (Withers and Aebersold, 1995; Withers et al., 1987, 1988, 1990). These function as excellent inactivators of retaining glycosidases (glycosidases that hydrolyze the glycosidic linkage with net retention of anomeric configuration) by formation of a stable glycosyl-enzyme intermediate which turns over to product only very slowly. As shown in Fig. S1 for an α-glucosidase, the normal mechanism of action of this class of enzyme involves the formation and hydrolysis of a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate with general acid/base catalytic assistance via transition states with substantial oxocarbenium ion character (Sinnott, 1987, 1990). A combination of inductive destabilization of these positively charged transition states by the electronegative fluorine at C-2 and loss of crucial hydrogen bonding interactions with the 2-hydroxyl serves to substantially destabilize these two transition states, dramatically slowing both steps. Incorporation of a relatively reactive leaving group such as fluoride or 2,4-dinitrophenolate as aglycone accelerates the first (glycosylation) step sufficiently that the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate is formed, but then hydrolyzes only very slowly, thereby resulting in inactivation. This strategy has proved very successful with a wide range of retaining β-glycosidases, and has allowed the characterization of this intermediate and the identification of the catalytic nucleophiles in a number of enzymes (Withers and Aebersold, 1995). These compounds have also proved effective in vivo, selectively inactivating the expected glycosidases in all organs tested in rats, including the brain (McCarter et al., 1994). However, as noted early on (Withers et al., 1988), and as has been confirmed in subsequent studies (McCarter et al., 1993), this approach has not been successful with α-glycosidases, despite the fact that ample evidence exists that equivalent mechanisms are followed in the two cases.1 This evidence includes the 13C NMR detection of a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate on an α-amylase (Tao et al., 1989), and the denaturation trapping of such an intermediate on a glycosyl transferase, a mechanistically analogous enzyme (Mooser et al., 1991; Mooser, 1992). Instead, the 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-glycosides function as substrates, albeit poor, for the enzymes studied. Thus the lack of inactivation must be a consequence of the fluorine substituent not sufficiently slowing the deglycosylation step relative to glycosylation, and a possible stereoelectronic rationale for this observation has been proposed (Withers, 1995; Kempton and Withers, 1992). The generation of an effective inhibitor of this class for an α-glycosidase therefore requires further slowing of the deglycosylation step. This could be achieved via the incorporation of a second fluorine at C-2 to further inductively destabilize the transition state, in conjunction with the incorporation of a more reactive leaving group to ensure that glycosylation is not rate-limiting. Since the second fluorine is only slightly larger than the hydrogen it replaces, it would likely not result in any significant steric repulsive interactions upon binding. In this paper we describe such an approach which has led to the development of novel mechanism-based inactivators of both yeast α-glucosidase and human pancreatic α-amylase. This is the first mechanism-based inhibitor described for human pancreatic α-amylase, which should prove valuable as a probe of the structure and mechanism of this medically important enzyme. Compounds of this general class also have considerable potential as therapeutics agents, particularly in the control of post-prandial blood glucose levels by inhibition of digestive glycosidases. Syntheses of the two inhibitors will be described in detail elsewhere.

The concentration of this protein in stock solutions was determined from A280 measurements using an Emg/ml = 2.33 cm-1. α-Amylase studies were carried out in 20 mM sodium phosphate and 25 mM sodium chloride, pH 6.9, at 30°C. Yeast α-glucosidase (Type III) was obtained from Sigma (G 7256). Studies on this enzyme were performed in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer containing bovine serum albumin (0.1%), pH 6.8, 37°C. p-Nitrophenyl-α-glucoside (1 mM) was used as substrate for α-glucosidase, using an extinction coefficient of 7280 M-1 cm-1 (Withers et al., 1988; 1117). α-Amylase activity was measured by following the release of fluoride ion from a 2.1 mM α-maltosyl fluoride (Km = 4.3 mM) solution using an Orion fluoride ion-selective electrode. These were performed by incubating each enzyme in its buffer in the presence of inactivator. Aliquots (5-10 μl) were removed at time intervals and assayed for activity by addition to a large volume (0.25-1 ml) of substrate. This halts inactivation by dilution of the inactivator and by providing high concentrations of a competitive inhibitor, the substrate. First order rate constants for inactivation at each inhibitor concentration were determined by direct fit of the activity versus time data to a first order curve using GraFit (Leatherbarrow, 1990). Concentrations of inactivator were studied for α-amylase with TNPDFM (1.9, 2.5, 3.7, 5.6, 7.5 mM) and α-glucosidase with TNPDFG (1.1, 1.6, 2.2, 2.7, 3.2 mM). Protection of yeast α-glucosidase against inactivation by TNPDFG (1.6 mM) was monitored by measuring rates of inactivation in the absence and presence of 1-deoxynojirimycin (45 μM). Protection of α-amylase against inactivation by TNPDFM (5.6 mM) was investigated with acarbose (64 μM). A test that inactivation was truly a consequence of reaction with the difluoroglycoside and not with a low level contaminant was carried out. This involved reacting a large amount of enzyme (50 μM) with the inactivator (0.9 mM) until completion of reaction, then removing the inactivated enzyme by centrifugal dialysis and re-testing the resultant inactivation mixture as an inactivator of a fresh batch of enzyme. Essentially identical inactivation rates were seen, showing that the inactivation could not have been due to a contaminant as this would have had to be present as more than 5% of the sample (this is the ratio of enzyme/inhibitor in the first reaction). Such levels of contamination would have been detected by the analytical techniques used. The inactivated enzyme was placed in an Amicon Centricon 30,000-Da molecular mass cutoff centrifugal membrane to remove excess inactivator, diluted into the appropriate buffer, and the concentration of enzyme determined spectrophotometrically. Aliquots of the reactivation mixture (incubated in the absence and presence of 50 mM maltose) were removed over a period of time and assayed. To TNPDFM (10 μl, 0.98 mM) in 20 mM sodium phosphate, 25 mM NaCl buffer, pH 6.9, at 25°C was added α-amylase (10 μl, 5.2 mg/ml) in a microcell, and the release of trinitrophenolate monitored at 400 nm (∈ = 11.55 mM-1 cm-1). Synthesis of the required glycone portion posed no great synthetic problem since a method for the synthesis of a 2-deoxy-2,2-difluoroglucose derivative based upon the addition of fluorine to 2-fluoro-D-glucal had been published (McCarter et al., 1993). However, the incorporation of an aglycone of greater leaving group ability than fluoride or dinitrophenolate necessitated more careful synthetic considerations. The most attractive candidate as a leaving group was chloride. However, repeated attempts to synthesize this derivative via displacement chemistry were unsuccessful, with no reaction occurring. This is likely the consequence of the very effect sought, the resistance of 2,2-difluoroglycosides toward nucleophilic displacements. An alternative strategy for the installation of a good leaving group was therefore followed, which did not require the displacement reaction. This involved reaction of the protected hemiacetal of the 2-deoxy-2,2-difluoro sugar with fluoro-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene, to yield the trinitrophenyl glycoside. Using this approach TNPDFG (1) and TNPDFM (2) were synthesized as shown in Fig. Z1. Treatment of 3,4,6-tri-O-acetyl 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-D-glucopyranosyl bromide (McCarter et al., 1993) with triethylamine in acetonitrile at reflux for 20 h yielded 2-fluoro-D-glucal, which was fluorinated with acetyl hypofluorite to give 1,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl 2-deoxy-2,2-difluoro-D-glucopyranose. Selective anomeric deprotection with hydrazine acetate in dimethyl formamide at 50°C yielded the free hemiacetal after 3 days. This was reacted with fluoro-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene in dichloromethane containing a hindered base (2, 6-di-tert-butylpyridine) for 10 days at room temperature in the dark to give the protected glycoside. De-O-acetylation with hydrogen chloride in methanol yielded the desired product 1 after chromatographic work-up. An equivalent approach was used for the synthesis of the maltose derivative 2, starting with maltal hexa-O-acetate. Both compounds provided the expected elemental and spectroscopic analyses. Incubation of both yeast α-glucosidase with TNPDFG and human pancreatic α-amylase (α-amylase) with TNPDFM resulted in time-dependent inactivation, as shown for α-amylase in Fig. 1a. Inactivation followed pseudo-first order kinetic behavior for at least two half-lives. However some deviation was observed at longer incubation times, which was shown to be due to the spontaneous decomposition of the inhibitor in the incubation mixtures (see below). Inactivation data were analyzed according to the kinetic scheme shown below (Reaction 1). Species E, TNP, and DFM represent, respectively, enzyme, 2,4,6-trinitrophenol and 2-deoxy-2,2-difluoro-D-maltose or 2-deoxy-2,2-difluoro-D-glucose. A reciprocal replot of the pseudo-first order rate constants (kobs) at each inhibitor concentration, taken from slopes of the lines in Fig. 1a versus inhibitor concentration, is shown in Fig. 1b. The slope of this plot yielded a value of ki/Ki = 0.0073 min-1 mM-1 for reaction of human pancreatic α-amylase. Individual values of ki and Ki could not be reliably determined because the solubility of the inhibitor (maximum concentration achieved = 11 mM) precluded measurements at concentrations anywhere near the estimated Ki value (based upon Fig. 1b) of 90 mM. The active site-directed nature of the inhibition was tested by measuring the rate of inactivation at a fixed concentration of TNPDFM (5.6 mM) both in the absence and presence of the known competitive inhibitor acarbose. As is shown in Fig. 1c, the rate of inactivation was decreased from 0.044 min-1 to 0.008 min-1 by the addition of acarbose, indicating that inactivation is a consequence of modification of the active site. In a second control (not shown) TNP (picric acid) was shown not to result in inactivation of the enzyme, thereby removing any concerns that the true inactivator was the released product. In order to demonstrate the stoichiometry of inactivation, the reaction of α-amylase, with the inactivator was studied by monitoring the release of TNP. α-Amylase (10 μl, 52 μg) in buffer was added to a solution of TNPDFM (10 μl, 0.98 mM) in the same buffer, placed quickly into a microcell in a spectrophotometer, and the absorbance at 400 nm monitored. The biphasic time course shown in Fig. 2 was obtained. The first, fast phase corresponds to the release of TNP upon inactivation of the enzyme, and the second, slower phase to the breakdown of the substrate. TNP was released at an equivalent, slow rate from a second mixture to which was added buffer but no enzyme. Back extrapolation of the essentially linear steady state phase and of the initial burst phase to time zero revealed that 26 μM TNP was released in the initial burst phase. This corresponds well to the concentration of α-amylase in the cell (23 μM), indicating a stoichiometry of one TNP released per enzyme molecule. A repeat of this experiment with twice the amount of enzyme resulted, as required, in a burst of twice the magnitude (data not shown). These data therefore show that inactivation of α-amylase is a consequence of the formation of a stable difluoroglycosyl-enzyme intermediate at the active site of the enzyme. Similar data were also acquired with yeast α-glucosidase inactivated by TNPDFG, and kinetic parameters for this process along with other data are shown in Table 1. In this case again, a competitive inhibitor, 1-deoxynojirimycin (45 μM, Ki = 12.6 μM), was shown to protect the enzyme against inactivation, reducing the rate of inactivation in the presence of 1.6 mM TNPDFG from 0.13 min-1 to 0.073 min-1.TABLE I Open table in a new tab It is of interest to compare the rate reductions consequent upon introduction of the fluorine substituents at C-2 in the two cases. As can be seen in Table 1, introduction of the first fluorine at C-2 reduces the glycosylation rate (from kcat/Km values) some 2500-fold for α-amylase but only 80-fold for the α-glucosidase. Comparison of parameters for the trinitrophenyl difluoroglycosides with those for the 2-fluoroglycosyl fluorides reveals a 330-fold reduction for α-amylase and again an 80-fold reduction for the α-glucosidase. This reveals a much greater sensitivity of the α-amylase-catalyzed reaction to the introduction of fluorine substituents than that for α-glucosidase, indicating either a greater degree of oxocarbenium ion character at the transition state for α-amylase, or more important interactions with the 2-hydroxyl. These massive reductions in glycosylation rate constants consequent upon the introduction of two fluorines (almost 106-fold for α-amylase) were also reflected in reduced deglycosylation rate constants. No reactivation of either inactivated enzyme was seen when a sample of the inactivated enzyme was dialyzed to remove excess inactivator, then incubated for up to 30 days and aliquots removed for assay. In summary, a new class of mechanism-based inactivator of human pancreatic α-amylase and of yeast α-glucosidase has been synthesized and shown to function via the stoichiometric trapping of a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. In addition to providing powerful evidence of the commonality of mechanisms of β- and α-glycosidases, such inhibitors should prove useful in identifying the active site nucleophiles of these and other glycosidases, and compounds of this class may well prove valuable as therapeutic agents.

https://openalex.org/W1988861131,"β-Amyloid (βA) is a normal metabolic product of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) that accumulates in senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease. Cells that express the Swedish mutant APP (Sw-APP) associated with early onset Alzheimer's disease overproduce βA. In this report, we show that expression of Sw-APP gives rise to cell-associated βA, which is not detected in cells that express wild-type APP. Cell-associated βA is rapidly generated, is trypsin-resistant, and is not derived from βA uptake, indicating that it is generated from intracellular processing of Sw-APP. Intracellular and secreted βA are produced with different kinetics. The generation of intracellular βA is partially resistant to monensin and a 20°C temperature block but is completely inhibited by brefeldin A, suggesting that it occurs in the Golgi complex. Monensin, brefeldin A, and a 20°C temperature block almost completely inhibit βA secretion without causing increased cellular retention of βA, suggesting that secreted βA is generated in a post-Golgi compartment. These results suggest that the metabolism of Sw-APP gives rise to intracellular and secreted forms of βA through distinct processing pathways. Pathological conditions may therefore alter both the level and sites of accumulation of βA. It remains to be determined whether the intracellular form of βA plays a role in the formation of amyloid plaques. β-Amyloid (βA) is a normal metabolic product of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) that accumulates in senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease.

Cell-associated βA is rapidly generated, is trypsin-resistant, and is not derived from βA uptake, indicating that it is generated from intracellular processing of Sw-APP. Intracellular and secreted βA are produced with different kinetics. The generation of intracellular βA is partially resistant to monensin and a 20°C temperature block but is completely inhibited by brefeldin A, suggesting that it occurs in the Golgi complex. Monensin, brefeldin A, and a 20°C temperature block almost completely inhibit βA secretion without causing increased cellular retention of βA, suggesting that secreted βA is generated in a post-Golgi compartment. These results suggest that the metabolism of Sw-APP gives rise to intracellular and secreted forms of βA through distinct processing pathways. Pathological conditions may therefore alter both the level and sites of accumulation of βA. It remains to be determined whether the intracellular form of βA plays a role in the formation of amyloid plaques."

In this report, we characterized wild-type hamster BiP isolated from bacteria in terms of its ATP binding and ATPase activities. Recombinant BiP behaved essentially the same as endogenous BiP in terms of oligomeric status, protease digestion patterns, and ATPase properties. By engineering a Factor Xa cleavable site following the His tag which was used for affinity purification, we demonstrated that the six histidines had no effect on either the structural or ATPase properties of recombinant BiP. We also found that bacteria-synthesized BiP had a tightly bound ADP that was resistant to dialysis. Removal of the bound nucleotide allowed us to directly measure the binding affinity of ATP and ADP to BiP (Kd of 0.2 μM for ATP and 0.29 μM for ADP) by equilibrium dialysis. Careful characterization of wild-type BiP will allow us to use this system to characterize BiP ATP binding site mutants that can be used to probe the role of ATP binding and ATPase activity in BiP functions.

Spherical beads were coated with varying densities of anti-rabbit immunoglobulin monoclonal antibodies and driven along glass surfaces derivatized with rabbit anti-dinitrophenol. Particle motion was analyzed. The velocity, attachment frequency, and duration of binding events were determined on individual particles. It was found that i) beads exhibited frequent arrests lasting between a few tenths of a second and more than one minute; ii) when antibodies were diluted, the median arrest duration remained fairly constant (≈1 s) whereas binding frequency varied as the first power of the antibody concentration, suggesting that most particle arrests were due to the formation of a single bond; iii) when the shear rate was increased 7-fold, the duration of transient binding events remained constant. The disruptive force exerted on attachment points was estimated to range between about 6 and 37 piconewtons; and iv) the distribution of arrest durations suggested that binding was not a monophasic reaction but involved at least one intermediate step. Therefore, transient binding events reflected the formation of unstable associations that are not detected with standard techniques.

Therefore, transient binding events reflected the formation of unstable associations that are not detected with standard techniques. An obvious requirement for a molecular understanding of cell adhesion would be to obtain a precise knowledge of the rates of bond formation and dissociation between membrane-associated receptors and ligands. Indeed, it was recently emphasized that the outcome of an intercellular contact might be more dependent on the kinetics than the affinity of interaction between ligands and receptors(1Williams A.F. Nature. 1991; 352: 473-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 2Van der Merwe A. Barclay N. Trends Biochem.

Thus, the capacity of adhesion molecules such as selectins to allow the rolling of leukocytes along endothelial cells in flowing blood was suggested to rely on a particularly high value of kinetic constants(3Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6414) Google Scholar). Also, when a first bond occurred between a cell and another cell or surface, a critical parameter of adhesion is the ratio between the rates of dissociation of the first bond and formation of additional interactions(4Pierres A. Tissot O. Malissen B. Bongrand P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, no previously reported methodology allowed a direct measurement of the lifetime of interactions between particle-bound molecules(5Bongrand P. Claesson P. Curtis A. Studying Cell Adhesion. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1994Crossref Google Scholar). Tha et al.(6Tha S.P. Shuster J. Goldsmith H.L. Biophys. J. 1986; 50: 1117-1126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) used a travelling microtube to study the time and force dependence of rupture of antibody-mediated erythrocyte doublets. However, they did not study very transient attachments. Wattenbarger et al.(7Wattenbarger M.R. Graves D.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 765-777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) studied the adhesion of glycophorin-containing liposomes to a lectin-coated surface in shear flow. Although they studied the motion of individual particles, they did not present quantitative data on short-term arrests. Other experiments done with the parallel plate flow chamber yielded direct information on binding efficiency and binding strength rather than binding kinetics(8Cozens-Roberts C. Lauffenburger D.A. Quinn J.A. Biophys. J. 1990; 58: 841-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 9Tempelman L.A. Hammer D.A. Biophys.

J. 1991; 59: 838-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) performed micromanipulation to determine the mechanical resistance of molecular point attachments between erythrocytes. However, the contact time preceding separation was kept constant, which prevented the authors from obtaining any information on the natural lifetime of labile bonds. Recently, several authors used atomic force microscopy to study the interaction between individual surface-bound molecules(11Florin E.L. Moy V.T. Gaub H.E. Science. 1994; 264: 415-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (1745) Google Scholar, 12Dammer U. Popescu O. Wagner P. Anselmetti D. Güntherodt H.-J. Misevic G.N. Science. 1995; 267: 1173-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). They reported information on binding strength rather than kinetics. This emphasizes the importance of the theoretical framework elaborated by Bell (13Bell G.I. Science. 1978; 200: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3449) Google Scholar) to relate the behavior of surface-bound molecules to well known kinetic and thermodynamic constants of association between soluble receptors and ligands (see also (14Lauffenburger D.A. Lindenman J.J. Receptors: Models for Binding, Trafficking and Signalling. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993Google Scholar) for additional information). The basic idea was to represent the interaction between molecules A and B as a two-step process. The first step is a purely diffusive encounter between molecules A and B, which approach into sufficiently close proximity to allow bond formation. Kinetic parameters can be estimated with standard diffusion theory. The second step, i.e. molecular association, is assumed to be described with the same constants when molecules A and B are free or bound to surfaces. The numerical values of these parameters may thus be derived from experimental data obtained on soluble forms of receptors and ligands. The limitation of this approach is that i) the reaction is assumed to be monophasic; ii) accurate information is required on the mobility of reacting molecules; iii) drastic assumptions are required to account for the dependence of bond formation on the distance between interacting surfaces; and iv) Bell's theory could only be checked through theoretical models involving adjustable parameters(15Hammer D.A. Lauffenburger D.A. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 475-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 16Kuo S.C. Lauffenburger D.A. Biophys.

It was therefore felt useful to develop an experimental methodology allowing direct measurement of the lifetime of individual ligand-receptor bonds involving surface-bound molecules. The basic idea was to study the motion of receptor-bearing cells or particles along ligand-coated surfaces under laminar shear flow. The hydrodynamic force was less than the reported value of the mechanical resistance of associations between biological molecules (i.e. several tens of piconewtons(5Bongrand P. Claesson P. Curtis A. Studying Cell Adhesion. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1994Crossref Google Scholar, 10Evans E. Berk D. Leung A. Biophys.

Popescu O. Wagner P. Anselmetti D. Güntherodt H.-J. Misevic G.N. Science. 1995; 267: 1173-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar)). This approach was applied to human neutrophils interacting with endothelial cell monolayers (17Kaplanski G. Farnarier C. Tissot O. Pierres A. Benoliel A.M. Alessi M.C. Kaplanski S. Bongrand P. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 1922-1933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and murine lymphoma cells moving along antibody-coated surfaces(4Pierres A. Tissot O. Malissen B. Bongrand P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The wall shear rate was a few seconds−1, corresponding to an hydrodynamic drag of a few piconewtons. It was indeed possible to detect transient cell arrests that were probably due to the formation and dissociation of a low number of molecular bonds. However, two problems were raised by this approach. First, it was difficult to define cell arrests with high accuracy due to spontaneous velocity fluctuations and low velocity. Second, it was difficult to prove that observed arrests were due to single molecular bonds. The purpose of the present work was to overcome these difficulties with a better suited model. Particles were small spherical beads (2.8 μm diameter). This improved the accuracy of determination of arrest duration because the motion of spheres was more regular than that of actual cells, and, since the hydrodynamic drag is proportional to the square of particle radius, whereas the velocity is proportional to the first power of this radius(18Goldman A.J. Cox R.G. Brenner H. Chem. Eng. Sci. 1967; 22: 653-660Crossref Scopus (1018) Google Scholar), it was possible to achieve higher particle velocity without increasing the hydrodynamic force, thus improving the accuracy of time determinations(4Pierres A. Tissot O. Malissen B. Bongrand P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Spheres were coated with varying amounts of anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibodies, and they moved along surfaces derivatized with rabbit immunoglobulin. Because molecules were not expected to exhibit free lateral diffusion on the sphere surface, the occurrence of multiple cell-substrate molecular bonds became more and more unlikely when dilution was increased. Analysis of experimental data strongly suggests that bond formation was not monophasic and that our method allowed to detect incomplete binding states that were not apparent with standard approaches. Particles were spheres of 2.8-μm diameter and 1.3 g/liter density (Dynabeads M280, Dynal, supplied by Biosys, Compiègne, France). These spheres were coated with streptavidin, a high affinity ligand for biotin. Before each experiment, 50-μl aliquots of bead suspension (∼7 × 108/ml) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with an equal volume of a mixture of biotinylated mouse monoclonal antibodies at a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. These antibodies were an IgG2a specific for the Fc fragment of rabbit IgG (clone IgL 173, Immunotech, Marseille, France) and an IgG2a specific for CD14 antigen (clone UCHM1, Sigma) that was used as a control with irrelevant specificity to dilute anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibodies. Beads were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) supplemented with 2 mg/ml bovine albumin in order to prevent nonspecific adhesion, and they were used at 107/ml in the same solution throughout all subsequent adhesion experiments. Glass coverslips were coated with rabbit immunoglobulins with a modification of a method described by Michl et al.(19Michl J. Pieczonka M.M. Unkeless J.C. Silverstein S.C. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 150: 607-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) as described previously(4Pierres A. Tissot O. Malissen B. Bongrand P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20Pierres A. Benoliel A.M. Bongrand P. Mow V.C. Guilak F. Tran-Son-Tay R. Hochmuth R.M. Cell Mechanics and Cellular Engineering. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1994: 145-159Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, they were washed with sulfuric acid, then rinsed in distilled water, and air-dried, and they were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 1 mg/ml polylysine (Sigma, molecular weight > 300,000) and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. They were then incubated another 30 min in the dark with 16.8 mg/ml 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) in pH 11.6 carbonate buffer. Finally, they were treated with 1.2 mg/ml rabbit anti-dinitrophenol antibodies (Sigma) and washed in phosphate buffer containing 2 mg/ml bovine albumin before use. We used a previously described apparatus(4Pierres A. Tissot O. Malissen B. Bongrand P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Tissot O. Pierres A. Foa C. Delaage M. Bongrand P. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 204-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, a rectangular cavity of 17 × 6 × 0.2 mm3 was cut into a Plexiglas block. The bottom was a glass coverslip (22 × 10 mm2) that was coated with immunoglobulins as described above. The flow was obtained with a plastic syringe mounted on an electric syringe holder. The chamber was set on the stage of an inverted microscope (Olympus IM) bearing a 100× lens. The microscope was equipped with a SIT video camera (Model 4015, Lhesa, Cergy Pontoise, France), and all experiments were recorded with a Mitsubishi HS3398 tape recorder for delayed analysis. All individual beads that were in apparent contact with the chamber floor were studied. In most cases, the duration of individual arrests was determined manually, using a computer-driven time counter. The accuracy of time determinations was estimated to be about 0.2 s. Further analysis was performed as described previously(4Pierres A. Tissot O. Malissen B. Bongrand P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Tissot O. Pierres A. Foa C. Delaage M. Bongrand P. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 204-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, the video signal was processed with a real time digitizer (PCVision+, Imaging Technology, Bedford, MA). Pixel size was 0.17 μm. A cursor driven by the computer mouse was superimposed on the microscope image. Small (32 × 32 pixel) images pointed with the cursor in order to surround the analyzed bead were continuously transferred to the computer memory for delayed determination of the cell position. In this case, the resolution was limited by the accuracy of position determinations, because a particle might move by less than half a micrometer during a 0.08-s interval. The distance between flowing beads and the chamber floor was estimated with theoretical data provided by Goldman et al.(18Goldman A.J. Cox R.G. Brenner H. Chem. Eng. Sci. 1967; 22: 653-660Crossref Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). The numerical results displayed in Table 2 of this paper were used to plot cosh−1(z/a) versus U/aG, where a is the sphere radius, G is the wall shear rate, z is the distance between the sphere center and the substrate, and U is the sphere translational velocity. This yielded a smooth plot allowing fairly accurate regression with a second order polynoma (when U/aG ranged between about 0.4 and 1.2), leading to the following formula: z/a=cosh(-0.1130(U/aG)2+1.1688(U/aG)-0.4308)(Eq. 1) Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab A binding efficiency parameter b was defined as described previously (22Mège J.L. Capo C. André P. Benoliel A.M. Bongrand P. Biorheology. 1990; 27: 433-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by writing as b•dx the probability that a particle rolling along the chamber floor exhibited an arrest during an elementary displacement of length dx. The probability P that a particle displayed at least one arrest during its passage across the microscope field of width w (i.e. 86 μm under our conditions) was therefore: P=1-exp(-bw)(Eq. 2) The numerical values of the duration of typically 100 arrests observed under given experimental conditions were ordered in order to build a numerical plot of the variations of the number of particles remaining bound after a period of time t following an initial arrest versus time. It was reasoned that a quantitative interpretation of experimental data was not possible at high binding site density, because the rate of formation of sequential bonds was probably dependent on the relative localization of binding sites in contact areas (in absence of lateral diffusion). Therefore, we only considered the low density limit. We assumed that bond formation between molecules A and B was a two-state process: A+B→←kd(AB)1→←k-k+(AB)2(Eq. 3) The probability P(t) for a particle bound in state (AB)1 at time 0 to remain bound at time t was derived as described in the “Appendix.” An analytical formula allowed exact determination of P(t) when parameters kd, k+, and k− were varied. Theoretical curves were fitted to experimental data with χ2 test(23Snedecor G.W. Cochran W.G. Statistical Methods. Iowa State University Press, Ames, IA1980Google Scholar). Arrest durations were grouped in seven classes: 0-0.3 s, 0.3-0.6 s, 0.6-1.2 s, 1.2-2.4 s, 2.4-5 s, 5-60 s, and 60 s to ∞. Parameters kd, k+, and k− were systematically varied with a step of 0.1 in order to determine the values yielding minimal χ2. This procedure was repeated with a step of 0.01 or 0.001 to refine the minimization. Note that the threshold χ2 for a 0.05 significance level is 12.9 when the number of degrees of freedom is 6. Dynabeads were coated with biotinylated anti-rabbit immunoglobulins and deposited on rabbit immunoglobulin-derivatized glass coverslips in a custom-made flow chamber. They were examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) connected to a desk computer bearing a PCVision+ digitizer as described elsewhere(24Zaffran Y. Lépidi H. Benoliel A.M. Capo C. Bongrand P. Blood Cells. 1993; 19: 115-131PubMed Google Scholar). First, the intrinsic fluorescence of a typical sample of 20-25 particles was determined. Fluorescein-labeled rabbit immunoglobulins (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs., Inc., West Grove, PA) were then added, and another set of fluorescence determinations was performed after 30 min of incubation. Finally, the chamber was washed, and fluorescence was determined 5 min later. First, immunoglobulin-coated surfaces were treated with an excess of fluorescent anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibodies, and the amount of bound fluorescence/unit area was determined. Second, the fluorescence of calibrated fluorescence beads was measured under similar conditions. The surface density of fluorescent antibodies was 6.2 × 103 molecules/μm2. The confocal microscope was used with the same settings to measure i) the fluorescence of dynabeads coated with pure anti-rabbit immunoglobulin monoclonal and then an excess of fluorescent rabbit immunoglobulins and ii) the fluorescence of a 100 μg/ml solution of the same fluorescent rabbit immunoglobulins maintained as a thin layer by depositing a 12 × 12-mm2 coverslip on a 5-μl droplet of this solution(25André P. Benoliel A.M. Capo C. Foa C. Buferne M. Boyer C. Schmitt-Verhulst A.M. Bongrand P. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 200: 618-627Google Scholar). It was found that each bead could bind about 85,450 rabbit immunoglobulin molecules (i.e. about 3,460 molecules/μm2. Spherical beads exposed to a shear flow exhibited a very steady motion. As shown in Fig. 1, beads that were apparently in the same plane as surface-bound particles exhibited marked velocity differences, with variations ranging within a factor of two. A typical velocity distribution of spheres seemingly located in the same focus plane is shown in Fig. 2; in the presence of a wall shear rate of 11 s−1, the translation velocities ranged between about 7 and 14 μm/s. The corresponding sphere-to-substrate distance, as evaluated with Goldman's theory(18Goldman A.J. Cox R.G. Brenner H. Chem. Eng. Sci. 1967; 22: 653-660Crossref Scopus (1018) Google Scholar), ranged between 4.2 and 207 nm. Because the significance of Goldman's theory is not fully demonstrated at this distance(21Tissot O. Pierres A. Foa C. Delaage M. Bongrand P. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 204-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we arbitrarily assumed that the particles were within binding distance from the substratum when the ratio U/aG between the velocity and the particle radius times the shear rate was lower than 0.8, corresponding to a gap width of 10% of the sphere radius. This assumption was somewhat supported by the observation that binding events could occur with all spheres falling within this velocity range.Figure 2Typical velocity distribution. The velocity distribution of a sample of 73 beads coated with irrelevant (anti-CD14) antibodies and subjected to a wall shear rate of 11 s−1 is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A major problem with our experimental approach is that ill-defined “nonspecific” interactions may be responsible for a significant proportion of particle arrests. It was important to assess the importance of these interactions in the present system. As shown on Table 1, when the specific antibody dilution and shear rate were varied within a wide range of numerical values, more than 90% of beads exhibited at least one arrest when specific antibody were diluted between 1/1 and 1/1,000, whereas only about 10% of these particles displayed at least one stop in the absence of specific antibody interaction. This point was made more quantitative by pooling results obtained with different values of the wall shear rate and calculating the binding efficiency parameter (i.e. mean number of arrests/μm displacement). This parameter was 0.0335, 0.0404, 0.0256, 0.0231, and 0.0013 μm−1 when the proportion of specific antibodies on spherical beads was 1, 1/10, 1/100, 1/1000, and 0, respectively. The binding probability was therefore between 17- and 30-fold higher in presence of specific antibody than when beads were coated with irrelevant antibodies. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that specific bonds were responsible for most initial arrests.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Beads were coated with different proportions of specific antibodies (between 1/1 and 1/1,000) and subjected to different flow rates for determination of the duration of transient arrests. Plots of the fraction of beads remaining bound at time t after arrest versus time are shown on Fig. 3. A total number of 1381 arrests (i.e. about 100 arrests/plot) were observed. The initial rate of bead detachment was approximated as the slope of regression lines determined with arrests lasting 1 s or less. The correlation coefficient ranged between 0.813 and 0.992 (mean 0.947). Although experimental curves sometimes displayed significant curvature over this interval, it seemed difficult to consider a shorter period of time because the number of points might be too low and the accuracy of time determinations was too low to warrant such attempts. Results are shown in Table 2. Two main conclusions were suggested: i) the rate of particle detachment was not markedly dependent on the shear rate within the studied range, and ii) the detachment rate was similar with the lowest two antibody concentrations used. An attractive interpretation of these findings would be that arrests observed with 1/100 or 1/1,000 antibody dilutions involved isolated molecular bonds and that the duration of these bonds was not affected by shear forces within the studied range, which provided a minimal value of bond strength. The consistency of this hypothesis with experimental data was thus subjected to a quantitative test. In order to achieve a quantitative interpretation of experimental data, χ2 analysis was performed to compare theoretical and experimental distributions of arrest durations. In a first series of calculations (not shown), it was checked that experimental data displayed on Fig. 3 could not be accounted for by a one-parameter theory involving a monophasic bonding reaction, with an adjustable off-rate. Indeed, in this case, the experimental curves should be straight lines at high antibody dilution. A three-parameter model involving an intermediate binding state was then considered (“Appendix”). It was found possible to obtain experimental curves fairly similar to experimental data. A typical fit is shown on Fig. 4. The numerical values of fitted parameters are shown on Table 3 as well as minimal χ2 values. Interestingly, no substantial difference was found between parameters obtained with beads coated with 1/100 and 1/1000 specific antibodies, in accordance with the hypothesis that we were dealing with single molecular bonds. Further, when the hydrodynamic force was varied on a sevenfold range, no substantial change of these kinetic parameters was found, in accordance with the hypothesis that these forces were well below the threshold required to break ligand-receptor bonds.Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab However, this agreement between theoretical and experimental data does not formally prove that we were dealing with single molecular bonds. Indeed, similar results could be obtained if a fixed minimal number of bonds were required to mediate cell arrest. Therefore, limiting dilution analysis was performed to address this point. The binding efficiency parameter was determined on beads coated with specific anti-rabbit immunoglobulin diluted at 1/1000, 1/2500, 1/5000, 1/7500, and 1/10000. This parameter was plotted versus antibody concentration with a double logarithmic scale (Fig. 5). The slope of the regression line was 1.08 (correlation coefficient, 0.94), thus suggesting that arrest frequency was indeed proportional to the first power of binding site density, which supported the single bond hypothesis. Particle-substrate separation might be due to a rupture of either link of the molecular chain mediating attachment. It was of obvious importance to determine the rate of bond dissociation with free ligands. First, glass surfaces were coated with rabbit immunoglobulins as described, and the surface density of these molecules was determined with indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. No substantial release was detected during the first 3 h following preparation (not shown). Secondly, particles were labeled on the stage of a confocal microscope. In a representative experiment, the mean fluorescence of unlabeled particles was 140 ± 9.6 (57 particles). When labeling solution was added, the fluorescence rose to 1446 ± 138 (n = 15) after a 30-min incubation on the microscope stage. Finally, when beads were washed with fresh medium, the fluorescence was not significantly changed 5 min later (1531 ± 78, n = 24). It is concluded that no significant loss of fluorescence occurred during the first 5 min following the removal of labeling molecules. Thus, bead detachment was at least one 100-fold more rapid than that of isolated molecules. Further, the aforementioned results did not support the hypothesis that shear forces might be responsible for this rapid separation. The main purpose of this work was to achieve a direct determination of the lifetime of ligand-receptor bonds involving particle-bound molecules. Recently, several authors reported quantitative data on the efficiency of adhesion between receptor-bearing cells and ligand-coated surfaces in flow chamber. When human granulocytes(17Kaplanski G.

J. 1994; 66: 1231-1243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) or murine lymphoid clones (4Pierres A. Tissot O. Malissen B. Bongrand P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) were studied, an inverse relationship was found between cell velocity and binding probability per μm displacement. However, in the present study adhesion efficiency was fairly independent of the particle velocity (Table 1). We suggest that the explanation for this difference is that in cellular systems receptor-ligand interaction is mainly diffusion-driven. If the limiting parameter is the time required for cell adhesion molecules to pass through the cell-surface contact area (which may be the tip of a microvillus), the adhesion probability will be proportional to the contact time, thus making the adhesion probability per unit length of cell displacement along the surface inversely proportional to the cell velocity. However, lateral diffusion of antibody molecules is not expected on the surface of the beads used in the present study. Therefore, ligand-receptor interaction may be dependent on particle displacement, making the adhesion probability proportional to the bead displacement rather than the contact time, as found in the present study. For this reason, the bead model cannot represent actual cell behavior. However, this absence of diffusion may provide an unique opportunity to study single molecular bonds without a need for excessive receptor dilution, which would make binding events too rare to be subjected to a quantitative study. As shown on Table 1, even when specific antibodies were diluted 1/1000 with irrelevant antibodies, beads displayed much more frequent arrests than when they were coated with 100% irrelevant antibodies. Therefore, even with 1/1000 antibody concentration, most arrests were mediated by specific bonds. Two arguments support the view that these arrests were mainly due to the formation of a single bond. First, when specific antibodies were diluted 1/1000, the site density was about 3.5 sites/μm2. The contact area between the bead and the surface may be defined as the area where the distance between surfaces is less than the sum L of the lengths of a rabbit immunoglobulin (on the chamber floor) and a mouse immunoglobulin (on the bead). From elementary geometrical formula, this area is 2πaL, where a is the sphere radius. Because L is about 0.02 μm (corresponding to four times the length of a Fc or Fab fragment of an immunoglobulin molecule(26Valentine R.C. Green N.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 27: 615-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar)) and a is 1.4 μm, the contact area is about 0.17 μm2. If there is on average less than one mouse anti-rabbit Ig molecule in this region, it is quite unlikely that there would be two molecules simultaneously interacting with an antigen site on the surface. Second, if n bonds were required to mediate a detectable arrest, the arrest probability would vary as the nth power of specific antibody concentration under conditions of limiting dilution (see Appendix 2 of (27Capo C. Garrouste F. Benoliel A.M. Bongrand P. Ryter A. Bell G.I. J. Cell Sci. 1982; 56: 21-48PubMed Google Scholar)). As shown on Fig. 5, limiting dilution experiments support the hypothesis that arrests are mediated by a single bond, because the logarithm of arrest probability varied as the 1.08th power of the logarithm of antibody concentration. Our approach may yield at the same time precise kinetic and mechanical data. Indeed, according to Goldman, Cox, and Brenner(18Goldman A.J. Cox R.G. Brenner H. Chem. Eng. Sci. 1967; 22: 653-660Crossref Scopus (1018) Google Scholar), a sphere deposited on a plane under a laminar shear flow of shear rate G is subjected to a drag force F and torque Γ given by: F=1.7005×6πμa2G(Eq. 4) Γ=0.9440×4πμa3G(Eq. 5) where a is the sphere radius and μ is the medium viscosity. As shown on Fig. 6, the force T experienced by a single bond of length L much smaller than a is 1We are grateful to Prof. Evan Evans for pointing out the importance of the difference of the forces experienced by the sphere and the bond. The problem of determining the force on a single cell exposed to a laminar shear flow on a surface was first addressed by Schmid-Schoenbein et al.(30Schmid-Schoenbein G.W. Fung Y.C. Zweifach B.W. Circ. Res. 1975; 36: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). : T≈(F+Γ/a)(a/2L)(Eq. 6) Using 20 nm for L (see (26Valentine R.C. Green N.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 27: 615-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and above) and considering spheres of 1.4-μm radius embedded in a medium of 0.001 Pa•s viscosity, such as water at 20°C, we obtain: T=0.51Gpiconewton(Eq. 7) where G is in s−1. Thus, under our experimental conditions, the applied force (T) ranged between 5.6 and 36.7 piconewtons. It must be emphasized that this estimate is only weakly dependent on the numerical value of parameter L. The results shown on Table 2 and Table 3 suggest that the lifetime of antigen-antibody bonds we studied was not substantially reduced by this treatment. This conclusion is consistent with previous estimates of binding strength(6Tha S.P. Shuster J. Goldsmith H.L. Biophys. J. 1986; 50: 1117-1126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Evans E. Berk D. Leung A. Biophys.

Further, our experimental system may provide additional information by allowing simultaneous determination of applied force and bond dissociation rate. A first point supporting the validity of our model is that the slopes of experimental detachment curves (Table 2) were fairly similar when the specific antibody concentration was 1/100 and 1/1000. This is in accordance with the single bond hypothesis. More quantitatively, as exemplified on Fig. 4, the overall pattern of binding curves displayed on Fig. 3 could be reproduced with theoretical data based on a two-step model of molecular association involving three adjustable kinetic parameters. As shown on Table 3, there was in some cases a significant discrepancy between experimental data and the best theoretical fit. We think that this did not disprove our model, because this discrepancy might be due to the infrequent formation of multiple bonds. Indeed, the agreement between experimental and theoretical curves was on average far better with the highest dilution of specific antibodies. Further, we wish to emphasize that the existence of an intermediate step seems required to explain the difference between the lifetime of antigen-antibody bonds involving soluble and particle-bound molecules. If we assume that the hydrodynamic drag exerted on bound particles is not sufficient to substantially reduce the bond lifetime, it is difficult to understand why the interaction between flowing beads and substratum lasted only a few seconds. Indeed, the lifetime of adhesions between soluble rabbit anti-dinitrophenol antibodies and substratum may be higher than several hours, and the lifetime of interactions between mouse anti-rabbit immunoglobulin and these immunoglobulins is higher than several minutes (see “Results”). This apparent discrepancy is clearly alleviated if the arrests we detected reflected a transient binding state. Further, other studies made on noncovalent ligand-receptor interactions revealed such intermediate states (31Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1985Google Scholar, 32Huber W. Hurst J. Schlatter D. Barner R. Hübscher J. Kouns W.C. Steiner B. Eur. J.

Therefore, our three-parameter model may be considered as the simplest way of interpreting experimental data. 2Note that this finding may be dependent on our model. While this paper was being submitted, an analysis of the interaction between blood neutrophils and P-selectin-coated surfaces was reported(35Alon R. Hammer D.A. Springer T. Nature. 1995; 374: 539-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). The lifetime of P-selectin-ligand bonds was estimated at about 1 s in accordance with our estimate of about 2 s for neutrophil-E-selectin interaction(17Kaplanski G. Farnarier C. Tissot O. Pierres A. Benoliel A.M. Alessi M.C. Kaplanski S. Bongrand P. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 1922-1933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), but no transient state was detected. In conclusion, we visualized the formation and dissociation of individual ligand-receptor bonds between molecules linked to macroscopic bodies."
https://openalex.org/W2122683952,"We have previously shown that soluble partially degraded fibrin(ogen) remains in solution after fibrin clot formation and is a potent fibroblast mitogen (Gray, A. J., Bishop, J. E., Reeves, J. T., Mecham, R. P., and Laurent, G. J.(1995) Am. J. Cell Mol. Biol. 12, 684-690). Mitogenic sites within the fibrin(ogen) molecule are located on the Aα and Bβ chains of the protein (Gray, A. J., Bishop, J. E., Reeves, J. T., and Laurent, G. J.(1993) J. Cell Sci. 104, 409-413). However, receptor pathways [Abstract] through which mitogenic effects are mediated are unknown. The present study sought to determine the nature of fibrin (ogen) receptors expressed on human fibroblasts which interact with the fibrinogen Bβ chain. Receptor complexes were isolated from 125I-surface-labeled fibroblasts and purified on a fibrinogen Bβ chain affinity column. Subsequent high performance liquid chromatography and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis indicated fibrinogen Bβ chain bound specifically to a 60-kDa surface protein. Sequence analysis of the amino terminus of this protein indicated 100% homology to human calreticulin. Immunoprecipitation experiments employing a polyclonal anti-calreticulin antibody provided further evidence that the 60-kDa protein isolated in this study was calreticulin. Further, polyclonal antibodies to human calreticulin significantly inhibited the mitogenic activity of fibrinogen Bβ chain on human fibroblasts.

The present study has shown that cell surface calreticulin binds to the Bβ chain of fibrinogen mediating its mitogenic activity. Blood coagulation at the site of tissue injury is a process central to wound healing. The deposition of an insoluble fibrin matrix provides both a hemostatic plug preventing leakage of plasma components and a matrix over which cells can spread and proliferate(3Brown L.F. Dvorak A. Dvorak H.F. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1989; 140: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the action of thrombin on fibrinogen (in addition to the formation of insoluble fibrin) generates soluble partially degraded forms of fibrin(ogen) which are potent fibroblast mitogens (1Gray A.J. Bishop J.E. Reeves J.T. Mecham R.P. Laurent G.J. Am. J. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 12: 684-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 4Gray A.J. Reeves J.T. Harrison N.K. Winlove P. Laurent G.J. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 96: 271-274PubMed Google Scholar) and may further facilitate wound healing. Mitogenic sites within the fibrinogen molecule have been investigated, and we have shown both the Aα and Bβ chains of fibrinogen are mitogens for human fibroblasts (2Gray A.J. Bishop J.E. Reeves J.T. Laurent G.J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 409-413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cell surface components responsible for binding Aα and Bβ chains of fibrinogen are unknown. The present study sought to determine the nature of fibroblast receptor(s) involved in binding and subsequently mediating the mitogenic action of partially degraded fibrin(ogen). Our approach utilized human fetal fibroblasts which were surface-labeled with 125I. Membrane proteins were extracted with a mild neutral detergent, and plasma membrane components were purified on a fibrinogen Bβ chain affinity column. Protein moieties eluted from the column were further purified by HPLC and visualized by SDS-PAGE. A 60-kDa surface protein which binds specifically to the Bβ chain of fibrinogen was identified. Sequence analysis of the first 13 amino acids of this protein showed 100% homology with human calreticulin. Further, polyclonal antibodies to human calreticulin significantly inhibited the mitogenic activity of the fibrinogen Bβ chain on human fetal fibroblasts. Fibroblast replication was assessed using a dye binding assay based on the uptake and subsequent release of methylene blue as described previously by Oliver et al.(5Oliver M.H. Harrison N.K. Bishop J.E. Cole P.J. Laurent G.J. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 92: 513-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human fetal lung fibroblasts (HFL-1) were plated at 5 × 103 cells/well in 50 μl of serum-free DMEM in 96-well plates, either 24 h before the test solutions were added or concurrently with test solutions. A 50-μl sample of test solution in serum-free medium was serially diluted across the plate; 50 μl of serum-free medium was added to 3 columns representing media controls. Plates were incubated for 48 h at 37°C in 10% CO2 and 100% humidity. Each assay was validated as a means of determining cell replication by direct cell counting. Counts were performed on cells stained with methylene blue prior to elution of the dye. Human fetal fibroblasts (HFL-1 and IMR-90, American Tissue Type Culture Collection) were grown to confluence in roller bottles over a period of 14 to 20 days. Serum-containing cell culture media were removed, and each bottle was rinsed 5 times with 10 ml of PBS containing 1 mM Ca2+ and 1 mM Mg2+. After discarding the last rinse, an additional 5 ml of PBS containing protease inhibitors was added to the cells. Cells were scraped from the bottles with a cell scraper and spun for 10 min at 100 × g. The cell pellet was reconstituted in 1 ml of PBS + protease inhibitors and placed on ice. It was important in the context of the present study to ensure that only cell surface proteins were labeled with 125I. To ensure that the cells remained intact prior to radiolabeling all washes were performed in PBS, pH 7.4. Additionally, cells were observed under a light microscope prior to radiolabeling, and cell membranes were found to be intact. Glass tubes were coated with IODOGEN, and 1 ml of cell suspension was added to each tube. 500 μCi of Na125I (ICN) was added, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 12 min with occasional mixing. Finally, cells were washed several times to remove free 125I. Plasma membrane proteins were extracted from human fibroblasts which were grown to confluence in roller bottles and harvested as described above. The same procedure was employed for both 125Ilabeled cells and unlabeled cells. Cell pellets were resuspended in the neutral detergent octyl-β-glucopyranoside + protease inhibitors (Sigma), and membrane-bound proteins were extracted overnight at 4°C. The resulting solution was spun at 20,000 × g, and the supernatant either was used immediately in the affinity chromatography assay or stored at −70°C. Cell surface proteins were biotinylated using a ImmunoPure Sulfo-NHS-Biotinylation Kit (Pierce). Affinity chromatography was performed employing purified fibrinogen Bβ chain (2Gray A.J. Bishop J.E. Reeves J.T. Laurent G.J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 409-413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) coupled through the carboxyl terminus to an Affi-Gel 102 matrix (Bio-Rad). 10 mg of purified Bβ chain was dissolved in 2 ml of 8 M urea, mixed 1:1 with Affi-Gel 102, the pH was adjusted to between 4.7 and 5.0, and the mixture was stirred gently for several minutes. 5 mg of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide coupling reagent was subsequently added, and the pH was readjusted to between 4.7 and 5.0. The reaction was allowed to proceed overnight at 4°C with continuous stirring. The resulting complex was packed into a Bio-Rad column support and washed extensively with 50 ml of octyl-β-glucopyranoside + PBS, pH 7.4. Plasma membrane extract was applied to the column, and bound proteins were eluted with a series of washes: 40 mM EDTA, 2 M KCl, and 8 M urea. Each fraction was concentrated in an Amicon Centricon-10 and dried in a Speed Vac. Protein fractions collected by affinity chromatography were further purified on a C4 reverse phase HPLC column. Dried samples were reconstituted in trifluoroacetic acid/water, and 100 μl were injected onto the top of the column. Proteins were eluted with 20-50% acetonitrile gradient. Fractions were subsequently collected from the column in 250-μl aliquots, and several column runs were performed on each protein sample resulting in a final fraction volume of between 1 and 2 ml. Each fraction was dried and counted in a γ counter. Fractions containing counts were further purified on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels. Finally, gels were dried and signal-visualized with autoradiography. Samples which were not labeled with 125I were purified in an identical manner to labeled samples with the exception that 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose and stained with Coomassie Blue. Protein sequence analysis was performed using an ABI 473A protein Sequencer. Proteins to be sequenced were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a Problot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and visualized with Coomassie Blue staining. Bands were excised, and the amino-terminal sequence was determined using an ABI model 473A protein Sequencer equipped with a model 610 data acquisition system. Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed employing a polyclonal antibody to human calreticulin (Affinity BioReagents). Protein preparations were precleared with normal rabbit sera. Supernatant was collected and incubated on ice for 1 h with a 1:100 dilution of polyclonal calreticulin antibody. 8 mg of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) was added to the antibody-antigen complex, and the mixture was incubated on ice for an additional 30 min. Protein A-Sepharose was pelleted and washed three times in lysis buffer. 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer was added to the pellet, the sample was heated at 100°C for 3 min, and the resulting supernatant was run on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel. Finally, the gel was dried and signal-visualized with autoradiography film. Human fetal fibroblasts were plated onto 8-well chamber slides (Nunc) and left for 24 h to allow cells to adhere. Polyclonal anti-calreticulin antibodies and nonimmune controls were incubated with cells at 37°C in DMEM for 20 min. Cells were subsequently fixed with 2% formal saline and signal-visualized with a fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody. Purified fibrinogen Bβ chain stimulated fibroblast replication in vitro (Fig. 1). Maximum simulation of fibroblasts by isolated fibrinogen Bβ chain was about 30% above media control at a protein concentration of 1.1 × 10-6>M. Activity returned to control levels with serial dilution. For comparison, the well characterized mitogen thrombin elicited a maximal mitogenic response of 20-30% above media control assayed under the same conditions as isolated fibrinogen Bβ chain. Fetal calf serum (5%) elicited a mitogenic response of about 100%-150% above media control. To examine the cell surface receptors which bind fibrinogen Bβ chain, fibroblasts were surface-labeled with 125I, and surface proteins were extracted and passed over a fibrinogen Bβ chain affinity column. Proteins were collected from the affinity column with a series of washes. More than 90% of bound proteins eluted with 5 ml of 40 mM EDTA. The EDTA-eluted fraction was then further purified on a C4 reverse phase HPLC column. Each fraction collected from the column was dried and counted. The bulk of 125I-labeled proteins eluted from the C4 column in a single radioactive peak at an elution gradient of 40% acetonitrile. Fig. 2A, tracks a-e, shows an autoradiograph of radiolabeled proteins contained in this fraction separated by SDS-PAGE. The radioactive peak collected from the HPLC column contained predominantly a single protein moiety with an apparent molecular mass of about 60 kDa. To identify the nature of the 60-kDa protein, a large scale preparation of unlabeled plasma membrane proteins was prepared using the affinity procedure described above. Purification of the 60-kDa protein was confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining of the isolated protein transferred to Problot (Fig. 2B, track a). The stained 60-kDa band was cut out and sequenced using a ABI protein Sequencer. Sequence analysis of the 60-kDa protein indicated an amino-terminal sequence which read: EPAVYFKEQFLDG. These experiments were performed on three separate preparations, and the same sequence was recorded on each occasion. A comparison of the sequence with sequences in the protein data base found 100% homology with human calreticulin. Further experiments were performed to determine binding specificity of fibrinogen Bβ chain to the 60-kDa protein, identified as calreticulin. Fig. 3, track a, shows the ability of CNBr fragments of fibrinogen Bβ chain to elute calreticulin from a Bβ chain affinity column. For comparison, also shown in Fig. 3, track b, is the 60-kDa protein eluted with 40 mM EDTA. Calreticulin has previously been reported as a calcium binding protein found predominantly on the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum. It was therefore important for the present study to determine that calreticulin was also found on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane. Fig. 4, track a, shows an autoradiograph of 125I-labeled calreticulin purified from cells scraped from a tissue culture dish in the presence of protease inhibitors prior to 125I labeling; a clear 60-kDa band can be observed. In contrast, Fig. 4, track b, shows proteins purified in an fashion identical with those shown in Fig. 4, track a, with the exception that cells were trypsinized from tissue culture plates prior to 125I labeling. 125I-Labeled 60-kDa protein was not isolated from cells which were harvested with the serine protease trypsin. Additional experiments were performed to confirm the identity of the 60-kDa protein and to further determine its presence as a cell surface protein capable of binding to fibrinogen Bβ chain. Fig. 5, track a, shows an autoradiograph of 125I-surface-labeled proteins immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-calreticulin antibody. Fig. 5, track b, shows a repetition of the immunoprecipitation experiment in Fig. 5, track a, with the exception that cells were trypsinized prior to radiolabeling. The presence of a clear 60-kDa band (visualized in Fig. 5, track a) confirms that the protein isolated from plasma membranes and purified on a fibrinogen Bβ chain affinity column is a cell surface form of calreticulin. Further, the low intensity of the 60-kDa band visualized in Fig. 5, track b, provides additional evidence that the 60-kDa protein is present on the cell surface and is thus sensitive to trypsin degradation. Tracks c and d of Fig. 5 show IgG controls for both scraped and trypsinized cells, respectively. In addition to surface-labeling cells with 125I, cells were also surface-biotinylated. Fig. 6, track b, shows biotinylated surface calreticulin immunoprecipitated with anti-calreticulin antibodies. Finally, calreticulin was visualized by immunostaining of the cell surface with polyclonal anti-calreticulin antibodies. Fig. 7A shows human fetal fibroblasts after incubation with anti-calreticulin antibodies. In contrast Fig. 7B shows cells incubated with nonimmune IgG. Calreticulin is clearly visualized in A, and no signal was visualized with nonimmune IgG controls (B). Surface biotinylation and immunostaining provided further evidence, using two alternative surface-labeling technique, that calreticulin is present on the surface of the plasma membrane.Figure 7Immunostaining of human fetal fibroblasts for surface calreticulin. Human fetal fibroblasts were incubated with polyclonal anti-calreticulin antibodies or nonimmune IgG controls for 20 min at 37°C in DMEM. Cells were subsequently fixed and signal-visualized with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. A and B show fibroblasts incubated with polyclonal anti-calreticulin antibodies and nonimmune IgG controls, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In an attempt to determine the function of the calreticulin/fibrinogen Bβ chain interaction, immune IgG raised against human calreticulin was employed to block the mitogenic activity of the fibrinogen Bβ chain (Fig. 8). In this series of experiments, the Bβ chain elicited a mitogenic response of between 63 and 42% above control. Polyclonal calreticulin antibodies significantly reduced the mitogenic activity of the Bβ chain from 63% above media control to 33% above media control at a 1:500 dilution and from 44% above media control to 31% above media control at a dilution of 1:1000. A 1:5000 dilution of antibodies neither stimulated nor inhibited fibrinogen Bβ chain activity. IgG controls tested over a comparable range of concentrations to those employed to test the effects of anti-calreticulin antibodies on Bβ chain activity neither stimulated nor inhibited the mitogenic effect of the fibrinogen Bβ chain. It is well established that partially degraded fibrin(ogen) is a fibroblast mitogen(1Gray A.J. Bishop J.E. Reeves J.T. Mecham R.P. Laurent G.J. Am. J. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 12: 684-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), an action which is mediated in part by sites within the Bβ chains of the molecule(2Gray A.J. Bishop J.E. Reeves J.T. Laurent G.J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 409-413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It remains to characterize receptors expressed by fibroblasts which interact with fibrinogen Bβ chain and possibly mediate its biological functions. The present study isolated a membrane-bound protein which specifically bound to the Bβ chain of fibrinogen. The purified protein displayed an apparent molecular mass of about 60 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis. Sequence analysis of the purified 60-kDa protein has shown it to have an amino-terminal sequence identical with that of calreticulin. The 60-kDa protein was further identified through immunoprecipitation experiments and immunohistochemistry employing polyclonal anti-calreticulin antibodies. Calreticulin has been described by several independent groups as a calcium-binding protein with a molecular mass of 46 kDa(6Fliegel L. Burns K. MacLennan D.H. Reithmeier R.A.F. Michalak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21522-21528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent anomaly between the molecular size determined by SDS-PAGE analysis and molecular size determined from cDNA is thought to be a consequence of the low isoelectric point of calreticulin which may result in its slow migration through SDS-PAGE gels(7McCauliffe D.P. Lux F.A. Leu T.S. Sanz I. Hanke J. Newkirk M.M. Bachinski L.L. Itoh Y. Siciliano M.J. Reichlin M. Sontheimer R.D. Capra J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1379-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In addition to the well characterized role of calreticulin as a major calcium storage protein of the endoplasmic reticulum(8MacLennan D.H. Yip C.C. Iles G.H. Seeman P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1972; 37: 469-477Crossref Google Scholar), calreticulin also displays a number of diverse activities which have direct effects on cell function. For example, a recent study by Burns et al.(9Burns K. Duggan B. Atkinson E.A. Famulski K.S. Nemer M. Bleackley R.C. Michalak M. Nature. 1994; 367: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) showed that calreticulin binds to the DNA-binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor; an event that prevented receptor-ligand interaction. These results suggest that calreticulin may play a direct role in gene transcription by regulating receptor activity. Additionally, calreticulin binds the highly conserved KXGFFKR sequence found in the cytoplasmic domain of all α-integrin subunits(10Rojiani M.V. Finlay B.B. Gray V. Dedhar S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9859-9866Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), thus mediating cell attachment to the extra cellular matrix(11Leung-Hagesteijn C.Y. Milankov K. Michalak M. Wilkins J. Dedhar S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 589-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The KXGFFKR sequence found as a component structure of α-integrin subunits is similar to the sequence found in the DNA-binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor. It has been speculated that these two binding events are coordinated and that calreticulin may mediate the transduction of signals from integrins to the nucleus(11Leung-Hagesteijn C.Y. Milankov K. Michalak M. Wilkins J. Dedhar S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 589-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Calreticulin was originally thought to be confined to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) on account of its carboxyl-terminal KDEL sequence; a sequence known to play a role in the retention of proteins within the ER(12Pelham H.R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). It has become apparent over the last few years that, although a large proportion of intercellular calreticulin is retained within the ER, it is also found in several other locations. For example, calreticulin is found as a component of the nuclear envelope(13Opas M. Dziak E. Fliegel L. Michalak M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), it is also associated with component proteins on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane. Additionally, calreticulin has been identified on the cell surface of human leukocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells(14Malhotra R. Willis A.C. Jensenius J.C. Jackson J. Sim R.B. Immunology. 1993; 78: 341-348PubMed Google Scholar, 15Malhotra R. Behring Inst. Mitt. 1993; 93: 254-261PubMed Google Scholar). Release of cell surface calreticulin from stimulated neutrophils is thought to play a role in some autoimmune disorders(16Eggleton P. Lieu T.S. Zappi E.G. Sastry K. Cobburn J. Zaner K.S. Sontheimer R.D. Capra J.D. Ghebrehiwet B. Tauber A.I. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1994; 72: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although there have been reports of extracellular calreticulin (14Malhotra R. Willis A.C. Jensenius J.C. Jackson J. Sim R.B. Immunology. 1993; 78: 341-348PubMed Google Scholar, 15Malhotra R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8179-8187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), it was considered important to determine that the calreticulin described in the present study was expressed on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane. The first question considered was as follows. Did the 125I-cell surface-labeling procedure label only surface proteins? The efficiency of cell surface labeling was verified using the protease trypsin. 125I-labeled 60-kDa protein was not eluted from a fibrinogen Bβ chain affinity column when cells had been incubated with trypsin prior to 125I labeling. This observation suggested that iodination experiments performed in the present study labeled exclusively proteins expressed on the cell surface. Additionally, 125I-labeled and biotinylated surface calreticulin was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody, and a clear 60-kDa band was observed. However, immunoprecipitation of calreticulin from cells trypsinized prior to 125I-labeling yielded only a very small quantity of 125I-labeled calreticulin. Immunostaining of cultured fibroblasts for calreticulin provided further evidence that calreticulin was present as a surface component. In this series of experiments, antibodies were incubated with live cells to ensure that cell membranes were intact and, thus, that only surface calreticulin was labeled. Finally, polyclonal antibodies to calreticulin inhibited the mitogenic activity of fibrinogen Bβ chain on human fetal fibroblasts. These results suggest the antibody interacts with an epitope on the cell surface, thus inhibiting cellular proliferation. Binding specificity of the Bβ chain of fibrinogen to calreticulin was also considered in the present study. Calreticulin was eluted from the Bβ chain affinity column with EDTA, suggesting a cation-dependent binding event. A similar requirement for divalent cations has also been described for the interaction of calreticulin with the α-integrin subunit(11Leung-Hagesteijn C.Y. Milankov K. Michalak M. Wilkins J. Dedhar S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 589-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that calreticulin was also eluted from a fibrinogen Bβ chain affinity column with soluble Bβ chain fragments indicating a competitive interaction between bound and free ligand. The function of fibrinogen Bβ chain/calreticulin interactions were investigated with purified IgG raised against human calreticulin. Incorporation of anti-calreticulin antibodies into the methylene blue cell replication assay significantly inhibited the mitogenic activity of the fibrinogen Bβ chain. Further, IgG controls neither stimulated nor inhibited the mitogenic effects of the Bβ chain. It is becoming apparent that the role of calreticulin is more than simply one of calcium storage. The observation that a form of calreticulin is expressed on the cell surface and has the ability to trigger cell replication is in its self interesting. In the light of the present findings, it is also of interest to note that calreticulin contains a sequence which has the potential for phosphorylation by a number of kinases(18Michalak M. Milner R.E. Burns K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). It has recently been observed that a simian homologue of human calreticulin is phosphorylated, a function which facilitates its binding to viral RNA(19Singh N.K. Atreya C.D. Nakhasi H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12770-12774Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is now important to determine whether the cell surface form of calreticulin described in this study is in fact phosphorylated or is capable of phosphorylating other protein components. high performance liquid chromatography polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phosphate-buffered saline endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W2084756873,"To identify elements of the human α subunit gene necessary for cell-specific expression, we generated an array of block mutations spanning approximately 400 base pairs (bp) of promoter proximal region and examined them using transient transfection analysis in pituitary (αT3) and placental (BeWo) cell lines. Comparison of promoter activity in the two cell types revealed both common and unique elements required for transcription in pituitary and placenta. Two strong elements, the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) and the upstream regulatory element (URE), regulate expression of the α subunit gene in BeWo cells. In contrast, promoter activity in αT3 cells requires an array of weaker elements. These include the CREs, the URE, as well as two previously described elements, pituitary glycoprotein hormone basal element (PGBE) and gonadotrope-specific element (GSE), and two new elements we designated as the α basal elements 1 and 2 (αBE1 and αBE2). These new elements reside between −316 and −302 bp (αBE1) and −296 and −285 bp (αBE2) of the human α subunit promoter and bind distinct proteins designated αBP1 and αBP2, respectively. Southwestern blot analysis revealed that αBE1 specifically binds 54- and 56-kDa proteins. Additional studies disclosed several potential interactions between proteins that bind the CRE and proteins that occupy PGBE, αBE1, and αBE2, suggesting that gonadotrope-specific expression occurs through a unique composite regulatory element that includes components of the placenta-specific enhancer.

The glycoprotein hormones luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and chorionic gonadotropin regulate a variety of key biological functions, including reproduction, pregnancy, and metabolism. These hormones belong to a family of heterodimeric proteins composed of a common α subunit and a specific β subunit(1Pierce J. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar). The α subunit is expressed in the pituitaries of all mammals as the product of a single-copy gene (2Fiddes J.C. Goddman H.M. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1981; 1 (abstr.): 3-18PubMed Google Scholar). In this tissue, expression occurs in two distinct cell types: gonadotropes, where it is a subunit of both follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, and thyrotropes, where it is a subunit of thyroid-stimulating hormone(3Bousfield G.R. Perry W.M. Ward D.N. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd. New York1994: 1749-1791Google Scholar). In addition, the α subunit gene is expressed in the placenta of primates and horses(4Chin W.W. Imura H. The Pituitary Gland. Raven Press, New York1984: 103-125Google Scholar, 5Moore W.T. Burleigh B.D. Ward D.N. Segal S.J. Chorionic Gonadotropin. Plenum Press, New York1980: 89-126Crossref Google Scholar). Here, it is expressed in trophoblast cells as a subunit of chorionic gonadotropin in primates or as pregnant mare serum gonadotropin in horses. Because the human α subunit gene is expressed in both placenta and pituitary, examination of its promoter allows a comparative analysis of the mechanisms involved in directing expression of the same gene to two separate tissues. Such studies have been aided by the availability of both placenta and pituitary cell lines that express the α subunit gene. Analysis of the human α subunit promoter in placental cell lines (BeWo or JEG3) has revealed the presence of a composite enhancer located within the first 180 bp 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)PGBEpituitary glycoprotein hormone basal elementGSEgonadotrope-specific elementUREupstream regulatory elementCREcAMP response elementJREjunctional response elementPCRpolymerase chain reactionEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift analysisTSEtrophoblast-specific elementαBEα basal element. of the promoter(6Delegeane A.M.

This enhancer confers placenta-specific expression and consists of an upstream regulatory element (URE) and two juxtaposed (tandem) cyclic AMP response elements (CREs). Many earlier studies revealed a synergistic relationship between the URE and CREs in placenta, suggesting a functional interaction between the proteins that bind these elements(7Jameson J.L.

Additional elements are also required for optimal expression in placenta cells and include the junctional response element (JRE) (14Andersen B. Kennedy G.C. Nilson J.H. J. Biol.

The emerging model for gonadotrope-specific expression builds on the current model of placenta-specific expression. Although incomplete at this stage, transfection studies with mouse and human promoters containing deletion and clustered mutations have revealed the location of several elements important for expression in gonadotropes(16Kay T.W.H. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1767-1773PubMed Google Scholar, 17Schoderbek W.E. Kim K.W. Ridgway E.C. Mellon P.L. Maurer R.A. Mol.

These elements reside within the first 435 bp of the human promoter and 507 bp of the mouse promoter(17Schoderbek W.E. Kim K.W. Ridgway E.C. Mellon P.L. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 893-903PubMed Google Scholar, 18Horn F. Windle J.J. Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2143-2153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the human promoter, several elements have been identified as important for promoter activity in the pituitary gonadotrope cell line αT3. These include the gonadotrope-specific element (GSE)(18Horn F. Windle J.J. Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2143-2153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the CREs, and the αACT element(17Schoderbek W.E. Kim K.W. Ridgway E.C. Mellon P.L. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 893-903PubMed Google Scholar, 19Steger D.J. Hecht J.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5592-5602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An additional element in the mouse α promoter, the pituitary glycoprotein hormone basal element (PGBE), has been identified as an important regulator of basal transcription in gonadotropes(17Schoderbek W.E. Kim K.W. Ridgway E.C. Mellon P.L. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 893-903PubMed Google Scholar, 20Roberson M.S. Schoderbek W.E. Tremml G. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The significance of the PGBE in the human promoter is not known. Although these studies add to our understanding of α subunit expression in gonadotropes, a more extensive analysis of the promoter is clearly needed to help identify the regions important for regulation of this gene. We therefore utilized an array of single and double block mutations spanning nucleotides −430 to −95 of the human α subunit promoter to further define the regulatory elements necessary for expression. These studies unveiled several potential interactions that collectively define a new composite regulatory element that controls pituitary-specific expression and established the presence of two new elements, αBE1 and αBE2, important for expression in gonadotropes. Only the highest grade reagents were utilized. Reagents and venders include the following: Tris-HCl, NaCl, MgCl2, glycerol, bisacrylamide, potassium acetate, sodium hydroxide, Triton X-100, and boric acid (Fisher); phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, EDTA, and Nonidet P 40 (Sigma); dithiothreitol, acrylamide, and SDS (Boehringer Mannheim); lipofectamine, HEPES, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, horse serum, fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and Waymouths media (Life Technologies, Inc.); nucleotides and poly(dI-dC):poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.); ethanol (Aaper, Shelbyville, KY); restriction enzymes and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc. or Boehringer Mannheim); and radionucleotides were purchased from DuPont NEN. αT3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, penicillin, and streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) (21Windle J.J. Weiner R.I. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). BeWo cells (ATCC) were grown in Waymouth's media supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. All plasmid DNAs were prepared from overnight bacterial cultures using Qiagen DNA plasmid columns according to the supplier's protocol (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Oligonucleotides were purchased from Midland Scientific (Midland, TX). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were generated by heating complementary oligonucleotides to 95°C in the presence of 10 mM Tris (8.0), 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA and allowing them to cool slowly to room temperature. Radiolabeled oligonucleotides were generated using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The human α subunit promoter was isolated from Hα(−1500/+45)CAT plasmid (12Silver B.J. Bokar J. Virgin J.B. Valen E. Milsted A. Nilson J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2198-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) by digestion with HindIII and subcloned into the HindIII site of the luciferase reporter vector pGL2 Basic (Promega) to generate Hα(−1500)Luc. Hα(−845)Luc was generated by digesting Hα(−1500)Luc with BglII and religation. Hα(−485)Luc was generated by digestion of Hα(−1500)Luc with NsiI and XhoI, blunting the DNA using a fill-in reaction with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, gel isolation of the DNA fragment, and ligation of the DNA ends. Generation of each of the mutant constructs was accomplished by bidirectional PCR using Deep Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The reactions were performed using the buffer supplied by the manufacturer in the presence of 300 μM each dNTP, 100 pmol of each primer, 2 ng of Hα(−1500)CAT template, and 1.5 units of Deep Vent polymerase per 100-μl reaction. For each clone, two independent PCR reactions were performed: an upstream PCR reaction using a standard 5′-primer plus a 3′-mutant primer and a downstream PCR reaction using a 5′-mutant primer and a 3′-standard primer. The primer set for each mutant contained overlapping sequence within the mutation in which there was a common restriction enzyme site. The reaction mixtures were precipitated with ethanol, and the DNA was redissolved in the appropriate restriction enzyme buffer and digested with restriction enzymes compatible with both the Hα(−845)Luc cloning vector and the restriction enzyme common to both mutant primers. The products of the digestion were separated by electrophoresis on an 6-8% polyacrylamide gel in TBE and 5% glycerol. After staining, the bands of the appropriate size were excised and isolated. The new clones were generated by a triple ligation with each digested PCR product and a Hα(−845)Luc vector that was digested with either NsiI/SnaBI or SnaBI/PstI. To generate the Hα(−1500)Luc mutants, the upstream fragment, which extends from the BglII site at −845 to the HindIII site at approximately −1500, was subcloned into each mutant using the BglII site and an appropriate site within the multiple cloning site. All clones were confirmed by sequencing using the Sequenase 2.0 sequencing kit from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Double mutants were made by subcloning DNA fragments containing one mutation into a vector having the second mutation. The double mutant Hα(−1500)μ7/μ14 was made by subcloning the 600-bp SnaBI-BglII fragment of μ7 into the analogous site in Hα(−1500)μ14. Hα(−1500)μ8/μ14 contains the SnaBI-BglII fragment of μ8 inserted in the analogous position in Hα(−1500)μ14. Hα(−1500)μ11/μ14 contains the 846-bp SauI fragment of Hα(−1500)μ14 cloned into the analogous site in Hα(−1500)μ11. Hα(−1500)μ7/μ11 contains the 600-bp SnaBI-BglII fragment of μ7 into the analogous site in μ11. Hα(−1500)μ8/μ11 contains the 600-bp SnaBI-BglII fragment of μ8 cloned into the analogous site of μ11. The μ7/μ8 clone required an additional PCR reaction. The PCR reactions for this mutant were the same as with the original μ8 clone, except that the 3′-primer of the upstream PCR reaction was changed to 5′-CGTAAGAGCTCGGTACCTCCCGGGCTCGGTACCTGTACCTGATATTTAC-3′, and the template for the PCR reaction was Hα(−1500)μ7. The clone was generated as described above. The mutated sequence within region 8 is altered slightly from the original μ8 mutation in that it has an 8-bp deletion. Removal of bases from region 8 is unlikely to alter the interpretation of the results, as the binding sites for the proteins in question are still fully disrupted, and there are no upstream elements that would be affected by the spacing change. αT3 cells were seeded onto 35-mm plates at a density of 170,000 cells per plate. The day after seeding, the cells were transfected using lipofectamine reagent according to the manufacturer's suggestions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Each construct (1.25 μg) was cotransfected with 0.42 μg of Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase, to control for transfection efficiency, in triplicate using 5 μl of lipofectamine. The cells were incubated with the lipofectamine/DNA solution overnight, which was then replaced with complete medium. Cells were harvested 48 h after removal of the DNA using 150 μl of lysis buffer (Promega). After removal from the plates, the lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4°C, and the supernatant was assayed for both luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. BeWo cells were seeded into 35-mm plates at a density of 85,000 cells per well. The day after plating, the cells were transfected and harvested as above, except 8 μl of lipofectamine was used for transfection. Luciferase assays were performed using 10-20 μl of lysate and 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega). Emitted light was quantified as residual light units in a Berthold Lumat LB9501 luminometer (WALLAC Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The light units emitted for the human wild-type α subunit promoter were in the range of 1-3 × 106 residual light units. β-Galactosidase activity was quantified by luminescence as above using the Galacto-light assay system (Tropix, Bedford, MA). The light units emitted for β-galactosidase activity were in the range of 2-6 × 106 residual light units. The linear range of both assays was determined, and all data presented fell within those ranges. For each transfection, the luciferase/β-galactosidase activity of each construct was normalized to the luciferase/β-galactosidase activity of the wild-type promoter. The values were then averaged over a minimum of three independent experiments. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described elsewhere(22Abmayr S.M. Workman J.L. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene and Wiley Inter-Science, New York1994: 12.1.1-12.1.9Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA) was performed as described previously with slight modification(23Chodosh L.A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene and Wiley Inter-Science, New York1994: 12.2.1-12.2.10Google Scholar). 7 μg of αT3 nuclear extract was incubated with 25-50 fmol of radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide in the presence of 10 mM MgCl2, 25 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 12.5 mM HEPES (7.9), 0.5% Triton X-100, 200 ng of Escherichia coli DNA, 200 ng of salmon sperm DNA, 10% glycerol, and 1.0 μg of poly(dI-dC):(dI-dC) in a 20-μl reaction volume. Reactions were incubated on ice 5 min prior to the addition of probe and then an additional 10 min after. Reactions were loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 × TBE and subjected to 240 volts for 3-4 h. The gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography using Dupont's Reflections autoradiography film (DuPont NEN). This analysis involved modification of a procedure described elsewhere(18Horn F. Windle J.J. Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2143-2153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 40 μg of nuclear extract was resolved on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel with a 4% stacking gel and a 10% resolving gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell). Membrane-bound proteins were renatured in binding buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) for 45 min at room temperature, and the filters were then blocked for 3 h at room temperature in binding buffer plus 5% nonfat dry milk. The membrane was then rinsed with binding buffer and hybridized overnight at 4°C in binding buffer containing 0.5% Carnation nonfat dry milk, 1 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 1 × 106 cpm/ml of probe. The membrane was then rinsed one time in binding buffer and washed for 30 min at room temperature in binding buffer, changing the buffer one time during the interval. The blot was analyzed by autoradiography as described above. Prestained molecular weight markers (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used to estimate the molecular weights of the proteins. To better define the regions of the α subunit promoter important for pituitary and placental expression, we have generated an extensive array of block mutations spanning nucleotides −430 to −95 of the human α promoter and placed each mutation within the context of the naturally occurring 1500-bp sequence located upstream of the transcriptional start site. Fig. 1 identifies the bases altered in each mutation. Several of these mutations span regions that contain elements previously described as important for either human or mouse α promoter activity and are identified in the figure legend. Promoters containing the various mutations were placed upstream of the luciferase reporter gene and assayed by transient transfection analysis in both gonadotrope (αT3) and placenta (BeWo) cell lines. Results from transfection in BeWo cells confirmed that activity of this promoter is regulated by three main elements that lie within the regions disrupted by μ13 (URE), μ14 (tandem CREs), and μ15 (JRE) (Fig. 2A). All of these reside within the first 182 nucleotides upstream of the transcriptional start site. Mutations in either the URE or the CREs had a dramatic effect on promoter activity, whereas the effect of the JRE mutation was less pronounced. These elements have been identified previously as important for placenta-specific expression(6Delegeane A.M. Ferland L.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell.

In contrast to BeWo cells, expression in αT3 cells requires a more complex array of elements that lie within regions disrupted by μ7, μ8, μ11, μ13, μ14, and to a lesser extent μ9 (Fig. 2B). Elements disrupted by μ11, μ13, and μ14 have previously been described for their role in regulating expression of the human α subunit gene in gonadotropes and correspond to the GSE, the URE, and the CREs, respectively(17Schoderbek W.E. Kim K.W. Ridgway E.C. Mellon P.L. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 893-903PubMed Google Scholar, 18Horn F. Windle J.J. Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1994; 14: 5592-5602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). μ7 is a mutation through the PGBE, an element that was described previously only in the mouse promoter(17Schoderbek W.E. Kim K.W. Ridgway E.C. Mellon P.L. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 893-903PubMed Google Scholar, 20Roberson M.S. Schoderbek W.E. Tremml G. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This study therefore establishes a role for the PGBE in transcriptional regulation of the human promoter as well. More importantly, the presence of a new element within the bases altered by μ8 has been revealed. Further analysis of this element is presented below. An important attribute of the block replacement approach is the ability to compare the relative contributions that each element makes to promoter function while maintaining the normal sequence environment. In the placental cell line, the tandem CREs are clearly the dominant basal element. Mutation of this element dramatically reduced promoter activity to 2% of wild type (Fig. 2A). Mutation of the URE reduced activity to 15% of wild type, while mutation of the JRE only reduced activity to 32%. In contrast, the main elements involved in gonadotrope-specific expression had less dramatic effects on promoter activity, with the majority of the mutations reducing promoter activity to between 30 and 50% of wild type (Fig. 2B). Although not as clearly dominant as in BeWo cells, the CREs did have the strongest effect on promoter activity in gonadotropes. Thus, while expression in the placenta appears to be controlled by two strong elements, expression in the pituitary is regulated by an array of weaker elements. Furthermore, these results show that distinct arrays of regulatory elements direct expression to placenta and pituitary. The scanning mutagenesis shown in Fig. 2B disclosed the presence of an undefined element(s) within the region disrupted by μ8 that is important for expression in αT3 cells. This element resides between bases −320 and −288 of the human promoter and is juxtaposed to the PGBE. To further define the site and to ensure that the diminished promoter activity is not the result of abrogating the binding of protein(s) to PGBE, several additional mutations were made (Fig. 3A). Transfection analysis indicated that three of the more restricted mutations within this region (μ8.1, μ8.2, and μ8.4) had considerable impact on promoter activity. A mutation that abuts μ8, μ9.1, also diminished promoter activity (Fig. 3B). These smaller mutations define a new region important for promoter activity that is distinct from the PGBE(20Roberson M.S. Schoderbek W.E. Tremml G. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of this region disclosed the presence of a potential Ets protein-binding site spanning positions −301 to −298. This family of transcription factors interacts specifically with sequences containing a common core tetranucleotide, GGAA, where both guanines are required for binding(24Rorth P. Nerlov C. Blasi F. Johnsen M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5009-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 25Gutman A. Wasylyk B.

A mutation that alters the essential guanines of this site (μ8.3) had little influence on promoter activity, suggesting that under basal conditions the transcription factor involved in activation of this promoter via this new element is not a member of the Ets family. EMSA using a radiolabeled probe spanning bases within region 8 revealed the presence of a single major shifted complex from αT3 nuclear extracts (Fig. 4A). Formation of this major protein complex, indicated on the gel as αBP1 (α binding protein 1), was inhibited by increasing concentrations of unlabeled homologous competitor DNA but not by unlabeled competitor DNAs containing the μ8 mutation sequence (Fig. 1) or a nonspecific sequence. An oligonucleotide-containing sequence corresponding to the PGBE was also an ineffective competitor (Fig. 4B). Thus, αBP1 binds specifically to region 8 of the α subunit promoter and is distinct from proteins binding the PGBE. EMSA in the presence of competitor oligonucleotides that contain mutations within the μ8 region was used to identify the bases important for binding of αBP1 (Fig. 5). Oligonucleotides μ2 through μ5, which contained mutations between bases −313 and −302, failed to compete the αBP1 signal, indicating that bases within this region are important for formation of the αBP1 complex. In contrast, oligonucleotides containing mutations downstream of base −302 (μ6 and μ7) effectively competed for αBP1 binding, while an oligonucleotide containing mutations upstream of −312, μ1, was capable of only partial competition. This indicates that the bases important for αBP1 binding lie between −316 and −302, defining the α basal element one (αBE1). As indicated above, αBP1 binding is not affected by mutations downstream of base −302. However, transfection analysis indicated that bases within this downstream region are important for promoter activity (μ8.4 and μ9.1, Fig. 3). This suggested that a second element resides within this more downstream region and binds a transcription factor distinct from αBP1. EMSA, using a radiolabeled oligonucleotide spanning through the 3′-portion of region 8 into region 9 (wt2), revealed the binding of a second protein complex, α binding protein 2 (αBP2, Fig. 6). Binding of αBP2 is competed by increasing concentrations of unlabeled wild-type competitor but not by either a"

We show that in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, both eIF-4E and another cap-binding complex protein, p20, are phosphoproteins. The major sites of phosphorylation of yeast eIF-4E are found to be located in the N-terminal region of its sequence (Ser2 and Ser15) and are thus in a different part of the protein from the main phosphorylation sites (Ser53 and Ser209) proposed previously for mammalian eIF-4E. The most likely sites of p20 phosphorylation are at Ser91 and/or Ser154. All of the major sites in the two yeast proteins are phosphorylated by casein kinase II in vitro. Casein kinase II phosphorylation of cap-complex proteins should therefore be considered as potentially involved in the control of yeast protein synthesis.

The sequencing of several eIF-4E genes has revealed strong homology within the group of known mammalian polypeptide sequences and less extensive, but clearly evident, homology between the yeast eIF-4E sequence and the sequences of the counterpart proteins of mammals and wheat.

Thus, there is also at least partial functional homology between the various eIF-4E proteins. At the same time, the functional role(s) of eIF-4E is(are) incompletely defined. Certain reports have already indicated that this protein might be directly or indirectly involved in a number of processes other than translation. For example, the yeast eIF-4E gene has been identified as the locus of a cell-cycle mutation (cdc 33) that arrests the mitotic cycle at the “start” stage(10Brenner C. Nakayama N. Goebl M. Tanaka K.

One striking property of mammalian eIF-4E is that its overproduction can lead to the transformation of higher cells(13Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N.

Moreover, increased levels of this initiation factor allow enhanced translation of mRNAs whose leaders bear strongly inhibitory secondary structure (15Koromilas A.E. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4153-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the overproduction of yeast eIF-4E has little effect on growth or on translation limited by mRNA structure in S. cerevisiae(12Lang V. Zanchin N.I.T. Lünsdorf H. Tuite M. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6117-6123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Various lines of evidence indicate that the phosphorylation state of eukaryotic initiation factors can influence their activities in translation(2Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). The most convincing case so far is that of eIF-2. Phosphorylation of the α subunit of this factor by specific kinases at serine 51 in mammals (2Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev.

Phosphorylation of other sites in the C-terminal region of eIF-2α by casein kinase II also influences eIF-2 activity, albeit in a more subtle manner(17Feng L. Yoon H. Donahue T.F. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1991; 266: 3162-3166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, dephosphorylation has been found to accompany the inhibition of protein synthesis under various conditions(26Duncan R. Milburn S.C. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 380-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Feigenblum D. Schneider R.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3027-3035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Zhang Y. Feigenblum D. Schneider R.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7040-7050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these are indirect correlations which are insufficient to prove the existence of a causal link between phosphorylation and the activity of eIF-4E. A more direct demonstration of a functional change associated with phosphorylation was reported by Minich et al.(29Minich W.B. Balasta M.L. Goss D.J. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7668-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), who found that the phosphorylated form of mammalian eIF-4E has a 3-fold enhanced affinity for the cap. What is(are) the site(s) of phosphorylation in eIF-4E? Ser53 was identified as a residue whose mutation to alanine nullifies certain properties of the wild-type factor(30Rychlik W. Russ M.A. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10434-10437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, whereas the overproduction of wild-type eIF-4E induced aberrant growth in rodent and Hela cells, this effect was not observed when the Ala53 mutant was used(13Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1990; 345: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, 14De Benedetti A. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8212-8216Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Similarly, overexpression of the wild-type gene, but not of the Ala53 mutant form, seemed to allow enhanced translation of mRNAs with structured leaders in mouse cells(15Koromilas A.E. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4153-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). It was also reported that the Ala53 mutation prevents incorporation of eIF-4E into the 48 S initiation complex(31Joshi-Barve S. Rychlik W. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2979-2983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Certain lines of evidence have indicated that eIF-4E may be phosphorylated by protein kinase C(21Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2401-2404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Morley S.J. Thomas G. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1991; 50: 291-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Morley S.J.

Biochem. 1993; 218: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and this enzyme has therefore been assumed to be involved in the regulation of eIF-4E activity. However, conflicting evidence has thrown doubt on the significance of phosphorylation at position 53 in the mammalian eIF-4E amino acid sequence. It was observed that mutation of Ser53 to Ala did not affect the phosphorylation level of transiently overexpressed eIF-4E in COS-1 monkey kidney cells(32Kaufmann R.J. Murtha-Riel P. Pittman D.D. Davies M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11902-11909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These authors also detected no effects of the overexpression of either wild-type or mutant forms of mammalian eIF-4E on translational initiation in this cell type. This therefore suggests that there may be an alternative explanation of the results obtained by others using Ser53 mutation(s). For example, the Ser to Ala substitution at position 53 may result in a conformational mutant form of eIF-4E with altered properties that are unrelated to the phosphorylation state of this factor. Indeed, it was more recently reported that the major site of phosphorylation in mammalian eIF-4E is Ser209(33Joshi B. Cai A.-L. Keiper B.D. Minich W.B. Mendez R. Beach C.M. Stepinski J. Stolarski R. Darzynkiewicz E. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14597-14603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Up to now, there has been no information available about the phosphorylation sites in the yeast cap-binding complex eIF-4F. Given the widely acknowledged significance of S. cerevisiae as an experimental organism for studies of translation, as well as the uncertainty surrounding the results obtained so far with the mammalian factor, it has become especially important to investigate eIF-4F phosphorylation in this lower eukaryote. We have used biochemical and genetic techniques to show that both eIF-4E and p20 in yeast are phosphoproteins and that they are phosphorylated by the same kinase. We examine the functional significance of these phosphorylation events. The results provide a new perspective on the pathway and role of phosphorylation in the regulation of the eukaryotic mRNA•cap-binding complex eIF-4F.

Bacterial media and DNA cloning and sequencing techniques were performed as described previously(34Sambrook J. Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Yeast media were prepared as described by Sherman et al.(37Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). YEPD low phosphate medium was prepared according to Rubin(38Rubin G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3860-3875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both E. coli and S. cerevisiae were transformed by electroporation. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1979; 227: 680-685Crossref Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and Western blotting (40Towbin H. Stachelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar) were performed as described. Isoelectrofocusing was adapted from Dever et al.(41Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The ampholytes were a mixture of 4:1 of the pH ranges 5-7:3-10. Quantitation of eIF-4E and p20 protein and of their phosphorylation was performed via analysis of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and autoradiography using an image analyzer. Total protein synthesis was determined by measuring [35S]L-methionine incorporation rates in minimal medium (SD medium(37Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar)). The plasmid pCYTEXP1 (42Belev T.N. Singh M. McCarthy J.E.G. Plasmid. 1991; 26: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was used for synthesis of eIF-4E in E. coli and for isolating single-stranded DNA for in vitro mutagenesis. The yeast eIF-4E gene was inserted into this vector as an NdeI-BamHI restriction fragment(12Lang V. Zanchin N.I.T. Lünsdorf H. Tuite M. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6117-6123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant eIF-4E was obtained from E. coli TG2 as described previously(12Lang V. Zanchin N.I.T. Lünsdorf H. Tuite M. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6117-6123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Edery I. Altmann M. Sonenberg N. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Synthesis of eIF-4E and its mutants in yeast was performed using the GPF promoter plasmid YCpSUPEX1 (44Oliveira C.C. van den Heuvel J.J. McCarthy J.E.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and the TRP1 promoter plasmid YCp332TRP1. The latter plasmid was constructed by substituting a 1.6-kilobase fragment bearing the TRP1 promoter (45Dobson M.J. Tuite M.F. Mellor J. Roberts N.A. King R.M. Burke D.C. Kingsman A.J. Kingsman S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 2287-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) for the GPF promoter in YCpSUPEX1. The derivatives of these plasmids were introduced into the strain 4-2, after which plasmid shuffling was performed to allow loss of pMDA101. For in vivo labeling, cells were grown in low phosphate medium to an OD550 = 0.4, centrifuged, and resuspended in fresh medium containing 200 μCi/ml 32Pi. After incubation for 1.5 h at 30°C, the cells were washed and resuspended in buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mM NaF, 5 mM glycerol phosphate) and vortexed with glass beads. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the cap-binding complex proteins were isolated from the extracts by means of affinity chromatography using a 7-methyl-GTP-Sepharose column (Pharmacia). Casein kinase II was purified from strain 4-2 (carrying the wild-type eIF-4E gene in YCpSUPEX1) using a protocoll adapted from Padmanabha and Glover(46Padmanabha R. Glover C.V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1829-1835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cell extracts were fractionated on a Q-Sepharose column. The fractions possessing casein kinase II activity were pooled and run through a heparin-Sepharose affinity column. Finally, the kinase preparation was concentrated on a fast protein liquid chromatography MonoQ column (Pharmacia). The kinase activity assay was performed using β-casein as acceptor according to Glover et al.(47Glover C.V.C. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3258-3265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the incubation temperature was 30°C. Phosphorylation assays were also performed using recombinant eIF-4E or cap-binding proteins isolated from yeast instead of β-casein. Phosphoamino acid analysis and two-dimensional peptide analysis were performed on thin layer cellulose plates (Kodak)(48Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar, 49van der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1993: 31-58Google Scholar). For HPLC analysis, 200 μl (about 2 nmol) of eIF-4E tryptic peptides were applied to a reverse-phase C18 column (Waters-Millipore) and eluted over a period of 80 min using a 5-50% acetonitrile gradient (flow-rate = 0.5 ml/min). In order to determine whether yeast eIF-4E is phosphorylated in vivo, we added 32Pi to shaking cultures of log-phase yeast. After a period of incubation of 90 min, cell extracts were prepared and subjected to affinity chromatography. Separation of the cap-binding complex proteins using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analysis using autoradiography revealed that both p20 and eIF-4E are phosphoproteins, whereby the former was approximately 10 times more strongly labeled than the latter (Fig. 1, A and B). Isoelectrofocussing of labeled extracts yielded various bands in the pH range 5.6 to 6.0 detectable by immunoblotting using eIF-4E-antibody (Fig. 1E). Only one of these bands, slightly more acidic than the major one, could be detected by autoradiography. We therefore conclude that only a small fraction of the total eIF-4E is phosphorylated in vivo. The additional bands to the basic side of the major one may correspond to eIF-4E degradation products, which were routinely observed in preparations of this protein, or to heterogeneity caused by other types of protein modification (compare (31Joshi-Barve S. Rychlik W. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2979-2983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Phosphoamino acid analysis showed that the amino acids phosphorylated in p20 and eIF-4E are in both cases serine residues (Fig. 2A).Figure 2Phosphoamino acid analysis.

The resulting peptides were analyzed using two-dimensional peptide mapping and HPLC. Two-dimensional peptide mapping revealed two major and several weakly labeled phosphopeptides (Fig. 3, WT). The more strongly labeled peptide (peptide 1, Fig. 3) migrates slightly further toward the cathode than the neutral marker ɛ-dinitrophenyl-lysine (dnp-lysine). This behavior would be expected of either a positively charged peptide or, in the case of a neutral peptide, might be explained on the basis of endoosmotic effects(48Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). The second major phosphopeptide (peptide 2, Fig. 3) moves about the same distance as xylene-cyanol toward the anode. This marker has a negative charge at pH 3.5. Other weakly labeled peptides can be seen close to peptide 1. A further peptide migrates close to dnp-lysine (peptide 3, Fig. 3) and is evidently relatively hydrophobic. HPLC analysis of the tryptic peptides derived from in vivo phosphorylated eIF-4E also yielded two major radioactive peaks, plus four weaker ones (Fig. 4), consistent with the data obtained from two-dimensional peptide mapping. Thus, the above analytical methods indicated the existence of at least two major (serine) phosphorylation sites in yeast eIF-4E. We attempted to identify the phosphorylated peptides in the two major fractions via peptide sequencing. However, the low level of labeling combined with the incomplete separation of the peptides prevented us from obtaining unequivocal data, and we turned to an alternative approach. Analysis of the eIF-4E protein sequence reveals the existence of several potential phosphorylation sites in the N-terminal region of the protein. Ser7 is located in a theoretical consensus site for both casein kinase I and protein kinase C-like kinases, while Ser2 lies in a consensus sequence for casein kinase II and Ser15 in a sequence expected to be recognized by both casein kinase I and II (Fig. 6). An initial crude test of phosphorylation in this region was to make use of two N-terminal deletion mutants which have lost two or more of the initial serines in the amino acid sequence. 2S. Vasilescu, M. Ptushkina, P. P. Müller, and J. E. G. McCarthy, manuscript submitted for publication. In vivo labeling was performed using derivatives of 4-2 bearing each of the deletion mutants. Both of these deletion mutant proteins were able to support translation in vivo.2 eIF-4EDel7 was found to be less strongly labeled than the wild-type protein, and tryptic peptide analysis revealed that phosphopeptide 2 was no longer present (Fig. 3, Del7). Phosphorylation of the eIF-4EDel19 mutant, moreover, was hardly detectable (Fig. 1, C and D, and 5). In order to define the phosphoserine residues precisely, we constructed point mutants in which one or more of the N-terminal serines has been mutated to alanine(s). Mutation of Ser7 to Ala (S7A) did not change the labeling pattern observed (Fig. 3, S7A). However, further phosphopeptide mapping analyses of the single mutants S2A and S15A, as well as the double mutant S2+15A, clearly showed that Ser2 and Ser15 are the major phosphorylation sites of eIF-4E in S. cerevisiae grown under the described conditions. The major labeled peptides were removed only in the double mutant S2+15A (Fig. 1, C and D and Fig. 3, S2+15A). Moreover, phosphorylation of the double mutant form of eIF-4E was reduced by more than 80% in vivo (Fig. 5). The remaining spot in the area of peptide 1 observed with the S15A mutant (Fig. 3) was one of the weakly labeled phosphopeptides (see previous section and Fig. 3 and Fig. 4) generated by tryptic digestion with a similar mobility to peptide 1. It is also evident in the map of the double mutant (S2+15A).Figure 5The phosphorylation of eIF-4E in vivo. Mutant derivatives in which serine phosphorylation sites have been eliminated (compare Fig. 3) are compared to wild-type. The measured values of protein and 32P incorporation for wild-type eIF-4E (averages of two independent experiments) were each normalized to 1, and the equivalent data obtained with the three mutants were expressed as fractions of the wild-type values. See Fig. 1 for an explanation of the strain nomenclature. Light shaded, protein; dark shaded, radioactivity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Identification of the two phosphorylated serines at positions 2 and 15 via mutational analysis also provides an explanation of the observed mobilities of the phosphopeptides in two-dimensional mapping (Fig. 3; compare Fig. 6). These mobilities are consistent with the expected cleavage sites of trypsin in the eIF-4E amino acid sequence (compare Ref 48). For example, phosphopeptide 1 could be generated by tryptic cleavage at Lys24 and at either Lys8 (expected net charge +1 at pH 3.5) or at Lys9 (neutral). Phosphopeptide 2, on the other hand, could be generated by cleavage at Lys8 (expected net charge −1). We investigated whether there was a growth phenotype associated with the double mutation in eIF-4E. Expression of the mutant gene in strain 4-2 lacking the wild-type eIF-4E gene allowed growth at a rate reduced by no more than 5% relative to wild-type under standard growth conditions both in YEPD and minimal medium. We also investigated the rates of total protein synthesis in whole cells (measured as [35S]L-methionine incorporation) containing only the S2+15A mutant (data not shown). A decrease of less than 10% compared to the equivalent strain bearing wild-type eIF-4E was detectable during log-phase growth at 30°C or under heat shock conditions (39°C). It might be argued that the described mutations induce changes in the phosphorylation state of eIF-4E via indirect conformational changes. However, this is unlikely for at least three reasons. First, each of the single mutations, S2A and S15A, eliminates the phosphorylation of one specific peptide, and the combination of both mutations results in an additive effect (Fig. 3), whereas S7A has no effect on the phosphorylation pattern. Second, the results obtained with the deletion mutants Del7 and Del19 are fully consistent with the former observations (Fig. 3 and Fig. 5), despite the fact that deletions of this kind would be more likely to induce significant conformational alterations in the overall structure of the protein. Third, the fact that none of the amino acid substitutions have a readily detectable phenotype under log-phase growth conditions indicates that if they do cause conformational changes in the protein these are probably small. The two phosphorylated serines identified lie in potential casein kinase II sites. Casein kinase II was isolated from yeast and used for in vitro phosphorylation reactions. Recombinant wild-type and S2+15A eIF-4E proteins were isolated from E. coli and used as substrates. The mutant was weakly labeled compared to the wild-type protein (Fig. 7A). Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that both proteins were phosphorylated at serine residues (Fig. 2B, R lanes). One of the phosphopeptides (data not shown) generated by tryptic digestion corresponds to the major site of phosphorylation in vivo (peptide 1; see Fig. 3) and is not present in the peptide map of the S2+15A mutant. The other major phosphopeptide observed, which is present in the maps of both proteins, is located at the same position as the weakly labeled peptide obtained from the in vivo phosphorylated protein which is located close to dnp-lysine (see peptide 3, Fig. 3). Unexpectedly, no phosphopeptide derived from wild-type recombinant eIF-4E was observed at the position corresponding to peptide 2. In light of the above discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivo labeling, we isolated cap-binding complexes from yeast cells containing either the wild-type or the S2+15A mutant and phosphorylated the resulting preparations in vitro using casein kinase II. The two major phosphopeptides 1 and 2 observed in the maps prepared from in vivo labeled wild-type eIF-4E could again be observed in the wild-type, but not in the S2+15A mutant (Fig. 8, panels WT and S2+15A). In conclusion, casein kinase II can phosphorylate both Ser2 and Ser15in vitro. The difference in substrate behavior of recombinant eIF-4E from E. coli might be due to an altered conformation relative to that of the natural yeast protein. Alternatively, the association of other yeast proteins, such as p20, with eIF-4E isolated from yeast might influence the accessibility of site 2. The relative strengths of peptides 2 and 3 are reversed in the in vitro and in vivo labeling of yeast eIF-4E (compare Fig. 8 and Fig. 3, WT). Ser2 is evidently poorly phosphorylated in vitro, whereas the third site (peptide 3) seems to be a better substrate. A striking aspect of the in vitro phosphorylation of the cap-binding complex isolated from yeast is that p20 is very rapidly labeled, apparently becoming fully phosphorylated after 5 min of incubation under the conditions described (Fig. 7B). In the process of analyzing the potential sites of phosphorylation in p20, we discovered a discrepancy in the gene sequence compared with that published previously. Our sequencing analysis revealed the existence of an additional A nucleotide in the series of As(370-374) in the published reading frame(51Altmann M. Krieger M. Trachsel H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7520Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The revised reading frame encodes a protein of 161 amino acids and contains two apparent casein kinase II consensus sequences at serines 91 and 154 (Fig. 6). Phosphoamino acid analysis of p20 (Fig. 2), together with peptide mapping of this protein labeled in vivo and in vitro (Fig. 8), indicates that casein kinase II is the major enzyme responsible for p20 phosphorylation in vivo. The in vivo peptide mapping data reveal the existence of at least one major (peptide A), and one minor (peptide B), phosphorylation site in p20. The same major phosphopeptide (A) was also generated by tryptic digestion of p20 that had been phosphorylated by casein kinase II in vitro (Fig. 8). The phosphorylation state of eIF-4E was analyzed under different culture conditions. The amount of 32P-labeled eIF-4E in the isolated cap-binding complex was unaffected by heat shock (Fig. 1, A and B, and 9) or the addition of cycloheximide (data not shown). The level of eIF-4E phosphorylation in the stationary phase appears, at first sight, to have increased. However, this change in the specific labeling intensity was primarily due to the depletion of unlabeled phosphate observed under these conditions. More striking was the observation that the amount of phosphorylated p20 associated with eIF-4E was increased under conditions of heat shock or cycloheximide treatment, whereas reduced amounts were observed in extracts from cells in the stationary phase (Fig. 1, A and B, and 9). The true reduction in the degree of phosphorylation of p20 in stationary phase, for the reason mentioned above, must be significantly greater than that indicated in Fig. 9. We do not know which of the potential phosphorylation sites in p20 is(are) involved in the overall changes in phosphorylation level. The results described in this paper show that eIF-4E and p20 in yeast are at least partially phosphorylated in vivo. The level of phosphorylation of eIF-4E detected was particularly low, with most of this factor being present in the non-phosphorylated form. The pattern of phosphorylation was unexpected. The major positions of phosphorylation of eIF-4E are not protein kinase C sites and are not equivalent to the sites reported to be present in the mammalian counterpart protein. Instead, casein kinase II, a serine/threonine kinase ubiquitously present in eukaryotic cells, has been found to phosphorylate both proteins. This kinase has a wide range of substrates, including proteins linked to the cell-cycle, cell growth, and cell differentiation(52Pinna L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). In yeast, casein kinase II is essential for cell viability, and there is evidence for its involvement in cell-cycle regulation(53Padmanhabha R. Chen-Wu J.L.-P. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4089-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). For example, casein kinase II phosphorylation of yeast topoisomerase II is cell-cycle-dependent(54Cardenas M.E. Dang Q. Glover C.V.C. Gasser S.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1785-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Here, as in yeast eIF-2α(17Feng L. Yoon H. Donahue T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5139-5153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18van den Heuvel J. Lang V. Richter G. Price N. Peacock L. Proud C. McCarthy J.E.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the phosphorylation sites are close to the C terminus of the protein. The main casein kinase II phosphorylation sites of yeast eIF-4E are close to the N terminus, and one of the p20 sites is predicted to be close to the C terminus (Fig. 6). Mutation of the two major phosphorylation sites in eIF-4E results in only a minimal phenotype in yeast under standard growth conditions. Indeed, yeast can survive with an eIF-4E protein that has no detectable phosphorylation (see Fig. 5). In this context, it is significant that the mutation of Ser209 to Ala in mammalian eIF-4E has no effect on this factor's association with the 48 S initiation complex(33Joshi B. Cai A.-L. Keiper B.D.

However, as with eIF-2α(17Feng L. Yoon H. Donahue T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5139-5153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our data do not rule out that there are conditions under which such sites are functionally important. Of at least equal importance is the observed variation in binding of phosphorylated p20 to eIF-4E, which will need to be investigated in considerable detail. In conclusion, this study establishes the necessity to reassess the pathway and regulation of phosphorylation of yeast (and possibly mammalian) eIF-4E. Indeed, the variations in the amount of phosphorylated p20 we have described suggest that the possible involvement of other proteins that interact with eIF-4E may play important regulatory roles in translational initiation. We see here a potential parallel to the recently described regulatory system for mammalian eIF-4E. The binding of PHAS-I to mammalian eIF-4E is regulated via phosphorylation of Ser64 in the regulatory protein by mitogen-activated kinase(50Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donze O. Lin T.-A.

On the basis of our new data on the yeast cap-binding proteins, future work will need to explore analogous paths for potential regulatory mechanisms in this lower eukaryote.

Studies on proto-oncoproteins have focused on their roles in the G0/G1 transition or in traversal of G1. A number of proto-oncoproteins, notably c-Src, c-Abl, and c-Mos, have previously been shown to undergo hyperphosphorylation and modulation of activity in mitosis and/or M-phase(5Shalloway D. Shenoy S. Adv. Cancer Res. 1991; 57: 185-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 6Wang J.Y.J. Trends Biochem.

Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 25 mM NaF). Immunoprecipitations were performed as described (8Morrison D.K. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 9Fabian J.R. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7170-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) using an anti-Raf-1 monoclonal antibody (Transduction Labs R19120). Whole cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis using the same anti-Raf-1 monoclonal antibody except for Fig. 2C, where a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the 14 C-terminal residues of Raf-1 (a gift from D. Morrison) was used. Bands were visualized using the Renaissance chemiluminescence reagent (DuPont NEN). NIH 3T3 cells were infected as described (10Danos O. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6460-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) with the retroviral construct pLJ/Raf (a gift from D. Morrison) or the control construct pLJ. Infected cells were grown in mass culture under G418 selection (400 μg/ml) for 2 weeks prior to experiments being performed. Raf-1 immunoprecipitations and kinase assays were performed exactly as described(8Morrison D.K. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 9Fabian J.R. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7170-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Histidine-tagged kinase-defective MEK-1 was bacterially expressed (11Gardner A.M. Lange-Carter C. Vaillancourt R.R. Johnson G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 258-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and employed as an exogenous substrate (approximately 500 ng/reaction). 32P bands were quantitated using a Betagen model 603 betascope. We have observed that Raf-1 immunoprecipitated from nocodazole-arrested mitotic NIH 3T3 cells migrates more slowly (74-78 kDa) in SDS-PAGE than Raf-1 from unsynchronized growing cells (72-74 kDa; Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2). Following potato-acid phosphatase treatment this mobility retardation was virtually eliminated, demonstrating that it stems from hyperphosphorylation (lanes 3 and 4). Pretreatment of potato-acid phosphatase with a mixture of phosphatase inhibitors (sodium fluoride and sodium vanadate) inhibited this effect (data not shown). To further study alterations of Raf-1 in mitosis we used the retroviral expression vector pLJ/Raf-1 to generate NIH 3T3 cell lines (designated NIH(pLJ/Raf-1)) that stably overexpress human Raf-1. NIH(pLJ) cell lines that were infected with the empty vector pLJ were used as controls. Direct comparisons with both the endogenous and overexpressed Raf-1 showed that the mitotic reduction in electrophoretic mobility was similar to that observed following 5 min of stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (Fig. 2A, cf. lanes 3 and 2 and lanes 7 and 6). Multiple mobility-retarded Raf-1 bands were observed in both PDGF-treated and mitotic cells, but more highly retarded bands were more abundant in mitotic Raf-1. Raf-1 retardation increased following longer treatment with PDGF but never to the extent observed with Raf-1 from mitotic cells (data not shown). NIH(pLJ/Raf-1) mitotic and unsynchronized cell cultures were metabolically labeled with inorganic 32PO4, and immunoprecipitated Raf-1 was analyzed by phosphoamino acid analysis (Fig. 2B). Raf-1 isolated from both mitotic and unsynchronized cells was radiolabeled predominantly on serine residues, but low levels of threonine phosphorylation were also detected. This is similar to results observed following PDGF stimulation of NIH 3T3 cells (12Morrison D.K. Heideker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the duration of Raf-1 hyperphosphorylation in mitosis, NIH(pLJ/Raf-1) cells were arrested in mitosis using nocodazole, replated in drug-free medum, and harvested at different intervals (Fig. 2C). The mitotic mobility retardation of Raf-1 was partially lost by 1 h after replating (lane 4) and was negligible by 2 h (lane 5). Since the cells undergo cytokinesis 30-45 min after release from nocodazole arrest(13Chackalaparampil I. Shalloway D. Cell. 1988; 52: 801-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), it appears that Raf-1 hyperphosphorylation extends into the early G1 phase of the cell cycle. This contrasts with the case of c-Src, where Cdc2-catalyzed hyperphosphorylations disappear within 30 min after replating (data not shown and (13Chackalaparampil I. Shalloway D. Cell. 1988; 52: 801-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar)). Similar results for Raf-1 were obtained using HeLa cells. 2S. Taylor and D. Shalloway, unpublished observations. Two different assays were used to determine if Raf-1 kinase activity is stimulated during mitosis: 1) an autokinase assay and 2) phosphorylation of a relevant physiological substrate, i.e. purified recombinant MEK-1. Autophosphorylation was assayed using Raf-1 immunoprecipitated from quiescent (serum-starved), PDGF-stimulated, mitotic, and unsynchronized NIH(pLJ/Raf-1) cells (Fig. 3A). As anticipated(3Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Rapp U. Roberts T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8855-8859Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), Raf-1 immunoprecipitated from quiescent (lane 1) or unsynchronized (lane 4) cultures exhibited negligible autokinase activity. Importantly, autokinase activity was stimulated in mitotic cells to a level comparable with that observed following PDGF treatment (cf. lanes 3 and 2). Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that both PDGF-stimulated and mitotic Raf-1 were autophosphorylated on both serine and threonine (Fig. 3B). The MEK kinase activity of Raf-1 was also stimulated in mitotic cells (Fig. 3C). The activity of Raf-1 from mitotic cells was 10 ×/¸ 2 (n = 4) times higher than the activity of Raf-1 from unsynchronized cells. The level of mitotic activity was very similar to that observed following PDGF stimulation (data not shown). Definitive investigation of the role of the mitotic hyperphosphorylation of Raf-1 in its activation must await mapping and mutation of the mitotic phosphorylation sites. To ensure that Raf-1 hyperphosphorylation and activation were not drug-induced artifacts, we performed similar experiments using mitotic cells collected by mechanical shake-off alone (Fig. 3D). Western blots of immunoprecipitates revealed that Raf-1 mobility was retarded, although to a lesser extent than that of Raf-1 isolated from nocodazole-treated cells (Fig. 3D, lower panel). Similarly, Raf-1 kinase activity was stimulated about 3-fold in mitotic cells isolated by shake-off alone (Fig. 3D, upper panel, lane 6) compared with Raf-1 in immunoprecipitates from the adherent monolayer remaining following shake-off (lane 5) or from unsynchronized cells (lane 7). This stimulation was somewhat less than that observed in nocodazole-treated cultures (lane 8), but for reasons discussed elsewhere (13Chackalaparampil I. Shalloway D. Cell. 1988; 52: 801-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) we believe that this merely reflects heterogeneity of the shake-off population and conclude that the observed mitotic hyperphosphorylation and stimulation of Raf-1 kinase activity are authentic. We cannot exclude the possibility that the observed enhancement of Raf-1 kinase activity comes from the mitosis-specific association or activation of another serine/threonine kinase that coprecipitates with Raf-1. We believe this is unlikely since 1) MEK-1 appears to be a target for a very restricted set of kinases (1Avruch J. Zhang X.-F. Kyriakis J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 279-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) and 2) the lysis buffer contains 0.1% SDS and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, which should disassociate any such activity from Raf-1 prior to Raf-1 immunoprecipitation(8Morrison D.K. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In any case, if such an association/activation occurs, it is specific to mitosis and would therefore itself be of great interest. Raf-1 activity is already known to participate in the G0/G1 transition. The data presented here suggest that it may also function in the transition into or passage through mitosis. A reduction in the electrophoretic mobility of Raf-1 in mitotic murine fibroblasts has been previously reported, but no changes in Raf-1 activity were described(14Mamon H. Williams N. Wood K. Frazier A.L. Li P. Zmuidzinas A. Kremer N. D'Acangelo G. Qi H. Smith K. Feig L. Piwnica-Worms H. Halegona S. Roberts T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1991; 56: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In future experiments it will be important to determine 1) if Raf-1 is first activated before or during mitosis, 2) if the mechanism of its mitotic activation is related to the mechanism employed following GF stimulation (i.e. via Ras(2Hall A. Science. 1994; 264: 1413-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar)), and 3) its mitotic targets. Interestingly, there is already evidence indicating that a Raf-1-mediated pathway(s) participates in entry into meiosis. For example, activated GF receptor tyrosine kinases stimulate Xenopus meiotic maturation in a Raf-1-dependent manner(15Fabian J.R. Morrison D.K. Daar I.O. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and progesterone-initiated maturation is partially Raf-1-dependent(15Fabian J.R. Morrison D.K. Daar I.O. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 16Muslin A.J. MacNicol A.M. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4197-4202Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ERK1 (which lies downstream from Raf-1) regulates a meiotic checkpoint in Xenopus(17Minshull J. Sun H. Tonks N.K. Murray A.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 475-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). There are also hints that Raf-1-mediated pathways may regulate mitosis. For example, Ras can regulate mitosis in Xenopus embryos and mammalian cells (18Daar I. Nebreda A.R. Yew N. Sass P. Paules R. Santos E. Wigler M. Vande Woude G.F. Science. 1991; 253: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Noble M. Land H. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1635-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and MAPKs can regulate early embryonic cleavage in Xenopus(17Minshull J. Sun H. Tonks N.K. Murray A.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 475-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 20Haccard O. Sarcevic B. Lewellyn A. Hartley R. Roy L. Izumi T. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In addition, 14-3-3 proteins, which may stabilize the Raf-1-activated state(21Morrison D. Science. 1994; 266: 56-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), influence the timing of mitotic entry in fission yeast (22Ford J.C. Al-Khodairy F. Fobou E. Sheldrick K.S. Griffiths D.J.F. Carr A.M. Science. 1994; 265: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). MEK-1 is the most obvious potential target for Raf-1 during mitosis. Raf-1-catalyzed phosphorylation and activation of MEK-1 could explain the activation of MAPKs that occurs just before or during mitosis in mammalian cells(23Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T. Kazuyuki T. Ueki K. Izumi T. Chatani Y. Kohuo M. Kasuga M. Yazaki Y. Akanuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20293-20297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Heider H. Hug C. Lucocq J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, Raf-1 might phosphorylate and modulate other targets such as IkB or p53(25Li S. Sedivy J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9247-9251Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 26Jamal S. Ziff E.B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2095-2101PubMed Google Scholar). The latter possibility is of particular interest because p53 may help regulate the G2/M transition(27Cross S.M. Sanchez C.A. Morgan C.A. Schimke M.K. Ramel S. Idzerda R.L. Raskind W.H. Reid B.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1353-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 28Stewart N. Hicks G.G. Paraskevas F. Mowat M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 109-115PubMed Google Scholar). The recent finding that Raf-1 phosphorylates and activates Cdc25A, an activator of cyclin-dependent kinases, during cell cycle activation further indicates that it may play a significant role in cell cycle regulation(29Galaktionov K. Jessus C. Beach D. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1046-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We do not yet know if the mitotic hyperphosphorylation of Raf-1 is a cause or effect of its activation. It will be important to test the possibility that Src (or other tyrosine kinases) plays a role in the mitotic activation of Raf-1. Microinjection of anti-Ras inhibitory antibodies reverts the transformed phenotypes of v-Src-transformed cells, demonstrating that v-Src acts upstream of the Ras/Raf-1 pathway (30Smith M.R. DeGudicibus S.J. Stacy D.W. Nature. 1986; 320: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Moreover, oncogenic Src can activate Raf-1 in insect and mammalian cells(9Fabian J.R. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7170-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 31Williams N.G. Roberts T.M. Li P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We did not detect increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 during mitosis (Fig. 2B). However, it should be noted that enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation is confined to a small fraction of Raf-1 molecules following activation by coexpression with oncogenic Ras and Src in mammalian cells, even though tyrosine phosphorylation has been implicated in Raf-1 activation in this situation(32Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). In vivo mitotic hyperphosphorylation was observed overwhelmingly at serine (Fig. 2B) while Raf-1 autophosphorylates in vitro at both serine and threonine (Fig. 3B and (31Williams N.G. Roberts T.M. Li P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2922-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and (33Izumi T. Tamemoto H. Nagao M. Kadowaki T. Takaku F. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7933-7939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). MAPKs are probably responsible for at least some of the Raf-1 hyperphosphorylation seen in GF-stimulated cells (34Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and might therefore also contribute to Raf-1 mitotic hyperphosphorylation in a feedback loop. The results presented here indicate that Raf-1 must be added to the list of proto-oncoproteins whose activities become modulated in mitosis and suggest that deregulated Raf-1 activity could perturb control mechanisms at multiple points in the cell cycle.

https://openalex.org/W2031685274,"We have previously shown that replacement of His-226 in the NhaA Na+/H+ antiporter of Escherichia coli to Arg (H226R) shifts the pH profile of the antiporter toward acidic pH and as a result a ΔnhaAΔnhaB strain bearing this mutation is Na+ sensitive at alkaline pH (Gerchman, Y., Olami, Y., Rimon, A., Taglicht, D., Schuldiner, S. and Padan, E.(1993) Proc.

The Na+ sensitivity of the ΔnhaAΔnhaB mutant bearing the H226R-NhaA plasmid at alkaline pH provided a very powerful tool to isolate revertants and suppressants of H226R growing on high Na+ at alkaline pH. With this approach cysteine (H226C) and serine (H226S) replacements were found to efficiently replace His-226 and yield an antiporter, which like the wild-type protein, is activated by pH between pH 7 and 8. These results imply that polarity and/or hydrogen bonding, the common properties shared by these amino acid residues, are essential at position 226 for pH regulation of NhaA.This suggestion was substantiated by site-directed mutagenesis of His-226 either to alanine (H226A) or aspartate (H226D). Whereas H226A-NhaA shows very low activity which is not activated by pH, H226D-NhaA is active and regulated by pH. The pH profile of H226D is shifted by half a pH unit toward alkaline pH, as opposed to the previously isolated mutant H226R which has a pH profile shift, to the same extent, but toward acidic pH.

https://openalex.org/W2093139459,"Dynamin is a GTP-binding protein that is involved in the release of coated endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane. We have been characterizing the enzymatic properties of purified rat brain dynamin to better understand how GTP binding and hydrolysis relate to its proposed function. Previously, we have demonstrated that activation of dynamin GTPase results from positive cooperative associations between dynamin molecules as they are bound to a polymeric surface. Our present report has extended these studies and has examined the structural features of dynamin self-association. After treatment with the zero-length protein cross-linking reagent, 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide, dynamin in solution was found cross-linked into dimers. This homodimer likely reflects the native soluble state of the molecule. After binding to brain vesicles, dynamin was cross-linked into higher order oligomers of greater than 800 kDa. Dynamin, copurified on brain membranous organelles, also formed multimeric complexes when cross-linked suggesting dynamin exists in polymeric form in vivo. No cross-linked species other than homo-oligomers were observed, providing no evidence for close interactions between dynamin and membrane proteins. From experiments examining the effects of GTP, GDP, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate, and 5′-guanylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate on cross-linking, we have determined that both dynamin membrane binding and self-association occur independently from the nucleotide-bound state of the enzyme. An 80-kDa dynamin fragment that is lacking its carboxyl-terminal domain is not cross-linked into higher order oligomers, suggesting that this domain is required for binding of dynamin to membranes and the subsequent enhancement of oligomerization. However, the dynamin fragment was found to form dimers indicating that this domain is not required for dynamin dimerization. Cross-linked dynamin was able to cooperatively bind microtubules, but did not exhibit GTPase activation. We propose that intramolecular cross-links in the dynamin monomer impart structural constraints that prevent the enhancement of GTP hydrolysis.

We describe a model of the dynamin activation process to be considered in further investigations of the role for dynamin in endocytic vesicle formation. Dynamin is a GTP-binding protein that functions in the early stages of endocytosis. In particular, it is thought to be required for endocytic coated vesicle formation and budding. Recent reports have suggested that dynamin participates in this process by catalyzing a GTP-dependent fission reaction at the necks of invaginated coated pits that results in the release of coated vesicles from the plasma membrane(1Takei K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 2Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Mutational analyses of the dynamin GTP-binding site have indicated that GTPase activity is required for in vivo function(2Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 3van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.M. Schmid S.L. J.

However, it is not clear how dynamin's enzymatic properties are related to its proposed activity in endocytic vesicle formation. We have been investigating the enzymatic properties of purified rat brain dynamin in order to define parameters affecting GTP hydrolysis. Our goal is to identify and characterize the agents which function as physiological regulators of dynamin activity. Dynamin GTP hydrolysis rates are accelerated when in the presence of a diverse set of agents including microtubules(5Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B.

Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11468-11472Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Dynamin associates with each of these agents via its 100-amino acid carboxyl-terminal domain(6Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Herskovits J.S. Shpetner H.S. Burgess C.C. Vallee R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11468-11472Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, binding of rat brain dynamin to acidic phospholipids or microtubules does not stimulate GTPase activity directly. Rather, binding these agents promotes cooperative associations between dynamin molecules leading to activation of GTP hydrolysis(9Tuma P.L. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30842-30847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Warnock D.E. Terlecky L.J. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We have determined that at least two dynamin molecules, each of which is a homodimer, must self-associate for optimal GTPase activity to occur(9Tuma P.L. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30842-30847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each of the activating agents listed above provide a multivalent surface to which dynamin binds that promotes cooperative associations between dynamin molecules. It is not clear with which agents (if any) dynamin associates in vivo. Although dynamin is routinely purified from brain preparations by exploiting its affinity for microtubules(6Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. Cell. 1989; 59: 421-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), dynamin has not been shown to colocalize with microtubules in the cell. Instead, biochemical and immunolocalization studies have indicated dynamin plasma membrane associations(2Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 3van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.M. Schmid S.L. J.

Whether dynamin binds the membrane directly through interactions with acidic phospholipids or binding is mediated by other proteins (SH3-domain or clathrin coat proteins?) is not known. To further complicate our understanding of the regulation of the dynamin GTP hydrolytic cycle, it has been demonstrated that activation of dynamin in the presence of acidic phospholipids, rat brain vesicles, microtubules, or Grb2 does not display Michaelis-Menten kinetics(6Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Herskovits J.S. Shpetner H.S. Burgess C.C. Vallee R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11468-11472Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Although positive cooperative interactions between dynamin molecules result in optimal activation, it is not known what features of dynamin's interactions with itself or with the binding substrates accounts for the non-classical behavior observed. It is also highly likely that additional regulatory aspects of dynamin function remain to be identified. In this study we have further defined properties of dynamin GTP binding and hydrolysis. In particular, we have examined dynamin self-association in the presence and absence of activating agents and have determined that dynamin is self-associated when bound to membranous organelles. We have found that dynamin membrane binding and cooperative associations occur independently from nucleotide binding. We have also examined dynamin intra- and intermolecular interactions that are important in the stimulation of dynamin GTPase. We provide a structural model that describes the features of the activation process that must be strongly considered as we continue our investigation of the role dynamin GTP hydrolysis plays in endocytosis. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) between 150 and 250 g were used as the source of brain tissue.

(lithium salt), GTPγS, GMPPNP, GDP (sodium salt), chymotrypsin, 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide (EDC), and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies were all purchased from Sigma. Nucleotides were prepared as either 10 mM (GTPγS, GMPPNP, GDP) or 100 mM (GTP, AMPPNP) stocks with equimolar MgSO4. Lipids were purchased from Sigma or Avanti Polar Lipids. Reagents for gel electrophoresis were from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA) and Bio-Rad. Taxol was kindly provided by the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Division of Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, and stored as a 10 mM stock in dimethyl sulfoxide at −80°C. 5′ adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate guanosine 5′3-O-(thio)triphosphate 5′ -guanylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. Dynamin was purified from rat brain by coassembly with microtubules in extraction buffer (50 mM Hepes, 50 mM Pipes, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.0) followed by elution with GTP and AMPPNP as described(6Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dynamin was further purified by fractionation on a 5-20% linear sucrose gradient(6Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 80-kDa dynamin fragment was produced by a fortuitous proteolytic event that occurs occasionally during routine purification of the intact polypeptide(6Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tubulin was purified by reversible assembly of microtubules from calf brain cytosolic extracts followed by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography(14Vallee R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134 (89-87)Google Scholar). Tubulin was polymerized by the addition of equimolar taxol and incubation for 5 min at 37°C(15Vallee R.B. Collins C.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The microtubules were diluted in extraction buffer to the desired concentration for use in the assays. A crude coated vesicle preparation was isolated from rat brain as described(6Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 4-5 g of rat brain were homogenized in an equal volume of extraction buffer and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 138,000 × g for 1 h and the resultant vesicle pellet was either used directly or extracted for 30 min on ice with 1 M KI in extraction buffer. The extracted membrane preparation was recovered by centrifugation at 138,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was removed and the membrane pellet was washed once in extraction buffer by recentrifugation. All steps were performed at 4°C. The membrane preparations were assayed for protein content and diluted in extraction buffer to the desired concentrations for use in the assays. Liposomes (25% phosphatidylserine:75% phosphatidylcholine, w/w) were prepared as described(6Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lipid mixture was dried from chloroform and residual solvent was removed in vacuo. The lipids were resuspended in extraction buffer to the desired concentration and the mixture was sonicated with a probe sonicator until clear. Assays were performed in a 100-μl total volume at 37°C for 15 min(9Tuma P.L. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30842-30847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of dynamin and added agents were as indicated in the figure legends. Assay mixtures were incubated for 10 min at room temperature prior to the initiation of the reaction by addition of GTP. GTPase activity was assayed by monitoring 32P release from 0.5 mM [γ-32P]GTP (Amersham Corp.) according to Collins and Vallee(16Collins C.A. Vallee R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4799-4803Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Nine volumes of dynamin in the absence or presence of lipid vesicles were incubated with 1 volume of EDC at room temperature. Concentrations of the reagents and times of cross-linking are as indicated in the figure legends. The cross-linking reactions were stopped by the addition of a 2-fold molar excess of 2-mercaptoethanol over EDC(17Shimizu T. Marchese-Ragona S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochem. 1989; 28: 7016-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to gel electrophoresis, were used directly in GTPase or microtubule binding assays or were treated with chymotrypsin for protease sensitivity assays. The addition of 2-mercaptoethanol slightly inhibited dynamin GTP hydrolysis rates reflected in lowered maximal activity levels of dynamin when treated with EDC for 0 min. EDC-cross-linked dynamin (100 nM) was incubated in the presence or absence of 0.3 mg/ml microtubules for 10 min at room temperature. Assay volumes were corrected to 100 μl with extraction buffer. The mixtures were centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 37°C. The resultant microtubule pellet was resuspended to volume with extraction buffer and both the supernatant and pellet samples were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer in preparation for gel electrophoresis. Dynamin (40 nM) in the presence or absence of lipid vesicles, or EDC-cross-linked dynamin, was incubated with 0.25 μg/ml chymotrypsin at room temperature for 60 min. Digests were stopped by the addition of 5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and further diluted in Laemmli sample buffer for gel electrophoresis. EDC-cross-linked dynamin (45 nM) was incubated with 0.05 mg/ml microtubules for 10 min at room temperature. The mixtures were adsorbed onto carbon-coated Formvar grids for 2 min followed by fixation with 0.5% glutaraldehyde and staining with 1% uranyl acetate. Grids were examined using a JEOL (Peabody, MA) JEM 100CX transmission electron microscope. Gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar) and gels were silver stained as described(19Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2501) Google Scholar). Immunoblot reactivity to anti-dynamin polyclonal antibodies that are specific to the carboxyl-terminal domain (6Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was measured with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies using nitro blue tetrazolium and bromochloroindolyl phosphate as substrate(20Collins C.A. Vallee R.B. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 14: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Protein content was determined using BCA Reagent (Pierce) or densitometric analysis of Coomassie Blue-stained gels with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Our previous enzymatic analysis of purified dynamin revealed cooperativity in the activation of GTP hydrolysis rates(9Tuma P.L. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30842-30847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We chose to examine the self-association of dynamin by more structural means to extend these results in order to better understand how these properties relate to GTP binding and hydrolysis. For this purpose, we developed a protein cross-linking strategy to examine dynamin self-association properties in vitro. We chose the zero-length cross-linking reagent, EDC, as it will covalently cross-link peptides that are immediately adjacent, i.e. those dynamin molecules that are self-associated. Rat brain vesicles, salt extracted to remove peripheral proteins, were used as the dynamin binding surface, as we have characterized them as stimulators of dynamin GTPase, and they may well represent the in vivo binding site(6Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dynamin binding to these vesicles likely occurs through interactions with acidic phospholipids(6Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified rat brain dynamin was treated with 10 mM EDC for time periods of up to 1 h in the presence or absence of brain vesicles (10 μg of protein/ml), conditions that provide optimal activation of dynamin GTPase activity(6Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2-mercaptoethanol. The extent of cross-linking was monitored on Western blots by the appearance of dynamin immunoreactive species with observed electrophoretic mobilities greater than 100 kDa, the molecular weight of the dynamin monomer. The extent of dynamin self-association in solution, in the absence of lipid vesicles, was limited (Fig. 1). Within 5 min of EDC treatment, dynamin dimers (200-kDa immunoreactive species) were formed and, after 60 min, were the prominent oligomers detected. Higher order cross-linked species were also observed, but only after 30-60 min of EDC treatment and in much lower amounts (Fig. 1). In the presence of brain vesicles, the extent of dynamin oligomerization was enhanced (Fig. 1). As was observed for dynamin in the absence of brain vesicles, dimers were the prominent cross-linked species detected after 5 min of EDC treatment. However, the formation of dynamin multimeric complexes was greatly accelerated. Within 15 min of EDC treatment, species of 300 and 400 kDa were detected, and by 60 min, nearly all dynamin was detected in complexes of more than 400 kDa. Examination of these complexes on high resolving phosphate gels revealed cross-linked dynamin complexes in multiples of 100 kDa, up to greater than 800 kDa (data not shown). The extent of dynamin oligomerization was calculated and the relative levels of dynamin remaining as a monomer are indicated (Fig. 1). By 60 min, nearly twice the amount of dynamin in the absence of vesicles remained as a monomer as compared to dynamin cross-linked in the presence of vesicles (63 and 33%, respectively). Of the dynamin that was cross-linked, the relative amounts of dimers, trimers, and tetramers were determined for each time point (Fig. 2). In the absence of vesicles, dimers were the prominent oligomer observed and dimer formation was approximately linear with time (Fig. 2A). After 60 min of EDC treatment, 73% of the cross-linked dynamin was present as a dimer. For dynamin cross-linked in the presence of vesicles (Fig. 2B), dynamin dimers, trimers, and tetramers were present within 5 min of EDC treatment and dimers were observed to be the prominent species formed. Decreases in dimer and trimer formation were observed with time as increases in higher order oligomer formation occurred. After 60 min of treatment, only 13% of the cross-linked dynamin remained as a dimer. These results provide evidence that dynamin forms higher order oligomers when bound to multivalent activating surfaces. These data also support the conclusions drawn from our earlier analysis of dynamin enzymatic behavior that indicated dynamin self-association is favored when bound to polymeric surfaces, and that this self-association is required for maximal GTPase activity levels(9Tuma P.L. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30842-30847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although dynamin has been shown to self-associate in vitro in the absence of polymeric substrates, supra-physiological concentrations were used (21Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). We found some higher order oligomer formation of dynamin in solution, but we suggest that dynamin self-association either requires or is greatly enhanced upon interaction with its in vivo binding site. The prevalence of dynamin dimer formation, both in the absence and presence of vesicles, indicates that this is the minimal dynamin multimer and represents the native form of dynamin. This result agrees with size estimations obtained from sucrose density gradient sedimentation values(22Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 111: 291aGoogle Scholar), gel permeation chromatography(23Maeda K. Nakata T. Noda Y. Sato-Yoshitake R. Hirokawa N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and electron microscopic observations(11Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. Cell. 1989; 59: 421-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 23Maeda K. Nakata T. Noda Y. Sato-Yoshitake R. Hirokawa N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, recent reports have suggested that dynamin exists in its native form as a tetramer (21Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Data for these reports were obtained using significantly higher dynamin concentrations which may have promoted some self-association. Dynamin associates with each of its “activating” agents through its carboxyl-terminal domain(6Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Herskovits J.S. Shpetner H.S. Burgess C.C. Vallee R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11468-11472Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We investigated whether this domain was also involved in dynamin self-association. For these experiments, we examined the oligomerization properties of an 80-kDa dynamin proteolytic fragment that we have previously characterized as lacking its carboxyl-terminal domain(6Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified 80-kDa dynamin was incubated with EDC in the presence or absence of salt-stripped brain vesicles (10 μg of protein/ml) and the extent of oligomerization was determined (Table 1). In the absence or presence of vesicles, only 32 and 29% of the truncated dynamin was cross-linked, respectively. Unlike intact dynamin, oligomerization of the fragment was not enhanced in the presence of vesicles, but rather closely approximated values obtained for intact dynamin in the absence of vesicles (37%, see Table 1). In fact, only dimer formation was observed for experiments involving the 80-kDa fragment. These results support the conclusion that the dynamin carboxyl-terminal domain is not involved in dynamin dimer formation (6Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but indicates that higher order oligomers of truncated dynamin do not form in solution. In the presence of vesicles, the carboxyl-terminal domain appears to be required for binding of dynamin to vesicles and the subsequent enhancement of oligomerization.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab We wished to determine whether dynamin exists in a multimeric state in vivo. We have previously shown that dynamin peripherally associates with a clathrin-coated vesicle preparation isolated from rat brain(6Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether dynamin was self-associated when bound to vesicles in this preparation, the isolated membrane pellet was treated with 10 mM EDC and processed for Western blot analysis with anti-dynamin polyclonal antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3, treatment of the membrane pellet (high speed pellet) with EDC resulted in the formation of dynamin multimeric complexes. By 30 min of EDC treatment, nearly all the membrane-associated dynamin was cross-linked into higher order species and complexes of greater than 800 kDa. For comparison, purified dynamin that was cross-linked in the presence of salt-stripped vesicles is also shown (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the observed molecular weights of the cross-linked species for both conditions were identical and in multiples of 100 kDa, suggesting that dynamin may be binding the lipids directly or that dynamin binding to a membrane receptor protein is substoichiometric and therefore, not detectable. Alternatively, dynamin-receptor cross-link formation may not be favored under these conditions. These results indicate that dynamin is self-associated when bound to membranous organelles in vivo. Dynamin belongs to a novel family of GTP-binding proteins whose members include the vertebrate Mx proteins (for review, see (24Collins C.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1991; 1: 57-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar)). Isolated Mx1 from rat liver and bacterially expressed Mx1 proteins have been shown to self-associate in vitro and this self-association is enhanced in the presence of 1 mM GTP(25Nakayama M. Yazaki K. Kusano A. Nagata K. Hanai N. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15033-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the effects of GTP on oligomerization, dynamin was treated with 10 mM EDC in the presence of 1 mM Mg2+-GTP. As shown in Fig. 4, the rate of dynamin oligomerization was not altered by the addition of GTP. In the presence and absence of GTP, 25 and 26% dynamin were cross-linked into higher order complexes after 1 h, respectively. These results indicate that, unlike Mx1, dynamin self-association in solution is not enhanced in the presence of GTP. The addition of 1 mM GTP had no effect on dynamin self-association in the presence of lipid vesicles. As shown in Fig. 4, neither the rate of dynamin polymeric complex formation nor the extent of cross-linking after 60 min were altered by the addition of GTP. After 60 min of EDC treatment, 49% of dynamin in the absence of GTP was present"

Here we reveal that induction of this quiescent growth state with the Ca2+ pump blocker, thapsigargin, is correlated with the appearance of a novel caffeine-activated Ca2+ influx mechanism. Ca2+ influx through this mechanism is clearly distinct from and additive with Ca2+ entry through store-operated channels (SOCs). Whereas SOC-mediated entry is activated seconds after Ca2+ pool release, caffeine-sensitive influx requires at least 30 min of pool emptying. Although activated in the 1-10 mM caffeine range, this mechanism has clearly distinct methylxanthine specificity from ryanodine receptors and is not modified by ryanodine. It is also unaffected by the Ca2+ channel blockers SKF96365 or verapamil and is independent of modifiers of cyclic nucleotide levels. Growth arrest by thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ pool depletion can be reversed by treatment with 20% serum (Waldron, R. T., Short, A. D., Meadows, J. J., Ghosh, T. K., and Gill, D. L.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 11927-11933). The serum-induced return of functional Ca2+ pools and reentry of cells into the cell cycle correlates exactly with the disappearance of the caffeine-sensitive Ca2+ influx mechanism. Therefore, appearance and function of this novel Ca2+ entry mechanism are closely tied to Ca2+ pool function and cell growth state and may provide an important means for modifying exit from or entry into the cell cycle.

We have synthesized a series of bivalent consolidated ligands, which interact simultaneously with the SH2 and SH3 domain of Abelson kinase in a SH(32) dual domain construct, a portion of native Abelson kinase. Affinities were measured by quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Consolidated ligands have enhanced affinity and specificity compared to monovalent equivalents. Affinity is also dependent on the length of the linker joining the two parts, with an optimum distance similar to that expected from structural models of Abl (SH(32). These results suggest that consolidated ligands may be generally useful reagents for probing structural and functional activities of multidomain proteins.

Detailed understanding of the pathways involving these domains is complicated by the substantial range of individual specificities in SH2 and SH3 domains, and their combination into large proteins that can form multiple homo- and heteromolecular associations. The reductionist approach of studying individual domains has been very successful(1Kuriyan J. Cowburn D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 828-837Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 2Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar, 3Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the interactions between the domains are still poorly understood. These interactions are likely to be of significance in explaining more fully the complete activities of the signal-transducing complexes. A detailed structural picture of the inter- and intramolecular organization of the domains is then a significant objective. Several cases of multiple SH2 and SH3 domain-containing constructs have been studied structurally (Lck SH(32) ((4Eck M.J. Atwell S.K. Shoelson S.E. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 764-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), Grb2 SH(323) (5Maignan S. Guilloteau J.-P. Becquart J. Ducruix A. Science. 1995; 268: 291-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and Abl SH(32) (6Gosser Y.Q. Zheng J. Overduin M. Mayer B.J. Cowburn D. Structure. 1995; 3: 1075-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)), but there are technical limitations to current structural approaches. In the crystalline state, packing forces may be of the same magnitude as the weak interdomain forces, so there are limits to the interpretation of diffraction studies. Solution studies by NMR are only applicable in a molecular mass range less than ~30 kDa. For NMR, time-averaged NOE constraints in rapidly exchanging conformations are not readily interpretable. As a complement to direct structural methods, we propose the investigation of such multidomain complexes using “consolidated” ligands. These ligands, having multiple binding portions, may be expected to bind with high affinity and specificity when a linker between the two affine segments is of the correct length, and there is little affinity of the linker itself. The consolidated ligands do not necessarily resemble any natural ligand. Such ligands are demonstrated here, binding to the SH(32) of Abelson kinase. It is reasonable to assume that consolidated ligands for dual SH2, dual SH3, or multiple combinations with other ligands can be produced using a similar approach. Src homology N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl N,N-dimethylformamide 1-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohexylidene)ethyl t-butoxycarbonyl benzotriazol-1-yloxytris (dimethylamino) phosphonium 1-hydroxybenzotriazole N-methylmorpholine N,N-diisopropylethylamine polyethylene glycol-polystyrene graft support peptide amide linker, i.e. 5-(4-(9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl)aminomethyl-3,5-dimethoxyphenoxy)valeric acid. The proposed consolidated ligands are similar in concept to affinity reagents, with the modification that the second functionality is a binding element rather than a reactive moiety. Consolidated ligands may also be useful reagents for studies of the cell biology of the signal transduction complexes (for example, in additional combination with antibodies or reporter groups like fluorescent tags), and may provide leads into possible classes of diagnostic and therapeutic agents in the many areas of pathology in which SH domains are involved. This approach will be useful where micromolar affinities of ligands to single SH domains provide insufficient affinity, and hence specificity, for pharmacological action (e.g.(7Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Kohl N.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 175-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) and (8Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar)). The protein target for this study is the regulatory apparatus, SH(32) (4Eck M.J. Atwell S.K. Shoelson S.E. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 764-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), of human Abelson kinase (Abl). Abl was originally isolated as the gene product from abl of murine leukemia virus; the human abl gene has been isolated and shown, in cases of chronic myologenous leukemia, to be a causative factor in a fusion following chromosomal translocation (reviewed in (9Mayer B.J. Hirai H. Sakai R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar)). Ligands of moderate affinity have been identified for the isolated SH2 (10Zhu G. Decker S.J. Maclean D. McNamara D.J. Singh J. Sawyer T.K. Saltiel A.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1379-1385PubMed Google Scholar) and SH3 domains (11Cicchetti P. Mayer B.J. Thiel G. Baltimore D. Science. 1992; 257: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 12Ren R. Mayer B.K. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). For Abl SH3, a crystal structure of the complex of the ligand 3BP-1 is available(13Musacchio A. Saraste M. Wilmanns M. Nature Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), indicating that the ligand is in the so-called class I orientation (reviewed in (2Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar)). Using the general positioning of ligands to SH2 (1Kuriyan J. Cowburn D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 828-837Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar) as a framework, the likely orientation of the 2BP-1 ligand, PVY*ENVamide(10Zhu G. Decker S.J. Maclean D. McNamara D.J. Singh J. Sawyer T.K. Saltiel A.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1379-1385PubMed Google Scholar), was modeled. In an SH(32) model (Fig. 1), these ligands are closest at their C termini, and there is more than 20 Å separating them; about 32 Å separate the C terminus of the SH3 ligand from the N terminus of the SH2 ligand. An initial design of a consolidated ligand for both domains uses this model. Consolidated ligand I (Table 1) then joins the C termini of the individual 2BP and 3BP ligands using a branch through the side chain of a lysine residue. By model building, the methylene segments of the lysyl side chain and the oligoglycyl linker are expected to provide sufficient separation between the C termini of the individual ligands. A series of consolidated ligands, with different ligand segments for SH3, different lengths and orientations of the linker, and different analogs of the phosphotyrosyl residue in the ligand for SH2, were synthesized and tested for affinity to Abl SH(32), and in some cases to SH3 and SH2.TABLE I Open table in a new tab This design and synthesis of consolidated ligands is shown to be effective in Table 1. Increases in affinity of approximately 2 orders of magnitude were observed compared to unbranched equivalents (IversusII, IVversusV). An order of magnitude increase was observed comparing the most strongly bound single ligand to the equivalent consolidated ligand (2BP1versusIV). The affinity of a consolidated ligand changed when a subligand was modified proportionally to the change of affinity of separate ligand (I/3BP-1versusIV/3BP-2). The simple linker chemistry used did not interfere with the subligands affinities to the individual SH3 or SH2 domains. Experiments with the single ligands as inhibitors show classical competitive binding. The values of affinities of ligands with variable linker lengths (III-G5, IV-G6, VI-G7, VII-G8) are most readily interpreted as indicating an optimal length of about G6, with little interaction between the linker and the SH(32) protein. Analogs of the 2BP ligand of IV, namely the H-phosphonate (VIII), and the pY®Y of IV (IX) lead to decreases in affinity. The simplestmodel of how the consolidated ligand binds is that there are specific contacts at the subligand sites, and a solvated linker region. Using a model derived from NMR studies of the SH3 and SH2 domains(6Gosser Y.Q. Zheng J. Overduin M. Mayer B.J. Cowburn D. Structure. 1995; 3: 1075-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), assuming that the orientation for Abl is similar to that seen in Lck(4Eck M.J. Atwell S.K. Shoelson S.E. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 764-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), the two subligands are correctly accommodated, and no specific interactions are forced on the linker segment (Fig. 1). The specificity of interaction is much increased also (Table 1), so that IV will now discriminate between the complete SH(32) and its subdomains by more than an order of magnitude. The decreased affinity of IV compared to 2BP1 for the single SH2 domain is not readily explained. One possibility is that IV forms a partially folded structure reducing the population of ligand in a conformation suitable for binding to SH2. The affinities in Table 1 might be expected, from simple physical chemical concepts, to be somewhat higher for the consolidated ligands. The thermodynamic treatment of the consolidation of fragment affinities has been addressed by Jencks(24Jencks W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4046-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Briefly, for affinities to SH2, SH3, and SH32, the free energy contributions may be related by ΔG°32 = ΔGi2+ΔGi3+ΔGS where the subscripts 32, 2, and 3 refer to the SH domain interaction, and the superscript i refers to the individual binding contributions, and ΔGS represents the change in probability of binding that results from the connection of the two ligands. It may be assumed that the principal method by which apparent affinity increases for the ligands of this work is the reduction in degrees of translational freedom, when one subligand is bound(24Jencks W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4046-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). For perfect linker length and geometry, a consolidated ligand affinity up to the product of the individual association constants might be expected (i.e. ΔG°23 = ΔGi2+ΔGi3). Increases in degrees of rotational freedom associated with each glycyl residue, and with the lysyl methylenes reduce this affinity considerably, that is ΔGS represents a large, energetically unfavorable, increase in entropic contribution, and the overall free energy of interaction of the consolidated ligand is enhanced, but not dramatically, over that of its components. There are many possible applications of these consolidated ligands and their analogs. The examples in Table 1 show that for Abl SH(32), the two ligand sites can be oriented as shown in Fig. 1, that the 3BP-1 and 3BP-2 ligands for SH3 (in I and IV) are bound in the same direction, and that the SH2 and SH3 binding sites do not interfere with each other. Applications are expected to other SH(32)-containing proteins for the purpose of similar mapping, or of obtaining high affinity and specificity of binding for investigational or therapeutic purposes(14Brugge J.S. Science. 1993; 260: 918-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Some examples are dual and higher subligand consolidations for the adaptor protein Grb-2, and reagents like those shown here for Abl, although possibly linear rather than branched(15Feng S. Chen J.K. Yu H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), for Src family tyrosyl kinases(16Gilmer T. et al.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31711-31719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A major challenge in the investigation of intracellular signal transduction involves the relatively transient nature of the signal transducing complexes formed. Highly specific reagents may permit trapping of, or selective interference with, these complexes. The subligands in such consolidated ligands may be extended to other components of signal transducing complexes, for example the active sites of kinases, or binding sites of pleckstrin homology domains. For Abl, the consolidated ligands shown here are possible early leads to more complex ligands, which may have sufficient affinity and specificity to block the Bcr-Abl fusion kinase that is the predominant pathogenic agent in chronic myologenous leukemia. The chemistry used in these consolidated ligands is relatively simple and was selected to provide flexible linkers, as has been done for the hirulogs(17Maraganore J.M. Bourdon P. Jablonski J. Ramachandran K.L. Fenton II, J.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7095-7101Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Linkers of the correct size and rigidity should provide greater affinities. The structure of the Abl SH(32)/consolidated ligand complex may permit rational design of linkers of an optimal rigidity and size, and also permit identification of additional interactions for increased affinity. Peptidomimetic and non-peptidic linkers are obviously practical, as are other subligands including lipids, steroids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. These consolidated ligands present novel opportunities for chemistry at the interface with biology. D. C. thanks Y. Gosser, D. Fushman, S. Cahill, J. Manning, J. Kuriyan, S. K. Burley, and B.

The regulation of SPR1 gene expression by TPA occurs, in part, at the transcriptional level in primary human and monkey TBE cells. Using a transient transfection assay, we observed that TPA stimulates the activity of the reporter gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, by 2-4-fold in transfected TBE cells. However, this chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity is cell type-specific with significantly less activity in transformed epithelial cell lines and no activity in non-epithelial cell types.

Overexpression of c-JUN and TPA treatment synergistically stimulate the SPR1 promoter activity by more than 40-fold. Deletion analysis of the promoter region demonstrates that the DNA fragment of the first 98 base pairs of the 5′-flanking region contains the basal promoter activity, while the region between −162 and −96 contains the cis-enhancer elements for both the basal and TPA/c-JUN-stimulating promoter activities. This observation is supported by in vivo genomic footprinting studies that reveal persistent protections in the following motifs of this region: −141 TRE, −131 GT, −123 ETS-like, and −111 TRE-like motifs and in the enhanced protections in −141 TRE and −111 TRE-like motifs in cells after the TPA treatment.

They demonstrated that the synthesis of SPR proteins is rapidly induced in human keratinocyte cultures after UV irradiation or treatment with TPA. Both of these treatments enhance the cornification of keratinocytes in culture. Two distinct groups of SPR cDNA clones were subsequently isolated using the differential hybridization technique, and their sequences were determined(1Kartasova T. van de Putte P. Mol. Cell.

A unique feature of the structure of the SPR gene family is that the central segments of the encoded polypeptides are built up from tandemly repeated units of either eight (SPR1 and SPR3) or nine (SPR2) amino acids with the general consensus XKXPEPXX(6Gibbs S. Fijneman R. Wiegant J. van Kessel G. van de Putte P. Backendorf C. Genomics. 1993; 16: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The function of such a repeated peptide unit is currently unknown. Backendorf and Hohl (7Backendorf C. Hohl D. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 91Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) suggested that the SPR proteins are potential substrates involved in squamous cell cornification based on a comparison of both the N- and C-terminal amino acid sequences of SPR proteins with involucrin and loricrin, the cornified envelope proteins. Marvin et al.(8Marvin K.W. George M.D. Fujimoto W. Saunders N.A. Bernacki S.H. Jetten A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have recently demonstrated a similar finding. Unexpectedly, we also observed SPR1-like antigens in the nucleus(9Tesfaigzi J. An G. Wu R. Carlson D.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A similar observation was recently made by Hohl et al.(5Hohl D. de Viragh P.A. Amiguet-Barras F. Gibbs S. Backendorf C. Huber M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 902-909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) in epidermis. This finding suggests that the SPR1-like protein may also play a regulatory role in gene expression. In contrast to squamous tissues, the presence of SPR proteins is very low in respiratory tract epithelia that normally express mucociliary functions; however, we have demonstrated a rapid increase of SPR1 gene product in isolated human and monkey airway epithelial cells upon plating on a culture dish(4An G.

This increase can be reduced by supplementing the culture medium with vitamin A or its synthetic retinoid derivatives(4An G. Huang T.H.M. Tesfaigzi J. Garcia-Heras J. Ledbetter D.H. Carlson D.M.

We have also observed increased expression of SPR1 protein and mRNA in the patchy squamous cell metaplasia of monkey tracheal tissues after maintaining them under a vitamin A-free organ culture condition (data not shown). TPA, a potent squamous cell differentiation inducer, also stimulates SPR1 gene expression at the transcriptional level(11An G. Tesfaigzi J. Chuu Y.J. Wu R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10977-10982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results establish a close relationship between the up-regulation of SPR1 gene expression and squamous airway epithelial cell differentiation. The expression of squamous cell function in respiratory tract epithelium is a phenomenon that is frequently associated with injury. Squamous cell metaplasia has been implicated in the development of bronchogenic cancer(12Harris C.C. Sporn M.B. Kaufman D.G. Smith J.M. Baker M.S. Saffioti U. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1973; 48: 743-761Google Scholar, 13Jetten A.M. Nervi C. Volberg T.M. J. Natl. Cancer Invst. Monogr. 1992; 13: 93-100PubMed Google Scholar). The nature of the induction of squamous cell differentiation in the conducting airway epithelium is still unresolved. Therefore, studies of SPR1 gene expression in non-squamous airway epithelial cells may be different from those carried out in epithelial cells that express only the differentiation of skin-like properties such as keratinization and cornification. Results obtained from studying squamous cell differentiation may provide essential understanding of the mechanism underlying the divergent pathways of cell differentiation in conducting airway epithelium(14Jetten A.M. Environ. Health Perspect. 1989; 80: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We have isolated the human SPR1 genomic clone and have completed the DNA sequencing of the 5′-flanking region(11An G. Tesfaigzi J. Chuu Y.J. Wu R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10977-10982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purpose of this communication is to use the transient transfection study, in vivo genomic footprinting, site-directed mutagenesis, and the gel mobility shift assay to elucidate the elements essential for both the basal, uninduced and TPA-inducible promoter activities. We observed that the expression of the human SPR1 gene in conducting airway epithelium is dependent on JUN and TRE motifs located between −141 and −111 of the 5′-flanking region. Furthermore, the expression is cell type-specific, with a decrease in the promoter activity from primary epithelial cells to established cell lines, with no activity in the non-epithelial cell type. Primary TBE cells were isolated from rhesus monkey and human tracheobronchial tissues, which were obtained from the California Regional Primate Research Center and the Medical Center of the University of California at Davis, respectively. All procedures involved in the tissue procurement were approved by the University of California at Davis Animal Protocol Review Committee and the Human Subject Research Review Committee. Epithelial cell isolation and the culture conditions were carried out as described previously(15Wu R. Schiff L.J. In Vitro Models of Respiratory Epithelium. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1986: 1-26Google Scholar, 16Robinson C.B. Wu R. J. Tissue Culture Methods. 1991; 13: 95-102Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out between 7 and 14 days after the initiation of primary culture. The immortalized normal human TBE cell line, BEAS-2B, subclone S, was obtained from J. F. Lechner (Lovelace Biomedical & Environmental Research Institute, Albuquerque, NM). This cell line was maintained in a serum-free hormone-supplemented medium(15Wu R. Schiff L.J. In Vitro Models of Respiratory Epithelium. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1986: 1-26Google Scholar, 16Robinson C.B. Wu R. J. Tissue Culture Methods. 1991; 13: 95-102Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Other cell lines, HepG2 (ATCC HB8065, a hepatocellular carcinoma), Caco-2 (ATCC HTB37, a colon adenocarcinoma), and A172 (ATCC CRL1629, a glioblastoma), were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and they were maintained in serum-supplemented culture conditions according to the supplier's data sheet. Plasmid pBL-CAT2 contains the herpes simplex virus (HSV) thymidine kinase (tk) promoter in front of the CAT structural gene. Plasmid pBL-CAT3 is a promoterless construct. The expression plasmids encoding JUN B and JUN D cDNAs are pBR322-based vectors driven by a long terminal repeat promoter of the mouse sarcoma virus. The other expression plasmid encoding c-JUN cDNA was derived from pSVL vector (Pharmacia Biotech. Inc.) driven by the SV40 early promoter. The control plasmid pCH110 encodes β-galactosidase cDNA, which is driven by the SV40 promoter. Various 5′-flanking regions (between −2000 and +9 relative to the transcription start site) of the human SPR1 gene were amplified from human genomic clone (11An G. Tesfaigzi J. Chuu Y.J. Wu R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10977-10982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with two restriction sites attached to the two specific primers: SalI to the 5′-primer and XbaI to the 3′-primer. Positive clones containing the appropriate inserts were determined by PCR screening and confirmed by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. The generation of various chimeric constructs is described in Fig. 1. The 2000-CAT3, 622-CAT3, 557-CAT3, 162-CAT3, 113-CAT3, 98-CAT3, and 67-CAT3 constructs consist of DNA fragments between −2000 and +9, −622 and +9, −557 and +9, −162 and +9, −113 and +9, −98 and +9, and −67 and +9, respectively, of the SPR1 promoter in the pBL-CAT3 vector under XbaI and SalI cloning sites. The chimeric constructs 622/81-tk-CAT2, 622/540-tk-CAT2, 193/81-tk-CAT2, and 162/96-tk-CAT2 contain various 5′-flanking sequences of SPR1 gene between −622 and −81, −622 and −540, −193 and −81, and −162 and −96 relative to the transcription start site, respectively, in the pBL-CAT2 vector under XbaI and SalI cloning sites. The PCR reactions were carried out in a total volume of 100 μl containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin, 250 μM each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP (Pharmacia). Initial denaturation was at 95°C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 94°C denaturation (1 min), 55°C annealing (1 min), and 72°C extension (4 min), with a final 72°C extension for 7 min in an automated thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer Corp.). The 451-CAT3 and 135-CAT3 constructs containing regions between −451 to +9 and −135 to +9 of the SPR1 promoter, respectively, were constructed by ligation of SspI-XbaI and HincII-XbaI DNA fragments, digested from 622-CAT3 construct into pBL-CAT3 vector. DNA transfection was performed using a liposome technique (Lipofectin™) according to the procedure suggested by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Each culture dish at 70-80% confluence was washed with serum-free culture medium and then transfected with 3 μg of chimeric construct DNA, 1 μg of pCH110 plasmid DNA, and 1 μg of expression plasmid DNA when the cotransfection experiments were carried out. The pUC18 plasmid DNA was added to ensure that all the individual experiments contained the same total amount of DNA. TPA was added to transfected cultures at 10 ng/ml for 48 h before the harvesting. Cell extracts were prepared by freeze-thaw in 0.25 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The protein concentration of cell extracts was determined by a modified Bradford technique (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein were assayed for CAT activity by either a liquid scintillation method (11An G. Tesfaigzi J. Chuu Y.J. Wu R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10977-10982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Boehringer Mannheim) following the manufacturer's suggested protocol. The β-galactosidase activity, used as the internal control that normalized transfection efficiency, was determined by a β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega). Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Dignam et al.(17Dignam J. Lebowitz R. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar) from cultured cells, except that during extraction 600 mM NaCl was used instead of 400 mM NaCl. The binding was performed in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 30 mM NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 μg of salmon sperm DNA, and 50-100 ng of poly(dI-dC). After incubation on ice for 10 min with 3-5 μg of nuclear extract, 0.1-0.5 ng of end-labeled probe (~20,000 cpm) was added and incubated at room temperature for 15-20 min. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved in native 4% acrylamide gels (30:1 ratio of acrylamide to bisacrylamide) in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer. In supershift analysis, nuclear extracts were mixed with 1-2 μg of anti-c-JUN antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) and incubated on ice prior to adding the labeled DNA probe. For competition experiments, cold consensus AP1 oligonucleotide (Promega) was added to the reaction mixture prior to adding labeled probe. The method of in vivo DMS footprinting was described by Mueller and Wold(18Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). The primary TBE cells were cultured to 70-80% confluence followed by incubation with or without TPA (10 ng/ml, Sigma) for 12 h. For in vivo DMS treatments, cells were treated with 0.1% DMS (Aldrich) for 2 min at room temperature. The DMS-treated cells were lysed in SDS buffer (0.5% SDS, 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, and 20 mM EDTA) and then incubated with proteinase K (250 μg/ml) (Sigma) at 37°C for 12 h. Genomic DNA was then isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction. As an in vitro control, protein-free genomic DNA was prepared and treated with DMS for 20-30 s at room temperature. It was then cleaved by piperidine (Aldrich) and mapped by the ligation-mediated PCR method of genomic DNA sequencing(19Reddy P.M. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Papayannopoulou T. Shen C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8287-8295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA fragments were analyzed on 6% denaturing urea-polyacrylamide gels. The bands on the autoradiogram were detected after 24-48 h of exposure. The reproducibility of the in vivo footprinting data was checked by analyzing genomic DNA samples prepared from three or more separate batches of DMS-treated cells. The StatView™ statistical program on the Macintosh computer was used to perform analysis of variance between different CAT reporter constructs. The Fisher PLSD (Protected Least Significant Difference) test was used to determine whether existing differences were significant at the 95% confidence level. Previous research based on the nuclear run-on assay and transient transfection study suggests that the treatment of primary airway epithelial cells with TPA stimulates the expression of the SPR1 gene at the transcriptional level (11An G. Tesfaigzi J. Chuu Y.J. Wu R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10977-10982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA sequence analysis of genomic clones revealed the following motifs: “TATA” box at −28; three TRE-like sites at −49, −111, and −472; ETS at −55 and ETS-like at −123; GT motif (GGTGG) at −131; TRE site at −141; and CRE-like at −588 relative to the transcription start site in the 5′-flanking region of the human SPR1 gene(11An G. Tesfaigzi J. Chuu Y.J. Wu R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10977-10982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The −49 TRE-like site and −55 ETS site are merged together. To elucidate the functional roles of these putative cis-acting elements, a number of chimeric constructs containing various lengths of the 5′-flanking region and the CAT reporter gene were prepared (Fig. 1). The functional roles for the motifs of −141 TRE, −131 TRE-like, −55 ETS, and −49 TRE-like were further analyzed by site-directed mutagenesis. These constructs were used in transient transfection studies. Initially, we observed no significant difference in either the basal or the TPA-induced CAT activities between 622-CAT3 and 2000-CAT3 construct transfected cells of primary TBE cultures (data not presented). Therefore, we focused the deletional analysis on the region from −622 to +9. As presented in Fig. 2, the relative CAT activity in 622-CAT3 transient transfected cells without TPA treatment is 24-fold higher than the control cells transfected with the promoterless pBL-CAT3 DNA or 2-fold higher than those cells with pBL-CAT2 containing the tk promoter. The relative CAT activity in the absence of TPA treatment was the same among different chimeric constructs, except for the 162-CAT3, which was 4-fold higher (Fig. 2). This implies that the DNA sequences between −98 and +9 of the 5′-flanking region contain sufficient information for the basal promoter activity. This elevation in the basal promoter activity observed in 162-CAT3, but not in 135-CAT3, implies that the DNA fragment between −162 and −135 contains a sequence responsible for the enhanced expression. In contrast, cells transfected with 451-CAT3 construct, which contains the 162-CAT3 DNA fragment plus the flanking region between −451 and −162, did not exhibit enhanced basal promoter activity. This implies that the region between −451 and −162 may contain a sequence that down-regulates this enhanced activity. To further elucidate the region involved in the basal promoter activity, a 67-CAT3 chimeric construct that includes −55 ETS, −49 TRE-like, and −28 TATA was studied. As presented in Fig. 3, the relative CAT activity in cells transfected with this construct is very low but significantly higher (2-fold) than the promoterless pBL-CAT3 transfected cells; however, this activity is less than 10% of the 98-CAT3 transfection. To clarify this residual activity, site-directed mutations in both −55 ETS and −49 TRE-like sites were prepared. Single or double mutations in these sites have no effect on this residual CAT activity, which suggests that neither site is involved in this residual CAT activity. Both immunohistochemistry (3Kartasova T. van Muijen G.N.P. van Pelt-Heerschap H. van de Putte P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2204-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and mRNA analyses (4An G. Huang T.H.M. Tesfaigzi J. Garcia-Heras J. Ledbetter D.H. Carlson D.M. Wu R. Am. J. Respir. Cell and Mol. Biol. 1992; 7: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the expression of the SPR1 gene is closely associated with squamous epithelial cell types. This specificity is preserved in the basal promoter analysis. As illustrated in Fig. 4, 162-CAT3 transfected primary human TBE cells exhibited the highest CAT activity as compared with the immortalized human normal TBE cell line, S clone, and other ATCC cell lines. The non-epithelial cell line A172 exhibited no CAT activity. In the case of transfection with the 98-CAT3 construct, which contains no enhanced sequence, all TBE cells, regardless of their origin, exhibited significantly lower levels of basal promoter activity. Transfected non-TBE cells exhibited no activity. The relative CAT activity in 622-CAT3 transfected cells was further enhanced 4-fold by TPA (Fig. 2). This enhancement of promoter activity by TPA is maintained in various deletion-construct transfected TBE cells, until the TRE-like motif at −111 is deleted in such constructs as 98-CAT3 and 67-CAT3. These results imply that the CRE-like motif at −588 and the two TRE-like motifs at −472 and −49 are not involved in mediating the TPA response. We observed that TPA transiently stimulates the expression of the JUN family gene products (data not shown) in TBE cells prior to the stimulation of SPR1 gene expression. We then examined whether overexpression of JUN family proteins can enhance the CAT activity in the absence of TPA treatment. Cotransfection with one of the JUN family genes in 622-CAT3 transfected cells stimulated CAT activity 2-10-fold in the absence of TPA treatment (Fig. 5). Among the JUN family genes, c-JUN cotransfection was the most active. TPA treatment of these c-JUN cotransfected cells resulted in a 40-fold increase of CAT activity; however, TPA has no effect on the expression of JUN family proteins in cotransfected cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the SPR1 promoter is synergistically stimulated by TPA and c-JUN. To further elucidate whether the regulatory sequences at the 5′-flanking region can enhance the promoter activity in heterologous constructs, several selective DNA fragments of SPR1 promoter were cloned to the pBL-CAT2 vector carrying the heterologous HSV-tk promoter (Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 6, in the absence of TPA and c-JUN cotransfection, the relative CAT activities in both 622/81-tk-CAT2 and 193/81-tk-CAT2 transfected cells were 13- and 11-fold higher than the pBL-CAT2 control. However, this enhanced activity cannot be seen in 622/540-tk-CAT2 transfected cells. This suggests that the enhanced activity located at the −193 and −81 5′-flanking region is capable of stimulating a heterologous promoter. The stimulations by TPA and c-JUN cotransfection are not as significant as in the homologous promoter system, only a 20-40% stimulation. However, this stimulation was not seen in 622/540-tk-CAT2 transfected cells. These results suggest that the DNA sequence located between −193 and −81 contains the cis-element that is also capable of activating the heterologous tk promoter in response to TPA/c-JUN treatment. To elucidate the site(s) responsible for this stimulation, we carried out site-direct mutations in −141 TRE and −111 TRE-like motifs. As illustrated in Fig. 7, double mutations at these two sites (−141M, −111M) significantly reduced the enhancement on tk promoter activity; however, a single mutation at −141 TRE motif (−141M) has no effect. Yet, a single mutation at the −111 TRE-like site (−111M) reduced the enhanced activity by 50%. In contrast to the enhanced tk promoter activity, a single mutation in either of these two sites has no effect on the stimulating activity exerted by the c-JUN cotransfection. These results suggest that any one of these two TRE motifs can participate in c-JUN mediated stimulation. To further understand the nature of the regulation of SPR1 gene expression in vivo, the interactions between the promoter DNA sequence and transcriptional proteins were studied by DMS footprinting. Using appropriate primers as described in Fig. 8A, the DNA-protein interaction sites of the SPR1 promoter region were mapped. Genomic footprinting data of the DNA fragment between −164 and −94 are displayed in Fig. 8B. The G residue at −140 of the coding strand of the TRE motif was partially protected, while the flanking G residue at −143 was hyperreactive in primary TBE cells. This protection at −140 G residue was slightly enhanced by TPA. In addition, a displayed protection pattern at −138 G residue was observed only in TPA-treated cells. Other protection residues in the coding strand included the G residues at −130, −127, −126, −121, −120, which are parts of the GT (−131 to −127) and ETS-like (−123 to −116) motifs. At the −111 TRE-like motif site, the G residue at −110 was partially protected, and this protection was slightly enhanced in cells after the TPA treatment. The G residues at −113, −112, and −99 in other flanking regions were partially protected, whereas the G residue at −94 was hyperreactive to piperidine cleavage in both TPA-treated or untreated cells. On the noncoding strand, only G residues at −104 and −106 displayed protections (Fig. 8B). Other DMS footprints were detected around the CRE-like motif. On the coding strand, similar protections occurring at −587 and −606 G residues were observed in both TPA-treated and untreated cells (Fig. 9B). On the noncoding strand, G residue at −582 was partially protected, whereas G residues at −589, −593, and −598 were hyperreactive. Again, TPA had no effect on the footprinting pattern in this region. A summary of these footprinting studies is presented in Fig. 10. There are multiple protections in the region between the −141 TRE and the −111 TRE-like motifs. These protections, presumably due to the interactions between the trans-activation proteins and the DNA sequence, are further enhanced on both −141 TRE and −111 TRE-like motifs by TPA. In contrast, the protections in the CRE-like motif at −588 are not affected. The DNA-protein interactions were further studied"
https://openalex.org/W2058204384,"The human glucagon receptor was expressed at high density in Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells. Following selection with G418 and induction with CuSO4, the cells expressed the receptor at a level of 250 pmol/mg of membrane protein. The glucagon receptor was functionally coupled to increases in cyclic AMP in S2 cells. Protein immunoblotting with anti-peptide antibodies revealed the expressed receptor to have an apparent molecular mass of 48 kDa, consistent with low levels of glycosylation in this insect cell system.Binding of [fluorescein-Trp25]glucagon to S2 cells expressing the glucagon receptor was monitored as an increase in fluorescence anisotropy along with an increase in fluorescence intensity. Anisotropy data suggest that the mobility of the fluorescein is restricted when the ligand is bound to the receptor. Kinetic analysis indicates that the binding of glucagon to its receptor proceeds via a bimolecular interaction, with a forward rate constant that is several orders of magnitude slower than diffusion-controlled. These data would be consistent with a conformational change upon the binding of agonist to the receptor.

INTRODUCTIONGlucagon is a 29-amino acid peptide produced by proteolytic cleavage of the proglucagon gene product in the A cells of the pancreas. The peptide acts at the liver to increase the rate of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, in this regard serving as the major counterregulatory hormone of insulin (for review, see (1Defronzo R.A. Bonadonna R.C. Ferrannini E. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 318-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar)). Glucagon binds to specific receptors on the surface of hepatocytes to stimulate increases in cyclic AMP, inositol phosphate, and intracellular calcium. The rat and human glucagon receptors have been cloned (2Jelinek L.J. Lok S. Rosenberg G.B. Smith R.A. Grant F.J. Biggs S. Bensch P.A. Kuijper J.L. Sheppard P.O. Sprecher C.A. O'hara P.J. Foster D.

Commun. 1994; 198: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and shown to contain seven putative transmembrane domains characteristic of the G protein-coupled family of receptors(5Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). The glucagon receptor shares significant sequence homology with the subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors that includes receptors for glucagon-like peptide-1 and parathyroid hormone (for review, see (6Segre G.V. Goldring S.R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 4: 309-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar)). This subclass of G protein-coupled receptors bears little sequence homology to the well characterized β-adrenergic/rhodopsin subfamily, and relatively little is known about the molecular interactions of ligands with receptors in this class.Glucagon itself has been the subject of a wide variety of physical studies such as x-ray crystallography(7Sasaki K. Dockerill S. Adamiak D.A. Tickle I.J. Blundell T. Nature. 1975; 257: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), NMR(8Braun W. Wider G. Lee K.H. Wurtrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 921-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and circular dichroism(9Moran E.C. Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 77: 1300-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, these studies have been performed in various lipid or detergent solutions, which affect the conformation of the peptide. In addition, it has been observed that the secondary structure of glucagon is dependent on the concentration of peptide used in the experiment(9Moran E.C. Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 77: 1300-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For these reasons, the structure determined by these techniques may not reflect the physiological state of glucagon as it interacts with its receptor.As is the case for most G protein-coupled receptors, biophysical and structural characterization of the glucagon receptor has been hampered by an inability to produce sufficient quantities of receptor protein. In the present study, we have expressed the glucagon receptor at high density using the Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cell system (10Bunch T.A. Grinblat Y. Goldstein L.S.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1043-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). [fluorescein-Trp25]Glucagon (11Heithier H. Ward L.D. Cantrill R.C. Klein H.W. Im M. Pollak G. Freeman B. Schiltz E. Peters R. Helmreich E.J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 971: 298-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has been used as a tool for obtaining kinetic and structural information on the human glucagon receptor. The high levels of expression of human glucagon receptor obtained in S2 cells have allowed us to directly monitor changes in the fluorescence properties of this ligand as it binds to the receptor. This system has proven useful in understanding the environment of the ligand binding site of the human glucagon receptor and in monitoring conformational changes in both the receptor and the ligand during the binding interaction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsSynthetic human glucagon was purchased from Sigma or Peninsula Laboratories or synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 432A peptide synthesizer. [2-thio-Trp25]Glucagon was prepared from bovine/porcine glucagon (Sigma) as described previously (12Wright D.E. Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10884-10887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then reacted with 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon) to prepare [fluorescein-Trp25]glucagon, as described in (11Heithier H. Ward L.D. Cantrill R.C. Klein H.W. Im M. Pollak G. Freeman B. Schiltz E. Peters R. Helmreich E.J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 971: 298-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An extinction coefficient of 26,000 M−1 cm−1 at 496 nm (11Heithier H. Ward L.D. Cantrill R.C. Klein H.W. Im M. Pollak G. Freeman B. Schiltz E. Peters R. Helmreich E.J.M. Biochim. Biophys.

A 1.4-kilobase pair fragment encoding the human glucagon receptor was isolated by further cleavage of pVE2702 with XbaI. The 1.4-kilobase pair fragment was subcloned into Bluescript SK+ via the SmaI and XbaI sites (blue-hGlu). blue-hGlu was restricted with NotI, and the ends were filled in by incubation with Klenow polymerase and dNTPs. The 1.4-kilobase pair fragment containing the glucagon receptor cDNA was isolated by restriction with EcoRI and was subcloned into the expression plasmid pRmHa3 (10Bunch T.A. Grinblat Y. Goldstein L.S.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1043-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. L. S. B. Goldstein, University of Arizona) via the SmaI and EcoRI sites. This plasmid construct is subsequently referred to as pRm-hGlu.S2 cells were maintained and induced to express recombinant protein essentially as described by Bunch et al.(10Bunch T.A. Grinblat Y. Goldstein L.S.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1043-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). S2 cells (provided by Dr. L. S. B. Goldstein, University of Arizona) were maintained at 27°C in Schneider media supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, two mM glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. S2 cells (1 × 107 cells) were cotransfected with 1 μg of pUChsneo (gift of Dr. Herman Steller) (13Steller H. Pirrotta V. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 167-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 20 μg of pRm-hGlu using the CaPO4 precipitation method. pUChsneo encodes a gene for G418 resistance whose expression is driven by the Drosophila heat shock promoter. Twenty-four hours after transfection, G418 was added to a final concentration of 300 μg/ml. Cells were split approximately every 5-7 days. A stable population of G418-resistant cells was obtained in 3-4 weeks. S2 cells (1-2 × 106 cells/ml) were induced to express receptor by the addition of 1 mM CuSO4.Fluorescence Flow Cytometry and Cell SortingCells were analyzed for single cell fluorescence on a FACScan/Vax flow cytometeter (Benton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA). The cells were sorted based on fluorescein intensity using a FACStarPLUS cell sorter-consort/Vax (FACS, Benton Dickinson) following standard procedures.Determination of Glucagon Binding and Whole Cell cAMP Levels in S2 CellsS2 membranes were prepared by hypotonic lysis, frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80°C as described previously(14Strader C.D. Sigal I.S. Register R.B. Candelore M.R. Rands E. Dixon R.A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4384-4388Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). [fluorescein-Trp25]Glucagon binding was performed in Buffer A (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 25 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μMo-phenathroline). [125I]Glucagon binding assays were performed in Buffer A plus 0.05% bovine serum albumin. Membranes and [125I]glucagon (100 pM) were incubated for 1 h at 22°C. Membranes were harvested by filtration over GF/C filters (Whatman) that had been presoaked in 0.5% polyethylenimine. Due to high levels of nonspecific binding, a direct determination of the Kd for [125I]glucagon by saturation binding was not possible. At the low concentrations of [125I]glucagon employed in the competition binding experiments, the IC50 values observed for each state should approximate the Kd values. For the measurement of cAMP, cells were resuspended in ACC buffer (75 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mM sucrose, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM Na2S2O3 0.1 mM Ro 20-1724 (4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-2-imidazolidinone, from BioMol, Inc.)) and incubated with ligand for 45 min at 22°C as described previously(15Graziano M.P. Hey P.J. Borkowski D. Chicchi G.G. Strader C.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). cAMP was quantified by radioimmunoassay using an Attoflow automated radioimmunoassay machine (ATTO Instruments, Inc.). Protein was determined using the method of Bradford as amended by Bio-Rad.Immunological MethodsFour branch multiple antigenic peptides (16Posnett D.N. McGrath H. Tam J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1719-1725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) corresponding to sequences in the C terminus of the human glucagon receptor were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. The sequence of peptides LX1 (NH2-SELRRRWHRWRLGKVLWEER-COOH) and LX2 (NH2-SQDSSAETPLAGGLPRIAESP-COOH) were consistent with amino acid analysis. Polyclonal sera were raised in New Zealand White rabbits (Cocalico Biologicals Inc.).Western blot analysis was performed on nitrocellulose (BA85, 0.4-μm pore size (Schleicher and Schuell Inc). Immunodetection of glucagon receptor was performed in TBS-T (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 137 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) utilizing the ECL kit (Amersham Corp.). The secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase-linked F(ab′)2 fragment, Amersham Corp.) was used at a 1:3000 dilution.Fluorescence SpectroscopyFluorescence measurements were performed on an SLM 48000 spectrofluorometer at 20°C. Excitation was achieved with an argon laser, where the 488-nm line was selected by a sharp bandpass filter and attenuated with a 0.3-1.0 optical density neutral density filter. In order to obtain a correction factor to compensate for differences between photomultipliers, the sample was excited with both vertical and horizontal light. This was achieved by first depolarizing the laser light and then selecting either vertical or horizontal light with a polarizer. Emission light was selected with a 530-nm bandpass filter (Corion) followed by either a parallel or perpendicular polarizer. Using the T format, parallel and perpendicular emissions were collected simultaneously. Cuvettes were filled with 1.5 ml of buffer and were continuously stirred. Background and correction factors were recorded prior to the relevant portion of the data collection for time-based acquisition. All signals were recorded in the ratio mode using rhodamine as the standard. The background fluorescence (S2 cell membranes in the absence of [fluorescein-Trp25]glucagon) was subtracted from each signal, and then the correction factor was applied to the vertical intensity. The data were then analyzed as follows. Anisotropy=(I||-I⊥)/(I||+2I⊥)(Eq. 1) Intensity=(I||+2I⊥)(Eq. 2) Data AnalysisThe fraction of bound and free ligand were determined by (17Lakowicz J.R. Principle of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983: 145-147Google Scholar) robs=rbound(fraction ligand bound)+rfree(fraction ligand free)(Eq. 3) where robs is the observed anisotropy of a mixture of free ligand and ligand bound to the receptor. assumes that there is no quantum yield change upon ligand binding. In order to evaluate the fraction bound by anisotropy with a quantum yield change, the following modification was used (17Lakowicz J.R. Principle of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983: 145-147Google Scholar) fraction bound=(robs-rfree)/(rbound-robs)Q+robs-rfree)(Eq. 4) where Q is the relative quantum yield change upon binding. Association time courses were fit to using the Marquardt's algorithm as described by Press et al.(18Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes in C. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1988Google Scholar). r(t)=A*(1-e-t/r)+initial(Eq. 5) where r(t) is the anisotropy at time t, and the initial value is assumed to be the anisotropy of the free ligand. The fitted values A is the amplitude and τ is the relaxation time for the exponential increase. Dissociation time courses were fit as follows r(t)=A1*e-t/τ1+A2*e-t/τ2+endpoint(Eq. 6) where A1, A2, τ1, τ2 are the amplitudes and relaxation times for two kinetic phases. The same equation was used for fitting intensity data (I(t)).For radioligand and functional assays, IC50 (the concentration of ligand displacing 50% of the labeled ligand from the binding site) and EC50 (the half-maximal effective concentration of ligand in a functional assay) values were calculated using the Prism program (Graphpad Software). Bmax values (the concentration of ligand bound at saturation) were determined from the fitted competition curves as described previously(19Fong T.M. Yu H. Huang R.-R.C. Strader C.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11806-11811Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).RESULTSExpression of the Human Glucagon Receptor in S2 CellsThe human glucagon receptor cDNA was subcloned into vector pRmHa3 and cotransfected with pUChsneo into S2 cells. pRmHa3 contains a Drosophila metallothionein promoter that is tightly regulated in S2 cells(10Bunch T.A. Grinblat Y. Goldstein L.S.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1043-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). After 3 weeks of growth in 0.3 μg/ml G418, cells were induced to express glucagon receptor by incubation with 1 mM CuSO4. After 3 days of induction, the cells bound [125I]glucagon with a Bmax of 110 pmol/mg of membrane protein, whereas mock-transfected S2 cells displayed no specific [125I]glucagon binding.In an attempt to select a subpopulation of cells with higher expression, cells induced to express the glucagon receptor were incubated with [fluorescein-Trp25]glucagon and sorted by FACS. The 5% of the cells displaying the highest levels of binding were collected and expanded. Upon induction with 1 mM CuSO4, cells displayed a time-dependent increase in [125I]glucagon binding with maximal levels of 250 pmol/mg of protein achieved at 3-4 days after induction (data not shown). This represents about a 2-fold increase in receptor expression levels following FACS. After 4 months of continuous culture in the absence of CuSO4, no significant loss of receptor expression has been observed.Immunoblotting of the Human Glucagon Receptor Expressed in S2 CellsAntisera from rabbits injected with either peptide LX1 or LX2 recognized a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 48 kDa in transfected S2 cells induced with CuSO4 (Fig. 1, lanes C and F). This protein was absent in nontransfected or transfected but uninduced S2 cells (Fig. 1). The Mr = 48 kDa observed in this system differs from that measured by affinity labeling of the glucagon receptor in rat liver membranes (Mr =63 kDa, (20Iwanij V. Hur K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)), most likely reflecting differences in glycosylation between the receptor expressed in Drosophila versus mammalian cells.Binding of [fluorescein-Trp25]Glucagon to the ReceptorThe displacement of [125I]glucagon by glucagon or [fluorescein-Trp25]glucagon was best fit to a two-site model with IC50 values of 0.34 and 37 nM for glucagon and 0.31 and 111 nM for [fluorescein-Trp25]glucagon (Fig. 2). When a similar experiment was performed in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog Gpp(NH)p, which uncouples receptors from G proteins, a single low affinity site for glucagon was observed (IC50 = 19 nM, data not shown), suggesting that the high affinity site observed in the absence of Gpp(NH)p represents binding of the agonist to the receptor-G protein complex. Competition of [125I]glucagon by [fluorescein-Trp25]glucagon demonstrated that the affinity of the fluorescein-labeled glucagon was similar to that of unmodified glucagon (Fig. 2), as previously reported by Heithier et al.(11Heithier H. Ward L.D. Cantrill R.C. Klein H.W. Im M. Pollak G. Freeman B. Schiltz E. Peters R. Helmreich E.J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 971: 298-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 2Competition binding of [125I]glucagon with glucagon and [fluorescein-Trp25]glucagon. G418-resistant S2 cells transfected with pRm-hGlu were incubated with 1 mM CuSO4 for 3 days, membranes were prepared, and binding of 0.1 nM [125I]glucagon determined in competition with glucagon (○) or [fluorescein-Trp25]glucagon (•).

Incubation of S2 cells expressing the receptor with glucagon or [fluorescein-Trp25]glucagon led to a 30-fold increase in cAMP levels, with an EC50 of 1.6 nM for glucagon and 1.9 nM for [fluorescein-Trp25]glucagon (data not shown). [fluorescein-Trp25]Glucagon thus functions as an agonist in the S2 cells, with an efficacy and potency similar to that of unlabeled glucagon.[fluorescein-Trp25]Glucagon binding to membrane preparations from S2 cells expressing the human glucagon receptor was detected by monitoring changes in fluorescence anisotropy and intensity. Fig. 3A shows the time-dependent increase in anisotropy that was observed following the addition of [fluorescein-Trp25]glucagon to these membranes and the time-dependent reversal of this increase upon displacement with one μM unlabeled glucagon. The increase in anisotropy was not observed with S2 membranes from nontransfected cells (Fig. 3C) and was blocked by preincubation with unlabeled glucagon (Fig. 3A). An increase in fluorescence intensity was also observed upon binding of [fluorescein-Trp25]glucagon to its receptor, which was reversed by the addition of unlabeled glucagon (Fig. 3B). Nonspecific interactions were examined by adding [fluorescein-Trp25]glucagon to membranes prepared from nontransfected S2 cells not expressing the glucagon receptor (Fig. 3C). The intensity transformation displayed an initial decrease followed by a gradual return to a base-line level that was not affected by the subsequent addition of unlabeled glucagon. The initial decrease was observed frequently, but not always, and is assumed to result from a mixing artifact and/or absorption to the membranes of [fluorescein-Trp25]glucagon. Because anisotropy measurements were less sensitive to nonspecific binding or mixing artifacts than were the intensity changes (Fig. 3C), changes in anisotropy were used as a readout to examine the kinetic parameters of the interaction of [fluorescein-Trp25]glucagon with the human glucagon receptor.Figure 3Binding of [fluorescein-Trp25]glucagon detected by an increase in anisotropy and intensity. A, detection of binding by anisotropy. Membranes were diluted to 0.02 mg/ml (containing 2.6 nM [125I]glucagon binding sites), and 2 nM [fluorescein-Trp25]glucagon was added at time = 0. Anisotropy was recorded as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Glucagon was added at the indicated time by a 1000-fold dilution from a 1 mM stock in 0.1 N acetic acid. [fluorescein-Trp25]Glucagon was also added to sample to which 1 μM glucagon was added first (Glucagon Blocked). B, detection of binding by fluorescence intensity. Data from the anisotropy experiment shown in panel A were analyzed to monitor intensity, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, control experiment in which [fluorescein-Trp25]glucagon was added to membranes prepared from nontransfected S2 cells. Intensity (I) and anisotropy (r) data are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Determination of the Anisotropy and Fluorescence Intensity of Bound [fluorescein-Trp25]GlucagonThe observed anisotropy is a combination of signals from the bound and free ligand. The anisotropy of the bound ligand alone could be measured if receptor were present in excess or if free ligand were removed from the solution. Adding excess receptor was not practical under these experimental conditions. However, the signal from free ligand could rapidly be removed by adding anti-fluorescein antibody, which quenched up to 95% of the fluorescein fluorescence upon binding(21Sklar L.A. Fay S.P. Seligmann B.E. Freer R.J. Muthukumaraswamy N. Mueller H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Tota M.R. Daniel S. Sirotina A. Mazina K.E. Fong T.M. Longmore J. Strader C.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13079-13086Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, the addition of anti-fluorescein antibody to the [fluorescein-Trp25]glucagon-receptor complex resulted in a rapid quenching of the fluorescence of the free ligand, while that of the bound ligand was protected from the antibody. As the ligand dissociated from the receptor, its fluorescence was quenched by the anti-fluorescein antibody, as observed by a slow decrease in intensity after the rapid quenching phase. While the intensity was decreasing during this period, the anisotropy remained stable (Fig. 4B). This anisotropy signal originated from the bound ligand and was determined to be 0.281 ± 0.001 (n = 2). Once the anisotropy of the bound ligand was determined, could be used to estimate the fraction of ligand bound to the receptor. Applying to the data in Fig. 4(robs = 0.176, rfree = 0.096 (data not shown), rbound = 0.281) indicated that 43% of the ligand is bound under these conditions, consistent with the amount of fluorescence protected from quenching by the antibody (Fig. 4A).Figure 4Glucagon receptor protects [fluorescein-Trp25]glucagon from fluorescence quenching by an anti-fluorescein antibody. Membranes were diluted to a receptor concentration of 5.3 nM in [125I]glucagon binding sites. [fluorescein-Trp25]Glucagon was added to the membranes to a final concentration of 2 nM. After binding was complete (15 min), 10 μl of anti-fluorescein antibody (see “Experimental Procedures”) was added (time = 0). The data were processsed as described under “Experimental Procedures” except that the residual fluorescence at the end of the reaction was subtracted from the parallel and perpendicular fluorescence intensities collected after the introduction of the antibody. The antibody was also added to membranes and [fluorescein-Trp25]glucagon where the receptor was blocked by 1 μM glucagon (Glucagon blocked). Panel A shows the intensity recording for the addition of anti-fluorescein antibody to the glucagon receptor and [fluorescein-Trp25]glucagon mixture and the mixture preblocked with glucagon. Panel B shows the anisotropy recording for the addition of anti-fluorescein antibody to the glucagon receptor and [fluorescein-Trp25]glucagon mixture.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Dissociation Kinetics of [fluorescein-Trp25]Glucagon from Its ReceptorThe dissociation time course of [fluorescein-Trp25]glucagon was measured in the absence of Gpp(NH)p using low concentrations (2-10 nM) of the agonist. Under these conditions, two distinct relaxation phases could be observed (Fig. 5, Table 1), suggestive of agonist binding to two affinity states of the receptor. The slowly dissociating phase corresponds to the high affinity guanine nucleotide sensitive site noted in the competition binding experiments shown in Fig. 2, whereas the fast phase corresponds to the low affinity state of the receptor. These experiments, in which approximately 10 nM ligand and receptor were used, indicate that most of the glucagon receptor in the S2 cells is in the low affinity uncoupled state, as would be expected for a system in which the receptor is significantly overexpressed and G protein may be limiting. In contrast, at the submaximal concentration of [125I]glucagon used in the binding assays, most of the radioligand would bind to the high affinity state of the receptor, so that the high affinity state would be significantly overrepresented in the competition binding experiments (Fig. 2).Figure 5Dissociation of [fluorescein-Trp25]glucagon detected by anisotropy in the absence of Gpp(NH)p. Ten nM [fluorescein-Trp25]glucagon was added to membranes diluted to 0.09 mg/ml (10.4 nM [125I]glucagon binding sites). Unlabeled glucagon (1 μM) was added 15 min after the addition of [fluorescein-Trp25]glucagon (time 0). The data were fit to a single or two-phase exponential decay using. The fitted parameters for a two-phase fit were amplitude 1 = 74.5% with a rate of 4.7 × 10-3 s−1; amplitude 2 = 25.5% with a rate of 6.6 × 10-4 s−1; and an end point of 0.113. For a single phase fit, the data were fit with a rate of 3.4 × 10-3 s−1 and an end point of 0.120. Both fits are presented in the figure; however, the two-phase fit is obscured by the experimental data points. Residuals for the one and two phase analyses are shown in the insets.View Larg"

High level NF expression is also dependent upon axonal continuity since NF mRNA levels are down-regulated after nerve transection. This study shows that both postnatal up-regulation and axotomy-induced down-regulation are altered by deletion of 3′-UTR from the mouse light NF subunit (NF-L). Transgenes with (NF-L+) or without (NF-L−) 3′-UTR display similar patterns of neuron-specific expression but differ in their respective levels of expression.

Specifically, the NF-L− transgene undergoes a 3-fold aberrant up-regulation between embryonic days 15 (E15) and 18 (E18) and has lost its susceptibility to axotomy-induced down-regulation. Studies of transfected P19 cells show that 3′-UTR deletion leads to a severalfold stabilization of NF-L mRNA and an increase in steady-state mRNA level.

Reduced expression of endogenous NF-L also leads to NF accumulations and reduction in axonal size as well as diminished expression of NF-M and NF-H(6Ohara O. Gahara Y. Miyatake T. Teraoka H. Kitamura T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Axonal size may also be influenced by NF phosphorylation or by interactions with Schwann cells(7Cole J.S.

These findings have led to the view that NF mRNAs are stabilized in high-expressing neurons and that changes in mRNA stabilities may account for the coordinate up-regulation and down-regulation of NF mRNA levels that occur during postnatal development and in axotomized neurons, respectively. Moreover, the conservation of 3′-UTR in NF mRNAs (14Schwartz M.L. Shneidman P.S. Bruce J. Schlaepfer W.W. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 27: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and the involvement of 3′-UTR in mRNA stability (17Hentze M.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 18Sachs A.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 413-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar) suggest that the 3′-UTR in NF genes may harbor determinants of NF expression.The present study has begun to test the above hypothesis in vivo by comparing expression of the endogenous mouse NF-L gene with that of a marked mouse NF-L transgenes in which the 3′-UTR is intact (NF-L+) or deleted (NF-L−). Our findings identify the 3′-UTR of the mouse NF-L gene as instrumental in mediating both the developmental up-regulation and the axotomy-induced down-regulation of NF-L. The findings indicate the importance of 3′-UTR in NF-L expression and highlight the potential role of posttranscriptional mechanisms in regulation of neuron-specific gene products.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of a Marked NF-L TransgeneThe mouse NF-L gene (19Lewis S.A.

The in-frame addition included SfiI, NarI, and StuI restriction sites and abolished the BglII site. The insert was made from complementary oligonucleotides with protruding BglII ends. Orientation was determined by sequencing. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 391 DNA synthesizer.Construction of Marked NF-L Genes with Intact (NF-L+) or Deleted (NF-L−) 3′-UTRA PCR fragment from +3312 (PflMI) to +4100 (with NotI site added) of NF-L was cloned into the PflMI/NotI sites in the 3′-end of the marked NF-L gene to yield NF-L+. The sequence extended 74 bp beyond the polyadenylation signal (+4026) that forms the 2.5-kilobase NF-L mRNA. A 3′-UTR deletion was created by two-step PCR(22Schwartz M.L. Katagi C. Bruce J. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13444-13450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction A used an upstream primary containing the PflMI site (+3312) and a downstream antisense primer (number 3) that juxtaposed the 5′ (+3614) and 3′ (+3985) end points of the 3′-UTR deletion. Reaction B used a downstream primer with a NotI site (+4100) and an upstream sense primer (number 4) that was complementary to primer 3. The products of reactions A and B were used with the upstream (+3312) and downstream (+4100) primers in a third round of PCR to create a fragment with PFlMI/NotI ends but lacking 3′-UTR sequence from +3615 to +3984. This fragment was cloned into the NF-L marked gene to yield NF-L−.Generation of Transgenic MiceTransgenic mice were obtained by microinjecting male pronuclei of fertilized mouse eggs with marked NF-L genes that had been linearized by ApaI/NotI digestion, fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis, electroeluted, ethanol-precipitated, and passed through an Elutip ion exchange column (Schleicher and Schuell). Microinjections were conducted by the University of Pennsylvania Transgenic Mouse Core Facility on eggs harvested from superovulated B6SJLF1/J females mated with B6SJLF1/J males. Transgenic founder mice were identified by PCR analysis of genomic DNA using sense (+743/+767) and antisense (+892/+915) oligonucleotide primers that spanned the marked insert. Copy numbers were determined by a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager analysis of Southern blots using genomic DNA that had been cut with PvuII/StuI to liberate a 720-bp fragment from the endogenous NF-L gene (+391/+1101) and a 448-bp fragment from the marked NF-L transgene (+381/+829). Blots were probed with a PvuII/BglII (+391/+827) fragment that had been labeled with random primers to a specific activity of 109 dpm/μg. Founder mice were expanded by mating with B6SJF1/J mice.Transfection of CellsNeuro 2A, P19, and L cell lines, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), were cotransfected with the marked NF-L+ and NF-L− genes and a plasmid, pRc/CMV (Invitrogen), containing the Escherichia coli neo gene. Stable transformants were selected by growth in G418. Cells were transfected with DNA that was coprecipitated with calcium phosphate (21Shneidman P.S. Bruce J. Schwartz M.L. Schlaepfer W.W. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 13: 217-231Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or treated with Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Amounts of DNA and methods of transfection were optimized for each cell line. Stable transformants were pooled (from over 500 colonies) to reduce disparities in transgene copy number.RNA AnalysisTranscripts were analyzed by Northern blot and by protection assay as described previously(15Schwartz M.L. Shneidman P.S. Bruce J. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24596-24600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protection assays to assess endogenous and marked NF-L mRNAs were conducted with an antisense RNA probe that extended from +732 to +922 of the marked gene. The DNA template for this probe was generated by PCR using sense and antisense probes with EcoRI and BamHI sites and cloned into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of SK+ (Stratagene). cRNAs to NF-L and to a β-actin control were labeled with [32P]UTP to a specific activity of 5 × 108 cpm/μg.Transection of sciatic nerves and processing of axotomized and control L4/L5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were conducted, as described in rats (15Schwartz M.L. Shneidman P.S. Bruce J. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24596-24600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tissues from transgenic mice as well as cultured cells were solubilized in 4 M guanidinium thiocyanate and processed for RNA by phenol extraction(23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62986) Google Scholar). RNA (10-20 μg) was hybridized with NF-L and β-actin cRNAs (4 × 104 cpm/probe) in 20 μl containing 80% formamide, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 40 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, at 65°C for 14-18 h. Samples were digested with RNase T1 (15Schwartz M.L. Shneidman P.S. Bruce J. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24596-24600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or with S1 (300 units/200 μl) for 30 min at 37°C, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and precipitated with ethanol. Protected fragments were resolved on acrylamide/urea gels, and radioactivities were quantitated by phosphor-imaging analysis.RESULTSExpression of NF-L+and NF-L−Transgenes in Transfected CellsNF-L+ and NF-L− transgenes were constructed from mouse genomic sequence (19Lewis S.A.

The NF-L+ transgene contained the complete 3′-UTR sequence, whereas in the NF-L− transgene the sequence between +3615 (immediately 3′ to the TGA stop codon) and +3984 (40 bp upstream of the first polyadenylation signal) was deleted. Northern blots of stably transfected L cells (which only express the transgenes) show that the NF-L+ transgenes generate a single mRNA species that comigrates with the 2.5-kilobase NF-L mRNA isoform of mouse spinal cord, while the NF-L− transgene produces a single mRNA species of about 2.1 kilobases (data not shown).The NF-L transgenes also contained an insert at the BglII site (+829) that enables transcripts from the transgenes and endogenous mouse NF-L gene to be distinguished by RNase protection assay (see Fig. 1). With an antisense probe that spans the insertion site, fragments of 190 and 110 nucleotides are generated from the transgene and endogenous mouse NF-L genes, respectively. Protection assays show that NF-L+ and NF-L− mRNAs are readily expressed in stably transfected L cells and are coexpressed with endogenous mouse NF-L mRNA in P19 cells (Fig. 2). The NF-L+ and NF-L− transgenes generate similar steady-state mRNA levels in L cells but not in P19 cell lines. Levels of NF-L− mRNA are higher than NF-L+ mRNA in stably transformed P19 cells even though the lines were derived from pooled transformants and contained similar average copy numbers of the respective transgenes (5-10 copies/pool). The presence of NF-L+ or NF-L− increased levels of endogenous NF-L (Fig. 2), whereas the presence of NF-L− also increased levels of NF-M and NF-H mRNA (data not shown).Figure 2Protection assay showing mRNA levels of NF-L transgene (NF-L∗), endogenous NF-L (NF-L), and β-actin (β-actin) in untransfected L cells (lane 2), L cells transfected with NF-L+ (lane 3) or NF-L− (lane 4) in untransfected P19/clone 48 cells (lane 5), P19/clone 48 cells transfected with NF-L+ (lane 6) or NF-L− (lane 7) in untransfected P19/clone 43 cells (lane 8), P19/clone 43 cells transfected with NF-L+ (lane 9) or NF-L− (lane 10). Lane 1 shows undigested probes for NF-L∗/NF-L and β-actin. These probes generate protected fragments of 190 bp for the marked transgenes (NF-L∗), 97 bp for endogenous NF-L (NF-L), and 83 bp for β-actin (β-actin). P19/clone 48 and P19/clone 43 express low levels of NF-L. P19/clone 43 also expresses low levels of NF-M and NF-H.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression of NF-L+and NF-L−Transgenes in Transgenic MiceNF-L+ and NF-L− sequence (−325/+4100) were excised from the parent plasmids, purified, and used to create transgenic mice. Introduction of NF-L+ into the mouse germ line produced four founder mice (of 22 pups) and established three transgenic lines (A, B, and C). Separate microinjections of the NF-L− yielded three (of 42 pups), two (of 27 pups), and one (of 17 pups) founder mice. Three lines (D, E, and F) of NF-L− were established. All lines (A-F) contained two to four copies of integrated transgenes.Expression of the transgene versus endogenous NF-L genes was analyzed in neural and non-neural tissues of F1 adult mice from each cell line by RNase protection assay. Transgene expression was detected in every line, most readily in brain and spinal cord, but levels of expression did not correlate with transgene copy number. Steady state levels of NF-L− mRNA were, on average, at least 2-fold higher than that of NF-L+ mRNA. Ectopic expression occurred in non-neural tissue but at levels that were at least 10-fold lower than that of brain and spinal cord. Minute amounts of transgene mRNA were detected in thymus, kidney, lung, testis, spleen, and liver.Lines A and D expressed the highest levels of NF-L+ and NF-L− transgenes and were used to assess the effects of 3′-UTR deletion on the regional expression of the transgenes in the nervous system. Both NF-L+ and NF-L− transgenes showed similar rank order patterns of expression relative to the expression of the endogenous NF-L gene (Fig. 3). Increased transgene/endogenous mRNA expression was also noted in brain versus spinal cord tissues of other transgenic lines (data not shown). The findings indicate that the NF-L+ and NF-L− transgenes are expressed in a similar distribution, albeit at differing levels, in the nervous system. Although the expression of the transgenes differed from that of the endogenous NF-L gene, the differences were not due to deletion of the 3′-UTR. Interestingly, the pattern of NF-L transgene expression is consistent with that of other neuronal transgenes that have been examined at the cellular level (see (24Mandel G. McKinnon D. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 323-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)), namely partial (or mosaic) expression in neurons that express the endogenous gene and ectopic expression in neurons that do not express the endogenous gene.Figure 3Expression of NF-L− (panel A) and NF-L+ (panel B) transgenes in different regions of the nervous system. Protection assay shows mRNA levels of NF-L− or NF-L+ transgenes relative to endogenous NF-L (NF-L) mRNA in cerebrum (lane 1), cerebellum (lane 2), brainstem (lane 3), spinal cord (lane 4), and dorsal root ganglia (lane 5) of adult transgenic mice from line D (NF-L−) and line A (NF-L+).

Endogenous NF-L mRNA, present in E11 mouse brain(25Julien J-P. Meyer D. Flavell D. Hurst J. Grosvelt F. Mol. Brain Res. 1986; 1: 243-250Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar), is readily detected in brain and spinal cord of transgenic mice at E15 and remains at about the same level at E18 and P2 (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5). NF-L+ mRNA is also detected in brain and spinal cord at E15 and remains at roughly the same level at E18 and P2. NF-L− mRNA is also present at E15 but undergoes a 2-fold increase by E18 and a 3-fold increase by P2 in both brain and spinal cord. Similar up-regulations of NF-L− mRNA in brain and spinal cord at E18 and P2 were also observed in brain and spinal cord in a second line (F) of transgenic mice (data not shown). NF-L− and NF-L+ mRNAs were also expressed at very low levels in liver at E15, but no consistent developmental up-regulation of ectopic liver expression was detected (data not shown). Comparative analyses of mRNA levels at P2, P10, and P20 indicate that endogenous NF-L mRNA increases in spinal cord and brain at P10 and at P20 and that NF-L+ and NF-L− mRNAs are also up-regulated at these time points. The extent of postnatal up-regulation at P10 and P20 varied among individual mice but, on average, was similar for endogenous NF-L and for the NF-L+ and NF-L− transgenes in brain and in spinal cord.Figure 4Developmental expression of transgene versus endogenous NF-L mRNAs in brain of F2 mice bearing NF-L− (panel A) and NF-L+ (panel B) transgenes at embryonic day 15 (lanes 1-4), embryonic day 18 (lanes 5-8), and postnatal day 2 (lanes 9-12).

Preliminary studies on non-transgenic littermates showed that the down-regulation of NF-L, NF-M, and NF-H mRNAs in axotomized sensory neurons (15Schwartz M.L. Shneidman P.S. Bruce J. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24596-24600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is reproduced in the mouse but that the extent of NF down-regulation at 4 and 7 days after transection is less (50-60% of control) than that of the rat (30-40% of control). Differences in axotomy-induced down-regulation may reflect variable numbers of rat or mouse L4/L5 DRG neurons that are not axotomized by a sciatic nerve transection at the level of the sciatic notch.Analyses of NF-L expression in transgenic mice (line A) show that NF-L+ mRNA and endogenous NF-L mRNA are down-regulated in axotomized sensory neurons at 4 days (data not shown) and at 7 days (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 2) after sciatic nerve transection. In mice bearing the NF-L− transgene (line D), mRNA from the endogenous NF-L gene but not from the transgene is down-regulated at 4 days (data not shown) and at 7 days (Fig. 6, lanes 3 and 4) after axotomy. Down-regulation of endogenous NF-L mRNA but not NF-L− mRNA also occurs in sensory neurons of line E (Fig. 6, lanes 5 and 6) and line F (Fig. 6, lanes 7 and 8) at 7 days following sciatic nerve transection.Figure 6Panel A, the expression of NF-L transgene (NF-L∗), endogenous NF-L (NF-L), and β-actin (β-actin) mRNAs in axotomized (lanes A) versus control (lanes C) L4/L5 DRG at 7 days after unilateral sciatic nerve transection. Axotomy-induced changes were examined in a transgenic mouse line (panel A) bearing the NF-L+ transgene (lanes 1 and 2) and in three lines (lines D, E, and F) bearing the NF-L− transgene (lanes 3 and 4, 5 and 6, and 7 and 8, respectively). Protection assay generates fragments of 190 nucleotides (NF-L∗) from NF-L+ and NF-L− mRNAs, 97 nucleotides (NF-L) from endogenous NF-L mRNA, and 83 nucleotides (β-actin) from β-actin mRNA.

When compared with β-actin mRNA levels, mRNA from the NF-L+ transgene showed a steady decline (6 h, estimated half-life) whereas mRNA levels from the NF-L− transgene remained comparable with those of β-actin (18-24 h, estimated half-life). Although expressed at much lower levels, the decay rate of endogenous NF-L mRNA was similar to that of the NF-L+ transgene. The results indicate that deletion of the 3′-UTR stabilizes NF-L transcripts in P19 cells and is likely to be responsible for the increased steady state NF-L−/NF-L+ mRNA levels in transfected cells.Figure 7Protection assay showing mRNA levels of NF-L+and NF-L− transgenes (NF-L∗), endogenous NF-L (NF-L), and β-actin (β-actin) in P19/clone 48 cells transfected with NF-L+ or NF-L− following the addition of 4 μg/ml actinomycin.

NF-L transgenes with (NF-L+) or without (NF-L−) 3′-UTR are expressed in a neuron- specific manner, like other human and mouse NF-L transgenes with similar or more extensive 5′- and 3′-flanking sequence(26Julien J-P.

https://openalex.org/W2025919316,"We transfected the cDNA for the cell-to-cell channel protein connexin-43 (Cx43) into Morris hepatoma H5123 cells, which express little Cx43 and lack gap junctional communication (open cell-to-cell channels). We found that cells overexpressing Cx43 nonetheless lacked open cell-to-cell channels, but that inhibition of glycosylation by tunicamycin induced open channels in these cells. Tunicamycin also induced biochemical changes in Cx43 protein; the level increased, and a considerable fraction became phosphorylated and Triton X-100 insoluble, in contrast to untreated cells where Cx43 was non-phosphorylated and Triton X-100 soluble. Although tunicamycin caused the formation of open channels, channels were not found aggregated into gap junctional plaques, as they are when they have been induced by elevation of intracellular cAMP. The results suggest that although Cx43 itself is not glycosylated, other glycosylated proteins influence Cx43 posttranslational modification and the formation of Cx43 cell-to-cell channels."
https://openalex.org/W2071932919,"We have investigated the phosphorylation of γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor purified from bovine cerebral cortex in the absence of added kinases. Incubation of the affinity-purified receptor with [γ-32P]ATP and 500 μM MnCl2 yielded incorporation of 0.45 mol of 32P/mol of muscimol binding sites within 2 h at 30°C. Mn2+ was much more effective than Mg2+ as activator. Phosphorylation of the receptor was observed on at least three different polypeptides of 51, 53, and 55 kDa. It was predominant on 51- and 53-kDa polypeptides that co-migrate with the [3H]flunitrazepam photoaffinity-labeled bands, suggesting that 32P incorporation mainly occurs on α-subunits. A monoclonal antibody specific for α-subunits adsorbed the endogenously phosphorylated GABAA receptor with a stoichiometry close to 1 mol of phosphate/mol of muscimol. The phosphorylation of the 51-kDa polypeptide, corresponding to α1-subunit, exhibited a micromolar affinity for ATP and sigmoid kinetics (nH = 2). Major incorporation of phosphate occurred on serine and threonine residues in roughly equimolar ratio. By enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting studies we also detected a minor incorporation on tyrosine residues; this was specific for a 55-kDa polypeptide. Comparison with molecular data suggests that at least α1- and α2-subunits (Ser and Thr residues) and possibly γ2-subunits (Tyr residue) are endogenously phosphorylated by multiple kinases, with a clear preference for α1-subunit. The β-subunits were not phosphorylated in our experimental conditions. The corresponding kinase activities are closely associated to the receptor protein, indicating a new complexity in the regulation of the GABAA receptor. We have investigated the phosphorylation of γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor purified from bovine cerebral cortex in the absence of added kinases. Incubation of the affinity-purified receptor with [γ-32P]ATP and 500 μM MnCl2 yielded incorporation of 0.45 mol of 32P/mol of muscimol binding sites within 2 h at 30°C. Mn2+ was much more effective than Mg2+ as activator. Phosphorylation of the receptor was observed on at least three different polypeptides of 51, 53, and 55 kDa. It was predominant on 51- and 53-kDa polypeptides that co-migrate with the [3H]flunitrazepam photoaffinity-labeled bands, suggesting that 32P incorporation mainly occurs on α-subunits.

Here we show that these functional effects of TCR-mediated signaling are associated with the accumulation of several cytosolic mRNA-binding proteins including the previously described AU-A, -B, and -C proteins as well as a novel 70-kDa protein. The results indicate that the 70-kDa protein derived from a 90-kDa precursor present in unactivated T cells and that both proteins bound to two independent sites at the 3′-end of the interleukin-2 mRNA, one in the coding region and the other in an AU-rich segment of the 3′-untranslated region. Glucocorticoids, TCR engagement by monoclonal antibodies, pharmocologic mimics of TCR signaling, or high concentrations of protein or RNA synthesis inhibitors all induced apoptosis, the cytosolic appearance of the RNA-binding proteins, and an increased rate of RNA turnover. Moreover, drugs that interfere with TCR-mediated signals, such as cyclosporin A and staurosporin, prevented both apoptosis and the appearance of the RNA-binding factors. The fact that the accumulation of these factors occurred in the presence of inhibitors of transcription and translation suggested that these proteins are present in an inactive form in unstimulated T cells and are activated when apoptosis is induced.

Several hormonal and developmental signals have been shown to modulate gene expression by altering mRNA stability or mRNA degradation(1Williams D.L. Sensel M. McTigue M. Binder R. Belasco J. Brawerman G. Control of Messanger RNA Stability. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1993: 161-198Google Scholar). Post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA expression has been shown to play an important role in controlling the level of rapidly induced mRNAs. This level of regulation is particularly important for proteins that are active for brief periods, such as growth factors, transcription factors, and proteins that control cell cycle progression(1Williams D.L. Sensel M. McTigue M. Binder R. Belasco J. Brawerman G. Control of Messanger RNA Stability. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1993: 161-198Google Scholar). mRNA stability is controlled by specific cis-acting elements including an AU-rich sequence that is found in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) 1The abbreviations used are: UTRuntranslated regionTCRT cell antigen receptormAbmonoclonal antibodyAREAU-rich elementDRB5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole ribosideIL-2interleukin-2. of a variety of unstable mRNAs (2Greenberg M.E.

These elements are thought to target mRNA to rapid degradation by binding proteins involved in RNA turnover(4Sachs A.

Apoptotic cells have an increased rate of RNA turnover, and it has been suggested that RNA degradation could play a role in the progression to cell death(11Cidlowski J.A.

In the immune system, apoptosis is thought to be involved in the elimination of potentially destructive, self-reactive immature lymphocytes (14Krammer P.H. Behrmann I. Daniel P. Dhein J. Debatin K.-M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and excess effector lymphocytes that are generated in primary immune responses(13Ashwell J.D. Snow E.C. Handbook of B and T lymphocytes. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 63-89Crossref Google Scholar, 14Krammer P.H. Behrmann I. Daniel P. Dhein J. Debatin K.-M. Curr. Opin.

Apoptosis can be induced experimentally in T lymphocytes by withdrawal of growth factors, glucocorticoid treatment, heat shock, and UV-induced DNA damage or, in dividing cells, as a consequence of antigen receptor-mediated activation(13Ashwell J.D. Snow E.C. Handbook of B and T lymphocytes. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 63-89Crossref Google Scholar, 16Vaux D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 786-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). An early marker of the death program is the activation of an endonuclease that cleaves chromosomal DNA between nucleosomes, yielding DNA multimers of 200 base pairs. DNA fragmentation is then followed by a variety of morphological changes that include condensation of the cytoplasm, swelling of the endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane blebbing, nuclear shrinkage, and the formation of dense chromatin masses known as apoptotic bodies. This process eventually leads to cell lysis. Apoptosis can be induced in vitro in actively proliferating murine T cell hybridomas by exposure to antigen or mAb directed against the TCR or the CD3 components of the TCR(17Ashwell J.D. Cunningham R.E. Noguchi P.D. Hernandez D. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 173-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In this system, TCR signaling initially results in a G1/S cell cycle block followed by genomic DNA fragmentation(18Mercep M. Noguchi P.D. Ashwell J.D. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 4085-4092PubMed Google Scholar). At low concentrations, drugs that inhibit transcription and translation prevent the TCR-induced DNA fragmentation, suggesting that the expression of new gene products is required for TCR-induced apoptosis (19Ucker D. Ashwell J.A. Nickas G. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 3461-3469PubMed Google Scholar). However, at higher concentrations, inhibitors of transcription and translation cause DNA fragmentation directly (18Mercep M. Noguchi P.D. Ashwell J.D. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 4085-4092PubMed Google Scholar) through an unknown mechanism. Here we show that in T cell hybridomas, TCR-generated signals result in the cytosolic accumulation of several previously described AU-specific RNA-binding proteins and a novel 70-kDa protein that is capable of binding the AU-rich element within the IL-2 3′-UTR as well a second site within the IL-2 coding region. The coordinate appearance of these RNA-binding proteins correlated with a shorter half-life of IL-2 mRNA, an increased rate of RNA degradation, and the induction of apoptotic cell death. It is therefore possible that RNA-binding proteins are involved in apoptosis-related RNA degradation. The A.AE7.2 T cell hybridoma was obtained by fusing the pigeon cytochrome c-specific T cell clone A.E7 to the TCR- BW 1100 thymoma as described previously(20DeSilva D.R. Urdahl K.B. Jenkins M.K. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3261-3267PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Celox, Hopkins, MN) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1 mM HEPES, nonessential amino acids, 2 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mML-glutamine, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 20 mg/ml gentamicin, and 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol at 37°C in a 10% CO2 atmosphere. The nontransformed A.E7 T cell clone was maintained in Eagle's Hank's amino acid (EHAA) medium (Celox, Hopkins, MN) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum by periodic stimulation with pigeon cytochrome c and splenic antigen-presenting cells as described previously(21Hecht T.T. Longo D.L. Matis L.A. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 1049-1054PubMed Google Scholar). A.E7 cells were used in experiments at least 10 days after their last exposure to antigen and were in the Go/G1 stage of the cell cycle at this time. Total RNA was isolated from 5 × 106 cells using RNAzol B (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). Typically 20 μg of RNA was run on a 1.2% formaldehyde-formamide gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and UV cross-linked to the membrane using a Stratalinker device (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP with the Prime-It® II random primer kit (Stratagene). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed on a Sephadex G-50 column (Nuc Trap® purification columns, Stratagene). Denatured probe was hybridized to the filter-bound RNA according to the QuickHyb protocol (Stratagene). Following washing, the membrane was exposed to x-ray film with an intensifying screen, and the specific bands were detected by autoradiography. To measure the half-life of IL-2 mRNA, cells were incubated for 3, 6, or 8 h on immobilized anti-CD3 mAb, and then transcription was blocked by the addition of 0.2 μg/ml of cyclosporin A(22Umlaf, S. W., Beverly, B., Kang, S.-M., Brorson, K., Tran, A.-C., Schwartz, R. H., Immunol. Rev., 133, 177-197.Google Scholar). Total RNA was then isolated after 20, 40, 80, and 120 min and analyzed by Northern blot. The intensity of the bands present on autoradiograms was determined by densitometry and image analysis using the Image 1.47 program. The values for IL-2 mRNA were normalized to values for β-actin mRNA, the expression of which did not change throughout the experiment. Cells (1-2 × 106/well) were incubated in 1 ml of medium at 37°C for 2-24 h in 24-well plates that were coated (5 μg/ml of purified antibody for 1 h at 37°C) with a mAb (clone 145-2C11) specific for the CD3-ɛ component of the TCR. In some experiments, actinomycin D, DRB, cycloheximide, emetine (all obtained from Sigma), dexamethasone sodium phosphate (American Reagents Laboratories, Shirley, NY), or cyclosporin A were added at the time the cultures were initiated. After the stimulation period, the cells were collected, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 50 μl of 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 40 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiotreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 5-10 min on ice. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 s in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. The nuclei were then lysed in 25 μl of a hypertonic buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 420 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 25% glycerol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 30 min in ice and then centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 rpm at 4°C to remove the insoluble fraction. Cytosolic and nuclear extracts were then frozen and stored at −70°C. The protein concentration of each extract was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). An RNA oligonucleotide encompassing the ARE of the mouse IL-2 3′-UTR was chemically synthesized and labeled by an in vitro kinase reaction in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 7,000 Ci/mmol, ICN). The 32P-labeled oligonucleotide was separated from unincorporated nucleotides by chromatography on a Nuctrap G-50 column (Stratagene). The mouse c-myc cDNA template was obtained by annealing two single-stranded oligonucleotides encompassing the previously described AU-A-binding region (8Bohjanen P.R. Petryniak B. June C.H. Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3288-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and subcloning the resulting double-stranded oligonucleotide into the pGEM-3 vector. The oligonucleotides were designed with a PstI site at the 3′-end that was used to linearize the construct for in vitro transcription. The HindIII-PstI fragment of the mouse IL-2 cDNA, or polymerase chain reaction products containing progressive deletions at the 5′- or 3′-ends of this fragment, were subcloned into the pGEM-3 vector. Recombinant IL-2 plasmids were linearized with SpeI, SspI, RsaI, TaqI, and DdeI for in vitro run-off transcription reactions that were performed using the SP6 RNA polymerase according to the Promega (Madison, WI) protocol. Labeled RNA transcripts with a specific activity of 0.2-0.6 × 109 cpm/μg were generated by inclusion of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.) in the transcription reaction. Unlabeled RNAs used in the competition assays were transcribed with the RiboMax(TM) Promega kit, and the concentration was determined by spectrophotometric analysis. The RNA probes used in these studies are shown in Fig. 1. 5 μg of cytosolic extracts were incubated with 32P-labeled RNA (105 cpm) in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml heparan sulfate (to reduce nonspecific binding) in a total volume of 10 μl in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube at room temperature for 10 min. The IL-2 RNA probe encompassing the HindIII-SpeI sites was used in UV cross-linking experiments unless otherwise indicated. Subsequently, the RNA-protein complexes were cross-linked in ice for 5 min with 254-nm UV radiation in a Stratalinker cross-linking apparatus (Stratagene). RNase A was then added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, and the reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37°C to allow digestion of unbound RNA. The samples were boiled in the presence of an equal volume of 2× Laemli buffer (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207129) Google Scholar) for 5 min and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was run for 3-4 h at 30 mA, dried, and exposed to Kodak film at −70°C with an intensifying screen for 12-24 h. The RNA-protein complexes were covalently linked by UV cross-linking as described above. The specific bands were identified by autoradiography, and the corresponding gel slices were excised, rehydrated in 50 μl of Cleveland buffer (50Cleveland D.W. Fisher S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cut into small pieces. The pieces were then loaded on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins were allowed to enter the gel by electrophoresis. 1, 10, or 100 ng of V8 protease in 50 μl of Cleveland buffer (50Cleveland D.W. Fisher S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were then loaded into the wells, and the gel was run until the samples reached the interface between the stacking and the running gel. At this point, the run was stopped for 30 min to allow the V8 protease digestion to occur. The gel was then run, dried, and exposed to x-ray film as described above. Cells (0.5-2 × 106) were stimulated for various times in 24-well plates, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 30 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% laurylsarcosinate (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K and incubated for 2-10 h at 50°C. 10 μl of 0.5 mg/ml RNase A was then added, and the digestion was performed for 2 h at 50°C. 5 μl of loading buffer (10 mM EDTA, 0.25 mM bromphenol blue, 40% sucrose) was added to the sample that was then heated to 65°C for 15 min and run on a 1.8% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml of ethidium bromide. The DNA was visualized by photographing the gel on a UV light box. Cellular DNA or RNA was labeled by pulsing 106 cells with 5 μCi of [3H]thymidine or [3H]uridine in 1 ml of complete medium for 2 h at 37°C. After three washes, 5 × 104 labeled cells were distributed in triplicate in a 96-well microtiter plates in the presence of various stimuli. After 8 h, cell-associated high molecular weight DNA or RNA was harvested onto fiberglass filters and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting as described previously (24Matzinger P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 145: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). A reduction in the amount of radioactivity present in high molecular weight DNA or RNA after culture with a given stimulus was taken as evidence of DNA or RNA degradation, respectively. IL-2 mRNA was detectable in anti-CD3-stimulated T hybridoma cells after 2 h, was maximally expressed after 4 h, and then declined thereafter (Fig. 2A). Because growth factor mRNAs are often regulated by RNA stability, we tested whether an increased rate of mRNA degradation may explain the rapid disappearance of IL-2 mRNA that occurs after peak expression. IL-2 mRNA decay rates were measured by terminating transcription with cyclosporin A (22Umlaf, S. W., Beverly, B., Kang, S.-M., Brorson, K., Tran, A.-C., Schwartz, R. H., Immunol. Rev., 133, 177-197.Google Scholar) after 3-4 h of activation with anti-CD3 mAb, the time of peak mRNA accumulation, or after 6-8 h, during the decline phase. The amount of IL-2 mRNA remaining at various later times was then measured by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2B, the half-life of IL-2 mRNA present after 3-4 h of TCR stimulation was significantly longer than the half-life of the IL-2 mRNA present after 6-8 h of TCR stimulation (60.5 ± 2.5 and 45.2 ± 4.7 min, respectively, mean ± S.D., p < 0.005, based on a two-sample t test). The fact that IL-2 mRNA became increasingly unstable as the total amount of IL-2 mRNA decreased indicated that RNA destabilizing factors were induced late in the response. In an attempt to define the molecular basis for the drop in the steady-state levels of IL-2 mRNA, we searched for proteins that bind to IL-2 mRNA and might be involved in RNA destabilization. IL-2 mRNA contains four AUUUA sequences in the 3′-UTR that have been suggested to function as binding sites for RNA-binding proteins involved in mRNA turnover(4Sachs A. Cell. 1993; 74: 413-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Extracts from resting or activated cells were incubated with a 32P-labeled riboprobe consisting of 278 bases from IL-2 mRNA that contains the four AUUUA sequences clustered together in the 3′-UTR (HindIII-SpeI, Fig. 1). The RNA-protein complexes were detected in SDS-gels following UV cross-linking and RNase A digestion. RNase A was used at a concentration that would be expected to completely degrade all portions of the probe that were not protected by the protein, minimizing the contribution of the bound RNA to the molecular weight of the complex. Cytosolic extracts from unstimulated T cells reproducibly contained proteins with molecular masses of 90, 65, 40-50, and 34 kDa that could be cross-linked to this RNA (Fig. 3A). Digestion of the reaction mixtures with proteinase K eliminated the labeled complexes, confirming that these factors are at least partially composed of protein (data not shown). Cytosolic extracts from T cells stimulated for 6, 8, or 10 h with anti-CD3 mAb reproducibly showed no change in the 65-kDa protein, a decrease in the 90-kDa protein, and an increase in the 34- and 40-50-kDa proteins when compared with extracts from resting T cells. The extracts from stimulated T cells also contained novel proteins of 70 and 30 kDa. An identical pattern was obtained with another independently derived T cell hybridoma (Fig. 3B). Although other bands were detected in some experiments, only the 90-, 70-, 40-50-, 34-, and 30-kDa proteins were reproducibly present in cytosolic extracts in all experiments, although the 30-kDa protein was not clearly resolved from the 34-kDa protein in some cases. Nuclear extracts from resting or activated T cells showed a complex pattern of RNA-binding proteins that only partially overlapped with the proteins detected in cytosolic extracts (compare Fig. 3C with 3A and 3B). The most prominent nuclear RNA-binding protein co-migrated with the 34-kDa protein observed in cytosolic extracts (Fig. 3C). Since the 34-, 30-, and 40-50-kDa proteins share many of the features of the AU-A, AU-B, and AU-C proteins described by Bohjanen et al. (8, see “Discussion”), they will hereafter be referred to as AU-A, AU-B, and AU-C, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3A, the inducible RNA-binding proteins (70, 40-50, 34, and 30 kDa) were first detected after 6 h of TCR simulation and achieved maximal levels at 8 h. The amounts of the 40-50-, 34-, and 30-kDa proteins returned to basal levels after 24 h, whereas the 70-kDa protein remained detectable at this time point. Therefore, the appearance of the inducible RNA-binding factors correlated with the times at which IL-2 mRNA became less stable (compare Fig. 2B and Fig. 3A). The appearance of the 70-kDa complex following anti-CD3 mAb stimulation often correlated with a decrease in the 90-kDa complex (Fig. 3A). This suggested that the protein present in the 70-kDa complex could be derived from the 90-kDa complex. Partial V8 protease digestion of the 70- and 90-kDa RNA-protein complexes (produced by UV cross-linking using a 32P-labeled IL-2 RNA and cytosolic extracts from resting or activated T cells) generated overlapping sets of peptide fragments (Fig. 4). Thus, the proteins in the two complexes are highly related to each other at least in their RNA binding domains. Similar V8 protease experiments were performed on gel slices corresponding to AU-A and AU-B. As shown in Fig. 4, these two proteins showed distinct protease patterns as reported previously (9Bohjanen P.R. Petryniak B. June C.H. Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6302-6309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and do not appear to be related to the 70- and 90-kDa proteins. To further characterize the fine specificity of these RNA-binding proteins, competition experiments were performed by including unlabeled RNAs in the binding reactions. Cytosolic extracts from activated cells were incubated with a 32P-labeled IL-2 riboprobe containing the entire AUUUA-rich region (IL-2 SpeI in Fig. 1) in the absence or in the presence of a 10, 100, or 500× molar excess of unlabeled IL-2 RNAs containing different numbers of AUUUA sequences. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, only the unlabeled IL-2 SpeI RNA with four AUUUA elements and an unlabeled 39-base RNA oligonucleotide containing the four AUUUA elements and only 5 additional bases at each end (IL-2 RNA oligo ARE in Fig. 1) were able to inhibit the binding of AU-A and AU-B proteins to the 32P-labeled IL-2 SpeI riboprobe. The RNAs with no (IL-2 RsaI in Fig. 1) or two (IL-2 SspI in Fig. 1) AUUUA elements did not compete even at the highest concentration tested. These results are consistent with the previous observation that AU-A and AU-B bind to synthetic RNAs with at least three tandem repeats of the AUUUA sequence(12Owens G.P. Hahn W.E. Cohen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4177-4188Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). These proteins were also detected in UV cross-linking experiments using the 32P end-labeled RNA oligonucleotide as a probe (data not shown), providing further evidence that they bind specifically to the AUUUA-rich sequence. The 90- and 70-kDa complexes had a different specificity. The cross-linking of these proteins to the 32P-labeled 278-base IL-2 SpeI riboprobe (see Fig. 1) that contains four AUUUA elements was inhibited by the unlabeled IL-2 SpeI RNA (Fig. 5A) and by the 39-base RNA oligonucleotide that also contains the 4 AUUUA elements (Fig. 5B). Although these proteins could be cross-linked directly to the 32P-labeled 39-base IL-2 RNA oligonucleotide (data not shown), suggesting that they can bind to the minimal ARE sequence, they were not competed as efficiently as AU-A and AU-B by the cold oligonucleotide (Fig. 5B). In addition, unlabeled RNAs containing two (IL-2 SspI) or no (IL-2 RsaI) AUUUA elements inhibited the cross-linking of the 70- and 90-kDa proteins to the 32P-labeled IL-2 SpeI RNA (Fig. 5A), indicating that these proteins also bind to a sequence outside the ARE. The 70- and 90-kDa proteins were not degenerate RNA-binding proteins, however, in that their binding to the 32P-labeled IL-2 SpeI RNA was not inhibited by an unlabeled c-myc RNA that was an efficient inhibitor of the binding of both AU-A and AU-B (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that AU-A and AU-B proteins bind only to the ARE but do not discriminate between IL-2 and c-myc mRNAs, whereas the 90- and 70-kDa bind specifically to IL-2 mRNA but appear to bind the ARE and another site. [32P]UTP-labeled riboprobes corresponding to various portions of the 3′-end of the IL-2 mRNA were used to identify the non-ARE p90/p70 binding site. As shown in Fig. 6, and as summarized in Fig. 1, the 90- and 70-kDa proteins, but not AU-A, -B, or -C, could be cross-linked to a 56-nucleotide segment spanning nucleotides 508-564 at the 3′-end of the IL-2 coding region. In contrast, AU-A, -B, and -C, but not p90 and p70, bound to a c-myc RNA. All of the RNA-binding proteins bound to an IL-2 probe spanning nucleotides 508-660 that contains the ARE, and p90 and p70 could be cross-linked to this RNA better than to the RNA spanning nucleotides 508-564 that lacks the ARE. Together, our results show that p90 and p70 bind independently to two different elements in the IL-2 mRNA, one encompassing nucleotides 508-564, and the other encompassing nucleotides 589-627 that contains the ARE. In contrast, AU-A, -B, and -C bind only to the IL-2 ARE containing greater than 2 AUUUA repeats. TCR-mediated signaling involves protein kinase C activation and increased intracellular calcium, which in turn activates the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (25Weiss A. Littmen D. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar). Cyclosporin A is known to bind cyclophilin and to inhibit the activity of calcineurin, thus preventing the signal transduction cascade and downstream events such as IL-2 production(26Liu J.

As shown in Fig. 7A, the induction of all of the RNA-binding proteins by anti-CD3 mAb-stimulation was blocked by cyclosporin A. A similar inhibition was observed when the protein kinase C-inhibitor, staurosporin was used (Fig. 8B). Moreover, when phorbol myristate acetate, a protein kinase C activator, and a calcium ionophore were used together, but not separately, to stimulate the cells, the same RNA-binding proteins induced by anti-CD3 mAb were detected in the cytosol (data not shown). These results suggest that both protein kinase C activation and calcium-dependent events are necessary and sufficient to activate these cytosolic RNA-binding factors.Figure 8Dexamethasone induces DNA fragmentation and the RNA-binding proteins in T cell hybridomas and in nontransformed T cells.

INTRODUCTIONDoc is one of 50 or more mobile DNA elements that have been identified in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (Finnegan and Fawcett, 1986). Doc elements lack terminal repeats, instead terminating at the 3′ end in runs of adenine residues flanked by polyadenylation signals. They differ in size, being variously truncated at the 5′ end, and are flanked by target site duplications which vary in length from 10 to 14 bp 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pairs(s)LINElong interspersed nuclear elementS2Schneider cells line 2LTRlong terminal repeat, Inr, initiatorhsp70heat shock protein 70 geneUTRuntranslated regionCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseRSVRous sarcoma viruskbkilobase(s)DEdistal elementHIV-1human immunodeficiency virus 1. (Schneuwly et al., 1987; Driver et al., 1989). Complete family members are Ȭ4.7 kb in length and potentially encode a putative nucleic acid binding protein and a reverse transcriptase (O'Hare et al., 1991). The structure and coding capacity of Doc is typical of LINEs, nomadic DNA sequences conserved in evolution from protozoa to man (Doolittle et al., 1989; Xiong and Eickbush, 1990). LINEs, also known as type II retrotransposons, use self-encoded proteins to reverse transcribe their own mRNA and integrate cDNA copies at new locations in the genome. This hypothesis has been experimentally supported by the analysis of transgenic flies carrying intron-marked Drosophila I factors (Pelisson et al., 1991; Jensen and Heidmann, 1991) and baby hamster kidney cells transfected with mouse LINE-1 elements (Evans and Palmiter, 1991).Mammalian genomes harbor >105 LINEs that belong to a single superfamily (Singer and Skowronski, 1985; Hutchison et al., 1989). By contrast, distinct LINE families, each including 50-80 members, coexist in D. melanogaster. In addition to Doc, six other families of LINE elements have been described so far in this organism, including the I factor (Fawcett et al., 1986), F (Di Nocera and Casari, 1987), G (Di Nocera, 1988), and jockey (Priimagi et al., 1988) elements, and type I and type II ribosomal DNA insertions (Jacubczak et al., 1990).LINEs differ markedly from other mobile DNA sequences that also propagate by the retrotranscription of RNA intermediates such as copia-like elements in D. melanogaster (Finnegan and Fawcett, 1986) and the Ty element (Boeke et al., 1985) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These elements, also known as viral retrotransposons, resemble the integrated genomes of retroviruses as they carry LTRs. LINEs lack LTRs, and their expression is controlled by promoters which are located within the transcribed region (Mizrokhi et al., 1988; Swergold, 1990; Minchiotti and Di Nocera, 1991; Minakami et al., 1992; Contursi et al., 1993; McLean et al., 1993).By means of transient transfection assays we monitored the expression of constructs in which the reporter CAT gene was under the control of various Doc DNA segments in Drosophila Schneider II (S2) cells. We show that distinct cis-acting DNA elements, clustered in a Ȭ50-bp long DNA region located at the 5′ end of unit-length Doc copies, cooperate to control RNA initiation. In addition, we found that sequences located Ȭ200 bp downstream from the 5′ end inhibit the expression of the reporter CAT gene in a position- and orientation-dependent manner. The inhibition appears to be due to reduced translation rather than to impaired synthesis of CAT mRNA.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmidsThe clones suN, 6N, and 11N, in which the 5′ end regions of the elements su(f)S2, Doc6, and Doc11, respectively, precede the CAT gene, were obtained by cloning SalI-NaeI (suN), XhoI-NaeI (6N), and EcoRI-NaeI(11N) fragments, isolated, respectively, from pDoc, λDoc6, and λDoc11, into the AvaI site of pEMBL8CAT. pDoc, λDoc6, and λDoc11, described in Driver et al.(1989), were kindly provided by Dr. Kevin O'Hare. The clones suA, 11A, and 6A were obtained by cloning an EcoRI-AluI fragment from suN (suA), or AluI fragments from either 6N (6A) or 11N (11A), into the BamHI site of pEMBL8CAT. Plasmids su132 and su218 carry DNA fragments that span the 5′ end region of su(f)S2 and terminate 3′ at residue 132 or 218, respectively. These fragments were synthesized by polymerase chain reaction experiments in which suN DNA was amplified by using as primers the reverse sequencing primer (Biolabs) and either the D132 or the D218 oligomers, which are complementary to residues 112-132 and 202-218 of su(f)S2, respectively. The amplified DNA was digested with XbaI, and the fragments were gel-purified and cloned into the AvaI site of pEMBL8CAT.Doc DNA called δ corresponds to a HinfI-NaeI fragment spanning residues 219-267 of su(f)S2. δ was cloned in the plasmid suA, either in the AvaI site upstream of the su(f)S2 promoter (constructs δ1suA and δ2suA), or in the HindIII site downstream from the su(f)S2 promoter (constructs suAδ1 and suAδ2). δ was also cloned into the HindIII site of RSVCAT downstream from the RSV promoter (constructs RSVδ1 and RSVδ2). The subregions ϵ and η (see Fig. 2A), obtained by digestion of suN with DdeI and AvaI, were cloned in the HindIII site of plasmid suA downstream from the su(f)S2 promoter (constructs suAϵ1 and suAη1, respectively). RSVϵ1 and RSVη1 were constructed by replacing the HindIII-NcoI fragment spanning the 5′ end region of the CAT gene in RSVCAT with HincII-NcoI fragments from suAϵ1 and suAη1. In all of these constructs, numbers indicate if the DNA of interest has been cloned in the direct (1Arkhipova I.R. Ilyin Y.V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1169-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or reverse (2Ayer D.E. Dynan W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2021-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) orientation. Plasmids s26 and Doc6-21 were constructed by first annealing the complementary oligonucleotides SA1/SA2 (s26) and 6A1/6A2 (Doc6-21). The double-stranded products, which are blunt at one end and give SalI 5′ plus-strand overhangs at the other end, were cloned between the AvaI and SalI sites of pEMBL8CAT. Plasmids s47 and Doc6-42 were similarly obtained by first annealing the complementary oligonucleotides SB1/SB2 (s47) and 6B1/6B2 (Doc6-42). The double-stranded DNA fragments, which had SalI 5′ minus-strand overhangs at one end and were blunt at the other end, were cloned between the SalI and HindIII sites of s26 and Doc6-21, respectively. To obtain s47 + 4 and Doc6-42 + 4, s47, and Doc6-42 DNAs were digested with SalI, and the SalI termini were made blunt-ended by the Klenow enzyme. To construct s47 - 5, s47 was digested with SalI, and SalI termini were made blunt-ended with mung bean nuclease. Mutations were introduced in the s47 context by annealing complementary oligonucleotides carrying specific base changes. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were cloned into s26 either between the SalI and HindIII sites (s47a, oligonucleotides 47a1 and 47a2; s47b, oligonucleotides 47b1 and 47b2; s47c, oligonucleotides 47c1 and 47c2), or between the AvaI and SalI sites (s47in1; oligonucleotides 47in1a and 47in1b; s47in2, oligonucleotides 47in2a and 47in2b). Constructs s/Doc6 and Doc6/s were obtained by exchanging the SalI-NcoI fragments, which span the Doc DE1-DE3 array and the 5′ end portion of the CAT gene, between s47 and Doc6-42.

In all cloning procedures, incompatible termini were made blunt-ended by T4 DNA polymerase before ligation (Sambrook et al., 1989). The orientation of cloned DNA was assessed in all recombinants by nucleotide sequence analysis according to standard procedures (Hattori and Sakaki, 1986).DNA Transfections and CAT AssaysThree ml of D. melanogaster S2 cells, seeded at a density of 1 × 106 to 2 × 106 per ml, were transfected as described previously (Di Nocera and Dawid, 1983). Five μg of the plasmid of interest and 5 μg of λF-gal were cotransfected per 65-mm diameter culture dish. λF-gal is a reference construct in which the Escherichia coli β-galactosidase gene is under the control of the D. melanogaster hsp70 core promoter, flanked 5′ by a DNA segment from the D. melanogaster F element. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested, resuspended in 0.2 ml of 0.25 M Tris (pH 7.8), and lysed by three cycles of freeze-thawing. The amount of β-galactosidase activity in each lysate was used to normalize the amount of extract with which CAT assays were performed. CAT and β-galactosidase activities were measured according to standard procedures (Sambrook et al., 1989).RNA AnalysesTotal RNA was analyzed by primer extension according to Grimaldi and Di Nocera(1988). Reaction products were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gels. Sequencing ladders were generated by the dideoxy chain termination method utilizing double-stranded DNA templates. The CAT primer was described previously (Minchiotti and Di Nocera, 1991). Northern analyses were carried out according to standard procedures (Sambrook et al., 1989). Thirty μg of total RNA from Schneider II cells co-transfected with 5 μg of λF-gal and 5 μg of suAδ1 or suAδ2 were electrophoresed on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel. The gel, blotted onto a HyBond+ membrane, was hybridized to an HindIII-NcoI fragment from pEMBL8CAT spanning the CAT gene. The filter was subsequently hybridized to a EcoRI-XhoI fragment from pC4βgal (Thummel et al., 1988) spanning the β-galactosidase gene. Hybridization was carried out in 4 × SSC, 50% formamide for 16 h at 45°C. The filter was washed two times in 2 × SSC for 30 min at 65°C, and three times in 0.1 × SSC for 30 min at 65°C before autoradiography.RESULTSThe 5′ End Regions of Distinct Doc Elements Promote CAT Expression in S2 CellsThe promoters of different LINE elements are located in the 5′ end region of unit-size family copies (Mizrokhi et al., 1988; Minchiotti and Di Nocera, 1991; Minakami et al., 1992; McLean et al., 1993). Since complete Doc elements are heterogeneous at the 5′ end both in length and sequence content (Driver et al., 1989), we checked the template competence of three different unit-length Doc copies: su(f)S2, Doc6, and Doc11 (Driver et al., 1989). The element su(f)S2, associated with a spontaneous lethal mutation of the suppressor of forked (su(f)), transposed in the recent past (Schalet, 1986), and should have a functional promoter region. This is the case, since a restriction fragment spanning the interval 1-267 of su(f)S2 stimulated the expression of the CAT gene in Drosophila S2 cells (Fig. 1, suN). The elements Doc6 and Doc11 were both isolated from a genomic DNA library. Doc11 is homologous to su(f)S2, but is 7 bp shorter at the 5′ end. Doc6 is 5 bp shorter than su(f)S2 and also differs at the 5′ end by an additional 29 residues (Driver et al., 1989; see Fig. 6). Aside from these differences, the three elements are identical in sequence down to the NaeI sites used for cloning (data not shown). Despite the extensive changes, plasmid 6N, which carries residues 1-262 of Doc6, directed CAT expression nearly at the same levels of suN. In contrast, the construct 11N, which carries residues 1-260 of Doc11, was Ȭ10-fold less efficient than suN in directing the expression of the CAT gene (Fig. 1).Figure 1Expression of Doc-CAT plasmids in S2 cells. Thick bars denote Doc DNA from the elements su(f)S2, Doc11, and Doc6 flanking 5′ the CAT gene in the various constructs analyzed. Thin bars denote flanking genomic DNA. The interval of Doc DNA included in each construct is given. Restriction sites within Doc DNA used for cloning are indicated. S2 cells, transfected with 5 μg of each of the listed recombinants and 5 μg of the internal control plasmid λF-gal, were assayed for CAT activity. The amount of lysate used in each assay was normalized to the expression of the cotransfected λF-gal plasmid. Numbers express relative enzymatic activities, obtained by dividing the specific activities by the level of suN expression, and represent average values of three to four independent transfections carried out with different cell populations. S.D. are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Alignment of the 5′ end regions of Doc, F, I factor, and jockey elements.

References (in parentheses) are as follows: Doc6, su(f)S2 and Doc 11 (this work; Driver et al., 1989), F (Minchiotti and Di Nocera, 1991), I factor (Fawcett et al., 1986), and jockey (Mizrokhi et al. 1988). Residues flanking the element Doc11 are in lowercase letters.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)An AluI site conserved in the Doc 5′ UTR was used to construct three clones (Fig. 1, suA, 11A, and 6A) in which Ȭ50 bp from the 5′ end of each element preceded the CAT gene. These constructs directed CAT expression at higher (5-8-fold) levels than the parental ones, suN, 11N, and 6N (Fig. 1).Information sufficient to direct transcription is thus restricted in Doc to a relatively small DNA interval. This contrasts what has been reported for the F element, in which basal transcription is stimulated by sequences located far downstream from the 5′ end region (Contursi et al., 1993).Doc Sequences Inhibit CAT Expression in an Orientation- and Position-dependent MannerData shown in Fig. 1 suggest that the AluI-NaeI interval, which was removed in plasmids of the A series, contains sequences which inhibit CAT expression. Via polymerase chain reaction cloning (see “Materials and Methods”), we obtained two 3′ deletion derivatives of suN in which Doc DNA extended 3′ to residue 218 (construct su218) or 132 (construct su132). The removal of the region 219-267 was sufficient to delete inhibitory sequences from suN (Fig. 2A). Construct su132 directed CAT expression Ȭ2-fold less efficiently than su218. This may denote either that positive DNA sequences are located between residues 132 and 218, or that transcripts directed by the two constructs have different stability.One interpretation of the data is that the region 219-267, which we will call herein δ, hosts a silencer-like element. Silencers generally inhibit transcription in a position and orientation independent manner (Laurenson and Rine, 1992). δ, cloned in either orientation upstream of a copy of the D. melanogaster hsp70 promoter transcribing the CAT gene, did not reduce CAT expression (data not shown). Subsequently, δ was cloned into the plasmid suA, either upstream (δ1suA and δ2suA) or downstream (suAδ1 and suAδ2) of the su(f)S2 promoter. We found that CAT expression was inhibited only when δ flanked 3′, in direct orientation, the su(f)S2 promoter (Fig. 2B). CAT levels were reduced, again in an orientation-dependent fashion (control data not shown) in cells transfected with RSVδ1, a construct in which δ had been cloned between the CAT gene and the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) promoter (Fig. 2B).The position- and orientation-dependent mode of action suggests that inhibitory sequences within δ act at the RNA, rather than at the DNA level. This hypothesis is supported by Northern blot analyses showing that suAδ1 transcripts accumulated at levels 2-3-fold higher than suAδ2 transcripts (Fig. 2C). Northern data also ruled out that the inhibition is associated to enhanced degradation of CAT transcripts.Upstream AUG triplets may inhibit translation initiation at natural AUGs (Liu et al., 1984), and an ATG is present within δ (see Fig. 2A). However, by assaying derivatives of both suA and RSVCAT in which the CAT gene is flanked 5′ by either the left-hand (ϵ) or the right-hand (η) portion of δ (Fig. 2A), we observed CAT inhibition with the ϵ, but not with the η subregion, which includes the δ ATG (Fig. 2B). The ϵ subregion extends 5′ to residue 208 and carries an ATG, not present in δ (Fig. 2A). We cannot therefore rule out that data obtained with suAϵ1 and RSVϵ1 reflect an inhibitory action of the ϵ ATG, which is the codon for the initiating methionine of the hypothetical Doc open reading frame 1, on the translation of the CAT mRNA.Functional Organization of the Doc Promoter RegionSites of transcription initiation in su(f)S2, Doc6, and Doc11 were determined by RNA primer extension analyses by using total RNA from cells transfected with suA, 6A, 11A, and an oligomer complementary to the CAT coding region as a primer. To set unambiguously the RNA 5′ ends, reaction products were electrophoresed along with sequencing ladders of the three plasmids (Fig. 3). Transcription initiates predominantly at 6 and 7 in su(f)S2 and at 1 and 2 in Doc6 (in both elements 1 refers to the first residue flanking the target site). Faint bands of elongation may be artifactual or mark minor sites of RNA initiation at −20, 9, and 19 in su(f)S2 and at −19, −3, 5, and 16 in Doc6. A faint band, corresponding to transcripts initiating at 17 in Doc11, was the only discrete product of extension detected with RNA from cells transfected with 11A.Figure 3Primer extension analysis of Doc-CAT RNAs. Total RNA (40 μg) from S2 cells transfected with 11A, suA, or 6A was hybridized to a 32P-5′-end-labeled 30-mer (CAT primer) complementary to the CAT gene sense strand. Annealed primer moieties were extended, in the presence of deoxynucleoside triphosphates, by avian reverse transcriptase. Reaction products were run on a 6% acrylamide, 8 M urea gel, along with sequencing ladders of the 11A, suA, and 6A templates obtained by the dideoxy chain termination method using the CAT primer. Predominant RNA start sites, marked by arrows, are shown along with the DNA sequence of the 5′ end of each element at the bottom. Lowercase letters denote flanking DNA; target sites setting the 5′ boundaries of su(f)S2 and Doc6 are underlined. Residue 2 in the su(f)S2element is A and not G as previously reported (Driver et al., 1989).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The organization of the cis-acting elements involved in the control of Doc transcription was investigated by assaying plasmids in which the CAT gene is under the control of different versions of the su(f)S2 promoter region. A construct carrying the interval 1-26 directed CAT expression, but could not drive faithful RNA initiation (Fig. 4, construct s26). A 10-fold increase in CAT levels, and a correct transcription pattern, was observed by using as template a construct carrying the interval 1-47 (Fig. 4, s47). In s26 and s47, the dinucleotide TT, found in su(f)S2 at residues 25-26, is replaced by GA. The change, which created in s47 a SalI site between residues 22 and 27 (Fig. 4A), did not perturb promoter function, as judged by comparing the expression of suA and s47 (data not shown). By repairing the termini of s47 DNA after SalI cleavage with either the Klenow enzyme or the mung bean nuclease, we obtained constructs in which the interval 27-47 of su(f)S2 was moved either 4 bp away from (s47 + 4) or 5 bp closer to (s47 - 5) the RNA start site(s). Both space changes severely reduced CAT expression (Fig. 4A). Primer extension data showed that faithful RNA initiation was abolished in the construct s47 + 4 (Fig. 4B).Figure 4A, effect of base and space changes within the su(f)S2 promoter. The sequence of the interval 1-47 from su(f)S2 flanking the CAT gene in s47 is shown at the top. Lowercase letters denote residues mutated to create a SalI site. Sequence identities are denoted by dashes in the clones listed below. Residues deleted in s47 - 5 are denoted by asterisks. The site of insertion of extra nucleotides in s47 + 4 is marked by an arrow. The RNA start site region and the RGAGCTGY motif are boxed. Sites of RNA initiation at residues 6 and 7 and the SalI site between residues 22 and 27 are underlined. The regions denoted in the text as DE1, DE2, and DE3 are indicated. Relative CAT activities and S.D. were calculated as described in the legend to Fig. 1. B, transcription initiation in different su(f)S2 derivatives. Total RNA (30 μg) from S2 cells transfected with the constructs listed below was analyzed by primer extension as described in the legend to Fig. 3. Lanes: 1, s26; 2, s47; 3, s47 + 4; 4, s47; 5, s47a; 6, s47b; 7, s47c. Sequencing ladders of either s26 (lane R, G + A reactions; lane Y, C + T reactions) or s47 (lanes G, A, T, and C) were obtained by the dideoxy chain termination method with the same 30 mer (CAT primer) used for RNA extension. Taking into account the length of the vector DNA segment separating Doc from CAT sequences in the construct s26, bands in lane 1 corresponding to faithfully initiated transcripts should be 7-8 nucleotides shorter than the doublet detected in lane 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The interval 25-47 spans a DNA sequence (AGACGTGT, residues 33-42; see Fig. 4A) which is conserved in all Drosophila LINEs (consensus RGACGTGY; see Fig. 6). The transcriptional pattern of the construct 47b indicates that this sequence has a key role in Doc transcription (Fig. 4, A and B). The reduced template activity of both s47 + 4 and s47 - 5 may be due to the novel position of the RGACGTGY motif, which is located in all Drosophila LINEs at the same distance from the RNA start site(s) (see Fig. 6). However, the situation is more complex, since we found that base changes introduced either to the left (residues 28-32, construct s47a) or to the right of the AGACGTGT sequence (residues 43-47, construct s47c) also impaired promoter function (Fig. 4, A and B). Results thus indicate that three adjacent downstream sequences, herein called DE1, DE2, and DE3 (Fig. 4A) stimulate transcription of the su(f)S2 element.Sequences spanning the RNA start sites also have a critical role in transcriptional promotion. The RNA start site regions of su(f)S2 (GATTCG, residues 6-11) and Doc6 (CACTCG, residues 1-6) fit the consensus (C/G)AYTCG (RNA start sites are underlined; see Fig. 3). The notion that the (C/G)AYTCG motif spans an initiator (Inr) module is supported by the analysis of the construct 47in1. This clone, in which residues 6-10 of su(f)S2 have been changed from GATTC to cgTga, directed CAT expression Ȭ70-fold less efficiently than the parental construct s47 (Fig. 4A). We have also constructed a derivative of s47 (s47in2) in which residues 1-7 of su(f)S2 have been replaced by the heptamer TGCCTCT, which is the sequence found at the same relative position in Doc11 (see Fig. 6). Base changes introduced in s47in2 did not impair CAT expression (Fig. 4A). This result suggests that the template activity of Doc11 does not correlate with base changes in the Inr region, but possibly reflects the negative interference of flanking genomic DNA.The organization of promoter sequences is similar, on the whole, in su(f)S2 and Doc6 (Fig. 5). The construct Doc6-21, which carries the interval 1-21 of Doc6, directed CAT expression Ȭ50-fold less efficiently than Doc6-42, a construct in which Doc6 DNA extended 3′ to residue 42 (Fig. 5). Faithful RNA initiation was observed with Doc6-42, but not with Doc6-21 (data not shown). By mutating residues 17 and 22 of Doc6, a SalI site was also introduced into Doc6-42. SalI sites in s47 and Doc6-42 are at the same distance from the RNA start site region (Fig. 5). Similarly to what was observed with the s47 + 4 construct (Fig. 4), the insertion of 4 bp in the Doc6 promoter region significantly reduced CAT expression (Fig. 5, construct Doc6-42 + 4) and abolished faithful RNA initiation (data not shown). The DNA region dislodged in Doc6-42 + 4 corresponds to the DE1-DE3 array. Interestingly, while DE2 (with a single base pair change) and DE3 are conserved in Doc6 and su(f)S2, the DE1 region varies (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6). Comparison of the template activities of Doc6-42, s47, and two chimeric clones (Doc6/s and s/Doc6) in which regulatory sequences of Doc6 and su(f)S2 have been exchanged, suggests that the two DE1-DE3 arrays are functionally equivalent (Fig. 5).Figure 5Analysis of the Doc6 promoter. Residues 1-42 from Doc6 flanking the CAT gene in Doc6-42 are shown at the top. In the clones listed below, sequence identities are denoted by dashes. Residues 1-47 from su(f)S2 flanking 5′ the CAT gene in s47 are shown at the bottom. In Doc6/s and s/Doc6, residues from s47 are in uppercase letters. The SalI sites in Doc6-42 and s47, underlined in the figure, have been exploited to exchange Doc6 and su(f)S2 regulatory sequences in constructs Doc6/s and s/Doc6 (see “Materials and Methods”). Sites of RNA initiation in Doc6 and su(f)S2 are boxed. The site of insertion of extra nucleotides in Doc6-42 + 4 is marked by an arrow. The regions denoted as DE1, DE2, and DE3 in su(f)S2 are shown.

The relatedness of Doc and F elements (see O'Hare et al.(1991)) prompted the search for an antisense promoter in the 5′ end region of Doc. suN-inv, a construct in which the DNA region cloned in suN (Fig. 1) is reversed with respect to the CAT gene, directed CAT expression Ȭ60 times less efficiently than F-cat2, a construct in which the CAT gene is flanked 5′ by the 267/1 region from the F element (see Minchiotti and Di Nocera, 1991).

We propose that W functions by ejecting tRNAs from ribosomes in a step that precedes the movement of mRNA during translocation. Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying translation depends, in large part, on the biochemical reconstitution of this process(1Lucas-Lenard J. Beres L. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 10.

Specific factors that affect the initiation, elongation, and termination of translation have been isolated and have been used to examine the mechanism of each reaction on ribosomes programmed with homo- or heteropolymeric mRNAs. In contrast, only two studies have been published on the reconstitution of translation using native mRNA templates. In one of these studies, the lacZ gene was transcribed by RNA polymerase and pure translation factors and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases were used to translate these transcripts on Escherichia coli ribosomes (7Kung H.-F. Redfield B. Treadwell B.V. Eskin B. Spears C. Weissbach H. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6889-6894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The requirements for the N-formylmethionyl-tRNAfMet transformylase and for the RR-F1 (“ribosome recycling factor”) (8Kung H.-F. Chu F. Callwell P. Spears C. Treadwell B.V. Eskin B. Brot N.

In other studies, reconstitution of translation was examined by programming synthesis with amber mutants of the coat protein gene of f2 bacteriophage. The requirement for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases was bypassed by using the appropriate aminoacyl-tRNAs in the reactions(10Green R.M. Glick B.R. Ganoza M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

These proteins have been purified to homogeneity, and the sequence of two of their genes has been established (15Aoki H. Adams S.-L. Chung D.-G. Yaguchi M. Chuang S.-E. Ganoza M.C.

We propose that W stimulates translocation by accelerating the ejection of cognate tRNAs from ribosomes. [35S]Met (550 Ci/mmol), [3H]Ser (38 Ci/mmol), [3H]Ala (82.7 Ci/mmol), [3H]Thr (5.3 Ci/mmol), [3H]Phe (18.0 Ci/mmol), and [3H]Lys (100 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Corp. or DuPont NEN. The E. coli K12 tRNA and the trinucleotide codon AUG came from Sigma. Poly(U), poly(A), and MS2 RNA were from Boehringer Mannheim. E. coli K12 mid-log or MRE 600 cells were purchased from the Miles Chemical Corp. or from the University of Alabama Fermentation Center (University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL). MRE 600 and Q13 cells were obtained from B. Bachmann (Yale University, New Haven, CT). Mutants of fusA were obtained from Tocchini-Valentini, G.P. (International Laboratory of Genetics and Biophysics, Naples, Italy). MRE 600, Q13, and the fusA mutant cells used to prepare ribosomes were grown to mid-log phase as described previously(16Ganoza M.C. Barraclough N. Wong J.T.-F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). f[35S]Met-tRNAfMet, [3H]Ala-tRNA, [3H]Phe-tRNA, [3H]Thr-tRNA, [3H]Ser-tRNA, and [3H]Lys-tRNA were acylated as described previously using unfractionated E. coli K12 tRNA(16Ganoza M.C. Barraclough N. Wong J.T.-F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). When appropriate, the incubations contained a 10-5M solution of each unlabeled amino acid. The source of the enzyme used to prepare these fully charged aminoacyl-tRNAs was an S100 from MRE 600 cells (containing about 10 mg/ml protein) or the S100 purified through DEAE-cellulose columns (16Ganoza M.C. Barraclough N. Wong J.T.-F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The later partially purified synthetases enabled the labeling of each specific aminoacyl-tRNA without apparent contamination. This was done by using the appropriate single amino acid or amino acid mixture. The fractions were assayed for each of 20 labeled amino acids prior to use to ensure that each aminoacyl-tRNA was fully charged. The extent of formylation was assessed on aliquots of the f[35S]Met-tRNAfMet after hydrolysis in 0.3 N NaOH followed by extraction of f[35S]Met from ethyl acetate in 0.1 N HCl(16Ganoza M.C. Barraclough N. Wong J.T.-F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Ribosomes were isolated from E. coli Q13 or MRE 600 as described(16Ganoza M.C. Barraclough N. Wong J.T.-F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Ribosomes were washed using 10 mM HCl-Tris, pH 7.4, containing either 1 M NH4Cl and 2 mM MgCl2 in the first wash or 0.5 M NH4Cl and 10 mM MgCl2 in the following two washes. The cells used to prepare the ribosomes were grown to 4 × 108 viable cells/ml (16Ganoza M.C. Barraclough N. Wong J.T.-F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and were routinely tested for RNase revertants as described(17Gesteland R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 16: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Sucrose density gradient analysis of ribosomes was carried out using 5-30% sucrose in 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, 50 mM NH4Cl. Two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis of ribosomal proteins was performed by the method of Kaltschmidt and Wittmann(18Kaltschmidt E. Wittmann H.G. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 36: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). The f2am3 bacteriophage, encoding the N-terminal hexapeptide of the f2 RNA coat protein, was isolated, and the RNA was extracted as described (17Gesteland R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 16: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and used to program synthesis as in (10Green R.M. Glick B.R. Ganoza M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The elongation factors EF-Tu, EF-Ts, and EF-G were assayed with poly(U) and Phe-tRNA as well as by exchange of [3H]GDP (19Miller D.L. Weissbach H. Moldave K. Grossman L. Methods in Enzymology. 30. Academic Press, Inc., New York1974: 219-232Google Scholar) and were purified as described(20Arai K.I. Kawakita M. Kaziro Y. J. Biol.

EF-P was assayed and purified as in (14Chung D.-G. Zahib N.D. Baxter R.M. Ganoza M.C. Spedding G. Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1990: 69-80Google Scholar). The release factor, RF-1, was assayed and purified as described in (22Ganoza M.C. Buckingham K. Hader P. Neilson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14101-14104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The “rescue” protein was assayed by complementation of thermolabile synthesis in extracts of strain N4316, supplemented with Asn-tRNA synthetase. The rescue protein was purified as described(13Ganoza M.C. Knauber D.C. Murphy B. Fallavolita D. Chung D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 178: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). IF-1, IF-2, and IF-3 were isolated from E. coli K12 cells and assayed with AUG or MS2 RNA (23Hershey J.W.B. Yanov J. Fakunding L.

Science. 1964; 145: 1399-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). S1 and S1A were detected with antibodies specific for S1. SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoretic analysis of the proteins was performed as described(26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), and the proteins were visualized by staining with silver(27Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined as described(28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). W can be scored with MS2, f2, or f2am3 RNA to program synthesis by using aminoacylated tRNAs and purified ribosomes supplemented with pure initiation and elongation factors(10Green R.M. Glick B.R. Ganoza M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 126: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11Ganoza M.C. Cunningham C. Green R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, the efficiency of the reactions is greatly enhanced by using aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (11Ganoza M.C. Cunningham C. Green R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Routinely the following protocol was used to specifically score for W in the absence of pure aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Reagents were added in the following order with final concentrations of: 35 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mM GTP, 1.0 mM ATP, 2.8 mM phosphoenol pyruvate, 32 mM NH4Cl (added in a 12-fold concentrated mix), 10 mM MgCl2, 8 mM dithiothreitol, 90 μM amino acid mixture without Lys (or any other amino acid used as a label), 0.75 μg of Ca2+ leucovorin, 1.0 μg of pyruvate kinase, 7.5 μg of E. coli B tRNA, IF-1 purified through DEAE (5.4 μg), IF-2 purified through DEAE and P11 (4.25 μg), EF-Tu, EF-Ts, and EF-G fractions purified through one or two A-50 columns (1.2-2.5 μg each), MRE 600 ribosomes (washed one to three times) (10 pmol), MRE 600 S100 (1.7 μg), W purified through two DEAE A-50 columns (9 μg), and IF-3 purified from DEAE (0.2 μg). The reactions (30 μl final volume) were incubated for 10 min at 37°C, and then MS2 RNA (8 μg) and [3H]Lys (2 μCi) were added. The tubes were incubated again for 15 min at 37°C, precipitated with 1 ml of cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, heated at 90°C for 10 min, and washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid on Whatman GF/A glass filters prior to measuring the radioactivity. The assay for W was supplemented with EF-Tu, EF-Ts, and EF-G to insure that these proteins did not limit W-dependent synthesis. The diluted S100 was used as a source of the 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, the Met-tRNA transformylase, the rescue protein EF-P, the release factors RF-1 and RF-2, and the RR-F protein. S100 fractions had to be titrated for W activity prior to use. Pre-translocation complexes were formed from ribosomes, S100 fractions, and elongation factors derived from a fusA mutant that harbors a temperature-sensitive EF-G protein. EF-G was irreversibly inactivated by preincubating the fusA- cells for one generation at 44°C. The W protein was purified from ribosomes derived from 200-500 g of mid-log E. coli K12 or MRE 600 cells. Ribosomes were extracted for 5 h at 0°C with 1 M NH4Cl, 2 mM MgCl2 in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mM dithiothreitol. Ribosomes were removed by ultracentrifugation, and the ribosomal extracts were concentrated with ammonium sulfate to 80% saturation at pH 7.4. After dialysis, the fractions were chromatographed on a DEAE-A50 column and eluted with a linear 0.15-0.4 M KCl gradient. Fractions having W activity (at 0.13 M KCl) were concentrated and chromatographed on a second DEAE A-50 column, which was eluted with a linear gradient containing 0.1-0.3 M KCl. W eluted at 0.18 M KCl and was further fractionated by Sephacryl S200 and/or by hydroxylapatite chromatography. W eluted with 0.05-0.13 M phosphate buffer from the latter column. W prepared in this manner comprises 90% of the protein observed upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis. The preparations are free of all elongation factors and other proteins involved in translation. The details of this purification scheme will be described in detail in a subsequent publication. Samples (15 μl) were hydrolyzed with 0.33 N NH4OH for 10 min. at 37°C, neutralized with HCl, and electrophoresed on Whatman No. 1MM paper for 2 h and 40 min (4000 V) using pyridine, acetic acid, and water (1:10:189; v/v/v). Strips were cut and counted. Protein chain elongation entails the cyclical alignment of aminoacyl-tRNAs in response to their specific codons in mRNA, peptide-bond synthesis, and movement of mRNA relative to the ribosome (translocation). These mechanisms have been examined predominantly with homopolymeric mRNAs using ionic conditions that obviate the requirements for initiation factors and other proteins that may be essential for operations on natural mRNAs (see below) (1Lucas-Lenard J.

Although the mechanism of chain elongation has been examined with homopolymeric mRNAs, there is considerable evidence that mRNA structure affects this process, e.g. highly structured mRNAs tend to promote premature release of pre-translocation complexes from ribosomes. It is known that a number of such “processivity” errors result from faulty elongation events(32Kurland C.G. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 29-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 33Parker J. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 273-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reconstruction of translation programmed by native templates has revealed the requirement for several factors(10Green R.M. Glick B.R.

A. 1985; 82: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). One of these, the “rescue” protein(12Ganoza M.C. Aoki H. Kozieradzki I. Schwartz I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 13Ganoza M.C. Knauber D.C. Murphy B. Fallavolita D. Chung D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 178: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), is required for association of native ribosomal subunits; a second factor, EF-P, is essential for synthesis of the first peptide bond on 70 S ribosomes(15Aoki H. Adams S.-L. Chung D.-G. Yaguchi M. Chuang S.-E. Ganoza M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6215-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); the third of these factors, W, is involved in chain elongation and is essential to reconstitute translation(10Green R.M. Glick B.R. Ganoza M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 126: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11Ganoza M.C. Cunningham C. Green R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). W has a relative mass of 47 kDa and a sedimentation coefficient of 4.1 S. The W protein, purified to 90% apparent homogeneity, is free of all initiation, elongation, termination factors as well as other proteins, such as the RR-F (9Ryoji M. Karpen J.W. Kaji A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) required to reconstitute protein synthesis(7Kung H.-F. Redfield B. Treadwell B.V. Eskin B. Spears C. Weissbach H. J. Biol.

A. 1985; 82: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The gene encoding W has been cloned and mapped on the E. coli chromosome. The requirement for synthesis, chromosome location, and the partial sequence of the protein suggest that it is a new component of translation. Here we examine the effect of the W protein on synthesis of the full length or of the first six N-terminal amino acids of the MS2 or f2am3 coat protein. Fig. 1A shows a bar graph of the products of synthesis analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Synthesis products were formed in response to MS2 RNA in a purified system dependent on the W protein. 90% of the products synthesized correspond to the coat protein of the MS2 virion. W stimulates this synthesis at least 6-fold, but has no effect on synthesis directed by poly(A) or poly(U) (Fig. 1, A and B). Synthesis programmed with poly(U) initiated by N-acetyl-[3H]Phe-tRNA also does not depend on W (Fig. 1C). Thus, synthesis directed by a natural mRNA requires W, whereas synthesis directed by these artificial templates does not. W does not dissociate, associate, or prevent association of 70 S ribosomes and is not required for binding fMet-tRNAfMet to ribosomes nor for peptide bond synthesis, as measured by f[35S]Met-puromycin or f[35S]Met•Ala synthesis(10Green R.M. Glick B.R. Ganoza M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 126: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11Ganoza M.C. Cunningham C. Green R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To determine whether W is required for elongation, we examined its effect on synthesis of amino acids 2-6 of the MS2 coat protein by labeling each of the corresponding amino acids. Fig. 2 shows that there is a linear correlation between the requirement for W on synthesis and the position of the amino acid in the coat protein. The synthesis of the entire coat protein is absolutely dependent on W (10Green R.M. Glick B.R. Ganoza M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 126: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11Ganoza M.C. Cunningham C. Green R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), whereas dipeptide synthesis is nearly independent of W, further confirming this relationship (Fig. 2). The requirement for W on chain elongation was further studied by reconstructing synthesis with extracts of a thermosensitive mutant in the translocase, EF-G, which were freed of W by purification. Fig. 3A shows that, in such systems, synthesis of the coat protein of the MS2 bacteriophage requires both EF-G and W. As expected, in the absence of a functional EF-G protein, fMet-Ala accumulates on ribosomes resulting in arrested synthesis. Under these conditions, binding of the second aminoacyl-tRNA, Ala-tRNA, does not require W (data not shown). (W stimulates fMet-Ala synthesis by 50% upon addition of EF-G but not in the absence of EF-G, data not shown.). Synthesis of the N-terminal penta- or hexapeptide (examined electrophoretically) programmed by MS2 RNA (Fig. 3B, 1) or by f2am3 RNA (Fig. 3B, 2) requires not only EF-G but also W. W stimulates hexapeptide synthesis about 2-fold. Using more highly purified ribosomes, a 10-20-fold stimulation is observed (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4, binding of the third aminoacyl-tRNA, Ser-tRNASer, of the MS2 bacteriophage coat protein to the 70 S•mRNA•fMet-Ala-tRNA•EF-Tu complex depends on addition of both EF-G and W. This experiment suggests that W functions with EF-G in translocation. The synthesis of tripeptides involves the movement of mRNA relative to the ribosomal complex and requires EF-G. This event is preceded by the release of deacyl-tRNA from ribosomes after peptide-bond synthesis. Translocation is required to move the nascent peptide into a site where it can be active in peptide-bond formation and where recognition of the next codon on the mRNA can occur. Synthesis of the initial dipeptide is followed by ejection of the deacyl-tRNA (tRNAfMet, in this case) from the ribosome. We therefore examined the effect of W on ejection of deacyl-tRNA from the pre-translocation complex (ribosome•MS2 RNA•fMet-Ala-tRNA). The data in Fig. 4 indicate that W indeed ejects [32P]tRNA bound to ribosomes, concomitant with binding of [3H]Ser-tRNA. EF-G does not substitute for W in this reaction (Fig. 4). Since W strongly stimulates binding of the third, but not of the second, aminoacyl-tRNA to the fMet-tRNA•EF-Tu•mRNA• ribosome complex, as well as ejection of tRNA from ribosomes, it may increase the affinity of the A site by ejecting tRNAs from the E or P site after they have participated in synthesis. To begin examining this possibility, the kinetics of binding and tRNA ejection were examined using the pre-translocation complex. As shown in Fig. 5, W stimulates the rate of binding of [3H]Ser-tRNA to MS2 RNA•ribosome complexes that contain fMet-Ala-tRNA. In the absence of W, very little binding of [3H]Ser-tRNA is observed and the [32P]tRNA is stably bound to the ribosomes. Addition of W results in the ejection of [32P]tRNA from these complexes concomitant with the binding of the [3H]Ser-tRNA. Since unfractionated tRNA was used in these experiments, the tRNA released from these complexes was identified by acylation with [35S]Met using Met-tRNA synthetase. Thirty to 40% of the deacyl [32P]tRNA ejected from the ribosome is tRNAfMet. Three sites, A, P, and E, are known to be involved in binding, respectively, aminoacyl-tRNA, peptidyl-tRNA, or deacyl-tRNA to ribosomes(2Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1989; 242: 142-148Crossref Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 3Nierhaus K.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4997-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Two models for the elongation reaction have been recently proposed. Both are based on analysis of intermediates in polyphenylalanine synthesis programmed with poly(U). In the first model it is suggested that two sites (A and P) exist on the 30 S, and three (A, P, and E) on the 50 S particle. Hybrid states of the ribosome are proposed to explain the altered “foot printing” pattern observed on addition of the 50 S particle, EF-Tu, and EF-G(2Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1989; 242: 142-148Crossref Scopus (603) Google Scholar). According to this model, the peptidyl-tRNA or fMet-tRNAfMet bind to a P/P site which is equivalent to the P site. The EF-Tu•GTP•aminoacyl-tRNA binds to an A/T state. EF-Tu•GDP is released after hydrolysis of GTP allowing the aminoacyl-tRNA to interact with the 50 S A (AA) site. During peptide bond formation, both the peptidyl and the deacyl-tRNAs move relative to the 50 S subunit such that the deacyl-tRNA moves from the P/P to the P/E site and the peptidyl-tRNA moves from the AA to the A/P site. During translocation, EF-G and GTP promote movement of the peptidyl-tRNA relative to the 30 S subunit from the A/P site to the P/P or P site and the deacyl-tRNA from the P/E to the E site. These data are also explained by a scheme involving two steps, where the subunits and not the tRNAs move relative to each other after peptide-bond formation and translocation(2Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1989; 242: 142-148Crossref Scopus (603) Google Scholar). In the second model, a pre-translocation state is defined by the occupancy of tRNA in the P site and peptidyl-tRNA in the A site. In the post-translocation state, the tRNA occupies the E site and the peptidyl-tRNA the P site. EF-G is thought to effect the conversion of the pre- to the post-translocation states(3Nierhaus K.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4997-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Occupation of the E site is known to induce a low affinity A site, and occupation of the A site induces a low affinity E site effecting the release of tRNA(3Nierhaus K.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4997-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the filling of the E site with deacyl-tRNA induces a low affinity A site, which enables the tRNA•ribosome complexes to dissociate(3Nierhaus K.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4997-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Since W stimulates Ser-tRNA binding to ribosomes concomitant with the ejection of deacyl-tRNA from the particles, it could be stimulating cognate tRNA ejection by affecting the affinity of the E site. The relative contribution of W to the exit of cognate tRNAs from the E site of the ribosome is under study using suitable heteropolymeric mRNAs. Other experiments are required to establish whether W affects an essential hybrid site utilized during chain elongation. W has no effect on poly(U)- or poly(A)-programmed synthesis from Phe-tRNAPhe or Lys-tRNALys. For these cases, a more rapid release of the cognate tRNAs from the ribosome may occur, which may not be detected under our experimental conditions. Alternatively, it is possible that W ejects only certain tRNAs from ribosomes, e.g. deacyl-tRNAfMet. The specificity of W in the binding and unbinding of tRNAs is also under investigation. The combined results presented here suggest that the W protein could have pronounced effects on the efficiency of translation programmed by native mRNAs by removing tRNAs from ribosomes that are spent during synthesis. The discovery of this protein has enabled reconstitution of translation from pure components permitting the study of these and other reactions that regulate translation of mRNA transcripts.

https://openalex.org/W2075912627,"Insulin's effects primarily are initiated by insulin binding to its plasma membrane receptor and the sequential tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and intracellular substrates, such as insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). However, studies suggest some insulin effects, including those at the nucleus, may not be regulated by this pathway. The present study compared the levels of insulin binding, insulin receptor and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, and phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase activity to immediate early gene c-<i>fos</i> and <i>egr-1</i> mRNA expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing only neomycin-resistant plasmid (CHO<sub>NEO</sub>), overexpressing wild type human insulin receptor (CHO<sub>HIR<sub>c</sub></sub>) or ATP binding site-mutated insulin receptors (CHO<sub>A1018K</sub>). Insulin binding in CHO<sub>NEO</sub> cells was markedly lower than that in other cell types. 10 nM insulin significantly increased tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor and IRS-1 in CHO<sub>HIR<sub>c</sub></sub> cells. Phosphorylation of insulin receptor and IRS-1 in CHO<sub>NEO</sub> and CHO<sub>A1018K</sub> cells was not detected in the presence or absence of insulin. Similarly, insulin increased phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity only in CHO<sub>HIR<sub>c</sub></sub> cells. As determined by Northern blot, nuclear run-on analysis, and <i>in situ</i> hybridization, insulin induced c-<i>fos</i> mRNA expression, through transcription, in CHO<sub>HIR<sub>c</sub></sub> cells but not in CHO<sub>NEO</sub> and CHO<sub>A1018K</sub> cells, consistent with previous reports. In contrast, all three cell types showed a similar insulin dose-dependent increase of <i>egr-1</i> mRNA expression through transcription. These data indicated that insulin-induced <i>egr-1</i> mRNA expression did not correlate with the levels of insulin binding to insulin receptor or phosphorylation of insulin receptor and IRS-1. These results suggest that different mechanisms are involved in induction of c-<i>fos</i> and <i>egr-1</i> mRNA expression by insulin, the former by the more classic insulin receptor tyrosine kinase pathway and the latter by a yet to be determined alternative signal transduction pathway."
