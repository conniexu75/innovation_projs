The transductional processes by which RAGE ligation transmits signals to the nuclei of cells is unknown and was investigated. AGE-albumin, a prototypic ligand, activated p21 ras in rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells that express RAGE, whereas nonglycated albumin was without effect. MAP kinase activity was enhanced at concentrations of AGE-albumin, which activated p21 ras and NF-κB. Depletion of intracellular glutathione rendered cells more sensitive to AGE-mediated activation of this signaling pathway. In contrast, signaling was blocked by preventing p21 ras from associating with the plasma membrane or mutating Cys118 on p21 ras to Ser. Signaling was receptor-dependent, because it was prevented by blocking access to RAGE with either anti-RAGE IgG or by excess soluble RAGE. These data suggest that RAGE-mediated induction of cellular oxidant stress triggers a cascade of intracellular signals involving p21 ras and MAP kinase, culminating in transcription factor activation. The molecular mechanism that triggers this pathway likely involves oxidant modification and activation of p21 ras .

In the presence of aldoses, proteins become nonenzymatically glycated and oxidized (1Ruderman N.B. Williamson J.R. Brownlee M.C.

This initially reversible glycation is followed by further irreversible rearrangements leading to a class of permanently modified proteins known as advanced glycation end products (AGEs). 1The abbreviations used are: AGE, advanced glycation end products; RAGE, receptor for AGE; sRAGE, soluble RAGE; SMC, rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell; MAP, mitogen-activated protein. Although glycated proteins are found at low levels in normal individuals during aging, significantly higher levels are found in certain disease states such as diabetes and renal failure (4Sell D.R.

We have recently demonstrated the enhanced presence of RAGE in vascular smooth muscle of diabetic vasculature (renal arterial vessel) compared with a similar sized vessel from a nondiabetic age-matched control. These areas of enhanced RAGE immunoreactivity co-localize with enhanced immunostaining for AGE-reactive epitopes (10Schmidt A.M. Yan S.D. Stern D. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1002-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Our previous data in endothelial cells and in vivo demonstrated that interaction of AGEs with RAGE results in triggering a range of cellular responses, including transcription factor activation and changes in gene expression (11Schmidt A.-M. Hori O. Brett J. Yan S.-D. Wautier J.-L. Stern D. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1521-1528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yan S.D. Schmidt A.M. Anderson G.M. Zhang J. Brett J. Zou Y.S. Pinsky D.

Circulation. 1994; 90: 1567Google Scholar). However, the means by which a signal reflecting AGE engagement of RAGE is transmitted to the nucleus is not known. Given the enhanced expression of AGE and RAGE in diabetic vascular smooth muscle, we focused on elucidating the signaling pathways in smooth muscle cells that are triggered upon ligation of RAGE by AGE-albumin, a prototypical ligand. Recent evidence supports a role for reactive oxygen species in mediating signaling by several receptor systems (15Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T.

For example, platelet-derived growth factor has recently been shown to stimulate H2O2 production in vascular smooth muscle cells (15Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar). When production of oxidants was blocked, platelet-derived growth factor-induced enhancement of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity, chemotaxis, and DNA synthesis was prevented (15Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar). Others have found that induction of c-fos expression by tumor necrosis factor-α and basic fibroblast growth factor requires production of reactive oxygen intermediates (16Lo Y.Y.C. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11727-11730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), as does activation of the MAP kinase cascade in NIH-3T3 cells (17Stevenson M.A. Pollock S.S. Coleman C.N. Calderwood S.K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 12-15PubMed Google Scholar) and in neutrophils (18Fialkow L. Chan C.K. Rotin D. Grinstein S. Downey G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31234-31242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous data indicate that interaction of AGEs with endothelial RAGE and vascular RAGE in vivo results in the generation of significant cellular redox stress manifested by the appearance of malondialdehyde-reactive epitopes, increased mRNA for heme oxygenase-1 (12Yan S.D. Schmidt A.M. Anderson G.M. Zhang J. Brett J. Zou Y.S. Pinsky D. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9889-9897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (12Yan S.D. Schmidt A.M. Anderson G.M. Zhang J. Brett J. Zou Y.S. Pinsky D. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9889-9897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently identified a p21 ras /MAP kinase signaling cascade that is regulated by redox stress (22Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed studies to elucidate the molecular signals that result from AGE-RAGE interaction. The farnesyltransferase inhibitor α-hydroxyfarnesylphosphonic acid was obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), andl-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine was from Sigma. Bovine serum albumin (Sigma) was glycated by incubation with glucose (0.5 m) or ribose (0.25m) at 37 °C for 6 weeks (6Schmidt A.M. Vianna M. Gerlach M. Brett J. Ryan J. Kao J. Esposito C. Hegarty H.

Pan Y.-C.E. Elliston K. Stern D. Shaw A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14998-15004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Controls consisted of the same initial preparations of albumin incubated in the same manner in the absence of aldose. Rat RAGE and monospecific rabbit anti-RAGE IgG were prepared and characterized as described previously for bovine RAGE (6Schmidt A.M. Vianna M. Gerlach M. Brett J. Ryan J. Kao J. Esposito C. Hegarty H. Hurley W. Clauss M. Wang F. Pan Y.-C.E. Tsang T.C. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14987-14997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yan S.D. Schmidt A.M. Anderson G.M. Zhang J. Brett J. Zou Y.S. Pinsky D. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9889-9897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ≈35 kDa extracellular domain of rat RAGE was termed soluble RAGE (sRAGE). Rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (and 5% horse serum for PC12 cells) and 2% l-glutamine. Cells treated with inhibitors were resuspended in serum-free medium containing α-hydroxyfarnesylphosphonic acid (10 μm) orl-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (100 μg/ml) 24 h prior to the addition of AGE-albumin. Nuclei were isolated, mixed with the 32P-labeled NF-κB consensus sequence, and assayed exactly as described previously (23Lander H.M. Sehajpal P. Levine D.M. Novogrodsky A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1509-1516PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm the specificity of the assay, positive samples were incubated with 100-fold excess unrelated NF-κB-specific DNA as well as 100-fold excess unlabeled nonspecific DNA. In all cases, the NF-κB-specific DNA effectively competed with the sample, whereas the unrelated DNA had no effect. The assay used to measure the GTP/GDP ratio on immunoprecipitated p21 ras was essentially that of Downward et al. (24Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar) with minor modifications as described previously (25Lander H.M. Ogiste J.O. Pearce S.F.A. Levi R. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7017-7020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Serum-starved cells (24 h, 5 × 106) were treated for the indicated times at 37 °C prior to MAP kinase assay as we previously described (22Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have revealed activation of p21 ras by reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species (22Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 25Lander H.M. Ogiste J.O. Pearce S.F.A. Levi R. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7017-7020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Because the ability of AGEs to induce NF-κB activation has been shown to be dependent upon the generation of cellular redox stress (12Yan S.D. Schmidt A.M. Anderson G.M. Zhang J. Brett J. Zou Y.S. Pinsky D. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9889-9897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether AGEs initiate signaling to the nucleus by activating p21 ras . Addition of AGE-albumin (100 μg/ml) to rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (SMCs), in which the intracellular nucleotide phosphate pools were labeled to equilibrium with [32P]orthophosphate, yielded enhanced levels of GTP-bound p21 ras upon immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1,solid circles). In contrast, cells treated with nonglycated albumin (Fig. 1, open circles and open triangles) had p21 ras with basal levels of GTP associated with it (13.2 ± 2.5%). Furthermore, cells in which endogenous glutathione levels were greatly reduced by pretreatment withl-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (20Staal F.J.I. Anderson M.T. Staal G.E. Herzenberg L.A. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3619-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar,22Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) showed an enhanced response on subsequent addition of AGE-albumin (Fig. 1, solid triangles). We have previously demonstrated that this concentration of AGE-albumin was optimal for AGE-RAGE-mediated cellular oxidant stress (12Yan S.D. Schmidt A.M. Anderson G.M. Zhang J. Brett J. Zou Y.S. Pinsky D. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9889-9897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data indicate that endogenous p21 ras was stimulated by addition of AGE and that this activation is under redox regulation. One of the known critical intermediates in signal transduction by p21 ras is activation of a family of Ser/Thr kinases termed MAP kinases. We investigated whether two of these kinases, ERK1 and ERK2, were activated by AGE-albumin. Treatment of SMCs with AGE-albumin for 10–15 min resulted in concentration-dependent activation of immunoprecipitated ERK1 and ERK2 (Fig. 2, open circles). Addition of nonglycated albumin had no effect (data not shown). Depletion of glutathione by exposure of SMCs tol-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine enhanced AGE-albumin stimulation of MAP kinase activity (Fig. 2,solid circles). We have previously reported an increase of 1.5–2-fold in MAP kinase activity upon addition of free radical generators (22Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Although the amplitude of stimulation seen in our experiments was very consistent, others have found greater MAP kinase activation with different stimuli and cells. This is likely due to the relatively high level of basal MAP kinase activity in our SMC cultures compared with other systems in which basal activity is minimal. Activation of MAP kinases is typically an early event in cellular activation. Therefore, we investigated the time course of AGE-RAGE-mediated activation of MAP kinase. Peak activity was observed by 10 min after exposure of cells to AGE-albumin (100 μg/ml) (Fig.3). MAP kinase activity increased as early as 2 min and returned to basal levels at 60 min. Thus, stimulation of ERK1 and ERK2 activities by AGE-albumin resulted in an early, transient stimulation of MAP kinase activity. Generation of free radicals and cellular oxidant stress has been attributed to AGEs themselves (26Mullarkey C.J. Edelstein D. Brownlee M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 27Sakurai T. Tsuchiya S. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and as a consequence of their interaction with RAGE (12Yan S.D. Schmidt A.M. Anderson G.M. Zhang J. Brett J. Zou Y.S. Pinsky D. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9889-9897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Schmidt A.-M. Hasu M. Popov D. Zhang J.H. Chen J. Yan S.D. Brett J. Cao R. Kuwabara K. Costache G. Simionescu N. Simionescu M. Stern D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8011-8807Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether AGE interaction with RAGE on SMC was necessary for MAP kinase activation. Receptor blockade was achieved by the addition of sRAGE, a truncated form consisting of only the extracellular domain of the receptor, or monospecific, polyclonal anti-RAGE IgG (Fig. 4). Addition of increasing concentrations of sRAGE prevented AGE-enhanced MAP kinase activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4, open bars). One likely explanation for the effect of sRAGE lies in its ability to bind exogenous AGEs, thereby inhibiting their interaction with cell surface RAGE and preventing generation of oxidant stress. Anti-RAGE IgG, previously shown to prevent AGE binding to RAGE (6Schmidt A.M. Vianna M. Gerlach M. Brett J. Ryan J. Kao J. Esposito C. Hegarty H. Hurley W. Clauss M. Wang F. Pan Y.-C.E. Tsang T.C. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14987-14997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also prevented AGEs from stimulating MAP kinase activity in SMCs in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4, hatched bars). In contrast, nonimmune IgG was without effect (data not shown). Thus, activation of the MAP kinase cascade required AGE-RAGE interaction at the cell surface. The critical test of our hypothesis involved determining whether AGE-induced stimulation of p21 ras was linked to MAP kinase and NF-κB activation in SMC. To evaluate this, cells were pretreated with α-hydroxyfarnesylphosphonic acid. This compound specifically inhibits farnesyltransferase, the enzyme responsible for the lipid modification of p21 ras (28Gibbs J.B. Pompliano D.L. Mosser S.D. Rands E. Lingham R.B. Singh S.B. Scolnick E.M. Kohl N.E. Oliff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7617-7620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Without this lipid, p21 ras does not associate with the plasma membrane and thus cannot activate its effectors and signal downstream (29Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Kohl N.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 175-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). We found that SMC pretreated with this inhibitor no longer responded to AGE-albumin by activating ERK1 and ERK2 kinases (Fig. 5). Furthermore, AGE-mediated nuclear translocation of NF-κB was also prevented by inhibition of farnesyltransferase (Fig. 6). These data indicate that p21 ras or a related low molecular weight G protein is required for signal transduction following AGE binding to cell surface RAGE.Figure 6Effect of farnesyltransferase inhibition on AGE-albumin-induced NF-κB activation. Cells were left untreated (− FT Inh.) or treated with α-hydroxyfarnesyl-phosphonic acid (+ FT Inh., 10 μm) for 24 h prior to addition of the indicated concentrations of AGE-albumin. After 4 h, nuclei were isolated and assayed for NF-κB binding activity.

Milbank A.J. Tauras J.M. Hajjar D.P. Hempstead B.L. Schwartz G.D. Kraemer R.T. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Campbell-Burk S. Quilliam L.A. Nature. 1996; 381: 380-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). To determine if this site is targeted by reactive oxygen species generated by AGE-albumin, we created a mutant of p21 ras in which Cys118 was changed to a Ser (30Lander H.M. Milbank A.J. Tauras J.M. Hajjar D.P. Hempstead B.L. Schwartz G.D. Kraemer R.T. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Campbell-Burk S. Quilliam L.A. Nature. 1996; 381: 380-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and overexpressed it in PC12 cells, which also express RAGE (9Brett J. Schmidt A.-M. Zou Y.-S. Yan S.-D. Weidman E. Pinsky S. Neeper M. Przysiecki M. Shaw A. Migheli A. Stern D. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1699-1712PubMed Google Scholar). These cells, termed PC12 p21 ras C118S, were compared with wild-type parental cells for their ability to respond to AGE-albumin by activation of p21 ras -dependent MAP kinase activity. As seen in Fig. 7, wild-type cells responded to AGE-albumin by activating ERK1/2 kinases, whereas PC12 p21 ras C118S cells were refractory to AGE-albumin. These data provide a molecular basis for RAGE signal transduction. Recently, a role for reactive oxygen intermediates in mediating signal transduction has become apparent. For example, the ability of platelet-derived growth factor to stimulate MAP kinase activity, DNA synthesis, and chemotaxis in vascular smooth muscle cells was completely blocked by the addition of catalase or antioxidants (15Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar). These cells were also found to produce H2O2upon growth factor addition (15Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar). Others have found that antioxidants blocked the ability of a variety of unrelated stimuli to trigger NF-κB activation (31Schreck R. Rieber P. Bauerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar). Thus, a role for free radicals in mediating signal transduction is emerging. We have previously demonstrated that interaction of AGEs with RAGE induces cellular oxidant stress, probably as a consequence of the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates (11Schmidt A.-M. Hori O. Brett J. Yan S.-D. Wautier J.-L. Stern D. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1521-1528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yan S.D. Schmidt A.M. Anderson G.M. Zhang J. Brett J. Zou Y.S. Pinsky D. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9889-9897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study our aim was to determine if cellular oxidant stress consequent to AGE-RAGE interaction would trigger the p21 ras /MAP kinase pathway. Our observations indicate that this is indeed the case because p21 ras, MAP kinase activity, and NF-κB nuclear translocation are stimulated by AGE-albumin, enhanced by glutathione depletion, and prevented by blockade of RAGE. The molecular mechanism may be due to triggering of p21 ras exchange activity by reactive oxygen modification of Cys118 on p21 ras . There are likely to be many signaling pathways initiated by AGE-RAGE interaction, but the one outlined herein is apparently important because inhibition of p21 ras blocked NF-κB activation. This transcription factor is critical for stimulation of many acute phase response genes, and thus the induction of many genes is likely to be controlled by this pathway. In fact, the heme oxygenase gene is under control of NF-κB (32Lavrosky Y. Schwartzman M.L. Levere A.D. Kappas A. Abraham N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5987-5991Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) and is induced upon AGE-RAGE interaction (12Yan S.D. Schmidt A.M. Anderson G.M. Zhang J. Brett J. Zou Y.S. Pinsky D. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9889-9897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, our previous work has indicated that AGE-mediated activation of NF-κB results in binding of this transcription factor to specific sites within the promoter of the VCAM-1 gene (33Schmidt A.M. Hori O. Chen J.X. Li J.F. Crandall J. Zhang J. Cao R. Yan S.D. Brett J. Stern D. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1395-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Enhanced expression of this endothelial cell adhesion molecule alters cellular phenotype, potentially resulting in the adherence of mononuclear phagocytes to the vessel wall (34Cybulsky M. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Science. 1991; 251: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). In this work, we have examined signaling pathways likely to be of importance when AGEs ligate vascular smooth muscle cell RAGE. One of the consequences of this interaction might be enhanced production of monocyte and smooth muscle cell chemoattractant factors (14Fiedman J. Pauly R. Stern D. Schmidt A.-M. Monticone R. Crow M. Circulation. 1994; 90: 1567Google Scholar). Identification of the molecular basis underlying these events, possibly linked to the accelerated vascular disease observed in diabetes, is likely a central step toward understanding the consequences of AGE-RAGE interaction not only in vascular smooth muscle cells but also in diverse cell types such as endothelial cells and mononuclear phagocytes. The present report advances our knowledge of the processes set in motion when AGEs bind cellular RAGE, an event that culminates in transcription factor activation and alteration of cellular properties. Past studies have not identified the source of the reactive oxygen intermediates generated by the AGE-RAGE complex. On one hand, AGEs by themselves produce reactive oxygen species that could interact directly or indirectly with critical cellular targets. Alternatively, AGE engagement of RAGE could initiate a series of events resulting in intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species, possibly by a system analogous to that of the NADPH oxidase system of neutrophils. Detailed studies examining these possibilities are ongoing. AGEs are prevalent in certain pathophysiological conditions such as diabetes (4Sell D.R. Monnier V.M. J. Biol.

Therefore, understanding how AGEs transmit their signal to the nucleus will likely yield important insights into the mechanisms of these pathophysiological processes and provide targets for intervention."
https://openalex.org/W1996677209,"In a previous study (Kollár, R., Petráková, E., Ashwell, G., Robbins, P. W., and Cabib, E. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 1170–1178), the linkage region between chitin and β(1→3)-glucan was solubilized and isolated in the form of oligosaccharides, after digestion of yeast cell walls with β(1→3)-glucanase, reduction with borotritide, and subsequent incubation with chitinase. In addition to the oligosaccharides, the solubilized fraction contained tritium-labeled high molecular weight material. We have now investigated the nature of this material and found that it represents areas in which all four structural components of the cell wall, β(1→3)-glucan, β(1→6)-glucan, chitin, and mannoprotein are linked together. Mannoprotein, with a protein moiety about 100 kDa in apparent size, is attached to β(1→6)-glucan through a remnant of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor containing five α-linked mannosyl residues. The β(1→6)-glucan has some β(1→3)-linked branches, and it is to these branches that the reducing terminus of chitin chains appears to be attached in a β(1→4) or β(1→2) linkage. Finally, the reducing end of β(1→6)-glucan is connected to the nonreducing terminal glucose of β(1→3)-glucan through a linkage that remains to be established. A fraction of the isolated material has three of the main components but lacks mannoprotein. From these results and previous findings on the linkage between mannoproteins and β(1→6)-glucan, it is concluded that the latter polysaccharide has a central role in the organization of the yeast cell wall. The possible mechanism of synthesis and physiological significance of the cross-links is discussed. In a previous study (Kollár, R., Petráková, E., Ashwell, G., Robbins, P. W., and Cabib, E. (1995) J. Biol.

The possible mechanism of synthesis and physiological significance of the cross-links is discussed. Cell walls are essential for the survival of fungal cells. Digestion of cell walls in the absence of an osmotic protector leads to cell lysis due to the high internal turgor pressure. Thus, substances that interfere with cell wall synthesis may be considered as potential antifungal agents (1Cabib E. Bowers B. Sburlati A. Silverman S.J. Microbiol. Sci. 1988; 5: 370-375PubMed Google Scholar). Because of its rigidity, the cell wall determines the shape of fungal cells. For that reason, cell wall formation has been used as a model for morphogenesis (1Cabib E. Bowers B. Sburlati A. Silverman S.J. Microbiol. Sci. 1988; 5: 370-375PubMed Google Scholar). The major components of fungal cell walls are polysaccharides and glycoproteins (2Ruiz-Herrera J. Fungal Cell Wall: Structure, Synthesis and Assembly. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992Google Scholar). In the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the cell wall contains β(1→3)-d-glucan, β(1→6)-d-glucan, chitin, and mannoprotein(s) (3Cabib E. Roberts R. Bowers B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 763-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The polysaccharides appear to have a structural function, whereas the mannoprotein(s) may act as “filler” and are important for the permeability of the cell wall (4Zlotnik H. Fernández M.P. Bowers B. Cabib E. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 1018-1026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5De Nobel J.G. Klis F.M. Priem J. Munnik T. Van Den Ende H. Yeast. 1990; 6: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). How can one explain the strength and resilience of the fungal cell wall? Recent results withS. cerevisiae suggest that the answer may be found in the existence of covalent linkages between the different components of the wall that would give rise to a continuous and consequently stronger fabric. Thus, previous studies in our laboratories showed the presence of linkages between chitin and β(1→3)-glucan (6Kollár R. Petráková E. Ashwell G. Robbins P.W. Cabib E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1170-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) as well as among glycoproteins, β(1→6)-glucan, and β(1→3)-glucan (7Kapteyn J.C. Montijn R.C. Vink E. de la Cruz J. Llobell A. Shimoi H. Lipke P. Klis F.M. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The strategy for the investigation of interconnections between chitin and β(1→3)-glucan consisted in the digestion of cell walls with β(1→3)-glucanase, followed by labeling of the exposed reducing ends with borotritide and enzymatic hydrolysis of the chitin. This procedure led to the isolation of a family of tritiated oligosaccharides that contained the sought after connection, i.e. a β(1→4)-linkage between the reducing end of a chitin chain and the nonreducing end of a β(1→3)-glucan chain (6Kollár R. Petráková E. Ashwell G. Robbins P.W. Cabib E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1170-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The oligosaccharides were separated on a Bio-Gel P-2 sizing column. The void volume fraction of this column contained a fairly large amount of tritium-labeled material of high molecular weight (6Kollár R. Petráková E. Ashwell G. Robbins P.W. Cabib E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1170-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We have now studied the structure of this material. The results described below show that it represents a region or regions of the cell wall where all four major components, β(1→3)-glucan, β(1→6)-glucan, chitin, and mannoprotein, are linked together. In this complex, chitin is directly attached to a branch of β(1→6)-glucan. β-N-Acetylhexosaminidase, β-galactosidase, and α-mannosidase (all from jack bean) were from Oxford Glycosystems. β-Glucosidase from sweet almonds and recombinant endoglycosidase-H and proteinase K were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim; glycopeptidase F was from Life Technologies, Inc.; Zymolyase 100 T was from Seikagaku; and proteinase E (Pronase) was from Sigma.

Polyacrylamide gels were from Novex, and PVDF membranes were from Millipore Corp. Chitinase from S. marcescens was prepared as described (8Roberts R.L. Cabib E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 127: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and endo-β(1→6)-glucanase was prepared from B. circulans WL-12 as described (9Fleet G.H. Phaff H.J. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 207-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiaestrain used was ECY36–3C (MAT a chs1–23 chs2::LEU2 trp1–1 ura3–52 leu2–2). Cells were grown in YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) at 30 °C. The procedure was as described previously (6Kollár R. Petráková E. Ashwell G. Robbins P.W. Cabib E. J. Biol.

The isolated cell walls from 30 g (wet weight) of yeast were suspended in 860 ml of 50 mmTris-chloride buffer, pH 7.5, and incubated with 163 ml of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride-treated Zymolyase (56 mg of Zymolyase 100 T was dissolved in 154 ml of 66 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 0.8 m mannitol to which 250 mg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in 9.4 ml of isopropyl alcohol was added and incubated 1 h at 30 °C) for 4 h at 37 °C until the absorbance at 660 nm had decreased to about 15% of the original value. The insoluble residue was recovered by centrifugation. Washing of this material with Tris buffer, 1% SDS, and water, reduction with sodium borotritide, and digestion with chitinase were as described previously (6Kollár R. Petráková E. Ashwell G. Robbins P.W. Cabib E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1170-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Any insoluble residue after chitinase digestion was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant fluid was used directly for Bio-Gel P-2 column chromatography (6Kollár R. Petráková E. Ashwell G.

The material eluting in the void volume (fraction V 0) was used for further analysis. TritiatedV 0 fraction (5.6 × 106 cpm) was evaporated to dryness, dissolved in 500 μl of 50 mmTris-chloride, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl (binding buffer), and applied to a concanavalin A (ConA)-Sepharose column (0.9 × 9 cm). Elution was with binding buffer, and 0.45-ml fractions were collected. At fraction 34, the eluting solution was changed to 0.5 m α-methylmannoside in 50 mmTris-chloride containing 0.25 m NaCl to displace the bound material. A portion of each fraction (10 μl) was counted. The fractions containing radioactivity and corresponding either to the unretained (ConA−) or to the bound (ConA+) material were pooled and concentrated by evaporation. High performance anionic exchange chromatography (HPAEC) and paper chromatography were performed as described previously (6Kollár R. Petráková E. Ashwell G. Robbins P.W. Cabib E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1170-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Cell wall proteins were separated by either 18% or linear gradient (2.2–20%) polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (10Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206658) Google Scholar). For Western analysis, gels (2.2–20%) were blotted onto PVDF membrane, and antibody staining was carried out as described by Montijn et al. (11Montijn R.C. van Rinsum J. van Schagen F.A. Klis F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19338-19342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total carbohydrate was measured with the anthrone reagent (12Trevelyan W.E. Harrison J.S. Biochem.

Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (40255) Google Scholar). Samples were diluted to 40 μl with water, mixed with 30 μl of 5% phenol and 250 μl of concentrated sulfuric acid in 96-well microtitration plates, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Absorbance at 490 nm was measured in a Bio-Tek EL309 autoreader. Free GlcNAc was quantified by the method of Reissig et al. (14Reissig J.L. Strominger J.L. Leloir L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 959-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and combined GlcNAc was quantified by the same method after digestion of sample with chitinase and Glusulase (6Kollár R.

Different fractions were transgalactosylated by a modification (15Miller M.W. Hanover J.A. J. Biol.

Sample, containing 57 μmol of total carbohydrate (as glucose) was evaporated to dryness, diluted to 3 ml with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, containing 20 mm galactose, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 10 mm MnCl2, and incubated with 15 μl of UDP-[U-14C]galactose (0.375 μCi; specific activity, 305 mCi/mmol) and 17.1 μl (0.8 units) of autogalactosylated (17Hanover J.A. Cohen C.K. Willingham M.C. Park M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9887-9894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) bovine galactosyltransferase for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of 0.02% NaN3. After the addition of unlabeled UDP-galactose (92 μl, containing 0.92 mg in 2% ethanol) incubation was continued for an additional 4 h. The volume of the incubation mixture was reduced to ∼500 μl by evaporation, and the sample was applied to an appropriate gel chromatography column. The second incubation with unlabeled UDP-galactose was omitted in the case of the endo-H-released material from fraction M. [14C]Galactose-labeled ConA+ (1.2 × 106 cpm of 14C) was diluted to 200 μl with a solution containing 50 mmTris-chloride, pH 8, and 5 mm CaCl2. After adding 15 mg of proteinase E in 4 ml of the same buffer, the mixture was incubated 24 h at 37 °C in the presence of 0.02% sodium azide. The incubated mixture was concentrated to ∼500 μl by evaporation and applied to a Sephadex G-100 column (1 × 85 cm). The fraction eluting in the void volume, which was almost devoid of14C radioactivity, was collected. A portion (6.3 mg as hexose) of this fraction was acetolyzed by a modification (18Nakajima T. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7679-7684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the method described by Kocourek and Ballou (19Kocourek J. Ballou C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 1175-1181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), followed by deacetylation with sodium methoxide (18Nakajima T. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7679-7684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was measured either spectrophotometrically or by the procedure of Lowry et al.(20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian XL-300 spectrometer, operating at 300 MHz (1H) and 75 MHz (13C) at a probe temperature of 35 °C. Each sample was dissolved in D2O, and a trace of acetone was used as an internal standard (for1H-NMR spectra δ 2.217 ppm; for 13C-NMR spectra δ 31.07 ppm). The ConA+ fraction was labeled with [14C]galactose as described above and digested with β(1→6)-glucanase (see legend of Fig. 6). Low molecular weight material (Fig. 6 b) was fractionated on an E. cristagalli lectin-agarose column (Fig. 7 a), and the [14C]galactose-containing fraction (fraction B) was further chromatographed on a Bio-Gel P-2 column (Fig. 7 c). Peak III (Fig. 7 c, 13 nmol of carbohydrate as glucose) was evaporated to dryness, dissolved in 100 μl of 0.01 mNaOH, and reduced with 10 μl of sodium borotritide (1 mCi of NaB3H4 in 100 μl of dimethylformamide) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by an additional 2 h with 0.7 mg of unlabeled NaBH4 in 0.01 m NaOH. The excess of borohydride was eliminated by the addition of 20 μl of 1m acetic acid followed by evaporation of the sample with methanol three times. The sample was applied to an E. cristagalli lectin-agarose column (conditions as in Fig. 2), and lectin-retarded radioactivity was applied to a Bio-Gel P-2 column (1 × 85 cm), which was eluted with 0.1 m acetic acid. The radioactive fractions were pooled and evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in 100 μl of 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 3.5, and digested with 1 unit of jack bean β-galactosidase for 16 h at 37 °C in the presence of 0.02% NaN3. The incubated mixture was applied to a Bio-Gel P-2 column and eluted as above. The tritium-containing fractions, corresponding to degalactosylated peak III, were pooled and concentrated by evaporation. This material was analyzed by mass spectrometry as outlined below. A portion of the oligosaccharide (1 nmol) was evaporated to dryness, dissolved in 25 μl of 2 m trifluoroacetic acid, and hydrolyzed for 2 h at 100 °C. After new evaporation to dryness, the residue was dissolved in 50 μl of water, and a 25-μl sample was analyzed by HPAEC.Figure 13Release of an oligosaccharide from fraction M by hydrofluoric acid. a, a portion of fraction M (3 × 104 cpm) was evaporated to dryness, dissolved in 200 μl of precooled 50% hydrofluoric acid, and incubated at 0 °C for 72 h. The digest was pipetted onto frozen 10 m NaOH (400 μl) in a microcentrifuge tube placed in ice. The resulting suspension was spun down, and the NaF precipitate was washed twice with 100 μl of water. Supernatants were combined and applied to a Sephadex G-100 column (1 × 85 cm), which was eluted with 25 mmTris-chloride, pH 7.5, containing 0.02% NaN3.

After 1 h at room temperature, 10–50 μl of methyl iodide were added, and the solution was set for 1 h at room temperature with occasional vortex mixing (21Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3177) Google Scholar). Samples were partitioned by adding 1 ml of chloroform, and the suspension was back-extracted twice with 2–3 ml of 30% acetic acid. The chloroform layer was dried, and the samples were stored at −20 °C. Periodate oxidation (22Angel A.-S. Nilsson B. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 193: 587-607Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) of degalactosylated peak III was performed by using a 9 mmsolution of NaIO4 (50 μl) buffered with 0.1 msodium acetate at pH 5.5 in the dark at 4 °C for 3 days. The reaction was quenched with 1 μl of ethylene glycol, and incubation continued overnight under the same conditions. The sample was neutralized with 0.1 m NaOH and reduced by the direct addition of solid NaB2H4 (1 mg) at room temperature for 16 h. Excess reducing agent was destroyed by the addition of 5 μl of acetic acid, and the solution was dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Borate was removed by the repeated addition and drying with methanol. Periodate-oxidized and reduced oligosaccharides were then methylated as above. The instrument used was a TSQ 700 (Finnigan-MAT, San Jose, CA) equipped with an Analytica (Analytica of Branford, CT) electrospray ion source. Methylated oligosaccharides were analyzed by direct infusion at flow rates of 0.85 μl/min of a 6:4 methanol:water electrospray buffer with 0.25 mm NaOH. Yeast cell walls were digested with β(1→3)-glucanase, labeled by reduction with borotritide, and further hydrolyzed with chitinase as described previously (6Kollár R. Petráková E. Ashwell G. Robbins P.W. Cabib E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1170-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). After chromatography of the material solubilized by chitinase on a Bio-Gel P-2 column (6Kollár R. Petráková E. Ashwell G. Robbins P.W. Cabib E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1170-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), the fraction emerging at the void volume (fractionV 0) was collected. This early fraction, as well as later peaks, contained radioactivity (6Kollár R. Petráková E. Ashwell G. Robbins P.W. Cabib E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1170-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Initial experiments were directed to ascertain the general composition of the material and its relationships with known cell wall components. Labeling with borotritide required prior treatment with β(1→3)-glucanase. When borotritide was used on the intact walls, only 24% of the radioactivity was incorporated into fraction V 0. This result suggested that most substances in the void volume peak had been attached to β(1→3)-glucan in the intact cell wall. Similarly, the solubilization of the material upon chitinase treatment clearly indicated that it had been linked to chitin. In our previous study of the chitin-β(1→3)-glucan connection, it had been easy to identify remaining GlcNAc in the bridge region, which was represented by relatively small oligosaccharides. In the present case, however, chromatography of fraction V 0 on Sephacryl S-400 indicated a size in the range of 200–250 kDa (results not shown), whereas sugar determinations showed the presence of glucose and mannose with very little if any N-acetylglucosamine (see below). To look for the presumably few GlcNAc groups that may have been involved in the linkage to chitin, we availed ourselves of a sensitive and specific technique that consists in labeling nonreducing GlcNAc residues with [14C]galactose by incubation with UDP-[14C]Gal in the presence of bovine galactosyltransferase (16Trayer I.P. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6666-6675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of fractionV 0 in this fashion resulted in the incorporation of radioactivity (Fig. 1 b). A control in which fraction V 0 was pretreated with β-N-acetylglucosaminidase showed no incorporation (Fig.1 a). This result confirms the covalent linkages of substances in fraction V 0 to chitin. It should be kept in mind that, because Serratia chitinase cleaves two GlcNAc residues at a time, even-numbered chains may be excised completely without leaving any amino sugar, as was found for the chitin-β(1→3)-glucan linkage (6Kollár R. Petráková E. Ashwell G. Robbins P.W. Cabib E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1170-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Therefore, assuming a random chain length, the residues labeled in the experiment of Fig. 1 may correspond to only half of the connecting chitin chains, those with an odd number of GlcNAc residues. The evidence outlined above points to a linkage of the material in fraction V 0 to both β(1→3)-glucan and chitin but does not address the question of how many different substances are present in fraction V 0. Further fractionation was required to deal with this problem. Because of the presence of mannose (see below) in fraction V 0, we used chromatography on ConA-Sepharose columns (see “Experimental Procedures”). Somewhat more than half of the tritium label went through the column without binding, whereas the remainder was attached and required α-methylmannoside for elution. The two fractions were designated ConA− and ConA+, respectively. Both fractions could be labeled with [14C]galactose in the manner outlined above. To ascertain whether the galactose (hence the GlcNAc) was attached to the same substance(s) that carried the tritium label, the derivatized fractions were applied to a column of agarose-bound E. cristagalli lectin, which binds specifically to galactosyl and Gal-GlcNAc groups (Fig.2). Both ConA− and ConA+ were separated into three fractions, I, II, and III. The first one was not bound to the column and contained only tritium; the second one was retarded and contained tritium and a small proportion of14C; the last fraction required lactose plus GlcNAc for elution and contained both isotopes, but with a much higher percentage of 14C. We interpret these results as follows: (a) the first fraction represents material previously joined to even-numbered chitin chains, which were completely eliminated by chitinase; (b)"

This study examined the role of various cis-acting regulatory elements in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induction of the human TNF-α promoter in cells of monocytic lineage. Functional analysis of monocytic THP-1 cells transfected with plasmids containing various lengths of TNF-α promoter localized enhancer elements in a region (−182 to −37 base pairs (bp)) that were required for optimal transcription of the TNF-α gene in response to LPS. Two regions were identified: region I (−182 to −162 bp) contained an overlapping Sp1/Egr-1 site, and region II (−119 to −88) contained CRE and NF-κB (designated κB3) sites. In unstimulated THP-1, CRE-binding protein and, to a lesser extent, c-Jun complexes were found to bind to the CRE site. LPS stimulation increased the binding of c-Jun-containing complexes. In addition, LPS stimulation induced the binding of cognate nuclear factors to the Egr-1 and κB3 sites, which were identified as Egr-1 and p50/p65, respectively. The CRE and κB3 sites in region II together conferred strong LPS responsiveness to a heterologous promoter, whereas individually they failed to provide transcriptional activation. Furthermore, increasing the spacing between the CRE and the κB3 sites completely abolished LPS induction, suggesting a cooperative interaction between c-Jun complexes and p50/p65. These studies indicate that maximal LPS induction of the TNF-α promoter is mediated by concerted participation of at least two separatecis-acting regulatory elements.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), 1The abbreviations used are: TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α LPS, lipopolysaccharide; bp, base pair(s); PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CRE, cAMP-responsive element; CREB, CRE-binding protein. produced primarily by cells of monocytic lineage, is involved in a plethora of cell regulatory and differentiative processes. TNF-α is also a vital mediator of the host defense against infection and tumor formation. On the other hand, TNF-α is involved in the pathophysiology of numerous diseases including septic shock, cachexia, and various autoimmune diseases (1Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Med. 1994; 45: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Therefore, TNF-α exhibits both beneficial and pathologic effects, a feature that requires rigorous control of its expression. Regulation of human TNF-α expression in cells of monocytic lineage is quite complex, involving controls at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (2Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In addition, both 5′ and 3′ nucleotide sequences influence LPS-induced transcription of human TNF-α cDNA transfected into the murine macrophage RAW264.7 cell line (3Han J. Huez G. Beutler B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1843-1848PubMed Google Scholar). The promoter region of the human TNF-α gene contains a complex array of potential regulatory elements. In T cells, cooperation between the CRE and the adjacent κB3 sites is required for calcium-mediated TNF-α promoter activity (4Tsai E.Y. Jain J. Pesavento P.A. Rao A. Goldfeld A . E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and cooperation between the CRE and the adjacent Ets sites for PMA-induced activity (5Kramer B. Weigmann K. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6577-6583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, the role or these regulatory elements in transcriptional activation of the TNF-α gene in human monocytes remains unclear. To date, published reports indicate that activation of TNF-α gene transcription in human monocytes in response to various stimuli is mediated by a region within −200 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (6Rhoades K.L.

Using a promonocytic leukemia cell line, U937, several nuclear factor binding elements, including AP-1 (6Rhoades K.L. Golub S.H. Economou J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22102-22107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Egr-1 (7Kramer B. Meichle A. Hensel G. Charnay P. Kronke M. Biochim. Biophys.

Immunol. 1995; 161: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), have been suggested to mediate TNF-α transcription in response to PMA or cytokines. These results appear to be incomplete and often conflicting. No consensus has been reached, and no cooperation between these regulatory elements was established. Although the reasons for these discrepancies are unclear, the U937 cell line may be too poorly differentiated to serve as a suitable model of gene expression in cells of monocytic lineage. Transcriptional activation of the murine TNF-α gene in murine macrophages has been demonstrated to be predominantly dependent on a region in the murine TNF-α promoter upstream of −451 bp, which contains NF-κB DNA binding motifs (13Shakhov A.N. Collat M.A. Vassalli P. Nedospasov S.A. Jongeneel V. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 14Collart M.A. Baeuerle P. Vassalli P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1498-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A major histocompatibility complex class II Y box was also inferred to play a role in LPS inducibility (13Shakhov A.N. Collat M.A. Vassalli P. Nedospasov S.A. Jongeneel V. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 14Collart M.A. Baeuerle P. Vassalli P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1498-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, the role of NF-κB in the transcriptional activation of the human TNF-α gene in human monocytes in response to LPS is controversial. An early study using murine monocytic cells failed to identify a role for the κB sites in transcriptional activation of human TNF-α in response to LPS or virus (15Goldfeld A.E. Doyle C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9769-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, recent reports employing pharmacological agents that block the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, such as pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (16Ziegler-Heitbrock L.H.W. Sternsdorf T. Liese J. Belohradsky B. Weber C. Wedel A. Schreck R. Bauerle P. Strobel M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6986-6993PubMed Google Scholar), and sodium salicylate (17Oeth P. Mackman N. Blood. 1995; 86: 4144-4152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrated a suppression of TNF-α gene expression. Moreover, LPS induction of the human TNF-α promoter in human monocytic THP-1 leukemia cells was mediated by the κB3 site at −97 bp (11Trede N.S. Tsytsykova A.V. Chatila T. Goldfeld A.E. Geha R.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 902-908PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest a likelihood that murine monocytic cells are not suitable for the analysis of the regulation of the human TNF-α promoter. In this study, we have employed a line of THP-1 cells that exhibits high inducibility for TNF-α gene transcription similar to that of freshly isolated human monocytes. We have performed a comprehensive analysis of the role of various cis-acting regulatory elements in the transcriptional regulation of the human TNF-α gene. Using LPS stimulation as a paradigm, we find that a mechanism involving several transcription factors is required for maximal TNF-α promoter activity in human monocytes. THP-1 monocytic cells were maintained in medium RPMI 1640 with 8% fetal calf serum. Human peripheral blood monocytes were isolated by gradient centrifugation as described (18Fan S.-T. Mackman N.

Multiple copies of oligonucleotides containing sequences from the human TNF-α promoter were cloned upstream of the minimal SV40 promoter driving expression of the luciferase reporter gene in pGL2-promoter (Promega Corp.). Sequences of oligonucleotides used for producing these constructs are listed in Table I. All plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. A DEAE-dextran transfection procedure (18Fan S.-T. Mackman N. Cui M.-J. Edgington T.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3266-3274PubMed Google Scholar, 20Mackman N. Brand K. Edgington T.S. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1517-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) was used. Briefly, 3 × 107 THP-1 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline and incubated for 10 to 20 min at 37 °C with 5 μg of plasmid DNA and 80 μg of DEAE-dextran (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). During incubation, cells were monitored closely for permeability to trypan blue. Transfection was stopped by adding large volumes of Tris-buffered saline, usually after 10 min, when 20–30% of cells are permeable to trypan blue. After washing with Tris-buffered saline, cells were cultivated in media for 48 h. Cells were stimulated with 5 μg/ml LPS (Escherichia coli O111:B4 purchased from Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) in a 96-well plate at 1 × 106 cells/well. After 7 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were harvested and luciferase activity was determined using an assay kit (Promega) and the Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). Nuclear extracts were prepared from 5 × 106THP-1 cells or peripheral blood monocytes stimulated under various conditions as described (18Fan S.-T. Mackman N. Cui M.-J. Edgington T.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3266-3274PubMed Google Scholar, 20Mackman N. Brand K. Edgington T.S. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1517-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations in nuclear extracts were determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). Oligonucleotide probes were radiolabeled using [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham). Nuclear extracts (1–5 μg) were incubated with radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes (0.2–1 × 106 cpm) in 2 × binding buffer (100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 40 mm Hepes) for 20 min at room temperature. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis through 6% non-denaturing acrylamide gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer. For antibody supershift experiments, nuclear extracts were preincubated 20 min with 2 μg of antibody before the addition of the labeled probe. To define the 5′ boundary of LPS responsive elements, THP-1 cells were transiently transfected with a series of plasmids containing progressive truncations of the 5′ promoter sequence between −1311 bp and −36 bp. Deletion of sequences upstream of −182 had no significant effect on LPS-induction of the TNF-α promoter activity (Fig. 1). Removal of a region from −182 to −162, which contains an Sp1/Egr-1 overlapping site, reduced LPS inducibility by 50% (from 13.3-fold to 7.8-fold). Removal of a region between −161 and −121 had no significant effect on the LPS inducibility. In contrast, deletion to −95, which removes Ets, CRE, and κB (κB3) sites, further reduced LPS inducibility (Fig. 1). Finally, deletion to −36 removed a region containing a Sp1 site and abolished basal promoter activity. These results provide new and substantial evidence that LPS induction of the TNF-α gene in monocytes involves at least two regulatory elements; region I (−182 to −162) and region II (−120 to −96). To determine the functional role of nuclear binding motifs in the region identified by 5′-truncation analysis, plasmids with specific site-directed mutations were examined. Mutation in the Egr-1 site (−169 bp), the CRE site (−106 bp), as well as the κB3 site (−97 bp), markedly reduced LPS induction. In contrast, mutation of the AP-1 (−57 bp) or AP-2 (−36 bp) had no effect on LPS induction of the TNF-α promoter (Fig. 2). These results are consistent with our findings using the 5′-deletion series of plasmids shown in Fig. 1. To further explore the potential of these nuclear factor binding motifs to function as enhancer elements, we examined their ability to confer inducibility to heterologous promoter. Neither four tandem copies of the κB3 nor two copies of the CRE sites alone conferred LPS inducibility to a SV40 minimal promoter (Fig.3 A). However, when two or three copies of a DNA fragment spanning both the CRE and the κB sites were cloned upstream of the SV40 promoter strong LPS inducibility was observed (Fig. 3, A and B). Mutation of either the CRE site (−110/−86 m1) or the κB3 site (−110/−86 m2) completely abolished LPS inducibility (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that the LPS induction of human TNF-α transcription requires cooperative interaction between proteins bound to the CRE and κB sites. There is only 1 base pair separating the CRE and κB3 sites. Whether the close proximity of the CRE site and the κB3 site is required for the optimal transactivation of TNF-α was investigated. For these experiments, 5, 10, or 15 additional base pairs were added between CRE and κB3 sites and oligonucleotides were cloned into pGL2-promoter. These insertions created 1/2, 1, or 1 1/2 extra turns of the DNA helix between these two sites. Fig. 3 C shows that insertion of DNA between these two sites abolished LPS inducibility. EMSA were performed to determine which transcription factors bind to sites in regions I and II of the human TNF-α promoter. An oligonucleotide containing only the Egr-1 site bound an LPS and phorbol ester-inducible complex (Fig.4 A). This complex was not observed when an oligonucleotide containing a mutant Egr-1 site was used as the probe (Fig. 4 A, lanes 4–6). In addition, this LPS-inducible complex was supershifted by anti-Egr-1 antibody (Fig.4 A, lane 9), demonstrating that Egr-1 bound to this site. A prominent complex was observed when nuclear extracts from unstimulated cells were incubated with an oligonucleotide spanning the overlapping Sp1/Egr-1 sites (−182 to −157 bp) (Fig. 4 B,lane 1). This complex was not induced by LPS (lane 2) but was supershifted using an anti-Sp1 antibody (lane 3). In addition, this complex was not observed using an oligonucleotide containing a mutated Sp1 site (Fig. 4 B,lanes 5–8). Taken together, these results demonstrated that Sp1 bound to this site. In addition to the constitutively expressed Sp1 complex, LPS stimulation of cells resulted in the formation of an Egr-1 complex that bound to the oligonucleotide containing overlapping Sp1/Egr-1 sites (Fig. 4 B, lane 2). Similarly, this LPS inducible Egr-1 complex was observed using the Sp1mut/Egr-1 oligonucleotide as a probe (Fig.4 B, lane 6). The Egr-1 complex was not affected by the addition of an anti-Sp1 antibody (Fig. 4 B,lanes 3 and 7), but was supershifted with an anti-Egr-1 antibody (Fig. 4 B, lanes 4 and8). EMSA were performed with oligonucleotides spanning three putative κB sites: κB1 (−594 to −577), κB2 (−216 to −199), and κB3 (−104 to −87) (TableI). As depicted in Fig. 5 A, LPS stimulation of cells resulted in the formation of nuclear protein-DNA complexes with κB1 (lane 2) and κB3 (lane 6), but not with κB2 (lane 4). More protein bound to κB1 that κB3. Similar results were found using nuclear extracts from human peripheral blood monocytes (Fig.5 B). Monospecific anti-p50 and anti-p65 antibodies were used in supershift experiments to identify the protein composition of the complexes formed with the κB1 and κB3 sites. As shown in Fig.5 C, the LPS induced complex binding either to the κB1 or to the κB3 oligonucleotides were supershifted by anti-p50 and also by anti-p65 antibodies (Fig. 5 C), indicating that they were composed of p50/p65 heterodimers. Furthermore, mutation of the κB3 site (κB3 m2, Table I) abolished binding of p50/p65 (data not shown). Importantly, the same mutation significantly reduced LPS inducibility of the TNF-α promoter (Fig. 2). Using a prototypic CRE site as a probe, we demonstrated that CREB was constitutively expressed in unstimulated THP-1 cells and that CREB binding was not induced by LPS (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, LPS stimulation increased the amount of protein binding to the non-consensus CRE site from the TNF-α promoter (Fig.6 B, compare lanes 1 and 4). Antibody supershift experiments were performed to determine the proteins that bound to the CRE site (Fig. 6 B). In unstimulated cells, the majority of the complex was supershifted using an anti-CREB antibody, whereas only a minor supershift was observed using an anti-c-Jun antibody. In LPS-stimulated cells, the anti-c-Jun antibody supershift the majority of the complex, whereas the anti-CREB antibody formed a minor supershift band. These results suggest that LPS does not increase the binding of CREB, consistent with our results using a prototype CRE site (Fig. 6 A), and that LPS increases binding of c-Jun-containing complexes to the CRE site from the TNF-α promoter. Using an oligonucleotide containing a mutated CRE site (CREm2, TableI), we observed a reduction in the total amount of protein binding (Fig. 6 C, lane 2). In addition, LPS stimulation did not increase complex formation (lane 3). This complex was supershifted by an anti-CREB antibody (lane 4) but was not recognized by an anti-c-Jun antibody (lane 5), suggesting that small amounts of CREB still bound to the mutated CRE site. Since these same base substitutions completely abolished the functional activity of the CRE site in transfected cells (Fig.3 B), these results provide additional evidence that c-Jun-containing complexes, rather than CREB, play a crucial role in LPS induction of the TNF-α promoter. In this report, we have defined two cis-acting regulatory elements in the human TNF-α promoter that mediated maximal LPS induction of TNF-α gene expression in cells of monocytic lineage. Region I contained an overlapping Sp1/Egr-1 site (−182 to −162), whereas region II (−120 to −96) contained CRE and κB sites. Functional studies demonstrated that Egr-1 binding to region I was required for LPS induction of the TNF-α promoter in monocytes. Egr-1 protein expression was induced by LPS stimulation (21Coleman D.L. Bartiss A.H. Sukhatme V.P. Liu J. Rupprecht H.D. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3045-3051PubMed Google Scholar). The Egr-1 site at −169 bp is part of the Sp1/Egr-1 overlapping sequence motif. In unstimulated monocytes, Sp1 binds to this site, whereas upon LPS stimulation it is likely that Egr-1 displaces Sp1 to mediate induction of TNF-α promoter activity. Previously, we have shown that Egr-1 can displace Sp1 from a similar overlapping Sp1/Egr-1 site (22Cui M.-Z. Parry G.C.N. Oeth P. Larson H. Smith M. Huang R.-P. Adamson E.D. Mackman N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2731-2739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The role of Sp1 bound to this upstream Sp1 site at −172 is unknown, although our results using a plasmid containing a mutation in the Sp1 site suggest that it does not mediate basal expression. In contrast, mutation of the Sp1 site at −56 bp dramatically reduces basal expression by 65%. 2J. Yao and S.-T. Fan, submitted for publication. Further functional studies showed that the CRE and κB3 sites in region II were required for LPS induction of the TNF-α promoter. We demonstrated that κB3 (−97) bound p50/p65 heterodimers. In contrast, we found no role for κB1 (−588) despite its ability to bind p50/p65. A recent study by Trede et al. (11Trede N.S. Tsytsykova A.V. Chatila T. Goldfeld A.E. Geha R.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 902-908PubMed Google Scholar) also showed a role for κB3 in LPS induction of the TNF-α promoter in THP-1 cells. However, these investigators did not identify other regulatory regions, possibly due to the low level of induction (about 4-fold) of the TNF-α promoter (11Trede N.S. Tsytsykova A.V. Chatila T. Goldfeld A.E. Geha R.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 902-908PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, our studies are in agreement with an earlier report (16Ziegler-Heitbrock L.H.W. Sternsdorf T. Liese J. Belohradsky B. Weber C. Wedel A. Schreck R. Bauerle P. Strobel M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6986-6993PubMed Google Scholar), showing that p50/p65 binds with much less avidity to κB3 than κB1 (Fig. 5). Therefore, it is possible that protein-protein interaction of p50/p65 with c-Jun proteins bound to the adjacent CRE site is required to stabilize the formation of a transcriptional complex that mediates induction of the TNF-α promoter. In monocytic cells, the CRE site in the TNF-α promoter constitutively bound CREB (Fig. 6). Upon LPS stimulation, the amount of CREB binding remains unchanged, but there was a marked increase in c-Jun binding. LPS induces c-jun expression (23Dokter W.H.A. Esselink M.T. Halie M.R. Vellenga E. Blood. 1993; 81: 337-343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the increases in c-Jun-containing complexes observed in this study were due to de novo protein synthesis. Furthermore, the transactivating activity of these c-Jun complexes may be increased due to post-translational phosphorylation (24Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar). As reported recently, LPS stimulation of THP-1 cells resulted in rapid activation of JNK (25Hambleton J. Weinstein S.L. Lem L. DeFranco A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2774-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of c-Jun by JNK significantly enhances the transactivation potential of these factors (26Smeal T. Binetruy B. Mercola D. Grover-Bardwick E. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3507-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The non-consensus CRE sequence of TNF-α promoter TGAGCTCA was shown to have a lower binding affinity for c-Jun/ATF-2 complex than a consensus CRE sequence (27Newell C.L. Deisseroth A.B. Lopez-Berestein G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 56: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These variations of sequences and the resulting variation in binding of these bZIP proteins could play a role in the modulation of TNF-α expression in response to various signals. Importantly, base substitution in the CRE site that reduced CREB binding but abolished c-Jun binding abrogated the functional activity of this site, suggesting that c-Jun-containing complexes bound to region II are required for LPS induction of the TNF-α promoter. The molecular mechanisms by which binding of the nuclear proteins at this CRE site regulate the activation of TNF-α gene expression await further elucidation. Parallel to our findings for monocytic cells, it was demonstrated recently that both the κB3 site and the adjacent upstream CRE site are required for the calcium-stimulated TNF-α transcription in human T cells (4Tsai E.Y. Jain J. Pesavento P.A. Rao A. Goldfeld A . E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to our data for monocytes, these investigators reported that the κB3 site bound NFATp and not p50/p65 (28McCaffrey P.G. Goldfeld A.E. Rao A J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30445-30450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, contrary to our findings in monocytes, no constitutive or induced CREB protein binding to the CRE site was observed in T cells (4Tsai E.Y. Jain J. Pesavento P.A. Rao A. Goldfeld A . E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Instead, the CRE-binding complex was shown to consist almost exclusively of c-Jun/ATF-2 heterodimers. Furthermore, both the CRE site and adjacent upstream Ets site were essential for both basal promoter activity in T cells and responsiveness to PMA (5Kramer B. Weigmann K. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6577-6583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It appears that the Ets site did not play a significant role in basal TNF-α promoter activity in monocytes, since it was not affected by mutation of the Ets site.2 Together, these results demonstrate the marked difference in the regulation of the TNF-α promoter in human T cells and monocytes. In this study, we showed that LPS induction of a heterologous promoter by region II required both the CRE and κB3 sites, suggesting a functional cooperation between the transcription factors bound to these sites. Similar cooperation has also been demonstrated in the induction of another cytokine gene, IFN-β (29Du W. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 74: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), as well as in the expression of E-selectin (30Whitley M.J. Thanos D. Read M.A. Maniatis T. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6464-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In both cases, ATF-2/Jun proteins were shown to interact with p50/p65 proteins. In addition, p50/p65 has been shown to physically interact with ATF-2 (29Du W. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 74: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), and c-Jun (31Kaszubska W. Hoof van Huijsduijnen R. Ghersa P. DeRaemy-Schenk A.M. Chen B.P.C. Hei T. DeLamarter J.F. Whelan J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7180-7190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These direct associations are considered an important mechanism by which transcriptional factors cooperate to induce gene expression. The novel findings presented here support the notion that concerted participation of proteins bound to the Egr-1, CRE, and κB3 sites mediates the induction of the TNF-α promoter in human monocytic THP-1 cells in response to LPS. Future studies will determine if similar regulatory pathways control TNF-α gene expression in monocytes and macrophages. Further elucidation of the cooperative interactions of transcription factors bound to these cis-acting regulatory elements are essential to our understanding of the transcriptional regulation of the TNF-α gene in human monocytes. Understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which these nuclear factors regulate TNF-α gene expression should lead to design of specific inhibitors that will counteract the pathological effects of TNF-α in various diseases.

Recent evidence indicates that, as in endothelial cells, eNOS in cardiac myocytes is localized to plasmalemma caveolae, specialized lipid microdomains that contain caveolin-3, a muscle-specific isoform of the scaffolding protein caveolin. In this report, using a detergent-free method for isolation of sarcolemmal caveolae from primary cultures of adult rat ventricular myocytes, we demonstrated that the muscarinic cholinergic agonist carbachol promotes the translocation of mAchR into low density gradient fractions containing most myocyte caveolin-3 and eNOS. Following isopycnic centrifugation, the different gradient fractions were exposed to the muscarinic radioligand [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB), and binding was determined after membrane filtration or immunoprecipitation. In a direct radioligand binding assay, we found that [3H]QNB binding can be detected in caveolin-enriched fractions only when cardiac myocytes have been previously exposed to carbachol. Furthermore, most of this [3H]QNB binding can be specifically immunoprecipitated by an antibody to the m2 mAchR, indicating that the translocation of this receptor subtype is responsible for the [3H]QNB binding detected in the low density fractions. Moreover, the [3H]QNB binding could be quantitatively immunoprecipitated from the light membrane fractions with a caveolin-3 antibody (but not a control IgG1 antibody), confirming that the m2 mAchR is targeted to caveolae after carbachol treatment. Importantly, atropine, a muscarinic cholinergic antagonist, did not induce translocation of m2 mAchR to caveolae and prevented receptor translocation in response to the agonist carbachol. Thus, dynamic targeting of sarcolemmal m2 mAchR to caveolae following agonist binding may be essential to initiate specific downstream signaling cascades in these cells.

Ther. 1988; 247: 911-917PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that, of the five mAchR subtypes identified to date, only the m1 and m2 subtypes are expressed in adult mammalian cardiac tissues (3Gallo M.P. Alloatti G. Eva C. Oberto A. Levi R.C. J. Physiol. 1993; 471: 41-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 4Sharma V.K. Colecraft H.M. Wang D.X. Levey A.I. Grigorenko E.V. Yeh H.H. Sheu S.-S. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). According to these reports, the m2 mAchR, which is expressed at a much higher level than the m1 mAchR, triggers the inhibitory response while m1 receptor activation elicits, when stimulated by higher concentrations of agonist, a compensatory excitatory effect on heart function. Therefore, distinct downstream signaling cascades must be involved following m1 and m2 mAchR activation. Both m1 and m2 receptor subtypes also have been reported to undergo translocation into specific subcompartments derived from the plasma membrane (5Harden T.K. Petch L.A. Traynelis S.F. Waldo G.L. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17335-17342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), a characteristic of many G protein-coupled receptors (GPR) following agonist binding. To date, two major pathways for GPR clustering and sequestration have been reported, which involve plasma membrane modifications that lead to the formation of either clathrin-coated or non-coated vesicles (11Sandvig K. van Deurs B. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 275-277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). While the human muscarinic cholinergic receptor Hm1 has been shown to internalize via clathrin-coated vesicles (10Tolbert L.M. Lameh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17335-17342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), mAchR have also been shown to be internalized through non-clathrin-coated vesicles in human fibroblasts, although the identity of these vesicular structures has not been defined (6Raposo G. Dunia I. Marullo S. André Guillet J.-G. Strosberg A.D. Benedetti E.L. Hoebeke J. Biol. Cell. 1987; 60: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Recently, a clathrin-independent sequestration pathway has received attention with the characterization of a population of plasmalemmal vesicles termed caveolae. Caveolae are small flask-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane characterized by high levels of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids (12Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar), the principal scaffolding protein of which are the caveolins, 20–24 kDa integral membrane proteins that undergo homo-oligomerization (13Monier S. Parton R.G. Vogel F. Behlke J. Henske A. Kurzchalia T.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 911-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). These specialized lipid microdomains have been shown to play a role in the compartmentation of a number of plasma membrane-linked signal transduction pathways, including those mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases (14Liu P. Ying Y. Ko Y.-G. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10299-10303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 15Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent report by Parton et al. (16Parton R.G. Way M. Zorzi N. Stang E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 137-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) provides additional evidence that coalescence and fission of caveolae may be essential for the development of the T-tubular system that is essential for normal intracellular calcium homeostasis and excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac and skeletal muscle. The specific mechanisms involved in receptor sequestration may differ among distinct cellular phenotypes. For example, several reports have proposed the involvement of clathrin-coated pits in the mechanism of internalization of β-adrenergic receptors (β-AR) (17Muntz K.H. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 356Google Scholar), and yet a recent report indicated that in epidermoid A431 cells, β-AR are clustered within caveolae in response to agonist stimulation (18Dupree P. Parton R.G. Raposo G. Kurzhalia T.V. Simons K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1597-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The recent development of antibodies directed against different tissue-specific isoforms of caveolin has permitted a better characterization of caveolar microdomains. Using these antibodies in immunoprecipitation experiments, we have recently shown that eNOS, the constitutively expressed isoform of nitric-oxide synthase in cardiac myocytes, is targeted to sarcolemmal caveolae in cardiac myocytes and endothelial cells (19Feron O. Belhassen L. Kobzik L. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22810-22814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Interestingly, reports from our laboratory and by others have shown that the generation of nitric oxide (NO) is an obligate intermediate step in the signal transduction cascade involved in the m2 mAchR-mediated inhibitory responses of the heart, particularly following β-adrenergic stimulation (20Balligand J.-L.

Res. 1996; 78: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Caveolae may, therefore, constitute the structural framework within which this signaling cascade operates. Thus, the dynamic targeting of agonist-stimulated muscarinic cholinergic receptors to caveolae in cardiac myocytes could facilitate the activation of eNOS, which we have shown to be quantitatively and specifically associated with caveolin-3, the muscle-specific isoform of caveolin (19Feron O. Belhassen L. Kobzik L. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22810-22814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 24Way M. Parton R.G.

The co-localization in caveolae of this Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent NOS isoform with proteins known to regulate Ca2+ homeostasis, including a Ca2+-ATPase and InsP3 receptor-like proteins (27Fujimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), as well as with heterotrimeric G proteins (12Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J.

In this report, we describe experiments designed to explore the hypothesis that m2 mAchR are targeted to plasmalemmal caveolae upon agonist stimulation in adult rat ventricular myocytes. Using a detergent-free method for caveolae isolation followed by isopycnic centrifugation, we provide evidence that the m2 mAchR, after agonist stimulation, co-purifies with caveolin-3 and eNOS. Furthermore, we show that the radioliganded m2 mAchR can be specifically immunoprecipitated from these caveolin-enriched fractions using antibodies directed against caveolin-3. Purified adult rat ventricular myocyte (ARVM) primary cultures were plated on laminin and cultured for 24 h in a defined medium as reported previously (19Feron O. Belhassen L. Kobzik L. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22810-22814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). ARVM were incubated either with or without carbachol (100 μm, 15 min), lysed, and fractionated on sucrose gradients; in some experiments (see “Results and Discussion”), myocytes were preincubated in the presence of 1 μm atropine (15 min) or 5 mm acetic acid (5 min) before carbachol treatment. Before harvesting, cells were washed extensively with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline to ensure complete removal of drugs. This was validated by the lack of any detectable difference in specific [3H]quinuclidinyl benzylate (QNB) binding levels (see below) in total lysates of ARVM, whether treated or not with a muscarinic agonist or antagonist. ARVM were scraped in a freshly prepared solution of 200 mmNa2CO3 and lysed by sonication (three 5-s bursts, minimal output power) using a Branson sonifier 450 (Branson Ultrasonic Corp., Danbury, CT), according to a method modified from Song et al. (26Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). The cell lysate was then adjusted to 45% sucrose by addition of a sucrose stock solution prepared in MBS (25 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl) and placed at the bottom of a 5–15-25–35% discontinuous sucrose gradient (in MBS containing 100 mm Na2CO3) for an overnight ultracentrifugation (150,000 g). The gradient was fractionated in nine fractions corresponding to sucrose concentrations 5, 15, 25, 35, and 45%, and the four intermediate interfaces. Each fraction was neutralized with HCl before further analysis. Heat-denatured proteins were loaded and separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Mini Protean II, Bio-Rad) and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad). After blocking with 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST), membranes were incubated with the specified primary antibody (Transduction Labs) for 1 h in TBST containing 1% non-fat dry milk. After six washes (10 min each), the membranes were incubated for 1 h with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs) at a 1:10,000 dilution in TBST containing 1% non-fat dry milk. After five additional washes, the membranes were rinsed once in TBST, incubated with a chemiluminescent reagent according to the manufacturer protocols (Renaissance, NEN Life Science Products), and exposed to x-ray film. Mannosidase II activity was determined by hydrolysis ofp-nitrophenyl-α-d-mannopyranoside (Sigma) with volumes reduced to facilitate the assay in 96-well plates, as described previously (29Denker S.P. McCaffery J.M. Palade G.E. Insel P.A. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1027-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h followed by quenching with 100 mm NaOH, absorbance was measured at 405 nm using a Microplate Reader (SLT Lab Instruments). [3H]ouabain (NEN Life Science Products) binding was determined as described (30Feron O. Wibo M. Christen M.-O. Godfraind T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 105: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar); nonspecific binding was estimated in the presence of 1 mm ouabain (Sigma). Membranes were collected on Whatman GF/B fiber filters, washed twice with chilled Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and the radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter. Protein amounts, mannosidase activity and [3H]ouabain binding are expressed as percent of total protein, of total activity, and of total specific [3H]ouabain binding, respectively. The gradient fractions (buffered at pH 7.4) were adjusted to 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and aliquots of the different fractions were incubated with 2 nm [3H]QNB (NEN Life Science Products) at 30 °C for 60 min; nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm atropine. Assays were performed in triplicate and terminated by rapid filtration on Whatman GF/B filters or followed by an immunoprecipitation protocol (adapted from those in Refs. 31Luthin G.R. Harkness J.

For these immunoprecipitation experiments, the binding buffer also contained 1% digitonin and 0.2% CHAPS; nonspecific [3H]QNB binding was determined by performing all the steps of the immunoprecipitation protocol in the presence of 1 μm atropine. After sequential incubations of the [3H]QNB-bound receptors with an antibody directed against the m2 mAchR (4 h, 4 °C, Chemicon) and agarose-conjugated protein-G (1–2 h, 4 °C), immunocomplexes were precipitated by centrifugation, washed four times with 25 mm Mes buffer containing 1% digitonin and 0.2% CHAPS, and resuspended in 1% SDS. A similar protocol was used for the immunoprecipitation with the caveolin-3 antibody (Transduction Labs) except that binding and washing buffers did not contain digitonin.

Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3218-3226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) antibodies have been established previously. Moreover, the specificity of the caveolin-3 immunoprecipitation was established by comparing the [3H]QNB binding detected from immunoprecipitates performed using a non-immune idiotype-specific purified mouse myeloma IgG1 (Zymed). In all the experiments described here above, samples were transferred in counting vials containing 10 ml of scintillant, and the radioactivity was determined in a liquid scintillation counter. Caveolin-enriched membranes have been historically isolated on the basis of their insolubility in Triton due to their specialized lipid composition (12Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 33Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). However, it has been reported recently that the inclusion of detergent can result in the loss of proteins normally associated with caveolae (26Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M.

Hartmann E. Dupree P. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 187-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, for isolating caveolae from cardiac myocytes, we have optimized a detergent-free purification method based on the resistance to extraction of caveolin complexes by sodium carbonate and on the fine disruption of cellular membrane by sonication (18Dupree P. Parton R.G. Raposo G. Kurzhalia T.V. Simons K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1597-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 26Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Thus, after homogenization of ARVM in a sodium carbonate buffer, the lysate was adjusted to 45% sucrose and placed at the bottom of a 5–15-25–35% discontinuous gradient for an overnight ultracentrifugation. Aliquots of the different fractions collected were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PVDF membranes, and immunoblotted with anti-caveolin-3 or anti-eNOS antibodies. The immunoblots presented in Fig. 1 A show that the majority of caveolin-3 and eNOS in ventricular myocytes appears in fractions 2 and 3, which correspond to the 5–15% sucrose equilibrium densities. This co-purification of eNOS and caveolin-3 is in agreement with our previous data on the co-immunoprecipitation of these two proteins from CHAPS-solubilized cardiac myocyte lysates (19Feron O. Belhassen L. Kobzik L. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22810-22814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) and on the co-isolation of eNOS and caveolin-1 in endothelial cells (36Shaul P.W. Smart E.J. Robinson L.J. German Z. Yuhanna I.S. Ying Y. Anderson R.G.W. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6518-6522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The gradient fractions were also analyzed for their protein content as well as for the presence of mannosidase II, as a Golgi marker (29Denker S.P. McCaffery J.M. Palade G.E. Insel P.A. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1027-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and for the level of specific [3H]oubain binding (30Feron O. Wibo M. Christen M.-O. Godfraind T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 105: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), as a specific marker of (Na+, K+)-ATPase, a relatively evenly distributed enzyme at the sarcolemmal surface of cardiac myocytes. As shown by the pattern of distribution of these markers across the gradient (Fig. 1 B), the bulk of cellular protein that equilibrates at the high sucrose density (fractions 7–9), corresponds to Golgi and sarcolemmal membranes. The small amount of caveolin-3 and eNOS associated with these high density fractions (Fig.1 A) is probably due to some association of both proteins with the trans-Golgi network (37Belhassen L. Feron O. Kaye D.M. Michel T. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11198-11204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or to incomplete cell lysis prior to sucrose density gradient centrifugation. We next explored the effects of carbachol, a muscarinic cholinergic agonist, on the distribution of mAchR using the centrifugation protocol described above, to determine if a change in receptor subcellular localization was induced by agonist binding. The following experiments were performed on primary cultures of ARVM exposed to 100 μm carbachol for 15 min. After extensive washing, myocytes were lysed and submitted to isopycnic centrifugation on a sucrose gradient. Aliquots of the different fractions obtained were incubated with [3H]QNB, a muscarinic antagonist radioligand, at 30 °C for 60 min. In a first set of experiments, membranes were directly filtered on Whatman GF/B glass filters. As shown in Fig. 2 A, in lysates prepared from untreated myocytes, the binding of [3H]QNB is only detected in the high-density fractions. In contrast, following carbachol treatment, 27.4 ± 3.3% of the [3H]QNB binding (n = 6) can be recovered in the low-density fractions 2 and 3, which correspond to the caveolin-enriched membranes (Fig. 1 A). The rest of the [3H]QNB binding remains concentrated in fractions 7–9 and likely represents binding to non-caveolar sarcolemmal muscarinic receptors.Figure 2Agonist-induced translocation of muscarinic receptors in cardiac myocytes. The presence of muscarinic receptors in each fraction is determined by the amount of specific [3H]QNB binding detected by harvesting membranes on Whatman glass filters (A) or by immunoprecipitation with anti-m2 antibodies (B, C); control and carbachol (100 μm, 15 min) conditions are symbolized by open (○) and closed (•, ▴, ▪) symbols, respectively. In panel C, the incubation in presence of carbachol (100 μm, 15 min) was preceded by a 15-min incubation with atropine 1 μm(▴) or a 5-min incubation with 5 mm acetic acid, pH 5.0 (▪). For each condition, nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm atropine. The data are expressed as the percent of total specific [3H]QNB binding and are representative of those obtained in three to six experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In a second series of experiments, we used a complementary approach to explore the carbachol-induced shift in [3H]QNB binding. The different fractions collected after isopycnic centrifugation were immunoprecipitated using an m2 mAchR antibody, and the amount of specific [3H]QNB binding in each immunoprecipitate was determined. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the pattern of distribution of m2 mAchR is similar to that directly deduced from the [3H]QNB binding to each fraction (Fig.2 A) with, however, a more accentuated shift of [3H]QNB bound m2 mAchR toward the low density fractions when myocytes have been exposed to carbachol. 34.6 ± 3.9% (n = 6) of the [3H]QNB binding is now detected in the caveolar fractions 2 and 3. Importantly, when ARVM are preincubated with 1 μm atropine before carbachol treatment (Fig. 2 C), the enrichment of the m2 mAchR in fractions 2 and 3 is no longer observed, thereby indicating the specificity of the agonist-mediated clustering process. Interestingly, in a previous study, Raposo et al. (6Raposo G. Dunia I. Marullo S. André Guillet J.-G. Strosberg A.D. Benedetti E.L. Hoebeke J. Biol. Cell. 1987; 60: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) reported that treatment of human fibroblasts, either with a muscarinic cholinergic agonist or with the muscarinic cholinergic antagonist atropine, triggered the redistribution of the Hm1 mAchR into specific regions of the plasma membrane, presumably caveolae, and that only longer exposures with the agonist lead to the receptor endocytosis. Furthermore, Tolbert and Lameh (10Tolbert L.M. Lameh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17335-17342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) showed, using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, that the Hm1 mAchR, after agonist stimulation, are internalized via clathrin-coated vesicles in HEK cells stably transfected with the epitope-tagged Hm1 receptors. Together with the data reported here, these results suggest that the extent and the mode of receptor compartmentation in response to agonist stimulation may be governed by both the receptor subtype and the cell type in which it is expressed. In our experimental conditions, it is unlikely that clustering of the m2 mAchR into coated pits can explain the shift in mAchR into lower density sucrose gradients. Indeed, evidence from the literature indicates that the equilibrium density of clathrin-coated pits is higher than that of caveolae (38Woodward M.P. Roth T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and therefore would not match the pattern of distribution of carbachol-stimulated muscarinic receptors obtained in Fig. 2, A and B. Furthermore, when myocytes are pre-incubated with 5 mm acetic acid, pH 5.0, a treatment known to disrupt clathrin-mediated endocytosis (39Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Petersen O.W. Deurs B.V. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), a movement of m2 mAchR into caveolin-enriched fractions is still detected (Fig. 2 C). To confirm the dynamic targeting of muscarinic receptors to caveolae in cardiac myocytes, we used a caveolin-3 antibody to immunoprecipitate caveolar membranes and identify the m2 mAchR by radioligand binding assays. In these studies, cardiac myocytes preincubated either with or without carbachol were lysed and fractionated on sucrose gradients, and the fractions corresponding to caveolae were pooled and incubated with [3H]QNB. After subsequent incubation with either an anti-caveolin-3 antibody or a nonspecific IgG1 antibody and agarose-conjugated protein-G, immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation, and radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter. As summarized in Fig. 3, in the absence of carbachol treatment, there was no significant immunoprecipitation of [3H]QNB binding by caveolin-3 antibodies since the level of [3H]QNB binding was similar to that obtained when using the nonspecific IgG1 for the immunoprecipitation. In contrast, following agonist treatment, a substantial fraction of specific [3H]QNB binding can be immunoprecipitated by anti-caveolin-3 antibodies (Fig. 3); no change in caveolin-3 expression was observed after carbachol treatment (not shown). In fact, 73 ± 5% (n = 3) of the [3H]QNB binding originally present in pooled fractions 2 and 3 (determined by direct filtration on Whatman GF/B glass filters) could be recovered after anti-caveolin-3 immunoprecipitation. Similar experiments (not shown) performed on fractions 7–9, which correspond to the bulk of plasma membrane (80–95% of total protein when pooled together), did not reveal any specific [3H]QNB binding in the caveolin-3 immunoprecipitate, in agreement with the low abundance of caveolin-3 in these fractions (see Fig. 1 A). Importantly, in myocytes incubated with carbachol in the presence of the muscarinic antagonist atropine, the [3H]QNB binding immunoprecipitated by anti-caveolin-3 antibodies remained at the level detected in a control immunoprecipitation performed with a nonspecific IgG1. This is in agreement with the data shown in Fig. 2 C in which no significant binding was detected in the anti-m2 mAchR immunoprecipitates from caveolar fractions of myocytes incubated with carbachol in the presence of atropine. Taken together, these data establish that the m2 mAchR redistributes to plasmalemmal caveolae of cardiac myocytes following agonist binding. The dynamic targeting of the m2 mAchR to caveolae has important implications for muscarinic receptor biology as well as for the regulation of eNOS activation. Although several laboratories have reported evidence for the translocation to low density gradient fractions of the muscarinic receptors upon agonist stimulation (5Harden T.K. Petch L.A. Traynelis S.F. Waldo G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13060-13066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Raposo G. Dunia I. Marullo S. André Guillet J.-G. Strosberg A.D. Benedetti E.L.

Signalling. 1991; 3: 587-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), there are, to our knowledge, no data in the literature that address the specific nature of these “light membranes.” The co-purification and co-immunoprecipitation (this study, and also see Refs. 19Feron O.

Together with immunoelectron microscopy data showing that, in A431 cells, β-AR are sequestrated within caveolae in response to agonist stimulation (18Dupree P. Parton R.G. Raposo G. Kurzhalia T.V. Simons K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1597-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), our data indicate that clathrin-coated pit formation can no longer be considered as the exclusive pathway for clustering G protein-coupled receptors within specialized plasmalemmal microdomains. The fate of caveolar β-AR and mAchR is uncertain, since it is not clear whether caveolae pinch off from the plasma membrane and lead to early endosomes. If this is the case, it suggests that dual pathways of receptor internalization may exist in some cells. While numerous studies present the sequestration of G protein-coupled receptors after agonist stimulation as a key event for initiating a process of desensitization (for review, see Ref. 40Eva C. Gamalero S.R. Genazzani E. Costa E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therap. 1990; 253: 257-265PubMed Google Scholar), the data in this manuscript support the hypothesis that, following stimulation by agonist, cardiac m2 mAchR translocation to caveolae may be necessary to initiate specific downstream signaling cascades. Interestingly, several recent studies have shown that internalization of the m2 and m4 mAchR is mediated by mechanisms distinct from the phosphorylation by the G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) family known to lead to receptor desensitization (41Pals-Rylaarsdam R.

Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 424-429PubMed Google Scholar). The translocation of muscarinic receptors within caveolae should allow their interaction with the heterotrimeric G protein complexes known to be concentrated within these plasmalemmal microdomains (12Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 26Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Analysis of caveolin-enriched fractions to identify additional signaling molecules involved in the muscarinic cholinergic stimulation of the NO pathway in cardiac myocytes is ongoing in our laboratory. The caveolar compartmentation described here for the muscarinic cholinergic pathway may serve as a paradigm for other G protein receptor-mediated signaling cascades that are targeted to caveolae."

https://openalex.org/W2158709030,"In this report, we show that the vasoactive peptide agonist bradykinin (BK) when bound to B2 BK receptors on DDT1 MF-2 smooth muscle cells promotes the recruitment and sequestration of the occupied receptors and the receptor-coupled G-protein α subunits Gαq and Gαi in caveolae. Association of ligand receptor complexes and Gα subunits with caveolae was indicated by their co-enrichment on density gradients with caveolin, a marker protein for caveolae. Caveolin and Gα subunits were monitored by immunoblotting, whereas receptors were monitored as ligand receptor complexes formed by labeling receptors with the agonist BK or the antagonist NPC17731 prior to cell disruption and caveolae enrichment. These complexes were detected with radioligand and by immunoblotting with BK antibodies. A direct interaction of Gα subunits with caveolin was also indicated by their co-immunoprecipitation. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that the enriched caveolin, Gα subunits, and BK receptor complexes were present in structures of 0.1–0.2 μm. At 4 °C, BK and NPC17731 receptor complexes were detected in caveolae, and both complexes were sensitive to acid washing prior to cell disruption and caveolae enrichment. Elevation of the temperature to 37 °C increased the amount of BK receptor complexes in caveolae with a maximal response at 10 min (continuous labeling) or 20 min (single-round labeling), and the complexes became acid-resistant. These conditions also increased the amount of Gαq and Gαi in caveolae with a maximal response at 5–10 min. In contrast, the NPC17731 receptor complexes remained acid-sensitive and dissociated at this temperature, and antagonists did not increase the amount of Gα subunits in caveolae. These results show that some agonists that act through G-protein-coupled receptors promote the association of their receptors and receptor-coupled Gα subunits with caveolae.

Caveolae, or plasmalemma vesicles, are attracting a considerable amount of attention as specialized structures involved in signal transduction (1Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Sargiacomo M.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1507-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The significance of the association of each of these proteins with caveolae is not clear. One theory is that caveolae serve as compartments for recruitment of components in a signaling pathway to increase efficient and rapid coupling of receptors to more than one effector system (1Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Sargiacomo M. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 231-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). An alternative theory is that caveolae attract signaling components to terminate the receptor signal. Many signaling proteins are acylated (31Milligan G. Parenti M. Magee A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 181-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and acylation may direct at least some of these proteins to caveolae (24Garcia-Cardena G. Oh P. Liu J.

However, little information is still available about the regulation of this post-translational modification and its importance for caveolae association. Considering that at least some receptors and G-proteins can associate with caveolae, it is reasonable to suggest that agonists that act through such receptors and G-proteins can regulate their association with caveolae. BK is a potent vasoactive peptide that acts through B2 BK receptors (33Regoli D. Barabe J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1980; 32: 1-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This receptor belongs to the seven transmembrane domain, G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily (34McEachern A.E. Shelton E.R. Bhakta S. Obernolte R. Bach C. Zuppan P. Fujisaki J. Aldrich R.W.

In this study, we investigated the effect of B2 receptor agonists and antagonists on the association of B2 receptors, Gαq, and Gαi with caveolae in DDT1 MF-2 smooth muscle cells. This cell line was chosen since muscle is a rich source of caveolae (19Chang W. Ying Y. Rothberg K.G. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Gambliel H.A. De Gunzburg J. Mumby S.M. Gilman A.G. Anderson R.G.W. J.

[2,3-prolyl-3,4-3H]Bradykinin (110 Ci/mmol) and [prolyl-3,4-3H]NPC17731 (53.5 Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products, andmyo-[3H]inositol (17 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Corp. Monoclonal antibodies against caveolin were purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA) and Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The former antibodies recognize both the 22- and 24-kDa isoforms of caveolin in DDT1 MF-2 smooth muscle cells, whereas the latter antibodies recognize only the 24-kDa isoform. Polyclonal antibodies Z811-7 against Gαq/11 and WO82–8 against Gαq were generous gifts of Dr. Paul Sternweis (University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, Dallas). Polyclonal antibodies against Gαi were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), and polyclonal antibodies against BK were from Peninsula (Belmont, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-linked sheep anti-mouse IgG and donkey anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Amersham Corp. Biotinylated secondary antibodies were from Vector Laboratories, Inc. (Burlingame, CA). Streptavidin-Gold (10 nm) and protein A-Sepharose were from Sigma. Percoll was obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Optiprep was from Life Technologies, Inc. Protogold was purchased from British BioCell International (Phillipsburg, NJ). Immunodetection systems were obtained from Amersham Corp. and NEN Life Science Products. All other biochemicals were of the highest grade available. DDT1 MF-2 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. At 15 min before addition of agonist/antagonist, confluent cells were incubated in Leibovitz L-15 media containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at 37 °C. Two procedures were used for enrichment of caveolae. One procedure followed that of Sargiacomoet al. (18Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar) with a few modifications (Method I). After treatment with agonist/antagonist, the cells were immediately transferred onto ice and washed with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS. All manipulations were then done at 4 °C. Cells were collected in PBS by scraping with a rubber policeman and washed twice in PBS by centrifugation at 250 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was then Dounce homogenized (70 strokes) in 2 ml of 1% Triton X-100 in buffer A (25 mm MES, pH 6.7, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The homogenate was transferred to a 12-ml polyallomer centrifugation tube (Seton), which had been pretreated with chromic acid (46Wallace H. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 32: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and mixed with 3 ml of 60% sucrose in buffer A. A linear gradient of 5–30% sucrose in buffer A without Triton X-100 was layered on top of the homogenate. The gradient was centrifuged in an SW41Ti rotor at 160,000 × g for 18–22 h. The opaque band at 10–15% sucrose was collected, diluted 1:2 (v/v) in buffer A, and pelleted by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 13,000 × g for 30 min. The second procedure followed that of Smart et al. (20Smart E. Ying Y. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) with a few modifications (Method II). After treatment with agonist/antagonist, the cells were immediately transferred onto ice and washed with 10 ml of ice-cold buffer B (20 mm Tricine, pH 6.8, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm EDTA). Again, all manipulations were then done at 4 °C. Cells were collected in buffer B by scraping with a rubber policeman and washed once in the same buffer by centrifugation at 250 × g for 5 min. The cells were homogenized in a glass/Teflon homogenizer (30 strokes) in 2 ml of buffer B. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 10 min in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was collected and the pellet homogenized and centrifuged again as described above. The two supernatants were combined and placed on top of 23 ml of 30% Percoll in buffer B and centrifuged in a 60Ti rotor at 81,000 × g for 30 min. The opaque band at ∼5 cm from the bottom of the tube was collected in a 12-ml polyallomer tube, and the volume was adjusted with buffer B to a total of 2 ml. The sample was sonicated by six 10-s bursts with ∼2 min between each burst. To this sample was then added 0.16 ml of buffer B and 1.84 ml of 50% Optiprep in buffer C (120 mm Tricine, pH 6.8, 250 mm sucrose, 25 mm EDTA), and on top was layered a 7-ml linear gradient of 10–20% Optiprep in buffer B. The gradient was centrifuged in an SW41Ti rotor at 58,000 × g for 90 min. The top 5 ml of the gradient was collected and mixed with 4 ml of 50% Optiprep in buffer C in a 12-ml polyallomer tube. On top of the sample was added 2 ml of 5% Optiprep in buffer B, and the gradient was centrifuged in the SW41Ti rotor at 58,000 × g for 90 min. The opaque band just above the interface was then collected and diluted 1:2 (v/v) with buffer B and pelleted by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 13,000 × g for 30 min. The opaque band from the gradient in Method I or II under “Enrichment of Caveolae” was collected, diluted 1:2 in ice-cold PBS, and pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min in a microcentrifuge. The pellet was fixed in 4% formaldehyde, 1% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 mphosphate buffer, pH 7.0, for 2 h and then embedded in LR Gold (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA). Sections were picked up on Formvar, carbon-coated nickel grids. A three-stage immunolabeling procedure was then used. The grids were first incubated in sequence with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 5 min, 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 4% BSA for 10 min, and 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.02 m glycine for 15 min. This was followed by incubation in sequence with primary antibody or irrelevant antibody for 15 min, 0.1 mg/ml either biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG or biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG for 15 min, and a 1:10 dilution of Streptavidin-Gold (10 nm) for 30 min. Each incubation was followed by six 1-min washes with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1% BSA. Next, the grids were washed six times with 0.1 mphosphate buffer, pH 7.5, for 1 min each, post-fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, for 20 min, and then washed six times with H2O for 1 min each. The grids were then dried and stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Cells were lysed by Dounce homogenization in buffer A as described above in Method I under “Enrichment of Caveolae.” The lysate was then centrifuged at 250 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and used for immunoprecipitation at 4 °C as described previously (47Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Song X.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8151-8157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In short, lysates were incubated with anti-caveolin, anti-Gαq (1:2,000), or anti-Gαi antibodies (1:2,000) overnight at 4 °C. In the case of caveolin immunoprecipitation, antibodies from ICN (1:2,000) and Transduction Laboratories (1:1,000) were combined. The lysates were then incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. In the case of anti-caveolin, the protein A-Sepharose beads had been precoupled to rabbit anti-mouse IgG. After incubation, the beads were washed twice with buffer A containing 3% BSA and once with 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4. Samples were heated in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer containing 6% β-mercaptoethanol for 5 min at 100 °C. Following electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gels, the fractionated proteins were electroblotted onto 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) at ∼500 mA for 45 min at 4 °C using a Genie electroblotter (Idea Scientific) as described by Towbin et al. (48Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked by incubation in 10% defatted milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 h. The membranes were then washed by a brief rinse in TBS followed by three separate 10-min washes in TBS. The membranes were then incubated with anti-caveolin (1:1,000), anti-Gαq (1:2,500), or anti-Gαi (1:2,500) antibodies at 24 °C overnight. This was followed by a rinse in TBS as described above. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with immunodetection kits using peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse antibodies according to procedures described by the suppliers (Amersham Corp. and NEN Life Science Products). All blots were sequentially stained with antibodies against all the proteins. Stripping of blots between antibody staining was done by washing in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol for 45 min at 50 °C. The blots were then washed 3 × for 30 min in TBS. Residual immunoreactivity was checked with immunodetection kits in the absence of primary antibody. Some of the blots were stained with Protogold prior to immunoblotting. After transfer of the proteins, the nitrocellulose was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in TBS containing 2% Nonidet P-40 and then washed 3 × for 5 min with TBS and 2 × for 1 min with H2O. Protogold (1.5 ml) was then added to the nitrocellulose and agitation continued for 30 min. For subsequent immunoblotting, the blot was washed 2 × for 20 min with TBS. Cells were incubated with various concentrations of [3H]BK and [3H]NPC17731 in Leibovitz L-15 media containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% BSA, and the protease inhibitors teprotide (1 μm), bacitracin (140 μg/ml), and 1,10-phenanthroline (1 mm). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm BK or 1 μm HOE140. Two protocols were used to form and follow radioligand receptor complexes. In one protocol, termed “continuous labeling,” cells were exposed continuously to radioligands for various times at 37 °C. Following rinsing of the cells with 2 × 3 ml of ice-cold PBS, 0.3% BSA to remove free radioligand, caveolae were enriched by Method II (see above under “Enrichment of Caveolae”). In a second protocol, termed “single-round labeling,” cells were first exposed to radioligands for 90 min at 4 °C. Following rinsing of the cells, caveolae were then enriched by Method II either immediately or following further incubation of the cells for various times at 37 °C. In both protocols, the caveolae fraction was counted for radioactivity in a Beckman LS5000TD scintillation counter. In some cases, cell disruption was preceded by a wash in low pH buffer (50 mm glycine, pH 3.0). As originally described by Haigler et al. (49Haigler H.T. Mayfield F.R. Willingham M.C. Pastan I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1239-1241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Ascoli (50Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13306-13311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and subsequently by us for specific [3H]BK binding (43Munoz C.M. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1992; 301: 336-344Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), radioactivity associated with the cells following such a wash is considered intracellular and inaccessible to the extracellular environment. Cells were assayed essentially as described (51Tropea M.M. Munoz C.M. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1992; 70: 1360-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cells were incubated with 2 μCi/mlmyo-[3H]inositol in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C for 48 h in 5% CO2. The cells were then incubated for an additional 24 h in DMEM, 0.5% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then washed four times with 1 ml of DMEM and incubated in DMEM, 50 mm LiCl for 30 min. Following replacement with 2 ml of the same medium, the cells were incubated with 1 μm BK for various times at 37 °C. Inositol phosphates were then extracted and isolated using anion exchange chromatography. Autoradiograms were subjected to densitometry using a computer-coupled video system, and the data were analyzed by the NIH Imager program (version 1.55). Multiple methods were used to evaluate the association of Gα subunits with caveolae in naive DDT1 MF-2 smooth muscle cells. In all methods, caveolae were monitored by immunoblotting with antibodies for the 22- and 24-kDa isoforms of caveolin, an integral protein component of caveolae (7Glenney J.R. Soppet D. Proc. Natl.

On one type of gradient (Method I), enrichment of caveolae depends on both their buoyant density and resistance to 1% Triton X-100 as described by Sargiacomo et al. (18Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar), and on another type of gradient (Method II), enrichment depends exclusively on their unique buoyant density as described by Smart et al.

https://openalex.org/W1999553050,"Vesicular transport between secretory compartments requires specific recognition molecules called SNAREs. Here we report the identification of three putative SNAREs, p14 (Sft1p), p28 (Gos1p), and a detailed characterization of p26 (Ykt6p). All three were originally isolated as interacting partners of the cis Golgi target membrane-associated SNARE Sed5p, when Sec18p (yeast NSF) was inactivated. YKT6 is an essential gene that codes for a novel vesicle-associated SNARE functioning at the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi transport step in the yeast secretory pathway. Depletion of Ykt6p results in the accumulation of the p1 precursor (endoplasmic reticulum form) of the vacuolar enzyme carboxypeptidase Y and morphological abnormalities consistent with a defect in secretion. Membrane localization of Ykt6p is essential for protein function and is normally mediated by isoprenylation. However, replacement of the isoprenylation motif with a bona fide transmembrane anchor results in a functional protein confirming that membrane localization, but not isoprenylation per se, is required for function. Ykt6p and its homologues are highly conserved from yeast to human as demonstrated by the functional complementation of the loss of Ykt6p by its human counterpart. This is the first example of a human SNARE protein functionally replacing a yeast SNARE. This observation implies that the specific details of the vesicle targeting code, like the genetic code, are conserved in evolution. Vesicular transport between secretory compartments requires specific recognition molecules called SNAREs. Here we report the identification of three putative SNAREs, p14 (Sft1p), p28 (Gos1p), and a detailed characterization of p26 (Ykt6p). All three were originally isolated as interacting partners of the cis Golgi target membrane-associated SNARE Sed5p, when Sec18p (yeast NSF) was inactivated. YKT6 is an essential gene that codes for a novel vesicle-associated SNARE functioning at the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi transport step in the yeast secretory pathway. Depletion of Ykt6p results in the accumulation of the p1 precursor (endoplasmic reticulum form) of the vacuolar enzyme carboxypeptidase Y and morphological abnormalities consistent with a defect in secretion. Membrane localization of Ykt6p is essential for protein function and is normally mediated by isoprenylation. However, replacement of the isoprenylation motif with a bona fide transmembrane anchor results in a functional protein confirming that membrane localization, but not isoprenylation per se, is required for function. Ykt6p and its homologues are highly conserved from yeast to human as demonstrated by the functional complementation of the loss of Ykt6p by its human counterpart. This is the first example of a human SNARE protein functionally replacing a yeast SNARE. This observation implies that the specific details of the vesicle targeting code, like the genetic code, are conserved in evolution. The N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) and the soluble NSF attachment proteins (SNAPs) are required for vesicular transport at multiple steps (1Graham T.R. Emr S.D. J.

In contrast, well defined stoichiometric complexes accumulate when fusion is blocked by a temperature-sensitivesec18 mutant in vivo. This method was employed to immunoisolate distinct SNARE complexes containing Sed5p, utilizing an anti Sed5p antibody. These complexes contained Sec17p (yeast α-SNAP), Sly1p (a Sec1p family member), Sed5p, the ER-Golgi v-SNAREs Bos1p, Bet1p, and Sec22p, and three novel proteins, p28, p14, and p26 (36Søgaard M.

This recognition mechanism is provided by cognate v-SNARE and t-SNARE interactions. In this report we characterize a new v-SNARE, Ykt6p, involved in ER-Golgi transport, increasing the number of potential v-SNAREs at this transport step to four: Bet1p, Bos1p, Sec22p, and Ykt6p. Ykt6p has several hallmarks of a SNARE molecule. It was isolated from an assembled v-t-SNARE complex containing Sed5p, many other SNAREs, and Sec17p and shows significant sequence homology to members of the VAMP/synaptobrevin family like Sec22p. Additionally, Ykt6p, present in a detergent extract of total yeast membranes, interacts directly or as a part of a v-t-SNARE complex with recombinant GST-Sec17p (data not shown). A striking feature distinguishing Ykt6p from other SNAREs is the presence of a CAAX box providing a signal for isoprenylation and thereby mediating membrane attachment. In all other known v-SNAREs, hydrophobic peptide sequence function as membrane anchors. In this respect, all of the Ykt6p homologues, ranging from yeast to man, are unique SNARE molecules.A chromosomal deletion of YKT6 is lethal, but it can be rescued by expression of wild type Ykt6p, amino-terminallymyc-tagged Ykt6p, the human Ykt6p homologue, and a Ykt6p chimera, whose isoprenylation signal has been substituted by a proteinaceous membrane anchor. Ykt6p is present at ∼0.05% of total protein, but cells are completely viable at levels at least 10-fold below this under the conditions we tested. This would indicate that wild type yeast can adapt to low Ykt6p levels. However, Ykt6p function is still clearly required for viability, because these cells could not lose the URA3-based plasmid on 5-fluroorotic acid plates after many generation in glucose media.Interestingly, Ykt6p was found in two cellular pools, one in the cytoplasm and another associated with membranes. Triton X-114 phase partitioning would suggest that both the membrane bound and soluble Ykt6p are prenylated, raising the question how the hydrophobic group is masked in the cytosol. Currently, we cannot answer this question, but our data clearly indicate that the membrane-associated pool of the Ykt6p represents the functional form. Mutant Ykt6p, which lacks the isoprenylation signal, cannot recover the YKT6 deletion. In addition, the chimera Ykt6p/Gos1pTM, containing the Gos1p membrane spanning region instead of the isoprenylation signal, was functionally active, and a cytoplasmic pool of this chimera was not detectable. It was not possible to localize the membrane-bound population of Ykt6p by immunofluorescence microscopy to a distinct intracellular membrane, because fluorescence due to the cytosolic pool of Ykt6p resulted in too large of a background signal.Biochemical studies and the presence of Ykt6p in the isolated Sed5p complex indicate that Ykt6p is involved, at the very least, in ER to Golgi transport. These observations suggest a localization within these compartments. Depletion of Ykt6p function stops cell growth and manifests a transport block at the level of the endoplasmic reticulum, as shown by the accumulation of the p1 form of CPY (Fig. 4). Genetic evidence confirms an ER-Golgi function for Ykt6p. Overexpression of Ykt6p suppresses the temperature-sensitive phenotype of two ER-Golgi v-SNAREs, Sec22p (sec22–1 and sec22–3), and Bos1p (sec32–1). Additionally, a temperature-sensitive allele of Uso1p (uso1–1) can be suppressed by all four ER-Golgi SNARE molecules including Ykt6p (38Sapperstein S.K. Lupashin V.V. Schmitt H.D. Waters M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Morphological data obtained from yeast cells containing reduced levels of the human homologue of Ykt6p, which replaces the endogenous Ykt6p, gave a heterogeneous phenotype. The depleted cells accumulate 50 nm transport vesicle and exaggerated ER membrane further supporting a Ykt6p function in ER-Golgi transport. Similarly vesicle and ER accumulation has been observed in Sed5p-depleted yeast (46Hardwick K.G. Pelham H.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). It is not clear if the exaggerated ER is the primary or secondary effect of the transport block. However, it seems likely that vesicles initially accumulate, and when Ykt6p becomes limiting, production of new vesicles is reduced, leading to the ER accumulation. This would be consistent with a mechanism, which couples vesicle generation to v-SNAREs packaging and therefore ensures generation of docking and fusion competent vesicles. It would also be consistent with a selective block in anterograde transport.We cannot exclude that Ykt6p might also act at transport steps other than ER-Golgi because a cytoplasmic pool of Ykt6p could provide an interacting partner for several SNAREs localized to multiple compartment. Further analysis of Ykt6p localization and distribution will help to determine its precise role in vesicle targeting and fusion.

In contrast, well defined stoichiometric complexes accumulate when fusion is blocked by a temperature-sensitivesec18 mutant in vivo. This method was employed to immunoisolate distinct SNARE complexes containing Sed5p, utilizing an anti Sed5p antibody. These complexes contained Sec17p (yeast α-SNAP), Sly1p (a Sec1p family member), Sed5p, the ER-Golgi v-SNAREs Bos1p, Bet1p, and Sec22p, and three novel proteins, p28, p14, and p26 (36Søgaard M.

Here we report the identification of the putative SNAREs p28, p14, and p26 and the detailed characterization of p26, a unique SNARE with close homologues throughout the eukaryotic lineage, each characterized by an isoprenylation signal. DISCUSSIONVesicular traffic through the secretory pathway requires specific pairwise interaction of targeting molecules on vesicles and on the destination membrane to maintain the cellular compartmentalization and directionality of transport. This recognition mechanism is provided by cognate v-SNARE and t-SNARE interactions. In this report we characterize a new v-SNARE, Ykt6p, involved in ER-Golgi transport, increasing the number of potential v-SNAREs at this transport step to four: Bet1p, Bos1p, Sec22p, and Ykt6p. Ykt6p has several hallmarks of a SNARE molecule. It was isolated from an assembled v-t-SNARE complex containing Sed5p, many other SNAREs, and Sec17p and shows significant sequence homology to members of the VAMP/synaptobrevin family like Sec22p. Additionally, Ykt6p, present in a detergent extract of total yeast membranes, interacts directly or as a part of a v-t-SNARE complex with recombinant GST-Sec17p (data not shown). A striking feature distinguishing Ykt6p from other SNAREs is the presence of a CAAX box providing a signal for isoprenylation and thereby mediating membrane attachment. In all other known v-SNAREs, hydrophobic peptide sequence function as membrane anchors. In this respect, all of the Ykt6p homologues, ranging from yeast to man, are unique SNARE molecules.A chromosomal deletion of YKT6 is lethal, but it can be rescued by expression of wild type Ykt6p, amino-terminallymyc-tagged Ykt6p, the human Ykt6p homologue, and a Ykt6p chimera, whose isoprenylation signal has been substituted by a proteinaceous membrane anchor. Ykt6p is present at ∼0.05% of total protein, but cells are completely viable at levels at least 10-fold below this under the conditions we tested. This would indicate that wild type yeast can adapt to low Ykt6p levels. However, Ykt6p function is still clearly required for viability, because these cells could not lose the URA3-based plasmid on 5-fluroorotic acid plates after many generation in glucose media.Interestingly, Ykt6p was found in two cellular pools, one in the cytoplasm and another associated with membranes. Triton X-114 phase partitioning would suggest that both the membrane bound and soluble Ykt6p are prenylated, raising the question how the hydrophobic group is masked in the cytosol. Currently, we cannot answer this question, but our data clearly indicate that the membrane-associated pool of the Ykt6p represents the functional form. Mutant Ykt6p, which lacks the isoprenylation signal, cannot recover the YKT6 deletion. In addition, the chimera Ykt6p/Gos1pTM, containing the Gos1p membrane spanning region instead of the isoprenylation signal, was functionally active, and a cytoplasmic pool of this chimera was not detectable. It was not possible to localize the membrane-bound population of Ykt6p by immunofluorescence microscopy to a distinct intracellular membrane, because fluorescence due to the cytosolic pool of Ykt6p resulted in too large of a background signal.Biochemical studies and the presence of Ykt6p in the isolated Sed5p complex indicate that Ykt6p is involved, at the very least, in ER to Golgi transport. These observations suggest a localization within these compartments. Depletion of Ykt6p function stops cell growth and manifests a transport block at the level of the endoplasmic reticulum, as shown by the accumulation of the p1 form of CPY (Fig. 4). Genetic evidence confirms an ER-Golgi function for Ykt6p. Overexpression of Ykt6p suppresses the temperature-sensitive phenotype of two ER-Golgi v-SNAREs, Sec22p (sec22–1 and sec22–3), and Bos1p (sec32–1). Additionally, a temperature-sensitive allele of Uso1p (uso1–1) can be suppressed by all four ER-Golgi SNARE molecules including Ykt6p (38Sapperstein S.K. Lupashin V.V. Schmitt H.D. Waters M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Morphological data obtained from yeast cells containing reduced levels of the human homologue of Ykt6p, which replaces the endogenous Ykt6p, gave a heterogeneous phenotype. The depleted cells accumulate 50 nm transport vesicle and exaggerated ER membrane further supporting a Ykt6p function in ER-Golgi transport. Similarly vesicle and ER accumulation has been observed in Sed5p-depleted yeast (46Hardwick K.G. Pelham H.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). It is not clear if the exaggerated ER is the primary or secondary effect of the transport block. However, it seems likely that vesicles initially accumulate, and when Ykt6p becomes limiting, production of new vesicles is reduced, leading to the ER accumulation. This would be consistent with a mechanism, which couples vesicle generation to v-SNAREs packaging and therefore ensures generation of docking and fusion competent vesicles. It would also be consistent with a selective block in anterograde transport.We cannot exclude that Ykt6p might also act at transport steps other than ER-Golgi because a cytoplasmic pool of Ykt6p could provide an interacting partner for several SNAREs localized to multiple compartment. Further analysis of Ykt6p localization and distribution will help to determine its precise role in vesicle targeting and fusion.

Recently, we generated gene knockout mice lacking functional β3-ARs and demonstrated that each of these responses were mediated exclusively by β3-ARs. However, the tissue site responsible for producing these actions is unknown. In the present study, genetically engineered mice were created in which β3-ARs are expressed exclusively in white and brown adipocytes (WAT+BAT-mice), or in brown adipocytes only (BAT-mice). This was accomplished by injecting tissue-specific β3-AR transgenic constructs into mouse zygotes homozygous for the β3-AR knockout allele. Control, knockout, WAT+BAT, and BAT-mice were then treated acutely with CL, and the effects on various parameters were assessed. As previously observed, all effects of CL were completely absent in gene knockout mice lacking β3-ARs. The effects on O2 consumption, insulin secretion, and food intake were completely rescued with transgenic re-expression of β3-ARs in white and brown adipocytes (WAT+BAT-mice), demonstrating that each of these responses is mediated exclusively by β3-ARs in white and/or brown adipocytes, and that β3-ARs in other tissue sites were not required. Importantly, transgenic re-expression of β3-ARs in brown adipocytes only (BAT-mice) failed to rescue, in any way, CL-mediated effects on insulin levels and food intake and only minimally restored effects on oxygen consumption, indicating that any effect on insulin secretion and food intake, and a full stimulation of oxygen consumption required the presence of β3-ARs in white adipocytes. The mechanisms by which β3-AR agonist stimulation of white adipocytes produces these responses are unknown but may involve novel mediators not previously known to effect these processes. β3-Adrenergic receptors (β3-ARs) are expressed predominantly on white and brown adipocytes, and acute treatment of mice with CL 316,243, a potent and highly selective β3-AR agonist, produces a 2-fold increase in energy expenditure, a 50–100-fold increase in insulin levels, and a 40–50% reduction in food intake.

Acute treatment of rodents with β3-selective agonists causes a number of diverse metabolic effects including a 2-fold increase in energy expenditure as measured by effects on oxygen consumption, a 10–100-fold increase in insulin levels, and a 40–50% reduction in food intake (8Yoshida T.

While the effects on lipolysis and energy expenditure are likely to be mediated by β3-ARs, uncertainty has existed regarding the identity of receptors mediating the acute effects on insulin levels and food intake.

These animals have a slight increase in body fat; but otherwise, they appear to be normal, probably because of adaptations which compensate for the absence of β3-ARs, one example being the observed up-regulation of β1-AR gene expression in brown and white adipose tissue (11Susulic V.S.

The relative role of β3-ARs in white versus brown adipocytes, as well as β3-ARs in other sites, in mediating each of these responses is also unresolved. For example, is the marked stimulatory effect of β3-selective agonists on energy expenditure mediated exclusively by stimulation of brown adipocytes, or must white adipocytes also be stimulated to supply free fatty acids as fuel for brown adipocytes? Furthermore, as β3-ARs have been reported to exist in the gastrointestinal tract, brain, heart, and prostate and since other sites of expression cannot be excluded (5Granneman J.G. Lahners K.N.

At present, the answers to questions such as these are unknown. In general, it has been difficult to determine the relative role of various target tissues in mediating complex physiologic responses. Genetic engineering in mice, however, provides a means by which these issues can be addressed.

The aP2-β3-AR transgene was created by fusing 5.4 kb of 5′-flanking regulatory sequence of the murine aP2 gene (16Ross S.R. Graves R.A. Greenstein A. Platt K.A. Shyu H.L. Mellovitz B. Spiegelman B.M.

Frederich R.C. Lawitts J. Tozzo E. Kahn B.B. Harper M.E. Himms-Hagen J. Flier J.S. Lowell B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29483-29492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The knockout allele and the WAT+BAT and BAT-transgenes have been maintained on an inbred FVB background. Control animals were wild-type inbred FVB mice housed under conditions similar to the genetically modified animals. All animals were housed at 24 °C, had free access to food (Purina Chow 5008) and water, and were handled in accordance with the principles and guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health. Total RNA was isolated from white and brown adipose tissue, brain, colon, kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle of male mice, age 12 to 20 weeks old, using a Brinkmann homogenizer and RNA STAT-60 solution (Tel-Test “B”, Inc., Friendswood, TX). β3-AR mRNA was detected using standard Northern blotting techniques and 20 μg of total RNA. A β3-AR hybridization probe was generated by random priming from a 306-bp cDNA template corresponding to codons 120–222. Note that this 306-bp cDNA region corresponds to theNheI to XhoI β3-AR fragment deleted during the creation of the β3-AR gene knockout allele. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide, and the abundance of 18 S and 28 S ribosomal bands were used to establish equal loading. To quantitate β3-AR mRNA expression, radioactive signals from all Northern blots were analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Image Quant software). Five hundred pancreatic islets were isolated from 10 normal mice as described previously (21Cunningham B.A. Deeney J.T. Bliss C.R. Corkey B.E. Tornheim K. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E702-E710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted using RNA STAT-60 solution and was then subjected to RT-PCR analysis using mouse β3-AR and actin primer sets (β3-AR sense primer, CCTAGCTGTCACCAACCCTTT; β3-AR antisense primer, GACGAAGAGCATCACAAGGAG; actin sense primer, GTGGGCCGCTCTAGGCACCA; actin antisense primer, CGGTTGGCCTTAGGGTTCAGGGGGG). RNA samples were treated with DNase prior to performing RT-PCR. The β3-AR primer set amplifies a 260-bp fragment, and the actin primer set amplifies a 245-bp fragment. First strand synthesis was performed using the SuperScript preamplification system procedure (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) and the antisense primers for β3-AR and actin listed above. PCR was then performed using TaKaRaEx (Otsu, Shiga, Japan) Taq polymerase. Manufacturers recommended buffer, nucleotide, and primer concentrations were employed. The samples were heated to 94 C for 1.5 min and then cycled for 30 cycles using the following protocol: 98 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 1.5 min. The PCR products were then analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Oxygen consumption was measured in female, 16–20-week old control, knockout, WAT+BAT-, and BAT-mice before and after treatment with CL at 1 mg/kg body weight (subcutaneously). Preliminary experiments with control mice indicated that this dose exerted maximum effects on oxygen consumption. Oxygen consumption was measured using computerized equipment that included a 1-liter chamber maintained at 28 °C, an air flow of 500 ml/min (regulated with a mass flowmeter, Brooks Instrument Division, Emerson Electric), and an oxygen analyzer (Beckman Industrial Oxygen Analyzer model 755). Mice were awake and unrestrained for the study. The resting rate of oxygen consumption (basal) was assessed when the mice were curled up and still, usually 1–2 h after they had been placed in the chamber. The animals were then injected with CL and returned to the chamber. After injection of CL, a constant rate of oxygen uptake was assessed when mice were again resting. Membranes were isolated from interscapular brown adipose tissue of control, knockout, and BAT-mice, and effects of CL on adenylate cyclase activity were assessed as described previously (11Susulic V.S. Frederich R.C. Lawitts J. Tozzo E. Kahn B.B. Harper M.E. Himms-Hagen J. Flier J.S. Lowell B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29483-29492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). CL (1 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal) or saline was injected into female, 8–12-week old control, knockout, WAT+BAT-, and BAT-mice; 15 min later, the animals were quickly sacrificed using a small animal decapitator. Whole blood was collected and analyzed for blood glucose levels (One Touch Blood Glucose Meter, Lifescan, Inc., Milpitas, CA). Serum was then isolated and assayed for FFAs (NEFA C Kit, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) and insulin (Rat Insulin Kit, Linco Research Inc., St. Louis, MO). In a preliminary experiment, control mice were injected with CL, and blood samples were obtained before CL and 5, 10, 15, and 60 min after CL injection. Maximal increases in insulin were observed at the 15-min point. Groups of 20 islets from control, knockout, and WAT+BAT-mice were pre-incubated for 30 min in 3 mm glucose as described previously (21Cunningham B.A. Deeney J.T. Bliss C.R. Corkey B.E. Tornheim K. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E702-E710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The media was removed and then replaced with 1 ml of the following test solutions: 3 mm glucose, 11 mm glucose, or 11 mm glucose plus 1 μm CL. Of note, 11 mm glucose is a submaximal stimulatory concentration of glucose. Twenty min later, the incubation media was removed and assayed for insulin. The effect of a single injection of CL (1 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal) on food intake was assessed in male, 8–12-week old control, knockout, WAT+BAT-, and BAT-mice. The mice were housed individually during the study. For three days prior to the day of CL treatment, the mice received daily injections of saline to acclimate them to handling. On the day of study, each experimental group was divided in half, and one half was treated with saline while the other half received CL. Food was weighed before and 24 h after injection, and the weight of food missing was assumed to represent g of food eaten. The cages were inspected for food spillage and none was noted. A large colony of homozygous β3-AR knockout mice was established (11Susulic V.S. Frederich R.C. Lawitts J. Tozzo E. Kahn B.B. Harper M.E. Himms-Hagen J. Flier J.S. Lowell B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29483-29492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) and used to generate homozygous β3-AR knockout zygotes. These zygotes were injected with the aP2-β3-AR or UCP-β3-AR transgenes (Fig. 1) to create WAT+BAT-mice and BAT-mice, respectively. For the aP2-β3-AR construct, nine founders were produced, six of which transmitted the transgene to offspring. Of these six transmitting WAT+BAT-lines, five lines expressed β3-AR mRNA in white and brown adipose tissue, and three of these expressing lines were selected for further analyses (WAT+BAT-1, WAT+BAT-2, and WAT+BAT-3). For the UCP-β3-AR construct, six founders were produced, five of which transmitted the transgene to offspring. Of these five transmitting BAT-lines, four lines expressed β3-AR mRNA in brown adipose tissue, and two of these expressing lines were selected for further analyses (BAT-1 and BAT-2). Northern blotting was used to determine the expression level of β3-AR mRNA. The probe used for these studies corresponded to the 306-bp β3-AR coding sequence segment, which was deleted during the creation of the knockout allele (Fig. 1). Consequently, no signal was detected in RNA samples isolated from homozygous β3-AR knockout mice (Fig. 2). As expected, WAT+BAT-lines expressed β3-AR mRNA in white and brown adipose tissue while BAT-lines expressed β3-AR mRNA in brown adipose tissue only. With respect to white adipose tissue, line WAT+BAT-1 expressed at a level that was 44% above control mice while lines WAT+BAT-2 and WAT+BAT-3 expressed at levels that were 14 and 47% below control mice, respectively. With respect to brown adipose tissue, lines WAT+BAT-2 and WAT+BAT-3 expressed at levels that were approximately 2.5-fold higher than control mice, lines WAT+BAT-1 and BAT-1 expressed at levels that were just slightly above controls, while line BAT-2 expressed at a level that was slightly below control mice. Northern blot analysis of total RNA isolated from brain, colon, kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle demonstrated that β3-AR mRNA expression, with the possible exception noted below, was restricted to adipose tissue (Fig. 3). In the case of BAT-lines, no expression was detected outside of brown adipose tissue (no signal in white adipose tissue, brain, colon, kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle). In the case of WAT+BAT-lines, however, low-level signals were occasionally detected in skeletal muscle but not in brain, colon, kidney, or liver. It is difficult to establish whether this apparent expression in skeletal muscle was due to ectopic expression in myocytes or represents expression in adipocytes that are resident within or surrounding this tissue. To address this issue, we carefully dissected away visible fat from skeletal muscle obtained from line WAT+BAT-1. Northern blot analysis of these RNA samples failed to detect any specific β3-AR mRNA signal, indicating that the weak signal observed in muscle samples from this line were likely due to the presence of adipocytes. Acute treatment with CL increased oxygen consumption in control mice by 89% (Fig.4). As was previously observed (11Susulic V.S. Frederich R.C. Lawitts J. Tozzo E. Kahn B.B. Harper M.E. Himms-Hagen J. Flier J.S. Lowell B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29483-29492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), this response was completely absent in β3-AR knockout mice (increase of 0%). In WAT+BAT-lines, the effect of CL on oxygen consumption was restored, with lines WAT+BAT-1 (increase of 120%) and WAT+BAT-2 (increase of 103%) having responses that were equal to or greater than control mice and line WAT+BAT-3 (increase of 60%) having a response that was somewhat less than control mice. CL also increased oxygen consumption in BAT-1 (increase of 24%) and BAT-2 (increase of 17%) transgenic mice; however, the O2 consumption response in these mice was notably less than that observed in control mice and in all three lines of WAT+BAT-transgenic mice. Previously, it was assumed that the O2 consumption response to CL was mediated exclusively by β3-ARs in brown adipocytes. Therefore, the markedly reduced O2 consumption response of BAT-1 and BAT-2 mice was somewhat unexpected, especially since Northern blot expression data (Fig. 2) demonstrated that BAT-1 and BAT-2 mice have normal amounts of β3-AR mRNA in brown fat. However, it is formally possible that the mRNA transcribed from the UCP-β3-AR transgene bears an unknown mutation created during transgene construction or that the transgene-derived RNA transcript is translated at a lower efficiency due to differences in 5′-untranslated sequence. To rule out these important possibilities, we assayed for functional β3-ARs by assessing CL-mediated stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity in membranes isolated from interscapular brown adipose tissue of control, knockout, BAT-1, and BAT-2 mice. As previously reported (11Susulic V.S. Frederich R.C. Lawitts J. Tozzo E. Kahn B.B. Harper M.E. Himms-Hagen J. Flier J.S. Lowell B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29483-29492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), adenylate cyclase activity was not stimulated in membranes derived from knockout mice (Fig. 5). In contrast, adenylate cyclase activity was stimulated normally in membranes derived from BAT-1 and BAT-2 mice, demonstrating that BAT-mice express normal amounts of functional β3-ARs in brown adipose tissue and that the reduced O2consumption response in these mice must be due to the absence of β3-ARs in white adipose tissue. Previous studies have demonstrated that acute treatment of rodents with β3-AR selective agonists increases serum insulin levels by 10–100-fold (8Yoshida T. Am. J. Clin.

J., Ram, P. A., Park, S. H., and Choi, H. K. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 13262–13270). We now show that JAK2, the GH receptor-associated tyrosine kinase, is present both in the cytosol and in the nucleus in cultured liver cells and in rat liver in vivo and that GH-activated STAT3 but not STAT5b becomes associated with nuclear JAK2. GH is also shown to activate by 3–4-fold SHP-1, a phosphotyrosine phosphatase that contains twosrc homology 2 (SH2) domains. GH also induces nuclear translocation and binding of SHP-1 to tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5b, suggesting that this GH-activated phosphatase may play a role in dephosphorylation leading to deactivation of nuclear STAT5b following the termination of a plasma GH pulse in male rat liver in vivo. No such association of SHP-1 with GH-activated STAT3 was detected, a finding that could help explain the marked desensitization of STAT3, but not STAT5b, to subsequent GH pulses following an initial GH activation event.

GH actions at the cellular level include direct mitogenic effects (1Isaksson O.G. Eden S. Jansson J.O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 483-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), insulin-like metabolic effects, and gene regulatory actions (2Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Smit L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 187-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In liver, a major target of GH action, GH exerts both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the expression of a wide range of gene products, including hormone receptors, secretory products, and enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (3Waxman D.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 1055-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). An important early cellular response to GH is the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of GH receptor at the cell surface catalyzed by JAK2, a Janus family protein tyrosine kinase (4Argetsinger L.S. Carter-Su C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1089-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This leads to the activation by tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular signaling molecules termed STATs, SH2 domain-containing latent cytoplasmic transcription factors (5Darnell Jr., J. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4948) Google Scholar). The initial GH-activated STAT tyrosine phosphorylation event is followed by a STAT serine or threonine phosphorylation reaction that modulates the DNA-binding activity of the GH-activated STATs (6Ram P.A. Park S.-H. Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5929-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).

Park S.-H. Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5929-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Moreover, whereas STAT5b can be repeatedly phosphorylated by the regular, repeated pulses of GH that characterize adult male rodents, STAT3 and STAT1 become desensitized with respect to GH-induced tyrosine phosphorylation following a single GH pulsein vivo in the hypophysectomized rat liver model (6Ram P.A. Park S.-H. Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5929-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These differences between the STATs may, in part, relate to their distinct mechanisms of activation; STAT5b appears to be activated by JAK2 kinase after docking to one or more phosphotyrosine residues along GH receptor's cytoplasmic tail, whereas STAT3 activation is less reliant on interactions between the STAT and GH receptor's intracellular domain and may involve direct binding of STAT3 to tyrosine-phosphorylated residues on JAK2 kinase (14Yi W.

These signal termination events are of particular biological importance in the case of GH, given the need for GH target cells to respond to intermittent plasma GH pulses, which stimulate a male pattern of long bone and whole body growth in male rodents (17Jansson J.O.

Shapiro B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6868-6872Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). GH pulses also induce a pattern of liver gene transcription in male rat liver that is distinct from the one induced in female liver in response to continuous plasma GH activation (3Waxman D.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 1055-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 19Sundseth S.S. Alberta J.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol.

Of the GH-responsive STATs, STAT5b is uniquely responsive to the pulsatile pattern of plasma GH found specifically in adult male rats and is proposed to be a key intracellular mediator of the physiological effects of GH pulses on male liver gene expression (12Waxman D.J.

This hypothesis is given strong support by our recent finding that targeted disruption of the STAT5b gene in mice leads to complete loss of male-specific liver gene expression, in addition to the feminization of whole body growth rates, a second important GH pulse-regulated biological response. 2Udy, G.

Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), have revealed that phosphotyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) play an important role in GH signal termination (22Gebert C.A. Park S.H. Waxman D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Rapid deactivation of GH-activated STAT5b following cessation of a GH pulse was shown to involve STAT5b phosphotyrosine dephosphorylation as an essential first step. This phosphatase reaction is required to reset the GH receptor/JAK2/STAT5b signaling apparatus so that it may respond to subsequent rounds of GH pulse activation (22Gebert C.A. Park S.H. Waxman D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, the PTPs involved in this key regulatory step have not been identified. PTPs that contain SH2 (phosphotyrosine-binding) domains have been proposed to play a role in signaling from activated receptors belonging to the cytokine receptor superfamily (23Streuli M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), of which GH receptor is a member (24Goffin V. Kelly P.A. Clin.

The PTP designated SHP-1 3Other designations used in the literature are: SHP-1: PTP-1C, SHPTP1, HCP, SHP; SHP-2: PTP-1D, SHPTP2, Syp, PTP-2C. 3Other designations used in the literature are: SHP-1: PTP-1C, SHPTP1, HCP, SHP; SHP-2: PTP-1D, SHPTP2, Syp, PTP-2C. negatively regulates signaling by several cytokine and growth factor receptors, apparently by promoting dephosphorylation of the receptor's intracellular domain and/or the receptor-associated JAK tyrosine kinase (25Klingmuller U.

In the present study, we examine the role of PTPs in regulating GH pulse-dependent activation of STAT5b. We find that GH activates SHP-1, induces its translocation to the nucleus, and stimulates its association with GH-activated, tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5b. We also show that a significant portion of JAK2 tyrosine kinase is nuclear, rather than cytoplasmic in liver cells, and that this nuclear JAK2 binds specifically to GH-activated STAT3 but not STAT5b in rat liver. The importance of these findings is discussed in the context of the signaling pathways induced by pulsatile GH in hepatocytes.DISCUSSIONGH is presently shown to activate the phosphotyrosine-specific phosphatase SHP-1, to stimulate its nuclear translocation, and to induce the selective binding of SHP-1 to GH-activated, tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5b. These studies, carried out in liver cells in vivo and in the liver-derived cell culture model CWSV-1, suggest that SHP-1 may catalyze the phosphotyrosine dephosphorylation reaction which serves as the initial step of STAT5b deactivation (22Gebert C.A. Park S.H. Waxman D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). SHP-1, an SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase preferentially expressed in hematopoietic and epithelial cells, acts as a negative regulator of cell signaling by several cytokines and growth factors, including erythropoietin (25Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), interferon α (36David M. Chen H.E. Goelz S. Larner A.C. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7050-7058Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), and antigen receptor (26D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), although instances of positive regulatory effects have also been reported (37Su L. Zhao Z. Bouchard P. Banville D. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Shen S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10385-10390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the case of erythropoietin, SHP-1 inhibits the signaling cascade by docking to the receptor's tyrosine-phosphorylated cytoplasmic tail, enabling SHP-1 to interact with and dephosphorylate, and thereby deactivate, JAK2 kinase (25Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). This inhibition by SHP-1 of erythropoietin signaling at the level of the cell surface receptor-JAK kinase complex would appear to be distinct from the effects of SHP-1 on GH signaling, where we were unable to detect a direct GH receptor-SHP-1 binding interaction. Rather, SHP-1 is proposed to down-regulate GH signals by dephosphorylation of STAT5b, a process that is critical for the rapid deactivation of STAT5b between plasma GH pulses in vivo and that enables STAT5b to recycle back to the cytoplasm in time to respond to an incoming GH pulse (12Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.-H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 22Gebert C.A. Park S.H. Waxman D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). SHP-1 may thus participate in two fundamentally distinct signal desensitization processes. SHP-1-catalyzed dephosphorylation of cell surface receptors and/or JAK2 kinase blocks a catalytic cascade, whereby one growth factor receptor or JAK kinase dephosphorylation event prevents multiple downstream STAT5b activation events. By contrast, the dephosphorylation of GH-activated STAT5b by SHP-1 would correspond to a downstream inactivation event that is stoichiometric with respect to the STAT transcription factor. This deactivation of GH signaling at the level of STAT5b dephosphorylation does not, however, preclude the need for upstream step(s) to dephosphorylate GH receptor and to down-regulate GH-activated JAK2, which dephosphorylates within 45 min after GH addition in the case of liver cells (Fig. 6). These upstream deactivation events may be mediated by SHP-2, as suggested by the weak association that we have detected between SHP-2 and the tyrosine- phosphorylated GH receptor COOH terminus. 6P. A. Ram and D. J. Waxman, unpublished experiments. The mechanism by which SHP-1 binds to STAT5b is not yet known, but given the requirement for STAT5b tyrosine phosphorylation for binding to occur, this interaction is likely to involve a direct binding of phosphotyrosine residue 694 of STAT5b (38Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) by one of the SH2 domains of SHP-1. SH2 domain occupancy leads to activation of catalytic activity for both SHP-1 and SHP-2 (26D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 32Pei D. Lorenz U. Klingmuller U. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2897-2900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and thus the binding of activated STAT5b per se could directly stimulate the GH-dependent increase in SHP-1 enzyme activity that we observed. Alternatively, other cellular molecules that undergo GH-induced tyrosine phosphorylation could be responsible for SHP-1 activation. SHP-1-STAT5b binding was seen with tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5b and also with tyrosine + serine/threonine-diphosphorylated STAT5b, indicating that the secondary serine/threonine phosphorylation reaction is not required for binding to SHP-1. Further studies are needed to ascertain whether STAT5b directly activates SHP-1, and if so, whether the two phosphorylated STAT5b forms both activate SHP-1 to the same extent. A possible differential effect of the two phosphorylated STAT5b forms is suggested by the partial inhibitory effect that the serine/threonine kinase inhibitor H7 had on GH-induced SHP-1 activation (Fig. 2 A2). This possibility is consistent with our earlier conclusion that a cellular serine/threonine kinase activity is required for rapid STAT5b deactivation (22Gebert C.A. Park S.H. Waxman D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).Only a portion of the cellular pool of activated STAT5b appears to be bound by SHP-1, as judged by the incomplete association of STAT5b with SHP-1 (Fig. 3 B and data not shown). This is not unexpected, insofar as the interaction of these two signaling molecules may be transient. Moreover, given the proposed catalytic role of SHP-1, whereby one molecule of SHP-1 could, in principle, dephosphorylate many STAT5b molecules, SHP-1 levels in the nucleus are likely to be sub-stoichiometric with respect to STAT5b. In this case, only a portion of the STAT5b pool would be stably associated with SHP-1 at any one time, allowing for the remaining STAT5b molecules to comprise a substrate pool.GH stimulated a 3–4-fold increase in SHP-1 activity, as judged by phosphotyrosine phosphatase assay of SHP-1 immunoprecipitates from GH-activated CWSV-1 cells. This activity increase was reversed within 1–2 h and may reflect activation resulting from the binding of STAT5b's phosphotyrosine residue to the amino-terminal SH2 domain of SHP-1. The observed activity increase could be a minimum estimate of the fold activation of SHP-1 in intact cells, as there may be some loss of STAT5b, or perhaps other bound activators during the immunoprecipitation step. In vitro activation assays using synthetic phosphotyrosine-containing peptides derived from cell surface receptors and other signaling molecules that bind to SHP-1 have revealed intrinsic fold activation values that range up to >25-fold (32Pei D. Lorenz U. Klingmuller U. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15483-15493Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 33Pei D. Wang J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1141-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, this potential for a high degree of SHP-1 activation, evident in vitro, does not always translate into a corresponding major enhancement of SHP-1 activity in intact cells, as seen in the case of SHP-1 bound to the receptor for the Fc region of IgG (26D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The 3–4-fold activation observed for SHP-1 in GH-treated cells could similarly underestimate the intrinsic fold activation of this PTP by the STAT5b-derived phosphotyrosine peptide. Recruitment of STAT5b to both the NH2-terminal and the COOH-terminal SH2 domain of SHP-1 would be expected to moderate the extent of SHP-1 activation compared with NH2-terminal SH2 binding interactions alone (33Pei D. Wang J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1141-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).STAT5b is only transiently active when stimulated by a GH pulse in liver in vivo (12Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.-H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This allows for successive cycles of plasma GH pulsation to induce successive cycles of STAT5b activation. This periodic response of liver STAT5b to GH pulses does not depend on new protein synthesis (22Gebert C.A. Park S.H. Waxman D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), necessitating repeat cycles of STAT5b dephosphorylation followed by rephosphorylation. The translocation of SHP-1 to the nucleus following GH stimulation and the association of SHP-1 with tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5b described in the present study are thus likely to be important, not only for recruitment of the phosphatase to nuclear STAT5b, but also for regulation of SHP-1's phosphatase activity in a manner that allows for the repeated activation of STAT5b upon stimulation of hepatocytes by plasma GH pulses in vivo. Indeed, we have observed that repeat GH pulses also lead to repeat cycles of SHP-1 activation and deactivation (Fig. 2 C).In the hypophysectomized rat liver model, SHP-1 remained in the nucleus following GH treatment well after the deactivation and loss of nuclear STAT5b were complete (Fig. 4 B). This observation is consistent with our observation that SHP-1 is constitutively present in the nucleus of male rat livers, both at the time of a plasma GH pulse and during the GH interpulse interval, when STAT5b has been dephosphorylated and is no longer present in the nucleus.6SHP-1 is also present in female liver nuclei, albeit at a somewhat lower level than in the males (Figs. 1 A and 4 D), despite the fact that the STAT5b signaling pathway is down-regulated and is essentially inactive in these animals. Only in the case of chronic GH deficiency (hypophysectomized rat liver or CWSV-1 cells cultured in the absence of GH) did we observe low levels of nuclear SHP-1 and high levels of cytoplasmic SHP-1. We conclude that the GH-induced nuclear translocation of SHP-1 is not dependent on a concurrent nuclear translocation of STAT5b and thus may proceed by a mechanism that is distinct from the direct tyrosine phosphorylation mechanism that induces STAT5b nuclear translocation. Indeed, although cytokine/growth factor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-1 and SHP-2 has been observed in other systems (e.g. Refs. 29Ali S. Chen Z. Lebrun J.J. Vogel W. Kharitonenkov A. Kelly P.A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 31Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3856-3862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, and 35Feng G.S. Hui C.C. Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), we were unable to detect tyrosine phosphorylation SHP-1 in our experiments. While it is conceivable that GH may induce SHP-1 tyrosine phosphorylation that could not be detected using our analytical methods, it seems more likely that SHP-1 nuclear translocation and its enzymatic activation do not involve SHP-1 tyrosine phosphorylation directly but rather proceed via a different mechanism. Activation of SHP-1 following GH treatment could simply involve its direct binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated signaling molecules, as exemplified by the SHP-1-STAT5b binding interaction observed in the present study. This possibility is an attractive one, since it provides a simple mechanism for deactivation of SHP-1 once its tyrosine-phosphorylated substrate has been dephosphorylated. Indeed, GH pulse treatment of cultured liver cells leads to a cycle of SHP-1 activation, followed by deactivation within 1–2 h (Fig.2 A), a time course that mirrors both the cycle of STAT5b activation and deactivation (Fig. 3 A) and the binding of STAT5b to SHP-1 (Fig. 3 B).Previous studies have shown that the three GH-activated liver STATs, STATs 1, 3 and 5b, differ in their responses to GH in several important ways. These include the striking dependence of STAT5b, but not STATs 1 and 3, on the temporal pattern of GH activation, the preferential activation of STAT5b, as compared with the other STATs, at physiological GH levels, and the marked desensitization of STATs 1 and 3, but not STAT5b, following a single GH pulse (6Ram P.A. Park S.-H. Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5929-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These differences may, in part, result from differences in the mechanisms through which these STATs become activated, and subsequently inactivated, following GH treatment. Whereas STAT5b becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated as a consequence of its direct binding to the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail of GH receptor (Fig. 5 B) (14Yi W. Kim S.O. Jiang J. Park S.H. Kraft A.S. Waxman D.J. Frank S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1425-1443PubMed Google Scholar, 15Smit L.S. Meyer D.J. Billestrup N. Norstedt G. Schwartz J. Carter-Su C. Mol.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), STAT3 is more reliant on interactions with JAK2 for activation. This model is now supported by the physical association of JAK2 with STAT3 but not STAT5b (Fig. 8) and by functional studies using JAK2 kinase-GH receptor chimeras (14Yi W. Kim S.O. Jiang J. Park S.H. Kraft A.S. Waxman D.J. Frank S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1425-1443PubMed Google Scholar). A further difference between the GH-activated STATs is apparent from the present SHP-1 binding studies, where SHP-1 binding was observed in the case of activated STAT5b, but not activated STAT3. Whereas SHP-1 seems likely to play an important role in the deactivation of STAT5b and its subsequent return to the cytosol, GH-activated STAT3 may be deactivated by a distinct mechanism. Ubiquitination leading to proteolytic degradation, recently described for interferon-γ activated STAT1 (40Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), is a possible alternative deactivation mechanism for STAT3. Proteolytic degradation of STATs 1 and 3 could help explain the marked desensitization that both STAT proteins undergo following an initial GH activation event in vivo (6Ram P.A. Park S.-H. Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5929-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).Biochemical fractionation studies demonstrated that a significant amount of JAK2 is constitutively expressed in the nucleus of liver cells in vivo (Fig. 1 F). Immunofluorescence studies further established that following GH stimulation, a portion of the cellular JAK2 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Fig.7 A).

The mechanisms by which this desensitization proceeds remain obscure, however. Because some intracellular domain sequences of the ETA-R and ETB-R differ substantially, we tested the possibility that these receptor subtypes might be differentially regulated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). Homologous, or receptor-specific, desensitization occurred within 4 min both in the ETA-R-expressing A10 cells and in 293 cells transfected with either the human ETA-R or ETB-R.

Copper is an essential prosthetic group of proteins such as cytosolic superoxide dismutase that is required for detoxification of oxygen free radicals and thus for the fitness of aerobic organisms (1Gralla E.B. Kosman D.J. Adv. Genet. 1992; 30: 251-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The copper sites in cytochrome oxidase are essential for the activity of this enzyme and thus for sustained cellular respiration (2Linder M.C. Linder M.C. Biochemistry of Copper. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1991: 1-13Crossref Google Scholar). More recently, a role for copper enzymes in iron metabolism has been defined (3Kaplan J. O'Halloran T.V.

The toxicity of copper may derive from the reaction of Cu(I) with hydrogen peroxide yielding the highly reactive hydroxyl radical that in turn may damage lipids, proteins, or DNA in cells (8Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Clarendon Press, Oxford1988: 31-58Google Scholar). One way that cells solve the problem of acquisition of sufficient copper while avoiding toxic excess is by homeostatic control of copper uptake (2Linder M.C. Linder M.C. Biochemistry of Copper. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1991: 1-13Crossref Google Scholar,9Kosman D.J. Winkelmann G. Winge D.R. Metal Ions in Fungi. Marcel Dekker, New York1994: 1-38Google Scholar). In aerated media, copper, like iron, is complexed to media components in its higher valence state. Since data indicate that the metals enter the cell uncomplexed to any extracellular ligand, an initial ligand displacement step must precede the movement of the metal ion across the plasma membrane (9Kosman D.J. Winkelmann G. Winge D.R. Metal Ions in Fungi. Marcel Dekker, New York1994: 1-38Google Scholar). Ligand coordination to lower valence ions is typically more labile than to the corresponding high valence species (9Kosman D.J. Winkelmann G. Winge D.R. Metal Ions in Fungi. Marcel Dekker, New York1994: 1-38Google Scholar), and therefore reduction of copper in the environment facilitates cellular uptake. The major surface reductase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the FRE1 gene product (10Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 128-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In most laboratory strains of S. cerevisiae, cellular copper acquisition requires CTR1 (13Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 14Knight S.A. Labbe S. Kwon L.E. Kosman D.J. Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1929-1947Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar). CTR1 protein exists in the cell as a multimer in the plasma membrane (15Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although in some settings it may be internalized into the endocytotic pathway (16Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). CTR1 contains an unusual amino-terminal domain oriented toward the cell exterior (13Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). This domain, rich in methionine and serine, is similar to copper-binding domains present in bacterial proteins mediating copper resistance (17Odermatt A. Suter H. Krapf R. Solioz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12775-12779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Cha J. Cooksey D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8915-8919Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The homology of the methionine-rich domain with copper binding proteins suggests that it will form a pocket with affinity for Cu(I). The subsequent events involved in internalization and translocation of the metal across the cell membrane and into the cytosol have not been characterized. Expression of FRE1 (11Lesuisse E. Labbe P. Winkelmann G. Winge D.R. Metal Ions in Fungi. Marcel Dekker, New York1994: 149-178Google Scholar, 12Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 128-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and CTR1 (15Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are homeostatically regulated by copper availability, consistent with the roles of the two gene products in copper acquisition. The regulation ofFRE1 (12Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 128-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), like the regulation of CTR1 (15Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is mediated at the level of copper-dependent transcription. Copper deprivation induces and copper loading represses transcription of both of these genes. Thus, cellular component(s) must exist through which the signal for available copper levels is transduced into regulated transcription of these genes. ACE1 must be considered as a candidate for this transducing function (19Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 9: 2745-2752Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar). ACE1 encodes a yeast protein that binds copper (20Dameron C.T. George G.N. Arnold P. Santhanagopalan V. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7294-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and activates the transcription of target genes in a copper-dependent fashion (21Szczypka M. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, strains deleted for the ACE1 gene maintain homeostatic regulation of the surface reductase and copper uptake (15Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, ACE1 protein mediates the induction of genes involved in copper detoxification, including CUP1, the yeast metallothionein (19Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 9: 2745-2752Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and SOD1, the copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (22Gralla E.B. Thiele D.J. Silar P. Valentine J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8558-8562Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Because these genes function in cellular protection, the threshold copper concentrations at which these genes are expressed are relatively high (μm concentrations in defined media). In contrast, the copper exposure at which regulation of the copper uptake system occurs is much lower (less than 20 nm in defined media) (7Yuan D. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 15Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the copper acquisition system is repressed by copper availability (15Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and thus is regulated in a direction opposite from the detoxification system controlled byACE1 (19Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 9: 2745-2752Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar). These several factors make ACE1 an unlikely candidate for the copper sensor controlling copper uptake. A protein with homology to ACE1, called MAC1, must also be considered. The sequence of the MAC1 protein is notable for an amino-terminal domain (residues 1–42) with significant homology to ACE1. The activator for the metallothionein genes in Candida glabrata,AMT1, is also homologous in this region (23Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In addition, MAC1 contains a motif conforming to the pattern CysXCysX 4CysXCysX 2CysX 2His. This motif occurs twice in the carboxyl-terminal portion of the protein. It is within the first of these repeats, residues 264–279, that the mutation in the dominant MAC1 up1 allele occurs, resulting in a His to Gln substitution at residue 279 (23Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar).FRE1 expression and copper uptake are not repressed by copper in strains containing this dominant MAC1 allele (12Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 128-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar,23Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The MAC1 protein, fused to the lacZ gene product for purposes of tracking, has been localized to the nucleus consistent with a role for MAC1 in transcriptional regulation (23Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Here we report evidence that strongly indicates that the MAC1 protein functions as the copper sensor-regulator that controls the expression of surface reductase and copper uptake activity in yeast and thus provides homeostatic control of copper acquisition. We characterize the direct interaction of MAC1 protein with specific sequence elements in the promoters of the CTR1 and FRE1 genes and show that these elements alone support copper- and MAC1-dependent transcriptional activation. The data suggest that MAC1 binding to these elements plays a role in the transduction of environmental copper levels into regulated gene transcription within yeast cells. The MAC1 up1 mutant isolate, called UPC31 (MAT a trp1-1 ade8 his3 gal1 CUP1 R MAC1 up1 ), and its parent, strain BR10 (MAT a trp1-1 ade8 his3 gal1 CUP1 R MAC1), have been previously described (23Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Strain MA20 (MAT a ino1-13 leu2-3,112 gcn4-101 his3-609 FRE1-HIS3::URA3 MAC1 up2 ) was derived from strain 81 (MAC1) by selecting for histidine prototrophic mutants on plates with iron and copper added to defined medium as described (13Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). CM3262 (MAT a ino1-13 leu2-3,112 gcn4-101 his3-609 ura3-52) (13Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) was a parent of strain 81 and was used as a control in some experiments. MA20p was derived from MA20 by incubation in the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid to eject the integrated FRE1-HIS3::URA3 and thereby restore uracil auxotrophy which was needed for transformation (24Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 194: 281-301Crossref Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). For deletion of MAC1, the plasmid pACU1:LEU2 was used. This plasmid was constructed by cloning a genomic fragment carrying theMAC1 gene between SacI and XbaI sites into the compatible SacI and SalI sites of Bluescript SK+. The genomic sequences were modified by opening at the unique internal NcoI and EcoRI sites, and aLEU2 cassette with HindIII linkers was inserted into this site. The plasmid could then be digested with ApaI and SacI to release a linear fragment for gene replacement of MAC1 with LEU2. In this manner, theMAC1 gene was deleted in strains CM3262 and H1085 creating 3262Δmac (MAT a ino1-13 leu2-3,112 gcn4-101 his3-609 ura3-52 Δmac1::LEU2) and WY10 (MATaura3-52 leu2-3,112 Δmac1::LEU2), respectively. The presence of the expected gene replacement in these strains was verified by PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; BCS, bathocuproine disulfonic acid; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. or by Southern blot, respectively. FTRUNB1 (MAT a ino1-13 leu2-3,112 gcn4-101 his3-609 ura3-52 Δctr1::URA3) was constructed in the CM3262 background by replacing the CTR1locus with URA3 as described (13Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Copper concentrations were manipulated in YPD medium (2% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 2% glucose) by the addition of the copper chelator BCS or by the addition of copper sulfate. In some experiments, the strains were grown in defined media containing yeast nitrogen base without amino acids modified to omit iron and copper. This ingredient (6.7 g/liter) was added to glucose (2%), MES buffer (25 mm, pH 6.1), and BCS for copper starvation or copper sulfate for copper loading. Iron was added back as ferric ammonium sulfate in a concentration of 10 μm. A 1-mm loopful of yeast grown on a fresh YPD plate was inoculated into 10 ml of liquid medium and grown overnight with aeration and agitation at 30 °C to late log phase (A 600 approximately 2.0). The following day, the culture was diluted into medium of the same composition at an A 600 of 0.2 and grown for an additional 5 h prior to harvesting. Methods for crossing, sporulation, spore dissection, and transformation of yeast were as described (25Rose M.D. Winston F.M. Heiter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). MA20 (MAC1 up2 leu2-3,112) was crossed with WY10 (Δmac1::LEU2 leu2-3,112) and the diploid was sporulated. Spore clones derived from 12 tetrads were evaluated for leucine prototrophy and non-repressing reductase activity. This phenotype has been associated with the MAC1 up1 mutation (23Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Clones with non-repressing reductase were in all cases found to be incapable of growing in the absence of leucine, indicating lack of recombination between the marked MAC1 allele and the non-repressing reductase phenotype of the MA20 mutant. The MAC1 up2 allele was also rescued by gap repair (24Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 194: 281-301Crossref Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). A 1.6-kilobase pair NarI fragment containing the entire MAC1 open reading frame was removed from the 3.0-kilobase pair HindIII MAC1 clone in pSEY8 (23Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The resulting gapped pSEY8 that now contained regions 5′ and 3′ to the MAC1 open reading frame as sticky ends was transformed into MA20 (MAC1 up2 ), and recircularized plasmid was recovered. This plasmid mixture was amplified inEscherichia coli and the recoveredMAC1 up2 allele in pSEY8 was sequenced from −162 to +1585 (numbering relative to MAC1 translation start, with termination at +1251) by the standard chain termination method (Sequenase 2.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). CTR1 (andFRE1) mRNA levels in wild type,MAC1 up1, and MAC1 up2 containing strains were determined by Northern blot analysis following standard protocols (26Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1993) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, MAC1 in Copper Homeostasis in Yeast 17717 pp. 4.9.1- 4.9.14, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). For determining CTR1 protein levels a myc-tagged protein fusion was constructed. To do this, the HindIII fragment was excised from plasmid 352-myc (13Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) and inserted into theHindIII sites of pRS416, creating plasmid 416-CTR1myc. This construct contains a myc epitope tag inserted at the uniqueEcoRI site of the genomic CTR1 clone and is carried on a centromere-linked vector. CTR1 protein visualization was as follows. Cultures of transformants with the 352-myc plasmid (myc epitope labeled CTR1 genomic clone) were grown to log phase. Approximately 2 × 107cells were harvested and lysed by pelleting and resuspending in 150 μl of 1.85 m NaOH, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were precipitated by the addition of 150 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid and incubation on ice for 30 min. The precipitate was then recovered by centrifuging at 16,000 × g for 10 min prior to resuspending in 45 μl of 2 × Laemmli buffer and 5 μl of 1m Tris base. Ten microliters or 4 × 106cell equivalents were loaded per lane of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were blotted to nitrocellulose, and the myc-tagged CTR1 protein was visualized using 9E10 ascites anti-myc monoclonal antibody and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody. The enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.) was used to develop the signal from the epitope labeled protein. Plasmids containing portions of the CTR1 promoter fused to the lacZgene were constructed as follows. Sequences from the CTR1promoter, translation start, and codons 1–3 were amplified by PCR between unique SalI and BamHI sites and fused to the β-galactosidase coding region in plasmid pYEGal4. 5′ deletions of the CTR1 sequences (numbered with respect to the translation start) were made by PCR, creating plasmids pCTRlac1-413, -334, -333, -311, and -226. For pGC-CTR(−337/−301), the oligonucleotides depicted in Fig. 6 A and flanked by SalI half-sites were inserted into the XhoI site of pLG699-Z (27Guarente L. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2199-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Correctness of the inserted sequence and orientation of the insert were verified by direct sequencing of the plasmid. Sequences encoding the FLAG epitope were introduced 3′ of the MAC1 coding sequence and subcloned into pBluescript IISK(−), creating plasmid pT7MAC1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed with MAC1 protein that was prepared by in vitro transcription and translation. This assay was carried out essentially as described for the AFT1 EMSA (28Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). MAC1mRNA was synthesized from the pT7MAC1 plasmid with T7 polymerase and translated in a wheat germ lysate (Promega). The binding reaction was carried out in 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 7.5% glycerol) containing 2 ng of 32P-end-labeled probe, salmon sperm DNA, and in vitro translated MAC1 protein. The binding reaction mixtures were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and then electrophoresed in a 4% native polyacrylamide gel in 6.6 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 3.3 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA at 4 °C. To evaluate reductase activity in yeast on solid media, spore clones were streaked onto YPD plates containing 50 μm copper sulfate and incubated overnight at 30 °C. The reductase activity was then evaluated by filter lift assay as described (29Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The MAC1 up1 orMAC1 up2 clones gave a strong signal in this assay while the wild-type MAC1 clones were negative. Quantitative Fe(III) and Cu(II) reductase activity was determined in cell suspensions as described using bathophenanthroline disulfonate and bathocuproine disulfonate as indicators of Fe(II) and Cu(I) production, respectively (12Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 128-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity in yeast transformants was determined by a standard technique (27Guarente L. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2199-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). For 67Cu uptake measurement, strains were grown in YPD to log phase, washed in assay buffer consisting of 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.5, 5% glucose, and incubated at a density of approximately 2 × 108 cells/ml in the presence of 1 μm67CuSO4 of specific activity 820 dpm/pmol copper. After 1 h incubation at 30 or 4 °C, washed cells were collected on glass fiber filters and counted in a scintillation counter. Copper uptake, reported as pmol/million cells/h, was calculated after subtracting cell-associated counts obtained at 4 °C from the cell-associated counts obtained at 30 °C. The promoter of the FRE1 gene mediates a wide range of transcriptional changes in response to copper or iron (10Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 12Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 128-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Thus, mutants selected for FRE1 dysregulation included strains with abnormalities of copper or iron metabolism (13Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The selection scheme, which has been described previously (13Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), involved the fusion of the FRE1 promoter element to a HIS3 selectable marker and integration into a his3 deleted strain. The mutants were selected for the inability to repress FRE1transcription under conditions of abundant copper and iron. A mutant strain identified by this method, MA20, exhibited surface Fe(III) and Cu(II) reductase activity that was poorly repressed by copper (Fig.1). This phenotype resembled that of the previously described MAC1 up1 mutant (12Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 128-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 23Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The MA20 mutant was crossed with the parental strain 61, and the diploid, like the haploid, was found to possess reductase activity that was not repressible by copper indicating that the mutation behaved as a dominant (not shown). This dominance also resembled the previously described MAC1 up1 mutant (23Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The MA20 strain was then mated with WY10, a strain carrying a LEU2-markedMAC1 allele, and the diploid was sporulated. Spore clones analyzed from 12 independent meioses revealed no recombination between the LEU2 marker and the non-repressing reductase phenotype, suggesting that the mutation in MA20 was allelic toMAC1. Direct rescue of the MAC1 mutant allele was then accomplished by means of gap repair (24Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 194: 281-301Crossref Scopus (1093) Google Scholar), and the entireMAC1 coding region in MA20 was sequenced. A single mutation, a G to A missense mutation at nucleotide 812 (SCMAC1 accession no.X74551), was identified. This mutation was predicted to alter the residue at position 271 in the primary sequence from a cysteine to a tyrosine. Thus, this mutation causes an amino acid substitution within the same Cys-rich domain, residues 264–279, as the His279to Gln substitution due to the MAC1 up1 allele (23Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). To determine if the MAC1 up2 allele conferred the same elevated copper uptake observed in MAC1 up1 containing strains (12Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 128-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 23Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), high affinity copper uptake was evaluated in a congenic panel of strains containing theMAC1 up2 allele (MA20), a MAC1 wild-type allele (CM3262), or a mac1Δ allele (3262Δmac). The results revealed that the MAC1 up2 allele conferred increased copper uptake (Fig. 3). Evaluation of actr1Δ-containing strain revealed negligible high affinity copper uptake similar to the mac1Δ phenotype (13Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) (Fig.3). The resemblance between ctr1Δ and mac1Δstrains suggested a model in which the nuclear MAC1 protein mediates the transcriptional activation of CTR1 in response to copper deprivation. According to this model, CTR1 protein, functioning downstream of MAC1, acts as the structural mediator of copper uptake at the plasma membrane. A prediction of this model is that different MAC1 alleles should support different patterns of copper-dependentCTR1 expression. This was tested first by evaluating the steady-state FRE1 and CTR1 transcript levels in strains BR10 (MAC1), BR10Δmac1, UPC31(MAC1 up1 ), CM3262(MAC1), and MA20 (MAC1 up2 ). These levels were determined by Northern blot analysis and are shown in Fig. 4 A. In both MAC1 wild-type backgrounds, copper deprivation (BCS str"

Two genes encoding protein-tyrosine phosphatases, PTP2, and a new phosphatase,PTP3, have been isolated in a genetic selection for negative regulators of an osmotic stress response pathway called HOG, for high osmolarity glycerol, in budding yeast. PTP2 and PTP3 were isolated as multicopy suppressors of a severe growth defect due to hyperactivation of the HOG pathway. Phosphatase activity is required for suppression since mutation of the catalytic Cys residue in Ptp2 and Ptp3, destroys suppressor function and biochemical activity. The substrate of these phosphatases is likely to be the MAPK, Hog1. Catalytically inactive Ptp2 and Ptp3 coprecipitate with Hog1 from yeast extracts. In addition, strains lacking PTP2 and PTP3 do not dephosphorylate Hog1-phosphotyrosine as well as wild type. The latter suggests that PTP2 and PTP3 play a role in adaptation. Consistent with this role, osmotic stress induces expression of PTP2 and PTP3 transcripts in a Hog1-dependent manner. Thus Ptp2 and Ptp3 likely act in a negative feedback loop to inactivate Hog1.

In metazoans and in yeast, MAPK pathways regulate growth, development, and the response to stress (reviewed in Refs. 1Horvitz H.R. Sternberg P.W.

In Drosophila,Caenorhabditis elegans, and vertebrates, receptor tyrosine kinases, acting through Ras and Raf, activate MEK and MAPK, regulating growth and development. In vertebrates, JNK/SAPK, and p38, kinases similar to MAPK, regulate stress responses. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, six different MAPK signaling pathways regulate mating, pseudohyphal growth, invasiveness, cell wall biosynthesis, the response to osmotic stress, and spore wall formation. Common to all MAPK pathways are two sequentially acting kinases called MEK and MAPK, termed the MAPK module. MEK is activated by phosphorylation of Ser and Thr residues. MEK activates MAPK by phosphorylating a Thr and Tyr residue in a region called the phosphorylation lip. Although mechanisms that activate MAPK pathways have been well characterized, mechanisms that inactivate these pathways are not as well understood. Protein phosphatases negatively regulate MAPK pathways, but the identity of the physiologically relevant phosphatases and their targets is unclear. MEK is inactivated in vitro by the vertebrate Ser/Thr phosphatase, PP2A (6Gomez N. Cohen P. Nature. 1991; 353: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), but it is not established that this occurs in vivo. More is known about the inactivation of MAPK. Since MAPKs require phosphorylation of both a Thr and a Tyr residue for activity, dephosphorylation of either residue results in inactivation. Consistent with this, three different types of phosphatases including dual specificity phosphatases, Ser/Thr phosphatases, and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) have been shown to inactivate MAPKs (reviewed in Refs. 7Mumby M.C.

Gene ( Amst .). 1992; 122: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) negatively regulates the osmotic stress response pathway, and indirect evidence suggests this occurs by dephosphorylation of Hog1-phosphotyrosine (Hog1-Tyr(P)) (25Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). We sought to examine further the regulation of MAPK pathways by identifying and characterizing protein phosphatases that act on the HOG pathway in S. cerevisiae. This pathway allows yeast to grow in high osmolarity environments by inducing the expression of osmoprotectants via activation of the MAPK module, Pbs2-Hog1 (Fig. 1) (26Brewster J.L. Devaloir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Upstream of the MAPK module is a negative regulator, the “two-component system,” comprised of three sequentially acting kinases including Sln1, a plasma membrane bound histidine/aspartyl kinase, Ypd1, a histidine kinase, and Ssk1, an aspartyl kinase (25Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar, 27Ota I.M. Varshavsky A.

Cell. 1996; 86: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). These kinases negatively regulate two MEKKs called Ssk2 and Ssk22 (29Maeda T. Takekawa M. Saito H. Science. 1995; 269: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). There is also a positive regulator upstream of the MAPK module called Sho1 which activates Pbs2 directly (29Maeda T. Takekawa M. Saito H. Science. 1995; 269: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The model for activation of this pathway is as follows. Osmotic shock inactivates the two-component system, resulting in activation of the MEKKs that in turn activate the MAPK module. Osmotic shock activates Sho1 which directly activates Pbs2 via an SH3 domain. Under standard growth conditions, mutational inactivation of the negative regulator, SLN1, constitutively activates the HOG pathway and is lethal on rich media and grows extremely poorly on less rich, synthetic media (27Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. Science. 1993; 262: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Using this phenotype, we identified negative regulators as genes which, when overexpressed from a multicopy plasmid, restore viability. In addition to PTP2, we identified a second gene, PTP3, that inactivates this pathway by targeting Hog1. PTP2 and PTP3 are transcriptionally regulated; activation of the HOG pathway induces expression of PTP2 and PTP3, providing a mechanism for adaptation to signal. To identify suppressors of the HOG pathway, a yeast genomic library was transformed into IMY101, a strain bearing a SLN1 deletion,sln1-Δ1:HIS3, and a low copy, CEN-based plasmid containing the wild type SLN1 gene and the URA3 gene (27Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. Science. 1993; 262: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Yeast transformations were performed as described by Dohmen et al. (30Dohmen R.J. Strasser A.W.M. Honer C.B. Hollenberg C.P. Yeast. 1991; 7: 691-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). To follow the level of Hog1-Tyr(P), haploids derived from DF5 (31Finley D. Ozkaynak E. Varshavksy A. Cell. 1987; 48: 1035-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) were transformed with 2 μm HOG1, a multicopy 2-μm-based plasmid bearing HOG1 and TRP1, kindly provided by M. Gustin (26Brewster J.L. Devaloir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). The strains bearing 2 μm HOG1 are BBY48, a wild type strain (32Bartel B. Wunning I. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3179-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), IMY21a, a ptp2Δ strain (22Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2355-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), HF2, a ptp3Δ strain, and HFY6, a ptp2Δ ptp3Δ strain. For biochemical analysis of Ptp2 and Ptp3, glutathione S-transferase (GST)-PTP fusion proteins were expressed in RS334, kindly provided by R. Sclafani (33Hovland P. Flick J. Johnston M. Sclafani R.A. Gene ( Amst .). 1989; 83: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To test whether the GST-PTP fusions were functional in vivo, the pGST-PTP plasmids (see below) were transformed into TJY1, which bears the SLN1 deletion, sln1-Δ1::HIS3, and pSLN1-URA3. TJY1 is derived from JD51, a galactose-inducible strain (34Ghislain M. Dohmen R.J. Levy F. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4884-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). A strain bearing a disruption of thePTC1/TPD1 gene was produced by transformation of DF5 with the tpd1::LEU2–3 allele, kindly provided by J. Broach (35Robinson M.K. Van Zyl W.H. Phizicky E.M. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3632-3645Google Scholar). The tpd1::LEU2–3/TPD1 diploids were sporulated and tetrads dissected, resulting in a 2:2 segregation of wild type and temperature-sensitive spore clones as reported (35Robinson M.K. Van Zyl W.H. Phizicky E.M. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3632-3645Google Scholar). Media to culture yeast and bacteria were produced essentially as described by Sherman et al. (36Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986: 177-186Google Scholar). Standard rich media refers to YPD, and high osmolarity media refers to YPD containing 0.9m sodium chloride unless otherwise noted. PTP3 was isolated as a negative regulator of the HOG pathway by selecting for plasmids from a yeast genomic library that suppressed lethality of thesln1Δ strain, IMY101. This strain was transformed with a multicopy yeast genomic library based in the vector YEp13 (37Nasmyth K. Reed S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2119-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) (American Type Culture Collection). Transformants capable of vigorous growth on 5-FOA were identified, and the plasmid DNA was isolated using standard methods. In addition to plasmids bearing PTP2, a different plasmid, pAF12, bearing an ∼8-kb insert was isolated multiple times. Deletion of a SphI fragment or aHindIII fragment from pAF12 identified regions of the insert critical for suppression. Sequencing adjacent to the SphI site identified an open reading frame, Yer075p, sequenced by the genome project. We call this gene PTP3. A strain bearing a deletion of the PTP3 gene was produced by transformation of a wild type diploid, DF5, with a PTP3deletion construct. To produce the ptp3-Δ1::TRP1allele, PCR was used to introduce a BamHI site 275 bp upstream of the start site and a SmaI site 118 bp downstream of the start codon, generating a 400-bp fragment corresponding to the 5′ end of the gene. A fragment corresponding to the 3′ end of the gene was produced using PCR to generate a SmaI site 2644 bp downstream of the start site and a EcoRI site 985 bp downstream of the stop codon. Both fragments were simultaneously ligated into pUC19 digested with BamHI and EcoRI to generate the plasmid pHF1. This plasmid was digested withSmaI, and a 850-bp blunt-endedEcoRI-BglII fragment of TRP1 (38Struhl K. Stinchcomb D.T. Sherer S. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar) was ligated to generate pUC19-ptp3Δ::TRP1. This plasmid was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and transformed into DF5, and Trp+ transformants were selected. Southern analysis identified transformants bearing the deletion allele at thePTP3 locus (39Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1989) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, pp. 2.9.1–2.9.15 and 4.9.1–4.9.14, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York.Google Scholar). Briefly, genomic DNA was digested withXbaI and probed with the 1-kbSmaI-EcoRI fragment corresponding to the 3′ end of the PTP3 gene. A 4-kb fragment corresponding to theptp3Δ::TRP1 allele integrated at the correct locus, and a 5.1-kb fragment corresponding to the wild typePTP3 locus was detected in several transformants. Dissection of ptp3Δ::TRP1/PTP3 heterozygous diploid strains resulted in a 2:2 segregation of Trp+ to Trp−spore clones. PTP2 andPTP3 were mutagenized by PCR-based methods. To produce the mutant allele, PTP2-C666S, where Cys-666 is mutated to Ser, the oligonucleotide, 5′-GGAACCCTGCAGAAGAATGGACTAA-3′, containing the underlined mutation was paired with a second oligonucleotide upstream of this site, 5′-GGCACCTGCAGTTTCTGAAGCATC-3′. To produce PTP2-C666A, where Cys-666 is mutated to Ala, the oligonucleotide, 5′-CACCCTGCAGAAGCATGGACTAAT-3′ containing the underlined mutations was paired with the second oligonucleotide described above. In each case the 707-bp PCR product was digested withPstI at two naturally occurring sites and cloned into pUC19. This mutagenized fragment, when completely sequenced, identified only those mutations introduced by the mutagenic oligonucleotide.PTP2-C666S or PTP2-C666A was expressed in a low copy CEN-based plasmid bearing the TRP1 gene, by substituting the mutagenized PstI fragments for the wild type PstI fragment in the plasmid pHSe (22Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2355-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), generating pPTP2-C666S and pPTP2-C666A. PTP2-C666S and PTP2-C666A were expressed in a high copy 2-μm-based plasmid, also bearing the TRP1gene, by cloning PvuII fragments from these plasmids into YEplac112 (40Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene ( Amst .). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar). To produce the mutant allele PTP2-C670A the mutagenic oligonucleotide, 5′-GGTTCT-GCAGGGGCTGGAAGAACAGG-3′ bearing the underlined mutations and a second oligonucleotide corresponding to a region in the 3′-flanking sequence of the gene, 5′-CCCAAGCTTGATATCGCAAAAATAAAAC-3′, were used to produce a 450-bp PCR product that was ligated together with wild type fragments fromPTP2 into YEplac112. To produce the PTP2-C666A,C670A double mutant, fragments from each mutant were cloned into YEplac112. The catalytic residue, Cys-804, in Ptp3, was mutated to Ala using similar methods. PTP3-C804A was produced by PCR using an oligonucleotide bearing two mutations, 5′-CAAAGTACCAGTCCTTCCACAACCTGCGGAAGCATGAACCAAAATGG-3′, which was paired with a second primer upstream of this site, 5′-GAGACGTATTTGAGTGCAGTC-3′. PCR generated a 1.4-kb PCR product that was digested with XbaI and BsrI at naturally occurring sites and, together with a 647-bpBsrI-PstI from the wild type PTP3gene, cloned into pUC19. The ∼2-kb PstI-XbaI fragment together with a ∼1.5-kb XbaI-EcoRI fragment from the wild type PTP3 gene were simultaneously ligated into YEplac 181, a 2-μm-based plasmid bearing theLEU2 gene (40Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene ( Amst .). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar). Sequencing identified only two mutations corresponding to those introduced by the mutagenic oligonucleotide. Ptp2 and Ptp3 were expressed as fusions to GST using pEG(KT), a 2-μm-based vector bearing the URA3 gene and GST under regulation of the GAL1/10 promoter (41Mitchell D.A. Marshall T.K. Deschenes R.J. Yeast. 1993; 9: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The plasmid pGST-PTP2 was constructed by introducing a BamHI site just upstream of the PTP2 start codon using PCR. The oligonucleotide, 5′-GCGGATCCATGGATCGCATAGC-ACAGC-3′ (start codon underlined) was paired with an oligonucleotide, 5′-GCCGA-TATCCTTAGCATTGG-3′, corresponding to an EcoRV site 320 downstream of the start codon. The fragment produced by PCR was digested with BamHI and EcoRV and, together with wild type PTP2 fragments from the plasmid pHS6.7 (22Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2355-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), cloned into pEG(KT). The plasmid pGST-PTP3 was constructed by introducing a BamHI site just upstream of the start codon using the oligonucleotide 5′-CGGGATCCATGAAGGACAGTGTAGACTGC-3′ (start codon underlined). This oligonucleotide was paired with 5′-GGCATGTTCGGTAAACGGCGGCC-3′, corresponding to a naturally occurringHindIII site 386 bp downstream of the start codon. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and HindIII and, together with fragments from the wild type PTP3 gene obtained from pAF12, cloned into pEG(KT). Mutants PTP2-C666Sand PTP3-C804A were also fused to the carboxyl terminus of GST by similar methods. The plasmid pHOG1-HA, expresses Hog1 tagged at its carboxyl terminus with two repeats of the hemagglutinin epitope (Hog1-HA) under regulation of the CUP1 promoter in the vector YEp181. A HindIII site was engineered upstream of theHOG1 start codon, and a NotI site was substituted at the stop codon to generate the fusion to the HA epitope. A 400-bp BamHI-EcoRI fragment containing theCUP1 promoter was inserted upstream of the start codon. The Hog1-HA fusion protein is functional, since it complements the osmosensitivity of a hog1Δ strain. The phosphatase activity of Ptp2 and Ptp3 was tested as follows. RS334 carrying pGST-PTP2 or pGST-PTP3 was grown in synthetic media lacking uracil and containing 2% galactose. Cells from 250 ml of culture grown to ∼1.0 unit (A 600 nm) were harvested and homogenized by glass beading in lysis buffer, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, with protease inhibitors (leupeptin, pepstatin A, antipain, aprotinin, and chymostatin each at 20 μg/ml), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was centrifuged at high speed for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was incubated with 45 μl of a 1:1 slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 3 × with lysis buffer, followed by 3 washes with lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, and finally 3 × with lysis buffer containing 300 mm NaCl. Two proteins of ∼112 kDa corresponding to GST-Ptp2 and ∼125 kDa corresponding to GST-Ptp3 were found in these preparations as detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-GST antibody (Pharmacia) or by silver staining. These proteins were absent from RS334, which carries pEG(KT), and expresses a ∼25-kDa protein corresponding to GST. The GST-Ptp2, GST-Ptp3, or GST proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were washed in phosphatase buffer, 50 mm imidazole HCl (pH 7.2), and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol and then incubated with phosphatase buffer containing 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP, Sigma) at 30 °C. The hydrolysis of PNPP was monitored at 410 nm. Binding between PTPs and Hog1 was detected as follows. The plasmids pGST-PTP2-C666S, pGST-PTP3-C804A, or pEG(KT) were coexpressed with pHOG1-HA in RS334. Yeast were grown in synthetic media lacking uracil and leucine to select for plasmids and containing 2% galactose and 100 μm copper sulfate. Cells from 100 ml of culture grown to ∼1 unit (A 600 nm) were harvested and lysed by glass beading in lysis buffer. The lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatant was incubated with 45 μl of 1:1 slurry of glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia) and mixed for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively, as described above (see PNPP assay), boiled in sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Hog1-Tyr(P) was detected by immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibody (PY20, ICN), and Hog1-HA was detected with anti-HA antibody (12CA5, Babco). Cells in exponential growth phase were osmotically shocked by the addition of an equal volume of media containing 0.8 m sodium chloride. Cells were harvested and homogenized by glass beading in lysis buffer containing 100 μm sodium orthovanadate and 50 mm β-glycerophosphate. Lysates were boiled in sample buffer, separated in a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) in 20% methanol, 25 mm Tris, 0.2 m glycine, 0.01% SDS, using a Genie transfer apparatus (Idea Scientific). The blot was blocked in TNST, 20 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01% Tween, containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h and incubated with primary antibody (PY20, ICN) at a dilution of 1:1000 in TNST for 1 h. After washing, rabbit anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (Promega) was added at a dilution of 1:7500 in TNST for 30 min. The blot was washed with TNST, and the immunoreactivity was visualized using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium (42Harlow, E., and Lane, D. (eds) (1988) Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, pp. 471-510, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar) (Promega). Yeast grown to ∼1 unit,A 600 nm, in YPD were untreated or osmotically shocked for 10 min by the addition of YPD containing 0.8 mNaCl. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the RNA were prepared by freezing in phenol and SDS (43Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). Total RNA was electrophoresed in formaldehyde-containing agarose gels, and hybridization was performed by standard methods (39Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1989) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, pp. 2.9.1–2.9.15 and 4.9.1–4.9.14, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York.Google Scholar). The blot was hybridized with 32P-labeled probes to PTP2,PTP3, GPD1, and TUB1. A 750-bpPstI fragment internal to the PTP2 open reading frame, a 1-kb ClaI fragment internal to the PTP3open reading frame, a ∼1.1-kb BglII-ClaI fragment from TUB1, and a 814-bp SalI fragment from GPD1, containing 352 bp of the GPD1 open reading frame and 462 bp of upstream sequence, were used to produce32P-labeled probes (39Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K.

Protein phosphatases that negatively regulate theS. cerevisiae HOG pathway were isolated by a genetic approach. A selection was devised using a sln1Δ strain whose severe growth defects are due to constitutive activation of the HOG MAPK cascade (25Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar, 27Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. Science. 1993; 262: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Since this growth defect can be alleviated by mutational inactivation of members of the MAPK cascade, overexpression of negative regulators should also suppress lethality. Such negative regulators should include protein phosphatases that inactivate the MAPK module. To identify such regulators, we used the strain, IMY101, lacking chromosomal copies of both SLN1 andURA3 and carrying both of these genes on a single plasmid, pSLN1-URA3 (27Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. Science. 1993; 262: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Because this strain requires pSLN1-URA3 for viability, it is necessarily Ura+ and therefore unable to grow on media containing 5-FOA, which selects againstURA3-expressing cells. Overexpression of negative regulators should allow survival of the sln1Δ strain in the absence of pSLN1-URA3 and thus growth on 5-FOA. This selection yielded two protein-tyrosine phosphatases, PTP2, and a new gene,PTP3, which, when overexpressed, inactivate the HOG pathway. To begin examining why two protein-tyrosine phosphatases regulate the HOG pathway, the effects of altering the level of expression of PTP2 and PTP3 were examined. Although both PTP2 and PTP3 suppress the severe growth defects of the sln1Δ strain when expressed from a multicopy 2-μm-based plasmid, only PTP2suppressed the growth defect when expressed from a low copy CEN-based plasmid. Thus PTP2 may have a greater effect on the HOG pathway than PTP3. To test whether deletion ofPTP2 would have a greater impact on the HOG pathway than deletion of PTP3, strains lacking either or both PTPs were constructed. No obvious differences were observed betweenptp2Δ, ptp3Δ, ptp2Δ ptp3Δ, and wild type strains grown under standard conditions or in high osmolarity media where the HOG pathway would be activated. Differences were observed between ptp2Δ and ptp3Δ strains, however, when combined with the sln1Δ mutation. Thesln1Δ strain exhibits severe growth defects on synthetic media due to HOG pathway hyperactivation. If the role of these PTPs is to inactivate the HOG pathway, then their deletion should adversely affect the sln1Δ strain. The sln1Δ ptp2Δdouble mutant is lethal on synthetic media, whereas the sln1Δ ptp3Δ strain grows as well as the sln1Δ strain on synthetic media (data not shown). These results suggest that the HOG pathway is more acutely affected by PTP2 than byPTP3. Analysis of the primary sequence of Ptp2 and Ptp3 shows they are similar in structure, having a novel amino-terminal domain fused to a carboxyl-terminal protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domain. The amino-terminal domains of Ptp2 and Ptp3 show two small regions of similarity to each other and to Pyp1 and Pyp2, which regulate an osmotic stress response pathway in S. pombe. One of these regions is also si"

Because of their virtual ubiquity, previous epidemiological studies have not found a correlation between the presence of type 1 fimbriae and urinary tract infections (UTIs). Recently it has become clear that type 1 fimbriae exhibit several different phenotypes, due to allelic variation of the gene for the lectin subunit, FimH, and that these phenotypes are differentially distributed among fecal and UTI isolates. In this study, we have analyzed in more detail the ability of isogenic, recombinant strains ofE. coli expressing fimH genes of the predominant fecal and UTI phenotypes to adhere to glycoproteins and to uroepithelial cells. Evidence was obtained to indicate that type 1 fimbriae differ in their ability to recognize various mannosides, utilizing at least two different mechanisms. All FimH subunits studied to date are capable of mediating adhesion via trimannosyl residues, but only certain variants are capable of mediating high levels of adhesion via monomannosyl residues. The ability of the FimH lectins to interact with monomannosyl residues strongly correlates with their ability to mediate E. coli adhesion to uroepithelial cells. In this way, it would be possible for certain phenotypic variants of type 1 fimbriae to contribute more than others to virulence of E. coli in the urinary tract.

The role of P fimbriae in pyelonephritis is well-established, due in large measure to accumulated epidemiological evidence showing that approximately 70% of E. coli strains from pyelonephritis, but less than 20% of normal intestinal isolates, produce P fimbriae (1Johnson J.R. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 4: 80-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 2Donnenberg M.S. Welch R.A. Mobley H.L.T. Warren J.W. Urinary Tract Infections.

Still, P fimbriae are not required for UTIs, because significant numbers of isolates from asymptomatic bacteriuria, cystitis, and even pyelonephritis do not express P fimbriae (1Johnson J.R. Clin.

A considerable body of evidence from in vitro and animal studies indicates a role for type 1 fimbriae in the virulence ofE. coli in the urinary tract (6Aronson M. Medalia O. Schori L. Mirelman D.

Type 1 fimbriae, the most common adhesive organelles of E. coli, are the prototypical examples of adhesins containing lectins, their adhesive function being inhibited by d-mannose and its derivatives (3Duguid J.P Smith J.W.

Despite relatively abundant evidence, significant controversy exists concerning the role of type 1 fimbriae as a virulence factor because up to 95% of all E. coli isolates, irrespective of origin, express type 1 fimbriae, and epidemiological studies do not show differential distributions of type 1 fimbriatedE. coli between uropathogenic isolates and fecal isolates of healthy individuals (1Johnson J.R. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 4: 80-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 2Donnenberg M.S. Welch R.A. Mobley H.L.T. Warren J.W. Urinary Tract Infections.

Infect. Immun. 1981; 31: 564-570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Type 1 fimbriae are encoded by the fim gene cluster (17Klemm P. Jorgensen B.J. van Die I de Ree H. Bergmans H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 199: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and are composed primarily of the structural subunit, FimA. Small amounts of the adhesin subunit, FimH (18Klemm P. Christensen G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 208: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), are found at intervals along the fimbrial shaft (19Krogfelt K.A Bergmans H. Klemm P. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 1995-1998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and also at the tips (20Hanson M.S. Brinton Jr., C.C. Nature. 1988; 322: 265-268Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It was recently demonstrated that type 1 fimbriae exhibit a remarkable phenotypic variation not previously appreciated (21Sokurenko E.V. Courtney H.S. Abraham S.N. Klemm P. Hasty D.L. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 4709-4719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sokurenko E.V. Courtney H.S. Ohman D.E. Klemm P. Hasty D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 748-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Sokurenko E.V. Courtney H.S. Maslow J. Siitonen A. Hasty D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3680-3686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Allelic variants of thefimH gene confer distinctly different receptor specificities not limited to oligomannose structures previously thought to be the primary receptor (22Sokurenko E.V. Courtney H.S. Ohman D.E. Klemm P. Hasty D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 748-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Sokurenko E.V. Courtney H.S. Maslow J. Siitonen A. Hasty D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3680-3686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adhesion of wild and recombinant strains to three model substrata revealed at least three phenotypic classes of FimH. The M phenotype mediates adhesion only to substrates rich in exposed mannose residues, such as yeast mannan (MN). The MF phenotype mediates adhesion not only to MN, but also to complex-type oligosaccharides, such as in human plasma fibronectin. The MFP phenotype mediates adhesion to MN and fibronectin and also to synthetic peptides completely devoid of saccharide moieties (22Sokurenko E.V. Courtney H.S. Ohman D.E. Klemm P. Hasty D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 748-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This functional diversity was not considered in the previous epidemiological studies. Further studies of the predominant M phenotype surprisingly revealed that adhesion to MN could vary by up to 10-fold or more among E. coli isolates, even though the morphologies of their fimbriae were indistinguishable (23Sokurenko E.V. Courtney H.S. Maslow J. Siitonen A. Hasty D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3680-3686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, no effective substratum was found in this previous study for the low MN-adhesive FimH phenotype predominant among fecal strains. The potential relevance of the variations in the magnitude of MN adhesion to UTIs was highlighted by the finding that type 1 fimbriated E. coli isolates obtained from UTIs exhibited an average of a 3-fold greater ability to adhere to immobilized MN than type 1 fimbriated E. coli isolated from the feces of healthy individuals (23Sokurenko E.V. Courtney H.S. Maslow J. Siitonen A. Hasty D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3680-3686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ninety percent of UTI strains adhered at levels above the median level of adhesion for fecal strains (23Sokurenko E.V. Courtney H.S. Maslow J. Siitonen A. Hasty D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3680-3686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to characterize the underlying molecular basis for the apparent difference in the magnitude of adhesion to MN between urinary and fecal isolates. We will show that a recombinant strain expressing FimH derived from a urinary isolate and exhibiting 10-fold greater MN adhesion than an isogenic strain expressing FimH from a fecal isolate recognizes a distinct type of oligomannoside. This difference in receptor specificity could provide a basis for differential abilities of certain strains of E. coli to target uroepithelial cells and, thereby, explain the predominance of the high MN-adhesive phenotype among UTI strains. Salivary mucin was purified from whole human saliva, as described previously (24Courtney H.S. Hasty D.L. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1661-1666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monomannosylated BSA (ManBSA) was obtained from EY Laboratories, Inc. (San Mateo, CA). α1–3, α1–6-d-mannotriose-BSA ((Man)3BSA) was obtained from V-Labs, Inc. (Covington, LA). Human laminin was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Purified Tamm-Horsfall protein was generously provided by Dr. I. Ofek (Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Most of the recombinant strains utilized here were constructed using a Δfim K-12 derivative constructed by Blomfield et al. (25Blomfield I.C. McClain M.S. Eisenstein B.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1439-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and were described previously (23Sokurenko E.V. Courtney H.S. Maslow J. Siitonen A. Hasty D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3680-3686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the fim gene cluster was deleted from E. coli MG1655 to create AAEC191A (25Blomfield I.C. McClain M.S. Eisenstein B.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1439-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). AAEC191A was transformed with the recombinant plasmid pPKL114 to create strain KB18. Plasmid pPKL114 is a pBR322 derivative containing the entire fim gene cluster from the E. coli K-12 strain, PC31, but with a translational stop-linker inserted into the unique KpnI site of the fimH gene. Strain KB18 cells express no fimbriae or very few numbers of long, nonadhesive fimbriae. For the studies reported here, strain KB18 was co-transformed with a series of isogenic pGB2-24-based plasmids. Plasmid pGB2-24 is a previously constructed pACYC184 derivative that is convenient for expression of fimH genes polymerase chain reaction-cloned from different E. coli (22Sokurenko E.V. Courtney H.S. Ohman D.E. Klemm P. Hasty D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 748-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant strains created using these plasmids express large numbers of fully functional, type 1 fimbriae (22Sokurenko E.V. Courtney H.S. Ohman D.E. Klemm P. Hasty D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 748-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Sokurenko E.V. Courtney H.S. Maslow J. Siitonen A. Hasty D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3680-3686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In most of the experiments, we employed a recombinant strain, KB91 (KB18(pGB17)), expressing thefimH F-18 gene and an isogenic strain, KB54 (KB18(pGB6)), expressing the fimH CI12 gene.E. coli F-18 is a normal intestinal isolate (26Cohen P. Laux D. Klemm P. Fimbriae: Adhesion, Genetics, Biogenesis and Vaccines. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994: 213-225Google Scholar), andE. coli CI12 is a UTI isolate (22Sokurenko E.V. Courtney H.S. Ohman D.E. Klemm P. Hasty D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 748-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Sokurenko E.V. Courtney H.S. Maslow J. Siitonen A. Hasty D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3680-3686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Five other isogenic recombinant strains (KB21, KB23, KB59, KB92, and KB96) differed from KB91 and KB54 only in the allelic variant of the fimH gene that was present on the pGB2-24-based plasmid. The abilities of these recombinant strains to adhere to MN were variable and corresponded to the wild strain phenotypes. The phenotypes and deduced amino acid sequences of each of these FimH subunits were described previously (23Sokurenko E.V. Courtney H.S. Maslow J. Siitonen A. Hasty D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3680-3686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another set of strains was based on a FimH− derivative ofE. coli F-18 (27; gift of Dr. P. Cohen). E. coliF-18 FimH− was transformed with plasmid pGB6 (harboringfimH CI12) to create strain KBF109 or with plasmid pGB17 (harboring fimH F-18) to create strain KBF110. Assays of bacterial adhesion to glycoproteins bound to 96-well plates or to epithelial cells in 8-well tissue culture chamber slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL) were carried out as described previously (22Sokurenko E.V. Courtney H.S. Ohman D.E. Klemm P. Hasty D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 748-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Sokurenko E.V. Courtney H.S. Maslow J. Siitonen A. Hasty D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3680-3686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sokurenko E.V. McMackin V. Hasty D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 253: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, glycoproteins were dissolved at 20 μg/ml in 0.02 m bicarbonate buffer, and 100-μl aliquots were incubated in microtiter wells for 1 h at 37 °C. The wells were then washed three times with PBS and quenched with 0.1% BSA in PBS. Bacteria were added in 0.1% BSA in PBS and incubated for 40 min at 37 °C without shaking to achieve saturation, and the wells were then washed with PBS. The number of bound bacteria was determined by a growth assay (28Sokurenko E.V. McMackin V. Hasty D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 253: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) or by using [3H]thymidine-labeled bacteria, as described previously (23Sokurenko E.V. Courtney H.S. Maslow J. Siitonen A. Hasty D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3680-3686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The density of bacteria used in all assays was 5 × 107 colony-forming units per 100 μl except for the equilibrium binding experiments where 12 to 16 serial dilutions of bacteria covering the densities 2.3 × 105 to 8 × 108 colony-forming units per 100 μl were utilized. Equilibrium measurements and other comparative studies were performed in parallel experiments. Adhesion to epithelial cells was determined as described previously, enumerating bound bacteria by light microscopic examination of stained samples (23Sokurenko E.V. Courtney H.S. Maslow J. Siitonen A. Hasty D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3680-3686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Suspensions of bacteria in PBS were adsorbed to Formvar-coated grids for 2 min, followed by staining on drops of 0.5% phosphotungstic acid (pH 4) for 2 min. After drying, bacteria were examined using a JEOL1200EX electron microscope. Correlation coefficient, r, was calculated using Cricket Graph (Cricket Software, Philadelphia, PA), where applicable. The significance of r was determined according to Fisher. We found a highly significant, direct correlation between the magnitude of adhesion to MN and the level of adhesion to either J82 human bladder epithelial cells (Fig. 1;r = 0.97, p > 0.995) or A498 human kidney epithelial cells (r = 0.93, p > 0.995; data not presented in figure) using 7 isogenic recombinant strains expressing subunits encoded by fimH genes derived from various E. coli strains. The results suggest that the differences in the magnitude of adhesion among the FimH-expressing recombinants are not restricted to immobilized MN and thus may represent fundamental differences in the fine sugar specificity of the allelic variants of FimH. To examine this possibility, the adhesion of two strains, KB91 and KB54, was studied in more detail. Strain KB91 represents the low MN-adhesive phenotype typical of normal intestinal isolates, whereas strain KB54 represents the high MN-adhesive phenotype typical of UTI isolates (23Sokurenko E.V. Courtney H.S. Maslow J. Siitonen A. Hasty D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3680-3686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The adhesion of strains KB91 and KB54 to MN-coated wells was analyzed by equilibrium measurements. Scatchard plot analyses showed that at saturation, KB54 could utilize a maximum of 22.5 × 106 combining sites per well with a K a ∼5.0 × 10−5and 4.4 × 106 combining sites with aK a ∼6.1 × 10−6 (Fig.2). The analyses also revealed that the FimH of KB91 mediated adhesion through two apparent combining sites. There were approximately 4.1 × 106 low affinity combining sites per well for KB91, with a K a ∼7.1 × 10−5. Adhesion to one type of site exhibited a relatively high affinity (K a ∼1.1 × 10−7), but the number of such sites was limited to approximately 1.0 × 106 per well. Detection of a relatively high affinity site for strain KB91 on the MN substratum prompted us to compare the patterns of the adhesion of strains KB91 and KB54 to a variety of immobilized glycoproteins (Fig. 3). As expected, neither of these M phenotype strains bound to the glycoproteins exhibiting exclusively complex type N-linked glycans that have no terminally exposed mannosyl residues orO-linked glycans that have no mannose: human serum apotransferrin, human α-acid glycoprotein, and bovine milk casein. Strain KB54 adhered in large numbers to each of the other glycoproteins that are known to possess at least a certain fraction of either hybrid or high mannose type oligosaccharide moieties, both of which have terminal mannose residues. In contrast, the adhesion of strain KB91 to these substrata varied dramatically. Adhesion to one group of glycoproteins (Tamm-Horsfall protein, human amylase, salivary mucin, intestinal mucin, and mouse IgAλ) exhibited a clear MN-like pattern, in that KB91 adhered at a much lower level than did KB54. Adhesion of KB91 to a second group of glycoproteins (porcine thyroglobulin, chicken egg albumin, human laminin, horseradish peroxidase, and mouse IgAκ) was increased, but still much below adhesion of KB54. Adhesion of strain KB91 to a third group of glycoproteins (bovine lactoferrin, human secretory IgA, and bovine RNase B) was roughly equal to that of KB54, in distinct contrast to the MN-like pattern. Because of the high level of binding of strain KB91 and because the structure of its high mannose type oligosaccharide moiety is simpler, more well-defined, and more homogeneous than those of the other glycoproteins tested (29Fu D. Chen L. O'Neill R.A. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 261: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), bovine RNase B (bRB) was used as a model substratum in equilibrium binding experiments to compare with MN. The numbers and affinities of the combining sites utilized by the two strains were similar, with approximately 15 × 106 sites per well and aK a ∼5 × 10−6 (Fig.4). Because equilibrium measurements showed that the parameters of adhesion of strains KB91 and KB54 to MN differed while parameters of adhesion to bRB were similar, it would appear that different mechanisms of ligand-receptor interaction were involved. Although the binding of both KB91 and KB54 recombinant strains to both receptors was mannose-sensitive, the concentrations of methyl α-d-mannopyranoside (αMM) required to inhibit adhesion by 50% (i.e. the IC50) differed dramatically. The IC50 for binding of strain KB54 to bRB was 45-fold higher than the IC50 for its adhesion to MN (Fig.5). Interestingly, the adhesion of strain KB91 to bRB was 2.5-fold less sensitive to inhibition than was the adhesion of KB54. Due to the low level of adhesion of strain KB91 to MN, the measurement of an IC50 for αMM was not reliable. When the abilities of d-mannose and three aromatic α-glycosides of mannose (i.e. octyl-, phenyl-, and nitrophenyl-mannopyranoside) to inhibit adhesion of strains KB91 and KB54 were compared, a pattern comparable with that with αMM was found: the adhesion of KB54 to bRB was dramatically less sensitive to inhibition than was adhesion to MN, and the adhesion of strain KB91 to bRB was significantly less sensitive to inhibition than was the binding of strain KB54 (data not shown). Further study of FimH binding mechanisms was performed utilizing monomannoside and trimannoside coupled to BSA (ManBSA and (Man)3BSA, respectively) as receptor substrata (Fig.6). These correlative studies were performed using KB54, KB91, and the five other recombinant strains used above. KB54 bound to immobilized ManBSA in 12-fold greater numbers than did strain KB91, and a strong positive correlation was found between the ability of all seven recombinant strains to bind to ManBSA and their ability to bind to MN (Fig. 6 A; r = 0.98, p> 0.995). All of the strains adhered relatively well to the (Man)3BSA substratum, and there was a strong positive correlation between their abilities to bind to (Man)3BSA and to bRB (Fig. 6 B; r = 0.77,p > 0.95). There was no positive correlation between either the ability of the strains to bind to (Man)3BSA and MN (r = 0.0) or between the ability of strains to bind to ManBSA and bRB (r = −0.3). Interestingly, while the levels of adhesion of strain KB54 to ManBSA and (Man)3BSA substrata were quantitatively similar, the αMM IC50 for the adhesion to ManBSA was approximately 50-fold less than the αMM IC50 for adhesion to (Man)3BSA, similar to the differential inhibition observed for adhesion to MN and bRB (see Fig. 5). Binding of strain KB91 to (Man)3BSA was approximately 2-fold less sensitive to inhibition by αMM than was the adhesion of KB54. Thus, regarding the levels of both adhesion and sensitivity to αMM inhibition, the reactions of E. coli with MN and ManBSA were similar, and the reactions of E. coli with bRB and (Man)3BSA were similar. These observations are consistent with the foregoing results suggesting that high MN-adhesive subunits, but not low MN-adhesive subunits, are able to mediate adhesion effectively via individual mannose residues terminally exposed in high mannose-type or hybrid-type oligosaccharide structures. At the same time, all FimH subunits are capable of mediating strong adhesion via interaction with unsubstituted trimannosyl groups. Our observations in previous publications have indicated that the MS-adhesive phenotype of the two-plasmid recombinant strains used here corresponded to the MS-adhesive phenotype of wild strains and is dependent on thefimH allele (23Sokurenko E.V. Courtney H.S. Maslow J. Siitonen A. Hasty D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3680-3686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the differential pattern of binding via terminal mono- and trimannoside structures described above would be seen in the MS phenotypes of wild strains, we tested the adhesion of F-18 and CI12, the fimH genes of which were used to construct E. coli KB91 and KB54, to MN, bRB, ManBSA, and (Man)3BSA (Fig. 7). The differential binding pattern observed for wild-type strains corresponded to that seen with the recombinant strains. To determine whether the MS-adhesive phenotype of the wild strains is also determined by the fimH allele, we tested the binding of a FimH− derivative of E. coli F-18. This strain did not bind to any of the tested substrates (Fig. 7). However, when this strain was transformed with plasmids containingfimH F-18 or fimH CI12genes, creating KBF110 and KBF109, respectively, the transformants adhered in the same pattern as did the corresponding wild strains (Fig.7). These observations reinforce the concept that MS-adhesive phenotype is dependent primarily on the fimH allele and not the host background strain. Electron microscopic examination demonstrated that the FimH− derivative of F-18 expressed few numbers of fimbriae per cell, essentially the same as the K-12 derivative, KB18. ThefimH transformants KBF109 and KBF110, however, expressed large numbers of fimbriae typical of type 1-fimbriated wild strains and with essentially identical morphology (Fig. 8). To determine whether adhesion to human uroepithelial cells corresponds more closely to the monomannoside-type binding (MN- and ManBSA-like) or the trimannoside-type binding (bRB- and (Man)3BSA-like), a quantitative comparison was performed using all seven recombinant strains. There was a significant correlation (r = 0.98,p > 0.995) between the level of bacterial adhesion to J82 human bladder epithelial cells and the ability to bind to monomannosyl receptors (Fig. 9 A). Results were similar when adhesion to A498 human kidney epithelial cells was tested (r = 1.0, p > 0.995). In contrast, there was no correlation (r = 0.05–0.08) between the adhesion of the recombinant strains to epithelial cells and their ability to bind to trimannosyl receptor structures (Fig.9 B). Although data can be found in the literature that point toward the phenotypic diversity of type 1 fimbriae (e.g. Refs. 30Ofek I. Goldhar J. Eshdat Y. Sharon N. Scand. J. Infect. Dis. Suppl. 1982; 33: 61-67PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hultgren S.J. Schwan W.R. Schaeffer A.J. Duncan J.L. Infect. Immun. 1986; 54: 613-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Sherman P.M. Houston W.L. Boedeker E.C. Infect. Immun. 1985; 49: 797-804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), very little, if any, attention was previously given to this phenomenon until recently (21Sokurenko E.V. Courtney H.S. Abraham S.N. Klemm P. Hasty D.L. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 4709-4719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sokurenko E.V. Courtney H.S. Ohman D.E. Klemm P. Hasty D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 748-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Sokurenko E.V. Courtney H.S. Maslow J. Siitonen A. Hasty D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3680-3686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous publication, we reported that different alleles of the lectin-like subunit, FimH, mediate very different levels of adhesion of type 1 fimbriated strains to MN. We showed previously that the 10-fold differences in adhesion that were observed were not explained by different levels of incorporation of different FimH proteins into the fimbrial structure, but by differences in the FimH structure. Interestingly, the low MN-adhesive phenotype predominated among fecal strains. It was not clear why such a large fraction of the population of normal E. coli should express FimH subunits that appeared to be relatively ineffective adhesins. Here, we identify an effective substratum for the low MN-adhesive phenotype and provide a possible mechanism to explain the quantitative differences that were observed previously. Based on the data presented here and discussed in more detail below, it can be proposed: 1) that allelic variants of the FimH lectin ofE. coli type 1 fimbriae are not all alike in their ability to recognize terminal mannose structures and exhibit at least two distinct mechanisms of ligand-receptor interaction; 2) that all FimH subunits studied to date are capable of mediating adhesion via trimannosyl residues, but only certain variants are capable of mediating adhesion via monomannosyl residues; and 3) that the ability of the FimH lectins to interact with monomannosyl residues strongly correlates with their ability to mediate E. coli adhesion to uroepithelial cells. Whether these phenotypic differences result in differences in tissue tropism in a human or animal host remains to be determined. The hypothesis that different receptor specificities are responsible for the apparent magnitude of adhesion to MN was prompted by equilibrium binding measurements of adhesion of strains KB91 and KB54 to MN. Scatchard plot analyses of bacterial adhesion data can provide important information regarding receptor specificity, giving an indication of both affinity and the heterogeneity of binding sites (33Doyle R.J. Oakley J.D. Murphy K.R. McAlister D. Taylor K.G. Mergenhagen S. Rosan B. Molecular Basis of Oral Microbial Adhesion. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1985: 109-113Google Scholar). Scatchard plot analyses indicated the possibility that strain KB91 reacts relatively weakly with the high affinity MN receptors recognized by strain KB54 and either does not react or reacts at undetectable levels with the low affinity MN sites of strain KB54. However, a number of high affinity binding sites for strain KB91 in MN were detected, indicating the ability of this FimH adhesin to interact strongly with certain receptor structures which were exposed poorly in immobilized MN. Indeed, while KB91 exhibited low levels of adhesion to MN, it adhered avidly to several glycoprotein substrata, with IgA, lactoferrin, and bRB being the most prominent of those tested thus far. The equilibrium analyses of adhesion to bRB indicated that the FimH lectins of both strains probably interact with the same structural element on the bRB-coated surface and with the same effectiveness. Thus, it is likely that separate mechanisms of ligand-receptor interactions are responsible for the differential adhesion of these two strains to MN and bRB. Inhibition of ligand-receptor interactions by receptor analogs is an important adjunct to direct adhesion studies. The more effective inhibition of bacterial adhesion to MN by soluble monomannosides than adhesion to bRB prompts us to suggest that the mechanism of adhesion to MN is primarily via interaction with single terminal mannose residues, whereas adhesion to bRB involves a more complex interaction with multiple mannose residues. Indeed, strain KB54 was able to adhere much better than strain KB91 to ManBSA, whereas both strains adhered well to (Man)3BSA. Interestingly, although the N-linked carbohydrate moieties of both MN and bRB do provide terminal mannosyl residues, terminal mannotriose structures are abundant in the Man5 and Man6 oligomannose units which constitute almost 90% of bRB oligosaccharide units, but not in the mannoproteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (34Ballou C.E. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1976; 14: 93-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Also, it is known that human IgAs contain hybrid-type oligosaccharides which have terminal mannotriose structures (35Wold A.E. Mestecky J. Tomana M. Kobata A. Ohbayashi H. Endo T. Svanborg-Edén C. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3073-3077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas ovalbumin contains a mixture of oligomannose, hybrid, and multiantennary complexN-linked glycans. Whether other oligomannose structures would provide increased or decreased levels of adhesion in comparison to the trimannoside remains to be determined. It has been proposed previously that the combining site of the type 1 fimbrial lectin is in the form of a complex, trisaccharide-sized pocket that has three adjacent subsites, each of which accommodates one residue of the trisaccharide (36Sharon N. FEBS Lett. 1987; 217: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Many previous studies of the fine sugar specificity of type 1 fimbriae called attention to oligomannose structures as the primary, if not exclusive, receptors. However, the precise nature of the ligand-receptor interactions was not fully developed (14Firon N. Ashkenazi S. Mirelman D. Ofek I. Sharon N. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 472-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Neeser J.-R. Koellreutter B. Wuersch P. Infect. Immun. 1986; 52: 428-436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is now reasonable to speculate that the strong binding of KB91 and KB54 FimH subunits to trimannosyl structures occurs via the interaction of the subsites of the combining pockets of both adhesins with multiple mannosyl residues. The ability of KB54 subunits to mediate adhesion to monomannosides could be due to the ability of a single subsite to react with sufficient affinity to accomplish adhesion. The requirement of the KB91 FimH for trimannose units could be because none of the subsites has a structure that allows high affinity interaction with a single mannosyl residue. The hypothesis that FimH can mediate adhesion via binding to monomannoside residues is quite novel for type 1 fimbriae and could have significant physiological implications. Neither MN nor bRB are likely to be important receptors for E. coli on host mucosal surfaces. However, their use as model substrata helped to identify two mechanisms of interaction of the FimH lectins which could help to dissect the mechanism of binding to physiologically relevant glycoproteins (e.g. salivary and intestinal mucins (37Moshier A. Reddy M.S. Scannapieco F.A. Curr. Microbiol. 1996; 33: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), IgA (35Wold A.E. Mestecky J. Tomana M. Kobata A. Ohbayashi H. Endo T. Svanborg-Edén C. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3073-3077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), lactoferrin (38Teraguchi S. Shin K. Fukuwatari Y. Shimamura S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1075-1077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), uroplakins (39Wu X.-R. Sun T.-T. Medina J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9630-9635Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), leukocyte integrins (40Gbarah A. Gahmberg C.G. Ofek I. Jacobi U. Sharon N. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 4524-4530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), etc.). The divergent mechanisms of interaction of FimH with terminal mannosyl residues described here imply that FimH subunits recognizing monomannoside residues, as represented by the KB54 FimH, should mediate a broader spectrum of bacterial adhesion than FimH subunits recognizing only trimannoside residues, as represented by the KB91 FimH. The stricter selectivity of the trimannose-specific FimH subunits may allow targeting of the strains to surfaces that are physiologically important for normal intestinal E. coli and may help to avoid or reduce the impact of nonspecific host defense barriers, such as lectino-phagocytosis (41Ofek I. Sharon N. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 539-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reduced sensitivity of the trimannose-specific FimH subunits to the inhibition by soluble compounds containing exposed mannose could be another advantage of this phenotype. Thus, the trimannose-specific phenotype could provide more efficient adhesion for E. coli cells in an environment where mucosal surfaces are bathed with mannose-rich glycoproteins. On the other hand, strains bearing the monomannose-specific FimH subunits may have an increased chance to find a substratum containing an acceptable mannosylated compound. Such an expanded receptor specificity for the monomannose-specific FimH might provide a selective advantage for type 1-fimbriated E. coli in the colonization of certain ecological niches (42Bloch C.A. Stocker B.A.D. Orndorff P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and, for example, may be of great importance in the contribution these organelles make to the virulence of E. coli in the urinary tract (12Connell H. Agace W. Klemm P. Schembri M. Mårild S. Svanborg C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9827-9832Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Although the exact structure of the oligosaccharides exposed on the uroepithelial surface is not yet defined (38Teraguchi S. Shin K. Fukuwatari Y. Shimamura S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1075-1077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the strong correlation between the ability to bind to ManBSA and the ability to bind to uroepithelial cells among the FimH-expressing strains suggests that bacterial attachment is accomplished primarily via the monomannoside binding mechanism. Thus, the enhanced ability to bind to uroepithelial cells may explain why UTI isolates express predominantly fimbriae bearing monomannose-specific FimH. It is not yet clear precisely how uropathogenic E. coliorchestrate the contributions of type 1 fimbriae and other virulence factors in the complex process that results in cystitis or pyelonephritis. The observations reported here strongly suggest that some phenotypic variants of FimH contribute much more to UTI than do others by increasing the ability of E. coli to adhere better to uroepithelial cells. It may be of interest in this regard to consider the recent observations reported by Connell et al.(12Connell H. Agace W. Klemm P. Schembri M. Mårild S. Svanborg C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9827-9832Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Clonally related uropathogenic strains of E. coliO1:K1:H7 were tested for virulence in a mouse UTI model. The strains expressed type 1 and P fimbriae and were shown to be members of the same clone by serotyping and by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. However, they were recovered in dramatically different numbers from kidneys and bladders after experimental UTI in mice. We have recently found that the more highly virulent strain recovered from kidneys and bladders in high numbers expresses monomannose-specific FimH, while the strain exhibiting relatively low virulence and recovered from kidneys and bladders in much lower numbers expressed trimannose-specific FimH. 2E.

Tissue from young (3-4 months) ad libitum-fed, old (30-32 months) restricted (35% and 50% CR, designated CR35 and CR50, respectively), and old ad libitum-fed rats (29 months) was studied. CR preserved fiber number and fiber type composition in the vastus lateralis muscle of the CR50 rats. In the old rats from all groups, individual fibers were found with either no detectable cytochrome c oxidase activity (COX-), hyperreactivity for succinate dehydrogenase activity (SDH++; also known as ragged red fibers [RRF]), or both COX- and SDH++. Muscle from the CR50 rats contained significantly fewer COX- and SDH++ fibers than did the muscle from CR35 rats. CR50 rats also had significantly lower numbers of mtDNA deletion products in two (adductor longus and soleus) of the four muscles examined compared to CR35 rats. These data indicate that CR begun in late middle age can retard age-associated fiber loss and fiber type changes, as well as increases in the number of skeletal muscle fibers showing mitochondrial enzyme abnormalities. CR also decreased the accumulation of mtDNA deletions."

Peptides from the third intracellular loop (i3) of the M2-muscarinic receptor (MR) (His208–Arg387), M3-MR (Gly308–Leu497), or α2A/D-adrenergic receptor (AR) (Lys224–Phe374) were generated in bacteria as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, bound to glutathione-Sepharose and used as affinity matrices to detect interacting proteins in fractionated bovine brain cytosol.

Subsequent binding site localization studies indicated that the interaction of β-arrestin with the M3-MR peptide required both the amino (Gly308–Leu368) and carboxyl portions (Lys425–Leu497) of the receptor subdomain.

G-protein-coupled receptors possess a characteristic seven segments of hydrophobic amino acids that likely serve as membrane spans to form a core motif important for ligand recognition. The interaction of agonist with the receptor initiates an ill-defined conformational adjustment in this core motif, which is propagated to intracellular domains of the receptor resulting in the activation of G-protein and the initiation of intracellular signaling events. For most members of the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors, the third intracellular (i3) 1The abbreviations used are: i3, third intracellular loop; MR, muscarinic receptor; AR, adrenergic receptor; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. loop and the carboxyl-terminal tail of the receptor are key sites for signal initiation and termination, and these receptor domains also exhibit the greatest variability in size among different subfamilies of these receptors. The largest i3 domains (100–240 amino acids) are found in receptors coupled to the Gi, Go, and/or Gq family of G-proteins (i.e. muscarinic, α-adrenergic), whereas shorter i3 loops are found in the photoreceptor rhodopsin or β-adrenergic receptors (20–50 amino acids). During the process of signal initiation and termination, several proteins interact with the receptor. The interaction of arrestins with G-protein-coupled receptors is a key component of signal termination (1Sterne-Marr R. Benovic J.L. Vitam.

In vertebrates, visual arrestin interacts with phosphorylated rhodopsin in rod cells to terminate signal propagation by interfering with receptor coupling to transducin. β-Arrestin and arrestin-3 are widely expressed and parallel the role of visual arrestin in terms of signal termination for G-protein-coupled receptors other than rhodopsin. The affinity of arrestin binding to G-protein-coupled receptors is increased by receptor phosphorylation and/or activation by agonist. Receptors of this class are phosphorylated to varying degrees by protein kinase A and C as well as kinases specific for the activated conformation of the receptor (G-protein-coupled receptor kinases). The phosphorylation of the receptor by G-protein-coupled receptor kinases and subsequent arrestin binding are intimately associated with receptor desensitization and sequestration (12Ferguson S.S.G.

Resensitization of the receptor protein involves dissociation of bound arrestin and receptor dephosphorylation. The interaction of receptors with G-proteins, protein kinases, arrestins, and additional entities controlling receptor trafficking apparently involves discrete motifs in cytoplasmic domains of the receptor. The associations of these proteins with the receptor likely occur within a signal transduction complex that may also include various effector molecules and other proteins that influence signaling specificity/efficiency. To define receptor subdomains important for protein interactions and to begin to identify the components of a signal transduction complex for G-protein-coupled receptor subtypes, we generated peptides from the i3 loop of the M2-muscarinic receptor (MR), M3-MR and α2A/D-adrenergic receptor (AR) to use as probes to detect interacting proteins in bovine brain cytosol. In the present report, we determined the interaction of the i3 loop with cytosolic proteins involved in receptor regulation.

The supernatant from the 40% ammonium sulfate precipitate was brought to 90% ammonium sulfate to precipitate additional proteins and subsequently processed as described for the 40% ammonium sulfate precipitate. The dialyzed solutions were clarified by centrifugation and applied to an anion-exchange resin (DEAE-Biogel A) equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with buffer B and proteins eluted sequentially with buffer B containing 100, 250, and 500 mm NaCl. Eluted proteins were desalted by dialysis, concentrated by lyophilization, and stored at −70 °C. The M3-MR i3 construct was obtained from Dr. Barry Wolfe (Department of Pharmacology, Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington, DC) and encoded the peptide Gly308–Leu497. The M2-MR and α2A/D-AR i3 constructs were generated from the cDNA or genomic clones by amplification using the polymerase chain reaction. The M2-MR subdomain was inserted into the EcoRI restriction site of the pGEX-2T vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Using primers containing appropriate restriction sites, the rat α2A/D-AR gene (16Lanier S.M. Downing S. Duzic E. Homcy C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10470-10478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) segment encoding the peptide Lys224–Phe374 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the BamHI andEcoRI restriction sites of pGEX-2T. The M3-II and M3-III were generated from M3-MR i3 construct (M3-I, Gly308–Leu497) by taking advantage of a PstI restriction site (nucleotide 1918 of the rat M3 muscarinic receptor coding region). The M3-II construct was generated by excising theBamHI/PstI fragment from the M3-I construct with subsequent subcloning of this fragment into pGEX-3X at the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites via use of an adaptor. The M3-III construct was generated using a similar strategy with the PstI/EcoRI fragment isolated from the M3-I construct. The M3-IV construct was prepared by digesting the M3-I construct withHindIII removing the gene segment encoding amino acids Lys369–Thr424. The purified plasmid containing the amino- and carboxyl-terminal segments was then religated to yield M3-IV. The structure of each construct used in the present study was verified by restriction mapping and nucleotide sequence analysis. The fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified using a glutathione affinity matrix according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immobilized fusion proteins were either used immediately or stored at 4 °C for no longer than 3 days. Each batch of fusion protein used in experiments was first analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Brain cytosol (1–200 μg) fractions were incubated with ∼5 μg of GST fusion protein bound to the glutathione resin in 250 μl of buffer C (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 70 mm NaCl) for 2.5 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed three times with 0.5 ml of buffer C, and the retained proteins were solubilized and applied to a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel. Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane transfers were evaluated by immunoblotting as described previously (17Sato M. Kataoka R. Dingus J. Wilcox M. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15269-15276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) using specific antibodies. The interactions of purified arrestins with the i3 peptides was determined in a similar manner. Arrestin binding to the M2-MR and M3-MR peptides was also evaluated by direct binding assays using tritiated arrestins generated by in vitro translation. Aliquots (∼2.5 μg) of GST fusion proteins bound to a glutathione resin were incubated with [3H]β-arrestin (long splice variant) (1062–1600 dpm/fmol), [3H]arrestin-3 (short splice variant) (1500 dpm/fmol), [3H]visual arrestin (1300–1871 dpm/fmol), or the [3H]β-arrestin/visual arrestin chimeras BBBA (1990 dpm/fmol) and AABB (2010 dpm/fmol) in a total volume of 20 μl of buffer C for 2.5 h at 4 °C with shaking. The resin was washed three times with 100 μl of buffer C. The washed resin was resuspended in 300 μl of buffer C, mixed with 10 ml of Ecoscint A scintillation fluid, and the retained radioactivity quantitated by scintillation spectrometry at ∼50% efficiency. Nonspecific binding was defined as the amount of ligand retained in parallel experiments using a control GST resin and represented ∼30% of total binding at a concentration of 0.75 nm arrestin. The third intracellular loop of the M2-MR, M3-MR, and the α2A/D-AR consists of 180 (His208–Arg387), 238 (Arg253–Gln490), and 157 (Arg218–Phe374) amino acids, respectively. The putative first and second intracellular loops of the three receptors are similar in size ∼11–12 amino acids, 1st loop; ∼18–19 amino acids, 2nd loop) and the carboxyl-terminal tails of the M2-MR, M3-MR, and α2A/D-AR are 23, 44, and 20 amino acids in length, respectively. As an initial attempt to define proteins that may interact with the intracellular domains of these G-protein-coupled receptors, we focused on the i3 loop as it is the largest intracellular domain in this receptor group. The juxtamembrane segments of the i3 domain are of critical importance for receptor coupling to G-protein, whereas other segments participate in receptor phosphorylation, receptor trafficking, and other aspects of signal propagation. The M2-MR (His208–Arg387), M3-MR (Gly308–Leu497), and α2A/D-AR (Lys224–Phe374) i3 peptides were expressed in bacteria as a GST fusion protein and used to generate an affinity matrix by saturating a glutathione-Sepharose resin with the fusion protein (Fig. 1). The M2-MR peptide corresponded to the entire i3 loop of the receptor. The M3-MR i3 peptide began 45 amino acids downstream of the amino terminus of the i3 loop and terminated seven amino acids into the VI membrane span. The α2A/D-AR peptide began six amino acids downstream of the amino terminus of the i3 loop and terminated at the beginning of the VI membrane span. To determine the interaction of these receptor-derived peptides with cytosolic proteins, we first fractionated bovine brain cytosol to enrich for potential interacting proteins.Figure 1Generation of receptor subdomain probes.Peptides corresponding to segments of the third intracellular loop of the human M2-MR (180 amino acids), rat M3-MR (190 amino acids), and rat α2A/D-AR (151 amino acids) (A) were generated as GST fusion proteins in bacteria and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures”. InA, the black segments correspond to the putative fifth and sixth membrane spans of the receptor. B, the purified fusion proteins were electrophoresed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels (10%) and visualized by Coomassie Blue stain of the proteins. The calculated molecular weights of GST and the M2-MR, M3-MR, and α2A/D-AR GST fusion proteins were 28,146, 47,864, 49,796, and 43,343, respectively, including adapter amino acids. The arrows indicate the migration of GST and each of the GST fusion proteins. Thenumbers to the left of the gel indicate the migration of standards of known molecular weight × 10−3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the first series of experiments, we determined the interaction of receptor subdomains with brain arrestins. Bovine brain cytosol was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation and ion exchange chromatography and the fractions enriched for arrestins were determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 A, left panel). The cytosol fraction enriched for arrestin was incubated with the M2-MR, M3-MR or the α2A/D-AR i3 subdomains as well as the control GST affinity matrix and arrestins retained by the matrices were determined by immunoblotting. Brain arrestins were adsorbed by the M3-MR affinity matrix but did not interact with matrices constructed of the GST control peptide or the i3 peptides derived from the M2-MR or the α2A/D-AR (Fig.2 A, right panel). The amount of arrestin retained by the M3-MR matrix was directly related to the amount of cytosol present during incubation (Fig. 2 B). Brain arrestins were not retained by GST fusion proteins containing subdomains of the tyrosine phosphatase Syp (Src homology 2 domains, 215 amino acids), the Na+/H+ exchanger (carboxyl terminus, 178 amino acids), a subdomain of the M2-MR i3 loop (56 amino acids), or the transregulatory protein c-Jun (amino terminus, 79 amino acids) (Fig. 2 C). These data indicated that the interaction of brain arrestins with the M3-MR affinity matrix was specific for the M3-MR peptide. The specificity of arrestin binding to the M3-MR peptide was further investigated by determining the interaction of the peptide with other cytosolic proteins. The distribution of protein kinase C isoforms, phosphatase 2A, and the actin-binding protein gelsolin in the fractionated bovine brain cytosol was determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 3, left panel). Two protein kinase C isoforms fractionated in the 250 mm NaCl elution of the 90% ammonium sulfate precipitate. The phosphatase 2A immunoreactive species was identified in the 250 mm NaCl elution of the 40% ammonium sulfate precipitate. Gelsolin was enriched in the 100 mm NaCl elution of the 40% ammonium sulfate precipitate. The appropriate fraction was then incubated with the M3-MR or the α2A/D-AR i3 affinity matrix and processed as described for arrestins. Although the M3-MR affinity matrix adsorbed brain arrestins (Fig. 2), neither the M3-MR or the α2A/D-AR i3 peptides interacted with the protein kinase C isoforms, phosphatase 2A, or gelsolin (Fig. 3, right panel). The interaction of arrestins with the i3 peptides was investigated in more detail to define issues of arrestin selectivity and sites of arrestin association. In the first series of experiments, we evaluated arrestin binding to the M3-MR using radiolabeled arrestins. Increasing concentrations of radiolabeled β-arrestin, arrestin-3, and visual arrestin were incubated with the M3-MR or the control GST resin. Both [3H]β-arrestin and [3H]arrestin-3 exhibited specific binding to the M3-MR peptide relative to the binding of the arrestins to the control GST peptide (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, the binding of [3H]visual arrestin to the M3-MR matrix was only slightly increased above that observed with the GST peptide itself, consistent with the lower affinity of visual arrestin at G-protein-coupled receptors other than rhodopsin. Interestingly, the affinities exhibited by [3H]β-arrestin and [3H]arrestin-3 (0.5–1.0 nm) are in the range of the K d for arrestin binding to purified β2-AR and M2-MR (15Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B.

The selectivity of the binding of [3H]arrestins to the M3-MR peptide was also observed with purified β-arrestin and visual arrestin (Fig.4 B). In the second series of experiments, the interaction of arrestins with the i3 peptides was further evaluated using purified β-arrestin and arrestin-3. Purified β-arrestin and arrestin-3 were adsorbed to the M3-MR matrix in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.5 A). Neither arrestin was retained by the control GST resin (Fig. 5 A). As indicated above, brain arrestins were not retained by the M2-MR or α2A/D-AR affinity matrices. However, both the M2-MR and the α2A/D-AR i3 peptides bound purified β-arrestin and arrestin-3 (Fig.5 B). 2Due to differences in the degree of resin substitution for various fusion proteins, variable membrane transfer efficiencies, and relative signal intensities, it is difficult to accurately determine the affinity of arrestin binding to the resins. However, data obtained thus far indicate no dramatic differences in the affinity of the purified arrestins for the three i3 peptides. Figure 5Interaction of purified β-arrestin and arrestin-3 with third intracellular loop peptides. InA, the M3 matrix (∼5 μg of protein) was incubated with increasing concentrations of purified β-arrestin or arrestin-3 and the samples processed as described in the legend to Fig.2 for brain arrestin preparations. Similar results were obtained in three experiments. GST, glutathione S-transferase matrix. In B, GST-receptor subdomain fusion proteins (∼5 μg of protein) were incubated with 200 μg of brain cytosol enriched for arrestins or 50 ng of either purified β-arrestin or arrestin-3. Similar results were obtained in three experiments using different preparations of fusion protein. The aberrant migration of β-arrestin in the M2-MR lane relative to control input is due to comigration of the fusion protein and β-arrestin. The last three lanes on the right of the immunoblot contain aliquots of the material incubated with the resins (cytosol, 5 μg; β-arrestin, 25 ng; arrestin-3, 25 ng). The results are representative of three individual experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The interaction of arrestins with the intact purified M2-MR was previously characterized using in vitro translated arrestins and β-arrestin/visual arrestin chimeras (15Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). We thus compared the interaction of arrestins with the M2-MR i3 peptide and the intact receptor relative to the influence of ionic strength and the selectivity of binding for the different arrestins. As observed for the intact purified receptor that was phosphorylated and/or activated by agonist (15Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), [3H]β-arrestin binding to the i3 peptide was first increased and then decreased with increasing ionic strength of the incubation buffer (Fig.6 A). Previous studies using a series of [3H]β-arrestin/visual arrestin chimeras indicated that the selectivity of β-arrestin and visual arrestin binding to the intact purified M2-MR and the β2-adrenergic receptor involved specific domains of the two arrestins (15Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). To determine if this selectivity of arrestin binding was maintained with the M2-MR i3 peptide, we evaluated the binding of two [3H]β-arrestin/visual arrestin chimeras. The BBBA chimera consists of amino acids 1–340 of β-arrestin and amino acids 346–404 of visual arrestin. The AABB chimera consists of amino acids 1–213 of visual arrestin and amino acids 208–418 of β-arrestin. The binding of BBBA to the intact M2-MR was similar or greater than that observed with β-arrestin, whereas the binding of AABB was intermediate between β-arrestin and visual arrestin (15Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The relative binding of [3H]β-arrestin, [3H]visual arrestin, and the [3H]β-arrestin/visual arrestin chimeras to the M2-MR i3 peptide, as well as the M3-MR peptide, was similar to that observed with the intact purified M2-MR (Fig. 6 B). The next series of experiments were designed to localize subdomains of the M3-MR i3 loop required for interaction with arrestins. The M3-MR i3 peptide (M3-I) was divided into three segments: an amino-terminal region (M3-II, Gly308–Gln389), the carboxyl-terminal region (M3-III, Val390–Leu497), and a middle portion (Lys369–Thr424) (Fig.7 A). The M3 peptide possesses a concentrated negative charge in the amino-terminal third and a concentrated positive charge in the carboxyl-terminal third of the peptide. The contribution of the middle portion was determined using construct M3-IV in which this segment was deleted and the peptide Gly308–Leu368 was fused to the peptide Lys425–Leu497 (Fig. 7 A). Neither construct II or III interacted with brain arrestins or purified β-arrestin under these incubation conditions (Fig.7 B). 3Based on the relative migration of β-arrestin and arrestin-3 in 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and the comigration of the partially purified brain arrestin with β-arrestin (Fig. 5), the arrestin identified in the 100 mm NaCl elution of the 90% ammonium sulfate precipitate is predominantly β-arrestin (G. Wu and S. M. Lanier, unpublished data). However, the construct containing both the amino and carboxyl regions of the M3-I peptide (M3-IV) retained the ability to interact with brain arrestins and purified β-arrestin (Fig. 7 B). These data suggest that there are at least two sites on the M3-I peptide for β-arrestin binding and that one of these sites by itself is insufficient. In contrast to the results with β-arrestin, the carboxyl region of the M3-MR peptide was sufficient for interaction with arrestin-3 (Fig. 7 B). Arrestin-3 bound to the M3-I, -III, and -IV, but not to construct II, suggesting that the binding motif for arrestin-3 is different from that of β-arrestin. As is apparently the case with most complex signal processing systems, G-protein-coupled receptors likely operate within a signal transduction complex that is either preexisting or is generated by the biological stimuli. The components of such a signaling complex are unclear but might include proteins that influence events at the receptor-G-protein or G-protein-effector interface or contribute to the formation of the signal transduction complex itself (Refs. 17Sato M. Kataoka R. Dingus J. Wilcox M. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15269-15276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar and 18Sato M. Ribas C. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30052-30060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, and references therein). As part of an effort to identify components of this signal transduction complex, we initiated two experimental approaches. The first approach was based on a biological activity and was designed to detect factors that might influence the transfer of signal from receptor to G-protein (17Sato M. Kataoka R. Dingus J. Wilcox M. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15269-15276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 18Sato M. Ribas C. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30052-30060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The second approach, described in the present report, involved the identification of proteins capable of associating with receptors of this class. In the latter approach, we used intracellular domains of G-protein-coupled receptors as “bait” to search for interacting proteins in brain cytosol. Receptor subdomains were generated from the i3 loop of the M2-MR, M3-MR, and α2-AR. Both the muscarinic receptor subtypes and the α2-AR are capable of coupling to multiple G-proteins and effectors in a cell type-specific manner. Activation of the M2-MR results in inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, whereas the M3-MR couples to the inositol phosphate/protein kinase C signaling pathway. The α2A/D-AR is generally associated with inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, but activation of this receptor also influences signal transduction pathways involving phospholipases, p21 ras, the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, and various ion channels (see Ref. 17Sato M. Kataoka R. Dingus J. Wilcox M. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15269-15276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, and references therein). We first evaluated the interaction of the i3 loops with the arrestin family of proteins, which are implicated in receptor uncoupling and internalization. The arrestins exhibited a specific interaction with the i3 receptor subdomains. The receptor subdomain probes did not interact with selected protein kinase C isoforms, cytosolic phosphatase 2A, or the actin-binding protein gelsolin. However, both β-arrestin and arrestin-3 bound to the i3 loops of the muscarinic receptor subtypes and the α2A/D-AR. The major observations concerning this interaction are as follows. First, the interaction of β-arrestin and arrestin-3 with the M3-MR involved different regions of the i3 loop. Second, the i3 domains from the muscarinic receptors and the α2A/D-AR differed in their ability to interact with endogenous bovine brain arrestins in a crude cytosol fraction versus purified recombinant β-arrestin and arrestin-3. Third, the interaction of arrestins with the i3 loop peptides occurred in the absence of peptide phosphorylation. Both β-arrestin and arrestin-3 are widely expressed, but exhibit a heterogeneous intra-tissue distribution, and both arrestins are alternatively spliced to generate a short and long form of the protein. Although arrestins clearly interact with the receptor protein (15Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 232: 464-472Google Scholar), the sites of interaction and the selectivity among the different arrestins and receptor families outside the visual system are undefined. However, the present study indicates that there are receptor motifs that are indeed capable of distinguishing the two types of arrestin. Within the M3-MR i3 loop, amino acids Gly308–Leu368 and Lys425–Leu497 are required for binding of β-arrestin and the partially purified brain arrestin, whereas amino acids Gly308–Leu368 are not required for binding of arrestin-3. The differential interaction of the two arrestins with the M3-MR subdomain may relate to the charge distribution within the receptor peptide segments and the structural properties of the two arrestins. Although the i3 peptides from the M2-MR, M3-MR and α2A/D-AR all bound purified arrestins, only the M3-MR was capable of interacting with brain cytosol arrestins. The inability of brain arrestins to interact with the M2-MR and α2-AR may simply reflect differences in the relative affinities of the different receptor subdomains for the arrestins. However, there were no apparent differences in the efficiency of the interaction of the three receptor subdomains with the purified arrestins under these experimental conditions, suggesting that other factors may be regulating this interaction. It is possible that the brain arrestins are slightly different from the recombinant arrestins, and that this difference contributes to selective interactions with receptor families. Alternatively, perhaps there are additional proteins in the fractionated brain cytosol that impede arrestin binding to the M2-MR and α2A/D-AR, but not the M3-MR i3 peptides. Such proteins may interact with motifs in the i3 peptide or perhaps with arrestin itself. Interaction of visual arrestin with rhodopsin or β-arrestin and arrestin-3 with the β2-AR or the M2-MR involves multiple contact sites that impart apparent positive cooperativity to the reaction (15Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 16879-16882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Arrestin binding to the receptor is proposed to first involve an ionic interaction that senses the phosphorylation and activation state of the receptor. If the receptor is phosphorylated or agonist-occupied, the apparent affinity of arrestin binding to the receptor is increased. The phosphorylated receptor subdomain likely forms a component of the arrestin binding site, although phosphorylation-dependent conformational shifts in the intracellular regions of the receptor may also reveal sites that participate in arrestin binding. Whereas the binding of arrestin to rhodopsin is highly dependent upon receptor phosphorylation and activation, a truncated splice variant of visual arrestin binds to nonphosphorylated rhodopsin. The truncated and full-length visual arrestins differ in their subcellular distribution, with the former constitutively localized to disc membranes, while the latter associates with the disc membranes in a light-dependent manner (23Smith W.C. Milam A.H. Dugger D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15407-15410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β-Arrestin and arrestin-3 also bind to nonphosphorylated M2-MR or β2-AR and high affinity binding is less dependent upon the activation state of the receptor than is the interaction between visual arrestin and rhodopsin (15Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 23Smith W.C.

The possible interaction of arrestins with nonphosphorylated receptors is also suggested by the ability of phosphorylation-defective mutants to undergo receptor desensitization and sequestration. An important role for arrestin interaction with a nonphosphorylated receptor is also apparent for visual signaling in invertebrates (24Plangger A. Malicki D. Whitney M. Paulsen R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26969-26975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the dipteranCalliphora, arrestin interaction with the receptor protein clearly precedes receptor phosphorylation, and indeed the arrestin-receptor complex is the preferred kinase substrate (24Plangger A. Malicki D. Whitney M. Paulsen R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26969-26975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As the interaction of arrestins with the i3 peptides in the present study occurred without peptide phosphorylation, the i3 loop or perhaps other domains of G-protein-coupled receptors appear capable of serving as a docking site for arrestin independent of receptor phosphorylation. Indeed, the properties of arrestin binding to the M2-MR i3 peptide appeared similar to those exhibited by the purified receptor protein that was phosphorylated and/or activated by agonist. The binding of β-arrestin and arrestin-3 to the i3 peptides may also relate to the agonist-induced conformational changes responsible for initiating the signaling cascade. In the absence of agonist, the regions of the receptor involved in G-protein activation are stabilized in a conformation that acts as a “brake” on signal initiation (25Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Such a conformational “brake” may be released by discrete mutations in the i3 loop of some receptors, such that the receptor becomes constitutively active (26Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Cotecchia S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11354-11358Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). An analogous situation may occur when the i3 loop is separated from the conformational restrictions imposed by membrane spans of the receptor and assumes an “activated and/or accessible conformation” that is recognized by arrestin. The demonstration that the experimental approach using receptor subdomains as probes for receptor-associated proteins resulted in the detection of protein-protein interactions of clear biological relevance underscores the potential utility of the system to identify additional interacting proteins that may contribute to the formation of a signal transduction complex. Such interacting proteins may play an important role in directing the receptor-initiated signal to a specific effector pathway. In contrast to signaling events in the visual system where the components are localized and the interactions between the individual molecules are relatively specific, other G-protein-coupled receptors operate in diverse cell types and couple to multiple G-proteins and effectors. Perhaps, such receptors have evolved larger i3 loops to maintain the fidelity of the signaling system by providing sites for interaction with additional accessory proteins that influence receptor trafficking and/or signaling specificity and efficiency.

Here we show that either serum treatment or activation of the stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) led to enhanced phosphorylation of eIF4E in quiescent NIH 3T3 cells. Although the immunosuppressant, rapamycin, was found to stabilize the association of eIF4E with its negative regulator, 4E-BP1, this drug did not prevent the early effects of serum stimulation on the overall rate of translation, polysome formation, the phosphorylation status of eIF4E, or the recruitment of eIF4E into the eIF4F complex. However, the rapid enhancement of eIF4E phosphorylation in response to serum was largely prevented by the inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation, PD98059. Activation of the JNK/SAPK signaling pathway with anisomycin resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of eIF4E, which was prevented by either rapamycin or the highly specific p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB203580. These data illustrate that multiple signaling pathways, including those of distinct members of the MAP kinase family, mediate the phosphorylation of eIF4E and that the association of eIF4E with 4E-BP1 does not necessarily prevent phosphorylation of eIF4E in vivo.

Control of polypeptide synthesis plays an important role in cell proliferation, with physiological regulation of protein synthesis almost always exerted at the level of polypeptide chain initiation (reviewed in Refs. 1Morley S.J.

It is believed that eIF4F functions to unwind secondary structure in the mRNA 5′-untranslated region to facilitate binding to the 40 S ribosomal subunit (1Morley S.J. Clemens M.J.

Consistent with its proposed regulatory role, eIF4E exists in both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms. Although increased levels of eIF4E phosphorylation have been directly correlated with enhanced rates of translation in a variety of cell types (reviewed in Ref. 1Morley S.J. Clemens M.J. Protein Phosphorylation in Cell Growth Regulation. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1996: 197-224Google Scholar), it is still not clear how phosphorylation of eIF4E modulates its activity. While there may be a direct effect of phosphorylation on cap structure recognition in vitro (12Minich B. Balasta M.L. Goss D.J. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7668-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of eIF4E in vivo can also be correlated with enhanced interaction with other components of the eIF4F complex (13Bu X. Haas D.W. Hagedorn C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4975-4978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Morley S.J. Rau M. Kay J.E. Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Two additional proteins (4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2), which interact with eIF4E and inhibit cap structure-dependent translation, have been identified as downstream signaling targets (15Pause A Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donze O. Lin T.-A. Lawrence J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 16Von Manteuffel S.R. Gingras A.-C. Ming X.-F. Sonenberg N. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4048-4076Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 disrupts its interaction with eIF4E, liberating eIF4E to interact with a conserved hydrophobic region of eIF4G. A similar sequence found in 4E-BP1 is involved in binding to eIF4E and competes with eIF4G for eIF4E binding (17Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). It is believed that the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and consequent liberation of eIF4E lead to the up-regulation of translation (1Morley S.J. Clemens M.J. Protein Phosphorylation in Cell Growth Regulation. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1996: 197-224Google Scholar, 15Pause A Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donze O. Lin T.-A. Lawrence J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). It has also been claimed that association with 4E-BP1 prevents the phosphorylation of eIF4E by protein kinase C in vitro (18Whalen S.G. Gingras A.-C. Amankwa L. Mader S. Branton P.E. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11831-11837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In several cell types, the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 is inhibited by the immunosuppressant, rapamycin, which prevents the activation of the p70S6Ksignaling pathway and stabilizes the interaction between eIF4E and 4E-BP1 (see Refs. 1Morley S.J. Clemens M.J. Protein Phosphorylation in Cell Growth Regulation. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1996: 197-224Google Scholar, 4Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N.

Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4048-4076Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar, and references therein). However, rapamycin does not prevent the phosphorylation of eIF4E in primary pig T cells (19Morley S.J. Pain V.M. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), Xenopus oocytes (20Morley S.J. Pain V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1751-1760PubMed Google Scholar), CHO.T cells in response to insulin (21Flynn A. Proud C.G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), or NIH 3T3 cells in response to serum (22Beretta L. Gingras A.-C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). We have examined the signal transduction pathways that are involved in the enhanced phosphorylation of eIF4E and its recruitment to ribosomes. Our data indicate that, in NIH 3T3 cells, eIF4E phosphorylation is enhanced in response either to serum or to activation of the JNK/SAPK and p38/RK signaling pathways with anisomycin. In response to serum stimulation, eIF4E phosphorylation is largely mediated via the classical MAP kinase pathway, and is independent of both p70S6K signaling and association of eIF4E with 4E-BP1. However, following anisomycin treatment, phosphorylation of eIF4E via JNK/SAPK is dependent upon p70S6K and the p38/RK signaling pathways. These data suggest that the phosphorylation of eIF4E and 4E-BP1 can be regulated independently and that each may play a direct role in regulating translational initiation in vivo.

Microcystin was from Calbiochem; unless otherwise stated, all other chemicals were from Sigma. Antiserum to 4E-BP1 (PHAS-I) was kindly provided by Dr. J. Lawrence, Jr. (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO) and Prof. R. Denton (Department of Biochemistry, Bristol, UK) and the plasmid encoding the glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein GST-c-Jun-(1–79) was provided by Dr. M.

NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax™ supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Prior to treatment with rapamycin, RO31-8220, PD98059, or SB203580, cells were grown to 80% confluence and then serum-starved in 0.5% FCS for 48 h. Treatments with agonists/inhibitors were as described in individual figure legends. Cells were then washed and extracts prepared as described below. Following treatment, the medium was removed and plates of cells were transferred to ice. Cells were scraped into 0.5 ml of Buffer A (50 mm Mops-KOH, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 μm microcystin, 120 mm NaCl, 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm GTP, 2 mmNa3VO4), isolated by centrifugation, and washed in 0.5 ml of the same buffer. Cells were resuspended in 0.1 ml of Buffer A/10-cm plate and lysed by the addition of 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (v/v) deoxycholate, and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and vortexing. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 5 min at 4 °C, and the resultant supernatant was frozen in liquid N2. Cells were grown in six-well plates and starved, as described above, prior to activation in the presence of 25 μCi/ml [35S]methionine, for the times described in the figure legends. The medium was removed and cells washed in Buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.134m NaCl, 1 μm microcystin, 2 mmbenzamidine) containing 5 mm unlabeled methionine, prior to lysis with 0.3 m NaOH. Incorporation of radioactivity into protein was determined by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid. One-dimensional polyacrylamide gels and vertical slab iso-electric focusing gels were run as described (19Morley S.J. Pain V.M. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and proteins transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. eIFE, eIF4G, and 4E-BP1 were detected with specific rabbit anti-peptide antisera as described previously (20Morley S.J. Pain V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1751-1760PubMed Google Scholar) and in the individual figure legends. For the isolation of eIF4E and associated proteins, cell extracts of equal protein concentration were subjected to m7GTP-Sepharose chromatography as described (19Morley S.J. Pain V.M. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Morley S.J. Pain V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1751-1760PubMed Google Scholar). The beads were washed three times in Buffer A and bound protein eluted with either SDS-PAGE or VSIEF sample buffer, as indicated. Immunoprecipitation of eIF4G and associated eIF4E from cell extracts of equal protein concentration was as described previously (20Morley S.J. Pain V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1751-1760PubMed Google Scholar). Solid-state protein kinase assays using the GST-c-Jun-(1–79) fusion protein were performed as described (23Moxham C.M. Tabrizchi A. Davis R.J. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30765-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples of cell extracts (60 μg) were mixed with 10 μg of GST-c-Jun-(1–79) prebound to GSH-Sepharose. After 20 min at 30 °C, the resin was recovered by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, washed twice in kinase assay buffer (50 mmMops-KOH, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 μm microcystin, 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4), and resuspended in 20 μl of the same buffer containing 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1500 cpm/pmol). After 20 min at 30 °C, reactions were terminated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, followed by analysis by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. eIF4E plays a central role in the regulation of translation, with a strong correlation between the phosphorylation of eIF4E, eIF4F complex formation, and the rate of protein synthesis and cell growth (reviewed in Ref. 1Morley S.J. Clemens M.J. Protein Phosphorylation in Cell Growth Regulation. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1996: 197-224Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which phosphorylation of eIF4E at Ser-209 (25Joshi B. Cai A.-L. Keiper B.D. Minich W.B. Mendez R. Beach C.M. Stepinski J. Stolarski R. Darzynkiewicz E. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol.

In addition to phosphorylation, the activity of eIF4E can also be modulated by its availability to participate in the initiation process, mediated by its interaction with specific binding proteins, 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 (4Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-269Google Scholar, 15Pause A Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donze O. Lin T.-A. Lawrence J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). These studies have been facilitated by the use of rapamycin, an inhibitor of the p70S6K signaling pathway, which blocks cell cycle progression (27Brown E.J. Schneider S.L. Cell. 1996; 86: 517-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), prevents the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in response to growth factors (1Morley S.J. Clemens M.J.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). However, this may be a simplistic view, as studies by Beretta et al. (22Beretta L. Gingras A.-C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) have shown a lack of temporal correlation between the inhibition of phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and the inhibition of translation. In addition, stabilization of the eIF4E/4E-BP1 complex did not prevent the serum-stimulated phosphorylation of eIF4E in vivo. To examine this further, we have analyzed the correlation between the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, polysome formation, eIF4F complex formation, and the activation of protein synthesis in NIH 3T3 cells. At 4 h following serum stimulation (Fig. 1 A), rapamycin had only a small inhibitory effect (20–25%) on the rate of total protein synthesis, under conditions where the activation of p70S6K was completely prevented (data not shown). This inhibition was further increased to 30–35% by 20 h. At early times after serum stimulation, rapamycin had little effect on polysome formation (Fig. 1 B), even if the cells had been preincubated with rapamycin prior to activation; further incubation in the presence of rapamycin resulted in a 25–30% decrease in polysome formation (data not shown). We have also examined the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and its association with eIF4E. Multiple forms of 4E-BP1 can be distinguished on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 1 C), with the γ form identified as more highly phosphorylated than the α and β forms (28Graves L.M. Bornfeldt K.E. Argast G.M. Krebs E.G. Kong X. Lin T.-A. Lawrence J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7222-7226Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Serum stimulation resulted in the characteristic mobility shift from the predominant α and β forms to the γ form (lane 2 versus lane 1), an effect that was largely prevented by the co-addition of rapamycin (lane 3). Isolation of eIF4E from the unstimulated cells by m7GTP-Sepharose (lane 4) indicated, as expected (1Morley S.J. Clemens M.J. Protein Phosphorylation in Cell Growth Regulation. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1996: 197-224Google Scholar, 4Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-269Google Scholar) that the factor was mainly associated with the less phosphorylated (α and β) forms of 4E-BP1. As predicted from the current models, enhanced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was concomitant with its release from eIF4E (lane 5 versus lane 4), an effect largely prevented by rapamycin (lane 6). Preincubation of cells with rapamycin for 30 min prior to activation caused a greater accumulation of the α form of 4E-BP1, but did not increase the level of 4E-BP1 associated with eIF4E above that presented in lane 6. 2S. J. Morley, unpublished data. To determine the effect of rapamycin on eIF4F complex formation, extracts were prepared following serum stimulation for 4 h in the absence or presence of rapamycin prior to immunoprecipitation of eIF4G. The level of associated eIF4E was then assessed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting; the results of quantification of these data are presented in the figure legend. As shown in Fig. 1 D, serum treatment enhanced the recovery of eIF4E associated with eIF4G by 2.5-fold (lane 1 versus lane 3 and figure legend), indicative of a stimulation of eIF4F complex assembly. Similar observations have been reported for other cell types following activation of protein synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 1Morley S.J. Clemens M.J. Protein Phosphorylation in Cell Growth Regulation. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1996: 197-224Google Scholar). Although rapamycin prevented the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and stabilized its association with eIF4E (panel C, lane 4 versus lane 6), the recovery of eIF4E associated with eIF4G was enhanced by 2.3-fold. These data suggest that rapamycin did not prevent the assembly of the eIF4F complex at 4 h following serum stimulation, suggesting that enhanced eIF4F complex formation in vivo can occur independently of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. These findings are not consistent with the in vitro studies of Haghighat et al. (17Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), who reported that the interaction of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E prevents the interaction of eIF4E with eIF4G. Possible explanations for this are that either 4E-BP1 is not present in excess of eIF4E in these cells or that there is a population of eIF4E that is inaccessible to 4E-BP1 and is sufficient to support enhanced protein synthesis at early times of activation. Indeed, even prolonged incubation with rapamycin for 20 h resulted in only a 30–40% decrease in the amount of eIF4E associated with eIF4G in this system (data not shown). As suggested by Beretta et al. (22Beretta L. Gingras A.-C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), these data may reflect a slow rate of exchange of eIF4E through the eIF4F complex, such that eIF4E is only able to interact with 4E-BP1 after it is released from eIF4F. We have also examined the intracellular signaling pathways modulating the enhanced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and eIF4E, the association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E, and eIF4F complex formation in response to serum stimulation. In addition to rapamycin, we have used the following well characterized inhibitors: PD98059, to prevent activation of the classical MAP kinase pathway (29Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar); RO31-8220, which functions as a general inhibitor of protein kinase C (30Nixon J.S. Bishop J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27018-27024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar); and SB203580, which is a specific inhibitor of the p38/RK MAP kinase (32Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A shows that there was a moderate increase in the rate of protein synthesis over the initial 30 min following serum addition. As shown in the Western blots in Fig.2 B (lane 2), enhanced translation rates could be correlated with increased phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and the dissociation of 4E-BP1 from eIF4E. The concomitant shift of immunoreactive eIF4E to the upper form on VSIEF indicated enhanced phosphorylation (19Morley S.J. Pain V.M. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Morley S.J. Pain V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1751-1760PubMed Google Scholar). Quantification of these data by densitometric scanning (see figure legend) indicated that the percentage of total eIF4E in the phosphorylated form was increased from 8% in the unstimulated cells to 40% following serum stimulation. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation of eIF4E with an antiserum recognizing eIF4G, indicated a 2-fold increase in eIF4F complex formation (see figure legend for quantifcation). In agreement with published data, rapamycin did not suppress the effect of serum on the rate of translation (Fig.2 A, lane 4) or the phosphorylation of eIF4E (19Morley S.J. Pain V.M. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Morley S.J. Pain V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1751-1760PubMed Google Scholar, 21Flynn A. Proud C.G.

These data suggest that the association of eIF4E with 4E-BP1 does not necessarily prevent phosphorylation of eIF4E in vivo. PD98059, which had little effect on the rate of translation when added alone (Fig. 2 A, lane 8) or following serum stimulation (Fig. 2 A, lane 5), prevented activation of classical ERK2 MAP kinases (Ref. 29Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar and data not shown) and attenuated the phosphorylation of eIF4E (Fig. 2 B,lane 5 and legend). However, it did not prevent the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 or the dissociation of this protein from eIF4E. Serum-stimulated association of eIF4E with eIF4G was also unaffected by this inhibitor. These data are consistent with published work, which shows that MAP kinase activation is not required for increased phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (16Von Manteuffel S.R. Gingras A.-C. Ming X.-F. Sonenberg N. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4048-4076Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In addition, as shown for CHO.T cells (21Flynn A. Proud C.G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), these data indicate that signaling through the MAP kinase pathway is in part responsible for mediating the phosphorylation of eIF4E. Consistent with these findings is the observation that NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing MAP kinase kinase show an elevated basal level of eIF4E phosphorylation.2Figure 2Inhibition of the MAP kinase but not the p70S6K signaling pathway prevents the phosphorylation of eIF4E but not formation of the eIF4F complex. Panel A, serum-starved cells were incubated in six-well plates in the absence or presence of PD98059 (50 μm), rapamycin (50 nm), or RO31-8220 (50 μm) for 15 min, as indicated.

In addition, type I PIP5Ks phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, while type II kinases have less activity toward this substrate. Remarkably, these kinases can convert phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate in a concerted reaction. Kinase activities toward the 3-position phosphoinositides are comparable with those seen with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate as the substrate. Therefore, the PIP5Ks can synthesize phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and two 3-phosphate-containing polyphosphoinositides. These unexpected activities position the PIP5Ks as potential participants in the generation of all polyphosphoinositide signaling molecules.

Two distinct pathways have been characterized for agonist-stimulated signal transduction involving phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns). 1The abbreviations used are: PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; PIP5K, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase; PIP5KI, type I phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase; PIP5KII, type II phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase; PtdIns 3-P, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate; PtdIns 4-P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; PtdIns 3,4-P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate; PtdIns 4,5-P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PtdInsP2, phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate; PtdIns 3,4,5-P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; PtdInsP3, phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; Ins 1,4-P2, inositol 1,4-bisphosphate; Ins 1,3,4-P3, inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate; GroPIns, glycerophosphorylinositol. One pathway entails activation of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C by extracellular agonists resulting in the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides to generate soluble inositol phosphates including inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol (reviewed in Refs. 1Majerus P.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 225-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar and 2Lee S.B. Rhee S.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The other pathway involves receptor-mediated activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns 3-kinase) to produce the second messengers, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns 3,4-P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns 3,4,5-P3) (reviewed in Refs. 3Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 329-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholarand 4Divecha N. Irvine R.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). A pathway for the formation of D-3-phosphatidylinositols, proposed based on kinetic studies of intact human neutrophils, is through phosphorylation of the D-3 position of the myo-inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns 4,5-P2) by a PtdIns 4,5-P2 3-kinase and subsequent dephosphorylation of PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 to produce PtdIns 3,4-P2(5Stephens L.R. Hughes K.T. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1991; 351: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). This pathway has been supported by the existence of the extensively characterized PtdIns 3-kinase enzyme family, which can catalyze in vitro phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns 4-P) and PtdIns 4,5-P2. Evidence for a different pathway for the formation of D-3 phosphatidylinositols has been found in human platelets, NIH 3T3 cells, and plants in which phosphorylation of the D-3-position of PtdIns to form PtdIns 3-P is followed by phosphorylation of the D-4-position to give PtdIns 3,4-P2 and then of the D-5-position to form PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 (6Cunningham T.W.

The importance of these various routes of synthesis has been disputed. Indeed, until now, enzymes that catalyze the direct phosphorylation of PtdIns 3-P and PtdIns 3,4-P2have not been clearly identified. Several phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinases (PIP5Ks) have been discovered and characterized as enzymes synthesizing PtdIns 4,5-P2 (reviewed in Ref. 11Loijens J.C. Boronenkov I.V. Parker G.J. Anderson R.A. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1996; 36: 115-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The best characterized isoforms are the type I and type II kinases that differ both biochemically and immunologically (12Ling L.E. Schulz J.T. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

The sequence of a type II PIP5K (PIP5KIIα) has established that the PIP5K enzymes belong to a novel family (15Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. J. Biol.

None of the PIP5K isozymes have been examined for alternative substrates except phosphatidylinositol for which there was no detectable activity (12Ling L.E. Schulz J.T. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5080-5088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bazenet C.E. Ruano A.R. Brockman J.L. Anderson R.A. J. Biol.

We report here that the type I and II PIP5K isozymes also utilize the 3-phosphate-containing phosphatidylinositides, forming PtdIns 3,4-P2 and PtdIns 3,4,5-P3. This supports the existence of an additional pathway for the synthesis of 3-phosphate-containing phosphatidylinositol polyphosphates. PtdIns and PtdIns 4-P were from Boehringer Mannheim or Sigma. PtdIns 3-P and PtdIns 3,4-P2dipalmitoyl esters were synthesized (22Prestwich G.D. Acc. Chem. Res. 1996; 29: 503-513Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar) according to Chen and Prestwich, 2J.

PtdIns 3-P and PtdIns 3,4-P2dipalmitoyl esters were also from Matreya. [3H]inositol 1-phosphate, [3H]Ins 1,4-P2, [3H]Ins 1,3,4-P3 and [γ-32P]ATP were from NEN Life Science Products. Lipofectamine, OPTI-MEM, and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant human PIP5Ks were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified by Ni2+-chelate chromatography (15Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2881-2884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 16Loijens J.C. Anderson R.A. J. Biol.

These proteins were stored in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mmNaCl, 0.01% sodium azide, and 20% glycerol for the type I isozymes or 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 20% glycerol for the type II isozymes. Polymerase chain reaction-based cloning of the recombinant PIP5KIβ used in these experiments resulted in two changes from the published sequence: glutamine 300 to arginine and serine 421 to proline. Both changes lie outside of the conserved kinase homology domain (16Loijens J.C. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32937-32943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The activity of PIP5KIIβ is less stable; thus, larger amounts were used to achieve comparable activity in the kinase assays. PIP5K isozymes were assayed in 50-μl reactions containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2–100 μmsubstrate prepared in isotonic KCl solution, and 50 μmATP (4 μCi/nmol). The reactions, at 37 or 22 °C, ranged from 5 to 40 min. Immunoprecipitate kinase activities were tested for 10.5 min at 22 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 50 μmsubstrates prepared in Tris buffer and 50 μm ATP (4 μCi/nmol). The reactions were stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 1 n HCl, and the lipid products were extracted using 200 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1). The organic phase was washed at least once in 80 μl of methanol, 1 n HCl (1:1). The organic phase was then spotted on TLC plates and run as before (16Loijens J.C. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32937-32943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). After autoradiography for 1–12 h, the spots on the TLC plates corresponding to products were scraped into vials and counted using Cerenkov radioactivity in a Beckman scintillation counter. Phosphatidylinositol products scraped from TLC plates were treated with methylamine reagent at 53 °C for 50 min (6Cunningham T.W. Lips D.L. Bansal V.S. Caldwell K.K. Mitchell C.A. Majerus P.W. J.

The glycerophosphorylinositol phosphate products of deacylation reactions were mixed with [3H]inositol 1-phosphate, [3H]Ins 1,4-P2, and [3H]Ins 1,3,4-P3 as internal standards and separated by HPLC with a Partisil 10 Sax column (Whatman) (25Auger K.R.

The 1-ml fractions of eluate from the HPLC column were counted in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. PtdIns [32P]3-P, PtdIns [32P]3,4-P2, and PtdIns [32P]3,4,5-P3 were prepared using a recombinant mutant p110 subunit of PtdIns 3-kinase that is constitutively active (26Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) (gift from L. T. Williams, Chiron). The Sf9 cell-expressed p110 mutant PtdIns 3-kinase was purified using the nickel-nitrolotriacetic acid affinity purification procedure (PharMingen). The kinase reactions were in 1 ml containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5; 0.2 mm EDTA; 5 mmMgCl2; 1 mg of PtdIns, PtdIns 4-P, or PtdIns 4,5-P2; 1 mg of phosphatidylserine, 1 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 μg of PtdIns 3-kinase for 1 h at 37 °C. The lipid products were extracted and purified using preparative TLC (27Norris F.A. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8716-8720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified PtdIns [32P]3-P, PtdIns [32P]3,4-P2, and PtdIns [32P]3,4,5-P3 were dried under N2and deacylated (6Cunningham T.W. Lips D.L. Bansal V.S. Caldwell K.K. Mitchell C.A. Majerus P.W. J. Biol.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against the hexahistine-PIP5KIα fusion protein (16Loijens J.C. Anderson R.A. J. Biol.

The depleted IgG were those IgG isolated from immune sera after it had been depleted of anti-PIP5KIα antibodies by multiple cycles over the antigen affinity column. PIP5KII antibodies (13Bazenet C.E. Ruano A.R. Brockman J.L. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18012-18022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were affinity-purified on a recombinant PIP5KIIα column (15Boronenkov I.V.

Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32937-32943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). PIP5KIα and PIP5KIIα were N-terminally tagged with the FLAG epitope by subcloning their coding regions into pcDNA3-FLAG vectors provided by Dr. Jon Morrow (Yale University). The epitope is recognized by the anti-FLAG m2 monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.). Plasmids were introduced into COS-7 cells by lipofectamine-mediated transfection following the manufacturer's procedures (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfection of pcDNA3-CAT (Invitrogen) was used as a control. Transfected cells were harvested 17 h after adding the DNA and lysed in 250 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. After they were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, COS-7 cells were lysed in 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin and 10 trypsin inhibitory units/ml aprotinin. The clarified lysates (250 μg) were precleared with Omnisorb cells (Calbiochem), the protein G matrix used to isolate the immune complexes. Immunoprecipitations were performed with 2 μg of antibody and the Omnisorb cells (28Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). For the transfection experiments, immunoprecipitations were done from 200 μl of lysate with 6 μg of α-FLAG antibody. After several washes, the pellets were resuspended in 80 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and split into 20-μl samples for kinase assays and Western blotting. The ability of four different PIP5K isozymes to phosphorylate PtdIns 3-P, PtdIns 3,4-P2, and PtdIns 4-P is shown in Fig.1 A. When analyzed by TLC, the PtdIns 3-P phosphorylation product migrated as a phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PtdInsP2). The product migrated more slowly than PtdIns 4,5-P2, probably because the PtdIns 3-P substrate is a dipalmitoyl synthetic lipid (22Prestwich G.D. Acc. Chem. Res. 1996; 29: 503-513Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The two additional faint spots above PtdIns 3-P-derived PtdInsP2 may be phosphorylatable minor contaminants arising during the chemical synthesis of PtdIns 3-P. The PIP5KII enzymes have similar or greater activity toward PtdIns 3-P in comparison with PtdIns 4-P, whereas the PIP5KI isozymes prefer PtdIns 4-P. In addition, the PIP5KI enzymes also have activity toward PtdIns 3,4-P2, producing a product that migrates as PtdInsP3 (Fig. 1 A, lanes 5 and6). Remarkably, both PIP5KI isozymes and PIP5KIIα produce products from PtdIns 3-P that migrate in the PtdInsP3position (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1–3). The initial rate of PtdIns 3-P phosphorylation using PIP5KIIα was 4-fold greater than that of its previously identified substrate PtdIns 4-P (Fig. 1 B). In addition, the phosphorylation of PtdIns 3-P was linear for a longer time interval compared with PtdIns 4-P (Fig. 1 B). In a short reaction (5 min), comparison of PIP5KIIα kinase activity toward PtdIns 3-P and PtdIns 4-P at various concentrations indicated that the activity toward both substrates was dependent on their concentrations (data not shown). The kinetic parameters for PIP5KIIα phosphorylation of PtdIns 3-P and PtdIns 4-P are shown in Table I. The apparent K m value of PIP5KIIα for PtdIns 3-P is 3-fold greater than PtdIns 4-P. However, the V m for PtdIns 3-P is also about 3-fold greater than that for PtdIns 4-P. As a result, the catalytic efficiency (V m /K m ) for these two substrates is the same. Little activity toward PtdIns 3,4-P2 was detected with the type II PIP5Ks (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and 4).Table IKinetic parameters of PIP5K isozymesEnzymesSubstratesPtdIns 3-PPtdIns 4-PPtdIns 3,4-P2K mV mV m /K mK mV mV m /K mK mV mV m /K mPIP5KIIα120900.850390.8ND1-aND, none detected.NDNDPIP5KIα65190329.04729653631.0804385.5PIP5KIβ1-bPutative Friedrich's ataxia gene product.5428.4262475318.06396.5The data are representative of three separate sets of experiments.

Units for kinetic values are μm for K m and pmol/min per mg of purified protein based on a Bradford assay forV m . The kinetic parameters of PIP5KI isozymes with their different substrates are listed in Table I. The time dependence of PIP5KIα activity using PtdIns 3-P and PtdIns 4-P is shown in Fig.1 C. The substrate preferences of the type I isozymes are different from the type II isozyme in that the type I PIP5K (α and β) enzymes phosphorylate PtdIns 4-P with a much greaterV m than PtdIns 3-P. However, theK m values of the PIP5KI enzymes using PtdIns 3-P are lower than that of PIP5KIIα. The products of the PIP5K reactions using PtdIns 3-P and PtdIns 3,4-P2 as substrates were identified by HPLC analysis (Fig.2). It was anticipated that the PtdInsP2products would be PtdIns 3,5-P2, given the specificity of the PIP5K enzymes toward PtdIns 4-P. Surprisingly, HPLC analysis demonstrated that the deacylated product of all of the PIP5K isozymes using PtdIns 3-P as substrate co-chromatographed with GroPIns 3,4-P2, as illustrated for PIP5KIIα in Fig.2 A. This indicated that these kinases synthesize PtdIns 3,4-P2. The HPLC analysis also revealed that the product of PIP5KIα and PIP5KIβ activity toward PtdIns 3,4-P2 was PtdIns 3,4,5-P3. This is shown for PIP5KIα in Fig.2 B. The structure of these products was further verified using specific inositol lipid phosphatases. The inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase (4-phosphatase) specifically hydrolyzes the 4-position phosphate of PtdIns 3,4-P2 (27Norris F.A. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8716-8720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of the putative PtdIns 3,4-P2 products of PIP5K reactions with recombinant 4-phosphatase resulted in release of 32P-labeled inorganic phosphate, confirming that this was PtdIns 3,4-P2 labeled in the D-4-position (data not shown). In addition, treatment of the PtdInsP3 product with the Lowe oculocerebrorenal syndrome 5-phosphatase, an enzyme that specifically hydrolyzes the 5-position phosphate of PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 (29Zhang X.

This result confirms that the product of this reaction was PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 labeled on the D-5-position. Reactions using PtdIns 3-P as substrate also contained a product that migrated as PtdIns 3,4,5-P3. This product was observed using PIP5KI isozymes and PIP5KIIα but not PIP5KIIβ (Fig.1 A, lanes 1–4). HPLC analysis confirmed that this was PtdIns 3,4,5-P3, which comigrated with lesser concentrations of lyso-PtdIns 3,4-P2 (20% for PIP5KIs, 45% for PIP5KIIα). The amounts of PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 formed are shown in Table II. Because the substrate concentrations were 80 μm and the intermediate PtdIns 3,4-P2 product was nanomolar where PtdIns 3-P was the substrate, the amount of PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 formed is remarkable. Indeed, the amount of PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 formed from PtdIns 3-P using either PIP5KIα or PIP5KIIα was similar to that using 80 μm PtdIns 3,4-P2 with PIP5KIα. These results suggest that synthesis of PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 from PtdIns 3-P is a concerted reaction. In the case of the type II enzymes, PtdIns 3,4-P2 was not detectably phosphorylated by these enzymes. Yet, when type II kinases use PtdIns 3-P as substrate, PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 is produced.Table IIConversion of PtdIns 3-P to PtdIns 3,4,5-P 3IsozymeSubstrate (80 μm)PtdIns 3,4-P2PtdIns 3,4,5-P3Ratio of PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 to PtdIns 3,4-P2μmμm× 10 4PIP5KIαPtdIns 3-P0.340.015440PtdIns 3,4-P20.022.5PIP5KIIαPtdIns 3-P0.650.0065100PtdIns 3,4-P2ND2-aND, none detected.Reactions were carried out in 50 μl, and the product concentration at the end of the reaction is listed.

Reactions were for 10.5 min using 0.2 μg of PIP5KIα or 8 μg of PIP5KIIα. After TLC separation, the products were deacylated, and the glycerophosphorylinositol phosphate derivatives were determined by HPLC. These data were obtained using recombinant, E. coli-expressed PIP5K isoforms, but similar results were observed using native PIP5Ks from mammalian cells. PIP5KII purified from erythrocytes had similar activity to the PIP5KIIα presented above (data not shown). The ability of PIP5KIα to phosphorylate the 3-phosphate-containing lipids was validated by immunoprecipitation of the kinase from COS-7 cells. When COS-7 cell lysates were Western blotted with anti-PIP5KIα antibody, a single 68-kDa protein was detected, which was immunoprecipitated with the same antibody (Fig.3 A). The PIP5KIα was not immunoprecipitated using an IgG depleted of PIP5KIα reactivity (Fig. 3 A) or preimmune IgG (data not shown). The native PIP5KIα was able to phosphorylate both PtdIns 3-P and PtdIns 3,4-P2, and the activity toward the former was only 4-fold lower compared with PtdIns 4-P (Fig. 3 B). In addition, the production of PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 from PtdIns 3-P was also observed. The same pattern of phosphorylation of D3-phosphatidylinositols was observed using recombinant PIP5KIα and PIP5KIIα expressed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3, C and D). PIP5KIα and PIP5KIIα containing a FLAG epitope at their N termini were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells, immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, and assayed for activity using PtdIns 3-P, PtdIns 3,4-P2 and PtdIns 4-P. No PIP5K immunoreactivity (Fig.3 C) or activity (data not shown) was immunoprecipitated from the control transfected cells. The only difference between the PIP5Ks expressed in E. coli and mammalian cells was that the native and recombinant PIP5KIα expressed in COS cells had quantitatively greater activity toward PtdIns 3-P. Here we report that the PIP5K isozymes are kinases with dual substrate specificity. They can phosphorylate PtdIns 4-P on the adjacent D-5-position. They can also phosphorylate 3-phosphate-containing phosphatidylinositols including PtdIns 3-P and PtdIns 3,4-P2 on the adjacent D-4- or D-5-positions. None of the other characterized phosphatidylinositol kinases are known to have this ability. The uniqueness of these enzymes is further emphasized by the lack of sequence homology with known phosphatidylinositol, inositol phosphate, or protein kinases (15Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2881-2884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar,16Loijens J.C. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32937-32943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that the PIP5Ks have the in vivopotential to synthesize the signaling molecules PtdIns 3,4-P2 and PtdIns 3,4,5-P3, in addition to PtdIns 4,5-P2, as summarized in Fig. 4. This catalytic capacity was shown for both native and recombinant PIP5K isozymes. The production of both PtdIns 3,4-P2 and PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 when PtdIns 3-P is the initial substrate suggests that the product of the first reaction is retained on the enzyme and phosphorylated again in a concerted reaction. This result has important biological implications because it suggests an additional mechanism for PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 synthesis within cells. There is evidence in the literature that a platelet PtdIns 3-P 4-kinase activity is stimulated by the thrombin receptor and protein kinase C activation (7Yamamoto K. Lapetina E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 8Yamamoto K. Graziani A. Carpenter C. Cantley L.C. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6516-6524Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and, as the only currently identified PtdIns 3-P 4-kinase in platelets, is a likely candidate for that PtdIns 3-P 4-kinase activity. Based on all of the available data, PIP5KIIα has properties indistinguishable from the platelet PtdIns 3-P 4-kinase (7Yamamoto K. Lapetina E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 8Yamamoto K. Graziani A. Carpenter C. Cantley L.C. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol.

Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5861-5870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and could generate PtdIns 3,4-P2 involved in proliferation. The PIP5Ks could also be regulated by receptors that are known to stimulate PtdIns 3,4-P2 and PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 production upon agonist activation. As discussed previously, a pathway leading to synthesis of PtdIns 3,4-P2 and PtdIns 3,4,5-P3has been proposed to occur by phosphorylation of PtdIns 4,5-P2 by an agonist-activated 3-kinase (5Stephens L.R. Hughes K.T. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1991; 351: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). However, these arguments were based upon the observation that this PtdIns 3-kinase will phosphorylate all phosphoinositides lacking a phosphate in the D-3-position and that PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 appears to be the initial product. With the data presented here, an alternative pathway in which PtdIns is phosphorylated by PtdIns 3-kinase and then phosphorylated by a PIP5K isoform is plausible, and the concerted reaction could explain why PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 appears first. The PIP5Ks have the potential to produce three signaling molecules: PtdIns 4,5-P2, PtdIns 3,4-P2, and PtdIns 3,4,5-P3. It will be very interesting to determine if the substrate preferences of these PIP5K isozymes are altered by receptor activation or different regulators such as the small G-proteins Rac and Rho (23Tolias K.F.

Cell. 1996; 7: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that modulation of these activities will be both spatially and temporally regulated, and thus the PIP5K enzymes could participate in a plethora of cellular events by generating multiple messengers. Given the expanded substrate repertoire of these enzymes, we propose that they be designated as phosphatidylinositol phosphate 4/5-kinases. The pcDNA3-FLAG vectors were a gift of Dr. Jon Morrow (Yale University)."
https://openalex.org/W1583603147,"The role of sodium-calcium exchanger in calcium homeostasis in Bergmann glial cells in situ was investigated by monitoring cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]i) and sodium ([Na+]i) concentrations. The [Ca2+]i and [Na+]i transients were measured either separately by using fluorescent indicators fura-2 and SBFI, respectively, or simultaneously using the indicators fluo-3 and SBFI. Since the removal of extracellular Na+ induced a relatively small (approximately 50 nM) elevation of [Ca2+]i, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger seems to play a minor role in regulation of resting [Ca2+]i. In contrast, kainate-triggered [Ca2+]i increase was significantly suppressed by lowering of the extracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]o). In addition, manipulations with [Na+]o dramatically affected the recovery of the kainate-induced [Ca2+]i transients. Simultaneous recordings of [Ca2+]i and [Na+]i revealed that kainate-evoked [Ca2+]i transients were accompanied with an increase in [Na+]i. Moreover, kainate induced significantly larger [Ca2+]i and smaller [Na+]i transients under current-clamp conditions as compared to those recorded when the membrane voltage was clamped at -70 mV. The above results demonstrate that the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger is operative in Bergmann glial cells in situ and is able to modulate dynamically the amplitude and kinetics of [Ca2+]i signals associated with an activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors."

It is known to be directly phosphorylated on its α-subunit, but the functional effects of protein kinases remain controversial. We have developed a sensitive, antibody-based assay for detection of the level of phosphorylation of the α1-isoform of rat Na,K-ATPase at the serine residue that is most readily phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC)in vitro, Ser18. By stimulation of endogenous PKC and inhibition of phosphatase activity, it was possible to consistently obtain a very high stoichiometry of phosphorylation (close to 0.9) in several types of intact cells. This demonstrates the accessibility and competency of the site for endogenous phosphorylation. The cells used were derived from rat (NRK 52E, C6, L6, and primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells, representing epithelial cells, glia, muscle cells, and neurons). In the presence of the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A, full phosphorylation was preserved during subsequent assays of enzyme activity in vitro. Assay of the hydrolysis of ATP in NRK and C6 cells, however, indicated that there was no significant effect of phosphorylation on the V max of the Na,K-ATPase or on the apparent affinity for Na+. Any regulatory effect of PKC on sodium pump activity thus must be lost upon disruption or permeabilization of the cells and is not a direct consequence of enzyme alteration by covalent phosphorylation of Ser18.

The Na,K-ATPase is a membrane protein responsible for maintaining the electrochemical gradients of Na+ and K+ in almost all mammalian cells. Since many physiological events in the cells depend on the concentrations of these ions, the mechanisms regulating Na,K-ATPase activity are of great importance. Direct phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Na,K-ATPase by protein kinases and protein phosphatases have been proposed to be mechanisms for modulation of sodium pump work. Since many hormones are known to affect activities of protein kinases or phosphatases, the reversible phosphorylation of the Na,K-ATPase molecule may present a missing link between hormone action and changes in enzyme activity.

Methods Enzymol. 1974; 32: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), using the medulla from frozen kidneys obtained from PelFreez Biologicals (Rogers, AR). Enzyme preparations were stored in buffer containing 20 mmTris (pH 7.2), 320 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA. The specific activity of Na,K-ATPase was 1200 μmol/h/mg. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry using bovine serum albumin as a standard (19Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKC from rat brain was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH Biochemica (Germany). The PKC preparations used consist of α-, β-, and γ-isoforms (information provided by the supplier). Purified Na,K-ATPase at a concentration of 10–50 μg/ml was preincubated with PKC (1.5 μg/ml) for 3 min at 30 °C in buffer containing 10 mmTris phosphate (pH 7.4), 5 mm magnesium acetate, 500 μm CaCl2, 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma), and 80 μg/ml phosphatidyl serine (in a sonicated suspension) (Sigma, P7769). The reaction was started by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP (1800 cpm/pmol) to a final concentration 60 μm. Phosphorylation proceeded for 30 min at 30 °C and was stopped with an equal volume of electrophoresis sample buffer containing 125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and bromphenol blue (Laemmli sample buffer). Control samples were prepared the same way except that instead of PKC, an equal volume of PKC storage buffer (50% glycerol, 0.02% Tween 20, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) was added. Electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose were performed as described below. Phosphoproteins were visualized by overnight autoradiography of the dried nitrocellulose on Kodak XAR-5 film. Densitometry was performed with a Molecular Dynamics 300A laser densitometer. Electrophoresis was performed as described previously (20Sweadner K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1029: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), using 10% polyacrylamide and the Bio-Rad mini-ProteanII apparatus. Electrophoretic transfer of proteins was performed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 150 mm glycine, and 20% methanol at 0.15 A overnight. For immunostaining, nitrocellulose membranes were first blocked with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 150 mmNaCl and 0.5% Tween 20 (TBS-Tween) for 30–40 min at room temperature. Incubations with the primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were performed in the same buffer for 1.5 and 1 h, respectively. Membranes were extensively washed with TBS-Tween after each step and finally incubated with luminol reagent (Pierce). Membranes were then exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film for 0.5–20 min. Three different Na,K-ATPase antibodies were used in this study: monoclonal antibody McK1, which binds near the N terminus of the α1-subunit (21Felsenfeld D.P. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10932-10942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); monoclonal antibody 6F, which has an epitope approximately 40 amino acids away from the McK1 epitope (22Arystarkhova E. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23407-23417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); and polyclonal antiserum K1, which was raised against purified rat kidney Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit and is known to recognize polypeptide fragments from different parts of the molecule (N-terminal and C-terminal halves) (21Felsenfeld D.P. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10932-10942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Sweadner K.J. Gilkeson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9016-9022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All three antibodies demonstrated similar sensitivity (luminescence per unit of antigen) when used at the following dilutions: 1:5,000 for McK1, 1:400 for 6F, and 1:2,000 for K1. For sequential staining of the same blot, the monoclonal antibodies were stripped off by 30-min incubation in 10% acetic acid, 40% methanol and extensively washed with TBS-Tween. To assess the retention of antigen, blots were restained with 0.1% Amido Black. There was no significant loss of Na,K-ATPase after the stripping procedure. Antibody 6F was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Iowa City, IA). Three rat cell lines (NRK-52E (normal rat kidney), C6 glioma, and L6 skeletal muscle myoblasts) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics (100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. NRK and C6 cells were used in phosphorylation experiments immediately upon reaching 90–100% confluence. L6 cells were allowed to fuse and form myotubes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum for 7–10 days. It should be noted that the 52E subclone of NRK has an epithelial phenotype and is different from the NRK fibroblastic subclone commonly used in virology (24De Larco J.E. Todaro G.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1978; 94: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Primary neuronal cultures were prepared from the cerebellum of 7-day-old rats as described (25Peng L. Juurlink B.H.J. Hertz L. Dev. Brain Res. 1991; 63: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In brief, 10 cerebelli were cleaned of meninges, chopped with razor blades, and then treated with 0.025% (w/v) trypsin for 10 min in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. The reaction was stopped by adding 2% fetal bovine serum. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 30 mmglucose, and 24.5 mm KCl. The cell suspension was filtered through a mesh with a pore size of 75 μm (Falcon cell strainer) and seeded onto polylysine-coated 35-mm tissue culture dishes (Falcon). After 15 min at 37 °C, the medium containing unattached cells was removed, and fresh medium was added. To prevent proliferation of nonneuronal cells, cytosine arabinoside (10 μm) was added to the culture medium 24 h after seeding. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere for 7–8 days prior to phosphorylation experiments. Monolayers of the cells grown in 35- or 60-mm tissue culture dishes were preincubated for 1.5–2 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere in Puck's buffer (Sigma) supplemented with 0.25 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 1 mmNaH2PO4, 22 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm Hepes. Then drugs (PMA, calyculin A) or their vehicle (ethanol) were added at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends, and the cells were incubated for 20–30 min at 37 °C. The buffer was discarded, and dishes with the attached cells were immediately placed on ice. 0.2–0.5 ml of 100 °C 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1% SDS was then added to each dish. The cells were scraped and clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 40,000 rpm at 10 °C. Supernatants were collected, diluted 1:1 with Laemmli sample buffer, and loaded on gels. Intact cells were incubated to enhance phosphorylation as described above. After the incubation buffer was discarded, 1–2 ml of ice-cold hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm Tris phosphate (pH 7.2), 5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 nm calyculin A was added to each dish. Dishes were incubated on ice for 15–20 min and then scraped, homogenized, and centrifuged for 30 min at 40,000 rpm, 4 °C. The supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were washed once in the same hypotonic buffer. The final pellets were resuspended in buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 320 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 nm calyculin A. First, the test tube assay for the hydrolysis of ATP was performed as described (17Feschenko M.S. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30436-30444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The released 32Pi was quantified by the formation of a phosphomolybdate complex. The reaction was started by the addition of 20–40 μg of NRK or C6 membranes in 0.5 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 3 mm MgCl2, 3 mm NaATP, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm NaN3, 115 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, and 100 nm calyculin A, with or without 2 mm ouabain. The reaction proceeded for 15–20 min at 37 °C and then was stopped with 0.5 ml of quenching solution (1n sulfuric acid, 0.5% ammonium molybdate). Then 1 ml of isobutanol was added, and the phosphomolybdate complex was extracted into the organic phase by 10 s of vortex mixing, followed by separation of phases by centrifugation in a table top centrifuge. Aliquots of the upper phase were counted with a scintillation counter. Second, a spectrophotometric assay in which the generation of ADP is coupled to the oxidation of NADH and monitored continuously by absorbance at 340 nm was performed as described (17Feschenko M.S. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30436-30444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that 3 mm sodium azide and 100 nm calyculin A were present in the assay medium. Third, determination of total Na,K-ATPase activity in perforated cultured cells was performed as described (26Xie Z.J. Wang Y.H. Ganjeizadeh M. McGee Jr., R. Askari A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). After phosphorylation, monolayers of cells were washed briefly with 10 mm Tris-EGTA (pH 7.4) containing 100 nmcalyculin A and placed in the same solution with the addition of 0.03 mg/ml of alamethicin. The cells were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, scraped, and homogenized briefly with a Dounce homogenizer (loose pestle) to disperse the cells, and 50-μl aliquots were used in activity assays (approximately 50–100 μg of total protein/aliquot). The assay was performed as described above for the test tube assay. Previously, we showed that phosphorylation of Na,K-ATPase by PKC occurs at two sites on the N terminus of the rat α1-subunit: Ser11 and Ser18 (Fig. 1) (11Feschenko M.S. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14072-14077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). A total stoichiometry of 0.9 mol/mol was found for rat α1 when purified enzyme was incubated with purified kinase. Direct sequencing of phosphorylated protein showed that 75–80% of the phosphate incorporated was bound to Ser18 and only 20–25% to Ser11. The conclusion was that Ser18 is the main PKC phosphorylation site in rat, and neither of the sites was fully phosphorylated, unless some preexisting, stable phosphorylation interfered with the incorporation of 32P. Interestingly, Ser18 is absent in Na,K-ATPase α-subunit sequences from many other species; that was shown to be the reason for much lower levels of phosphorylation (0.15 mol/mol) in pig and dog α1-subunits.Figure 1N-terminal sequences of Na,K-ATPase α-subunits in different species. All serines and threonines areunderlined. For rat, dog, and pig α1, the numbering starts at glycine, since the first five amino acids are known to be removed during biosynthesis. Note that not all investigators follow this numbering convention, and hence for rat α1, Ser11 is the same residue as Ser16 in some papers, and Ser18is the same residue as Ser23. Each boldface P above the sequences indicates a PKC phosphorylation site in rat α1 (11Feschenko M.S. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14072-14077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The horizontal barshows the epitope for monoclonal antibody McK1 (DKKSKK) (21Felsenfeld D.P. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10932-10942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Arystarkhova E. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23407-23417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Earlier, monoclonal antibody McK1 was found to bind to the amino acid sequence DKKSKK, which includes Ser18 (Fig. 1) (21Felsenfeld D.P. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10932-10942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Arystarkhova E. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23407-23417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This antibody does not recognize Na,K-ATPase from pig and dog, which have the shorter sequence DKKK at that location. Since the McK1 epitope and the major site for PKC phosphorylation include the same amino acid residues, we hypothesized that phosphorylation of Ser18might affect McK1 binding, making it possible for this antibody to probe the level of PKC phosphorylation of Na,K-ATPase in cell cultures and tissues. As shown in Fig. 2 below, this is successful under appropriate experimental conditions. First, experiments were performed to assess the sensitivity and linearity of antibody signals from McK1 and two antibodies used as controls. Since Na,K-ATPase is not very abundant in cell cultures, a high sensitivity method is required to detect antigen-antibody binding. Horseradish peroxidase-luminol staining of Western blots is known to be several orders of magnitude more sensitive than traditional staining with colorigenic substrates, and it is possible to scan the images obtained to quantify and compare their optical densities. Caution is needed in using this method for quantifying the amount of antigen in different samples. The limitations of the assay are imposed both by the luminescent method itself and by the binding characteristics of the antibody. At higher concentrations of antigen the luminescent signal becomes nonlinear and finally reaches a plateau (due either to exhaustion of luminol reagent or x-ray film saturation), while at lower antigen concentrations it may drop abruptly below the detection level. There is a linear zone that can be shifted by adjusting the time of exposure of the blot to x-ray film. We found that if the amounts of antigen in samples differ more than 3-fold, accurate quantitation is not possible unless calibration curves are made in each experiment. Since cell cultures contain only small amounts of Na,K-ATPase, such samples are more likely to face the problem of having the signal below detection level rather than reaching saturation. To test whether the McK1 antibody can be used to detect PKC phosphorylation, we compared binding of the antibody to phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated Na,K-ATPase (Fig. 2 A). Three different concentrations of purified rat kidney Na,K-ATPase were used. Na,K-ATPase was incubated in phosphorylation buffer with (lanes 4–6) or without (lanes 1–3) exogenous PKC and [γ-32P]ATP. Samples were subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Phosphoproteins were visualized by autoradiography and then immunostained with monoclonal antibody McK1 using the horseradish peroxidase-luminol method. Phosphorylation of Na,K-ATPase by PKC dramatically decreased the binding of McK1 antibody. Thus, Ser18 is an important amino acid residue in the McK1 epitope, and covalent modification by phosphorylation prevents antibody binding. The assay is consequently based on detecting how much unmodified Ser18 is left after PKC phosphorylation. Incorporation of 32P as detected by scintillation counting was linear at all concentrations of Na,K-ATPase used (not shown), while32P autoradiography (not shown) and McK1 binding (Fig.2 B) deviated at higher antigen concentration. Since the signal for the phosphorylated sample in lane 4 of Fig.2 A (“unknown”) fell in the linear zone of the McK1 binding curve, we were able to calculate the amount of unmodified Na,K-ATPase in this sample. The result was 0.13 μg, which is 26% of the 0.5 μg used in the phosphorylation experiment. These data correlate very well with our previous finding that approximately 75% of Ser18 becomes modified after PKC phosphorylationin vitro (11Feschenko M.S. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14072-14077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). PKC Phosphorylation in Intact Cells—To assess the generality of our findings, four different types of rat cells were used in this study: 1) NRK (clone 52E); 2) C6 glioma; 3) L6 skeletal muscle myotubes; and 4) primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons. All of these cells express the α1-isoform of Na,K-ATPase. PKC phosphorylation was determined by quantifying McK1 binding relative to control antibody. Intact cells were incubated with or without protein kinase and phosphatase modulators. Fig. 3 Ashows the result of an experiment with NRK cells. Treatment of the cells with PMA significantly decreased McK1 binding, while the combination of PMA and the protein phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A practically abolished it, meaning that most of the Na,K-ATPase became phosphorylated at Ser18. Calyculin A alone was ineffective, suggesting that in the absence of stimuli, the activity of PKC in the NRK cell line is low. Prolonged treatment with PMA (24 h), which is known to down-regulate PKC, did not change the basal level of Na,K-ATPase phosphorylation (results not shown). 6F binding was unaffected by any of the treatments, as expected from the observation that its epitope is approximately 40 amino acids away (22Arystarkhova E. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23407-23417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Fig.3 B summarizes the results of phosphorylation experiments with all four cell culture types. Binding of McK1 antibody was normalized to binding of 6F or K1 antibody. PMA treatment alone increased phosphorylation of Na,K-ATPase in NRK and C6 cells (as detected by the loss of McK1 binding). It was less effective in cerebellar neurons and practically ineffective in L6 cells. The combination of PMA and calyculin A caused a dramatic increase in the phosphorylation level of Na,K-ATPase in all four types of cell culture. The effect of calyculin A in potentiating the effect of PMA on the level of phosphorylation of Ser18 showed that protein phosphatases are very active in the cell cultures tested. Treatment of intact cells with 1 μm PMA alone was able to bring about 50% phosphorylation of Na,K-ATPase at most. Attempts to increase phosphorylation by raising the concentration of PMA up to 10 μm and/or prolonging the incubation time were unsuccessful (results not shown). The combination of 1 μmPMA with 100 nm calyculin A caused 70–90% PKC phosphorylation of Ser18 in all experiments. The level of phosphorylation was unaffected by a 10-fold decrease in PMA concentration, indicating that PKC was fully activated at the lower PMA concentration (0.1 μm), while the same decrease in calyculin A concentration (final concentration, 10 nm) resulted in 15–20% loss of phosphorylation (data not shown). Thus, to reach the highest level of phosphorylation, the activity of protein phosphatases must be controlled with an appropriate concentration of phosphatase inhibitor. Another major concern is retention of the phosphate introduced by PKC. To study the functional consequences of phosphorylation it is important both to obtain the highest level of phosphorylation possible and to preserve the phosphorylation during subsequent experimental manipulations. The stability of PKC phosphorylation in perforated C6 cells and membrane preparations isolated from NRK and C6 cells was investigated in the conditions of ATPase activity assays. We found that in ATPase activity assay medium in the absence of calyculin A, almost complete dephosphorylation of the Ser18 site occurred after 15–30 min of incubation at 37 °C (Fig.4 A). The presence of 100 nm of calyculin A throughout the assay prevented dephosphorylation (Fig.4 B). The result indicates that activity of protein phosphatase in the cells tested is very high and is not removed during cell permeabilization or membrane isolation. It can be seen that there was little change in the phosphorylation level of the control samples; this was true of both cell lines, further supporting the conclusion that both have similar, low levels of basal phosphorylation. Two different kinds of preparations were used in activity experiments: C6 cells perforated with alamethicin by the method of Askari and co-workers (26Xie Z.J. Wang Y.H. Ganjeizadeh M. McGee Jr., R. Askari A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and membrane preparations isolated from cultured C6 and NRK cells. Intact cells were incubated with 1 μm PMA and 100 nm calyculin A (phosphorylated samples) or with calyculin A only (controls), and all of the subsequent"
https://openalex.org/W2134757872,"Despite good evidence for p53 dysfunction in human hepatocellular carcinomas, little is known of the significance of p53 to normal hepatocytes and whether p53 dysfunction is relevant to early hepatocarcinogenesis. We have therefore examined the consequences of targeted p53 deficiency in hepatocytes for regulation of apoptosis, proliferation, and ploidy. p53 deficiency was silent in normal liver and did not affect progression from diploidy to polyploidy in the aging liver. However, in primary culture the absence of p53 resulted in increased hepatocyte proliferation indices and decreased sensitivity to proliferation inhibition by TGFbeta. Moreover, p53-deficient cells continued to survive and proliferate under conditions of minimal trophic support that led to growth arrest and apoptosis of wild-type cells. In vivo, p53-deficient mice had enhanced proliferative responses to both xenobiotic hepatomitogen and CCl4-induced liver necrosis, although lack of persistent proliferation showed that other control mechanisms are important. There was no simple relationship between p53 and apoptosis after DNA damage because UV irradiation led to p53-independent apoptosis, even though p53 was stabilized. However, p53 did couple DNA damage to growth arrest, and abnormal mitoses after gamma-irradiation of regenerating p53 null livers demonstrated circumstances where loss of G1 and G2 checkpoints may generate abnormal ploidy. Thus p53 becomes important when hepatocytes are released from G0 and stressed, sensitizing them to mitogen and cytokine regulators of cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Hence p53 deficiency is likely to be significant in an environment of persistent regenerative stimuli and unfavorable trophic support or in the presence of other enabling genetic lesions. This model is relevant to human hepatocarcinogenesis, which almost always occurs against a background of chronic hepatocellular destruction in hepatitis and cirrhosis. In that context, by reducing the need for cytokine support and disabling DNA damage-induced growth arrest, p53 deficiency should facilitate the expansion of preneoplastic clones in chronic liver disease."

Polymorphonuclear neutrophils constitute the first line of host defense against many pathogenic bacteria and fungi. Their ability to kill invading microorganisms depends to a large extent on reactive oxygen intermediates generated by the phagocyte NADPH oxidase (1Clark R.A. J. Infect.

As a general rule, the full complement of oxidase constituents is expressed only in phagocytic cells of the myeloid lineage, although exceptions have been noted. The gp91 phox subunit of the cytochrome was found to be myeloid-specific, whereas p22 phox is widely expressed, but not incorporated into membranes in the absence of the large subunit (11Parkos C.A.

Early studies on p47 phox and p67 phox showed expression restricted to neutrophils, other phagocytes, and B lymphocytes (12Volpp B.D. Nauseef W.M. Clark R.A.

J. 1993; 296: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Rac1 and Rac2, on the other hand, are widely expressed (15Didsbury J. Weber R.F. Bokoch G.M. Evans T. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16378-16382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Systems or individual components similar to the phagocyte NADPH oxidase have been described in a number of other types of cells, including human fibroblasts (16Meier B. Cross A.R. Hancock J.T.

Physiol. 1996; 271: H1626-H1634PubMed Google Scholar) endothelial cells. In at least some cases, these systems are not identical to the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. For example, the cytochrome b component in fibroblasts was reported to be structurally and genetically distinct from that in phagocytes (17Meier B. Jesaitis A.J. Emmendörffer A. Roesler J. Quinn M.T. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Moreover, the functional status of these non-phagocyte oxidase systems has not always been clear, as for instance in the case of human endothelial cells, which express the oxidase components at the transcript and protein levels, but lack the cytochrome bheme spectrum (24Jones S.A. O'Donnell V.B. Wood J.D. Broughton J.P. Hughes E.J. Jones O.T.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H1626-H1634PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, current evidence indicates that p22 phox and the Rac proteins are widely expressed, whereas the other oxidase components are expressed selectively, although not exclusively in myeloid phagocytic cells. Transcriptional regulation of NADPH oxidase components has been described in most detail for the gp91 phox subunit of cytochromeb (25Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lievens P.M.J. Donady J.J. Tufarelli C. Neufeld E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12745-12750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The distal promoter region contains a CCAAT box motif that binds the transcription factor CP1. However, this interaction is prevented by a CCAAT displacement protein that binds to the region surrounding the CCAAT box, thereby repressing transcription. Down-regulation of the repressor appears to be required for expression of gp91 phox . Specific factors involved in the transcription of other components of NADPH oxidase have not been characterized. We have focused on the regulation of expression of p47 phox, an essential cytosolic component of the phagocyte oxidase. In general, immature myeloid cells express little or no p47 phox, whereas during differentiation transcripts and protein are induced in parallel with the acquisition of superoxide-generating activity (13Rodaway A.R.F.

To understand better these complex events, we have initiated studies of transcriptional regulation of the p47 phox gene by cloning, sequencing, and functionally characterizing its promoter. Here we report that the region of the first 86 base pairs of thep47 phox gene 5′-flanking sequence possess tissue-specific promoter activity in myeloid cells. The myeloid transcription factor PU.1 is absolutely required for this function. RPMI 1640 was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. and Serum Plus™ medium supplement from JRH Biosciences (Lenexa, KS). Restriction enzymes, T4 polynucleotide kinase, RNasin, avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, and pGL3-Basic luciferase vector and the luciferase assay kit were from Promega (Madison, WI). [γ-32P]ATP, 6000 Ci/mmol, was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. The TA Cloning Kit (containing the pCRII vector) for cloning products of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; kb, kilobase pair(s); M-CSFR, macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor; nt, nucleotide(s); TBP, TATA-binding protein; TSS, transcriptional start site; DTT, dithiothreitol; PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid). was obtained from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Advanced DNA Technology Unit, University of Texas Health Science Center. The Sequenase DNA sequencing kit was obtained from U. S. Biochemical Corp. PU.1 and PEA3 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from HL-60 cells using oligo(dT)-cellulose (FastTrack Kit, Invitrogen). A reverse oligonucleotide primer corresponding to nt 43–19 of the cDNA sequence (33Volpp B.D. Nauseef W.M. Donelson J.E. Moser D.R. Clark R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7195-7199Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and 5 × 105 counts co-precipitated with 2.5 μg of HL-60 poly(A)+ RNA and 15 μg of the total RNA. Primer-RNA hybridization was carried out overnight at 42 °C in 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.4, 1 mm EDTA, 400 mmNaCl, and 80% deionized formamide. Following precipitation and washing in ethanol, the primer-RNA complex was dissolved in H2O and reverse transcribed by incubating with 40 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase at 42 °C for 90 min in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm spermidine, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.6 mm each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, and 40 units of RNasin. The product was then digested with 40 ng of RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min, phenol/chloroform-extracted, precipitated in ethanol, and separated on a sequencing gel. On the same gel a standard dideoxy sequencing reaction using the same oligonucleotide primer and the plasmid containing ∼1.2 kb of p47 phox genomic sequence as template was also separated for identification of the bases corresponding to the transcription start site (TSS). Autoradiography using Kodak X-Omat film was carried out at −70 °C. Thep47 phox 5′-flanking region was cloned by using the PromoterFinder Kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR was performed using the human genomic libraries provided as templates to amplify the desired sequences. The forward primer was complementary to the adaptor ligated to the genomic DNA fragments in each library. The reverse primer (5′-CTGGGTACGAAGCGCTTCTCAAAGC-3′, see Fig. 1) corresponded to bp 75–50 of the p47 phox cDNA. The amplified products were analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel and then subjected to the second PCR with nested primers. The reverse primer (5′-GGGCGATGTGACGGATGAAGGTGTC-3′) used corresponded to bp 43–19 of the cDNA. The final PCR products were cloned directly into the pCRII vector and their identities confirmed by sequencing. Nucleotide sequencing was carried out in both directions using the dideoxy termination procedure and sequence-specific oligonucleotide primers.Figure 3Characterization of the functional promoter of the p47 phox gene. Log phase HL-60 cell cultures were transfected with the indicated constructs. Allp47 phox constructs extended from the indicated residue of the promoter (i.e. −3050, −2151, −1392, −1217, −224, −86, −46, or −36) downstream to residue +52. Luciferase activity was determined 48 h post-transfection and reported relative to the base-line activity of the promoterless construct (pGL3-Basic). Values were corrected for transcription efficiency by co-transfection of a β-galactosidase expression plasmid. Data (mean ± S.E.) shown are from at least five independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 1Sequence analysis of thep47 phox promoter.

The promoter regions excised by digestion with XhoI and HindIII from the pCRII-p47 phox clones were subcloned into promoterless luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-Basic at the same restriction sites. The constructs generated, the inserts of which all go downstream to +52 relative to the TSS of thep47 phox gene, use the p47 phox translation initiation codon ligated in-frame to the luciferase open reading frame. For deletion construction PCR was done using the plasmid construct pGL3-p47 phox -1217 (i.e. from −1217 relative to the TSS, downstream to +52 followed by the luciferase open reading frame) as template, a luciferase antisense oligonucleotide (pGLprimer2, CTTTATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTCC) as the reverse primer and oligonucleotides synthesized with an XhoI restriction site linked to the desired 5′ terminus of the p47 phox promoter as the forward primers. The PCR-amplified products were digested with XhoI and HindIII and ligated toXhoI/HindIII-digested pGL3-Basic. For PU.1 binding site mutation, we used a site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuikChange, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutagenic primer (with altered nucleotides underlined) was 5′-CAAAAGCGACTTGGTGTTTCCAGTGC-3′. The constructs were confirmed by restriction mapping and sequencing. The human promyelocytic cell line HL-60 was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% Serum Plus and 10 mm HEPES. For 1 day prior to transfection and after transfection, the cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The human monocyte cell line THP-1, the promonocyte cell line U937, and the myeloid leukemia cell line PLB-985 were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Two non-myeloid cell lines, the human cervical carcinoma epithelial cell line HeLa and the transformed human embryonic kidney cell HEK293, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All media contained penicillin and streptomycin. The cells were maintained at a density of about 5 × 105 cells/ml. Transfection was carried out by electroporation. Briefly, cells were resuspended in medium containing 20 μg of the luciferase reporter constructs and 4 μg of a cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase vector (pCMV-β-gal) as a transfection efficiency control. Electroporation was accomplished at 960 microfarads and 250 V. At 48 h the cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, lysed in 100 μl of 1 × reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at ambient temperature, and 20-μl aliquots of the supernatants were tested in the luciferase assay system (Promega) using a Turner TD-20e luminometer. β-Galactosidase was assayed using a microassay procedure (34Rouet P. Raguenez G. Salier J.P. Biotechniques. 1992; 13: 700-701PubMed Google Scholar) and standardized with purified β-galactosidase (Sigma). The mouse PU.1 cDNA (a gift of Dr. M. Klemsz, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN) was excised by digestion with EcoRI and then inserted into pBluescript SK. A clone with the desired orientation was transcribed and translatedin vitro using T3 RNA polymerase and the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The synthesized [35S]methionine-PU.1 was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. A predominant band of approximately 38 kDa was observed, consistent with the molecular mass previously reported (35Himmelmann A. Thevenin C. Harrison K. Kehrl J.H. Blood. 1996; 87: 1036-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The control un-programmed sample (i.e. no cDNA) gave no corresponding band. HL-60 cells were disrupted by cavitation using a technique described previously for polymorphonuclear neutrophils (36Borregaard N. Heiple J.M. Simons E.R. Clark R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). The cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, resuspended in 10 ml of cold relaxation buffer (100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.3), and 3.5 μl of diisopropyl fluorophosphate (Sigma) were added. The cells were kept on ice for 10 min, then centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of relaxation buffer and pressurized in N2 at 350 p.s.i. for 20 min in a nitrogen bomb (Parr Instrument Co., Moline, IL) and released into 750 μl of a solution containing 20 mm EGTA, 100 mm MgCl2, 20 mm DTT, 4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mmsodium orthovanadate. The cavitated cells were centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the nucleus-enriched pellet resuspended and further purified on a discontinuous gradient of sucrose (0.3 m/0.88 m). The nuclear fraction was extracted in ∼100 μl of urea extraction buffer (1.1 mmurea, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 0.05 mm EDTA, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.9) and microcentrifuged. The supernatant was collected and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Plasmid constructs were linearized with MluI and end-labeled with [α-32P]CTP and Klenow DNA polymerase. The insert was then excised by digestion with HindIII and gel-purified. The nuclear extract was preincubated for 30 min on ice in 50 μl of buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 2 μg poly-d(I-C). The labeled DNA (∼100,000 cpm) was then added, and the incubation was continued at 25 °C. After 15 min, 5 μl each of 50 mmMgCl2, 10 mm CaCI2, and diluted DNase I were added. The incubation was continued for 1 min prior to the addition of 100 μl of stop solution (0.375% SDS, 15 mmEDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6). Calf thymus DNA (10 μg) and proteinase K (20 μg) were added and the mixture incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, then 95 °C for 5 min, and phenol/chloroform-extracted and ethanol-precipitated. Finally, the DNA was separated on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, using Maxam-Gilbert G+A sequencing reactions of the labeled fragments as the markers. Complementary DNA oligonucleotides were annealed by heating in 1 × NET at 95 °C for 5 min and cooling at ambient temperature. Probes were then labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. For gel shift assays nuclear extract (6 μg) was incubated for 20 min at ambient temperature with 5 × 104 cpm of the labeled DNA probe in 20 μl of binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 2 μg of poly-d(I-C). For supershift assays, 2 μg of specific antibody was added and the reaction continued for 15 min. Samples were loaded on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, and electrophoresis was carried out at 200 V in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.5, with 190 mm glycerol and 1 mm EDTA. Competition assays were carried out in the same manner, except that the above reaction mixture was preincubated with competitor DNA for 10 min at 4 °C before addition of the labeled probe. Thep47 phox promoter region was cloned using the PromoterFinder kit (CLONTECH). The nested reverse primers for the first and second round PCR (see Fig. 1) were derived from the p47 phox cDNA to obtain the specific products. The PCR products amplified from 4 of 5 human sub-genomic libraries appeared as single bands, each of a different size (3.0, 2.2, 1.4, and 1.2 kb), on agarose gels. These products were cloned into the pCRII vector and their identification verified by direct sequence continuity of the 3′ ends with the 5′ portion ofp47 phox cDNA. Fig. 1 shows the complete sequence of the longest clone. This 5′-flanking region, like the promoters of other myeloid-specific genes such as CD11b andCD18 (37Pahl H.L. Rosmarin A.G. Tenen D.G. Blood. 1992; 79: 865-870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Rosmarin A.G. Levy R. Tenen D.G. Blood. 1992; 79: 2598-2604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), lacks a proximal authentic CAAT or TATA box, but the sequence TTTAA at −28 relative to the TSS (see below), flanked on both sides by G+C-rich sequences, has some similarity to the most common consensus sequence TATAAAA. Moreover, the initiator sequence, which appears to direct the site of initiation and basal level of transcription in many TATA-less promoters (39Weis L. Reinberg D. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), was not present. However, sequence motifs were found in the p47 phox promoter that correspond to binding sites of a number of known transcription factors. These include several purine-rich elements of the type that bind to the ets family of transcription factors. One of them, located at bp −45, is identical to the binding site for PU.1, a factor required for terminal myeloid gene expression and differentiation (40Simon M.C. Olson M. Scott E. Hack A. Su G. Singh H. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 211: 113-119PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple binding sites are noted for GATA-1, a critical transcription factor in the development of hematopoietic cells (41Orkin S.H. Blood. 1992; 80: 575-581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and for Sp1, which is essential for myeloid-specificCD11b promoter activity (42Chen H.-M. Pahl H.L. Scheibe R.J. Zhang D.-E. Tenen D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8230-8239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At bp −2194 is a c-Myb binding site, which is present and functional in the neutrophil elastase gene. c-Myb also cooperates with avian C/EBPβ to activate the mim-1 and lysozyme genes in myeloid cells (43Mink S. Kerber U. Klempnauer K.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1316-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 44Friedman A.D. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 211: 149-157PubMed Google Scholar). PEBP2/CBF binds to and regulates the murine myeloperoxidase gene proximal enhancer (45Zhang D.-E. Fujioka K. Hetherington C.J. Shapiro L.H. Chen H.-M. Look A.T. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8085-8095Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and activates an early myeloid gene, the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR) (44Friedman A.D. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 211: 149-157PubMed Google Scholar). A similar binding site is found at bp −63 of the p47 phox promoter. To prove that we had, indeed, isolated thep47 phox 5′-promoter region, we next determined the start site of transcription by primer extension. Poly(A)+RNA was extracted from Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells, which express increased levels of p47 phox . The RNA was annealed to a32P-labeled oligonucleotide complementary to nt 43–19 of the published cDNA sequence (33Volpp B.D. Nauseef W.M. Donelson J.E. Moser D.R. Clark R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7195-7199Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and then reverse-transcribed. The extension products are displayed alongside p47 phox antisense sequence generated with the same oligonucleotide primer (Fig.2). We identified a single predominant TSS, corresponding to an adenine residue (thymidine on the antisense strand) located 21 nt 5′ of the translation initiation site (and 52 nt 5′ of the primer). This result was confirmed by ribonuclease protection analysis (data not shown). This location maps to within one nucleotide of a previously reported p47 phox TSS (13Rodaway A.R.F. Teahan C.G.

https://openalex.org/W2000551500,"Stress-activated signal transduction pathways, which are largely conserved among a broad spectrum of eukaryotic species, have a crucial role in the survival of many forms of stress. It is therefore important to discover how these pathways are both positively and negatively regulated. Recent genetic studies have implicated protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) as a novel negative regulator of stress response pathways in both budding and fission yeasts. Moreover, it was hypothesized that PP2C dephosphorylates one or more components of protein kinase cascades that are at the core of stress-activated signal transduction pathways. Herein we present genetic and biochemical studies of the fission yeastSchizosaccharomyces pombe that disprove this hypothesis and indicate that PP2C instead negatively regulates a downstream element of the pathway. First, high expression of PP2C produces phenotypes that are inconsistent with negative regulation of the Wik1-Wis1-Spc1 stress-activated kinase cascade. Second, high expression of PP2C leads to sustained activating tyrosine phosphorylation of Spc1. Third, Spc1-dependent phosphorylation of Atf1, a transcription factor substrate of Spc1, is unaffected by high expression of PP2C. Fourth, high expression of PP2C suppresses Atf1-dependent transcription of a stress-response gene. These studies strongly suggest that PP2C acts downstream of Spc1 kinase in the stress-activated signal transduction pathway.

Second, high expression of PP2C leads to sustained activating tyrosine phosphorylation of Spc1. Third, Spc1-dependent phosphorylation of Atf1, a transcription factor substrate of Spc1, is unaffected by high expression of PP2C. Fourth, high expression of PP2C suppresses Atf1-dependent transcription of a stress-response gene. These studies strongly suggest that PP2C acts downstream of Spc1 kinase in the stress-activated signal transduction pathway. Eukaryotic organisms frequently encounter environmental conditions that cause cytotoxic damage; hence, they have developed sophisticated systems of sensing and responding to physiological stress. Protein kinase cascades are at the core of these stress sensor pathways (1Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). These cascades follow the paradigm established for mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKK, MAP kinase; MAPKKK, MAP kinase kinase; PP2C, protein phosphatase 2C; EMM2, Edinburgh minimal medium; Ni2+-NTA, Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid; HA, hemagglutinin; Ha6H, hemagglutinin antigen epitope and six histidines; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase. 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKK, MAP kinase; MAPKKK, MAP kinase kinase; PP2C, protein phosphatase 2C; EMM2, Edinburgh minimal medium; Ni2+-NTA, Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid; HA, hemagglutinin; Ha6H, hemagglutinin antigen epitope and six histidines; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase. cascades: a MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) phosphorylates a MAPK kinase (MAPKK), which in turn phosphorylates a MAPK. The MAPKKK and MAPK components are serine-threonine kinases, whereas MAPKKs are dual specificity enzymes, activating MAPK substrates by phosphorylating threonine and tyrosine residues in a conserved motif (2Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). It is not understood why protein kinase cascades are used to transmit stress signals, although it is likely that the spatial distribution of the cascade elements facilitates rapid signaling from the cell surface to the nucleus where MAPK homologs phosphorylate transcription factor substrates.Recent studies have revealed impressive functional and structural conservation of stress response pathways in yeast, plants, and various metazoan species, including humans (3Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The fission yeastSchizosaccharomyces pombe has been focus of some of the most interesting investigations, in part because studies of fission yeast have uncovered a link between stress response pathways and cell cycle control (4Millar J.B.A. Buck V. Wilkinson M.G. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 5Shiozaki K. Russell P. Nature. 1995; 378: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The S. pombe stress-activated kinase cascade consists of Wik1-Wis1-Spc1 kinases (6Shiozaki K. Shiozaki M. Russell P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The Spc1 MAPK homolog, which is also known as Sty1 and Phh1 (4Millar J.B.A. Buck V. Wilkinson M.G. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 7Kato T.J. Okazaki K. Murakami H. Stettler S. Fantes P.A. Okayama H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), is highly similar to mammalian p38 kinases (8Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2401) Google Scholar) and Hog1p kinase of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (9Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). Like p38 kinase, Spc1 is broadly responsive to many forms of stress, including high osmolarity, oxidative stress, UV irradiation, and heat stress, as well as carbon and nitrogen starvation (4Millar J.B.A. Buck V. Wilkinson M.G. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 5Shiozaki K. Russell P. Nature. 1995; 378: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 10Degols G.

Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Recent investigations have further revealed that mammalian p38 and fission yeast Spc1 share similar substrates. In the case of Spc1, the substrate is Atf1, a transcription factor containing a bZIP (basic leucine zipper) domain. Remarkably, Atf1 is highly similar to ATF-2, a mammalian transcription factor that is widely believed to be an important substrate of p38 kinase in vivo (11Shiozaki K. Russell P. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 12Wilkinson M.G. Samuels M. Takeda T. Toone W.M. Shieh J.-C. Toda T. Millar J.B.A. Jones N. Genes & Dev. 1996; 18: 2289-2301Crossref Scopus (307) Google Scholar).It is evident that fission and budding yeasts can serve as useful model systems for uncovering novel modes of regulation of stress-activated protein kinase cascades. This accounts for the interest in recent studies suggesting that stress-activated kinase cascades in yeast are negatively regulated by two types of protein phosphatases: tyrosine-specific enzymes (4Millar J.B.A. Buck V. Wilkinson M.G. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 5Shiozaki K. Russell P. Nature. 1995; 378: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 10Degols G. Shiozaki K. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2870-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and serine-threonine phosphatases of the type 2C class (PP2C) (5Shiozaki K. Russell P. Nature. 1995; 378: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 13Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Evidence for a role of tyrosine-specific phosphatases in the negative regulation of stress-activated kinase cascades first arose from genetic studies ofS. cerevisiae. The gene PTP2 was cloned as a high copy suppressor of mutations that cause lethality due to hyperactivation of the Hog1p kinase cascade. High expression ofPTP2 results in decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of Hog1p, a finding consistent with the conclusion that Ptp2p directly dephosphorylates Hog1p in vivo (13Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Ptp2p is assumed to be a tyrosine-specific enzyme because it is more closely related to tyrosine-specific phosphatases than to dual specificity tyrosine/threonine phosphatases that have been identified as MAPK phosphatases in mammalian cells, although the enzymatic specificity of Ptp2p has not been examined. In the case of S. pombe, a critical advance was made with the discovery that the synthetic lethal phenotype observed in a strain lacking two tyrosine phosphatase genes,pyp1 and pyp2, was effectively suppressed by null mutations in genes encoding elements of the Wis1-Spc1 kinase cascade. Moreover, the stress-sensitive and G2 cell cycle delay phenotypes exhibited by spc1 and wis1 mutants were replicated by high expression of Pyp1 and Pyp2 enzymes (4Millar J.B.A. Buck V. Wilkinson M.G. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 5Shiozaki K. Russell P. Nature. 1995; 378: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). These genetic studies were followed by definitive biochemical findings showing that Pyp1 and Pyp2 directly dephosphorylated tyrosine 173 of Spc1 both in vivo and in vitro (5Shiozaki K. Russell P. Nature. 1995; 378: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 10Degols G. Shiozaki K. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2870-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Interestingly, pyp2 + expression is induced in response to stress by a process that requires the Wis1-Spc1 kinase cascade and Atf1 transcription factor, indicating a mechanism of negative feedback regulation of the Wik1-Wis1-Spc1 signal transduction pathway (11Shiozaki K. Russell P. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 12Wilkinson M.G. Samuels M. Takeda T. Toone W.M. Shieh J.-C. Toda T. Millar J.B.A. Jones N. Genes & Dev. 1996; 18: 2289-2301Crossref Scopus (307) Google Scholar).In contrast to the situation with tyrosine-specific phosphatases, the role of PP2C in the negative regulation of stress-activated kinase cascades is poorly understood. The initial insights came from studies of S. cerevisiae that revealed that two PP2C genes,PTC1 and PTC3, were multicopy suppressors of mutations that caused hyperactivation of the Hog1p kinase cascade (13Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). The suggestion that PP2C negatively regulates the Hog1p stress-activated kinase cascade was further supported by the discovery of a synthetic lethal interaction involving ptp2 andptc1 mutations, which was suppressed by hog1mutations (14Maeda T. Tsai A.Y.M. Saito H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5408-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These findings led to the hypothesis that PP2C negatively regulates the stress signaling pathway by dephosphorylating Hog1p or Pbs2p, the MAPKK homolog that activates Hog1p. Independent evidence for a role of PP2C in the negative regulation of stress-activated kinase cascades came from studies of S. pombe. In S. pombe the genesptc1 +, ptc2 +, andptc3 + account for ∼90% of the total PP2C activity (15Shiozaki K. Akhavan-Niaki H. McGowan C.H. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3743-3751Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 16Shiozaki K. Russell P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 492-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Mutants carrying deletions of two or three of these genes are hypersensitive to increased levels of calcium. These defects are rescued by wis1 and spc1 mutations (16Shiozaki K. Russell P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 492-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with the notion that PP2C negatively regulates the Wis1-Spc1 kinase cascade in S. pombe, possibly via direct dephosphorylation of Spc1 and/or Wis1.Studies of PP2C in yeast are consistent with an increasing body of evidence suggesting a role for PP2C in the regulation of signal transduction systems. In mammals, PP2C is believed to play a role in Ca2+-dependent signal transduction in the brain (17Fukunaga K. Kobayashi T. Tamura S. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 133-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Findings implicating PP2C in Ca2+-related signal transduction have also arisen from studies of Arabidopsis thaliana, whose abi1 gene, which is essential for the response to the plant hormone abscisic acid, encodes a protein homologous to PP2C that also has a putative Ca2+ binding site (18Meyer K. Leube M.P. Grill E. Science. 1994; 264: 1452-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 19Leung J. Bouvier-Durand M. Morris P.-C. Guerrier D. Chefdor F. Giraudat J. Science. 1994; 264: 1448-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). PP2C also appears to be important for cell maturation and development, since its expression and activity is reported to be up-regulated during the monocytic differentiation evoked by vitamin D3 in the human leukemic HL-60 cells (20Nishikawa M. Omay S.B. Nakai K. Kihira H. Kobayashi T. Tamura S. Shiku H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that the FEM-2 gene ofCaenorhabditis elegans encodes a PP2C enzyme that is required to promote male development (21Chin-Sang I.D. Spence A.M. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 2314-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).Although genetic studies of fission and budding yeasts point toward a role for PP2C in regulating stress-activated protein kinase cascades, as of yet there have been no studies that directly test this hypothesis. Herein we describe such studies carried out with S. pombe. We report that expression of one of the PP2C genes,ptc1 +, is induced after osmotic stress by a mechanism that requires Spc1 and Atf1. Contrary to the hypothesis, we have found that high expression of ptc1 + does not reduce activating tyrosine phosphorylation of Spc1 or the phosphorylation of Atf1 that is catalyzed by Spc1. In fact, high expression of ptc1 + causes stress-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Spc1 to be sustained, suggesting that Ptc1 acts downstream of Spc1 to negatively regulate the stress response. This finding is consistent with the observation that the level of stress-induced transcription of several genes is reduced in cells that overproduce Ptc1. Eukaryotic organisms frequently encounter environmental conditions that cause cytotoxic damage; hence, they have developed sophisticated systems of sensing and responding to physiological stress. Protein kinase cascades are at the core of these stress sensor pathways (1Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar).

Based on the enzyme activities of ATase and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, the metabolic rate of the de novo and salvage pathways, the rate of cell growth (growth rate) in three cell lines under various culture conditions, and the effect of hypoxanthine infusion on the metabolic rate of thede novo pathway in rat liver, we concluded the following. 1) In −A+hATase transfectants, ATase activity limits the rate of the de novo pathway, which is closely linked with the growth rate. 2) Purine nucleotides are synthesized preferentially by the salvage pathway as long as hypoxanthine, the most essential source of purine salvage, can be utilized, which was confirmed in rat liver in vivo by hypoxanthine infusion. The preferential usage of the salvage pathway results in sparing the energy expenditure required for de novo synthesis. 3) The regulatory capacity of the de novo pathway (about 200%) was larger than that of the salvage pathway (about 20%) with constant hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase activity. Factors controlling relative flux rates of thede novo and salvage pathways of purine nucleotide biosynthesis during animal cell growth are not fully understood.

Purine nucleotides synthesized via de novo and salvage pathways are indispensable for cell growth through DNA and RNA syntheses and for the ATP energy supply. Interference of purine metabolism has thus been the target of antineoplastic drugs. However, it is unclear which of the two pathways is more important for the supply of purine nucleotides during cell growth. Purine nucleotide synthesis catalyzed by HPRT, 1The abbreviations used are: HPRT, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase; ATase, amidophosphoribosyltransferase;−A+hATase, CHO ade −A expressing human ATase; BPV, bovine papilloma virus; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; FCS, fetal calf serum; Hx, hypoxanthine; PRPP, 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate; XO, xanthine oxidase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. the key enzyme of the purine salvage pathway, was reported to be more active than that catalyzed by ATase, the presumed rate-limiting enzyme of thede novo pathway, in many tissues and malignant cells (1Natsumeda Y.

Enzyme Regul. 1987; 26: 335-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The increased metabolic rate via the de novo pathway and ATase activity are, however, more strongly linked with cell growth and malignant transformation than the metabolic rate via the salvage pathway and HPRT activity (1Natsumeda Y.

To interpret this enigma, we investigated the mutual regulation of purine biosynthesis between thede novo and salvage pathways. The cDNA cloning of rat and human ATase (hATase) in our laboratory (8Iwahana H. Yamaoka T Mizutani M Mizusawa N. Ii S. Yoshimoto K. Itakura M. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the effect of continuous Hx supplement on the metabolic rate of de novo synthesis was examined in rat liver. CHO K1 (wild type), CHO ade −A (10Oates G. Patterson D. Somatic Cell Genet. 1977; 3: 561-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which were gifts from Dr. David Patterson (Eleanor Roosevelt Institute for Cancer Research, CO), and −A+hATase were cultured at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator in the following media: (I) Ham's F-12 purine-rich medium containing 30 μm Hx with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS); (II) Ham's F-12 with 10% FCS treated with 1.25 mg (0.9 unit)/liter xanthine oxidase (XO) from buttermilk (Sigma) at 37 °C overnight, serving as a purine-free medium; (III) RPMI 1640 purine-free medium supplemented with 10% purine-free FCS; (IV) RPMI 1640 with 10% purine-free FCS and 30 μm Hx, serving as a purine-rich medium. In media I and IV, both the de novo and salvage pathways function in CHO K1 and −A+hATase, but only the salvage pathway functions in CHO ade −A. In media II and III, only the de novo pathway functions in CHO K1 and −A+hATase, and neither of the two pathways functions in CHO ade −A. Purine-free FCS was prepared by dialysis against 100-fold volumes of 0.9% NaCl with several exchanges of the dialysis solution at 4 °C for 24 h. The complete removal of Hx in media II and III was confirmed first by the disappearance of the Hx peak in the reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography analysis through a C18 column in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 4.6) with a gradient from 0 to 5% of methanol for 20 min at the flow rate of 1.5 ml/min (data not shown), and second by no growth of CHO ade−A in these media (Table I). hATase cDNA (2.2 kilobase pairs) was inserted into the cloning site downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter in pBCMGSNeo (14.5 kilobase pairs), which includes the replication origin of bovine papilloma virus (BPV) leading to 10–500 copies per cell in mammalian cells (11Karasuyama H. Kudo A. Melchers F. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 969-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 12Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar). Five micrograms of this plasmid construct purified with the Plasmid Maxi Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) were mixed with Transfectam solution (BioSepra Inc., Marlborough, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and overlaid onto CHO ade −A (2 × 106 cells/90 mm tissue culture plate) in 5 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). After the incubation at 37 °C for 6 h in a CO2 incubator, the DNA-containing medium was replaced with 10 ml of Ham's F-12 with 10% FCS and 800 μg/ml G418 to select transfectants with a high expression of the BPV vector (12Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar). Several clones of −A+hATase were isolated after G418 selection for 7 days. To select clones with high ATase activity,−A+hATase was further cultured in Ham's F-12 + XO medium for 7 days. The culture in this purine-free medium positively selected the clones with high ATase activity associated with a high growth rate. The number of copies in transfectants was determined by Southern blot analysis (12Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar, 13Uemura N. Ozawa K. Tojo A. Takahashi K. Okano A. Karasuyama H. Tani K. Asano S.

After culturing for 24, 48, 72, or 96 h, the cells were counted after trypsinization with 0.1% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA, using an improved Neubauer hemocytometer. The doubling time (hours) of cultured cells was determined from cell counts during the logarithmic growth phase and its reciprocal was defined as the growth rate. The metabolic rates of de novo and salvage pathways were, respectively, determined by the incorporation of [14C]glycine and [14C]Hx in acid-soluble purines in comparison to the acid-insoluble fraction (15Tsuchiya M. Yoshikawa H. Itakura M. Yamashita K. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C841-C848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Boss G.R. Erbe R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4242-4247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a 90-mm tissue culture plate, 2 × 106 cells were plated. After the recovery of cell functions from plating by 18 h of culture, [14C]glycine or [14C]Hx was added to the medium at the final concentrations of 200 μm(185 kBq/ml) and 50 μm (37 kBq/ml), respectively. The cells were cultured in radioactive medium for 30 min, washed three times with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested with a rubber policeman. Purine ribonucleotides were extracted from the cells in 1 ml of 2 n perchloric acid at 100 °C for 60 min. The extract was cooled on ice for 5 min and centrifuged at 35,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was applied to a column (0.5 × 2 cm) of AG-50W-X8 (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 0.1 n HCl. After washing with 5 ml of 1n HCl, the acid-soluble purines were eluted with 5 ml of 6n HCl, and counted in a scintillation counter. The amount of purines was determined by the absorbance of the eluate at 260 nm. To measure the incorporation of [14C]glycine in protein, the acid-insoluble precipitate after the last centrifugation was washed three times with 10% trichloroacetic acid, dissolved in 200 μl of 0.3 n NaOH, and the radioactivity was counted in a scintillation counter. The protein concentrations were assayed by Bradford's (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) method. The metabolic rate of the de novopathway was defined as the ratio of the dpm incorporated into purines per 1 OD at 260 nm to the disintegrations/min incorporated into 1 mg of protein, while the rate of the salvage pathway was defined as the disintegrations/min incorporated into purines per 1 OD at 260 nm. Cells detached with trypsin and EDTA were centrifuged at 500 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The cell pellet was washed with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline in a microtube. After centrifugation again at 500 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, the cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of sonication buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 5 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Sonication was performed by the Sonifier 250 (Branson Ultrasonics Corp. Danbury, CT) with a 90% duty cycle at the output dial setting of 3 for 15 s. These sonication conditions were selected because they yielded the highest extraction of ATase activity (data not shown). The supernatant after the centrifugation at 35,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min was used for the assay of both ATase and HPRT. The complete breakdown of the cell membrane was confirmed by microscopic observation of the pellet. The method of ATase assay was the same as reported previously (18Itakura M. Holmes E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 333: 999-1003Google Scholar). In brief, the cell lysate was incubated in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm[14C]glutamine (5.55 kBq/μmol) at 37 °C for 1 h. Formed [14C]glutamate was separated from [14C]glutamine by high voltage paper electrophoresis at 800 W for 15 min and counted in a scintillation counter. The PRPP-dependent hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate was regarded as representing ATase activity. To assay HPRT activity, the cell lysate was incubated in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) containing 1.5 mm PRPP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm[14C]Hx (27.8 kBq/μmol) in the assay volume of 50 μl at 37 °C for 20 min. To stop the reaction, the assay mixture was cooled on ice, and 5 μl of 0.5 m EDTA were added. The formed [14C]IMP was separated from [14C]Hx by high voltage paper electrophoresis at 800 W for 15 min, and the [14C]IMP spot on the filter paper was cut out under a UV lamp. The radioactivity of this spot was counted in a scintillation counter. Because the HPRT activity in CHO fibroblasts was nearly constant under all of the experimental conditions in this study (see Table VI), mRNA levels of HPRT were examined by Northern blot analysis using rat HPRT cDNA as a probe. For the preparation of the probe, total RNA was extracted from rat 3Y1 fibroblasts by ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Osaka, Japan) and reverse-transcribed to cDNA with the avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Life Sciences, Inc., St. Petersburg, FL). Rat HPRT cDNA in 697 base pairs (a sense primer; 5′-GACCGGATCCGTCATGTCGACCCT-3′ and an antisense primer; 5′-CTTGTGAATTCAACTTGCCGCTGT-3′) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA in 621 base pairs (a sense primer; 5′-TGGCGTCTTCACCACCATGGAGAA-3′, and an antisense primer; 5′-TTGTCATTGAGAGCAATGCCAGCC-3′) were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using the primer pairs shown in parentheses and cloned into a pCR II vector (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA). The base sequence of the cloned polymerase chain reaction products was confirmed to be identical to the reported sequence by the fluorescent automated DNA sequencer (ABI 377, Perkin-Elmer, Division of Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Northern blot analysis was performed by the standard method (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

To examine the effect of the continuous supply of Hx on the metabolic rate of the de novo pathway in rat liver in vivo, 5.0 μmol/200 g of body weight/12 h of Hx were continuously infused for 12 h via an intravenous cannula into the jugular vein of 8-week-old male Wistar rats according to the method previously published (19Itakura M. Maeda N. Tsuchiya M. Yamashita K. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: E684-E690PubMed Google Scholar). Thirty minutes before the end of infusion, 185 kBq/44–45 nmol [14C]glycine was administered intravenously. The rat liver was sampled exactly 30 min after the injection by freeze-clamping, and the liver sample pulverized under liquid nitrogen was placed in 4 ml of 2 n perchloric acid. The metabolic rate of the de novo pathway was then determined by the procedures mentioned above. To examine the effect of the continuous supply of Hx on the increased rate of the de novo pathway by glucagon in liver (19Itakura M. Maeda N. Tsuchiya M. Yamashita K. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: E684-E690PubMed Google Scholar), 0.5 mg of glucagon/200 g of body weight/12 h with or without Hx of 5.0 μmol/200 g of body weight/12 h was similarly infused, and the metabolic rate of thede novo pathway in liver was determined. The stimulative effect of glucagon on the de novo purine synthesis in liver has been reported (19Itakura M. Maeda N. Tsuchiya M. Yamashita K. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: E684-E690PubMed Google Scholar, 20Des Rosiers C. Lalanne M. Willemot J. Can. J.

The number of repetitive determinations for each value or point is as follows: six to eight for Table I, three for Table IV, three to four for Tables V and VI and Fig. 3, and two to four for Figs. 1 and 2. For comparison of data, Student's paired or unpaired t test was used. A probability of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Table IVMetabolic rates of de novo and salvage pathways of three cell lines Open table in a new tab Table VATase activity of three cell lines under four culture conditionsCultured cellsCulture media(I) HamF5-aHamF, Ham's F-12.(II) HamF+ XO(III) RPMI(IV) RPMI+ Hxnmol/h/10 7 cellsCHO K1345 ± 12286 ± 26259 ± 22304 ± 17CHO ade−AND5-bND, not detectable.NDNDND−A+hATase321 ± 18275 ± 22250 ± 16318 ± 215-a HamF, Ham's F-12.5-b ND, not detectable.

The growth rate and the enzyme activities of ATase and HPRT were determined for the three cell lines CHO K1, CHO ade−A, and the −A+hATase clone stably expressing ATase activity at the same level as CHO K1. Because ATase activity is absent in CHO ade −A cells, the total number of data points in panel A was 8, and that in panel B was 12.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 1The correlation between the ATase activity and the metabolic rate of the de novo pathway or the growth rate for six clones of −A+hATase.

The transfectant of CHO ade−A with the lowest ATase expression was placed in a long term culture in Ham's F-12 with xanthine oxidase, a purine-free medium. In this medium, cells with a higher ATase activity grew more rapidly, and were positively selected. For Southern blot analysis, aBamHI fragment (2.7 kilobase pairs) of pBCMGSNeo including hATase cDNA was used as the probe and an indicator of copy number. From a comparison with the radioactive intensity of indicator bands, the number of copies of the transgene in this clone increased from 10 to 40 during 30 passages, plotted on the abscissa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the necessary concentrations of purine bases for the maximal growth rate of CHO fibroblasts, ATase-deficient CHO ade −A cells were cultured in purine-free RPMI medium supplemented with Hx, adenine, or guanine at various final concentrations of up to 50 μm. Of the three purine bases, Hx most effectively increased the growth rate, while no cell growth was observed with guanine as the only source of the salvage pathway. Because Hx at a concentration of more than 30 μm increased the growth rate of CHO ade −A fibroblasts to the maximal plateau level, and because adenine in addition to 30 μm Hx inversely decreased the growth rate (data not shown), it was considered that Hx at a concentration over 30 μm drives the flux through the salvage pathway at its maximum in CHO ade −A fibroblasts. These observations demonstrated that Hx is the principal source for the salvage pathway in CHO ade −A fibroblasts. Six clones of A+hATase obtained after G418 selection in purine-free medium were cultured in purine-rich medium. The level of ATase expression among these clones ranged from about 30 to 350% of that in CHO K1. The level of ATase expression (plotted on the x axis) strongly correlated with the metabolic rate of the de novo pathway and with the growth rate (both plotted on the y axis) (Fig.1), with correlation formulas of y = 0.00047x − 0.53 (r = 0.83) andy = 0.0045x − 3.8 (r = 0.95), respectively. The metabolic rate of the de novopathway also strongly correlated with the growth rate (r = 0.93, data not shown). It is notable that the doubling time of the −A+hATase clone with the highest ATase expression among the 6 transfectants examined was shortened down to 10.5 h, i.e. 9.5 × 10−2/h of growth rate, from the initial 16.8 h for wild-type CHO K1 cells. This correlation does not appear to be saturated even at the highest ATase activity of 350% of that in CHO K1. These results obtained from−A+hATase clearly demonstrated that ATase is a rate-limiting enzyme of the de novo pathway. The levels of ATase activity in −A+hATase clones closely correlated with their growth rate even under conditions where purine nucleotide synthesis by means of the salvage pathway was available in purine-rich medium (Fig. 1). The growth rate of −A+hATase clones gradually increased during their positive selection in purine-free medium. The−A+hATase clone with the lowest ATase activity was cultured in purine-free medium up to passage number 30, where its growth rate reached the maximal plateau. The number of copies of the hATase transgene, the ATase activity, the metabolic rate of thede novo pathway, and the growth rate were periodically determined up to passage number 30 (Fig. 2). With the gradual increase in the number of copies of the transgene from 10 to 40 per cell, as shown by the increase in the intensity of the radioactive bands in Southern blot analysis, the ATase activity, the metabolic rate of the de novo pathway, and the growth rate increased in parallel, and all of these simultaneously reached the plateau level at passage number 24. The rate-limiting quality of ATase for the de novo pathway was thus demonstrated both by the correlation of ATase activity with the metabolic rate of the de novopathway among six clones of −A+hATase (Fig. 1) and during the long term culture of one clone of −A+hATase (Fig. 2). In addition to the rate-limiting property of ATase for the de novo synthesis, these observations demonstrated that ATase activity closely correlated with the growth rate under these conditions. Three cell lines including CHO K1, CHO ade−A, and the −A+hATase clone stably expressing ATase activity at the same level as CHO K1 were used. The doubling time and the growth rate of these three lines of CHO fibroblasts under the various culture conditions tested in this study are summarized in Tables I and II, respectively. In purine-free medium, CHO ade −A did not proliferate at all. The growth rate under conditions where both purine biosynthetic pathways were functioning were significantly higher than those under conditions where either the de novo or the salvage pathway was functioning. The difference in the growth rate between the two different conditions was calculated and presented as the increase in the growth rate in Table III. The independent contribution of the de novo pathway in the absence of the salvage pathway was significantly larger than that of the salvage pathway in the absence of the de novo pathway (4.2versus 3.4 × 10−2/h). The additive contribution of the de novo pathway to the salvage pathway was also significantly greater than that of the salvage pathway to thede novo pathway (1.8 versus 1.0 × 10−2/h). The growth rate of 5.2 × 10−2/h achieved by the participation of both pathways was lower than the sum of 7.6 × 10−2/h obtained by adding 4.2 × 10−2/hr through the de novopathway alone and 3.4 × 10−2/h through the salvage pathway alone. To interpret the mechanism of this nonadditive antagonism, the metabolic rates of both pathways and the enzyme activities of ATase and HPRT, the key enzymes of the de novoand the salvage pathways, respectively, were determined.Table IIGrowth rate (× 10 −2 /h) of three cell lines under four culture conditionsSee Table I for an explanation of symbols and letters.

The reciprocal of doubling time was defined as the growth rate. See Table I for an explanation of symbols and letters. The difference of the growth rate between two conditions was defined as the increase in the growth rate. To explain the antagonism between two purine biosynthetic pathways, the metabolic rates of the de novo and the salvage pathways were assayed by the incorporation of [14C]glycine and [14C]Hx, respectively (Table IV). When both pathways were functioning, the metabolic rate of the de novo pathway was suppressed by −69 and −64% in CHO K1 and −A+hATase, respectively, compared with that when only the de novo pathway was functioning. On the other hand, the salvage pathway activity was modestly suppressed through the additive availability of the de novo pathway only by −17 and −24% in CHO K1 and −A+hATase, respectively, compared with that when only the salvage pathway was functioning. These results indicate that purine nucleotides are synthesized preferentially via the salvage pathway as long as CHO fibroblasts are allowed to use the salvage pathway. Moreover, the preferential utilization of the salvage pathway with the concomitant suppression of the de novo pathway led to a large reserve capacity of de novo synthesis. From a comparison between the metabolic rates of CHO K1 cultured in Ham's F-12 and Ham's F-12 + XO, the reserve capacity of de novo synthesis of CHO K1 in Ham's F-12 was estimated at 218% ((0.89 − 0.28)/0.28 × 100), whereas the reserve capacity of the salvage pathway of CHO K1 in Ham's F-12, compared with CHO ade −A in Ham's F-12, was estimated at only 20% ((2349 − 1962)/1962 × 100). The enzyme activities of ATase and HPRT under four culture conditions were summarized in Table V for the ATase of CHO K1 and the −A+hATase clone (no ATase activity was detected in CHO ade −A), and Table VIfor the HPRT of CHO K1, CHO ade −A, and the−A+hATase.

https://openalex.org/W2084361168,"The gene encoding the 12-kDa extrinsic protein of photosystem II from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was cloned based on N-terminal sequence of the mature protein. This gene, namedpsbU, encodes a polypeptide of 131 residues, the first 36 residues of which were absent in the mature protein and thus served as a transit peptide required for its transport into the thylakoid lumen. A psbU gene deletion mutant grew photoautotrophically in normal BG11 medium at almost the same rate as that of the wild type strain. This mutant, however, grew apparently slower than the wild type did upon depletion of Ca2+ or Cl− from the growth medium. Photosystem II oxygen evolution decreased to 81% in the mutant as compared with that in the wild type, and the thermoluminescence B- and Q-bands shifted to higher temperatures accompanied by an increase in the Q-band intensity. These results indicate that the 12-kDa protein is not essential for oxygen evolution but may play a role in optimizing the ion (Ca2+ and Cl−) environment and maintaining a functional structure of the cyanobacterial oxygen-evolving complex. In addition, a double deletion mutant lacking cytochrome c-550 and the 12-kDa protein grew photoautotrophically with a phenotype identical to that of the single deletion mutant of cytochrome c-550. This supports our previous biochemical results that the 12-kDa protein cannot bind to photosystem II in the absence of cytochromec-550 (Shen, J.-R., and Inoue, Y. (1993) Biochemistry32, 1825–1832).

The oxygen-evolving system of cyanobacteria contains three extrinsic proteins, namely, a 33-kDa protein, cytochromec-550, and a 12-kDa protein. The genes coding for the 33-kDa protein and cytochrome c-550 are psbO andpsbV genes, respectively (for reviews see Refs. 1Bricker T.M. Ghanotakis D.F. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F.

Acta. 1996; 1277: 35-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), whereas the gene for the 12-kDa protein has been tentatively namedpsbU (3Nishiyama, Y. (1995) GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ/data bases, accession number, X93509.Google Scholar, 4Shen, J.-R. (1996) GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ/data bases, accession number, D84098.Google Scholar). The 33-kDa protein is commonly found in higher plant and cyanobacterial PSII, 1The abbreviations used are: PSII, photosystem II; DCMU, 3-(3, 4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea, kb, kilobases; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. and its function has been studied extensively by both in vitrobiochemical approaches and in vivo mutagenesis studies. Results from these studies suggested that the 33-kDa protein plays an important role in stabilizing the tetramanganese cluster, which directly catalyzes the water-splitting reaction. Loss of this protein by biochemical removal from isolated PSII (5Ono T. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1984; 166: 381-384Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Miyao M. Murata N.

EMBO J. 1987; 6: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 9Burnap R.L. Sherman L.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) from algal cells leads to a significant loss of the oxygen-evolving activity and in some conditions loss of manganese atoms from the tetramanganese cluster. The other two proteins, cytochromec-550 and the 12-kDa protein, however, are present only in algal-type PSII but absent in higher plant PSII. Our previous in vitro biochemical (10Shen J.-R. Inoue Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1825-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and in vivo genetic studies (11Shen J.-R. Vermaas W. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6901-6907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) have indicated that cytochrome c-550 is required for maintaining both the oxygen evolution and PSII stability in vivo. This cytochrome can bind to PSII essentially independent of the other extrinsic proteins (10Shen J.-R. Inoue Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1825-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In accordance with this, a double deletion mutant of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 lacking both the 33-kDa protein and cytochrome c-550 showed a complete loss of photoautotrophic growth, which is caused by deactivation of oxygen evolution and destabilization of PSII in vivo (12Shen J.-R. Burnap R.L. Inoue Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12661-12668Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In contrast, both the single deletion mutant of the 33-kDa protein (9Burnap R.L. Sherman L.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) or cytochrome c-550 (11Shen J.-R. Vermaas W. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6901-6907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) were able to grow autotrophically, albeit with reduced rates. These studies suggested that cytochromec-550 binds to and functions in cyanobacterial PSII independent of the 33-kDa protein in maintaining the oxygen-evolving activity and PSII stability (12Shen J.-R. Burnap R.L. Inoue Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12661-12668Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The 12-kDa protein was first found as a 9-kDa protein in PSII purified from a thermophilic Phormidium laminosum (13Stewart A.C. Ljungberg Ulf. Åkerlund H.-E. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 808: 353-362Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14Stewart A.C. Siczkowski M. Ljungberg Ulf. FEBS Lett. 1985; 193: 175-179Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Dissociation of this protein from the isolated PSII caused a decrease in oxygen evolution that was partially restored upon rebinding of the protein (14Stewart A.C. Siczkowski M. Ljungberg Ulf. FEBS Lett. 1985; 193: 175-179Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Rolfe S.A. Bendall D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 973: 220-226Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The P. laminosum gene encoding the protein has been cloned and includes a leader sequence required for its transport into the thylakoid lumen (16Wallace T.P. Stewart A.C. Pappin D. Howe C.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We have confirmed the presence of a homologous 12-kDa protein in PSII purified from another thermophilic cyanobacterium, Synechococcus vulcanus (17Shen J.-R. Ikeuchi M. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Lack of the 12-kDa protein also led to a decrease in oxygen evolution of the Synechococcus PSII that was restored by rebinding of the protein (10Shen J.-R. Inoue Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1825-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We further showed that binding of the 12-kDa protein in the isolated Synechococcus PSII requires presence of both the 33-kDa protein and cytochrome c-550; in the absence of either of the two proteins, the 12-kDa protein cannot bind to PSII efficiently (10Shen J.-R. Inoue Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1825-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the 12-kDa protein is in close contact with both the 33-kDa protein and cytochromec-550 at the lumenal side of cyanobacterial PSII; this has been confirmed by in vitro cross-linking studies showing that all of the three proteins were cross-linked together by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodimide hydrochloride (18Han K.-C. Shen J.-R. Ikeuchi M. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These studies were carried out in vitro with PSII purified from thermophilic cyanobacteria. In the present work, we demonstrated the presence of the 12-kDa protein in thylakoids of the mesophilic cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 by N-terminal amino acid sequencing and cloned the gene coding for the 12-kDa protein based on its N-terminal sequence. The role of the 12-kDa protein was then studied by construction and characterization of thepsbU gene deletion mutants. The mesophilic, glucose-tolerant, transformable cyanobacterium,Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, was grown in BG11 medium at 30 °C at a light intensity of 25–30 μeinsteins m−2s−1. Thylakoid membranes were isolated from theSynechocystis cells by glass beads according to Ref. 19Yu J. Vermaas W.F.J. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 315-322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and the isolated thylakoids were treated by sonication to release extrinsic proteins as described in Ref. 20Shen J.-R. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20408-20413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The obtained sonication extract was separated by a Mono Q column using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) (11Shen J.-R. Vermaas W. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6901-6907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The fractions from column chromatography were collected and electrophoresed in a gel containing 16% polyacrylamide and 6.0 m urea, and protein bands around the 12-kDa molecular mass region were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane followed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The 12-kDa protein was identified by comparing the obtained sequences with the 9-kDa protein sequence from P. laminosum(16Wallace T.P. Stewart A.C. Pappin D. Howe C.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and the N-terminal sequence of the 12-kDa protein fromS. vulcanus (17Shen J.-R. Ikeuchi M. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Based on the N-terminal sequence, the gene coding for the 12-kDa protein was cloned from genomic DNA of Synechocystis PCC 6803 by a two-step, reversed PCR method (11Shen J.-R. Vermaas W. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6901-6907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This gene was namedpsbU. DNA sequencing was performed with an ALFexpress DNA sequencer (Pharmacia) using Cy5 fluorescent primers, based on the Sanger dideoxy-sequencing method. PCR reaction was carried out using an Expand™ High Fidelity PCR kit (Boehringer Mannheim), and each PCR product was sequenced from three independent clones to eliminate any possible inconsistencies. To obtain the clone containing the completepsbU gene, another PCR reaction was carried out with genomic DNA as template and primers flanking the whole gene. The resulted PCR product was cloned into pUC119 and used for subsequent mutagenesis studies. To delete the 12-kDa protein from Synechocystis PCC 6803, a plasmid was constructed in which a 0.45-kb EcoT14 I-XbaI fragment containing the entire coding region of the gene was replaced by a kanamycin-resistant cassette. This plasmid was used to transform the glucose-tolerant Synechocystis PCC 6803 strain. Cyanobacterial transformation and selection of the kanamycin-resistant transformant were carried out according to published procedures (21Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (851) Google Scholar). As a control, another plasmid was constructed in which the kanamycin-resistant cassette was inserted into an XbaI site downstream of the coding region of the 12-kDa protein gene, and this plasmid was also transformed to Synechocystis PCC 6803. A double deletion mutant lacking cytochrome c-550 and the 12-kDa protein was constructed by introducing the psbU gene deletion plasmid into a host cell in which the psbV gene coding for cytochrome c-550 has been replaced by an erythromycin-resistant cassette as described previously (11Shen J.-R. Vermaas W. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6901-6907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The transformants were selected and propagated in BG11 plates containing 25 μm atrazine, 5 mm glucose, 10 μg kanamycin/ml, and 20 μg/ml erythromycin. Growth curves of the wild type and mutant strains in liquid BG11 were recorded by measuring the light scattering of cells at 730 nm. For depletion of Ca2+ or Cl− from the BG11 medium, 0.24 mm CaCl2 in the original medium was replaced by either 0.48 mm NaCl or 0.24 mmCa(NO3)2. Synechocystis cells grown in their mid-logarithmic phase were harvested, washed twice with distilled water, and then transferred to the growth medium lacking Ca2+ or Cl−. For electrophoresis, harvested cells were broken by glass beads (100–150 μm), solubilized, and then applied to a 16–22% polyacrylamide gradient gel containing 6.0m urea. Cytochromes of c-type were detected by monitoring peroxidase activity of the hemes on the gel with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine and H2O2 as described in Refs. 20Shen J.-R. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20408-20413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 22Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Levin W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar. Oxygen evolution of the Synechocystis cells was measured with a Clark-type oxygen electrode under continuous, saturating yellow light at 30 °C in BG11 with 0.6 mm2,6-dichlorobenzoquinone and 1 mm potassium ferricyanide as acceptors. For thermoluminescence measurement, harvestedSynechocystis cells were suspended in BG11 in the absence or the presence of 20 μm DCMU at 100 μg chlorophyll/ml, adapted in the dark for 5 min at room temperature, and then illuminated with single turn-over flashes at 0 °C for samples without DCMU or with continuous light for 30 s at −5 °C for samples supplemented with DCMU. Thermoluminescence glow curves were recorded as described in Ref. 23Ono T. Inoue Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 850: 380-389Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, with a heating rate of 1.0 °C/s. The 12-kDa protein was identified by N-terminal sequencing of several protein bands around 12-kDa molecular mass region obtained by column chromatography of sonication extracts from thylakoid membranes of Synechocystis PCC 6803. The sequence obtained is ELNAVDAKLTTDFGQKIDLNNSDIXDFXGLRGFYPXLAXXIIKN; this sequence is homologous to the 9-kDa protein of P. laminosum and the 12-kDa protein of S. vulcanus. Based on the N-terminal sequence, the psbU gene encoding the 12-kDa protein was amplified and cloned by a two-step PCR method (11Shen J.-R. Vermaas W. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6901-6907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The obtained DNA sequence, together with its 5′- and 3′-flanking regions, is shown in Fig. 1. The start codon for this gene was assigned at the ATG codon of nucleotide number 253 in the DNA fragment shown in Fig. 1, because this codon is preceded by a typical ribosome-binding sequence (Shine-Dalgarno sequence, AGGAG,underlined in Fig. 1) 7 base pairs upstream, as well as a stop codon 39 base pairs upstream in the same reading frame (indicated by an asterisk in Fig. 1). According to this assignment, the gene encodes a polypeptide of 131 amino acid residues with a total molecular mass of 14231 Da. Hydropathy analysis indicated that the derived amino acid sequence is mostly hydrophilic, except the first 36 residues, which form a major hydrophobic loop (not shown). This is in agreement with the previous results that the 12-kDa protein is a hydrophilic one that is associated with lumenal surface of the thylakoid membranes (10Shen J.-R. Inoue Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1825-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 13Stewart A.C. Ljungberg Ulf. Åkerlund H.-E. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 808: 353-362Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14Stewart A.C. Siczkowski M. Ljungberg Ulf. FEBS Lett. 1985; 193: 175-179Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Rolfe S.A. Bendall D.S.

As upon PCR amplification of thepsbU gene, we detected only one band of the gene, we consider that there is only one copy of the gene inSynechocystis PCC 6803. This is consistent with the results from computer analysis of the complete genome sequence ofSynechocystis PCC 6803 that was recently determined (24Kaneko T. Sato S. et al.DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2122) Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequence determined for the mature 12-kDa protein corresponds to the sequence starting from residue number 37 of the gene-derived amino acid sequence. This indicates the cleavage of the first 36 residues after synthesis of the protein, which gave rise to a mature 12-kDa protein of 95 residues with a calculated molecular mass of 10490 Da. Thus, the first 36 residues served as a transit peptide for the protein to be transferred across membranes. This is consistent with the previous results that the 12-kDa protein is associated with the lumenal side of thylakoid membranes (10Shen J.-R. Inoue Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1825-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In fact, a similar transit peptide has been found for the homologous 9-kDa protein fromP. laminosum (16Wallace T.P. Stewart A.C. Pappin D. Howe C.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and recently it has been reported that the same gene from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 also carried a transit peptide (3Nishiyama, Y. (1995) GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ/data bases, accession number, X93509.Google Scholar). Although the three transit peptides for the 12-kDa protein have virtually no similarity in their primary sequences, they share some common features of bacterial-type transit peptides (25von Heijne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar),e.g. there is a positive charge in the N terminus and a hydrophobic cluster in the middle, and the residue immediately before the cleavage site is Ala in all the three sequences (Fig.2).Figure 2Comparison of the 12-kDa protein sequence among four species of cyanobacteria and one species of red alga currently known.

Genet. 1989; 216: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and also with the N-terminal partial sequence from S. vulcanus (17Shen J.-R. Ikeuchi M. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and a red alga, Cyanidium caldarium (26Enami I. Murayama H. Ohta H. Kamo M. Nakazato K. Shen J.-R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1232: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Among the three cyanobacteria for which the psbU gene has been cloned, an overall identity of 45.5–56.8% can be seen for the mature part of the sequence. When this comparison was made for the first 65 residues for which the sequence from S. vulcanus is known, the total homology lies between 49.2–57.1% among the four species of cyanobacteria compared. The sequence homology in the same N-terminal region, however, are only 30.3–36.5% between cyanobacteria and the red alga C. caldarium; this is significantly lower than those observed among different species of cyanobacteria. This indicates a remarkably higher divergence in the 12-kDa protein sequence between cyanobacteria and red algae than those found among cyanobacteria. A deletion mutant ΔpsbU, was constructed by replacing a 0.45-kb EcoT14I-XbaI fragment containing the whole psbU gene with a 1.3-kb kanamycin-resistant cassette. This replacement was confirmed by PCR amplification of the DNA region containing the psbU gene. As shown in Fig. 3, although PCR amplification with two primers whose sequences correspond to the 5′- and 3′-sequences of the DNA fragment shown in Fig. 1 yielded a fragment of 0.92 kb from the wild type cells, the same amplification yielded a fragment of 1.8 kb from the targeted 12-kDa protein deletion mutant, which is exactly the same as would be expected if the 0.45-kb psbU gene-containing fragment was replaced by the 1.3-kb kanamycin cassette. The original 0.92-kb fragment disappeared completely, indicating a successful deletion of the only psbU gene in the mutant. Fig. 3 also shows the successful construction of a double deletion mutant, ΔpsbU/ΔpsbV, which is depleted of both the 12-kDa protein and cytochrome c-550. In this mutant, the psbU gene was replaced by the kanamycin cassette (Fig. 3, lane 4 in panel A) and a large part of the psbV gene was replaced by an erythromycin-resistant cassette (11Shen J.-R. Vermaas W. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6901-6907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, lane 4 in panel B). As a control, a Synechocystis strain designatedpsbU/Km was constructed by inserting the 1.3-kb kanamycin cassette into the XbaI site downstream of thepsbU gene. This insertion does not inactivate thepsbU gene and gives rise to a PCR fragment of 2.2 kb as shown in lane 2 of panel A in Fig. 3, which thus indicates a successful construction of the psbU/Km strain. Fig. 4 shows the photoautotrophic growth curves and oxygen evolution of wild type and mutant strains. Both the deletion mutant ΔpsbU and the control strain psbU/Km showed a growth rate close to that of the wild type, indicating that deletion of the 12-kDa protein had very little, if any, effect on growth of the Synechocystis cells. The PSII oxygen evolution decreased to 81% in the ΔpsbU mutant as compared with that of the wild type strain. In contrast, thepsbU/Km strain had the same oxygen-evolving activity as that of the wild type. These results indicate a slight decrease in the oxygen evolution upon deletion of the psbU gene. Apparently, this decrease in the PSII activity was not large enough to give rise to a remarkable change in the growth rate of the mutant strain, presumably because that the growth rate of the Synechocystis cells is determined primarily by some photosynthetic steps other than the PSII oxygen-evolving reaction. In fact, most of the mutants leading to an impairment in PSII activity showed a smaller decrease in their growth rates or overall photosynthetic electron transport activities than the decrease observed in the PSII oxygen-evolving activity (see for example Ref. 9Burnap R.L. Sherman L.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The growth rate of the double deletion mutant ΔpsbU/ΔpsbV decreased to half of the wild type strain (Fig. 4); this is comparable with that of the single deletion mutant ΔpsbV reported previously (11Shen J.-R.

The activity of the double deletion mutant, ΔpsbU/ΔpsbV, is 41% of the wild type strain (Fig. 4), which is also similar to the activity observed for the single deletion mutant, ΔpsbV (11Shen J.-R. Vermaas W. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6901-6907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These results are in contrast to the results observed with the single deletion mutant ΔpsbU and indicates that further deletion of thepsbU gene from the ΔpsbV mutant strain had no effect on its growth and oxygen evolution. This in turn suggests that the 12-kDa protein did not function in oxygen evolution of the ΔpsbV mutant, in agreement with the previous in vitro results that the 12-kDa protein cannot bind to and function in cyanobacterial PSII in the absence of both cytochromec-550 and the 33-kDa protein (10Shen J.-R. Inoue Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1825-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The effect of deletion of the 12-kDa protein on growth was also examined in the absence of Ca2+ or Cl− in the growth medium. As shown in Fig. 5, the wild type strain was able to grow in the medium depleted of either Ca2+ or Cl− with a slightly reduced rate in agreement with the results reported previously (27Philbrick J.B. Diner B. Zilinskas B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13370-13376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Engels D.H. Lott L. Schmid G.H. Pistorius E.K. Photosyn. Res. 1994; 42: 227-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A similar growth was observed for the strain psbU/Km. The deletion mutant ΔpsbU, however, showed an apparent decrease in the growth rate in the absence of either Ca2+ or Cl−. This is different from the growth in the normal BG11 medium, where no effect was seen upon deletion of the gene (Fig. 4). This suggests a role of the 12-kDa protein in maintaining the optimum ion (Ca2+ and Cl−) environment required for cyanobacterial oxygen evolution. Presumably, deletion of the 12-kDa protein decreased the affinity of PSII for Ca2+ and Cl−, which then leads to a reduction of the growth in the absence of either one of these two ions. In contrast, the double deletion mutant ΔpsbU/ΔpsbV cannot grow at all in the absence of either Ca2+ or Cl−. This is caused primarily by deletion of the psbV gene, because the single deletion mutant ΔpsbV is already unable to grow in the absence of Ca2+ or Cl−. 2J.-R. Shen, M. Qian, Y. Inoue, and R. L. Burnap, manuscript in preparation. The oxygen-evolving system in the mutant strains was further investigated by thermoluminescence from cells excited with single turn-over flashes. The thermoluminescence B-band, which is obtained in the absence of DCMU and arises principally from charge recombination between S2 and QB− (29Inoue Y. Amesz J. Hoff A.J. Biophysical Techniques in Photosynthesis. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1996: 93-107Google Scholar), had a peak temperature of 24 °C for the wild type strain (Fig.6). Its intensity becomes larger following two flashes of illumination than after one flash of illumination, a typical feature observed for thermoluminescence from whole cyanobacterial cells (30Burnap R.L. Shen J.-R. Jursinic P.A. Qian M. Inoue Y. Sherman L.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7404-7410Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The peak temperature and intensity of the B-band from the control strain psbU/Km is very similar to those of the wild type strain. The ΔpsbU strain also showed a similar intensity of the B-band as that of the wild type or psbU/Km strains following either one, two, or three flashes. Its peak temperature, however, shifted to 28 °C; this is apparently higher than the peak temperature of the B-band from wild type or psbU/Km strains. This suggests a possible modification of the S2-state upon deletion of the psbU gene. The peak temperature of B-band from the double deletion mutant ΔpsbU/ΔpsbV is around 30 °C, which is close to the single deletion mutant ΔpsbU. The intensity of the B-band from the double deletion mutant ΔpsbU/ΔpsbV, however, decreased significantly than that of the wild type orpsbU/Km strains. This implies that the shift of the B-band peak temperature is caused by deletion of the 12-kDa protein, whereas deletion of cytochrome c-550 mainly affected the overall activity of PSII oxygen evolution but had essentially no effects on properties of any single S-states. The thermoluminescence Q-band, which is obtained in the presence of DCMU and arises from charge recombination of S2QA−, showed a peak temperature of 18 °C for the wild type and psbU/Km strains. This temperature is slightly higher than that reported previously for cyanobacterial cells (30Burnap R.L. Shen J.-R. Jursinic P.A. Qian M. Inoue Y. Sherman L.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7404-7410Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), presumably because of the difference in the growth conditions between the present and previous studies. The intensity of the Q-band is similar to that of the B-band from the same strains. The Q-band from the ΔpsbU mutant strain showed a peak temperature of 22 °C, which is higher than the Q-band from the wild type or psbU/Km strains. This resembles the situation observed for the B-band, thus confirming the modification of the S2-state upon removal of the 12-kDa protein. The intensity of the Q-band in the ΔpsbU mutant strain, however, was significantly higher than the intensity of the B-band from the same strain. The cause for this increase is not clear at present but may be due to a further modification on QA− upon removal of the 12-kDa protein. In the double deletion mutant ΔpsbU/ΔpsbV, peak temperature of the Q-band is around 24 °C, which is close to that of the Q-band observed for the ΔpsbU mutant. Its intensity also increased to be slightly higher than that of the B-band from the same strain, although this increase is not so large as that observed in the ΔpsbU mutant. These features are also observed in the single deletion mutant ΔpsbV,2 suggesting that the 12-kDa protein already lost its function in the ΔpsbV mutant. The smaller increase in the intensity of the Q-band in the ΔpsbU/ΔpsbV mutant is apparently due to the fact that the number of functional PSII reaction centers is decreased in the double deletion mutant, because deletion of psbV has been shown to destabilize the PSII complex (11Shen J.-R. Vermaas W. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6901-6907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The psbU gene cloned in the present study represents the first gene from mesophilic cyanobacteria coding for the 12-kDa extrinsic protein of algal PSII. As in the thermophilic cyanobacteria (16Wallace T.P. Stewart A.C. Pappin D. Howe C.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the gene obtained here had a leader sequence typical of a prokaryotic type. This suggests the transport of the protein after its synthesis, in support of the previous biochemical evidence that this protein is located in the lumenal side of the thylakoid membrane (10Shen J.-R. Inoue Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1825-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The 12-kDa protein, together with cytochrome c-550, are two PSII extrinsic proteins first found in prokaryotic algae cyanobacteria (17Shen J.-R. Ikeuchi M. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and they recently have been confirmed in a eukaryotic red algaC. caldarium (26Enami I. Murayama H. Ohta H. Kamo M. Nakazato K. Shen J.-R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1232: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The psbV gene for cytochromec-550 has been found in the plastid genomes of eukaryotic algae Cyanophora paradoxa (31Stirewalt, V. L., Michalowski, C. B., Luffelhardt, W., Bohnert, H. J., and Bryant, D. A. (1995) GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ/data bases, accession number, U30821.Google Scholar), Porphyra purpurea(32Reith, M. E., and Munholland, J. (1996) GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ/data bases, accession number, U38804.Google Scholar) and a diatom Odontella sinensis (33Kowallik, K. V., Stoebe, B., Schaffran, I., Kroth-Pancic, P., and Freier, U. (1996) GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ/data bases, accession number, Z67753.Google Scholar) for which the complete plastid genome sequences have been determined. ThepsbV genes from all the three types of algae had a leader sequence in their N terminus, consistent with a thylakoid lumenal location of this cytochrome. In the plastid genomes from these three species of eukaryotic algae, however, the psbU gene for the 12-kDa protein was not found. Although the presence of the 12-kDa protein in Cyanophora and diatom has not been confirmed, this protein has been found in the red alga C. caldarium(26Enami I. Murayama H. Ohta H. Kamo M. Nakazato K. Shen J.-R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1232: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and therefore, the psbU gene must be present in nuclear genome of the red algae. In fact, we have recently cloned thepsbU gene from the red alga C. caldarium, which shows features of a typical nuclear gene coding for thylakoid lumenal proteins, e.g. the presence of a bipartite transit peptide in its N terminus that is required for transport of the protein across both the envelope and thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. 3H. Ohta, A. Okamura, J.-R. Shen, M. Kamo, and I. Enami, manuscript in preparation. The overall homology of the gene-derived amino acid sequence was 45.5–56.8% among three species of cyanobacteria P. laminosum, Synechocystis 7002, andSynechocystis 6803. The homology in the N-terminal region of the protein was 49.2–57.1% among four cyanobacteria includingS. vulcanus. On the other hand, the homology in the same N-terminal region was 30.3–36.5% between the four species of cyanobacteria and the red alga C. caldarium (26Enami I. Murayama H. Ohta H. Kamo M. Nakazato K. Shen J.-R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1232: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This is significantly lower than those observed among different species of cyanobacteria and therefore suggests an evolutionary divergence in the oxygen-evolving complex between prokaryotic cyanobacteria and eukaryotic red algae. Deletion of thepsbU gene slightly decreased the PSII oxygen evolution. This effect was apparently caused by loss of the 12-kDa protein, because insertion of the kanamycin cassette downstream of the psbU gene had no detectable effects. This agrees with the previous in vitro biochemical results that reconstitution with the 12-kDa protein to purified S. vulcanus PSII resulted in a small increase in the oxygen evolution (10Shen J.-R. Inoue Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1825-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Similar results have been observed with PSII purified from P. laminosum, although in this case, the decrease observed after release of the 12-kDa protein was rather large presumably partly due to a concomitant loss of cytochrome c-550 from the PSII particles (14Stewart A.C. Siczkowski M. Ljungberg Ulf. FEBS Lett. 1985; 193: 175-179Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Rolfe S.A. Bendall D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 973: 220-226Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The decrease in oxygen evolution caused by loss of the 12-kDa protein, however, is rather small compared with that caused by loss of the other two extrinsic proteins, the 33-kDa protein and cytochromec-550; loss of either of these two components resulted in a significant loss of oxygen evolution accompanied by an apparent reduction in the growth rate (9Burnap R.L. Sherman L.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 11Shen J.-R. Vermaas W. Inoue Y. J. Biol.

Cook K.M. Self S.J. Zhang Z. Barber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1060: 1-12Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In contrast, the 12-kDa protein deletion mutant grew photoautotrophically at a rate very similar to that of the wild type strain. The growth rate of the ΔpsbU mutant, however, was apparently lower than that of the wild type strain in the absence of Ca2+ or Cl−. This suggests a role of the 12-kDa protein in maintaining the optimum ion (Ca2+ and Cl−) environment required for cyanobacterial oxygen evolution. In addition, a shift to higher temperature in the thermoluminescence B- and Q-bands, as well as an increase in the intensity of the Q-band, were observed upon deletion of thepsbU gene. These results may suggest a modification of the S-state, in particularly the S2-state, upon depletion of the 12-kDa protein, which thus suggests a role of the 12-kDa protein in maintaining a functional structure of the algal PSII complex. The double deletion mutant, ΔpsbU/ΔpsbV, showed a similar phenotype to that of the single deletion mutant ΔpsbV in terms of its oxygen evolution, growth in the presence or the absence of Ca2+ or Cl−, and thermoluminescence properties.2 This indicates that deletion of the psbU gene from the ΔpsbV mutant had essentially no further effect on the PSII oxygen-evolving complex, thus suggesting that the 12-kDa protein did not function in the singlepsbV deletion mutant lacking cytochrome c-550. This agrees with the previous results that the 12-kDa protein cannot bind to and function in isolated PSII in the absence of either cytochrome c-550 or the 33-kDa protein. This double deletion mutant ΔpsbU/ΔpsbV is thus very much different from another double deletion mutant, ΔpsbO/ΔpsbV, which cannot grow photoautotrophically in spite of the fact that either of the single deletion mutants ΔpsbO or ΔpsbV can grow autotrophically (12Shen J.-R. Burnap R.L. Inoue Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12661-12668Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W1497451448,"Fluctuation of ion current, between a high conductance and a low conductance state, through biological ion channels and pores is assumed to arise from conformational changes between an ""open"" and a ""closed"" configuration. Here we offer an additional mechanism that arises from changes in ionization of fixed charges within, or at the mouth of, a channel or pore. Our hypothesis, which is based on measurements of ion selectivity alongside ion current, applies to pores through some synthetic membranes and through channels-such as those created by certain toxins-that remain (at least partially) open in the low conductance state. It may also explain the phenomena of ""open channel noise"" and ""substate behavior"" that characterize several endogenous ion channels and should be considered when modeling the behavior of such channels."

To examine roles of mammalian 8-oxo-dGTPase in the control of spontaneous mutagenesis as well as carcinogenesis, it is important to examine expression of the gene in various tissues, at different stages of development and under different physiological conditions, and to elucidate molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene expression. We isolated various types of MTH1 transcripts, each of which has a unique structure at its 5′-terminal region, and their relations to the genomic sequence were elucidated.

The RNA was precipitated on a 5.7 m cesium chloride cushion by centrifugation at 32,000 rpm for 40 h in a Beckman SW40Ti rotor at 15 °C. The RNA was dissolved in 4 mguanidine thiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate, 7% 2-mercaptoethanol, extracted with phenol and chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, then dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. To obtain poly(A)+ RNA, an oligo(dT)-cellulose spun column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was used, according to the manufacturer's manual. Purified poly(A)+ RNA was dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA. RNAs prepared from various human tissues were purchased fromCLONTECH Laboratories, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). Northern blotting was done as described (29Farrell Jr., R.E RNA Methodologies: A Laboratory Guide for Isolation and Characterization. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1993: 158-173Crossref Google Scholar). RNA (12 to 15 μg) was dissolved in 24 μl of sample buffer (50% formamide, 6.5% formaldehyde, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0), denatured at 65 °C for 5 min, and electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose containing 6.5% formaldehyde. RNA was transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (BA-85, Schreicher & Schuell Inc., Dassel, Germany) by capillary transfer (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning; A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and the membrane was baked at 80 °C for 2 h in vacuo. After prehybridization in 5 × SSPE (1 × SSPE: 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA), 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 200 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA/ml, overnight at 42 °C, the membrane was hybridized with 32P-labeled 461-bpNcoI-AspI fragment of MTH1 cDNA as a probe (1.25 ng/ml: specific radioactivity = 4.0 × 109 cpm/μg) in 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 200 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA per ml, for 16 h at 42 °C. The membrane was washed twice in 2 × SSC (1 × SSC: 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015m sodium citrate), 0.2% SDS at room temperature for 15 min, and then twice in 0.1 × SSC, 0.2% SDS for 15 min at 37 °C. Radioactivity on the membrane was measured in BAS 2000 Bio-image analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). To confirm amounts of RNA loaded, each blot was reprobed with a 1.0-kilobaseEcoRI-BamHI fragment of 18S rRNA gene prepared from pRγcHE (31Financsek I. Mizumoto K. Muramatsu M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1982; 18: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (10 ng/ml: specific radioactivity = 8.0 × 106 cpm/μg), obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank (JCRB). Oligonucleotide primers; MTH-Pr (TAGAGCCTGGAGGCGCCCATGGTCCCTGGG), MTH-P (CGGCCCCGAAGCCTCGCTTTTTCAT), MTH1–17 (TTCATGCCCAGGAGAAC), MTH2–17 (CCAGCACCAGGGTATAG), BML (GCACTTGACTATGACTGACTGAATTCTTTAGTGAGGGTTAATTGCC), BM-1 (CAATTAACCCTCACTAAAG), BM-2 (CTAAAGAATTCAGTCAGTC), T1 (AGCGGCGGTGCAGAACC), T2 (AAGCGGCGGTGCAGGTTT), T3 (AAGCGCGCGCGGGGATT), T4 (GGGCTTTCTGTATCCCTAG), and Ex531 (GCTCTGCGCCACTCAAT) were obtained from Kurabo (Osaka, Japan). The 5′ end of BML was phosphorylated while its 3′-hydroxyl end was blocked by adding an amino group. Primers for genomic PCR of MTH1 exon 2, 668-5 (CCCTGCCTTATCGCAAGG) and 491-3 (GGCCATCAACTGATGGAAC), and primers for direct sequencing of the PCR products, GT-GC1 (TGCCTTATCGCAAGGAC) and GT-GC2 (GGCGGTCAGAGGAGAGC), were obtained from Takara Shuzo. The 5′ end of oligonucleotide MTH-Pr was labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled oligonucleotide (1 × 106 cpm) was annealed with poly(A)+ RNA derived from Jurkat or HeLa S3 cells or yeast tRNA at 60 °C for 60 min. Hybridization was done in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 0.25 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA by incubating at 65 °C for 1 h. The material (20 μl) was mixed with 44.2 μl of a reaction mixture containing 68.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 15 mmdithiothreitol, 6.4 mm MgCl2, 75 μg/ml actinomycin D, 0.36 mm unlabeled dNTP, and 60 units of rRNasin (Promega, Madison, WI). Primer extension reaction was initiated by adding Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (500 units, Life Technologies, Inc.). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 or 42 °C for 90 min, followed by precipitation with ethanol. The precipitate was dissolved in 8 μl of formamide/loading dye and boiled for 3 min. The product (4 μl) was applied by electrophoresis to a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel with HinfI-digested pBR322 markers, labeled with 32P at the 5′ end. Radioactivity of the gel was analyzed using a BAS 2000 Bio-image analyzer. Single-strand ligation to ss-cDNA(SLIC)-PCR was performed as described by Baptiste et al. (32Baptiste J. Edwards D.M. Delort J. Mallet J. White B.A. PCR Protocols; Current Methods and Applications. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993: 365-385Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Single strand (ss)-cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA primed with 6 pmol of MTH-P primer in 33 μl of reaction mixture, using a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Pharmacia Biotech). The synthesized ss-cDNA was purified using a NICK column (Pharmacia Biotech), and the remaining MTH-P primer was removed using PrimeErase Quik Push Column (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). 100 μl of the purified ss-cDNA solution was mixed with 75 μl of 2 n NaOH for RNA hydrolysis and ss-cDNA was precipitated with ethanol. The 5′ end of BML primer was ligated to the 3′ end of synthesized ss-cDNA using T4 RNA ligase. PCR was performed in a reaction mixture containing an appropriate amount of ss-cDNA, 10 pmol each of MTH1–17 and BM1 primer, 10 nmol each of 4 types of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.001% gelatin, and 2.5 units of rTaq DNA polymerase in a final volume of 50 μl. The initial denaturation was done at 94 °C for 1 min, then amplification was performed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 2 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, using a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer). Following the first PCR, 1 μl of the reaction mixture was added to the second PCR reaction mixture. Cycles of the second PCR were run in the same manner except that MTH2–17 and BM2 primers were used. The PCR products were analyzed in 6% PAGE and cloned into pT7Blue T-vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed into ss-cDNA with MTH-P as a specific primer, using First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Pharmacia Biotech). To amplify a specific 5′ region for each type of MTH1 mRNA, PCR was done in 50 μl of a reaction mixture containing the first strand cDNA, 2.5 units of rTaq DNA polymerase, 10 μm sense primer for each type of MTH1 mRNA (T1 to T4), 10 μm antisense primer MTH2–17, and 200 μmdNTP. The initial denaturation was done at 94 °C for 1 min, then amplification was performed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min, followed by extension at 72 °C for 2 min. The PCR product (10 μl) was digested with NcoI, and analyzed by 8% PAGE. To amplify full-length MTH1 mRNA, oligo(dT)18 was used as a primer for synthesis of the first-strand cDNA. PCR was performed as described above, except that Ex531 was used as an antisense primer. PCR products (10 μl) were separated on 3% agarose gel electrophoresis (NuSieve 3:1 Agarose, FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME). DNA was transferred onto nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham), and the filter was processed for hybridization with 32P-labeled 461-bpNcoI-AspI fragment of MTH1 cDNA as a probe. Radioactivity on the membrane was measured in BAS 2000 Bio-image analyzer. Nucleotide sequence was determined using Dye Terminator or Dye Primer Cycle Sequencing FS Ready Reaction Kits and model 373A automated DNA sequencer (Perkin Elmer), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Genomic DNA was extracted from various types of human cell lines using ISOGEN kits (Nippon Gene). To amplify the entire region for MTH1 exon 2, PCR was done in 100 μl of reaction mixture containing 100 ng of genomic DNA, 10 μm each sense (668-5) or antisense primer (491-3), 200 μm dNTP, and 2.5 units of rTaq DNA polymerase. The initial denaturation was performed at 95 °C for 1 min, then amplification was done by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 45 s, annealing at 65 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 45 s, followed by extension at 72 °C for 3 min. The PCR product (254 bp) was purified using Microcon 100 (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA) and subjected to direct sequencing using Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing FS Ready Reaction Kits and oligonucleotides GT-GC1 and GT-GC2 as primers. Northern blot analysis was performed to determine levels of MTH1 mRNA in various tissues and cultured cell lines. As shown in Fig. 1, a band corresponding to 0.8-kilobaseMTH1 mRNA was detected in almost all of the samples examined, although intensities of the bands varied considerably. Radioactivities hybridized to MTH1 cDNA were quantified using an image analyzer, and standardized for radioactivities hybridized to 18 S ribosomal RNA, as shown in Table I. Relatively large amounts of mRNA were found in thymus and testis. Fetal tissues (brain and liver) also contained large amounts ofMTH1 mRNA.Table IMTH1 mRNA in human tissues and cellsMaterialsMTH1 mRNA18 SrRNARatioTissues Testis21.235.037.7 Thymus19.239.530.3 Cerebellum6.527.414.7 Cerebrum5.940.39.1 Small intestine5.239.08.2 Retina4.333.57.9 Mammary gland4.438.17.1 Ovary5.447.27.1 Lung4.640.57.0 Liver4.343.96.0 Skeletal muscle5.051.46.0 Heart3.240.24.9 Adrenal gland3.341.74.9 Placenta2.440.13.6 Kidney2.444.43.3 Thyroid gland1.938.92.9 Pancreas1.637.72.6 Salivary gland1.344.11.8 Spleen1.035.61.7Fetal tissues Liver11.250.513.7 Brain6.136.810.2Cell lines Jurkat63.039.3100* HeLa S316.040.224.8Radioactivities hybridized to MTH1 mRNA and 18 SrRNA, shown in Fig. 1, were measured by image analyzer and their ratios (relative ratios to Jurkat (*) as 100) calculated. Open table in a new tab Radioactivities hybridized to MTH1 mRNA and 18 SrRNA, shown in Fig. 1, were measured by image analyzer and their ratios (relative ratios to Jurkat (*) as 100) calculated. The content of MTH1 mRNA in Jurkat cells, a human T cell leukemia cell line, was exceedingly high, as compared with findings in adult and fetal human tissues, evidence in accord with the observation that Jurkat cells contain a large amount of MTH1 protein with 8-oxo-dGTPase activity (20Mo J.-Y. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11021-11025Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). HeLa cells, which also have a high proliferating capacity, had a lower but significantly large amount ofMTH1 mRNA. To assess the correlation between the cellular content of MTH1 mRNA and the proliferating capacity of cells, we measured mRNA levels in resting and actively proliferating cells. Lymphocytes in peripheral blood are mostly in the G0 state, and when stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and interleukin-2, they enter the proliferating cell cycles within 72 h, as evidenced by flow-cytometric analysis (data not shown). Total RNAs were prepared from the two phases of cells and levels of MTH1 mRNA determined by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, a large amount ofMTH1 mRNA was found in the RNA sample from the proliferating cells while a much lesser amount of mRNA was seen in the sample from the resting cells. About 7 times a larger amount of mRNA were found in the proliferating phase, as compared with findings in the resting one. Thus, expression of the MTH1gene is regulated so as to reflect the proliferative state of cell. To determine the transcription initiation site(s) for the MTH1gene, a primer extension experiment was done, the result of which is shown in Fig. 3. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from Jurkat cells, which exhibit an extremely high level of expression of the gene, and used for the analysis. Major extension products were detected around the 70-base region, and multiple extension products larger than 100 bases were also seen, at a relatively lower level. We obtained an essentially similar result with poly(A)+ RNA prepared from HeLa S3 cells, which produce about a quarter of the amount of mRNA, compared with Jurkat cells. Almost the same band patterns were obtained when the reaction was performed at either 37 or 42 °C (lanes 4 and 6 in Fig. 3), suggesting that these bands represent authentic transcription products, not artificially terminated ones. These results indicate that there are multiple 5′ ends of the MTH1 transcripts. To determine the nucleotide sequences of multiple 5′ ends of theMTH1 transcripts, SLIC-PCR was applied to amplify 5′ parts of the MTH1 cDNA species (Fig.4 A). If the MTH1 transcript has a N-base extended sequence beyond the MTH-Pr primer, a SLIC-PCR product of (75 + N) bp length, which is longer than the corresponding primer-extension product by 45 bases should be amplified. Indeed, various lengths of amplified products as seen in the primer extension were obtained. These products were subcloned and their sequences determined. All of 24 clones carrying MTH1 cDNAs less than 100 bp exhibited the same sequence corresponding to the 5′ part ofMTH1 cDNA originally isolated from Jurkat cells (24Sakumi K. Furuichi M. Tsuzuki T. Kakuma T. Kawabata S. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14659-14665Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), and this type of cDNA was named type 1. Among various sizes of PCR products obtained, a 35-base length sequence extending beyond the second exon was found as the longest 5′ part of the type 1 cDNA (Fig. 5). It is likely that the major extended product in the primer extension of MTH1 mRNA is 67 bases in length and represents the longest type 1 MTH1 mRNA (see Fig. 3). In SLIC-PCR, the longest type 1 mRNA is expected to be 112 bp in length, although there were two additional PCR products shorter than the 112-bp length product (Fig. 4 B). This discrepancy between the results of primer extension and SLIC-PCR would be due to a preferential amplification of the shorter extended products from type 1MTH1 mRNA. By subcloning of SLIC-PCR products longer than 100 bp, we found various types of 5′ sequences composed of different segments. These cDNAs were designated type 2, 3, and 4 MTH1 cDNAs according to their composition of the segments. Type 2 cDNA has an insertion between the first and the second exon of type 1 cDNA (Fig. 5). In type 2 cDNA, there are two types of insertions and, according to types of insertion, it can be divided into 2A and 2B. Type 2A carries a 51-bp insertion while type 2B a 124-bp insertion, the latter being composed of the 51-bp sequence and an additional 73-bp sequence. The 51-bp and the 73-bp sequences were designated exon 2b and 2c, respectively, since they were found to exist contiguously in the genomic sequence (see Fig. 6). Type 3 cDNA carries, in place of exon 1a, exon 1b sequence that locates downstream of the exon 1a sequence in the genomic DNA. This type of cDNA also carries two types of insertions corresponding to those of type 2A and 2B, and they were named type 3A and 3B, accordingly. Type 4 cDNA, which carries exon 2a in place of exon 1a or 1b, is classified into 4A and 4B. They carry insertions also corresponding to those of 2A and 2B, respectively. Constitutions of these various types of cDNAs are shown in Fig. 5. To show that these various types of MTH1 mRNAs are indeed present in cell, RT-PCR analysis was performed using total RNA prepared from Jurkat cells. Four types of PCR primers specific for the 5′ end of each MTH1mRNA species (T1 to T4, shown in Fig. 5) were prepared, and in combinations with the common 3′-primer (MTH2–17), specific regions of the mRNA were amplified as cDNA fragments. Fig.7 shows patterns of PAGE analysis. Except for the case of type 1 MTH1 mRNA that exists as a single form, two types each of cDNA fragments, corresponding to those having 51- and 124-bp insertions, were detected. When the amplified fragments were digested by NcoI restriction enzyme, which recognizes the CCATGG sequence present at the site for the MTH1 initiation codon, expected sizes of smaller fragments were produced. An additional small band present in lane 4 was not affected by NcoI digestion, and was disregarded. To determine if all of the multitypes of MTH1 mRNAs carry the coding sequence for MTH1 protein, we set up an experiment to amplify the entire coding region for MTH1 protein with the use of 5′ primers specific for each type of MTH1 mRNA. Total RNA was prepared from the human thymus, and the first strand cDNA was reverse-transcribed using an oligo(dT)18 primer to select functional poly(A)+ mRNAs. As shown in Fig.8, expected sizes of PCR products for 7 types ofMTH1 mRNA were obtained. Since there are some additional bands beside those with expected sizes, the PCR products were subjected to Southern hybridization with 32P-labeled MTH1cDNA as a probe. Only bands with expected sizes for theMTH1 mRNA species were detected (Fig. 8, lower panel). Thus, it seems clear that human cells contain functional multiforms of MTH1 mRNAs with various 5′ configurations. We reported earlier that the human MTH1 gene is composed of four exons (25Furuichi M. Yoshida M.C. Oda H. Tajiri T. Nakabeppu Y. Tsuzuki T. Sekiguchi M. Genomics. 1994; 24: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The present study has revealed that an additional exon must exist between the previously characterized first and second exons and, moreover, these exons are composed of more than two segments, which are transcribed together but spliced in a different manner. Based on alignment of the cDNA sequences and the genomic sequence, a new feature of the MTH1 gene, composed of 5 exons, now appears, for which exons are renamed according to their arrangements. The overall structure of the gene thus defined is shown in the upper part of Fig. 9. Various patterns of splicing, which would produce different forms of mRNAs, are shown in the lower part of Fig. 9. Alternative splicing of a single primary transcript would produce all types of mRNAs, although there remains the possibility that three types of primary transcripts, one for type 1 and 2, and the others for types 3 and 4, might be transcribed from different initiation sites. It should be noted that sequences that fit the GT/AG rule exist ar"

Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3228) Google Scholar). During embryogenesis, 70–80% of d(CpG) dinucleotides become methylated in a developmentally regulated, tissue-specific fashion (2Razin A. Cedar H. Jost J.P. Saluz H.P. DNA Methylation: Molecular Biology and Biological Significance. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1993: 343-357Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The methylation of regulatory DNA elements frequently results in the transcriptional silencing of proximal genes (3Kudo S. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13298-13302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although no general mechanism for this silencing has been identified, the methylation status of several DNA sequences is known to modulate binding by regulatory proteins (4Jane S.M. Gumucio D.L. Ney P.A. Cunningham J.M. Nienhuis A.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3272-3281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,5Nan X. Tate P. Li E. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The tissue-specific methylation patterns in mammalian cells presumably result from the action of the DNA methyltransferase in concert with other unidentified cellular factors (6Teubner B. Schulz W.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 165: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), such as chromatin packaging proteins (7Caiafa P. Reale A. Derme M. Allegra P. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 850-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that dictate this enzyme's specificity for certain d(CpG)'s within the genome. The DNA methyltransferase enzyme interacts with p23, a known component of the progesterone receptor complex (10Zhang X. Verdine G.L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and it is likely that control of genomic DNA methylation is coupled to receptor-mediated signaling systems in some, as yet unknown, way. A detailed knowledge of the factors involved in the regulation of the methyltransferase enzyme will be necessary to know how genomic methylation patterns are established. The murine DNA methyltransferase is an approximately 180–190-kDa enzyme that transfers a methyl group fromS-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) onto the C-5 position of cytosine within the d(CpG) dinucleotides of double-stranded DNA. Targeted disruption of the gene for this enzyme is lethal to embryos at the middle stages of gestation (1Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3228) Google Scholar). A number of functional domains of the enzyme have been identified and are presented in Fig. 1. The catalytic domain lies in the C-terminal third of the protein and contains regions of homology with the prokaryotic DNA methyltransferases, including a conserved AdoMet binding site and catalytic center. The N-terminal two-thirds of the enzyme is separated from the catalytic domain by a flexible hinge region consisting of glycine-lysine repeats (11Bestor T.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) and contains sequences that bind zinc and DNA independently (11Bestor T.H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2541-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, when purified in the presence of protease inhibitors, the DNA methyltransferase from murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells is detected as a single protein band on SDS-PAGE (22Xu G. Flynn J. Glickman J.F. Reich N.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 207: 544-551Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), casting doubt upon the presence of multiple enzyme forms. The original cDNA predicted a protein of 1573 amino acids, corresponding to a mass of 175 kDa (16Bestor T.H. Laudano A. Mattaliano R. Ingram V. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 971-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), but was later revised to 1502 amino acids (169 kDa) (Genbank accession X14805). Further revisions to the 5′ regions of the human and murine DNA methyltransferase genes now predict a protein of 182 kDa (17Yoder J.A. Yen R.-W.C. Vertino P.M. Bestor T.H. Baylin S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31092-31097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These data implicate a new translational start site resulting in an enzyme 118 amino acids longer than previously determined. Furthermore, these data suggest that a previously identified DNA methyltransferase promoter (19Rouleau J. Tanigawa G. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7368-7377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) would lie in an intron (17Yoder J.A. Yen R.-W.C. Vertino P.M. Bestor T.H. Baylin S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31092-31097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), upstream of the originally predicted start of translation in MEL cells. We have used sensitive mass spectroscopic techniques to map the peptides in the purified MEL DNA methyltransferase, studied post-translational modifications, and examined the N-terminal regions of the protein. Our data identify a major phosphorylation site on the DNA methyltransferase from murine erythroleukemia cells. The site lies in a region of the protein that is required for targeting of the methyltransferase to the replication foci during S phase of the cell cycle (15Leonhardt H. Page A.W. Weier H.U. Bestor T.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the murine DNA methyltransferase contains the newly reported N terminus, supporting a single start of translation at this new site. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed using 7.5% polyacrylamide, using broad range molecular weight protein standards (New England Biolabs). Transfer of proteins from polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose (MSI Inc.) or PVDF membranes (Millipore, Inc.) was performed using an Integrated Separation Systems semi-dry electroblotting apparatus set at 200 mA for 50 min. Purification of DNA methyltransferase from MEL cells was performed as described previously (22Xu G. Flynn J. Glickman J.F. Reich N.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 207: 544-551Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin and myosin as standards and validated by comparison with these standards on Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels. Purified homogeneous MEL DNA methyltransferase was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. N-Glycosylated andO-glycosylated polypeptides were detected by using a Glycotrack™ (Oxford Glycosystems) carbohydrate detection kit. Briefly, the putative glycoprotein immobilized to the nitrocellulose membranes was oxidized with a periodate solution and subsequently biotinylated with biotin hydrazide. The biotinylated glycopolypeptides were detected with a streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate. Ovalbumin (about 5% carbohydrate content) and biotinylated size markers were used as positive controls, and non-biotinylated size markers were used as negative controls. Suspension cultures of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells (2 × 107-2 × 108) cultured in 175-cm2 flasks to mid log phase (6 × 105/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% characterized bovine calf serum (HyClone) were washed with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Specialty Media, Inc.), labeled with 0.5–10 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (NEN Life Science Products) in 25 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media containing 0.1% bovine calf serum. After 12 h (1 doubling time), the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed two times in phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were homogenized in 0.2–2.0 ml of nuclear extraction buffer (10% sucrose, 0.3% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 3 mmMgCl2, supplemented with 1.0 mm of the phosphatase inhibitors, sodium molybdate, sodium fluoride, sodium vanadate, sodium orthophosphate, and 10 μm of the protease inhibitors, E-64, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin,l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone,N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone) by five passages through a 20-gauge needle. The extract was centrifuged at 4000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was suspended in nuclear extraction buffer containing 250 mm NaCl and homogenized by 12 presses in a small Dounce homogenizer. The suspension was centrifuged at 50,000 ×g for 60 min and the supernatant processed as described below. Cell-free extracts were added to 0.8–4.0 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS with protease inhibitors, and phosphatase inhibitors as described in the previous section), and the final NaCl concentration was brought to 150 mm. Immunoprecipitations were carried out by the addition of 5–30 μl of pATH 52 antiserum directed against a Trp E-methyltransferase N-terminal fusion encoding amino acids 256–754 (11Bestor T.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) or non-immune rabbit antiserum to the cell-free extracts, incubated for 1 h on ice, then added to a 50-μl pellet volume of protein A-Sepharose CL 4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and incubated with frequent agitation for 1 h on ice. The suspension was pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min and washed three times at room temperature in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% Tween 20. The final pellet was dissolved in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer supplemented with 2 mm dithiothreitol, heated at 70 °C for 10 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE for analysis. SDS-PAGE gels of the immunoprecipitates were transferred onto Immobilon PVDF membranes as described previously (23Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44915) Google Scholar). The membrane was air-dried and exposed to Fuji RX film at −70 °C for 24 h. The [32P]orthophosphate-labeled DNA methyltransferase was excised and extracted from the filter, acid-hydrolyzed as described previously (24Kamps M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and then subjected to thin layer cellulose chromatography as described (25Neufeld E. Goren H.J. Boland D. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) using 0.5 mNH4OH/isobutyric acid (5:3, v/v) as a solvent. Negative controls were performed by the excision of nonspecifically labeled bands from a lane on the PVDF membrane that was immunoprecipitated with non-immune rabbit serum. Phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine standards (500 ng, Sigma) were detected by ninhydrin spray (Sigma), and the experimental lanes were air-dried and detected by autoradiographic exposure to Fuji RX film at −70 °C for 36 h. In situ digestion and extraction of the DNA methyltransferase in SDS-PAGE gels was performed according to the method of Williams (26Williams K.R. Stone K.L. Matsudaira P. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 45-67Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA methyltransferase-containing bands (5–10 μg) were excised from Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels of immunoprecipitates from 32P-labeled MEL cells. The bands were washed by shaking for 30 min in ice-cold acetone, dried in a speed-vac, and then re-hydrated in 100 μl of 100 mmNH4HCO3, pH 7.8, for 4 h with gentle agitation. The buffer was changed once, and the bands were cut into three equal pieces followed by the addition of either trypsin (Sigma),l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated chymotrypsin (Boehringer Mannheim), or V8 protease (Boehringer Mannheim) (1 μg) and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. The supernatant was collected, and the remaining gel slices were extracted by shaking with an additional 100 μl of 100 mmNH4HCO3 for 4 h. The supernatant was saved, and a further extraction was performed with 2 m urea for 12 h. The collected supernatants were pooled and dried on a speed-vac. Samples were dissolved in 50 μl of HPLC grade water for subsequent chromatography. The recovery efficiency of the proteolytic fragment peptides from the gel was monitored by Cerenkov counting and ranged between 10% for V8 digests and 85% for tryptic digests. Murine DNA methyltransferase was purified to homogeneity at a concentration of 1.7 μm (300 μg/ml) from MEL cells as described previously (21Bestor T.H. Ingram V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2674-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This preparation (500 μl) was precipitated with 2 volumes of ice-cold acetone and centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 × g, and the pellet was washed with 70% ice-cold acetone. The pellet was resuspended in 10 μl of 8 m urea with repeated (three times) mixing and heating at 37 °C. The solution was brought to a final concentration of 17 μm protein, 2 m urea, and 100 mm NH4HCO3 in a 50-μl volume, pH 7.8, by the addition of HPLC grade water and a stock solution of 1m NH4HCO3. Calcium chloride was added to a concentration of 5 mm in the tryptic digests. l-1-Tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated chymotrypsin (Boehringer Mannheim) (7 μg), trypsin (Sigma) (5 μg), or V8 protease (Boehringer Mannheim) were added from 10 × stock solutions, and the digest was incubated at 37 °C for 12 h, sonicated for 5 min, and then supplemented with an additional 5 μg of protease. The digestion was allowed to continue for an additional 12 h prior to HPLC/ESI-MS analysis. A typical sample contained 20 pmol of32P-labeled DNA methyltransferase digested with protease in the gel, containing 300–1700 dpm, mixed with 200 pmol of purified DNA methyltransferase digested in the solution as described in the previous section. All chromatography was performed using a Michrom Ultrafast HPLC system (Michrom Bioresources, Sunnyvale, CA), equipped with a micro-flow cell UV absorbance detector set at 215-nm wavelength. A 1.0-mm inner diameter × 15.0 cm long C18, 300-μm reverse phase HPLC column (Michrom Bioresources, Sunnyvale, CA) was used to separate peptides derived from proteolytic digests of the DNA methyltransferase. Chromatography solvents were 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 1% acetonitrile (solvent A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 95% acetonitrile (solvent B). After loading the column with the proteolyzed DNA methyltransferase, a 5–10-min isocratic wash of 0% B was followed by a gradient of 0 to 95% solvent B over 30 min to 100 min at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. For analyses that required Cerenkov counting, the outlet of the UV absorbance detector flow cell was connected to a Pharmacia fraction collector with 30 cm of PEEK tubing (0.005-inch diameter, Upchurch Scientific Inc., Oak Harbor, WA). Fractions were collected at 1-min intervals and were counted for 2 min in a Beckman scintillation counter. For analyses that required electrospray mass spectrometry, the outlet of the UV absorbance detector flow cell was connected to the electrospray probe with 20 cm of PEEK tubing (0.005-inch diameter). Mass spectrometry was performed using a Fisons VG Platform II quadrupole mass spectrometer, equipped with a pneumatically assisted ESI source. The mass spectrometer was scanned repetitively over a mass to charge ratio (m/z) range of either 300–1500 or 400–1500, at a scan time of 2 s/scan, a 25–35 V orifice potential, and a cone temperature of 70 °C. Data were collected in centroid mode. MassLynx (Micromass Inc.) software provided with the mass spectrometer permitted mass spectra to be displayed for any observed peak of ion detection events, allowed background subtraction, as well as extraction of a defined input m/z from the data set. A Biolynx peptide analysis algorithm (Micromass Inc.) was used to predict the peptide products of proteolytic digests of the murine DNA methyltransferase (Genbank accession number X14805) and to search ESI-MS data for these products. Manual searching of data sets was also used. The glycosylation state of the purified MEL DNA methyltransferase was analyzed using a Glycotrack™ carbohydrate detection kit. Our results showed that glycosylation of the homogeneous enzyme was not detectable. We were able to detect glycosyl moieties in 35 ng of ovalbumin which is 5% glycosylated by weight, whereas glycosylation was not detected in 4 μg of either MEL-DNA methyltransferase or recombinant DNA methyltransferase (data not shown). Post-translational phosphorylation was detected by 32P labeling of the DNA methyltransferase in MEL cells. Immunoprecipitations with anti-methyltransferase antibodies from [32P]orthophosphate-treated MEL cells resulted in the recovery of 32P-labeled DNA methyltransferase as detected by x-ray film exposed to SDS-PAGE gels of the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2 A). The DNA methyltransferase band was excised from the gel along with the nonspecific gel slice from a non-immune rabbit antiserum. In 10-mCi labeling experiments using 2 × 108 to 5 × 108 MEL cells, the DNA methyltransferase band repeatedly contained 9000–11,400 dpm by Cerenkov counting, whereas negative control gel slices, produced by a non-immune antiserum, resulted in 680 dpm, indicating that the 32P label was specifically associated with the Coomassie-detectable DNA methyltransferase and not with any other portion of the gel. The phosphorylation state of the DNA methyltransferase was not affected by serum starvation for 30 h prior to labeling, serum starvation, and replenishment or by treatment of MEL cells with the phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid (0.1 μm), for 24 h prior to labeling. The major sites of protein phosphorylation in vertebrate cells are on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues (27Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). To determine which type of amino acid was phosphorylated, the 32P-labeled DNA methyltransferase was acid-hydrolyzed into individual amino acids, and the amino acids were separated by thin layer chromatography. The presence of [32P]phosphate was detected by x-ray film. Fig. 3 shows that the primary sites of phosphorylation reside on serine or threonine, because the majority of label co-migrated with the phosphoserine and phosphothreonine standards. HPLC was used to separate peptides derived from proteolytic digests of the DNA methyltransferase. Cerenkov counting of the HPLC column fractions was used to detect32P-labeled peptides, and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was used to measure the masses of these peptides. These studies required the use of highly pure DNA methyltransferase (Fig.2 C), since other proteins in the preparation might result in the detection of spurious masses. 32P-Labeled DNA methyltransferase was obtained from immunoprecipitated nuclear extracts of metabolically labeled MEL cells, which was excised from SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 2 B). The 32P-labeled DNA methyltransferase was separated from the IgG subunits of the antibody by excision of the methyltransferase from the SDS-PAGE gel (see “Materials and Methods”). Because only a small amount (3–10 pmol) of the DNA methyltransferase-derived peptides were extracted for any single digest, the samples were supplemented with digested, non-labeled (Fig. 2 C) DNA methyltransferase purified from MEL cells (50–200 pmol). In these experiments, 60–95% of the total32P label (200–1200 dpm) eluted in a small retention window (3 min), and the remaining 5–40% of loaded counts were distributed throughout the HPLC gradient. Over 60% of the predicted masses were detected in each digest, resulting in the assignment of over 80% of the DNA methyltransferase sequence, spanning the entire protein. Less than 8% of the detected m/z's were not predicted by the cDNA. Two criteria were used to identify phosphorylated peptides as follows: (i) the peak of [32P] in the HPLC chromatogram, and (ii) an 80-atomic mass unit increase from the predicted mass of peptides generated by sequence-specific proteases. Our data identified serine 514 as a major phosphorylation site. Digests with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and Staphylococcus aureus V8 proteases demonstrated masses that differed by 80 atomic mass units from the predicted peptides containing serine 514. A summary of the mass spectrometry data showing the structure of the phosphorylated peptide, and its predicted cleavage sites by S. aureus V8, trypsin, and chymotrypsin is shown in Fig. 7. In tryptic and chymotryptic digests the non-phosphorylated peptide was detected at a retarded retention time consistent with its increased hydrophobicity. The V8, chymotryptic, and tryptic phosphopeptides containing serine 514 were co-retained with the 32P label on C18columns. Figs. 4, 5, 6 present the data from peptide mapping experiments using C18 chromatography to separate digests of the32P-labeled DNA methyltransferase. The tryptic digest (Fig. 4 A) produced a peak of 32P label in the pre-gradient volume, indicating that the peptide had very low affinity for the stationary phase. The phosphopeptide and peak of32P label eluted with many unassigned large molecule contaminants in the pre-gradient volume. This fraction was collected and purified on the same C18 column coupled to the mass spectrometer. This additional step served to separate the phosphopeptide from these contaminants. Fig. 4 shows the co-retention of m/z 702 with the 32P label, corresponding to the singly charged phosphopeptide, IYISpK (T84 + Pi), containing serine 514.Figure 5HPLC-ESI-MS of 32P-labeled chymotryptic peptides of the DNA methyltransferase. 210 pmol (10 pmol of 32P-labeled (400 dpm) and 200 pmol of unlabeled) of chymotryptic digest of the murine DNA methyltransferase was loaded onto C-18 column connected to either a fraction collector (B) or the ESI-MS (A).

https://openalex.org/W2044136800,"We report the purification and biochemical characterization of the cobalamin biosynthetic enzyme nicotinate-mononucleotide:5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole phosphoribosyltransferase (CobT) from Salmonella typhimurium. cobT was overexpressed and the protein purified to approximately 97% homogeneity. NH2-terminal sequence analysis confirmed that the protein encoded by cobT was purified. Homogeneous CobT catalyzed the synthesis ofN 1-(5-phospho-α-D-ribosyl)-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole. The identity of high performance liquid chromatography-purified product was confirmed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. CobT activity was optimal at 45 °C and pH 10.0. The apparentK m for nicotinate mononucleotide was 680 μm; the apparent K m for 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole was less than 10 μm. CobT used nicotinamide mononucleotide as a ribose phosphate donor. CobT phosphoribosylated alternative base substrates including benzimidazole, 4,5-dimethyl-1,2-phenylenediamine, imidazole, histidine, adenine, and guanine in vitro. The resulting ribotides were incorporated into cobamides that were differentially utilized by methionine synthase (EC 2.1.1.13), ethanolamine ammonia-lyase (EC 4.3.1.7), and 1,2-propanediol dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.28) in vivo.

(Fig. 1). Cobamides containing compounds other than 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (Me2Bza) as lower (Coα) ligands have been isolated from other prokaryotes. The lower ligands fall within two classes: (i) derivatives or analogs of benzimidazole (Bza) (e.g. 5-hydroxybenzimidazole, 5-methylbenzimidazole, 5-methoxy-6-methylbenzimidazole, adenine) (3Stupperich E.

It is unclear why some cobamide-producing prokaryotes have evolved to synthesize these alternative cobamides. Cobamide-producing prokaryotes can be guided into synthesizing cobamides containing a lower ligand base different from the one usually found in the de novo synthesized cobamide by exogenously providing the alternative base to growing cells. Examples of this phenomenon termed “guided biosynthesis” have been documented (1Johnson M.G. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol.

This proposal was based on the observation that partially purified NaMN:Me2Bza phosphoribosyltransferases from Propionibacterium shermanni and from Clostridium sticklandii were both shown to use a variety of base substrates in place of Me2Bza in vitro (10Friedmann H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 413-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Fyfe J.A. Friedmann H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1659-1666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was proposed that this lack of base substrate specificity was likely responsible for the incorporation of alternative bases into cobamidesin vivo. However, the incorporation of alternative NaMN:Me2Bza phosphoribosyltransferase products generatedin vitro into active cobamides in vivo was not demonstrated. In this paper we report the purification and biochemical characterization of the NaMN:Me2Bza phosphoribosyltransferase (CobT) from S. typhimurium. Previously we established a correlation between the presence of CobT and phosphoribosyltransferase activity using crude cell-free extracts containing increased levels of CobT protein (12Trzebiatowski J.R. O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3568-3575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper we demonstrate that homogeneous CobT is necessary and sufficient for the synthesis ofN 1-(5-phospho-α-D-ribosyl)-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (α-ribazole 5′-phosphate) (Fig. 2) and that the enzyme phosphoribosylates a wide range of alternative base substrates in vitro. We also present evidence that the resulting ribotides are incorporated into active cobamides in vivo. These results strongly support that CobT is responsible for the incorporation of alternative lower ligands into cobamides in S. typhimurium. Additionally, this result may help explain the inability to isolate mutants blocked in the synthesis of Me2Bza in this bacterium. The two bacterial strains used in this work were derivatives ofS. typhimurium strain LT2 and contained metE205 ara-9 mutations in the background. Strain JE2461 (cobA367::Tn10d(Tc)/pGP1–2 T7rpo + kan + pJO27 bla + + cobT + (cloning vector: pT7–5)) (12Trzebiatowski J.R. O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3568-3575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to increase the cellular level of CobT. Strain JE3762 (metE205 ara-9 cobB1206::MudJ DELcob291 strA1) was used in the biological activity assay system described below. DELcob291 spans the entire cobT gene (13Escalante-Semerena J.C. Johnson M.G. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 24-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The composition of complex and chemically defined culture media and the concentration of nutritional supplements and antibiotics have been reported (14Vogel H.J. Bonner D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. A Manual for Genetic Engineering: Advanced Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980: 201-207Google Scholar). Growth conditions for cobT overexpression were as follows. One-liter cultures of strain JE2461 were grown with shaking (180 orbits/min) in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with ampicillin (60 μg/ml) and kanamycin (60 μg/ml) in 2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks at 30 °C for 3.5 h (about 3 × 108 colony-forming units/ml; 55–70 Klett units). Overexpression of the CobT protein was induced by transferring the cultures to a 42 °C shaking water bath (200 rpm). After 30 min at 42 °C, the cultures were transferred to 37 °C and incubated with shaking (180 orbits/min) for 3 h. Growth conditions for the biological activity assays were as follows. Cells grown overnight in complex medium were pelleted and washed three times with 14.5 mm sterile NaCl. Approximately 108 cells were resuspended in 3 ml of molten 0.7% (w/v) agar and overlaid on one of the following: (i) Vogel-Bonner minimal medium containing glucose (11 mm) as carbon and energy source and cobinamide (20 nm); or (ii) No carbon Vogel-Bonner minimal medium containing 1,2-propanediol (50 mm) or ethanolamine (20 mm) as carbon and energy source, cobinamide (20 nm), and methionine (0.3 mm). Cbl (7 pmol) was spotted onto each plate to serve as the positive control; Me2Bza, 4,5-dimethyl-1,2-phenylenediamine (Me2Pda), Bza, histidine, adenine, guanine, or imidazole (150 nmol) was spotted and served as the negative control. Plates were incubated at 37 °C. Cbl biosynthesis was assessed in vivo by demanding strain JE3762 to grow under conditions that required the synthesis and utilization of Cbl. Strain JE3762 was unable to synthesize Cbl from its precursors cobinamide and Me2Bza but synthesized Cbl when provided with α-ribazole 5′-phosphate. Two in vivobiological activity assays with different sensitivities were employed. Methionine synthase catalyzes the last step in methionine biosynthesis. The metEand metH genes of S. typhimurium LT2 encode different methionine synthase enzymes. The activity of MetH (EC2.1.1.13) is Cbl-dependent, whereas that of MetE (E.C.2.1.1.14) is Cbl-independent (16Taylor R.T. Weissbach H. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 9. Academic Press, New York1973: 121-165Google Scholar). Strain JE3762 carries ametE mutation that forces the cells to synthesize methionine using the MetH enzyme. Therefore, derivatives of metEmutants unable to synthesize Cbl are phenotypically methionine or Cbl auxotrophs (17Jeter R.M. Olivera B.M. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 206-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 25 Cbl molecules/cell satisfy the methionine requirement of a growing cell (18Bradbeer C. Dolphin D. B12. 2. John Wiley and Sons, New York1982: 31-56Google Scholar). Ethanolamine ammonia-lyase (EC 4.3.1.7), the first enzyme in ethanolamine catabolism in S. typhimuriumLT2, requires Ado-Cbl to function (19Chang G.W. Chang J.T. Nature. 1975; 254: 150-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). 1,2-Propanediol dehydratase (EC4.2.1.28), which catalyzes the first step in 1,2-propanediol catabolism in this bacterium, is also an Ado-Cbl-dependent enzyme (20Poznanskaja A.A. Tanizawa K. Soda K. Toraya T. Fukui S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 194: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar,21Jeter R.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, strains that cannot synthesize Ado-Cbl are unable to utilize 1,2-propanediol or ethanolamine as carbon and energy sources. Approximately 500 Cbl molecules/cell are needed for continued growth on ethanolamine (18Bradbeer C. Dolphin D. B12. 2. John Wiley and Sons, New York1982: 31-56Google Scholar). The in vitro phosphoribosyltransferase assay relies on changes in the chromatographic behavior of radiolabeled Me2Bza as described elsewhere (12Trzebiatowski J.R. O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3568-3575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CobT protein was diluted with glycine-NaOH buffer (50 mm, pH 10.0) containing bovine serum albumin (0.5 mg/ml) and sodium azide (0.03%, 4.6 mm). The final concentration of bovine serum albumin in the reaction mixture was 0.05 mg/ml. The reaction mixture volume was 20 μl and contained homogeneous CobT (0.012 μg), NaMN (100 nmol), [2-14C]Me2Bza (2 nmol, 42.5 μCi/μmol), and glycine-NaOH buffer (2 μmol, pH 10.0) unless otherwise stated. Reactions were run for 10 min at 37 °C unless otherwise stated. A unit of CobT activity was defined as the amount of enzyme needed to synthesize 1 μmol of α-ribazole 5′-phosphate/min. This assay was used for different analyses as described below. The reaction mixtures contained [2-14C]Me2Bza (2.5 nmol), unlabeled Me2Bza (20 nmol), and NaMN (20 nmol). The amount of enzyme assayed was always within the linear portion of the rateversus [enzyme] plot. The amounts of protein used for each purification step were: crude cell-free extract, 0.7 μg; phenyl-Sepharose-purified CobT protein, 0.19 μg; Cibracon Blue-purified CobT protein, 0.09 μg. Reactions were run in duplicate and averaged. The reaction mixtures contained [2-14C]Me2Bza (2.5 nmol), unlabeled Me2Bza (20 nmol), and NaMN (20 nmol). Assays were performed at pH 9.7. For each optimization condition, the average of five independent reactions is reported. For optimal pH assays, the following buffers were used: phosphoric acid, pH 12.0; disodium hydrogen phosphate-NaOH, pH 11.0; glycine-NaOH, pH 10.0, pH 9.7; CHES, pH 9.0; HEPES, pH 8.5, pH 8.0; and MOPS, pH 7.0. The product of the reaction was detected using a PhosphorImager 4451 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). After separation of product ([14C-2]α-ribazole 5′-phosphate) from reactant ([14C-2]Me2Bza) by thin layer chromatography (see below), the thin layer chromatography sheet was exposed to a PhosphorImager screen for 20–25 h, and the percentage of total radioactivity in an assay corresponding to [14C-2]α-ribazole 5′-phosphate was determined. Background was determined from a no-enzyme control. The amount of radioactivity in a sample (7 μl) from the reaction mixture was assessed by scintillation counting to determine the total number of counts in the reaction mixture. The total number of counts in the assay corresponding to product was then determined. Radiolabeled Me2Bza was synthesized as described (12Trzebiatowski J.R. O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3568-3575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. 20 μmol of [14C]formic acid (NEN Life Science Products; specific radioactivity, 55 mCi/mmol) and 40 μmol of Me2Pda were used in a 100-ml final volume. Radiolabeled [14C-2]Me2Bza (42.5 μCi/μmol) was stored in 100% methanol at 0 °C. The kinetic constants for NaMN were determined by holding [2-14C]Me2Bza constant at a saturating concentration (2 nmol) while the NaMN concentration was varied. For the kinetic analysis of Me2Bza, a saturating concentration of NaMN (100 nmol) was used while the Me2Bza concentration was varied. Data from four independent trials were analyzed with the nonlinear regression data analysis program Enzfitter (Elsevier-Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) was substituted for NaMN in reaction mixtures containing varying concentrations of NMN and a saturating concentration of [14C-2]Me2Bza (2 nmol). Data from three independent trials were analyzed with the nonlinear regression data analysis program Enzfitter. Ribose 5′-phosphate (0.96 μmol, 160 nmol, and 16 nmol) was substituted for NaMN in reaction mixtures. Bza, Me2Pda, imidazole, histidine, adenine, or guanine (1 μmol each) was added to the reaction mixture in lieu of Me2Bza. Because these compounds were not radioactive, formation of products was detected using a biological activity assay (see above). If the reaction mixture restored the ability of strain JE3762 to make a physiologically active cobamide, growth was observed. To increase the amount of product, assays were scaled up to 1 ml (50-fold) and contained 15 μg of CobT and 3 μmol of NaMN. Assays were run at pH 10.0, incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, heat inactivated at 90 °C for 15 min, centrifuged for 10 min (14,800 × g) in a Marathon 13K/M microcentrifuge (Fisher Scientific), and the supernatant concentrated under vacuum with a SpeedVac concentrator (Savant Instruments, Inc., Farmingdale, NY). Assays were resuspended in 50 μl of double-distilled water, and a sample (10 μl) was tested for biological activity. Identical assays were run without CobT to demonstrate the dependence of the biological activity on CobT. Phosphoribosyltransferase reactions were performed using [8-14C] adenine in place of Me2Bza. The 20-μl reactions used 100 nmol of NaMN and 0.18 μg of CobT. The assay was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. HPLC purification of the CobT reaction product was performed as described previously (12Trzebiatowski J.R. O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3568-3575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Native molecular mass analysis of CobT was performed using a BioSep-SEC-S2000 column (300 × 7.8 mm; Phenomenex, Reno, NV) equilibrated with 50 mm H2PO4, pH 7.0, at a rate of 1 ml/min. Protein elution was monitored at 280 nm. Protein molecular weight standards used included blue dextran, cytochrome c, carbonic anhydrase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and β-amylase (Sigma). A 20-μl sample (4 mg/ml) was injected. All samples were run twice and averaged. The elution time for CobT was 7 min. Thin layer chromatography analysis of the CobT reaction products was performed as described previously (12Trzebiatowski J.R. O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3568-3575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Silica gel plates (20 × 10 cm) were used; 1-cm-wide lanes separated by 0.5 cm were scored on the plates; plates were developed for approximately 45 min using CHCl3:MeOH (3:2). UV-visible spectroscopy and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry of the CobT reaction product were performed as described (12Trzebiatowski J.R. O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3568-3575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. The buffer used throughout the purification was 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (at 4 °C). Additions to this buffer are stated below. The buffers used throughout the purification (except to resuspend the cells) contained ethylene glycol or glycerol as indicated to stabilize the protein. A 2-liter culture of strain JE2461 was grown under conditions that overexpressed cobT. The resulting 3.4 g of wet paste was resuspended in 45 ml of buffer. After the addition of protease inhibitors (EDTA, 1 mm; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm), cells were broken by sonication (18 min, 50% duty cycle; setting 5) using a model 550 Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher Scientific). To minimize heat denaturation of protein during sonication, the extract was maintained at a temperature below 15 °C. Cell debris was removed by centrifuging at 44,000 × gfor 1 h (Sorvall RC-5B refrigerated centrifuge, DuPont Instruments). Finely ground Ultrapure™ ammonium sulfate (Schwarz/Mann, ICN Biomedicals Inc., Cleveland, OH) was added to the extract to 10% saturation, incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, and centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g to remove precipitates. Ethylene glycol was added to the supernatant (10% (v/v), i.e. 1.8m). The extract was loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma) column (2.5 × 6.0 cm, a 30-ml bed volume) equilibrated with buffer containing 1.8 m ethylene glycol and 10% saturation ammonium sulfate. The column was equilibrated and developed at a flow rate of 30 ml/h. After loading, the column was washed with 30 ml of the equilibrating buffer followed by a 150-ml linear gradient that simultaneously decreased the amount of ammonium sulfate from 10% saturation to zero and increased the ethylene glycol concentration from 1.8 to 8.9 m; the gradient was followed by a 60-ml wash with buffer containing 8.9 m ethylene glycol. CobT eluted from the column toward the end of the gradient. Fractions containing CobT were identified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. CobT fractions were pooled and loaded directly onto the next column. The sample was loaded onto a 1.5 × 14-cm Cibracon Blue 3GA (Sigma) column (25-ml bed volume) equilibrated with buffer containing 5.4 m ethylene glycol at a flow rate of 25 ml/h. After loading the sample, the column was washed with 50 ml of buffer containing 1.4 m glycerol and 200 mm NaCl; the column was developed with a 125-ml linear gradient to buffer containing 1 m NaCl and 1.4m glycerol; the column was further washed with 50 ml of buffer containing 2 m NaCl and 1.4 m glycerol. CobT eluted within the gradient, with the peak of protein detected at 450 mm NaCl. A cross-section of the CobT-containing fractions revealed homogeneous CobT as judged from Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels. These homogeneous fractions were pooled, concentrated using a Centriprep-10 (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA), and dialyzed overnight against buffer containing 2.7 mglycerol. The enzyme was aliquoted and stored at −89 °C in a Revco freezer. The NH2-terminal sequence of purified CobT was determined at the Protein/Nucleic Acid Shared Facility at the Medical College of Wisconsin (Milwaukee, WI) using conventional Edman sequence chemistry. Sequencing was conducted with a Beckman/Porton LF 3000 gas phase sequenator. Data were reported using the Beckman system Gold software. Protein concentrations were determined by a modification of the turbidimetric method reported by Kunitz (22Kunitz M.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1952; 35: 423-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) using a standard curve generated using known quantities of bovine serum albumin. These values corresponded well to values obtained using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit, which is based on the Bradford dye-binding procedure (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed with 12% polyacrylamide gels (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Blue (25Sasse J. Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. Wiley Interscience, New York1991: 10.6.1-10.6.8Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE standards included phosphorylaseb, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, carbonic anhydrase, and trypsin inhibitor (Bio-Rad). The native isoelectric point (pI) of CobT was determined as reported (26Bollag D.M. Edelstein S.J. Protein Methods. John Wiley and Sons, New York1991: 162-180Google Scholar). Conductivity measurements were performed using a model 35 YSI conductivity meter (Yellow Springs, OH). Densitometry scans were performed with a GS300 Transmittance/Reflectance Scanning Densitometer (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco). cobT was overexpressed using a construct wherecobT was transcribed from a bacteriophage T7 promoter (27Tabor S. Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. Wiley Interscience, New York1990: 16.2.1.-16.2.11Google Scholar). The cloning of this construct was described previously (28O'Toole G.A. Rondon M.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3317-3326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on densitometry scans of Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels, CobT was judged to be approximately 12% of the total soluble protein in crude cell-free extract of the overexpressing strain (data not shown). The relative mobility of CobT in this system was determined previously (28O'Toole G.A. Rondon M.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3317-3326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purification of CobT from crude cell-free extract is summarized in Table I. CobT specific activity in the crude extract (Table I) was determined 12 h after sonication and storage at 4 °C. This value (0.22 unit/mg), was 1.5-fold lower than the specific activity obtained immediately after sonication (0.33 unit/mg), suggesting inactivation or degradation of CobT. Interestingly, after the initial loss of activity, the specific activity did not decrease any further, even after 1 week of continued storage at 4 °C (data not shown). One explanation for these results may be that whatever was responsible for inactivating or degrading CobT also became inactivated or degraded.Table ICobT purification profileTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgμmol product/minunits/mg protein%-foldCell-free extract256.555.80.21000Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B27.651.11.9928.5Cibracon Blue 3GA5.324.04.54320.7 Open table in a new tab The purification of CobT is shown in Fig. 3. CobT was 97% pure as judged by densitometry scans of Coomassie-stained 12% SDS-PAGE (lane C, Fig. 3). The NH2-terminal sequence (21 amino acids) of homogeneous CobT was determined by automated Edman degradation. The amino acid sequence of homogeneous CobT was identical to that predicted from the DNA sequence confirming that the cobT product had been purified. Additionally, the sequence established that as predicted elsewhere (29Lawrence J. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6371-6380Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the translational start site was 30 bases downstream of the start site originally proposed (30Roth J.R. Lawrence J.G. Rubenfield M. Kieffer-Higgins S. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3303-3316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, using crude cell-free extract containing increased levels of CobT, we demonstrated that CobT was the NaMN:Me2Bza phosphoribosyltransferase responsible for the synthesis of α-ribazole 5′-phosphate, an intermediate in the assembly of the nucleotide loop of Cbl (Fig. 2) (12Trzebiatowski J.R. O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3568-3575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using homogeneous CobT, we repeated these experiments to investigate the exact requirements for this activity in vitro. After HPLC purification, the identity of the product was confirmed by UV-visible spectroscopy and mass spectral analysis to be α-ribazole 5′-phosphate (data not shown). In addition, the product was determined to be biologically active, i.e. it restored the ability of acobT mutant strain (JE3762) to synthesize Cbl. Therefore, it was concluded that homogeneous CobT was necessary and sufficient to generate α-ribazole 5′-phosphate from NaMN and Me2Bzain vitro. The optimal temperature for CobT activity was 45 °C (6.3 units/mg). CobT maintained 12% of its specific activity at 65 °C (0.8 unit/mg) and 45% at 30 °C (2.8 units/mg). Although maximum activity was obtained at 45 °C, activity assays were performed routinely at the more physiological temperature of 37 °C. The optimal pH for CobT activity was pH 10.0 (6.5 units/mg). CobT maintained 28% of its specific activity at pH 8.0 (1.8 units/mg) and 2% at pH 11.0 (0.11 unit/mg). CobT was preincubated for 10 min at several temperatures by itself, or with NaMN (20 nmol), or with Me2Bza (20 nmol). CobT was then assayed for phosphoribosyltransferase activity at 37 °C. The specific activities were compared with the one observed when CobT was preincubated on ice. Preincubation at 37 °C with no additions resulted in a drop in specific activity (2.5 units/mg versus 5.4 units/mg,i.e. 46% of the specific activity of CobT kept on ice). However, CobT activity was stable to temperatures as high as 50 °C when preincubated with NaMN (4.5 units/mg). We concluded that NaMN has a stabilizing effect on CobT at increased temperatures. Me2Bza did not increase CobT stability at any temperature (data not shown). CobT activity was inhibited about 2.6 fold at increased Me2Bza concentrations. CobT activity at 1.0 mm Me2Bza was 5.9 units/mg compared with 15.1 units/mg at 0.1 mm Me2Bza. CobT activity was linear with respect to protein concentration up to 0.02 μg. CobT activity was linear with respect to time up to 12 min. Based on the cobTnucleotide sequence, CobT was predicted to be 356 amino acids in length with a molecular mass of 36,560 Da. This value corresponded well to the position of homogeneous CobT on 12% SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 3, lane C). Native molecular mass was determined by gel filtration chromatography to be about 68,000 Da, suggesting that native CobT was a dimer. The experimentally determined isoelectric point revealed two bands on isoelectric focusing gels corresponding to a pI of 5.8 and 5.6. Both points differ from the predicted isoelectric point for denatured protein, 6.1. The molar extinction coefficient of CobT at 280 nm was predicted to be 9,970 using the Edelhoch method as described (31Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3436) Google Scholar). Based on data from four independent trials, the apparentK m of CobT for NaMN was 680 μm, theV max was 134 pmol of product/min, and thek cat was 817 pmol of product/min/pmol of CobT dimer. The apparent K m value (680 μm) was similar to the CobT homolog from C. sticklandii (700 μm) (11Fyfe J.A. Friedmann H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1659-1666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 8-fold higher than the homolog fromPseudomonas denitrificans (83 μm) (32Cameron B. Blanche F. Rouyez M.-C. Bisch D. Famechon A. Couder M. Cauchois L. Thibaut D. Debussche L. Crouzet J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6066-6073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent K m of CobT for Me2Bza could not be determined because of the low specific activity of [2-14C]Me2Bza. However, we were able to conclude that the apparent K m was less than 10 μm (data not shown). The P. denitrificanshomolog had a K m for Me2Bza of 16 nm (32Cameron B. Blanche F. Rouyez M.-C. Bisch D. Famechon A. Couder M. Cauchois L. Thibaut D. Debussche L. Crouzet J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6066-6073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The K m for Me2Bza of the C. sticklandii homolog was not determined. NMN and ribose 5′-phosphate were both tried in lieu of NaMN in phosphoribosyltransferase reactions. CobT used NMN as substrate in vitro; however, CobT phosphoribosyltransferase activity was inhibited at [NMN] > 40 mm. Because of this inhibition, kinetic parameters were derived from a rate curve that did not reach saturation. Based on data from three independent trials, the apparent K m of CobT for NMN was 30 mm, 44-fold higher than the one measured for NaMN. This supports the idea that NaMN is the in vivo substrate for CobT. The V max was 114 pmol of product/min, and the k cat was 695 pmol of product/min/pmol of CobT dimer. The CobT utilization of NMN was in contrast to the C. sticklandii homolog, which did not utilize NMN as a substrate (11Fyfe J.A. Friedmann H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1659-1666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ribose 5′-phosphate was not utilized by CobT. Phosphoribosyltransferase activity assays were performed with a variety of bases in place of Me2Bza including Bza, Me2Pda, imidazole, histidine, adenine, and guanine. Formation of product was detected using biological activity assays. If the reaction mixture restored the ability of strain JE3762 to make an active cobamide, growth was observed. No attempt was made to quantitate the growth response. Representative bioassay results are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. Reaction mixtures containing Me2Bza, Me2Pda, or Bza resulted in a product that restored growth when assaying methionine synthase (Fig.4), 1,2-propanediol dehydratase (data not shown), and ethanolamine ammonia-lyase (data not shown). However, imidazole, histidine, adenine, and guanine reaction mixtures restored growth when assaying ethanolamine ammonia-lyase (Fig. 5) and 1,2-propanediol dehydratase (data not shown) but not methionine synthase (data not shown). These data demonstrate CobT recognition of a variety of base substratesin vitro, generation of cobamides from the CobT reaction products in vivo, and utilization of the resulting cobamides by cobamide-dependent enzymes in vivo. The implications of these results are addressed under “Discussion.”Figure 5Evidence of CobT utilization of histidine, adenine, guanine, and imidazole using the ethanolamine ammonia-lyase biological activity assay. CobT phosphoribosyltransferase reactions were performed with adenine (plate A), guanine (plate B), histidine (plate C), and imidazole (plate D) in place of Me2Bza. Growth of strain JE3762 in response to the CobT reaction mixtures indicated that CobT utilized histidine, adenine, guanine, and imidazole in vitroand that the products were transformed into active cobamides utilized by ethanolamine ammonia-lyase in vivo. Biological activity assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”No CobT refers to reaction mixtures containing no enzyme. Inplate B precipitate (not growth) is observed where the No CobT reaction mixture was spotted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CobT utilization of adenine was tested directly by performing phosphoribosyltransferase activity assays using [8-14C]adenine in place of [2-14C]Me2Bza followed by separation of product from reactant by thin layer chromatography. Because the product, adenine ribose 5′-phosphate, had been reported to be heat-sensitive (11Fyfe J.A. Friedmann H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1659-1666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the assays were terminated either with acid or heat. Regardless of the method of assay termination, CobT utilized adenine (1 mm) as a substrate with a specific activity of 0.8 unit/mg, 15-fold less active than the positive control Me2Bza (12 units/mg). We have demonstrated CobT recognition of a variety of bases as substrates in vitro and the incorporation of these alternative products into active cobamides in vivo. We know that the resulting cobamides in the case of the histidine, adenine, guanine, and imidazole reactions are not transformed into Cbl because no growth response was observed when methionine synthase activity was demanded. This supports that S. typhimurium incorporated the CobT in vitro reaction products directly into a cobamidein vivo. These results provide strong support for the role of the NaMN:Me2Bza phosphoribosyltransferase in the incorporation of alternative lower ligands into cobamides in nature and during guided biosynthesis. Additionally, these results demonstrate that methionine synthase, ethanolamine ammonia-lyase, and 1,2-propanediol dehydratase have different requirements for the identity of the lower ligand. Methionine synthase was more stringent than ethanolamine ammonia-lyase or 1,2-propanediol dehydratase in its utilization of different cobamides in vivo. One explanation is that the alternative lower ligands may prevent the enzyme from binding the cobamide. The structure of the methionine synthase domain that binds Cbl has been solved (33Drennan C.L. Huang S. Drummond J.T. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1660-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The structure indicates that Me2Bza and the nucleotide loop swing away from the corrin ring and are bound by the enzyme in a pocket. To achieve this conformation, the coordination bond between Me2Bza and cobalt is replaced by a coordination bond between a histidine residue (His759) of the enzyme and cobalt. Perhaps the lower ligands of the alternative cobamides generated in our experiments did not fit into the binding pocket or were locked into a base-on conformation. If the inability to bind was the reason for the lack of activity, we would predict that ethanolamine ammonia-lyase and 1,2-propanediol dehydratase bind cobamides differently than methionine synthase. The structure of the Cbl binding domains of ethanolamine ammonia-lyase and 1,2-propanediol dehydratase have not been determined to date. However, our results suggest that methionine synthase can use alternative cobamides that contain lower ligands structurally similar to Me2Bza, since the products of the Bza and Me2Pda reactions resulted in the in vivosynthesis of cobamides utilized by this enzyme. We cannot rule out that Me2Pda may have been converted to Me2Bzain vivo. However, in the case of Bza, we know that S. typhimurium synthesizes a physiologically active cobamide with Bza as the lower ligand when supplied with exogenous Bza (1Johnson M.G. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13302-13305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), supporting the argument that benzimidazolyl-cobamide was generated in this assay. This suggests that methionine synthase is able to utilize cobamide containing Bza as the lower ligand. The ability of methionine synthase to utilize alternative cobamides is further supported by Eberhard et al. (34Eberhard G. Schlayer H. Joseph H. Fridrich E. Utz B. Muller O. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1988; 369: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) who showed that a variety of cobamides containing different lower ligands supported growth of an Escherichia coli strain that required active cobamide for methionine synthase activity. However, in contrast to our results, they also saw growth with imidazolyl-cobamide. It has been reported previously that some prokaryotes when supplied with exogenous complete cobamides can replace the alternative lower ligands with their natural base (8Stupperich E. Steiner I. Eisinger H.J. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3076-3081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Friedmann H.C. Cagen L.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1970; 24: 159-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Perhaps this explains the in vivoactivity observed for imidazolyl-cobamide. Mervyn and Smith (7Mervyn L. Smith E. Prog. Indust. Microbiol. 1964; 5: 152-201Google Scholar) also list examples of cobamides besides Cbl which support in vivomethionine synthase activity. Identification of Me2Bza biosynthetic genes and isolation of their products have been elusive. The only Me2Bza auxotrophs isolated in S. typhimurium carry mutations incobT. We have proposed previously that cobTmutants are Me2Bza auxotrophs because a protein referred to as CobB substitutes for CobT activity when endogenous Me2Bza levels are increased (12Trzebiatowski J.R. O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3568-3575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2A. Tsang, unpublished results. Although we have not ruled out that CobT may in addition to its phosphoribosyltransferase activity be involved in Me2Bza biosynthesis, we predict that CobT is not solely responsible as suggested elsewhere (35Chen P. Ailion M. Weyand N. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1461-1469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are a number of reasons that may explain the difficulty with isolating mutations in Me2Bza biosynthetic genes: (i) null alleles of Me2Bza biosynthetic genes may be lethal or (ii) more than one Me2Bza biosynthetic pathway could exist in S. typhimurium. Alternatively, based on the results presented herein, it is possible that in vivo more than one base can substitute for Me2Bza. Therefore Me2Bza auxotrophy would not be observed unless the synthesis of all potential lower ligands was eliminated. We thank R. Randall from the Mass Spectrometry Laboratory of the Biochemistry Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for obtaining the mass spectra."
https://openalex.org/W1978955797,"ATP hydrolysis (by RecA protein) fundamentally alters the properties of RecA protein-mediated DNA strand exchange reactions. ATP hydrolysis renders DNA strand exchange unidirectional, greatly increases the lengths of hybrid DNA created, permits the bypass of heterologous DNA insertions in one or both DNA substrates, and is absolutely required for exchange reactions involving four DNA strands. There are at least two viable models to explain how ATP hydrolysis is coupled to DNA strand exchange so as to bring about these effects. The first couples ATP hydrolysis to a redistribution of RecA monomers within a RecA filament. The second couples ATP hydrolysis to a facilitated rotation of the DNA substrates. The RecA monomer redistribution model makes the prediction that heterology bypass should not occur if the single-stranded DNA substrate is linear. The facilitated DNA rotation model predicts that RecA protein should promote the separation of paired DNA strands within a RecA filament if one of them is contiguous with a length of DNA being rotated about the filament exterior. Here, a facile bypass of heterologous insertions with linear DNA substrates is demonstrated, providing evidence against a role for RecA monomer redistribution in heterology bypass. In addition, we demonstrate that following a four-strand DNA exchange reaction, a distal segment of DNA hundreds of base pairs in length can be unwound in a nonreciprocal phase of the reaction, consistent with the direct coupling of an ATP hydrolytic motor to the proposed DNA rotation."
https://openalex.org/W2093481522,"Tom20 is part of a multiple component, dynamic complex that functions to import specific cytosolic proteins into or through the outer membrane of the mitochondrion. To analyze the contribution of Tom20 to precursor protein recognition, the cytosolic domain of the human mitochondrial import receptor, hTom20, has been expressed as a fusion protein with glutathioneS-transferase and conditions established to measure specific interactions of the receptor component with precursor proteinsin vitro. Reconstitution of receptor binding from purified components revealed that a prototypic matrix-destined precursor protein, pODHFR, interacts with Tom20 by a mechanism that is dependent on an active matrix targeting signal but does not require cytosolic components or ATP. Binding was influenced by both salt concentration and detergent. The effect of salt or detergent, however, varied for different precursor proteins. In particular, detergent selectively enhanced binding of pODHFR to receptor, possibly because of induced changes in the structure of the signal sequence. Finally, mutations were introduced into hTom20 which had a dramatic effect on binding of some precursor proteins but not on others. Taken together, the results suggest that hTom20 recognizes and physically interacts with precursor proteins bearing a diverse array of topogenic sequences and that such pleiotropic specificity for these precursor proteins may involve different domains within the receptor molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2010091380,"A compound, SCH 28080 (2-methyl-8-(phenylmethoxy)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-acetonitrile), reversibly inhibits gastric and renal ouabain-insensitive H+,K+-ATPase, but not colonic ouabain-sensitive H+,K+-ATPase. By using the functional expression system and site-directed mutagenesis, we analyzed the putative binding sites of SCH 28080 in gastric H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit. It was previously reported that the binding site of SCH 28080, which is a K+-site inhibitor specific for gastric H+,K+-ATPase, was in the first extracellular loop between the first and second transmembrane segments of the α-subunit; Phe-126 and Asp-138 were putative binding sites. However, we found that all the mutants in the first extracellular loop including Phe-126 and Asp-138 retained H+,K+-ATPase activity and sensitivity to SCH 28080. Therefore, amino acid residues in the first extracellular loop are not directly involved in the SCH 28080 binding nor indispensable for the H+,K+-ATPase activity. Here we propose a candidate residue that is important for the binding with SCH 28080, Glu-822 in the sixth transmembrane segment. Mutations of Glu-822 to Asp and Ala (mutants termed E822D and E822A, respectively) decreased the ATPase activity to about 45% and 35% of the wild-type enzyme, respectively, while the mutations to Gln and Leu abolished the activity. Mutant E822A showed a significantly lower affinity for K+ than the wild-type enzyme, indicating that Glu-822 is involved in determining the affinity for K+. The sensitivity of mutant E822D to SCH 28080 was 8 times lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. The counterpart of Glu-822 in gastric H+,K+-ATPase is Asp in Na+,K+-ATPase and other colonic ouabain-sensitive H+,K+-ATPase, which are insensitive to SCH 28080. These results suggest that Glu-822 is one of important sites that bind with SCH 28080. A compound, SCH 28080 (2-methyl-8-(phenylmethoxy)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-acetonitrile), reversibly inhibits gastric and renal ouabain-insensitive H+,K+-ATPase, but not colonic ouabain-sensitive H+,K+-ATPase.

These results suggest that Glu-822 is one of important sites that bind with SCH 28080. H+,K+-ATPase is the proton pump responsible for gastric acid secretion (1Wallmark B. Larsson H. Humble L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13681-13684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is the target molecule for irreversible proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole (2Morii M. Takata H. Takeguchi N. Gastroenterology. 1989; 96: 1453-1461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), rabeprazole (E3810) (3Morii M. Hamatani K. Takeguchi N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 1729-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and SCH 28080 1The abbreviations used are: SCH 28080, 2-methyl-8-(phenylmethoxy)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-acetonitrile; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. 1The abbreviations used are: SCH 28080, 2-methyl-8-(phenylmethoxy)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-acetonitrile; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.(4Scott C.K. Sundell E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1985; 112: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). SCH 28080 is a reversible inhibitor of gastric H+,K+-ATPase, which competitively binds to the luminal K+ high affinity site of the enzyme (5Keeling D.J. Taylor A.G. Schudt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5545-5551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This inhibitor does not inhibit Na+,K+-ATPase, therefore, discriminating the K+ site of H+,K+-ATPase from that of Na+,K+-ATPase. Furthermore, SCH 28080 inhibits renal ouabain-insensitive H+,K+-ATPase (6Cheval L. Barlet-Bas C. Khadouri C. Feraille E. Marsy S. Doucet A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: F800-F805PubMed Google Scholar), but not colonic ouabain-sensitive H+,K+-ATPase (7Takeguchi M. Asano S. Tabuchi Y. Takeguchi N. Gastroenterology. 1990; 99: 1339-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,8Cougnon M. Planelles G. Crowson M.S. Shull G.E. Rossier B.C. Jaisser F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7277-7280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The binding site of SCH 28080 in the gastric H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit was reported to be in the first extracellular loop between the M1 and M2 transmembrane segments from the study in which a photo-affinity derivative of this inhibitor was used (9Munson K.B. Gutierrez C. Balaji V.N. Ramnarayan K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18976-18988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Phe-126 and Asp-138 (in the rabbit α-subunit) were proposed to be involved in the interaction with the derivative of SCH 28080 based on a computer-generated model (9Munson K.B. Gutierrez C. Balaji V.N. Ramnarayan K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18976-18988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The corresponding loop between M1 and M2 transmembrane segments of Na+,K+-ATPase is known to be important for determining ouabain sensitivity (10Price E.M. Lingrel J.B Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8400-8408Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Here we mutated amino acid residues in the first extracellular loop including Phe-126 and Asp-138, studied the sensitivity of the mutant H+,K+-ATPase to the inhibitor, and found that all mutants studied here retained H+,K+-ATPase activity and sensitivity to SCH 28080, suggesting that this loop is not directly involved in SCH 28080 binding. Several acidic and polar amino acid residues in the M5 and M6 transmembrane segments of Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit and sarcoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase are involved in the interaction with cations and are important for these ATPase activities (11Argüello J.M.

Here we mutated one of the acidic amino acids in the M6 transmembrane segment of rabbit H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit, Glu-822, and studied the properties of the mutants. When this residue was mutated to aspartic acid and alanine, the mutants E822D and E822A partially retained the ATPase activity. E822A mutant showed significantly lower affinity for K+ and higher affinity for ATP. E822D mutant showed significantly lower sensitivity to SCH 28080, although the affinities for K+ and ATP were unchanged. We propose the possibility that Glu-822 is involved in determining the affinity for K+ and the binding with SCH 28080. HEK-293 cells (human embryonic kidney cell line) were a kind gift from Dr. Jonathan Lytton (Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). pcDNA3 vector was obtained from Invitrogen Co. (San Diego, CA). MutanK kit was from Takara Shuzo Co. (Ohtsu, Japan). Vent DNA polymerase was obtained from New England Biolabs. Restriction enzymes and other DNA and RNA modifying enzymes were from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan), New England Biolabs, Life Technologies, Inc., or Pharmacia Biotech Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). SCH 28080 was obtained from Schering Co. (Bloomfield, NJ). All other reagents were of molecular biology grade or the highest grade of purity available. cDNAs of the α- and β-subunits of H+,K+-ATPase were prepared from rabbit gastric mucosae as described elsewhere (19Asano S. Tega Y. Konishi K. Fujioka M. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2740-2745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The α- and β-subunit cDNAs were digested with EcoRI and XhoI. The obtained fragments were each ligated into pcDNA3 vector treated withEcoRI and XhoI. DNA sequencing was done by the dideoxy chain termination method using an Autoread DNA sequencing kit and an ALF-II DNA sequencer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Introduction of site-directed mutations in the M1-M2 domain of the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit was carried out by sequential polymerase chain reaction (PCR) steps (20Cormack B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, 1991: 8.5.1-8.5.9Google Scholar), in which appropriately mutated α-subunit cDNAs (segments betweenEcoRI site (nucleotide −28) and BstEII site (nucleotide 456)) were prepared. Two kinds of flanking sequence primers were prepared, one is the 5′-flanking sense primer, 5′-CCGAATTCAAGGAGGGCAGCGCAGCGAG-3′ (nucleotide −28 to −9,EcoRI site is underlined), and the other is the 3′-flanking antisense primer, 5′-GCCTCGAGCTCGGATCACCGTGGCTTGC-3′ (nucleotides 534–553, XhoI site is underlined). In addition, sense and antisense synthetic oligonucleotides, each 21 bases long containing one or two mutated bases near the center, were designed (referred as the sense mutating primer and the antisense mutating primer). In the first PCR amplification step, the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit cDNA subcloned in pBluescript SK(−) (19Asano S. Tega Y. Konishi K. Fujioka M. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2740-2745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was used as a DNA template. Two fragments were prepared in this step: one between the 5′-flanking sense primer and the antisense mutating primer, and the other between the sense mutating primer and the 3′-flanking antisense primer. Each amplified fragment was purified by gel electrophoresis, combined and incubated with the 5′-flanking sense primer and the 3′-flanking antisense primer in the second PCR amplification. The amplified fragment was purified by gel electrophoresis, subcloned in pBluescript SK(−), and sequenced. PCR was routinely carried out in the presence of 300 μm each dNTP, 6 μm primers, 10 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 2 mmMgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 units of Vent DNA polymerase for 25 cycles. After sequencing, the amplified fragment in the second PCR was digested withEcoRI and BstEII, and ligated back into the relevant position of the wild-type construct of the α-subunit. Site-directed mutagenesis in Glu-822 was carried out as described elsewhere by using the MutanK kit (19Asano S. Tega Y. Konishi K. Fujioka M. Takeguchi N. J. Biol.

A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar). Cell culture of HEK-293 was carried out as described previously (19Asano S. Tega Y. Konishi K. Fujioka M. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2740-2745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). α- and β-subunit cDNA transfection was performed by the calcium phosphate method with 10 μg of cesium chloride-purified DNA/10-cm dish. Cells were harvested 2 days after the DNA transfection. Membrane fractions of HEK cells were prepared as described previously (19Asano S. Tega Y. Konishi K. Fujioka M. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2740-2745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells in a 10-cm Petri dish were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in 2 ml of low ionic salt buffer (0.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4) at 0 °C for 10 min. After the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) and aprotinin (0.09 units/ml) the cells were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer, and the homogenate was diluted with an equal volume of a solution containing 500 mm sucrose and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The homogenized suspension was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 90 min, and the pellet was suspended in a solution containing 250 mm sucrose and 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out as described elsewhere (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Membrane preparations (30 μg protein) were incubated in a sample buffer containing 2% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, at room temperature for 2 min and applied to the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Immunoblot was carried out as described previously (19Asano S. Tega Y. Konishi K. Fujioka M. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2740-2745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Ab1024 was previously raised against the carboxyl-terminal peptide (residues 1024–1034) of the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (PGSWWDQELYY) (23Asano S. Arakawa S. Hirasawa M. Sakai H. Ohta M. Ohta K. Takeguchi N. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). H+,K+-ATPase activity was assayed by following two different methods depending on the purpose and conditions of the experiments. H+,K+-ATPase activity was measured in 1.2 ml of a reaction mixture containing 50 μg of membrane protein, 3 mm MgCl2, 160 μm NADH, 0.8 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 3 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 2.75 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 5 mm NaN3, 1 mm ouabain, 15 mm KCl, 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, and various concentrations of ATP. The decrease in the amount of NADH was measured at 37 °C from the absorbance at 340 nm by a Beckman spectrophotometer as described elsewhere (24Morii M. Hayata Y. Mizoguchi K. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4068-4072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The SCH 28080-sensitive K+-ATPase was calculated as the difference between the K+-ATPase activities in the presence and absence of 50 μm SCH 28080. H+,K+-ATPase activity was measured in 1 ml of a solution containing 50 μg of membrane protein, 3 mm MgCl2, 3 mm ATP, 5 mm NaN3, 2 mm ouabain, and 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, in the presence and absence of 15 mm KCl. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the inorganic phosphate released was measured as described elsewhere (25Yoda A. Hokin L.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 40: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The K+-ATPase activity was calculated as the difference between activities in the presence and absence of KCl. These two methods did not give qualitative differences in results, but values measured by the former method were about 20% higher than corresponding values measured by the latter method. Routinely we measured the ATPase activity by both methods. We usually showed results measured by the latter method unless indicated. When the ATPase activity was measured as a function of ATP concentrations, the former method was employed to maintain constant ATP concentrations during the incubation period. Protein was measured using the BCA protein assay kit from Pierce with bovine serum albumin as a standard. SCH 28080 is a reversible inhibitor specific for the gastric H+,K+-ATPase (4Scott C.K.

Previously, it was proposed that Phe-126 and Asp-138 were directly involved in the interaction with SCH 28080 (9Munson K.B. Gutierrez C. Balaji V.N. Ramnarayan K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18976-18988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we mutated these two residues into several different amino acids (F126A, F126L, F126Y, D138A, D138E, D138N, D138V and double mutants F126A/D138A and F126Y/D138N) and studied the effects on the expression levels and the ATPase activity. The expression levels of the mutant α-subunits were almost identical with that of the wild-type judging from the immunoblot pattern (Fig.1). Table I shows the K+-ATPase activities of the mutants and the wild-type enzyme in the absence of SCH 28080, and the inhibition percentage in the presence of 10 and 50 μm SCH 28080. Significant K+-ATPase activity was detected in all these mutants prepared here, although there were significant differences in the activities between the wild-type enzyme and some mutants such as F126L and F126A, i.e. F126L and F126A mutants showed about 40% and 61% of the activity of the wild-type enzyme, respectively. SCH 28080 at 10 and 50 μm inhibited the K+-ATPase activities of these mutants by 74–98% and by 77–100%, respectively. Fig. 2 shows the effects of various concentrations of SCH 28080 on the K+-ATPase activity for several mutants. IC50 values are 2.1, 2.0, 3.3, 1.6, and 3.8 μm for wild-type and mutants F126Y, F126L, D138E, and D138N, respectively. These results (Table I and Fig. 2) show that the affinities of the mutants for SCH 28080 were not significantly different from that of the wild-type enzyme, indicating that Phe-126 and Asp-138 are not directly involved in the binding with SCH 28080.Table IK + -ATPase activity of the mutants and the inhibition percentage of the K + -ATPase activity in the presence of 10 and 50 μm SCH 28080K+-ATPase activityInhibition percentage10 μm SCH50 μm SCHμmol/mg/hWild-type1.19 ± 0.02 (n = 5)80100F126A0.72 ± 0.04 (n = 4)98100F126L0.48 ± 0.05 (n = 5)8084F126Y0.91 ± 0.07 (n = 3)7477D138A0.79 ± 0.04 (n = 6)7594D138E0.82 ± 0.05 (n = 5)8283D138N0.94 ± 0.07 (n = 6)7879D138V0.89 ± 0.05 (n = 8)8590F126A/D138A0.76 ± 0.07 (n = 3)7685F126Y/D138N0.83 ± 0.05 (n = 4)8195E132A0.96 ± 0.08 (n = 5)7093G133A0.80 ± 0.03 (n = 6)62100G133E0.81 ± 0.08 (n = 5)7788D134A0.61 ± 0.06 (n = 4)5683L135A0.65 ± 0.06 (n = 3)8595T136A1.27 ± 0.03 (n = 3)7494T137A1.18 ± 0.06 (n = 4)7897 Open table in a new tab Figure 2Effects of SCH 28080 concentrations on the expressed K+-ATPase activities of the Phe-126 and Asp-138 mutants.

The K+ sensitivity of the mutants at Phe-126 (F126A and F126Y) was not significantly different from that of the wild-type enzyme. K m values for K+ obtained from the least-squares curve fitting in the range of the low K+ concentrations were 0.23 mmfor mutant F126A and 0.14 mm for mutant F126Y, which were comparable with the values obtained for the wild-type H+,K+-ATPase expressed in HEK-293 cells (K m = 0.24 mm) (19Asano S.

( Tokyo ). 1988; 103: 672-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mutations at Asp-138 (D138A and D138N) slightly decreased the affinity for K+. K m values were 0.94 mm for mutant D138A and 0.48 mm for mutant D138N, which were 2–4-fold higher than that of the wild-type enzyme. Amino acid sequences in the M1 and M2 transmembrane segments are considerably well conserved between members of H+,K+-ATPase family (gastric, colonic, and urinary bladder) and Na+,K+-ATPase, whereas amino acids in the loop segment between M1 and M2 are not conserved (28Bamberg K. Mercier F. Reuben M.A. Kobayashi Y. Munson K.B. Sachs G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1131: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Crowson M.S. Shull G.E. J. Biol.

Here we prepared mutants E132A, G133A, G133E, D134A, L135A, T136A, and T137A. K+-ATPase activity was detected in all these mutants prepared, and the activities of mutants D134A and L135A were significantly lower than that of the wild-type as shown in Table I. SCH 28080 at 10 and 50 μminhibited the K+-ATPase activity of these mutants by 56–85% and 83–100%, respectively. The sensitivity of mutant D134A to SCH 28080 was slightly lower than that of the wild-type enzyme; however, the sensitivity of this mutant was still much higher than those of Na+,K+-ATPase and ouabain-sensitive colonic H+,K+-ATPases. Therefore, we conclude that the first extracellular loop between the M1 and M2 segments is not an exclusive (or major) determinant of SCH 28080 sensitivity nor directly involved in the binding with SCH 28080. In the following, we propose that Glu-822 in the M6 transmembrane segment is one of the candidates involved in the binding with SCH 28080. Several amino acid residues responsible for the cation binding or indispensable for the enzyme activity are present in the M5 and M6 transmembrane segments of the Ca2+-ATPase and the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (11Argüello J.M.

We mutated Glu-822 in the M6 transmembrane segment of the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit, and studied the role of this amino acid in the ATPase function. In sarcoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase, the corresponding amino acid is Asn-796, which is involved in the high affinity binding with Ca2+ (17Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The counterpart in rat Na+,K+-ATPase α2-subunit, Asp-803, is indispensable for the function, and mutations of this residue to Asn, Glu, or Leu abolished the function of the Na+,K+-ATPase (12Jewell-Motz E.A. Lingrel J.B Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13523-13530Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We mutated Glu-822 of the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit into Ala, Asp, Leu, and Gln. The expression levels of the mutant α-subunits were almost identical with that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 5). Table II shows the H+,K+-ATPase activity of these mutants. When this glutamic acid was mutated to leucine (E822L) and glutamine (E822Q), the ATPase activity was abolished in both cases. However, the aspartic acid mutant (E822D) and, surprisingly, the alanine mutant (E822A) expressed in the present HEK cells retained about 45% and 35% of the activity of the wild-type enzyme, respectively. These results show that this residue is important for the ATPase function, but the carboxyl residue of the side chain is not indispensable. Fig. 6 shows the effects of K+ on the ATPase activity of the mutants. The affinity of mutant E822D for K+ was not significantly different from that of the wild-type enzyme, whereas mutant E822A showed a significantly lower affinity for K+. K m values were 0.24, 0.32, and 5.5 mm for wild-type, E822D and E822A mutants, respectively. Therefore, Glu-822 is involved in determining the affinity for K+ in the H+,K+-ATPase. Fig. 7 shows the effects of ATP on the ATPase activity of the mutants. The affinity of mutant E822D for ATP was not significantly different from that of the wild-type enzyme, whereas mutant E822A showed a significantly higher affinity for ATP. Therefore, the conformation of mutant E822A with a lower affinity for K+ and higher affinity for ATP is considered to be shifted to an E1 form compared with that of the wild-type enzyme.Table IIH +, K + -ATPase activity of the Glu-822 mutantsH+,K+-ATPase activityμmol/mg/hWild-type0.76 ± 0.05 (n = 10)E822A0.23 ± 0.05 (n = 6)E822D0.31 ± 0.05 (n = 4)E822L−0.13 ± 0.04 (n = 5)E822O0.02 ± 0.01 (n = 4) Open table in a new tab Figure 6Effects of K+ concentrations on the expressed H+,K+-ATPase activity of the Glu-822 mutants.

Mutant E822D showed a significantly lower sensitivity to SCH 28080 than the wild-type, whereas E822A showed a significantly higher affinity. IC50 values are 2.1, 15, and 0.58 μm for the wild-type, mutants E822D and E822A, respectively (i.e. these mutations did not induce parallel changes in affinities for K+ and SCH 28080). Taking the molecular shape and size difference between K+ and SCH 28080 into consideration, it is considered that these mutations induced some conformational changes, resulting in complicated changes in the affinities. Therefore, Glu-822 is suggested to be involved in bindings with K+ and SCH 28080. H+,K+-ATPase was originally found in gastric mucosae. Recently new members of the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit were found and cloned from distal colons of rat (29Crowson M.S. Shull G.E. J. Biol.

The ouabain-sensitive K+-ATPase activity in the membrane preparation from the guinea pig colon was insensitive to 100 μm SCH 28080 (7Takeguchi M. Asano S. Tabuchi Y. Takeguchi N.

When the α- and β-subunit cRNAs were co-injected (for colonic H+,K+-ATPase and ATP1AL1, these α-subunit cRNAs were co-injected with the β-subunit cRNA of rabbit gastric H+,K+-ATPase), the expressed ATPases transported rubidium inward, and proton outward. The K+-ATPase activities of urinary bladder ATPase and ATP1AL1 were sensitive to both SCH 28080 and ouabain (30Jaisser F. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. Rossier B.C. J. Cell. Biol. 1993; 123: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 33Modyanov N.N. Mathews P.M. Grishin A.V. Beguin P. Beggah A.T. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. Am. J.

However, they were much less sensitive to SCH 28080 than the gastric H+,K+-ATPase, the K i value of the urinary bladder H+,K+-ATPase being 230 μm (30Jaisser F. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. Rossier B.C. J. Cell. Biol. 1993; 123: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The Rb+ transport by ATP1AL1 was only partly inhibited by 500 μm SCH 28080 (33Modyanov N.N. Mathews P.M. Grishin A.V. Beguin P. Beggah A.T. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C992-C997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rat colonic H+,K+-ATPase expressed inXenopus oocytes was sensitive to ouabain, but insensitive to SCH 28080 (8Cougnon M. Planelles G. Crowson M.S. Shull G.E. Rossier B.C. Jaisser F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7277-7280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), while the same ATPase expressed in Sf9 cells was slightly inhibited by SCH 28080 (18% inhibition with 100 μm SCH 28080) and was insensitive to ouabain (34Lee J. Rajendran V.M. Mann A.S. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2002-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences around the first extracellular loop are well conserved in gastric H+,K+-ATPases obtained from various species, i.e. rat (35Shull G.E. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16788-16791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), pig (36Maeda M. Ishizaki J. Futai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Acta. 1992; 1131: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), dog (38Song I Mortell M.P. Gantz I. Brown D.R. Yamada T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Physiol. 1995; 268: C1207-C1214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Fig. 4, amino acid sequences around the first extracellular loop segment of the α-subunit are compared in the members of H+,K+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase. The amino acid at the edge of the M1 transmembrane segment is phenylalanine (Phe-126 in rabbit gastric H+,K+-ATPase) and conserved in these gastric H+,K+-ATPases and rat colonic H+,K+-ATPase (29Crowson M.S. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13740-13748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the corresponding residue is tyrosine in the guinea pig colonic H+,K+-ATPase, urinary bladder H+,K+-ATPase (30Jaisser F. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. Rossier B.C. J. Cell. Biol. 1993; 123: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and sheep kidney Na+,K+-ATPase (31Shull G.E. Schwartz A. Lingrel J.B Nature. 1985; 316: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), which are all insensitive to SCH 28080. Therefore, we initially considered that mutation at Phe-126 in the gastric H+,K+-ATPases would cause some change in the sensitivity to SCH 28080, if SCH 28080 binds with this loop as suggested previously (9Munson K.B. Gutierrez C. Balaji V.N. Ramnarayan K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18976-18988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, when the residue was replaced by tyrosine (F126Y) or alanine (F126A), the K+-ATPase activity of the mutants still remained sensitive to SCH 28080, and the sensitivity of these mutants to SCH 28080 was not significantly different from that of the wild-type enzyme. Because mutants F126A and F126Y are able to interact with SCH 28080, the phenyl group in the side chain of Phe-126 is not supposed to be directly involved in the interaction with the inhibitor, and the side chain of the tyrosine residue does not interrupt the binding of SCH 28080. Therefore, the low sensitivity to SCH 28080 in the guinea pig colonic H+,K+-ATPase and the urinary bladder H+,K+-ATPase is not due to the amino acid substitution to Tyr on this site (7Takeguchi M. Asano S. Tabuchi Y. Takeguchi N. Gastroenterology. 1990; 99: 1339-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 30Jaisser F. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. Rossier B.C. J. Cell. Biol. 1993; 123: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The aspartic acid residue (Asp-138 in rabbit gastric H+,K+-ATPase) at the edge of the M2 transmembrane segment is also well conserved in gastric H+,K+-ATPases from different species, but divergent among Na+,K+-ATPase and colonic and urinary H+,K+-ATPases. In the Na+,K+-ATPase, the corresponding amino acid residue is asparagine. In the colonic and urinary bladder H+,K+-ATPases this residue is leucine and arginine, respectively. When this residue of gastric H+,K+-ATPase was replaced by asparagine (D138N), alanine (D138A), glutamic acid (D138E), and valine (D138V), the K+-ATPase activity remained sensitive to SCH 28080, and the sensitivity of the mutants to SCH 28080 was not significantly different from that of the wild-type enzyme. Therefore, Asp-138 is not directly involved in the interaction with SCH 28080. To exclude the possibility that the interaction between H+,K+-ATPase and SCH 28080 remains unaffected when only one of the two binding determinants (Phe-126 and Asp-138) is mutated, we prepared double mutants in Phe-126 and Asp-138 (F126Y/D138N and F126A/D138A). These double mutants are also active and have similar sensitivity to SCH 28080 compared with the wild-type enzyme. Our results altogether suggest that the putative SCH 28080 binding sites, Phe-126 and Asp-138, are, at least, not major determinants of SCH 28080 sensitivity nor directly involved in binding with SCH 28080. Next we introduced mutations in other residues in the first extracellular loop segment. Amino acid residues between Glu-132 and Thr-137 were replaced with alanine to study the role of the side chain in binding with SCH 28080 (mutants termed E132A, G133A, D134A, L135A, T136A, and T137A). In addition, Gly-133 was replaced with glutamic acid, a counterpart residue in sheep kidney Na+,K+-ATPase (mutant termed G133E). All these mutants prepared were active as H+,K+-ATPase, suggesting that the side chains of amino acids in this segment are not indispensable for the ATPase function. Sensitivity of the mutants to SCH 28080 was not significantly different from that of the wild-type enzyme. Therefore, it is concluded that every single amino acid residue in the first extracellular loop is not a major binding site of SCH 28080. We found that Glu-822 is one of the amino acids that determine the affinity for SCH 28080. When Glu-822 was mutated with Gln and Leu, H+,K+-ATPase activity of the mutants was completely abolished. For Ala and Asp mutants, H+,K+-ATPase activity was partially preserved. The affinities of mutant E822D for K+ and ATP were not changed; however, those of mutant E822A were significantly lower for K+ and higher for ATP than the corresponding affinities of the wild-type enzyme. These results suggest that this site is important for the function of H+,K+-ATPase, especially for determining the affinity for K+, but that the carboxyl moiety of Glu-822 is not indispensable for the ATPase function. Very recently Swarts et al. (40Swarts H.G.P. Klaassen C.H.W. De Boer M. Fransen J.A.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29764-29772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) reported that Glu-820 of rat gastric H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (counterpart of Glu-822 of rabbit gastric H+,K+-ATPase) is involved in K+ binding, and that E820Q mutant expressed in Sf9 cells showed no K+-ATPase activity, which is in good agreement with our findings. The corresponding residues in rabbit sarcoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase and rat Na+,K+-ATPase α2 subunit are Asn-796 and Asp-803, respectively. Asn-796 in the Ca2+-ATPase is involved in the high-affinity binding with Ca2+ (17Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Asp-803 in Na+,K+-ATPase is indispensable for the ATPase function and unchangeable (12Jewell-Motz E.A. Lingrel J.B Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13523-13530Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Therefore, the roles of Glu-822 and the corresponding amino acid residues in the ATPase function are different among H+,K+-ATPase, Ca2+-ATPase, and Na+,K+-ATPase. Mutant E822D showed 8 times lower sensitivity to SCH 28080, whereas the E822A showed a higher sensitivity than the wild-type enzyme. These results suggest that Glu-822 is the site involved (directly or indirectly) in binding with SCH 28080. It is noteworthy that the corresponding amino acid residue of Glu-822 is an aspartic acid in Na+,K+-ATPases and non-gastric type H+,K+-ATPases that are insensitive to SCH 28080 (28Bamberg K.

Furthermore, the sensitivity of mutant E822D to SCH 28080 is lower than that of any mutant in the first extracellular loop segment, but still higher than those of Na+,K+-ATPase and non-gastric H+,K+-ATPases. Our present results do not exclude the possibility that the binding sites of SCH 28080 are on the multiple domains in the H+,K+-ATPase. In fact, amino acid residues that are involved in determining the affinity for ouabain (or cardiac glycosides) in Na+,K+-ATPase are on the segments between M1 and M2 (10Price E.M.

The localization of the muscle isoenzyme of CK (MM-CK) to the M line and the sarcoplasmic reticulum of myofibrils has been suggested to be important for proper force development in skeletal muscle. The importance of this subcellular compartmentation has not been directly tested in vivo. To test the role of myofibrilar localization of CK, the consequences of a complete CK isoform switch from MM-CK to the brain (BB-CK) isoform, which does not localize to the M line, was studied in transgenic mouse skeletal muscle. In MM-CK knockout mice there are large contractile defects. When MM-CK was replaced by BB-CK, the aberrant contractile phenotypes seen in MM-CK knockout mice were returned to normal despite the lack of myofibrillar localization. These results indicate that CK compartmentation to the myofibril of skeletal muscle is not essential for contractile function and that there is functional equivalence of creatine kinase isoforms in supporting cellular energy metabolism.

There are a growing number of examples of subcellular compartmentation of metabolic enzymes. Many of the enzymes of glycolysis in addition to being in the cytosol localize to subcellular structures such as the outer membrane of mitochondria, actin, the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and the plasma membrane (1Lynch R.M.

The enzymes involved in nucleotide synthesis are organized to allow efficient channeling of substrates (4Zeleznikar R.J. Heyman R.A. Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Dawis S.M. Butz E.A. Goldberg N.D. J.

Some tRNA synthetases associate into high molecular weight complexes, and evidence indicates that tRNAs are channeled (7Dang C.V. Johnson D.L. Yang D.C.H.

There is ample theoretical work that indicates that subcellular compartmentation of enzymes affords advantages for metabolic control and a large amount of in vitro and in vivoevidence exists indicating that subcellular compartmentation alters enzymatic activity and substrate utilization (10Acerenza L.

Despite all this work, no consensus has developed concerning whether or not subcellular compartmentation is important for maintaining mammalian cell and tissue function in vivo. Creatine kinase (CK) 1The abbreviations used are: CK, creatine kinase; PCr, phosphocreatine; MM-CK, muscle isoenzyme of CK; BB-CK, brain isoform of CK; B-CK, B subunit of CK; M-CK, M subunit of CK; M-CK KO, mice that lack M-CK subunits due to gene disruption. is central to cellular energy metabolism and is one of the best studied examples of an enzyme that exhibits subcellular compartmentation (13Gellerich F.

Brdiczka D. Nicolay K. Eppenberger H.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 21-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar). CK catalyzes the following reaction: phosphocreatine (PCr) + ADP + H+ = creatine + ATP. CK exists in several isoforms that differ in their developmental and tissue patterns of expression and subcellular localization (16Wallimann T. Wyss M. Brdiczka D. Nicolay K. Eppenberger H.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 21-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar). The CK catalyzed reaction plays an important role in maintaining ATP levels and modulating intracellular pH during periods when utilization of ATP exceeds production by glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation. In addition, PCr represents a significant store of inorganic phosphate. The muscle isoenzyme of CK (MM-CK) is abundant in the cytoplasm and associated tightly with the M line of myofibrils and the outer face of the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane, and in avian skeletal muscle, it is associated with the I-band (17Turner D.C.

The brain isoform of CK (BB-CK) is also found in the cytoplasm and has been shown to localize to plasma membranes in the vicinity of the Na-K ATPase and mitotic spindles (28Cande W.Z.

MM-CK and BB-CK are dimers formed from subunits that can also associate to form a muscle-brain (MB) heterodimer that is found in heart. In addition to the cytosolic forms, there are two mitochondrial forms of CK, sarcomeric and ubiquitous mitochondrial CK, which localize to the intermitochondrial membrane space and have been implicated in affecting regulation of oxidative phosphorylation (13Gellerich F.

The localization of CK to sites of ATP production and utilization has led to the proposal that CK plays a role in spatial buffering of ATP, ADP, and pH that is important for proper tissue function and in particular, maintaining contractile function in muscle and heart (13Gellerich F.

These results clearly demonstrate the important role of CK in normal muscle function but do not specifically address whether the CK isoform expression that is localized to myofibrils plays an important role in contractile function. Previously, a mouse expressing the B subunit of CK (B-CK) in skeletal muscle in addition to wild-type M subunits (M-CK) has been described (37Brosnan M.J. Raman S.P. Chen L. Koretsky A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C151-C160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Roman B.B. Foley J.M. Meyer R.A. Koretsky A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1236-C1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mice show normal contractile activity with no evidence of adaptation. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that BB-CK does not localize to myofibrils. The availability of the mice expressing B-CK subunits and mice that lack M-CK subunits due to gene disruption (M-CK KO) enabled generation of a mouse with skeletal muscle containing a complete isoenzyme switch from MM-CK to BB-CK. Thus, a direct test of whether specific localization of CK to myofibrils is essential for proper function of muscle was performed. All animals were bred and maintained in groups of four in a temperature-controlled (25 °C) room. Agway rat chow (Rat-mouse-hamster 3000, Agway Co.) and water were provided ad libitum. All animals used were male and 8–16 weeks of age. Animals were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg intraperitoneally), and the initial anesthetic dose lasted for the duration of the experiments. All protocols involving animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Production of transgenic mice that express the B subunit of CK in skeletal muscle (7001 line) was described previously (37Brosnan M.J. Raman S.P. Chen L. Koretsky A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C151-C160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Roman B.B. Foley J.M. Meyer R.A. Koretsky A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1236-C1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice heterozygous for a B-CK transgene and homozygous for M-CK KO allele were generated by mating M-CK KO mice (33van Deursen J. Heerschap A. Oerlemans F. Ruitenbeek W. Jap P. ter Laak H. Wieringa B.

Physiol. 1996; 270: C1236-C1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the offspring back-crossed to the M-CK KO. These mice were then intercrossed to create mice homozygous for the B-CK transgene and homozygous for the M-CK KO allele (referred to as switch mice). The left superficial gastrocnemius muscle was isolated for chemical extraction (for glycogen assessment the entire gastrocnemius was used). All biochemical assays and extractions were performed using standard techniques as described previously (38Roman B.B. Foley J.M. Meyer R.A. Koretsky A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1236-C1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue sections were immunoassayed using goat anti-human CK polyclonal primary antibodies (Cortex, Inc., CA) and Cy3 conjugated secondary antibody. 4-μm slices were prepared from muscles that were isolated, frozen in liquid nitrogen cooled isopentane, and mounted for cutting using TBS-tissue freezing medium (Fisher). After sectioning, the tissue was then incubated with primary antibody (1:300 dilution/10% horse serum) for 2 h at room temperature in a humid chamber. Sections were washed off with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline/10% horse serum. The secondary antibody (1:500/10% horse serum) conjugated to Cy3 was applied for 30 min at room temperature. The sections were washed and coverslips were applied. Isolated myofibrils were washed and assayed for CK as described previously (37Brosnan M.J. Raman S.P. Chen L. Koretsky A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C151-C160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The animals were anesthetized and prepared for stimulation as described previously (38Roman B.B. Foley J.M. Meyer R.A. Koretsky A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1236-C1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Muscles were stimulated via platinum electrodes attached to the sciatic nerve, and force measurements were made using a calibrated F-100 transducer (MacLab). The force records were recorded using a MacLab Data Acquisition system. Rest tension was applied to the muscle and adjusted following test twitches until an increase in force was no longer observed with constant voltage. The muscle was allowed to recover for approximately 10 min following the test contractions. Muscles were supramaximally stimulated at 5 Hz, and force was recorded for 3 min. Anesthetized animals were in a supine position within the magnet bore. 31P NMR spectra were acquired at 121.55 MHz on a Bruker Biospec 7T spectrometer. A two-turn rectangular surface coil that was approximately the size of the gastrocnemius-plantaris-soleus complex was used. The coil was tuned to the phosphorus signal and shimmed on the proton signal. Phosphorus spectra were obtained using a 90 ° flip angle (40 μs square pulse), a 4K data set, and a 15 s repetition delay. Magnetization transfer was measured using a saturation transfer pulse sequence and irradiation positioning on the γ-ATP resonance as well as a control position as described previously (37Brosnan M.J. Raman S.P. Chen L. Koretsky A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C151-C160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Saturation and control irradiation times between 0.5–14.5 s were used. Peak integration of the PCr peak was used to measure signal intensity, and the data were fit to the following exponential function:M t/M 0 = 1 −k for T 1 app (1 − exp(−t/T 1 app)), whereM t/M 0 is the PCr signal intensity during γ-ATP and control saturation,k for is the first order rate constant,t is the duration of the saturation, andT 1 app is the T1 apparent time constant. The values represented in the text, tables, and figures are the sample means ± S.D. Significance was accepted atp < 0.05 using an unpaired Student's ttest. Fig. 1 shows a CK isoform gel that demonstrates that in the switch mice the only cytosolic form of CK present is BB-CK. Control animals had a total CK activity of 7980 ± 280 μmol min−1 g wet weight−1 (n = 6), and the M-CK KO had an activity of 350 ± 80 μmol min−1 g wet weight−1 (n = 6) due to mitochondrial CK that is still present in these muscles. Switch animals had 37% control activity with 2650 ± 600 μmol min−1 g wet weight−1 (n = 6) (Table I).Table ITotal in vitro CK activity at 37 °C obtained from superficial gastrocnemius muscle homogenates from control, M-CK KO, and switch miceIn vitro activity(μmol min −1 g wet weight −1 )Control7980 ± 280M-CK KO350 ± 80Switch2650 ± 600The results are reported as means ± S.D., n = 6. Open table in a new tab The results are reported as means ± S.D., n = 6. To measure the in vivo CK activity in the different mice31P NMR saturation transfer techniques were used (Fig.2 A). The decrease in the PCr peak during varying times with saturation of the γ-ATP peak was used to measure pseudo-first order rate constants in the different mice (Fig.2 B). The amount of PCr as determined from 31P NMR was not significantly different among the different mice (data not shown), indicating that the rate constants can be used for a valid comparison of in vivo rates of CK. Pseudo-first order rate constants obtained for CK in control mice were 0.24 ± 0.02 s−1. M-CK KO mice had a significantly lower value of 0.05 ± 0.05 s−1. Switch mice had a rate constant of 0.14 ± 0.03 s−1, which was 58% of control activity. To determine if BB-CK localized to myofibrils in the switch muscle, immunofluorescence images of skeletal muscle sections stained with CK polyclonal antibodies were obtained (Fig.3 A). 4-μm tissue sections were immunoassayed, and stripes of specific staining on the sarcomeres of control muscle could be readily observed (Fig. 3 A,panel 1). The M-CK KO mice showed no specific staining of the myofibrils (Fig. 3 A, panel 2). There was also no specific sarcomeric staining in the muscle from switch mice as well, indicating that BB-CK did not specifically associate with myofibrils in the switch mice (Fig. 3 A, panel 3). To further substantiate the lack of localization of BB-CK to myofibrils, CK activity was measured by isoenzyme gel electrophoresis from isolated washed myofibrils. Myofibrils from control mice contained significant amounts of MM-CK; however, no detectable CK was obtained from washed myofibrils isolated from switch mice (Fig. 3 B). To determine if BB-CK could rescue the phenotypes previously described in M-CK KO mice, alterations in markers of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation were measured (Table II and Ref. 38Roman B.B. Foley J.M. Meyer R.A. Koretsky A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1236-C1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As compared with control, M-CK KO mice had significantly higher levels of glycogen and citrate synthase as previously reported (33van Deursen J. Heerschap A. Oerlemans F. Ruitenbeek W. Jap P. ter Laak H. Wieringa B. Cell. 1993; 74: 621-631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In addition, M-CK KO mice had significantly elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenate and adenylate kinase. In switch mice, the replacement of MM-CK with BB-CK led to a return to control levels of glycogen and lactate dehydrogenase. Citrate synthase levels were not significantly different from control in switch mice, although they tended to be intermediate between control and M-CK KO mice. The levels of adenylate kinase were elevated in the switch muscle compared with control and approximately equal to that of M-CK KO. Finally, no differences in myosin heavy chain isoforms were detected in control, M-CK KO, or switch mice (data not shown).Table IIBiochemical assays from control, M-CK KO, and switch miceControlM-CK KOSwitchGlycogen (mg/dl)38 ± 667 ± 833 ± 8Citrate synthase19 ± 2256 ± 2041 ± 20Lactate dehydrogenase450 ± 60580 ± 60420 ± 40Adenylate kinase1260 ± 1401700 ± 3502000 ± 350The activities were determined at 37 °C in μmol/min/g wet weight.

Fig. 4 illustrates examples of the mechanical records of force production from the different mice and time courses of changes in the average force generated as a function of contraction number. As previously reported, M-CK KO mice are not able to maintain force as compared with control early after initiating 5 Hz stimulation (33van Deursen J. Heerschap A. Oerlemans F. Ruitenbeek W. Jap P. ter Laak H. Wieringa B. Cell. 1993; 74: 621-631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). M-CK KO mice only maintain 50% control levels of force after the 20th contraction. BB-CK rescued this contractile defect as illustrated by the fact that switch mice are able to maintain force as well as control mice (Fig. 4). No significant differences between switch mice and control were detected with a 5-s tetanic stimulation protocol as well (data not shown). CK is central to cellular energy metabolism and is one of the best studied examples of an enzyme that exhibits subcellular compartmentation (13Gellerich F. Saks V.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Theoretical explanations for subcellular compartmentation of enzymes ascribe its importance to roles in metabolic control, enzymatic activity, and substrate utilization (10Acerenza L. J. Theor.

To test the role of myofibrilar localization of CK, the consequences of a complete CK isoform switch from MM-CK to the BB-CK isoform, which does not localize to the M line (28Cande W.Z. Nature. 1983; 304: 557-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 29Silver R.B. Saft M.S. Taylor A.R. Cole R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13287-13291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were studied in transgenic mouse skeletal muscle. In MM-CK knockout mice there are large contractile defects (33van Deursen J. Heerschap A. Oerlemans F. Ruitenbeek W. Jap P. ter Laak H. Wieringa B. Cell. 1993; 74: 621-631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 34van Deursen J. Ruitenbeek W. Heerschap A. Jap P. ter Laak H. Wieringa B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

When MM-CK was replaced by BB-CK, the aberrant contractile phenotypes seen in MM-CK knockout mice were returned to normal despite the lack of myofibrillar localization. These results indicate that CK compartmentation to the myofibril of skeletal muscle is not essential for contractile function and that there is functional equivalence of creatine kinase isoforms in supporting cellular energy metabolism. The activities determined from extracts representV max activities. It has been previously shown that the in vivo activity of CK is much less than theV max activity in muscle (37Brosnan M.J. Raman S.P. Chen L. Koretsky A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C151-C160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous results with different M-CK KO alleles indicated that the contractile defects and adaptation detected due to the lack of MM-CK were not measurable until CK V max activities dropped below 20% of control levels and in vivo rates of MM-CK dropped below 30% (34van Deursen J. Ruitenbeek W. Heerschap A. Jap P. ter Laak H. Wieringa B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9091-9095Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It is necessary to have BB-CK expression in the switch mice at or above these levels to begin to dissociate the importance of total CK from specific isoform activity. Compared with control levels, CK activity of switch mice is 37% from in vitro assays and 58% from in vivo assays as determined by 31P NMR. Subcellular localization of CK was determined by two different techniques, isolated myofibrils and immunofluorescence of tissue sections. Both techniques indicated that MM-CK was localized to myofibrils but that BB-CK was absent from myofibrils. The data of enzyme activity and subcellular localization demonstrate that in the switch muscle BB-CK is present and active both in vitro andin vivo and is not associated with the myofibrils. When CK levels are chronically modulated by chemical inhibitors or by genetic manipulation, there is usually an associated change in glycolytic and oxidative metabolites or enzymes (30Fitch C.D.

Foley J.M. Meyer R.A. Koretsky A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1236-C1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The complete set of metabolic adaptations seen in the M-CK KO mice (33van Deursen J. Heerschap A. Oerlemans F. Ruitenbeek W. Jap P. ter Laak H. Wieringa B. Cell. 1993; 74: 621-631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) were not present in the switch mice. Most of these adaptations returned to the control state by the increased CK activity provided by BB-CK. Interestingly, adenylate kinase levels remained significantly elevated in the switch mice as compared with wild-type controls. Indeed, these results combined with other results on mice overexpressing the B-CK subunit in skeletal muscles (38Roman B.B. Foley J.M. Meyer R.A. Koretsky A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1236-C1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) support the idea that adenylate kinase levels are adjusted in response to changes in CK levels; however, this may be independent of the isoform of CK present (39Zeleznikar R.J. Dzeja P.P. Goldberg N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7311-7319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The most important test to see if BB-CK could reverse the phenotypes detected in MM-CK KO mice was to measure force generation in the hind limb muscle. The stimulation protocol used resulted in muscles unable to maintain control levels of force generation, which is described as a lack of burst activity (33van Deursen J. Heerschap A. Oerlemans F. Ruitenbeek W. Jap P. ter Laak H. Wieringa B. Cell. 1993; 74: 621-631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 34van Deursen J. Ruitenbeek W. Heerschap A. Jap P. ter Laak H. Wieringa B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9091-9095Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This mechanical adaptation to the lack of MM-CK clearly shows the importance of CK activity to muscle. Switch mice stimulated under identical conditions were able to produce control level force. Thus, the large decrease in force production that occurs in mice lacking MM-CK was fully rescued by BB-CK present in the switch mice despite lower than control levels of CK and lack of localization to the myofibrils. The phylogenetic tree of CK reveals gene duplication events that resulted in the multiple isoforms expressed today in cellular systems of all vertebrates and most invertebrates. Based on sequence homology there are distant evolutionary connections between CK and other guanidino kinases such as arginine kinase, the major guanidino kinase found in invertebrates (40Muhlebach S.M. Gross M. Wirz T. Wallimann T. Perriard J.C. Wyss M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 133/134: 245-262Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Conservation of guanidino kinases indicates an important role in cellular energetics for this class of enzyme. There is approximately 98% homology in MM-CK and 95% homology in BB-CK across species. The intraspecies homology between MM-CK and BB-CK is approximately 80%, which although less than interspecies homology within isoform is still extremely high (40Muhlebach S.M. Gross M. Wirz T. Wallimann T. Perriard J.C. Wyss M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 133/134: 245-262Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Interestingly there is sequence divergence between MM and BB-CK in the carboxyl-terminal of the enzyme. By expressing M-CK/B-CK fusions it has been shown that the carboxyl terminus of M-CK contains the information necessary for localization to myofibrils (41Schafer B.W. Perriard J.-C. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1161-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, differences in nontranslated regions of CK mRNA have been shown to cause localization of M-CK transcripts to myofibrils and control mRNA stability in B-CK transcripts (42Wilson I.A. Brindle K.M. Fulton A.M. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, sophisticated systems for localization of both CK transcripts and protein have evolved. The fact that there are divergent mechanisms that affect enzyme localization argues for potential differences in CK isoenzyme function. On the other hand, the large amount of homology indicates that MM-CK and BB-CK could play redundant roles in cellular energetics. Prior to the present study, the redundancy of CK isoforms in tissue function had not been tested. Results presented here demonstrate that BB-CK can rescue the contractile defects that occur in mice deficient in MM-CK. This rescue occurs despite the fact that BB-CK does not localize to myofibrils, indicating that localization of CK to the M line of myofibrils is not essential for force maintenance. This was true despite less than control levels of BB-CK. It may be that more subtle changes have to be examined to see a phenotype associated with lack of localization, for example, it may be that differences in MM-CK and BB-CK containing muscles may be revealed by comparing the effects of a more strenuous contractile protocol or long term training. These results support the idea that only a minimal level of CK is required for proper contractile function independent of localization. Initial results for heart and diaphragm from the M-CK KO mice indicate these tissues function like control, probably due to sufficient amounts of mitochondrial CK (43Veksler V.I. Kuznetsov A.V.

Physiol. 1997; 82: 1416-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it may be that localization of CK to other structures is important and that BB-CK is properly localized. For example, MM-CK has been shown to be associated with the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and recent evidence indicates that there are defects in calcium handling in M-CK KO and combined mitochondrial and M-CK KO mice (46Steeghs K. Benders A. Oerlemans F. de Haan A. Heerschap A. Ruitenbeek W. Jost C. van Deursen J. Perryman B. Pette D. Bruckwilder M. Koudijs J. Jap P. Veerkamp J. Wieringa B. Cell. 1997; 89: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Finally, it is possible that metabolic adaptations substitute for any function of the localized forms of CK (43Veksler V.I. Kuznetsov A.V. Anflous K. Mateo P. van Deursen J. Wieringa B.

Physiol. 1997; 82: 1416-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), although little evidence of adaptation was found in the switch muscle. Rather than serve a specific function, it may be that localization of metabolic enzymes to subcellular structures occurs to avoid macromolecular crowding in general in the cell (47Cuneo P. Magri E. Verzola A. Grazi E. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). If true then disrupting the localization of any one enzyme will not have functional consequences. In conclusion, it is clear that for the protocols examined, BB-CK can replace MM-CK, despite lack of localization to the myofibrils.

Succinate-Q reductase is composed of two parts, soluble succinate dehydrogenase and a membrane anchoring protein fraction (QPs). Succinate dehydrogenase contains two protein subunits, a 70-kDa flavoprotein (FP) with a covalently linked flavin adenine dinucleotide and a 27-kDa iron-sulfur protein (IP) with three iron-sulfur clusters (2Fe-2S, 3Fe-4S, and 4Fe-4S) (2Hederstedt L.

Engel W.D. von Jagow G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 224-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). These three subunits, with apparent molecular masses of 14, 11, and 9 kDa, are named QPs1, QPs2, and QPs3, respectively. The function of QPs is to provide membrane docking for succinate dehydrogenase and the Q-binding sites for succinate-Q reductase. Soluble succinate dehydrogenase catalyzes electron transfer from succinate to redox dyes, such as phenazine methosulfate and ferricyanide (12King T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 10: 322-331Crossref Scopus (526) Google Scholar), but it cannnot catalyze the 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA)-sensitive electron transfer from succinate to Q. Addition of QPs to soluble succinate dehydrogenase converts succinate dehydrogenase to the membrane-bound, TTFA-sensitive succinate-Q reductase (13Yu L. Xu J-X. Haley P.E. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1137-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with detectable ubisemiquinone radicals (14Miki T. Yu L. Yu C.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 299: 61-66Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Participation of QPs in the Q-binding of succinate-Q reductase was further established by photoaffinity labeling studies with [3H]azido-Q derivatives (10Lee G.Y. He D-Y. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6193-6198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). When a succinate-free, partially Q-deficient succinate-Q reductase is treated with [3H]azido-Q derivatives in the dark followed by illumination with a long wavelength UV light, about 50% of bound Q is located on QPs1 and the other 50% is equally distributed between QPs2 and QPs3 (10Lee G.Y. He D-Y. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6193-6198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The Q-binding domain in the proposed structure of QPs1, based on the deduced amino acid sequence (15Yu L. Wei Y-Y. Usui S. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24508-24515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Cochran B. Capaldi R.A. Ackrell B.A.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), is located in a loop connecting transmembrane helices 2 and 3, which protrude from the surface of the M side of the inner membrane (10Lee G.Y. He D-Y. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6193-6198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although lesser amounts of azido-Q were found in QPs2 and QPs3, involvement of these two subunits in the Q-binding site cannot be ruled out. The low azido-Q uptake by QPs2 and QPs3 may result from (i) only part of a Q-binding site being formed by these two subunits, (ii) preferential binding of these two subunits by endogenous Q present in the partially Q-deficient succinate-Q reductase used in these photoaffinity labeling studies, or (iii) QPs2 and QPs3 being the same peptide, i.e. either QPs2 is incompletely processed QPs3 or QPs3 is a COOH-terminal truncate of QPs2. If the latter is true, the amount of azido-Q uptake by QPs2 or QPs3 equals that by QPs1. Isolation of an azido-Q-linked peptide from azido-Q-labeled QPs2 or QPs3, obtained from azido-Q-labeled succinate-Q reductase, will help determine the Q-binding role of QPs2 or QPs3. However, identification of the Q-binding domains in QPs2 or QPs3 requires knowledge of the amino acid sequences of these two subunits. Herein, we report cloning and nucleotide sequencing the cDNA encoding QPs3, the immunological determination of the topology of QPs3 in the inner mitochondrial membrane using monospecific polyclonal antibodies against two synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 1–14 and 55–66, isolating and sequencing an azido-Q-linked peptide from labeled QPs3, and the localization of the Q-binding domain in the proposed model of QPs3.

Yang F-D. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 963-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calcium phosphate was prepared according to Jenner (18Jenner, E. L. (June 5, 1973) U. S. Patent 3737516.Google Scholar) and mixed at a 3:1 ratio with cellulose powder prior to use in column chromatography. Intact bovine heart mitochondria (19Harmon H.J. Crane F.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 440: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), mitoplasts (20Greenawalt J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 310-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), submitochondrial particles (21Harmon H.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1982; 14: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and succinate-Q reductase (22Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 257: 2016-2021Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) were prepared and assayed as previously reported. Succinate-Q reductase was assayed, at room temperature, for its ability to catalyze TTFA-sensitive Q-stimulated DCPIP reduction by succinate using a Shimadzu UV-2101PC. The reaction mixture (1 ml) contains 40 μmol of DCPIP, 100 μmol of sodium potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 20 μmol of succinate, 10 nmol of EDTA, 25 nmol of Q0C10, and 0.01% of Triton X-100. The reduction of DCPIP was followed by measuring the absorption decrease at 600 nm, using a millimolar extinction coefficient of 21 mmol−1 cm−1. The concentration of TTFA used was 10−4m. PCR amplification was performed in a minicycler from M. J. Research. The thermal cycle was set-up as follows: step 1, 95 °C for 3 min; step 2, 94 °C for 1 min for denaturation; step 3, 37 °C for 2 min for annealing; and step 4, 70 °C for 90 s for extension. A total of 30 cycles were performed with a final extension step of 7 min. This was done at the Core Facility of Oklahoma State University with an automatic DNA sequencer from Applied Biosystems, model 373 A. Isolated succinate-Q reductase was diluted to 2 mg/ml with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% sodium cholate. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 30 min and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% sodium cholate. The column was, in sequence, washed with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% sodium cholate; 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing 2% sodium cholate and 4 m urea; and 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing 2% sodium cholate. QPs was eluted from the column with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing 0.15% SDS. Pure QPs3 was obtained from QPs by preparative SDS-PAGE essentially according to the previously reported method (10Lee G.Y. He D-Y. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6193-6198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) except that the gels were pre-run for 10 h at 45 V with an anode buffer containing 0.1m Tris-Cl, pH 8.9, 0.1 mm sodium thioglycolate and a cathode buffer containing 2% m Tris, 0.1m Tricine, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1 mm sodium thioglycolate. The gel-eluted QPs3 protein was concentrated by membrane filtration, using centricon-10, to a protein concentration of 2 mg/ml and precipitated with cold acetone (−20 °C). These precipitates were washed with 50% acetone, dried under argon, and subjected to NH2-terminal sequence analysis. These analyses were done at the Molecular Biology Resource Facility, Saint Francis Hospital of Tulsa Medical Research Institute, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center under the supervision of Dr. Ken Jackson. Purified succinate-Q reductase was photoaffinity labeled with [3H]azido-Q derivative as reported previously (10Lee G.Y. He D-Y. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6193-6198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The azido-Q-labeled reductase was precipitated by 43% ammonium sulfate saturation, separated by centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 20 min, dissolved in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, and dialyzed against double-distilled water, overnight, with one change of water. [3H]azido-Q-labeled QPs3 was purified to homogeneity from this dialyzed, labeled succinate-Q reductase as described above for isolation of pure QPs3. The acetone precipitate of electrophoretically eluted [3H]azido-Q-labeled QPs3 was dissolved in 0.1m Tris, 6 m guanidine HCl, 1 mmEDTA, pH 8.3, and subjected to reductive carboxymethylation and succinylation as described previously (23He D-Y. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2292-2298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reductive carboxymethylated and succinylated QPs3, 1 mg/ml, suspended in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, containing 1 murea was treated with chymotrypsin at 37 °C for 2 h, using a chymotrypsin to QPs3 ratio of 1:50 (w/w). After the 2-h incubation, a second addition of chymotrypsin was made (1:100), and the digestion was continued at 37 °C for 24 h. 100 μl aliquots of the chymotrypsin-digested, reductive carboxymethylated, succinylated, [3H]azido-Q-labeled QPs3 were separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a Synchropak RP-8 column (0.46 × 25 cm) using a gradient formed from 90% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid with a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. 0.8-ml fractions were collected and monitored for radioactivity and absorbance at 214 nm. Fractions with radioactivity were collected, dried, and sequenced. Those containing no radioactivity, with retention times of 18.96 and 31.15 were also collected, dried, and sequenced. Pure QPs3 (see above) was used as antigen to raise antibodies in rabbits (15Yu L. Wei Y-Y. Usui S. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24508-24515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two polypeptides, one containing 14 amino acid residues (NH2-S-G-S-K-A-A-S-L-H-W-T-G-E-R-COOH) corresponding to residues 1–14 of QPs3 (the NH2-terminal peptide, see Fig.4) and another containing 11 amino acid residues (NH2-T-D-Y-V-H-G-D-A-V-Q-K-COOH corresponding to residues 56–66 (the connecting peptide, the loop between helices 2 and 3, see Fig. 4) were synthesized, purified, and used as antigens, after conjugation with ovalbumin, to raise antibodies in rabbits (24Li L.-B. Zou Y.-P. Yu L. Yu C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1057: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Boosters were given weekly for 5 weeks, and sera were collected by cardiac puncture. Purification of antibodies and preparation of the antibody Fab′ fragment-horseradish peroxidase conjugates were as previously reported (15Yu L. Wei Y-Y. Usui S. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24508-24515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase activity of the purified conjugate was assayed using a TMB peroxidase substrate kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer instructions. Since the amino acid sequences of the membrane-anchoring subunits in succinate-Q reductase from different species show little conservation (25Hagerhall C. Hederstedt L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we did not use the homology probing strategy to obtain the cDNA for QPs3. The availability of anti-QPs3 antibodies in our laboratory together with our previous success in immunological screening of a beef heart cDNA expression library in λgt11 to obtain cDNAs for the Rieske iron sulfur protein (26Usui S. Yu L. Yu C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 575-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the QPc 9.5 kDa (27Yu L. Deng K-P. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25634-25638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) of ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase, and the QPs1 (15Yu L. Wei Y-Y. Usui S. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24508-24515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of succinate-Q reductase encouraged us to use the immunological screening method to isolate the cDNA for QPs3. However, no positive result was obtained. This failure to obtain cDNA for QPs3 by the immunological screening method is probably due to the low titer of antibodies against QPs3 rather than the lack of QPs3 cDNA in the cDNA library used because we also failed to obtain a positive clone from other beef heart cDNA libraries, such as λZAP (from Stratagene). In an effort to obtain high titer anti-QPs3 antibodies, we added several more booster injections to rabbits and tried to raise antibodies in chickens. However, both attempts failed. It was reported (28Friedman K.D. Rosen N.L. Newman P.J. Montgomery R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8718Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) that specific cDNA inserts are obtained from the cDNA libraries constructed in λgt11 by PCR amplification using synthetic guessmers. The design of synthetic guessmers requires knowledge of a partial amino acid sequence of the target protein. When purified QPs3 (Fig. 1 A, lane 6) was subjected to protein sequencing, 43 residues from the NH2 terminus were obtained, NH2SGSKAASLHWTGERVVSVLLLGLIPAAYLNPCSAMDYSLAATL-. This enabled us to use the PCR cloning method to isolate the QPs3 cDNA from a beef heart cDNA library in λZAP. A 110-bp cDNA fragment was amplified from a beef heart cDNA library in λZAP (4 × 106 plaque-forming unit) by PCR using two synthetic guessmers, 5′-GCTGCCTCCCTGCACTGGAC-3′ (the sense primer) and 5′-GCAGCCAGGGAGTAGTCCAT-3′ (the antisense primer). The sense primer represents the guessed sequence for residues 5–11 (A-A-S-L-H-W-T) with the degenerate third base of the codon of T11 being omitted. The antisense primer represents the guessed sequence for residues 41–35 (A-A-L-S-Y-D-M). Since W and M have no degeneracy in their genetic codes, the presence of W10 and M35 in the QPs3 partial sequence enables us to design these two PCR guessmers with specificity at the 3′ end, five specific bases in the 3′ end of the sense guessmer, and three in the antisense guessmer. The PCR reaction consists of 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 30 mm KCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 100 μg of autoclaved gelatin, 100 μm dNTP, 2 units of Taq polymerase, and 200 pmol of guessmers. The resulting 110-bp PCR product was cloned into a PCR vector (TA cloning kit) and sequenced. The DNA sequence of this 110-bp PCR product translated to match the amino acid residues between Trp10 and Met35 of the chemically determined partial NH2-terminal sequence of QPs3. Based on the nucleotide sequence for residues 10–35 of QPs3, two gene specific primers, 5′-TTGCTCCTGGGCCTAATTCC-3′, corresponding to residues 21–27 (sense primer), and 5′-AGGAGCAAAACACTGAACAAC-3′, corresponding to residues 22–17 (antisense primer), were synthesized and used with the primers of vector ZAP, T7 and T3, respectively, in the subsequent PCR reactions to yield 3′- and 5′-RACE products. These two PCR products were cloned into the PCR II vector and sequenced. The 3′-RACE product is confirmed by matching the deduced amino acid residues 21–42 of QPs3 with chemically determined partial NH2-terminal amino acid sequence, and residues 59–66 and 44–49 with chymotryptic peptides of QPs3 with retention times of 18.96 and 31.15 min, respectively, on an HPLC chromatogram. Although the 5′- and 3′-RACE products can be joined together by PCR using a marathon cDNA amplification method (29CLONTECH Clontechniques. 10. Clontech Laboratory Inc., Palo Alto, CA1995: 4-8Google Scholar), no effort was made to obtain a combined RACE product in this investigation. However, for future structure-function studies of QPs3, we have obtained a 331-bpBamHI-EcoRI cDNA fragment encoding mature QPs3 protein by PCR amplification from the beef heart cDNA library in λZAP using two primers, GGATCCTCTGGTTCCAAG (sense primer) and GAATTCTAAAAGGTCAGAGC (antisense), and cloned into a PCR vector. Fig. 2 shows the nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence of QPs3. The QPs3 cDNA is 1330 base pairs long with an open reading frame of 474 base pairs that encodes 158 amino acid residues, of which 103, starting with serine, belong to mature QPs3 and 55, starting with methionine, constitute an NH2-terminal presequence. In addition, the cDNA has 820 nucleotides of 3′ non-coding sequence and contains a poly(A) tail. The presequence of QPs3 is rich in the basic amino acid arginine and contains the hydroxy amino acid serine. This is characteristic of the cleavable amino acid terminal presequences that are essential for the import of mitochondrial proteins encoded by nuclear DNA (30Hurt E.C. Van Loon A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 204-207Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Since the QPs3 presequence lacks Arg at the −2 position relative to the mature amino terminus, QPs3 may be matured by a two-step cleavage process (31Hendrick P.J. Hodges P.E. Rosenberg L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4056-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial proteins with leader peptides containing the R-X-(F)-X-X-(S) motif, wherer = arginine at the −10 position, X = other amino acid at −9; (F) = hydrophobic residues at −8; and (S) = serine, threonine, or glycine at −5, are thought to cleave first by a matrix processing protease between residues at −9 and −8 since arginine at position −10 is at position −2 relative to the cleaved bond. The remaining octapeptide is subsequently removed by an intermediate-specific protease. Although the QPs3 presequence lacks the arginine−10 in the common motif of this two-step cleavage, the maturation of QPs3 may still follow the same process because mutation of arginine−10, in the human ornithine transcarbamylase precursor or rat malate dehydrogenase precursor, to alanine (32Horwich A.L. Kalousek F. Fenton W.A. Pollock R.A. Rosenberg L.E. Cell. 1986; 44: 451-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 33Chu T.W. Grant P.M. Strauss A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12806-12811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) does not alter the two-step maturation of these two proteins. The molecular mass of mature QPs3, determined from the deduced amino acid sequence, is 10,989 daltons, which is fairly close to the 9 kDa estimated from SDS-PAGE. Fig. 3 compares the amino acid sequence of bovine QPs3 with those of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sdh4 (34Bullis B.L. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6543-6549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), adult Ascaris suum cytbS (35Saruta F. Hirawake H. Takamiya S. Ma Y-C. Aoki T. Sekimizu K. Kojima S. Kita K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1276: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and Escherichia coli SdhD (36Wood D. Darlison M.G. Wilde R.J. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 519-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and FrdD (37Cole S.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Bovine QPs3 shares little sequence homology with gene products of S. cerevisiae sdh4, E. coli sdhD, and frdD but has 50% sequence identity with the A. suum (adult) cytochrome b small subunit of fumarate reductase (35Saruta F. Hirawake H. Takamiya S. Ma Y-C. Aoki T. Sekimizu K. Kojima S. Kita K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1276: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the similarity between bovine QPs3 and A. suum cybS in the region from Leu-23 to His-60 of QPs3 (68%) is higher than that of the entire peptide. This region contains a conserved histidine residue that matches His-71 of E. coliSdhD, which provides the heme b ligand (38Nakamura K. Yamaki M. Sarada M. Nakayama S. Vibat C.R.T. Gennis R.B. Nakayashiki T. Inokuchi H. Kojima S. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 521-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). His-81 ofE. coli FrdD that was reported to be involved in Q-binding is also in this region (39Westenberg D.J. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A. Sices H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It should be mentioned that the QPs3 cDNA was found to have 85% sequence identity to the DNA sequence of a Homo Sapiens cDNA clone (R91018) according to a BLAST search of the Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) data base. Fig. 4 shows the proposed structure of QPs3 in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This structural model, constructed from hydropathy plots of the amino acid sequence of QPs3 (40Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar), predicted tendencies to form α-helices and β-sheets and the binding of Fab′ fragment-horseradish peroxidase conjugates, prepared from antibodies against synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 1–14 and 55–66 of QPs3, in mitoplasts, submitochondrial particles (SMP), and alkali-treated submitochondrial particles. In this model, QPs3 has three transmembrane helices corresponding to residues 15–34 (helix I), 37–56 (helix II), and 67–89 (helix III). The NH2-terminal region, residues 1–14, and the loop connecting helices II and III, residues 57–66, are extruded from the M-side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. The loop connecting helices I and II, residues 36–37, and the COOH-terminal region, residues 90–103, are on the C-side of the membrane. The sidedness of the membrane in this model was determined immunologically with Fab′-horseradish peroxidase conjugates prepared from anti-QPs3, anti-NH2-terminal peptide (residues 1–14), and anti-connecting peptide (residues 57–66) antibodies in bovine heart mitoplasts (digitonin-treated intact mitochondria), SMP (reverse orientation), and alkaline-treated SMP (SMP devoid of succinate dehydrogenase). The peroxidase activity assays of these three particles are shown in Fig. 5. Since the peroxidase activity observed with preimmune Fab′-horseradish peroxidase-treated preparations is assumed to be due to nonspecific binding, it is subtracted from that of the anti-QPs3, anti-NH2-terminal peptide, or anti-connecting peptide Fab′-horseradish peroxidase-treated preparations. The intactness of mitoplasts and submitochondrial particle preparations was established by the absence and presence of rotenone-sensitive NADH-Q reductase activity. When mitoplasts and SMP preparations were treated with anti-QPs3 Fab′ fragment-peroxidase conjugates, peroxidase activity was detected in both preparations. The slightly higher activity in treated SMP suggests that QPs3 is a transmembranous protein with slightly more mass exposed on the matrix side of the membrane. When an alkali-treated SMP preparation is treated with anti-QPs3 Fab′ fragment-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, only a slight increase in peroxidase activity is observed, indicating that few epitopes on the matrix side of QPs3 are covered by succinate dehydrogenase. When mitoplasts and SMP preparations are treated with Fab′ fragment-horseradish peroxidase conjugates prepared from anti-N-terminal and connecting peptides antibodies, peroxidase activity is observed only on SMP, indicating that the NH2-terminal end and the loop connecting helices II and III are exposed on the M-side of the mitochondrial inner membrane. It should be mentioned that during the course of immunological studies of QPs3 we observed that antibodies against QPs3, the NH2-terminal, and the connecting peptides cross-react with QPs2 (Fig. 1, B-D, lanes 3 and5). They do not react with QPs1 or proteins in ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase (see Fig. 1). Antibodies against QPs2 also react with QPs3 (data not shown). This immunocross-reaction of QPs2 and QPs3 is expected because the QPs3 sequence is contained in QPs2. This is evident from the following observations. (i) When an electrophoretically pure QPs2 preparation (Fig. 1 A, lane 5) is subjected to protein sequencing, a major peptide with a partial NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of Ser-Pro-Ser-His-His-Ser-Gly-Ser-Lys-Ala- is obtained. This sequence contains five amino acid residues from the COOH terminus of the presequence and five amino acid residues from the NH2 terminus of mature QPs3, suggesting that QPs2 is incompletely processed QPs3. (ii) When chymotrypsin-digested QPs2 and QPs3 are subjected to HPLC separation, identical chromatograms are obtained (data not shown). (iii) When peptides with identical retention times, from the respective QPs2 and QPs3 HPLC chromatograms, are sequenced, identical sequences are obtained. (iv) The azido-Q-labeled peptide from QPs2 is identical to that from QPs3 (described in the next section). At present, we do not know whether QPs2 is the same or a different gene product than QPs3. This requires further investigation. When succinate-Q reductase is photoaffinity labeled with [3H]azido-Q derivative, about 50% of bound azido-Q is in QPs1, 22% in QPs2, and 25% in QPs3 (10Lee G.Y. He D-Y. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6193-6198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The smaller azido-Q uptake by QPs2 or QPs3, compared with QPs1, questions the Q-binding role of these two subunits. One way to establish a Q binding role for QPs3 is to isolate an [3H]azido-Q-linked peptide from [3H]azido-Q-labeled QPs3 obtained from [3H]azido-Q-labeled succinate-Q reductase. [3H]azido-Q-labeled QPs3 is isolated from [3H]azido-Q labeled succinate-Q reductase by a procedure involving phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column chromatography, preparative SDS-PAGE, electrophoretic elution of proteins from gel slices, and acetone precipitation. The use of a hydrophobic column, phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, and elution with different detergents results in the isolation of [3H]azido-Q-labeled QPs from [3H]azido-Q-labeled succinate-Q reductase. Since the FP and IP subunits of succinate dehydrogenase are less hydrophobic than those of QPs subunits, they are eluted with detergents having less hydrophobicity than that used for eluting QPs. This column chromatographic step also removes most of the non-protein bound [3H]azido-Q from QPs. Pure [3H]azido-Q-labeled QPs3 is isolated from the labeled QPs by preparative SDS-PAGE using high resolution gel system in the presence of 8 m urea. The use of preparative SDS-PAGE not only separates QPs3 from other QPs subunits, it also further removes non-protein bound azido-Q adducts from QPs3. QPs3 in gel slices is eluted by electrophoretic eluting. The SDS present in the eluted protein solution was removed by 50% acetone precipitation. Although the isolated [3H]azido-Q-labeled QPs3 is pure and free of free azido-Q, it is highly aggregated and resistant to proteolytic enzyme digestion. Inclusion of 0.1% SDS and 2m urea in the digestion mixture does not increase proteolysis. Modification of isolated azido-Q labeled QPs3 by reductive carboxymethylation followed by succinylation renders the protein susceptible to chymotrypsin digestion. Reductive carboxymethylated and succinylated QPs3 is not completely soluble in aqueous solution; the solution becomes clear only after chymotrypsin digestion. A similar situation was observed with azido-Q labeled-cytochrome b(23He D-Y. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2292-2298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows the radioactivity distribution among the chymotryptic peptides of QPs3 separated by HPLC. Most of the radioactivity was found in fraction 66 (P-66). It should be mentioned that the HPLC chromatograms and radioactivity distribution of the chymotryptic peptides of QPs2 are identical to those of QPs3 (data not shown). When P-66 from QPs3 was sequenced, a partial NH2-terminal sequence of Leu-Asn-Pro-Cys-Ser-Ala-Met-Asp-Tyr, corresponding to residues 29–37 in QPs3, is obtained. An identical sequence is obtained for the radioactivity containing fraction from QPs2. Thus the Q-binding domain in the proposed structure of QPs3, is probably located at the end of transmembrane helix 1, near the C-side of the membrane. Recall that the Q-binding domain of QPs1 is on the M-side of the mitochondrial inner membrane. The finding that the Q-binding domains in QPs3 and QPs1 of bovine succinate-Q reductase are on opposite sides of the membrane is in line with a two-Q binding site hypothesis formulated from inhibitor studies of this enzyme complex (41Yankovskaya V. Sablin S.O. Ramsay R.R. Singer T.P. Ackrell B.A. Cecchini G. Miyoshi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21020-21024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The presence of two quinone-binding sites in E. coli fumarate reductase is suggested by mutational studies (39Westenberg D.J. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A. Sices H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by inhibitor kinetics analysis of putative Q-binding site mutants (41Yankovskaya V. Sablin S.O. Ramsay R.R. Singer T.P. Ackrell B.A. Cecchini G. Miyoshi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21020-21024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). When these two quinone binding sites in E. coli fumarate reductase are incorporated into a proposed mechanism of Q reduction in photoreaction centers (42Allen J. Feher G. Yeates T.O. Komiya H.

EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2445-2451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Glu-29, Ala-32, His-82, Trp-86 of FrdC and His-80 of FrdD are considered participants in a QB-type site, and FrdD Phe-57, Glu-59, and Ser-60 in an apolar QA-type site (39Westenberg D.J. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A. Sices H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to the proposed structure of E. coli FrdC and FrdD, the QB-type site is located at the cytoplasmic side and the QA-type site at periplasmic side. If this reasoning is applied to beef heart mitochondrial succinate-Q reductase, the Q-binding domain identified in QPs1 (10Lee G.Y. He D-Y. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6193-6198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) would be the QB-type site and the domain in QPs3 is the QA-type site. More detailed information on Q-binding must await determination of the three-dimensional structure of succinate-Q reductase.

Single-chain peptides combining AVP and BK directly, AVP(1-9)-BK(1-9) or via a flexible aminohexanoic acid (epsilonAhx) linker, AVP(1-9)-epsilonAhx-BK(1-9), bind with relatively high affinity to the bovine kidney medulla B2a bradykinin receptor (B2a BKR). Significantly, amino-terminal extended chimeric analogs of BK, including AVP(1-9)-BK(1-9) and galanin(1-13)-BK(1-9), are functional B2 BKR agonists. These findings illustrate that chimeric peptides can activate G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in a manner analogous to that of endogenous monomeric agonists. Further development, combining the sequences of receptor subtype-selective antagonists, produced high-affinity chimeric antagonists of the V1a vasopressin receptor (V1a VPR) and the B2a BKR. We also determined the pharmacological characteristics of high-affinity chimeric hormone analogs derivatized with the membrane targeting function of mastoparan. Homodimers of an amino-terminal extended BK analog and a V1a-selective antagonist represent the first examples of new classes of B2 BKR and V1a VPR antagonists, respectively. These findings are discussed in relation to the GPCR binding site for small peptides and the development of novel biological probes and therapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W1922150039,"Amphibian metamorphosis and mammalian T cell development represent two of the best known systems where developmental programmed cell death through apoptosis takes place. Two immunosuppressants, cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506, have been demonstrated to inhibit activation-induced cell death in immature T cells and T cell hybridomas. In this study, we have established an in vitro system in which isolated primary tadpole intestinal epithelial cells undergo typical apoptosis upon treatment with thyroid hormone (T3), the causative agent of metamorphosis. It is surprising that this T3-induced apoptosis was found to be inhibited only by CsA but not by FK506, whereas both immunosuppressants block activation-induced apoptosis in T cells. Since T3 exerts its effect primarily by regulating gene transcription through direct binding to nuclear thyroid hormone receptors, our results strongly suggest that except for their similarity in the T cell receptor-mediated signal transduction process, CsA, but not FK506, also blocks another yet-unidentified step during the induction of apoptosis. The identification of this novel function of CsA may provide an important clue toward the understanding of the mechanism of apoptosis and helps in designing better clinical applications of the immunosuppressants."
https://openalex.org/W2050564952,"The elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) fromPseudomonas aeruginosa was purified as a 45-kDa polypeptide that forms a complex with both the 12- and 16-kDa forms of nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (Ndk) and predominantly synthesizes GTP. 70 S ribosomes of P. aeruginosa predominantly synthesize GTP, which is inhibited in presence of anti-Ndk antibodies. Anti-EF-Tu antibodies change the specificity of ribosomal GTP synthesis to all nucleoside triphosphate synthesis. Ndk has been shown to be a part of 30 S ribosomes, whereas EF-Tu is found to be associated with the 50 S ribosomal subunit. These data indicate that GTP synthesis in the ribosome is modulated both by Ndk and by EF-Tu. Peptide chain elongation as measured by polymerization of Phe-tRNA on a poly(U) template in presence of GDP can be inhibited by anti-Ndk antibodies and restored by the addition of GTP. Anti-EF-Tu antibodies similarly inhibit peptide chain elongation by P. aeruginosa ribosomes in the in vitro translation assay; however, this inhibition cannot be overcome by adding back GTP.

GTP binding proteins regulate a wide spectrum of intracellular processes. The protein elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) 1The abbreviations used are: EF-Tu, elongation factor Tu; Ndk, nucleoside-diphosphate kinase; Pk, pyruvate kinase. is a well documented abundant GTP binding protein in prokaryotes (1Zhang Y.-X Shi Y.

Elongation factor Tu binds aminoacyl-tRNA and GTP in a ternary complex that binds to the A site of the ribosome. When the tRNA anticodon matches the codon triplet of the programmed ribosome, GTP is hydrolyzed and EF-Tu·GDP complex dissociates, leaving the aminoacyl-tRNA in the A site, ready for peptidyl transferase. To participate in another round of elongation, the GDP in EF-Tu must be exchanged for GTP. This is normally catalyzed by EF-Ts, which upon binding to EF-Tu causes the release of GDP, which can then be converted to GTP for binding with EF-Tu. Without EF-Ts, EF-Tu has a high affinity for GDP and thus would predominate in this inactive state. Whether or how GDP is subsequently converted to GTP in the ribosome is not clear. Nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (Ndk) is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of terminal phosphate from ATP to any nucleoside (or deoxynucleoside) diphosphates to generate the corresponding NTPs and is thus important in maintaining the intracellular NTP pool. We have previously shown that in Pseudomonas aeruginosa 8830, the 16-kDa Ndk is cleaved by a protease to a 12-kDa form that is membrane-associated (4Shankar S. Kamath S. Chakrabarty A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1777-1781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The truncated 12-kDa form complexes with the enzyme pyruvate kinase (Pk) and predominantly synthesizes GTP (5Sundin G.W. Shankar S. Chugani S.A. Chopade B.A. Kavanaugh-Black A. Chakrabarty A.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 965-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). GTP is a crucial molecule in signal transduction and is required for the process of translational elongation in protein biosynthesis (6Kaziro Y. Itoh H. Kozasa T. Nakafufu M. Satoh T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 349-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Under conditions of amino acid starvation, GTP is acted upon by the ribosome-associated enzyme RelA, along with SpoT, to generate the signal transducing molecule guanosine tetraphosphate, ppGpp (7Cashel M. Methods Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 341-356PubMed Google Scholar). Though the role of GTP binding proteins has been well documented in eukaryotic cells, the significance of these proteins in prokaryotes remains to be deciphered. Because the enzyme Ndk has been implicated in generating GTP through complex formation with Pk (5Sundin G.W. Shankar S. Chugani S.A. Chopade B.A. Kavanaugh-Black A. Chakrabarty A.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 965-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and has also been reported to form complexes with a P. aeruginosa Ras-like GTP-binding protein Pra (8Chopade B. Shankar S. Sundin G.W. Mukhopadhyay S. Chakrabarty A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2181-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine if other GTP-binding proteins that require GTP for their cellular function may also form complexes with Ndk. In this work we demonstrate that EF-Tu forms a complex with both the intact 16-kDa form as well as the truncated 12-kDa form of Ndk to synthesize GTP. We additionally demonstrate that 70 S ribosomes from P. aeruginosa predominantly synthesize GTP and that this synthesis is accomplished by 30 S ribosome-associated Ndk and 50 S ribosome-associated EF-Tu. Peptide chain elongation, normally inhibited by anti-EF-Tu antibodies, is also inhibited by anti-Ndk antibodies. This latter inhibition can be restored by the addition of GTP. The significance of our observations to the overall function of Ndk in providing GTP to EF-Tu through complex formation and thereby regulating translational elongation is discussed. P. aeruginosa 8830 is a stable alginate producing strain. The organism was routinely grown in L broth in 1-liter batches at 37 °C to anA 600 value of 1.0. The cells from 1 liter of culture were harvested by centrifugation at 15,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended in 5 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgC12, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and lysed by French Press at 12,000 psi through two consecutive cycles. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min to obtain the clear supernatant, and the pellet was discarded. This supernatant was used as the starting material for purification of the protein EF-Tu from P. aeruginosa. Protein was estimated by Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). 3 g of activated Sepharose was suspended in 15 ml of chilled 0.2 mNaHCO3, pH 8.5, and stirred in cold for 15 min. 1 ml of 5 mg/ml solution of the protein Ndk was dialyzed against 0.2m NaHCO3 and added to the Sepharose suspension. Stirring was continued gently overnight in the cold. Powdered glycine was added to the suspension to a final concentration of 1 mand incubation continued for an additional 1 h at room temperature. The matrix was then washed sequentially with 0.5m NaHCO3, 0.5 m sodium acetate, and 2.0 m urea. The matrix was finally washed with buffer A and stored in the cold until further use. 1 ml of the matrix was saturated with 0.5 mm GTP and added to 40 mg of supernatant protein obtained from the P. aeruginosa cell lysate. After the proteins were allowed to interact with the matrix-bound Ndk for 30 min on ice, the matrix was washed with buffer A alone followed by batches of buffer A containing increasing NaCl solution (0–200 mm) and 0.5 mm GTP. Approximately 10 μg of protein from each of the salt wash fractions were run on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for detection of proteins that bound to the Ndk-Sepharose matrix. The N-terminal sequence of the proteins bound to the Ndk-Sepharose matrices and eluted at specific NaCl concentrations were carried out by Dr. K.-L. Ngai at the Noyes Genetic Engineering Facility of the University of Illinois at Urbana. The glycerol density gradient centrifugation was carried out as described previously (5Sundin G.W. Shankar S. Chugani S.A. Chopade B.A. Kavanaugh-Black A. Chakrabarty A.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 965-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A batch gradient of glycerol was prepared by successive layering of 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, and 5% glycerol solutions, each of 1-ml volume, in Beckman 10-ml ultracentrifuge tubes. The purified protein samples to be analyzed were carefully layered on top of the 5% band. The discontinuous gradient tubes were centrifuged at 40,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. Fractions were carefully collected by withdrawing 1-ml aliquots from the top of each gradient to microfuge tubes. All the fractions were analyzed by Western dot blot using anti-Ndk, anti-Pk, and anti-EF-Tu antibodies. NTP synthesizing activity was measured in 20-μl reaction volumes containing 250 μm each of CDP, GDP, and UDP as described previously (4Shankar S. Kamath S. Chakrabarty A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1777-1781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sundin G.W. Shankar S. Chugani S.A. Chopade B.A. Kavanaugh-Black A. Chakrabarty A.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 965-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by adding different amounts of purified protein and 10.0 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) along with 0.125 mm nonradioactive ATP. The reaction mixture was incubated for 1 min, followed by addition of 2 μl of 10 × SDS buffer. 1 μl of the reaction mixture was spotted on to a polyethyleneimine TLC plate and the reaction products were separated in 0.75 mKH2PO4 buffer, pH 3.75, as described previously (4Shankar S. Kamath S. Chakrabarty A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1777-1781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TLC plates were air dried, covered with plastic wrap, and autoradiographed. 70 S ribosomes from P. aeruginosa were isolated according to the method used for isolation of ribosomes from Escherichia coli (9Garrilova L.P. Spirin A.S. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 30: 452-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Nucleoside triphosphate synthesizing activity of ribosomes was analyzed in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 250 μm each of CDP, GDP, and UDP. 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP along with 125 μm ATP was added to the reaction mixture, and the reaction was started by the addition of 10 μg of 70 S ribosomes. The reaction mixture was incubated for 1 min at room temperature, followed by addition of 2 μl of 10 × SDS stop buffer. Anti-Ndk and anti-EF-Tu antibodies were added at a dilution of 1:1000 separately to see their effect on NTP synthesizing activity by the ribosomes. In a parallel experiment, purified proteins EF-Tu and Ndk were added back in increasing amounts to determine the restoration of NTP synthesizing activity of the ribosomes. 70 S ribosomes from P. aeruginosa were isolated and extracted with 100 mm, 200 mm, 500 mm, and 1.0 m KCl solution in TMNM buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 6 mm MgCl2, 30 mmNH4Cl, and 4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) sequentially, and at each step the pellet was resuspended while the supernatant was assayed for NTP synthesizing activity. In a separate experiment, 70 S ribosomes were separated into 30 and 50 S subunits by sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described for E. coli ribosomes (10Rheinberger H.-J. Geigenmuller U. Wedde M. Nierhaus K.H. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 164: 658-662Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Both the subunits were assayed individually for NTP synthesizing activity. The poly(U) directed polyphenylalanine synthesis from [14C]Phe-tRNA was carried out in 0.1 ml of reaction mixture (9Garrilova L.P. Spirin A.S. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 30: 452-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) consisting of 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 8 mm MgC12, 60 mm NH4Cl, 6 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm GTP, 5 mmphosphoenol pyruvate, 1 ng of pyruvate kinase, 40 μg of poly(U), 50 pmol of [14C] Phe-tRNA, 25 pmol of ribosomes with EF-G, and 50 pmol of purified EF-Tu. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 10 min in presence or the absence of anti-Ndk or anti-EF-Tu antibodies. The reaction was stopped with 100 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid, and kept on ice for 30 min. The precipitated samples were assayed for incorporation of [14C]Phe in trichloroacetic acid precipitated material using liquid scintillation spectrometry on a Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Rackbeta counter. We previously have reported the characterization of two proteins from P. aeruginosa that form complexes with Ndk and modulate its NTP synthesizing specificity to GTP. One is Pk, a 60-kDa protein (5Sundin G.W. Shankar S. Chugani S.A. Chopade B.A. Kavanaugh-Black A. Chakrabarty A.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 965-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), whereas the other is a 47-kDa Ras-like protein, Pra, with GTPase activity (8Chopade B. Shankar S. Sundin G.W. Mukhopadhyay S. Chakrabarty A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2181-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). There is a homolog of Pra in E. coli, known as Era, which is known to be an essential protein, but its exact function is unknown (11March P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1253-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Pillutla R.C. Sharer J.D. Gulati P.S. Wu E. Yamashita Y. Lerner C.G. Inouye M. March P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2194-2196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have reported that the E. coli Era protein, having intrinsic GTPase activity, can also form complexes with P. aeruginosa12-kDa Ndk to modulate its NTP synthesis to GTP (8Chopade B. Shankar S. Sundin G.W. Mukhopadhyay S. Chakrabarty A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2181-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To see if other Ndk-binding proteins could also be present in P. aeruginosa, we cross-linked Ndk to Sepharose 4B and allowed the Sepharose-bound Ndk to interact with proteins present in the cell lysates of P. aeruginosa. Unbound or loosely bound proteins were removed by exhaustive washing of the Sepharose matrix with buffer A. A linear gradient of NaCl (0–200 mm) in buffer A was then used to elute proteins that may have been retained in the matrix through complex formation with Ndk. A protein of about 60 kDa, presumably Pk, was eluted at 150 mm NaCl, whereas a protein of about 47 kDa, presumably Pra, was eluted from the Sepharose-Ndk column at 200 mm NaCl concentration. Interestingly, a protein of about 45 kDa was eluted from the Sepharose-Ndk-GTP column at a NaCl concentration of 75 mm. Lower concentrations of NaCl did not allow its release, suggesting a specific association of this protein to the Ndk-Sepharose column. This protein appeared to be present in abundant amount and was isolated in a purified form. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated a single band with a molecular mass of about 45 kDa (Fig. 1 A). N-terminal sequence determination of this protein revealed a high degree of sequence homology with EF-Tu from E. coli andChlamydia (Fig. 1 B). GTP-binding proteins such as IF-2, EF-Tu, and EF-G are known to mediate various steps in peptide chain initiation and elongation (13Moore P.B. Science. 1995; 270: 1453-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and the isolation of EF-Tu from an Ndk-Sepharose column appeared to suggest that Ndk may somehow form complexes with EF-Tu and modulate peptide chain elongation, perhaps through generation of GTP where it is needed.Figure 1Characterization of elongation factor Tu fromP. aeruginosa 8830. A, EF-Tu was isolated from the Sepharose 4B-Ndk-GTP matrix by elution with 75 mm NaCl. About 5 μg of this protein was analyzed for size and electrophoretic homogeneity on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.Lane 1, molecular mass markers; lane 2, 5 μg of purified protein. B, sequence comparisons of amino acids located at the N terminus of various bacterial EF-Tu proteins and the isolated protein from P. aeruginosa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the protein EF-Tu was isolated from Ndk-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography, we wanted to determine if this protein could form a complex with both the intact 16-kDa Ndk as well as the truncated 12-kDa form. We demonstrated previously that the other two Ndk-complexing proteins Pk and Pra could form complexes only with the 12-kDa form of Ndk and are associated with the membrane (5Sundin G.W. Shankar S. Chugani S.A. Chopade B.A. Kavanaugh-Black A. Chakrabarty A.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 965-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 8Chopade B. Shankar S. Sundin G.W. Mukhopadhyay S. Chakrabarty A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2181-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because cytoplasmic EF-Tu also associates with ribosomes, it was of interest to see if it could be associated with the 16-kDa Ndk, which is predominantly cytoplasmic (4Shankar S. Kamath S. Chakrabarty A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1777-1781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A, the 12-kDa form of Ndk was found in 5% glycerol fraction and did not show migrational shift when incubated with bovine serum albumin; however, on incubation with the purified protein EF-Tu, which itself sediments in 10% glycerol fraction (Fig.2 B), there is a shift in mobility because both the proteins are observed in 40% glycerol (Fig. 2 A, row EF-Tu-Ndk 12; Fig. 2 B, row EF-Tu-Ndk 12). The 16-kDa Ndk, which itself sediments in 5% glycerol, also showed mobility shift (sediments at 60% glycerol) when incubated with EF-Tu but not with the control protein bovine serum albumin. Moreover, EF-Tu does not show complex formation with Pk (Fig. 2 B, row EF-Tu-Pk). This lack of complex formation with Pk was also verified through use of anti-Pk antibodies that demonstrated a lack of mobility of Pk to a higher sedimenting form, when present with EF-Tu (data not shown). Complex formation is maximal when Ndk and EF-Tu are present in equimolar amounts. Dilution of one component by 2–8-fold leads to increasingly less complex formation, whereas a 10-fold dilution completely abrogates complex formation (data not shown). The enzyme Ndk is capable of synthesizing all NTPs from nucleoside diphosphates in the cell without any apparent preference. Because both the intact 16-kDa form as well as 12-kDa form of Ndk form complexes with EF-Tu (Fig. 2), it was of interest to determine if this interaction can alter the specificity of NTP formation by Ndk. When either the 12-kDa or the 16-kDa Ndk was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and nonradioactive CDP, UDP and GDP, the corresponding radioactive NTPs were formed. When EF-Tu was added to the 12-kDa or the 16-kDa form of Ndk, it resulted in predominant GTP synthesis (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and10). However, upon addition of anti EF-Tu antibodies to the 12-kDa Ndk·EF-Tu complex or the 16-kDa Ndk·EF-Tu complex, the specificity of GTP synthesis was lost and the corresponding radioactive NTPs were formed (Fig. 3, lanes 6 and 12). Addition of anti-Ndk antibodies to the Ndk·EF-Tu complexes inhibited phosphotransfer as expected (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and11), whereas EF-Tu itself had no phosphotransfer ability of its own (Fig. 3, lane 13). The process of translational elongation on ribosomes requires GTP. Because we found that the 16-kDa Ndk can form a complex with the purified protein EF-Tu and predominantly synthesizes GTP (Fig.3), we decided to examine if 70 S ribosomes themselves can synthesize NTPs, particularly GTP, and if such NTP synthesis by 70 S ribosomes can be altered by anti-Ndk and anti-EF-Tu antibodies. 70 S ribosomes ofP. aeruginosa predominantly synthesize GTP in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and nonradioactive CDP, UDP, and GDP (Fig. 4, lane 1), and this GTP synthesis can be inhibited by anti-Ndk antibodies (Fig. 4, lane 2). However, addition of increasing amounts of purified Ndk resulted in restoration of all NTP synthesis (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and6), presumably independent of the complex. In contrast, anti-EF-Tu antibodies altered GTP synthesis by ribosomes to nonspecific NTP (CTP, UTP, and GTP) synthesis under identical conditions (Fig. 4,lane 3), suggesting that EF-Tu was responsible for the specificity to GTP synthesis in ribosomes. Indeed, addition of excess amounts of EF-Tu restored GTP synthesis by the 70 S ribosomes (Fig. 4,lane 9), suggesting that both Ndk and EF-Tu play an important role in ribosomal GTP synthesis. The inhibition of ribosomal GTP synthesis by anti-Ndk antibodies implied that Ndk might be responsible for GTP synthesis by the ribosomes. To determine if Ndk is associated as a part of the ribosomes, the ribosomes were extracted with 100–1000 mm KCl solutions as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the extracts were examined for NTP synthesizing activity of Ndk. As demonstrated previously, 70 S ribosomes produce GTP from a mixture of CDP, UDP, and GDP in presence of [γ-32P]ATP (Fig.5 A, lane 1), and this GTP production is inhibited by anti-Ndk antibody (lane 2). The specificity for GTP synthesis is changed to nonspecific NTP synthesis in presence of anti-EF-Tu antibody (Fig. 5 A, lane 3). Extraction of the ribosomes with 100, 200, or 500 mm KCl did not release Ndk activity from 70 S ribosomes (Fig. 5 A, lanes 4–12); however, this activity was released from the ribosomes by 1000 mm KCl (Fig.5 A, lane 13). The released activity was inhibited by anti-Ndk antibody (Fig. 5 A, lane 14), but not by anti-EF-Tu antibodies, indicating that Ndk was released from the ribosomes free of EF-Tu. It is likely that EF-Tu might have been released by an earlier wash. To further delineate the localization of Ndk in the ribosomal subunits, the 70 S ribosomes were subjected to conditions that allowed their dissociation into 30 and 50 S components (10Rheinberger H.-J. Geigenmuller U. Wedde M. Nierhaus K.H. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 164: 658-662Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Each component was isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the 30 S subunits harbored NTP synthesizing activity that was completely inhibited by anti-Ndk antibody (Fig. 5 B, lanes 4 and5); 50 S subunits had no Ndk-like activity (Fig.5 B, lanes 7–9). Interestingly, mixing the 30 S and the 50 S ribosomal subunits allowed GTP synthesis, which is inhibited by anti-Ndk antibody but whose specificity for GTP synthesis is eliminated by anti-EF-Tu antibody (Fig. 5 B, lanes 10–12), reminiscent of intact 70 S ribosomes (Fig. 5 B,lanes 1–3). This suggests that although the 30 S ribosomes harbor Ndk, the EF-Tu is associated with the 50 S ribosomes, so that an Ndk·EF-Tu complex is formed on reassociation of the two subunits. This is further confirmed by the fact that when the Ndk-containing 30 S ribosomal subunits are treated with purified EF-Tu, the preparation generates only GTP (Fig. 5 B, lane 13) as contrasted with 30 S subunits alone, which generate all the three NTPs (Fig. 5 B, lane 4). Although the association of Ndk with 30 S ribosomes has never been reported, EF-Tu is known to interact with ribosomal proteins present in the 50 S subunit (14Spirin A.S. Vasiliev V.D. Bio. Cell. 1989; 66: 215-223Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Whereas the role of EF-Tu on peptide chain elongation as well as the role of GTP bound to EF-Tu in promoting the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site of mRNA-programmed ribosomes are well known events (6Kaziro Y. Itoh H. Kozasa T. Nakafufu M. Satoh T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 349-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 9Garrilova L.P. Spirin A.S. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 30: 452-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,13Moore P.B. Science. 1995; 270: 1453-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), much less is known about the source of the GTP or how the availability of GTP to EF-Tu is ensured for continued protein synthesis. Because both Ndk and EF-Tu are shown to exist in the form of a complex to direct the specificity of Ndk to GTP synthesis, an important question was if Ndk plays a critical role in peptide chain elongation as well. P. aeruginosa ribosomes are active in catalyzing the incorporation of 14C-Phe into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material during an in vitro peptide elongation assay (Fig. 6, lane 1) where GTP is an essential component (Fig. 6, lane 2). However, GDP can replace GTP to a large extent in the presence of Ndk and an ATP-generating system (Fig. 6, lane 3), and this stimulation of peptide chain elongation by GDP is completely abolished in presence of anti-Ndk antibodies (Fig. 6, lane 4), suggesting that the conversion of GDP to GTP is mediated by the Ndk·EF-Tu complex. Indeed, addition of GTP to the reaction mixture, where GDP to GTP conversion is inhibited by anti-Ndk antibody, allows substantial restoration of 14C-Phe incorporation into the nascent polypeptide chain, emphasizing the role of Ndk in GTP synthesis for continued protein synthesis (Fig. 6, lane 5). As expected, anti-EF-Tu antibodies can effectively inhibit14C-Phe incorporation in the nascent polypeptide chain in the presence of GDP (Fig. 6, lane 6), and such inhibition cannot be overcome by simple addition of GTP (Fig. 6, lane 7). Thus the role of Ndk appears to be to supply GTP to EF-Tu, and this role is abrogated in the presence of exogenously supplied GTP. In this report, we describe the isolation of P. aeruginosa EF-Tu on the basis of its association with Ndk by Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography, implying that it may exist, at least in part, in association with Ndk on the ribosomes. Western blotting of the proteins isolated from the P. aeruginosaribosomes, using anti-Ndk antibodies, has shown the presence of Ndk in ribosome fractions (data not shown), and in vitro complex formation between Ndk and EF-Tu has been demonstrated in this report (Fig. 2). The implication of this complex formation in the ribosome, where Ndk has been localized in the 30 S subunit and EF-Tu as part of the 50 S subunit (Fig. 5 B), is apparent from the fact that either anti-Ndk or anti-EF-Tu antibodies will inhibit ribosomal GTP synthesis (or change the specificity of GTP synthesis to all NTPs) as well as inhibit peptide chain elongation (Figs. 4, 5, and 6), stongly implying this complex in GTP-mediated peptide chain elongation. The role of EF-Tu in protein synthesis is well established and involves delivery of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site on the ribosome as a ternary complex with GTP (13Moore P.B. Science. 1995; 270: 1453-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Subsequent hydrolysis of GTP to GDP results in release of an EF-Tu·GDP complex, which must be recycled to EF-Tu·GTP in order for EF-Tu to participate in another round of elongation. EF-Tu is a typical G protein in that it has a higher affinity for GDP than for GTP and thus requires a GDP-GTP exchange factor such as EF-Ts to be recycled to the active GTP-bound form. EF-Ts enhances phosphorylation of EF-Tu by a ribosome-associated kinase, and the phosphorylation of EF-Tu abolishes its ability to bind aminoacyl-tRNA (15Alexander C. Bilgin N. Lindschau C. Mesters J.R. Kraal B. Hilgenfeld R. Erdmann V.A. Lippmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14541-14547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). EF-Ts then catalyzes GDP-GTP exchange on EF-Tu such that in presence of EF-Ts, GDP is released from EF-Tu·GDP complex and a EF-Tu·EF-Ts complex is formed. In presence of GTP, EF-Ts is released and EF-Tu·GTP complex is formed for binding with aminoacyl-tRNA for continued peptide chain elongation. It is not known, however, from what source the GTP is acquired for complex formation with EF-Tu. It is generally accepted that GTP cannot be generated directly from a complex of EF-Tu·GDP. The results of our study show clearly that EF-Tu forms a complex with Ndk in vitro and changes its substrate specificity predominantly to GDP (Figs. 2 and 3). Ndk is associated with the 30 S, whereas EF-Tu is associated with the 50 S ribosomal subunits so that it is likely that Ndk and EF-Tu form an association in the 70 S ribosomes under certain conditions. Preliminary results from our laboratory show that when E. coli EF-Tu is treated with GDP, the excess GDP is removed by biospin column chromatography, and the EF-Tu·GDP complex is treated with Ndk and [γ-32P]ATP, radioactive GTP is formed. 2S. Mukhopadhyay, unpublished observations. Inclusion of EF-Ts in this reaction results in only marginal enhancement of GDP release. Although the [32P]GTP synthesis is blocked by anti-Ndk antibody, anti-EF-Tu antibody has no effect, suggesting that [32P]GTP is formed due to release of GDP from EF-Tu by Ndk. Other GDP-binding or nonbinding proteins such as Pra (8Chopade B. Shankar S. Sundin G.W. Mukhopadhyay S. Chakrabarty A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2181-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or bovine serum albumin did not allow GTP synthesis under such conditions, suggesting that Ndk releases GDP specifically from EF-Tu·GDP complex. It is tempting to speculate that part of the EF-Tu·GDP complex, released after the aminoacyl tRNA is transferred to the A site in the ribosome, is acted upon by the ribosome-associated Ndk, resulting in the release of GDP. This GDP is then converted to GTP by Ndk and made available for translational elongation. Some EF-Tu·GDP may additionally be acted upon by EF-Ts outside the ribosome, resulting in EF-Tu·EF-Ts complex formation and GDP release. This GDP can then be accessible to cytoplasmic Ndk. Preliminary experiments on the determination of Ndk levels in the cytoplasm and isolated ribosomes demonstrated variability depending upon the growth stage of the bacteria, suggesting that Ndk is firmly associated with the ribosomes during the log phase of growth but is largely dissociated at the stationary phase, presumably because of the proteolytic cleavage to a 12-kDa form that associates with the membranes (4Shankar S. Kamath S. Chakrabarty A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1777-1781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We are in the process of purifying the EF-Ts from P. aeruginosa to study the relative rate of GDP exchange from EF-Tu·GDP complex by either Ndk or EF-Ts. Elongation factor Tu is now known to be the third protein, besides Pk and Pra, that allows complex formation with Ndk to modulate its NTP synthesizing activity to GTP. Unlike Pk and Pra that are membrane-associated proteins, EF-Tu is primarily cytoplasmic and can therefore form complexes with the 16-kDa Ndk, which is known to be soluble (4Shankar S. Kamath S. Chakrabarty A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1777-1781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is important to emphasize that Pk and Pra can form complexes with only 12-kDa Ndk, which is known to be membrane-associated, and not with the cytoplasmic 16-kDa Ndk (5Sundin G.W. Shankar S. Chugani S.A. Chopade B.A. Kavanaugh-Black A. Chakrabarty A.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 965-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 8Chopade B. Shankar S. Sundin G.W. Mukhopadhyay S. Chakrabarty A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2181-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus the cytoplasmic 16-kDa Ndk not only generates NTPs for cellular metabolic activities, but also provides GTP to specific GTP-requiring proteins such as EF-Tu. It is interesting to note that proteins homologous to EF-Tu and Pk, capable of complexing with Ndk to modulate its NTP synthesizing specificity to GTP, have also been isolated from other microorganisms such as Mycobacterium smegmatis (16Shankar S. Hershberger C.D. Chakrabarty A.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Nucleoside-diphosphate kinase has been shown to be a part of the ribosomes in Dictyostelium and has been inferred to interact with ribosomal proteins or translational elongation factors to modulate protein synthesis (17Sonnemann J. Mutzel R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), although no specific mode of action was proposed. It would be interesting to see if other ribosomal GTP-requiring proteins or G proteins in general might demonstrate complex formation with Ndk to modulate their GTP synthesis as a way to ensure the availability of GTP, as previously suggested (18Bominaar A.A. Molijin A.C. Pestel M. Veron M. Haastert P.J.M.V. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 19Klinker J.F. Seifert R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Spremulli and David L. Miller for kind gifts of E. coliEF-Ts, EF-Tu, and anti-EF-Tu antibodies."

This is associated with reversible inhibition of both glucose-induced insulin secretion and islet glucose oxidation, and these effects are prevented by the inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitorN G-monomethylarginine. IL-1 also induces accumulation of nonesterified arachidonic acid in islets by an NO-dependent mechanism, and one potential explanation for that effect would involve an IL-1-induced enhancement of islet glycolytic flux. We have therefore examined effects of IL-1 on islet glycolytic utilization of glucose and find that culture of islets with IL-1 in medium containing 5.5 mm glucose results in suppression of islet glucose utilization subsequently measured at glucose concentrations between 6 and 18 mm. The IL-1-induced suppression of islet glucose utilization is associated with a decline in islet glucokinase mRNA content, as determined by competitive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and in glucokinase protein synthesis, as determined by immuoprecipitation experiments, and all of these effects are prevented byN G-monomethylarginine. These findings suggest that IL-1 can down-regulate islet glucokinase, which is the primary component of the islet glucose-sensor apparatus, by an NO-dependent mechanism.

This has been attributed to activation of a macrophage phospholipase A2 enzyme that is regulated by an isoform of the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase (13Gross R.W. Rudolph A.E. Wang J.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (180–220 g body weight) were purchased from Sasco (O'Fallon, MO); collagenase from Boehringer Mannheim; tissue culture medium (CMRL-1066), penicillin, streptomycin, Hanks' balanced salt solution, heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and l-glutamine from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY); Pentex bovine serum albumin (fatty acid free, fraction V) from Miles Laboratories (Elkhart, IN); Rodent Chow 5001 from Ralston Purina (St. Louis, MO); d-glucose from the National Bureau of Standards (Washington, D.C.); IL-1β from Cistron Biotechnology (Pine Brook, NJ);N G-monomethyl-l-arginine acetate from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA); and Trans35S-labeled methionine (1117 Ci/mmol) from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Media included KRB (Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer: 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 115 mm NaCl, 24 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2), nKRB (KRB supplemented with 3 mmd-glucose), cCMRL-1066 (CMRL-1066 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine and 1% (w/v) each of penicillin and streptomycin), and Hank's balanced salt solution supplemented with 0.5% penicillin-streptomycin. Islets were isolated aseptically from male Sprague-Dawley rats by a described procedure (29McDaniel M.L. Colca J.R. Kotagal N. Lacy P.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 182-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) involving collagenase digestion of excised, minced pancreas, density gradient isolation, and manual selection under microscopic visualization. Isolated islets were transferred into Falcon Petri dishes containing 2.5 ml of cCMRL-1066, placed under an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2, and cultured at 37 °C with or without IL-1 or other additives. Islets (400 per condition) were placed in Petri dishes (10 × 35 mm); suspended in cCMRL medium (1 ml) containing no additives, IL-1 (5 units/ml) alone, or both IL-1 and NMMA (0.5 mm); and incubated (2–48 h, 37 °C). In some experiments, islets were then removed from the incubation medium, and their secretion of insulin, oxidation of [U-14C]glucose to [14C]O2, or production of [3H]OH from [5-3H]glucose was examined in a subsequent incubation. In such experiments, islets were washed 3 times in nKRB, transferred to siliconized test tubes (12 × 75 mm), and preincubated (30 min, 37 °C) in nKRB (0.2 ml). For insulin secretion experiments, islets were placed in fresh in KRB medium containing various concentrations (3–18 mm) of d-glucose and incubated (30 min, 37 °C, under 95% air, 5% CO2). Aliquots of medium were then removed for measurement of insulin by radioimmunoassay. As in previously described procedures (20Ashcroft S.J.H. Weerasinghe C.C. Bassett J.M. Randle P.J. Biochem. J. 1972; 126: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 25Zawalich W.S. Karl I.C. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetologia. 1979; 16: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), triplicate batches of 10 islets per incubation condition were placed into Microfuge tubes (0.5 ml). Medium was then removed, and radioactive mixture (15 μl) was added. This mixture was prepared by placing [5-3H]glucose (7 μl, Amersham, specific activity 1 mCi/ml) into silanized glass test tubes and concentrating the solution to dryness under nitrogen to evaporate any [3H]OH. The desired final glucose concentrations (3–18 mm) of the radioactive mixtures were achieved by adding various volumes (0–167 μl) of glucose-free KRB containing 1% bovine serum albumin and an appropriate corresponding volume (33–200 μl) of KRB containing 18 mm glucose and 1% bovine serum albumin. The total initial amount of [3H] added to each condition was determined by adding 15 μl of each radioactive mixture directly to scintillation vials containing water (0.5 ml). For blank incubations, radioactive mixture was added, but no islets were present. After all additions were complete, tubes containing the islets were placed in scintillation vials (20 ml) containing water (0.5 ml). The vials were then flushed with 95% air, 5% CO2, capped with Teflon/silicone septum lids, and incubated (1 h, 37 °C, shaking water bath). A Hamilton syringe was then used to introduce 1n HCl (20 μl) into the islet-containing tubes to prevent further catabolism of [5-3H]glucose. Vials containing these tubes were then incubated (24 h, 37 °C) to permit [3H]OH formed by the islets to evaporate and equilibrate with water in the vials. Vials were then cooled to room temperature. The Microfuge tubes were removed and their exterior surfaces rinsed with scintillation fluid (12 ml), which was placed in the vial containing the water in which the Microfuge tube had been immersed. The scintillation vial was then capped with the original septum-lid and mixed. The vials were then equilibrated in the dark, and their3H-content was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Average disintegrations/min in blank tubes was subtracted from experimental measurements, and glucose utilization was calculated as: [{[3H]OH formed (dpm)}/{(specific radioactivity of [5-3H]glucose (dpm/pmol)}]. As in previously described procedures (30McDaniel M.L. King S. Anderson S. Fink J. Lacy P.E. Diabetologia. 1974; 10: 303-308PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hughes J.H. Easom R.A. Wolf B.A. Turk J. McDaniel M.L. Diabetes. 1989; 38 (Second Ed.): 1251-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), islets (30 from each incubation condition) were placed into Beckman polyallomer tubes. After centrifugation (Beckman Microfuge, 5 s, 10,000 × g), supernatant was discarded, and the islets were resuspended in fresh medium (nKRB, 0.2 ml) and preincubated (30 min, 37 °C). Islets were then collected by centrifugation, supernatant discarded, and KRB medium (0.15 ml) containing various concentrations (3–18 mm) of [U-14C]glucose was added. After resuspension of the islets, the polyallomer tubes were placed in scintillation vials containing filter paper covering the bottom of the vial. The vials were then equilibrated with 95% air, 5% CO2, sealed with lids containing gas-tight Teflon/silicone septa, and incubated (2 h, 37 °C, shaking water bath) to permit islet metabolism of [14C]glucose to [14C]O2. Hyamine base (0.2 ml) was then applied to the filter paper in the vials with a Hamilton syringe by penetrating the septa. Islet metabolism of [14C]glucose was then terminated and dissolved H[14C]O3− converted to [14C]O2 by acidifying (0.2 n HCl, 0.2 ml) the medium inside the polyallomer tube. The sealed vials were then incubated (overnight, room temperature, with shaking) to allow [14C]O2 to escape from the incubation solution and react with hyamine in the filter paper. The polyallomer tubes were then removed from the vials and their exterior surfaces rinsed with scintillation fluid (1 ml, ACS, Amersham), which was placed inside the scintillation vial. Additional scintillation fluid (9 ml) was added to each vial, and the 14C-content was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Total 14C- content of the stock [U-14C]glucose solution and blank conversion of [U-14C]glucose to [14C]O2without islets were also determined. After incubation of islets under various conditions, total RNA was isolated after solubilization in guanidinium thiocyanate by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction and isopropyl alcohol precipitation (32Davis L.G. Kuehl L.G. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, CT1994Google Scholar). First strand cDNA was transcribed from total RNA with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (reverse transcriptase, Boehringer Mannheim).

Sun X.H. Kao T.H. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2502-2845Crossref Scopus (1757) Google Scholar), sense 5′-TAGACAAGATGGTGAAGG and antisense 5′-TCCTTGGAGGCCATGTAG (expected fragment length 1006 bp). Amplification steps (30 cycles) included denaturation (95 °C, 1 min), annealing (50 to 60 °C, 1 min), and extension (72 °C, 2 min) and were performed inTaq-polymerase buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 μm of each primer, 200 μm each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP, and 25 units/ml Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR products were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining (32Davis L.G. Kuehl L.G. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, CT1994Google Scholar). Band intensities of PCR products were measured with an IS-1000 Digital Imaging System (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Fluorescence was recorded, and the areas of the peaks were measured. Increased levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA in islets could be detected by RT-PCR after 4 h exposure to IL-1. Levels of islet GAPDH mRNA, as detected by RT-PCR, were constant in control and in IL-1-treated islets for up to 48 h in culture. To examine the potential amplification of genomic DNA in PCR reactions, a control amplification was performed in which the reverse transcriptase step was omitted. In no case was a PCR product of the expected length obtained under these conditions. Competitive RT-PCR (72Gilliland G. Perrin S. Blanchard K. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1990; 87: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar, 73Siebert P.D. Larrick J.W. Nature. 1992; 359: 557-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) was used to determine the abundance of glucokinase mRNA. In this approach, a competitor DNA species is prepared which contains the same primer template sequences as the target cDNA but which contains an intervening sequence which differs from the target in size or in restriction sites so that PCR products from the target and competitor can be distinguished (72Gilliland G. Perrin S. Blanchard K. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1990; 87: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar, 73Siebert P.D. Larrick J.W. Nature. 1992; 359: 557-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Using the competitor as an internal control, amounts of target cDNA can be determined by allowing known amounts of the competitor to compete with the target for primer binding during amplification (72Gilliland G. Perrin S. Blanchard K. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1990; 87: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar, 73Siebert P.D. Larrick J.W. Nature. 1992; 359: 557-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). To prepare the competitor DNA, two composite primers were synthesized (sense 5′-TCACAAGTGGAGAGCGACTCACTGGCATGGCCTTCCG-3′ and antisense 5′-ATTTGTGGTGTGTGGAGTCCTTGGAGGCCATGTAGGC-3′). These primers contain the glucokinase primer sequence (underlined) attached to sequences which hybridize to rat GAPDH cDNA (35Tso J.Y. Sun X.H. Kao T.H. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2502-2845Crossref Scopus (1757) Google Scholar). This pair of primers was then used in PCR reactions with rat GAPDH cDNA as template. In these reactions, the glucokinase primer sequences are incorporated into the PCR product during amplification, and the intervening sequence derives from GAPDH. The resultant PCR product (360 bp in length) was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, isolated with a QIAEX gel extraction kit (QIAGEN), and used as the competitor DNA species in subsequent PCR experiments. In these experiments, the primer pair (sense 5′-TCACAAGTGGAGAGCGACTC-3′ and antisense 5′-ATTTGTGGTGTGTGGAGTCC-3′) was used. These primers hybridize to the glucokinase cDNA sequence and to the competitor DNA sequence. The PCR product derived from the glucokinase cDNA is 450 bp in length, and that from the competitor DNA is 360 bp in length. The products were then analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized with ethidium bromide. Product band intensity was then determined with an IS-1000 Digital Imaging System. The primer set selected for amplification of glucokinase cDNA will not yield a product of the appropriate size with genomic DNA as template. In the rat glucokinase gene (75Magnusson M.A. Andreone T.L. Printz K.L. Koch S. Glanner D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4838-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), the sequence recognized by the sense primer is interrupted by the intron between exons 8 and 9, and the sequence recognized by the antisense primer occurs in exon 10. The amplified sequence of the cDNA therefore includes 11 bp of exon 8, the entirety of exon 9, and a fragment of exon 10. The intervening intron sequences would cause any product amplified from glucokinase genomic DNA to be far larger than that from glucokinase cDNA. In addition, no products of the expected size were observed in control competitive PCR reactions in which the the reverse transcriptase step was omitted. The target glucokinase RT-PCR product was also subcloned and sequenced. The sequence corresponded exactly to the appropriate region of the glucokinase cDNA. With a fixed amount of target and competitor, varying the PCR cycle number from 19 to 31 was found to yield a constant relative intensity of the target and competitor PCR product bands. In subsequent experiments, 28 PCR cycles were used. To examine the relationship between the amount of input DNA and the ratio of the signals for the target and competitor, in one set of experiments the competitor DNA solution was serially diluted, and aliquots of each dilution were added to a reaction mixture containing a fixed amount of glucokinase cDNA. In a second set of experiments, a solution of target glucokinase cDNA was serially diluted, and aliquots of each dilution were added to a reaction mixture containing a fixed amount of competitor DNA. After PCR amplification, products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and product band intensity was determined as above. The ratio of target to competitor product band intensities was found to correspond to the amount of input DNA over a wide range of concentrations. To determine the relative abundance of glucokinase mRNA in islets after incubation under various conditions, total RNA was isolated as described above, and its concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (260 nm). Equal measured amounts of RNA from each incubation condition were then used in competitive RT-PCR reactions with a fixed amount of competitor DNA, and the target to competitor ratio was determined as described above. Medium nitrite content was measured spectrophotometrically (540 nm, Titertek Multiskan MCC/340 microtiter plate reader) after mixing medium (0.1 ml) with Griess reagent (0.1 ml of a solution of 1 part of 1.32% sulfanilamide in 60% acetic acid and 1 part of 0.1% naphthylethylenediamine-HCl) and incubation (10 min, room temperature), as described previously (1Corbett J.A. Wang J.L. Hughes J.A. Wolf B.A. Sweetland M.A. Lancaster J.A. McDaniel M.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 2Corbett J.A. Wang J.L. Sweetland M.A. Lancaster J.L. McDaniel M.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2384-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). To generate an anti-glucokinase antiserum, a fusion protein was prepared which contained the sequence of Schistosoma japonicum glutathioneS-transferase joined to that of human islet glucokinase. The fusion protein was prepared in Escherichia coli transformed with pGEX vector and purified from E. coli homogenates by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose (36Smith D.B. Johnson J.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). The protein was injected subcutaneously on multiple occasions into a female New Zealand White rabbit as an emulsion in Freund's adjuvant. Immunoprecipitation experiments with this antiserum were performed essentially as described previously (37Corbett J.A. Kwon G. Turk J. McDaniel M.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13767-13770Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 38Davis L. Kuehl M. Battey J. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Second Ed. Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, CT1994: 669-679Google Scholar). After incubation under various conditions, islets were washed 3 times in methionine-deficient MEM (9 parts MEM without methionine per 1 part MEM with methionine) and incubated (1 h, 37 °C) in methionine-deficient MEM. [35S]Methionine (100 μCi/ml) was then added, and the islets were incubated (3 h, 37 °C), harvested by centrifugation, washed (3 times, 0.1m PBS), and lysed (1 h, 4 °C) in PBS (1 ml) containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm iodoacetamide. Cell debris was removed (centrifugation, 15 min, 10,000 × g, 4 °C), and the protein content of the supernatants was measured. Aliquots of supernatants from each condition containing identical measured amounts of protein were then diluted with lysis buffer to achieve a final volume of 800 μl. These solutions were then preincubated (2 h) with preimmune serum (10 μl) and precleared by treatment (1 h) with 100 μl of stapylococcal protein A (Immunoprecipitin, Life Technologies, Inc.) and centrifugation (1 min, 4 °C, 200 × g). Anti-glucokinase antiserum (5 μl) was then added to the supernatants, and the mixture was incubated (overnight, 4 °C, with shaking). Staphylococcal protein A (100 μl) was then added, and the mixture was incubated (2 h, 4 °C, with shaking). Staphylococcal protein A-antibody complexes were then isolated by centrifugation and washed four times with PBS (1 ml) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.05% SDS. The immunoprecipitates were then washed twice with 10 mm PBS, reconstituted in SDS sample mixture (30 μl, 0.25m Tris-HCl, 20% β-mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS), and boiled (5 min). After centrifugation, proteins in the supernatants were analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Isolated islets were incubated under conditions described above with no additions (control), with IL-1 (5 units/ml) alone, or with IL-1 plus NMMA (0.5 mm) for 24 h. The islets were then washed three times with MEM without methionine containing 5% fetal bovine serum and, after 1 h of incubation in methionine-deficient medium, were incubated (3 h) with [35S]methionine under conditions described above. The islets were then placed in 15-ml conical test tubes, washed three times with PBS to remove unincorporated [35S]methionine, and homogenized by sonication (Vibracell probe sonicator, 0.5-s bursts at 12% amplitude for 20 s, Sonics & Materials, Inc., Danbury, CT) in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). The homogenates were transferred to 1.5-ml Microfuge tube"
