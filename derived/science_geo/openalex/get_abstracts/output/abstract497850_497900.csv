https://openalex.org/W1982371070,"Type-A γ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABAARs) are the principal mediators of rapid inhibitory synaptic transmission in the human brain. A decline in GABAAR signalling triggers hyperactive neurological disorders such as insomnia, anxiety and epilepsy. Here we present the first three-dimensional structure of a GABAAR, the human β3 homopentamer, at 3 Å resolution. This structure reveals architectural elements unique to eukaryotic Cys-loop receptors, explains the mechanistic consequences of multiple human disease mutations and shows an unexpected structural role for a conserved N-linked glycan. The receptor was crystallized bound to a previously unknown agonist, benzamidine, opening a new avenue for the rational design of GABAAR modulators. The channel region forms a closed gate at the base of the pore, representative of a desensitized state. These results offer new insights into the signalling mechanisms of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels and enhance current understanding of GABAergic neurotransmission."

https://openalex.org/W1986998800,"Genome sequences of nine species of citrus, including oranges, pummelos and mandarins, reveal pathways of domestication and provide resources for breeding. Cultivated citrus are selections from, or hybrids of, wild progenitor species whose identities and contributions to citrus domestication remain controversial. Here we sequence and compare citrus genomes—a high-quality reference haploid clementine genome and mandarin, pummelo, sweet-orange and sour-orange genomes—and show that cultivated types derive from two progenitor species. Although cultivated pummelos represent selections from one progenitor species, Citrus maxima, cultivated mandarins are introgressions of C. maxima into the ancestral mandarin species Citrus reticulata. The most widely cultivated citrus, sweet orange, is the offspring of previously admixed individuals, but sour orange is an F1 hybrid of pure C. maxima and C. reticulata parents, thus implying that wild mandarins were part of the early breeding germplasm. A Chinese wild 'mandarin' diverges substantially from C. reticulata, thus suggesting the possibility of other unrecognized wild citrus species. Understanding citrus phylogeny through genome analysis clarifies taxonomic relationships and facilitates sequence-directed genetic improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2001711642,"Recent evidence suggests that the hippocampus may integrate overlapping memories into relational representations, or schemas, that link indirectly related events and support flexible memory expression. Here we explored the nature of hippocampal neural population representations for multiple features of events and the locations and contexts in which they occurred. Hippocampal networks developed hierarchical organizations of associated elements of related but separately acquired memories within a context, and distinct organizations for memories where the contexts differentiated object-reward associations. These findings reveal neural mechanisms for the development and organization of relational representations."
https://openalex.org/W2085788459,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent mood disorder that is associated with differential prefrontal brain expression patterns. Treatment of MDD includes a variety of biopsychosocial approaches. In medical practice, antidepressant drugs are the most common treatment for depressive episodes, and they are among the most prescribed medications in North America. Although antidepressants are clearly effective, particularly for moderate to severe depressive episodes, there is variability in how individuals respond to antidepressant treatment. Failure to respond has individual, economic and social consequences for patients and their families. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that genes are regulated through the activity of microRNAs (miRNAs), which act as fine-tuners and on-off switches of gene expression. Here we report on complementary studies using postmortem human brain samples, cellular assays and samples from clinical trials of patients with depression and show that miR-1202, a miRNA specific to primates and enriched in the human brain, is differentially expressed in individuals with depression. Additionally, miR-1202 regulates expression of the gene encoding metabotropic glutamate receptor-4 (GRM4) and predicts antidepressant response at baseline. These results suggest that miR-1202 is associated with the pathophysiology of depression and is a potential target for new antidepressant treatments."

https://openalex.org/W2051275283,"Germline-specific Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) protect animal genomes against transposons and are essential for fertility. piRNAs targeting active transposons are amplified by the ping-pong cycle, which couples Piwi endonucleolytic slicing of target RNAs to biogenesis of new piRNAs. Here, we describe the identification of a transient Amplifier complex that mediates biogenesis of secondary piRNAs in insect cells. Amplifier is nucleated by the DEAD box RNA helicase Vasa and contains the two Piwi proteins participating in the ping-pong loop, the Tudor protein Qin/Kumo and antisense piRNA guides. These components assemble on the surface of Vasa’s helicase domain, which functions as an RNA clamp to anchor Amplifier onto transposon transcripts. We show that ATP-dependent RNP remodeling by Vasa facilitates transfer of 5′ sliced piRNA precursors between ping-pong partners, and loss of this activity causes sterility in Drosophila. Our results reveal the molecular basis for the small RNA amplification that confers adaptive immunity against transposons."
https://openalex.org/W2052001124,"The progression of cancers from primary tumors to invasive and metastatic stages accounts for the overwhelming majority of cancer deaths. Understanding the molecular events which promote metastasis is thus critical in the clinic. Translational control is emerging as an important factor in tumorigenesis. The messenger RNA (mRNA) cap-binding protein eIF4E is an oncoprotein that has an important role in cancer initiation and progression. eIF4E must be phosphorylated to promote tumor development. However, the role of eIF4E phosphorylation in metastasis is not known. Here, we show that mice in which eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) cannot be phosphorylated are resistant to lung metastases in a mammary tumor model, and that cells isolated from these mice exhibit impaired invasion. We also demonstrate that transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) induces eIF4E phosphorylation to promote the translation of Snail and Mmp-3 mRNAs, and the induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Furthermore, we describe a new model wherein EMT induced by TGFβ requires translational activation via the non-canonical TGFβ signaling branch acting through eIF4E phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1975993538,"In neurons, most microtubules are not associated with a central microtubule-organizing center (MTOC), and therefore, both the minus and plus-ends of these non-centrosomal microtubules are found throughout the cell. Microtubule plus-ends are well established as dynamic regulatory sites in numerous processes, but the role of microtubule minus-ends has remained poorly understood. Using live-cell imaging, high-resolution microscopy, and laser-based microsurgery techniques, we show that the CAMSAP/Nezha/Patronin family protein CAMSAP2 specifically localizes to non-centrosomal microtubule minus-ends and is required for proper microtubule organization in neurons. CAMSAP2 stabilizes non-centrosomal microtubules and is required for neuronal polarity, axon specification, and dendritic branch formation in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that non-centrosomal microtubules in dendrites are largely generated by γ-Tubulin-dependent nucleation. We propose a two-step model in which γ-Tubulin initiates the formation of non-centrosomal microtubules and CAMSAP2 stabilizes the free microtubule minus-ends in order to control neuronal polarity and development."
https://openalex.org/W2020265449,"Decades after the discovery that ionic zinc is present at high levels in glutamatergic synaptic vesicles, where, when, and how much zinc is released during synaptic activity remains highly controversial. Here we provide a quantitative assessment of zinc dynamics in the synaptic cleft and clarify its role in the regulation of excitatory neurotransmission by combining synaptic recordings from mice deficient for zinc signaling with Monte Carlo simulations. Ambient extracellular zinc levels are too low for tonic occupation of the GluN2A-specific nanomolar zinc sites on NMDA receptors (NMDARs). However, following short trains of physiologically relevant synaptic stimuli, zinc transiently rises in the cleft and selectively inhibits postsynaptic GluN2A-NMDARs, causing changes in synaptic integration and plasticity. Our work establishes the rules of zinc action and reveals that zinc modulation extends beyond hippocampal mossy fibers to excitatory SC-CA1 synapses. By specifically moderating GluN2A-NMDAR signaling, zinc acts as a widespread activity-dependent regulator of neuronal circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2062829534,Neurotransmission depends on presynaptic membrane retrieval and local reformation of synaptic vesicles (SVs) at nerve terminals. The mechanisms involved in these processes are highly controversial with evidence being presented for SV membranes being retrieved exclusively via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) from the plasma membrane or via ultrafast endocytosis independent of clathrin. Here we show that clathrin and its major adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) in addition to the plasma membrane operate at internal endosome-like vacuoles to regenerate SVs but are not essential for membrane retrieval. Depletion of clathrin or conditional knockout of AP-2 result in defects in SV reformation and an accumulation of endosome-like vacuoles generated by clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE) via dynamin 1/3 and endophilin. These results together with theoretical modeling provide a conceptual framework for how synapses capitalize on clathrin-independent membrane retrieval and clathrin/AP-2-mediated SV reformation from endosome-like vacuoles to maintain excitability over a broad range of stimulation frequencies.

https://openalex.org/W2022897687,"Brain circuits endow behavioral flexibility. Here, we study circuits encoding flexible chemotaxis in C. elegans, where the animal navigates up or down NaCl gradients (positive or negative chemotaxis) to reach the salt concentration of previous growth (the set point). The ASER sensory neuron mediates positive and negative chemotaxis by regulating the frequency and direction of reorientation movements in response to salt gradients. Both salt gradients and set point memory are encoded in ASER temporal activity patterns. Distinct temporal activity patterns in interneurons immediately downstream of ASER encode chemotactic movement decisions. Different interneuron combinations regulate positive versus negative chemotaxis. We conclude that sensorimotor pathways are segregated immediately after the primary sensory neuron in the chemotaxis circuit, and sensory representation is rapidly transformed to motor representation at the first interneuron layer. Our study reveals compact encoding of perception, memory, and locomotion in an experience-dependent navigational behavior in C. elegans."
https://openalex.org/W2147706645,"Pleuropulmonary blastoma is a rare childhood malignancy of lung mesenchymal cells that can remain dormant as epithelial cysts or progress to high-grade sarcoma. Predisposing germline loss-of-function DICER1 variants have been described. We sought to uncover additional contributors through whole exome sequencing of 15 tumor/normal pairs, followed by targeted resequencing, miRNA analysis and immunohistochemical analysis of additional tumors. In addition to frequent biallelic loss of TP53 and mutations of NRAS or BRAF in some cases, each case had compound disruption of DICER1: a germline (12 cases) or somatic (3 cases) loss-of-function variant plus a somatic missense mutation in the RNase IIIb domain. 5p-Derived microRNA (miRNA) transcripts retained abnormal precursor miRNA loop sequences normally removed by DICER1. This work both defines a genetic interaction landscape with DICER1 mutation and provides evidence for alteration in miRNA transcripts as a consequence of DICER1 disruption in cancer."

Humans can select and respond to one person’s voice while many others are speaking at the same time. We do this effortlessly, yet no known algorithm can solve this “cocktail party problem” in realistic settings, perhaps because we do not fully understand the relevant computations performed in the brain (Cherry, 1953Cherry E.C.

Other social animals such as birds and rodents demonstrate a similar ability (Bee and Micheyl, 2008Bee M.A. Micheyl C. The cocktail party problem: what is it? How can it be solved? And why should animal behaviorists study it?.J. Comp. Psychol. 2008; 122: 235-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar); for instance, mother mice respond to distinct pup calls when several are calling at once (Geissler and Ehret, 2002Geissler D.B. Ehret G. Time-critical integration of formants for perception of communication calls in mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 9021-9025Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Humans use selective attention, the cognitive process of selecting and responding to a single target stimulus among simultaneous distractors (Desimone and Duncan, 1995Desimone R. Duncan J. Neural mechanisms of selective visual attention.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 193-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (5970) Google Scholar), to solve the cocktail party problem (Ahveninen et al., 2011Ahveninen J. Hämäläinen M. Jääskeläinen I.P. Ahlfors S.P. Huang S. Lin F.-H. Raij T. Sams M. Vasios C.E. Belliveau J.W. Attention-driven auditory cortex short-term plasticity helps segregate relevant sounds from noise.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 4182-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Experiments in visual selective attention have revealed that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) sends top-down “bias signals” to sensory cortex (Miller and Cohen, 2001Miller E.K. Cohen J.D. An integrative theory of prefrontal cortex function.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 167-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (8428) Google Scholar, Moore et al., 2003Moore T. Armstrong K.M. Fallah M. Visuomotor origins of covert spatial attention.Neuron. 2003; 40: 671-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) to select the target stimulus, enhancing its neural representation while suppressing the representation of distractors. Similar mechanisms may be at work in the auditory cortex: electrocorticographic (Mesgarani and Chang, 2012Mesgarani N. Chang E.F. Selective cortical representation of attended speaker in multi-talker speech perception.Nature. 2012; 485: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, Zion Golumbic et al., 2013Zion Golumbic E.M.

Simon J.Z. Emergence of neural encoding of auditory objects while listening to competing speakers.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 11854-11859Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) recordings show that brain activity is dominated by the attended voice. Ultimately, recordings from single units (individual neurons) will be needed to understand the circuit. In addition, many models of visual selection are not obviously applicable to the auditory modality—for instance, the idea that visual attention co-opts the neural mechanisms for shifting gaze (Moore et al., 2003Moore T. Armstrong K.M. Fallah M. Visuomotor origins of covert spatial attention.Neuron. 2003; 40: 671-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Establishing an animal model of auditory selective attention could shed more light on whether the known mechanisms of visual selection are universal or specific to one modality. Nonhuman primates are the traditional model organism for studying complex cognition (Gold and Shadlen, 2007Gold J.I. Shadlen M.N. The neural basis of decision making.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 535-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar) but rodents are also capable of sophisticated decision-making (Raposo et al., 2012Raposo D. Sheppard J.P. Schrater P.R.

The behavioral flexibility of rodents is thought to be mediated by the PFC (Karlsson et al., 2012Karlsson M.P. Tervo D.G.R. Karpova A.Y.

Minimal impairment in a rat model of duration discrimination following excitotoxic lesions of primary auditory and prefrontal cortices.Front Syst Neurosci. 2011; 5: 74Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The medial PFC (mPFC) in particular is critical for task switching (Birrell and Brown, 2000Birrell J.M. Brown V.J. Medial frontal cortex mediates perceptual attentional set shifting in the rat.J.

Rat prefrontal cortical neurons selectively code strategy switches.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 7208-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Rodent mPFC thus appears to maintain a representation of the current task rule, analogous to the rule-encoding neurons observed in primate PFC (Wallis et al., 2001Wallis J.D. Anderson K.C.

Forward frontal fields: phylogeny and fundamental function.Trends Neurosci. 2008; 31: 599-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Frontal areas have been shown to play a role in directing flexible auditory processing in the primary auditory cortex (A1). For example, training ferrets to detect tones at a specific target frequency (Fritz et al., 2003Fritz J. Shamma S. Elhilali M. Klein D. Rapid task-related plasticity of spectrotemporal receptive fields in primary auditory cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1216-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) produces rapid tuning changes in A1 (i.e., the neurons responded more to the target frequency) and modulates functional connectivity between A1 and frontal areas (Fritz et al., 2010Fritz J.B. David S.V. Radtke-Schuller S. Yin P. Shamma S.A. Adaptive, behaviorally gated, persistent encoding of task-relevant auditory information in ferret frontal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1011-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Moreover, when these ferrets switch between different auditory tasks, the observed tuning changes match the demands of each task (Fritz et al., 2005Fritz J.B. Elhilali M. Shamma S.A. Differential dynamic plasticity of A1 receptive fields during multiple spectral tasks.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7623-7635Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These experiments revealed A1 to be surprisingly dynamic; however, subjects were not required to select a target sound in the presence of simultaneous distractors, a critical aspect of the cocktail party problem (McDermott, 2009McDermott J.H. The cocktail party problem.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: R1024-R1027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, Ding and Simon, 2012Ding N. Simon J.Z. Emergence of neural encoding of auditory objects while listening to competing speakers.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 11854-11859Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In this study, we have taken advantage of the relative ease and speed with which rodents can be trained on demanding tasks (Carandini and Churchland, 2013Carandini M. Churchland A.K. Probing perceptual decisions in rodents.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) to develop a novel behavioral task in which rats hear two simultaneous sounds, but select and respond only to one. This requires cognitive flexibility because, depending on which sound the experimenter instructs the subject to select, the same pair of sounds can elicit a different behavioral response (“same stimulus; different response”). The subjects must alternate which sound they select multiple times within each session. We are aware of no purely auditory single-unit studies in any animal with these properties. The analogous ability in vision—to respond to a behaviorally relevant stimulus in the presence of competing distractors—has been referred to as stimulus “selection” (Knudsen, 2007Knudsen E.I. Fundamental components of attention.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 57-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, Reynolds and Chelazzi, 2004Reynolds J.H. Chelazzi L.

Similar visual and cross-modal tasks have been termed set shifting (Stoet and Snyder, 2004Stoet G. Snyder L.H.

Yang Y. Zador A.M. Engaging in an auditory task suppresses responses in auditory cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 646-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Other studies have investigated “response selection”: how decisions are translated into appropriate motor actions, following stimulus selection or even in the absence of an explicit stimulus (Young and Shapiro, 2011Young J.J. Shapiro M.L. The orbitofrontal cortex and response selection.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2011; 1239: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, Turken and Swick, 1999Turken A.U. Swick D. Response selection in the human anterior cingulate cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 920-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We also note a similarity between our task and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task for diagnosing disorders of executive function (Monchi et al., 2001Monchi O. Petrides M. Petre V. Worsley K. Dagher A. Wisconsin Card Sorting revisited: distinct neural circuits participating in different stages of the task identified by event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7733-7741PubMed Google Scholar). We recorded from individual mPFC and A1 neurons in rats performing our task. We found that the prestimulus, anticipatory activity of our recorded neurons in mPFC encoded the selection rule—which sound the subject should select. Surprisingly, we also found this prestimulus effect in a sizable fraction of the neurons we recorded in A1. Disruption of mPFC through electrical microstimulation significantly impaired task performance. Finally, although changes in prestimulus baseline correlated with changes in stimulus-evoked activity in both brain regions, this did not appear to alter tuning properties in a way that would be obviously beneficial for responding to the selected sound. We developed an auditory stimulus selection task for rats, in which the subject was trained to respond to either of two simultaneously presented sounds. The rat initiated each trial (Figure 1A) by holding its nose in the center port of a three-port behavior box—the “hold period.” This triggered speakers on the left and right to play one of the following four equally likely stimulus pairs: LEFT+HIGH, RIGHT+HIGH, LEFT+LOW, or RIGHT+LOW (Figure 1B). Each stimulus pair was a simultaneous combination of (1) a broadband noise burst, played from either the LEFT or RIGHT speaker; and (2) either a HIGH- or LOW-pitched warble (frequency-modulated tone), played from both speakers simultaneously. After the onset of stimulus presentation, the rat could then choose to “go left” (poke its nose in the left port), “go right” (poke its nose in the right port), or “nogo” (not poke either side). Correct pokes into the side ports were rewarded with water; incorrect pokes were penalized with a 2–6 s timeout (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures available online). On each trial, one of the sounds in the stimulus pair (the “target”) indicated the correct response; the other sound (the “distractor”) was uninformative. The behavioral session alternated between “localization” blocks of trials, during which the noise burst was the target, and “pitch discrimination” blocks, during which the warble was the target (Figure 1C). Each block consisted of 80 trials, the first 20 trials of which were reserved to indicate the block change. During these 20 “cue trials,” the rat heard only target sounds without any distractor. The entire training process required approximately 10 weeks. Trained rats performed many trials per session (median, 698). We verified that the rats were performing significantly above 50% in both blocks, which meant that their behavioral response was driven by the target sound, rather than by the distractor or by a combination of target and distractor (Figures S1B, S1C, and Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Our best rats’ typical performance during recording sessions was approximately 85% in both blocks (Figure 2). After each block change, rats rapidly and correctly switched to selecting the new target sound. Performance was typically better on go trials than on nogo trials (Figure S1A). We next asked whether neuronal activity changed according to which target the rats selected. We implanted tetrodes into the brain, targeting A1 and/or the prelimbic region of mPFC, and recorded single-unit action potentials (spikes) during behavior. By analogy with the rule-encoding neurons in the primate PFC, we hypothesized that the firing rates of single mPFC neurons would differ significantly between localization and pitch discrimination blocks. We first confined our analysis to the hold period, the interval before stimulus onset when the rat is holding its nose in the center port and presumably preparing to select the target sound from the imminent stimulus pair. We found that the hold period activity of a majority of mPFC neurons robustly encoded the selection rule on “correct trials,” those trials on which the rat gave the correct response. An example unit (Figure 3A) fired significantly more in the hold period during localization trials than it did during pitch discrimination trials. A different but simultaneously recorded single unit in mPFC (Figure 3B) fired significantly more during pitch discrimination than during localization. In both cases, the effect persisted across the entire session of over 1,300 trials, alternating with each block just as the behavior did. Across our recorded population of mPFC neurons, 63% (76/121) of the neurons individually and significantly encoded the selection rule during the hold period (Figure 3C). Of these, 36 neurons preferred (i.e., fired more during) localization and 40 preferred pitch discrimination; neither preference was significantly more common (binomial test, p > 0.05). Surprisingly, we also found a similar effect in A1 (Figure 4). Although encoding of selection rule was our hypothesized result in mPFC, this was unexpected in A1, especially given the absence of auditory stimulation during the hold period. Across our recorded population, 36% (36/99) of A1 neurons encoded selection rule. As with mPFC, neither population was significantly larger (13 preferring localization, 23 preferring pitch discrimination; binomial test, p > 0.05). Because A1 encodes sounds sparsely (DeWeese et al., 2003DeWeese M.R. Wehr M. Zador A.M. Binary spiking in auditory cortex.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7940-7949PubMed Google Scholar, Hromádka et al., 2008Hromádka T. Deweese M.R. Zador A.M.

Sparse codes for speech predict spectrotemporal receptive fields in the inferior colliculus.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2012; 8: e1002594Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we were not surprised to observe that only some (49/99) of our recorded neurons in A1 significantly responded to our task stimuli (Figures S5A–S5E). Rule encoding was not significantly more widespread in either stimulus-responsive (14/49) or nonresponsive (22/50) neurons (p > 0.05, Fisher’s exact test). This finding is reminiscent of evidence from human imaging that attention affects strongly stimulus-driven regions of auditory cortex less than it affects other, more poorly tuned regions (Petkov et al., 2004Petkov C.I. Kang X. Alho K. Bertrand O. Yund E.W. Woods D.L. Attentional modulation of human auditory cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). These effects were strong: among rule-encoding neurons, the median increase in firing rate during the preferred block was 74.7% in mPFC and 99.7% in A1. These results are unlikely to be due to firing rate drift over the course of the session or spike sorting errors arising from small differences in spike waveform shape between blocks (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). In sum, these results demonstrate widespread and robust encoding of selection rule in the prestimulus activity of both mPFC and A1 neurons. In the previous section, we analyzed only correct trials. We next considered “interference” trials, during which the rat appeared to select the wrong sound. On such trials, the rat heard a “go” distractor (i.e., a sound that should have elicited a go response, had it been presented during the other block) and incorrectly went to the choice port associated with that distractor instead of doing what the target sound indicated. If anticipatory encoding of selection rule is important for successful stimulus selection, then this encoding should have been weaker or even reversed when the rat selected the wrong sound. Indeed, in mPFC, the encoding of selection rule was significantly weakened on interference trials, as compared with correct trials (Figure 3D). In A1, we observed a more extreme effect (Figure 4D): the rule encoding was actually reversed on interference trials (i.e., firing rates were greater during the nonpreferred block on such trials). These observations are consistent with the idea that anticipatory activity predicted which sound the rat would select, even for trials on which the rat appeared to respond to the distractor by going to the wrong choice port. The mPFC regulates cognitive state, but it also encodes body position and plays a role in motor planning (Erlich et al., 2011Erlich J.C. Bialek M. Brody C.D. A cortical substrate for memory-guided orienting in the rat.Neuron. 2011; 72: 330-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, Euston and McNaughton, 2006Euston D.R. McNaughton B.L. Apparent encoding of sequential context in rat medial prefrontal cortex is accounted for by behavioral variability.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 13143-13155Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We analyzed video of the rats and found evidence of preparatory head positioning that differed between blocks (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures), presumably a behavioral strategy that the rat used to prepare for the differing motor actions required in each block (i.e., go left in localization and go right in pitch discrimination). This raised the question of whether neurons were encoding this postural difference, rather than selection rule. We found that, in the vast majority of rule-encoding neurons in both brain regions, the selection rule explained more of the variance in firing rates than did head angle (Figures S2I–S2T and S3I–S3Q). In addition, the rule encoding was largely maintained on a subset of “posture-equalized” trials, selected so that the mean head angle was the same in each block (Figures S2M–S2O and S3M–S3O). Finally, as we discuss below, the long duration of the neural effects we observed further argues against the possibility that changes in posture were the underlying cause. We next asked how soon before the stimulus the rule encoding emerged, and for how long afterward it persisted. For each rule-encoding neuron, we compared across blocks the smoothed firing rates in every 50 ms bin up to 3 s before and after stimulus onset. We thereby determined the largest interval around the hold period during which the neural activity significantly encoded the selection rule. Across the data set, the median intertrial interval was 4.0 s (interquartile range, 2.7–5.3 s) and so this range (± 3 s) overlapped with the previous and/or next trial in many cases. The temporal dynamics of the encoding varied widely across neurons in both regions (Figures 5A and 5B ). For some neurons, rule encoding was strictly confined to the hold period. Other neurons showed significant encoding during all time bins tested: their firing rates were persistently elevated during the preferred block. We found neurons spanning this range of timescales in both brain areas. In A1, the median rule-encoding unit first developed a significant block preference 0.55 s prestimulus; in PFC, the median was 0.625 s prestimulus. Thus, the majority of rule-encoding neurons developed this property well before the rat initiated a trial by center-poking. To examine the population dynamics of rule encoding, we averaged the normalized activity of all rule-encoding neurons during their preferred block. On average, the population activity ramped up gradually before stimulus onset, over a timescale of several seconds, and then fell relatively quickly afterward (Figure 5C; Figures S4B–S4E). The population activity in mPFC was significantly elevated earlier than in A1, consistent with its hypothesized role as the origin of top-down bias signals to sensory cortex (Miller and Cohen, 2001Miller E.K. Cohen J.D. An integrative theory of prefrontal cortex function.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 167-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (8428) Google Scholar). However, we note that the wide range of timescales within both regions, and the fact that only a small fraction of our data set consists of simultaneous recordings from A1 and PFC, complicates a direct comparison between brain regions. Finally, we asked whether the rule encoding reflected an increased firing rate in one block (as compared with the spontaneous rate while the rats were not performing the task), a decreased firing rate in the other block (versus spontaneous), or something else (for instance, a low spontaneous rate, an elevated rate for one block, and an even higher rate for the other block, which might reflect an encoding of task difficulty). Individual neurons exhibited a diversity of effects and we observed single units showing each of these possibilities (Figures 5A and 5B). However, across the population of rule-encoding neurons, the firing rate was significantly higher than spontaneous during the preferred"
https://openalex.org/W1976864358,"The ventromedial striatum (VMS) is a node in circuits underpinning both affect and reinforcement learning. The cellular bases of these functions and especially their potential linkages have been unclear. VMS cholinergic interneurons, however, have been singled out as being related both to affect and to reinforcement-based conditioning, raising the possibility that unique aspects of their signaling could account for these functions. Here we show that VMS tonically active neurons (TANs), including putative cholinergic interneurons, generate unique bidirectional outcome responses during reward-based learning, reporting both positive (reward) and negative (reward omission) outcomes when behavioral change is prompted by switches in reinforcement contingencies. VMS output neurons (SPNs), by contrast, are nearly insensitive to switches in reinforcement contingencies, gradually losing outcome signaling while maintaining responses at trial initiation and goal approach. Thus, TANs and SPNs in the VMS provide distinct signals optimized for different aspects of the learning process."
https://openalex.org/W1969312124,"Targeting HER2 with antibodies or small molecule inhibitors in HER2-positive breast cancer leads to improved survival, but resistance is a common clinical problem. To uncover novel mechanisms of resistance to anti-HER2 therapy in breast cancer, we performed a kinase open reading frame screen to identify genes that rescue HER2-amplified breast cancer cells from HER2 inhibition or suppression. In addition to multiple members of the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) signaling pathways, we discovered that expression of the survival kinases PRKACA and PIM1 rescued cells from anti-HER2 therapy. Furthermore, we observed elevated PRKACA expression in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer samples, indicating that this pathway is activated in breast cancers that are clinically resistant to trastuzumab-containing therapy. We found that neither PRKACA nor PIM1 restored MAPK or PI3K activation after lapatinib or trastuzumab treatment, but rather inactivated the pro-apoptotic protein BAD, the BCl-2-associated death promoter, thereby permitting survival signaling through BCL-XL. Pharmacological blockade of BCL-XL/BCL-2 partially abrogated the rescue effects conferred by PRKACA and PIM1, and sensitized cells to lapatinib treatment. These observations suggest that combined targeting of HER2 and the BCL-XL/BCL-2 anti-apoptotic pathway may increase responses to anti-HER2 therapy in breast cancer and decrease the emergence of resistant disease."
https://openalex.org/W2071679243,"RNA molecules can perform multiple functions, which can be driven by different conformational states; here, the crystal structure of the transfer-RNA-like structure of the turnip yellow mosaic virus is solved, providing insight into the structural basis of RNA multifunctionality. More than forty years ago it was observed that some viral RNA genomes are aminoacylated at their 3′ ends during infection. The sequences that allow this modification are known as tRNA-like structures (TLSs) and they are regarded as prototypes of molecular mimicry and RNA multifunctionality. Here Jeffrey Kieft and colleagues solve the crystal structure of the TLS from turnip yellow mosaic virus. The TLS architecture allows it to fold and unfold readily, in contrast to the more rigid tRNA. And the structure has two faces: one mimics tRNA and the other diverges from tRNA. RNA is arguably the most functionally diverse biological macromolecule. In some cases a single discrete RNA sequence performs multiple roles, and this can be conferred by a complex three-dimensional structure. Such multifunctionality can also be driven or enhanced by the ability of a given RNA to assume different conformational (and therefore functional) states1. Despite its biological importance, a detailed structural understanding of the paradigm of RNA structure-driven multifunctionality is lacking. To address this gap it is useful to study examples from single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses, a prototype being the tRNA-like structure (TLS) found at the 3′ end of the turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV). This TLS not only acts like a tRNA to drive aminoacylation of the viral genomic (g)RNA2,3,4, but also interacts with other structures in the 3′ untranslated region of the gRNA5, contains the promoter for negative-strand synthesis, and influences several infection-critical processes6. TLS RNA can provide a glimpse into the structural basis of RNA multifunctionality and plasticity, but for decades its high-resolution structure has remained elusive. Here we present the crystal structure of the complete TYMV TLS to 2.0 Å resolution. Globally, the RNA adopts a shape that mimics tRNA, but it uses a very different set of intramolecular interactions to achieve this shape. These interactions also allow the TLS to readily switch conformations. In addition, the TLS structure is ‘two faced’: one face closely mimics tRNA and drives aminoacylation, the other face diverges from tRNA and enables additional functionality. The TLS is thus structured to perform several functions and interact with diverse binding partners, and we demonstrate its ability to specifically bind to ribosomes."

We aim to evaluate antihypertensive drugs for an association with PD in hypertensive patients.Hypertensive patients who were free of PD, dementia and stroke were recruited from 2005-2006 using Taiwan National Health Insurance Database. We examined the association between the use of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and the incidence of PD using beta-blockers as the reference. Cox regression model with time-varying medication use was applied.Among 65,001 hypertensive patients with a mean follow-up period of 4.6 years, use of dihydropyridine CCBs, but not non-dihydropyridine CCBs, was associated with a reduced risk of PD (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.57-0.90). Additionally, use of central-acting CCBs, rather than peripheral-acting ones, was associated with a decreased risk of PD (aHR = .69 [55-0.87]. Further decreased association was observed for higher cumulative doses of felodipine (aHR = 0.54 [0.36-0.80]) and amlodipine (aHR = 0.60 [0.45-0.79]). There was no association between the use of ACEIs (aHR = 0.80 [0.64-1.00]) or ARBs (aHR = 0.86 [0.69-1.08]) with PD. A potentially decreased association was only found for higher cumulative use of ACEIs (HR = 0.52 [0.34-0.80]) and ARBs (HR = 0.52 [0.33-0.80]).Our study suggests centrally-acting dihydropyridine CCB use and high cumulative doses of ACEIs and ARBs may associate with a decreased incidence of PD in hypertensive patients. Further long-term follow-up studies are needed to confirm the potential beneficial effects of antihypertensive agents in PD."

We investigated the feasibility of veridically reproducing such patterns with epiretinal prostheses. Multielectrode recordings and visual and electrical stimulation were performed on populations of identified ganglion cells in isolated peripheral primate retina. Electrical stimulation patterns were designed to reproduce recorded waves of activity elicited by a moving visual stimulus. Electrical responses in populations of ON parasol cells exhibited high spatial and temporal precision, matching or exceeding the precision of visual responses measured in the same cells. Computational readout of electrical and visual responses produced similar estimates of stimulus speed, confirming the fidelity of electrical stimulation for biologically relevant visual signals. These results suggest the possibility of producing rich spatiotemporal patterns of retinal activity with a prosthesis and that temporal multiplexing may aid in reproducing the neural code of the retina."
https://openalex.org/W1994330158,"Balancing trophic and apoptotic cues is critical for development and regeneration of neuronal circuits. Here we identify SorCS2 as a proneurotrophin (proNT) receptor, mediating both trophic and apoptotic signals in conjunction with p75(NTR). CNS neurons, but not glia, express SorCS2 as a single-chain protein that is essential for proBDNF-induced growth cone collapse in developing dopaminergic processes. SorCS2- or p75(NTR)-deficient in mice caused reduced dopamine levels and metabolism and dopaminergic hyperinnervation of the frontal cortex. Accordingly, both knockout models displayed a paradoxical behavioral response to amphetamine reminiscent of ADHD. Contrary, in PNS glia, but not in neurons, proteolytic processing produced a two-chain SorCS2 isoform that mediated proNT-dependent Schwann cell apoptosis. Sciatic nerve injury triggered generation of two-chain SorCS2 in p75(NTR)-positive dying Schwann cells, with apoptosis being profoundly attenuated in Sorcs2(-/-) mice. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that two-chain processing of SorCS2 enables neurons and glia to respond differently to proneurotrophins."
https://openalex.org/W2022265958,"Tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis in cancer cells while sparing normal tissues. Despite promising preclinical results, few patients responded to treatment with recombinant TRAIL (Apo2L/Dulanermin) or TRAIL-R2-specific antibodies, such as conatumumab (AMG655). It is unknown whether this was due to intrinsic TRAIL resistance within primary human cancers or insufficient agonistic activity of the TRAIL-receptor (TRAIL-R)-targeting drugs. Fcγ receptors (FcγR)-mediated crosslinking increases the cancer-cell-killing activity of TRAIL-R2-specific antibodies in vivo. We tested this phenomenon using FcγR-expressing immune cells from patients with ovarian cancer. However, even in the presence of high numbers of FcγR-expressing immune cells, as found in ovarian cancer ascites, AMG655-induced apoptosis was not enabled to any significant degree, indicating that this concept may not translate into clinical use. On the basis of these results, we next set out to determine whether AMG655 possibly interferes with apoptosis induction by endogenous TRAIL, which could be expressed by immune cells. To do so, we tested how AMG655 affected apoptosis induction by recombinant TRAIL. This, however, resulted in the surprising discovery of a striking synergy between AMG655 and non-tagged TRAIL (Apo2L/TRAIL) in killing cancer cells. This combination was as effective in killing cancer cells as highly active recombinant isoleucine-zipper-tagged TRAIL (iz-TRAIL). The increased killing efficiency was due to enhanced formation of the TRAIL death-inducing signalling complex, enabled by concomitant binding of Apo2L/TRAIL and AMG655 to TRAIL-R2. The synergy of AMG655 with Apo2L/TRAIL extended to primary ovarian cancer cells and was further enhanced by combination with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib or a second mitochondrial-derived activator of caspases (SMAC) mimetic. Importantly, primary human hepatocytes were not killed by the AMG655-Apo2L/TRAIL combination, also not when further combined with bortezomib or a SMAC mimetic. We therefore propose that clinical-grade non-tagged recombinant forms of TRAIL, such as dulanermin, could be combined with antibodies such as AMG655 to introduce a highly active TRAIL-R2-agonistic therapy into the cancer clinic."
https://openalex.org/W2151154430,"The dual role of the microRNA-29 (miR-29) family in tumor progression and metastasis in solid tumors has been reported. Evidence for the role of miR-29 in tumor malignancy and its prognostic value in overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains conflicting. Mechanistic studies presented herein demonstrated that c-Myc suppressed the expression of miR-29b, promoting soft agar growth and invasion capability in lung cancer cells. Interestingly, the decrease in the expression of miR-29b by c-Myc is responsible for soft agar growth and invasiveness mediated by FHIT loss due to promoter methylation. Among patients, low expression of miR-29b and FHIT was more common in tumors with high c-Myc expression than in tumors with low c-Myc expression. Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression analysis showed that tumors with high c-Myc, low miR-29b and low FHIT expression had shorter OS and RFS periods than their counterparts. In conclusion, the decrease in the expression of miR-29b by c-Myc may be responsible for FHIT loss-mediated tumor aggressiveness and for poor outcome in NSCLC. Therefore, we suggest that restoration of the miR-29b expression using the c-Myc inhibitor might be helpful in suppressing tumor aggressiveness mediated by FHIT loss and consequently improving outcomes in NSCLC patients with tumors with low expression of FHIT."
https://openalex.org/W1990790736,"Iron metabolism is essential for many cellular processes, including oxygen transport, respiration and DNA synthesis, and many cancer cells exhibit dysregulation in iron metabolism. Maintenance of cellular iron homeostasis is regulated by iron regulatory proteins (IRPs), which control the expression of iron-related genes by binding iron-responsive elements (IREs) of target mRNAs. Here, we report that mitochondrial SIRT3 regulates cellular iron metabolism by modulating IRP1 activity. SIRT3 loss increases reactive oxygen species production, leading to elevated IRP1 binding to IREs. As a consequence, IRP1 target genes, such as the transferrin receptor (TfR1), a membrane-associated glycoprotein critical for iron uptake and cell proliferation, are controlled by SIRT3. Importantly, SIRT3 deficiency results in a defect in cellular iron homeostasis. SIRT3 null cells contain high levels of iron and lose iron-dependent TfR1 regulation. Moreover, SIRT3 null mice exhibit higher levels of iron and TfR1 expression in the pancreas. We found that the regulation of iron uptake and TfR1 expression contribute to the tumor-suppressive activity of SIRT3. Indeed, SIRT3 expression is negatively correlated with TfR1 expression in human pancreatic cancers. SIRT3 overexpression decreases TfR1 expression by inhibiting IRP1 and represses proliferation in pancreatic cancer cells. Our data uncover a novel role of SIRT3 in cellular iron metabolism through IRP1 regulation and suggest that SIRT3 functions as a tumor suppressor, in part, by modulating cellular iron metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2071666349,"SNARE-complex assembly mediates synaptic vesicle fusion during neurotransmitter release and requires that the target-SNARE protein syntaxin-1 switches from a closed to an open conformation. Although many SNARE proteins are available per vesicle, only one to three SNARE complexes are minimally needed for a fusion reaction. Here, we use high-resolution measurements of synaptic transmission in the calyx-of-Held synapse from mutant mice in which syntaxin-1 is rendered constitutively open and SNARE-complex assembly is enhanced to examine the relation between SNARE-complex assembly and neurotransmitter release. We show that enhancing SNARE-complex assembly dramatically increases the speed of evoked release, potentiates the Ca2+-affinity of release, and accelerates fusion-pore expansion during individual vesicle fusion events. Our data indicate that the number of assembled SNARE complexes per vesicle during fusion determines the presynaptic release probability and fusion kinetics and suggest a mechanism whereby proteins (Munc13 or RIM) may control presynaptic plasticity by regulating SNARE-complex assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2018299899,"Compelling evidence shows that chemokine C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) drives metastasis in multiple malignancies. Similar to other key cytokines in cancer, CXCL12 exists as several isoforms with distinct biophysical properties that may alter signaling and functional outputs. However, effects of CXCL12 isoforms in cancer remain unknown. CXCL12-α, -β and -γ showed cell-type-specific differences in activating signaling through G protein-dependent pathways in cell-based assays, while CXCL12-γ had greatest effects on recruitment of the adapter protein β-arrestin 2. CXCL12-β and -γ also stimulated endothelial tube formation to a greater extent than CXCL12-α. To investigate the effects of CXCL12 isoforms on tumor growth and metastasis, we used a mouse xenograft model of metastatic human breast cancer combining CXCR4+ breast cancer cells and mammary fibroblasts secreting an isoform of CXCL12. Altough all CXCL12 isoforms produced comparable growth of mammary tumors, CXCL12-γ significantly increased metastasis to bone marrow and other sites. Breast cancer cells originating from tumors with CXCL12-γ fibroblasts upregulated RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand), contributing to bone marrow tropism of metastatic cancer cells. CXCL12-γ was expressed in metastatic tissues in mice, and we also detected CXCL12-γ in malignant pleural effusions from patients with breast cancer. In our mouse model, mammary fibroblasts disseminated to sites of breast cancer metastases, providing another mechanism to increase levels of CXCL12 in metastatic environments. These studies identify CXCL12-γ as a potent pro-metastatic molecule with important implications for cancer biology and effective therapeutic targeting of CXCL12 pathways."

Here, we develop cell line models of acquired resistance to FGFR inhibition by exposure of cell lines harboring FGFR3 gene amplification and translocation to the selective FGFR inhibitor BGJ398 and multitargeted FGFR inhibitor ponatinib. We show that the acquisition of resistance is rapid, reversible and characterized by an epithelial to mesenchymal transition and a switch from dependency on FGFR3 to ERBB family members. Acquired resistance was associated with demonstrable changes in gene expression including increased production of ERBB2/3 ligands, which were sufficient to drive resistance in the setting of FGFR3 dependency but not dependency on other FGFR family members. These data support the concept that activation of ERBB family members is sufficient to bypass dependency on FGFR3 and suggest that concurrent inhibition of these two pathways may be desirable when targeting FGFR3-dependent cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1980492996,"Mounting evidence has shown that the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) has critical roles in cancer cell growth. This has prompted pharmacological companies to develop agents targeting the receptor. Surprisingly, clinical trials using specific IGF-1R antibodies have, however, revealed disappointing results. Further understanding of the role of IGF-1R in cancer cells is therefore necessary for development of efficient therapeutic strategies. Recently, we showed that IGF-1R is sumoylated and translocated into the cell nucleus where it activates gene transcription. Several other studies have confirmed our findings and it has been reported that nuclear IGF-1R (nIGF-1R) has prognostic and predictive impact in cancer. To increase the understanding of IGF-1R in cancer cells, we here present the first study that proposes a pathway by which IGF-1R translocates into the cell nucleus. We could demonstrate that IGF-1R first associates with the dynactin subunit p150(Glued), which transports the receptor to the nuclear pore complex, where it co-localizes with importin-β followed by association with RanBP2. Sumoylation of IGF-1R seems to be required for interaction with RanBP2, which in turn may serve as the SUMO E3 ligase. In the context of sumoylation, we provided evidence that it may favor nIGF-1R accumulation by increasing the stability of the receptor. Taken together, topographic and functional interactions between dynactin, importin-β and RanBP2 are involved in nuclear translocation of IGF-1R. Our results provide new understanding of IGF-1R in cancer, which in turn may contribute to development of new therapeutic strategies."

We used a well-established genetically engineered mouse model (LSL-K-ras(G12D)) of PC to elucidate the role of smoking during initiation and development of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). The 10-week-old floxed mice (K-ras(G12D); Pdx-1cre) and their control unfloxed (LSL-K-ras(G12D)) littermates were exposed to cigarette smoke (total suspended particles: 150 mg/m(3)) for 20 weeks. Smoke exposure significantly accelerated the development of PanIN lesions in the floxed mice, which correlated with tenfold increase in the expression of cytokeratin19. The systemic accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) decreased significantly in floxed mice compared with unfloxed controls (P<0.01) after the smoke exposure with the concurrent increase in the macrophage (P<0.05) and dendritic cell (DCs) (P<0.01) population. Further, smoking-induced inflammation (IFN-γ, CXCL2; P<0.05) was accompanied by enhanced activation of pancreatic stellate cells and elevated levels of serum retinoic acid-binding protein 4, indicating increased bioavailability of retinoic acid which contributes to differentiation of MDSCs to tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and DCs. TAMs predominantly contribute to the increased expression of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (EGFR ligand) in pre-neoplastic lesions in smoke-exposed floxed mice that facilitate acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM). Further, smoke exposure also resulted in partial suppression of the immune system early during PC progression. Overall, the present study provides a novel mechanism of smoking-induced increase in ADM in the presence of constitutively active K-ras mutation."

Animal models of BHD have previously shown deregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Topical use of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin is an effective treatment for the skin tumours (angiofibromas) in tuberous sclerosis complex, which is also characterised by mTOR deregulation. In this study we aimed to determine if topical rapamycin is also an effective treatment for fibrofolliculomas in BHD.We performed a double blinded, randomised, facial left-right controlled trial of topical rapamycin 0.1% versus placebo in 19 BHD patients. Trial duration was 6 months. The primary outcome was cosmetic improvement as measured by doctors and patients. Changes in fibrofolliculoma number and size were also measured, as was occurrence of side effects.No change in cosmetic status of fibrofolliculomas was reported in the majority of cases for the rapamycin treated (79% by doctors, 53% by patients) as well as the placebo treated facial sides (both 74%). No significant differences between rapamycin and placebo treated facial halves were observed (p = 1.000 for doctors opinion, p = 0.344 for patients opinion). No significant difference in fibrofolliculoma number or change in size of the fibrofolliculomas was seen after 6 months. Side effects occurred more often after rapamycin treatment (68% of patients) than after placebo (58% of patients; p = 0.625). A burning sensation, erythema, itching and dryness were most frequently reported.This study provides no evidence that treatment of fibrofolliculomas with topical rapamycin in BHD results in cosmetic improvement.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00928798."

Broccoli sprouts are a source of the Nrf2 activating agentsulforaphane, and short term ingestion of broccoli sprout homogenates (BSH) has been shown to reduce nasal inflammatory responses to oxidant pollutants.Assess the effects of BSH on nasal cytokines, virus replication, and Nrf2-dependent enzyme expression in smokers and nonsmokers.We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing the effects of BSH on serially sampled nasal lavage fluid (NLF) cytokines, viral sequence quantity, and Nrf2-dependent enzyme expression in NLF cells and biopsied epithelium. Healthy young adult smokers and nonsmokers ingested BSH or placebo (alfalfa sprout homogenate) for 4 days, designated Days -1, 0, 1, 2. On Day 0 they received standard vaccine dose of live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) intranasally. Nasal lavage fluids and nasal biopsies were collected serially to assess response to LAIV.In area under curve analyses, post-LAIV IL-6 responses (P = 0.03) and influenza sequences (P = 0.01) were significantly reduced in NLF from BSH-treated smokers, whilequinoneoxidoreductasein NLF cells was significantly increased. In nonsmokers, a similar trend for reduction in virus quantity with BSH did not reach statistical significance.In smokers, short term ingestion of broccoli sprout homogenates appears to significantly reduce some virus-induced markers of inflammation, as well as reducing virus quantity. Nutritional antioxidant interventions have promise as a safe, low-cost strategy for reducing influenza risk among smokers and other at risk populations.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01269723."
https://openalex.org/W2094172312,"Activity-dependent neurotransmitter switching engages genetic programs regulating transmitter synthesis, but the mechanism by which activity is transduced is unknown. We suppressed activity in single neurons in the embryonic spinal cord to determine whether glutamate-gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) switching is cell autonomous. Transmitter respecification did not occur, suggesting that it is homeostatically regulated by the level of activity in surrounding neurons. Graded increase in the number of silenced neurons in cultures led to graded decrease in the number of neurons expressing GABA, supporting non-cell-autonomous transmitter switching. We found that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is expressed in the spinal cord during the period of transmitter respecification and that spike activity causes release of BDNF. Activation of TrkB receptors triggers a signaling cascade involving JNK-mediated activation of cJun that regulates tlx3, a glutamate/GABA selector gene, accounting for calcium-spike BDNF-dependent transmitter switching. Our findings identify a molecular mechanism for activity-dependent respecification of neurotransmitter phenotype in developing spinal neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1967098715,"CYLD is a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme that has a pivotal role in modulating nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways by removing the lysine 63- and linear-linked ubiquitin chain from substrates such as tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and TRAF6. Loss of CYLD activity is associated with tumorigenicity, and levels of CYLD are lost or downregulated in different types of human tumors. In the present study, we found that high CYLD expression was associated with better overall survival and relapse-free neuroblastoma patient outcome, as well as inversely correlated with the stage of neuroblastoma. Retinoic acid-mediated differentiation of neuroblastoma restored CYLD expression and promoted SUMOylation of CYLD. This posttranslational modification inhibited deubiquitinase activity of CYLD against TRAF2 and TRAF6 and facilitated NF-κB signaling. Overexpression of non-SUMOylatable mutant CYLD in neuroblastoma cells reduced retinoic acid-induced NF-κB activation and differentiation of cells, but instead promoted cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2021679793,"Neural circuitry and brain activity depend critically on proper function of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), whose activity must be tightly controlled. We show that the main body of the pore-forming α1 subunit of neuronal L-type VGCCs, Cav1.2, is proteolytically cleaved, resulting in Cav1.2 fragment channels that separate but remain on the plasma membrane. This “midchannel” proteolysis is regulated by channel activity, involves the Ca2+-dependent protease calpain and the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and causes attenuation and biophysical alterations of VGCC currents. Recombinant Cav1.2 fragment channels mimicking the products of midchannel proteolysis do not form active channels on their own but, when properly paired, produce currents with distinct biophysical properties. Midchannel proteolysis increases dramatically with age and can be attenuated with an L-type VGCC blocker in vivo. Midchannel proteolysis represents a novel form of homeostatic negative-feedback processing of VGCCs that could profoundly affect neuronal excitability, neurotransmission, neuroprotection, and calcium signaling in physiological and disease states."
https://openalex.org/W2019216010,"In response to γ-irradiation (IR)-induced DNA damage, activation of cell cycle checkpoints results in cell cycle arrest, allowing time for DNA repair before cell cycle re-entry. Human cells contain G1 and G2 cell cycle checkpoints. While G1 checkpoint is defective in most cancer cells, commonly due to mutations and/or alterations in the key regulators of G1 checkpoint (for example, p53, cyclin D), G2 checkpoint is rarely impaired in cancer cells, which is important for cancer cell survival. G2 checkpoint activation involves activation of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)/ATM- and rad3-related (ATR) signalings, which leads to the inhibition of Cdc2 kinase and subsequent G2/M cell cycle arrest. Previous studies from our laboratory show that G2 checkpoint activation following IR exposure of MCF-7 breast cancer cells is dependent on the activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) signaling. As HER receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which have important roles in cell proliferation and survival, have been shown to activate ERK1/2 signaling in response to various stimuli, we investigated the role of HER RTKs in IR-induced G2/M checkpoint response in breast cancer cells. Results of the present studies indicate that IR exposure resulted in a striking increase in the phosphorylation of HER1, HER2, HER3 and HER4 in MCF-7 cells, indicative of activation of these proteins. Furthermore, specific inhibition of HER2 using an inhibitor, short hairpin RNA and dominant-negative mutant HER2 abolished IR-induced activation of ATM/ATR signaling, phosphorylation of Cdc2-Y15 and subsequent induction of G2/M arrest. Moreover, the inhibition of HER2 also abrogated IR-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In contrast, inhibition of HER1 using specific inhibitors or decreasing expression of HER3 or HER4 using short hairpin RNAs did not block the induction of G2/M arrest following IR. These results suggest an important role of HER2 in the activation of G2/M checkpoint response following IR."
https://openalex.org/W2163663945,"Ovarian cancer is a major cause of cancer deaths, yet there have been few known genetic risk factors identified, the best known of which are disruptions in protein coding sequences (BRCA1 and 2). Recent findings indicate that there are powerful genetic markers of cancer risk outside of these regions, in the noncoding mRNA control regions. To identify additional cancer-associated, functional non-protein-coding sequence germline variants associated with ovarian cancer risk, we captured DNA regions corresponding to all validated human microRNAs and the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of ~6000 cancer-associated genes from 31 ovarian cancer patients. Multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the 3'UTR of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor/FLT1, E2F2 and PCM1 oncogenes were highly enriched in ovarian cancer patients compared with the 1000 Genome Project. Sequenom validation in a case-control study (267 cases and 89 controls) confirmed a novel variant in the PCM1 3'UTR is significantly associated with ovarian cancer (P=0.0086). This work identifies a potential new ovarian cancer locus and further confirms that cancer resequencing efforts should not ignore the study of noncoding regions of cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2032804738,"Misfolded proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are eliminated by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) in eukaryotes. In S. cerevisiae, ER-resident lectins mediate substrate recognition through bipartite signals consisting of an unfolded local structure and the adjacent glycan. Trimming of the glycan is essential for the directional delivery of the substrates. Whether a similar recognition and delivery mechanism exists in mammalian cells is unknown. In this study, we systematically study the function and substrate specificity of known mammalian ER lectins, including EDEM1/2/3, OS-9 and XTP-3B using the recently identified ERAD substrate sonic hedgehog (SHH), a soluble protein carrying a single N-glycan, as well as its nonglycosylated mutant N278A. Efficient ERAD of N278A requires the core processing complex of HRD1, SEL1L and p97, similar to the glycosylated SHH. While EDEM2 was required for ERAD of both glycosylated and non-glycosylated SHHs, EDEM3 was only necessary for glycosylated SHH and EDEM1 was dispensable for both. Degradation of SHH and N278A also required OS-9, but not the related lectin XTP3-B. Robust interaction of both EDEM2 and OS-9 with a non-glycosylated SHH variant indicates that the misfolded polypeptide backbone, rather than a glycan signature, functions as the predominant signal for recognition for ERAD. Notably, SHH-N278A is the first nonglycosylated substrate to require EDEM2 for recognition and targeting for ERAD. EDEM2 also interacts with calnexin and SEL1L, suggesting a potential avenue by which misfolded glycoproteins may be shunted towards SEL1L and ERAD rather than being released into the secretory pathway. Thus, ER lectins participate in the recognition and delivery of misfolded ER substrates differently in mammals, with an underlying mechanism distinct from that of S. cerevisiae."
https://openalex.org/W2080294277,"Natural killer (NK) cell secretory lysosome exocytosis and cytotoxicity are impaired in familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 4 (FHL-4), a disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding the SNARE protein syntaxin 11. We show that syntaxin 11 binds to SNAP23 in NK cells and that this interaction is reduced by FHL-4 truncation and frameshift mutation proteins that delete all or part of the SNARE domain of syntaxin 11. In contrast the FHL-4 mutant proteins bound to the Sec-1/Munc18-like (SM) protein Munc18-2. We demonstrate that the C-terminal cysteine rich region of syntaxin 11, which is deleted in the FHL-4 mutants, is S-acylated. This posttranslational modification is required for the membrane association of syntaxin 11 and for its polarization to the immunological synapse in NK cells conjugated to target cells. Moreover, we show that Munc18-2 is recruited by syntaxin 11 to intracellular membranes in resting NK cells and to the immunological synapse in activated NK cells. This recruitment of Munc18-2 is abolished by deletion of the C-terminal cysteine rich region of syntaxin 11. These results suggest a pivotal role for S-acylation in the function of syntaxin 11 in NK cells."
https://openalex.org/W2150202119,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT5 is an essential mediator of cytokine, growth factor and hormone signaling. While its activity is tightly regulated in normal cells, its constitutive activation directly contributes to oncogenesis and is associated to a number of hematological and solid tumor cancers. We previously showed that deacetylase inhibitors can inhibit STAT5 transcriptional activity. We now investigated whether the dietary chemopreventive agent sulforaphane, known for its activity as deacetylase inhibitor, might also inhibit STAT5 activity and thus could act as a chemopreventive agent in STAT5-associated cancers. We describe here sulforaphane (SFN) as a novel STAT5 inhibitor. We showed that SFN, like the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), can inhibit expression of STAT5 target genes in the B cell line Ba/F3, as well as in its transformed counterpart Ba/F3-1*6 and in the human leukemic cell line K562 both of which express a constitutively active form of STAT5. Similarly to TSA, SFN does not alter STAT5 initial activation by phosphorylation or binding to the promoter of specific target genes, in favor of a downstream transcriptional inhibitory effect. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that, in contrast to TSA however, SFN only partially impaired the recruitment of RNA polymerase II at STAT5 target genes and did not alter histone H3 and H4 acetylation, suggesting an inhibitory mechanism distinct from that of TSA. Altogether, our data revealed that the natural compound sulforaphane can inhibit STAT5 downstream activity, and as such represents an attractive cancer chemoprotective agent targeting the STAT5 signaling pathway."

We calculated spearman rank correlation, logistic regression analysis and Kaplan Meier curves to study associations of adrenal hormones and outcomes.There was a significant correlation between PSI score and total cortisol (r = 0.24, p = 0.001), DHEAS (r = -0.23, p = 0.002), cortisol/DHEA (r = 0.23, p = 0.003), cortisol/DHEAS (r = 0.32, p = <0.0001) and DHEA/DHEAS (r = 0.20, p = 0.009). In age and gender adjusted logistic regression analysis, cortisol (OR:2.8, 95% CI: 1.48-5.28) and DHEA (OR: 2.62,95% CI: 1.28-5.34), but not DHEAS and the different ratios were associated with all-cause mortality. The discriminatory accuracy of cortisol and DHEA in ROC analysis (area under the curve) was 0.74 and 0.61. In Kaplan Meier analysis, patients in the highest deciles of cortisol and DHEA (p = 0.005 and p = 0.015), and to a lesser extent of cortisol/DHEAS ratio (p = 0.081) had a higher risk of death.Cortisol, DHEAS and their ratios correlate with CAP severity, and cortisol and DHEA predict mortality.

https://openalex.org/W2045847742,"Bt crops are able to produce Cry proteins, which were originally present in Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria. Although Bt maize is very efficient against corn borers, Spanish crops are also attacked by the earworm H. armigera, which is less susceptible to Bt maize. Many mechanisms could be involved in this low susceptibility to the toxin, including the insect's metabolic resistance to toxins due to cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. This paper examines the response of last instar H. armigera larvae to feeding on a diet with Bt and non-Bt maize leaves in larval development and in the gene expression of three P450 cytochromes: CYP6AE14, CYP6B2 and CYP9A12. Larvae fed on sublethal amounts of the Bt toxin showed reduced food ingestion and reduced growth and weight, preventing most of them from achieving the critical weight and pupating; additionally, after feeding for one day on the Bt diet the larvae showed a slight increase in juvenile hormone II in the hemolymp. Larvae fed on the non-Bt diet showed the highest CYP6AE14, CYP6B2 and CYP9A12 expression one day after feeding on the non-Bt diet, and just two days later the expression decreased abruptly, a finding probably related to the developmental programme of the last instar. Moreover, although the response of P450 genes to plant allelochemicals and xenobiotics has been related in general to overexpression in the resistant insect, or induction of the genes when feeding takes place, the expression of the three genes studied was suppressed in the larvae feeding on the Bt toxin. The unexpected inhibitory effect of the Cry1Ab toxin in the P450 genes of H. armigera larvae should be thoroughly studied to determine whether this response is somehow related to the low susceptibility of the species to the Bt toxin."
https://openalex.org/W2049727622,"Ischaemum rugosum is a competitive weed in direct-seeded rice systems. Developing integrated weed management strategies that promote the suppression of weeds by crop density, cultivar selection, and nutrition requires better understanding of the extent to which rice interferes with the growth of this weed and how it responds to resource limitation due to rice interference. The growth of I. rugosum was studied when grown with four rice seeding rates (0, 25, 50, and 100 kg ha−1) and four nitrogen (N) rates (0, 50, 100, and 150 kg ha−1). Compared to the weed plants grown alone, weed tiller number was reduced by 63–80%, leaf number by 68–77%, leaf area by 69–77%, leaf biomass by 72–84%, and inflorescence biomass by 81–93% at the rice seeding rates of 25–100 kg ha−1. All these parameters increased with increasing rates of N from 0 to 150 kg ha−1. At weed maturity, I. rugosum plants were 100% taller than rice at 0 kg N ha−1, whereas, with added N, the weeds were only 50% taller than rice. Weed biomass increased by 82–160%, whereas rice biomass increased by 92–229%, with the application of 50–150 kg N ha−1. Added N favored rice biomass production more than it did the weed. Rice interference reduced the height and biomass of I. rugosum, but did not suppress its growth completely. I. rugosum showed the ability to reduce the effects of rice interference by increasing leaf area, leaf weight ratio, and specific leaf area, and by decreasing the root-shoot weight ratio in comparison to the weed plants grown alone. The results suggest that rice crop interference alone may reduce I. rugosum growth but may not provide complete control of this weed. The need for integrated weed management practices to effectively control this weed species is highlighted."
https://openalex.org/W2071172411,"Exploration permits acquisition of the most relevant information during learning. However, the specific information needed, the influences of this information on decision making, and the relevant neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. We modeled distinct information types available during contextual association learning and used model-based fMRI in conjunction with manipulation of exploratory decision making to identify neural activity associated with information-based decisions. We identified hippocampal-prefrontal contributions to advantageous decisions based on immediately available novel information, distinct from striatal contributions to advantageous decisions based on the sum total available (accumulated) information. Furthermore, network-level interactions among these regions during exploratory decision making were related to learning success. These findings link strategic exploration decisions during learning to quantifiable information and advance understanding of adaptive behavior by identifying the distinct and interactive nature of brain-network contributions to decisions based on distinct information types."
https://openalex.org/W2159912899,"Significant left-right (L-R) differences in tumor incidence and disease outcome occur for cancers of paired organs, including the breasts; however, the basis for this laterality is unknown. Here, we show that despite their morphologic symmetry, left versus right mammary glands in wild-type mice have baseline differences in gene expression that are L-R independently regulated during pubertal development, including genes that regulate luminal progenitor cell renewal, luminal cell differentiation, mammary tumorigenesis, tamoxifen sensitivity and chemotherapeutic resistance. In MMTV-cNeu(Tg/Tg) mice, which model HER2/Neu-amplified breast cancer, baseline L-R differences in mammary gene expression are amplified, sustained or inverted in a gene-specific manner and the mammary ductal epithelium undergoes L-R asymmetric growth and patterning. Comparative genomic analysis of mouse L-R mammary gene expression profiles with gene expression profiles of human breast tumors revealed significant linkage between right-sided gene expression and decreased breast cancer patient survival. Collectively, these findings are the first to demonstrate that mammary glands are lateralized organs, and, moreover, that mammary glands have L-R differential susceptibility to HER2/Neu oncogene-mediated effects on ductal epithelial growth and differentiation. We propose that intrinsic molecular laterality may have a role in L-R asymmetric breast tumor incidence and, furthermore, that interplay between the L-R molecular landscape and oncogene activity may contribute to the differential disease progression and patient outcome that are associated with tumor situs."
https://openalex.org/W1968936159,"Re-exposure to either palatable food or to conditioned stimuli associated with food is known to reinstate food-seeking after periods of abstinence. The nucleus accumbens core and shell are important for reinstatement in both food- and drug-seeking paradigms, although their potential differential roles have been difficult to delineate due to methodological differences in paradigms across laboratories. The present studies assessed the effects of temporary inactivation of the core or shell on priming- and cue-induced reinstatement of food-seeking in identically-trained rats. Inactivation of either the nucleus accumbens core (Experiment 1A; N = 10) or medial shell (Experiment 1B; N = 12) blocked priming-induced reinstatement in an equivalent manner. Similarly, inactivation of the core or medial shell (Experiments 2A & 2B; N = 11 each) also blocked cue-induced reinstatement, although there was also a significant treatment day X brain region X drug order interaction. Specifically, rats with core inactivation reinstated lever-pressing on the vehicle injection day regardless of whether that was their first or second test, whereas rats that had medial shell inactivation on the first day did not significantly reinstate lever-pressing on the second day of testing (when they received vehicle). Yohimbine, while a reportedly robust pharmacological stressor, was ineffective at inducing reinstatement in the current stress-induced reinstatement procedure. These data suggest that both the nucleus accumbens core and shell serve important roles in reinstatement of food-seeking in response to priming and cues."

Here, we demonstrate for the first time it functions as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer in contrast to data in other tumors. Breast cancer patients (n>1000) with high KSR1 showed better disease-free and overall survival, results also supported by Oncomine analyses, microarray data (n=2878) and genomic data from paired tumor and cell-free DNA samples revealing loss of heterozygosity. KSR1 expression is associated with high breast cancer 1, early onset (BRCA1), high BRCA1-associated ring domain 1 (BARD1) and checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) levels. Phospho-profiling of major components of the canonical Ras-RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinases pathway showed no significant changes after KSR1 overexpression or silencing. Moreover, KSR1 stably transfected cells formed fewer and smaller size colonies compared to the parental ones, while in vivo mouse model also demonstrated that the growth of xenograft tumors overexpressing KSR1 was inhibited. The tumor suppressive action of KSR1 is BRCA1 dependent shown by 3D-matrigel and soft agar assays. KSR1 stabilizes BRCA1 protein levels by reducing BRCA1 ubiquitination through increasing BARD1 abundance. These data link these proteins in a continuum with clinical relevance and position KSR1 in the major oncoprotein pathways in breast tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2028414785,"Data on neuropsychiatric and behavioral genetics have attracted legal interest, as attorneys explore their use in criminal and civil cases. These developments may assist judges and juries in making difficult judgments—but they bring substantial risk of misinterpretation and misuse. Data on neuropsychiatric and behavioral genetics have attracted legal interest, as attorneys explore their use in criminal and civil cases. These developments may assist judges and juries in making difficult judgments—but they bring substantial risk of misinterpretation and misuse. Advances in understanding genetic predispositions to behavioral and neuropsychiatric syndromes are squarely in the sights of the legal profession. With data suggesting substantial genetic contributions to the risk for criminal behavior (Tuvblad et al., 2011Tuvblad C. Narusyte J. Grann M. Sarnecki J. Lichtenstein P. Behav. Genet. 2011; 41: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), attorneys have begun to explore the potential uses of genetic evidence in their clients’ defense (Denno, 2011Denno D. Mich. State Law Rev. 2011; 2011: 967-1047Google Scholar). In addition, the first signs that genetic data may be of interest to the civil justice system have begun to appear. As is true whenever scientific data are introduced in court, these developments hold potential for assisting judges and juries with some of the difficult judgments that they face—but they also bring a substantial risk of misinterpretation and misuse. In considering current and future uses of behavioral and neuropsychiatric genetic evidence, the unhappy history of genetics in the courtroom cannot be ignored. Even before the structure of DNA was identified and the transmission of genetic information elucidated, courts recognized that behavioral traits could be handed down in families. However, judges’ understanding of genetics typically reflected the science of the day, and the consequences of their reliance on contemporary knowledge were not always salutary. For example, in the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Buck v. Bell (274 U.S. 200, 1927), which upheld Virginia’s involuntary sterilization statute, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, appealing to the popular view that intellectual disability was passed from parent to child and was associated with promiscuity and crime, notoriously declared, “It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind.” Presumptions about the relationship between crime and hereditary intellectual deficiencies appear to have influenced the lower courts as well, with defendants who were viewed as “defective delinquents” often sent to state institutions where they could be confined indefinitely, rather than being sentenced to a fixed term in a correctional facility (Willrich, 1998Willrich M. Law Hist. Rev. 1998; 16: 63-111Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). But the first use of genetic tests in the courts for their presumed relationship to criminal behavior did not arrive until the late 1960s and was based on data purporting to show that the XYY karyotype was linked to violent crime (Denno, 1996Denno D. Legal implications of genetics and crime research.in: Bock G. Goode J. Genetics of Criminal and Antisocial Behaviour. John Wiley & Sons, Oxford1996: 248-264Google Scholar). Derived from a number of studies demonstrating overrepresentation of XYY men in correctional populations, the data were recruited by enterprising defense attorneys to argue that their clients’ violence was driven by genetic factors beyond their control, and thus that they could not be held criminally responsible for their behavior. Courts, however, were skeptical about the validity of data suggesting a causal link between the XYY karyotype and violent behavior and generally declined to admit karyotyping of defendants into evidence. As it turned out, the courts’ skepticism was fully justified—the purported link between XYY and violence has never been generally accepted (Stochholm et al., 2012Stochholm K. Bojesen A. Jensen A.S. Juul S. Gravholt C.H. BMJ Open. 2012; 2: e000650Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Since the mid-1990s, a more sophisticated set of claims based on genetic predispositions to criminal behavior and neuropsychiatric syndromes has made its way into the criminal courts. These arguments have taken two forms. As suggested by the attempts to introduce testimony about a defendant’s XYY karyotype, one potential use for genetic data is to support a claim that the defendant has a neuropsychiatric or behavioral condition that negates criminal liability. Anglo-American law traditionally has excused from criminal responsibility a defendant whose actions were driven by a distorted understanding of the nature or wrongfulness of her behavior (e.g., a delusional belief that she was being threatened by another person) or, in some jurisdictions, an inability to control her behavior. This approach forms the basis for the insanity defense, which all but a handful of American jurisdictions embrace in one form or another. In principle, a defendant could claim that a genetic predisposition to impulsive or criminal behavior rendered her incapable of understanding or controlling her actions, and some legal writers have argued for consideration of this approach (Jones, 2003Jones M. Duke Law J. 2003; 52: 1031-1053PubMed Google Scholar). However, being predisposed to certain kinds of behavior does not necessarily indicate that one is unaware of its wrongfulness or is unable to behave otherwise. Since the threshold for establishing claims of nonresponsibility is quite high, most expert commentators believe that genetic predisposition evidence cannot meet the legal standard for nonculpability (Morse, 2011Morse S.J. Trends Cogn. Sci. 2011; 15: 378-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Hence, rather than introducing genetic evidence during the guilt phase of their trial, defendants who have been convicted may prefer instead to employ genetic evidence to argue for mitigation of their sentences. The usual basis for a claim for mercy in sentencing is that a genetic predisposition makes it harder for the defendant to control his behavior compared with other people, and thus he is not deserving of the most severe punishment for his offense. Such arguments might have particular traction in capital cases, since the death penalty is generally reserved only for the most culpable murderers. Although parties seeking to introduce scientific evidence in court bear the burden of demonstrating its validity, judges tend to be fairly permissive at death penalty hearings—yet another reason that one might expect genetic evidence to appear more commonly in such cases. The best look at the current role of behavioral and neuropsychiatric genetic evidence in the criminal courts confirms this view. Denno, 2011Denno D. Mich. State Law Rev. 2011; 2011: 967-1047Google Scholar, surveying reported cases from 2007–2011, found 33 instances in which the defense sought to admit genetic information in a criminal trial. (Because most criminal cases do not result in written opinions, the reported cases on which she drew were largely cases that reached the appellate stage. Hence, the actual number of cases involving genetic evidence may well be larger.) Her previous survey of cases from 1994–2007 had identified 44 cases in which an attempt was made to introduce genetic evidence, suggesting modest but growing interest in utilizing such data. Denno found genetic evidence was almost always limited to death penalty cases and almost invariably for mitigation. Most cases involved an effort to demonstrate that the defendant had a serious condition that may have created inherent difficulties in controlling behavior and thus did not deserve the death penalty. For the most common of these conditions—substance dependence—genetic evidence had the additional value of suggesting that the behavior was not the defendant’s fault. Other conditions that genetic evidence was introduced to support included a range of serious mental illnesses (including schizophrenia and depression) and intellectual disability, as well as hereditary propensities to engage in violence or other criminal behavior. Additional findings included an increasing willingness on the part of courts to admit genetic arguments, the absence of attempts by the prosecution to turn genetic evidence against defendants (e.g., by suggesting that a genetic predisposition indicates enhanced dangerousness), and uncertainty as to the impact of genetic evidence. Of note, almost all cases involved genetic arguments made on the basis of family history data; use of actual genetic tests in this series was rare. It is clear from other sources, however, that genetic tests for traits presumed to be associated with criminal behavior are also being presented to the courts, although the frequency of attempts to introduce such evidence is unclear. Published reports indicate that such testimony is most often based on findings linking a number of gene variants to criminal behavior (Bernet et al., 2007Bernet W. Vnencak-Jones C.L. Farahany N. Montgomery S.A. J. Forensic Sci. 2007; 52: 1362-1371PubMed Google Scholar, Rigoni et al., 2010Rigoni D. Pellegrini S. Mariotti V. Cozza A. Mechelli A. Ferrara S.D. Pietrini P. Sartori G. Front. Behav. Neurosci. 2010; 4: 160https://doi.org/10.3389/fribeh2010.00160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most discussed example is monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), probably the best-studied gene linked to antisocial behavior. In a study of a Dutch kindred, complete absence of MAOA activity was associated with impulsive, criminal behavior among men (MAOA is carried on the X chromosome) (Brunner et al., 1993Brunner H.G. Nelen M. Breakefield X.O. Ropers H.H. van Oost B.A. Science. 1993; 262: 578-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). A subsequent, influential study by Caspi et al., 2002Caspi A. McClay J. Moffitt T.E. Mill J. Martin J. Craig I.W. Taylor A. Poulton R. Science. 2002; 297: 851-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (3505) Google Scholar of an epidemiologic cohort in New Zealand demonstrated a gene × environment interaction (GxE) between lower activity alleles of MAOA and childhood maltreatment. With multiple confirmatory studies (and some failures to confirm), this finding has generally withstood scrutiny (Baum, 2013Baum M.L. Neuroethics. 2013; 6: 287-306Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and may be among the better-supported GxE findings in behavioral genetics (Duncan et al., 2014Duncan L.E. Pollastri A.R. Smoller J.W. Am. Psychol. 2014; 69: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As with other genetic evidence, MAOA findings have generally been used in murder trials, sometimes to suggest diminished capacity of the defendant to premeditate his criminal behavior, but most often for purposes of mitigation at sentencing. Courts’ responses to attempts to introduce these data have been mixed, with some excluding it on the basis that the science has not been developed sufficiently to establish the validity of the relationship between the genetic findings and the defendant’s behavior. Even when introduced, though, the impact of the evidence has often been less than striking. However, there are three reported cases—one from the U.S. and two from Italy—in which courts appear to have relied on evidence from MAOA and other genes (including DRD4, COMT, and SLC6A4), along with neuroimaging data suggesting impaired brain function, as grounds for mitigation of sentences (Greely, 2011Greely, H. (2011). Another “brain mitigation” criminal sentence from Italy. http://blogs.law.stanford.edu/lawandbiosciences/2011/09/03/another-brain-mitigation-criminal-sentence-from-italy/.Google Scholar, Walker, 2013Walker B. Wash. U. Law Rev. 2013; 90: 1779-1817Google Scholar). Indeed, some experimental data support the likely efficacy of genetic evidence in influencing sentencing decisions. Aspinwall et al., 2012Aspinwall L.G. Brown T.R. Tabery J. Science. 2012; 337: 846-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, surveying a sample of state trial court judges, found that those judges who read a vignette in which a genetic basis was suggested for the defendant’s psychopathy were inclined to give significantly lower sentences than judges who were not told about a genetic basis for the defendant’s condition. However, the absolute differences were modest: a mean sentence of approximately 13 years in the genetic evidence condition compared with nearly 14 years in the control condition. Members of the general public, however, may be less likely to see genetic evidence as mitigating. In a vignette study from our group that was modeled on the MAOA × childhood maltreatment interaction, a representative sample of the U.S. population did not assign lower levels of responsibility or shorter sentences when told that the defendant had a genetic propensity for violence compared with a control group not exposed to genetic evidence (Appelbaum and Scurich, 2014Appelbaum P.S. Scurich N. J. Am. Acad. Psychiatry Law. 2014; 42: 91-100PubMed Google Scholar). Respondents in the genetic evidence group, though, manifested greater fear of the defendant, suggesting some broader cost to defense strategies based on genetic arguments. Use of behavioral genetic data in criminal trials has been subject to criticism from both scientific and legal perspectives. Studies of the relationship of gene variants to criminal behavior have often failed to replicate, calling into question the validity or at least the robustness of the original findings (Duncan et al., 2014Duncan L.E. Pollastri A.R. Smoller J.W. Am. Psychol. 2014; 69: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Even the MAOA × childhood maltreatment interaction is neither a highly sensitive nor specific marker for criminal behavior, making it difficult to apply group data on the impact of genes on behavior to individual cases (Buckholtz and Meyer-Lindenberg, 2013Buckholtz J. Meyer-Lindenberg A. MAOA and the bioprediction of antisocial behavior: science fact and science fiction.in: Singh I. Sinnott-Armstrong W.P. Savulescu J. Bioprediction, Biomarkers, and Bad Behavior: Scientific, Legal, and Ethical Challenges. Oxford University Press, New York2013: 131-152Crossref Google Scholar). A limited number of populations (generally white and of European descent) have been studied, and interactions with other genes and other environmental stimuli are largely unexplored. Hence, expert witnesses who offer testimony regarding a defendant’s genetic makeup and its influence on his behavior may be overstating the certainty of their conclusions. From the legal side have come questions regarding the probative value of genetic evidence for issues of concern to the law. As Morse, 2011Morse S.J. Trends Cogn. Sci. 2011; 15: 378-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar has noted, “A genetic predisposition to criminal conduct does not per se mitigate or excuse. Causation is only relevant if it tends to show the presence of a genuine excusing condition, but it is the latter that does the legal work.” Many defendants experience pressures to commit criminal acts—from peer encouragement to the disinhibiting effect of intoxicating substances—but in general we expect them to resist the urge to act illegally or suffer the consequences. Unless a defendant’s genetic endowment substantially impairs her ability to appreciate the wrongfulness of her conduct or to obey the requirements of the law, genetic influences may simply be one more pressure that she is expected to resist. Finally, from a policy perspective, since there are currently no proven treatments for the genetic conditions that are posited as mitigating in these cases, facilitating an earlier return to society for (noncapital) offenders who are at higher risk of future criminal acts may be a self-defeating approach. Much less attention has been given to possible uses of behavioral and neuropsychiatric evidence in civil proceedings, although one instance was recently reported. In a case involving a claim against a landlord for injuries suffered in a fire, an Alberta court compelled a plaintiff with a family history of Huntington’s disease (HD) to undergo genetic testing for the disorder to determine whether her impairment was related to the fire or to HD (Adacsi v. Amin, 2013 ABCA 315, Ct. App. Alberta). Compelled genetic testing has not previously been reported, but courts can require plaintiffs who place their medical conditions in contention to undergo medical examinations or tests, unless such procedures could endanger their lives or health. That most people with family histories of HD elect not to know whether they carry the mutation for the disorder makes the choice faced by the plaintiff in Adacsi, i.e., have the testing or forego compensation for injuries that may have resulted from the fire, particularly poignant. In addition to helping courts determine the cause of conditions allegedly due to negligence of a defendant in a tort claim, behavioral and neuropsychiatric genetic evidence could be relevant in a number of other circumstances. Employers contesting work-related mental disability claims might, like the defendants in Adacsi, want to compel claimants to undergo genetic testing to prove that an underlying disorder was not responsible for their impairment. Divorcing couples in child-custody disputes, in which court-ordered psychological evaluations are routine, may want to add genetic testing for behavioral traits or neuropsychiatric disorders to the list of procedures that their estranged spouses must undergo to assess their fitness to parent a child. Plaintiffs seeking to establish that a defendant acted recklessly (e.g., in precipitating an auto accident) might attempt to seek data regarding the defendant’s genetic predisposition to impulsive behavior. With increasing utilization of next-generation sequencing in medical settings, and arguments being made for sequencing newborns at birth, adverse parties in civil litigation may not need to compel genetic testing but merely to seek access to existing data. Utilization of genetic tests in civil cases, for the foreseeable future, will be constrained by the limited predictive capacity of most current genetic findings related to behavioral traits and neuropsychiatric disorders. The situation in Adacsi, after all, involving a gene with complete penetrance (albeit variable age of onset), is vanishingly rare. But as predictive algorithms are developed for disorders that involve the interaction of multiple genes, and as more alleles of moderate effect are identified (e.g., ApoE4), we can expect to see more efforts made to introduce genetic evidence in civil cases as well. The courts are in a period of exploration regarding the uses of behavioral and neuropsychiatric genetic evidence, an effort that is likely to continue so long as there are advances in understanding genetic influences on behavior and behavioral disorders. As genetics becomes a more frequent visitor to the courtroom, however, the risk that genetic information will be misinterpreted will be real. At the extreme, we may see judges presuming genetic bases for criminal behavior in the absence of any reliable evidence to that effect (U.S. v. Cossey, 632 F.3d 82, 2d Cir. 2011). More subtly, legal finders of fact, whether judges or juries, may overestimate (or sometimes, underestimate) the conclusions that can be drawn from genetic evidence, thus unfairly distorting the legal process. It will be an ongoing challenge for both legal and genetic experts to monitor the use of genetic data in the courts to ensure that the conclusions drawn validly reflect the science."

However, whether or not the self-renewal program is retained from stem cells or conferred on progenitors by leukemogenic molecules remains unknown. We have addressed the issue in the context of TEL-AML1-associated acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) by profiling a refined program edited from genes essential for self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells and B-cell development. Bioinformatic analysis shows that ALL populations are loosely clustered and close to the normal population that contains stem and primitive progenitor cells. This finding indicates that immunophenotypes do not reflect maturation stages in ALL and that the self-renewal program may be retained from stem cells. Results of assessing ‘first hit’ function of TEL-AML1 in different populations of normal cells demonstrate the molecular model. Therefore, the current study shows a leukemogenic scenario of human ALL in which programs of stem cells are sustained in distinct fractions by leukemogenic mutations."
