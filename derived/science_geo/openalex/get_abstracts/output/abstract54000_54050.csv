https://openalex.org/W1680799029,"Abstract The aerobic oxidation of xanthine by rat liver supernatant was greatly stimulated by the addition of methylene blue or of NAD+: the latter was reduced during the reaction. Storage of the supernatant at -20° brought about an enhancement of the xanthine oxidation rate measured without addition of cofactors. A similar activation was caused by prior incubation at 37° of the unfractionated liver homogenate, or of the supernatant separated after sonic disruption of the homogenate. The same effect was obtained by treatment with solvents, or by prior incubation at 37° of the supernatant in the presence of proteolytic enzymes or under anaerobic conditions. The presence of xanthine accelerated the effect of proteolytic enzymes and of anaerobiosis. Only the changes caused by anaerobiosis could be reversed by incubating the supernatant in air before the assay. The reaction rate was apparently unaffected by these treatments if activity of the enzyme was measured in the presence of methylene blue or of NAD+. The latter, however, was not reduced during the oxidation of xanthine by supernatants stored at -20° if the reaction was run in the presence of oxygen. If the reaction was in anaerobiosis, uric acid and a corresponding amount of NADH were formed by fresh, supernatant, and by supernatants activated at -20° or by prior incubation in anaerobiosis, but not by supernatant activated by trypsin. The hypothesis is formulated that most of the xanthine oxidase of rat liver supernatant is a dehydrogenase (Type D), and may be converted (activated) into an oxidase (Type O)."

The diphosphonates therefore have effects similar to those described for compounds containing the P-O-P bond but are active when administered orally."

https://openalex.org/W1510134239,"The two metal-binding sites of transferrin will form specific complexes with chromium, manganese, and cobalt ions. Each complex binds bicarbonate in a ratio to the metal ion near unity. In addition to characteristic optical absorption bands in the visible region a specific absorption near 295 mµ is observable for all complexes by difference spectrophotometry. Static magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate that each of the metal ions is bound in the trivalent state, with the cobalt in the low spin diamagnetic form. A distinct difference between the two sites is evident by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy when chromium is bound."
https://openalex.org/W1574189811,"Intact nuclear membrane from rat liver was isolated and purified from nuclear lysates by discontinuous gradient centrifugation. Two membrane fractions isolated at the interface density (d) 1.16 to 1.18 and d 1.18 to 1.20 g per cc have been characterized with respect to morphology and chemical and enzymic composition. Structurally, the purified nuclear envelope was composed of both an inner and outer leaflet possessing discrete pore complexes with an average diameter of 700 to 800 A. Each leaflet, which in itself represents a unit membrane, measured approximately 75 A thick. The chemical composition of nuclear membrane isolated at the interface d 1.16 to 1.18 g per cc was protein, 58.8%; lipid, 35.2%; carbohydrate, 2.9%; RNA, 3.1%; DNA, 0.0%. Similar values for membrane isolated at interface d 1.18 to 1.20 g per cc were protein, 62.3%; lipid, 27.7%; carbohydrate, 3.9%; RNA, 6.1%; DNA, 0.0%. Glucosamine was the only amino sugar detected in membrane hydrolysates. The lipid fraction was composed chiefly of phospholipid, cholesterol, and cholesterol esters. Glucose 6-phosphatase, rotenone-insensitive DPNH-cytochrome c reductase, and adenosine triphosphatase were found to be integral components of the nuclear membrane. The specific activities of glucose 6-phosphatase and DPNH-cytochrome c reductase were approximately 50% those found for the same enzymes in the cytoplasmic membrane. This finding strongly suggests that these activities are associated with only one of the leaflets of the nuclear membrane, presumably the outer."
https://openalex.org/W1494381131,"Abstract The occurrence of cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (3',5'-cGMP) as a natural constituent of mammalian tissues was established, and details of a method for its quantitative determination in milligram amounts of liver, kidney, and brain or in microliter samples of urine are presented. In the analytical procedure 3',5'-cGMP partially purified from tissue extracts by thin layer chromatography or in urine samples (not subjected to any purification) was converted to 5'-GMP with the aid of cyclic nucleotide 3',5'-phosphodiesterase and then to GTP by the combined actions of ATPGMP phosphotransferase and pyruvate kinase. An enzymic cycling system composed of succinate thiokinase and pyruvate kinase was then used to generate proportionate concentrations of pyruvate equivalent to several thousand times the guanine nucleotide present. By measuring the pyruvate fluorometrically it was possible to detect 10-13 to 10-14 mole of 3',5'-cGMP in biological samples. Results are presented showing that 3',5'-cGMP excretion rates were constant in dogs during the infusion of hypertonic and hypotonic NaCl solution in spite of the fact that urinary concentrations of the cyclic nucleotide and urine volume varied almost 100-fold. Exogenous 3',5'-cGMP administered intravenously was rapidly cleared by the kidney and recoverable in the urine. Tissue levels of 3',5'-cGMP ranged from 4 x 10-8 mole per kg, wet weight, in rat kidney and liver to 1 to 2 x 10-7 mole per kg in cerebral tissue. Theophylline treatment of animals led to a 2-fold elevation of renal 3',5'-cGMP but produced no measurable alteration of hepatic levels. Glucagon, epinephrine, and alloxan-induced diabetes elevated concentrations of cyclic 3',5'-adenylate (3',5'-cAMP) in liver but had no effect on those of 3',5'-cGMP. Insulin administration (6 min) also had no influence. It was concluded that the formation of 3',5'-cAMP and 3',5'-cGMP is under separate hormonal and metabolic control and that specific enzymes (cyclases) are probably involved in their biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2092845331,"Microelectrophoretic application of norepinephrine or cyclic adenosine monophosphate reduces the discharge frequency of Purkinje cells in the rat cerebellum. In contrast, other nucleotides accelerate the discharge rate of most units. Parenterally administered theophylline, which inhibits the hydrolysis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate enhances the effects of norepinephrine and cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Therefore, norepinephrine may be able to regulate Purkinje cells functionally by metabolic stimulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1569300949,"Abstract Two inactive fragments of staphylococcal nuclease (a protein consisting of 149 residues, devoid of sulfhydryl groups and disulfide bonds) have been prepared; one (nuclease-P(1–126)) contains Residues 1 through 126, and the other (nuclease-P(127–149)) contains Residues 127 through 149. Studies of nuclease-P(1–126), employing circular dichroism, optical rotation, immunodiffusion, and solvent perturbation, reveal a loose and disorganized structure very different from that of nuclease. Nuclease-P(127–149) is also structureless, as determined by measurements of circular dichroism and the fluorescence spectrum of the tryptophan residue. It was shown previously that the cleavage of nuclease by trypsin in the presence of thymidine 3',5'-diphosphate and calcium ions yields nuclease-P(6–149) (Residues 6 through 149), which has full enzymic activity and a conformation similar to that of nuclease. An enzymically active (8 to 10% of the native level) derivative, nuclease-T, composed of two fragments bonded noncovalently, nuclease-T-P(6–48) (Residues 6 to 48) and nuclease-T-P(49, 50–149) (mixture of Residues 49 through 149 and 50 through 149), is subsequently formed. The association of separated nuclease-T-P(6–48) and -P(49, 50–149) regenerates both enzymic activity (of nuclease-T) and a three-dimensional structure similar to that of nuclease. When the fragments are mixed, noncovalent bonding of nuclease-P(1–126) with nuclease-T-P(49, 50–149), but not with nuclease-P(127–149), is indicated by generation of enzymic activity, increase in ellipticity (from 215 through 240 mµ), positive reaction with antinuclease serum, and a shift in the emission maximum of fluorescence of the single tryptophan residue. Trypsin digestion of noncovalently bonded nuclease-P(1–126) and nuclease-T-P(49, 50–149) in the presence of thymidine 3',5'-diphosphate and calcium ions yields nuclease-T and small fragments derived from Residues 1 through 5 and 49 through 126. Thus, nuclease-T-P(49, 50–149) appears to bind only with the nuclease-T-P(6–48) portion of nuclease-P(1–126) (Residues 6 through 48) to form a conformation resembling that of nuclease-T, whereas the other portions of the polypeptide chain of nuclease-P(1–126) protrude from the nuclease-T structure as essentially random coils. We conclude that almost the entire amino acid sequence of nuclease is essential to determine unique folding and that the native conformation of nuclease cannot be formed during synthesis until the polypeptide chain has been extended beyond Residue 126. The results are not consistent with the concept of sequential folding from the NH2 terminus during assembly of the chain."
https://openalex.org/W1578706268,"Abstract The activation of phosphorylase during muscle contraction and in the presence of epinephrine was studied in isolated frog sartorius and rat diaphragm, and in rat gastrocnemius in vivo. In all three tissues, epinephrine-induced conversion of phosphorylase b to a was accompanied by conversion of phosphorylase b kinase to the activated form (as evidenced by increased pH 6.8 to 8.2 activity ratios), and by increased tissue levels of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. In contrast, when glycogenolysis was facilitated by muscle contraction (as induced by electrical stimulation), phosphorylase b to a conversion took place in all three tissues under conditions in which there was no detectable conversion of phosphorylase b kinase to the activated form and no increase in tissue levels of cyclic 3',5'-AMP. It is concluded that the mechanism of activation of phosphorylase by muscle contraction is basically different from that involving adrenergic amines. Activation of the enzyme during muscle contraction is not accompanied by increased cyclic 3',5'-AMP levels nor conversion of phosphorylase kinase to the activated form. The possibility that calcium ion may regulate phosphorylase kinase activity during muscle contraction is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1559514343,"Abstract The aminoacyl transfer RNA binding enzyme has been purified to apparent homogeneity from rabbit reticulocytes. The active protein is a single molecular species. It catalyzes the guanosine triphosphate-dependent binding of phenylalanyl transfer RNA to ribosomes in the presence of polyuridylic acid, has activity as a ribosome and aminoacyl transfer RNA-dependent guanosine triphosphatase, and is required for the synthesis of peptides from aminoacyl transfer RNA. The protein has a molecular weight of 186,000 and an s20,w of 6.7 S. In the presence of dissociating agents (8 m urea or 5 m guanidine-HCl) the protein undergoes dissociation into subunits of molecular weight 62,000. The results indicate that the native protein consists of three, possibly identical, subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1530087558,"Abstract Apoproteins of cytochrome c peroxidase, horseradish peroxidase, and sperm whale myoglobin were recombined with manganese complexes of proto-, hemato-, meso-, and deuteroporphyrins to form manganese porphyrin-protein complexes. These complexes were purified by column chromatography. All the manganese porphyrin-containing cytochrome c peroxidases were crystallized. Light absorption maxima of manganese porphyrins were shifted to longer wave lengths upon binding to these apoproteins. Light absorption maxima of manganese porphyrin-protein complexes and their derivatives were shifted to shorter wave lengths to the extent of 1 to 10 mµ in the order of proto-, hemato-, meso-, and deutero- derivatives. Manganese-porphyrins and their protein complexes exhibited no appreciable electron paramagnetic resonance absorption at -196°. Manganese porphyrin-containing peroxidases reacted with hydroperoxides to form peroxide compounds and catalyzed the peroxidatic oxidation of ferrocytochrome c, ferrocyanide, and ascorbate at reasonable rates. The peroxide compounds of manganese porphyrin-containing horseradish peroxidases were highly stable and appeared to be a manganese (IV) derivative. The peroxide compounds of manganese porphyrin-containing cytochrome c peroxidases were less stable and retained 2 oxidizing equivalents per mole of the enzyme. However, the chemical nature of the compound was not established. Manganese porphyrin-containing myoglobin neither formed peroxide compounds nor exhibited peroxidase activity under comparable conditions. These myoglobin derivatives and their dithionite-reduced compounds did not form complexes with oxygen and carbon monoxide."
https://openalex.org/W1535973026,"Initial rate studies were carried out using solubilized bovine brain hexokinase. Both ATP4− and β,γ-5′-adenylyl methylene diphosphonate are competitive inhibitors of MgATP2− and mixed inhibitors of the sugar substrate, while N-acetylglucosamine, a competitive inhibitor of fructose, is a mixed inhibitor of MgATP2−. These results are consistent with a random Bi Bi mechanism for the brain enzyme. Purine nucleotides, with the exception of ATP, bind at the catalytic site as well as at an allosteric site on the enzyme. ATP and pyrimidine nucleotides bind only at the catalytic site of brain hexokinase. All allosteric effectors were found to be inhibitory. These include: ADP, AMP, GTP, GDP, ITP, IDP, IMP, 3′,5′-cyclic AMP, and 3-phosphoglycerate. The most potent inhibitor of the enzyme appears to be ADP. The hexokinase reaction was reversed using 14C-glucose-6-P, ADP, and elevated levels of Mg2+."

https://openalex.org/W1503567122,"Abstract A DPN+-dependent l-fucose dehydrogenase has been isolated from pork liver and purified over 300-fold by a combination of ammonium sulfate fractionation, diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography, gel filtration on Sephadex G-100, and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The pH optimum for the dehydrogenase was 8.7 and Km values were 2.0 x 10-5 m for DPN+ and 3.2 x 10-4 m for l-fucose. The immediate product of l-fucose oxidation was shown to be l-fuconolactone (probably the 1 → 5 isomer); the lactone was hydrolyzed spontaneously to l-fuconate at the pH of the reaction. The purified enzyme also catalyzed the oxidation of l-galactose (Km 8.0 x 10-3 m), d-arabinose (Km, 2.1 x 10-3 m), and 3-amino-3-deoxy-d-arabinose (Km, 8.0 x 10-3 m); all active sugars have the same hydroxyl group configurations from C-2 to C-4. The 2-, 3-, or 4-epimers of d-arabinose were much less effective substrates for the enzyme (Km g 3 x 10-2 m)."

https://openalex.org/W1657585066,"Abstract Calcium uptake by skeletal muscle microsomes activated by acetyl phosphate is higher in a 120 mM KCl medium than in a 120 mM NaCl medium. In a system containing various proportions of Na+ and K+, to a total concentration of 120 mM, the Ca2+ uptake is progressively lower the higher the proportion of Na+. Calcium uptake by microsomes is maximal in the absence of monovalent cations. Addition of increasing concentrations of either NaCl or KCl lead to a progressive inhibition of Ca2+ uptake, and Na+ is a more effective inhibitor than K+. Among the monovalent cations tested, lithium is most effective in inhibiting Ca2+ uptake. Inhibition of Ca2+ uptake by 120 mM KCl or NaCl was observed in the presence of various concentrations of Trisoxalate. Microsomal acetyl phosphatase activity is Mg2+-dependent. In the presence of 4 mM MgSO4, CaCl2 further activates the acetyl phosphatase. On the other hand, in the absence of Mg2+, Ca2+, up to 0.5 mM, failed to activate the enzyme. NaCl or KCl, at a concentration of 120 mM, inhibit the Mg2+-dependent acetyl phosphatase. Na+ was a more effective inhibitor than K+. The Ca2+-activated acetyl phosphatase is enhanced by either 120 mM KCl or NaCl. Lithium chloride activates the Mg2+-dependent acetyl phosphatase and inhibits the Ca2+-activated enzyme. The Mg2+-dependent ATPase of microsomes is not inhibited by 120 mM KCl or NaCl. However, the Ca2+-activated ATPase is enhanced by these ions. ATP inhibits both microsomal acetyl phosphatase and Ca2+ transport induced by acetyl phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W2117008455,"Enzymes of ketogenesis were measured in homogenates of liver, kidney, brain, intestine, heart, muscle, and three transplantable hepatomas of the rat. Cholesterol synthesis from acetate-2-14C was studied in slices from these tissues. The results show that high levels of β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase are unique to liver and the well differentiated hepatomas, and thus provide a biochemical basis for liver's role as the primary ketogenic organ. The ability to synthesize cholesterol from acetate was similar in liver, intestine, and immature brain, all of which contained adequate β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase to support the observed rates of cholesterogenesis. The failure of the undifferentiated hepatoma 3924A to synthesize acetoacetate or cholesterol from acetate was consistent with its lack of β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase."

https://openalex.org/W1568034777,"Abstract The structures of three polypeptide hormones (glucagon, a 25-residue analogue of adrenocorticotropin, and parathyroid hormone) which contain enough residues to permit organization have been evaluated in aqueous solution by fluorescence and circular dichroism. The effects of pH, temperature, and guanidine on both tyrosyl and tryptophanyl emission have been measured. None of the fluorescence parameters could be interpreted as revealing a structural modification. Glucagon and parathyroid hormone show weak circular dichroic activity near 222 nm, the wave length region of the n → π transition of the peptide bond in the α helix. However, much stronger dichroic activity occurs in all three hormones near 200 nm, the region where the random form of the peptide bond is optically active. Although glucagon appears to be almost completely unorganized in aqueous solution, it is α-helical when crystalline. The structure of this polypeptide of 29 amino acid residues appears to undergo a helix to coil transition between its crystalline and aqueous states."
https://openalex.org/W1510195643,"Abstract Anaerobic oxidation-reduction titrations of fungal laccase with the reducing agents octacyanotungstate(IV), hexacyanoferrate(II), quinol, and ascorbate have been performed by optical and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. With the high potential reducing agent (0.5 volt), octacyanotungstate(IV), 3.7 electron equivalents are required to reduce the Cu2+ (type 1) in the protein and the blue color is found to decrease linearly with the amount of titrant added. No additional reducing equivalents can be taken up by the protein at this oxidation-reduction level. Similar results are obtained with the other reducing agents with regard to the number of electron equivalents necessary to reduce the type 1 Cu2+. EPR measurements during the titrations have confirmed that the type 1 Cu2+ is an electron-accepting site. These measurements have also shown that the non-blue Cu2+ (type 2) behaves as a heterogeneous species with respect to its reducibility by all substrates. No unusual EPR signal appears during the course of the oxidation-reduction titrations of laccase. From these results, it is concluded that the type 1 Cu2+ and two additional electron-accepting sites are reduced in a cooperative manner but the involvement of the type 2 Cu2+ could not be defined. It is suggested on the basis of these results that the most likely candidates for the two additional high potential electron-accepting sites in laccase are the two diamagnetic copper atoms in the molecule and that these copper atoms would have to be present as a Cu2+-Cu2+ pair in the native molecule."

A molecular weight of 125,000 ± 4,000 was determined. In addition to its ability to catalyze the pyridine nucleotide-linked interconversion of pyruvate and lactate, the enzyme exhibits substantial activity for the similar interconversions of α-ketoglutarate and α-hydroxyglutarate, a property not present in other isozymes of lactic dehydrogenase. Pyruvate reduction was strongly inhibited by excess substrate, whereas the α-ketoglutarate saturation curve was essentially hyperbolic."
https://openalex.org/W1561985797,"Abstract The kinetics of NADH, 3-thionicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (TNAD), and oxamate binding to the H4 isoenzyme of lactate dehydrogenase from the pig has been investigated by temperature jump techniques. The dissociation rate constant for TNAD is considerably larger than for NADH, whereas the recombination rate constant is smaller for the oxidized coenzyme than for the reduced molecule. The kinetics of oxamate binding agrees satisfactorily with a simple binding mechanism. The optical rotatory dispersion spectrum of the protein, which indicates α-helical content, is unperturbed by binding of NADH and oxamate, or by changing the pH from 6 to 8. Both the enthalpy and entropy of oxamate binding are strongly pHdependent. The interaction of this inhibitor with the protein cannot be explained simply in terms of an electrostatic attraction. Other effects, primarily entropic, are of large importance. Evidence is presented which indicates that TNAD in solution exists in two conformational forms which are in rapid equilibrium."
https://openalex.org/W1586125361,"Abstract The reaction of staphylococcal nuclease with stoichiometric amounts of 3'-(N-14C-bromoacetyl-p-aminophenylphosphoryl)-deoxythymidine 5'-phosphate, an alkylating reagent that is a derivative of a strong competitive inhibitor, deoxythymidine 3',5'-diphosphate, results in inactivation of enzymatic activity. No reaction occurs in the presence of the competitive inhibitor, or when Ca++, which is required for binding of substrates and inhibitors, is omitted from the reaction mixture. The modified enzyme derivative was readily purified and separated from unreacted enzyme since it did not adsorb to a column containing Sepharose to which the competitive inhibitor, deoxythymidine 3'-p-aminophenylphosphoryl 5'-phosphate, was covalently bound. The radioactivity of this protein derivative was accounted for by N-carboxymethyllysine 48 (36%) N-carboxymethyllysine 49 (40%), and O-carboxymethyltyrosine 115 (15%) in the primary structure of the protein. Only one of these residues is alkylated in a given protein molecule. These residues are presumed to be located in the region of the tertiary structure of the enzyme which affords specific affinity for substrates and inhibitors, but which does not determine the hydrolytic rate constants. Staphylococcal nuclease is also inactivated, stoichiometrically, in the presence of Ca++, by the 14C-bromoacetyl derivative of the poorly hydrolyzed substrate, deoxythymidine 5'-p-aminophenylphosphate. This reagent selectively alkylates tyrosine 85, which is thought to occupy a position near the hydrolytic portion of the active site. The reaction occurs either by alkylation followed by hydrolysis, or by both processes occurring in a concerted fashion, possibly through the initial formation of a phosphorylated enzyme-substrate intermediate. The enzyme derivative modified by alkylation at tyrosine 85 is adsorbed to the specific nucleaseinhibitor Sepharose column, indicating that it possesses residual binding function. The derivative is catalytically active, although its affinity for DNA and synthetic substrates is severely depressed. Reaction of staphylococcal nuclease with the bromoacetyl derivative of deoxythymidine 3'-p-aminophenylphosphate, a weak inhibitor of the enzyme, results in considerable nonspecific and random alkylation. Reaction nevertheless occurs selectively with a residue important for catalysis (lysine 24). Although the amount of this specific reaction is small compared to the total reaction with the protein, as judged by incorporation of 14C, no other single residue appears to be as highly labeled."
https://openalex.org/W1533677441,"Abstract A relatively simplified method is described for preparing 220-mg quantities of highly purified human erythrocuprein, the copper-containing protein of erythrocytes. The isolated protein has been characterized and found to be similar to previously studied material except that it contains no tyrosine and no hexose and has 7 half-cystine residues per molecule as compared to 5 and 11 residues for two other preparations. The amino acid composition, the copper content (0.38%), the velocity sedimentation and diffusion data, and the results of sedimentation equilibrium experiments all indicate a molecular weight near 33,600. Purified erythrocupreins made by slightly different procedures show variations in extinction coefficients at the 265 mµ and 675 mµ absorption maxima. Erythrocuprein generally exhibits some degree of electrophoretic heterogeneity when examined in low ionic strength buffers. The more electronegative of these two variants could be generated from the other during gel filtration on Sephadex G-75. The nature of this transition has not been elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W1553120614,"Abstract 1. Ca++ accumulation was shown to take place at pH 7.0 in submitochondrial particles. The particles were prepared from bovine heart mitochondria either by digitonin treatment or by sonic oscillation followed by osmotic shock and sedimentation at 26,000 x g. Both succinate and ATP (or ADP) were required for Ca++ accumulation. Carbonylcyanide ptrifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone abolished the process, whereas rutamycin had no effect. 2. Under the same conditions, oxidation of DPNH in the presence of ATP was relatively ineffective in supporting Ca++ accumulation. In fact, DPNH or DPN inhibited significantly Ca++ accumulation that occurred during succinate oxidation. The inhibition by DPN was counteracted by rotenone, indicating that electron flow at the first site is required for the inhibition of Ca++ accumulation. 3. Oxidation of DPNH, generated with ethanol, alcohol dehydrogenase, and aldehyde dehydrogenase, gave rise to significant Ca++ accumulation when the reaction was carried out at pH 7.5 instead of pH 7.0. Oxidation of ascorbate in the presence of phenazine methosulfate and ATP supported Ca++ accumulation at pH 7.0, although somewhat less effectively than succinate, but considerably better than DPNH oxidation. All these processes of Ca++ accumulation were inhibited by addition of uncouplers. 4. Particles that had accumulated Ca++ released OH- when lysed with 0.03% Lubrol. The OH-:Ca++ ratio was close to unity over a wide range of Ca++ accumulated in the absence or presence of phosphate in the medium."

https://openalex.org/W1488217721,"Abstract An enzyme catalyzing oxidative decarboxylation of branched short chain α-keto acids to produce the corresponding acyl coenzyme A esters has been detected in and enriched 40-fold from the cell-free extracts of Bacillus subtilis. Thus the α-keto acid of l-isoleucine, l-α-keto-β-methylvalerate, is transformed to CO2 and α-methylbutyryl coenzyme A. Coenzyme A and NAD are required for this decarboxylation. NADP, however, is inactive to the system. Thiamine pyrophosphate does not increase the enzyme activity as much as do coenzyme A and NAD. The name α-ketoisovalerate dehydrogenase is proposed for this new enzyme since α-ketoisovalerate is found to be the best substrate among the three α-keto acids, l-α-keto-β-methylvalerate, α-ketoisovalerate, and α-ketoisocaproate which are related to l-isoleucine, l-valine, and l-leucine. The optimum pH for enzyme activity lies around 7.0. The Km for coenzyme A is 0.11 mm, whereas the Km for l-α-keto-β-methylvalerate is 1.66 mm. The enzyme is stereospecific to the l isomer of α-keto-β-methylvalerate and does not use the d isomer. Coenzyme A and NAD required for the oxidative decarboxylation can be replaced with potassium ferricyanide but the activity is much less. Sulfhydryl reactants inhibit the activity of α-ketoisovalerate dehydrogenase indicating that it includes the sulfhydryl group as an essential portion for the enzyme activity. Lack of incorporation of 14CO2 into the carboxyl carbon of α-ketoisovalerate suggests that an intermediary complex of thiamine pyrophosphate with the α-keto acid substrate rather than its decarboxylated product, the corresponding aldehyde, is involved in this oxidative decarboxylation. The enzyme is clearly distinguishable from the pyruvate dehydrogenase of B. subtilis which is inactive on the branched short chain α-keto acids, and from the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase which is far more unstable than the enzyme and, while detectable in crude extracts, cannot be detected in any of the purified preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1498072464,"Abstract The structural requirements for the binding of purines to adenine phosphoribosyltransferase from monkey liver were explored by the determination of the Ki values for 67 purines and purine analogues. Adenine was bound 40 times better than the most effectively bound analogues. Substitutions on the 6-amino group of adenine decreased binding to varying degrees. The hydroxylamino- and hydrazinopurines bound well; the binding of alkylaminopurines was moderately good only for small alkyl groups. With the exception of purine-6-aldoxime, purine, and 6-methylpurine, other 6-substituted purines showed Ki values g10-3 m. All 2-substituted derivatives of adenine tested were poorly bound, except 2-fluoroadenine. Ring nitrogen methylation of adenine markedly reduced binding. Adenine derivatives, substituted in position 8 with methyl, mercapto, or m-nitrophenyl, were effectively bound. Although poorly bound, 2,6-diaminopurine and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide reacted at rates which indicated a high maximal velocity. Conversely, 4-aminopyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine was effectively bound but reacted slowly. Experiments with radioactive 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide are consistent with earlier work which suggested that this substrate is converted to the nucleotide level by adenine phosphoribosyltransferase but not by the corresponding hypoxanthine enzyme. The kinetics of the magnesium activation of AMP synthesis was analogous to those previously reported for human hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase. Although the apparent affinity (Km value = 0.037 mm) of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase for 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate was an order of magnitude greater than that of the human hypoxanthine enzyme, similar values for the dissociation constant of the dimagnesium salt of 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (10-3 m) were estimated from the data obtained with both enzymes. This is consistent with the hypothesis that magnesium ions activate both these enzymatic reactions by forming a complex with the substrate, 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate. The adenine phosphoribosyltransfer activity of the monkey liver preparation was not decreased by sulfhydryl or serine modifiers, nor was it activated by sulfhydryl reagents; the residual phosphoribosyltransfer activity toward hypoxanthine was also insensitive to p-chloromercuribenzoate and dithiothreitol."
https://openalex.org/W1484944091,Abstract Transport of l-proline was studied in rabbit renal tubule segments prepared by collagenase digestion. A distinct two-limbed curve found when studying the effects of substrate concentration on transport velocity indicated the presence of at least two transport systems for proline. These systems could not be distinguished by their response to metabolic inhibitors or by changes in medium sodium concentration. The use of alanine and glycine as competitive inhibitors allowed the separation and identification of three kinetically distinct transport systems for proline. The transport system shared by the imino acids and glycine was shown to have a much greater affinity and a much smaller capacity for proline than for glycine. The relevance of this analysis to the investigation of human proline transport mutants is discussed.
https://openalex.org/W1525489834,"Abstract The recombination of apocytochrome c peroxidase with etioheme and protoheme alkyl esters (from dimethyl to dipentyl esters) was studied. Although these unnatural hemes, containing modified side chains at positions 6 and 7 of the porphyrin ring, were insoluble in aqueous alkaline solution, they recombined with the apoenzyme in 10 to 25% acetone solution. The heme-protein complexes were further purified by diethylaminoethyl cellulose column chromatography. The light absorption spectra of these synthetic enzymes and their reactivities with hydrogen peroxide, cyanide, fluoride, and azide were similar to those of the native enzyme. The enzymic activity of these synthetic enzymes was, however, less than 1% of that of the original enzyme when ferrocytochrome c was used as a substrate. On the other hand, the peroxidatic oxidation of ferrocyanide by dimethyl protoheme-containing enzyme was about 40% of that of the native enzyme. This enzymic activity was decreased to 2% by the elongation of these side chains to the dipentyl ester. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of the synthetic enzymes were found to be mixtures of high and low spin compounds at -196°. On addition of a stoichiometric amount of hydrogen peroxide, the synthetic enzymes were converted to stable peroxide intermediates (Complex ES) giving an intense free radical signal. On the basis of these observations, the importance of the side chains at positions 6 and 7 of the porphyrin ring was discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1567860959,"Conditions are described for optimal conversion of the glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase of muscle and yeast by oxidation with o-iodosobenzoate to a highly active acylphosphatase which can be crystallized. One mole of oxidant is required per essential sulfhydryl group. Measurements of —SH groups that disappear suggest that the process may possibly be more complex than simple formation of a disulfide bond at each active center. The process is reversible on treatment with —SH compounds. The same reversible conversion is brought about by treatment with limited amounts of iodine. However, small amounts of additional iodine lead to inactivation of the acylphosphatase generated by either iodine or o-iodosobenzoate and concomitantly to the irreversible loss of most of the dehydrogenase function. Because there is no loss of —SH groups during this process, it appears that another iodine-sensitive group on the protein is required for both the acylphosphatase and dehydrogenase activity. The inactivation of the acylphosphatase is also observed with low concentrations of N-bromosuccinimide."
https://openalex.org/W1497445176,"Abstract A method for the preparation of highly purified deoxythymidine diphosphate-d-glucose oxidoreductase is described. The purified enzyme gives a single band on disc gel electrophoresis, has a molecular weight of 78,000, and contains 1 mole of bound DPN per mole of enzyme. Spectral evidence is presented that is in accord with the formation of bound DPNH in the course of the reaction. The increase in fluorescence of the enzyme after substrate addition is inhibited by prior incubation with product and seems to represent a change in enzyme conformation rather than DPN reduction. DPN analogues with a modified pyridine ring are bound to the enzyme, but yield inactive enzyme, whereas, deamino-DPN and other analogues with a hypoxanthine ring do not bind tightly to the enzyme. Thus the tight binding of DPN is due in large part to the adenine portion of DPN."
https://openalex.org/W1592798976,"Abstract Staphylococcal nuclease, consisting of a polypeptide chain of 149 amino acid residues devoid of cysteine and disulfide binds, is highly susceptible to digestion by a variety of proteases. In the presence of deoxythymidine 3',5'-diphosphate and calcium ions, marked stability is acquired to digestion by trypsin, subtilisin, α-chymotrypsin, and thermolysin. Nuclease-T, the enzymically active product of trypsin digestion in the presence of ligands, which consists of two noncovalently associated chains (residues 6 to 48 and 49 and 50 to 149), is also resistant to digestion by proteases when ligands are present. These observations indicate the very close similarity of the tertiary structures of nuclease and nuclease T."

https://openalex.org/W1675336591,"Abstract Inosinic acid dehydrogenase was prepared from a derepressed mutant of Escherichia coli. Although the reaction catalyzed formally resembles those catalyzed by chicken liver xanthine dehydrogenase and related enzymes, this enzyme is devoid of any flavin, iron complex, or molybdenum component, and the kinetics indicate necessity for concomitant binding of substrate and DPN. The enzyme is absolutely dependent on K+ or NH4+, which are competitive with the inhibitor Mg++. A series of purine nucleotides inhibits competitively with substrate with no evidence of cooperative interactions. The enzyme is quite unstable and can be separated into several distinct but enzymatically equivalent fractions by centrifugation or electrophoresis."

https://openalex.org/W1502165008,"Abstract Hydrolysis of crab d(A-T)n and biosynthetic (dA)n·(dT)n by micrococcal nuclease was measured by titrimetric and spectrophotometric methods, and the ratio of dinucleotides to mononucleotides was determined at the midpoint and at the end point of the reaction. Hydrolysis of crab d(A-T)n shows similar kinetics when measured by both methods. With (dA)n·(dT)n the spectrophotometric method shows a lag period followed by a rapid increase in hyperchromicity. This is interpreted as evidence for the maintenance of ordered structure during early stages of the reaction. Kinetic measurements and product analysis lead to the following conclusions: (a) an exonucleolytic mechanism of action begins during early stages of the reaction; (b) it is more pronounced with (dA)n·(dT)n than with crab d(A-T)n; and (c) it is maximal at moderate ionic strength with (dA)n·(dT)n as substrate; (d) at low ionic strength (pH-stat), exonucleolysis occurs mainly on the dA strand of (dA)n·(dT)n."
https://openalex.org/W1635747001,"Abstract A polar fatty acid has been observed as a component of an ornithine-containing lipid of Thiobacillus thiooxidans. A comparison of thin layer chromatographic mobilities of reference compounds to those of the natural acid and its derivatives suggested that the acid was a 2-hydroxy fatty acid. The presence of a cyclopropane function in the acid was indicated by 14C-labeling experiments and infrared spectroscopy. Mass spectrometry of the methyl ester and the acetylated methyl ester of the natural acid provided a molecular weight for the acid. Equivalent chain lengths were determined for the natural acid, the acid obtained by oxidative decarboxylation of the natural acid with permanganate, and the acids derived through reductive ring cleavage of the cyclopropane group in the ester of the oxidatively decarboxylated natural acid. The mass spectral data, the equivalent chain length determinations, and the permanganate oxidation study clearly indicated that the acid possessed an 18-carbon chain with a methylene bridge and a 2-hydroxyl function. The equivalent chain length determinations further suggested that the cyclopropane group had the cis configuration. Mass spectrographic analysis of the branched chain esters obtained by reductive cleavage of the ester which was in turn derived through oxidative decarboxylation of the natural acid allowed the assignment of the 11,12 position for the cyclopropane group. Based on these data, the polar acid is proposed to be cis-11,12-methylene-2-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid."

https://openalex.org/W1551918468,"The rotational characteristics of polypeptides containing a tryptophanyl residue have been evaluated by polarization of fluorescence measurements in concentrated glycerol solutions. A curve has been obtained showing the dependence of relaxation time on chain size based on the behavior of two series of peptides, i.e. Glyx−Trp−Glyy and adrenocorticotropic hormone and some of its fragments. If these molecules are structureless polypeptides then it can be ascertained, from the relaxation times of molecules with unknown structures, whether the indole group possesses unrestricted or restricted rotational freedom. In the latter case, one can conclude that there exist some elements of structure in the molecule. Several hormones and polypeptides (gastrin, glucagon, parathyroid hormone, and mellitin) and some of their fragments have been evaluated for tertiary interactions by this procedure."

https://openalex.org/W1529409617,Progesterone is inactivated in female rat liver by reduction of the A ring by the delta-4-5-alpha-reductase and the 3alpha-hydroxy steroid oxidoreductase enzymes. Estradiol has a hydrogen that readily reduces progesterones A ring by transfering its hydrogen. The donated H was made radioactive and the amount of radioactive inactivated progesterone found after radioactive estradiol was added was measured. The exact carbon atom (C20 ketogroup) to be reduced was also labelled radioactively. Estradiol also transfered its hydrogen to progesterone in rat ovarian tissue. About 32% of the hydrogen needed for reduction of progesterone at C20 was contributed by estradiol. If no estradiol was present only 4% of progesterone was reduced at C20; when estradiol is added (10 mcgM) the reduction rate increased to about 10%. This reaction may explain the inverse changing levels of both steroids in the ovary caused by gonadotropins. The C20 reduction pathway is the main route for metabolism of progesterone in rat ovarian tissue.
https://openalex.org/W1530061786,"A novel type of pyridine nucleotide, containing 2 rather than 1 adenosine diphosphate ribose residue, was isolated from Azotobacter vinelandii strain O. The nucleotide was shown to be adenosine-diphosphoribosyl nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (ADP-ribosyl NAD) in which the ADP-ribose was glycosidically linked to the NAD+ at position 2′ or position 3′ of the nicotinamide mononucleotide moiety. Evidence was also presented that it was a mixture of the α form and the β form which differ from each other in the configuration of the nicotinamide N-ribosyl linkage. A normal equilibrium molar ratio of the α form to the β form was found to be approximately 1:1. ADP-ribosyl NAD+ did not serve as coenzyme for yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, nor was it cleaved by Neurospora crassa NAD+ glycohydrolase, indicating that the biological properties conferred on the β-NAD+ molecule were largely modified by the attachment of the ADP-ribose group."
https://openalex.org/W1540471170,"Abstract Lipid peroxidation in vitro by isolated rat adipose tissue was measured by the thiobarbituric acid reaction. Incubation of isolated fat cells with adrenocorticotrophic hormone or epinephrine stimulated total lipolysis as measured by glycerol release, but not lipid peroxidation. Epinephrine inhibited lipid peroxidation produced by ascorbate. However, prior treatment with epinephrine caused increased lipid peroxidation by epididymal fat pads. The isolated fat cells of vitamin E-deficient rats contained no detectable tocopherol. These fat cells showed no significant differences in lipid peroxidation, total lipolysis, or basal or insulin-stimulated glucose carbon incorporation into CO2 and total lipids, as compared to fat cells from vitamin Ereplete animals. Enhancement of lipid peroxidation in vitro by incubation of isolated fat cells with ascorbate caused no change in glucose carbon utilization or total lipolysis. We conclude that the thiobarbituric acid test, applied to fat cells, is not an indicator of total lipolysis, nor of vitamin E deficiency. Fat cell glucose utilization and lipolysis are not altered by either vitamin E deficiency or increased lipid peroxidation."

The derivative has been isolated as its barium salt. The formation of the derivative is completely dependent on the presence of a heat-stable factor. The identity and role of the factor are not known. However, several glycolytic intermediates acted as substitutes for this factor. They are glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and fructose 1,6diphosphate. Certain yeast extracts catalyze the oxidation of 1,6-DPNH to DPN as well as the formation of the derivative absorbing at 290 mµ."

Interaction between bacterial particles and liver sub-mitochondrial particles also occurs. Irradiation of the bacterial particles at 360 nanometers resulted in the destruction of quinone and consequent loss of ability of reduced nicotinamide adenine, dinucleotides to reduce cytochromes b, c(1), c, and a plus a(3). A mixture of both irradiated and untreated particles in the presence of the reduced dinucleotide resulted in the reduction of cytochromes c and a plus a(3), in an amount equivalent to the total concentration of these cytochromes in both types of particles. In contrast, the amount of cytochrome b reduced was equivalent to half the particle concentration or to that observed with the active particles alone. The rate of reduction of cytochromes c and a plus a(3) with the mixture of particles was similar to that with the active particles alone. The interaction or cross-linking between the particulate respiratory chains of bacteria or of bacterial and mammalian systems occurs after cytochrome b and before or at cytochrome c."
