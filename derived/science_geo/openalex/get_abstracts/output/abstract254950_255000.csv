https://openalex.org/W2157783137,"Legionella pneumophila is an intracellular bacterium that causes an acute form of pneumonia called Legionnaires' disease. After infection of human macrophages, the Legionella-containing phagosome (LCP) avoids fusion with the lysosome allowing intracellular replication of the bacterium. In macrophages derived from most mouse strains, the LCP is delivered to the lysosome resulting in Legionella degradation and restricted bacterial growth. Mouse macrophages lacking the NLR protein Ipaf or its downstream effector caspase-1 are permissive to intracellular Legionella replication. However, the mechanism by which Ipaf restricts Legionella replication is not well understood. Here we demonstrate that the presence of flagellin and a competent type IV secretion system are critical for Legionella to activate caspase-1 in macrophages. Activation of caspase-1 in response to Legionella infection also required host Ipaf, but not TLR5. In the absence of Ipaf or caspase-1 activation, the LCP acquired endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles, avoided fusion with the lysosome, and allowed Legionella replication. Accordingly a Legionella mutant lacking flagellin did not activate caspase-1, avoided degradation, and replicated in wild-type macrophages. The regulation of phagosome maturation by Ipaf occurred within 2 h after infection and was independent of macrophage cell death. In vivo studies confirmed that flagellin and Ipaf play an important role in the control of Legionella clearance. These results reveal that Ipaf restricts Legionella replication through the regulation of phagosome maturation, providing a novel function for NLR proteins in host defense against an intracellular bacterium.

Legionella pneumophila (Legionella) is a Gram-negative, intracellular bacterium and the causative agent of Legionnaires pneumonia (1McDade J.E. Shepard C.C. Fraser D.W. Tsai T.R. Redus M.A. Dowdle W.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1977; 297: 1197-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Legionella is able to infect and replicate inside human monocytes and macrophages (2Horwitz M.A. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 1319-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 3Kagan J.C. Roy C.R.

Replication within macrophages is critical for the disease, as mutants defective for intracellular growth in vitro are unable to cause pneumonia. Once phagocytosed, instead of getting degraded inside lysosomes of phagocytic cells, the bacteria resides in a specialized vacuole and starts to multiply within 8-10 h after internalization. Biogenesis of this replicative phagosome requires a functional bacterial type IV secretion system.

In this compartment, Legionella multiply exponentially, then exit the infected cell and infect new neighboring cells. However, the host factors that regulate maturation of the LCP are largely unknown. Most cells from inbred mouse strains are nonpermissive for Legionella intracellular replication with the exception of a few strains such as A/J (2Horwitz M.A. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 1319-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 8Yamamoto Y. Klein T.W. Newton C.A. Widen R. Friedman H. Infect.

The mouse strain-specific variation that is responsible for permissiveness to Legionella replication is controlled in part by Lgn1, an autosomal, recessive locus (10Dietrich W.F. Damron D.M. Isberg R.R. Lander E.S. Swanson M.S. Genomics. 1995; 26: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed that Lgn1 maps to the Birc1e gene (11Diez E. Lee S.H. Gauthier S. Yaraghi Z. Tremblay M. Vidal S. Gros P. Nat. Genetics. 2003; 33: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 12Wright E.K. Goodart S.A. Growney J.D. Hadinoto V. Endrizzi M.G. Long E.M. Sadigh K. Abney A.L. Bernstein-Hanley I. Dietrich W.F. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 27-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The product of Birc1e, Naip5, is a member of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family (also called NOD-LRR, NODs, or Caterpiller proteins) that is involved in innate immune signaling in response to microbial stimulation (13Inohara N. Chamaillard M. McDonald C. Nunez G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 355-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 14Ting J.P. Davis B.K. Annu. Rev.

The NLR protein family contains more than 20 members including Nod1, Nod2, Cryopyrin/Nalp3, Nalp1, Naip, and Ipaf. NLRs contain an N-terminal effector domain, a centrally located nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (NOD) and C-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). Recent studies have shown that Naip5 and caspase-1 restrict Legionella growth by activating cell death when macrophages are infected at high multiplicity of infection (MOI) (16Zamboni D.S. Kobayashi K.S. Kohlsdorf T. Ogura Y. Long E.M. Vance R.E. Kuida K. Mariathasan S. Dixit V.M. Flavell R.A. Dietrich W.F. Roy C.R. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Another NLR protein, Ipaf, has been implicated in the proteolytic activation of pro-caspase-1 into an enzymatically active heterodimer composed of 10- and 20-kDa subunits in response to Salmonella (17Mariathasan S. Newton K. Monack D.M. Vucic D. French D.M. Lee W.P. Roose-Girma M. Erickson S. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). However, the role of Ipaf in restricting Legionella replication is not well understood. In the present studies, we demonstrate an important function for Ipaf in the host response to Legionella through the regulation of flagellin-induced caspase-1 activation and phagosome maturation. Bacterial Strains—Legionella pneumophila strain Lp02, is a thymine auxotrophic derivative of Philadelphia (1McDade J.E. Shepard C.C. Fraser D.W. Tsai T.R. Redus M.A. Dowdle W.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1977; 297: 1197-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). The dotA mutant strain Lp03 is defective in the Dot/Icm Type IV secretion system (18Berger K.H. Merriam J.J. Isberg R.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 809-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The flaA mutant Legionella was previously described (19Molofsky A.B. Shetron-Rama L.M. Swanson M.S. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 5720-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Bacterial strains were supplemented with a plasmid that complements thymine auxotrophy and expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) at the post-exponential phase (PE) (4Amer A.O. Swanson M.S. Cell Microbiol. 2005; 7: 765-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 20Sturgill-Koszycki S. Swanson M.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1261-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Legionella pneumophila was cultured as described previously (4Amer A.O. Swanson M.S. Cell Microbiol. 2005; 7: 765-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 20Sturgill-Koszycki S. Swanson M.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1261-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) in ACES-yeast extract broth supplemented with ferric nitrate and l-cysteine. To examine bacterial intracellular multiplication, infections were performed at low MOI of 0.5 followed by centrifugation and rinsing of the wells after 1 h of infection. Experiments were performed in the absence of ferric nitrate and l-cysteine from the macrophage culture medium, to allow Legionella multiplication only intracellularly. To quantify viable bacteria per well, culture supernatants were collected, and monolayers were lysed by trituration in ice-cold PBS. Pooled supernatants and lysates were cultured for 3-4 days on CYET agar plates. The scoring of the colony-forming units (CFU) in vitro and in vivo was performed as described (20Sturgill-Koszycki S. Swanson M.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1261-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 21Brieland J. Freeman P. Kunkel R. Chrisp C. Hurley M. Fantone J. Engleberg C. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 1537-1546PubMed Google Scholar). Mice—The generation of Ipaf knock-out (KO) mice has been described (22Franchi L. Amer A. Body-Malapel M. Kanneganti T.D. Ozoren N. Jagirdar R. Inohara N. Vandenabeele P. Bertin J. Coyle A. Grant E.P. Nunez G. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Primers 5′-ctatgacacgttcagatcatgg-3′ and 5′-cctggctttgccacctctcagc-3′, were used for Birc1e genotyping. DNA sequencing of birc1e exons verified the presence of the C57BL6 allele in both Ipaf WT and KO mice. Caspase-1 KO mice (a generous gift of R. Flavell) were in a C57BL/6 background and C57BL/6 mice (the Jackson laboratory) were used as wild-type. TLR4 and TLR5 KO mice in C57BL/6 background were provided by S. Akira, Osaka University. Cryopyrin KO mice have been described (23Kanneganti T.D. Ozoren N. Body-Malapel M. Amer A.O. Park J.H. Franchi F. Whitfield J. Winfried B. Colonna M. Vandenabeele P. Bertin J. Coyle A. Grant E. Akira S. Nunez G. Nature. 2006; 440: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Nod1 KO mice in C57BL/6 background have been reported (24Chamaillard M. Hashimoto M. Horie Y. Masumoto J. Qiu S. Saab L. Ogura Y. Kawasaki A. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Valvano M.A. Foster S.J. Mak T.W. Nunez G. Inohara N. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). Macrophages—Bone marrow was prepared from leg bones of 5-8-week-old mice as previously described (20Sturgill-Koszycki S. Swanson M.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1261-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 21Brieland J. Freeman P. Kunkel R. Chrisp C. Hurley M. Fantone J. Engleberg C. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 1537-1546PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence Microscopy—GFP-expressing Legionella was detected directly by fluorescence microscopy. Synchronized infections were performed at an MOI of 2 followed by centrifugation. Samples were washed within 15 min of infection giving a final MOI of ∼0.3. Intact and degraded bacteria were detected with mouse anti-Legionella antibody (Abcam). Extracellular bacteria were identified by staining with anti-Legionella antibody and secondary Texas Red-conjugated antibody before permeabilization as previously described (4Amer A.O. Swanson M.S. Cell Microbiol. 2005; 7: 765-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). To evaluate Legionella viability, the bacteria containing a plasmid from which expression of green fluorescent protein could be induced by isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was used to infect WT and Ipaf-/- macrophages. After 2 h of infection, IPTG was added for 4 h, and the percent of metabolically active bacteria-expressing GFP was determined (20Sturgill-Koszycki S. Swanson M.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1261-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Cell death in GFP-Legionella-infected macrophages was determined using the Live/dead cell viability kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer, and the results were expressed as percent dead cells among 100 infected cells. Localization of markers on Legionella phagosomes was performed as previously described (4Amer A.O. Swanson M.S. Cell Microbiol. 2005; 7: 765-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Antibodies used were rat anti-lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1; 1D4B; Developmental Hybridoma Bank), rabbit anti-calreticulin (Stressgen Bioreagents) followed by fluorescent secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). Nuclei were stained with nucleic acid dye 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Molecular Probes). For membrane markers, vacuoles were defined as positive only when a ring of fluorescence was observed at the vacuole periphery; this stringent criterion likely underestimates the fraction of LAMP-1 and calreticulin-containing vacuoles. Samples were analyzed with Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope and Olympus Fluoview Confocal Laser scanning microscope. Pictures were captured with Olympus Fluoview Confocal Laser scanning microscope. Immunoblotting—Cells were infected at an MOI of 2, centrifuged, incubated for 15 min, then rinsed three times to remove extracellular bacteria. Cell extracts were prepared and immunoblotted with an antibody that recognizes the large subunit of mouse caspase-1 (generous gift of P. Vandenabeele) followed by appropriate secondary anti-rabbit antibody as described (22Franchi L. Amer A. Body-Malapel M. Kanneganti T.D. Ozoren N. Jagirdar R. Inohara N. Vandenabeele P. Bertin J. Coyle A. Grant E.P. Nunez G. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). When indicated macrophages were permeabilized with 10 ng/ml streptolysin O for 5 min in the absence or presence of ligands as previously described (25Walev I. Bhakdi S.C. Hofmann F. Djonder N. Valeva A. Aktories K. Bhakdi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3185-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), then rinsed, and incubated for 2 h. Purified bacterial ligands were purchased from Invivogen. LPS followed by ATP treatment of macrophages was performed as previously described (23Kanneganti T.D. Ozoren N. Body-Malapel M. Amer A.O. Park J.H. Franchi F. Whitfield J. Winfried B. Colonna M. Vandenabeele P. Bertin J. Coyle A. Grant E. Akira S. Nunez G. Nature. 2006; 440: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—Electron microscopy was performed as previously described (26Gerhardt H. Walz M.J. Faigle M. Northoff H. Wolburg H. Neumeister B. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 192: 145-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse Infection and Statistical Analysis—WT and Ipaf-/- mice were infected intratracheally with 1 × 106 bacteria of WT or flaA- mutant Legionella, and the number of bacteria in the lungs was determined at 6 h and at day 4 post-infection. Data were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney test as appropriate. Differences in data values were considered significant at a p value of less than 0.05. Ipaf-/- and Caspase-1-/- but Not Nod1-/- or Cryopyrin-/- Bone Marrow-derived Macrophages Allow Legionella Replication—Macrophages from the great majority of mouse strains are non-permissive to Legionella replication (8Yamamoto Y. Klein T.W. Newton C.A. Widen R. Friedman H. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 370-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Fortier A. Diez E. Gros P. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 328-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To identify host factors that restrict the growth of Legionella, we tested the ability of macrophages lacking several proteins implicated in the regulation of innate immunity including Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and members of the NLR family of cytosolic receptors to support bacterial replication (13Inohara N. Chamaillard M. McDonald C. Nunez G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 355-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 27Takeda K. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (2684) Google Scholar). Bone marrow (BM)-derived macrophages from wild-type mice and mutant mice deficient in TLR4, Nod1, or Cryopyrin/Nalp3 (23Kanneganti T.D. Ozoren N. Body-Malapel M. Amer A.O. Park J.H. Franchi F. Whitfield J. Winfried B. Colonna M. Vandenabeele P. Bertin J. Coyle A. Grant E. Akira S. Nunez G. Nature. 2006; 440: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar) did not support significant bacterial replication as assessed over 72 h after infection with infectious Legionella at an MOI of 0.5 (Fig. 1A). In contrast, by 72 h of infection, the bacterial counts increased 150-fold in macrophages deficient in Ipaf (Fig. 1A), another NLR family member. Legionella infection of Ipaf-/- peritoneal macrophages supported bacterial growth around 1,000-fold (Fig. 1B). Ipaf interacts with caspase-1 through a homophilic caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) and regulates the activation of caspase-1 (17Mariathasan S. Newton K. Monack D.M. Vucic D. French D.M. Lee W.P. Roose-Girma M. Erickson S. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). To test directly the role of caspase-1 in bacterial replication, wild-type and caspase-1-/- macrophages (28Kuida K. Lippke J.A. Ku G. Harding M.W. Livingston D.J. Su M.S. Flavell R.A. Science. 1995; 267: 2000-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar) were infected with Legionella, and the number of bacteria in the cultures was assessed over time. Caspase-1-/- macrophages supported the growth of the bacterium greater than 200-fold by 72 h of infection, comparable to the results obtained with Ipaf-/- macrophages under similar infection conditions (Fig. 1C). To visualize the pathogenic organism inside the cells, WT, Ipaf-/-, and caspase1-/--deficient macrophages were infected with Legionella that express green fluorescence protein (GFP), and the presence of bacteria was monitored by fluorescence microscopy. At 24-h postinfection, only a few individual bacteria were identified inside wild-type macrophages, whereas expanded compartments packed with Legionella were observed inside Ipaf-/- macrophages (Fig. 1D, arrows). The difference in intracellular bacterial replication was not due to differential uptake of Legionella because differential immunofluorescence staining showed that the number of internalized bacteria was similar in wild-type and mutant macrophages at 1-h postinfection (supplemental Fig. S1A). In contrast to pathogenic Legionella, Ipaf-/- macrophages did not allow the replication of a non-pathogenic Legionella mutant defective in Dot/Icm (supplemental Fig. S1B). Therefore, the bacterial replication is regulated by Ipaf and caspase-1, a process that requires a functional Dot/Icm system of pathogenic Legionella. Ipaf Is Required for Caspase-1 Activation in Response to Legionella Infection—We next tested if Legionella infection activates caspase-1 and if this process requires Ipaf. By 1-h postinfection, the bacterium induced proteolytic activation of pro-caspase-1 as determined by the detection of the mature 20-kDa subunit in cell extracts alone or combined with culture supernatants by Western blots (Fig. 2, A and B). Such proteolytic processing of pro-caspase-1 that required a competent type IV secretion system was abolished in Ipaf-/- macrophages (Fig. 2, A and B). The specificity of the anti-caspase-1 antibody was shown by the absence of immature and processed 20 kDa caspase-1 bands in extracts from caspase-1-/- macrophages (supplemental Fig. S1C). We performed these experiments an MOI of 2 for 15 min followed by washing, which allowed the internalization of a single Legionella in only 20-30% of macrophages giving a final MOI of ∼0.3 (4Amer A.O. Swanson M.S. Cell Microbiol. 2005; 7: 765-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Under these infection conditions, less than 3% of the Legionella-infected cells were dead at 2, 4, or 6 h after infection in both WT and Ipaf-null macrophages (Fig. 2C). Upon activation, caspase-1 cleaves pro-interleukin-1β (IL-1β), pro-IL-18, and IL-33 to generate biologically active cytokines (29Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of IL-1β and IL-18 in Legionella infection, we tested whether supplementation of IL-1β or IL-18 could inhibit the growth of Legionella observed in Ipaf-/- macrophages. We found that addition of IL-1β, IL-18 or a combination of both cytokines to macrophages at the time of infection did not suppress Legionella replication in Ipaf-/- macrophages (supplemental Fig. S2). These results indicate that Ipaf mediates caspase-1 activation in response to Legionella and suggest that caspase-1 activation is critical for the clearance of the bacterium independently of the activity of IL-1β and IL-18. Ipaf and Caspase-1 Regulate the Maturation of the Legionella-containing Phagosome at Low Multiplicity of Infection— The fusion of the LCP with lysosomes is the critical event that restricts the replication of Legionella in wild-type macrophages (30Horwitz M.A. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 2108-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 4Amer A.O. Swanson M.S. Cell Microbiol. 2005; 7: 765-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). To determine if Ipaf controls Legionella replication by regulating LCP lysosome fusion, we examined the maturation of the Legionella containing phagosome using the same conditions that allowed replication of the bacterium in Ipaf-/- macrophages. In these experiments, WT and Ipaf-/- macrophages were infected with Legionella a MOI of ∼0.3 and under conditions that allowed the internalization of a single bacterium in 20-30% of macrophages. To monitor the maturation of the LCP, we examined the rate of acquisition of the lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP-1) by phagosomes harboring Legionella. Whereas in wild-type macrophages, greater than 20% of the phagosomes containing the pathogen colocalized with LAMP-1, only 5% of the phagosomes in Ipaf-/- and caspase-1-/- macrophages acquired the lysosomal marker at 2, 4, or 6 h after infection (Fig. 3, A and B, see also supplemental Fig. S3A). The active recruitment of LAMP-1 to the Legionella compartment implies the survival of the macrophages at this time of infection, consistent with results shown in Fig. 2C. The difference in LAMP-1 colocalization between WT and Ipaf-/- is likely to be underestimated, because Legionella is rapidly degraded within phagolysosomes of wild-type macrophages. Moreover, the decrease in Legionella colocalization with LAMP-1 in Ipaf-/- macrophages is not due to a general defect in lysosome fusion because non-pathogenic Escherichia coli were effectively delivered to the lysosomes within 2 h of infection in both WT and Ipaf-/- macrophages (supplemental Fig. S3B). To assess the role of Ipaf and caspase-1 in conveying bacterial degradation, macrophages were infected with Legionella, and the intact and degraded bacteria were differentiated and scored by labeling with anti-Legionella antibody. In wild-type macrophages, by 2-h postinfection, about 40% of internalized bacteria lost their rod-shaped contour and were degraded into multiple small rounded particles as opposed to only ∼10% in Ipaf- or caspase-1-deficient macrophages (Fig. 3, C and D). Accordingly, in Ipaf-/- macrophages, ∼80% of internalized Legionella were metabolically active and expressed GFP in response to IPTG added within 2 h of infection, compared with only 20% in wild-type cells (supplemental Fig. S4). Therefore, in the absence of Ipaf or caspase-1 activation, the maturation of the LCP is stalled and Legionella escape degradation. The Legionella Vacuole Acquires Endoplasmic Reticulum-derived Vesicles in the Absence of Caspase-1 Activation—Given that the LCP is remodeled into an ER-derived organelle in human monocytes and in A/J-derived macrophages (2Horwitz M.A. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 1319-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 3Kagan J.C. Roy C.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), we examined the recruitment of calreticulin, an ER protein, to phagosomes harboring Legionella. By 5-h postinfection, 20-30% of the bacteria colocalized with calreticulin in Ipaf-/- macrophages, whereas no bacteria associated with the ER marker in wild-type macrophages (Fig. 4, A and B). Similarly, in caspase-1-/- macrophages the ER marker calreticulin accumulated around 20% of the internalized bacteria (Fig. 4, A and B). To confirm the recruitment of ER-derived vesicles to the LCP, we examined WT and Ipaf-/- macrophages after 4 h of infection by electron microscopy. Indeed, ribosome-studded vesicles accumulated around the LCP in Ipaf-/- macrophages, but not in wild-type cells (Fig. 4, C and D). Furthermore, many intact Legionella were detected in Ipaf-/- macrophages (Fig. 4C), while only scarce number of bacteria were found in wild-type cells and most showed signs of degradation (Fig. 4D). Flagellin Is Required for Legionella-induced Caspase-1 Activation—Ipaf is known to play a critical role in the activation of caspase-1 in response to Salmonella via the sensing of flagellin (22Franchi L. Amer A. Body-Malapel M. Kanneganti T.D. Ozoren N. Jagirdar R. Inohara N. Vandenabeele P. Bertin J. Coyle A. Grant E.P. Nunez G. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 31Miao E.A. Alpuche-Aranda C.M. Dors M. Clark A.E. Bader M.W. Miller S.I. Aderem A. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). To assess the molecule that triggers caspase-1 activation in response to Legionella, we performed several experiments. Initially, macrophages were stimulated with various microbial molecules in the presence of streptolysin-O (SLO), a protein that allows delivery of exogenous molecules into the cytosol of living cells (25Walev I. Bhakdi S.C. Hofmann F. Djonder N. Valeva A. Aktories K. Bhakdi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3185-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Consistent with recent results (22Franchi L. Amer A. Body-Malapel M. Kanneganti T.D. Ozoren N. Jagirdar R. Inohara N. Vandenabeele P. Bertin J. Coyle A. Grant E.P. Nunez G. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar), stimulation of wild-type macrophages with purified flagellin, but not synthetic bacterial lipopeptide (BLP) or CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG ODN), induced activation of caspase-1 when added with SLO (Fig. 5A). Notably, activation of caspase-1 induced by flagellin was abrogated in Ipaf-/- macrophages (Fig. 5, A and B). The role of Ipaf was specific in that caspase-1 activation induced by LPS and ATP was unimpaired in Ipaf-null macrophages (Fig. 5B). The low amount of SLO used to deliver flagellin to the cytosol was necessary but not sufficient for caspase-1 activation as SLO alone did not induce caspase-1 activation (Fig. 4A). To verify the role of flagellin in inducing caspase-1 activation, we infected macrophages with wild-type and mutant Legionella lacking flagellin and measured the activation of caspase-1. To ensure equal internalization of wild-type and flagellin-deficient Legionella, infections were followed by mild centrifugation to enhance contact between macrophages and mutant bacteria. Under these conditions, the uptake of wild-type and flagellin-deficient bacteria was similar at 1-h postinfection (supplemental Fig. S5). Unlike wild-type bacteria, infection of macrophages with a Legionella (flaA-) mutant lacking flagellin did not induce caspase-1 activation in wild-type macrophages (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that sensing of flagellin through Ipaf is required for Legionella to induce caspase-1 activation. TLR5 Is Not Required for Flagellin-induced Caspase-1 Activation—TLR5 mediates the sensing of extracellular bacteria, resulting in NF-κB activation through MyD88 (32Hayashi F. Smith K.D. Ozinsky A. Hawn T.R. Yi E.C. Goodlett D.R. Eng J.K. Akira S. Underhill D.M. Aderem A. Nature. 2001; 410: 1099-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2777) Google Scholar). We tested if Ipaf, or TLR5 modulate the activation of caspase-1 by flagellin. Analysis of mutant macrophages revealed that caspase-1 activation induced by flagellated Legionella was independent of TLR5 (Fig. 5D). The Presence of Bacterial Flagellin Restricts Legionella Replication in Macrophages and in Mice—To further test the role of flagellin in restricting Legionella replication inside macrophages, we infected macrophages with WT and flaA- mutant Legionella and assessed bacterial growth over time. In contrast to wild-type Legionella, mutant bacteria lacking flagellin replicated equally in both WT and Ipaf-/- macrophages (Fig. 6A). Thus, both flagellin and Ipaf are required for restricting the intracellular replication of Legionella in macrophages. To verify the mechanism by which flagellin regulates Legionella growth, we assessed the recruitment of LAMP-1 and calreticulin on phagosomes harboring mutant Legionella. Less than 5% of flaA- mutant Legionella acquired LAMP-1 in WT and Ipaf-/- macrophages, whereas greater than 20% of the phagosomes containing the wild-type pathogen colocalized with the lysosomal marker in wild-type macrophages (Fig. 6B). Accordingly, flaA- mutant Legionella did not show signs of degradation either in WT or Ipaf-/- macrophages (Fig. 6C). By 5-h postinfection, greater than 40% of the bacteria lacking flagellin colocalized with calreticulin in both WT and Ipaf-/- macrophages, whereas practically no wild-type Legionella associated with the ER marker in wild-type macrophages (Fig. 6, D and E). Thus, flagellin modulates phagosome maturation in Legionella-infected macrophages, and this process is mediated through host Ipaf. We then tested if flagellin can regulate Legionella growth in vivo. WT and Ipaf-/- mice were infected intratracheally with 1 × 106 CFU of WT or flaA- mutant Legionella and the number of bacteria in the lungs was determined at 6 h and at day-4 postinfection. At day-4 postinfection, there were ∼10-fold more Legionella CFUs in the lung tissue of Ipaf-/- mice, when compared with their wild-type counterparts (Fig. 6F) although initial bacterial counts in the lungs were identical (supplemental Fig. S5). Notably, the number of flaA- Legionella was similar in the lungs of both WT and Ipaf-/- mice (Fig. 5F), indicating flagellin is required for restricting the intracellular replication of Legionella in the animal. Recent results that showed that flagellin is critical for caspase-1 activation in Legionella-infected macrophages and can restrict the growth of the bacterium (33Molofsky A.B. Byrne B.G. Whitfield N.N. Madigan C.A. Fuse E.T. Tateda K. Swanson M.S. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 34Ren T. Zamboni D.S. Roy C.R. Dietrich W.F. Vance R.E. PloS. Pathog. 2006; 2: e18Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). However, the host factor that mediates flagellin-induced caspase-1 activation during Legionella infection remained unclear. Our studies show that the host factor Ipaf is required for caspase-1 activation in macrophages upon infection with Legionella. These studies are consistent with recent observations demonstrating that Ipaf is required for flagellin-induced caspase-1 activation in response to Salmonella (22Franchi L. Amer A. Body-Malapel M. Kanneganti T.D. Ozoren N. Jagirdar R. Inohara N. Vandenabeele P. Bertin J. Coyle A. Grant E.P. Nunez G. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 31Miao E.A. Alpuche-Aranda C.M. Dors M. Clark A.E. Bader M.W. Miller S.I. Aderem A. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Thus, both Salmonella and Legionella induce caspase-1 through the sensing of flagellin by Ipaf. The most significant finding of the present studies is that Ipaf-mediated caspase-1 activation induced by flagellin restricts Legionella growth by promoting LCP maturation and intracellular degradation, thus restricting bacterial replication. Upon Ipaf-dependent caspase-1 activation, Legionella is efficiently delivered to the lysosome for degradation. In the absence of flagellin or Ipaf-mediated caspase-1 activation, the fusion of the pathogen-enclosing compartment with the lysosome was dramatically reduced, which was associated with a robust increase in Legionella growth. Under our culture conditions, we did not observe significant cell death of WT, Ipaf-/-, or caspase-1-/- macrophages during the first 6 h of Legionella infection using low MOIs. Because the fusion of the LCP to lysosomes is largely completed by 2 h after infection, the regulation of the LCP maturation mediated by Ipaf appears to be an important event that dictates the fate of the bacteria preceding the induction of cell death. However, our studies do not rule out that cell death contributes to the restriction of Legionella growth particularly at conditions that resemble high MOI of infection. For example, recent studies showed that Naip5, another NLR protein distinct from Ipaf, restricts Legionella replication through the induction of caspase-1-dependent cell death (16Zamboni D.S. Kobayashi K.S. Kohlsdorf T. Ogura Y. Long E.M. Vance R.E. Kuida K. Mariathasan S. Dixit V.M. Flavell R.A. Dietrich W.F. Roy C.R. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). There are several possible mechanisms by which Ipaf and caspase-1 could control phagosome maturation in response to Legionella infection. Active caspase-1 cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to generate biologically active cytokines (29Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar). However, addition of IL-1β and IL-18 to Ipaf-deficient macrophages did not affect Legionella replication, suggesting that production of these cytokines is not important for restriction of Legionella growth. Therefore, it is possible that caspase-1 acts by targeting and processing host proteins involved in the formation and/or transport of the LCP (35Kagan J.C. Stein M.P. Pypaert M. Roy C.R. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Alternatively, caspase-1 could process bacterial factors that are required for formation of the specialized Legionella vacuole. Regardless of the mechanism, these results establish Ipaf and caspase-1 as important host factors for the control of the maturation of the LCP. Unlike Legionella, non-pathogenic bacteria such as E. coli were promptly delivered to the lysosome for degradation in the presence or absence of Ipaf or caspase-1. Thus, the regulation of phagosome maturation by Ipaf signaling may be restricted to Legionella or to pathogenic bacteria that employ similar molecular strategies to avoid lysosomal degradation in host macrophages. Thus, the role of Ipaf in the regulation of LCP maturation identifies a novel function for microbial pattern recognition receptors in the context of an intracellular bacterium. There are several mechanisms by which flagellin could induce the activation of caspase-1 through Ipaf in Legionella-infected macrophages. Flagellin could enter the host cytosol through the pore formed in the macrophage membrane by the Legionella Type IV secretion system (36Coers J. Kagan J.C. Matthews M. Nagai H. Zuckman D.M. Roy C.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 719-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Consistent with this is the observation that Legionella requires the Dot-Icm system for the induction of caspase-1 and phagosome maturation. Similarly, peptidoglycan derived molecules are delivered to the host cytosol by the Helicobacter pylori type IV secretion system for the activation of Nod1, another NLR family member (37Viala J. Chaput C. Boneca I.G. Cardona A. Girardin S.E. Moran A.P. Athman R. Memet S. Huerre M.R. Coyle A.J. DiStefano P.S. Sansonetti P.J. Labigne A. Bertin J. Philpott D.J. Ferrero R.L. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1166-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). The sensing of flagellin by Ipaf is most likely to be transient and/or indirect because we have been unable to detect an interaction between Ipaf and flagellin in cell extracts by immunoprecipitation (data not shown). The lack of direct interaction between flagellin and Ipaf is consistent with the mechanism of recognition of microbial components by plant Ipaf homologs (6Mackey D. Belkhadir Y. Alonso J.M.

Our results have shown a novel role for Ipaf in regulating Legionella growth in the presence of bacterial flagellin.

Prion replication involves the conversion of the normal prion protein (PrPC) into the misfolded isoform, catalyzed by tiny quantities of PrPSc present in the infectious material. We have recently developed the protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) technology to sustain the autocatalytic replication of infectious prions in vitro. Here we show that PMCA enables the specific and reproducible amplification of exceptionally minute quantities of PrPSc. Indeed, after seven rounds of PMCA, we were able to generate large amounts of PrPSc starting from a 1 × 10-12 dilution of scrapie hamster brain, which contains the equivalent of ∼26 molecules of protein monomers. According to recent data, this quantity is similar to the minimum number of molecules present in a single particle of infectious PrPSc, indicating that PMCA may enable detection of as little as one oligomeric PrPSc infectious particle. Interestingly, the in vitro generated PrPSc was infectious when injected in wild-type hamsters, producing a disease identical to the one generated by inoculation of the brain infectious material. The unprecedented amplification efficiency of PMCA leads to a several billion-fold increase of sensitivity for PrPSc detection as compared with standard tests used to screen prion-infected cattle and at least 4000 times more sensitivity than the animal bioassay. Therefore, PMCA offers great promise for the development of highly sensitive, specific, and early diagnosis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy and to further understand the molecular basis of prion propagation.

Therefore, PMCA offers great promise for the development of highly sensitive, specific, and early diagnosis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy and to further understand the molecular basis of prion propagation. Prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) 2The abbreviations used are: TSE, transmissible spongiform encephalopathy; PMCA, protein misfolding cyclic amplification; sa PMCA, serial automated PMCA; BSE, bovine spongiform encephalopathy; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PTA, phosphotungstic acid; PK, proteinase K. are neurodegenerative disorders of humans and animals. Historically, scrapie has been the most common TSE in animals, affecting sheep for over 200 years (1Collinge J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 519-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). The most recent and worrisome outbreak of an animal TSE disease is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle (2Prusiner S.B. Science. 1997; 278: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). BSE has important implications for human health, because the infectious agent can be transmitted to humans producing a new disease, termed variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (3Will R.G. Ironside J.W. Zeidler M. Cousens S.N. Estibeiro K. Alperovitch A. Poser S. Pocchiari M. Hofman A. Smith P.G. Lancet. 1996; 347: 921-925Abstract PubMed Scopus (1891) Google Scholar, 4Collinge J. Lancet. 1999; 354: 317-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). TSEs are characterized by an extremely long incubation period, followed by a brief and invariably fatal clinical disease (5Roos R. Gajdusek D.C. Gibbs Jr., C.J. Brain. 1973; 96: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To date no therapy or early diagnosis is available. The pathogen responsible for TSEs, called “prion,” is comprised mainly or exclusively of a misfolded protein named PrPSc, which is a post-translationally modified version of the normal prion protein (PrPC) (6Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4147) Google Scholar, 7Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 793-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). During the course of the disease, prions replicate by the autocatalytic conversion of PrPC into PrPSc, triggered by the misfolded protein present in the infectious inoculum. The conversion seems to involve a conformational change whereby the α-helical content of the normal protein diminishes and the amount of β-sheet increases (8Pan K.M. Baldwin M. Njuyen J. Gassett M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Crossref PubMed Scopus (2090) Google Scholar, 9Caughey B.W. Dong A. Bhat K.S. Ernst D. Hayes S.F. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7672-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). The structural changes are accompanied by alterations in the biochemical properties as follows: PrPC is soluble in nondenaturing detergents; PrPSc is insoluble; PrPC is readily digested by proteases; and PrPSc is partially resistant (7Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 793-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 10Baldwin M.A. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19197-19200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism of prion conversion, Caughey and co-workers (11Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar) developed a cell-free conversion reaction that mimics in many aspects the prion replication process. One of the limitations of the cell-free conversion method is the relatively low efficiency of PrPSc formation that diminishes its application to study the nature of the infectious agent and to attempt sensitive detection of the protein. More recently, we have developed a novel technique referred to as protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA), in which it is possible to simulate prion replication in the test tube in an accelerated and efficient way (12Saborio G.P. Permanne B. Soto C. Nature. 2001; 411: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). In a cyclic manner, conceptually analogous to PCR cycling, PrPSc is incubated with excess PrPC to enlarge the PrPSc aggregates, which are then sonicated to generate multiple smaller units for the continued formation of new PrPSc (13Soto C. Saborio G.P. Anderes L. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 390-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We have reported previously proof-of-concept experiments in which the technology was applied to replicate the misfolded protein from diverse species (12Saborio G.P. Permanne B. Soto C. Nature. 2001; 411: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar, 14Soto C. Anderes L. Suardi S. Cardone F. Castilla J. Frossard M.J. Peano S. Saá P. Limido L. Carbonatto M. Ironside J. Torres J.M. Pocchiari M. Tagliavini F. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The newly generated protein exhibits the same biochemical, biological, and structural properties as brain-derived PrPSc, and strikingly, it is infectious to wild-type animals, producing a disease with characteristics that are identical to the illness produced by brain-isolated prions (15Castilla J. Saá P. Hetz C. Soto C. Cell. 2005; 121: 195-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The technology has been automated, leading to a dramatic increase in efficiency of amplification and its application to detect PrPSc in blood of hamsters experimentally infected with scrapie (16Castilla J. Saa P. Soto C. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 982-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In this study we describe in detail the methodological aspects for efficient PMCA amplification and the characterization of the technology for reproducibility, specificity, and sensitivity. We also study the minimum number of molecules needed to trigger amplification and the application of the PMCA technique to generate infectious material in vitro. Our results demonstrate that PMCA is capable of detecting as little as ∼26 monomers of PrP, which, according to recent data on the minimal size of the infectious particle (17Silveira J.R. Raymond G.J. Hughson A.G. Race R.E. Sim V.L. Hayes S.F. Caughey B. Nature. 2005; 437: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar), would correspond to a single molecule of oligomeric infectious PrPSc. The technique is highly reproducible and specific to amplify PrPSc, because no signal is detected when no PrPSc inoculum is present. Finally, our results show that PMCA enables the increase of infectivity by around 20 million-fold, converting a sample that is not infectious into a highly infectious one. These data demonstrate that PMCA has a similar power of amplification as PCR techniques used to amplify DNA and have great promise for the development of highly sensitive detection of PrPSc and for understanding the molecular basis of prion replication. Preparation of Tissue Homogenates—Healthy and sick animals were perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plus 5 mm EDTA prior to harvesting the tissue. Ten percent brain homogenates (w/v) were prepared in conversion buffer (PBS containing 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, 4 mm EDTA, and the Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture from Roche Applied Science). The samples were clarified by a brief, low speed centrifugation (1500 rpm for 30 s) using an Eppendorf centrifuge, model 5414 (Hamburg, Germany). Dilutions of this brain homogenate were done in conversion buffer, and they are expressed in relation to the brain; for example, a 100-fold dilution is equivalent to a 1% brain homogenate. In Vivo Infectivity Studies—Syrian Golden hamsters were used as an experimental model of scrapie. Animals were 4-6-weeks old at the time of inoculation. Anesthetized animals were injected intracerebrally stereotaxically in the right hippocampus with 1 μl of the sample or intraperitoneally with 200 μl of sample as described previously (15Castilla J. Saá P. Hetz C. Soto C. Cell. 2005; 121: 195-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The onset of clinical disease was measured by scoring the animals twice a week using the following scale: 1, normal animal; 2, mild behavioral abnormalities, including hyperactivity and hypersensitivity to noise; 3, moderate behavioral problems, including tremor of the head, ataxia, wobbling gait, head bobbing, irritability, and aggressiveness; 4, severe behavioral abnormalities, including all of the above plus jerks of the head and body and spontaneous backrolls; 5, terminal stage of the disease in which the animal lies in the cage and is no longer able to stand up. Animals scoring level 4 during 2 consecutive weeks were considered sick and were sacrificed to avoid excessive pain using exposition to carbonic dioxide. The scrapie infectious material used in these studies was titrated and 1 LD50 was obtained in a brain dilution of ∼1 × 10-9. Brains were extracted and analyzed biochemically and histologically. The right cerebral hemisphere was frozen and stored at -70 °C for biochemical examination of PrPres using Western blot analysis as described below. The left hemisphere was fixed in 10% formaldehyde solution, cut into sections, and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections (6 μm thick) from each block were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, using standard protocols, or incubated with monoclonal antibodies recognizing PrP or the glial fibrillary acidic protein. Immunoreactions were developed using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method, following the manufacturer's specifications. Antibody specificity was verified by absorption. To compare the pattern of histopathological damage among animals, we calculated the lesion profile, using a variation of the method employed in mice (18Fraser H. Dickinson A.G. J. Comp. Pathol. 1968; 78: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Briefly, the severity of vacuolation was scored in a scale from 0 to 5 in seven different brain areas, including medulla, cerebellum, superior colliculus, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex occipital, frontal, and lateral. PMCA Procedure—Although the principle of PMCA remains the same as in our original publication (12Saborio G.P. Permanne B. Soto C. Nature. 2001; 411: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar), the system has been optimized and automated, thus enabling the routine processing of many more samples in the same amount of time while reaching a higher conversion efficiency. Aliquots of normal and scrapie brain homogenate prepared in conversion buffer were mixed and loaded onto 0.2-ml PCR tubes. Tubes were positioned on an adaptor placed on the plate holder of a microsonicator (Misonix model 3000, Farmingdale, NY) and programmed to perform cycles of 30 min of incubation at 37 °C followed by a 40-s pulse of sonication set at 60% potency. Samples were incubated without shaking and immersed in the water of the sonicator bath. and the entire microplate horn was kept inside an incubator at 37 °C. The detailed protocol, including troubleshooting, has been recently published elsewhere (19Castilla J. Saá P. Soto C. Lehmann S. Grassi J. Methods and Tools in Bioscience and Medicine. Techniques in Prion Research. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel2004: 198-213Google Scholar, 20Saa P. Castilla J. Soto C. Sigurdsson E.M. Amyloid Proteins: Methods and Protocols.

Proteinase K Digestion—Samples were incubated with 50 μg/ml PK for 60 min at 45 °C. The digestion was stopped by adding electrophoresis sample buffer. In each experiment it is important to have a negative control consisting of normal brain homogenate and to check that PK digestion of PrPC is complete to avoid confusion between undigested PrPC and the signal from the PK-resistant core of PrPSc. For this purpose special care has to be taken to observe the switch in the molecular weight after PK digestion, characteristic of bona fide PrPSc. Western Blot—Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, electroblotted into nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with 3F4 antibody (22Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Signet, Dedham, MA) diluted 1:5000 in PBS. The immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence assay (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometric analysis was done by using a UVP Bioimaging system EC3 apparatus (Upland, CA). Statistical significance of the values was evaluated by Student's t test. ELISA—Twenty μl of serial dilutions of an infected hamster brain into 10% normal brain homogenate were treated with 50 μg/ml PK for 1 h at 45°C and 450 rpm. The digestion was stopped with 50 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The digested samples were mixed with PBS up to 100 μl, loaded onto a 96-well ELISA plate (Maxisorp surface treatment), and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The plates were blocked with 5% BSA inPBSfor 1 h at 37°C, followed by incubation for 1 h with the monoclonal antibody 3F4 (Signet, Dedham, MA) diluted 1:3000 in 1% BSA in PBS. The antibody was washed four times with 200 μl of PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and samples were incubated with the polyclonal antibody anti-mouse IgG, conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences), and diluted 1:1000 in 1% BSA in PBS. After four washes the samples were developed with ImmunoPure ABTS (Pierce) following the manufacturer's directions. PTA Precipitation—Twenty μl of serial dilutions of an infected hamster brain into 10% normal brain homogenate were first treated with benzonase (2.5 units/μl in PBS, 1 mm MgCl2) for 30 min at 37 °C with constant agitation. Thereafter, we added 4% PTA (prepared in 70 mm MgCl2, titrated with NaOH to pH 7.4) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with constant agitation. Samples were centrifuged at 15,800 × g for 30 min at 37 °C in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. Pellet was resuspended in 20-30 μl of PBS containing 0.1% Sarkosyl. After treatment with PK, samples were analyzed by Western blot as described above. PrPSc Quantitation—To estimate the quantity and the number of molecules of PrPSc in our samples, we analyzed several dilutions of scrapie brain homogenate by Western blot in the same gel as aliquots of known amounts of recombinant hamster PrP (supplemental Fig. 1A). The signal intensity was evaluated by densitometry, and the quantity of PrP in the sample was estimated by extrapolation of the calibration curve prepared with recombinant PrP (supplemental Fig. 1B). To minimize artifacts because of saturated or weak signal, several different dilutions were measured, and each dilution was analyzed in triplicate. To standardize the signal among the different blots, the densitometric data were expressed relative to the value of the signal of the same quantity of normal brain homogenate (without PK treatment). PrPSc quantitation was also confirmed by ELISA using recombinant PrP as standard. In this way we estimated the average concentration of PrPSc in the scrapie brain used in our studies to be 67 ng/μl. The number of molecules of PrPSc detected was estimated by mathematical calculation of the dilution used and the known concentration of PrPSc in the brain homogenate. The PMCA Technology and Its Reproducibility—PMCA consists of cycles of accelerated prion replication. The basis for PMCA is the observation that prion replication follows a seeding-nucleation model in which oligomeric PrPSc in the infectious material converts PrPC by integrating monomeric proteins into the ends of the aggregate, inducing and stabilizing its misfolding (13Soto C. Saborio G.P. Anderes L. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 390-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 23Caughey B. Kocisko D.A. Raymond G.J. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 807-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). PMCA is a cyclic process consisting of two phases. During the first phase the samples containing minute amounts of PrPSc and a large excess of PrPC were incubated to induce growing of PrPSc polymers. In the second phase the sample is sonicated to break down the polymers, multiplying the number of nuclei. In this way, after each cycle the number of “seeds” is increased in an exponential fashion. The number of cycles can be repeated as many times as needed to reach the amplification rate desired. For practical operation, the system has been automated by using a programmable plate sonicator, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This improvement not only decreases processing time and allows for the routine processing of many more cycles than a single probe sonicator but also prevents loss of material. Cross-contamination is eliminated because there is no direct probe intrusion into the sample. Reproducibility of amplification was measured by monitoring the PrPSc signal obtained before and after PMCA cycling under different experimental conditions. Equivalent samples containing a 10,000-fold dilution of scrapie brain into 10% healthy hamster brain homogenate were placed in distinct positions of the microplate sonicator and subjected to 48 PMCA cycles. The levels of amplification were studied by Western blot after PK digestion (Fig. 1A), and data were quantitated by densitometric analysis of the Western blot signal (Fig. 1B). Although some small variability was observed on the signal obtained in distinct wells, the differences were not significant and could not be attributed to a position effect, but rather they probably reflect some small experimental variability. To analyze further the reproducibility of the procedure, equivalent samples containing a 10,000-fold dilution of scrapie brain homogenate into 10% healthy hamster brain homogenate were subjected to 48 PMCA cycles in experiments done on different days. Fig. 1C shows that at 7 distinct days the amplification efficiency was virtually the same. Again, densitometric analysis showed that the signal was not statistically different in the distinct experiments (Fig. 1D). For this experiment, the normal brain sample used on day 1 was freshly prepared, whereas for all the other days, frozen material was used. Therefore, no differences between fresh and frozen material were observed. However, it is important to note that brain substrate has to be frozen in aliquots to avoid repetitive freezing-thawing that decreases PMCA efficiency. The influence of different, but equivalent, inocula on the conversion efficiency was studied by amplifying preparations of 10,000-fold diluted scrapie brain homogenate obtained from five distinct hamsters into the same substrate (Fig. 1E). After 48 PMCA cycles, a large and similar conversion of PrPC into PrPSc was observed. A similar result was obtained when normal brain homogenate from five different hamsters was used as a substrate for the amplification of a unique PrPSc inoculum (Fig. 1G). However, densitometric analysis of the experiments shown in Fig. 1, E and G, indicate that in both cases one sample gave a statistically significant different level of amplification than the other four samples (Fig. 1, F and H, respectively). These differences are not because of changes in the levels of PrPSc or PrPC in the samples, which were not significantly different. These results suggest that perhaps individual variability on the expression of PrP or conversion factors may lead to changes on the extent of prion conversion in vitro. In none of the experiments shown in Fig. 1 was PrPSc detectable in samples containing the same material but kept frozen without amplification. Specificity of PMCA Amplification—Specificity of cyclic amplification was evaluated in a blind study in which 10 brain samples of scrapie-affected hamsters and 11 samples of healthy animals were subjected to 48 PMCA cycles, and PrPSc was detected by Western blot analysis after PK digestion (Fig. 2, A and B). The results show that although 100% of the samples derived from sick animals (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 21) were positive after PMCA, none of the samples coming from normal animals (lanes 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, and 20) show any significant PrPSc signal. Of the 10 positive control samples, 7 corresponded to a 10,000-fold dilution of brain, 2 corresponded to a 50,000-fold dilution (Fig. 2A, lanes 13 and 17 in), and 1 corresponded to a 100,000-fold dilution (Fig. 2A, lane 19). None of these 10 samples showed any PrPSc signal in Western blot without PMCA amplification (data not shown). The interpretation of the data is that, under the conditions used, PMCA leads to 100% specificity for PrPSc detection. As demonstrated before, the amplification rate using PMCA depends upon the number of incubation/sonication cycles carried out (12Saborio G.P. Permanne B. Soto C. Nature. 2001; 411: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). Thus, we decided to evaluate whether a PrPSc-like signal might appear on negative samples after many PMCA cycles. For this purpose, a 10% healthy hamster brain homogenate in the absence (negative control) or in the presence (positive control) of an aliquot of a 50,000-fold diluted scrapie brain was subjected to 24, 48, 96, or 144 PMCA cycles, and the PrPSc signal was detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2C). The results clearly indicate that PrPSc reactivity was detected only after PMCA in the positive control samples with an intensity that depended upon the number of cycles performed. In comparison, in the negative control samples, no PrPSc was ever detected, regardless of the number of PMCA cycles carried out (Fig. 2C). Specificity was further studied in an even more challenging situation in which several rounds of PMCA were done after diluting the material to refresh the substrate. We have shown that PrPSc can be kept replicating indefinitely in vitro by several rounds of successive PMCA (15Castilla J. Saá P. Hetz C. Soto C. Cell. 2005; 121: 195-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) and that serial PMCA enables the ultrasensitive detection of PrPSc in brain and blood samples (16Castilla J. Saa P. Soto C. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 982-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Brains from healthy hamsters and from animals infected with the 263K scrapie strain were diluted 104-fold into a 10% normal hamster brain homogenate. Samples were subjected to 48 PMCA cycles. After this first round of PMCA, a small aliquot of the amplified samples was taken and diluted 10-fold into more normal brain homogenate. These samples were again amplified by 48 PMCA cycles. This procedure was repeated several times, and PrPSc generation was determined by Western blot analysis after PK digestion. As shown in Fig. 2D, 10 rounds of PMCA to reach a final dilution of the original brain equivalent to 10-13 led to continuous formation of PrPSc only when the initial inoculum was derived from scrapie-infected animals. No PrPSc was ever detected in the absence of PrPSc inoculum, indicating that the system retains high specificity, even after 480 PMCA cycles. These same samples were used for further amplification, and after a dilution of more than 10-63 of initial inoculum a robust and continuous amplification was observed in samples containing PrPSc. When many additional rounds of saPMCA were performed, we observed a scatter appearance of a protease-resistant band identical to PrPSc even in samples without PrPSc inoculum (data not shown). Spontaneous generation of PrPSc was seen mainly when more than 10 rounds of PMCA were done. At present we do not know whether this newly generated PrPSc is the result of cross-contamination or the de novo generation of PrPSc. More experiments need to be performed to analyze the reproducibility of this observation and to distinguish between these two possibilities. In case we ruled out the possibility of contamination, these findings would indicate that PMCA can amplify a low frequency event in which PrPC spontaneously converts into PrPSc. This could be the basis for the origin of sporadic prion diseases. Sensitivity of PMCA and Minimum Number of Molecules Detected after Amplification—We have recently reported that sensitivity of detection after 140 cycles of PMCA was increased by around 6600-fold (16Castilla J. Saa P. Soto C. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 982-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). We also reported previously that to further increase replication efficiency, we needed to refresh the substrate periodically using a methodology we termed serial automated PMCA (saPMCA) (16Castilla J. Saa P. Soto C. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 982-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). By performing two rounds of saPMCA, we were able to detect PrPSc up to a 5 × 10-10 dilution of scrapie hamster brain, to reach an increase of sensitivity of around 10 million-fold (16Castilla J. Saa P. Soto C. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 982-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). To estimate the minimum number of molecules of PrPSc that our technology can detect in a given sample, we diluted a scrapie brain homogenate 1 × 10-12-fold into conversion buffer and subjected this material to saPMCA. According to our estimations, the PrPSc concentration in the scrapie-infected brain used for these studies was ∼67 ng/μl (see “Experimental Procedures” and supplemental Fig. 1). This result indicates that a 1 × 10-12-fold dilution should contain ∼6.7 × 10-20 g/μl or 1.3 molecules of PrPSc monomer per μl. Because in our experiments we use a volume of 20 μl, the sample tested contains ∼26 molecules of monomeric PrPSc. Strikingly, after five rounds of saPMCA, we were able to detect a signal in one of the four replicates used, and after seven rounds of amplification, we detected a signal in three of the four replicates (Fig. 3). Importantly, no amplified product was detected when a 10-14-fold dilution of brain was used (a sample that should contain no molecules of PrPSc) or in any of the control samples in which no PrPSc was present (Fig. 3). No signal was detected either in a 10-13-fold dilution (data not shown). The serious consequences of the BSE epidemics and the"

There is also evidence that angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced generation of ROS contributes to the development of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, although the precise mechanisms remain unknown. In the present study, we found that Ang II markedly enhanced NADPH oxidase activity and consequent ROS generation in L6 myotubes. These effects were blocked by the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker losartan, and by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin. Ang II also promoted the translocation of NADPH oxidase cytosolic subunits p47phox and p67phox to the plasma membrane within 15 min. Furthermore, Ang II abolished insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), activation of protein kinase B (Akt), and glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) translocation to the plasma membrane, which was reversed by pretreating myotubes with losartan or apocynin. Finally, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-specific gene silencing targeted specifically against p47phox (p47siRNA), in both L6 and primary myotubes, reduced the cognate protein expression, decreased NADPH oxidase activity, restored Ang II-impaired IRS1 and Akt activation as well as GLUT4 translocation by insulin.

Ang II is an important physiological regulator of blood pressure, cardiac function, and salt and fluid homeostasis. Its hypertensive, growth, and remodeling effects are mediated through the Ang II receptor 1 (AT1R) (1Sowers J.R. N. Engl. J.

Furthermore, Ang II acting through the AT1R is known to stimulate NADPH oxidase, which generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a variety of cells (5Sowers J.R. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2004; 286: H1597-H1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Indeed, ROS production by NADPH oxidase activation has been strongly associated with hypertension and insulin resistance in vascular tissue (17Lassegue B. Clempus R.E. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp Physiol. 2003; 285: R277-R297Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). NADPH oxidase is a highly regulated membrane-bound enzyme complex that catalyzes the one-electron reduction of oxygen to superoxide anion with the simultaneous oxidation of cytosolic NADPH (17Lassegue B.

Components of NADPH oxidase complex of phagocytes include the membrane-bound cytochrome b558, composed of 2 subunits, p22phox and gp91phox, and 4 cytosolic subunits, p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and the small GTP-binding protein, Rac1/Rac2 (18Abo A.

Magder S.A. Barreiro E. Quinn M.T. Hussain S.N. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 165: 412-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Activation of NADPH oxidase in phagocytes, which have been studied most extensively, involves the translocation of cytosolic subunit proteins p47phox and p67phox to the plasma membrane (18Abo A.

Science. 1992; 256: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). This is regulated in part by the interaction between p47phox and p67phox each harboring two SH3 domains for which deletion or substitution of residues disrupt interaction and diminish enzyme activation (21Mizuki K.

Key to activating NADPH oxidase is p47phox, which forms a stable complex with the cytoplasmic region of the membranebound cytochrome b558 (22Watanabe Y. Tsuboi H. Koyama M. Kubo M. Del Carpio C.A.

Although effects of Ang II via ROS on vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and adipocytes have been intensively studied, Ang II effects on skeletal muscle remain largely unknown. Increased superoxide content has been noted in skeletal muscle with local elevated Ang II levels (10Blendea M.C. Jacobs D. Stump C.S. McFarlane S.I. Ogrin C. Bahtyiar G. Stas S. Kumar P. Sha Q. Ferrario C.M. Sowers J.R. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 288: E353-E359Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, whether Ang II-induced ROS production in skeletal muscle is mainly through NADPH oxidase and consequently contributes to insulin resistance in skeletal muscle remains unclear. In the present investigation, we demonstrated that Ang II increased NADPH oxidase activity, thereby increasing ROS generation and impairing insulin-induced insulin receptor substrate (IRS1) tyrosine phosphorylation, Akt activation, and GLUT4 translocation to plasma membranes. In addition, blocking AT1R by losartan or inhibiting NADPH oxidase by apocynin suppressed ROS production and restored insulin stimulated IRS1 and Akt activation and GLUT4 translocation. Furthermore, knockdown of p47phox utilizing p47 siRNA-reduced NADPH oxidase activity and improved insulin-mediated Akt phosphorylation and GLUT4 translocation in the presence of Ang II. Materials—siRNA targeted against p47phox, scrambled control siRNA, fluorescein conjugate siRNA, and siRNA transfection reagent were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against p67phox and p47phox were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies for Akt and phospho-Akt (Ser473), IRS1, phospho-IRS1 were purchased from Upstate Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) and Abcam Inc (Cambridge, MA). Angiotensin II, insulin, and NADPH, diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), apocynin, NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), oxypurinol, and rotenone were purchased from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), and antibiotic-antimycotic solution (10,000 units/ml penicillin G, 10 mg/ml streptomycin, and 25 mg/ml amphotericin B) were purchased from Invitrogen. Cell Culture—L6 rat skeletal muscle cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in DMEM with 10% (v/v) FBS and 1% v/v antibiotic-antimycotic solution (10,000 units/ml penicillin G, 10 mg/ml streptomycin, and 25 mg/ml amphotericin B) at 5% CO2 and 37 °C until ∼80% confluency. To induce differentiation, cells were further cultured in DMEM containing 2% FBS for 6-8 days. Cells were fed fresh medium every 48 h and used at the stage of myotubes (60-70%) when GLUT4 expression is highest (26Mitsumoto Y. Burdett E. Grant A. Klip A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Myogenic differentiation to myotubes was confirmed by light microscopy with morphological alignment, elongation, and fusion. Primary skeletal muscle cells were prepared from Sprague-Dawley rats according to the methods as previously described (27Chakravarthy M.V. Davis B.S. Booth F.W. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 89: 1365-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Animals were anesthetized with a single intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital. The gastrocnemius and EDL muscles were removed and washed in sterile PBS, pH 7.4 to remove blood cells, trimmed of excess connective tissue and fat, and homogenized with scissors in sterile PBS, and subjected to enzymatic digestion by incubation at 37 °C in DMEM with 0.2% collagenase for 1 h and centrifuged at 1,500 × g. Pellets were then resuspended in sterile PBS, mixed with a vortex mixer for 20 s, and centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g. The supernatant containing the cell fraction was removed, followed by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were pooled and resuspended in DMEM with 10% horse serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic solution and passed through sterile 40 μm cell strainer (BD Biosciences). The filtered suspension was centrifuged again at 1,500 × g, and the pellet was then resuspended in 10 volumes of DMEM containing 10% horse serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and plated onto uncoated 100-mm dishes for 3 h in a 37°C incubator humidified with 5% CO2. The unattached cells floating in the medium after the 3 h of incubation were then transferred onto a fresh dish, and this procedure was repeated twice. The cells were further purified using magnetic beads coated with anti-desmin antibody (Hybridoma, ATCC). The isolated satellite cells were cultured on rat-tail collagen-coated plates in high serum medium (Ham's F-10 nutrient mixture containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 1% chicken embryo extract, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% glutamine). The cells were counted using a hemacytometer and seeded at 1 × 105 cells per well on a 6-well plate in 2 ml of F-10 with 10% FBS until ∼80% confluency. To induce differentiation, cells were further cultured in DMEM containing 2% FBS for 6-8 days. Transfection of siRNA—L6 and primary myotubes were transfected with p47siRNA (sc-45918), control siRNA (sc-37007), control siRNA fluorescein conjugate (sc-36869, sc-44239) as per the manufacturer's instruction with minor modifications (28Huang C. Thirone A.C. Huang X. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19426-19435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The differentiation medium was changed to antibiotic-free medium on day 4, and 0.6 μg of siRNA was transfected using transfection reagent in transfection medium. 6 h after transfection, DMEM containing 4% FBS was added to each well to a final concentration of 2% FBS (v/v). Cells were transfected again on day 6 with 1 μg of siRNA. 6 h after transfection, the cells were further incubated with Ang II for additional 24 h. In some experiments, the cells were further stimulated with insulin for 30 min, as detailed in figure legends. Cellular Uptake of Fluorescent-labeled siRNA—Transfection efficiency was determined by incubating myotubes with a control fluorescent-labeled siRNA, using the above transfection methods. Fluorescence was visualized using confocal microscopy. Nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, blue) and fluorescent siRNA accumulated in the perinuclear region (green, Fig. 3B). By comparing perinuclear fluorescence and blue-stained nuclei in ∼50 cells in five representative fields from different plates, the percentage of fluorescent-positive relative to total nuclei was 72 ± 2% in L6 myotubes. NADPH Oxidase Activity—After 6 h of incubation in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, L6 myotubes were treated with various concentrations (10-9 to 10-6 m) of Ang II for 24 h. In other experiments, L6 myotubes were stimulated with Ang II for 24 h in the absence or presence of apocynin (200 μm), which blocks association of p47phox with membrane-associated subunits, p22phox and gp91phox (29Touyz R.M. Yao G. Quinn M.T. Pagano P.J. Schiffrin E.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), or with losartan (10-6 m), a blocker of AT1R. Subcellular fractionation of myotubes was performed as previously described (20Javesghani D. Magder S.A. Barreiro E. Quinn M.T. Hussain S.N. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 165: 412-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Myotubes were washed with ice-cold PBS, scraped gently from 10-cm plates, centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, resuspended in 300 μl of homogenization buffer (50 mm phosphate buffer, 0.01 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm leupeptin, 2 μm pepstatin A, pH 7.4) and placed on ice. The myotubes were then homogenized using a Duall homogenizer and sonication. An aliquot of the total homogenate was saved, and the remaining homogenate was then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min, 4 °C, the supernatant was collected and was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C with the resulting supernatant yielding the plasma membrane-enriched fractions (PM). Homogenate (50 μg of protein) was incubated with NADPH (100 μm) at 37 °C, and the rate of NADPH consumption monitored by measuring the decline in absorbance (340 nm) every 10 min, using a plate reader spectrophotometer (Bio-Tek EL808). To verify NADPH oxidase contribution and exclusion of other molecular sources of NADPH consumption, the procedure was repeated in the presence of DPI (2 μm), l-NAME (1 mm), apocynin (200 μm), oxypurinol (100 μm), or rotenone (250 μm) (10Blendea M.C.

Plasma membrane fractions were isolated, and NADPH oxidase activity was measured as described above. Plasma membrane proteins (50 μg) were incubated with NADPH (100 μm) in reaction buffer with or without various inhibitors at 37°C, and the rate of NADPH consumption monitored by measuring the decline in absorbance (340 nm) every 10 min, using a plate reader spectrophotometer (Bio-Tek EL808).Incubation conditionNADPH consumptionnmol/mg protein/minNo inhibitor17.5 ± 2.5Apocynin (200 μm)3.8 ± 0.6ap < 0.05, compared to no inhibitorDPI (2 μm)8.6 ± 1.3ap < 0.05, compared to no inhibitorOxypurinol (100 μm)15.9 ± 2.2Rotenone (250 μm)14.5 ± 2.8l-NAME (1 mm)16.3 ± 3.6a p < 0.05, compared to no inhibitor Open table in a new tab Lucigenin-enhanced Chemiluminescence Detection of ROS in Myotubes—ROS production was measured using a lucigenin method (30Griendling K.K.

Briefly, 1 × 105 of L6 myoblasts/well was plated in 6-well plates and cultured with DMEM with low glucose and 2% FBS for 6-8 days. The resulting L6 myotubes were treated with Ang II (10-7 m) for 24 h in the absence or presence of losartan (10-6 m), or apocynin (200 μm) (11Taniyama Y. Hitomi H. Shah A. Alexander R.W.

The cells were then trypsinized, collected by centrifugation, and the pellet washed in modified Krebs buffer containing NaCl (130 mm), KCl (5 mm), MgCl2 (1 mm), CaCl2 (1.5 mm), K2HPO4 (1 mm), and Hepes (20 mm), pH 7.4. After washing, the cells were resuspended in Krebs buffer with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. To measure ROS production, the cell suspension was transferred into plastic tubes with lucigenin (5 μm final concentration). Photon emission was counted for 20 min. Modified Krebs buffer was used as control (blank). Oxidative Fluorescence Microphotography—Superoxide generation in L6 myotubes was evaluated by use of the oxidative fluorescent dye dihydroethidium (DHE). L6 myotubes were cultured in chamber slides and treated as above. After washing with icecold PBS, L6 myotubes were incubated with DHE 1 μm/l in a light-protected humidified chamber at 37 °C for 10 min. DHE specifically reacts with intracellular superoxide and is converted to the red fluorescent compound ethidium, which then binds irreversibly to double-stranded DNA and appears as punctuate nuclear staining (32Tojo T. Ushio-Fukai M. Yamaoka-Tojo M. Ikeda S. Patrushev N. Alexander R.W. Circulation. 2005; 111: 2347-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The specificity of DHE signals forO2− detection was confirmed by preincubation with polyethylene glycol-superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD, 500 units/ml, Sigma). mRNA Transcripts by Real Time PCR—L6 cells were grown under the conditions specified above. They were treated in the same way as for protein extraction. The cells were scraped off in ice-cold PBS and separated (1000 × g). The supernatant was removed and RNA Later was added for preservation. Total mRNA was extracted using RNeasy midi-kits from Qiagen (Germany). The RNA was then subjected to an additional round of DNase1 digestion (Invitrogen). 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using RT kit from ABI Systems (Roche Applied Science). 100 ng of starting cDNA was used to run the real time reactions in 50 μl of reaction mixture under universal cycling parameters for Rac1 and p67 (20Javesghani D.

Immunofluorescence—L6 myotubes grown on chamber slides were treated as indicated above, washed with PBS and fixed in methanol/acetone (50:50, v/v) for 10 min, and blocked with 5% goat serum containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% saponin. Thereafter, myotubes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with goat anti-p67phox antibody at 1:200 dilutions. After three washes in PBS, rabbit anti-goat IgG antibody conjugated with Alex 568 (Molecular Probes) was added for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were extensively washed in PBS, mounted on glass slides with mounting media (Vector), and images were acquired with the fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Eclipse 50i) using Meta Imaging Software (Molecular Devices Corporation). p47phox and p67phox Translocation—L6 myotubes were treated with Ang II for 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, and 24 h and the plasma membrane-enriched fractions isolated by differential centrifugation see above and further centrifuged at 100,000 × g. Pellets containing the plasma membrane fractions were resuspended in homogenization buffer and analyzed by Western blot analysis using antibodies to p47phox or p67phox (1:1000). The intensities of the immunoblot bands were quantified Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). We have verified PM enriched fractions by noting robust Na+K+ ATPase α-subunit expression by Western blot and by confirming negligible citrate synthase (mitochondria activities) (data not shown). β-Actin was used as a loading control. Immunoprecipitation of IRS1—L6 myotubes or primary myotubes were treated with Ang II (10-7 m) for 24 h in the absence or presence of losartan (10-6 m) or apocynin (200 μm) or transfected with p47siRNA and then were incubated with Ang II (10-7 m) for 24 h.

https://openalex.org/W1964025444,"Small DNA tumour viruses have evolved a number of mechanisms to drive nondividing cells into S phase. Virally encoded oncoproteins such as adenovirus E1A and human papillomavirus (HPV) E7 can bind an array of cellular proteins to override proliferation arrest. The DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 is the major mammalian enzyme responsible for maintaining CpG methylation patterns in the cell following replication. One of the hallmarks of tumour cells is disrupted DNA methylation patterns, highlighting the importance of the proper regulation of DNA methyltransferases in normal cell proliferation. Here, we show that adenovirus 5 E1A and HPV-16 E7 associate in vitro and in vivo with the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1. Consistent with this interaction, we find that E1A and E7 can purify DNA methyltransferase activity from nuclear extracts. These associations are direct and mediated by the extreme N-terminus of E1A and the CR3 zinc-finger domain of E7. Furthermore, we find that a point mutant at leucine 20 of E1A, a residue known to be critical for its transformation functions, is unable to bind Dnmt1 and DNA methyltransferase activity. Finally, both E1A and E7 can stimulate the methyltransferase activity of Dnmt1 in vitro. Our results provide the first indication that viral oncoproteins bind and regulate Dnmt1 enzymatic activity. These observations open up the possibility that this association may be used to control cellular proliferation pathways and suggest a new mechanism by which small DNA tumour viruses can steer cells through the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2087181878,"Ca2+ entering a cell through a torn or disrupted plasma membrane rapidly triggers a combination of homotypic and exocytotic membrane fusion events. These events serve to erect a reparative membrane patch and then anneal it to the defect site. Annexin A1 is a cytosolic protein that, when activated by micromolar Ca2+, binds to membrane phospholipids, promoting membrane aggregation and fusion. We demonstrate here that an annexin A1 function-blocking antibody, a small peptide competitor, and a dominant-negative annexin A1 mutant protein incapable of Ca2+ binding all inhibit resealing. Moreover, we show that, coincident with a resealing event, annexin A1 becomes concentrated at disruption sites. We propose that Ca2+ entering through a disruption locally induces annexin A1 binding to membranes, initiating emergency fusion events whenever and wherever required.

Plasma membrane disruption, a common form of cell injury, is provoked in many mammalian tissues by physiological levels of mechanical stress (1McNeil P.L. Terasaki M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E124-E129Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Disease can result from a failure either to prevent or repair disruptions. In Duchenne muscular dystrophy, for example, normal muscle contractions result in a pathological level of disruption injury because of increased fiber fragility (2Petrof B.J. Shrager J.B. Stedman H.H. Kelly A.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3710-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). In limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, on the other hand, the failure is in the repair of normally occurring disruptions (3Bansal D. Miyake K. Vogel S.S. Groh S. Chen C.C. Williamson R. McNeil P.L. Campbell K.P. Nature. 2003; 423: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). Indeed, membrane repair, or resealing, is the universal survival response that eukaryotic cells mount when confronted with a life-threatening disruption in the integrity of their plasma membrane. The mechanism of resealing is now well characterized at the cellular level. A large plasma membrane disruption (>1 μm diameter) locally and rapidly (subsecond to second time scale) elicits Ca2+-activated, homotypic vesicle fusion (4McNeil P.L. Vogel S.S. Miyake K. Terasaki M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1891-1902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Terasaki M. Miyake K. McNeil P.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The “patch” vesicle thus formed then fuses exocytotically with the plasma membrane surrounding the defect site, restoring barrier continuity (6Bi G.-Q. Alderton J.M. Steinhardt R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 7Miyake K. McNeil P.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1737-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Identification of the protein components of this process is under way, and members of the SNARE 2The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; TRDx, Texas Red dextran; FDx, fluorescein dextran; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PI, propidium iodide. family (membrane proteins thought to be required for many fusion events) are implicated in resealing (8Steinhardt R.A. Bi G. Alderton J.M. Science. 1994; 263: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). However, as an emergency response it must be rapid and Ca2+-responsive and yet capable of being activated with a great level of temporal and spatial flexibility. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that resealing-based fusion may utilize, in addition to canonical elements such as the SNAREs, a specialized subset of fusion components (9McNeil P.L. Kirchhausen T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Dysferlin, a Ca2+-activated membrane-binding protein that mediates exocytotic fusion events in nematodes (10Bansal D. Campbell K.P. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 206-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), is one candidate emergency fusion component. Thus, it was recently shown that skeletal muscle cells from dysferlin null mice fail to reseal disruptions (3Bansal D. Miyake K. Vogel S.S. Groh S. Chen C.C. Williamson R. McNeil P.L. Campbell K.P. Nature. 2003; 423: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). One protein shown by immunolocalization and immunoprecipitation to associate with dysferlin in normal, undisturbed skeletal muscle is annexin A1 (11Lennon N.J. Kho A. Bacskai B.J. Perlmutter S.L. Hyman B.T. Brown Jr., R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50466-50473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), a member of the annexin family of Ca2+-regulated membrane-binding proteins (12Gerke V. Creutz C.E. Moss S.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). This observation, as well as the following additional points, suggested that annexin A1 might be another component of the repair machinery. First, tissues expressing annexin A1 include those mentioned above as known locales of plasma membrane disruption. Second, humans with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, in which the frequency of sacrolemma disruption is greatly increased, exhibit enhanced levels of skeletal muscle annexin (several family members) expression (13Probst-Cousin S. Berghoff C. Neundorfer B. Heuss D. Muscle Nerve. 2004; 30: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and humans with dysferlin-related muscular dystrophy specifically exhibit an increase in annexin A1 expression (14Cagliani, R., Magri, F., Toscano, A., Merlini, L., Fortunato, F., Lamperti, C., Rodolico, C., Prelle, A., Sironi, M., Aguennouz, M., Ciscato, P., Uncini, A., Moggio, M., Bresolin, N., Comi, G. P., Hum. Mutat. 26, 283Google Scholar). Third, Ca2+-activated annexin A1 can aggregate and, in some cases, fuse phospholipids bilayers (12Gerke V. Creutz C.E. Moss S.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). Finally annexin A1 was shown recently to participate in a specific fusion event, the inward vesiculation in multivesicular endosomes, which is driven by budding and fusion of the organelle-limiting membrane (15White I.J. Bailey L.M. Aghakhani M.R. Moss S.E. Futter C.E. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Clearly, however, the question of whether annexin A1 is in fact a component of the resealing machinery can only be answered by direct functional and structural such as are described here. Expression Vectors, Transfection, and Cloning—HeLa and BS-C-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. The annexin A1 green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression vectors have been described and were originally characterized elsewhere (16Rescher U. Zobiack N. Gerke V. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3931-3938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For transfection, subconfluent HeLa and BS-C-1 cells were scraped from 35-mm dishes in 200 μl of PBS containing 20 μg of vector. Enrichment of GFP-expressing cells was then achieved by antibiotic-based selection followed by subcloning. Population Wounding and Reagent Loading—For the peptide inhibition studies, subconfluent HeLa cells were scraped at 37 °C from 35-mm dishes with a rubber policeman in 200 μl of PBS alone or in PBS containing peptide. Cmanx1-GFP-positive HeLa cells and nontransfected HeLa cells were scraped in the same way, except that Texas Red dextran (TRDx, 70 kDa, Molecular Probes) was added (1 mg/ml) to all PBS solutions. For the antibody inhibition studies, the scrape-loading technique was modified so that we could maximize antibody introduction into cell cytosol. HeLa populations were scraped 1-2 h after being seeded into 96-well plates (instead of 35-mm dishes) with the narrow end of a standard 200-μl laboratory pipette (“yellow”) tip (instead of a rubber policeman) in 5 μl (instead of 200 μl) of fluorescein dextran (FDx, 156 kDa, Molecular Probes) containing the same concentration (250 μg/ml) of mouse monoclonal anti-annexin A1 antibody (BD Biosciences, whole human annexin A1 as antigen) or the same isotype mouse antibody (provided as a gift by L. Ignatowicz, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta). FACS Analysis—HeLa and BS-C-1 cells were centrifuged after scraping or other wounding procedures for 5 min at 1000 rpm. The cell pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of PBS. Samples were kept on ice until analysis, and propidium iodide (PI; 0.05 mg/ml) was added to cell suspensions immediately prior to FACS analysis of the dye (PI, FDx, TRDx) staining level carried out as described previously (17McNeil P.L. Murphy R.F. Lanni F. Taylor D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1556-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Histograms were obtained by analyzing 10,000 cells with CellQuest Pro (BD Biosciences). Laser Wounding and Image Analysis of Resealing—Cells cultured in 35-mm dishes were subjected to laser wounding at 37 °C in the presence of FM-143 dye, and dye uptake and/or GFP fluorescence were monitored by time lapse image acquisition and image analysis, all as described previously (18McNeil P.L. Miyake K. Vogel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4592-4597Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Immunostaining—Subconfluent cultures of cells grown in glass slide wells were scratched with a syringe needle (31-guage) in the presence of FDx (1 mg/ml, 10 kDa). Fixative (4% formaldehyde in PBS) was then added immediately, and the cells were processed further by standard methods for intracellular immunostaining with the anti-annexin A1 antibody (see above) as described previously (19Miyake K. McNeil P.L. Suzuki K. Tsunoda R. Sugai N. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3487-3494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of Plasma Membrane Resealing by Annexin A1-interfering Reagents—We first employed anti-annexin A1 antibody to interfere specifically with intracellular activities of the protein. The most common approach for utilizing an antibody to disrupt protein functioning in vivo is to load it into cell cytosol, for example by microinjecting or scrape-loading it, and then to assess the effect on the cell response in question. For this purpose we developed a miniaturized version of the scrape-loading technique, applicable to cell cultures growing in 96-well plates and consuming less than 10 μl of a valuable reagent such as an antibody. Its efficiency, measured as the percentage of cells successfully “loaded” with a membrane-impermeant dye, FDx (10 kDa), was comparable with that obtained using a much larger culture format (6-well plate) and volume (200 μl) of loading reagent (Fig. 1A). Moreover, in terms of its consumption of reagent, measured as the mean fluorescence level obtainable in a populations cultured in the larger or smaller format plates and scraped in identical amounts of this dye, it was clearly superior: a 3-fold higher level of fluorescence was obtained when the miniaturized technique was employed (Fig. 1B). We suggest that scrape loading is now comparable in its economic consumption of a valuable reagent to microinjection, yet scrape loading remains capable of rapidly loading thousands of cells in one simple maneuver that requires a minimal amount of equipment and skill. This miniaturized scrape-loading technique could therefore find widespread use as a superior method for economically loading into living cells membrane-impermeant reagents such as antibodies, DNA and RNA. When we attempted scrape loading of annexin A1 antibody mixed with a 156-kDa FDx as a loading marker, no brightly fluorescent, FDx-positive BS-C-1 cells were observed microscopically 3-5 h later (data not shown). By contrast, in control populations scraped in control antibody, numerous heavily labeled cells could be seen; these had suffered large disruptions, admitting a significant quantity of a large macromolecule (156-kDa), and resealed, trapping that macromolecule in their cytosol. The failure to obtain FDx-positive cells when the scraping was carried out in the presence of anti-annexin A1 antibody prevented us, as intended, from using a microscopic, laser-based resealing assay (18McNeil P.L. Miyake K. Vogel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4592-4597Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); the requisite population, heavily loaded with anti-annexin A1 antibody, was not present. However, it suggested that the antibody might have an effect on repair of the disruption through which it was entering and that the most heavily wounded cells in the population were failing to reseal and hence to trap the FDx. To test this possibility quantitatively, cells were scraped in saline containing anti-annexin A1 antibody and FDx or containing FDx only, and the populations analyzed immediately by FACS. Wounded cells that failed to reseal could be stained post-injury by the addition of PI, a membrane-impermeant nuclear stain that enters through the disruption. Contrastingly, those wounded cells that succeeded at resealing retained, behind a restored permeability barrier, FDx that entered into cell cytosol through the disruption. FACS revealed that populations scraped in the presence of antibody contained almost twice as many PI-positive cells as those scraped in a control, irrelevant antibody (Fig. 2A). Moreover, cells scraped in anti-annexin A1 antibody failed to trap FDx (Fig. 2B). Thus two independent measures, cell permeability to PI and FDx trapping, indicated that antibody-mediated perturbation of annexin A1 potently inhibits resealing. Annexin A1 has two well characterized domains of potential importance for its normal functioning. One is the “N-terminal interaction domain,” an N-terminal sequence of ∼40 residues that is unique in annexin A1 and binds several proteins including S100A11, a member of the S100 family (12Gerke V. Creutz C.E. Moss S.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). Peptides of the N-terminal interaction domain have previously been shown to disrupt interactions of annexins with specific protein ligands, and perhaps most importantly for the present study, the N-terminal domain is required for annexin A1 membrane aggregation activity (20Wang W. Creutz C.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next employed as a potential function-inhibiting reagent a peptide comprising the N-terminal 1-13 residues of annexin A1. This peptide contains the S100A11 binding site and has been shown to interact specifically with S100A11 (21Seemann J. Weber K. Gerke V. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Resealing of HeLa cells after scraping was Ca2+-dependent (Fig. 3A, left panel). When HeLa cells were scraped in the presence of annexin A1 peptide (Ac-(1-13)), the level of PI staining was significantly increased above control levels, and this differential effect was also Ca2+-dependent (Fig. 3A, right panel). The inhibitory effect of the N-terminal peptide on resealing was not observed when cells were scraped in a control peptide consisting of a scrambled sequence of the amino acid residues present in the inhibitory peptide (Fig. 3B). These results further support the possibility that annexin A1 is involved in the resealing response and suggest, moreover, that its interaction with other proteins, mediated through its N-terminal sequence, is crucial to this role. A Ca2+-insensitive Annexin A1 Mutant Protein Dominantly Inhibits Plasma Membrane Resealing—A second annexin A1 domain, of special relevance for a Ca2+-activated response such as resealing, is the Ca2+-binding core domain. To investigate the potential role of this domain, a HeLa cell clone was generated that expressed high levels (Fig. 4A, lower left panel) of a mutant annexin A1 incapable of Ca2+ binding (Cmanx1) linked to GFP. Cmanx1-GFP would be predicted to act in a dominant-negative fashion as an inhibitor of endogenous annexin A1 function by engaging in protein interactions through the N-terminal domain but not linking them to Ca2+ signaling (16Rescher U. Zobiack N. Gerke V. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3931-3938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that, unlike HeLa cells expressing wild type annexin GFP (Wtanx1; Fig. 4A, left upper panel), Cmanx1-GFP expressing cells (accompanying left lower panel) do not display Ca2+-sensitive resealing; approximately equal numbers of Cmanx1-GFP cells were PI-positive whether or not Ca2+ was present (Fig. 4A, right panel). We also assessed, as described above for the antibody experiments, the ability of Cmanx1-GFP-expressing cells to trap (by resealing a large disruption) a large macromolecule, in this case TRDx (70 kDa). Fluorescence labeling resulting from scraping in TRDx was significantly diminished in Cmanx1-GFP cells relative to non-transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 4B). Finally, using a laser to create disruptions, we compared resealing of Cmanx1-GFP BS-C-1 cells with that of nontransfected cells. In this assay, staining of internal membranes due to entry of an otherwise membrane-impermeant dye, FM-143, was monitored microscopically over time after the laser disruption (3Bansal D. Miyake K. Vogel S.S. Groh S. Chen C.C. Williamson R. McNeil P.L. Campbell K.P. Nature. 2003; 423: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). Resealing blocks further dye entry through a disruption and hence halts cell staining. Measured whole cell fluorescence therefore plateaus if a cell succeeds at resealing. Entry of FM-143 dye into Cmanx1-GFP-positive BS-C-1 cells was far more extensive than into wild type cells (Fig. 4C). Moreover, dye entry into the mutant cells continued throughout the time course measured, whereas in Y-type cells it plateaued at ∼20 s post-laser wounding, indicating resealing completion at this time point. Together, these three measurements in two different cell types strongly confirm the involvement of annexin A1 in resealing. They additionally suggest that the Ca2+-binding domain of this protein is crucial for this role. Annexin A1 Redistributes to Sites of Membrane Disruption— Given the apparent importance of the Ca2+-binding domain in resealing, and knowing that Ca2+ activates phospholipid binding of annexin A1, we predicted that a redistribution of annexin A1 from the cytosol onto local membranes would occur at disruption sites. Previous studies (11Lennon N.J. Kho A. Bacskai B.J. Perlmutter S.L. Hyman B.T. Brown Jr., R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50466-50473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) demonstrate an association of dysferlin and annexin A1 in uninjured skeletal muscle cells but did not test this more important prediction of wound-induced relocalization of annexin A1. To this end, we scratched monolayers of HeLa and BS-C-1 cells with a syringe needle in the presence of FDx and then rapidly (<10 s later) added fixative to the cultures prior to immunostaining with anti-annexin A1 antibody. This injury to the culture, denudation of linear stripes of cells, also caused injury to individual cells, specifically those lining the denuded site, many of whom were hit by the needle but not fully dislodged (22Swanson J.A. McNeil P.L. Science. 1987; 238: 548-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This antibody stains a single band of the approximate molecular weight of annexin A1 in a Western analysis of whole cell lysates and does not cross-react with annexin A2 (data not shown). No staining was observed when the fluorescently tagged secondary antibody only was used for immunostaining (not shown). Distinct “hot spots” of annexin A1 antibody staining were observed in a subset of the cells in wounded cultures (Fig. 5A). This hot spot-positive subset of cells consisted entirely of FDx-positive, e.g. wounded, cells. Moreover, the hot spots were located within the wounded cells at presumptive sites of membrane disruption, e.g. on the cell boundaries nearest the scratch site where they were hit with the needle. Cells not wounded, e.g. FDx-negative, displayed a very uniform, presumably cytosolic fluorescence. In addition to marking wounded cells, FDx also conveniently served in this experiment as marker of cell thickness. Therefore, in ratio (Fig. 5A, Merged) images of the FDx (green)- and antibody (red)-generated fluorescence, yellow/red labeling indicates sites of annexin A1 concentration and not sites where a change in cell thickness had occurred, an artifact often overlooked in immunostaining studies of this type (23Bright G.R. Fisher G.W. Rogowska J. Taylor D.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 30: 157-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). To examine the kinetics of this wound-induced annexin A1 redistribution, we imaged living BS-C-1 cells expressing annexin A1-GFP during the creation of disruptions with a laser. A transient increase in annexin A1-GFP fluorescence that, curiously, swept as a wave through cytoplasm toward the disruption site (see supplemental movie M1), as well as punctate staining, was observed during the interval ∼2-20 s after creation of a disruption (Fig. 5B). Simultaneous imaging of FM-143 influx in such cells (see supplemental movies M2 and M3) indicated that resealing was taking place during this interval (Fig. 4C provides a quantitative indication of resealing kinetics). Importantly, in contrast with cells expressing Wtanx1-GFP, those expressing Cmanx1-GFP (supplemental movie M4) or GFP alone (not shown) did not exhibit a transient increase in brightness at disruption sites; instead, a uniform loss of fluorescence was observed (supplemental movie M4) in the Cmanx1-GFP cells that failed to reseal (as indicated by heavy internal staining with FM-143 dye, supplemental movies M5 and M6; see also Fig. 4C). Annexins, as we have already mentioned, are known to promote Ca2+-dependent membrane aggregation and fusion in vitro, and annexins A1 and A2 have been found to associate with dysferlin. This has lead to speculation that annexins might have a role in resealing (11Lennon N.J. Kho A. Bacskai B.J. Perlmutter S.L. Hyman B.T. Brown Jr., R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50466-50473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), but no functional and structural evidence was available to support this hypothesis. Such functional data are now provided by three independent approaches. Using an inhibitory antibody, a peptide competitor, and a dominant-negative mutant protein to disrupt annexin A1 function, as well as three independent resealing assays, we demonstrate here a requirement for annexin A1 in resealing responses. We propose that Ca2+ entering through a plasma membrane disruption causes cytosolic annexin A1 to bind to membranes surrounding the disruption site and thereby initiates the homotypic and exocytotic membrane fusion events of resealing. Of particular relevance to our work, because they document a role for annexins in homotypic and exocytotic fusion events involving membranes of relevance to resealing, are the following studies. Annexin A1 was identified as the cytosolic factor that, in a Ca2+-dependent fashion, aggregates isolated neutrophil-specific granules and promotes exocytotic fusion with the plasma membrane (24Francis J.W. Balazovich K.J. Smolen J.E. Margolis D.I. Boxer L.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 25Meers P. Mealy T. Pavlotsky N. Tauber A.I.

Acta. 1993; 1147: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Oshry L. Meers P. Mealy T. Pavlotsky N. Tauber A.I. Trans. Assoc. Am.

Annexin A2 has been shown, using inhibitory antibodies and peptide competitors, to be required for Ca2+-activated, homotypic fusion of endosomes, which have been implicated as an internal membrane source for resealing (29Mayorga L.S. Beron W. Sarrouf M.N. Colombo M.I. Creutz C. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30927-30934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibitors of phosholipase A2 block fusion among endosomes both in vitro and in vivo, and this block that can be overcome in vitro by the addition of arachidonic acid (30Mayorga L.S. Colombo M.I. Lennartz M. Brown E.J. Rahman K.H. Weiss R. Lennon P.J. Stahl P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10255-10259Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Finally, annexin A1 is required for the generation of internal vesicle of multivesicular endosomes, which requires budding and fusion events at the limiting membrane (15White I.J. Bailey L.M. Aghakhani M.R. Moss S.E. Futter C.E. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Ca2+ entering through a disruption, it should be pointed out, is also predicted to activate cytosolic phospholipase A2, with consequent generation of arachidonic acid, which can promote annexin-mediated fusion events (31Yawo H. Kuno M. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 1626-1632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Yawo H. Kuno M. Science. 1983; 222: 1351-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been known for some time that resealing can be blocked by a cytosolic phospholipase A2 inhibitor. Therefore, resealing may depend on the activation not only of annexin A1 but also of cytosolic phospholipase A2. A unique aspect of the fusion mechanism we are proposing is the cytosolic localization of a key protein component, annexin A1, at the time of receipt of the Ca2+ signal. We propose that following the recruitment of annexin A1 from this location onto membranes surrounding the disruption site, it would then promote the homotypic and exocytotic membrane fusion events required for resealing. Importantly, this initial cytosolic location maximizes the availability of annexin A1, a desirable attribute for an emergency fusion response whose location and timing are not predictable. Consistent with this recruitment model, our immunolocalization and GFP analysis clearly show that annexin A1 becomes concentrated during resealing at plasma membrane disruption sites. This recruitment-based mechanism differs fundamentally from that proposed to mediate rapid Ca2+-regulated fusion events such as synaptic exocytotic events. These and other rapid, regulated exocytotic responses that occur at a predicable location in a polarized cell are hypothesized to depend upon the erection, prior to receipt of the fusion triggering Ca2+ signal, of an elaborate network of interacting proteins between the exocytotic vesicle and plasma membranes (33Chapman E.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 498-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the simple mechanism proposed here can explain how a rapid, emergency fusion response can be elicited whenever and wherever needed. It does not rely on an elaborate complex of proteins preassembled in advance of receipt of the Ca2+ trigger, such as is present at the synapse, the classical example of a rapid, Ca2+-initiated fusion response. Instead, we propose that emergency-based fusion utilizes a protein apparatus erected in response to the Ca2+ signal and derived from components such as annexin A1 recruited locally from the cytosol. Fusion via this recruitment mechanism is inherently flexible as regards timing and locale, which explains how an unpredictable event such as resealing can be fusion-based.

https://openalex.org/W1993012149,"ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is known to mediate cholesterol efflux to lipid-poor apolipoprotein A-I. In addition, ABCA1 has been shown to influence functions of the plasma membrane, such as endocytosis and phagocytosis. Here, we report that ABCA1 expression results in a significant redistribution of cholesterol and sphingomyelin from rafts to non-rafts. Caveolin, a raft/caveolae marker also redistributes from punctate caveolae-like structures to the general area of the plasma membrane upon ABCA1 expression. Furthermore, we observed significant reduction of Akt activation in ABCA1-expressing cells, consistent with raft disruption. Cholesterol content in the plasma membrane is, however, not altered. Moreover, we provide evidence that a non-functional ABCA1 with mutation in an ATP-binding domain, A937V, fails to redistribute cholesterol, sphingomyelin, or caveolin. A937V also fails to influence Akt activation. Finally, we show that apolipoprotein A-I preferentially associates with non-raft membranes in ABCA1-expressing cells. Our results thus demonstrate that ABCA1 causes a change in overall lipid packing of the plasma membrane, likely through its ATPase-related functions. Such reorganization by ABCA1 effectively expands the non-raft membrane fractions and, consequentially, pre-conditions cells for cholesterol efflux.

This process is absent in Tangier disease, due to mutations in ABCA1 (1Brooks-Wilson A. Marcil M. Clee S.M. Zhang L.H. Roomp K. van Dam M. Yu L. Brewer C. Collins J.A. Molhuizen H.O. Loubser O. Ouelette B.F. Fichter K. Ashbourne-Excoffon K.J. Sensen C.W. Scherer S. Mott S. Denis M. Martindale D. Frohlich J. Morgan K. Koop B. Pimstone S. Kastelein J.J. Hayden M.R. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 336-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). Without a functional ABCA1, apoA-I is rapidly catabolized, leading to cholesterol accumulation in peripheral tissues and low plasma high density lipoprotein. ABCA1 therefore plays a key role in cholesterol efflux to lipid-poor lipoproteins, such as apoA-I. There has been considerable debate as to whether ABCA1 mediates apoA-I acquisition of phospholipids and cholesterol separately or simultaneously. In a “two-step model,” lipid-poor apoA-I firstly forms a high affinity complex with ABCA1 (2Fitzgerald M.L. Morris A.L. Rhee J.S. Andersson L.P. Mendez A.J. Freeman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33178-33187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 3Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), which facilitates apoA-I association with phospholipid-rich domains. Second, this phospholipid-primed apoA-I acquires cholesterol from cholesterol-rich domains, a process thought to be independent of ABCA1. On the other hand, Smith et al. (5Smith J.D. Le Goff W. Settle M. Brubaker G. Waelde C. Horwitz A. Oda M.N. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) reported that ABCA1 mediates concurrent efflux of phospholipid and cholesterol. These contrasting models demonstrate that the mechanism by which ABCA1 mediates lipid efflux to apoA-I has yet to be clarified. Interestingly, the plasma membrane bilayer is thought to contain a mosaic of tightly packed lipid microdomains termed “lipid rafts.” Commonly defined based on their insolubility in non-ionic detergents, these microdomains contain high concentrations of cholesterol, sphingolipids, caveolin, and many proteins involved in cell signaling. In terms of apoA-I-mediated efflux, these microdomains represent a conceptually attractive “in situ” reservoir of cholesterol in the plasma membrane. Despite their enrichment in cholesterol, however, these domains do not seem to play a major role in efflux, because apoA-I was shown to preferentially acquire cholesterol from the loosely packed, “non-raft” microdomains (6Drobnik W. Borsukova H. Bottcher A. Pfeiffer A. Liebisch G. Schutz G.J. Schindler H. Schmitz G. Traffic. 2002; 3: 268-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 7Mendez A.J. Lin G. Wade D.P. Lawn R.M. Oram J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3158-3166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). ABCA1 itself also appears to be localized in Triton X-100-soluble fractions (non-rafts) (7Mendez A.J. Lin G. Wade D.P. Lawn R.M. Oram J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3158-3166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). It is far from clear whether non-rafts are required for ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux. Indeed, recent work performed by Duong and colleagues (8Duong P.T. Collins H.L. Nickel M. Lund-Katz S. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 832-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) further revealed a need for a better understanding of the relative contribution of these microdomains to the ABCA1-mediated formation of nascent high density lipoprotein particles. Aside from cholesterol efflux, ABCA1 has been linked to several functions on the plasma membrane, such as phagocytosis, endocytosis, and microvesiculation (9Alder-Baerens N. Muller P. Pohl A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 39476-39483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These findings collectively imply that ABCA1 exerts significant influence on the plasma membrane. It is however unclear whether ABCA1 influences raft/non-raft partition and, consequently, how this may affect apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux. An attractive concept would be that ABCA1 actively disrupts the raft microdomains and makes cholesterol more readily available, thus facilitating cholesterol-apoA-I interaction and efflux. To test this possibility, we analyzed in detail the impact of ABCA1 expression on membrane micro-organizations. We observed that ABCA1 disrupts microdomains (rafts) and redistributes cholesterol/sphingomyelin to non-raft domains. ABCA1 also disrupts caveolae formation. Consequently, ABCA1 expression impairs EGF-induced Akt activation, a process known to be sensitive to raft integrity (13Zhuang L. Lin J. Lu M.L. Solomon K.R. Freeman M.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2227-2231PubMed Google Scholar). We also provide evidence that this membrane reorganization is dependent on a functional nucleotide binding domain of ABCA1, suggesting involvement of ATPase-related functions in membrane reorganization. Furthermore, we observed preferential association of apoA-I with the non-raft fraction of the plasma membrane. Our results thus provide a potential mechanism by which ABCA1 facilitates apoA-I cell association and cholesterol efflux by disrupting the tightly packed lipid raft microdomains. Material and Reagents—Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells stably expressing either an empty vector (mock) or ABCA1 under the control of a mifepristone-inducible Gene-switch promoter were prepared as described previously (14Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1373-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To facilitate morphological analysis, we further subcloned ABCA1 or mutant cells and chose the colonies that express equal levels of ABCA1 among individual cells. Cell culture media and reagents were from Invitrogen. Mifepristone, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, and Triton X-100 were purchased from Sigma. A cholesterol kit was from VWR International (West Chester, PA). Polyclonal antibody against ABCA1 was from Novus Biological Inc. (Littleton, CO). Anti-caveolin antibodies were from BD Transduction Laboratories. Polyclonal anti-Akt antibody (C-20) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and polyclonal anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Fluorescent secondary antibodies and DiIC18 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). YFP-caveolin is a C-terminally YFP-tagged caveolin 1 and was reported to traffic similarly to caveolin-GFP that transports to caveolae identically to untagged caveolin (15Pol A. Martin S. Fernandez M.A. Ingelmo-Torres M. Ferguson C. Enrich C. Parton R.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2091-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). YFP-caveolin was obtained originally from Dr. Robert G. Parton (University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia). Cell Culture—BHK cells were maintained in DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Incubating cells for 18-20 h in DMEM with 1 mg/ml BSA and 10 nm mifepristone induced ABCA1 expression. Mock or mutant cells were treated identically as controls. Endogenous Caveolin-1 Distribution—ABCA1- and mock-expressing BHK cells were grown to near confluence in glass bottom dishes and incubated for 18-20 h in DMEM containing 1 mg/ml BSA and 10 nm mifepristone. Endogenous caveolin-1 was visualized using a plasma membrane-specific mouse monoclonal antibody against caveolin-1 followed by incubation with an Alexa-488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. Confocal fluorescent images of the basal membrane were taken using a Nikon TE300 inverted fluorescent microscope with a 60× (numerical aperture, 1.4) objective and the 488 nm line of an argon ion laser. Cholesterol Mass Determination—Cellular lipids were extracted by organic solvent and dried under N2. The dry samples were directly resuspended by vigorous vortexing in 500 μl of the Free Cholesterol E reagent supplied with the cholesterol mass determination kit (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA), incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and the absorbance was determined at 600 nm. The Triton X-100-extractable cholesterol fraction was calculated as % cholesterol as follows: (Triton X-100-soluble fraction)/(Triton X-100-soluble fraction + Triton X-100-insoluble fraction). Triton X-100 Extraction—Mifepristone-induced 75% confluent BHK cells grown in 6-well plates were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and chilled on ice for 30 min in DMEM containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. The medium was then replaced with 1 ml/well DMEM/Hepes in the presence or absence 1% Triton X-100 and further incubated on ice for 30 min. The medium was then collected, and the first wash with 500 μl of ice-cold PBS was combined with the medium. Lipids were then extracted overnight at 4 °C by adding 4 volumes of Folch solution (chloroform/methanol (2:1)). The organic phase was collected and evaporated under N2 atmosphere. Lipids were also extracted twice from cells in 1 ml/well of a 3:2 hexane:isopropanol solution, and the organic phase was evaporated under N2 atmosphere as described previously. For labeling free and esterified cholesterol, cells were labeled for 48 h with 1 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol. After Triton X-100 treatment, tritiated samples were separated by high-performance thin layer chromatography (Whatman) using a 80:20:6.7:1 hexane:ether:methanol:acetic acid mixture as the elution system. For 3H-labeled phospholipids, half-confluent cells were labeled for 24 h with 1 μCi/ml [3H]choline and the elution system was composed of chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:formic acid:water (35:15:6:2: 1). Spots corresponding to cholesteryl ester, free cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin were scraped and counted in a β-scintillation counter. Cholesterol Efflux—BHK cells were incubated in normal growing media (DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum) with 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol for 2 days to label cellular cholesterol to equilibrium. Cells were then switched to DMEM with 1 mg/ml BSA and 10 nm mifepristone for 18-20 h. To measure cholesterol efflux, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml apoA-I for 4 h at 37 °C. Medium was collected, centrifuged to remove detached cells, and counted for 3H. Cells were lysed with NaOH (0.5 n) overnight and counted for 3H. Cholesterol efflux was calculated as the percentage of total [3H]cholesterol released into the medium. For methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD)-induced cholesterol efflux, cells were also labeled with 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol for 2 days, followed by 18-20 h of incubation with 1 mg/ml BSA and 10 nm mifepristone. Cells were then incubated with 5 mm MCD either at 37 °C for 1 min or on ice for the indicated time. Medium was collected, centrifuged, and counted for [3H]cholesterol. Cell-associated [3H]cholesterol was measured from NaOH lysates as mentioned above. Efflux was again calculated as the percentage of total [3H]cholesterol released into the medium. Fluorescent Microscopy—For immunofluorescent staining of ABCA1, mutant, and mock-expressing BHK cells were incubated for 18-20 h in DMEM containing BSA and 10 nm mifepristone. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1 mg/ml saponin. ABCA1 was visualized by a primary polyclonal antibody against ABCA1 followed by an Alexa-488 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Confocal fluorescent images were taken using a Nikon TE2000 inverted fluorescent microscope with C1 confocal attachment and a 60× (numerical aperture, 1.4) objective. Images from ABCA1 and mock cells were taken under identical conditions. For caveolin distribution, ABCA1, mutant, and mock-expressing BHK cells were transiently transfected with YFP-caveolin using Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were then incubated overnight in DMEM/BSA plus mifepristone prior to fluorescent microscopic observations. For caveolin and ABCA1 co-localization experiments, an Alexa-594 secondary antibody and the 594 nm line of a HeNe laser were used. Filipin staining of cellular free cholesterol was performed as described previously (16Mukherjee S. Zha X. Tabas I. Maxfield F.R. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1915-1925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). DiIC18 Cold Triton X-100 Extractability—Cold Triton X-100 extractability of surface-bound DiIC18 on the plasma membrane was performed as described previously (17Hao M. Mukherjee S. Maxfield F.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13072-13077Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Cells were transferred from growth medium to Medium 1 (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 g/liter glucose, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). Lipid analogs were transferred as monomers from fatty acid-free BSA carriers (18Mukherjee S. Soe T.T. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1271-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In some of the experiments, DiIC18 in ethanol was directly added to labeling medium at 37 °C. In particular, cells were labeled with DiIC18 for 20 s at 37 °C, rinsed with ice-cold Medium 1, and then incubated on ice with cold Triton X-100 (1%) for 30 min. Triton X-100-resistant membranes were visualized by imaging DiIC18 using a standard rhodamine filter set. Images were quantified by manually outlining each cell using the ImageJ software, and measuring fluorescent intensity from entire cell area. This is the fraction of DiIC18 remaining after Triton X-100 treatment (insoluble fraction, Fi). To extrapolate DiIC18 fluorescent intensity before Triton X-100 in the same cell, we randomly sampled several regions of interest from areas excluding any visible holes and determined average of fluorescent intensities from these regions of interest. We used this to calculate fluorescent intensity before Triton X-100 treatment from the entire cell area, or total DiIC18 (Ft). The percentage of DiIC18 extracted by Triton X-100 (Fs) in each individual cell could then be calculated as: Fs = (Ft - Fi) × 100/Ft. For each data point, more than 50 individual cells were measured and pooled to produce an average and standard error of the mean (S.E.). Cy3-Transferrin Labeling of EYFP-Caveolin-1-transfected Cells—Mock, ABCA1, and A937V mutant cells were grown in 35-mm glass-bottom dishes and transfected with EYFP-caveolin-1 as described above. All cell lines were then incubated in DMEM with 1 mg/ml BSA and 10 nm mifepristone for 18 h. The cells were placed on ice and washed with ice-cold PBS. To stain the transferrin receptor on the cell surface, the cells were incubated with 80 ng/ml of Cy3-transferrin in Medium 1 for 30 min on ice. The cells were then washed 2× with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min on ice. Cy3-transferrin and plasma membrane EYFP-caveolin-1 were visualized using a Nikon TE2000 inverted fluorescent microscope with a 60× (numerical aperture, 1.4) objective. Fluorescence images were taken using a cooled digital camera (Cascade 512B EM, Photometrics). Detergent-free Purification of Caveolae Membrane—The procedure used was based on an established protocol by Smart et al. (19Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Mock, ABCA1, and A937V mutant cells were grown to 80% confluence in 20-cm plates (five per cell line), and incubated in DMEM with 1 mg/ml BSA and 10 nm mifepristone for 18 h to induce ABCA1 expression. All of the following steps were carried out at 4 °C. Plates were washed twice with 3 ml of ice-cold buffer A (250 mm sucrose, 2.0 mm EDTA, 40 mm Tricine, pH 7.8). Cells were then scraped and collected in 3 ml of buffer A. Pelletting of cells was performed by centrifugation at 1000 × g, for 5 min, in a Beckman Coulter Allegra 6R centrifuge. The pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A and homogenized with 20 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. Homogenates were transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei. After collection of supernatants, the pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A, and homogenization and centrifugation steps were repeated as described. Postnuclear supernatants from both homogenizations were combined (2 ml total) and layered onto 23 ml of 30% Percoll, and then centrifuged in a Ti-70 rotor at 86,000 × gmax for 30 min, using a Beckman Coulter Optima L-90K Ultracentrifuge. The Percoll gradient was then collected in 2-ml fractions, including the 2-ml plasma membrane band. The plasma membrane fractions were transferred to glass test tubes and sonicated, on ice, three times in succession for 10 s on setting 3 of a Branson Sonifier 450. The sonicated plasma membrane fractions were then combined with 1.84 ml of 50% Optiprep and 160 μl of buffer A, and placed in the bottom of SW41 tubes. After vortexing, a 6-ml continuous 20-10% Optiprep gradient was layered above the 4-ml plasma membrane preparations. Gradients were then centrifuged at 52,000 × g, for 90 min, in a Beckman SW41 rotor and Beckman Coulter Optima L-90K Ultracentrifuge. 10-ml Optiprep gradients were then collected in 1-ml fractions, and protein was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated. The pellets from all fractions were dissolved in sample buffer and loading buffer (60 μl of total volume) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. All fractions were probed for caveolin-1 and clathrin by Western blot. Subcellular [3H]Cholesterol Distribution—Mock, ABCA1, and A937V mutant cells were grown to 80% confluence in 20-cm plates (two for each cell line). Radiolabeling of the cellular cholesterol pool was performed by incubation with 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol for 24 h. Cells were then incubated in DMEM with 1 mg/ml BSA and 10 nm mifepristone for 18 h. All of the following steps were carried out at 4 °C. Plates were washed twice with 3 ml of ice-cold buffer A (250 mm sucrose, 2.0 mm EDTA, 40 mm Tricine, pH 7.8). Cells were then scraped and collected in 3 ml of buffer A. Pelletting of cells was performed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g, for 5 min, in a Beckman Coulter Allegra 6R centrifuge. The pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A, and then homogenized with 20 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. Homogenates were transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 1000 × g, for 10 min, in a Fischer Scientific accuSpin MicroR centrifuge, to remove nuclei. Postnuclear supernatant fractions were collected and completed to 2 ml with buffer A. 45-10% continuous sucrose gradients were formed in SW41 tubes, and the 2-ml postnuclear supernatant fractions were layered on top of the gradients. The gradients were subjected to centrifugation at 137,000 × g for 20 h at 4 °C. Each gradient was collected into 12 fractions (1 ml each). Equal volumes of each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting. Fractions were probed for the following cellular markers: caveolin-1 (plasma membrane), hsp-70 (cytosol), and calnexin (endoplasmic reticulum). [3H]Cholesterol levels in each fraction were analyzed by mixing 300 μl of sample with 2 ml of liquid scintillation mixture, and radioactivity was detected using a Beckman Coulter LS 6500 multipurpose scintillation counter. Determination of Akt Activation—The procedure used was based on a protocol developed by Pike et al. (20Pike L.J. Casey L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10315-10322Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Briefly, mock, ABCA1, and A937V mutant cells were grown to 80% confluence in 20-cm plates. Cells were incubated in DMEM with 1 mg/ml BSA and 10 nm mifepristone for 18 h. The use of serum-free DMEM effectively starved the cells during the 18-h incubation. Cells were then stimulated with 50 ng/ml EGF. The cells were washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS. Once again, all of the following steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice with 3 ml of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA), scraped, and collected in 3 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, supplemented with 100 μm orthovanadate, 20 nm p-nitrophenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Pelletting of cells was performed by centrifugation at 1000 × g, for 5 min, in a Beckman Coulter Allegra 6R centrifuge. The pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of supplemented radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and then homogenized with 20 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. Homogenates were transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were collected, and aliquots were assayed for protein. Equivalent amounts of protein were mixed with SDS loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Phospho-Akt (activated) was probed using a goat polyclonal antibody recognizing phosphorylated Akt1 (Ser-473). Total Akt was probed using a goat polyclonal antibody against Akt1 (C-20). Akt activation was expressed as a ratio of phospho-Akt1/total Akt1. 125I-ApoA-I Association—Purified plasma apoA-I (Biodesign) solubilized in 4 m guanidine-HCl was dialyzed extensively against PBS buffer. ApoA-I was iodinated with 125-iodine by IODO-GEN® (Pierce) to a specific activity of 2800 cpm/ng of apoA-I, dialyzed, and used within 48 h. Mifepristone-induced BHK cells were washed two times with DMEM and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in DMEM containing 10 μg/ml 125I-apoA-I. The medium was removed, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, chilled on ice for 30 min in DMEM plus 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and cold Triton X-100 extraction was performed. Cells were lysed with 0.5 n NaOH, and the protein concentration was determined by using the Lowry method. Radioactivity found in the medium and in the cells was determined by gamma counting. We hypothesized that ABCA1 modifies the plasma membrane raft/non-raft microdomains to facilitate apoA-I mediated efflux. To examine this, we used a BHK cell model stably transfected with a mifepristone-inducible plasmid containing an ABCA1 insert. A cell line containing identical mifepristone-inducible plasmid but without insert serves as control (Mock) (14Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1373-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These BHK cells do not normally express ABCA1. An 18- to 20-h induction led to ABCA1 expression (Fig. 1, A). The expression level of ABCA1 in these cells is comparable to that of cAMP-induced RAW264 macrophages and ∼5-fold higher than that in human THP-1 macrophages induced with 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and 9-cis-retinoic acid, as determined by immunoblot (data not shown). Accordingly, ABCA1-expressing BHK cells had a high efficiency to efflux cholesterol to apoA-I (Fig. 1B), comparable to RAW264 cells, which typically efflux ∼15% cholesterol in 4 h (21Takahashi Y. Smith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11358-11363Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) or THP cells (1.7% cholesterol in 2 h (22Kiss R.S. Maric J. Marcel Y.L. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1877-1887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)). These results indicate that wt ABCA1 expressed in BHK cells is fully functional. We then examined ABCA1 localization in BHK cells by immunofluorescent staining. We found that ABCA1 was mainly on the plasma membrane. Using confocal microscopy we took either a single slice (Fig. 2A, first and third columns) or serial images along the Z-axis that cover the whole cell volume and then project onto a single image (second and fourth columns). We observed that ABCA1 predominantly decorated the plasma membrane and projections (Fig. 2A), in agreement with previous reports using GFP-ABCA1 (10Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F.

J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23742-23747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Details of Z-stacks are shown in the supplement data. At steady state, ABCA1 can also be found intracellularly (first and second columns). These intracellular structures have the characteristics of the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi. To examine whether these ABCA1-containing intracellular structures represent the biosynthesis pathway that delivers ABCA1 to the plasma membrane, we treated cells with a general protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. We found that, when the biosynthesis pathway is blocked, ABCA1 can only be found on the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A, third and fourth columns, also see supplement data). This indicates that the intracellular portion at steady state most likely represents newly synthesized ABCA1 that transiently passes through these organelles. Furthermore, we examined free cholesterol in these cells and found that total free cholesterol mass was identical between Mock- and ABCA1-expressing cells (4.87 ± 0.88 μg/mg of protein versus 4.56 ± 0.77 μg/mg of protein, respectively). To rule out the possibility that cholesterol might be abnormally sequestered to some intracellular compartments in ABCA1 cells, which could significantly diminish cholesterol in the plasma membrane without apparent alteration in total cholesterol, we stained cells with filipin. We found that filipin staining patterns were comparable in all cell types (Fig. 2B), ensuring that ABCA1 expression did not alter either cholesterol content or subcellular distribution. Furthermore, we preformed cell fractionation in these cells to characterize the cholesterol distribution biochemically. Results, shown in Fig. 2C, demonstrate that the plasma membrane is peaked at fraction 7 as marked by caveolin and so is the cellular cho"
https://openalex.org/W2091355057,"4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), one of the major biologically active aldehydes formed during inflammation and oxidative stress, has been implicated in a number of cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders. 4-HNE has been shown to increase vascular endothelial permeability; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Hence, in the current study, we tested our hypothesis that 4-HNE-induced changes in cellular thiol redox status may contribute to modulation of cell signaling pathways that lead to endothelial barrier dysfunction. Exposure of bovine lung microvascular endothelial cells (BLMVECs) to 4-HNE induced reactive oxygen species generation, depleted intracellular glutathione, and altered cell-cell adhesion as measured by transendothelial electrical resistance. Pretreatment of BLM-VECs with thiol protectants, N-acetylcysteine and mercaptopropionyl glycine, attenuated 4-HNE-induced decrease in transendothelial electrical resistance, reactive oxygen species generation, Michael protein adduct formation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, activation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK, and actin cytoskeletal rearrangement. Treatment of BLMVECs with 4-HNE resulted in the redistribution of FAK, paxillin, VE-cadherin, β-catenin, and ZO-1, and intercellular gap formation. Western blot analyses confirmed the formation of 4-HNE-derived Michael adducts with the focal adhesion and adherens junction proteins. Also, 4-HNE decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK without affecting total cellular FAK contents, suggesting the modification of integrins, which are natural FAK receptors. 4-HNE caused a decrease in the surface integrin in a time-dependent manner without altering total α5 and β3 integrins. These results, for the first time, revealed that 4-HNE in redox-dependent fashion affected endothelial cell permeability by modulating cell-cell adhesion through focal adhesion, adherens, and tight junction proteins as well as integrin signal transduction that may lead dramatic alteration in endothelial cell barrier dysfunction during heart infarction, brain stroke, and lung diseases. 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), one of the major biologically active aldehydes formed during inflammation and oxidative stress, has been implicated in a number of cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders. 4-HNE has been shown to increase vascular endothelial permeability; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear.

The endothelium functions as a semipermeable barrier between plasma and interstitium to macromolecules and circulating blood components.

Recent studies have demonstrated a key role of 4-HNE in cardiovascular and lung disorders (5Uchida K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1685-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Experimental ischemia or ischemia/reperfusion has been shown to induce early generation of 4-HNE and protein modification in lung (6Compton C.N. Franko A.P. Murray M.T. Diebel L.N. Dulchavsky S.A. J. Trauma. 1998; 44: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or isolated rat heart (7Eaton P. Li J.M. Hearse D.J. Shattock M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H935-H943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Significant changes induced by 4-HNE in cells and tissues have been described under several conditions, such as ozone exposure (8Hamilton R.F. Li Jr., L. Eschenbacher W.L. Szweda L. Holian A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L8-L16PubMed Google Scholar) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (9Rahman I. van Schadewijk A.A. Crowther A.J. Hiemstra P.S. Stolk J. MacNee W. De Boer W.I. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care. Med. 2002; 166: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Infusion of 4-HNE (50 μm) into rat lungs has been shown to cause perivascular edema with vascular compression and early EC disruption (10Herbst U. Toborek M. Kaiser S. Mattson M.P. Hennig B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Treatment of human umbilical vein ECs with 4-HNE has been reported to increase albumin transport through cell monolayers (10Herbst U. Toborek M. Kaiser S. Mattson M.P. Hennig B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and to alter capillary permeability leading to disturbances in blood-brain barrier function (11Mertsch K. Blasig I. Grune T. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 314: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, the role of 4-HNE in EC barrier dysfunction and underlying cell signaling pathway(s) leading to permeability changes have not been well characterized. We have recently demonstrated that exposure of lung microvascular endothelial cells to 4-HNE (25-100 μm) mediated the activation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including p38 MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), cytoskeletal remodeling, and alterations in EC barrier function (12Usatyuk P.V. Natarajan V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11789-11797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). More-over, activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) by oxidative stress is an important event in ROS-mediated vascular EC barrier function that is regulated by cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts (13Usatyuk P.V. Natarajan V. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: L999-L1010Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Because 4-HNE not only forms Schiff base adducts with-NH2 residues of proteins (14Parinandi N.L. Scribner W.M. Vepa S. Shi S. Natarajan V. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 1999; 1: 193-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) but also alters cellular redox status due to loss of cellular sulfhydryl compounds (2Uchida K. Prog. Lipid Res. 2003; 42: 318-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar), in our present study, we investigated the mechanisms of redox regulation of 4-HNE-mediated EC barrier dysfunction. The present study shows that: (i) 4-HNE, in a dose-dependent fashion, modulates cell-cell adhesion contacts as measured by transendothelial electrical resistance (TER); (ii) thiol protectants, such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and mercaptopropionyl glycine (MPG), attenuate 4-HNE-mediated ROS formation, activation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK signaling pathways, Michael protein adduct formation, and cytoskeleton rearrangement; and (iii) 4-HNE affects focal adhesion, adherent and tight junction proteins in lung micro-vascular ECs involving integrin signal transduction.

Determination of EC GSH—GSH content in lysates of BLM-VECs was determined by using a glutathione assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, after 4-HNE treatment, cells were washed twice with PBS, collected with a rubber policeman into 0.3 ml of 50 mm MES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1mm EDTA, sonicated 2 × 10 s, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used immediately for GSH determination or stored at -20 °C. After protein estimation equal amounts of protein from each sample were treated for 5 min at room temperature with freshly prepared 10% meta-phosphoric acid for deproteination and centrifuged for 5 min at 2,000 × g, and supernatants were used for further analyses or stored at -20 °C. To determine GSH, the pH was adjusted with triethanolamine according to manufacturer protocol, and 40 mm 2-vinynylpiridine was added to inhibit color development in the assay mixture. Glutathione level was estimated by using the assay kit mixture that included 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid and glutathione reductase. After incubation for 25 min at room temperature, the absorbance was monitored at 405 nm in a plate reader. The GSH concentration was calculated from a glutathione standard curve and expressed as micromolar per mg of protein. Measurement of ROS in Endothelial Cells—4-HNE-induced ROS formation in cells was detected and quantified by fluorescence microscopy as described previously (12Usatyuk P.V. Natarajan V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11789-11797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Briefly, BLM-VECs (∼90% confluence) grown in 35-mm dishes were pre-treated with 1 mm NAC or MPG, or allopurinol (100 μm), rotenone (2 μm), apocynin (30 μm), or MitoTracker (50 nm, 15 min) in basal MEM and loaded with DCFDA (10 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C in a 95% air-5% CO2 environment. Following removal of medium containing DCFDA by careful aspiration, ECs were washed once with warm MEM and treated with 4-HNE as indicated. At the end of incubation, cells were washed twice with warm PBS and were examined under Nikon Eclipse TE 2000-S fluorescence microscope and pictures were captured on a Hamamatsu digital charge-coupled device camera (Japan) using a 20× objective lens. The fields were randomly chosen, and statistical analyses were performed by MetaVue software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Measurement of TER as an Index of Barrier Function—BLM-VECs were seeded on gold electrodes (eight wells, ten electrodes per well) to ∼95% confluence as described earlier (12Usatyuk P.V. Natarajan V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11789-11797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). TER was measured on a electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing system (ECIS, Applied Biophysics Inc.) as described previously (12Usatyuk P.V. Natarajan V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11789-11797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The total endothelial electrical resistance, as measured across the EC monolayers, was determined by the combined resistance between the basal and/or cell matrix adhesion (15Giaever I. Keese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7896-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 16Giaever I. Keese C.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 591-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). To estimate differences between cell-cell and cell-matrix components, total TER was resolved into values reflecting resistance to current flow beneath the cell layer (α) and resistance to current flow between adjacent cells (Rb), utilizing the method of Giaever and Keese (16Giaever I. Keese C.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 591-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), which models the endothelial monolayer mathematically. Preparation of Cell Lysates and Western Blotting—BLMVECs grown on 100-mm dishes to ∼95% confluence were pretreated with NAC or MPG in MEM for 1 h before stimulation with 25 μm 4-HNE as indicated. The cells were washed once in ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm orthovanadate, scraped into 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.5% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture). Cell lysates were prepared by sonicating the cells (3 × 10 s) with a probe sonicator and subsequent centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Protein content in cell lysates was determined by protein assay (Pierce Chemicals). For preparation of immunoprecipitates, cell lysates (0.5-1 mg of protein/ml) were mixed, with appropriate antibodies at 4 °C for 18 h. Protein A/G (20 μl) was then added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The antibody complex was obtained as a pellet by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was washed thrice in ice-cold PBS for further SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein (1 mg/ml) or immunoprecipitates, following dissociation in Laemmli buffer by boiling for 5 min, were loaded onto 10% gels and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes by electro-blotting, blocked for 1 h with TBST (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and probed with primary and secondary antibodies according to the manufacturer's protocol and immunodetected by enhanced chemiluminescence's kit (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were scanned (UMAX Power Look II) and quantified by automated digitizing system UN-SCAN-IT GEL (Silk Scientific Corp.). Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—BLMVECs grown on coverslips or 8-well glass slide chambers to ∼95% confluence were treated as indicated in the figures, rinsed twice with PBS, and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Then cells were rinsed three times with PBS and permeabilized for 5 min with 0.25% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.01% Tween 20 (TBST). After washing, cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in TBST blocking buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer for 1 h. Cells were thoroughly rinsed with TBST (3 × 5 min) followed by staining with Alexa Fluor 488 or 568 (1:200 dilution in blocking buffer, 1 h) as secondary antibodies. Actin stress fibers were determined by staining the cells on coverslips with Alexa Fluor Phalloidin 568. Slides were prepared with mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, cat. no. H-1200) to stain nucleus. Cells were examined by Nikon Eclipse TE 2000-S fluorescence microscope with a Hamamatsu digital camera (Japan) using a 60× oil immersion objective and MetaVue software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Confocal images were captured using a 63×, numerical aperture 1.3 glycerol objective on a Leica SP2 AOBS system with 405 and 488 nm excitation lines and narrow bandwidths for 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and Alexa Fluor 488 with identical gain settings between samples using Leica software (Exton, PA). Color overlays and three-dimensional reconstructions were created using ImageJ (Wayne Rasband). Flow Cytometry—BLMVECs grown on 35-mm dishes to ∼95% confluence were treated with 25 μm 4-HNE for different time intervals in serum-free media, washed twice with 2 ml of PBS, and then cells were detached with 0.3 ml of Accutase. Integrin staining with FITC-conjugated integrin αvβ3 complex was performed according to manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cell suspension was centrifuged (5 min, 500 × g), pellets were resolved in 0.2 ml of PBS, and the mixture was incubated in the dark for 20 min at room temperature in the presence of 10 μl of FITC-conjugated anti-integrin antibody. Then cells were centrifuged and washed trice with PBS. Finally, pellets were resuspended in 0.3 ml of PBS and analyzed on Cyan ADP flow cytometer (DakoCytomation, Ft. Collins, CO) equipped with a 488 nm laser and 530/40 band pass filter for FITC emission. 10,000 live cells were collected and analyzed for FITC fluorescence. Post-acquisition analysis was done with Flowjo analysis software (Treestar, Ashland, OR). A region was set around live cells, FITC fluorescence of the live cells was plotted on a histogram, and the median fluorescence intensity was recorded for each data file. Statistics—Analysis of variance with Student-Newman-Keel's test was used to compare two or more different treatment groups. The level of significance was taken to be p < 0.05 unless otherwise stated. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. 4-HNE Modulates Cell-Cell Adhesion Contacts—4-HNE is one of the major biologically active aldehydes generated from peroxidation of membrane lipids (1Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5867) Google Scholar). We and others have been shown that 4-HNE causes actin cytoskeleton remodeling, MAPK activation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and EC barrier disruption (12Usatyuk P.V. Natarajan V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11789-11797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 17Gadoni E. Olivero A. Miglietta A. Bocca C. Gabriel L.

Med. 2004; 37: 937-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that exposure of ECs to oxidant stress modulates barrier function through the changes in cell-cell adhesion interactions (13Usatyuk P.V. Natarajan V. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: L999-L1010Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the mechanism(s) of 4-HNE-mediated EC barrier dysfunction, BLMVECs were challenged with varying concentrations of 4-HNE (10, 25, and 50 μm), and relative contributions of intercellular junctions and focal adhesions were resolved to Rb (cell-cell) and α (cell-matrix). As shown in Fig. 1A, decrease in TER was due to changes in Rb with minimal contributions due to α. Specificity of 4-HNE on TER Changes and ROS Production in Endothelial Cells—In addition to 4-HNE, lipid peroxidation generates other aldehydes of varying chain lengths. Therefore, we examined the specificity of 4-HNE effects on TER and ROS generation. BLMVECs were challenged with 4-HNE or trans-2-nonenal or nonanal, and as shown in Fig. 1B, only 4-HNE, but not trans-2-nonenal or nonanal, caused EC barrier dysfunction. Furthermore, 4-HNE enhanced ROS production as measured by DCFDA oxidation (Fig. 2), which is consistent with the previously reported study on 4-HNE-mediated ROS production in ECs (48Bianchi M. De Lucchini S. Vietri M. Villa-Moruzzi E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 272: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 52Landar A. Zmijewski J.W. Dickinson D.A. Legoffe C. Johnson M. Milne G. Zanoni G. Vidari G. Morrow J. Darley-Usmar V.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: H1777-H1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the presence of a hydroxyl group at carbon 4, in addition to a trans double bond at carbon 2, is essential for maximal changes in TER and ROS production in ECs. Mitochondrial Electron Transport as the Source of 4-HNE-induced ROS in ECs—To address the possible sources of ROS generation we used specific inhibitors for xanthine oxidase (allopurinol), mitochondrial electron transport chain (rote-none), and NADPH-oxidase (apocynin). As shown in Fig. 3A, only rotenone significantly attenuated 4-HNE-mediated ROS production. Analysis of living cells by immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that 4-HNE enhanced the level of DCFDA oxidation, which colocalized with MitoTracker, a marker for mitochondria (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, pretreatment with rote-none attenuated the colocalization of green fluorescence of oxidized DCFDA with red fluorescence of MitoTracker (data not shown). These data are consistent with a recent study showing 4-HNE modulated an electrophile-dependent ROS production in mitochondria (52Landar A. Zmijewski J.W. Dickinson D.A. Legoffe C. Johnson M. Milne G. Zanoni G. Vidari G. Morrow J. Darley-Usmar V.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: H1777-H1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). 4-HNE Mediates Thiol Modification—As a highly reactive electrophile, 4-HNE may affect EC functions by depletion of cellular thiols, such as GSH (2Uchida K. Prog. Lipid Res. 2003; 42: 318-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 22Dickinson D.A. Forman H.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 973: 488-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Treatment of BLMVECs with 4-HNE, in dose- and time-dependent fashion, decreased intracellular GSH (Fig. 4). These results further demonstrate that 4-HNE caused depletion of cellular GSH and causes cellular thiol redox status in BLMVECs. Thiol-protective Agents Attenuate 4-HNE-induced ROS Production and EC Barrier Dysfunction—In our recent studies we have shown that 4-HNE (12Usatyuk P.V. Natarajan V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11789-11797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) or diamide (23Usatyuk P.V. Vepa S. Watkins T. He D.H. Parinandi N.L. Natarajan V. Antiox. Redox Signal. 2003; 5: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), an agent that oxidizes GSH to oxidized glutathione and protein thiols, in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, caused barrier dysfunction in lung microvascular EC monolayers. Therefore, we hypothesized that 4-HNE-induced ROS formation and changes in cellular thiols may contribute to the alteration of EC barrier function. To test this hypothesis, BLMVECs were pretreated with 1 mm NAC or MPG for 1 h prior to challenge with 4-HNE (25 μm). As shown in Fig. 5, NAC and MPG attenuated the 4-HNE-induced changes in ROS production (Fig. 5A) and cell-cell adhesion contacts (Fig. 5B). These data suggest the involvement of cellular thiol redox status in 4-HNE mediated barrier dysfunction in microvascular ECs. Effect of NAC and MPG on 4-HNE-mediated Michael Adduct Formation in ECs—One of the initial reactions of 4-HNE in cells is the protein modification by the formation of Michael adducts (7Eaton P. Li J.M. Hearse D.J. Shattock M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H935-H943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hamilton R.F. Li Jr., L. Eschenbacher W.L. Szweda L. Holian A. Am. J.

Shiraishi M. Naito Y. Torii Y. Nakamura Y. Osawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Exposure of BLMVECs to 4-HNE caused a 2-fold increase in the Michael adducts level as compared with the untreated control cells. When BLMVECs were pretreated with 1 mm NAC or MPG prior to treatment with 4-HNE, Michael adduct formation, as analyzed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy, was completely abolished (Fig. 6, A and B). These results demonstrate that 4-HNE induces Michael adduct formation in EC proteins, which is completely blocked by pretreatment of cells with thiol protectants, further suggesting that intracellular thiols are targets for 4-HNE leading to the formation of Michael adducts. Effect of NAC and MPG on 4-HNE-mediated Protein Tyrosine Phosphorylation and MAPK Activation—To elucidate the putative signal transduction mechanisms that promote 4-HNE-induced EC barrier dysfunction, we examined the ability of 4-HNE to induce protein tyrosine phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 7A, 4-HNE stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of EC proteins in the molecular mass range of 20-203 kDa, with intense phosphorylation around 35-40, 60-80, and 120-203 kDa. Both the thiol protectants, NAC and MPG, almost completely and significantly attenuated 4-HNE-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation in BLM-VECs, fu"

The purpose of this study was to isolate which SRs (macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO), CD204, or CD36) were involved using a variety of SR single and double null mice. The findings indicated that MARCO was the critical SR involved in silica uptake and cytotoxicity in the primary alveolar macrophages (AM) from C57BL/6 mice, as there was no particle uptake or cell death in the absence of this SR. The level of MARCO expression on AM changed significantly with the absence of other SR, and silica uptake was proportional to cell surface MARCO expression. In addition, silica uptake and cytotoxicity were completely blocked by an anti-mouse MARCO antibody. Transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells with human MARCO supported these conclusions, as silica particles bound to and initiated apoptosis in the MARCO-transfected cells. Strain differences with regard to SR distribution were also examined. There was a differential expression of these SR on AM from each strain, with MARCO dominant for C57BL/6, CD36 dominant on BALB/c, and all three SR expressed on 129/SvJ mice. Similar to the results with C57BL/6 AM, MARCO was involved with silica-induced cell death in the 129/SvJ strain. In contrast, BALB/c AM used an unidentified mechanism for silica uptake because the SR antibodies failed to block particle internalization. Taken together, these results indicate MARCO is the primary AM receptor interacting with silica, depending on mouse strain and level of constitutive expression.

Inhaled silica particles are a known initiator of several human pathologies including silicosis, autoimmune disorders, and possibly even lung cancer (1Peretz A. Checkoway H. Kaufman J.D. Trajber I.

This can lead to cell death in a fraction of the exposed cells, which may be the initial step in the disease process. Scavenger receptors (SR) on the surface of AM are one possible mechanism for the uptake and cell death signaling in the AM (3Kobzik L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 367-376PubMed Google Scholar).SR are transmembrane glycoproteins found on macrophages, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells that bind to a number of ligands including Gram-negative bacteria, apoptotic cells, oxidized low-density lipoproteins, and polyinosinic acid to name just a few (4Gough P.J. Gordon S. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The SR are divided into several different classes based on structure and function, but they all bind a broad range of ligands with polyanionic surface characteristics (5Murphy J.E. Tedbury P.R. Homer-Vanniasinkam S. Walker J.H. Ponnambalam S. Atherosclerosis. 2005; 182: 1-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The exact function of SR is still being determined, but they are believed to be an important feature of the innate immune response (6Hampton R.Y. Golenbock D.T. Penman M. Krieger M. Raetz C.R. Nature. 1991; 352: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) and they are generally up-regulated in the presence of infection (7Haworth R. Platt N. Keshav S. Hughes D. Darley E. Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Kodama T. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1431-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Due to the promiscuous nature of these receptors, multiple functions have been suggested including, but not limited to, endocytosis followed by receptor recycling, cell adhesion (8Platt N. Gordon S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), transcytosis, intracellular signaling (5Murphy J.E. Tedbury P.R. Homer-Vanniasinkam S. Walker J.H. Ponnambalam S.

(Noisy-le-Grand). 2004; 50: OL657-665PubMed Google Scholar), three splice variants of SR-A (CD204) (5Murphy J.E. Tedbury P.R. Homer-Vanniasinkam S. Walker J.H. Ponnambalam S.

Chem. 2006; 281: 11834-11845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). CD204 has been shown to be involved with the uptake of titanium dioxide (TiO2), silica, diesel particles, and latex beads in AM (3Kobzik L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 367-376PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, silica-induced apoptosis was demonstrated following the transfection of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with murine CD204 (13Hamilton R.F. de Villiers W.J. Holian A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2000; 162: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this instance, TiO2 was not toxic to the transfected CHO cells indicating a specific toxic response to silica particles, which was inhibited by known antagonists of CD204 (13Hamilton R.F. de Villiers W.J. Holian A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2000; 162: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Similarly, MARCO has been identified as the main binding receptor for unopsonized particles and bacteria on human AM using MARCO-transfected COS cells (14Arredouani M.S.

Med. 1999; 189: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and the presence of MARCO may be the frontline defense for pneumococcal pneumonia, and clearance of inhaled particles (16Arredouani M. Yang Z. Ning Y. Qin G. Soininen R. Tryggvason K. Kobzik L. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Despite the similarity in structure and function between MARCO and CD204, there is evidence that their regulation and signaling properties may be different. This is based on work with MARCO and CD204 null mice, where significant differences in peritoneal macrophage IL-12 production were observed following lipopolysaccharide and IFN-γ stimulation (17Jozefowski S. Arredouani M. Sulahian T. Kobzik L. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 8032-8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In additional findings, MARCO expression was increased by Th1 polarizing factors and decreased by Th2 polarizing agents. This pattern was reversed for CD204 expression indicating that these proteins are differentially regulated (17Jozefowski S. Arredouani M. Sulahian T. Kobzik L. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 8032-8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Murine strain differences in MARCO and CD204 expression have also been observed, with MARCO being the constitutively expressed SR in the C57BL/6 strain (9Palecanda A. Kobzik L. Curr. Mol. Med. 2001; 1: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 18Su S.H. Chen H. Jen C.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5084-5091Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In humans, the expression of MARCO under normal circumstances is relatively low compared with CD204, but it can be induced by a variety of stimulants including the presence of bacteria (17Jozefowski S. Arredouani M. Sulahian T. Kobzik L. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 8032-8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Class B SR include CD36, which is known to bind modified proteins (e.g. oxidized low density lipoprotein), and phosphatidylserine (9Palecanda A. Kobzik L. Curr. Mol. Med. 2001; 1: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). CD36 internalizes modified low density lipoproteins in a lipid raft-dependent and caveolin-independent process (19Zeng Y. Tao N. Chung K.N. Heuser J.E. Lublin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45931-45936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Similar to CD204, CD36 is one of the main receptors for internalizing oxidized low density lipoprotein in the macrophage cell (20Kunjathoor V.V. Febbraio M. Podrez E.A. Moore K.J. Andersson L.

Suarez Y. Lasuncion M.A. Vega M.A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 777-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is no reported evidence that unopsonized particles, such as silica, bind to the CD36 receptor (9Palecanda A. Kobzik L. Curr. Mol. Med. 2001; 1: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).This study was conducted to determine the relative contribution of these three SR (MARCO, CD204, and CD36) on the uptake and toxicity of silica particles by the murine AM, using single and double null mice on the C57BL/6 and 129/SvJ backgrounds. In addition, murine strain differences in the relative distribution of SR were examined. The primary hypothesis of this work is that MARCO mediates silica uptake and toxicity in the C57BL/6 mouse due to the fact that MARCO is the constitutively expressed SR on the AM. Second, murine strain differences in SR expression are examined to explain differential AM responses to silica particles.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMice—C57BL/6, BALB/c, and 129/SvJ mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). All SR null mice were on a C57BL/6 background. MARCO and MARCO/CD204 null breeder pairs were obtained from Dr. L. Kobzik (Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA). CD36 and CD36/CD204 null breeder pairs were obtained from Dr. M. Febbraio (Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH). Animals were housed in microisolators on a 12-h light/dark cycle. The mice were maintained on an ovalbumin-free diet and given deionized water ad libitum. Mice, 7-10 weeks of age, were used for all animal experiments. All animal procedures were approved by the University of Montana Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).Particles—Crystalline silica (min-U-sil-5), 1-5 μm in diameter from Pennsylvania Sand Glass Corp. (Pittsburgh, PA), was acid washed in 1 m HCl at 100 °C. The silica was then washed in sterile water three times and dried in an oven at 200 °C to remove all water. A stock suspension of 2.5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was generated before each experiment. The stock suspension was dispersed by sonic disruption for 1 min prior to use. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) was purchased from Fisher Scientific (catalog number T315-500), and used unprocessed.Alveolar Macrophage Isolation and Culture—Mice were euthanized by a lethal injection of Euthasol™. The lungs were removed with the heart and then lavaged with five 1.0-ml aliquots of cold PBS. Pooled cells were centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min. The lavage fluid was aspirated and discarded. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 culture media (Mediatech Inc., Herdon, VA) supplemented with antibiotics and antimycotics (Invitrogen). A 40-μl sample was counted using a Z1 Coulter Particle Counter (Beckman Coulter). The cells were adjusted to 106 per ml and added to 0.65-ml sterile polypropylene tubes at 500 μl/tube. The silica suspensions were added and the cells were cultured in a tumbling suspension culture for 4 h at 37 °C in a water-jacketed CO2 (5%) incubator (ThermoForma, Mariette, OH). In experiments where SR antibodies were used, the antibodies were added (10 μg/ml) 30 min prior to silica addition. The azide-free SR antibodies included anti-mouse MARCO (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), anti-mouse CD204 (Serotec, Raleigh, NC), and anti-mouse CD36 (BD Biosciences).Alveolar Macrophage Viability Assay—Isolated AM were cultured in suspension (106 cells/ml) with varying concentrations of silica for 4 h at 37°C. At the end of this period, 10 μl of the culture supernatant was removed and mixed with 10 μl of 0.4% trypan blue solution (Sigma). The resulting mixture was added to a hemacytometer and the cells were examined by light microscopy. One hundred random cells were counted per sample, and cells that appeared to contain blue dye were considered dead. Data were expressed as percent of cells excluding trypan blue dye (percent living cells).Alveolar Macrophage Apoptosis Assay—Apoptosis was determined using the Cell Death ELISA (Roche Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), and was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, isolated alveolar macrophages were cultured in suspension (106 cells/ml) with varying concentrations of silica for 4 h at 37°C.Attheendof this period 100 μl of the culture supernatant (105 cells) was removed, washed with PBS, and the resulting cell pellet was lysed with the buffer provided in the kit. The lysate was assayed in ELISA format for histone-bound DNA fragments. The optical density (OD) is read at 405 nm and the background was subtracted out of the final results. Data are expressed as the average OD ± S.E.Determination of Scavenger Receptor Expression on Alveolar Macrophages—Immediately following the AM isolation described above, the cells were exposed to Fc block (1:50) for 30 min at room temperature. Anti-F4-80 phycoerythrin (Caltag, Burlingame, CA) and anti-CD11c antigen-presenting cell (APC) (BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA) were then added to the cells at a 1:50 dilution along with the specific anti-mouse SR antibody (anti-MARCO fluorescein isothiocyanate at a 1:5 dilution (Serotec, Raleigh, NC), anti-CD204 fluorescein isothiocyanate at a 1:50 dilution (Serotec), or anti-CD36 Alexa 488 at a 1-50 dilution (BioLegend, San Diego, CA)) and allowed to incubate for 30 min at room temperature with agitation 2-3 times. Finally, AM were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS and analyzed immediately on a FACs Aria flow cytometer using FACs Diva software (BD Biosciences). Flow cytometric methods detected cells that were positive for SR, whereas gating on alveolar macrophages that were dual positive for the markers CD11c and F4-80.Quantification of Silica Binding and/or Uptake for Alveolar Macrophages—Use of flow cytometric side scatter properties to quantify cell/particle binding and uptake is described elsewhere (22Stringer B. Imrich A. Kobzik L. Cytometry. 1995; 20: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this study, following silica exposure for 1.5 h, the cells were exposed to Fc block (1:50) for 30 min at room temperature. Anti-F4-80 phycoerythrin (Caltag) and anti-CD11c APC (BD Pharmingen) were added to the cells at a 1:50 dilution and allowed to incubate for 30 min at room temperature with agitation 2-3 times. Finally, AM were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS and analyzed immediately on a FACs Aria flow cytometer using FACs Diva software (BD Biosciences). Flow cytometric methods detected silica uptake into the AM by assaying for changes in forward and side scatter properties while gating on AM that were dual positive for markers CD11c and F4-80 (23Crowell R.E. Heaphy E. Valdez Y.E. Mold C. Lehnert B.E. Exp. Lung Res. 1992; 18: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All AM retrieved by the lavage technique are positive for both markers. F4-80+/CD11c-cells indicates infiltrating monocytes, whereas F4-80-/CD11c+ cells are considered dendritic cells. The later two cell types, if present, were excluded from the analysis. There was no effect of SR deletion on the expression levels of either surface marker (cytometric scatterplots of WT versus MARCO null AM labeling are available in the supplemental data). Data are expressed as average side scatter intensity with arbitrary numerical units.Lymphocyte Isolation and Culture—OT-II transgenic mice on a C57BL/6 background were euthanized by a lethal injection of Euthasol™ and their spleens were removed and placed in Hank's buffered saline (Invitrogen) with 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Mediatech Inc., Herdon, VA) on ice. The spleens were ground up between two sterile frosted glass slides and filtered through sterile gauze into 50-ml centrifuge tubes. The cell suspension was centrifuged 200 × g for 10 min. The nucleated cell fraction was counted by lysing the red blood cells with Zap-oglobin reagent followed by the Z1 Coulter particle counter (Beckman Coulter, Hialeah, FL). The cell suspension was adjusted to 5 × 107 nucleated cells per ml in the media described above and the Spin Sep™ murine T cell enrichment (Stem Cell Biotechnology, Vancouver, BC, Canada) was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The resulting cell recovery was >96% CD 3 positive by FACS analysis. The T cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 culture media (Mediatech Inc., Herdon, VA) supplemented with antibiotics and antimycotics (Invitrogen) at 2 × 106 cells/ml.Antigen-presenting Cell Assay—Following a 1-h AM suspension culture ± silica (100 μg/ml) or TiO2 (50 μg/ml), the AM were plated in 96-well tissue culture plates (Costar, Corning, NY) at 5 × 104 cells/well and allowed to adhere. Ovalbumin (Sigma) antigen (10 mg/ml), or anti-CD3 antibody (5 μg/ml) was added. This mixture was incubated 2 h at 37 °C in a water-jacketed CO2 (5%) incubator (ThermoForma, Mariette, OH). The isolated transgenic T cells were added to each well at 2 × 105 cells/well. This mixture was incubated 48 h at 37 °C. After 2 days the 96-well plate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 3 min and the supernatant was retrieved and stored frozen at -20 °C in 0.65 polypropylene tubes until it could be assayed for cytokine levels.Cytokine Assays—Culture supernatants were assayed for cytokines with commercially available kits according to the manufacturer's protocol. Interferon γ (IFN-γ) measurements were determined by using Duo-set kits (R & D Systems). Samples were diluted 1:100. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) measurements were determined using Duo-set kits (R & D Systems). Samples were diluted 1:2. Colormetric analysis was performed with the Spectra Max 340 plate reader (GE Healthcare) at 450 nm. Data are expressed as picograms/ml of retrieved culture supernatant.Transfection of CHO Cells—CHO were cultured in Ham's F-12 (Mediatech Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum plus 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. CHO cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/well in a 6-well cell culture dish overnight and transiently transfected with 4 μg of pcDNA3.1 and hMARCO cDNA (generously provided by Dr. L. Kobzik), using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were harvested and used after 48 h. The cells were resuspended in PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide and 2% bovine serum albumin, and preincubated with or without primary monoclonal antibody PLK-1 (7 μg/ml) for 15 min on ice. The cells were then treated with TiO2 (25 μg/ml) or silica (150 μg/ml) and rotated at 37 °C for 30 min, placed on ice, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Binding of particles was measured using the increase in mean side scatter as a marker of increase in granularity of cells due to these particles.Human MARCO Surface Expression on Transiently Transfected CHO Cells—For immunofluorescence, 1 × 106 cells suspended in PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide and 2% bovine serum albumin were preincubated with monoclonal antibody PLK-1 (7 μg/ml) or vehicle at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide and 2% bovine serum albumin. After washing, the antibody PLK-1 was detected using Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG by flow cytometry. The primary monoclonal antibody PLK-I (human MARCO) was generously provided by Dr. L. Kobzik.Apoptosis Detection in MARCO-transfected CHO Cells—Briefly, 5 × 105 CHO cells were seeded in 6-well plates and incubated for 24 h. The cells were then transiently transfected as described above. The transfected cells were allowed to recover for 24 h. Cells were then treated with 50 μg/cm2 of silica for 7 h at 37°C. The cells were scraped and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed once with 2 ml of PBS, then permeabilized in 1 ml of ice-cold 80% ethanol and left on ice for 1 h. Cells were centrifuged at 1000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, washed once with 3 ml of ice-cold PBS, and stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide in PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100 + 0.1 mm EDTA + 100 μg/ml RNase ON™ at 4 °C. Apoptosis measurement (the sub-G0/G1 population) was determined on a FACs Aria Flow cytometer using FACSs DIVA software (BD Biosciences).Statistical Analyses—All one-factor experimental designs were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's comparison to a single control group. All two-factor experimental designs were analyzed by two-way one-way analysis of variance followed by selected Bonferroni's post hoc pairwise mean comparisons. Pearson's correlation was used to determine significant associations between factors. Sample size varied between 3 and 9 experimental replications depending on the experiment and desired statistical power. Statistical significance was established as a two-tailed probability of type I error occurring at less than 5%. Analysis and graphics were performed on Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).RESULTSTo evaluate the activity of different SR in silica-induced cytotoxicity of AM, a variety of SR single and double null mice on the C57BL/6 background were used. The effect of silica on AM cell viability in a 4-h suspension culture can be found in Fig. 1A. AM from the CD204-/- was not significantly different from wild-type (WT) with silica causing a concentration-dependent loss in cell viability in both WT and CD204-/-. In contrast, the AM from MARCO-/- and MARCO-/-/CD204-/- mice showed no loss of viability for any concentration of silica tested. These differences were statistically significant when compared with the corresponding WT values at 50, 100, and 150 μg/ml silica. The AM from CD36-/- and CD36-/-/CD204-/- mice showed significantly more toxicity to silica when compared with the corresponding WT control AM.The effect of silica on AM cell apoptosis in a 4-h suspension culture can be found in Fig. 1B. AM from the CD204-/-, CD36-/-, and CD36-/-/CD204-/- mice were not significantly different from WT with silica causing a concentration-dependent increase in cell apoptosis in both WT and null AM. Consistent with the observation above, the AM from MARCO-/- and MARCO-/-/CD204-/- mice showed no apoptosis for any concentration of silica tested. These differences were also statistically significant when compared with the corresponding WT values at 100 and 150 μg/ml silica. Taken together, these results suggest that MARCO was important and CD204 was not important for AM cytotoxicity on C57BL/6 mice, and that CD36 could be a negative regulator or could affect MARCO expression.Based on the results in Fig. 1, MARCO surface expression was determined for AM from WT and null mice as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are presented in Fig. 2. All of the AM from null mice had a significantly different amount of MARCO surface expression from WT AM. The AM from MARCO-/-, MARCO-/-/CD204-/-, and CD36-/-/CD204-/- mice had significantly less MARCO expression than WT AM, with the MARCO nulls having no expression above background. However, AM from CD36-/- and CD204-/- mice had significantly increased MARCO expression compared with WT AM.FIGURE 2Relative expression of MARCO on alveolar macrophages from SR null mice.

Sample size n = 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further evaluate the cytotoxicity data, AM silica uptake was determined for all WT and null mice as previously described under “Experimental Procedures” using side scatter properties in flow cytometry. These results are illustrated in Fig. 3A. Following a 1.5-h suspension culture at 37 °C, silica (100 μg/ml) produced a significant increase compared with baseline (no particle control) in side scatter for AM from WT mice. Likewise, AM from CD204-/-, CD36-/-, and CD36-/-/CD204-/- mice had similar significant increases in side scatter with silica exposure compared with the corresponding baseline control. In contrast, AM from MARCO-/- and MARCO-/-/CD204-/- mice showed only a slight, nonsignificant increase in side scatter with silica exposure. AM from CD204-/- and CD36-/- showed the highest side scatter in response to silica. The baseline side scatter (no silica) across groups was not significantly different. There was no detectable silica-induced apoptosis or necrosis (potentially confounding the side scatter data) at the end of the 90-min culture (kinetic viability and apoptosis data along with photographic evidence of binding inhibition of silica at 90 min are available in the supplemental data).FIGURE 3A, relative silica uptake on alveolar macrophages from SR null mice.

The degree of MARCO expression is highly correlated with silica uptake with a significant Pearson's r of 0.91. Eighty-four percent of the variability in side scatter can be accounted for by the variability in MARCO expression. Therefore, MARCO expression would be a good predictor variable for silica uptake in the C57BL/6 AM model.Because MARCO appeared to be the best candidate for silica binding and toxicity, AM from both WT and CD36-/- mice were used with an anti-mouse MARCO antibody. The WT represents the baseline response to silica and the CD36-/- represents the extreme response to silica as these CD36-/- AM showe"

Type I interferons (IFNs) were so far associated with antiviral immunity, but recent studies also indicated a role of these cytokines in immune responses against (intracellular) bacteria. Here we show that wild-type L. pneumophila and flagellin-deficient Legionella, but not L. pneumophila lacking a functional type IV secretion system Dot/Icm, or heat-inactivated Legionella induced IFNβ expression in human lung epithelial cells. We found that factor (IRF)-3 and NF-κB-p65 translocated into the nucleus and bound to the IFNβ gene enhancer after L. pneumophila infection of lung epithelial cells. RNA interference demonstrated that in addition to IRF3, the caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing adapter molecule IPS-1 (interferon-β promoter stimulator 1) is crucial for L. pneumophila-induced IFNβ expression, whereas other CARD-possessing molecules, such as RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible protein I), MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5), Nod27 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein 27), and ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) seemed not to be involved. Finally, bacterial multiplication assays in small interfering RNA-treated cells indicated that IPS-1, IRF3, and IFNβ were essential for the control of intracellular replication of L. pneumophila in lung epithelial cells.

The innate immunity serves as a first line defense system against invading pathogens, including bacteria or viruses.

IFNα and -β constitute the type I IFN family and were originally identified as humeral factors that confer an antiviral state on cells (5Katze M.G. He Y. Gale Jr., M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). The expression of IFNα/β is essentially controlled by transcription factors of the IFN regulatory factor (IRF) family (6Barnes B. Lubyova B. Pitha P.M. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). After expression and secretion, IFNα/β binds to the IFNα/β receptor, which, via signaling to the signal transducers and activators of transcription/c-Jun-activated kinase pathway, induces expression of so-called IFN-stimulated genes, many of which have antiviral activities (7Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2456) Google Scholar).Much attention has recently been directed to the mechanism of pathogen-induced IRF activation. Double-stranded RNA and lipopolysaccharide, when recognized by TLR3 and TLR4, respectively, stimulated a TRIF (and TRAM for TLR4)-TBK1/IKKi signaling module leading to IRF3 and IRF7 activation; TLR7-TLR9 detect single-stranded RNA and CpG DNA and stimulate IRF5 and IRF7 via a MyD88-dependent pathway also involving IRAK1/4 and TRAF6 (2Kawai T.

Moreover, certain viruses or double-stranded RNA activated a TLR-independent pathway, which signals via the cytosolic RNA helicases RIG-I and/or MDA5, the adapter molecule IPS-1 (interferon-β promoter stimulator 1) (also called MAVS, VISA, and Cardif), thereby stimulating IRF3 and IRF7 (1Andrejeva J.

Roy C.R. Cell Microbiol. 2004; 6: 1011-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24Swanson M.S. Hammer B.K. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 567-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Legionella are enclosed within a vacuole during their intracellular replication. They possess the type IVB secretion system Dot/Icm that enables them to inject proteins and nucleic acids into the host cell cytoplasm. Here we demonstrate that wild-type L. pneumophila, but not Legionella deficient in the Dot/Icm system, induced IFNβ expression through IPS-1 and IRF3. In addition, we observe a negative regulatory effect of IPS-1 and IRF3 on intracellular replication of L. pneumophila in lung epithelial cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains—The L. pneumophila strains used in this study were wild-type serogroup 1 strains 130b (kindly provided by N. Cianciotto (Chicago, IL)), JR32, JR32 mutant with a knock out in dotA, encoding a protein essential for the type IVB secretion system (kindly provided by H. Shuman (New York, NY)), wild-type Corby, and Corby deficient in flagellin (ΔflaA; kindly provided by K. Heuner (Würzburg, Germany)). L. pneumophila was grown on buffered charcoal-yeast extract (BCYE) agar for 2 days at 37 °C before uses.RNA Interference in A549 Cells—Control nonsilencing siRNA (sense, UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUtt; antisense, ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAAtt), siRNAs targeting IPS-1 (IPS-1a (sense, UAGUUGAUCUCGCGGACGAtt; antisense, UCGUCCGCGAGAUCAACUAtt); IPS-1b (sense, CCACCUUGAUGCCUGUGAAtt; antisense, UUCACAGGCAUCAAGGUGGtt); and apoptosis-associated specklike protein containing a CARD (ASC) (sense, GAUGCGGAAGCUCUUCAGUtt; antisense, ACUGAAGAGCUUCCGCAUCtt)) were purchased from MWG. IRF3 siRNA (sense, GGAGGAUUUCGGAAUCUUCtt; antisense, GAAGAUUCCGAAAUCCUCCtg), RIG-I siRNA (sense, CGAUUCCAUCACUAUCCAUtt; antisense, AUGGAUAGUGAUGGAAUCGtt), MDA5 siRNA (sense, GGAUUGUGCAGAAAGAAAAtt; antisense, UUUUCUUUCUGCACAAUCCtt), Nod27 siRNA (sense, GCAGACAGGCUAUGCUUUCtt; antisense, GAAAGCAUAGCCUGUCUGCtg), and Nod5 siRNA (sense, GUUAUUCCUAAAGGAGACCtt; antisense, GGUCUCCUUUAGGAAUAACtt) were from Ambion. A549 cells were transfected by using Amaxa Nucleofector™ (Amaxa) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Nucleofector™ Solution V, Nucleofector™ program G-16) with 2 μg of siRNA/106 cells.Infection/Stimulation of A549 Cells—Cells were infected with L. pneumophila at MOI as indicated, centrifuged for 30 min at 800 × g to enhance bacterial adherence and internalization, and incubated for 6.5 h at 37 °C (IFNβ mRNA expression). In the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and Western blot experiments, A549 cells were starved in culture medium without fetal calf serum overnight and subsequently infected with L. pneumophila (MOI 10) for the indicated time intervals. In certain experiments, LyoVec-complexed B-DNA (poly(dA-dT)-poly(dT-dA); InvivoGen) at 1 μg/ml was used as a control.RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA from A549 cells was isolated with the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed using avian myeloblastosis reverse transcriptase (Promega). The generated cDNA was amplified by semiquantitative RT-PCR using specific primers (IFNβ-sense, 5′-GCTCTCCTGTTGTGCTTCTCCAC-3′; IFNβ-antisense, 5′-CAATAGTCTCATTCCAGCCAGTGC-3′; IRF3-sense, 5′-TACGTGAGGCATGTGCTGA-3′; IRF3-antisense, 5′-AGTGGGTGGCTGTTGGAAAT-3′; IPS-1-sense, 5′-ATGCCGTTTGCTGAAGAC-3′; IPS-1-antisense, 5′-CTAGTGCAGACGCCGCCG-3′; RIG-I-sense, 5′-TCCTTTATGAGTATGTGGGCA-3′; RIG-I-antisense, 5′-TCGGGCACAGAATATCTTTG-3′; MDA5-sense, 5′-TCCTGGTTGCTCACAGTGGTT-3′; MDA5-antisense, 5′-GAGACAAGGCAAATCTAAGCC-3′; ASC-sense, ATGCGCTGGAGAACCTGA; ASC-antisense, AGGTAGGACTGGGACTCCCTTA; Nod27-sense, TGGGAAGACACTCAGGCTAA; Nod27-antisense, ATCATCGTCCTCACAGAGGTT; Nod5-sense, GGAGTGCAGCTTTTGTGTGA; Nod5-antisense, AGATGCGTCAGGCTCTTGTT; IL-8-sense, 5′-CTAGGACAAGAGCCAGGAAGA-3′; IL-8-antisense, 5′-AACCCTCTGCACCCAGTTTTC-3′; GAPDH-sense, 5′-CCACCCATGGCAAATTCCATGGCA-3′; GAPDH-antisense, 5′-TCTAGACGGCAGGTCAGGTCCACC-3′).Quantitative RT-PCR—Real time PCRs were carried out using the SYBR-green DNA Amplification Kit (Roche Applied Science) on a Lightcycler® apparatus (Roche Applied Science). The primers used were IFNβ-sense (5′-AAACTCATGAGCAGTCTGCA-3′) and IFNβ antisense (5′-AGGAGATCTTCAGTTTCGGAGG-3′). Input was normalized by the average expression of the housekeeping gene S9: S9-sense (5′-ATCCGCCAGCGCCATA-3′) and S9-antisense (5′-TCAATGTGCTTCTGGGAATCC-3′). All PCRs were carried out in duplicates, and relative IFNβ expression in control siRNA-transfected/Legionella-infected cells was set as 100%.Western Blot—Cytoplasmatic or nuclear extracts of A549 cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted. Membranes were exposed to antibodies specific to IRF3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively, and subsequently incubated with secondary antibodies (IRDye 800-labeled anti-mouse or Cy5.5-labeled anti-rabbit, respectively). Proteins were detected by using an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Inc.).Immunhistochemistry—Human lung specimens were fixed, paraffin-embedded by utilizing the HOPE-technique, and subjected to immunohistochemistry. After deparaffinization, the endogenous peroxidase was blocked by incubation with 3% H2O2. Nonspecific binding was minimized by incubation with heat-inactivated pig serum diluted 1:30 in Tris-buffered saline. Rabbit anti-IRF3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as primary antibody, and detection and visualization were performed by the LSAB2 technique with aminoethylcarbazole as a chromogenic substrate for the horseradish peroxidase. Slides were counterstained by Mayer's hemalum, mounted with Kayser's glycerolgelatine, and photomicrographed. Negative controls were included by omission of the primary antibody.ChIP—A549 cells were infected with L. pneumophila as indicated and then subjected to a ChIP assay as previously described using anti-IRF3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-RNA polymerase II (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies (25Schmeck B.

The IFNβ enhancer region was amplified by PCR using HotstarTaq polymerase (Qiagen) and specific primers as follows: sense, 5′-GAATCCACGGATACAGAACCT-3′; antisense, 5′-TTGACAACACGAACAGTGTCG-3′. PCR amplification of the total input DNA in each sample is shown as a control.Bacterial Replication Assay—A549 cells were transfected with siRNA targeting IRF3 or IPS-1 or control siRNA. After 56 h, cells were pretreated with 1000 IU/ml rIFNβ (InvivoGen) as indicated. After further 16 h, cells were infected with L. pneumophila (MOI 0.1), centrifuged for 30 min at 800 × g, and incubated further for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed twice with PBS, and culture medium containing 50 μg/ml gentamycin was added to the cells for 1 h to kill remaining extracellular Legionella. Subsequently, cells were washed, and culture medium with rIFNβ, as indicated, was added (this time point represents 0 h). Cells were incubated and washed at the indicated time intervals with PBS and lysed with 0.1% saponin for 5 min, and lysates were plated on BCYE agar to count Legionella colony-forming units.Statistics—Inhibitory effects of siRNAs used were statistically evaluated employing Student's t test. p values of <0.05 are indicated by one asterisk.RESULTSL. pneumophila-induced IFNβ Expression in Lung Epithelial Cells—In order to characterize the effects of L. pneumophila on lung epithelial cells, we incubated A549 cells with the bacteria at different MOIs. L. pneumophila infection with strain 130b and JR32 both dose-dependently increased IFNβ mRNA expression (Fig. 1, A and B), whereas L. pneumophila JR32 deficient in its type IVB secretion system or heat-inactivated L. pneumophila did not (Fig. 1, B and C), suggesting that substrate translocation via the type IVB secretion system and/or intracellular replication were necessary for the IFNβ response. Moreover, Legionella flagellin seemed not to be involved, since L. pneumophila strain Corby and a respective flagellin mutant were both capable of inducing IFNβ induction (Fig. 1D).IRF3 Is Required for L. pneumophila-stimulated IFNβ Expression—IFNβ responses upon Legionella infection led us to assess a possible link between Legionella infection and IRF3 activation. IRF3 is expressed in human lung tissue (Fig. 2A) and in A549 cells. L. pneumophila infection of A549 cells induced nuclear translocation of IRF3 as demonstrated by immunoblotting of nuclear extracts with a specific IRF3 antibody (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the NF-κB subunit p65/RelA also translocated into the nucleus of Legionella-infected cells.FIGURE 2L. pneumophila induced IRF3 and p65 nuclear translocation and IFNβ enhancer binding. A, detection of IRF3 in human lung tissues by immunohistochemistry. IRF3 is expressed in human lung airway epithelia (I; magnification ×400), within alveolar epithelial cells (II; magnification ×800), and within alveolar macrophages (III; magnification ×400). The arrows indicate alveolar epithelial cells, and arrowheads show alveolar macrophages. B, A549 cells were infected with L. pneumophila (130b). After the indicated time intervals, nuclear cell extracts were probed by Western blot using the indicated antibodies. Shown is one representative experiment of three. C, A549 cells were infected with L. pneumophila for the indicated time intervals. A ChIP assay was performed by using antibodies as indicated and subsequent amplification of the IFNβ enhancer. IFNβ enhancer was also amplified from the DNA-protein complex before the precipitation (Input). Data are representative for three independent experiments. IP, immunoprecipitation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In order to further address the effects of L. pneumophila on the transcription factors examined, we performed a ChIP assay by using IFNβ enhancer-specific primers. A549 cells were infected with L. pneumophila, and immunoprecipitations with IRF3, p65, and RNA polymerase II antibodies were carried out. As shown in Fig. 2C, Legionella infection led to a temporary binding of IRF3 and p65 to the IFNβ enhancer. After 60 min, recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the IFNβ enhancer indicated gene transcription. Taken together, these results demonstrated that Legionella infection stimulated transcriptional activity of IRF3 and p65.Next, we performed RNAi experiments to analyze the importance of IRF3 for IFNβ expression. A549 cells were transfected either with nonspecific nonsilencing control siRNA or with specific siRNA targeting IRF3, respectively. After 72 h, cells were infected with L. pneumophila, and quantitative PCR and semiquantitative RT-PCR were carried out. As shown in Fig. 3, Legionella infection induced IFNβ expression in cells that were transfected with the control siRNA. IRF3 siRNA strongly inhibited IFNβ up-regulation caused by L. pneumophila. The expression of IRF3 was assessed in parallel in order to monitor the RNAi effects. Data indicate that the siRNA used was capable of silencing its specific target mRNA. As a second control, we checked mRNA expression of IL-8, a predominantly NF-κB-regulated gene (26Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21128-21133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); as expected, the Legionella-induced IL-8 mRNA up-regulation was hardly affected by any siRNA used. Overall, our data showed that IRF3 is important for IFNβ induction by L. pneumophila.FIGURE 3Role of IRF3 in L. pneumophila-induced IFNβ expression. A549 cells were transfected with control siRNA (contr.) or siRNAs targeting IRF3. After 3 days, cells were infected with L. pneumophila (130b, MOI 10; L. p.) for 7 h, and quantitative and semiquantitative RT-PCRs as indicated were performed.

Knowing in addition that in the TLR family different TLRs share adapter molecules and thereby activate similar signaling cascades (2Kawai T. Akira S. Curr. Opin.

Immunogenetics. 2005; 57: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), overall, we hypothesized that IPS-1 mediates IFNβ responses by Legionella. We therefore tested the involvement of IPS-1 by using two IPS-1 siRNAs that had already been used in two of the initial reports identifying IPS-1/MAVS (10Kawai T. Takahashi K. Sato S. Coban C. Kumar H. Kato H. Ishii K.J. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar, 12Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2005; 122: 669-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar). Data obtained in A549 cells demonstrated that both siRNAs targeting IPS-1 abrogated the up-regulation of IFNβ caused by L. pneumophila infection or by synthetic B-DNA (Fig. 4) (data not shown). We thus concluded that IPS-1 is critically involved in the IFNβ responses to Legionella infection.FIGURE 4Role of IPS-1 in L. pneumophila-induced IFNβ expression. A549 cells were transfected with control siRNA (contr.) or two different siRNAs targeting IPS-1 (IPS-1a and IPS-1b). After 3 days, cells were infected with L. pneumophila (130b, MOI 10; L. p.), and quantitative and semiquantitative RT-PCRs were performed.

In the case of Nod27 siRNA, we even observed an enhancement of the Legionella-induced IFNβ up-regulation. Overall, the data argue against RIG-I, MDA5, ASC, Nod27, and Nod5 mediating IFNβ induction activated by L. pneumophila.FIGURE 5RIG-I (A), MDA5 (B), ASC (C), Nod27 (D), and Nod5 (E) siRNA did not inhibit the IFNβ responses against Legionella.

Therefore, A549 cells were transfected either with nonsilencing control siRNA or with specific siRNAs targeting IPS-1 or IRF3, respectively. In addition, some cells were pretreated with rIFNβ 56 h after transfection. 72 h after transfection (16 h after rIFNβ treatment), cells were infected with L. pneumophila, and numbers of intracellular bacteria were counted at different time points, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 6, L. pneumophila replicated within the lung epithelial cells examined (0 h, 1533 ± 88; 4"
https://openalex.org/W1964978938,"ErbB receptors are key regulators of cell survival and growth in normal and transformed tissues. The oncogenic glycoprotein MUC1 is a binding partner and substrate for erbB1 and MUC1 expression can potentiate erbB-dependent signal transduction. After receptor activation, erbB1 is typically downregulated via an endocytic pathway that results in receptor degradation or recycling. We report here that MUC1 expression inhibits the degradation of ligand-activated erbB1. Through the use of both RNAi-mediated knock down and overexpression constructs of MUC1, we show that MUC1 expression inhibits erbB1 degradation after ligand treatment in breast epithelial cells. This MUC1-mediated protection against erbB1 degradation can increase total cellular pools of erbB1 over time. Biotinylation of surface proteins demonstrates that cell-surface associated erbB1 receptor is protected by MUC1 against ligand-induced degradation, although this is accompanied by an increase in erbB1 internalization. The MUC1-mediated protection against degradation occurs with a decrease in EGF-stimulated ubiquitination of erbB1, and an increase in erbB1 recycling. These data indicate that MUC1 expression is a potent regulator of erbB1 receptor stability upon activation and may promote transformation through the inhibition of erbB1 degradation."

To examine the effects of two CD99 isoforms on the invasive phenotypes of breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cell lines were stably transfected with CD99 cDNAs encoding the major wild-type form (type I) or a minor splice variant (type II). As a result, expression of CD99 type II, but not type I, markedly elevated the motility, binding to fibronectin, MMP-9 expression, and invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. In MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells expressing both CD99 type I and type II, invasion-related cellular activities were inhibited by the transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted to CD99 type II. Meanwhile, CD99 type II-induced MMP-9 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells was shown to be mediated by the binding of AP-1 factors to the MMP-9 gene promoter. Gel shift assay revealed that ligation of CD99 type II with antibody resulted in the binding of JunD to the AP-1 site of the MMP-9 promoter region. Initiation of CD99 type II signaling by antibody ligation increased expression of JunD and FosB AP-1 factors, along with phosphorylation of Src, Akt, p38 MAPK, ERK, and JNK. Knockdown of JunD and FosB by siRNA transfection abolished the positive effects of CD99 type II on the motility and MMP-9 expression of MDA-MB-231 cells. Increased expression of JunD and FosB as well as elevated cell motility and MMP-9 expression by CD99 type II ligation were also abrogated by inhibitors, dominant-negative forms, and siRNAs for Akt1, ERK1/2, and JNK1 but not for p38 MAPK. These results suggest that expression of a splice variant of CD99 contributes to the invasive ability of human breast cancer cells by up-regulating AP-1-mediated gene expression through the Akt-dependent ERK and JNK signaling pathways.

These results suggest that expression of a splice variant of CD99 contributes to the invasive ability of human breast cancer cells by up-regulating AP-1-mediated gene expression through the Akt-dependent ERK and JNK signaling pathways. CD99, a cell surface glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 32 kDa, was originally described as a human thymus leukemia antigen (1Levy R. Dilley J. Fox R.I. Warnke R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6552-6556Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), a Ewing sarcoma-specific membrane marker molecule (2Hamilton G. Fellinger E.J. Schratter I. Fritsch A.

Immunol. 1991; 21: 715-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). CD99 is broadly distributed on many cell types, with particularly strong expression on human cortical thymocytes, Ewing sarcoma cells, and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (3Kovar H. Dworzak M. Strehl S. Schnell E. Ambros I.M. Ambros P.F. Gadner H. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1067-1070PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ambros I.M. Ambros P.F. Strehl S. Kovar H. Gadner H. Salzer-Kuntschik M. Cancer. 1991; 67: 1886-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). The functional role of CD99 is not fully understood, and most information about its functions is derived from triggering CD99-mediated signaling events with agonistic CD99 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 2The abbreviations used are: mAbs, monoclonal antibodies; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; AP-1, activator protein-1; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAPK kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RT, reverse transcription; ECM, extracellular matrix; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MTT, 3-[4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl]-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 2The abbreviations used are: mAbs, monoclonal antibodies; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; AP-1, activator protein-1; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAPK kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RT, reverse transcription; ECM, extracellular matrix; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MTT, 3-[4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl]-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. in hematopoietic cells. In normal cells, CD99 has been functionally implicated in cell adhesion, migration, apoptosis, differentiation, activation, and proliferation of lymphocytes and monocyte extravasation and transport of several transmembrane proteins (9Bernard G.

In particular, the role of CD99 in the modulation of cell adhesion has been demonstrated by the ability of anti-CD99 mAbs to induce homotypic aggregation of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, whereas other anti-CD99 antibodies block spontaneous T cell-erythrocyte rosette formation (4Bernard A. Aubrit F. Raynal B. Pham D. Boumsell L. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1802-1807PubMed Google Scholar, 6Gelin C. Aubrit F. Phalipon A. Raynal B. Cole S. Kaczorek M. Bernard A.

Immunol. 1997; 159: 2250-2258PubMed Google Scholar). It was also shown that antibody ligation of CD99 molecules up-regulated the expression of LFA-1 (αLβ2 integrin), and CD99-induced cell aggregation was blocked by the addition of mAbs to LFA-1 or intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) in a B cell line (20Hahn J.H. Kim M.K. Choi E.Y. Kim S.H. Sohn H.W. Ham D.I. Chung D.H. Kim T.J. Lee W.J. Park C.K. Ree H.J. Park S.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2250-2258PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that signal transduction via CD99 modulates cell adhesion of lymphocytes by regulating the expression level of the cell adhesion molecule, integrin LFA-1. Several signal transducing molecules, including MAPKs and protein kinase C, have been found to mediate CD99-dependent cell adhesion of T cells (21Hahn M.J. Yoon S.S. Sohn H.W. Song H.G. Park S.H. Kim T.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Kasinrerk W. Tokrasinwit N. Moonsom S. Stockinger H. Immunol. Lett. 2000; 71: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, it was found that CD99 on one cell binds to another neighboring CD99 on the next, indicating that CD99 is a homophilic cell surface interacting protein (18Schenkel A.R. Mamdouh Z. Chen X. Liebman R.M. Muller W.A. Nat. Immun. 2002; 3: 143-150Crossref Scopus (408) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms of CD99-mediated signal transduction remain largely unknown. The CD99 gene encodes two distinct proteins produced by alternative splicing of the CD99 gene transcript (20Hahn J.H. Kim M.K. Choi E.Y. Kim S.H. Sohn H.W. Ham D.I. Chung D.H. Kim T.J. Lee W.J. Park C.K. Ree H.J. Park S.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2250-2258PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with the major wild-type full-length form, the minor splice variant form of CD99 has a relatively short intracytoplasmic fragment (Fig. 1A) (23Kim H.Y. Kim Y.M. Shin Y.K. Park S.H. Lee W. Mol. Cells. 2004; 18: 24-29PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the minor form of CD99 inhibited homotypic adhesion of B cells, whereas activation of the major form promoted the adhesion process. The opposing effects of the major and minor forms of CD99 on homotypic B cell adhesion were shown to be because of their opposing functions in controlling the expression of the cell adhesion molecule, integrin LFA-1 (20Hahn J.H. Kim M.K. Choi E.Y. Kim S.H. Sohn H.W. Ham D.I. Chung D.H. Kim T.J. Lee W.J. Park C.K. Ree H.J. Park S.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2250-2258PubMed Google Scholar). Because differential expression of alternative splicing products has been shown to be a characteristic feature of many developmentally regulated cell adhesion molecules (24Brown N.H. King D.L. Wilcox M. Kafatos F.C. Cell. 1989; 59: 185-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Cooper H.M. Tamura R.N. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 26Zorn A.M. Krieg P.A. Dev. Biol. 1992; 149: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 27Baldwin H.S. Shen H.M. Yan H.C. DeLisser H.M. Chung A. Mickanin C. Trask T. Kirschbaum N.E. Newman P.J. Albelda S.M. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 2539-2553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these results suggest that the modulation of adhesion and de-adhesion of lymphocytes occurring during the lymphoid cell differentiation process may be influenced by a balance in the expression level between the major form and splice variant of CD99. In addition, it was reported that expression of the major CD99 form in CD99-deficient Jurkat T cells promotes cell adhesion, whereas co-expression of the two CD99 isoforms induces apoptosis (28Alberti I. Bernard G. Rouquette-Jazdanian A.K. Pelassy C. Pourtein M. Aussel C. Bernard A. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1946-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that differential expression of these two CD99 isoforms can lead to distinct functional outcomes. Besides developmental processes, various biological phenomena regulated by cell adhesion and de-adhesion could be affected by the differential expression of CD99 molecules. Because alterations in homotypic cell adhesion have been frequently observed in the invasion processes of many types of cancer, the functional role of CD99 molecules in the adhesion process of lymphocytes led us to the assumption that cellular activities related to the invasive potential of cancer cells could in part be regulated by the differential expression of CD99 molecules. To test this possibility, we here investigated the functional effects of CD99 isoforms on several cellular processes involved in cancer invasion and metastasis. As a result, we found that expression of the minor splice variant (type II) of CD99 led to increases in the motility, binding to fibronectin, MMP-9 activity, and invasiveness of human breast cancer cells. Increased cell motility and MMP-9 expression by CD99 type II were found to be mediated by AP-1 factors such as JunD and FosB. CD99 type II-specific signaling events to increase JunD and FosB were regulated by Akt, ERK, and JNK in breast cancer cells. On the basis of our findings, we suggest that expression and activation of the CD99 splice variant enhance the invasive ability of human breast cancer cells by up-regulating AP-1-mediated gene expression through the Akt-dependent ERK and JNK signaling pathways. Cell Culture, Antibodies, and Reagents—MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-435 human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all obtained from Invitrogen) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Anti-CD99 monoclonal antibody DN16 was purchased from Dinona Bioscience (Seoul, Korea). Antibodies to FAK, phospho-FAK(Tyr925), Src, phospho-Src(Tyr416), Akt, phospho-Akt(Ser473), ERK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2(Thr202/Tyr204), p38 MAPK, phospho-p38 MAPK(Thr180/Tyr182), JNK, phospho-JNK(Thr183/Tyr185), c-Jun, phospho-c-Jun(Ser63/Ser73), JunB, JunD, c-Fos, FosB, Fra1, Fra2, and MMP-9 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). PP2, PD98059, SB203580, SP600125, and wortmannin were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). All other reagents were from Sigma, unless indicated otherwise. CD99 Transfection and Selection of Stable Clones—The cDNA expression construct encoding the wild-type form (type I) or splice variant (type II) of CD99 was transfected into MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cell lines by using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. pcDNA3 vector only was also transfected as a control. Neomycin-resistant clones were isolated by growth in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS and 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Stable transfectant clones with high CD99 expression were identified by RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and flow cytometric analysis. RT-PCR Analysis—Total cellular RNA was purified from the cultured cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed with 1 μg of total RNA using a cDNA synthesis kit (Promega, Madison, WI). For PCR amplification, 5′-GTGCGGCTAGCACCATGGCCCGCGGGGCTG-3′ was used as the sense primer for both cDNAs of CD99 type I and type II. The antisense primers, 5′-TAGTCTCGAGCTATTTCTCTAAAAGAGTACG-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGACCCTAGGTCTTCAGCCAT-3′, were used for the CD99 type I and type II, respectively. These primer pairs amplify a 583-bp fragment for CD99 type I and a 515-bp fragment for CD99 type II (20Hahn J.H. Kim M.K. Choi E.Y. Kim S.H. Sohn H.W. Ham D.I. Chung D.H. Kim T.J. Lee W.J. Park C.K. Ree H.J. Park S.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2250-2258PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, cDNAs for MMP-9 and the standard form of CD44 were also subjected to PCR amplification using the following primer pairs: 5′-TGGGCTACGTGACCTATGACAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCCCAGCCCACCTCCACTCCTC-3′ (antisense) for MMP-9 (29Park H.Y. Kwon H.M. Lim H.J. Hong B.K. Lee J.Y. Park B.E. Jang Y. Cho S.Y. Kim H.S. Exp. Mol. Med. 2001; 33: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar); 5′-TTTGCCTCTTACAGTTGAGCCTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGTGCCATCACGGTTGACAATAG-3′ (antisense) for CD44 (30Annabi B. Thibeault S. Moumdjian R. Beliveau R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21888-21896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was subjected to 25 PCR amplification cycles of 60 s at 95 °C, 90 s at 58 °C, and 90 s at 72 °C. β-Actin amplification was used as an internal PCR control with 5′-GATATCGCCGCGCTCGTCGTCGAC-3′ as the sense primer and 5′-CAGGAAGGAAGGCTGGAAGAGTGC-3′ as the antisense primer. The PCR products were visualized using ethidium bromide in 1% agarose gel. Western Blotting Analysis—Cells were washed, harvested, and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm benzamidine) on ice for 10 min. For phosphoprotein analysis, cell lysis buffer was supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate). After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatants were collected and quantified for protein concentration by the Bradford assay. Equal amounts of protein per lane were separated onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was blocked in 5% skim milk for 2 h and then incubated with a specific antibody for 2 h. After washing, the membrane was incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. After final washes, the membrane was developed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Flow Cytometric Analysis—Cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml anti-CD99 mAb DN16 for 30 min, washed with cold PBS, and then incubated with saturating concentrations of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Pharmingen) for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, the cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde in PBS. Cell surface immunofluorescence was analyzed by flow cytometry performed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences). Transfection of siRNA—Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for CD99 type II, JunD, and FosB were designed and synthesized using the software and Silencer™ siRNA construction kit from Ambion (Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. CD99 type II siRNA-targeting sequence was 5′-AATGATGGCTGAAGACCTAGG-3′ (sense), which is located between exon 8 and exon 9 in the human CD99 gene and is found only in the splice CD99 variant (type II) cDNA but not in the major type (type I) cDNA (20Hahn J.H. Kim M.K. Choi E.Y. Kim S.H. Sohn H.W. Ham D.I. Chung D.H. Kim T.J. Lee W.J. Park C.K. Ree H.J. Park S.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2250-2258PubMed Google Scholar). The siRNA-targeting sequences (sense) for JunD and FosB were 5′-GAGAAGGCUCAGCAAGAAG-3′ and 5′-UGUCUGGUAUGAUCCUUCU-3′, respectively. The siRNA control was 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUdTdT-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAAdTdT-3′ (antisense), which bears no homology with relevant human genes (31Duxbury M.S. Ito H. Zinner M.J. Ashley S.W. Whang E.E. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For siRNA transfection, cells (5 × 105) were seeded in 6-well plates and grown for 24 h to reach 60–70% confluency. The different amounts of siRNA and the Lipofectamine reagent (5 μl) were diluted in 200 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The diluted siRNA-liposome complex was added to cells in DMEM (800 μl). Following 6 h of incubation, cells were rinsed with fresh medium and grown for 24 h in normal growth medium containing FBS before analysis. Cell Growth Assay—In vitro cell growth was measured using a modified 3-[4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl]-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method (32Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45846) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 2 × 103 cells in 0.1 ml of culture medium per well. After incubation in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, 10 μl of the MTT solution (5 mg/ml) was added every 24 h to wells of each plate, and the cells were cultured for another 2 h, and 100 μl of SDS (20%) and N,N-dimethylformamide (50%) solution was added to each well and mixed vigorously to solubilize colored crystals produced within the cells. The ratio of absorbance at 590 nm to absorbance at 630 nm was measured by a microplate ELISA reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). Cell Aggregation Assay—For the measurement of homotypic cell-to-cell adhesion (33Jee B. Jin K. Hahn J.H. Song H.G. Lee H. Exp. Mol. Med. 2003; 35: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), adherent cells were rendered as a single cell suspension by trypsinization followed by incubation with 5 mm EDTA in PBS lacking Ca2+ and Mg2+ at 37 °C for 5 min and by 7 gentle passes through a 22-gauge needle. After cells were washed with Puck's saline (5 mm KCl, 140 mm NaCl, and 8 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4), single cell suspensions (1 × 105 cells/ml of Puck's saline) were plated into individual wells of a 24-well culture plate, and incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C with agitation at 70–80 rpm using a orbital shaker. Photographs were taken every 30 min after incubation under a microscope on three predetermined fields, and both the total cell number (A) and the number of cells remaining as single cells (B) were counted. The results were expressed as the percentage of cells that formed aggregates as follows: (A–B)/A × 100(%). For antibody ligation of CD99, the CD99 transfectant cells (5 × 105) suspended in 0.1 ml of serum-free DMEM were pretreated with 2 μg of anti-CD99 mAb DN16 for 2 h and then with 10 μg of goat anti-mouse IgG (γ-chain specific; Sigma) for 3 h before single cell suspensions were made for aggregation assays. Invasion Assay into Matrigel—Cells were tested for invasive ability through the basement membrane Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in vitro in Transwell chambers (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA), as described previously (34Albini A. Iwamoto Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Aaronson S.A. Kozlowski J.M. McEwan R.N. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3239-3245PubMed Google Scholar, 35Kim Y.I. Park S. Jeoung D.I. Lee H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 307: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In brief, 24-well Transwell chamber inserts (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) with 8-μm porosity polycarbonate filters were precoated with 80 μg of basement membrane Matrigel (BD Biosciences) onto the upper surface and with 20 μg of gelatin onto the lower surface. Culture supernatant of NIH3T3 fibroblasts in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS was placed in the lower well. Cells suspended in DMEM/F-12 medium containing 0.1% FBS were added to the upper chambers (2 × 104 cells/well) and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were fixed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Noninvading cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed by wiping out with a cotton swab, and the filter was excised and mounted on a microscope slide. Invasiveness was quantified by counting cells on the lower surface of the filter. Wound Healing Migration Assay—For the measurement of cell migration during wound healing, cells (5 × 105) were seeded in individual wells of a 24-well culture plate. When the cells reached a confluent state, cell layers were wounded with a plastic micropipette tip having a large orifice. The medium and debris were aspirated away and replaced by 2 ml of fresh serum-free medium. Cells were photographed every 12 h after wounding by phase contrast microscopy. For evaluation of “wound closure,” five randomly selected points along each wound were marked, and the horizontal distance of migrating cells from the initial wound was measured. Attachment Assay—24-Well culture plates were coated with fibronectin, type I collagen, type IV collagen, or laminin (10 μg/cm2 each; all from Sigma) for 6 h at room temperature and washed with PBS. To block nonoccupied binding sites, the plates were incubated in 1% heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37°C. Cells (5 × 104) suspended in DMEM containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin were dispensed into each extracellular matrix protein-coated well, incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 1 h, and gently washed five times with PBS. Cells attached to the bottom of plate were stained with hematoxylin and eosin reagent and counted under a microscope. Gelatin Zymography—Type IV collagenase activities present in conditioned medium were visualized by electrophoresis on gelatin-containing polyacrylamide gel as described previously (36Lim S. Lee H.Y. Lee H. Cancer Lett. 1998; 133: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, conditioned medium from cells cultured in serum-free medium was mixed 3:1 with substrate gel sample buffer (40% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) and loaded without boiling onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing type 1 gelatin (1.5 mg/ml). After electrophoresis at 4 °C, the gel was soaked in 2.5% Triton X-100 with gentle shaking for 30 min with one change of detergent solution. The gel was rinsed and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in substrate buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% NaN3). Following incubation, the gel was stained with 0.05% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 and destained in 10% acetic acid and 20% methanol. Promoter Assay—A 1305-bp DNA fragment (–1285 to +20), corresponding to the promoter of the human MMP-9 gene (37Sato H. Seiki M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 395-405PubMed Google Scholar), was generously gifted by Dr. Seung-Taek Lee (Yonsei University, Korea) (38Hah N. Lee S.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 428-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For mt-AP-1 of the MMP-9 gene promoter, in which distal and proximal AP-1-binding sites (–533 to –527 and –79 to –73, respectively) were destroyed, 5′-TGAGTCA-3′ was changed to 5′-TGAGTtg-3′ (underlined lowercase letters indicate the mutated bases) by the QuickChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For mt-NF-κBofthe MMP-9 promoter, in which an NF-κB-binding site (–600 to –590) was destroyed, 5′-GGAATTCCCC-3′ was mutated into 5′-GatcgatCCC-3′. After subcloning the mutant MMP-9 promoters into a promoterless luciferase expression vector, pGL3 (Promega), the corresponding mutations in the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The pGL3 vector containing wild-type or mutant MMP-9 promoter was transfected into MDA-MD-231 cells by using Lipofectamine. Luciferase activity in cell lysate was measured using Promega luciferase assay system according to the instructions of the manufacturer. To normalize luciferase activity, each of the pGL3 vectors was co-transfected with a pRL-SV40ΔEnh, which expresses Renilla luciferase by an enhancerless SV40 promoter (38Hah N. Lee S.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 428-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Cells were incubated with serum-free medium for 4 h and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (39Na H.J. Lee S.J. Kang Y.C. Cho Y.L. Nam W.D.

A double-stranded oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the putative AP-1-binding site (–86 to –66; 5′-TGACCCCTGAGTCAGCACTTG-3′; the AP-1 recognition sequence is underlined) in the proximal MMP-9 promoter sequences were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified by a G-50 Sephadex column. The 32P-labeled probes (∼40,000 cpm) were then incubated with nuclear extracts (10 μg of protein) for 20 min at room temperature. Samples were resolved on a native 5% polyacrylamide gel, and the gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. Specificity for binding of AP-1 factors to the corresponding sequence of the MMP-9 promoter was confirmed by using a cold competitor having a typical AP-1 binding sequence (Promega). Endogenous Expression of CD99 Isoforms in Human Breast Carcinoma Cell Lines and Generation of Transfectant Clones for Each CD99 Isoform—We first performed RT-PCR analysis using total RNA from three human breast cancer cell lines to examine the production of the two CD99 mRNA isoforms. Nucleotide primers specific for CD99 type I and type II cDNAs generated a 583- and a 515-bp PCR product, respectively, from RNAs obtained from a highly metastatic breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-435 (Fig. 1B). Immunoblotting analysis also showed that both CD99 type I and type II proteins were present in MDA-MB-"
https://openalex.org/W2011522624,"P53 controls the growth and survival of cells by acting in response to a multitude of cellular stresses. It is, however, not yet fully understood how different p53 activation pathways result in either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. We and others have described an N-terminally truncated p53 protein (p53/47) originating from a second translation initiation site in the p53 messenger RNA (mRNA), which can interact with p53 and impose altered stability and transactivation properties to p53 complexes. Here we show that cap-dependent and cap-independent mechanisms of initiation govern the translation of the p53 mRNA. Changes in synthesis of full-length p53 or p53/47 are regulated through distinct cell stress-induced pathways acting through separate regions of the p53 mRNA. We also show that some cytotoxic drugs require the presence of full-length p53 to induce apoptosis, whereas for others p53/47 is sufficient. This indicates that by harbouring alternative translation initiation sites, the p53 mRNA gives rise to different levels of the p53 isoforms which help to orchestrate the cell biological outcome of p53 activation in response to different types of cell stress. This sheds new light into the way p53 can integrate and differentiate a large multiplicity of changes in the cellular environment."
https://openalex.org/W1972255467,"Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) is a multifunctional protein that induces apoptosis utilizing both insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF)-dependent and -independent mechanisms. We investigated the effects of IGFBP-3 on tumor growth and angiogenesis utilizing a human CaP xenograft model in severe-combined immunodeficiency mice. A 16-day course of IGFBP-3 injections reduced tumor size and increased apoptosis and also led to a reduction in the number of vessels stained with CD31. In vitro, IGFBP-3 inhibited both vascular endothelial growth factor- and IGF-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells vascular network formation in a matrigel assay. This action is primarily IGF independent as shown by studies utilizing the non-IGFBP-binding IGF-1 analog Long-R3. Additionally, we used a fibroblast growth factor-enriched matrigel-plug assay and chick allantoic membrane assays to show that IGFBP-3 has potent antiangiogenic actions in vivo. Finally, overexpression of IGFBP-3 or the non-IGF-binding GGG-IGFBP-3 mutant in Zebrafish embryos confirmed that both IGFBP-3 and the non-IGF-binding mutant inhibited vessel formation in vivo, indicating that the antiangiogenic effect of IGFBP-3 is an IGF-independent phenomenon. Together, these studies provide the first evidence that IGFBP-3 has direct, IGF-independent inhibitory effects on angiogenesis providing an additional mechanism by which it exerts its tumor suppressive effects and further supporting its development for clinical use in the therapy of patients with prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2056205420,"The proteasome has emerged as a novel target for antineoplastic treatment of hematological malignancies and solid tumors, including those of the central nervous system. To identify cell death pathways activated in response to inhibition of the proteasome system in cancer cells, we treated human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with the selective proteasome inhibitor (PI) epoxomicin (Epoxo). Prolonged exposure to Epoxo was associated with increased levels of poly-ubiquitinylated proteins and p53, release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, and activation of caspases. Analysis of global gene expression using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays revealed that Epoxo triggered transcriptional activation of the two Bcl-2-homology domain-3-only (BH3-only) genes p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and Bim. Subsequent studies in PUMA- and Bim-deficient cells indicated that Epoxo-induced caspase activation and apoptosis was predominantly PUMA-dependent. Further characterization of the transcriptional response to Epoxo in HCT116 human colon cancer cells demonstrated that PUMA induction was p53-dependent; with deficiency in either p53 or PUMA significantly protected HCT116 cells against Epoxo-induced apoptosis. Our data suggest that p53 activation and the transcriptional induction of its target gene PUMA play an important role in the sensitivity of cancer cells to apoptosis induced by proteasome inhibition, and imply that antineoplastic therapies with PIs might be especially useful in cancers with functional p53."
https://openalex.org/W2014618196,"The aim of this study was to immunolocalize perlecan in human fetal, postnatal, and mature hyaline cartilages and to determine information on the structure and function of chondrocyte perlecan. Perlecan is a prominent component of human fetal (12-14 week) finger, toe, knee, and elbow cartilages; it was localized diffusely in the interterritorial extracellular matrix, densely in the pericellular matrix around chondrocytes, and to small blood vessels in the joint capsules and perichondrium. Aggrecan had a more intense distribution in the marginal regions of the joint rudiments and in para-articular structures. Perlecan also had a strong pericellular localization pattern in postnatal (2-7 month) and mature (55-64 year) femoral cartilages, whereas aggrecan had a prominent extracellular matrix distribution in these tissues. Western blotting identified multiple perlecan core protein species in extracts of the postnatal and mature cartilages, some of which were substituted with heparan sulfate and/or chondroitin sulfate and some were devoid of glycosaminoglycan substitution. Some perlecan core proteins were smaller than intact perlecan, suggesting that proteolytic processing or alternative splicing had occurred. Surface plasmon resonance and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation experiments demonstrated that chondrocyte perlecan bound fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-1 and -9 less efficiently than endothelial cell perlecan. The latter perlecan supported the proliferation of Baf-32 cells transfected with FGFR3c equally well with FGF-1 and -9, whereas chondrocyte perlecan only supported Baf-32 cell proliferation with FGF-9. The function of perlecan therefore may not be universal but may vary with its cellular origin and presumably its structure.

The HS side chains of domain I of perlecan act as low affinity co-receptors for growth factors, such as FGF-1, -2, -7, and -9, whereas the core protein of perlecan may act as a receptor for FGF-7 (22Chang Z.

These interactions are important for the correct presentation of the FGFs to FGF receptors (FGFRs) and their subsequent oligomerization and activation, which initiates cell signaling and subsequent down-line effects on cell proliferation and differentiation (22Chang Z.

Connective tissue growth factor has also recently been shown to bind to the low density lipoprotein repeats within domain II of perlecan. Connective tissue growth factor modulates bone morphogenetic protein and transforming growth factor-β signaling and coordinates chondrogenesis and angiogenesis during skeletal development (30Abreu J.G.

Homozygous gene knock-out mice, which survive to birth, display severe skeletal defects with short axial and limb bones, cleft palate, striking abnormalities in the growth plates of their long bones, and cardiovascular abnormalities. In normal growth plates, chondrocytes are arranged into zones of resting, proliferative, and hypertrophic cells, and the cellular activities within each of these zones and the transitions between them are regulated by key signaling molecules. In perlecan knock-out mice the proliferating zone is disorganized, biosynthetic activity in the hypertrophic zone enhanced, and ossification below the growth plate is more extensive laterally than longitudinally, resulting in short squat newborn mice (35Costell M.

Perlecan has been immunolocalized to the basement membranes of all human tissues tested (1Murdoch A.D. Liu B. Schwarting R. Tuan R.S. Iozzo R.V. J. Histochem.

To date, however, despite its obvious importance to tissue growth and development, perlecan has yet to be studied in detail in human cartilage. The present study was undertaken to determine the distribution and structure of perlecan in human cartilage during fetal development, in the growing child, and in the mature adult. Unfortunately, insufficient human cartilage was available to isolate sufficient chondrocytes to undertake large scale cultures appropriate for the isolation of human chondrocyte perlecan for functional studies on growth factor binding. As an alternative, perlecan was purified from human endothelial cell and ovine chondrocyte cultures and used to study the interaction with FGF-1 and -9 and its consequences on cell proliferation. Source of Antibodies—Histochoice fixative was purchased from Amresco (Solon, OH). Monoclonal antibodies to intact HS (mAb 10E4) and to the Δ-HS stubs (mAb 3G10) generated by the action of heparitinase III were from Seikegaku Corp, Tokyo, Japan. Monoclonal antibody 7B5 to perlecan domain III was from Zymed Laboratories through Invitrogen. Monoclonal antibodies A76 and A74 to perlecan domains I and V were used as described previously (21Whitelock J.M. Graham L.D. Melrose J. Murdoch A.D. Iozzo R.V. Underwood A.

Novex HiMark protein molecular weight standards and other electrophoresis consumables were obtained from Invitrogen. Preparation of Cartilage for Histology—Six 12-20-week-old human fetuses were obtained at termination of pregnancy following ethical approval by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Royal North Shore Hospital. Tissue specimens were fixed for 3 days in Histochoice® for perlecan immunolocalization or 10% (v/v) neutral buffered formalin for aggrecan histochemistry and briefly decalcified in 10% formic acid. Postnatal human femoral condylar cartilage was obtained with ethical approval at the time of autopsy from the pathology departments at l'Hôpital Ste-Justine and the Montreal General Hospital. Tissue specimens were fixed in 4% fresh paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.2, overnight at 4 °C. The fixed tissues were then dehydrated in graded alcohols and embedded in paraplast wax using standard histology procedures. Four to seven-μm sections were cut in the coronal and sagittal vertical planes and mounted on glass slides, de-paraffinized in xylene (4 changes × 2 min), and re-hydrated through graded ethanol washes (100-70% (v/v)) to water. Histochemistry—Formalin-fixed tissue sections were routinely stained with toluidine blue using fast green counterstain to visualize proteoglycans, and with hematoxylin and eosin to examine cellular morphology prior to selection of the most appropriate specimens for detailed immunohistochemical localizations. Immunohistochemistry—Endogenous peroxidase activity was initially blocked by incubating the tissue sections with 3% H2O2. Histochoice-fixed tissue sections were pretreated with bovine testicular hyaluronidase (1000 units/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C in phosphate buffer, pH 5.0, followed by three washes in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 0.15 m NaCl (TBS). Paraformaldehyde-fixed sections were pretreated with chondroitinase ABC (0.25 units/ml) for 1 h at 37°C in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 7.5. Nonspecific binding was initially blocked by incubating the sections in 20% swine or goat serum for 30 min at room temperature. Incubations with primary antibodies to perlecan domains I (mAb A76), V (mAb A74), or III (mAb 7B5) and aggrecan G1 domain (mAb 969D411) were performed for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies were then added for 1 h. Color development was conducted with 0.05% 3,3′-diaminobenzidene dihydrochloride and 0.03% H2O2 in TBS, or with Nova RED substrates. Control sections were also prepared in which no primary antibody or an irrelevant isotype-matched primary antibody was substituted for the primary antibody of interest. Commercial isotype-matched mouse IgG (DAKO code X931), against Aspergillus niger glucose oxidase (an enzyme that is neither present nor inducible in mammalian tissues) was used for this step. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Cartilage was diced into small pieces and extracted with 10 volumes of 4 m guanidinium chloride in the presence of proteinase inhibitors (48Roughley P.J. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 217-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extracts were dialyzed into 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm CaCl2, and 20 μl of the dialyzed extract was digested with heparitinase III (1 milliunit/ml) and/or chondroitinase ABC (10 milliunits/ml) and keratanase I (5 milliunits/ml) at 37 °C for 3 h. Perlecan core proteins were then analyzed by SDS/PAGE on 4-12% NuPAGE BisTris gels (Novex) run in MOPS SDS running buffer or 3-8% NuPAGE Tris acetate gels run in Tris acetate buffer following the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (0.22 μm) using NuPAGE transfer buffer supplemented with 10% methanol. MultiMark and HiMark protein molecular weight standards were also electrophoresed for calibration purposes. Monoclonal antibodies 7B5 (1:500 dilution), A76 and A74 (1/400 dilution), and 3G10 (1/500 dilution) were used as primary antibodies. A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was used as the secondary antibody, visualization of the immune complexes utilized an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and subsequent exposure to x-ray film. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies were also used with the colorimetric substrates nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate for detection in some cases. Chondrocyte Culture and Immunopurification of Perlecan from Conditioned Media—Chondrocytes were isolated from ovine articular cartilage by sequential enzymatic digestion using Pronase, collagenase, and DNase-I as described (49Melrose J. Smith S. Ghosh P. Taylor T.K.F. Eur. Spine J. 2002; 12: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and established in monolayer culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine and gentamicin (50 μg/ml). The media was changed every 2 days and stored at -20 °C until cell growth had reached confluence, when the cells were subpassaged into fresh 175-cm2 canted neck flasks and media collected until all flasks had reached confluence. A total of 4 liter of conditioned medium was collected from the 1st and 2nd passage chondrocyte cultures. Perlecan was isolated from the chondrocyte-conditioned medium using a combination of anion exchange and immunoaffinity chromatography (50Whitelock J.M. Iozzo R.V. Methods Cell Biol. 2002; 69: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Endothelial cell perlecan was also isolated in a similar manner as described previously (21Whitelock J.M. Graham L.D.

Assessment of Perlecan Interaction with FGF-1 and FGF-9 Using Surface Plasmon Resonance—Immunopurified perlecan samples (100 μg/ml) from the ovine chondrocyte and human umbilical artery endothelial cell cultures were biotinylated in 0.1 m NaHCO3 buffer, pH 8.0, using a 50-fold molar excess of N-hydroxysuccinimido-biotin for 3 h at room temperature. Biotinylation was then terminated by the addition of an excess of 2 m NH4Cl solution and free biotin was removed from the sample by dialysis against PBS (26Knox S. Melrose J. Whitelock J.

Biotinylated perlecan samples (10 μg/ml) in PBS were coupled to streptavidin-derivatized sensor chips at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. A similar amount of each purified perlecan was immobilized to the streptavidin chips in each case as determined from the change in response units, which correlates with a change in mass of the BIAcore chip. BIAcore binding experiments with FGF-1 (200 nm) and FGF-9 (200 nm) were conducted in 0.01 m HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 20 μl/min at 25 °C using an injection volume of 50 μl. The BIAcore kinetic function was used with a programmed dissociation time of 150 s where the perlecan surface was regenerated using a 30-s pulse of 1 m NaCl or heparin (100 μg/ml). Sensograms were analyzed using BIAcore 2000 evaluation software 3.0. Sensograms were fitted with separate differential rate equations for the parts of the binding curve representing association and dissociation. Control experiments were also conducted with perlecan samples that had been pre-digested with heparitinase III to remove HS. Assessment of Perlecan Interaction with FGF-1 and FGF-9 Using Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation Monitoring (QCM-D)—Perlecan samples (10 μg/ml) in PBS were adsorbed onto gold-coated QCM-D quartz crystals (Q-Sense AB, Sweden) at a flow rate of 100 μl/min for 10 min then, under static conditions, for 50 min followed by PBS rinses (100 μl/min) for 10 min. 0.1% Bovine serum albumin in PBS (100 μl/min) was exposed to the surface for 30 min to block nonspecific binding sites before rinsing with PBS (100 μl/min) for 10 min. Binding of FGF-1 (100 ng/ml) and FGF-9 (100 ng/ml) was conducted in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS at a flow rate of 100 μl/min for 20 min with PBS rinses (100 μl/min) for 10 min and heparin (10 μg/ml) rinses at 100 μl/min for 10 min to enable surface regeneration between growth factor injections. Experiments were performed in quadruplicate simultaneously (E4, Q-Sense AB, Sweden) at 37 ± 0.1 °C. The QCM-D (51Rodahl M. Höök F. Krozer A. Brzezinski P. Kasemo B. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1995; 66: 3924-3929Crossref Scopus (1126) Google Scholar) records frequency (f) and dissipation (D) changes during the experiment. f and D responses were analyzed using QTools (Q-Sense AB, Sweden) using the Voigt model to obtain adsorbed mass estimates. The Voigt model assumes that the adsorbed layer is of uniform thickness and density, conserves its shape, and does not flow (52Voinova M.V. Rodahl M. Jonson M. Kasemo B. Phys. Scripta. 1999; 59: 391-396Crossref Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). Involvement of Perlecan/FGF Interactions in Cell Proliferation—The ability of perlecan to support cell proliferation was tested in a cell based assay that measures the signaling of FGFs by their receptors (27Knox S. Merry C. Stringer S. Melrose J. Whitelock J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14657-14665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 53Ornitz D.M. Itoh N. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 3005.1-3005.12Crossref Google Scholar). Baf-32 cells that do not express endogenous heparan sulfate proteoglycans and are transfected with the FGFR3iiic receptor isoform (kindly supplied by Prof. D. Ornitz, Washington University Medical School, St. Louis, MO) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10% media from WEHI 3BD- cells (a kind gift from the Ludwig Institute, Melbourne), G418 (400 μg/ml), and penicillin/streptomycin. Mitogenic assays were performed as outlined by Ornitz and Itoh (53Ornitz D.M. Itoh N. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 3005.1-3005.12Crossref Google Scholar), and Knox et al. (26Knox S. Melrose J. Whitelock J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 14657-14665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, Baf-32 cells were washed, resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, and seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 6 × 105 cells/50 μl/well. The wells were then made up to a volume of 150 μl with RPMI 1640 medium containing FGF-1, FGF-9, or heparin and purified perlecan samples to provide final concentrations of 5 nm for FGF-1 or -9, 2 μg/ml for heparin, and 1.25 μg/ml for the purified perlecans. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 48 h under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air and 98% humidity and 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine in 20 μl of medium was added per well and the cells incubated a further 6 h. The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation (1000 × g for 10 min) and the supernatant solution flicked from the plates to waste. This procedure was repeated three times and then the cells were resuspended in PBS (100 μl) and added to 2 ml of scintillation fluid and the samples counted on an automatic liquid scintillation counter. Control experiments were also conducted with perlecan samples that had been predigested with heparitinase III to remove HS chains. Perlecan was immunolocalized in a number of cartilaginous fetal human tissues including the interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints of the fingers and toes (Fig. 1); cartilaginous rudiments of the elbow (Fig. 2), and femoral condyle, patella, and tibial plateau of the fetal knee (Fig. 3) and postnatal adult knee articular cartilages (Fig. 4). Perlecan was a prominent extracellular matrix component of the finger and toe cartilaginous rudiments (Fig. 1, c and f-i) where it was a particularly prominent pericellular component of the hypertrophic growth plate chondrocytes (Fig. 1, f and h). Perlecan localizations in these tissues were similar to the distribution of total anionic proteoglycan staining with toluidine blue (Fig. 1a) although it was not localized strongly at the presumptive articulating joint surfaces (Fig. 1c). Perlecan was also strongly associated with small venules and arterioles in the synovial lining and perichondrial tissues of the fingers and toes (Fig. 1, g-i). Aggrecan was prominently localized predominantly at the margins of the cartilaginous rudiments in the fingers (Fig. 1d), and did not display as uniform a distribution throughout the cartilage rudiment as perlecan (Fig. 1c). Perlecan also had a widespread distribution in the cartilaginous rudiments of the fetal elbow (Fig. 2e) and knee (Fig. 3), was prominently associated with small blood vessels in the synovial lining tissues of the joint capsules (Fig. 3g) and perichondrium, and displayed diminished levels at the presumptive articulating joint surfaces where it was associated with prominent small vessel networks (Fig. 3, f and h).FIGURE 2Immunolocalization of perlecan using anti-perlecan domain I mAb A76 (e), aggrecan using an anti-aggrecan G1 domain 946D4D11 mAb (f), and anionic proteoglycan using toluidine blue-fast green stain (a) in vertical mid-sagittal sections of the cartilaginous rudiments of a human fetal (14 week) elbow, the humerus is to the left and the ulna to the right hand side of the figure. Perlecan has a diffuse matrix and a strong pericellular distribution pattern throughout the cartilaginous rudiment of the fetal human elbow (e), aggrecan, however, has predominantly an extracellular distribution pattern and is also strongly localized in ligamentous and periarticular tissues in the elbow joint cavity (f).

The enzyme oxidizes cellulose- and hemicellulose-derived aldopyranoses at C2 preferentially, but also on C3, to the corresponding ketoaldoses. To investigate the structural determinants of catalysis, covalent flavinylation, substrate binding, and regioselectivity, wild-type and mutant P2Ox enzymes were produced and characterized biochemically and structurally. Removal of the histidyl-FAD linkage resulted in a catalytically competent enzyme containing tightly, but noncovalently bound FAD. This mutant (H167A) is characterized by a 5-fold lower kcat, and a 35-mV lower redox potential, although no significant structural changes were seen in its crystal structure. In previous structures of P2Ox, the substrate loop (residues 452-457) covering the active site has been either disordered or in a conformation incompatible with carbohydrate binding. We present here the crystal structure of H167A in complex with a slow substrate, 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose. Based on the details of 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose binding in position for oxidation at C3, we also outline a probable binding mode for d-glucose positioned for regioselective oxidation at C2. The tentative determinant for discriminating between the two binding modes is the position of the O6 hydroxyl group, which in the C2-oxidation mode can make favorable interactions with Asp452 in the substrate loop and, possibly, a nearby arginine residue (Arg472). We also substantiate our hypothesis with steady-state kinetics data for the alanine replacements of Asp452 and Arg472 as well as the double alanine 452/472 mutant.

These fungi are the only known microorganisms that are capable of fully mineralizing lignin, and P2Ox has a proposed role in the oxidative events (4ten Have R. Teunissen P.J. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 3397-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) of lignin degradation by providing the essential co-substrate, H2O2, for lignin and manganese peroxidases (5Ander P. Marzullo L.

An alternative hypothesis assigns a role for P2Ox in both H2O2 production and in the reduction of quinones in the periplasm or in the extracellular environment (7Leitner C. Volc J. Haltrich D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 3636-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). P2Ox from the white-rot fungi Trametes multicolor (Trametes ochracea) and Peniophora gigantea are hitherto the most studied biochemically (7Leitner C. Volc J. Haltrich D. Appl. Environ.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11683-11690Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). P2Ox oxidizes a broad range of carbohydrate substrates that are natural constituents of hemicelluloses, allowing most lignocellulose-derived sugars to be utilized. Substrates can be oxidized regioselectively at the C2 position, although some oxidation at C3 can occur as a side reaction (10Freimund S. Huwig A. Giffhorn F. Köpper S. Chem. Eur. J. 1998; 4: 2442-2455Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For C2 oxidation, d-glucose, d-xylose, and l-sorbose are good or reasonably good substrates, and d-galactose and l-arabinose perform poorly as substrates (7Leitner C. Volc J. Haltrich D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 3636-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Based on the catalytic efficiency, kcat/Km, d-glucose (d-Glc) is the best substrate for T. multicolor P2Ox (7Leitner C. Volc J. Haltrich D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 3636-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Substrates that are oxidized at C3 were analyzed for P. gigantea P2Ox and include 2-deoxy-d-glucose, 2-keto-d-glucose, and methyl β-d-glucosides (13Volc J. Sedmera P. Havlícek V. Prikrylová V. Daniel G. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 278: 59-70Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 10Freimund S. Huwig A. Giffhorn F. Köpper S. Chem. Eur. J. 1998; 4: 2442-2455Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). That oxidation can take place either at C2 or at C3 presupposes two distinct, productive binding modes (referred to here as C2ox and C3ox) for a monosaccharide in the P2Ox active site. P2Ox from T. multicolor is homotetrameric with a molecular mass of 270 kDa (7Leitner C. Volc J. Haltrich D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 3636-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) where each of the four subunits carries one FAD molecule bound covalently to Nϵ2 (i.e. N3) of His167 via its 8α-methyl group (14Halada P. Leitner C. Sedmera P. Haltrich D. Volc J. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 314: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 11Hallberg B.M. Leitner C. Haltrich D. Divne C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The cofactor displays typical absorption maxima at 456, 345, and 275 nm (7Leitner C. Volc J. Haltrich D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 3636-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The reaction mechanism of P2Ox is of the type Ping Pong Bi Bi typically found in flavoprotein oxidoreductases (15Artolozaga M.J. Kubátová E. Volc. J. Kalisz H.M. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1997; 47: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Massey V. Curti B. Rochi S. Zanetti G. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Water DeGruyter & Co., Berlin, Germany1991: 59-66Google Scholar). In the reductive half-reaction, an aldopyranose substrate reduces the FAD cofactor to yield reduced flavin (FADH2) and 2-ketoaldose (aldos-2-ulose) as a result of oxidation at position C2 of the sugar substrate (1Daniel G. Volc J. Kubátová E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 2524-2532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Freimund S. Huwig A. Giffhorn F. Köpper S. Chem. Eur. J. 1998; 4: 2442-2455Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The ensuing oxidative half-reaction involves the re-oxidation of FADH2 by the second substrate, O2, to yield H2O2 and the oxidized cofactor (Reactions 1 and 2).FAD +D−glucose→FADH2+2−keto−D−glucose1 FADH2+O2→FAD+H2O22 We have reported recently the 1.8-Å crystal structure of T. multicolor P2Ox in complex with acetate (nsP2OxACT), a competitive inhibitor (11Hallberg B.M. Leitner C. Haltrich D. Divne C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The overall subunit structure of P2Ox belongs to the glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) family of FAD-dependent oxidoreductases (17Albrecht M. Lengauer T. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1216-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 18Hallberg B.M. Leitner C. Haltrich D. Divne C. Acta Crystallog. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 197-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) with the cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) flavoprotein from Phanerochaete chrysosporium as the closest family relative (11Hallberg B.M. Leitner C. Haltrich D. Divne C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The GMC family is also represented by, among others, the enzymes glucose 1-oxidase from Aspergillus niger (19Hecht H.J. Kalisz H.M. Schmid Hendle J.R.D. Schomburg D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 153-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) and cholesterol oxidase from Brevibacterium sterolicum (20Vrielink A. Lloyd L.F. Blow D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 533-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The active site of P2Ox was found to contain the conserved catalytic His-Asn center also present in CDH and cholesterol oxidase (His-His pair in glucose 1-oxidase). A loop that comprises residues 452DAFSYG457 (ab hinc, substrate loop) closes off the active site and interacts closely with the acetate ligand trapped in a pocket in front of the flavin cofactor (11Hallberg B.M. Leitner C. Haltrich D. Divne C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In silico modeling of substrate demonstrated that the observed loop conformation is not compatible with binding of a monosaccharide substrate, and that this restriction is mainly due to the position of the Phe454 and Tyr456 side chains. Thus, we predicted that the loop must be dynamic and allowed to undergo a major conformational change to bind a sugar (11Hallberg B.M. Leitner C. Haltrich D. Divne C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and that only when binding smaller, structurally compatible molecules such as acetate, or electron-acceptor substrates such as dioxygen, the loop would be in an ordered, closed conformation as that observed for nsP2OxACT (11Hallberg B.M. Leitner C. Haltrich D. Divne C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Moreover, the dynamic substrate loop appeared as a suitable candidate for discriminating between different carbohydrate substrates, for different orientations of the same carbohydrate, as well as for electron-donor substrate (carbohydrate) versus electron-acceptor substrates (dioxygen, quinone compounds, and others) (18Hallberg B.M. Leitner C. Haltrich D. Divne C. Acta Crystallog. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 197-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Here we report the cloning, heterologous overexpression, biochemical characterization, and crystal-structure analyses of recombinant wild-type and mutant forms of T. multicolor P2Ox. The mutant variants discussed include the His-tagged asparagine replacement of the catalytic His548 (His6-H548N), the alanine replacement of His167 responsible for covalent flavinylation (His6-H167A), and the variants probing regioselective oxidation, e.g. alanine replacements of Asp452 and Arg472 as well as the combined double mutant. The crystal structures of unliganded forms of His-tagged recombinant wild-type P2Ox (His6-rP2Ox), His6-H548N, and His6-H167A are described, as well as that of His6-H167A in complex with the substrate analog 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (2FG). The results reported herein provide, for the first time, a detailed description of the structural determinants for substrate binding by P2Ox, and specifically, the role of the substrate loop in the C3ox substrate-binding mode. Our results also offer an explanation for regioselective C2 versus C3 oxidation by P2Ox. Isolation of a Genomic Clone for T. multicolor P2Ox—Genomic DNA from T. multicolor MB49 was isolated as described in a previous study (21Ausubel F.B.R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. Wiley, New York2002Google Scholar). A fragment of the genomic p2o gene was amplified with PCR using primers Tmup2oFOR2 (5′-gtcgagtaccagaagaacatcga(ct)aa(ag)tt(ct)-3′) and Tmup2oREV2 (5′-tgaccttctcgttccacca(ag)tc-3′), derived from internal peptide sequences of purified P2Ox protein, genomic DNA as a template, and a standard PCR program (annealing temperature of 55 °C, 2-min extension). The resulting 1.2-kb fragment was cloned into plasmid pCR2.1 (TOPO TA Cloning Kit, Invitrogen) and verified as representing a fragment of the p2o gene by sequencing. A genomic library of T. multicolor was constructed in the lGEM11 bacteriophage vector (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The GOLD packaging extract (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and Escherichia coli LE 392 host bacteria were used. The digoxigenin-labeled PCR-amplified fragments of the p2o gene were used to screen (PCR DIG probe synthesis kit, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) the genomic library (21Ausubel F.B.R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. Wiley, New York2002Google Scholar). Positive phage clones were analyzed by restriction digests and Southern hybridizations (21Ausubel F.B.R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. Wiley, New York2002Google Scholar). DNA fragments covering the complete coding region of the p2o gene, including flanking 5′ and 3′ regions, were subcloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene) and sequenced. Isolation and Expression of p2o cDNA—T. multicolor MB49 was cultivated for 7 days in baffled Erlenmeyer flasks at 25 °C and 120 rpm in a medium containing whey powder (30 g/liter), peptone from casein (10 g/liter), and KH2PO4 (1 g/liter). Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 5 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the Reverse Transcription system (Promega) with an anchor primer (5′-ggc cac gcg tcg act agt act ttt ttt ttt ttt ttt tt-3′) for first strand synthesis. p2o cDNA was amplified with proofreading Pfu DNA polymerase, a Universal Primer specific for the multiple cloning site in the anchor primer, and a primer targeted to the sequence immediately upstream of the start codon of the p2o gene (Tmup2ocDNAFOR, 5′-act aca cca gca tgt ct cc-3′; sequence information derived from genomic DNA). The resulting cDNA fragment of ∼2 kb was cloned into pCR2.1 after addition of a 3′ overhanging adenine residue (Qiagen A Addition Kit) to give plasmid pCL12. For heterologous expression, the obtained cDNA was re-amplified using oligonucleotide primers Tmup2oNcoFOR (5′-act aca cca cca tgg cta cca gct cga gc-3′), specific to the 5′-end of the coding region and containing an NcoI site, and Tmup2oNotREV or Tmup2oNotREV2 (5′-gcg agc gac cgc ggc cgc agc ctc-3′ and 5′-gcg agc ggc cgc tca ctg agc ctc-3′, for expression with and without the His6 tag, respectively), specific to the 3′-end and containing a NotI site. The resulting amplicon was digested with NcoI and NotI, gel-purified, and ligated with the appropriately cut and purified expression vector pET21 d(+) (Novagen, Merck Biosciences, Darmstadt, Germany) to give plasmid pHL2. Verified expression vectors were subsequently transformed into the production strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen). Several clones were grown in 3 ml of M9 medium containing 10 g/liter glycerol and 10 g/liter peptone from casein, induced by addition of 0.5% lactose (according to the pET-Vector system manual), and tested for presence of active P2Ox protein. Cultivation on a larger scale to provide material for biochemical characterization was done in 1-liter shake flasks containing 200 ml of medium at 200 rpm and 37 °C. Construction of P2Ox Variants—Point mutations in plasmid pHL2 were introduced using the GeneTailor Kit (Invitrogen). Mutation H167A was constructed with primers: p2oGT-H167A-FOR (5′-tcggaggcatgtctacggcctggacatgcgccac-3′), carrying two base changes (bold characters, ca → gc), and p2oGT-H167A-REV (5′-agacatgcctccgacgacgcgcgtgaccgcctg-3′). The H548N mutation was constructed with primers p2oGT-H548N-FOR (5′-tcatggagcctggtcttgtccttaaccttggtgg-3′) and p2oGT-H548N-REV (5′-acaagaccaggctccatgaattgcgggagg-3′), the D452A mutation was constructed with primers p2oGT-D452A-FOR (5′-actcagatccaccgcgctgctttcagttac-3′) and p2oGT-D452A-REV (5′-gcggtggatctgagtgtgccacgggtg-3′), and the R472A mutation was constructed by using primers p2oGT-R472A-FOR (5′-ctcatcgtggactgggccttcttcggccgg-3′) and p2oGT-R472A-REV (5′-ccagtccacgatgagacgcgagtc-3′). The mutant plasmids were isolated, and the mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Enzyme Preparation and Purification—The pellet was re-suspended in a 3-fold volume of 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 50 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and passed through a French Press at 1,000 p.s.i. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris, and the supernatant was passed through a 50-ml Ni2+-immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) column (Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow, Amersham Biosciences). After washing the column with washing buffer, adsorbed proteins were eluted with imidazole buffer as per the manufacturer's recommendations, and fractions were analyzed for P2Ox activity using the activity assay based on ABTS/peroxidase described in a previous study (7Leitner C. Volc J. Haltrich D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 3636-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In case of remaining impurities as assessed by SDS-PAGE using a PHAST-System (Amersham Biosciences), and if maximum homogeneity was desired, pooled fractions were passed through a 180-ml Superose 12 gel-filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). Steady-state Kinetics and UV-visible Spectra—P2Ox activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 420 nm and 30 °C by measuring the formation of H2O2 for 3 min in a peroxidase-coupled assay using ABTS (ϵ420 = 43,200 m-1 cm-1) as the chromogen (7Leitner C. Volc J. Haltrich D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 3636-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The standard assay mixture contained 1 mm ABTS in potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 6.5), 2 units/ml horseradish peroxidase, 100 mm d-Glc, and a suitable amount of the P2Ox sample, using air-saturated solutions. One unit of P2Ox activity is defined as the amount of enzyme necessary for the oxidation of 2 μmol of ABTS per minute under the given conditions. Kinetic studies were carried out at 30 °C in phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) using the routine ABTS-peroxidase assay as outlined above. UV-visible spectra were recorded for rP2Ox and H167A using a Beckman DU 800 spectrophotometer at room temperature. Measurements were performed in 50 mm phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 and 8.0. The enzyme was reduced using 10 mm d-Glc. Reduction Potential Determination of rP2Ox and H167A—Reduction potential measurement of rP2Ox and the H167A mutant (both with and without expression vector derived polyhistidine tag) were carried out by using xanthine and xanthine oxidase as the reduction system (16Massey V. Curti B. Rochi S. Zanetti G. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Water DeGruyter & Co., Berlin, Germany1991: 59-66Google Scholar). Briefly, a solution of enzyme, xanthine, standard dye, and xanthine oxidase (side arm) in a specially designed cuvette equipped with two side arms and a stopcock was made anaerobic by repeated cycles of evacuation and flushing with oxygen-free nitrogen. After anaerobiosis had been established, the reaction was initiated by adding xanthine oxidase from the side arm. For measurement of the wild type, indigo carmineEm0=−116 mV was used as standard dye, and a solution of dye and enzyme was reduced slowly over a period of 12 h. The reduction of His6-rP2Ox was monitored at 459 nm, an isosbestic point for indigo carmine reduction, and indigo carmine reduction was monitored at 608 nm where the enzyme has no absorbance. These absorbance values were used to calculate the ratio of the reduced and oxidized species at various stages during the reduction process. The midpoint potential(Em0) can be calculated using the standard Nernst equation. For H167A, the same experiment was performed but with cresyl violet(Em0=−166 mV) as standard dye. Reduction of His6-rP2Ox and His6-H167A by 2FG—The capability of 2FG to reduce the FAD cofactor in P2Ox was investigated. A solution of the enzyme (20 μm)in50mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 25 °C was made anaerobic as described above. Then, 2FG (147 μm) in the side arm was tipped into the enzyme solution. The reduction of His6-rP2Ox was monitored at 456 nm, and kobs was analyzed from a single-exponential decay of a plot of absorbance at 456 nm with time. The reduction of His6-H167A by 2FG was measured by monitoring absorbance at 453 nm over a period of 4 days. All reduction reactions were kept in the dark to avoid light-induced reduction of the flavin. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Refinement—Crystals of the recombinant proteins were obtained in the presence of 12-13% monomethylether polyethylene glycol 2000, 0.1 m Mes (pH 5.2), 50 mm MgCl2, and 25% glycerol using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method and microseeding. Equal volumes of protein solution (4 mg/ml in 20 mm Mes, pH 5.2) and reservoir were mixed to prepare the drops. For the ligand complex, 2FG was added by co-crystallization (H167A2FG, 12 mm 2FG). Data were collected at 100 K using synchrotron radiation. Crystallographic refinement was performed with REFMAC5 (22Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallog. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13818) Google Scholar) and included anisotropic scaling, calculated hydrogen scattering from riding hydrogens, and atomic displacement parameter refinement using the translation, libration, screw-rotation model. Corrections of the models were done manually with the guidance of σA-weighted 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron-density maps. The same set of Rfree reflections was used throughout all refinement, and NCS restraints/constraints were not used. Model building, coordinate manipulation, and least-squares comparisons were made with the programs O (23Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallog. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar) and Coot (24Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23012) Google Scholar). Figs. 3 and 4 were prepared using PyMOL version 0.93 (pymol.sourceforge.net).FIGURE 4Productive binding modes of d-glucose in the C2 and C3 orientations. A, observed binding of 2FG to the His6-H167A2FG active site. Unbiased electron density for the carbohydrate and part of the flavin ring. The electron density was calculated using an early model where the ligand had not yet been included. B, observed binding of 2FG in the C3-oxidation orientation, and in the theoretical C2-oxidation orientation (C). In C, the protein model from the His6-H167A2FG complex was used for modeling the C2 orientation. The 2FG molecule was rotated 180° about an axis defined roughly by a line running through a point midway between the glucose atoms C5 and O5, and a point midway between atoms C2 and C3.

Screening of a genomic library of T. multicolor using this fragment as a probe yielded two positive clones, which appeared to contain identical chromosomal inserts, as was judged by restriction enzyme mapping. One of the two clones was further characterized, 4460 bp were sequenced and found to contain the complete coding sequence, including flanking 5′ and 3′ regions. Based on preliminary translation, which was aided by comparison to the Coriolus versicolor PROD sequence (GenBank™ accession number D73369) and by known sequence tags, the putative start codon was identified, and a cDNA fragment was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR based on the sequence information from the genomic DNA. The sequence of the fragment was found to be identical to a T. ochracea p2o sequence (GenBank™ accession number AY291124 (25Vecerek B. Maresova H. Kocanova M. Kyslik P. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2003; 64: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)) that was deposited in GenBank™ during the course of this work. The genomic DNA (GenBank™ accession number AY753305) contains a coding region of 2723 bp, which is interrupted by 15 introns. The intron length varies between 51 and 62 bp, with an average length of 56, 5′- and 3′-splice sites generally conform to the established consensus sequences for fungal introns (26Gurr S.J. Unkles S.E. Kinghorn J.R. Kinghorn J.R. Gene Structure in Eukaryotic Microbes. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 93-139Google Scholar) GTR and YAG, with only three exceptions altogether (5′-GCA and 5′-GTC in introns VI and VIII, respectively, and AAG-3′ in intron XII). However, a high occurrence of the motif CTCA rather than the consensus CTRA (in 9 introns) in the putative lariat sequences can be observed. Exon V is unusually short (only 9 bp), as well as exon XI (20 bp). The only other available genomic sequence of a pyranose oxidase gene is from Phanerochaete chrysosporium, the entire genome of which was sequenced by the U.S. Dept. of Energy (Joint Genome Initiative, www.jgi.doe.gov). The P. chrysosporium gene contains 14 introns of very similar lengths, whose positions within the gene, however, are not quite identical to the respective positions in the T. multicolor gene. It also features a very short exon V (10 bp) in the same position as the Trametes gene. An investigation of the 5′-regulatory region of p2o using the programs PATCH and MATCH (hosted at the Expasy-MB-Server, www.expasy.ch) yielded several motifs similar to established transcription factor binding sites, notably two StuA-binding sites (-515 and -732) and two AbaA sites (-689 and -1025 (27Adams T.H. Wieser J.K Yu J.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 35-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Heterologous Expression of p2o cDNA and Production of Recombinant Enzymes—We chose the pET expression system for an initial attempt to heterologously express the p2o cDNA. The full-length cDNA was re-amplified with oligonucleotide primers containing NcoI and NotI restriction sites, respectively, to allow insertion of the amplicon using the native start codon, thereby omitting the T7 tag that is provided by the vector. An expression vector containing the reading frame of p2o fused in-frame with the His6 tag to allow simplified purification of the recombinant protein was constructed as well as a vector for expression of a native, untagged protein. The resulting vectors were transformed into the production strain BL21(DE3), and resulting clones were tested for the presence of active P2Ox protein. Clones producing active enzyme were selected for further analysis, and recombinant protein was purified from cell-free extract prepared from lactose-induced"
https://openalex.org/W2022408616,"Human neuroblastoma I-type cells have been proposed as a population of malignant neural crest stem cells, based on their high tumorigenic potential, expression of stem cell markers, and ability to differentiate into cells of neural crest lineages, including neuroblastic (N-type) and Schwann/glial (S-type) cells. Here, we demonstrate at single cell levels that a subpopulation of I-type cells possess clonogenic self-renewal capacity that requires the Polycomb group family transcription repressor Bmi-1. We further show that Bmi-1 expression levels exert an instructive influence on lineage commitment by I-type cells. Spontaneous and induced differentiation of I-type cells into S-type cells is accompanied by a marked reduction in the level of Bmi-1 expression, and enforced down-regulation of BMI-1 facilitates spontaneous differentiation of I-type cells into S-type cells. By contrast, N-type neuroblastoma cell lines and differentiated N-type cells express higher levels of Bmi-1 relative to I-type cells, and overexpression of BMI-1 promotes the differentiation of I-type cells along the neuronal lineage. Thus, Bmi-1 acts in a concentration-dependent manner in the control of the delicate balance between the self-renewal and differentiation of neuroblastoma I-type cells. These observations suggest that graded activation of a master regulator within individual tumors could trigger divergent developmental programs responsible for both tumor growth and heterogeneity.

Neuroblastoma is a common childhood malignant tumor of the sympathetic nervous system (1Brodeur G.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar), arising in sympathetic ganglia and adrenal medulla that are derived from neural crest stem cells (2Anderson D.J. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 276-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 3Dyer M.A. J. Clin. Pathol. 2004; 57: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Clinically, neuroblastoma is a heterogeneous group of tumors, displaying histopathological features that range from tumors with predominant undifferentiated neuroblasts to those largely consisting of fully differentiated neurons surrounded by a dense stroma of Schwann cells (1Brodeur G.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar, 4Castleberry R.P. Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 1430-1437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Cell lines established from human neuroblastomas also show the same cellular heterogeneity. Based on morphological appearances, biochemical properties, and growth patterns, three major cell types have been identified in neuroblastoma cell lines, which were designated as N- (neuroblastic), S- (substrate-adherent and non-neuronal), and I-type (intermediate) neuroblastoma cells (5Ross R.A. Biedler J.L. Spengler B.A. Cancer Lett. 2003; 197: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). N-type cells, the most common cell type in neuroblastoma cell lines, have small and rounded cell bodies, scant cytoplasm, and neurite-like processes. They attach poorly to the substrate and often form focal aggregates in culture. These cells express neurofilaments and enzymes specific to noradrenergic neurons. S-type cells have large and flattened bodies with abundant cytoplasm, display an epithelial- or glial-like morphology, and grow in culture as a monolayer. These cells express no neuronal markers, but show a protein expression pattern consistent with Schwann/melanoblastic cell lineages of the neural crest (6Biedler J. Helson L. Spengler B. Cancer Res. 1973; 33: 2643-2652PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ross R. Spengler B. Biedler J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1983; 77: 741-749Google Scholar, 8Ross R.A. Biedler J.L.

Pathol. 1987; 128: 484-496PubMed Google Scholar). Of particular interest are I-type cells that have a morphology intermediate to those of N- and S-type cells. These cells have small but flattened cell bodies with or without neurite-like processes, attach modestly to the substrate, and express low levels of both N- and S-type cell marker proteins (12Ciccarone V. Spengler B.A. Meyers M.B. Biedler J.L. Ross R.A. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 219-225PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that I-type cells may represent a population of neuroblastoma stem cells or malignant neural crest stem cells. First, I-type cells are multipotent and can differentiate to either N- or S-type cells when induced by specific agents (13Ross R.A. Spengler B.A. Domenech C. Porubcin M. Rettig W.J. Biedler J.L. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 449-456PubMed Google Scholar). Second, I-type cells express stem cell markers CD133 and c-kit (14Walton J.D. Kattan D.R. Thomas S.K. Spengler B.A. Guo H.F. Biedler J.L. Cheung N.K. Ross R.A. Neoplasia. 2004; 6: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Finally, in comparison with N- and S-type cells, I-type cells exhibit significantly higher clonogenic activity in soft agar culture and tumorigenic potential in immunodeficient mice, and their numbers in primary neuroblastoma tumors correlate with disease progression (5Ross R.A. Biedler J.L. Spengler B.A. Cancer Lett. 2003; 197: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 14Walton J.D. Kattan D.R. Thomas S.K. Spengler B.A. Guo H.F. Biedler J.L. Cheung N.K. Ross R.A. Neoplasia. 2004; 6: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Bmi-1 is a member of the Polycomb group family of transcription repressors that was originally identified as an oncogenic partner of c-Myc in murine lymphomagenesis (15Haupt Y. Alexander W.S. Barri G. Klinken S.P. Adams J.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 753-763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 16van Lohuizen M. Verbeek S. Scheijen B. Wientjens E. van der Gulden H. Berns A. Cell. 1991; 65: 737-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). It is a component of the Polycomb repressive complex 1, which represses gene expression through chromatin modifications (17Valk-Lingbeek M.E. Bruggeman S.W. van Lohuizen M. Cell. 2004; 118: 409-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Bmi-1 has diverse biological functions as demonstrated by phenotypic analysis of mice lacking Bmi-1. These mice are defective in axial skeleton patterning and hematopoiesis, and have neurological abnormalities (18van der Lugt N.M. Domen J. Linders K. van Roon M. Robanus-Maandag E. te Riele H. van der Valk M. Deschamps J. Sofroniew M. van Lohuizen M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 757-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Further studies revealed that Bmi-1 is required for the self-renewing proliferation of several types of normal and cancer stem cells, including neural crest stem cells (19Iwama A. Oguro H. Negishi M.

In this study, we characterized the stem cell activities of neuroblastoma I-type cells and their regulation, using the human neuroblastoma cell line BE(2)-C as a model. BE(2)-C cells have a typical I-type phenotype, and show consistent morphological and biochemical responses to differentiation-inducing agents (13Ross R.A. Spengler B.A. Domenech C. Porubcin M. Rettig W.J. Biedler J.L. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 449-456PubMed Google Scholar). Our study demonstrates the existence in the BE(2)-C cell line of a subpopulation of cells with stem cell-like activities and a critical role of Bmi-1 expression levels in regulation of their clonogenic self-renewal and multilineage differentiation. Cell Culture and Differentiation Assays—The human neuroblastoma and glioblastoma cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). The human neuroblastoma I-type BE(2)-C cells (ATCC CRL-2268) were subcultured at the split ratio of 1:5 every 3 days. Unless indicated, all of the studies were conducted with BE(2)-C cells and their derivatives that had been cultured for less than 12 passages. For differentiation assays, BrdUrd 3The abbreviations used are: BrdUrd, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; RA, all-trans-retinoic acid; Shh, Sonic Hedgehog; siRNA, small interfering RNA; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. and RA (Sigma) were dissolved in Me2SO and 10 mm stock solutions were prepared. BE(2)-C cells were treated with 10 μm RA for 1-2 weeks or with 10 μm BrdUrd for 2-3 weeks. BE(2)-C cells treated with Me2SO were used as negative control. Soft Agar Clonogenic Assays—BE(2)-C cells were mixed in 0.3% Noble agar (in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum) and plated at 1000 cells/well onto 6-well plates containing a solidified bottom layer (0.6% Noble agar in the same growth medium). After 14 days, colonies were either unstained or stained with 5 mg/ml MTT (Sigma), and photographed. For serial soft agar assays, individual colonies were removed from the agar with sterile Pasteur pipettes and pooled. After brief treatment with trypsin, colonies were mechanically dissociated into single cell suspensions and replated at 1000 cells/well (6-well plates). Immunofluorescence—For spontaneous differentiation assays, individual primary and secondary BE(2)-C colonies in soft agar were transferred onto laminin-coated glass coverslips and allowed to adhere for 24 h. For agent-induced differentiation assays, secondary colonies were dissociated into single cell suspensions and plated on coverslips, followed by 10 μm RA or BrdUrd treatment. The colonies and cells were fixed with a solution of 95% ethanol and 5% glacial acetic acid at -20 °C for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 5 min, and blocked with 5% milk for 1 h. Cells were incubated at 4 °C overnight with primary antibodies as follows: 1:100 HNK-1 (IgM) mouse monoclonal antibody (BD Pharmingen); 1:400 peripherin rabbit antiserum (Chemicon); 1:200 GFAP rabbit polyclonal antibody (Sigma); 1:200 vimentin mouse monoclonal antibody (sc-6260, Santa Cruz); and 1:100 S100 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Dako Cytomation). After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with 1:1000 Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse IgG, 1:1000 Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG, 1:1000 phycoerythrin rat anti-mouse IgM, or 1:800 fluorescein goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were stained with DAPI (300 nm in phosphate-buffered saline) to visualize nuclei and photographed with a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope with Image-Pro Plus software for image analysis. Retroviral Constructs and Infection—pBabe-puro/BMI-1 (24Itahana K. Zou Y. Itahana Y. Martinez J.L. Beausejour C. Jacobs J.J. Van Lohuizen M. Band V. Campisi J. Dimri G.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) was used to overexpress human BMI-1 in BE(2)-C cells. For down-regulation of BMI-1, synthesized 64-bp oligonucleotides containing the human BMI-1 siRNA sequences (5′-ATGAAGAGAAGAAGGGATT-3′ and 5′-AATGGACATACCTAATACT-3′, positions 269-287 and 546-574 bp relative to the start codon, respectively) were cloned into the HindIII and BglII sites in pSuper-retro-puro (OligoEngine) to generate pSuper-retro/BMI-1si 1 and 2. Retroviral production and infection were performed as described previously (25Cui H. Schroering A. Ding H.F. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 679-686PubMed Google Scholar). One day after retroviral infection, cells were cultured in the presence of puromycin for 3 days, and drug-resistant cells were pooled. Immunoblotting—Cells were suspended in the standard SDS sample buffer. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit, using bovine serum albumin as reference. 50 μg of proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with 1:600 Bmi-1 mouse monoclonal antibody (229F6, Upstate); 1:200 vimentin mouse monoclonal antibody (sc-6260, Santa Cruz); 1:2000 peripherin rabbit antiserum (Chemicon); or 1:10000 α-tubulin mouse monoclonal antibody (B-5-1-2, Sigma). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000, ICN) were used as secondary antibodies. Proteins were visualized with a SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence kit (Pierce) and quantified with a Kodak Image Station 440CF. A Subpopulation of BE(2)-C Cells Possess Clonogenic Self-renewal Capacity—Self-renewal is an essential property of stem cells, which, by definition, is the ability to generate progeny cells with the same developmental potential as their parental cells. Two in vitro clonogenic assays have been widely used to determine the self-renewal capacity of individual stem cells. In the sphere formation assay, cells are plated at a clonal density so that individual cells will form spatially distinct spheres (26Reynolds B.A. Weiss S. Science. 1992; 255: 1707-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (4592) Google Scholar). In the colony formation assay, soft agar or methylcellulose is used as the semisolid support media to prevent the migration of cells, which also leads to the formation of spatially distinct colonies (27Buick R.N. MacKillop W.J. Br. J. Cancer. 1981; 44: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 28Hamburger A.W. Salmon S.E. Science. 1977; 197: 461-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar, 29Thomson S.P. Meyskens Jr., F.L. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 4606-4613PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies suggest that the capacity of anchorage-independent growth is a property of stem cells (30Wicha M.S. Liu S. Dontu G. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1883-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). In both clonogenic assays, a primary sphere or colony is dissociated into single cells and replated. Formation of new spheres or colonies that maintain a multilineage potential demonstrates self-renewal. BE(2)-C cells did not form spheres under a variety of culture conditions (data not shown), therefore, we examined their capacity to undergo clonogenic self-renewal in serial soft agar assays. BE(2)-C cells were plated at 1000 cells per well (6-well culture plates). Examination of the wells under a microscope immediately after plating revealed mostly individual cells (>95%, data not shown). Colonies, defined as a collection of more than 50 cells, appeared between 10 and 14 days after plating (Fig. 1A, 10 well). Based on the calculation by dividing the number of colonies by the number of cells plated, we estimated that ∼20% of BE(2)-C cells were able to give rise to colonies in soft agar (cloning efficiency). Individual primary colonies containing more than 100 cells were removed from the agar with sterile Pasteur pipettes, pooled, and dissociated into single cell suspensions. The cells were replated at 1000 cells per well. The single cell nature of the suspensions was again confirmed by microscopy. After 2 weeks, secondary (20) colonies were formed that were similar in size to the primary colonies (Fig. 1, 20 well). Notably, cells replated from 20, 30, and 40 colonies showed a gradual increase in cloning efficiency (from ∼20% in passage 20 to ∼60% in passage 50), indicating an expansion of clonogenic BE(2)-C cells during the successive soft agar assays. The largest colonies contained more than 5000 cells, which required at least 12 cell divisions for a single cell to achieve the number. Thus, at the end of the successive soft agar assays, a subpopulation of BE(2)-C cells must have undergone at least 60 cell divisions. We also performed serial soft agar assays with BE(2)-C cells from individual colonies. At each passage, single colonies of similar size (containing more than 500 cells) were removed from soft agar and dissociated into single cells, and the entire progeny of each colony was plated into one well of 6-well plates. In all cases, we observed the formation of colonies within 2 weeks (data not shown). Together, these data demonstrate that a subpopulation of BE(2)-C cells can maintain and expand themselves over extended clonal passages in soft agar. To ascertain that the colonies were clones of individual BE(2)-C cells, we mixed equal numbers of BE(2)-C cells that were infected with either vector control (pBabe-puro) or green fluorescent protein-expressing (pBabe-GFP) retroviruses. We examined at least 100 primary and secondary colonies in two independent experiments, and observed no colonies of mixed nature (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that the colonies arose from single cells and not from cell aggregates. Clonally Derived BE(2)-C Progeny Cells Retain the Capacity to Undergo Spontaneously Multilineage Differentiation—We next determined whether the clonally derived BE(2)-C progeny cells retain the differentiation potential of their parental cells by immunofluorescence staining of primary and secondary colonies for lineage markers HNK-1, peripherin, and GFAP. HNK-1 is a marker for avian and human neural crest stem cells (31Bronner-Fraser M. Dev. Biol. 1987; 123: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 32Tucker G.C. Delarue M. Zada S. Boucaut J.C. Thiery J.P. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 251: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It is also expressed in histologically immature neuroblastoma cells, with subsequent loss of expression in more differentiated cells (33Hoehner J.C. Hedborg F. Eriksson L. Sandstedt B. Grimelius L. Olsen L. Pahlman S. Lab. Investig. 1998; 78: 29-45PubMed Google Scholar). Peripherin is expressed by neural crest-derived peripheral neurons (34Portier M.M. de Nechaud B. Gros F. Dev. Neurosci. 1983; 6: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 35Parysek L.M. Chisholm R.L. Ley C.A. Goldman R.D. Neuron. 1988; 1: 395-401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and GFAP is a marker for Schwann cells (36Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 671-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Individual primary (n = 20) and secondary colonies (n = 20) in soft agar were transferred separately onto laminin-coated coverslips, allowed to adhere for 24 h, and processed for dual immunofluorescence staining for HNK-1 and peripherin or HNK-1 and GFAP (Fig. 2). All of the primary and secondary colonies examined contained 20-60% of cells that were stained strongly for HNK-1. We also found that 20-40% of cells expressed high levels of peripherin and 5-20% of cells were stained positively for GFAP. We wanted to point out that these were approximate numbers because a significant portion of the cells remained in aggregates even after a 24-h culture on coverslips. Nonetheless, these data demonstrate that clonally derived BE(2)-C cells can spontaneously differentiate into both neurons and Schwann/glial cells. Clonally Derived BE(2)-C Progeny Cells Retain the Ability to Undergo Agent-induced Multilineage Differentiation—We further determined whether the clonally derived BE(2)-C cells, like their parental cells, can undergo agent-induced differentiation into the cells of neural crest lineages. Individual secondary colonies were dissociated into single cells, plated onto glass coverslips, and were either untreated or treated with 10 μm of RA, which induces differentiation of BE(2)-C cells into neurons (13Ross R.A. Spengler B.A. Domenech C. Porubcin M. Rettig W.J. Biedler J.L. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 449-456PubMed Google Scholar, 37Sidell N. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1982; 68: 589-596PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the untreated cells showed a typical I-type cell morphology, with a round and prominent nucleus, and relatively abundant cytoplasm (Fig. 3A, Un). Cells treated with RA for 7 days exhibited the neuronal morphology, with many long neuritic processes and small cell bodies that often formed aggregates (Fig. 3A, RA-7d). To confirm the phenotype of RA-treated BE(2)-C cells, we performed immunofluorescence staining of the cells with antibodies against HNK-1 and peripherin. Compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3, B and C, Un), RA treatment resulted in a marked decrease in the number of cells expressing HNK-1 (from an average of 45 to 21%), which was accompanied by a significant increase in the number of cells expressing peripherin (from an average of 41 to 90%) (Fig. 3, B and C, RA-7d). The up-regulation of peripherin was further confirmed by immunoblotting, which showed a progressive increase in the cellular levels of peripherin during the course of RA treatment (Fig. 3D). We noticed that a subpopulation of either untreated or RA-treated cells expressed both HNK-1 and peripherin (stained yellow in Fig. 3B), which probably represent neuronal precursors or partially differentiated neurons. It is also possible that a subpopulation of differentiated neurons continued to express HNK-1. We next treated the clonally derived BE(2)-C cells with BrdUrd, an agent inducing differentiation of BE(2)-C cells into Schwann-like S-type cells (13Ross R.A. Spengler B.A. Domenech C. Porubcin M. Rettig W.J. Biedler J.L. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 449-456PubMed Google Scholar, 38Sugimoto T. Kato T. Sawada T. Horii Y. Kemshead J.T. Hino T. Morioka H. Hosoi H. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 2531-2537PubMed Google Scholar). Cells treated with BrdUrd for 14 days displayed the morphology of S-type cells with enlarged and flattened bodies, and abundant cytoplasm (Fig. 4A, BrdU-14d). To confirm the phenotype of BrdUrd-treated BE(2)-C cells, we performed immunofluorescence staining of the cells with antibodies against GFAP, vimentin, and S100. Vimentin is an intermediate filament highly expressed in S-type neuroblastoma cells (13Ross R.A. Spengler B.A. Domenech C. Porubcin M. Rettig W.J. Biedler J.L. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 449-456PubMed Google Scholar), and S100, like GFAP, is a common marker for Schwann/glial cells (36Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 671-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Compared with untreated cells (Fig. 4, B-F, Un), BrdUrd-treated cells showed marked down-regulation of HNK-1 expression, which was accompanied by a significant increase in the number of cells that expressed GFAP, vimentin, and S100 (Fig. 4, B-F, BrdU-14d). The most dramatic change was the increase in the number of cells that expressed high levels of vimentin following BrdUrd treatment (Fig. 4C). Quantitative analysis revealed that BrdUrd treatment reduced the proportion of HNK-1-expressing BE(2)-C cells from an average of 45 to 22% and increased the vimentin-expressing cell population from an average of 12 to 92% (Fig. 4E). Consistent with the results of immunofluorescence studies, immunoblot analysis revealed a progressive increase in the cellular levels of vimentin during the course of BrdUrd treatment (Fig. 4F). These differentiation analyses, combined with the above serial soft agar clonogenic assays, demonstrate that a subpopulation of BE(2)-C cells can self-renew, generating progeny cells with the same multilineage differentiation potential of their parental cells. Differentiation is associated with exiting from the stem cell state. As expected, BE(2)-C cells treated with either RA or BrdUrd were unable to grow into colonies in soft agar (Fig. 4G), indicating a loss of their clonogenic activity. Down-regulation of BMI-1 in BE(2)-C Cells Promotes Spontaneous Differentiation Along the Schwann/Glial Lineage—It has been shown recently that Bmi-1 is essential for maintaining the self-renewal capacity of neural crest stem cells (21Molofsky A.V. Pardal R. Iwashita T. Park I.K. Clarke M.F. Morrison S.J. Nature. 2003; 425: 962-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). As neuroblastoma originates from cells of neural crest origin and BE(2)-C cells show significant levels of Bmi-1 expression (Fig. 5A), we investigated the possibility that Bmi-1 may also regulate the clonogenic self-renewal of BE(2)-C cells. We generated two BMI-1 siRNA-expressing retroviral constructs that target different regions of the human Bmi-1-coding sequence. Retroviruses produced from either construct were effective in down-regulating BMI-1 expression in BE(2)-C cells and, on average, BE(2)-C cells infected with BMI-1 siRNA-expressing retroviruses showed a 70% reduction in Bmi-1 levels (Fig. 5A, Bmi-1si). No such effect was observed in BE(2)-C cells infected with the vector control retroviruses (Fig. 5A, pSuper) or retroviruses expressing siRNA against human MYCN or p53 (data not shown), demonstrating the specificity of the BMI-1 siRNA constructs. Down-regulation of BMI-1 abrogated the ability of BE(2)-C cells to grow in soft agar (Fig. 5B), suggesting that Bmi-1 is required for the clonogenic capacity of BE(2)-C cells. The inability of the BE(2)-C cells with reduced levels of Bmi-1 to undergo clonogenic self-renewal in soft agar could result from defects in regulation of proliferation, apoptosis, and/or differentiation. We detected no significant effect of BMI-1 knockdown on the cell cycle status of BE(2)-C cells under standard culture conditions (data not shown), in agreement with previous findings in hematopoietic stem cells from Bmi-1-/- mice (19Iwama A. Oguro H. Negishi M. Kato Y. Morita Y. Tsukui H. Ema H. Kamijo T. Katoh-Fukui Y. Koseki H. van Lohuizen M. Nakauchi H. Immunity. 2004; 21: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Also, we found no significant difference in the basal levels of apoptosis between BE(2)-C cells infected with the vector control or BMI-1 siRNA-expressing retroviruses by annexin-V and trypan blue assays (data not shown). These results suggest that Bmi-1 maintains the clonogenic self-renewal capacity of BE(2)-C cells through a mechanism that is largely independent of cell cycle and apoptosis regulation. We wanted to point out that although BMI-1 knockdown had no significant effect on the cell cycle status and survival of BE(2)-C cells, long-term culture apparently selected for the subpopulation of BE(2)-C/Bmi-1si cells that retained normal levels of Bmi-1 expression. Whereas early passage (passage 9) BE(2)-C/Bmi-1si cells showed a significant reduction in the Bmi-1 level, late-passage (passage 18) BE(2)-C/Bmi-1si cells expressed Bmi-1 at a level similar to that of control BE(2)-C/pSuper cells (supplemental Fig. S1A), and regained the ability to grow in soft agar (supplemental Fig. S1B). Thus, Bmi-1 is required for sustaining long-term growth of BE(2)-C cells in the culture, most likely by maintaining their self-renewal capacity. During the study, we noticed that about 20-30% of early passage BE(2)-C/Bmi-1si cells displayed the morphology of S-type cells, with large and flattened bodies (Fig. 5C, BE(2)-C/Bmi-1si, Phase). To assess their differentiation state, immunofluorescence staining of cell lineage markers was performed. Compared with BE(2)-C/pSuper cells (Fig. 5C, pSuper), BE(2)-C/Bmi-1si cells showed a marked decrease in the expression of HNK-1 and peripherin, which was accompanied by an increase in the expression of the S-type cell markers, GFAP, vimentin, an"
https://openalex.org/W1970337062,"Tumor endothelial marker (TEM) 5 is a member of the adhesion family of G-protein-coupled receptors and up-regulated in endothelial cells during tumor and physiologic angiogenesis. Here, we report that TEM5 is expressed on the surface of endothelial cells. A soluble TEM5 (sTEM5) fragment is shed by endothelial cells during capillary-like network formation and upon growth factor stimulation. We found that sTEM5 binds to several glycosaminoglycans. Furthermore, sequence analysis and functional and biochemical studies revealed that sTEM5 contains a cryptic RGD-binding site for integrin αvβ3. Matrix metalloprotease 9-processed, but not full-length, sTEM5 mediated endothelial cell adhesion by direct interaction with integrin αvβ3. Adhesion to proteolytically processed sTEM5 (ppsTEM5) or glycosaminoglycan-bound ppsTEM5 promoted survival of growth factor deprived endothelial cells. ppsTEM5-mediated cell survival was inhibited by a function blocking integrin αvβ3 antibody. Based on our results we conclude that sTEM5 is shed by endothelial cells during angiogenesis and binds to glycosaminoglycans present on extracellular matrix and cell surface proteoglycans. Further proteolytic processing of sTEM5 leads to exposure of its RGD motif mediating endothelial cell survival by linking integrin αvβ3 to glycosaminoglycans.

Tumor angiogenesis is crucial for the growth of solid tumors. Angiogenic factors released by the tumor activate endothelial cells to form new blood vessels that supply the tumor with oxygen and nutrients and thereby promote tumor growth. Therefore, the directed destruction of the tumor endothelium for the treatment of cancer has been an issue for the last 15 years. Tumor vessels differ morphologically from vessels of healthy tissue and are characterized by the expression of molecules specific for angiogenesis. These molecules could serve as targets for the specific delivery of drugs into tumors (1Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (7531) Google Scholar, 2Bergers G. Benjamin L.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar). However, the role of most of these molecules in angiogenesis is still unknown and needs further investigation. Tumor endothelial markers (TEMs) 3The abbreviations used are: TEM, tumor endothelial marker; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; H/HormR, hormone receptor; LRRCT, LRR C-terminal; s, soluble; pps, proteolytically processed soluble; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293; eEND, embryonic endothelioma; MMP, matrix metalloprotease; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ECM, extracellular matrix; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor. 1-8 were identified as previously unknown genes that displayed elevated expression in endothelial cells isolated from colorectal carcinoma (3St. Croix B. Rago C. Velculescu V. Traverso G. Romans K.E. Montgomery E. Lal A. Riggins G.J. Lengauer C. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 2000; 289: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar). Further studies showed that TEMs are also up-regulated in endothelial cells undergoing physiologic angiogenesis in humans and mice (4Carson-Walter E.B. Watkins D.N. Nanda A. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. St. Croix B. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6649-6655PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins nidogen and collagen VI have been described as ligands of the transmembrane proteins TEM7 and TEM8, respectively (5Lee H.K. Seo I.A. Park H.K. Park H.T. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2253-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 6Nanda A. Carson-Walter E.B. Seaman S. Barber T.D. Stampfl J. Singh S. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. St. Croix B. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). By homology TEM5 belongs to the group III of adhesion G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which contain a seven-pass transmembrane domain and a long extracellular N terminus bearing conserved domains involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions (7Bjarnadottir T.K. Fredriksson R. Hoglund P.J. Gloriam D.E. Lagerstrom M.C. Schioth H.B. Genomics. 2004; 84: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). It remains to be verified by experimental evidence if TEM5 serves as a GPCR in endothelial cells. The TEM5 extracellular domain contains several conserved subdomains: a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain with four LRRs and an LRR C-terminal (LRRCT) motif, an immunoglobulin (IG) domain, a hormone receptor (HormR) domain, and a membrane proximal GPCR proteolysis site (Fig. 1A). The LRR domain shares homology with the membrane protein LIG-1 and the secreted SLIT proteins (8Fredriksson R. Gloriam D.E. Hoglund P.J. Lagerstrom M.C. Schioth H.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It has been reported that proteolytic cleavage at the GPCR proteolysis site of the GPCRs brain angiogenesis inhibitor 1 and CD97 leads to shedding of their extracellular domains (10Gray J.X. Haino M. Roth M.J. Maguire J.E. Jensen P.N. Yarme A. Stetler-Stevenson M.A. Siebenlist U. Kelly K. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5438-5447PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kaur B. Brat D.J. Devi N.S. Van Meir E.G. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3632-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The TEM5 intracellular domain contains a conserved PDZ-binding motif at the C terminus. It has been shown that the tumor suppressor protein human disc large interacts with the TEM5-intracellular domain via this motif (12Yamamoto Y. Irie K. Asada M. Mino A. Mandai K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3889-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This study was designed to elucidate the role of TEM5 in angiogenesis. We found that TEM5 is localized on the surface of endothelial cells. Soluble TEM5 (sTEM5) is shed by capillary-like network forming or growth factor stimulated endothelial cells and binds to glycosaminoglycans. After proteolytic processing a binding site for integrin αvβ3 is exposed on sTEM5. Adhesion of endothelial cells to immobilized proteolytically processed sTEM5 (ppsTEM5) promotes their survival.

Vitronectin was from Promega (Mannheim, Germany). Endothelial cell basal medium was from PromoCell (Heidelberg, Germany). Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated from umbilical cords as described previously (17Essler M. Amano M. Kruse H.J. Kaibuchi K. Weber P.C. Aepfelbacher M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21867-21874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and maintained in endothelial cell growth medium (PromoCell). Culture flasks, plates, and coverslips were coated with 0.1 mg/ml collagen in PBS for 30 min prior to seeding HUVECs unless indicated otherwise. HUVECs from passages 0-4 were used for experiments. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 and embryonic endothelioma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. M21, M21L and TD2 cells were maintained in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of TEM5 Constructs—Full-length TEM5 was amplified by PCR from the cDNA clone FLJ00170. sTEM5 was amplified from the plasmid pIVEX2.3-MCS-sTEM5. Amplified cDNAs were cloned into the p3xFLAG-CMV-9 expression vector (Sigma). The sTEM5 protein is proteolytically processed by matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-9 resulting in an N-terminal fragment of ∼80 kDa (ppsTEM5, Fig. 4B). This fragment was cloned estimating the size of the nucleotide sequence from the apparent molecular weight of the protein. ppsTEM5, TEM5-HG, and TEM5-G were derived from the sTEM5 expression construct by deleting the concerned regions using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). HEK293 cells were stably transfected with the soluble expression constructs using calcium phosphate coprecipitation and Geneticin (0.6 mg/ml) as a selective antibiotic. Culture medium from confluent stably transfected cells was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum and 0.6 mg/ml Geneticin. Supernatants were harvested every 72 h and centrifuged to remove dead cells and debris. Cleared supernatants were concentrated 500-fold using Centricon Plus-20 centrifuge filters (Millipore). Concentrated supernatants were diluted in 50 volumes of PBHST (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 300 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated with anti-FLAG-agarose for 1 h under constant rotation. Agarose beads were washed with 30 volumes of PBHST followed by 10 volumes of PBS. Elution was performed as described below. Because of weak secretion ppsTEM5 was also purified from cell lysates. Cells were detached from the culture flasks by rinsing with PBS and washed once with PBS. Cells were lysed in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture (lysis buffer) and incubated on ice for 30-min vortexing occasionally. Lysate was cleared by centrifugation and incubated with anti-FLAG-agarose for 1 h under constant rotation. Agarose beads were washed with 30 volumes of lysis buffer, 10 volumes of PBHST, and 20 volumes of PBS. Bound proteins were eluted in fractions using 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 3.5. Eluates were neutralized, and proteins containing fractions were pooled and concentrated using Centricon Plus-20 centrifuge filters. Protein concentrations were determined using the Protein dotMetric Assay (Geno Technology, St. Louis, MO). Transfection and Microinjection—HUVECs were transfected with plasmid DNA using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For microinjections plasmid DNA (0.1 μg/μl in Tris-buffered saline containing 5 mm MgCl2) was injected into the cell nuclei using a micromanipulator. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were lysed using reducing Laemmli sample buffer. Protein samples in Laemmli sample buffer were incubated for 5 min at 95 °C and separated by SDS-PAGE using 8, 10, or 14% gels. A full-range Rainbow molecular weight marker (Amersham Biosciences) served as the molecular weight standard. For immunoblot analysis separated proteins were blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and blots were blocked with 5% nonfat skimmed milk in PBST (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20). Blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer and washed three times with PBST. If unconjugated primary antibody was used membranes were incubated for 1 h with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) directed against appropriate species diluted in blocking buffer. Membranes were washed three times with PBST and incubated with ECL substrate (Amersham Biosciences). Luminescence was detected using Kodak BioMax XAR films (Sigma). Immunofluorescence Staining—CELLocate coverslips (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) were placed in 6-well plates, and 5 × 105 HUVECs per well were seeded and incubated for 24 h. Patches of ∼50 cells were microinjected with an equimolar mixture of full-length TEM5 and a GFP expression construct (pTurboGFP-C, Evrogen, Moscow, Russia). 24 h after microinjection cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. Cells were washed three times with PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min or left nonpermeabilized. After washing with PBS cells were incubated for 1 h with a polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:200 in PBS. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 1 h with a TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Invitrogen) diluted 1:200 in PBS. Cells were washed with PBS, and coverslips were mounted on microscopic slides using Vectashield hard set mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingham, CA). Fluorescence microscopic images were taken at 400-fold magnification using a digital camera. TEM5 Shedding Assay—HUVECs were transfected with the indicated expression constructs. 24 h after transfection cells were trypsinized, and 2.5 × 105 cells per well were seeded on Matrigel-layered (1.5 ml/well) or collagen-coated 6-well plates. Cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml VEGF or bFGF or left unstimulated. Phase contrast microscopic images were taken at the indicated time points at 100-fold magnification using a digital camera. Supernatants from cells in collagen-coated wells were centrifuged to remove dead cells and debris. Medium from cells in Matrigel was aspirated, and cells were recovered from Matrigel using MatriSperse according to the manufacturer's protocol saving the solubilized Matrigel (supernatants). Cells were lysed using 40 μl of reducing Laemmli sample buffer. Cleared supernatants were incubated with 10 μl of anti-FLAG-agarose overnight at 4 °C under constant rotation. Agarose beads were washed three times with PBS. For immunoblot analysis bound proteins were eluted with 1 volume of 2× reducing Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min at 95 °C. For the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) bound proteins were eluted with 5 volumes of 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 3.5. 96-well polystyrene plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with the neutralized eluates. Cell Adhesion Assay—96-Well polystyrene plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with different proteins diluted in PBS at indicated concentrations. Wells were blocked for 1 h with 1% BSA in PBS (PBS/BSA). Cells were trypsinized and resuspended in culture medium. Cell suspensions were incubated for 2 h at room temperature under gentle agitation for cell recovery. Recovered HUVECs were resuspended in endothelial cell basal medium containing 0.1% BSA and recovered M21/M21L cells were resuspended in RPMI medium containing 0.1% BSA. HUVECs were treated with different inhibitors or left untreated for 30 min. 3 × 104 cells were seeded per well and allowed to adhere for 30 min at 37 °C. Soluble inhibitors were present where indicated. Cells were washed once with PBS and culture medium containing 0.1 volume Alamar-Blue dye was added to each well. Cells were incubated for 3-16 h at 37 °C. Supernatants were transferred to new 96-well plates, and absorbance at 570 nm and 600 nm was measured. Relative adhesion was equal to relative reduction of the dye which was calculated according to the supplier's manual. MMP-9 Cleavage of TEM5 Constructs—Purified TEM5 constructs were dialyzed overnight against MMP-9 buffer (Tris-buffered saline containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 0.005% Brij35). 0.2 mg/ml protein was incubated with 10 μg/ml recombinant human MMP-9 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) at 37 °C for 20 h. Affinity Chromatography—Vitronectin and TEM5 constructs were dialyzed overnight against PBS. 25 μg of protein were coupled to 25 μl of AminoLink Plus-agarose (Pierce) at pH 7.2 according to the manufacturer's protocol. Coupled agarose was equilibrated with buffer A (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm MnCl2) supplemented with 0.1% BSA and and 0.2% Triton X-100 (binding buffer) and incubated with 50 μg/ml integrin αvβ3 in binding buffer overnight at 4 °C under constant rotation. Beads were washed four times with 10 volumes of buffer A containing 0.2% Triton X-100. Bound integrin was eluted by incubating beads for 30 min at room temperature with 1 volume of 2× non-reducing Laemmli sample buffer. Eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were visualized by silver staining. Integrin αvβ3 Binding Assay—96-Well polystyrene plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml protein G-purified polyclonal integrin αv antibody (Chemicon). Wells were washed three times with buffer A containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h with 3.5 μg/ml integrin αvβ3 in buffer A containing 0.2% Triton X-100. Wells were washed three times and blocked with 1% BSA in buffer A for 1 h. Immobilization of integrin αvβ3 was confirmed by ELISA. Immobilized integrin was incubated overnight at 4 °C with different proteins at indicated concentrations in blocking buffer. Bound proteins were detected by ELISA. Glycosaminoglycan Binding Assay—96-Well polystyrene plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml collagen, laminin, or avidin diluted in PBS. Avidin-coated wells were incubated for 30 min with 100 μg/ml heparin-biotin. Wells were washed three times with PBST and blocked for 1 h with PBS/BSA. Wells were incubated for 1 h with different TEM5 constructs (100 nm) in PBS/BSA containing inhibitors where indicated. Bound TEM5 constructs were detected by ELISA. HUVEC Survival Assay—Plates and cells were prepared as outlined for the cell adhesion assay. After blocking heparan sulfate-coated wells were incubated for 2 h with different TEM5 constructs (200 nm) in PBS/BSA. 3 × 104 cells per well were seeded in 96-well plates and 1.5 × 105 cells per well were seeded in 24-well plates. Soluble inhibitors were present where indicated. 24 h after seeding phase contrast microscopic images were taken at 320-fold magnification using a digital camera. 48 h after seeding 0.1 volume of AlamarBlue was added to the cell supernatants in the 96-well plates and incubated for 4 h at 37°C. Supernatants were transferred to new 96-well plates, and absorbance at 570 and 600 nm was measured. Relative cell viability was equal to relative reduction of the dye, which was calculated according to the supplier's manual. Cells in the 24-well plates were lysed 48 h after seeding using 20 μl of reducing Laemmli sample buffer. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis. ELISA—Depending on the preceeding assay wells were washed with PBST or buffer A containing 0.05% Tween 20 and antibodies were diluted in PBS/BSA or 1% BSA in buffer A. Wells were washed three times and incubated for 1 h with a vitronectin antibody (1:3000) or an anti-FLAG-HRP antibody (1:10,000). Wells incubated with the vitronectin antibody were washed three times and incubated for 1 h with an HRP-conjugated antimouse IgG antibody (1:5000, Amersham Biosciences). Wells were washed three times and incubated with TMB substrate (Sigma) for up to 30 min. Reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 volumes of 0.5 m H2SO4. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm and blanked with substrate or zero values. Expression and Purification of Soluble TEM5 Constructs in HEK293 Cells—To investigate the function of TEM5 we cloned a full-length and several soluble deletion constructs of TEM5 containing N- and C-terminal epitope tags (Fig. 1A). Soluble TEM5 constructs were expressed in HEK293 cells and purified from cell supernatants or lysates. The purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining or immunoblotting to determine purity and integrity. All soluble constructs were highly pure and stably expressed bearing the N-terminal 3× FLAG tag and the C-terminal hexahistidine tag. Only ppsTEM5 showed slight degradation from the C terminus (Fig. 1B). Expression and Localization of TEM5 in Endothelial Cells—To confirm endothelial specific expression of TEM5 we performed immunoblot analysis of HUVEC and different cell lines using a TEM5 antibody. TEM5 was detected in HUVEC and embryonic endothelioma cells but not in HEK293 (embryonic kidney) and TD2 (pancreatic tumor) cells (Fig. 2A). TEM5 expression in HUVEC was not up-regulated by VEGF, bFGF, or interleukin-8 (data not shown). To further investigate TEM5 expression in endothelial cells we transfected HUVEC with a full-length TEM5 expression construct. Immunoblot analysis using antibodies directed against the N- and C-terminal epitope tags revealed that TEM5 is expressed as a single polypeptide chain migrating as a double band at ∼200 and 250 kDa in SDS-PAGE containing N and C terminus. The double band likely represents alternatively glycosylated forms of the protein (Fig. 2B). To determine the localization of TEM5 in endothelial cells we performed immunofluorescence staining of HUVEC microinjected with the full-length TEM5 expression construct. The cells were coinjected with a GFP expression construct as control. To discriminate between surface and intracellular expression permeabilized and non-permeabilized cells were stained for TEM5 using an anti-FLAG antibody. Permeabilized as well as non-permeabilized cells were positive for TEM5 indicating that TEM5 is localized on the surface of endothelial cells (Fig. 2C). Shedding of a Soluble TEM5 Fragment by HUVEC—Since proteolytic processing at the GPCR proteolysis site of some GPCRs leads to shedding of their extracellular domains (10Gray J.X. Haino M. Roth M.J. Maguire J.E. Jensen P.N. Yarme A. Stetler-Stevenson M.A. Siebenlist U. Kelly K. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5438-5447PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kaur B. Brat D.J. Devi N.S. Van Meir E.G. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3632-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) we hypothesized that this might also be the case for TEM5. To test our hypothesis we transfected HUVEC with full-length TEM5 and seeded them on Matrigel to induce differentiation into capillary-like networks (Fig. 3A) or stimulated them with VEGF or bFGF. Immunoblot analysis of the cell supernatants indeed revealed that a soluble TEM5 fragment is shed by HUVEC seeded on Matrigel or stimulated with VEGF or bFGF. The fragment could not be detected in supernatants of unstimulated cells. Immunoblot analysis of supernatants from HUVEC transfected with the TEM5 extracellular domain (sTEM5) showed that the shed TEM5 fragment corresponds in size to the complete extracellular domain. Interestingly, secreted sTEM5 is processed proteolytically resulting in an N-terminal fragment of ∼80 kDa. Based on this finding we hypothesized that further proteolytic processing of shed TEM5 may play a role in the regulation of its function. Supernatants from HUVECs anti-FLAG antibody. The higher sensitivity of this assay revealed a basal level of TEM5 shedding in unstimulated endothelial cells and a significant increase of shedding during capillary-like network formation (Matrigel) and upon stimulation with bFGF (Fig. 3C). Proteolytically Processed Soluble TEM5 Mediates HUVEC Adhesion—By sequence analysis we found that the extracellularly located HormR domain of TEM5 contains an RGD motif which serves as a binding site for integrins in several proteins (9Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher M.D. Science. 1987; 238: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (3894) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that TEM5 interacts with integrins via its RGD motif. To test our hypothesis we performed HUVEC adhesion assays with TEM5 constructs immobilized on polystyrene. Binding to polystyrene was equal for the different TEM5 constructs as determined by ELISA (data not shown). Interestingly, cell adhesion only occurred on ppsTEM5 in a protein density dependent manner (Fig. 4A). This finding supported our hypothesis that proteolytic processing of sTEM5 is important for the regulation of its function. We next treated the TEM5 constructs that did not mediate cell adhesion with MMP-9 and analyzed the digests by immunoblotting using an anti-FLAG antibody. Proteolytic processing of sTEM5 resulted in two N-terminal cleavage products corresponding in size to the full-length ppsTEM5 construct and a smaller degradation product of ppsTEM5. Cleavage of TEM5-HG resulted in a fragment corresponding in size to the TEM5 HormR domain (TEM5-H). Treatment of TEM5-G resulted in no detectable cleavage products (Fig. 4B). We performed HUVEC adhesion assays with the different digests and found that adhesion to MMP-9-treated sTEM5 and TEM5-HG was increased 11-fold as compared with the untreated proteins. The RGD motif lacking TEM5-G construct did not mediate adhesion upon MMP-9 treatment. These results indicate that sTEM5 contains a cryptic binding site for a receptor on endothelial cells. Cell Adhesion to ppsTEM5 Is Mediated by Integrin αvβ3—To investigate whether adhesion of endothelial cells to ppsTEM5 is mediated by integrins we used RGD peptide and different function blocking integrin antibodies to inhibit cell adhesion. We found that adhesion to MMP-9-treated sTEM5 is completely blocked with an integrin αvβ3 antibody (Fig. 4C). Adhesion to ppsTEM5 could be completely blocked with RGD peptide and antibodies directed against αv integrins and integrin αvβ3. Adhesion was reduced to ∼50% with an antibody directed against α5 integrins but could not be blocked with antibodies directed against integrins α1, α2, or αvβ5 (Fig. 5A). These findings suggest that ppsTEM5 specifically interacts with integrin αvβ3 and to a lesser extent with α5 integrins. We also performed adhesion assays with the αv integrin expressing melanoma cell line M21 and the M21 cell subpopulation M21L that lacks αv integrins. Consistent with our inhibition experiments M21 cells adhered well to ppsTEM5 whereas M21L cells only weakly adhered to ppsTEM5. sTEM5 did not mediate adhesion of either cell line. The weak adhesion of M21L cells to ppsTEM5 can probably be attributed to the expression of other RGD-dependent integrins such as α5 integrins. Adhesion to collagen, which is independent of αv integrins, was equal for both cell lines (Fig. 5B). ppsTEM5 Directly Interacts with Integrinαvβ3—To further confirm the interaction of ppsTEM5 with integrin αvβ3 we performed affinity chromatography. Different purified TEM5 constructs or the known αvβ3 ligand vitronectin were coupled to agarose beads and incubated with purified integrin αvβ3. After extensive washing of the beads bound integrin was eluted. Eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Significant binding of integrin αvβ3 was only observed on vitronectin and ppsTEM5 (Fig. 6A). To quantify the interaction of the TEM5 constructs and vitronectin with integrin αvβ3 we performed an ELISA-based binding assay using immobilized integrin αvβ3. ppsTEM5 bound to integrin αvβ3 in a concentration-dependent manner with an intermediate affinity as compared with vitronectin. sTEM5 only weakly bound to integrin αvβ3 and the RGD motif lacking the TEM5-G construct did not bind to integrin αvβ3 at all (Fig. 6B). sTEM5 and ppsTEM5 Directly Interact with Glycosaminoglycans—Direct interactions with ECM molecules have been reported recently for TEM7 and TEM8 (5Lee H.K. Seo I.A. Park H.K. Park H.T. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2253-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 6Nanda A. Carson-Walter E.B. Seaman S. Barber T.D. Stampfl J. Singh S. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. St. Croix B. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether soluble TEM5 constructs also bind to components of the ECM. Different ECM molecules were immobilized and incubated with soluble TEM5 constructs. Bound TEM5 constructs were detected by ELISA using an anti-FLAG antibody. Our experiments demonstrate that soluble TEM5 constructs do not interact with the ECM proteins collagen or laminin. However, sTEM5 and ppsTEM5 but not TEM5-HG interacted with the glycosaminoglycan heparin (Fig. 7A). Inhibition experiments revealed that the interaction of sTEM5 with heparin is not dependent on bivalent cations (EDTA) but depends on the ionic strength of the environment (1 m NaCl). Furthermore, by competitive inhibition of the sTEM5 heparin interaction we found that sTEM5 also interacts with several other glycosaminoglycans. The relative affinity for the glycosaminoglycans we tested is heparin > chondroitin sulfate = dermatan sulfate > heparan sulfate (Fig. 7B). ppsTEM5 Mediates HUVEC Survival by Interacting with Integrin αvβ3—Endothelial cells that are not incorporated into differentiating vessels during angiogenesis eventually become apoptotic. Since sTEM5 is shed by endothelial cells during capillary-like network formation and ppsTEM5 interacts with integrin αvβ3, we hypothesized a role in endothelial cell survival during angiogenesis. To investigate this potential effect we seeded HUVEC on plates coated with different TEM5 constructs or vitronectin and incubated them for 48 h in the absence of serum and growth factors to induce cell death. We found that vitronectin and ppsTEM5 equally mediated protection from cell death as compared with sTEM5 and BSA supporting our hypothesis that ppsTEM5 plays a role in survival of endothelial cells. The presence of a soluble function blocking integrin αvβ3 antibody but not soluble heparin inhibited ppsTEM5-mediated cell survival. Immunoblot analysis of the cells using a caspase-3 antibody revealed that ppsTEM5 mediated cell survival by inhibiting proteolytic activation of procaspase-3 (Fig. 8, A-C). We also investigated whether the interaction of ppsTEM5 with glycosaminoglycans is important for endothelial cell survival. Therefore, plates were coated with heparan sulfate and remaining protein-binding sites were blocked. Coated plates were incubated with different TEM5 constructs or left untreated prior to seeding HUVEC. We observed that heparan sulfate-bound ppsTEM5 mediated more protection from cell death than heparan sulfate-bound sTEM5 or heparan sulfate alone (Fig. 8D). In this study we investigated the role of TEM5 in angiogenesis. TEM5 belongs to the group III of adhesion GPCRs (7Bjarnadottir T.K. Fredriksson R. Hoglund P.J. Gloriam D.E. Lagerstrom M.C. Schioth H.B. Genomics. 2004; 84: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We found that TEM5 is expressed on the surface of endothelial cells. A soluble TEM5 fragment encompassing the complete extracellular domain (sTEM5) is shed by endothelial cells during capillary-like network formation and upon growth factor stimulation. The extracellularly located HormR domain of TEM5 contains an RGD motif which is a binding site for certain integrins (9Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher M.D. Science. 1987; 238: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (3894) Google Scholar). RGD-binding integrins such as αvβ3 play an important role in angiogenesis. Integrin αvβ3 is up-regulated in the endothelium during angiogenesis and mediates endothelial cell migration, invasion, proliferation, as well as survival. It interacts with a variety of ECM proteins such as fibronectin, vitronectin, and fibrinogen (13Varner J.A. Cheresh D.A. Important Adv. Oncol. 1996; : 69-87PubMed Google Scholar). Interactions with several non-ECM proteins such as CD97, prothrombin, and MMP-2 have been reported as well (14Wang T. Ward Y. Tian L. Lake R. Guedez L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Kelly K. Blood. 2005; 105: 2836-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 15Byzova T.V. Plow E.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 2081-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 16Brooks P.C. Stromblad S. Sanders L.C. von Schalscha T.L. Aimes R.T. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quigley J.P. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 683-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that integrins also interact with TEM5 via its RGD motif during angiogenesis. Indeed, proteolytically processed sTEM5 (ppsTEM5) mediated adhesion of endothelial cells by interacting with RGD-dependent integrins. Interestingly, full-length sTEM5 did not mediate cell adhesion indicating that its RGD-binding site is cryptic. Proteolytic processing of sTEM5 by proteases such as MMP-9 led to exposure of its RGD motif. Adhesion of endothelial cells to ppsTEM5 is mediated by integrin αvβ3 and to a lesser extent by α5 integrins. It is interesting to observe that a function blocking integrin αvβ5 antibody does not inhibit endothelial cell adhesion to ppsTEM5. Other αvβ3 ligands such as vitronectin also interact with integrin αvβ5 yet ppsTEM5 seems to be more specific for integrin αvβ3. Interestingly, the N-terminally truncated sTEM5 construct TEM5-HG also mediated cell adhesion upon treatment with MMP-9 demonstrating that the LRR and IG domains are not involved in the interaction with integrin αvβ3. Binding studies with immobilized ECM molecules revealed that sTEM5 and ppsTEM5 but not TEM5-HG interact with glycosaminoglycans. This finding suggests that the LRR and/or IG domains of TEM5, which are deleted in TEM5-HG, mediate this interaction. Therefore, it is possible that membrane-bound TEM5 present on the cell surface acts as a receptor for glycosaminoglycans. Glycosaminoglycans are linear heteropolysaccharides composed of repeating disaccharide blocks that are N-acetylated and sulfated. They are covalently and non-covalently linked to the core proteins of proteoglycans, which are present in the ECM and on cell surfaces. Our data suggest that ppsTEM5 links integrin αvβ3 to the glycosaminoglycan side chains of proteoglycans. Adhesion to ppsTEM5 or heparan sulfate-bound ppsTEM5 promoted survival of endothelial cells in the absence of growth factors indicating that TEM5 plays a role in cell-matrix and cell-cell contact-induced survival. ppsTEM5-mediated cell survival was significantly inhibited by an integrin αvβ3 antibody suggesting that integrin αvβ3 plays a major role in mediating this effect. An excess of heparin did not inhibit ppsTEM5-mediated endothelial cell survival indicating that ligation of cell surface glycosaminoglycans by sTEM5 or ppsTEM5 does not contribute to cell survival. Based on our results we conclude that sTEM5 is shed by endothelial cells during angiogenesis and binds to glycosaminoglycans present in the ECM and on cell surfaces. After proteolytic processing an RGD-binding site for integrin αvβ3 is exposed on sTEM5. Interaction of integrin αvβ3 with proteoglycan-bound ppsTEM5 mediates endothelial cell survival.

https://openalex.org/W2055457973,"In this study we investigated the mechanisms responsible for MAP kinase ERK1/2 activation following agonist activation of endogenous mu opioid receptors (MOR) normally expressed in cultured striatal neurons. Treatment with the MOR agonist fentanyl caused significant activation of ERK1/2 in neurons derived from wild type mice. Fentanyl effects were blocked by the opioid antagonist naloxone and were not evident in neurons derived from MOR knock-out (-/-) mice. In contrast, ERK1/2 activation by fentanyl was not evident in neurons from GRK3-/- mice or neurons pretreated with small inhibitory RNA for arrestin3. Consistent with this observation, treatment with the opiate morphine (which is less able to activate arrestin) did not elicit ERK1/2 activation in wild type neurons; however, transfection of arrestin3-(R170E) (a dominant positive form of arrestin that does not require receptor phosphorylation for activation) enabled morphine activation of ERK1/2. In addition, activation of ERK1/2 by fentanyl and morphine was rescued in GRK3-/- neurons following transfection with dominant positive arrestin3-(R170E). The activation of ERK1/2 appeared to be selective as p38 MAP kinase activation was not increased by either fentanyl or morphine treatment in neurons from wild type, MOR-/-, or GRK3-/- mice. In addition, U0126 (a selective inhibitor of MEK kinase responsible for ERK phosphorylation) blocked ERK1/2 activation by fentanyl. These results support the hypothesis that MOR activation of ERK1/2 requires opioid receptor phosphorylation by GRK3 and association of arrestin3 to initiate the cascade resulting in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in striatal neurons.

These results support the hypothesis that MOR activation of ERK1/2 requires opioid receptor phosphorylation by GRK3 and association of arrestin3 to initiate the cascade resulting in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in striatal neurons. Opioid receptor activation results in both acute and long-lasting changes in neuronal physiology. The mechanisms responsible for the acute changes include Gαi/o and Gβγ protein activation that increases potassium conductance, decreases calcium conductance, and results in presynaptic inhibition (1Kovoor A.

In this study we used primary cultured neurons isolated from mouse striata to address the mechanisms linking mu opioid receptor (MOR) activation to the phosphorylation and activation of the extracellular signal-related kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) members of the MAPK family. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by GPCRs involves growth factor receptor transactivation (4Schulz R. Eisinger D.A. Wehmeyer A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 500: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As demonstrated for the β-adrenergic receptor, participation of arrestin is an integral part of GPCR signaling through the ERK1/2 signaling pathway in transfected HEK293 cells (6Shenoy S.K.

Following agonist activation of MOR, the receptor becomes phosphorylated by G-protein receptor kinase (GRK), which initiates an arrestin-dependent desensitization process that involves clathrin-mediated endocytosis (7Keith D.E.

The opioid activation of ERK1/2 by MOR agonist (d-Ala2,Me-Phe4,Gly-ol5) (DAMGO) was demonstrated in MOR-transfected cells (8Belcheva M.M. Vogel Z. Ignatova E. Avidor-Reiss T. Zippel R. Levy R.

Ioka M. Suzuki M. Suzuki T. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 324: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of ERK1/2 activation by opioids is not clear. To assess whether GRK and arrestin were required for MOR activation of ERK1/2, we compared the activation of ERK1/2 in striatal neurons harvested from wild type, MOR knock-out mice (MOR-/-), and GRK 3 knock-out mice (GRK3-/-). Using siRNA to reduce arrestin3 expression and the dominant positive form of arrestin 3, arrestin-(R170E) (10Kovoor A. Celver J. Abdryashitov R.I. Chavkin C. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol.

The results suggest that MOR agonists in striatal neurons produced selective activation of ERK1/2, the selective activation of ERK1/2 was rescued by the dominant positive arrestin, and this activation of ERK1/2 was GRK3 and arrestin3 dependent.

The Li-Cor Blocking Buffer was purchased from Li-Cor Biosciences (Lincoln, NE). Pregnant C57Bl/6 mice were obtained from Charles River (Wilmington, MA). Transgenic mice lacking functional mu opioid receptors, MOR-/- (11Schuller A.G. King M.A. Zhang J. Bolan E. Pan Y.X. Morgan D.J. Chang A. Czick M.E. Unterwald E.M. Pasternak G.W. Pintar J.E. Nat.

Johnson School of Medicine) and Drs. Marc Caron and Robert Lefkowitz (Duke University), respectively, and bred within the University of Washington vivarium under specific pathogen-free conditions. Striatal Neuronal Cultures and MOR-GFP AtT-20 Cells— This procedure was described previously (13Macey T.A. Gurevich V.V. Neve K.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1635-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and adapted for these studies. The striatal region was dissected from 3-4-day-old C57BL/6 or transgenic mice and incubated in MEM containing 20 units/ml papain for 30 min at 37 °C. The tissue was then triturated using fire-polished Pasteur pipettes in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.45% glucose, 0.5 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-treated glass coverslips (BD Biosciences) at a density of 75,000 cells per coverslip for confocal microscopy, or in poly-d-lysine-coated 6-well plates for immunoblot analysis. Neuronal medium containing 50% MEM, 39% Ham's F-12 medium, 10% horse serum, 1% fetal bovine serum, 0.45% glucose, 0.1 mg/ml apotransferrin, 0.5 mm kynurenic acid, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin was added 1 h after initial plating. Cultures were used 12-14 days after plating. MOR-GFP-transfected AtT-20 cells were previously described (14Celver J. Xu M. Jin W. Lowe J. Chavkin C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 528-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Transfection of Striatal Neuronal Cultures—For experiments using the dominant positive arrestin3-(R170E) (10Kovoor A. Celver J. Abdryashitov R.I. Chavkin C. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6831-6834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), striatal cultures were grown in 6-well plates. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was added to MEM according to the manufacturer's instructions, and 1.5 μg of cDNA coding for the dominant positive arrestin3-(R170E)-YFP or the empty vector YFP were prepared in Opti-MEM. DNA mixtures were added dropwise to the Lipofectamine 2000 mixture and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After the incubation, the total mixture was added to cells in a 6-well tissue culture plate for 4 h. Cells were harvested on the second day following transfection for quantification of phospho-ERK1/2 and actin immunoreactivity as described. Treated cells transfected with dominant positive arrestin3-(R170E)-YFP or the empty vector YFP were compared with untreated cells transfected with the dominant positive arrestin3-(R170E)-YFP (basal). The dominant positive arrestin3-(R170E) was kindly provided by Dr. Vsevolod Gurevich (Vanderbilt, TN). BglII and KpnI restriction sites were added to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the cDNAs through polymerase chain reaction using the respective oligos: 5′-Arr3 BglI (5′-ATGCATAGATCTATGGGGGAGAAACCC) and 3′-Arr3 KpnI (5′-GGCCCGCGGTACCTAGCAGAACTGGTC). The resulting products were purified, digested, and then inserted into the multiple cloning site of the pEYFP-C1 vector (Clontech Laboratories). The 5′ oligo used to insert the BglII restriction site verified the coding sequence for arrestin3 remained in-frame with the EYFP sequence. For transfection of the arrestin3 siRNA, chemically synthesized siRNA with 19-nucleotide duplex RNA and 2-nucleotide 3′ dTdT overhangs was purchased from (Invitrogen). The siRNA sequence targeting mouse arrestin3 was 5′-GGACCGGAAAGUGUUUGUG-3′. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was added to Opti-MEM according to the manufacturer's instructions, whereas the RNA mixtures were prepared at a final concentration of 25 nm. RNA mixtures were added dropwise to the Lipofectamine 2000 mixture and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After the incubation, the total mixture was added to cells plated on coverslips for confocal microscopy, or to 6-well tissue culture plate for immunoblotting. Some wells received Lipofectamine 2000 in Opti-MEM only as a negative control (control). The mixture was removed after 4 h and fresh media was added to the cultures. Cells were harvested on the second day following transfection for quantification of p-ERK1/2, arrestin3, and actin immunoreactivity as described. Transfection efficiency was determined by transfecting 0.5 μg of the empty vector DsRed (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) with the siRNA mixture as described above. Using confocal microscopy, DsRed positive cells were counted and taken over the total number of cells per ×63 field to calculate an average transfection efficiency at 28.5 ± 0.5%. Quantitative Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—For further quantification of arrestin3 knockdown levels, RNA was harvested from striatal neuronal cultures prepared from 3-4-day-old mouse pups using Qiashredder homogenizer columns and the RNeasy Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). One step quantitative real-time PCR was performed on a Stratagene Mx3000 machine using the Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix with StrataScript Reverse Transcriptase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Arrestin2, arrestin3, and a control endogenous housekeeping gene, ribosomal protein ARBP, were amplified in separate reactions starting with 20 ng of total RNA for each sample. The oligo sequences used for amplification of mouse arrestin2 and arrestin3 were found through PrimerBank (15Wang X. Seed B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e154Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar) and were as follows: arrestin2 (PrimerBank code 30089688a3), forward (GCCCCAATGGAAAGCTCACT), reverse (CCACGAGGTCAATGTGGTCC); and arrestin3 (PrimerBank code 21703856a3), forward (GGAGTAGACTTTGAGATTCGAGC), reverse (GGTCAGACATGAGGAAGTGGC). The oligos used for the housekeeping gene ARBP were forward (TGTTTGACAACGGCAGCATTT) and reverse (CCGAGGCAACAGTTGGGTA). Standard curves were run with serial dilutions of RNA and the PCR efficiencies were found to be similar for all oligo sets. Dissociation curves for the products of each oligo set had a single peak indicating specific amplification. For each sample, the Ct, or cycle at which the fluorescence measured reached the threshold to be above the ambient background signal, was determined for arrestin2, arrestin3, and ARBP. The ΔCt was calculated by subtracting the Ct for the endogenous control gene ARBP from the Ct of the gene of interest. Relative quantification was done using the ΔΔCt method (16Dheda K. Huggett J.F. Bustin S.A. Johnson M.A. Rook G. Zumla A. BioTechniques. 2004; 37: 112-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Relative quantity was then expressed as a -fold change by calculating 2-ΔΔCt. For absolute quantification of arrestin levels in the neuronal cultures, standard curves were generated from in vitro transcribed arrestin2 and arrestin3 RNA and the amount of arrestin RNA per 20 ng of total RNA harvested from the neuronal cultures was determined. Confocal Microscopy—Striatal neurons grown on glass coverslips were treated for 30 min at 37 °C with fentanyl (100 nm) or morphine (10 μm). For antagonist studies, naloxone (10 μm) was added 30 min before agonist. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (58 mm Na2HPO4, 17 mm NaH2PO4, 68 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) for 30 min. Coverslips were permeabilized and blocked with 5% goat serum, 3% bovine serum albumin, and 0.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. All cells were incubated with rabbit anti-phospho-ERK1/2, guinea pig anti-mu opioid receptor, and mouse anti-arrestin3, washed, and incubated for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit IgG 488 Alexa Fluor conjugate, goat anti-guinea pig IgG 633 Alexa Fluor conjugate, and goat anti-mouse IgG 555 at 1/500. Coverslips were washed, mounted onto a slide with Slowfade (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and imaged with a Leica SL laser scanning confocal microscope. Phospho-ERK1/2 expression was quantified for siRNA experiments using Metamorph software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Immunoblotting—Striatal neurons or MOR-GFP AtT-20 cells were grown in 6-well plates were treated for 30 min at 37 °C with fentanyl (100 nm), morphine (10 μm), or U50,488 (10 μm). For antagonist and inhibitor studies naloxone (10 μm) and U0126 (1 μm) were added 30 min before agonist. 1 μm Norbinaltorphimine was added 60 min before agonist. Anisomycin (50 μm) was added for 30 min. Cells were serum-starved 24 h prior to drug treatment. After treatment, cells were resuspended in solubilization buffer (25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl with 1% CHAPS, pH 7.4), containing phosphatase inhibitor mixture Set 1 and protease inhibitor mixture Set 1 at a 1:100 dilution (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). Cultures or cells were scraped from plates and triturated, sonicated for 10 s, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. After determining protein concentrations for the whole cell lysate using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce), 30 μg of protein/sample was used for quantification of phospho-ERK1/2, p-p38, and arrestin3. Proteins were suspended with an equal volume of Laemmli buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, loaded, and separated on 10% bisacrylamide pre-cast gels (Invitrogen). The Benchmark pre-stained standard (Invitrogen) was loaded to confirm the appropriate molecular weight of each described protein. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose (Whatman) and blocked in Tris-buffered saline, 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies directed against phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-p38 MAPK, arrestin3, or β-actin. Membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline, and then incubated with IRDye™ 800 conjugated affinity purified anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG at a dilution of 1:10,000 in a 1:1 mixture of 5% milk/Tris-buffered saline and Li-Cor Blocking Buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then washed in 1× Tris-buffered saline before scanning on the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciencs). Membranes were re-probed with β-actin to confirm equal protein loading. Band pixel intensity was measured using the Odyssey software. Band intensities from treated groups were normalized to a percentage of control samples, and plotted using GraphPad (GraphPad Prism 4.0) software. Statistical significance was determined by an analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's post hoc test, p < 0.05 or p < 0.01. MOR Activation of ERK1/2 Phosphorylation Is Agonist Selective and GRK3 Dependent—The expression of phospho-ERK1/2 was assessed in agonist-treated neurons and compared with untreated striatal cells. Treatment with 100 nm fentanyl for 30 min significantly increased the activation of phosopho-ERK1/2 in the whole cell lysates prepared from wild type striatal neurons by 81 ± 13% above basal levels (p < 0.01, n = 7) (Fig. 1, A and B, left column, and Fig. 2). The increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation was blocked by the MOR antagonist naloxone and was not evident in primary striatal neurons cultured from MOR-/- mice. Furthermore, the MEK inhibitor U0126 prevented the fentanyl-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (p < 0.01, n = 4). Treatment with fentanyl (100 nm) for 2, 5, or 15 min did not significantly affect ERK1/2 phosphorylation (90 ± 6.5, 88 ± 14, and 88 ± 20%, respectively) compared with basal phospho-ERK1/2 levels in the whole cell lysate prepared from the wild type striatal neurons (Fig. 1D, n = 2-4). Lower doses of fentanyl were also used to treat neurons, and using immunoblot analysis the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was not significantly increased from basal levels (data not shown, n = 3).FIGURE 2Activation of phospho-ERK1/2 by MOR is agonist selective and results in arrestin3 colocalization in striatal neurons. Agonist-induced activation of phospho-ERK1/2 by the endogenous MOR in wild type striatal neurons was assessed. Neuronal cultures prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” were used to quantify the expression levels of phospho-ERK1/2. Representative confocal images are shown of pERK, MOR, and arrestin3 immunoreactivity in wild type striatal neurons that were vehicle treated (Basal), or treated for 30 min with fentanyl (100 nm), fentanyl with naloxone (10 μm) pretreatment, or morphine (10 μm). The merged images represent the colocalization of p-ERK and arrestin3 for each treatment described above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In contrast to wild type neurons, fentanyl (100 nm) treatment of striatal neurons from GRK3-/- mice for 5, 15, or 30 min did not cause a significant activation of ERK1/2 (data for the 30-min time point are shown, Fig. 1, left column). The results suggest that GRK3 was required for the fentanyl-induced activation of ERK1/2. Treatment with 10 μm morphine for 30 min did not significantly increase the activation of phospho-ERK1/2 in whole cell lysates prepared from wild type, MOR-/-, or GRK3-/- striatal neurons compared with basal levels of phospho-ERK1/2 (Fig. 1, right column, and Fig. 2, n = 7). Furthermore, treatment with 10 μm morphine for 2, 5, or 15 min did not significantly increase phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (82.5 ± 15, 93 ± 13, and 86 ± 7, respectively) compared with basal levels (Fig. 1D, n = 2-6). This agonist specific difference in ERK1/2 activation in striatial neuronal cultures was also found in AtT-20 cells expressing a GFP-tagged MOR. Treatment with 10 μm morphine for 30 min did not significantly increase phospho-ERK levels (84.5 ± 8.2%) compared with basal levels (n = 6, data not shown), whereas treatment with 100 nm fentanyl produced a significant increase in the levels of phospho-ERK, 25.8 ± 7% above basal levels (p < 0.05, n = 6) (data not shown). The lack of response of GRK3-/- cells to fentanyl was not due to an inability of these neurons to show receptor-activated ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The MEK inhibitor U0126 significantly reduced the basal activation of phospho-ERK1/2 in wild type, MOR-/-, and GRK3-/- striatal neurons (p < 0.01, n = 7), indicating the cultured neurons from the transgenic mice were capable of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. As a positive control, treatment with the kappa opioid receptor agonist U50,488 (10 μm) significantly increased phospho-ERK1/2 levels in both wild type and GRK3-/- striatal neurons by 27.6 ± 6.3 and 68.5 ± 38.5%, respectively (p < 0.05, n = 3-7) (Fig. 1C). In addition, treatment of both wild type and GRK3-/- neurons with the MAPK activator anisomycin (50 μm) significantly increased phospho-ERK1/2 levels 51.7 ± 17.5 and 116 ± 27.8%, respectively (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively, n = 3-7) (Fig. 1C). These data show that the GRK3-/- neurons were capable of ERK1/2 activation and further support the conclusion that GRK3 was specifically required for the mu opioid-induced activation of ERK1/2. MOR Activation Specifically Induced Phosphorylation of ERK1/2, not p38 MAPK—Treatment with 100 nm fentanyl for 5, 15, or 30 min did not significantly increase phospho-p38 in whole cell lysates prepared from cultured striatal neurons derived from wild type, MOR-/-, or GRK3-/- mice (Fig. 3, n = 7). Furthermore, treatment with 10 μm morphine for 5, 15, or 30 min did not increase phosphorylated p38 in neurons cultured from wild type, MOR-/-, or GRK3-/- mice (Fig. 3). The expression of phosphorylated p38 was determined following treatment with fentanyl (100 nm) or morphine (10 μm) for 30 min and compared with untreated cells. Pretreatment of striatal neurons with naloxone did not significantly affect the phosphorylation of p38. Pretreatment with U0126, a selective inhibitor of ERK1/2 activation, did not significantly decrease the basal activation of phospho-p38 in wild type, MOR-/-, or GRK3-/- striatal neurons. MOR Activation of ERK1/2 Phosphorylation Was Arrestin3 Dependent—The requirement for GRK3 suggests that arrestin may also be involved in the mu receptor-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Treatment of wild type striatal cultures with the siRNA directed against arrestin3 decreased the abundance of arrestin3 by 34% as detected by immunoblotting, without affecting actin-IR (Fig. 4A, inset). The expression of arrestin3 was 66 ± 7% of untreated neurons (p < 0.01, n = 4) (Fig. 4A). Neurons treated with the transfection reagent alone showed a fentanyl-induced increase in phospho-ERK1/2 (Fig. 4B). Whereas, the siRNA-induced depletion of arrestin3 significantly attenuated the fentanyl-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in striatal neurons to 66 ± 9% of the basal level of phospho-ERK1/2 (p < 0.01, n = 4) (Fig. 4B). Confocal imaging of transfected cells confirmed the results obtained by Western blot analysis. Following fentanyl treatment, the phosphorylated ERK1/2-IR intensity was 24 ± 3 average pixels per cell in striatal neurons co-transfected with siRNA for arrestin3 and DsRed compared with untransfected neurons in the same field (57 ± 7 average pixels per cell). Neurons transfected with DsRed but not arrestin3 siRNA responded to fentanyl treatment (100 nm, 30 min) with an increase in phosphorylated ERK1/2-IR intensity to the same extent (56 ± 3 average pixels per cell) as untransfected neurons (58 ± 4 average pixels per cell) (Fig. 4, C and D). Thus, arrestin3 siRNA expression reduced the fentanyl response by 59% as assessed with confocal microscopy. Primers were designed to detect arrestin3 message levels, and quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that arrestin3 abundance was decreased by 25% (p < 0.01) compared with untreated neurons (Fig. 4E). The arrestin3 level for neurons treated with the transfection reagent alone was 1.09 ± 0.06-fold of basal, and the arrestin3 level for neurons treated with arrestin3 siRNA was 0.751 ± 0.02-fold of basal. Treatment with arrestin3 siRNA was selective as arrestin2 message levels were not affected. The arrestin2 level for neurons treated with arrestin3 siRNA was 1.04 ± 0.07-fold of basal. A specific requirement for arrestin3 in the fentanyl-induced response was supported by assessing the absolute levels of mRNA expressed in cultured striatal neurons. Using primers designed to arrestin2 and arrestin3, quantitative RT-PCR showed that arrestin2 was expressed at 27.2 ± 4.1 fg in striatal neurons and arrestin3 was expressed at 147 ± 17.2 fg/20 ng of total RNA (Fig. 4F). Endogenous arrestin3 levels were significantly higher than endogenous arrestin2 levels in these cultured striatal neurons. Dominant Positive Arrestin3-(R170E) Rescues Morphine-mediated Activation of Phospho-ERK1/2—Arrestin3-(R170E) is a dominant positive arrestin that eliminates the requirement of receptor phosphorylation in GPCR desensitization (10Kovoor A. Celver J. Abdryashitov R.I. Chavkin C. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6831-6834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Transfection of wild type striatal cultures with the dominant positive arrestin3-(R170E)-YFP significantly increased the morphine-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 compared with basal levels by 70 ± 18% (p < 0.01, Fig. 5B). YFP-transfected neurons treated with 10 μm morphine did not significantly increase phospho-ERK1/2 compared with basal levels. Treatment with 100 nm fentanyl of R170E-YFP-transfected striatal neurons increased phospho-ERK1/2 to 99 ± 28% compared with basal levels (p < 0.05, Fig. 5A). YFP-transfected striatal neurons treated with fentanyl significantly increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by 95 ± 26% compared with basal levels (p < 0.05, Fig. 5A). The increase in fentanyl-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was slightly higher than experiments in Fig. 1. However, this difference was not significant. The rescue by arrestin-(R170E) suggests that the inability of morphine to induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation was caused by its low efficiency in recruiting GRK3 and arrestin3. Dominant Positive Arrestin3-(R170E) Rescues Activation of Phospho-ERK1/2 Independent of GRK3—Transfection of GRK3-/- striatal cultures with the dominant positive arrestin3-(R170E)-YFP significantly increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 following fentanyl or morphine treatment compared with basal levels by 50 ± 20 and 50 ± 13%, respectively (p < 0.05, Fig. 5C). YFP-transfected neurons treated with 100 nm fentanyl or 10 μm morphine did not significantly increase phospho-ERK1/2 activation compared with basal levels (Fig. 5C). Although there was a significant increase of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in GRK3-/- striatal cultures compared with basal levels in wild type neurons, this increase was less than the fentanyl-induced activation of ERK1/2 in wild type cultures and fentanyl- or morphine"
https://openalex.org/W2010778075,"The μ- and m-calpains are major members of the calpain family that play an essential role in regulating cell motility. We have recently discovered that nicotine-activated protein kinase C ι enhances calpain phosphorylation in association with enhanced calpain activity and accelerated migration and invasion of human lung cancer cells. Here we found that specific disruption of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity by expression of SV40 small tumor antigen up-regulates phosphorylation of μ- and m-calpains whereas C2-ceramide, a potent PP2A activator, reduces nicotine-induced calpain phosphorylation, suggesting that PP2A may function as a physiological calpain phosphatase. PP2A co-localizes and interacts with μ- and m-calpains. Purified, active PP2A directly dephosphorylates μ- and m-calpains in vitro. Overexpression of the PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2A/C) suppresses nicotine-stimulated phosphorylation of μ- and m-calpains, which is associated with inhibition of calpain activity, wound healing, cell migration, and invasion. By contrast, depletion of PP2A/C by RNA interference enhances calpain phosphorylation, calpain activity, cell migration, and invasion. Importantly, C2-ceramide-induced suppression of calpain phosphorylation results in decreased secretion of μ- and m-calpains from lung cancer cells into culture medium, which may have potential clinic relevance in controlling metastasis of lung cancer. These findings reveal a novel role for PP2A as a physiological calpain phosphatase that not only directly dephosphorylates but also inactivates μ- and m-calpains, leading to suppression of migration and invasion of human lung cancer cells.

These findings reveal a novel role for PP2A as a physiological calpain phosphatase that not only directly dephosphorylates but also inactivates μ- and m-calpains, leading to suppression of migration and invasion of human lung cancer cells. The process of tumor cell invasion and metastasis is conventionally understood as the migration of individual cells that detach from the primary tumor, enter lymphatic vessels or the bloodstream, and seed in distant organs (1Friedl P. Wolf K. Nature Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 362-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar). Cancer cells disseminate from the primary tumor either as individual cells, using amoeboid- or mesenchymal-type movement, or as cell sheets, stands, and clusters using collective migration. Cancer cell migration is typically regulated by integrins, matrix-degrading enzymes (i.e. metalloproteases, calpains, etc.), cell-cell adhesion molecules, and cell-cell communication (1Friedl P. Wolf K. Nature Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 362-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar). Tumor invasion is a complex process that involves cellular migration and interaction with the microenvironment at an ectopic site (2Mamoune A. Luo J. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4632-4640PubMed Google Scholar). The extracellular matrix forms a dense molecular mesh-work so that cells may fail to penetrate without proteolytic degradation of the matrix molecules (3Heino, J., Kahari, V. M., (2002) Cell Invasion, Med. Intell. Unit 33, pp. 1-117 Landes Bioscience, Eurekah.comGoogle Scholar). Thus, the proteolytic ability in cells is critical in the processes of cell migration and invasion. Proteolytic enzymes, such as metalloproteases or cysteine proteases (i.e. calpains), dissolve tiny holes in the sheath-like covering (basement membrane) surrounding the blood vessels to allow cancer cells to invade (4Albini A. Iwamoto Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Aaronson G.R. Kozlowski J.M. McEwan R.N. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3239-3245PubMed Google Scholar, 5Repesh L.A. Invasion Metastasis. 1989; 9: 192-208PubMed Google Scholar). Once the tumor cells enter the stroma, they can easily gain access to lymphatic and blood vessels for further dissemination (6Gomez D.E. Skilton G. Alonso D.F. Kazanietz M. Oncol. Rep. 1999; 6: 1363-1370PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanisms that regulate migration and invasion of tumor cells is important for development of novel therapies to control metastasis. Mounting evidence indicates that the calpain family of proteases plays an essential role in regulating cell migration and invasion, which potentially contribute to the metastasis of a variety of cancers, including lung cancer (7Xu L. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53683-53690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 8Xu L. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4457-4466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 9Franco S. Huttenlocher A. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3829-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The mammalian calpain superfamily consists of 16 known genes. Fourteen of these genes encode proteins that contain cysteine protease domains; the other two genes encode smaller regulatory proteins that associate with some of the catalytic subunits to form heterodimeric proteases (9Franco S. Huttenlocher A. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3829-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). However, μ- and m-calpains are the major species in the calpain family that are ubiquitously and constitutively expressed in mammalian cells. A distinguishing feature of calpain activity is its ability to confer limited cleavage of protein substrates into stable fragments rather than complete proteolytic digestion (10Carragher N.O. Frame M.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 1539-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, calpain-mediated proteolysis represents a major pathway of post-translational modification that influences various aspects of cell physiology, including apoptosis, proliferation, migration, and invasion (10Carragher N.O.

J. 1997; 328: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Calpain cleavage of focal adhesion components, including focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, talin, and possibly others, promotes the disassembly of these complexes, which leads to reduced cell adhesion and increased cell motility (12Carragher N.O.

Recent reports indicate that, in addition to Ca2+ binding, phosphorylation of calpain can also enhance its activity to accelerate cell migration and invasion (7Xu L. Deng X. J. Biol.

However, whether a physiological phosphatase is involved in calpain dephosphorylation remains unclear. PP2A is a major protein serine/threonine phosphatase that participates in many cellular signaling pathways in mammalian cells (15Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). It is a heterotrimer consisting of a 36-kDa catalytic subunit (PP2A/C), a 65-kDa structural A subunit (PP2A/A), and a variable regulatory subunit (PP2A/B, which can vary in size from 50 to 130 kDa). The AC catalytic complex alone has phosphatase activity, while the distinct B-subunits can recruit PP2A/C to distinct subcellular locations and then define a specific substrate target (16Cegielska A. Shaffer S. Derua R. Goris J. Virshup D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4616-4623Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 17Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Bloom G. Mumby M. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22081-22089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Recent reports indicate that PP2A can potently restrict migration of various types of cells, including lung carcinoma cells (19Young M. Kolesiak K. Meisinger J. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 100: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Young M. Liu S. Meisinger J. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 103: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 21Pullar C. Chen J.

However, the downstream targets for PP2A in negative regulation of cell motility have not totally been identified. Here we provided strong evidence that PP2A functions as a physiological calpain phosphatase to directly dephosphorylate both μ- and m-calpains, which leads to decreased calpain activity and suppression of migration and invasion of human lung cancer cells. Materials—Anti-μ-calpain, m-calpain, PP2A/C, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-goat, and rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Nicotine was purchased from Sigma. C2-ceramide and purified PP2A were obtained from Calbiochem. Synthetic calpain substrate t-butoxycarbonyl-Leu-Met-chloromethylaminocoumarin (t-Boc-LM-CMAC) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The QCM™ chemotaxis 24-well colorimetric cell migration and cell invasion assay kits were purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Anti-small t antigen antibody was purchased from Research Diagnostics Inc. (Concord, MA). The HA-tagged PP2A/C/pCDNA3 construct was generously provided by Dr. Brain Law (University of Florida). Wild-type small t antigen cDNA in pCMV5 was kindly provided by Dr. Marc Mumby (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). All reagents used were obtained from commercial sources unless otherwise stated. Cell Lines and Cell Culture—H69, H82, H157, H460, H1299, and A549 human lung cancer cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). A549 cells were maintained in F-12K medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 4 mm l-glutamine. H69, H82, H157, H460, and H1299 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum. Metabolic Labeling, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were cultured with 0.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) medium overnight. Cells were then washed three times with phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium and metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid for 90 min. After treatment with nicotine or C2-ceramide, cells were washed with ice-cold 1× PBS and lysed in detergent buffer. μ- or m-Calpain was immunoprecipitated using a μ- or m-calpain antibody, respectively. The samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at -80 °C. Phosphorylation of μ- or m-calpain was determined by autoradiography. The same filter was then probed by Western blot analysis using a μ- or m-calpain antibody, respectively, and developed using an ECL kit from Amersham Biosciences as described previously (7Xu L. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53683-53690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 8Xu L. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4457-4466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of μ- or m-Calpain in Vitro—H460 cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid and treated with nicotine for 60 min. 32P-labeled μ- or m-calpain was immunoprecipitated using an agarose-conjugated μ-or m-calpain antibody, respectively. The beads were washed three times in detergent buffer and resuspended in 60 μl of phosphatase assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Purified PP2A (10 ng) was added, and the samples were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2× SDS sample buffer. The sample was boiled for 5 min before loading onto SDS-PAGE. Calpain phosphorylation was determined by autoradiography. Detection of Calpain Activity in Living Cells—Cells were plated at 50-80% confluence in a glass chamber and incubated with 0.5% FBS medium for 24 h. The cells were then treated with nicotine or C2-ceramide in the presence of t-Boc-LM-CMAC (30 μm) for 30-60 min. Samples were then observed under a fluorescent microscope (excitation 329 nm, emission 409 nm) as described (7Xu L. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53683-53690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 8Xu L. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4457-4466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Calpain Zymography with FITC-Casein—Calpain zymography using FITC-casein was performed as described (22Arthur J. Mykles D. Elce J. Methods in Molecular Biology. 144. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 109-116Google Scholar, 23Raser K. Posner A. Wang K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with 1× PBS and lysed in the zymography lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. FITC-casein (0.05%, w/v) was mixed with 10% acrylamide solution (74:1 of acrylamide and bisacrylamide). The gel was incubated for at least 1 h at 4 °C for complete polymerization. 15 μg of cell lysate containing endogenous μ- and m-calpains in 20 μl of sample buffer (20% glycerol, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue) was loaded into each gel well and subjected to electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, 125 mm glycine, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. After electrophoresis, the gel was incubated in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 5 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol overnight at room temperature. Because μ- or m-calpain-mediated cleavage of FITC-casein can result in the disappearance of fluorescence, this could produce dark zones in a bright background. The region of m-calpain band in the gel can easily be distinguished from μ-calpain because of its higher mobility (23Raser K. Posner A. Wang K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Photographs were taken under (ultraviolet) UV light. Cell Migration and Invasion Assay—Cells were treated with nicotine or C2-ceramide as indicated. Cell migration was assessed using a QCM™ 24-well colorimetric cell migration assay kit (Chemicon) following the manufacturer's instructions. This new technique does not require cell labeling, scraping, washing, or counting. Cells that migrated through the poly-carbonate membrane were incubated with “Cell Stain Solution” and then subsequently extracted and detected on a standard microplate at 560 nm. Cell invasion was assessed using the Chemicon cell invasion assay kit. This assay was performed in an invasion chamber, which is a 24-well tissue plate with 12 cell culture inserts. The inserts contain an 8-μm pore size polycarbonate membrane over which a thin layer of ECMatrix™ is dried. The extracellular matrix layer occludes the membrane pores, blocking non-invasive cells from migrating through. Invasion cells migrate through the extracellular matrix layer and cling to the bottom of the polycarbonate membrane. The insert membrane with invaded cells on the bottom was placed in the wells with cell stain/dissociation solution after incubation and reincubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Absorbance was measured with a microplate reader at 560 nm. Each experiment was repeated three times, and data represent the mean ± S.D. of three determinations. Monolayer Wound Healing Assay—Cells were seeded into a six-well tissue culture dish and allowed to grow to 90% confluency in complete medium. Cell monolayers were wounded by a plastic tip (1 mm) that touched the plate as described (8Xu L. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4457-4466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Wounded monolayers were then washed four times with medium to remove cell debris and incubated in 0.5% FBS medium in the absence or presence of nicotine (0.2 μm) or inhibitor for various times up to 24 h. Cells were monitored under a microscope equipped with a camera (Deiss). Immunofluorescence—Cells were seeded and cultured on a Lab-Tek® chamber slide (Nalge Nunc International) overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were washed with 1× PBS, fixed with cold methanol and acetone, and blocked with 10% goat and rabbit serum. Cells were incubated with goat against human μ- or m-calpain and rabbit against human PP2A/C primary antibodies for 90 min. After washing, samples were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-goat and rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies for 60 min. Cells were washed with 1× PBS and observed under a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss). Pictures were taken and colored with the same exposure setting for each experiment. To determine subcellular regions of protein co-localization, individual red- and green-stained images derived from the same field were merged using Openlab 3.1.5 software from Improvision, Inc. (Lexington, MA). Areas of protein co-localization appear yellow. Knock Down of PP2A Catalytic Subunit by RNA Interference (RNAi)—Human PP2A/C siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was transfected into H460 cells by using Lipofectamine™ 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. A control siRNA (non-homologous to any known gene sequence) was employed as a negative control. The levels of PP2A/C expression were determined by Western blot using a PP2A/C antibody. Three independent experiments were conducted for specific silencing of the targeted PP2A/C gene. Collection of Vesicles from Culture Medium—Vesicles in culture medium were collected as described previously (7Xu L. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53683-53690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, H460 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 0.1% FBS and treated with nicotine in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of C2-ceramide for 24 h. After treatment, samples were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min to pellet the cells. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 10 min to pellet the cell debris. To pellet the medium vesicles, the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min in an ultracentrifuge (Optima XL-80K Ultracentrifuge with a SW 28 rotor; Beckman Coulter). The pellets were washed with ice-cold PBS and then resuspended in 100 μl of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Samples were mixed with 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and then subjected to 10% gradient SDS-PAGE. Levels of μ- or m-calpain in the vesicles from cell culture medium were analyzed by Western blotting. Disruption of PP2A Activity by Expression of Small T Antigen Results in Phosphorylation of μ- and m-Calpains in Association with Up-regulation of Calpain Activity, Acceleration of Wound Healing, Migration, and Invasion of Human Lung Cancer Cells—Our previous findings and those of others have demonstrated that phosphorylation of μ- and m-calpains through activation of MAPKs ERK1/2 and/or protein kinase C ι positively regulates calpain activity and cell motility (7Xu L. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53683-53690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 8Xu L. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4457-4466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 14Glading A. Uberall F. Keyse S.M. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23341-23348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Because both μ- and m-calpains are extensively co-expressed with serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in both small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells (i.e. H69 and H82) and non-small cell lung cancer cells (i.e. H157, H460, A549, and H1299) (Fig. 1A), PP2A may act as a physiological phosphatase to regulate calpain function. It is well known that the SV40 small tumor antigen (small t) can interact with the 36-kDa catalytic C and the 63-kDa A subunits of PP2A, which can specifically disrupt PP2A activity (24Sontag E. Fedorov S. Kamibayashi C. Robbins D. Cobb M. Mumby M. Cell. 1993; 75: 887-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). To test whether inhibition of PP2A activity affects calpain phosphorylation, the pCMV5/small t antigen construct was transfected into H460 cells. After transfection, cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid. Intriguingly, expression of small t antigen significantly enhances phosphorylation of both μ- and m-calpains (Fig.1, B and C). To test whether expression of small t antigen affects the proteolytic activity of calpains, t-Boc-LM-CMAC, a synthetic calpain substrate), was used for measurement of calpain activity in living cells as described previously (7Xu L. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53683-53690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Cleavage of t-Boc-LM-CMAC by active calpains can induce retention of the chloromethylaminocoumarin portion of the molecule in the cells and can result in increased fluorescence (7Xu L. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53683-53690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The pCMV5/small t antigen construct was transfected into H460 cells. After 48 h, cells were incubated with t-Boc-LM-CMAC for 60 min. Results indicate that expression of small t antigen enhances calpain activity (Fig. 1D). To further test the effect of small t antigen on activity for individual μ- or-m-calpain, calpain zymography using FITC-casein was employed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This technique can analyze calpain activity after electrophoresis in gels. Samples are run under nondenaturing conditions on acrylamide gels in which FITC-casein has been copolymerized. After electrophoresis, the gels are incubated overnight in a buffer containing a reducing agent. During this time, FITC-casein in the region of the active μ- or m-calpain band is digested to fragments sufficiently small to diffuse out of the gel, and μ- or m-calpain itself is also extensively degraded. The gels are viewed and photographed with UV illumination. The μ- or m-calpain activity produces dark (nonfluorescent) zones in a bright background. Results reveal that expression of small t antigen enhances activities of both μ- and m-calpains (Fig. 1E), suggesting that phosphorylation may activate both μ- and m-calpains. To test the effect of small t antigen on cell motility, a wound healing assay was employed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Compared with vector control cells, wound repair is significantly accelerated in cells expressing small t antigen (Fig. 1F). Consistently, expression of small t antigen significantly enhances both migration and invasion of human lung cancer cells (Fig. 1G). These findings strongly suggest that PP2A may function as a physiological calpain phosphatase to induce calpain dephosphorylation in lung cancer cell motility signaling. Other lung cancer cell lines (i.e. H69, H82, H1299, and A549) were also tested, and similar results were obtained (data not shown). These results support the notion that calpain phosphorylation may be a dynamic process that is regulated by calpain kinases (i.e. ERK1/2 and protein kinase C ι) (7Xu L. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53683-53690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 8Xu L. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4457-4466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 14Glading A. Uberall F. Keyse S.M. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23341-23348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and phosphatases (i.e. PP2A). Thus, protein kinase-mediated constitutive phosphorylation of μ- and m-calpains may occur in untreated cells because specific inhibition of PP2A activity by small t antigen up-regulates calpain phosphorylation (Fig. 1). Ceramide Inhibits Nicotine-induced Calpain Phosphorylation in Association with Suppression of Calpain Activity, Wound Healing, Migration, and Invasion of Human Lung Cancer Cells—Because ceramide is a potent pharmacological activator of PP2A (25Law B. Rossie S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12808-12813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 26Xin M. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18859-18867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), it is possible that ceramide may induce calpain dephosphorylation through activation of PP2A. To test this, H460 cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid and treated with nicotine in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of C2-ceramide. Results clearly indicate that C2-ceramide suppresses nicotine-induced phosphorylation of μ- and m-calpains in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Importantly, treatment of cells with C2-ceramide blocks nicotine-stimulated calpain activity, wound healing, and cell migration and invasion (Fig. 2, B-E). These findings suggest that ceramide-activated PP2A may reduce the calpain phosphorylation level via dephosphorylation. PP2A Co-localizes and Interacts with μ- and m-Calpains—To assess a potential direct role for PP2A as a physiological calpain phosphatase, subcellular distribution of PP2A/C and calpain was examined by immunofluorescent staining. A goat antibody against human μ- or m-calpain, rabbit polyclonal PP2A/C antibody, and FITC-conjugated anti-goat (green) or Rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit (red) secondary antibodies were used so that cells could be simultaneously stained without cross-reaction. As shown in Fig. 3A, μ- or m-calpain is primarily co-localized with PP2A/C in the cytoplasm of H460 cells. To test whether ceramide-activated PP2A enhances an association between PP2A and calpain, H460 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of C2-ceramide for 60 min. A co-immunoprecipitation experiment was carried out using an agarose-conjugated μ- or m-calpain antibody, respectively. The μ- or m-calpain-associated PP2A/C (i.e. bound PP2A/C) was analyzed by Western blotting using a PP2A/C antibody. Results reveal that treatment of cells with C2-ceramide promotes PP2A/C to associate with μ- or m-calpain in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Thus, PP2A/C may potentially function as a physiological phosphatase for both μ- and m-calpains to regulate their activities in human lung cancer cells. PP2A Dephosphorylates and Inactivates μ- and m-Calpains in Association with Inhibition of Wound Healing, Migration, and Invasion of Human Lung Cancer Cells—PP2A is the most abundant known serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase expressed in mammalian cells (15Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). To test whether PP2A can directly dephosphorylate calpain, H460 cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid and treated with nicotine for 60 min. Phosphorylated μ- or m-calpain was immunoprecipitated using an agarose-conjugated μ- or m-calpain antibody, respectively. The 32P-labeled μ- or m-calpain was used as substrate and incubated with purified, active PP2A at 30 °C for 10 min. Results show that PP2A efficiently removes the 32P-labeled phosphate from μ- or m-calpain, suggesting that PP2A can directly dephosphorylate μ- or m-calpain in vitro (Fig. 4A). To further test whether PP2A can dephosphorylate calpains in vivo, a HA-tagged PP2A/C/pCDNA3 construct was transfected into H460 cells. The exogenous levels of PP2A/C were analyzed by Western blot using an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 4B). H460 cells overexpressing HA-tagged PP2A/C or vector-only control cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid and treated with nicotine for 60 min. Results indicate that overexpression of HA-PP2A/C potently blocks nicotine-induced phosphorylation of both μ- and m-calpains (Fig. 4C). Functionally, overexpression of HA-tagged PP2A/C not only suppresses nicotine-stimulated calpain activity but also significantly retards wound healing, migration, and invasion of human lung cancer cells (Fig. 4, D-G). Depletion of PP2A/C by RNAi Enhances Calpain Phosphorylation and Activity, Which Results in Accelerated Wound Healing, Migration, and Invasion of Human Lung Cancer Cells—Our data strongly suggest that PP2A functions as a physiological calpain phosphatase to dephosphorylate calpain, which may lead to decreased calpain activity. To test whether PP2A is essential for calpain dephosphorylation, H460 cells were transfected with PP2A/C siRNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results show that the PP2A/C siRNA efficiently and specifically reduces PP2A/C expression in H460 cells whereas control siRNA has no effect (Fig. 5A). Importantly, specific disruption of PP2A/C expression by RNAi not only results in phosphorylation of both μ- and m-calpains but also further enhances nicotine-stimulated calpain phosphorylation in association with increased calpain activity, accelerated wound healing, cell migration, and invasion (Fig. 5). These findings suggest that PP2A may be essential for dephosphorylation of calpains to negatively regulate motility of human lung cancer cells. Treatment of Cells with C2-Ceramide Suppresses Nicotine-stimulated Secretion of μ- and m-Calpains from Human Lung Cancer Cells—Calpain has been reported to be a positive regulator of cell migration and invasion because it localizes to focal adhesions and cleaves many focal adhesion-related proteins, including integrin receptors, focal adhesion kinase, and talin (27Palecek S.P. Huttenlocher A. Horwitz A.F. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 929-940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, secretion of calpains from inside of cells into extracellular matrix is critical for the effect of calpain on cell motility. We have previously discovered that nicotine or nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone-induced calpain phosphorylation promotes secretion of μ- and m-calpains from lung cancer cells into culture medium through a nonclassical pathway involving vesicles (7Xu L. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53683-53690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 8Xu L. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4457-4466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To test whether C2-ceramide-induced dephosphorylation of calpains affects their secretion, H460 cells were treated with nicotine (50 nm) in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of C2-ceramide for 24 h. The medium vesicles were collected as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Western blotting analysis indicates that C2-ceramide inhibits nicotine-induced nonclassical secretion of both μ- and m-calpains in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6). Calpain activity is required for de-adhesion of the cell body and rear to enable productive locomotion of adherent cells during wound repair and tumor invasion (28Shao H. Chou J. Baty C. Burke N. Watkins S. Stolz D. Wells A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5481-5496Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Either inhibition of calpain activity by a pharmacological agent or genetic disruption of calpain expression by gene silencing resulted in decreased cell migration and/or invasion (7Xu L. Deng X. J.

FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 3246-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), indicating that calpains are required components in the cellular machinery that governs cell motility. Because calpain activity is significantly elevated in various tumor cells when compared with nonmalignant cells (31Witkowski J. Zmuda-Trzebiatowska E. Swiercz J. Cichorek M. Ciepluch H.

Neoplasia. 2004; 6: 53-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and antisense-mediated suppression of m-calpain restricts invasion of carcinoma cells in vivo (2Mamoune A. Luo J. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4632-4640PubMed Google Scholar), this strongly suggests that elevated calpain activity in tumor cells may potentially facilitate tumor metastasis in a mechanism by accelerating migration and invasion. Thus, identifying the mechanisms leading to calpain being activated or inactivated may be of benefit in developing novel therapeutic strategies for treatment of metastatic tumors. Although calpain activity is regulated by multiple mechanisms, the best studied mechanism is activation by calcium because calpains contain calcium binding EF-hand motifs in domains IV and VI. However, structural data suggest that conformational changes caused by calcium occupancy of the EF hands alone are insufficient to align the active site catalytic residues properly (9Franco S. Huttenlocher A. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3829-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). In addition, the levels of calcium required to activate calpains in vitro do not exist within living cells. Therefore, other regulatory mechanism(s) including phosphorylation may play a critical role in regulating calpain activity. Our previous findings and those of others discovered that MAPKs ERK1/2 and protein kinase C ι function as physiological calpain kinases that can directly phosphorylate and activate calpains (7Xu L. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53683-53690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 8Xu L. Deng X. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 23341-23348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), suggesting that protein kinase(s)-mediated calpain phosphorylation may be another important mechanism for calpain activation. However, it is currently unclear whether calpain dephosphorylation mediated by a protein phosphatase plays a role in regulating calpain activity and cell motility. PP2A is a key protein serine/threonine phosphatase that is responsible for 30-50% of the total cellular serine/threonine dephosphorylation activity. PP2A can negatively regulate cell motility because inhibition of PP2A activity with okadaic acid stimulates migration of various tumor cells (19Young M. Kolesiak K. Meisinger J. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 100: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Young M. Liu S. Meisinger J. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 103: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Evidence reported here demonstrates that PP2A functions as a calpain phosphatase because specific disruption of PP2A activity by expression of small t antigen enhances phosphorylation of both μ- and m-calpains in association with increased calpain activity and cell motility (Fig. 1). Furthermore, PP2A not only co-localizes and interacts with both μ- and m-calpains but also directly dephosphorylates μ- and m-calpains in vitro (Figs. 3 and 4), indicating its potential direct role as a calpain phosphatase. Importantly, overexpression of PP2A/C results in calpain dephosphorylation, decreased calpain activity, and reduced cell migration and invasion (Fig. 4). By contrast, specific knock down of PP2A/C expression by RNAi increases calpain phosphorylation in association with accelerated cell motility (Fig. 5). These findings provide genetic evidence that PP2A is a physiological calpain phosphatase in vivo. Thus, PP2A suppression of cell migration and invasion may occur in a novel mechanism by directly dephosphorylating and inactivating the major calpain species, the μ- and m-calpains. The sphingolipid ceramide functions as a powerful second signal effector molecule that regulates diverse cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell cycle, cell senescence, cell motility, and cellular differentiation (33Gulbins E. Pharmacol. Res. 2003; 47: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It is clear that ceramide can stimulate PP2A activity by binding to its catalytic domain (25Law B. Rossie S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12808-12813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Here we found that the PP2A activator C2-ceramide not only promotes PP2A/C to associate with μ- or m-calpain but also potently induces calpain dephosphorylation (Figs. 2A and 3B), suggesting that μ- and m-calpains may function as downstream targets in the ceramide-induced suppression of cell motility (Fig. 2). We have previously demonstrated that nicotine or nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone-induced calpain phosphorylation promotes secretion of active μ- and m-calpains from lung cancer cells through a nonclassical pathway involving vesicles, which may have potential to cleave substrates in the extracellular matrix (7Xu L. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53683-53690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 8Xu L. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4457-4466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Because C2-ceramide potently blocks nicotine-stimulated calpain secretion (Fig. 6), this indicates that C2-ceramide-induced dephosphorylation of μ- and m-calpains by activating PP2A impedes calpain secretion, which may contribute to retardation of cell motility. In summary, our findings have identified PP2A as a novel physiological calpain phosphatase that can directly dephosphorylate and inactivate the major calpain species, the μ- and m-calpains. Ceramide-induced calpain dephosphorylation through activation of PP2A results in decreased calpain activity and suppression of calpain secretion, leading to reduced migration and invasion of human lung cancer cells. Thus, therapeutic activation of PP2A to dephosphorylate calpain by enhancing ceramide production may have clinical relevance for the treatment of cancer metastasis. We thank Drs.

Here, we report the identification of human CDCA4 (also know as SEI-3/Hepp) as a novel target gene of transcription factor E2F and as a repressor of E2F-dependent transcriptional activation. Analysis of CDCA4 promoter constructs showed that an E2F-responsive sequence in the vicinity of the transcription initiation site is necessary for the E2F1–4-induced activation of CDCA4 gene transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that E2F1 and E2F4 bound to an E2F-responsive sequence of the human CDCA4 gene. Like TRIP-Br1/p34SEI-1 and TRIP-Br2 (SEI-2), the transactivation domain of CDCA4 was mapped within C-terminal acidic region 175–241. The transactivation function of the CDCA4 protein was inhibited by E2F1–4 and DP2, but not by E2F5–8. Inhibition of CDCA4 transactivation activity by E2F1 partially interfered with retinoblastoma protein overexpression. Conversely, CDCA4 suppressed E2F1–3-induced reporter activity. CDCA4 (but not acidic region-deleted CDCA4) suppressed E2F1-regulated gene promoter activity. These findings suggest that the CDCA4 protein functions as a suppressor at the E2F-responsive promoter. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of CDCA4 expression in cancer cells resulted in up-regulation of cell growth rates and DNA synthesis. The CDCA4 protein was detected in several human cells and was induced as cells entered the G1/S phase of the cell cycle. Taken together, our results suggest that CDCA4 participates in the regulation of cell proliferation, mainly through the E2F/retinoblastoma protein pathway.

The E2F family of transcription factors integrates cellular signals and coordinates cell proliferation (1Nevins J.R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar, 2Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar). Studies in recent years have identified E2Fs as important transcriptional regulators of the expression of many genes involved not only in DNA replication and cell cycle progression, but also in DNA damage repair, apoptosis, and cell differentiation and development (3Dimova D.K.

Among the E2F family members, E2F1–5 possess a transcriptional activation domain at the C terminus and can induce transcription from target promoters together with dimerization partner DP1 or DP2 (5La Thangue N.B.

In contrast, E2F6 lacks a transcriptional activation domain and has been shown to compete for E2F-binding sites on promoters and to repress their activity (7Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol.

The E2F family is often subdivided into activator E2Fs (E2F1–3) and repressor E2Fs (E2F4–6) based on the pattern of their interactions with retinoblastoma tumor suppressor pocket-binding protein (pRb) 2The abbreviations used are: pRb, retinoblastoma tumor suppressor pocket-binding protein; HDAC, histone deacetylase; CBP, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein; PHD, plant homeodomain; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DBD, DNA-binding domain; RT, reverse transcription; TAD, transactivation domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; RNAi, RNA interference; FBS, fetal bovine serum; BrdUrd, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. family members (8Chellappan S.P.

Indeed, p300 and CBP interact with the activation domain of E2F1 and stimulate E2F1-mediated activation as coactivators (24Trouche D. Cook A. Kouzarides T.

On the other hand, HDAC1–3 activity is implicated in the pRb-mediated repression of E2F-regulated promoters in the G1 phase (26Harbour J.W. Dean D.C.

To achieve cell cycle arrest into the G1 phase, pRb also requires the activity of Brg1/Brm, the two known human homologs of the yeast nucleosome-remodeling complex SWI2/SNF2 (29Dunaief J.L.

Prohibitin and TopBP1 are known as Brg1/Brm-dependent E2F1-mediated repressors (30Wang S. Zhang B. Faller D.V. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3019-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). TopBP1, a DNA replication initiator/DNA repair protein, is induced by E2F1 and recruits Brg1/Brm to repress E2F1-induced apoptosis (31Liu K. Luo Y. Lin F.-T. Lin W.-C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Among transcriptional regulator proteins, TRIP-Br1/p34SEI-1 (hereafter referred to as TRIP-Br1; transcriptional regulator interacting with PHD bromodomain 1) belongs to a novel family of proteins that share the N-terminal SERTA (for SEI-1, RBT1, and TARA) motif (32Calgaro S. Boube M. Cribbs D.L. Bourbon H.M. Genetics. 2001; 160: 547-560Crossref Google Scholar). TRIP-Br1 was originally reported to activate cyclin D1-Cdk4 by antagonizing the inhibitory effect of p16INK4a during the late G1 phase of the cell cycle (33Sugimoto M. Nakamura T. Ohtani N. Hampson L. Hampson I.N. Shimamoto A. Furuichi Y. Okumura K. Niwa S. Taya Y. Hara E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3027-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The SERTA motif has been shown to be responsible for the interaction between TRIP-Br1 and Cdk4. Interestingly, TRIP-Br1 and TRIP-Br2 (SEI-2) make a direct functional contact with E2F1/DP1, stimulating E2F1 transcriptional activity (34Hsu S.I. Yang C.M. Sim K.G. Hentschel D.M. O'Leary E. Bonventre J.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2273-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). RBT1 (replication protein A-binding transactivator 1), a SERTA motif-containing protein, has also been characterized as a transcriptional coactivator, but uniquely binds the second subunit of replication protein A (35Cho J.M. Song D.J. Bergeron J. Benlimame N. Wold M.S. Alaoui-Jamali M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3478-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recently, in addition to TRIP-Br1 and TRIP-Br2, SEI-3 (hereafter referred to as CDCA4, a HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee-approved gene symbol; characterized previously as murine Hepp (36Abdullah J.M. Jing X. Spassov D.S. Nachtman R.G. Jurecic R. Blood Cells Mol.

Iida S. Shimizu Y. Nagata S. Fukunaga R. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As an approach toward a better understanding of the full extent of gene expression under the control of the E2F/pRb pathway in cell proliferation, we characterized a series of DNA replication initiators (38Yoshida K. Inoue I. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3802-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 39Yoshida K. Inoue I. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6250-6260Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), including members of the novel CDCA (cell division cycle-associated) family of genes as candidate genes, using DNA microarray experiments. 3K. Yoshida, unpublished data. The genes of the CDCA family are characterized by the association of their expression patterns with those of known cell cycle genes such as CDC2, CDC7, and cyclins (40Walker M.G. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2001; 1: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We focused initially on human CDCA4 to determine whether the CDCA4 protein is functionally related to TRIP-Br1 and TRIP-Br2. Interestingly, CDCA4 repressed E2F1-induced transcriptional activation, although TRIP-Br1 and TRIP-Br2 coactivated it. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene knockdown of CDCA4 resulted in an increase in cell proliferation independent of the p53 status. We suggest a model in which CDCA4 functions as a critical modulator of cell proliferation and serves as a negative feedback regulator of activator E2Fs by inhibiting E2F-dependent transcriptional activation. Bioinformatics—Bioinformatics analysis was performed as described previously (41Yoshida K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The TRANSFAC program (motif. genome.jp/) was used to determine the transcription factor-binding elements (42Heinemeyer T. Chen X. Karas H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Liebich I. Meinhardt T. Reuter I. Schacherer F. Wingender E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of human TRIP-Br1 family proteins were aligned using the ClustalW Version 1.83 program (clustalw.genome.jp/) (43Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56228) Google Scholar). The domain structure of the CDCA4 protein was searched using the Pfam program (pfam.wustl.edu/) and BLAST algorithms (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) (44Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J.

Construction of Plasmids—Human CDCA4 promoter fragments were generated by PCR from genomic DNA and ligated into the KpnI-digested pGL3-Basic vector (Promega Corp.). PCR primers were designed to amplify 1125-bp (–1097/+28; pGL3-ABCD), 875-bp (–847/+28; pGL3-BCD), 775-bp (–747/+28; pGL3-CD), 709-bp (–681/+28; pGL3-D), and 594-bp (–681/–88; pGL3-delD) fragments of the CDCA4 promoter sequences, which are numbered relative to the transcription initiation site at position +1 described in the NCBI Uni-Gene Database (Genome View). The GenBank™ accession number of the genomic clone used for the design of the PCR primers was AL512356. The forward (F) and reverse (R) PCR primers used were as follows: –1097F, 5′-CACGCCACTGTTGTCCAGCC-3′; –847F, 5′-TTTGCCCCAGCCATTCCTCT-3′; –747F, 5′-TCACTCCCAGGTTTCCCGAC-3′; –681F, 5′-CTGCGGATTGATCTGAGGAT-3′; –88R, 5′-CTTCCCGCGCTGCGGCGACG-3′; and +28R, 5′-TCCACAAAGGGTCGACGCTG-3′. KpnI sites were added to the forward and reverse primers to facilitate subcloning. Motif D (5′-TGTGGCGC-3′) was mutated (5′-TGTGAAGC-3′) for pGL3-mutD. To construct the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) and the CDCA4 fusion protein expression vector, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was performed as described below. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into their respective sites in the pCMV-BD vector (Stratagene). The Gen-Bank™ accession number of the cDNA clone used for the design of the PCR primers was NM_145701. The forward (F) and reverse (R) PCR primers used were as follows (with the BamHI sites in the forward primers and the EcoRI sites in the reverse primers underlined): DBD/1F, 5′-CGGGATCCTTTGCACGAGGACTGAAGAGG-3′; DBD/37F, 5′-CGGGATCCCTCCTGGACATGTCTCTG-3′; DBD/75F, 5′-CGGGATCCCAGGATGGGACGTGGCGCACA-3′; DBD/175F, 5′-CGGGATCCAGCTGCATGGAAGAGCTG-3′; DBD/174R, 5′-CGGAATTCTCAGGGGTTTTTAGTCTCCAG-3′; and DBD/241R, 5′-CGGAATTCTCAGGTCTCCACCAGGATCTC-3′. The full-length transactivation domain (TAD) of E2F1 was also cloned into the pCMV-BD vector. The GenBank™ accession number of the cDNA clone used for the design of the PCR primers was NM_005225. The PCR primers used were 5′-CGGGATCCGCCTTGGCCGGGGCCCCT-3′, 5′-CGGGATCCCTTAAGAGCAAACAAGGCCCG-3′, and 5′-CGGAATTCTCAGAAATCCAGGGGGGTGAG-3′ (with the BamHI sites in the forward primers and the EcoRI sites in the reverse primers underlined). The N-terminally FLAG-tagged CDCA4 and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged CDCA4 expression vectors were constructed as follows. Briefly, PCR products were digested with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into their respective sites in the pCMV-TAG2B (Stratagene) and pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences) vectors, respectively. The forward and reverse PCR primers used were DBD/1F and DBD/241R, respectively. The enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP)-CDCA4 fusion protein expression vector was constructed by PCR.

The human Brm expression vector (4102) was a gift from Dr. Christian Muchardt (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). The pTAG4A-p53 expression vector was described previously (45Goto Y. Hayashi R. Ogawa H. Eguchi I. Muramatsu T. Oshida Y. Ohtani K. Yoshida K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1759: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As a mock transfection, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) or pCMV-based vectors were used. The reporter plasmids pGL3-MCM7 (pGL3-0.46 kb) and pGL3-geminin (pGL3-4.98 kb) were described previously (38Yoshida K. Inoue I. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3802-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The pE2F-TA-Luc and pTA-Luc vectors were purchased from Clontech. Cell Culture and RNA Interference (RNAi)—HeLa (RCB0007, BioResource Center) and A549 cells (TKG0184, Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Institute of Development, Aging, and Cancer, Tohoku University) were cultured in Earle's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Bioserum, Fukuyama, Hiroshima, Japan), 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), and antibiotics/antimycotics (Invitrogen). Saos-2 cells (TKG0469, Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research) were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics/antimycotics. WI-38 cells (IFO50075, Health Science Research Resources Bank, Osaka, Japan) were cultured in Earle's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics/antimycotics. To measure the growth-dependent induction of human CDCA4 gene expression, Saos-2 cell growth was arrested in the G0 phase by incubation in the absence of FBS for 3 days, and the cells were reintroduced into the cell cycle by culture with 20% FBS. Cell lysates were recovered at 0, 14, and 24 h after serum stimulation. To determine the number of viable cells in culture, the WST-1 assay (Roche Applied Science) and the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega Corp.), which are based on quantification of the ATP present, were performed in accordance with the manufacturers' protocols. For RNAi, 2 × 105 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were plated onto a 6-well plate prior to transfections. Briefly, 125 pmol of annealed siRNA duplex (Ambion, Inc.) and 2.5 μl of transfection reagent were incubated in 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium (Invitrogen) for 15 min to facilitate complex formation. The resulting mixture was added to cells cultured in 2 ml of modified Eagle's medium. Twenty-four hours after the first siRNA transfection (day 1), cells were split 1:1 to maintain the cells in the log phase. Three hours after splitting, the second siRNA transfection was performed. The target sequences of the oligonucleotides used were as follows: CDCA4-1, 5′-GGUGUGUUUUCUUUUGUGCtt-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCACAAAAGAAAACACACCtt-3′ (antisense); and CDCA4-2, 5′-GCUUUCACAAGUCACUUGAtt-3′ (sense) and 5′-UCAAGUGACUUGUGAAAGCtt-3′ (antisense). Silencer negative control #1 siRNA (Ambion, Inc.) was used as a negative control. The cells were lysed after 24 h (day 2) and 72 or 96 h (day 3 or 4, respectively) following the second RNAi transfection to isolate total RNA and protein, respectively. 5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) Incorporation Assay—To determine DNA synthesis based on BrdUrd, labeling was performed (BrdUrd labeling and detection kit III, Roche Applied Science) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Control or CDCA4 siRNA was transfected into HeLa cells as described above. Twenty-four hours after the second siRNA transfection (day 2), 3 × 103 cells were plated onto a 96-well plate. The next day, cells were prelabeled with 10 μm BrdUrd for 14 h before treatment. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 70% ethanol and 0.5 m HCl for 30 min at –20 °C. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and treated with nuclease. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the cells were washed three times with PBS, and 1% bovine serum albumin-containing PBS including peroxidase-conjugated anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody was added to each well. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, cells were washed three times with PBS. BrdUrd labeling was visualized using peroxidase substrate and was measured at 405 nm with a reference wavelength at 490 nm. Luciferase Reporter Assay—For the reporter assay, 2 × 104 cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 200 ng of expression plasmid, 200 ng of firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL3-Basic or pE2F-TA-Luc), and 0.6 ng of Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid (pRL-TK, Promega Corp.) on a 24-well dish were used for each transfection. For TAD mapping, 200 ng of pCMV-BD construct, 200 ng of firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (pFR-Luc, Stratagene), and 0.6 ng of Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid (pRL-TK) on 24-well dish were used for each transfection. The cells were harvested 24 or 48 h after transfection, and a luciferase assay was performed using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega Corp.) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. The results were read with a luminescence microplate reader (Wallac 1420 ARVOsx multilabel counter, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Experiments were performed at least in triplicate. As a control for transfection efficiency, the firefly luciferase activity values were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity values. Data are presented as the means ± S.D. Statistical differences were analyzed using Student's paired t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. RT-PCR—Total cellular RNA was extracted from the cultured cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Control and E2F1 adenoviral vectors and virus were kindly provided by Dr. Kiyoshi Ohtani (Tokyo Medical and Dental University). The virus preparation and the virus infection procedure were as described (45Goto Y. Hayashi R. Ogawa H. Eguchi I. Muramatsu T. Oshida Y. Ohtani K. Yoshida K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1759: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 46Schwarz J.K. Bassing C.H. Kovesdi I. Datto M.B. Blazing M. George S. Wang X.F. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The RT step was performed as recommended by Invitrogen. Briefly, 500 ng of extracted RNA, oligo(dT) primer, and 1× annealing buffer were diluted in 8 μl of RNase/DNase-free water, heated to 65 °C for 5 min, and then chilled on ice. For first-strand cDNA synthesis, a heat-denatured RNA solution, together with 2× first-strand reaction mixture and SuperScript III/RNaseOUT enzyme mixture, was added to make up 20 μlof the reaction mixture, followed by incubation at 50 °C for 50 min, heating to 85 °C for 5 min, and cooling on ice. To amplify CDCA4 cDNA, primers 1F/GFP and 241R/GFP were used. To check the mRNA abundances in 16 different human tissues, human MTC multiple tissue cDNA Panels I and II (Clontech) were used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The primer set for amplification of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was included in the kit. PCR was then performed as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 25–30 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min. To amplify ORC1 (NM_004153) and CDC25A (NM_001789) cDNAs, the following primers were used: ORC1, 5′-CTGAGAGCCATCCTCGCAGA-3′ and 5′-GCTGGGCATGGTGGCATGTG-3′; and CDC25A, 5′-TAGGTGGGCTCCACAGGATG-3′ and 5′-AAGTCTGCCCCAGCTCCTTG-3′. PCR was then performed as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 27 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min. As a control, a GAPDH primer set (R&D Systems) was used. The amplified products were separated on 1% agarose gels and visualized by ultraviolet transillumination. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP assays were performed using the EZ-Chip kit (Upstate) following the manufacturer's instructions with some modification (38Yoshida K. Inoue I. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3802-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 39Yoshida K. Inoue I. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6250-6260Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 106 A549 cells were used for each ChIP; asynchronously growing cells were treated with formaldehyde at a final concentration of 1% to create protein-DNA cross-links; and the cross-linked chromatins were then extracted, diluted with SDS lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture, and sheared by sonication (Branson Sonifier II) on ice to fragments with an average length of ∼1000 bp. After being precleared with protein G-agarose at 4 °C for 1 h, the chromatin was divided into equally sized samples for immunoprecipitation with 2–5 μgof anti-E2F1 (catalog no. sc-193), anti-E2F4 (catalog no. sc-866), or anti-E2F6 (catalog no. sc-22823) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (Sigma). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, preblocked protein G-agarose was added, and the resultant immunocomplexes were pelleted by centrifugation after 1 h of incubation at 4 °C and washed with the buffer supplied with the kit. The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 1 mm EDTA), and the cross-links were reversed by incubation with proteinase K and RNase A. After phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of distilled water and analyzed by PCR. As an input control, 0.5% volume of ch"
https://openalex.org/W2055131998,"Chronic inflammation increases the risk of cancer and many cancers, including prostate cancer, arise at sites of chronic inflammation. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is an enzyme dominantly expressed during inflammatory reactions. Although synthesis of high amounts of nitric oxide (NO) by iNOS has been demonstrated in pathophysiological processes, such as acute or chronic inflammation, autoimmune diseases or tumorigenesis, the role of iNOS activity in most of these diseases is poorly understood. Analysing prostate cancer biopsies by immunohistochemistry we found iNOS protein expression in tumor cells strongly paralleled by nitrotyrosine suggesting that iNOS is fully active. In vitro, NO inhibits androgen receptor-dependent promoter activity and prostate specific antigen production as well as DNA-binding activity of the androgen receptor (AR) in a concentration-dependent manner. Inhibition of the activity of androgen receptor-dependent reporter constructs is neither owing to diminished AR protein levels nor owing to an inhibition of its nuclear import. In addition, NO inhibits the proliferation of androgen receptor-positive prostate cancer cells significantly more efficiently than proliferation of androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer cells. In summary, our findings suggest that intratumoral iNOS activity favors development of prostate cancer cells that are able to proliferate androgen receptor-independently, thereby promoting prostate tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2063565977,"Vibrio parahaemolyticus, causative agent of human gastrointestinal diseases, possesses several virulent machineries including thermostable direct hemolysin and type III secretion systems (TTSS1 and -2). In this report, we establish that TTSS1-dependent secretion and translocation of a V. parahaemolyticus effector protein VP1686 into the cytosol induces DNA fragmentation in macrophages. We performed yeast two-hybrid screening to identify the molecules involved in VP1686-mediated cell death pathways and showed that nuclear factor RelA p65/NF-κB physically interacts with VP1686. To understand the impact of this interaction on the NF-κB DNA binding activities in infected macrophages, we analyzed a series of deletion mutants for the TTSS and its secreted proteins. Induction of DNA binding activity of NF-κB was significantly suppressed, and increased macrophage apoptosis has been associated with V. parahaemolyticus strain, which contains both VP1686 and TTSS1. Macrophages lacking Toll-like receptor adaptor molecules MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88) or TRIF (TIR domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon β) showed similar sensitivity to VP1686. As a consequence of NF-κB suppression, microarray analysis has revealed that VP1686 translocation alerted the expression of many genes that have known functions in cellular responses to apoptosis, cell growth, and transcriptional regulation. Our results suggest an important role for Vibrio effector protein VP1686 that activate a conserved apoptotic pathway in macrophages through suppression of NF-κB activation independent of Toll-like receptor signaling.

When encountered with bacterial pathogens, multicultural organisms raise a series of defense mechanism. To ensure the survival, pathogenic bacteria have also evolved sophisticated invasion strategies that involve neutralization of host defense through inhibition of innate immune system, phagocytosis, or induction of apoptosis in macrophages. A broad range of bacterial pathogens, including Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio parahaemolyticus, uses a type III secretion system (TTSS) 2The abbreviations used are: TTSS, type III secretion systems; MyD88, myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88; TRIF, TIR domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon β; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TLR, Toll-like receptors; PI, propidium iodide; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; Fic, filamentation induced by cAMP. to deliver bacterial effector proteins into the host cell cytosol where they disrupt the signaling network (1Bhattacharjee R.N. Park K.S. Okada K. Kumagai Y. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Iida T. Honda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 3Mills S.D. Boland A. van der Sory M.P. Smissen P. Kerbourch C. Finlay B.B. Cornelis G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12638-12643Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The TTSS machinery is a needle-like structural complex formed by about 20 proteins, and its components are highly conserved among the bacterial species (4Cornelis G.R. Van Gijsegem F. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 735-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Recently genome sequencing of the clinical V. parahaemolyticus strain revealed that the strain has two gene clusters, TTSS1 and TTSS2, each encoding distinct type III secretion systems (5Makino K. Oshima K. Kurokawa K. Yokoyama K. Uda T. Tagomori K. Iijima Y. Najima M. Nakano M. Yamashita A. Kubota Y. Kimura S. Yasunaga T. Honda T. Shinagawa H. Hattori M. Iida T. Lancet. 2003; 361: 743-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Of the two TTSS encoding gene clusters of V. parahaemolyticus strain RIMD2210633, TTSS1 is almost similar to those of Yersinia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the number of genes, their order, and in the identity of each encoded protein. To date, four TTSS1-secreted effector proteins of V. parahaemolyticus (VP1686, VP1683, VP1680, and VPA450) have been identified by using a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, but none of them showed any significant homology to known effector proteins of other bacteria within the TTSS1 region (6Ono T. Park K.S. Ueta M. Iida T. Honda T. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 1032-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, the main function of the innate immune system is to recognize the presence of pathogen-associated molecular patterns on invading microbes and initiate downstream signal from Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which lead to the expression of inflammatory response-related genes (7Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4767) Google Scholar). The transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is a critical mediator of TLR signaling that controls the synthesis of cytokines, adhesion molecules, and other anti-apoptotic factors such as inhibitor of apoptosis protein, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor, and Bcl-2 families to ensure cellular survival by prevention of cell death (8Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6743) Google Scholar, 11Chen C. Edelstein L.C. Gélinas C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2687-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of antiapoptotic protein synthesis through NF-κB activation is also essential for host survival under versatile stress-induced conditions such as bacteria-faced macrophages. Thus, it is plausible, given the function of NF-κB to cell survival, that improper activities of this protein may also be involved in bacteria-induced macrophage apoptosis. Our previous study on DNA fragmentation patterns in HCT116 cells revealed that the induction of apoptosis by V. parahaemolyticus in these cells requires functional TTSS1 (1Bhattacharjee R.N. Park K.S. Okada K. Kumagai Y. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Iida T. Honda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). But the mechanism by which TTSS1 induces apoptosis in HCT116 cells remains poorly defined. In this study we show that VP1686 is an effector protein of V. parahaemolyticus injected by type III secretion system 1 into the cytoplasm and induces apoptosis in both cultured and thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages. VP1686 binds with RelA p65/NF-κB in yeast and inhibits the DNA binding activity of NF-κB in macrophages. On the basis of these results, we suggest that inhibition of NF-κB is sufficient to sensitize infected-macrophages to death by preventing induction of NF-κB targeted gene expression related to antiapoptotic function. Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—All the V. parahaemolyticus and Vibrio species strains used in this study were obtained from the Laboratory for Culture Collection, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University. V. parahaemolyticus strain RIMD2210633 (KP-positive, serotype O3:K6) was used for the construction of deletion mutants and for functional studies. Escherichia coli DH5α and SM10λpir (12Miller V.L. Mekalanos J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar) strains were used for the general manipulation of plasmids and the mobilization of plasmids into V. parahaemolyticus, respectively. The bacteria were cultured at 37 °C with shaking in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (for E. coli) and LB supplemented with 3% NaCl (for V. parahaemolyticus). Thiosulfate citrate bile salts sucrose agar (Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) was used for the screening of mutant strains. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: ampicillin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), and chloramphenicol (5 μg/ml). Cell Lines—RAW264.7 cells were grown as monolayer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 units/ml penicillin G. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were collected by peritoneal lavage with Hanks' balanced salt solution at 3 days after intraperitoneal injection of 2 ml of 4% sterile thioglycollate into 8-12-week-old mice. Peritoneal macrophages were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 units/ml penicillin G. VP1686 Complementation—The VP1686 gene (operon) containing a putative promoter region from the KXV-237 (RIMD2210633) strain was amplified by PCR using the following oligonucleotide primers 5′-GAGTAGGGGATCCCCGCCAAA-3′ and 5′-AATACCAACGTCGACAATCAC-3′. The amplified fragment was cloned into a pT7blue T vector and digested with BamHI and SalI. The digested fragment was then cloned into the pSA19Cm-MCS (13Park K.S. Arita M. Iida T. Honda T. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 5754-5761Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The plasmid was introduced into KX-V237 VP1686 deletion mutant by electroporation (1.5 kV, 1000 ohms, 25 microfarads). Infections of MyD88-/-, TRIF-/- Macrophages—MyD88 and TRIF knock-out mouse and Balb/c mice were injected with 4% thioglycollate 3 days before harvesting peritoneal macrophages. Approximately 2 × 105 peritoneal macrophages were seeded into a 10-mm dish and infected as described above. DNA Fragmentation—Both fragmented DNA and high molecular weight intact genomic DNA were extracted from 2 × 105 cells using the suicide-Track™ DNA ladder isolation kit (Oncogene, Madison, WI). 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis was followed by ethidium bromide staining. Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Assay—The cells were harvested and infected with V. parahaemolyticus as described above and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Staining was carried out using the annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (BioVision, Mountain View, CA). Briefly, 2 × 105 cells were resuspended in 1× binding buffer and incubated with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) for 5 min in darkness at room temperature. Annexin V binding was analyzed by FACScan cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with a FITC signal detector FL1 (excitation = 488 nm, green) and PI staining by the phycoerythrin emission signal detector FL2 (excitation = 585 nm, red). The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated from the total (104 cells) using FlowJo 4.5.2 software. Cytotoxicity assays—RAW 264.7 macrophages (2×104 cells) were seeded onto a 96-well plate and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Before infection with the bacteria, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, and further incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red and antibiotics. The release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the medium was assayed using the CytoTox96 nonradioactive cytotoxicity kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 4 h post-infection with bacteria, the supernatants were collected, and the release of LDH was quantified. LDH release (% cytotoxicity) was calculated using the equation ((A490 experimental release - A490 spontaneous release)/(A490 maximum release - A490 spontaneous release)) × 100. The spontaneous release is the amount of LDH released from the cytoplasm of uninfected cells, whereas the maximum release is the amount released by total lysates of uninfected cells by Triton X-100. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously (14Kawai T. Sato S. Ishii K.J. Coban C. Hemmi H. Yamamoto M. Terai K. Matsuda M. Inoue J. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). For the construction of bait plasmid, full-length VP1686 gene was cloned in-frame into GAL4 DNA binding domain of pGBKT7. Immunoblotting—Cells were infected with or without V. parahaemolyticus were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted. The cells were lysed in buffer X + bovine serum albumin (BSA; 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mg/ml BSA). Whole cell protein lysates were solubilized in loading buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose followed by incubation with the antibodies as mentioned in the figure legends. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—RAW macrophages (1×106) were stimulated with 50 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or infected with V. parahaemolyticus for 2 h. Nuclear proteins were extracted and then incubated with an end-labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a NF-κB binding site of the tumor necrosis factor α promoter in 25 μlof binding buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA EDTA, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol) for 20 min at room temperature and loaded on a native 5% polyacrylamide gel. The DNA-protein complex was visualized by autoradiography. The specificities of the shifted band were confirmed by adding antibodies specific for p65 NF-κB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Microarray Gene Chip Analysis—RAW cells were infected with TTSS deletion mutants of V. parahaemolyticus (m.o.i. 2) for 2 h. Total RNA was extracted (RNeasy kit, Qiagen), and double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA using the Superscript system (Invitrogen) primed with a T7-(dT)24 primer. To prepare biotin-labeled cRNA from this cDNA, an in vitro transcription reaction was performed in the presence of T7 RNA polymerase and biotinylated ribonucleotides (Enzo Diagnostics). The cRNA product was purified (RNeasy kit), fragmented, and hybridized to a mouse genome 430 2.0 gene array chip as per the manufacturer's instruction (Affymetrix). The chips were washed and scanned with a Gene-Array scanner (Affymetrix). The color intensity of gene expression was generated with the R (Version 2.2.1) and Bioconductor software. Identification of VP1686—Recent genome sequencing of the clinical V. parahaemolyticus strain RIMD2210633 identified two sets of genes for the type III secretion system (TTSS), TTSS1 and TTSS2 (5Makino K.

Previously we have shown that the cytotoxic activity of mutant strains having a deletion in the TTSS1 gene was significantly decreased as compared with that of the parent and TTSS2-mutant strains (1Bhattacharjee R.N.

To understand the role of TTSS in bacterial pathogenesis and in immunity, we infected macrophage cell line RAW264.7 with the deletion mutants for TTSS1 or TTSS2 for 4 h at the multiplicity of infection (m.o.i. 2). By Western blot analysis, we have confirmed the secretion and subsequent translocation of a bacterial effector protein called VP1686 in both culture medium and in RAW cell extract upon infection by the parent and TTSS2-deleted mutant strains of V. parahaemolyticus. However, no VP1686 was detected when macrophages were infected with the bacterial strain that is lacking TTSS1 (Fig. 1A). The data suggest that VP1686 was secreted and injected inside macrophages in a TTSS1-dependent manner. Previously several TTSS1-dependent secretion proteins (VP1680, VPA450) including VP1686 were also identified in bacterial culture supernatant by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (6Ono T. Park K.S. Ueta M. Iida T. Honda T. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 1032-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Using the proposed amino acid sequence of VP1686 (5Makino K. Oshima K. Kurokawa K. Yokoyama K. Uda T. Tagomori K. Iijima Y. Najima M. Nakano M. Yamashita A. Kubota Y. Kimura S. Yasunaga T. Honda T. Shinagawa H. Hattori M. Iida T. Lancet. 2003; 361: 743-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar), our conserved domain search using protein-protein BLAST detected that VP1686 belongs to the family of proteins called Fic (filamentation induced by cAMP) (Fig. 1, B and C). This family contains a central conserved motif HPFXXGNG in most of its diverse members and is suggested to be involved in regulatory mechanism of cell division, although exact molecular function of these proteins is still uncertain (Fig. 1D). Induction of DNA Fragmentation in V. parahaemolyticus-infected macrophages is TLR-independent and Requires Both TTSS1 and VP1686—In our previous studies, we have shown that one of the characteristic effects of TTSS1 is cytotoxicity to eukaryotic cells (1Bhattacharjee R.N. Park K.S. Okada K. Kumagai Y. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Iida T. Honda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 15Park K.S. Ono T. Rokuda M. Jang M.H. Iida T. Honda T. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 48: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We performed DNA fragmentation and annexin V staining assays of macrophages infected with mutant V. parahaemolyticus strain carrying deleted genes that encode TTSS system 1 and 2 as well as individual secretion proteins to determine whether any of them play a role in initiating programmed cell death in macrophages. Primarily, mutant strains lacking TTSS1, TTSS2, and each of the three proteins encoded by VP1686, VP1680, VPA450 were exposed to RAW macrophages (m.o.i. 2) (Table 1). Total DNA (genomic and fragmented) was prepared from infected cells after 4 h. Electrophoretic patterns indicate the presence of oligonucleosomal length DNA fragmentation (≤190 bp) in cells infected with TTSS2-deleted strain but not in uninfected cells or cells infected with TTSS1-deletion mutants (Fig. 2, A and B). Neither heat-killed bacteria nor bacteria-free cultural supernatant of 4-h post-inoculation were able to induce DNA fragmentation in RAW cells (data not shown). These results indicate that intact live bacteria and its TTSS1 components (not TTSS2) are involved in the apoptosis of macrophages and, thus, the cytotoxic activity of the parental strain.TABLE 1Bacterial strains used in this study tdh, thermostable direct hemolysis.Strain/plasmidGenotype or relevant phenotypeSourceV. parahaemolyticus strainsRIMD2210633Clinical isolate;tdhA+,tdhS+25POR-1Both tdh(AS) deleted from RIMD221063315ΔTTSS1POR-1ΔvcrD-12ΔTTSS2POR-1ΔvcrD-22VPΔ1686POR-1ΔVP16866VPΔ1680POR-1ΔVP16806VPAΔ450POR-1ΔVPA4506VP1686 complimentedPOR-1ΔVP1686 + VP1686This study Open table in a new tab To test whether the phenotype described above resulted from the specific function exerted by TTSS1, RAW cells were infected with TTSS1-containing but TTSS2-deleted mutants of V. parahaemolyticus for 1.5 h. No DNA fragmentation was seen in these cells in this stage. We then washed the cells extensively to remove the extracellular bacteria or kill bacteria by incubating cells in fresh medium with 100 μg/ml gentamycin for 2, 3, and 6 h. In the absence of any surrounding live bacteria, apoptotic DNA fragmentation started to appear in cells 3 h after gentamycin treatment, indicating that the removal/killing of extracellular bacteria was unable to halt the signaling events initiated in these cells in the first 1.5 h (Fig. 2C). We hypothesize that once V. parahaemolyticus injects VP1686 inside the host cell cytoplasm, subsequent action of VP1686 were irreversible. With the help of Western blot analysis in an earlier experiment, we have indeed confirmed the presence of TTSS1-dependent VP1686 translocation in apoptotic RAW whole cell extract and in cell culture supernatant (Fig. 1A). Several previous studies demonstrated that activated TLRs could act as a potent inducer of apoptosis in macrophages that encounter a bacterial pathogen (16Hsu L.C. Park J.M. Zhang K. Luo J.L. Maeda S. Kaufman R.J. Eckmann L. Guiney D.G. Karin M. Nature. 2004; 428: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 17Haase R Kirschning C.J. Sing A. Schrottner P. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Wagner H. Heesemann J. Ruckdeschel K. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4294-4303Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To determine whether TLR signaling could play a role in the mechanism of apoptosis induction by V. parahaemolyticus we investigated DNA fragmentation pattern in primary mouse peritoneal macrophages that are deficient for functional TLR adapters MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88) and TRIF (TIR domain-containing adapter inducing interferon β). MyD88 is a central adapter shared by almost all TLRs (18Takeuchi O. Akira S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 270: 155-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and TRIF is used in TLR4 signaling activated by bacterial LPS independent of MyD88 (19Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Sanjo H. Takeuchi O. Sugiyama M. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S. Science. 2003; 301: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (2527) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, both MyD88-/- and TRIF-/- macrophages underwent apoptosis upon infection with TTSS1-containing mutant (Fig. 2D) Thus, signaling events originated from TLR due to bacterial recognition is not essential for VP1686-induced macrophage apoptosis. Annexin V Binding Analysis Shows VP1686-mediated Induction of Apoptosis—To support and extend the DNA fragmentation experiments, we performed double-staining using annexin V-FITC and PI followed by flow cytometry. Fig. 3 shows that in RAW cells, when infected with mutant strains that lack either TTSS1 or its effector VP1686, only 7.6 and 3.9% cells were stained positive (right-bottom quadrant) for phosphatidylserine, a marker of early stages of apoptosis. Almost an equal number of the apoptotic cells were stained for asynchronously grown uninfected cells (5.7%), which could be the cells committing natural cell death without any external induction. Interestingly, a considerable increase in apoptotic cells was found when macrophages were infected with the mutant strains lacking TTSS2, VP1680, or VPA450, but TTSS1 and VP1686 were retained (39.6, 37.8, and 26.2%, respectively). These results strongly suggest that the remaining secretory components such as VP1686 and its injection machinery TTSS1 in the parental strain might be the principal apoptosis inducer in macrophages. Complementation of VP1686 in VP1686-deleted strain Reverses Cytotoxicity—In an attempt to reveal whether Vibrio-induced apoptosis is specific to VP1686 or a more general phenomenon in apoptosis provocation, we complemented the gene for VP1686 in VP1686-deleted mutant strain because this strain showed diminished cytotoxic potential. By assaying LDH release from the RAW macrophages, we see the changes in reversion of its cell death ability due to VP1686 complementation. LDH, a stable cytosolic enzyme, was shown to be released upon cell lysis during the later stages of apoptosis as well as in early stages of necrosis (20Bhattacharjee R.N. Park K.S. Uematsu S. Okada K. Hoshino K. Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Iida T. Honda T. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 6604-6610Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To confirm the successful genetic complementation, we detected the expression of VP1686 protein by Western blot analysis in previously VP1686 non-producing strains (Fig. 4A). Consistent with VP1686 carrying wild type strains, as shown in Fig. 4B, the wild type and the VP1686-complimented strains showed increased and almost indistinguishable levels of macrophage cell death (75 and 85%, respectively) after 4 h of infection (m.o.i. 2). The LDH experiment also supports our existing annexin V staining result that both the TTSS1-deleted mutant and VP1686-deleted mutants showed considerable decreases in cellular cytotoxicity (20-25%). Interestingly, macrophages when incubated with LPS for 8 h (50 ng/ml) did not show any increase in cell death. A restored level of LDH release attributed to VP1686-complemented strains prompted us to conclude that this protein plays a specific role in macrophage cell death. VP1686 Interacts with NF-κB p65 in Yeast and Suppresses DNA Binding Activity of NF-κB in Macrophages—Unlike several other bacterial infection-induced apoptosis in macrophages, the mechanism of VP1686-induced apoptosis was not dependent on cell cycle arrest, caspase-1 activity (data not shown), and TLR-mediated signaling. In an effort to understand the mechanism of VP1686-induced apoptosis in macrophages, we employed the yeast two-hybrid method to identify VP1686-interacting protein(s) by using full-length VP1686 as bait. From a screen of ∼4×105 yeast transformants, 14 cDNA clones scored positive for reporter gene activities. Sequence analysis revealed that two of these clones encoded a similar portion of NF-κB. To further explore this interaction, full-length VP1686, full length of another TTSS1-dependent secretor protein VP1680, the N terminus of VP1686, and the C terminus of VP1686 were studied in the yeast two-hybrid systems. Fig. 5A showed that NF-κB interacted with the full-length VP1686 as well as with the N terminus of VP1686 but not with the VP1680 nor with the C terminus of VP1686. The result indicates that the well conserved Fic domain in VP1686 is not necessary for this interaction. NF-κB is an important transcriptional regulator of inducible expression of numerous genes involved in apoptosis, inflammation, and innate immune response. To investigate whether V. parahaemolyticus induces NF-κB DNA binding activity consistent with Entero-pathogenic Eschericia coli, Yersinia, and Salmonella, RAW cells were challenged with V. parahaemolyticus for 2 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared and subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assays using consensus oligonucleotide NF-κB probe. Uninfected cells served as a negative control, whereas macrophage incubated with LPS for 2 h was used as a positive control. Fig. 5B shows that the VP1686 inhibits DNA binding activity of the NF-κB because as a result of TTSS1 deletion from the strain that no longer can secret VP1686, NF-κB was able to bind with DNA in macrophages. As expected, NF-κB activation was severely impaired in macrophages infected with TTSS2-deleted strain, which contains functional TTSS1. Similar to TTSS1 mutant, VP1686-deleted strain also failed to block NF-κB activation. In addition, we have found that upon re-introduction of the VP1686 gene in the VP1686-deleted strain by genetic complementation, the capability to suppress activation of NF-κB was restored. The specificity of the band was confirmed by a shift by treatment with anti-p65 antibodies (Fig. 5C). Together, the analysis of the different mutant Vibrio strains indicates that VP1686 impairs NF-κB activation and subsequently mediates apoptosis in macrophages. Differential Gene Expression Pattern in RAW Macrophage Infected with TTSS1 and TTSS1 Deletion Mutants—The transcription factor NF-κB is involved in dozens of signaling pathways regulating many aspect of cellular activities such as cell growth and differentiation, apoptosis, stress, immune response, inflammation, and adhesion. To determine the effect of VP1686-induced NF-κB suppression on NF-κB-mediated gene expression, we infected macrophages with the mutant strains containing or lacking TTSS1 (at m.o.i. 2 for 2 h) and employed microarray technology. Using this technology, the expression pattern of more than 34,000 genes was analyzed and compared with un-infected control. Data analysis was focused on genes that were altered with more than a 2-fold change. There were about 235 genes that were differentially expressed due to the inactivity of NF-κB which are presented as a hierarchical clustering in Fig. 6 for the genes which appeared in 7 different clusters. These genes belong to different biological processes, such as apoptosis, cell death, response to stress, and transcriptional regulation. Expression profile of selected genes and specific pathways in which the genes are involved were classified by gene ontology (Table 2 and 3).TABLE 2Signaling pathways modulated in macrophages infected with TTSS1 mutantsGene nameGenBank™ accession no.ΔTT1/ConΔTT2/ConΔTT2/ΔTT1Signaling pathwaysRgs1NM_0158112.5433.7513.3G-protein-coupled receptor protein signalingOpn3NM_0100987.3810.461.4G-protein-coupled receptor protein signalingKlf6NM_0118031.474.192.9Cytokine- and chemokine-mediated signalingCsnk2a1BB2837592.454.131.7Wnt receptor signaling pathwayRgs20.583.225.5G-protein/cell cycle signal transductionCd47NM_0105813.052.510.8Integrin-mediated signaling pathwayCcr1AV2316482.5019.707.9Myeloid cell differentiation signaling pathwayEntpd1BI15144014.506.750.5Platelet activation signaling pathwayPtger3D174060.230.271.2Cytosolic calcium ion regulation pathwayJag2AV2646810.420.210.5Cell communication/Notch signaling pathwayGria3BM2205765.546.911.2Potassium ion transport pathwayAkt1s1BF0198393.724.401.2Notch signaling pathwayLtbp3BB3248230.190.100.5Transforming growth factor-α receptor signaling pathway Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Functional categorization of differentially expressed genes in macrophages infected with TTSS1 mutantsGene nameGenBank™ accession no.ΔTT1/conΔTT2/conΔTT2/ΔTT1ApoptosisBnip3lAK0186681.33.22.4PycardBG0842300.560.260.46Bcl2aL164626.135.350.87Pdcd2BI5261953.154.061.29Casp3D8635211.8519.461.64BfarAK0138742.193.931.80Dapk1BC0266710.650.270.41Dnaja3AK0078520.370.270.74Als2cr2BB2779120.300.592.01Igf1BG0926771.6011.857.41Irak3AV2284930.510.320.63Mcl1AV3184944.8725.925.32Tnfrsf1bM604696.236.241.00Bhlhb4NM_0806410.600.190.32Cell growth and differentiationEmp1U256331.033.933.84Ifrd1NM_0135622.864.261.49Egr1NM_0079132.324.161.79Ccr1AV2316482.5019.707.88Smap1BC0069461.534.733.09Rtel1BG0710280.300.602.01Regulation of transcriptionCdkn2cBC0270260.380.190.50RxrbBC0194320.281.093.84Rnf12NM_0139161.503.592.39Klf4BG0694130.726.529.00NfkbizAB02655123.7523.550.99Bcl3NM_0336013.285.141.57Irf2NM_0083910.480.210.44Ddx5NM_0078401.633.532.17Runx3NM_01973255.4376.331.38Hmgb1AI6487591.104.193.81ArntAV2337930.700.250.36Ets2AV2967030.300.752.53 Open table in a new tab We have identified the secreted protein VP1686 as the effector molecule responsible for the induction of apoptosis in macrophages infected by V. parahaemolyticus and that the effect depends on TTSS1. VP1686 belongs to the Fic protein family. This family contains a central conserved motif in most diverse members including Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster and suggested to be involved in the regulatory mechanism of cell division. To date, the exact molecular function of these proteins is unknown. However, we have first identified VP1686 as an inducer of apoptosis in macrophages. A previous report from our group has shown that protein VP1680 of V. parahaemolyticus, also secreted via TTSS1, is associated with HeLa cell toxicity (6Ono T. Park K.S. Ueta M. Iida T. Honda T. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 1032-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In this study we confirmed that the deletion mutant of VP1686 but not VP1680 fails to elicit apoptosis in macrophages. Therefore, VP1686 action may be specific to macrophages. Macrophages are essential components of the innate immune system, vital for recognition and elimination of microbial pathogens. Macrophages use TLRs to identify common pattern of pathogens, such as LPS, and in turn activate intracellular signaling pathways related to inflammation, immunity, and pro-apoptosis as well as anti-apoptosis (21Medzhitov R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (3279) Google Scholar, 22Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8883) Google Scholar). Numerous studies indicate that TLR- and MyD88-mediated signaling play an essential role in the initiation of apoptosis in bacteria-faced macrophages. Several reports showed that macrophage apoptosis by either Gram-positive (Bacillus anthracis) or Gram-negative (Yersinia, Salmonella) pathogens required activation of TLR4 by LPS (16Hsu L.C. Park J.M. Zhang K. Luo J.L. Maeda S. Kaufman R.J. Eckmann L. Guiney D.G. Karin M. Nature. 2004; 428: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In the case of Shigella-, Salmonella-, and Yersinia-induced cytotoxicity of macrophages, type III secretion system was also required (1Bhattacharjee R.N. Park K.S. Okada K. Kumagai Y. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Iida T. Honda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Medzhitov R. Nat. Rev.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 1823-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We have shown here that macrophages from mice lacking MyD88 and TRIF, two signaling adapter proteins that act downstream of TLR4 (MyD88 is shared by almost all TLRs), are equally sensitive to apoptosis induction by V. parahaemolyticus infection and conclude that VP1686 action does not require TLRs or LPS. In earlier reports using different infection models there was increasing evidence that NF-κB activation is important for self-defense and survival of macrophages when encountered with bacteria (16Hsu L.C. Park J.M. Zhang K. Luo J.L. Maeda S. Kaufman R.J. Eckmann L. Guiney D.G. Karin M. Nature. 2004; 428: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 21Medzhitov R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (3279) Google Scholar). The NF-κB system also plays a central role in innate immunity that systematically detects and eliminates microbial pathogens by TLR-mediated gene expression. Therefore, it is conceivable that to establish pathogenic action in such a hostile environment bacteria require the delivery of a unique virulent mechanism(s). Triggering the activation of proapoptotic signals, hindering their cytotoxic effects by the antiapoptotic activity of the host, such as mediated by the NF-κB.A in a series of studies, suggests that Yersinia type III secretion machinery injects YopP/YopJ protein into the macrophage, where it binds and inhibits the NF-κB-activating inhibitory κβ kinase, leading to down-regulation of NF-κB activation (17Haase R Kirschning C.J. Sing A. Schrottner P. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Wagner H. Heesemann J. Ruckdeschel K. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4294-4303Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 22Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8883) Google Scholar). DNA binding of NF-κB was also actively suppressed in apoptotic macrophages by viable E. coli-secreted and -translocated effector protein B (Esp-B) (24Hauf N. Chakraborty T. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2074-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with the notion that translocated Vibrio effector protein VP1686 shares common property of Yersinia, Escherichia, or Shigella to mediate suppression of both basal and signal induced NF-κB activity through interference with NF-κB signaling. Unlike Yersinia or Escherichia, prior activation of macrophages by LPS was not required for VP1686-induced apoptosis. Gene expression studies have revealed differential expression of more than 235 genes between TTSS1-containing or TTSS1-lacking V. parahaemolyticus infection of macrophages. Genes that are up-regulated or down-regulated after infection include genes that participate in diverse biological processes, such as cell death, cell adhesion, signal transduction, response to stress, cell growth and/or maintenance, and transcriptional regulation (Tables 2 and 3). More importantly, about 15 different signaling pathways and 29 genes involved in apoptotic and cell growth pathways were altered in their expression profiles. In summary, this study provides new insights into the mechanism by which V. parahaemolyticus triggers apoptosis in macrophages. By injection of VP1686, Vibrio affects the signaling networks of a highly conserved host defense system mediated by NF-κB. Although TLR represents a key inducer of NF-κB pathway, cytosolic action of VP1686 in macrophages may disrupt NF-κB activities directly without the signaling dependence from TLRs. Further investigation is required to understand the role of specific NF-κB target molecule(s) in the apoptotic pathway induced by V. parahaemolyticus.

The nature of cellular processes involves manipulation of nucleic acids for diverse metabolic events such as replication, recombination, repair, transcription, translation, and splicing of transcripts (1Alberts B. Cell. 1998; 92: 291-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Helicases are a ubiquitous class of enzymes that couple the chemical energy associated with NTP hydrolysis with the mechanical manipulation of nucleic acids (2Delagoutte E. von Hippel P.H. Q. Rev.

However, it has become clear that many helicase-like proteins perform additional and/or disparate functions beyond simple unwinding of double strand nucleic acid (4von Hippel P.H. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Catalytically, TraI is a 192-kDa ssDNA 3The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single strand DNA; dsDNA, double strand DNA; nt, nucleotide(s); MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; NLLS, non-linear least squares. 3The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single strand DNA; dsDNA, double strand DNA; nt, nucleotide(s); MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; NLLS, non-linear least squares. dependent NTPase that possesses both helicase and transesterase activities (11Matson S.W.

Previous work has shown that TraI translocates with a 5′ to 3′ directional bias and requires at least 20 nt of ssDNA for unwinding of dsDNA in vitro (13Csitkovits V.C. Zechner E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48696-48703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 14Lahue E.E. Matson S.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 3208-3215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Early reports suggested that the enzyme functions in a multimeric state, as evidenced by formation of aggregates at low ionic strength and low ATPase activity at KCl concentrations >150 mm (15Abdel-Monem M.

Chem. 1988; 263: 3208-3215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An analysis of the kinetic mechanism describing TraI helicase activity has not been performed to date. Rapid-quench flow experiments were performed under a variety of conditions to address the transient state kinetics associated with TraI-catalyzed unwinding of dsDNA. Specifically, the kinetic step size of TraI was measured using experimental approaches and numerical techniques described previously (18Ali J.A. Lohman T.M. Science. 1997; 275: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 19Lucius A.L. Vindigni A. Gregorian R. Ali J.A. Taylor A.F. Smith G.R. Lohman T.M. J. Mol.

Pre-steady-state experiments were also performed to address whether TraI kinetic parameters change under conditions favoring monomeric forms of the enzyme. The results reported herein provide evidence that TraI can function as a processive monomeric helicase. Materials—ATP (disodium salt) and Sephadex (G-25) were obtained from Sigma. HEPES, Na4EDTA, β-mercaptoethanol, bovine serum albumin, Mg(OAc)2, KOAc, SDS, xylene cyanol, bromphenol blue, NaCl, glycerol, and KOH were obtained from Fisher. T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from New England Biolabs. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from New England Nuclear. DNA oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) were purified by preparative PAGE and stored in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA. All oligonucleotides were resuspended in 10 mm HEPES/1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. Recombinant TraI was purified as described (11Matson S.W. Ragonese H. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Lahue E.E. Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3208-3215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and quantified by UV absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 129,795 m-1 cm-1. Helicase Substrates—The sequences for the DNA substrates used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. The loading strand of each substrate was radiolabeled. Purified oligonucleotides were 5′-radiolabeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase at 37 °C for 1 h. The kinase was inactivated by heating to 70 °C for 10 min, and unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was removed by passing the reaction mixture over two Sephadex G-25 columns. Helicase substrates were prepared by adding 1.5 equivalents of the complementary oligonucleotide to the 5′-radiolabeled oligonucleotide, followed by heating to 95 °C for 10 min, and then slow cooling to room temperature. Rapid Quench-flow Helicase Unwinding Experiments—Unwinding assays were performed with a rapid chemical quench-flow instrument (Kintek, Austin, TX) maintained at 25 °C (unless otherwise stated) with a circulating water bath. All concentrations listed are after mixing, unless otherwise stated. The helicase reaction buffer consisted of 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm NaCl. TraI was stored and when necessary diluted in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm Na4EDTA, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, and 50% glycerol prior to performing the unwinding assays. For pre-steady-state experiments TraI (final concentration of 40 nm) was incubated on ice for 2-5 min with 100 nm radiolabeled DNA substrate and reaction buffer. For the excess enzyme experiments, TraI (final concentration of 200 nm or 100 nm) was incubated for 2-5 min with 2 nm radiolabeled DNA substrate and reaction buffer. When single-turnover conditions were required 10 μm poly(dT) was included to prevent TraI from re-binding to the radiolabeled substrate following the first catalytic turnover. Unless otherwise stated, the reaction was initiated by adding 5 mm ATP, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 30-fold excess re-annealing trap. The sequence of the re-annealing trap is complementary to the displaced strand of the substrate so that re-annealing of the displaced strand to the radiolabeled loading strand was prevented following TraI-catalyzed separation. The reaction mixture was rapidly mixed with 200 mm EDTA/0.7% SDS to quench the reaction following the allotted timeframe. 25 μl of the quenched solution was then added to 5 μl of non-denaturing gel loading buffer (0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol in 6% glycerol). Finally, the dsDNA substrate was separated from ssDNA product on a 20% native polyacrylamide gel. Supplemental Fig. S1 shows two representative gels. Radiolabeled substrate and product were visualized by using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuaNT software. The quantity of radioactivity was used to determine the ratio of double-stranded oligonucleotide substrate to single-stranded oligonucleotide product as a function of time. Non-linear Least Squares Analysis of Unwinding Data—TraI-catalyzed unwinding of varying lengths of dsDNA was analyzed using the n-step sequential mechanism shown in the scheme given in Fig. 3. Such analyses have been performed previously, and the numerical techniques have been described in rigorous detail (20Lucius A.L. Maluf N.K. Fischer C.J. Lohman T.M. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 2224-2239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Data fitting was performed using the program Scientist (Micromath, St. Louis, MO). Equation 1 represents the analytic expression describing the time-dependent formation of ssDNA product, fss(t), for the reaction scheme (see Fig. 3), as has been defined previously (18Ali J.A. Lohman T.M. Science. 1997; 275: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 19Lucius A.L. Vindigni A. Gregorian R. Ali J.A. Taylor A.F. Smith G.R. Lohman T.M. J. Mol.

The resulting expression Fss(s)isthe Laplace transform of Equation 1, describing the minimal reaction scheme for unwinding by a helicase that does not dissociate readily from the DNA substrate lengths used for in vitro unwinding assays,Fss(s)=kun(kNP+sx)s(kNP+s)(ku+s)n where s is the Laplace variable of the fraction of ssDNA product formed over time, fss(t) (Equation 1). The inverse Laplace transform,L−1, can then be obtained using the numerical integration capabilities of Scientist to obtain fss(t) as shown in Equation 4.fss(t)=L−1(Fss(s))=(kun(kNP+sx)s(kNP+s)(ku+s)n)(Eq. 4) The reaction scheme (see Fig. 3) assumes that each step in the series along the unwinding pathway is identical. The kinetic step size (m) is then defined with Equation 5,m=LT−L0n(Eq. 5) where LT equals the total length of dsDNA in bp, and L0 equals the minimal length of dsDNA that is stable in the presence of an active helicase. By replacing n (in Equation 4) with Equation 5 and performing NLLS analysis of the subsequent expression, an estimate of m can be obtained. Effect of ssDNA Overhangs and Fork Substrates on TraI-catalyzed Unwinding of dsDNA—Previously, TraI has been shown to require an ssDNA region of >20 nt to initiate unwinding under conditions allowing multiple enzymatic turnovers (13Csitkovits V.C. Zechner E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48696-48703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Rapid-quench flow experiments were performed under excess-enzyme conditions with substrates containing a 5′-overhang of varying length or a fork substrate (Fig. 1). Results for TraI-catalyzed separation of fork substrate, 30 nt:30 bp, 45 nt:30 bp and 60 nt:30 bp are plotted in Fig. 1B. The amount of ssDNA product increases as the ssDNA overhang length is increased. The presence of both a 5′- and 3′-overhang (fork substrate) did not enhance the rate of unwinding, indicating that a fork substrate is not required for TraI. TraI-catalyzed Unwinding of Varying Lengths of dsDNA— The optimal ssDNA overhang contained 60 nt. The effect of varying duplex length was investigated by designing several substrates that contained a 60-nt overhang and 15, 22, 30, or 45 bp of duplex DNA. Single-turnover rapid-quench flow experiments were then performed under excess-enzyme conditions, and the results are shown in Fig. 2. Simultaneous NLLS analysis of the unwinding data for all five substrates resulted in the kinetic parameters listed in Table 1. All of the substrates are unwound to a similar extent, regardless of the length of the duplex, indicating that TraI does not dissociate from the substrate under these conditions. The progress curve for each substrate contains a slower phase, which accounts for the final fraction of ssDNA product. This slower phase appears despite the inclusion of a protein trap in the reaction mixture. Therefore, the slower phase is likely due to the formation of a small quantity of non-productive enzyme-substrate complex that slowly isomerizes to form productive enzyme-substrate complex as has been described for other helicases such as Rep (21Bjornson K.P. Amaratunga M. Moore K.J. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14306-14316Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and UvrD (18Ali J.A. Lohman T.M. Science. 1997; 275: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The longer substrates exhibit a lag phase in the early portion of the unwinding progress curve (Fig. 2B). The lag phase increases with increasing duplex length, consistent with a stepping mechanism.TABLE 1Global kinetic parameters determined from NLLSConditionskukNPAverage mAverage mkUs–1bp step–1bp s–1Excess TralaKinetic parameters obtained from fitting data in Fig. 2 to Equation 4 based on the reaction scheme (Fig. 3)137 ± 111.4 ± 0.18.2 ± 1.11120 ± 160Excess DNAbKinetic parameters obtained from fitting data in Fig. 6 to Equation 4 based on the reaction scheme (Fig. 3)175 ± 300.9 ± 0.16.2 ± 0.51085 ± 90Local kinetic parameters for different lengths of dsDNAdsDNA lengthm excess Tralm excess DNAbpbp step–1158.9 ± 0.66.7 ± 1.0229.6 ± 0.75.6 ± 0.9306.6 ± 0.55.8 ± 1.0457.6 ± 0.66.2 ± 1.0608.2 ± 0.66.7 ± 1.0a Kinetic parameters obtained from fitting data in Fig. 2 to Equation 4 based on the reaction scheme (Fig. 3)b Kinetic parameters obtained from fitting data in Fig. 6 to Equation 4 based on the reaction scheme (Fig. 3) Open table in a new tab The reaction scheme (Fig. 3) shows a stepwise mechanism that can account for the lag phase observed in DNA unwinding. The scheme includes a step for slow isomerization of a non-productive, enzyme-substrate complex. Because all of the amplitudes are similar and are close to complete unwinding, these relatively short DNA substrates cannot be utilized to discern dissociation constants of the enzyme from the DNA substrate. Hence, dissociation is not included in the kinetic mechanism in the reaction scheme. Based on previous work from Lucius et al. (19Lucius A.L. Vindigni A. Gregorian R. Ali J.A. Taylor A.F. Smith G.R. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 409-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Lucius A.L. Maluf N.K. Fischer C.J. Lohman T.M. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 2224-2239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we applied Equation 4 to globally fit data in Fig. 2 to obtain rate constants for unwinding as well as the number of base pairs unwound per kinetic step (or step size). The resulting kinetic parameters are shown in Table 1. TraI unwound the DNA very rapidly with an average rate constant of 137 s-1 per kinetic step and an average kinetic step size of 8.2 ± 1.1 bp. These values correspond to a rate of 1120 ± 160 bp s-1 for DNA unwinding making TraI one of the fastest helicases studied to date. For comparison, RecBCD has been shown to unwind dsDNA at a rate of ∼790 bp s-1 at 25 °C (19Lucius A.L. Vindigni A. Gregorian R. Ali J.A. Taylor A.F. Smith G.R. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 409-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) when measured using oligonucleotide substrates and ∼970 bp s-1 when measured by direct observation of single RecBCD molecules (22Bianco P.R. Brewer L.R. Corzett M. Balhorn R. Yeh Y. Kowalczykowski S.C. Baskin R.J. Nature. 2001; 409: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). DNA Unwinding under Steady-state Conditions—Previous work with the NS3 helicase domain indicated that the ssDNA overhang could bind multiple molecules of enzyme and that more molecules bound to the same substrate led to greater activity (23Levin M.K. Wang Y.H. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26005-26012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Similar behavior was observed with Dda helicase, whereby multiple molecules of enzyme bound to the same strand of DNA produced greater enzymatic activity for DNA unwinding (24Byrd A.K. Raney K.D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12990-12997Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and for displacement of streptavidin from biotinylated DNA (6Byrd A.K. Raney K.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). TraI required a relatively long ssDNA overhang (60 nt) for optimal activity, indicating that similar behavior might be exhibited by this enzyme. Experiments were conducted under steady-state conditions to determine whether multiple TraI molecules could bind to the 60-nt overhang and perhaps exhibit cooperativity for DNA unwinding. Steady-state conditions were examined in which the concentration of DNA substrate was in excess of TraI (Fig. 4). The resulting rates for unwinding were plotted as a function of TraI concentration, resulting in no apparent increase in the specific activity of the enzyme (Fig. 4B). An additional feature of the steady state results was the positive intercept of the unwinding plots observed at higher concentrations of TraI (filled squares and filled triangles in Fig. 4A). The positive intercept suggested that TraI might exhibit a “burst amplitude” under pre-steady state conditions as was observed previously with Dda helicase (25Nanduri B. Byrd A.K. Eoff R.L. Tackett A.J. Raney K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14722-14727Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Pre-steady-state Unwinding of dsDNA by TraI—Varying concentrations of TraI were incubated with an excess of the 60 nt:22 bp substrate, and the unwinding reaction was initiated by rapid mixing with ATP. The resulting data clearly exhibit a burst amplitude for ssDNA product formation (Fig. 5). The initial burst phase is complete at ∼30 ms and is followed by a slower phase in which ssDNA product continues to form. This slow phase is reminiscent of the slow phase observed in the single turnover experiments, which was attributed to a slow isomerization of non-productively bound enzyme (Fig. 2). By definition, the pre-steady state experiments are conducted in the absence of a protein trap so that a steady-state phase can ensue after the burst phase. To determine whether the slow phase exhibited under pre-steady-state conditions represents a slow isomerization or a steady state, an experiment was conducted in which TraI was rapidly mixed with substrate and ATP. The experiment effectively measures whether free TraI in solution has time to bind to substrate and unwind the DNA during the first 0.5 s of the reaction. As seen in Fig. 5A, no product was observed under these conditions (filled circles). Therefore, under these conditions, TraI that is free in solution does not rapidly associate with and unwind the DNA substrate during the initial 0.5 s of the reaction. Therefore, the slow phase observed in pre-steady-state experiments was due to a slow isomerization, as was observed under single-turnover conditions. The data in Fig. 5 were fit to a three-step mechanism, including a slow isomerization step similar to that in the reaction scheme (Fig. 3). The burst amplitude of ssDNA during the first 0.5 s corresponds to the concentration of TraI that is capable of forming ssDNA. The amplitude was divided by the TraI concentration and plotted versus TraI concentration in Fig. 5B. The resulting amplitudes range from 0.6 to 0.75, which is consistent with a monomeric form of TraI because the amplitudes are >0.5, or 50% of the available enzyme. Kinetic Step Size Determined under Pre-steady-state Conditions—Pre-steady-state conditions clearly favor a monomeric form of TraI. The kinetics of DNA unwinding were determined under these conditions to compare them to those obtained under single turnover, excess enzyme conditions. Unwinding was measured with 40 nm TraI and 100 nm substrate for the five DNA substrates (Fig. 6). The amount of time required for product to form increases as a function of dsDNA length, consistent with a stepping mechanism, and the time courses resemble the data from single-turnover experiments. Simultaneous, NLLS analysis of the unwinding data for all five substrates resulted in the kinetic parameters listed in Table 1. The amplitudes for all five substrates are very similar, which is consistent with TraI being a highly processive helicase. In contrast, Dda helicase from bacteriophage T4 can clearly function as a monomer (25Nanduri B. Byrd A.K. Eoff R.L. Tackett A.J. Raney K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14722-14727Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), but it does so in a non-processive manner. Dda exhibits >85% burst amplitude for unwinding short 12- to 16-bp substrates (25Nanduri B. Byrd A.K. Eoff R.L. Tackett A.J. Raney K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14722-14727Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), but the burst amplitude for Dda-catalyzed unwinding of substrates decreases for every base pair added to the dsDNA length (26Eoff R.L. Raney K.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Monomeric TraI exhibits a ∼70% burst amplitude when unwinding 60 bp, making TraI one of the first documented cases of a highly processive monomeric helicase. The kinetic mechanism describing TraI-catalyzed unwinding of dsDNA was investigated using transient-state kinetic approaches. Increasing the ssDNA overhang increases the amplitude of TraI-catalyzed unwinding (Fig. 1), consistent with previous steady-state analysis of TraI activity (13Csitkovits V.C. Zechner E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48696-48703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The lack of complete unwinding of the shorter substrates might be due to poor binding of TraI. For example, association of TraI with the short substrates appears to lead to substantial amounts of non-productively bound substrate. Rapid dissociation and re-association of substrate with TraI may not occur during the short time frame for this experiment (0.5 s). Further experiments were performed under single-turnover conditions with respect to the DNA substrate. Product formation occurred in a bi-phasic manner, even in the presence of a protein trap (Fig. 2). TraI-catalyzed unwinding of dsDNA proceeded at a very rapid rate (∼1100 bp s-1), as determined from NLLS fitting of the data in Fig. 2 to Equation 4, which is derived from the reaction scheme (Fig. 3). An interesting feature of both the pre-steady-state and excess enzyme experiments is the similar product amplitude obtained for all lengths of dsDNA tested. TraI readily unwound substrates up to 60 bp in length, indicating that this helicase is highly processive. Attempts to determine the dissociation constant by fitting the data in Fig. 2 to schemes that allow for enzyme dissociation led to dissociation rate constants that were close to zero with very high errors (not shown). The relatively short duplexes used in this study are insufficient to provide an accurate measure of TraI processivity. The long ssDNA overhang required for optimal DNA unwinding activity was reminiscent of recent studies with other helicases such as NS3h (23Levin M.K. Wang Y.H. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26005-26012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and Dda (24Byrd A.K. Raney K.D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12990-12997Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). NS3h and Dda are non-processive helicases that dissociate prior to completion of unwinding leading to inefficient unwinding of longer DNA substrates. Multiple molecules of NS3h have been proposed to increase the quantity of DNA unwinding through “functional cooperativity” (23Levin M.K. Wang Y.H. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26005-26012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In this model, trailing molecules of helicase complete the unwinding process after leading molecules dissociate from the substrate. We examined TraI-catalyzed DNA unwinding under steady-state conditions to determine whether cooperativity could be observed. However, the specific activity for DNA unwinding did not increase with increasing concentration of TraI (Fig. 4). More precise examination of DNA unwinding by TraI under pre-steady-state conditions was performed to observe whether TraI could function as a monomeric helicase (Fig. 5). By placing DNA substrate in excess of TraI, the distribution of TraI species bound to any single DNA substrate favors the monomeric state. A burst in product formation that is >50% of the total enzyme concentration in the reaction is indicative of a monomeric enzyme (25Nanduri B. Byrd A.K. Eoff R.L. Tackett A.J. Raney K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14722-14727Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Indeed, TraI produced a burst amplitude that was >50% (Fig. 5), even when the DNA duplex length was increased to 60 bp (Fig. 6). These results indicate that TraI can function as a helicase in the monomeric state. Relating the kinetic step size to a physical step is an important goal toward understanding helicase mechanisms. Structural studies of PcrA helicase have been interpreted in terms of a 1-bp step size (27Velankar S.S. Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Subsequent kinetic studies of PcrA translocation on ssDNA also provided a kinetic step size of 1 bp, correlating with the structural studies (28Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). By varying the length of dsDNA, the TraI kinetic step size was measured to be 8.2 ± 1.1 bp per step under excess-enzyme conditions (Table 1). A similar step size of 6.2 ± 0.5 bp was determined under pre-steady-state conditions. A physical description of the kinetic step size for TraI remains to be determined. For comparison, the kinetic step size determined for other helicases range from 3.9 bp for RecBCD (19Lucius A.L. Vindigni A. Gregorian R. Ali J.A. Taylor A.F. Smith G.R. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 409-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), 4.5 bp for UvrD (18Ali J.A. Lohman T.M. Science. 1997; 275: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and 1.4 bp for DnaB (29Galletto R. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 83-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). RecBCD has two motors, each of which operates on one of the DNA strands (30Dillingham M.S. Spies M. Kowalczykowski S.C.

Nature. 2004; 432: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). UvrD functions as a dimer (32Maluf N.K. Fischer C.J. Lohman T.M. J. Mol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 31350-31358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results reported thus far do not indicate any correlation between kinetic step size and the oligomeric state of the enzyme. The physical step size for a helicase may be directly related to the kinetic step size, as suggested in the case of DnaB (29Galletto R. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 83-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that multiple kinetic steps exist that make up the observed kinetic step. For example, a discrete step of ∼11 bp for NS3 was recently reported based on single molecule measurements (34Dumont S. Cheng W. Serebrov V. Beran R.K. Tinoco I. Pyle Jr., A.M. Bustamante C. Nature. 2006; 439: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). However, actual unwinding appeared to occur as smaller substeps of ∼3.6 bp. The oligomeric state of NS3 has not been clearly defined, but evidence for a monomeric form of the enzyme was presented in the single molecule experiments (34Dumont S. Cheng W. Serebrov V. Beran R.K. Tinoco I. Pyle Jr., A.M. Bustamante C. Nature. 2006; 439: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Galletto et al. (29Galletto R. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 83-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) observed that plotting the number of kinetic steps as a function of duplex length provided evidence for spontaneous melting of the very end of the duplex. Recent work with the Dda helicase has shown that the final ∼8 bp of dsDNA melt spontaneously during unwinding (26Eoff R.L. Raney K.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To accurately calculate the kinetic step size and unwinding rate associated with TraI catalysis, the number of base pairs catalytically separated by the enzyme must be known. An overestimate of both kinetic step size and unwinding rate will be obtained if spontaneous melting of the end of the substrate occurs but is not taken into account. The kinetic step size for TraI was plotted as a function of each duplex length under excess enzyme and pre-steady-state conditions (Fig. 7). Interestingly, when the data were fit to a linear function, the intercept was near zero under both conditions, indicating that little or no duplex DNA melted spontaneously during TraI-catalyzed unwinding. Therefore, we did not include spontaneous melting in the kinetic analysis of TraI-catalyzed DNA unwinding. This result might be explained by the fact that TraI is a 192-kDa helicase with multiple DNA binding domains (11Matson S.W. Ragonese H. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is possible that TraI contains one or more domains that bind to the DNA substrate upstream and/or downstream of the helicase domain. For example, RecBCD helicase contains one domain that binds to the duplex region of the substrate (31Singleton M.R. Dillingham M.S. Gaudier M. Kowalczykowski S.C. Wigley D.B. Nature. 2004; 432: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). It is possible that such a domain might assist in preventing spontaneous melting of dsDNA by binding to the duplex, which would explain why spontaneous melting of the final base pairs is not observed. In conclusion, transient-state kinetic analysis of TraI helicase activity indicates that TraI-catalyzed unwinding of dsDNA is both very rapid and highly processive. TraI can function as a monomeric helicase. The need for a very long ssDNA binding site suggests a role for DNA binding domains that are external to the helicase domain, which likely contributes to the high processivity of this enzyme. The lack of spontaneous melting of the final base pairs during DNA unwinding may further indicate that the DNA binding domains external to the helicase play some role in DNA unwinding. Importantly, the properties described here and elsewhere (10Matson S.W. Sampson J.K. Byrd D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2372-2379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 13Csitkovits V.C. Zechner E.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 3208-3215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for TraI make this a unique DNA helicase. First, the unwinding rate reported here is faster than the unwinding rate reported for any helicase to date. TraI is known to unwind the 100-kbp F plasmid for transfer to recipient cells in a matter of a few minutes, consistent with this rate. In addition, when the F plasmid is integrated into the chromosome in Hfr strains, chromosomal DNA is transferred from the donor to the recipient. Classic mapping studies of the E. coli chromosome suggested the entire 4.6-Mbp chromosome could be transferred in ∼100 min. If TraI-catalyzed unwinding of duplex DNA is the rate-limiting step in this process, then an unwinding rate of ∼800 bp/s would be required to complete this event. This is very similar to the unwinding rate reported here. Second, TraI is a bifunctional protein that catalyzes a transesterase reaction in addition to the helicase reaction described here. The transesterase activity is required to initiate conjugative DNA transfer and results in covalent attachment of TraI to the 5′-end of the transferred DNA strand (10Matson S.W. Sampson J.K. Byrd D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2372-2379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A monomeric unwinding enzyme would be ideally positioned to complete the unwinding event required for DNA transfer. Finally, this is the first monomeric Superfamily I helicase that has been shown to catalyze a fast, processive unwinding reaction. Although the motor subunits of RecBCD are also Superfamily I helicases, these proteins do not appear to catalyze rapid, processive unwinding in the absence of the other components of the RecBCD complex (29Galletto R. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 83-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, the biochemical characterization of TraI is consistent with the biological role this enzyme is believed to play in conjugative DNA transfer. Download .zip (.06 MB) Help with zip files"

https://openalex.org/W1975601584,"Functional inactivation of transcription factors in hematopoietic stem cell development is involved in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Stem cell regulator C/enhancer binding protein (EBP)α is among such transcription factors known to be inactive in AML. This is either due to mutations or inhibition by protein–protein interactions. Here, we applied a mass spectrometry-based proteomic approach to systematically identify putative co-activator proteins interacting with the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of C/EBP transcription factors. In our proteomic screen, we identified c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) 1 among others such as PAK6, MADP-1, calmodulin-like skin proteins and ZNF45 as proteins interacting with DBD of C/EBPs from nuclear extract of myelomonocytic U937 cells. We show that kinase JNK1 physically interacts with DBD of C/EBPα in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we show that active JNK1 inhibits ubiquitination of C/EBPα possibly by phosphorylating in its DBD. Consequently, JNK1 prolongs C/EBPα protein half-life leading to its enhanced transactivation and DNA-binding capacity. In certain AML patients, however, the JNK1 mRNA expression and its kinase activity is decreased which suggests a possible reason for C/EBPα inactivation in AML. Thus, we report the first proteomic screen of C/EBP-interacting proteins, which identifies JNK1 as positive regulator of C/EBPα."

Although melanin is widely distributed as a pigment in tissues and other structural biomaterials, to our knowledge, Glycera jaws represent the first known integument to exploit melanin as a cohesive load- and shape-bearing material. Nature is richly endowed with blueprints for building robust load-bearing structures from ordinary biomolecules such as minerals, proteins, polysaccharides, and polymers of secondary metabolites. The architecture and general composition of the jaws of Glycera species have been studied for decades (1Michel C. Fonze-Vignaux M.T. Voss-Foucart M.-F. Bull. Biol. Fr. Belg. 1973; 107: 301-321PubMed Google Scholar, 2Voss-Foucart M.-F. Fonze-Vignaux M.T. Jeuniaux C. Biochem. Syst. Ecol. 1973; 1: 119-122Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 3Gibbs P.E. Bryan G.W. J.

Science. 2002; 298: 389-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), but their precise chemical structure remains unclear. Lichtenegger et al. (4Lichtenegger H.C. Schoberl T. Bartl M.H. Waite J.H. Stucky G.D. Science. 2002; 298: 389-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) recently reported that Glycera jaws contain polycrystalline nanofibers of the copper hydroxychloride atacamite (Cu2Cl(OH)3). This discovery was of particular significance as the first reported instance of a copper-based biomineral. It was shown that mineralized fibers at the jaw tip reinforce the stiffness, hardness, and possibly abrasion resistance of the material. This reinforcement is especially relevant given the habit of the worm of surprise attacks from a sandy or gravelly concealment and its need to penetrate prey armored by an outer carapace. Since all biological structures are thought to be composites (5Wegst U.G.K. Ashby M.F. Philos. Mag. 2004; 84: 2167-2181Crossref Scopus (607) Google Scholar), investigating how nanoscale mechanical properties correlate with the interplay of organic and inorganic content is requisite to understanding structure and function. Significantly, because the mineral content of Glycera jaws is relatively low (under 10%), the organic component must play a prominent role in the mechanics of the jaws. This was particularly apparent from mechanical studies of Glycera jaw in that even the base of the jaw, which contained no detectable mineral, exhibited hardness and stiffness more comparable with ceramics than any known organic polymers (6Waite J.H. Lichtenegger H.C. Stucky G.D. Hansma P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7653-7662Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Melanin is a nearly ubiquitous pigment in biology. Animal melanins can be crudely classified as black eumelanins and yellow-to-brown pheomelanins, and in plants, fungi, and bacteria, as brown-to-black allomelanins (7Nicolaus R.A. Lederer E. Chemistry of Natural Products. Hermann, Paris1968: 9-12Google Scholar). Eumelanin generally consists of a network of about 4–6 covalently linked indole groups per layer, sometimes functionalized with carboxylates, hydroxyls, or other groups (8Cheng J. Moss S.C. Eisner M. Zschack P. Pigm. Cell Res. 1994; 7: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 9Cheng J. Moss S.C. Eisner M. Pigm. Cell Res. 1994; 7: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Layers stack on each other a few Ångstroms apart to create an insoluble black mass (10Thathachari Y.T. Pigm. Cell. 1976; 3: 64-68Google Scholar). Eumelanins are resistant to hydrolysis in acid or base but can be oxidatively decomposed with hydrogen peroxide, especially at alkaline pH (11Ito S. Wakamatsu K. Ozeki H. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 215: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 12Napolitano A. Pezzella A. Vincensi M.R. Prota G. Tetrahedron. 1995; 51: 5913-5920Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The non-proteinaceous organic jaw residue remaining after exhaustive acid hydrolysis of Glycera jaws represents over one-third of the original dry weight and is morphologically indistinguishable from the whole jaw (3Gibbs P.E. Bryan G.W. J. Mar. Biol. Assoc. UK. 1980; 60: 205-214Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The substantial acid-resistant residue of Glycera jaws has not previously been chemically examined. The present study more clearly defines the chemical structure of this residue. The results indicate that the residue remaining after acid hydrolysis is definitely a melanin, albeit an unusual one. Melanin and other polyphenolic networks, often as part of an extracellular matrix, provide many diverse functions in nature (13Barr F.E. Med. Hypotheses. 1983; 11: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 14Riley P.A. Pigm. Cell Res. 1992; 5: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Riley P.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1235-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). One of these functions, protein cross-linking, was proposed to have mechanical consequences in insect cuticle (14Riley P.A. Pigm. Cell Res. 1992; 5: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 16Hackman R.H. Goldberg M. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 41: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 17Sugumaran M. Bioorg. Chem. 1987; 15: 194-211Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar); changes in the mechanical properties of fungal cell walls have also been correlated with melanin synthesis (18Money N.P. Caesar-TonThat T.-C. Frederick B. Henson J.M. Fungal Genet. Biol. 1998; 24: 240-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Melanins resemble other common biopolymers such as N-acetyldopamine-stabilized sclerotins and lignins in being polyaromatic. Unlike the load-bearing sclerotins and lignins, however, the best known melanins are colloidal suspensions associated with the concealment inks of cephalopods and the pigments of integument and neural tissues. To our knowledge, this report is the first clear demonstration that melanin endows a structural biomaterial in a metazoan with mechanical properties that are distinct from those contributed by mineral or structural proteins. Glycera dibranchiata worms from Maine Bait Company (Newcastle, ME) were dissected for jaws. Pulp tissue surrounding jaws was removed by soaking jaws 24 h in water followed by the removal of pulp tissue with microforceps. Jaws were dried and weighed. Hydrolyses—Unless otherwise stated, batches of 4–5 mg of Glycera jaws or Sepia melanin were vacuum-sealed in glass ampoules containing 300 μl of 6 m HCl with 10 μl of phenol and heated at 110 °C. After 48 h, acid and hydrolysate were removed. The solid sample remaining was washed extensively with water and methanol, dried, and rehydrolyzed. Altogether, samples were hydrolyzed 6 days, with the hydrolysis solution replaced after 2 and 4 days. These samples are referred to as hydrolyzed jaws and hydrolyzed Sepia. Glycera jaws were also hydrolyzed in 4 n NaOH at 100 °C, and similar results were obtained. When applicable, hydrolyzed Glycera jaws and hydrolyzed Sepia melanin were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to a powder using a mortar and pestle. These samples are referred to as hydrolyzed jaw powder and hydrolyzed Sepia powder. General Characterization—After 48, 96, and 144 h of hydrolysis, remaining insoluble jaws were massed, and solubilized hydrolysates at each point were subjected to several assays. Hydrolysates were submitted to ninhydrin-based amino acid analysis using a Beckman Coulter 6300 amino acid analyzer. Hydrolysates were also evaluated using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry and furnace atomization atomic absorption spectrophotometry to quantitate metals. H2O2-based Degradation to Quantify Melanin—Untreated and hydrolyzed Sepia melanin and jaw powder solubilized in alkaline H2O2 were analyzed for absorbance at 560 nm to determine total melanin content. Standard curves of untreated and hydrolyzed Sepia melanin were constructed using 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 mg/ml each melanin. Untreated and hydrolyzed Glycera jaw powders were suspended as 1 mg/ml solutions. One part 10 n NaOH and 2 parts 30% H2O2 were added to 37 parts each standard and sample. This mixture was incubated 30 min at 70 °C and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm to remove residual solids, and the visible absorbance of the supernatant was measured. Standard curves of untreated Sepia (R2 = 0.9951) and hydrolyzed Sepia (R2 = 0.9635) were linear at 560 nm. As hydrolysis may convert some hydroxyindole units to indole quinones, untreated and hydrolyzed Glycera jaw samples were compared with untreated and hydrolyzed Sepia standard curves, respectively. Solid State CP-MAS NMR—Approximately 40 mg of Glycera jaws were hydrolyzed 72 h at 110 °C in a vacuum-sealed ampoule containing 5 ml of 6 m HCl and 50 μl of phenol. Soluble hydrolysate was removed and replaced with another 5 ml of HCl and 50 μl of phenol at 48 h. After 72 h of hydrolysis, jaw residue was washed extensively and flash-evaporated. 13C cross polarization-magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) 3The abbreviation used is: CP-MAS, cross polarization-magic angle spinning. NMR spectra were measured from whole jaw and hydrolysis residue powdered samples in 4-mm zirconia rotors spinning at 12,000 rpm using a Bruker AVANCE 500 MHz spectrometer. All 13C shifts are referenced to tetramethylsilane. Vibrational Spectroscopy—Hydrolyzed Glycera jaw powder and hydrolyzed Sepia melanin powder were mixed 1:100 w/w with KBr, and the mixtures were ground in a mortar and pestle until uniform color was achieved. Aliquots were pressed into 5-mm pellets and characterized with IR spectroscopy. IR spectra of pellets were measured in transmission using a Nicolet Magna 850 IR spectrometer over the range of 400–4000 cm–1. Prior to measurement, the sample pellets were dried in a vacuum oven at 105 °C for 15 min. IR analyses were carried out in N2. Laser Desorption Ionization Mass Spectrometry—Hydrolyzed Glycera jaw powder and hydrolyzed Sepia melanin powder were analyzed using laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (19Seraglia R. Traldi P. Elli G. Bertazzo A. Costa C. Allegri G. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 22: 687-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Pezzella A. Napolitano A. d'Ischia M. Prota G. Seraglia R. Traldi P. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 11: 368-372Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Hydrolyzed and ground jaw and Sepia samples were dried thoroughly and then packed into small spots on a piece of double-sided tape. No matrix was used in these experiments. An accelerating voltage of 18,000 and 25,000 with a grid voltage of 94 and 93% was used to analyze the Glycera jaw powder and Sepia powder, respectively. Both samples were analyzed in positive ion mode, with 256 scans averaged. General Characterization—Jaw residue remaining after 48, 96, and 144 h of hydrolysis represents about 50, 42–45, and 38–40% of the total jaw dry weight, at each respective time point (Fig. 1). The mass removed has been almost entirely accounted for as protein, metal ions/mineral, and sulfates. The average composition of the removed protein is Gly-(50%) and His-rich (23%), but viewed from each time point, Gly is more readily released than His. Initially, His:Gly is 0.4 by mole fraction, but by day 4, this ratio jumps to between 3 and 4, and by day 6, it has reached between 7 and 8. The shape of the remaining jaw residue appears very similar to untreated jaws by optical microscopy, although the jaws shrink to ∼85% of their original length and width following the complete hydrolysis procedure (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Glycera jaws shrink through hydrolysis. a–d, optical image of Glycera jaws before hydrolysis (a), after 2 days of hydrolysis (b), after 4 days of hydrolysis (c), and after 6 days of hydrolysis (d).

Both materials can be solubilized, however, with H2O2 treatment, which is accelerated at alkaline pH or elevated temperature. The degradation of melanin by H2O2 is known to produce pyrrole acids (11Ito S. Wakamatsu K. Ozeki H. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 215: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 12Napolitano A.

Neurochem. 2003; 86: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), forming an orange-brown chromophore that increases linearly with the amount of melanin degraded (Fig. 3, a and b). This reaction has been previously exploited to detect melanin degradation products purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (12Napolitano A. Pezzella A. Vincensi M.R. Prota G. Tetrahedron. 1995; 51: 5913-5920Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 21Ito S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Here, with Sepia melanin as a standard, we assayed for melanin content based on the absorbance of degradation products at 560 nm. A standard curve of absorbance at 560 nm following oxidative degradation was constructed using both untreated and HCl-treated Sepia melanin (Fig. 3, a and b). When compared with the appropriate standard curve, untreated Glycera jaws are ∼37% melanin, whereas jaw residue following HCl hydrolysis is composed entirely of melanin. Solid State CP-MAS NMR—Based on expected chemical shifts of model compounds and published NMR assignments (26Adhyaru B.B. Akhmedov N.G. Katritzky A.R. Bowers C.R. Magn. Reson. Chem. 2003; 41: 466-474Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar) of Sepia melanin, the 13C CP-MAS NMR data collected for hydrolyzed Glycera jaw residue fit well (Fig. 4). The peaks at ∼190 and 170 ppm are assigned as unprotonated and protonated carboxyl groups, respectively. The major features of the spectrum occur between 160 and 100 ppm, which is the range of chemical shifts expected for aromatic and indolic carbons. These peaks are not resolved enough to assign every carbon expected in a melanin monomer unit, but the peaks at 158, 128, and 113 ppm fit well with the expected chemical shifts of a melanin monomer as shown in Fig. 4. Furthermore, aliphatic chemical shifts are also observed in the range of 0–100 ppm, as in published spectra of Sepia melanin. The peaks observed at ∼300 and –50 ppm are attributed to spinning side bands. Altogether, the NMR spectra in Fig. 4 match remarkably well with those of Sepia melanin. The NMR peaks are broad, but this is expected if the linkages between monomer melanin units are relatively heterogeneous. Vibrational Spectroscopy—IR spectra for hydrolyzed jaw powder and hydrolyzed Sepia are similar (Fig. 5) and fit well with established vibrations in the literature (27Bardani L. Bridelli M.G. Carbucicchio M. Crippa P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 716: 8-15Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 28Bilińska B. Spectrochim.

Spectrochim. Acta Part A. 2003; 59: 3075-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A broad band corresponding to phenolic OH stretches is seen at 3400 cm–1, aromatic C=C stretches and COO stretches are visible at 1600–1650 cm–1, and phenolic COH bends and indolic and phenolic NH stretches are visible at 1380–1400 cm–1. In addition, aliphatic stretches and alcohol OH stretches are visible in both samples. These results strongly suggest that in both Sepia and Glycera samples, the residues following hydrolysis are at least partially composed of phenolic rings with carboxyl and alcohol groups. Accepted partial structures of melanin include indole and pyrrole rings conjugated to form networks with carboxyl and alcohol functional groups. Laser Desorption Ionization Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometry of hydrolyzed Sepia and Glycera powders (Fig. 6) supports that both of these materials are composed of melanin networks. The major peak in the mass spectra of these materials occurs at 362 and 363 for Glycera and Sepia, respectively. In the mass spectrum of each material, there is a peak at 16, 52, and 189 daltons higher than this major peak. A mass difference of 16 is likely due to an additional hydroxyl group. A dihydroxyindole carboxylic acid would have a mass of 191, so a mass difference of 189 could derive from the corresponding quinone of this subunit (19Seraglia R. Traldi P. Elli G. Bertazzo A. Costa C. Allegri G. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 22: 687-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Pezzella A. Napolitano A. d'Ischia M. Prota G. Seraglia R. Traldi P. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 11: 368-372Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Sepia spectrum has a large peak 155 units lower than the major peak at 363, whereas Glycera powder has a large peak 182 units lower than the major peak. These can be accounted for by the presence or absence of a pyrrole carboxylic acid (mass 154) and the same group with a carboxyl moiety attached (mass 182) (19Seraglia R. Traldi P. Elli G. Bertazzo A. Costa C. Allegri G. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 22: 687-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Pezzella A. Napolitano A. d'Ischia M. Prota G. Seraglia R. Traldi P. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 11: 368-372Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As a highly heterogeneous polymer network, it is not surprising that two functionally different samples of melanin networks would exhibit slightly dissimilar mass spectra. Most biological integuments exhibit some degree of melanization, generally between 0.1 and 5% by weight (31Watts K.P. Fairchild R.G. Slatkin D.N. Greenberg D. Packer S. Atkins H.L. Hannon S.J. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 467-472PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kronstrand R. Forstberg-Peterson S. Kagedal B. Ahlner J. Larson G. Clin.

In contrast, the melanin in Glycera jaw, identified by Raman, IR, UV-visible, and solid state NMR and by laser desorption ionization analysis, represented 37% of the jaw by dry weight. This level exceeds typical melanin contents by an order of magnitude and suggests functions other than pigmentation. More importantly, by hydrolytically removing all constituents but melanin, Glycera jaws did not disintegrate, although melanins are not renowned as cohesive building materials for load-bearing structures. Sepia melanin, for example, is a dispersion of aggregated particles, each of which is itself an aggregate of stacked layers of oligomeric melanin units (8Cheng J. Moss S.C. Eisner M. Zschack P. Pigm. Cell Res. 1994; 7: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 9Cheng J. Moss S.C. Eisner M. Pigm. Cell Res. 1994; 7: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 35Clancy C.M.R. Simon J.D. Biochemistry. 2005; 40: 13353-13360Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The interactions driving aggregation are thought to be non-covalent (36Bratosin S. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1973; 60: 224-230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 37Liu Y. Simon J.D. Pigm. Cell Res. 2005; 18: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) because the cohesion between Sepia melanin particles is easily disrupted. In contrast, Glycera jaw melanin is organized into 200-nm-thick tablets arranged perpendicular to the long axis of the jaw. 4D. N. Moses, J. H. Harreld, G. D. Stucky, and J. H. Waite, unpublished data. We know of only one other instance, melanized fungal cell walls (18Money N.P. Caesar-TonThat T.-C. Frederick B. Henson J.M. Fungal Genet. Biol. 1998; 24: 240-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 38Eisenman H.C. Nosanchuk J.D. Webber J.B.W. Emerson R.J. Camesano T.A. Casadevall A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3683-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 39Money N.P. Howard R.J. Fungal Genet. Biol. 1996; 20: 217-227Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar), in which interactions between constituent melanins suffice to maintain structural integrity after all other molecules have been removed. The mechanism of this long range stabilization of melanins of Glycera jaw is not yet understood but probably involves linkages between melanin particles. This is supported by the fact that the melanin remaining following hydrolytic extraction of protein, mineral, and metal ions retained more than 50% of the initial stiffness of untreated jaws (40Moses D.N. Mattoni M.A. Slack N.L. Waite J.H. Zok F.W. Acta Biomater. 2006; 2: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The present results are thus the first demonstration of a melanin network that serves a distinct load-bearing and shape-determining role in a metazoan tissue. From a chemical perspective, melanins resemble the polyphenolic networks in sclerotized insect cuticles and the lignin matrix between the primary wall and plasmalemma of cell walls (41Bernards M.A. Lopez M.L. Zajicek J. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7382-7386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 42Hopkins T.L. Kramer K.J. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1992; 37: 273-302Crossref Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In these materials, low molecular weight dihydroxy- or methoxyphenolic precursors undergo complex polymerizations following oxidation. Although polyphenolic networks endow insect cuticles and woody plant tissues with mechanical strength and chemical stability, these effects rely on an intimate association between the networks, cuticular proteins, and chitin or cellulose fibers. Eumelanin has been detected in insect cuticles, but its contribution to mechanical and chemical properties is unknown (42Hopkins T.L. Kramer K.J. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1992; 37: 273-302Crossref Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Identifying the function of Glycera jaw melanin is an elusive challenge given the multifunctionality of melanins. Reported properties include microbial resistance, semiconductivity, electrical conductivity, light absorption, and metal chelation (14Riley P.A. Pigm. Cell Res. 1992; 5: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Riley P.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1235-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Although only metal chelation has been observed in Glycera jaw melanin, these properties could explain the apparently exotic choice of framework material of the worm for its jaws. Glycera jaw melanin has been shown to bind copper so tightly that the metal is not extractable by EDTA treatment (40Moses D.N. Mattoni M.A. Slack N.L. Waite J.H. Zok F.W. Acta Biomater. 2006; 2: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), in contrast to the zinc in clamworm jaws (43Broomell C.C. Mattoni M.A. Zok F.W. Waite J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2006; 209: 3219-3225Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) or mineral in teeth and bones (44Balooch M. Wu-Magidi I.-C. Balazs A. Lundkvist A.S. Marshall S.J. Marshall G.W. Siekhaus W.J. Kinney J.H. J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 1998; 40: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 45Tai K. Qi H.J. Ortiz C. J. Mater. Sci.: Mater. Med. 2005; 16: 947-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether copper is chemically bound or physically entrapped by the molecular constituents of Glycera jaws. This metal binding affinity could help organize the constituents of the jaws, namely protein, mineral, and metal, into an effective composite. Indeed, other melanins bind metal ions in vivo (46Sarna T. Hyde J.S. Swartz H.M. Science. 1976; 192: 1132-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and copper ions affect the structure of synthetic melanins (47Stepien K.B. Dworzanski J.P. Bilinska B. Porebska-Budny M. Hollek A.M. Wilczok T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 997: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Copper binding affinities of synthetic and Sepia melanins have been studied (48Szpoganicz B. Gidanian S. Kong P. Farmer P. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 89: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 49Liu Y. Hong L. Kempf V.R. Wakamatsu K. Ito S. Simon J.D. Pigm. Cell Res. 2004; 17: 262-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Melanin has been reported in other connective tissues. It is found in the extracellular matrix of the eye and interacts biochemically with constituents such as collagen XVIII (50Marneros A.G. Olsen B.R. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 2367-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), but a structural or mechanical role has not been shown. In fact, a recent study showed that the addition of melanin to an assay has no effect on the ability of retinas to contract collagen gels (51Smith-Thomas L.C. Richardson P.S.R. Rennie I.G. Palmer I. Boulton M. Sheridan C. MacNeil S. Curr. Eye Res. 2000; 21: 518-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Melanin is also found in bird feathers and was suggested to be part of the strengthening mechanism of feathers. However, when normalized for the position along the feather, melanized feather barbs have similar breaking stress, breaking strain, and toughness as unmelanized barbs (52Butler M. Johnson A.S. J. Exp. Biol. 2004; 207: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Fungal cell wall melanin is proposed to cross-link to proteins, thereby lowering cell wall permeability (53Hutchison K.A. Green J.R. Wharton P.S. O'Connell R.J. Mycol. Res. 2002; 106: 729-736Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and retaining cell shape when isolated from other cellular constituents (38Eisenman H.C. Nosanchuk J.D. Webber J.B.W. Emerson R.J. Camesano T.A. Casadevall A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3683-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Melanized fungal cells are more virulent than non-melanized cells (18Money N.P. Caesar-TonThat T.-C. Frederick B. Henson J.M. Fungal Genet. Biol. 1998; 24: 240-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 38Eisenman H.C. Nosanchuk J.D. Webber J.B.W. Emerson R.J. Camesano T.A. Casadevall A.

Phytochemistry. 2003; 63: 687-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), possibly because they can better penetrate host cell surfaces (18Money N.P. Caesar-TonThat T.-C. Frederick B. Henson J.M. Fungal Genet. Biol. 1998; 24: 240-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Other speculated roles of melanin in fungal cell walls include protection from UV light, hydrolytic enzymes, and host antimicrobials (38Eisenman H.C. Nosanchuk J.D. Webber J.B.W. Emerson R.J. Camesano T.A. Casadevall A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3683-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 54Doss R.P. Deisenhofer J. Krug von Nidda H.-A. Soeldner A.H. McGuire R.P. Phytochemistry. 2003; 63: 687-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Based on the present and related studies (40Moses D.N. Mattoni M.A. Slack N.L. Waite J.H. Zok F.W. Acta Biomater. 2006; 2: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), it appears that Glycera melanin provides significant chemical stability for the jaws. The jaws of a related polychaete species, Nereis virens, which also contain His-rich proteins and divalent metals but not melanin, provide an interesting comparison. Nereis jaws (43Broomell C.C. Mattoni M.A. Zok F.W. Waite J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2006; 209: 3219-3225Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 55Birkedal H. Khan R.K. Slack N. Broomell C. Lichtenegger H.C. Zok F. Stucky G.D. Waite J.H. ChemBioChem. 2006; 7: 1392-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) exhibit similar stiffness and hardness properties as the unmineralized portions of Glycera jaw; however, they disintegrate after 24 h of hydrolysis. Although the two structures are mechanically comparable, the chemical stability of Glycera jaws is much greater. It remains to be determined in what ways the habitats and/or diet of these worms necessitate such differences in chemical stability.

We predicted, therefore, that a propensity toward apoptosis might be regulated through changes in cellular CtBP levels. Previously, we have identified the homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 as such a regulator and demonstrated that HIPK2 activation causes Ser-422 phosphorylation and degradation of CtBP. In this study, we found that c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1 activation triggered CtBP phosphorylation on Ser-422 and subsequent degradation, inducing p53-independent apoptosis in human lung cancer cells. JNK1 has previously been linked to UV-directed apoptosis. Expression of MKK7-JNK1 or exposure to UV irradiation reduced cellular levels of CtBP via a proteasome-mediated pathway. This effect was prevented by JNK1 deficiency. In addition, sustained activation of the JNK1 pathway by cisplatin similarly triggered CtBP degradation. These findings provide a novel target for chemotherapy in cancers lacking p53.

These findings provide a novel target for chemotherapy in cancers lacking p53. Carboxyl-terminal-binding protein (CtBP) 2The abbreviations used are: CtBP, carboxyl-terminal-binding protein; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; HIPK2, homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2; JNK1, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α. was originally identified by virtue of its ability to interact with the carboxyl terminus of the adenoviral protein E1A (1Boyd J.M. Subramanian T. Schaeper U. La Regina M. Bayley S. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Like other E1A-binding proteins, CtBP also interacts with a wide variety of cellular factors, many of which have been characterized as DNA binding transcriptional repressors (2Chinnadurai G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 3Chinnadurai G. Chinnadurai G. CtBP Family Proteins. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX2005Google Scholar). Thus, CtBP has been categorized as a co-repressor. Genetic and biochemical studies in Drosophila have shown that CtBP is required for the functions of several developmentally important transcription factors, including snail, kruppel, knirps, and Tramtrack69 (4Nibu Y. Zhang H. Levine M. Science. 1998; 280: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 5La Rosee-Borggreve A. Hader T. Wainwright D. Sauer F. Jackle H. Mech. Dev. 1999; 89: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 6Lai Z.C. Li Y. Genetics. 1999; 152: 299-305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, CtBP has two isoforms, CtBP1 and CtBP2, which have been shown to participate in multiple developmental pathways as well (2Chinnadurai G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). A human disease, holoprosencephaly, results from a mutation in the CtBP-interacting domain of TGIF, a three amino acid loop extension (TALE) homeodomain protein (7Melhuish T.A. Wotton D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39762-39766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The embryonic lethality of CtBP1 and two genetic knock-outs in mice supports the idea that these factors are essential for mammalian development (8Hildebrand J.D. Soriano P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5296-5307Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Additionally, Evi-1, an oncoprotein responsible for acute myelogenous leukemia, requires interaction with CtBP to mediate transformation (9Izutsu K. Kurokawa M. Imai Y. Maki K. Mitani K. Hirai H. Blood. 2001; 97: 2815-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 10Palmer S. Brouillet J.P. Kilbey A. Fulton R. Walker M. Crossley M. Bartholomew C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25834-25840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Initially, CtBP was thought to negatively modulate the oncogenic transformation activity of the E1A protein (1Boyd J.M. Subramanian T. Schaeper U. La Regina M. Bayley S. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 11Subramanian T. La Regina M. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 415-420PubMed Google Scholar). Later, Grooteclaes and Frisch (12Grooteclaes M.L. Frisch S.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3823-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) demonstrated that this occurs by sequestering CtBP from its cellular targets. Genes regulated by CtBP have been identified serendipitously, for the most part, by identifying certain CtBP binding transcription factor binding sites in gene promoters. In this manner, for example, Grooteclaes and Frisch (12Grooteclaes M.L. Frisch S.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3823-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) determined that the cell adhesion gene E-cadherin was regulated by CtBP through the transcriptional repressor ZEB. Subsequent experiments showed that reducing cellular CtBP levels via small interference RNA up-regulates E-cadherin transcription (13Shi Y. Sawada J. Sui G. Affar el B. Whetstine J.R. Lan F. Ogawa H. Luke M.P. Nakatani Y. Nature. 2003; 422: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). A more comprehensive analysis of possible CtBP targets was achieved using microarray assays of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from animals engineered to contain mutations in the two mammalian CtBP isoforms (14Grooteclaes M. Deveraux Q. Hildebrand J. Zhang Q. Goodman R.H. Frisch S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4568-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). These studies supported the idea that CtBP is critically involved in gene regulation in mammalian systems. Of note, a group of genes up-regulated in the knock-out MEFs have been linked to apoptosis, including PERP (p53-effector related to pmp-22), p21, Noxa, and Bax. Interestingly, despite the fact that these genes are known p53 targets, CtBP and p53 appear to act through distinct mechanisms. Similar to cells in which p53 has been activated, the CtBP-null MEFs had an increased sensitivity to pro-apoptotic stimuli (14Grooteclaes M. Deveraux Q. Hildebrand J. Zhang Q. Goodman R.H. Frisch S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4568-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, CtBP can be considered to be an anti-apoptotic factor. Disruption of the two CtBP isoforms in mice causes lethality at day 8 of development due to a variety of defects (8Hildebrand J.D. Soriano P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5296-5307Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Relatively little is known about the regulation of transcriptional co-activators and co-repressors by intracellular signaling pathways. As opposed to modifications of specific DNA binding factors, phosphorylation of co-regulators has the potential to influence a large number of transcriptional programs. Such pathways are just beginning to be characterized. The understanding of CtBP regulation, however, is rudimentary. Kagey et al. (15Kagey M.H. Melhuish T.A. Wotton D. Cell. 2003; 113: 127-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) reported that CtBP was sumoylated on Lys-428 via the actions of PC2, a polycomb group protein, and this modification could contribute to the regulation of CtBP localization. The fact that CtBP is well known to be a phosphoprotein points to another possible mode of regulation. Our studies demonstrated that the nuclear serine/threonine kinase termed homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2 (HIPK2) phosphorylates CtBP at Ser-422 (16Zhang Q. Yoshimatsu Y. Hildebrand J. Frisch S.M. Goodman R.H. Cell. 2003; 115: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). HIPK2 had previously been shown to mediate the phosphorylation of p53 in response to UV irradiation, thereby activating p53 function and promoting apoptosis (17D'Orazi G. Cecchinelli B. Bruno T. Manni I. Higashimoto Y. Saito S. Gostissa M. Coen S. Marchetti A. Del Sal G. Piaggio G. Fanciulli M. Appella E. Soddu S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 18Hofmann T.G. Moller A. Sirma H. Zentgraf H. Taya Y. Droge W. Will H. Schmitz M.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Our studies showed that HIPK2 also promotes apoptosis through its effects on CtBP. Phosphorylation by HIPK2 targets CtBP to a proteasomal degradation pathway. The resultant decrease in CtBP levels, like the HIPK2 activation of p53, sensitizes cells to apoptosis. UV irradiation also appears to activate the CtBP degradation pathway and similarly promotes apoptosis in cells (including most tumor cells) that lack p53 (16Zhang Q. Yoshimatsu Y. Hildebrand J. Frisch S.M. Goodman R.H. Cell. 2003; 115: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The HIPK2 phosphorylation site on CtBP might also be recognized by other kinases. We have raised a phospho-specific antibody to follow CtBP modification at Ser-422 in response to UV irradiation (19Zhang Q. Nottke A. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2802-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and other stimuli. This reagent allowed us to screen additional signaling pathways that stimulate Ser-422 phosphorylation and regulate CtBP stability. The mitogen-activated protein kinase family member c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) plays important roles in triggering apoptosis in response to cellular stresses such as UV irradiation and cytokines (20Chen Y.R.

In this study, we found that JNK1 can phosphorylate Ser-422 of CtBP and triggers CtBP degradation. Both UV irradiation and cisplatin induced sustained JNK activation and decreased CtBP levels. This pathway promotes p53-independent apoptosis in tumor cells, suggesting a novel possibility for cancer therapy by targeting JNK1-mediated CtBP degradation. Plasmids—pcDNA3-MKK7-JNK1 was from R. Davis (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA). FLAG-CtBP and PET24bCtBP were described previously (16Zhang Q. Yoshimatsu Y. Hildebrand J. Frisch S.M. Goodman R.H. Cell. 2003; 115: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The CtBP S422A mutation was created by QuikChange™ mutagenesis. Proteins—Bacterially purified JNK1 and p38 were activated by their specific upstream kinases (immobilized for easy separation). His-CtBP (both wild type and S422A mutant) was expressed in strain BL21(DE3) and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography (Qiagen). Cell Culture and Transfection—Cos 7, H1299, wild-type, and JNK1-null MEFs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The spectral characterization of the UV-B source and the mode of the irradiation of cells with UV-B have been described previously (24Iordanov M.S. Magun B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25801-25806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cisplatin, TNFα, and proteasome inhibitor MG-132 were from Sigma, R&D Systems, and Calbiochem, respectively. Cells were transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cell morphology and the condensed nuclei by Hoechst staining were examined by light and fluorescence microscopy, respectively. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Recombinant CtBP and activated JNK1 and p38 were incubated in kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 μCi of [γ-P32]ATP) for 20 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding 15 μl of 5× sample buffer, and the samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. The phosphorylated CtBP was analyzed from dried gels with a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Western Blotting—The CtBP levels were assayed by Western blotting with a CtBP antibody. The CtBP signal was quantified by densitometry at the linear range of the standard curve and expressed as arbitrary units. Results from three independent experiments were presented as mean ± S.D. The anti-phospho Ser-422 antibody was described before (19Zhang Q. Nottke A. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2802-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The apoptotic response was assayed by Hoechst dye to monitor apoptosis-associated chromatin condensation or by Western blotting using antibodies to the active forms of caspase-3 (Cell Signaling). Antibodies to α-tubulin and to phospho-JNK and phospho-c-Jun were from Sigma and Cell Signaling, respectively. Previously, we have demonstrated that HIPK2 activation causes Ser-422 phosphorylation and degradation of CtBP (16Zhang Q. Yoshimatsu Y. Hildebrand J. Frisch S.M. Goodman R.H. Cell. 2003; 115: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To elucidate the role of other stress-induced signal pathways in CtBP regulation, we screened stress-activated MAP kinases JNK1 and p38 using an in vitro phosphorylation assay. Bacterially purified JNK1 and p38 were activated by their specific upstream kinases (MKK7 and MKK3, respectively) and incubated with [32P]ATP in the presence of recombinant CtBP protein. Maltose-binding protein was used as positive control for the activities of these kinases. CtBP is specifically phosphorylated by JNK1 but not p38 (Fig. 1A). JNK1 prefers Ser/Thr residues surrounded by prolines. Ser-422 of CtBP is flanked by two prolines. To test whether JNK1-mediated CtBP phosphorylation is specific to Ser-422, recombinant CtBP mutant (S422A) was tested by the in vitro phosphorylation assay. No phosphorylation signal was detected with S422A mutant (Fig. 1A), suggesting Ser-422 is the specific target of JNK1. To test whether JNK1 activation contributes to CtBP Ser-422 phosphorylation in vivo, we co-expressed the constitutively activated JNK1 and CtBP in Cos 7 cells. The active JNK is a fusion of JNK1 and MKK7 and causes constitutive JNK1 activation in cells without stimulation (25Lei K. Nimnual A. Zong W.X. Kennedy N.J. Flavell R.A. Thompson C.B. Bar-Sagi D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 4929-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Our previous study showed that Ser-422 phosphorylation is a transient event preceding CtBP clearance (19Zhang Q. Nottke A. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2802-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assayed CtBP phosphorylation on Ser-422 16 h after the transfection. MKK7-JNK1 expression caused robust Ser-422 phosphorylation on CtBP in Cos 7 cells (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the expression of the constitutively active JNK1 also strongly stimulated Ser-422 phosphorylation on CtBP in human lung cancer cells lacking p53 (Fig. 1C), suggesting a potential link between cellular stress signals and CtBP regulation in human cancer cells. Ser-422 phosphorylation of CtBP has been demonstrated to trigger the proteasomal degradation (19Zhang Q. Nottke A. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2802-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); thus, we asked whether activation of the JNK1 pathway induces CtBP degradation. MKK7-JNK1 expression in Cos 7 cells decreased FLAG-CtBP levels (Fig. 2A). Next, we asked whether the decrease in CtBP levels can be inhibited by proteasomal blockage. MKK7-JNK1-transfected cells were treated overnight with 2.5 μm MG-132, a specific proteasome inhibitor, and their CtBP levels were assayed by Western blotting (Fig. 2B). The basal CtBP level was higher in the presence of MG-132, consistent with our previous finding that CtBP is actively turned over even at nonstimulated conditions (19Zhang Q. Nottke A. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2802-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The MG-132 treatment largely attenuated the CtBP decrease induced by MKK7-JNK1 (Fig. 2B), suggesting that JNK1 activation triggers CtBP degradation through the proteasomal pathway. The expression of the active JNK1 in human lung cancer H1299 cells also decreased endogenous levels of CtBP (Fig. 2C). The evidence from both Cos 7 cell and H1299 cells suggests that JNK1 activation triggers CtBP degradation. JNK is a stress-induced kinase responding to stimuli, including UV irradiation and chemotherapeutic drugs. We monitored JNK activation over time in H1299 cells and found that UV-B (2000 J/m2) caused sustained JNK activation for up to 6 h (Fig. 3A). UV irradiation concomitantly decreased CtBP levels. To test whether the JNK1 pathway is involved in the UV-induced CtBP response, we made use of the JNK1-null MEFs immortalized with human papilloma viral E6 and E7 proteins (26Iordanov M.S. Wong J. Newton D.L. Rybak S.M. Bright R.K. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 4: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). CtBP level decreased following UV irradiation in the wild-type MEFs, whereas JNK1 knock out prevented UV-triggered CtBP degradation (Fig. 3B), suggesting that JNK1 is an important mediator for CtBP degradation in response to UV irradiation. In addition to UV irradiation, JNK has been shown to be activated by either TNFα or chemotherapeutic drugs such as cisplatin (22Mansouri A. Ridgway L.D. Korapati A.L. Zhang Q. Tian L. Wang Y. Siddik Z.H. Mills G.B. Claret F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19245-19256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). To test whether CtBP is responsive to these stimuli, H1299 cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml TNFα or 1 μg/ml cisplatin. TNFα caused a transient activation of the JNK signal pathway, whereas a prolonged activation of JNK was observed after cisplatin treatment (up to 6 h) (Fig. 4A). CtBP degradation was only observed in cells with sustained JNK activation by cisplatin but not transient JNK activation by TNFα. This effect was partially blocked by JNK1 knock out (Fig. 4B), suggesting that sustained JNK activation is required for CtBP degradation. Previously, we have shown that CtBP degradation triggers apoptosis (16Zhang Q. Yoshimatsu Y. Hildebrand J. Frisch S.M. Goodman R.H. Cell. 2003; 115: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We asked whether JNK1 activation in tumor cells would lead to cell death as well. H1299 cells were transfected with MKK7-JNK1, and 2 days later the cells were stained with Hoechst dye to monitor apoptosis-associated chromatin condensation (Fig. 5A). MKK7-JNK1 increased apoptosis in p53-null H1299 cells. One hundred cells from three random fields were counted. The numbers of condensed nuclei are 6.3 ± 1.0 for the control versus 39.3 ± 4.0 for the MKK7-JNK1-transfected cells. To further evaluate the involvement of CtBP degradation in JNK1-induced apoptosis, we introduced either the wild-type CtBP or the non-phosphorylatable S422A mutant of CtBP to H1299 cells and checked whether it would prevent the apoptosis triggered by JNK1 activation. MKK7-JNK1-induced apoptosis of H1299 cells was measured by either the cleavage of caspase 3 (Fig. 5B, left panel) or the appearance of the condensed nuclei (Fig. 5B, right panel). As expected, the non-phosphorylatable CtBP mutant is more resistant to degradation induced by MKK7-JNK1 (Fig. 5B, left panel). Co-transfecting the H1299 cells with S422A CtBP mutant significantly rescued apoptosis triggered by JNK1 activation (Fig. 5B), highlighting the apoptotic function of the JNK1-CtBP pathway in human cancer cells lacking p53. Multiple pro- and anti-apoptotic molecules act in concert to regulate commitment to apoptosis in cells; the balance between survival and death can be tipped by the effects of single molecules such as the stress-induced p53 protein. It has been proposed that agents targeted toward p53 may be useful therapeutically for cancer. While half of the human cancers have lost the functional p53 apoptotic pathway, the search for p53-independent tumor cell death has attracted major efforts in the cancer research field. Isolation of the cellular binding partners of the viral transforming oncoprotein E1A has identified CtBP as a key regulator that coordinately regulates the expression of multiple apoptosis control genes independent of p53 (27Bergman L.M. Blaydes J.P. Apoptosis. 2006; 11: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The finding that CtBP levels can be down-regulated by JNK1 could have implications for many transcriptional pathways that lead to cell death. Despite the clear indications that CtBP is critical for embryonic development and cellular transformation, little is known about CtBP regulation. Kagey et al. (15Kagey M.H. Melhuish T.A. Wotton D. Cell. 2003; 113: 127-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) recently reported that CtBP was sumoylated on lysine 428 via the actions of PC2, a polycomb group protein. Sumoylation is believed to be important for targeting transcription factors to specific subnuclear domains, and it is possible that this modification could contribute to the regulation of CtBP function. The fact that CtBP is a phosphoprotein points to another possible mode of regulation. Our previous studies indicate that the nuclear serine/threonine kinase HIPK2 phosphorylates CtBP at Ser-422 and directs CtBP toward degradation, inducing cell death through a p53-independent mechanism (16Zhang Q. Yoshimatsu Y. Hildebrand J. Frisch S.M. Goodman R.H. Cell. 2003; 115: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 19Zhang Q. Nottke A. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2802-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Here, we present evidence that activation of JNK1 triggers a similar mode of CtBP regulation. JNK1 is a well known stress-induced kinase that participates in the apoptotic response. Tumor cells are frequently deficient in functional p53 but can still undergo apoptosis in response to chemotherapeutic drugs. Our results suggest that CtBP depletion mediated through JNK1 could contribute to apoptosis in this setting. JNK1 plays important roles in triggering apoptosis in response to cellular stresses such as UV irradiation and cytokines. JNK1 is activated through phosphorylation by MKK4 and MKK7, which convey upstream stress signals. Simultaneous disruption of the Mkk4 and Mkk7 genes in mice is required to block JNK activation caused by exposure of cells to environmental stress (28Tournier C. Dong C. Turner T.K. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1419-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Although it has been well established that JNK activation is involved in stress-triggered apoptosis, the mechanism by which JNK activation triggers apoptosis remains largely unknown. Our data demonstrate that JNK1 activation directs the anti-apoptotic co-repressor CtBP to clearance, thus contributing to cell death in tumor cells. The loss of JNK expression results in substantial increases in the number and size of tumor nodules in vivo (29Kennedy N.J. Sluss H.K. Jones S.N. Bar-Sagi D. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Complementation assays demonstrated that this phenotype is caused by JNK deficiency. Therefore, JNK may suppress tumor development by contributing to the apoptotic elimination of transformed cells (29Kennedy N.J. Sluss H.K. Jones S.N. Bar-Sagi D. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This conclusion is consistent with the presence in human tumors of loss-of-function mutations in the JNK pathway (30Kennedy N.J. Davis R.J. Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 199-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mkk4 is mutated in human pancreatic, lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer (31Kim H.L. Vander Griend D.J. Yang X. Benson D.A.

It will be interesting to monitor CtBP levels in human tumors associated with loss-of-function mutations in the JNK pathway. The clearance of CtBP induced by MKK7-JNK1 is blocked by the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132, suggesting that JNK1 directs the co-repressor CtBP to the proteasome machinery. We demonstrated that this process depends upon JNK1 phosphorylation of CtBP at Ser-422. This residue is flanked by prolines. Ser-422 phosphorylation of CtBP seems to mark CtBP for proteasomal degradation. Both JNK1 and HIPK2 activation induced Ser-422 phosphorylation and CtBP degradation. Previously, HIPK2 has been shown to be activated by UV irradiation (17D'Orazi G. Cecchinelli B. Bruno T. Manni I. Higashimoto Y. Saito S. Gostissa M. Coen S. Marchetti A. Del Sal G. Piaggio G. Fanciulli M. Appella E. Soddu S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 18Hofmann T.G. Moller A. Sirma H. Zentgraf H. Taya Y. Droge W. Will H. Schmitz M.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) and thus lead to CtBP regulation (16Zhang Q. Yoshimatsu Y. Hildebrand J. Frisch S.M. Goodman R.H. Cell. 2003; 115: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Interestingly, JNK1 knock out inhibited UV-triggered CtBP degradation, pointing to the potential link between these two kinases. In fact, HIPK2 has been demonstrated to activate the JNK pathway in hepatoma cells (41Hofmann T.G. Stollberg N. Schmitz M.L. Will H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8271-8277PubMed Google Scholar). Further study is needed to address the possible cross-talk between HIPK2 and JNK1 in CtBP regulation and define the molecular nature of their functional connection. Whether these kinases directly phosphorylate Ser-422 in vivo and whether phosphorylation at Ser-422 affects other modifications of CtBP remains unknown. The ability of JNK1 to regulate CtBP levels is consistent with the finding that CtBP levels are reduced after UV exposure or cisplatin treatment. Involvement of JNK1 in these responses was supported by studies using the JNK1-null cells. Our study shows that CtBP degradation is triggered by sustained JNK activation by either UV irradiation or cisplatin, whereas transient JNK activation by TNFα failed to decrease CtBP levels. This is interesting given that tumor cell derivatives that lack sustained JNK activation are resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs (42Mansouri A. Zhang Q. Ridgway L.D. Tian L. Claret F.X. Oncol. Res. 2003; 13: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Relatively little is known about the regulation of transcriptional co-activators and co-repressors by intracellular signaling pathways. As opposed to modifications of specific DNA binding factors, phosphorylation of co-regulators has the potential to influence a large number of transcriptional programs. Our study demonstrated that Ser-422 on CtBP can be recognized by the stress-induced kinases. Conceivably, activation of one of these signaling pathways could be utilized therapeutically to down-regulate CtBP and block the ability of factors such as Evi-1 to mediate cell transformation. Alternatively, because E-cadherin and other cell adhesion genes are up-regulated by CtBP ablation, it is possible that manipulation of CtBP levels could be used to decrease the propensity of certain tumors to metastasize. Further characterization of the signal pathways of CtBP degradation and the downstream targets of CtBP is needed to enhance our understanding of transcription regulation in response to cellular stress. It may also provide therapeutic strategies and targets in cancer therapy, particularly in treating cancer with mutant p53. We thank R. Davis for providing the JNK1-related constructs and R. H. Goodman, Y. Liu, and X.-J. Wang for helpful comments."
https://openalex.org/W1982551629,"In order to define genetic determinants of primary and metastatic melanoma cell susceptibility to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), we have applied oligonucleotide microarrays to TRAIL-sensitive primary T1 cells and TRAIL-resistant metastatic G1 cells treated or not with TRAIL. T1 and G1 cells are isogenic melanoma cell subclones. We examined 22 000 spots, 4.2% of which displayed differential expression in G1 and T1 cells. Cell susceptibility to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis was found to be correlated with gene expression signatures in this model. Some of the differentially expressed genes were identified as involved in ATP-binding and signaling pathways, based on previously published data. Further analysis provided evidences that c-kit was overexpressed in G1 cells while it was absent in T1 cells. The c-kit inhibitor, imatinib, did not restore TRAIL sensitivity, excluding a role for c-kit in TRAIL resistance in G1 cells. Surprisingly, imatinib inhibited cell proliferation and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in melanoma cells. We investigated the possible involvement of several molecules, including c-ABL, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), cellular FADD-like interleukin-1 alpha-converting enzyme-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIP)(L/S), Fas-associated DD kinase, p53, p21(WAF1), proteins of B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family and cytochrome c. Imatinib did not modulate the expression or activation of its own targets, such as c-ABL, PDGFRalpha and PDGFRbeta, but it did affect the expression of c-FLIP(L), BCL2-associated X protein (Bax) and Bcl-2. Moreover, c-FLIP(L) knockdown sensitized T1 cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, with a sensitivity similar to that of cells previously treated with imatinib. More notably, we found that the resistance to TRAIL in G1 cells was correlated with constitutive c-FLIP(L) recruitment to the DISC and the inhibition of caspase 8, 3 and 9 processing. Moreover, c-FLIP(L) knockdown partly restored TRAIL sensitivity in G1 cells, indicating that the expression level of c-FLIP(L) and its interaction with TRAIL receptor2 play a crucial role in determining TRAIL resistance in metastatic melanoma cells. Our results also show that imatinib enhances TRAIL-induced cell death independently of BH3-interacting domain death agonist translocation, in a process involving the Bax:Bcl-X(L) ratio, Bax:Bcl-X(L)/Bcl-2 translocation, cytochrome c release and caspase activation. Our data indicate that imatinib sensitizes T1 cells by directly downregulating c-FLIP(L), with the use of an alternative pathway for antitumor activity, because PDGFRalpha is not activated in T1 cells and these cells do not express c-kit, c-ABL or PDGFRbeta. Caspase cascade activation and mitochondria also play a key role in the imatinib-mediated sensitization of melanoma cells to the proapoptotic action of TRAIL."
https://openalex.org/W2080217327,"The carcinogenicity of nickel compounds has been well documented both in vitro and in vivo; however, the molecular mechanisms by which nickel compounds cause cancers are far from understood. Because suppression of apoptosis is thought to contribute to carcinogenesis, we investigated the mechanisms implicated in nickel-induced anti-apoptotic effect in human bronchial epithelial (Beas-2B) cells. We found that exposure of Beas-2B cells to nickel compounds resulted in increased cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and that small interfering RNA (siCOX-2) knockdown of COX-2 expression resulted in increased cell sensitivity to nickel-triggered cell apoptosis, demonstrating that COX-2 induction has an anti-apoptotic effect on Beas-2B cells. Overexpression of IKKβ-KM, a kinase inactive mutant of IKKβ, blocked NF-κB activation and COX-2 induction by nickel compounds, indicating that activated NF-κB may be a mediator for COX-2 induction. To further explore the contribution of the NF-κB pathway in COX-2 induction and in protection from nickel exposure, mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in IKKβ, IKKα, p65, and p50 were analyzed. Loss of IKKβ impaired COX-2 induction by nickel exposure, whereas knockout of IKKα had a marginal effect. Moreover, the NF-κB p65, and not the p50 subunit, was critical for nickel-induced COX-2 expression. In addition, a deficiency of IKKβ or p65 rendered cells more sensitive to nickel-induced apoptosis as compared with those in wild type cells. Finally, it was shown that reactive oxygen species H2O2 were involved in both NF-κB activation and COX-2 expression. Collectively, our results demonstrate that COX-2 induction by nickel compounds occurs via an IKKβ/p65 NF-κB-dependent but IKKα- and p50-independent pathway and plays a crucial role in antagonizing nickel-induced cell apoptosis in Beas-2B cells.

To block IKK/NF-κB pathway activation, IKKβ-KM expressing plasmid was used to transfect Beas2B cells and WT cells together with NF-κB gene reporter plasmid or COX-2 gene reporter plasmid. Stable transfection was performed with Lipofectamine reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. After co-transfection with hygromycin B-resistant plasmid, cells were subjected to hygromycin B drug selection to generate stable transfectants. The stable transfectants were identified by analyzing basal luciferase activity or FLAG tag overexpression. IKKβ–/– MEFs and IKKα–/– MEFs were kind gifts from Dr. Zheng-Gang Liu (NCI, Bethesda, MD) and Dr. Michael Karin (University of California at San Diego). p50–/– MEFs and p65–/– MEFs were isolated from p50–/– or p65–/– mice and provided by Dr. Jianping Ye (Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge). All MEFs and their transfectants were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Gene Reporter Assays—Confluent monolayers of stable luciferase reporter transfectants were trypsinized, and 8×103 viable cells suspended in 100 μl of 10% FBS/DMEM were added to each well of 96-well plates. Plates were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. After cell density reached 80–90%, the cells were treated with nickel compounds for different time periods as indicated. Cells were then lysed with 50 μl of lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was measured using a Promega assay reagent with a luminometer (Wallac 1420 Victor2 multiple counter system). The results are expressed as NF-κB activation relative to the control medium (NF-κB activity) or COX-2 induction relative to control medium (relative COX-2 induction). Student's t test was used to determine the significance of the differences, and the differences were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. Western Blot Assay—2×105 cells were cultured in each well of 6-well plates to 70–80% confluence. The culture medium was replaced with 0.1% FBS/DMEM. After being cultured for 24 h, the cells were exposed to nickel compounds. The cells were then washed once with ice-cold PBS and extracted with SDS-sample buffer. The cell extracts were separated on polyacrylamide-SDS gels, transferred, and probed with a rabbit-specific antibody against target protein. The protein band, specifically bound to the primary antibody, was detected using an anti-rabbit IgG-AP-linked antibody and an ECF Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences). Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—Total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNAs were synthesized with ThermoScript™ RT-PCR system (Invitrogen). For detection of COX-2 expression, a pair of oligonucleotides (5′-tgaaacccactccaaacaca-3′ and 5′-aactgatgcgtgaagtgctg-3′) were designed according to human COX-2 gene sequence. The human β-actin cDNA was amplified at the same time by the primers 5′-gcgagaagatgacccagatcat-3′ and 5′-gctcaggaggagcaatgatctt-3′. Cell Death Assay—Beas-2B cells treated with nickel compounds were collected by pooling the cells from the culture medium as well as the trypsinized adherent cells. Dead cells were counted by the trypan blue exclusion method and flow cytometric analysis following propidium iodide staining of the nuclei. Briefly, the cells were fixed in ice-cold 80% ethanol at –20 °C overnight. The fixed cells were permeabilized in buffer containing 100 mm sodium citrate/0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 15 min as well as RNase A (0.2 mg/ml) (Sigma) for 10 min, stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) at 4 °C for at least 1 h, and then analyzed using the Epics XL FACS (Beckman-Coulter, Miami, FL) as described in our previous publication (3Sivulka D.J. Regul. Toxicol. Pharmacol. 2005; 43: 117-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 17Ouyang W. Ma Q. Li J. Zhang D. Liu Z.-G. Rustgi A.K. Huang C. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9287-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). H2O2 Staining Assay—Beas-2B transfectants were seeded (2 × 104) into each well of a 96-well plate. After cell density reached 80–90%, the cells were washed thoroughly with PBS and incubated with dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) at 10 μm in PBS (stock concentration is 10 mm in Me2SO) for 20 min. Cells were then washed with PBS to remove the dye completely and exposed to UVC radiation (60 J/m2). The cells were incubated at 37 °C for another 10 min, and the oxidative product was detected by using an HTS7000 Bio-Assay reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with excitation 488 nm and emission 530 nm. The results were expressed as relative H2O2 production compared with the cells without exposure to UVC radiation. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear proteins were prepared with a Cellytic™ NuCLEAR™ extraction kit (Sigma) following the manufacturer's protocols. 5 μg of nuclear protein was subjected to a gel shift assay by incubating it with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) DNA carrier in DNA-binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20% glycerol) in a final volume of 10 μl on ice for 10 min. Then, 105 cpm (108 cpm/μg) of the 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (2 μl) was added, and the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. For competition experiments, a 20-fold molar excess amount of the unlabeled oligonucleotide was added before the addition of the probe. For the super-gel shift assay, nuclear extracts were incubated with 2 μg of either rabbit IgG or the rabbit anti-p65 antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C before addition of the probe. DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis in 5% nondenaturing glycerol/polyacrylamide gels. The synthetic oligonucleotides (5′ to 3′) used as probe binding to NF-κB was GAGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC. Nickel Exposure Rendered Beas-2B Cells Resistant to the Pro-apoptotic Effects by Induction of COX-2—Previous studies have demonstrated that environmental and occupational exposure to nickel compounds is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (3Sivulka D.J. Regul. Toxicol. Pharmacol. 2005; 43: 117-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Epidemiological evidence also indicates that COX-2 is constitutively overexpressed in most human lung cancers (18Riedl K. Krysan K. Pold M. Dalwadi H. Heuze-Vourc'h N. Dohadwala M. Liu M. Cui X.

Chem. 2001; 276: 40769-40777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, it was of interest to investigate the potential contributions of elevated COX-2 protein in response to nickel-caused biological effects and their mechanisms. We first sought to determine whether nickel compounds induce COX-2 expression in human bronchial epithelial cells. As shown in Fig. 1, a and b, treatment of Beas-2B cells with water-soluble NiCl2 or water-insoluble NiS led to marked increases of COX-2 transcription as monitored using a COX-2-luciferase reporter. The nickel-dependent induction of COX-2 was both dose- and time-dependent. RT-PCR and Western blotting confirmed that endogenous COX-2 levels are also nickel-responsive (Fig. 1, c and d). These results verified that nickel exposure led to an increase in the COX-2 mRNA and protein expression in Beas-2B cells. To evaluate the role of nickel-dependent COX-2 production in cell survival, specific human COX-2 siRNA (siCOX-2) was used decrease COX-2 level. Stable transfection of siCOX-2 led to an almost complete block of COX-2 expression in response to nickel exposure, whereas control siRNA had no effect (Fig. 1e). Knockdown of COX-2 protein expression by siCOX-2 resulted in significant increases in the sensitivity of Beas-2B cells to nickel-triggered cell death (Fig. 1f). Analysis of apoptosis using either propidium iodide staining (to evaluate hypodiploid DNA content) or caspase-3 or PARP cleavage demonstrated loss of COX-2 nickel-induced cell death (Fig. 1, g and h). These results show that COX-2 is responsible for preventing cell death in the presence of nickel. Activation of IKK/NF-κB Pathway Is Required for COX-2 Induction by Nickel Compounds in Beas-2B Cells—The COX-2 promoter region contains several NF-κB binding sites thought to be involved in the regulation of its expression (21Yoon J.M. Lim J.-J. Yoo C.-G. Lee C.-T. Bang Y.-J. Han S.K. Shim Y.-S. Kim Y.W. Lung Cancer. 2005; 48: 201-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 22Weng M.-W. Hsiao Y.-M. Chen C.-J. Wang J.-P. Chen W.-C. Ko J.-L. Toxicol. Lett. (Amst.). 2004; 151: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, we next evaluated the role of NF-κB in nickel-induced COX-2 expression in Beas-2B cells. NF-κB is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm as an inactive form bound to the I-κBα inhibitor. NF-κB activation requires the phosphorylation I-κBα by I-κB kinase (IKK) leading to I-κBα degradation and subsequent release and nuclear translocation of NF-κB, where it regulates the transcription of its target genes (23Karin M. Greten F.R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (2546) Google Scholar, 24Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that exposure to nickel leads to an increase in IKK phosphorylation, IκBα phosphorylation, and degradation (Fig. 2, a and b). In turn, this results in NF-κB transactivation (Fig. 2, c and d) in Beas-2B cells, consistent with our previous finding that nickel exposure may lead to NF-κB activation (25Huang Y. Davidson G. Li J. Yan Y. Chen F. Costa M. Chen L. Huang C. Environ. Health Perspec. 2002; 110: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, analysis of NF-κB binding activity using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay indicated (Fig. 2e) that NiCl2 treatment enhanced binding in a dose-dependent manner that was abolished in the presence of a 20-fold excess of unlabeled probe. The specificity of this binding was further confirmed in the supergel shift assay with antibody specific for the p65 subunit of NF-κB (Fig. 2e). NF-κB activation in the time course studies reached a peak at 24 h after exposure to nickel, which occurred earlier than the COX-2 induction, suggesting that NF-κB may play a role in COX-2 induction in response to nickel. To determine the role of IKK/NF-κB pathway in COX-2 induction, an inactive mutant of IKKβ, IKKβ-KM, was utilized to establish stable Beas-2B transfectants. Fig. 3a confirmed the overexpession IKKβ-KM using FLAG-tagged analysis. Overexpression of IKKβ-KM in Beas-2B cells significantly blocked IκBα phosphorylation and degradation in response to nickel compounds (Fig. 3, b and c). Furthermore, overexpression of IKKβ-KM impaired NF-κB transactivation (Fig. 3, d and e). Consistent with the blockage of IKK/NF-κB pathway activation, nickel-induced COX-2 expression was also blocked (Fig. 3f). Collectively, these data indicate that the IKK/NF-κB pathway plays an important role in COX-2 induction by nickel compounds. IKKβ, but Not IKKα, Plays a Major Role in COX-2 Induction by Nickel Compounds—To provide direct evidence for the requirement for the IKK/NF-κB pathway in nickel-induced COX-2 expression, we used several IKK/NF-κB gene knockout cell lines (MEFs). Similar to the results obtained with Beas-2B cells, COX-2 transcriptional induction by nickel exposure was significantly increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner in the WT MEFs (Fig. 4, a–c). Activation of the IKK/NF-κB pathway in WT MEFs was also demonstrated (Fig. 4, d–g). Furthermore, NF-κB activation preceded COX-2 induction. Overexpression of IKKβ-KM in WT MEFs (Fig. 4h) not only impaired I-κBα phosphorylation and degradation (Fig. 4i) but also blocked COX-2 protein expression induced by nickel compounds (Fig. 4j). The IKK complex consists of two highly homologous kinase subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a nonenzymatic regulatory component, IKKγ/NEMO (26Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). It has been established that two NF-κB activation pathways exist (27Luo J.-L. Kamata H. Karin M. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2625-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The first, the classical pathway, is normally triggered in response to microbial and viral infections or by exposure to proinflammatory cytokines that activate the tripartite IKK complex, leading to phosphorylation-mediated I-κBα degradation. This pathway, which mostly targets p50·RelA and p50·c-Rel dimers, depends mainly on IKKβ activity (28Li L. Steinauer K.K. Dirks A.J. Husbeck B. Gibbs I. Knox S.J. Radiat. Res. 2003; 160: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The second alternative pathway leads to selective activation of p52·RelB dimers by inducing the processing of the NF-κB2/p100 precursor protein, which heterodimerizes with Rel B in the cytoplasm (29Li Z.-W. Chu W. Hu Y. Delhase M. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1839-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). This pathway is triggered by certain members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) cytokine family through selective activation of IKKα homodimers by the upstream kinase NIK (30Viatour P. Merville M.-P. Bours V. Chariot A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 43-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). We next addressed the role of these two pathways in NF-κB-mediated COX-2 induction by nickel exposure, by transfecting NF-κB- and COX-2-luciferase reporter transfectants into WT, IKKβ–/–, and IKKα–/– MEFs. As shown in Fig. 5, a–e, compared with WT MEFs, both NF-κB activity and COX-2 transcription was dramatically impaired in IKKβ–/– MEFs in response to nickel compounds. However, only a marginally inhibitory effect was observed in IKKα–/– MEFs, suggesting that IKKβ is a major mediator for COX-2 induction by nickel compounds. To further confirm this finding, IKKβ expression plasmid was used to transfect IKKβ–/– MEFs (Fig. 5f). As shown in Fig. 5g, reconstituted expression of IKKβ in IKKβ–/– MEFs restored the COX-2 induction by nickel compounds, demonstrating that IKKβ is required for nickel-induced COX-2 expression. These findings indicate that nickel-induced NF-κB activation is via the classical IKKβ/NF-κB pathway, which, in turn, mediates COX-2 expression.FIGURE 5IKKβ, but not IKKα, was the major mediator for COX-2 induction by nickel compounds. IKKα–/– and IKKβ–/– were identified as compared with WT MEFs using Western blot with specific antibodies as indicated (a) or an NF-κB-luciferase reporter stable transfection assay (b). Western blot was carried out as described under “Materials and Methods.” An NF-κB activity assay was performed 24 h after cells were exposed to nickel compounds. For COX-2 reporter assay (c and d), 8 × 103 WT COX-2 mass1, IKKα–/– COX-2 mass1, and IKKβ–/– COX-2 mass1 cells were seeded separately into each well of a 96-well plate. After being cultured at 37 °C overnight, the cells were treated with NiCl2 or NiS at the indicated dosage for 48 h. The cells were then extracted with lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was measured (c and d). For detection COX-2 protein expression, 2 × 105 WT, IKKα–/–, IKKβ–/–, or IKKβ–/– (HA-IKKβ) cells were seeded into each well of 6-well plates and cultured in 10% FBS/DMEM at 37 °C. When cell density reached 70–80%, the culture medium was replaced with 0.1% FBS/DMEM. After being cultured for 24 h, cells were exposed to nickel compounds for 48 h. The cells were then extracted with sample buffer, and Western blot was carried out (e–g).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) p65NF-κB, but Not p50NF-κB, Is Critical for COX-2 Induction by Nickel Compounds—NF-κB is a homo- or heterodimer formed from a multigene family that encodes five structurally related proteins: p50 (NF-κB1), p52 (NF-κB2), p65 (RelA), c-Rel (Rel), and RelB. p50 and p65 are the two predominant NF-κB components expressed in a variety of cell types (23Karin M. Greten F.R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (2546) Google Scholar, 24Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). It has been documented that p50 and p65 have different roles in regulating NF-κB transcriptional activities and mediates different biological effects of the IKKβ/NF-κB signaling pathway under certain stimulatory conditions (31Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar, 32Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). To further clarify the roles of p50 and p65 in nickel-induced COX-2 expression, MEFs from p50 and p65 gene knock-out mice were utilized. Genetic ablation of the expression of these two proteins was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 6a). We found that genetic ablation of p50 did not affect the nickel-dependent COX-2 induction (Fig. 6b), whereas COX-2 induction was impaired in p65–/– MEFs (Fig. 6, c and d). Furthermore, reconstituted expression of p65 in p65–/– MEFs increased the basal level of COX-2 protein expression and restored COX-2 induction in response to nickel exposure, demonstrating the critical role of p65NF-κB in nickel-induced COX-2 expression. Taken together, these findings show that nickel induction of COX-2 expression occurs through a specific IKKβ/p65 NF-κB-dependent pathway. IKKβ and p65NF-κB, and Not IKKα or p50, Mediate the Anti-apoptotic Effects of Nickel Exposure—Analysis of cell death in the IKKβ or p65-deficient MEF demonstrated an increased sensitivity to nickel-induced cell death when compared with the WT control cells. Furthermore, neither the IKKα–/–-nor p50–/–-deficient MEFs showed cell death under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 7, a, b, d, and e). These data are consistent with siCOX-2 studies in Beas-2B cells showing increased sensitivity to nickel-induced cell death. Furthermore, the results from measurement of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP demonstrated that nickel-induced cell death in IKKβ–/– or p65–/– MEFs is likely attributable to enhanced apoptotic cell death (Figs. 7c and 1f). Taken together, our results demonstrate that the induction of COX-2 via the IKKβ/p65/NF-κB-dependent pathway renders cells resistant to nickel-induced apoptosis. Activation of NF-κB upon Nickel Exposure Is Mediated through Hydrogen Peroxide—Because nickel exposure can activate the IKKβ/p65NF-κB pathway and elevate COX-2 protein expression, we chose to evaluate the mechanism linking nickel stimulation and NF-κB activation. Our previous studies demonstrated that nickel could induce H2O2 generation, which is required for the activation of NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cell) in PW cells (33Huang C. Li J. Costa M. Zhang Z. Leonard S.S. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. Ju G. Shi X. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8051-8057PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated the contribution of H2O2 to the regulation of nickel-dependent NF-κB activation and COX-2 expression. We used a mitochondrial targeted catalase expression (pZeoSV/mCAT) to directly detoxify H2O2 at its primary site of production. As shown in Fig. 8a, the expression of catalase in Beas-2B/mCAT mass2 was increased when compared with Beas-2B/vector control cells. Catalase overexpression efficiently abrogated the generation of H2O2 when compared with that of Beas-2B/vector control cells (Fig. 8b). Furthermore, both the phosphorylation of IκBα and the expression of COX-2 (Fig. 8, c and d) was diminished in response to nickel exposure in the Beas-2B/mCAT mass2 cells when compared with the control cells. These results indicate that H2O2 mediates the activation NF-κB and the subsequent induction of COX-2 expression in response to nickel. Although epidemiological studies have demonstrated that exposure to nickel is associated with increased risk of human lung cancer, the mechanism involved in the carcinogenic effects of nic"

The absence of NDST1 or NDST2 in the knock-out mice did not affect transcript levels of other NDST isoforms or other HS modification enzymes. Although the sulfation level of HS synthesized in NDST1–/– mice was drastically lowered, liver HS from wild-type mice, from NDST1+/–, NDST2–/–, and NDST1+/–/NDST2–/– mice all had the same structure despite greatly reduced NDST enzyme activity (30% of control levels in NDST1+/–/NDST2–/– embryonic day 18.5 embryos).

The first modifying event is the N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (NDST) reaction, where N-acetyl groups of selected GlcNAc residues are removed and replaced by sulfate groups (10Grobe K. Ledin J. Ringvall M. Holmborn K. Forsberg E. Esko J.D. Kjellen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). N-Sulfated glucosamine (GlcNS) units are typically found in contiguous stretches (NS domains) separated by non-modified N-acetylated regions (NA domains). Often, regions of alternating GlcNS and GlcNAc units (NA/NS domains) surround the NS domains (11Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). After N-sulfation, the C5 epimerase converts most GlcA residues within the NS domain and many GlcA residues in the NA/NS domain to iduronic acid (IdoA). Sulfation of the 2-O position on IdoA residues is carried out by the 2-O-sulfotransferase and occurs almost exclusively in NS domains (12Rong J. Habuchi H. Kimata K. Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5548-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast, GlcN 6-O-sulfation occurs both in NS and in NA/NS domains (13Smeds E. Habuchi H. Do A.T. Hjertson E. Grundberg H. Kimata K. Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 371-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Four mammalian NDST isoforms have been recognized (NDST1–4) (10Grobe K. Ledin J. Ringvall M. Holmborn K. Forsberg E. Esko J.D. Kjellen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). On the transcript level, NDST1 and NDST2 are widely expressed (10Grobe K. Ledin J. Ringvall M. Holmborn K. Forsberg E. Esko J.D. Kjellen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, recent results demonstrate that the expression of the NDSTs may be largely translationally controlled (14Grobe K. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30699-30706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and little data on NDST protein expression are so far available. It is not known how different patterns of NA and NS domains are created. We have previously shown that overexpression of NDST1 and NDST2 in HEK293 cells results in an increased N-sulfation of HS produced by the cells (15Pikas D.S. Eriksson I. Kjellen L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4552-4558Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The level of N-sulfation was higher in cells transfected with NDST2 (80%) than with NDST1 (60%), indicating that the N-sulfation pattern may be, to some extent, isoform-dependent. Tentatively, altering the relative numbers/concentrations of the various NDST isoforms in a cell could result in distinct N-sulfation patterns. When it comes to downstream HS modification patterns, a large part of these can be explained by substrate specificity of the enzymes (4Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The C5 epimerase requires a GlcNS residue on its non-reducing side, whereas 2-O-sulfotransferase needs a contiguous (IdoA-GlcNS)n structure for substrate recognition. For the three known 6-O-sulfotransferases (6-O-sulfotransferase-1–3), all positions in the close vicinity of a GlcNS residue constitute acceptable substrates (13Smeds E. Habuchi H. Do A.T. Hjertson E. Grundberg H. Kimata K. Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 371-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 6-O-sulfation can even occur in the absence of N-sulfation (16Holmborn K. Ledin J. Smeds E. Eriksson I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42355-42358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, not all potential sites are modified, creating the great diversity in HS structure. How this “lack of modification” is regulated is not known.As mentioned, the NDST2 transcript is widely expressed in both mice and humans (17Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Pikas D.S. Kjellen L. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5876-5882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Despite its abundance in most tissues, no alteration in HS structure has been found in mice with a targeted mutation in this gene (19Ledin J. Staatz W. Li J.P. Gotte M. Selleck S. Kjellen L. Spillmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42732-42741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Heparin biosynthesis in connective tissue-type mast cells is, however, severely disturbed, resulting in a non-sulfated polysaccharide and abnormal morphology of the cells (20Forsberg E. Pejler G. Ringvall M. Lunderius C. Tomasini-Johansson B. Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Ledin J. Hellman L. Kjellen L. Nature. 1999; 400: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). In contrast, lack of NDST1 affects HS structure in all tissues analyzed, with a dramatic reduction in sulfation of the polysaccharide (21Ringvall M. Ledin J. Holmborn K. van Kuppevelt T. Ellin F. Eriksson I. Olofsson A.M. Kjellen L. Forsberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25926-25930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The lack of obvious liver phenotype in NDST-1–/– as well as in NDST-2–/– mice has provided us with a unique in vivo system to elucidate the roles of the different NDST isoforms in HS biosynthesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMice—Mice deficient in NDST1 and NDST2, respectively, were generated as previously described (20Forsberg E. Pejler G. Ringvall M. Lunderius C. Tomasini-Johansson B. Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Ledin J. Hellman L. Kjellen L.

The NDST1+/–NDST2–/– mice were obtained by crossing NDST2–/– and NDST1 heterozygous mice.Genotyping—DNA, extracted from tail biopsies, was used as the template for genotyping by PCR. The following primers were used: forward NDST1 primer, 5′-GGCTGGTTCGGTGTCTTTTG-3′; reverse wild-type NDST1 primer, 5′-CGGTTCCAGGCATCCAGGTT-3′; forward NDST2 primer, 5′-CCTGGCTGTTTGGTCTCTGT-3′; reverse wild-type NDST2 primer, 5′-CGCTTTCAATACAGGAGAGG-3′; reverse NDST1/NDST2 knock-out primer (located in the neomycin cassette) 5′-CTGCTCTTTACTGAAGGCTC-3′.Immunofluorescence—Cryosections from embryonic day 18.5 embryos were produced as previously described (21Ringvall M. Ledin J. Holmborn K. van Kuppevelt T. Ellin F. Eriksson I. Olofsson A.M. Kjellen L. Forsberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25926-25930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Tissue sections were stained with antibodies against perlecan (22Schulze B. Mann K. Battistutta R. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (23Vecchi A. Garlanda C. Lampugnani M.G. Resnati M. Matteucci C. Stoppacciaro A. Schnurch H. Risau W. Ruco L. Mantovani A. Dejana E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 63: 247-254PubMed Google Scholar). For perlecan, tissue sections were rehydrated for 15 min in PBS, blocked with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min, and incubated with primary antibody diluted 1:200 in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The secondary antibody used for detection, Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), was diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer. After each incubation, sections were washed 3× for 5 min in PBS. For MEC13.3, tissue sections were fixed in acetone for 2 min at –20 °C, dried, and then washed 2× for 5 min in PBS, blocked with 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, and incubated with undiluted MEC13.3 primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The MEC13.3 primary antibody was detected by Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (H + L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), as described above.RNA Purification and Northern Hybridization—Total RNA was isolated with the RNeasy midikit (Qiagen) from adult liver of one NDST2–/– and one control mouse, from one embryonic day 13.5 control embryo, and from 3–4 pooled embryonic day 18.5 livers from NDST1–/–, NDST2–/–, and control mice. mRNA was purified with the Oligotex minikit (Qiagen). 10 μg of each mRNA sample was separated and transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The following cDNA probes with the translation start codon defined as nt 1–3 were radioactively labeled with the Strip-EZ-Kit (Ambion); mNDST1, nt 1–435 (AF074926); mNDST2, nt –157 to 780 (X75885); mNDST3, 1-kb fragment starting with nt 1959 (AF221095); mNDST4, nt –97 to 459 (AB036838); bovine C5 epimerase, nt 1028–1851(AF 003927); m2-O-sulfotransferase, nt 112–544 (AF169243); m6-O-sulfotransferase1, nt 114–945 AB024566); m6-O-sulfotransferase2, nt 1–1520 (AB024565); and m6-O-sulfotransferase3, nt 1175–1523 (AB024567). The filter was hybridized with the 32P-labeled probe at a concentration of 1 × 107 counts/min/ml for 15 h at 42 °C using UltraHyb (Ambion) and then washed according to the Northern Max kit (Ambion) recommendations. The filter was exposed to film (Fuji) for 1–4 days at –70 °C. Radioactive bands were also detected with phosphor screens (Fujifilm, BAS-2500), and the relative amounts of radioactivity in the mRNA bands were determined with the program Image Gauge version 3.3 (Fujifilm Science Laboratory). The 32P-labeled probe was removed before the next hybridization with the Strip-EZ kit (Ambion) according to the manual.Metabolic Labeling of Liver Glycosaminoglycans—Embryonic day 18.5 embryos were collected from pregnant mice injected intraperitoneal with 250 μCi [3H]GlcN (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) 2 h prior to decapitation. The embryonic livers were dissected out and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Embryos from heterozygous crossings were genotyped, and livers from five embryos of the same genotype were pooled. Livers from adult mice were dissected out 2 h after intraperitoneal injection of 250 μCi [3H]GlcN and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.Isolation of 3H-Labeled Liver Heparan Sulfate—Liver tissue (from 3–5 embryonic day 18.5 embryos) was homogenized in 4 ml of 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8, 1% Triton X-100 and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was collected, adjusted to 0.10 m with regard to NaCl, and applied to a 1.4-ml column of DEAE-Sephacel (Pharmacia Corp.), equilibrated with 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.10 m NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The column was first washed with equilibration buffer and subsequently with 0.05 m acetate buffer, pH 4.0, containing 0.10 m NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100. The proteoglycans were eluted with 0.05 m acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2 m NaCl followed by digestion with papain as described previously (24Cheung W.F. Eriksson I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindhal U. Kjellen L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5250-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). After desalting in water on PD10 columns (Amersham Biosciences) followed by lyophilization, the 3H-labeled glycosaminoglycans were subjected to digestion with 0.1 unit of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku) as described previously (24Cheung W.F. Eriksson I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindhal U. Kjellen L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5250-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The resulting 3H-labeled HS chains were recovered in the void volume after gel filtration on a column (100 × 0.5 cm) of Sephadex G-50 (superfine grade; Amersham Biosciences) in 0.2 m NH4HCO3.Structural Analysis of 3H-Labeled HS—For N-sulfation, isolated 3H-labeled HS was cleaved at N-sulfated GlcN residues by deamination at pH 1.5 (25Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The resulting 3H-labeled oligosaccharides were separated by gel chromatography on a column (1 × 140 cm) of Bio-Gel P-10 (fine grade; Bio-Rad) eluted in 0.2 m NH4HCO3. Estimation of the percentage of GlcN residues carrying N-sulfate groups was made using weighted integration of the oligosaccharide peak areas.For total disaccharide composition, isolated 3H-labeled HS was chemically N-deacetylated by hydrazinolysis for 5 h followed by combined deamination at pH 1.5 and 3.9 (26Riesenfeld J. Hozok M. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7050-7055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and reduction with NaBH4. The resultant disaccharides, containing terminal anhydromannitol residues, were recovered by gel filtration on a column (1 × 180 cm) of Sephadex G-15 (Amersham Biosciences) in 0.2 m NH4HCO3. The disaccharides were characterized by anion exchange chromatography on a Partisil-10 SAX column (Whatman, Inc.) eluted with a stepwise gradient of KH2PO4 (27Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relative amounts of GlcA-anhydromannitol and IdoA-anhydromannitol were analyzed by descending paper chromatography on Whatman No. 1MM paper in ethyl acetate:acetic acid:H2O (3:1:1). The samples were checked for labeled impurities by paper high voltage electrophoresis (5Safaiyan F. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10823-10830Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Structural Analysis of HS by Reverse Phase Ion Pair (RPIP) HPLC—Unlabeled HS was purified from liver of the control and NDST1+/–NDST2–/– adult mice and embryonic day 18.5 embryos, respectively, as previously described (19Ledin J. Staatz W. Li J.P. Gotte M. Selleck S. Kjellen L. Spillmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42732-42741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The isolated polysaccharide was degraded to disaccharides by enzymatic cleavage. The generated HS disaccharides were subjected to RPIP-HPLC analysis followed by post-column derivatization with cyanoacetamide and detection in a fluorescence detector as described previously (19Ledin J. Staatz W. Li J.P. Gotte M. Selleck S. Kjellen L. Spillmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42732-42741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).NDST2 Antibodies—Antibodies recognizing the cytoplasmic tail of NDST2 were generated in rabbits by injecting the peptide MLQLWKVVRPARQLELHRL conjugated to keyhole limpet hemacyanin. The antibodies recognized NDST2 as a distinct protein band in lysates of NDST2-expressing HEK293 cells (clone S2; (24Cheung W.F. Eriksson I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindhal U. Kjellen L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5250-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)), whereas no detectable signal was observed in lysates of cells transfected with empty vector or overexpressing NDST1 (mock-transfected clone K6 and NDST1-expressing clone 11; (15Pikas D.S. Eriksson I. Kjellen L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4552-4558Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)).Enzyme Assays—Liver tissue from embryonic day 18.5 embryos (≈30 mg) was homogenized and solubilized for 1 h at 4°Cin10× the volume 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.15 m NaCl containing protease inhibitors (2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Pefablock, 10 mg/ml pepstatin). After centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 revolutions/min, the supernatants were collected and protein content was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Aliquots of the supernatants were then incubated for 1 h at 4°C with antiserum (10%) recognizing the cytoplasmic tail of NDST2 (see above). After the addition of Protein A-Sepharose and another hour of incubation at 4 °C, the samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 2000 revolutions/min, followed by washing of the Sepharose beads (twice with Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 and twice with N-deacetylase assay buffer (50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.3, 10 mm MnCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 μg/ml polybrene). N-Deacetylase activity in the liver extracts and in antibody-captured NDST2, respectively, was then determined as described previously (28Pettersson I. Kusche M. Unger E. Wlad H. Nylund L. Lindahl U. Kjellen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8044-8049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pilot experiments had established that NDST2 antibodies were present in excess and that the enzyme activities were measured under linear conditions. Enzyme activity in liver tissue (50 mg) from six adult NDST2–/– and six control mice was determined in triplicate essentially as described above on extract corresponding to 0.250 mg of protein. Statistical differences were determined by Student's t test.RESULTSWe have previously demonstrated a structural alteration of HS in most basement membranes of NDST1–/– embryos using HS-recognizing phage display antibodies (21Ringvall M. Ledin J. Holmborn K. van Kuppevelt T. Ellin F. Eriksson I. Olofsson A.M. Kjellen L. Forsberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25926-25930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, judged from the staining of liver sections from embryonic day 18.5 NDST-1+/+ and NDST-1–/– embryos with antibodies against perlecan and nidogen, the altered HS structure does not affect basement membrane distribution in the liver (data not shown). Furthermore, staining with the endothelial marker platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 and von Willebrand factor demonstrated no obvious changes in endothelial structures or in the number of megakaryocytes as a result of NDST1 or NDST2 deficiency (data not shown). We conclude that neither NDST-1–/– nor NDST-2–/– mice display any obvious liver phenotype and that this has provided us with a unique in vivo system to elucidate the roles of the different NDST isoforms in HS biosynthesis.Does Ablation of One NDST Gene Influence Transcription of Other NDST Genes?—To investigate whether deficiency of NDST2 would lead to increased transcription of NDST1, -3, or -4 and whether the lack of NDST1 influenced NDST2 transcription, Northern blots were performed. Liver mRNA from NDST1–/–, NDST2–/–, and control mice were blotted to nylon membranes and hybridized with radioactive NDST probes (Fig. 1A). No transcriptional up-regulation of NDST1 could be seen in liver from NDST2–/– adult mice or embryonic day 18.5 embryos. Likewise, the level of NDST2 expression was the same in wild-type and NDST1-deficient embryonic day 18.5 embryos. It has previously been shown, using reverse transcription-PCR, that no NDST3 or NDST4 is expressed in adult mouse liver (18Aikawa J. Grobe K. Tsujimoto M. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5876-5882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This result was confirmed (Fig. 1A), and it could be demonstrated also that embryonic day 18.5 embryonic liver of all tested genotypes lacked expression of these NDST isoforms. Thus, no up-regulation of any of the NDSTs occurred as a response to the loss of either NDST1 or NDST2. Expression levels of the O-sulfotransferases and the C5 epimerase also appeared to be unaltered (Fig. 1B), although the expression levels of 6-O-sulfotransferase-3 was difficult to judge due to hybridization of the probe with multiple transcripts. However, the difference in labeling intensity of the same transcript in control and knock-out mice never exceeded 30% (as determined by phosphorimaging).NDST2 Can Synthesize HS-like Structures—Because NDST1 is the only isoform expressed in NDST2–/– liver, whereas NDST1–/– liver only contains NDST2, a detailed picture of the sulfation properties of each of the enzymes could be achieved by determining HS structure in the two knock-out strains. Previous structural characterization of HS isolated from NDST1–/– embryonic liver, brain, and lung have shown that both N- and O-sulfation are reduced when NDST1 is knocked out (19Ledin J. Staatz W. Li J.P. Gotte M. Selleck S. Kjellen L. Spillmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42732-42741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In that study, total HS was isolated and analyzed by RPIP-HPLC. If instead, newly synthesized metabolically [3H]GlcN-labeled HS is analyzed, the possible contribution of NDST3 and NDST4 to N-sulfation of any HS present in NDST1–/– liver at the time of analysis but synthesized earlier during development can be avoided. 3H-Labeled liver HS was therefore isolated from embryonic day 18.5 embryos (originating from heterozygous crossings) 2 h after injection of their mother with [3H]GlcN. Information regarding the amounts and distribution of N-sulfate groups was obtained by cleaving the polysaccharide at N-sulfated glucosamine units with nitrous acid at pH 1.5 followed by gel chromatography on Biogel P10. Metabolically 3H-labeled liver HS from embryonic day 18.5 NDST-1–/– and wild-type embryos contained 17 and 45% N-sulfate groups, respectively (Fig. 2A). Because all N-sulfate groups in the NDST1–/– HS sample are a result of NDST2 activity, the HNO2 cleavage pattern shows that NDST2 is capable of synthesizing HS-like structures, including both NS domains (present as disaccharides in Fig. 2A) and NA/NS domains (present as tetrasaccharides). Furthermore, as judged by the large proportion of material eluting in the void volume (and hence devoid of N-sulfate groups), NDST2 has acted on a restricted part of the polysaccharide. The corresponding experiment with NDST2–/– embryonic day 18.5 embryos (data not shown) and adult mice (Fig. 2B) shows that the N-sulfation performed by NDST1 alone is identical to that in control animals. Samples of liver HS from embryonic day 18.5 NDST-1+/– were similar to control mice (data not shown), demonstrating that one gene copy of NDST1 is sufficient to attain normal HS N-sulfation.FIGURE 2N-Sulfation of liver HS from NDST1-deficient and control embryonic day 18.5 embryos (A) and adult NDST2-deficient and control mice (B).

This process starts with the specific recognition of an antigen by T cell receptors and the subsequent generation of diacylglycerol and 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate (InsP3). In terms of Ca2+ signaling, InsP3 produces a biphasic response, due to a brief initial release of Ca2+ from InsP3-sensitive stores and a sustained Ca2+ entry through plasma membrane channels activated by the emptying of those stores. This latter phenomenon originally termed capacitative Ca2+ entry occurs through store-operated Ca2+ channels responsible for a highly selective Ca2+ current known as ICRAC (Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current) (1Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). At present, ICRAC has been found in multiple cell types including T cells where it serves as the principal Ca2+ entry pathway (2Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar, 3Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Ca2+ ions themselves modulate the time course of ICRAC by several mechanisms: a fast inactivation process occurring in milliseconds (4Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) and a slower inactivation process operating in the range of seconds, which comprises both a store-dependent component due to the refilling of stores and a Ca2+-dependent but store-independent component (5Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14445-14451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Hence, any organelle and transport systems that regulate [Ca2+]c could, in principle, also modulate CRAC channel activity. In this context, the regulatory actions of mitochondria on Ca2+ entry were first proposed by Lewis and coworkers in the late 1990s (6Hoth M. Fanger C.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 633-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). These authors proved that Jurkat T cell mitochondria were able to reduce Ca2+-mediated inhibition of store-operated CRAC channels by sequestering Ca2+ ions entering through those channels (6Hoth M. Fanger C.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 633-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 7Hoth M. Button D.C. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10607-10612Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Since then, these results have been extended to other cell types where mitochondria located close to the plasma membrane have been involved in such a Ca2+-buffering effect (8Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 757-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). However, recent evidence supports the idea that mitochondria may also regulate ICRAC by some mechanism distinct from direct buffering of Ca2+, such as the release of one or more factors (e.g. glutamate or ATP) (8Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 757-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar, 9Glitsch M.D. Bakowski D. Parekh A.B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6744-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 10Makowska A. Zablocki K. Duszynski J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 11Parekh A.B. News Physiol. Sci. 2003; 18: 252-256PubMed Google Scholar), although there is no direct evidence yet. CRAC current is generally measured in the presence of strong intracellular Ca2+ buffers (EGTA or BAPTA at mm concentrations) in order to decrease both store refilling and the other components of Ca2+-dependent inactivation of the channels. Under these conditions, a supramaximal concentration of InsP3 activates ICRAC to its maximal extent. However, in the presence of weak intracellular Ca2+ buffering (0.1 mm EGTA or BAPTA), InsP3 is largely ineffective for activating ICRAC despite releasing Ca2+ from the stores. Only when store refilling is prevented by using inhibitors of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) pump (e.g. thapsigargin) (12Bakowski D. Parekh A.B. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 561-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or mitochondria are metabolically potentiated with a mixture or cocktail containing respiratory substrates, ICRAC can be measured in cells dialyzed with low concentration of Ca2+ buffers (13Gilabert J.A. Parekh A.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6401-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the presence of a high concentration of aCa2+ buffer, InsP3, and thapsigargin, global [Ca2+]c changes are not expected to occur and Ca2+ regulatory actions would be restricted to zones in the proximity of sustained sources of Ca2+ ions, like the CRAC channels. Our working hypothesis is that mitochondria may act as a complex Ca2+-buffering system. The influx of Ca2+ ions into the mitochondrial matrix is dependent on the electrochemical gradient for Ca2+, which is maintained by the aerobic respiration. In turn, three rate-limiting dehydrogenases (pyruvate, NAD+-isocitrate, and 2-oxoglutarate) of the tricarboxylic acid cycle are stimulated by the increase in mitochondrial [Ca2+], so that in the presence of metabolic substrates an enhanced production of ATP takes place (14Jouaville L.S. Pinton P. Bastianutto C. Rutter G.A. Rizzuto R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13807-13812Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). ATP produced through oxidative phosphorylation may then serve not only to fuel ATP-dependent processes but also as an effective Ca2+ buffer once transferred to the cytosol. In this study we have evaluated the ability of Ca2+ microdomains generated beneath the plasma membrane by Ca2+ influx through CRAC channels to modulate ICRAC in Jurkat T cells. We have also investigated the involvement of subplasmalemmal mitochondria in the regulation of such Ca2+ microdomains and, therefore, of ICRAC characteristics. Our results indicate that energized mitochondria regulate slow Ca2+-dependent inactivation of ICRAC by increasing subplasmalemmal Ca2+-buffering capacity mainly through a localized ATP production. Cell Culture—Human leukemic Jurkat T cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, and penicillinstreptomycin (100 units/ml and 0.1 mg/ml, respectively) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The glucose content of the culture medium was 11.1 mm. Electrophysiology—ICRAC was measured using the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique at room temperature. Wax-coated and fire-polished borosilicate Kimax-51© glass pipettes had DC resistances of 2.5–3.5 MΩ when filled with a standard internal solution containing (mm): 145 Cs·glutamate, 8 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 Mg·ATP, 0.03 InsP3, 0.002 thapsigargin, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.2/CsOH. The Ca2+ chelators EGTA or BAPTA were included in the recording pipette at 10 mm each so that free ATP concentrations (calculated using the MaxChelator WEBMAXC Standard program, available at www.stanford.edu/~cpatton) were 0.23 and 0.22 mm, respectively at pH 7.2, 20 °C, 0.16 N ionic strength and 3 mm total Mg2+. The supplement of mitochondrial metabolites referred to as mitochondrial mixture contained (mm): 2 pyruvic acid, 2 malic acid, and 1 NaH2PO4. The extracellular solution contained (mm) 145 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 10 CaCl2, 10 CsCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 d-glucose and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4/NaOH. ICRAC was measured during voltage ramps applied every 2 s. Currents were amplified and filtered with an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA Elektronik). A correction of +10 mV was applied to compensate for the liquid junction potential. Cell membrane capacitance was automatically canceled before each ramp. Series resistance values were usually <10 mΩ and were not compensated for. The first or second current responses to ramps were taken as a measure of leak current and subtracted from all subsequent traces. A cell was considered as an inactivating one when ICRAC amplitude decayed by >10% at steady state (5 min after breaking-in) with respect to its maximum. Flow Cytometry Analysis—Jurkat T cells (2.5–5 × 105 cells/ml) were washed in fresh culture medium before being resuspended in the presence or absence of mitochondrial mixture and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were treated with antimycin plus oligomycin (A/O; both at 5 μg/ml) for 25 min at 37 °C. Cells were subsequently washed and incubated with 1 μm rhodamine 123 for 15 min at 37 °C before being analyzed with a FACSort™ flow cytometer. For JC-1 labeling, Jurkat T cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) were washed in fresh culture medium before being resuspended and incubated in a solution containing mitochondrial mixture in the presence or absence of oligomycin (5 μg/ml) for 25 min at 37 °C. The cells were treated with 2 μm JC-1 for 25 min at 37 °C and washed with phosphate-buffered saline just before the analysis in a FACSort™ flow cytometer. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. The statistical differences between means were assessed by unpaired or paired Student′s t tests using GraphPad Prism® v. 4.00 software. ns, not significant; *, p ≤0.05; **, p ≤0.01; ***, p ≤0.001. Effects of High Concentrations of Two Different Ca2+ Chelators on ICRAC—The normal procedure to maximally activate ICRAC is to provoke the depletion of InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores at the endoplasmic reticulum. To achieve this, a supramaximal concentration (30 μm) of InsP3 and thapsigargin (2 μm) was included in the internal solution. Furthermore, we decided to add high concentrations (10 mm) of two different Ca2+ buffers (EGTA or BAPTA) to this solution in an attempt to replace the buffering effect of mitochondria. EGTA and BAPTA have similar affinity for Ca+2 (KD = 1.8 × 10–7 and 2.2 × 10–7 m, respectively) but differ in the kinetics of Ca2+ binding in two orders of magnitude (kon = 2.5 × 106 and 4 × 108 m–1 s–1, respectively). In the presence of either EGTA or BAPTA, ICRAC exhibited its characteristic features when probed with a voltage ramp: an inwardly rectifying current-voltage relation with a positive reversal potential and a voltage-independent gating (Fig. 1A). The time course of ICRAC during long-term recordings was obtained from a series of voltage ramps (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 1B shows average values of ICRAC at –80 mV from cells dialyzed with EGTA (n = 12) or BAPTA (n = 17). Fig. 2 shows several parameters derived from the analysis of individual time courses. In the presence of either EGTA or BAPTA, no differences were observed in the amplitude or the activation kinetic parameters analyzed (time constant of activation, τon, and time to peak, tmax) (Fig. 2, panels A1–A3), making it unlikely that rapid changes in [Ca2+]c play a significant role in this process. On the contrary, marked differences were seen regarding ICRAC inactivation. First, the percentage of inactivating cells (45%; 8/17) was largely reduced in BAPTA as compared with that in EGTA (95%; 11/12) (Fig. 2, panel B1). Second, BAPTA also reduced the extent of inactivation (36.85 ± 6.12%) compared with EGTA (62.45 ± 6.75%) (Fig. 2, panel B2). On the contrary, no statistically significant differences were observed between EGTA and BAPTA data regarding the time constant of inactivation in the inactivating cells (τoff; see Fig. 2, panel B3). The present results suggest that the spatio-temporal profile of Ca2+ near CRAC channels determines both the amplitude and extent of the slow inactivation of ICRAC. Effects of Supported Mitochondrial Function on ICRAC—The mitochondria can be maintained in an energized metabolic state during whole-cell recordings by supplementing the internal solution with a mixture containing two respiratory substrates, pyruvate and malate, and NaH2PO4 (13Gilabert J.A. Parekh A.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6401-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 15Villalba M. Martinez-Serrano A. Gomez-Puertas P. Blanco P. Borner C. Villa A. Casado M. Gimenez C. Pereira R. Bogonez E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2468-2476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gilabert J.A. Bakowski D. Parekh A.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2672-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 17Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions and the presence of intracellular EGTA, the current-voltage profile and the amplitude as well as the activation kinetic parameters of ICRAC were similar to those observed in the presence of EGTA alone (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, panels A1–A3). However, the percentage of inactivating cells and the extent of their inactivation were significantly reduced compared with EGTA alone, exhibiting similar values to those obtained with BAPTA (Fig. 2, panels B1–B3). These results suggest that mitochondria act to reduce the inactivation of ICRAC by a mechanism similar to that employed by BAPTA. Furthermore, adding the mitochondrial mixture to a solution containing BAPTA resulted in 100% non-inactivating cells whose amplitude of current did not differ from that observed with BAPTA alone (data not shown). Modulatory Effects of Mixture on ICRAC Occurs at the Mitochondrial Level—We set out to prove the participation of mitochondria in the regulation of ICRAC using inhibitory drugs of mitochondrial respiration. For this purpose, cells were treated with antimycin A (A) (0.05 μg/ml), an inhibitor of the complex III respiratory chain in combination with oligomycin (O) (0.5 μg/ml), an inhibitor of F1FO-ATP synthase. The use of both drugs ultimately causes the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and loss of mitochondrial function. As was expected, the effects of the mitochondrial mixture on ICRAC inactivation were abolished in cells treated with A/O. Thus, in paired experiments, both the extent of slow inactivation of ICRAC (Fig. 3A) and the percentage of inactivating cells (83.33%; 5/6) increased to values similar to those obtained in cells dialyzed with EGTA alone (100%; 8/8). On the contrary, no significant differences were observed in cells dialyzed with BAPTA+A/O compared with those with BAPTA alone with regard to ICRAC inactivation (data not shown). These results confirm the ability of functional mitochondria to regulate Ca2+-dependent processes occurring at the submembrane level, such as ICRAC inactivation. The ability of pyruvate and malate to keep mitochondria in an energized state was also directly evaluated by using flow cytometry techniques in cells incubated with rhodamine 123. Rhodamine 123 is a potentiometric dye that crosses the plasma membrane easily and emits fluorescence after accumulating into mitochondria with a negative ΔΨm. As it is shown in Fig. 3B, the fluorescent signal associated to homogeneous and viable populations of Jurkat T cells increased when the cells were bathed in a solution containing the mitochondrial mixture, whereas it decreased when the cells were incubated with the mixture but in the presence of mitochondrial inhibitors (A/O). ATP Released from Mitochondria Regulates ICRAC Inactivation—The mitochondrial ability to regulate [Ca2+]c can be due to either Ca2+ uptake, to Ca2+ buffering by ATP produced by respiring mitochondria or to both processes. To clarify this point, the hexavalent cation ruthenium red (RR) (100 μm), an inhibitor of the mitochondrial uniporter, was added to the pipette's solution containing mixture also. RR caused a small increment in the extent of inactivation although it was not statistically significant (Fig. 4A). However, intracellular application of atractyloside (Atr) (20 μm), a potent inhibitor of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocase that exports ATP from mitochondria to cytosol, canceled out the effects of the mixture on ICRAC inactivation (Fig. 4A). No significant changes were observed when atractyloside and RR were applied together compared with those obtained with atractyloside alone. RR is a widely used inhibitor of the uniporter although it targets other membrane proteins (e.g. BK channels, ryanodine receptor, etc.). For this reason, we sought to reproduce the former results by using RU360, a more selective and potent blocker of the mitochondrial uniporter (18Kirichok Y. Krapivinsky G. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2004; 427: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). RU360 (1 μm) did not affect the extent of inactivation of ICRAC in cells dialyzed with an internal solution containing the mitochondrial mixture (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, besides its translocase function, mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocase is a constituent of the inner membrane multimeric channel known as the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Interestingly, mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocase can be inhibited by atractyloside and bongkrekic acid (BA) acting through opposite mechanisms; whereas Atr prevents binding of adenine nucleotides to carrier sites, BA prevents their dissociation from mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocase. Moreover, in contrast to BA, Atr has been reported to open the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (19Halestrap A.P. Davidson A.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), which could potentially cause a massive Ca2+ release and, hence, inactivation of ICRAC. Despite these differences between the two drugs, their effects on ICRAC inactivation were coincident, thus supporting a common action on the translocase function (Fig. 4B). Altogether, the results obtained with the different inhibitors of mitochondrial transporters (RR, RU360, Atr, and BA) suggest a predominant role of ATP export over the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake to regulate Ca2+-dependent inactivation of ICRAC under our experimental conditions. To further support this suggestion we decided to explore the effects of oligomycin on ICRAC inactivation. As has already been mentioned, oligomycin acts to halt ATP production, an effect that is not readily associated to an inhibition of Ca2+ uptake or even a change in ΔΨm (20Duchen M.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In accordance with the proposed role of mitochondrial ATP, the mixture of respiratory substrates was unable to reduce Ca2+-dependent inactivation of CRAC in cells exposed to oligomycin (5 μg/ml) (Fig. 5A). However, ΔΨm was not affected by the presence of oligomycin in Jurkat T cells stained with the cationic dye JC-1, a more specific and reliable mitochondrial versus plasma membrane potential probe than rhodamine 123 or DiOC6 (21Salvioli S. Ardizzoni A. Franceschi C. Cossarizza A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5B). To get direct evidence involving ATP in the regulation of ICRAC, intracellular solutions containing high concentrations (10 mm) of ATP as disodium (ATP·2Na) or magnesium (ATP·Mg) salts were dialyzed in two groups of cells. The difference between these two salts lies in their affinity for Ca2+ ions, ATP·2Na being a more effective Ca2+ chelator than ATP·Mg. As is shown in Fig. 6A, the rate of inactivation of ICRAC was significantly reduced when 10 mm ATP·2Na ([ATP] free = 9.05 mm) was included in the pipette's solution instead of ATP·Mg ([ATP] free = 0.92 mm). This result indicates that ATP·2Na can regulate the slow inactivation of ICRAC and suggests that endogenous ATP released from mitochondria may act in a similar way. To establish the relationship between the ATP·2Na concentration and the degree of inactivation, the free ATP concentration corresponding to different amounts of ATP·2Na added to the intracellular solution was represented against the percentage of inactivation in cells dialyzed with EGTA + A/O. As it is shown in Fig. 6B, the increase of ATP·2Na, and hence of free ATP concentration, was associated with a reduction in the percentage of ICRAC inactivation in a dose-dependent manner. Estimation of the Extent of Ca2+ Microdomains Generated by a Single CRAC Channel in the Presence of High Concentrations of Exogenous Ca2+ Chelators—To estimate the amplitude and spatial extent of Ca2+ microdomains generated by Ca2+ entry through a single CRAC channel under our recording conditions, we used PORE, a freeware application developed by Dr. James Kenyon, University of Nevada. PORE is an Excel spread-sheet with an attached Visual Basic Program that utilizes the equation proposed by Dr. Erwin Neher (22Neher E. Heinemann U. Klee M. Neher E. Singer W. Calcium Electrogenesis and Neuronal Functioning. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1986: 80-96Google Scholar). This equation predicts the Ca2+ gradient generated in the presence of high concentrations of a barely saturated and highly mobile exogenous chelator from the opening of a single channel. The extent of the gradient is a function of Ca2+ flux through the channel, the diffusion coefficient for Ca2+, and the Ca2+ binding rate for the chelator used as shown in Equation 1[[B]=[B]mathrm{→t}{⋅}Kmathrm{D}Kmathrm{D}+[mathrm{Ca}2+]{∞}](Eq. 1) where [Ca2+]c(r) is the steady state free Ca2+ concentration as a function of distance from the channel, [Ca2+]∞ is the free Ca2+ in the bulk solution (i.e. 10–7 m), F is the Faraday's constant, DCa is the diffusion coefficient for Ca2+ (2.2 × 10–6 cm2/s, (23Naraghi M. Neher E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6961-6973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), r is the distance from the channel, and λ is the mean path length of free Ca2+. As shown in Equation 2, λ can be expressed as[{λ}=Dmathrm{Ca}{/}(kmathrm{on}{⋅}[B])](Eq. 2) where kon is the on rate constant for binding of Ca2+ by the chelator (kon = 2.5 × 106 m–1 s–1 for EGTA, 4 × 108 m–1 s–1 for BAPTA, and 1 × 109 m–1 s–1 for ATP (23Naraghi M. Neher E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6961-6973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), and [B]isthe concentration of free buffer in the bulk solution. As shown in Equation 3, the free buffer concentration [B] is calculated according to[B]=[B]tot⋅KDKD+[Ca2+]∞(Eq. 3) where [B]tot is the concentration of total buffer (free plus bond; 10–2 m) and KD is the dissociation constant for the Ca2+ buffer complex (KD = 1.8 × 10–7 m for EGTA, 2.2 × 10–7 m for BAPTA, and 1.95 × 10–4 m for ATP). The current through CRAC channels is too small to be resolved at the single channel level under typical recording conditions. As a consequence, different indirect approaches like fluctuation analysis (3Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar) or single channel recording in divalent-free external solutions (24Kerschbaum H.H. Cahalan M.D. Science. 1999; 283: 836-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) have been used to estimate the unitary conductance and also the number of CRAC channels/cell. Moreover, other cationic conductances can contaminate CRAC current recordings in the absence of intracellular Mg2+. Therefore, Prakriya and Lewis (25Prakriya M. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 487-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) studied the biophysical properties of CRAC channels isolated from the Mg2+-sensitive component and estimated the unitary CRAC Ca2+ current (iCRAC) to be–3.8 fA in 20 mm external Ca2+ at –110 mV. Therefore, to study only the contribution of the different buffers in the shaping of the Ca2+ microdomains, the same unitary current was considered for the different experimental conditions assuming that open probability of a single CRAC channel is not affected for the different intracellular buffers employed. Our calculation assumes that standing gradients develop in microseconds after the opening of channels, provided that Ca2+ buffers do not saturate, a condition fulfilled in our experiments due to the small single unitary conductance of CRAC channels (a few fA) and the high concentration (10 mm) of intracellular exogenous buffers used. However, this model does not consider how channels are arranged in the plasma membrane (homogenously or forming clusters), which in the case of CRAC channels is currently unknown. Fig. 7 shows the profiles of Ca2+ microdomains near a single CRAC channel as a function of the distance to its mouth in the presence of three different Ca2+ buffers (EGTA, BAPTA, and ATP) at 10 mm. In the presence of EGTA an extended Ca2+ microdomain builds up around CRAC channels; interestingly, in the presence of BAPTA or ATP the spatial extension of this microdomain becomes markedly and similarly reduced and fully dissipates at distances beyond 50 nm from the channel. When using the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique and high concentrations of an exogenous Ca2+ buffer, InsP3, and thapsigargin in the intracellular solution, it is expected that after depletion of InsP3-sensitive stores the only regions experiencing abrupt changes in [Ca2+]c are those around the mouth of CRAC channels. Thus, our experimental conditions allow the study of Ca2+-dependent regulation of CRAC channels triggered by Ca2+ microdomains formed at the subplasmalemmal region. First, we evaluated the effects of high intracellular concentrations (10 mm) of two different Ca2+ chelators (EGTA or BAPTA) on CRAC currents. Because we were unable to observe any difference in the time course of activation of ICRAC comparing values calculated from cells dialyzed with EGTA or BAPTA, it is unlikely that rapid and very much localized changes in cytosolic Ca2+ play a significant role in this process. The functional state of mitochondria also seems not to contribute to activation of ICRAC, as respiratory substrates did not cause any effect on τon (Fig. 2, A panels). This conclusion agrees with previous results from RBL-1 cells in which mitochondrial depolarization with A/O in the presence of strong cytosolic buffering did not affect the activation of ICRAC (13Gilabert J.A. Parekh A.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6401-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In contrast, different results were observed when inactivation parameters were measured. BAPTA reduced both the rate and extent of inactivation and also the percentage of inactivating cells as compared with EGTA (Fig. 2, panels B1-B3). Interestingly, when the mitochondrial function was boosted with the mitochondrial mixture, respiring mitochondria could then regulate slow inactivation of ICRAC in cells dialyzed with EGTA in a manner similar to that observed with BAPTA. At variance with exogenous buffers, regulatory effects exerted by mitochondria on [Ca2+]c are very conditioned by their metabolic state and topological distribution with respect to sources of Ca2+ mobilization such as the plasma membrane or the endoplasmic reticulum (26Lawrie A.M. Rizzuto R. Pozzan T. Simpson A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10753-10759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The question then arises as to whether mitochondria are homogenous organelles in terms of their location and/or functional properties. Indeed, functional heterogeneity has been described in several types of cells regarding the Ca2+ signaling abilities of particular subsets of mitochondria (16Gilabert J.A. Bakowski D. Parekh A.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2672-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 27Collins T.J. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1616-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Collins et al. (27Collins T.J. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1616-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) found that mitochondria located in the vicinity of the plasma membrane have larger ΔΨm values and sequester more Ca2+ than those located around the nucleus. Likewise, the ability of subplasmalemmal mitochondria to modulate the activity of ion channels like large conductance Ca2+-dependent potassium channels (BKCa channels) or store-operated Ca2+ channels has been demonstrated in different cell types (28Malli R. Frieden M. Osibow K. Graier W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10807-10815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 29Park M.K. Ashby M.C. Erdemli G. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1863-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In a recent study, mitochondria from HeLa cells were relocalized from the cell periphery to the perinuclear area by overexpression of the dynactin subunit dynamitin, which causes inhibition of the fission factor, dynamin-related protein (Drp-1). As a consequence, the number of endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contacts increased and Ca2+ influx through store-operated Ca2+ channels was severely reduced, thus indicating a requirement of peripheral mitochondria for optimal store-operated Ca2+ activity (28Malli R. Frieden M. Osibow K. Graier W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10807-10815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 30Varadi A. Cirulli V. Rutter G.A. Cell Calcium. 2004; 36: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the inclusion of metabolic substrates like pyruvate and malate into the intracellular solution during whole-cell recordings is essential to maintain mitochondrial respiration and ATP production (15Villalba M. Martinez-Serrano A. Gomez-Puertas P. Blanco P. Borner C. Villa A. Casado M. Gimenez C. Pereira R. Bogonez E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2468-2476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria depends on the presence of micromolar levels of [Ca2+]m to induce the activation of three dehydrogenases of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Because mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter does not transport Ca2+ below a concentration of ∼200–300 nm (36Gunter T.E. Yule D.Y. Gunter K.K. Eliseev R.A. Salter J.D. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), we wanted to estimate how far a microdomain extends from a Ca2+ source (the CRAC channel) in the presence of high concentrations of a diversity of exogenous Ca2+ buffers. A rough estimation of how long Ca2+ ions can diffuse into the cell from the mouth of a CRAC channel before they bind to an exogenous buffer is given by the mean path length parameter, λ (see Equation 2). The value of λ is 95.5 nm in the presence of 10 mm of EGTA and 7.5 nm in the presence of 10 mm of BAPTA, which may explain the differences in ICRAC inactivation observed between the two chelators. Considering the small λ value estimated for BAPTA and the effectiveness of this buffer to reduce ICRAC inactivation, both a molecular colocalization between CRAC channels and mitochondria and a high density and velocity of the Ca2+ uniporter would be required to account for the observed mitochondrial modulation of ICRAC. From our experimental results, an alternative mechanistic explanation would consist of the release by mitochondria of a highly mobile and effective Ca2+ chelator able to raise high concentrations (several millimolar) near CRAC channels. Like BAPTA, ATP can act as a very effective Ca2+ chelator due to its rapid reaction with Ca2+ (kon of 1 × 109 m–1 s–1) (23Naraghi M. Neher E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6961-6973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in the presence of 10 mm added ATP·2Na in the intracellular solution, the spatial extension of a Ca2+ microdomain generated by Ca2+ influx through a single CRAC channel would be even narrower than that occurring when BAPTA is used (λ = 4.9 nm). Furthermore, according to the results obtained using uniporter and mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocase blockers (Fig. 4A) a plausible scenario could then be that ATP originated from peripheral mitochondria would shape spatially the Ca2+ microdomains generated by CRAC channels. This interpretation implies that ATP concentrations must be in the order of several millimolar in the microdomain region. It is now worth recalling that ATP microdomains of this size have been reported in pancreatic β-cells where they regulate the activity of ATP-sensitive K+ channels at the plasma membrane (31Kennedy H.J. Pouli A.E. Ainscow E.K. Jouaville L.S. Rizzuto R. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13281-13291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Recent data indicate that other Ca2+ transport systems could also be considered. This is the case of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA), whose activity is regulated by the Ca2+ microdomains generated by CRAC channels, suggesting a close functional association between both Ca2+ transport systems in T cells (32Bautista D.M. Lewis R.S. J. Physiol. 2004; 556: 805-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Because specific PMCA inhibitors do not exist, vanadate, a nonspecific inhibitor of ATPases and phosphatases, has been used in studies requiring the inhibition of PMCA (33Tiffert T. Lew V.L. Cell Calcium. 2001; 30: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To rule out a possible regulatory role of PMCA on ICRAC, we evaluated the effect of 0.1 mm vanadate (sodium orthovanadate) in cells dialyzed with 10 mm EGTA and mitochondrial mixture. No differences were observed in cells treated with vanadate compared with control cells regarding the amplitude or time course of ICRAC (data not shown). Thus, PMCA does not appear to play a predominant role in controlling slow Ca2+-dependent inactivation in Jurkat T cells under our particular experimental conditions. A similar cross-talk has been proposed to exist between CRAC channels and the plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) in mast cells (34Aneiros E. Philipp S. Lis A. Freichel M. Cavalie A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the relative contribution of these systems to the control of local [Ca2+] varies significantly with the experimental conditions used, the time window analyzed and the cell type under study. So, NCX does not appear to contribute significantly to Ca2+ clearance in Jurkat T cells (35Bautista D.M. Hoth M. Lewis R.S. J. Physiol. 2002; 541: 877-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), whereas the regulatory role of PMCA was established under conditions of low buffer capacity and unsupported mitochondrial metabolism. To sum up, our results show that ATP produced by subplasmalemmal mitochondria is a soluble messenger that regulates the Ca2+-dependent inactivation of CRAC channels in Jurkat T cells, supporting and refining the already existing notion of a functional relationship between CRAC channels and peripheral mitochondria.

Here, we showed using a yeast triple-hybrid experiment and in vitro binding assay that Annexin2 is required for strong binding of S100A10 to the C-terminal domain of the protein Ahnak. We also revealed that this effect involves only the Annexin2 N-terminal tail, which is implicated in S100A10/Annexin2 tetramerization. The minimal A2t binding motif (A2tBP1) in Ahnak was mapped to a 20-amino acid peptide, and this peptide is highly specific for A2t. We also identified a second A2t binding motif (A2tBP2) present in the N-terminal domain of Ahnak, which binds to A2t, albeit with less affinity. When overexpressed as an EGFP fusion protein in MDCK cells, A2tBPs cofractionate in a calcium-dependent manner and co-immunoprecipitate with S100A10 and Annexin2. In living cells, A2tBPs target EGFP to the cytoplasm as does Annexin2. In response to oxidative and mechanical stress, EGFP-A2tBPs relocalize within minutes to the plasma membrane; a behavior shared with Annexin2-GFP. These results suggest that the A2t complex exists within the cytoplasm of resting living cells and that its localization at the plasma membrane relies on cellular signaling. Together, our data demonstrate that A2tBP1 is a specific A2t complex binding domain and may be a powerful tool to help elucidate A2t structure and cellular functions.

Similar to other members of the family, S100A10 homodimerizes and was found inside the cell either as a homodimer or as a heterotetramer (A2t) 3The abbreviations used are: A2t, Annexin2 tetramer; A2tBP, A2t-binding peptide; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; DTT, dithiothreitol; mAb, monoclonal antibody; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. in which each of the two S100A10 subunits interacts with one Annexin2 molecule (for reviews see Refs. 22Gerke V.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2435-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), it is generally assumed that it is indeed the A2t complex that interacts with the different substrates. However, in most cases whether both components contribute to the A2t ability to bind substrates has not been investigated. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation experiments failed to detect Annexin2 in association with the complex S100A10/TASK1 (30Girard C. Tinel N. Terrenoire C. Romey G. Lazdunski M. Borsotto M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4439-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), suggesting that, at least for the S100A10 subunit, interaction with some targets occurs independently of the formation of the tetramer. Understanding the functions of the tetramer, as opposed to those of its two components, relies on the identification of substrates that specifically interact with the tetramer. In a previous study, we have identified the giant protein Ahnak as a binding partner of A2t. In epithelial cells, A2t recruits Ahnak to cholesterol-rich microdomains of the plasma membrane. This recruitment appears to be essential for the establishment of the proper cytoarchitecture of polarized columnar epithelial cells (33Benaud C. Gentil B.J. Assard N. Court M. Garin J. Delphin C. Baudier J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Ahnak is composed of an N-terminal 498-amino acid domain, a large central region of 4390 amino acids organized in 36 repeated units, and the C-terminal 1002 amino acids. We have shown that the S100A10 subunit mediates the interaction of A2t with the C-terminal domain of Ahnak (33Benaud C. Gentil B.J. Assard N. Court M. Garin J. Delphin C. Baudier J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have extended the molecular and functional characterization of the A2t/Ahnak interaction. We have shown that the C-terminal domain of Ahnak constitutes a highly specific substrate of A2t and does not bind significantly to S100A10 or Annexin2 individually. We have delineated the Annexin2 contribution in the A2t-Ahnak complex formation to its S100A10 binding site and have mapped down the A2t binding site in the Ahnak C-terminal domain to a 20-amino acid peptide (A2tBP1). We have shown that in vitro A2tBP1 binding to A2t is characterized by a high affinity and specificity. We have also demonstrated that EGFP-A2tBP1 expressed in MDCK cells co-fractionates and co-immunoprecipitates with S100A10 and Annexin2. Furthermore, we have shown, that through its specific binding, EGFP-A2tBP1 allows us to follow stress-induced relocalization of Annexin-2 in living cells. Thus, A2tBP1 is the first specific A2t complex binding motif, which might be a powerful tool to study the structure of A2t and to dissect functions strictly involving the complex A2t, not its individual subunits. Cell Culture—MDCK epithelial cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma Aldrich), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). For metabolic labeling, cells were labeled in methionine-free MEM, 5% fetal calf serum supplemented with [35S]Met/Cys mix (5 μCi/ml) for 4 days. Production of MDCK Stable Transformants—Annexin2-EGFP plasmid was a generous gift from Dr. Moss. EGFP-A2tBP1 and 2 were obtained by subcloning of the BamHI/XbaI A2tBP fragments from the pGEX-KG vector to pEGFP-C1 vector. Plasmids were purified using the Qiagen kit and used for transformation of MDCK cells with FuGENE6 transfection reagent following the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Transfected cells were selected and maintained in culture medium containing 0.6 mg/ml of geneticin. Because aminoglycoside antibiotics have been shown to bind to and interfere with phospholipid-dependent cellular functions (34Jones A.T. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25301-25309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), geneticin was removed from the culture medium at least a week before the experiment was performed. Cellular Fractionation and Immunoprecipitation—MDCK cells grown to confluence in 10-cm culture plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and collected in 0.5 ml of Buffer L (Tris-HCl 20 mm, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.3% Triton X-100 plus 10 μg of each protease inhibitor (AEBSF, leupeptin, aprotinin)) in the presence of 0.3 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA. Cells were passed through a 26-gauge needle and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were removed (S), and pellets (P) were resuspended by sonication in one volume of Buffer L. For Western blot analysis, 20 μl of each sample were separated by 11% Tris-Tricine polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, proteins were detected using anti-Annexin2 mAb, anti-S100A10 mAb (both Transduction Laboratories), and anti-EGFP pAb (AbCam, Paris, France). For immunoprecipitation, the calcium concentration of 100-μl samples was adjusted to 0.3 mm and incubated with 1.5 μg of anti-EGFP mAb (AbCam) for 1 h at 4°C. 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose were then added and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were spun down at 2000 × g, washed three times with buffer L, and resuspended in 100 μl of Laemmli buffer. Western blot analysis was carried out as described above. Purification of S100A10 and Annexin2—Native A2t was purified from porcine intestine as previously described (35Gerke V. Weber K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1688-1695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). S100A10 and Annexin2 were dissociated from the complex with 9 m urea. Each subunit was purified by gel filtration in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 9 m urea, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaN3 and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. Prior to the binding experiment, S100A10 and Annexin2 were renatured by dialyzing against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.3% Triton X-100, and 1 mm DTT. In Vitro Protein-Protein Interaction/GST Pull-down Assays— For production of GST fusion proteins, Ahnak C-ter cDNA was cloned into pGEX-KG (GE Health Care) as previously described (33Benaud C. Gentil B.J. Assard N. Court M. Garin J. Delphin C. Baudier J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Shorter Ahnak fragments were obtained either by deleting Ahnak-Cter by restriction digestion, blunting, and re-ligation or by PCR cloning. Detailed cloning information for specific GST-Ahnak fragment expression is available upon request. Numbering of Ahnak residues is from the human Ahnak sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM001620). The constructs were introduced in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS strain. Bacteria were grown to an A600 of 0.6-0.8 and treated with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2-3 h to induce protein expression. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Bacteria were lysed in buffer A (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT) complemented with 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (AEBSF, leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin 10 μg/ml each) through three cycles of freeze-thaw. The lysates were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatants were incubated in batch with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h. Beads were washed in batch three times with buffer A plus 1% Triton X-100 and 5 mm EDTA and then with ten bead volumes in column. The columns were equilibrated in buffer A, and the proteins were eluted in buffer A plus 30 mm glutathione. Fractions containing the proteins were pooled and extensively dialyzed against buffer A. Protein concentration was quantified on a Coomassie-stained acrylamide gel using bovine serum albumin as standard. Proteins in working aliquots were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. For the GST pull-down assay, 2 μg of recombinant protein were incubated for 1 h at 4°C with 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads and then washed in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.3% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 300 μm CaCl2). GST pull-down assays were carried out either with different combinations of purified proteins (2.7 μg of Annexin2, 0.8 μg of S100A10, 2 μg of native A2t, 5 μg of Annexin2 (1Gerke V. Creutz C.E.

For GST pull-down, cell extracts from confluent MDCK cells were prepared essentially as described for cell fractionation, and the supernatant of cells lysed in Buffer L in the presence of EGTA was used. After incubation for 1 h at 4°Cin a 300-μl final volume of buffer B, the beads were spun down at 2000 × g for 2 min, washed three times with 0.5 ml of buffer B, and boiled in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated on 11% Tris-Tricine acrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected by Western blot using the ECL kit. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Real-time binding experiments were performed on a BIAcore biosensor system (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden). All experiments were performed at 25 °C. Anti-GST antibodies in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 3.5), were coupled directly through their amino groups to the sensor (CM5) surface activated by N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide according to the manufacturer's instructions. The remaining reactive groups were then inactivated with 1 mm ethanolamine. GST or GST-A2tBP1 binding to the antibodies, and interaction experiments with native purified A2t were done in running buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.01% Triton X-100. Sensorgrams obtained with different concentrations of A2t (297, 595, and 1190 nm) were analyzed using the Kaleidagraph software. The association and dissociation curves were fitted with an equation model of one analyte (A2t) binding two heterogenous ligands (GST-A2tBP1). In Equation 1,R=Req1(1−e−ks1(t − to))+Req2(1−e−ks2(t − to)1 R is the response, subscript 1 and 2 refer to each of the two ligands, t is the time (s), ks = kaCn + kd where Cn is the concentration of the analyte, and Req is the steady state response level. The correlation coefficient of the fitting, close to 1 (between 0.99485 and 0.99996) indicated the quality of the fitting. A simple explanation for this model with two ligands is that once A2t, which is a large complex (94 kDa), is bound to one of the two A2tBP1 sites on the dimer (because of GST dimerization, Ref. 36Mikhailenko I.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6784-6791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) of GST-A2tBP1, the steric constraint perturbs the binding of another A2t to the second GST-A2tBP1 site. This is in agreement with the binding stoichiometry found at steady state (up to 1.5 A2t per GST-A2tBP1 dimer at the higher concentration of the analyte tested (1.19 μm)). For the evaluation of the Kd of A2t with AtBP1, only the high affinity responses were considered. Yeast Triple Hybrid—pLex-Ahnak-Cter and pAct2-S100A10 constructs were obtained as previously described (33Benaud C. Gentil B.J. Assard N. Court M. Garin J. Delphin C. Baudier J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). For expression of Annexin2 in yeast, a ΔlexA version of pEG202 vector was first obtained. For this purpose, the SphI-SphI fragment of pEG202 containing the lexA sequence was subcloned into a pGEMT vector, where the NotI-NotI fragment was previously deleted. The lexA sequence was then excised out by digesting with HindIII and EcoRI, blunting with Deep vent polymerase, and self-ligation. The ΔlexA SphI fragment was subcloned back into pEG202 at the SphI site. Annexin2 from pGEMTp36 (generous gift from Dr. Borsotto) was digested with and cloned into the NotI site of pEG202ΔlexA. Constructs in different combination as indicated in the figure legends were used to transform the AMR70 yeast strain. pAct2, pEG202ΔLexA, and pLex-lamin were used as control. Colonies were grown into the selective media (uracil-depleted YPD medium minus tryptophan (for pLex10), leucine (for pAct2), and histidine (for pEG202ΔlexA)). For β-galactosidase assays, the activity of three independent colonies from each transformation was measured in triplicate as previously described (37Deloulme J.C. Assard N. Mbele G.O. Mangin C. Kuwano R. Baudier J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35302-35310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In a former study, we had shown that S100A10 mediates the interaction between A2t and the C-terminal domain of Ahnak (Ahnak C-ter) (33Benaud C. Gentil B.J. Assard N. Court M. Garin J. Delphin C. Baudier J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, the implication of Annexin2 in this interaction has not been investigated. To test whether Annexin2 is also involved in the interaction with Ahnak-Cter, we carried out yeast triple-hybrid experiments with the three components of the A2t-Ahnak complex. Because the N-terminal extremity of Annexin2 is crucial for its tetramerization with S100A10, we chose not to use it as a fusion protein. Instead, we expressed Annexin2 as a free molecule in addition to LexA-Ahnak-Cter and Gal4-S100A10 (33Benaud C. Gentil B.J. Assard N. Court M. Garin J. Delphin C. Baudier J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). By doing so, it was possible to analyze in yeast the effect of Annexin2 on Ahnak-Cter/S100A10 interaction. The interactions between Ahnak-Cter and S100A10 were then assessed in a quantitative manner through measurement of β-galactosidase activity. Results presented in Fig. 1A show that a subtle but detectable interaction is observed between S100A10 and Ahnak-Cter when they are expressed in the absence of Annexin2. However, when Annexin2 is co-expressed with LexA-Ahnak-Cter and Gal4-S100A10, the specific activity is dramatically increased by a factor of more than 150. No effect was seen when Annexin2 was expressed alone or solely with LexA-Ahnak-Cter or Gal4-S100A10. These results indicate that in eukaryotic cells, the presence of Annexin2 and thus, most likely, the formation of the tetramer, is required for efficient S100A10 interaction with Ahnak-Cter. In this complex, the interaction between S100A10 and Ahnak-Cter would be strengthened by Annexin2 through either direct interaction of Annexin2 with Ahnak-Cter or by modulation of the S100A10 affinity for Ahnak. To investigate whether Annexin2 could directly interact with Ahnak-Cter and to further characterize the A2t interaction with Ahnak, we performed in vitro binding experiments. The C-terminal domain of Ahnak was produced as a GST-tagged protein and used in a pull-down assay. S100A10 and Annexin2 subunits isolated from pig intestine (see “Experimental Procedures”) were added either individually or in combination in the binding assay. Under the conditions of the assay, no interaction of Ahnak with S100A10 nor with Annexin2 was detectable (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). As expected from the triple hybrid data, when S100A10 and Annexin2 are mixed together they readily bind to Ahnak-Cter (lane 3). To investigate whether the full-length Annexin2 protein or solely the S100A10 binding site on Annexin2 influences the binding of A2t to Ahnak, an N-acetylated Annexin2 peptide (amino acids 1-13) harboring the entire S100A10 binding site was tested in the assay (19Johnsson N. Marriott G. Weber K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2435-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B (lane 5), the peptide mimicks the action of the full-length protein in allowing complex formation between S100A10 and Ahnak-Cter. We have verified the specificity of the peptide action through integration within A2t by testing its ability to compete with full-length Annexin2. When the peptide was added in the assay in the presence of S100A10 and in excess as compared with Annexin2, Annexin2 was displaced from the complex (Fig. 1B, upper lane 4) although S100A10 is still present (Fig. 1B, bottom lane 4). Noticeably, a stronger interaction of S100A10 with Ahnak-Cter was detected in the presence of Annexin2 peptide than in the presence of full-length Annexin2 (compare lanes 3 and 4). This observation suggests that in A2t, it is the S100A10 binding domain of Annexin2 that stimulates the interaction with Ahnak. However, because Annexin2 and S100A10 used in this experiment were subjected to a denaturation/renaturation protocol (see “Experimental Procedures”), we could not exclude the possibility of an artifact caused by improper refolding. We therefore performed the experiment with the native A2t complex. Here again, the Annexin2 peptide by dissociating the complex and replacing Annexin2, induces S100A10 binding to Ahnak (Fig. 1B, lanes 6 and 7). Altogether, these data indicate that, by binding to S100A10, Annexin2 creates conditions for a strong S100A10/Ahnak interaction. We can envision that this effect is due either to a change in the S100A10 conformation or to the formation of a binding platform at the interface between S100A10 and the Annexin2 N-terminal peptide. To map the A2t binding domain on Ahnak-Cter, we compared the interaction of A2t with a series of GST-Ahnak-Cter deletion mutants by pull-down assays (Fig. 2A). Using this strategy, we mapped the A2t binding sequence in Ahnak-Cter to a 20-amino acid peptide comprising residues 5645-5673 (Fig. 2A). When further deletions of 5 or 9 residues from the N- or C-terminal extremity, respectively, were made, the peptide lost its binding properties, indicating that these residues are crucial for the interaction. This 20-amino acid peptide that binds A2t will hereafter be referred to as A2tBP1 (for A2t Binding Peptide 1). GST pull-down assay, using cytoplasmic extracts of MDCK cells metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine, showed that A2tBP1 is equivalent to Ahnak-Cter for its ability to bind A2t (Fig. 2B, left panel, lanes 3 and 4). Annexin2 and S100A10 whose identity was assessed by Western blot bound specifically and to a similar extent to both GST fusion constructs (Fig. 2B, right panel). Furthermore, a synthetic A2tBP1 readily antagonized the interaction between GST-Ahnak-Cter and the A2t (Fig. 2C), confirming that A2tBP1 constitutes the entire A2t binding domain of GST-Ahnak-Cter. More importantly, Fig. 2B (left panel) indicates that Annexin2 and S100A10 are the major if not the only proteins pulled-down by GST-Ahnak-Cter and GST-A2tBP1. Using GST-A2tBP1 bound to a biosensor chip via anti-GST antibodies, we next analyzed the kinetics of binding of purified native A2t complex to GST-A2tBP1 (Fig. 2D). The sensorgram shows a fast binding and a slow release kinetics indicating a high affinity between GST-A2tBP1 and A2t. Indeed, the ka and kd derived from three different curves ranged from 5 to 16 × 104 (ka) and 2.3 to 2.6 × 10-3 (kd), which gives a Kd of 3(±1.5) × 10-8 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The high affinity of A2t binding to A2tBP1 with a kd of 2.4 × 10-3 is consistent with the observation that, while the A2tBP1 synthetic peptide efficiently competed with Ahnak-Cter for binding to A2t (Fig. 2C), it only weakly displaced A2t from GST-Ahnak-Cter/A2t or GST-A2tBP1/A2t preformed complex (data not shown). To conclude, we have identified the"

Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 699-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The inositol headgroup of PIs is reversibly phosphorylated at three positions yielding seven isoforms, which cluster in distinct intracellular membranes. The apparent segregation of PIs is important for the fine-tuned regulation of protein and membrane traffic and also provides reliable and handy markers of organelles, such as the plasma membrane, trans-Golgi network, early endosomes, and multivesicular bodies. PIs were first recognized to function as precursors of secondary messengers in various signal transduction cascades and later as docking sites for modular effectors. A number of cytosolic protein effectors that are recruited to membranes and activated through interactions with PIs have recently been identified and structurally or biochemically characterized. The major PI binding modules include the ANTH (AP180 N-terminal homology), ENTH (epsin N-terminal homology), FERM (four-point one, ezrin, radixin, moesin), FYVE (Fab1, YOTB, Vac1, EEA1), PH (pleckstrin homology), and PX (Phox homology) domains (reviewed in Refs. 2Hurley J.H.

Since then, it has been found in at least 69 human and 15 yeast signaling proteins, protein kinases, PtdIns kinases and phospholipases (SMART). These proteins are implicated in a variety of physiological events playing fundamental roles in endocytosis, protein sorting, membrane trafficking, transcription, signaling, cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation (5Seet L.F.

The PX domain consists of ∼130 residues that are folded in a highly conserved three-dimensional structure despite little sequence similarity between the family members. A proline-rich region (PXXP), involved in the interaction with SH3 domains, and a set of basic residues, shown to coordinate PIs, comprise the most conserved elements. Of all PIs, PtdIns(3)P appears to be a primary target of the PX domain-containing proteins as the majority of them are found associated with PtdIns(3)P-enriched endosomes and vacuoles (Vam7p, sorting nexins (SNXs), p40phox, Grd19p), though interactions with PtdIns(3,4)P2, PtdIns(3,5)P2, PtdIns(4,5)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 have also been reported for p47phox, SNXs, PI3K C2γ, CISK, FISH, and PLD1 (7Zheng B.

This lack of binding specificity distinguishes the PX module from the FYVE domain, an exclusive effector of PtdIns(3)P, and links it to the less selective PH domain. The atomic resolution crystal and solution structures of seven (CISK, Grd19p, p40phox, p47phox, SNX12, SNX22, and Vam7p) PX domains in the free and PtdIns(3)P- or PtdIns(3,4)P2-bound states have been determined (Refs. 19Bravo J.

All show a similar fold consisting of three to four α-helices connected by a long exposed proline-rich loop and capped by a three-stranded β-sheet. The PtdIns(3)P molecule is positioned in a relatively narrow and deep groove formed by the α-helical bundle and makes numerous hydrogen bonds with the most conserved basic residues of the PX domain. In the case of p40phox and p47phox PX domains, the PI binding is supported by nonspecific electrostatic interactions and by insertion of hydrophobic residues of an exposed loop into the membrane (25Stahelin R.V.

An analogous loop of the Vam7p PX domain is involved in the interaction with micelles as adjacent basic residues recognize PtdIns(3)P (12Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T. Kutateladze T.G. Emr S.D. Overduin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The solution structure of the ligand-free Vam7p PX domain reveals a well formed PtdIns(3)P binding pocket implying that the lipid binding may induce local but not global conformational changes in the domain (22Lu J. Garcia J. Dulubova I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5956-5962Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The Vam7p t-SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment receptor) is unique among PX domain-containing yeast proteins, most of which belongs to the SNX family. It is an essential component of membrane and protein trafficking in yeast, mediating homotypic vacuole fusion in cooperation with other SNAREs, NSF, SNAP, Rab GTPases, Sec1/Munc18, and additional elements of the membrane fusion machinery. While the majority of SNARE proteins associate with membranes through their transmembrane regions or via covalently attached lipids, Vam7p is targeted to vacuoles by its amino-terminal PX domain that specifically recognizes PtdIns(3)P (12Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T. Kutateladze T.G. Emr S.D. Overduin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Consequently, both the intact PX domain and the presence of PtdIns(3)P are required for the subcellular localization of Vam7p (12Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T. Kutateladze T.G. Emr S.D. Overduin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Despite the critical role in Vam7p function, the precise mechanism by which the PX domain targets PtdIns(3)P-enriched membranes remains unclear. Here we present the molecular basis of membrane docking and penetration by the PX domain of Vam7p based on structural and quantitative analysis of its interactions with lipids and micelles. Our results, derived from in vitro binding measurements using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and monolayer surface tension combined with data from mutagenesis experiments and the in vivo localization of fluorescently tagged proteins, provide novel insights into the membrane recruitment mechanism of Vam7p. The affinities of the PX domain for PtdIns(3)P and other lipids reveal a remarkable synergy within the multivalent complex which is responsible for the vacuole anchoring of Vam7p. Subcloning, Expression, and Purification of Vam7p PX Domain—DNA fragments encoding residues 2-122 of the yeast Vam7p PX domain were amplified by PCR and cloned in pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was expressed in the Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS strain in minimal media supplemented with 15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope) and glycerol (5 ml/liter) or in LB media. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm) and lysed using sonication or a French press (18,000 psi, 4 °C). The unlabeled and 15N uniformly labeled GST fusion protein was purified on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences). The GST tag was cleaved with thrombin (Sigma). The PX domain was exchanged into 20 mm Tris or d11-Tris, pH 6.8 in the presence of 100 or 200 mm KCl, 1 mm perdeuterated dithiothreitol, 50 μm 4-amidinophenyl methane sulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm NaN3, in 7% 2H2O/H2O or in 2H2O and concentrated using Millipore concentrators (Millipore). The protein identity and purity were determined by FPLC analysis, SDS-PAGE, and 1H NMR. PCR Mutagenesis of Vam7p PX—Site-directed mutagenesis of the Vam7p PX domain was performed using a QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The following mutants were generated: V70A, L71A, R73A, W75A, I90A, a double mutant V70AL71A and a triple mutant V70AL71AW75A. The sequences of all mutant constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. NMR Spectroscopy and Lipid Titrations—NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C on Varian INOVA 500 and 600 MHz spectrometers. The 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of 0.2 mm uniformly 15N-labeled PX domain were collected using 1024 t1 increments of 2048 data points, 96 number of increments and spectral widths of 7500 and 1367 Hz in the 1H and 15N dimensions, respectively. Lipid binding was characterized by monitoring chemical shift changes in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the PX domain as C4- or C16-PtdIns(3)P (Echelon Biosciences Inc.) were added step-wise to 2 mm, diheptanoyl phosphocholine (DHPC) (Avanti) to 502 mm CHAPS (Sigma) to 167 mm, 1,2-dicaproyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-l-serine] (PtdSer) (Avanti) to 42 mm, dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) (Avanti) to 150 mm, cyclohexylbutylphosphocholine (Anatrace) to 250 mm, dihexanoyl phosphocholine (Avanti) to 150 mm, 1-myristoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Avanti) to 200 mm and 1-myristoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (Avanti) to 50 mm. Significant changes in the resonances were judged to be greater than the average plus one standard deviation. The KD values were calculated by a nonlinear least-squares analysis using the Xmgr program and Equation 1, Δδ=Δδmax((([L]+[P]+KD)-(([L]+[P]+KD)2+(4×[P]×[L]))1/2)/(2×[P]))(Eq. 1) where [L] is the lipid concentration, [P] is the protein concentration, Δδ is the observed chemical shift change, and Δδmax is the chemical shift change at saturation. Micellar concentration, which corresponds to the solution concentration of intact micelles, was obtained by dividing the value of the detergent molecular concentration by an average aggregation number. Measured by pulse field gradient NMR (26Altieri A.S. Hinton D.P. Byrd R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7566-7567Crossref Scopus (439) Google Scholar), aggregation number for the mixed micelles comprised of DHPC and CHAPS (3:1 ratio) was found to be 40 molecules of DHPC and 13 molecules of CHAPS. The intensity profiles were standardized against those obtained for DPC micelles and cytochrome c under similar conditions (27Kutateladze T.G. Capelluto D.G.S. Ferguson C.G. Cheever M.L.

Paramagnetic Spin Labels—The 5-, 10-, and 14-doxyl derivatives of 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (3-6 mm) (Avanti) were gradually added to 250 μm 15N-labeled PX domain in the presence of 1.25 mm C4-PtdIns(3)P, 101 mm DHPC, and 35 mm CHAPS. The 1H-15N HSQC spectra were collected after each addition of the spin lipids and intensities of backbone amide resonances were compared. The final ratio of spin label to micelle was between 0.7 and 1.3. The spin labels did not alter the structure of the protein based on the absence of chemical shift perturbations. Monolayer Measurements—The penetration of wild-type and mutant Vam7p PX domains into the phospholipid monolayer was examined by measuring changes in the surface pressure (π) of invariable surface area while adding the protein. All experiments were performed at 23 °C using a 5-ml circular Teflon trough and Wilhelmy plate connected to a Cahn microbalance as previously described (28Bittova L. Sumandea M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9665-9672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A lipid monolayer containing various combinations of phospholipids was spread onto the subphase composed of 50 mm potassium phosphate, 0.16 m KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm NaN3 at pH 7.0 until the desired initial surface pressure (π0) was reached. After the signal stabilized, the PX domain was injected to a final concentration of 1 μm. The increase in surface pressure (Δπ) was measured for 60 min while stirring the subphase at 60 rpm. Typically, the Δπ value reached a maximum after 25 min. The maximal Δπ value depended on the PX domain concentration and reached saturation at ∼400 nm, therefore protein concentration in the subphase was maintained above this value. The resulting Δπ was plotted versus π0, and critical surface pressure (πc) was determined as the x-intercept (29Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal.

Briefly, solutions of PC, PE, PtdSer (Avanti), PtdIns, and PtdIns(3)P (Echelon) dissolved in CHCl3:MeOH:H2O (65:25:4) were mixed and dried down under vacuum. The lipids were resuspended in 50 mm Tris, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.0 and incubated at 64 °C for 1 h. The liposomes were then frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed at 37 °C for three cycles. The liposome solution was passed through an Avanti extruder to make 1.0 μm liposomes. Liposomes were collected by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended to a final concentration of 2 mm total lipids in 100 μl20 mm Tris, 100 mm KCl buffer, pH 7.4. Liposomes were incubated with the wild-type and mutant GST-Vam7p PX domain, GST or BSA (2 μg/ml final protein concentration) for 30 min at room temperature and then collected again by centrifugation. The liposome pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of buffer and analyzed using SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The in Vivo Localization of Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) Fusion Vam7p PX Domain in Yeast Cells—A region (amino acids 2-122) of Vam7p containing the wild-type or mutant PX domain was expressed in a wild-type yeast strain (BY4742) with an N-terminal EGFP tag using the pRS416-based expression vector, pGO-EGFP. Transformed strains were grown at 26 °C to an A600 ∼0.5 in synthetic complete (SC) media lacking uracil to select for the plasmid. The cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy as previously described (31Kutateladze T.G. Ogburn K.D. Watson W.T. de Beer T. Emr S.D. Burd C.G. Overduin M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 805-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Images were acquired at the same exposure settings using Phase 3 Imaging software (Phase 3 Imaging Systems, Glen, PA) running on a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope fitted with a cooled, high resolution charge-coupled device camera (model C4742-95, Hammamatsu Photogenics, Bridegwater, NJ). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate EGFP-PX domain mutants, I90A, V70A/L71A, and V70A/L71A/W75A using a QuikChange kit (Stratagene). An Exposed Loop of the Vam7p PX Domain Is Involved in the Interaction with Lipid Micelles—To investigate the structural nature of the membrane association of the Vam7p PX domain, a number of soluble membrane mimetics were probed in NMR experiments. Of seven micelle systems screened, a mixture of DHPC and CHAPS in a ratio of 3 to 1 produced a lipid environment in which the Vam7p PX domain remained structured at all concentrations of micelles tested. The presence of CHAPS had a stabilizing effect on the PX domain tertiary structure preventing its unfolding. Moreover, this detergent appears to be capable of restoring a fully structured native state of the PX domain that is partially unfolded by DHPC alone. Upon titration of mixed DHPC/CHAPS micelles into uniformly 15N-labeled Vam7p PX domain, pre-bound to C4-PtdIns(3)P, substantial amide chemical shift changes in 1H 15N HSQC spectra were observed. The most pronounced perturbations of the 1H and 15N resonances were detected for the Glu66, Lys67, Val70, Leu71, Arg73, Arg74, Trp75, Gln76, and Arg77 residues of the loop connecting helices α1 and α2 of the PX domain (Fig. 1, a-c). Mapping the chemical shift changes onto the Vam7p PX domain surface revealed a flexible and a fully solvent exposed protrusion or membrane interaction loop (MIL) (12Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T. Kutateladze T.G. Emr S.D. Overduin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The Val70-Leu71 hydrophobic sequence, Trp75 and the two adjacent charged regions, Arg73-Arg74 and Gln76-Arg77, exhibited the largest changes suggesting that both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions might be involved. These perturbations paralleled chemical shift changes seen in the ligand-free PX domain as mixed DHPC/CHAPS micelles were titrated in (Fig. 1, d-f) and were similar in directions to small changes observed upon addition of dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles (12Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T. Kutateladze T.G. Emr S.D. Overduin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). An almost identical pattern of resonance perturbations in the ligand-free and PtdIns(3)P-bound state of the PX domain suggests a similar mode of DHPC/CHAPS association involving the MIL. Yet, the micelle binding of the PtdIns(3)P-bound protein appears to be much stronger judging by significant line broadening of NMR resonances, indicative of an intermediate-to-fast exchange regime on the NMR time scale and hence a higher affinity interaction. DHPC/CHAPS Micelles Enhance the Vam7p PX Domain Interaction with PtdIns(3)P—To determine the effect of micelle binding on the PtdIns(3)P interaction, resonances of DHPC/CHAPS-associated Vam7p PX domain were monitored while C4-PtdIns(3)P was titrated in. Addition of PtdIns(3)P induced large amide chemical shift changes in a number of charged, polar, and aromatic residues, the majority of which reside in the β1- and β2-strands, in the α1- and α2-helices and in the MIL (Fig. 2, a-c). Although the three-dimensional fold of the Vam7p-PX/PtdIns(3)P complex remains unknown, the solution structure of the ligand-free protein indicates that the PtdIns(3)P binding pocket is largely preformed in the domain (22Lu J. Garcia J. Dulubova I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5956-5962Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This implies that the chemical shift changes observed in NMR spectra occurred primarily because of direct interaction with PtdIns(3)P rather than caused by a conformational change in the PX domain. Indeed, the most affected residues, when labeled on the surface of the Vam7p PX domain, reveal a compact PtdIns(3)P binding site located at the stem of the MIL. Similar resonance perturbations were seen in the free Vam7p PX domain during titration of PtdIns(3)P (Fig. 2, d-f and Ref. 12Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T. Kutateladze T.G. Emr S.D. Overduin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), suggesting that PtdIns(3)P occupies the same binding pocket. However in the presence of DHPC/CHAPS micelles, resonances of the active site residues became significantly broader, indicating intermediate exchange and stronger binding. Thus, nonspecific association of the Vam7p PX domain with membrane-mimicking lipid systems enhances its specific interaction with PtdIns(3)P. Affinities of the Vam7p PX Domain for Membrane Components—To quantitatively define the contribution of the nonspecific micelle association and PtdIns(3)P binding, dissociation constants (KD) of each reaction were measured by NMR (Fig. 3). The magnitude of chemical shift changes in 1H-15N HSQC spectra induced by PtdIns(3)P or DHPC/CHAPS micelles was evaluated for a number of substantially perturbed PX residues. As shown in Fig. 3, PtdIns(3)P was bound by the free Vam7p PX domain with a KD of 344 ± 27 μm, as determined from chemical shift perturbation analysis (Fig. 3a). However in the presence of DHPC/CHAPS micelles, the same interaction was seven times stronger, showing an affinity of 50 ± 10 μm (Fig. 3b). Similar binding enhancement was exerted by PtdIns(3)P on the micelle association of the PX domain. That is, the DHPC/CHAPS micelle affinity of the ligand-free Vam7p PX domain was six times weaker (7.1 ± 1.6 mm) than that of the C4-PtdIns(3)P-bound PX domain (1.2 ± 0.2 mm, Fig. 3, c and d). The bivalent affinity of the Vam7p PX domain for C4-PtdIns(3)P-containing micelles, estimated as a product of the two sequential binding events (32Tochtrop G.P. Richter K. Tang C. Toner J.J. Covey D.F. Cistola D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1847-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), is then predicted to be ∼0.4 μm. Interestingly, comparably increased binding affinities were reported for the FYVE domain interactions with PtdIns(3)P and DPC micelles (27Kutateladze T.G. Capelluto D.G.S. Ferguson C.G. Cheever M.L. Kutateladze A.G. Prestwich G.D. Overduin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3050-3057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Similar to the FYVE domain, such amplification may be attributed to an insertion of hydrophobic residues of the PX domain in the micelle interior and/or may reflect the preference for the exposed acyl chains of PtdIns(3)P to become buried inside a micelle. Accordingly, extending the PtdIns(3)P acyl chains or increasing the MIL hydrophobicity is likely to enhance this interaction. Indeed, the micelle-associated PX domain bound more tightly to a long chain di-palmitoyl (C16)-PtdIns(3)P than to the short chain form, as evidenced by their slow and intermediate exchange on the NMR time scale (Fig. 2a and supplemental Fig. S1). Vam7p PX Domain Penetrates Monolayers—A number of PI-recognizing modules, including FYVE and ENTH domains as well as PX domains of p40phox and p47phox have been shown to insert hydrophobic elements into bilayers (25Stahelin R.V.

To test whether the Vam7p PX domain is capable of penetrating membranes, we analyzed its ability to alter surface tension of lipid monolayers of different compositions. The monolayers containing POPC/POPS and POPC/POPS/PtdIns(3)P were spread onto a surface area with initial surface pressure of π0, and after the injection of the protein, the change in surface pressure (Δπ) was measured (Fig. 4, a-c). As shown in Fig. 4a, the Vam7p PX domain exhibited low penetrating power into a POPC/POPS monolayer with a πc value ∼24 dyne/cm, implying that in the absence of PtdIns(3)P it has low intrinsic membrane-penetrating capability. However, incorporation of PtdIns(3)P into the monolayer substantially elevated its penetration raising the πc value to ∼33 dyne/cm. These results suggest that Vam7p can penetrate membranes since the surface pressure of cell membranes is estimated to be ∼31 dyne/cm (35Marsh D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 183-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar) and PtdIns(3)P binding is required for the strong insertion. Likewise, PtdIns(3)P is necessary for the FYVE domain to sufficiently penetrate phospholipid monolayers or micelles (27Kutateladze T.G. Capelluto D.G.S. Ferguson C.G. Cheever M.L. Kutateladze A.G.

The specific nature of the PtdIns(3)P effect on the Vam7p PX domain insertion was confirmed by the lack of an increase in surface pressure when phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate (PtdIns(5)P) was incorporated into the monolayers (Fig. 4a). The MIL Residues Val70, Leu71, and Trp75 Insert into the Micelle Interior—To identify the MIL residues penetrating membranes, NMR experiments with spin label probes were carried out. The paramagnetic 5-, 10-, and 14-doxyl-phosphatidylcholine lipids carry a nitroxyl radical at positions 5, 10, and 14 of the stearoyl side chain, respectively. They readily incorporate into micelles and broaden NMR resonances of nuclei located near the micelle surface, in the middle of the lipid acyl groups and in the center of micelles, respectively, as was thoroughly measured by NMR and EPR studies (36Van Den Hooven H.W.

https://openalex.org/W2002565617,"Endoglin is a membrane-inserted protein that is preferentially synthesized in angiogenic vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Endoglin associates with members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor family and has been identified as the gene involved in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Although endoglin is known to affect cell responses to TGF-beta, its mode of action is largely unknown. We performed yeast two-hybrid screening of a human placental cDNA library and isolated a new endoglin-binding partner, a novel 221-amino acid member of the Tctex1/2 family of cytoplasmic dynein light chains named Tctex2beta, as the founder of a new Tctex1/2 subfamily. The interaction was localized exclusively to the cytoplasmic domain of endoglin. Reverse transcription-PCR showed expression of Tctex2beta in a wide range of tissues, including vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, placenta, and testis, as well as in several tumor cell lines. High expression levels were found in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and the large cell lung cancer cell line. Forced expression of Tctex2beta had a profound inhibitory effect on TGF-beta signaling. Additional Tctex2beta-interacting receptors were identified to be the TGF-beta type II receptor and most likely beta-glycan, but not ALK5, ALK1, or the bone morphogenetic protein type II receptor. Upon fluorescence tagging, co-localization of Tctex2beta and endoglin, as well as Tctex2beta, endoglin, and the TGF-beta type II receptor, was observed by different microscopy techniques. Our findings link endoglin for the first time to microtubule-based minus end-directed transport machinery, suggesting that some endoglin functions might be regulated and directed by its interaction with the cytoplasmic dynein light chain Tctex2beta."

Two limitations of these studies are the inability to stabilize and compare the T and R-state forms of deoxy-HbA (human adult hemoglobin) without mutagenic or chemical modification and the complexity of the reductase reaction in solution due to autoacceleration arising from the allosteric nature of Hb reactivity.The present study directly addresses the question of how the conformational state of HbA affects the interaction with nitrite by isolating T and R-state forms of the deoxy derivatives of HbA using sol-gel encapsulation to “lock in” global conformation populations. Several sol-gel encapsulation protocols have been developed that limit the conformational dynamics of the protein without significantly limiting diffusion of small solute and solvent molecules from the surrounding medium (16Shibayama N. Saigo S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 21Samuni U. Roche C.J. Dantsker D. Juszczak L.J. Friedman J.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2820-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the case of HbA, the sol-gel matrix greatly slows the interconversion of R and T structures to time scales that greatly exceed those of standard kinetic measurements. As a result encapsulated deoxy-HbA retains the T quaternary structure for days to weeks subsequent to binding ligands. Similarly, deoxygenation of encapsulated R-state oxy HbA samples yields deoxy-HbA samples that can remain in the R-state for periods that greatly exceed the time scale of typical kinetic reactions such as those associated with nitrite reductase measurements (16Shibayama N. Saigo S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 22Das T.K. Khan I. Rousseau D.L. Friedman J.M. Biospectroscopy. 1999; 5: 64-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a result we are able to prepare T and R-state forms of deoxy-HbA and directly compare nitrite reductase activity. This approach also allows a direct evaluation of the influence of pH and added allosteric effectors inositol hexaphosphate (IHP) and L35 (23Lalezari I. Lalezari P. Poyart C. Marden M. Kister J.

The results show that the nitrite reductase activity of HbA is a function not only of quaternary structure but also of both pH and added allosteric effectors for a given quaternary state of Hb. Kinetic patterns for the recombination of CO to a variety of stable and transient forms of encapsulated T-state CO Hbs are also shown. These results show that effectors and the degree of ligation all influence the distribution of functionally distinct T-state tertiary conformations, a finding that provides a biophysical basis for modulation of T-state enzymatic activity of HbA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSample PreparationSource of Hb—OxyHbA, provided by Drs.

The second protocol referred to as the R-state protocol is designed to trap and maintain the R-state of HbA.T-state protocol—Oxy-HbA (2 mm in heme) in 0.05 m Bis-Tris acetate, pH 6.5, was first purged with nitrogen and then treated with dithionite (<2 times the heme concentration) to generate deoxy-HbA. The T-state deoxy-HbA peak positions of the Q-band (555 nm), band III (758 nm), and the Soret band (430 nm) were verified by visible absorption spectroscopy for each sample of deoxy-HbA before its use. A 100-μl aliquot of this deoxy-Hb solution was used to generate a thin (<1 mm) layer of an encapsulated deoxy-HbA sample on the inside of a 1-cm-diameter quartz NMR tube as described below. The effector-containing samples were prepared by adding IHP and L35 (1:1:1 tetramer:IHP:L35) to this initial deoxy-HbA sample before making the sol-gel. IHP and L35 were also included at 0.125 mm (the approximate concentration of the tetramer in the sol-gel) in the buffer bathing the HbA-containing gel.R-state protocol—These samples were prepared by first encapsulating HbA as the oxy derivative in the sol gel. The ligation status of the oxy samples was verified by optical absorption. The encapsulated fully oxy HbA samples were then aged for the same period of time as those prepared using the T-state protocol. The aging of the sol-gel samples enhances the locking in of the initial conformational population. After the aging process, the oxygenation status was confirmed by optical spectra. The samples were then converted to the five coordinate high spin ferrous derivative (also known as deoxy) by first purging the sample extensively with nitrogen gas and then adding a slight excess of dithionite that was then flushed out subsequent to full deoxygenation. Deoxygenation and the R-state status of the resulting deoxy sample were confirmed by optical spectra as discussed below.Sol-Gel Preparation—All protein samples were encapsulated using a sol-gel protocol demonstrated to favor tight locking of the initial protein conformational distribution (19Khan I.

Basically, buffer 0.05 m Bis-Tris acetate, pH 6.5, containing 25% glycerol was added to ultrapure tetramethylorthosilicate (Sigma) followed by the addition of protein in 0.05 m Bis-Tris acetate at pH 6.5. The resulting solution was a 1:1:1 mix of each component, and the final concentration of protein was 0.5 mm in heme. The resulting solution was vortexed slightly and then spun in a 1-cm-diameter NMR tube (Wilmad Glass, Buena, NJ) under nitrogen (for the deoxy samples) until gelation was complete. Deoxy samples were sealed in an oxygen-free hood with a septum. Once the sample gelled, an excess of nitrogen-purged buffer (0.05 m Bis-Tris acetate, 25% glycerol, pH 6.5) was added to the tube. All samples were aged for the same time (1-2 weeks) before the addition of nitrite. Oxy samples were prepared similarly except using oxygen-purged buffers for preparation and for storage.Sample CharacterizationAbsorption Spectra—The absorption spectra in the visible region were recorded using a Lambda 2 (PerkinElmer Life Science) absorption spectrometer with a sample compartment configured for either the 1-cm NMR tubes or standard cuvettes. The visible absorption spectrum was used to evaluate the ligation and oxidation status of the various solution phase and encapsulated HbA samples. In addition the peak positions of the Q-band at ∼555 nm and the near IR band (band III) at ∼760 nm were recorded for all preparations of deoxy samples. The peak positions of these two absorption peaks are known to be responsive to quaternary structure (28Perutz M.F. Kilmartin J.V. Nagai K. Szabo A. Simon S.R. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).Geminate and Solvent Phase/Bimolecular Recombination— The visible and near infrared absorption peaks for deoxy-HbA are adequate to assess the R-T status of the initial deoxy-HbA samples prepared using the two different encapsulation protocols. Less straightforward is how to monitor the extent to which the protocols maintain T and R-state status subsequent to ligand binding and the extent to which the sol-gel allows for ligation induced evolution of functionally distinct tertiary structures within a given quaternary state. As will be discussed subsequently, these issues are essential for sorting out both the role of effectors in modulating nitrite reductase activity and the possibility of autocatalytic behavior within the T or R states. We have previously shown (21Samuni U. Roche C.J. Dantsker D. Juszczak L.J. Friedman J.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2820-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) that CO recombination and maximum entropy method (MEM) analysis of the different kinetic phases together provide a means of monitoring not only the R-T status of encapsulated HbA samples but also the evolution of functionally distinct T-state populations with time. The CO recombination kinetics were generated after extensively flushing both T-state protocol and R-state protocol deoxy samples with CO. The conversion of the samples to the CO derivative was confirmed by optical spectra. The geminate yield and the solvent phase recombination rates (under the pseudo first order conditions of having a large excess of CO) for sol-gel-encapsulated COHb samples are highly responsive to both the quaternary and tertiary status of the sample (19Khan I.

The CO recombination traces of samples of sol-gel-encapsulated carbonmonoxy Hbs were generated at 3.5 and 25 °C using a previously described protocol in which a 7-ns 532-nm excitation pulse (10 Hz) was used to photodissociate the CO from the heme and the attenuated 442 nm CW output from a HeCd laser was used as the probe of the recombination over several decades in time (19Khan I.

The evolution of T-state protocol samples was followed over a period of weeks to monitor the evolution of the kinetic traces as a function of added effectors. The evolution was followed for two categories of samples. In one case the bathing buffer contained 25% by volume glycerol, and in the second case the bathing buffer contained 75% glycerol as a means of further slowing conformation relaxation and, thus, better exposing the role of effectors in modulating relaxation within the T-state.The role of partial ligation with and without added effectors within the T-state was monitored using encapsulated Fe2+/Zn and Fe2+/Cr3+ symmetric hybrids of HbA. The Fe2+/Zn2+ hybrids are known both to bind oxygen non-cooperatively with very low affinity (31Miyazaki G. Morimoto H. Yun K.M. Park S.Y. Nakagawa A. Minagawa H. Shibayama N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1121-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and to remain in the T-state when liganded under a variety of solution conditions (20Samuni U. Juszczak L. Dantsker D. Khan I. Friedman A.J. Perez-Gonzalez-de-Apodaca J. Bruno S. Hui H.L. Colby J.E. Karasik E. Kwiatkowski L.D. Mozzarelli A. Noble R. Friedman J.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8272-8288Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The Zn2+ substitution mimics the behavior of the five coordinate ferrous irons in deoxy-HbA. The Fe2+/Cr3+ hybrids bind oxygen cooperatively with an affinity consistent with either enhanced stabilization of the R-state or destabilization of the T-state due to the heme-in plane nature of the Cr3+-heme unit (thus, mimicking ligation of the Fe2+-heme) (32Unzai S.

The initial bathing buffer was replaced with 0.05 m Bis-Tris acetate adjusted to either pH 6.5 or 7.5. Samples were allowed to equilibrate 30-60 min with new bathing buffer before initiating the reaction with nitrite.Reaction ConditionsSolutions of nitrite were prepared by adding the solid sodium salt to degassed buffer (0.05 m Bis-Tris acetate) and adjusting the pH to either 6.5 or 7.5. An aliquot of this stock was added to the bathing buffer of each T-state protocol and R-state protocol deoxy sample using a gas-tight syringe in an oxygen-free environment. The final concentration of nitrite in the bathing buffer was 15 mm for most measurements, creating a situation where nitrite was in large excess relative to the heme concentration. In one instance the concentration was reduced to 0.5 mm to determine whether the lower concentration of nitrite reduced the rate of reaction and, thus, might permit the appearance of intermediates not detected when the higher concentration of nitrite is used. All reactions were conducted in the absence of oxygen.After the addition of nitrite to the buffer bathing the sol-gel, absorption spectra were scanned at regular intervals (starting at one spectrum every 30 s and progressing to 1-min intervals as the reaction proceeded and slowed). Kinetic curves as a function of time were constructed from these data. In this manner the progress of the reaction could be traced at different wavelengths reflecting both starting species and reaction products (see Table 1). The original deoxy spectrum of each sample was subtracted from each of the intermediate and end point absorption spectra taken at timed intervals. Fractions of aquo-met-Hb were calculated and subtracted from the final absorption spectrum obtained in each kinetic run to generate the final spectrum of the product(s).TABLE 1Peak maxima for visible and near IR absorption bands from solution phase and sol-gel-encapsulated HbsSampleQ-bandBand IIIDeoxy-Hb (T solution)555 nmaFrom Ref. 46.

The encapsulated deoxy-HbA sample (T-state protocol) yields a Q-band peak position that is identical to that of deoxy-HbA solution phase samples, whereas the red-shifted peak from the R-state protocol sample is characteristic of solution phase deoxy samples from mutants or chemically modified samples that are known to be R-state species (28Perutz M.F.

The corresponding trace for a sample that is directly encapsulated as a COHbA derivative (designated as [COHbA]) is also shown. This trace is included as the R-state reference. The two kinetic phases shown in the figure have been well characterized (19Khan I. Shannon C.F. Dantsker D. Friedman A.J. Perez-Gonzalezde-Apodaca J. Friedman J.M.

Photobiol. 1980; 11: 479-484Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 42Friedman J.M. Lyons K.B. Nature. 1980; 284: 570-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and the second slower phase is the ligand concentration-dependent solvent phase recombination. It can be seen that over the time course of the sample evolution, the [deoxy-HbA + IHP + L35] + CO sample consistently has a lower geminate yield and slower bimolecular rate compared with the R-state [COHbA] reference. Similar time courses were obtained for the other T-state protocol samples with preparation-dependent differences in the evolution, as will be discussed in the following sections. The kinetic traces from CO-exposed R-state protocol deoxy samples were identical to that of the [COHbA] sample. Preliminary and still ongoing studies are being conducted on [oxyHbA] and [cyano-met-HbA] samples that are converted first to deoxy derivatives and then, after varying aging periods as a deoxy sample, are converted to the CO derivative. That study shows that it takes many days to weeks before the liganded-R converted to deoxy-R samples begin to manifest T-state signatures in either the spectra (Raman) or the kinetics of CO recombination.FIGURE 2A, kinetic trace showing the recombination of CO to HbA under pseudo first order conditions at 3. 5 °C subsequent to nanosecond photodissociation at pH 6.5 for sol-gel"

To explore the functional importance of this region, which is also present in most other myosin classes, we generated truncated constructs of Dictyostelium discoideum myosin-2. Truncation at position 80 resulted in the complete loss of myosin-2 function in vivo. Actin affinity was more than 80-fold, and the rate of ADP release ∼40-fold decreased in this mutant. In contrast, a myosin construct that lacks only the SH3-like subdomain, corresponding to residues 33-79, displayed much smaller functional defects. In complementation experiments with myosin-2 null cells, this construct rescued myosin-2-dependent processes such as cytokinesis, fruiting body formation, and sporogenesis. An 8-fold reduction in motile activity and changes of similar extent in the affinity for ADP and filamentous actin indicate the importance of the SH3-like subdomain for correct communication between the functional regions within the myosin motor domain and suggest that local perturbations in this region can play a role in modulating myosin-2 motor activity.

Members of the myosin superfamily of actin-based motors act in a variety of cellular functions such as muscle contraction, cell and organelle movement, membrane trafficking, and signal transduction. Although myosin motor domains show a high degree of sequence conservation, the individual myosin classes are clearly defined by differences in the head structure (1Sellers J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 3-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Extensive biochemical investigations of the myosin ATPase cycle together with structural information of the motor domain and electron microscopy of the actomyosin complex have led to detailed molecular models of the nucleotide-dependent actomyosin interaction (2Holmes K.C.

The crystal structure of the nucleotide-free smooth muscle myosin motor domain with essential light chain (ELC) bound, shows the ELC to be in contact with the N-terminal domain of the heavy chain. However, in the presence of MgADP·AlF4- the ELC is rotated up to 70° from the position in nucleotide-free myosin subfragment 1 (S1) and forms a contact with loop 1 (8Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments of the N-terminal region of myosins from different classes reveal that this region varies greatly in length and amino acid composition among the individual members. Class 1 myosins completely lack the N-terminal region corresponding to the first 79 residues of myosin-2 (9Kollmar M. Durrwang U. Kliche W. Manstein D.J. Kull F.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2517-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the case of class 2 myosins, residues 1-33 form an extended structure crossing the interface between the motor domain and the neck region (Fig. 1). Residues from this segment are in close contact and cover a hydrophobic groove on the motor domain surface. The ensuing residues 33-79 form the SH3-like subdomain (10Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies with zero-length cross linkers indicate that the two heads of myosin, when bound in a rigor complex with F-actin, are in close contact with each other. In the case of chicken gizzard HMM (heavy meromyosin), Glu168 could be cross-linked to Lys65 in the SH3-like subdomain of the neighboring head (11Onishi H. Maita T. Matsuda G. Fujiwara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19362-19368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cross-linked acto-HMM displayed a significantly increased ATPase activity, which was interpreted as evidence that this interaction may play a pivotal role in myosin function (7Schroder R.R.

We used deletion mutants to elucidate the role of this region by analyzing the kinetic behavior of the mutants and their ability to produce force and movement in an in vitro assay system. Complementation of Dictyostelium discoideum myosin-2 null cells was used for the in vivo analysis of the N-terminally truncated constructs. The characterization of the truncated myosins demonstrates that the removal of the SH3-like domain affects the interaction with nucleotides and actin as well as communication within the motor domain. Complete removal of the 80-amino acid-long N-terminal region resulted in almost complete loss of function and highly aberrant kinetic properties. Plasmid Construction and Transformation—Standard chemicals were purchased from Sigma, and restriction enzymes were obtained from MBI-Fermentas (St. Leon-Roth, Germany) and New England Biolabs (Frankfurt, Germany). Escherichia coli strain XL1Blue (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) was used for amplification of plasmids. All cloning was performed using standard procedures. The expression vectors for the production of the individual myosin constructs were based on the extrachromosomal vector pDXA-3H (14Manstein D.J. Schuster H.P. Morandini P. Hunt D.M. Gene. 1995; 162: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Two types of N-terminally modified Dictyostelium myosin-2 constructs were generated: ΔN1 constructs have the first N-terminal 80 amino acids deleted, and ΔN2 constructs have residues Tyr34 to Asn78, corresponding to the SH3-like domain, replaced with the tripeptide GTG (Fig. 1). Plasmid pSA1 encodes for the expression of full-length Dictyostelium myosin-2 and carries the sequence of a C-terminal His8 tag as described previously (15Manstein D.J. Hunt D.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1995; 16: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). PCR-directed mutagenesis using pSA1 as template resulted in the generation of myosin constructs pΔN-1-myosin and pΔN2-myosin encoding full-length myosin-2 with a completely or partially truncated N terminus, respectively. In pΔN2-myosin the base triplets encoding Tyr34 to Asn78 were deleted and replaced with the sequence GGTACCGGT to introduce a KpnI-AgeI site in the pSA1 plasmid. The N-terminal sequence was changed to introduce a BamHI site. Accordingly, the N terminus of ΔN2-myosin starts with Met-Asp-Pro, and residues Tyr34 to Asn78 are replaced by the tripeptide Gly-Thr-Gly (Fig. 1).

Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) produced constructs pΔN-1-M761 and pΔN2-M761, respectively, encoding the myosin-2 motor domain with truncated N terminus. Dictyostelium AX3-ORF+ cells were used for the production of the motor domain constructs. Wild-type myosin and N-terminally truncated full-length myosins ΔN1-myosin and ΔN2-myosin were produced in the mhcA- null cell line, HS1 (17Manstein D.J. Titus M.A. De Lozanne A. Spudich J.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Transformations were performed by electroporation (18Egelhoff T.T. Titus M.A. Manstein D.J. Ruppel K.M. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 319-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Transformants were screened for protein production as described previously (15Manstein D.J. Hunt D.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1995; 16: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cell lines producing near wild-type levels of the recombinant myosins were selected for further analysis. Protein Expression and Purification—Dictyostelium AX3-ORF+ cells producing the motor domain constructs and ΔN2-myosin myosins were grown as described previously (15Manstein D.J. Hunt D.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1995; 16: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cells producing ΔN1-myosin myosin were grown on 26 × 26-cm plastic plates filled with 100 ml of HL-5C medium. The confluent plates were incubated additionally for 24 h on gyratory shakers at 40 rpm before harvesting. Myosin null cells (HS1) transformed with pSA1, pΔN1-myosin, or pΔN2-myosin produced levels of full-length myosin and N-terminally truncated myosins similar to that of wild-type AX3-ORF+ cells (data not shown). The differences in molecular weight between the myosins were determined by SDS-PAGE using a 4-12% gradient (data not shown). The motor domain constructs were purified by Ni2+-NTA chromatography giving yields of 4 mg/g of cells for M761, 0.5 mg/g of cells for ΔN1-M761, and 1 mg/g of cells for ΔN2-M761. Some minor modifications were made for the purification of ΔN1-M761. Because of its lower thermal stability and increased propensity to aggregate, ΔN1-M761 was purified in the presence of 100 mm KCl, and centrifugation was performed at 30,000 × g. All buffers contained 100 mm KCl, and centrifugation steps were changed from 230,000 × g for 1 h to 25,000 × g for 30 min and from 500,000 × g for 1 h to 75,000 g for 30 min. Purified ΔN1-M761 was concentrated by dialysis against solid sucrose. The ATPase activity of ΔN1-M761 was greatly reduced after frozen storage of the protein. Therefore, we determined the time-dependent reduction of the actin-activated ATPase activity of the protein upon storage on ice. This showed that ΔN1-M761 displayed no significant reduction in enzymatic activity during the first 48 h. The results shown here were obtained with ΔN1-M761 from five different preparations, and all measurements were performed within 24 h after elution of the protein from the Ni2+-NTA column. The results shown for ΔN2-M761 and the myosin constructs with a complete tail region are based on at least three separate preparations. Following purification by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography (15Manstein D.J. Hunt D.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1995; 16: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), yields of 0.5, 1.5, and 4.0 mg of purified protein were obtained for ΔN1-M761, ΔN2-M761, and M761 per gram of cells. The reduced yields that were obtained with ΔN1-M761 and ΔN2-M761 result from increased losses during the initial steps of the purification including the wash step prior to ATP extraction of the recombinant motor domains. Full-length myosins were prepared by the method of Ruppel et al. (19Ruppel K.M. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18773-18780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. After lysis, centrifugation, and washing, the myosins were extracted from pellets with extraction buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 3 mm ATP. After dialyses against the buffer containing 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT, the precipitated myosins were resolved in extraction buffer containing 300 mm NaCl. The assembly-disassembly cycle was repeated, and myosin was finally dissolved in 0.2 volume/g cell of storage buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 3 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm ATP. The purified myosins were treated with Dictyostelium myosin light chain kinase as described by Ruppel et al. (19Ruppel K.M. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18773-18780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit actin was purified and labeled with pyrene (pyrene-actin) as described previously (20Criddle A.H. Geeves M.A. Jeffries T. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the recombinant Dictyostelium myosin motor domains were determined using the Bradford assay. Direct Functional Assays—Actin-sliding motility was performed at 30 °C using a fluorescence microscope as described previously (21Anson M. Geeves M.A. Kurzawa S.E. Manstein D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6069-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) with some minor modifications. Assay buffer contained 10 mm DTT. Experimental flow cells were constructed using bovine serum albumin (0.5 mg/ml in assay buffer)-coated glass slides and nitrocellulose-coated coverslips. Myosins were actin affinity-purified immediately before use, to remove rigor-forming myosins, as described by Uyeda et al. (22Uyeda T.Q. Kron S.J. Spudich J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The sliding movement started by introducing 2 mm ATP into bovine serum albumin/anti-fade solution containing 0.5% methylcellulose. Kinetic Measurements—Stopped-flow measurements were performed at 20 °C with a Hi-tech Scientific SF61 or an Applied Photophysics PiStar stopped-flow spectrophotometer using procedures and kinetic models described previously (23Batra R. Geeves M.A. Manstein D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6126-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 24Furch M. Fujita-Becker S. Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Manstein D.J. J. Mol.

EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1099-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). All concentrations refer to the concentration of the reactants after mixing in the stopped-flow observation cell. A notation is used that distinguishes between rate and equilibrium constants in the presence and absence of actin by using bold (k+1, K1) versus italic type (k+1, K1); subscripts A and D refer to actin (KA) and ADP (KD), respectively. Steady state ATPase activities were determined at 25 °C using a linked enzyme assay and analyzed as described (26Furch M. Geeves M.A. Manstein D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6317-6326Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The myosin concentration was 0.5-1 μm, and the highest actin concentration was 60 μm. NADH oxidation was followed using the change in absorption at 340 nm in a Beckman DU-650 spectrophotometer (Beckman-Coulter, Dreeich, Germany). The conditions were: 25 mm imidazole, 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.2 mm NADH, 0.5 mm phosphoenol pyruvate, 0.02 mg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 0.05 mg/ml pyruvate kinase, pH 7.4. The error bars shown in the graphs represent the standard deviations from at least 15 determinations of each data point. Protein from three or more preparations per construct was used for the generation of the graphs. Kinetic Properties of ΔN1-M761 and ΔN2-M761—To analyze in detail the effects of the truncations on the interaction with nucleotides and F-actin, steady-state ATPase measurements and transient kinetics measurements were performed. For each construct the actin-activated ATPase activity was measured over a range of 0 to 80 μm F-actin. In the presence of saturating concentrations of ATP and in the absence of F-actin, the basal ATPase activity of ΔN1-M761 was 0.014 s-1 and thus ∼2-fold slower than the value determined for M761. The basal ATPase rate of ΔN2-M761 was 0.05 s-1 (Table 1). At concentrations of actin much lower than Kapp, the dependence of the ATPase rate on the concentration of F-actin could be fitted to a straight line. The apparent second order rate constant for F-actin binding Kapp/kcat of the reaction could be determined from the slope of this line. A greater than 30-fold reduction in Kapp/kcat was observed for ΔN1-M761 compared with a less than 2-fold reduction for ΔN2-M761 (Table 1). At saturating actin concentrations, kcat values of 0.4 and 0.9 s-1 were determined for ΔN1-M761 and ΔN2-M761. The corresponding value for M761 is 2.1 s-1.TABLE 1Actin activation of ATPase activity The experimental conditions were 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2 at 25 °C.

The amplitude of the fluorescence signal obtained with M761 and ΔN2-M761 was 17% and showed little change in the range from 50 μm to 2 mm ATP. In the case of ΔN1-M761, the addition of less than 250 μm ATP produced more than 5-fold less change in intrinsic protein fluorescence, and at higher ATP concentrations the signal change became too small to allow accurate rate determinations. The observed rate constants (kobs) for the exponential increase in protein fluorescence were linearly dependent on the concentration of ATP up to 100 μm. The apparent second order rate constant for ATP binding to myosin (K1k+2) is defined by the slope of the best-fit line and could be determined for all three constructs. Values of K1k+2 for ATP binding were similar for wild-type myosin M761 and ΔN2-M761 and 3-fold faster for ΔN1-M761 (Table 2). At high ATP concentrations (>2 mm) the observed rate constants for M761 and ΔN2-M761 were saturating, and the dependence on the ATP concentration could be described by a hyperbola, where the maximum value of kobs defines k+2, the rate of the conformational change that follows ATP binding and precedes ATP hydrolysis (Scheme 1).TABLE 2Kinetic parameters of myosin interaction with nucleotides The experimental conditions were 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl at 20 °C. The binding and hydrolysis of ATP by D. discoideum myosin head fragments was analyzed in terms of Scheme 1. k+i and k–i are forward and reverse rate constants, and Ki (k+i/k–i) is the association equilibrium constant of the ith step of the reaction.

Therefore, additional measurements were performed using the fluorescent analogues mantATP and mantADP to measure nucleotide binding (27Woodward S.K. Geeves M.A. Manstein D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16056-16064Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Binding of mant-nucleotides was determined by monitoring the increase in mant-fluorescence upon the addition of increasing concentrations of the fluorescent nucleotides to the motor domain constructs. In the range of 1 to 25 μm, the observed rate constants (kobs) for the exponential increase in fluorescence were linearly dependent on the concentration of mant-nucleotide. The apparent second order rate constants were determined from the slope of the plotted best-fit line (data not shown). The rate for mantATP binding was similar for all constructs. Similarly, the second order rate constants for mantADP binding (k+D) displayed less than 3-fold differences (Table 2). The rate of mantADP dissociation (k-D) was determined by monitoring the decrease in fluorescence upon displacement of mantADP from the myosin·mantADP complex by the addition of excess ATP. The observed process could be fitted to a single exponential (Fig. 2) with kobs corresponding directly to the dissociation rate k-D (see Scheme 1). Compared with M761 and ΔN2-M761 the rate of mantADP release from ΔN1-M761 was decreased by more than 30-fold (Fig. 2, insert). Therefore, the almost 100-fold increase in ADP affinity displayed by ΔN1-M761 was caused mostly by the slower rate of ADP dissociation. The rate of F-actin binding was measured by following the exponential decrease in pyrene fluorescence observed upon binding of excess pyrene-labeled F-actin to myosin head fragments (16Kurzawa S.E. Manstein D.J. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The change in pyrene fluorescence could be fitted to a single exponential function. The observed rate constants were linearly dependent upon F-actin concentration over the entire range studied (Fig. 3A). The apparent second order rate constants for pyrene-actin binding (k+A) were obtained from the slopes of the plotted line. Values of 1.2 × 106 m-1 s-1 for M761, 0.19 × 106 m-1 s-1 for ΔN1-M761, and 0.10 × 106 m-1 s-1 for ΔN2-M761 were obtained. The rate of F-actin dissociation (k-A) from the myosin constructs was determined from the rate of fluorescence enhancement observed by displacing pyrene-actin from pyr-acto·M with an excess of unlabeled actin (Fig. 3B). M761 and ΔN2-M761 displayed a less than 2-fold difference in the rate of actin displacement. In contrast, F-actin dissociation from ΔN1-M761 was increased 9-fold (Fig. 3B, insert). The dissociation equilibrium constants for actin binding (KA) defined by the ratio k-Ak+A shows that the actin affinities for ΔN1-M761 and ΔN2-M761 are ∼100- and ∼20-fold lower than the value obtained for M761 (Table 3, Schemes 2 and 3). These differences explain, at least in part, the differences in the yields obtained for the different constructs during purification.TABLE 3Kinetic parameters of myosin interaction with actin The experimental conditions were 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl at 20 °C. Actomyosin ATPase activity was analyzed in terms of Scheme 2. Coupling between the actin and the nucleotide binding sites was analyzed using the model shown in Scheme 3. In this scheme KA, KAD, KDA, and KD are defined as dissociation equilibrium constants. The presence of actin alters the affinity of ADP for myosin and vice versa. The ADP affinity for MHF is given as KD, and the affinity of myosin for actin is defined as KA.NucleotideRate constantM761ΔN1-M761ΔN2-M761Nucleotide binding to actomyosinATPK1k+2 (μm–1 s–1)0.23 ± 0.010.59 ± 0.0080.17 ± 0.02ADPKAD (μm)210 ± 2No signal15 ± 2KAD/KD18 ± 0.75aThe value for KD was determined using mantADP instead of ADP.

Values of kobs were linearly dependent on ATP concentration in the range of 5 to 25 μm (data not shown). The slope of the best-fit line defines the apparent second order rate constant (K1k+2) values of 2.3 × 105 m-1 s-1, 5.9 × 105 m-1 s-1, and 1.7 × 105 m-1 s-1 were obtained for M761, ΔN1-M761, and ΔN2-M761, respectively (Table 3). The affinity of ADP for pyr-acto·M was determined from the ADP inhibition of the ATP-induced dissociation of actin from the complex. Mixing of 0.25 m pyr-acto·M with 100 μm ATP in the presence of different amounts of ADP resulted in an exponential increase in intrinsic protein fluorescence. No signal was obtained with ΔN1-M761. An increase in the concentration of ADP produced a reduction in kobs for ΔN2-M761 and M761 constructs. The estimated KAD values, obtained from fitting the data to the equation kobs = k0/(1 + [ADP]/KAD), were 15 μm for ΔN2-M761 and 182 μm for M761 (Table 3). Functional Analysis—The motor activity of the purified myosins was analyzed using in vitro motility assays (28Kron S.J. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6272-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar, 29Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). ΔN1-myosin and ΔN2-myosin supported the movement of actin filaments with velocities of 48 and 340 nm/s, respectively. In comparison, actin filaments moved with a velocity of 2.6 μm/s on surfaces decorated with wild-type myosin (Fig. 4). Complementation assays with myosin-2 null cells were used to test the ability of the constructs to rescue myosin-2-dependent processes. ΔN1-myosin and ΔN2-myosin were produced at a level similar to that of endogenous myosin-2 in wild-type cells. Dictyostelium myosin-2 null cells display characteristic phenotypic alterations that affect cytokinesis and the multicellular stages of Dictyostelium development. Complementation of myosin null cells with ΔN1-myosin did not rescue any of the myosin-2-specific defects. Transformants were unable to undergo normal cytokinesis or to grow in suspension culture, and their development was blocked at the mound stage (Fig. 5). In contrast, myosin-2 null cells transformed with ΔN2-myosin constructs were phenotypically almost normal. They grew at the same rate as null cells that were transformed with a myosin-2 wild-type construct, and they produced viable spores, although their fruiting bodies were markedly smaller than those formed by Dictyostelium cells producing wild-type myosin-2 (Fig. 5). The N-terminal subdomain of myosin-2 is one of the least conserved regions within the myosin head. Although class 1 myosins completely lack this region, it is clear from our in vivo functional analysis that the region or part of it is important for the normal functioning of a class 2 myosin. Kinetic analysis of ΔN1- and ΔN2-myosin constructs revealed that the N-terminal truncations affect but do not abolish the ability of myosin to bind nucleotides, to hydrolyze ATP, or to interact with F-actin. The truncations neither changed the apparent affinity for ATP in the absence of actin nor did they greatly perturb the basal Mg2+-ATPase rate. Actin activation of ATPase activity is also maintained in these constructs. The transient kinetic characterization of ΔN1-M761, which lacks the complete N-terminal subdomain, proved to be difficult because of the weakness or complete absence of spectroscopic signals associated with the binding of nucleotides. ΔN1-M761 binds at least 80-fold more weakly to F-actin and dissociates 12 times faster from F-actin in the absence of nucleotides. The weak interaction with F-actin, which is also apparent in the presence of nucleotides, correlates well with a reduced activation of ATPase activity and a reduction in the maximum turnover rate, kcat. In addition, the 40-fold decrease in the rate of mantADP release indicates that ADP release may become the rate-limiting step for basal ATPase, which is also apparent from the close similarity of the rate constants k-D and kbasal measured for ΔN1-M761. The head domain construct ΔN2-M761 shows almost wild type-like kinetic properties with binding and release rates for mantADP similar to M761. The observed 6- and 8-fold reductions in catalytic (kcat) and motor activities (Vmax) of ΔN2-myosin can be linked to perturbations in F-actin binding and ADP binding and coupling between the actin and nucleotide binding sites. These perturbations include an 18-fold decrease in F-actin affinity in the absence of nucleotides (KA), a 12-fold increase in affinity for ADP in the actin-bound state (KAD), and an almost 7-fold reduction in the coupling ratio (KAD/KD). ΔN1-myosin and ΔN2-myosin support actin filament movement. The 54- and 8-fold reduced velocities correlate well with the observed changes in the rates of ADP release that were observed for ΔN1-myosin and ΔN2-myosin, respectively. In the presence of a saturating number of myosin motors, velocity is proportional to d/ts, where d is the stroke size, and ts is the strongly bound state time. ts is independent of total ATP hydrolysis time and is determined by the rate of ADP release. The reduced velocities can therefore be attributed directly to a slow ADP release rate and a high ADP affinity for actomyosin (23Batra R. Geeves M.A. Manstein D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6126-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The results of in vitro motility assays with ΔN1-myosin and ΔN2-myosin explain at least in part the phenotypic changes observed for myosin null cells producing the truncated myosins. ΔN1-myosin displays a more than 50-fold reduced motility in the assay and is not able to compensate the myosin-dependent defects when produced in null cells. In contrast, ΔN2-myosin displays only a 7-fold reduced motile activity, and complementation assays with ΔN2-myosin indicate almost normal myosin-2 function. This observation suggests that the SH3-like subdomain is not critical for the in vivo function of myosin-2 under the conditions examined. Several earlier studies had addressed the interactions of the N-terminal region with other regions of the myosin head fragment. Using changes in intrinsic protein fluorescence, Berger and colleagues (30van Duffelen M. Chrin L.R. Berger C.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 329: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 31van Duffelen M. Chrin L.R. Berger C.L. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1767-1775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) concluded that the SH3-like subdomain of smooth muscle myosin is conformationally sensitive to nucleotide binding and/or hydrolysis. They further suggested that the N-terminal region is only indirectly coupled to the active site but that it is sensitive to direct interactions with the lever arm in the strongly bound states of the ATPase cycle (30van Duffelen M. Chrin L.R. Berger C.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 329: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 31van Duffelen M. Chrin L.R. Berger C.L. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1767-1775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Contacts between the N terminus and heavy chain residues 750-760 in the converter region (D. discoideum numbering) have been implicated by differential scanning calorimetry as important for the structural integrity and stability of the entire motor domain (32Nikolaeva O.P. Orlov V.N. Bobkov A.A. Levitsky D.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5678-5688Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Following tryptic cleavage of the skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain between Arg23 and Ile24, Levitsky and co-workers (32Nikolaeva O.P. Orlov V.N. Bobkov A.A. Levitsky D.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5678-5688Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) observed a reduction of the thermal transition from 49 to 42 °C, whereas nucleotide binding was unaffected. In contrast, tryptic cleavage in loops 1 and 2 affected neither the thermal transition temperature nor nucleotide binding. In agreement with these observations, we found that the ΔN1 constructs displayed an almost complete loss of enzymatic activity within 48 h after their purification. ΔN1-M761 displayed complete loss of activity following freeze-thawing. The importance of contacts between N-terminal residues and residues 750-760 in the converter was supported by similarities in the kinetic behavior of ΔN1-M761 and M754, a motor domain construct that is truncated at position 754 of the myosin heavy chain. In conclusion, our experiments show that the initial 33 N-terminal residues are of great importance for normal communication between the functional regions within the myosin-2 motor domain. Based on the observed differences between the crystal structures of class 1 and class 2 motor domains (9Kollmar M. Durrwang U. Kliche W. Manstein D.J. Kull F.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2517-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 33Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I.

Biol. 2003; 10: 826-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), we suggest that the N-terminal residues Pro3, Ile4, Tyr11, Leu15, and Tyr14 play an important role because they stabilize the motor domain through clustered hydrophobic interactions with residues Pro133, Ile134, Met139, Ile142, Phe143, and His154 in the proximal part of the N-terminal region (Fig. 1, B and C). Additional structural stability in this region is maintained by hydrophobic interactions formed between residues Phe25-Lys32 and residues 760-765 on an adjacent helix that emerges from the converter region (Fig. 1A). Consequently, noncovalent attractive forces between the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the motor domain are important for the structural and functional integrity of the myosin motor. Removal of only the SH3-like subdomain, as performed in the ΔN-2 constructs, does not affect the biological function of myosin-2 in Dictyostelium. However, the replacement of the SH3-like subdomain still has a clear effect on the way in which conformational changes that follow the binding of F-actin or nucleotide are communicated within the motor domain. At this stage, it is tempting to speculate that the mechanical perturbations of the SH3-like subdomain, as they may occur in the sarcomere, in the crowded context of a cleavage furrow, or in other physiological situations, can lead to changes in the functional behavior of the motor that are similar in extent or even greater than those observed for ΔN-2-myosin.

https://openalex.org/W2078976314,"A gene, named AtECH2, has been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana to encode a monofunctional peroxisomal enoyl-CoA hydratase 2. Homologues of AtECH2 are present in several angiosperms belonging to the Monocotyledon and Dicotyledon classes, as well as in a gymnosperm. In vitro enzyme assays demonstrated that AtECH2 catalyzed the reversible conversion of 2E-enoyl-CoA to 3R-hydroxyacyl-CoA. AtECH2 was also demonstrated to have enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 activity in an in vivo assay relying on the synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoate from the polymerization of 3R-hydroxyacyl-CoA in the peroxisomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. AtECH2 contained a peroxisome targeting signal at the C-terminal end, was addressed to the peroxisome in S. cerevisiae, and a fusion protein between AtECH2 and a fluorescent protein was targeted to peroxisomes in onion cells. AtECH2 gene expression was strongest in tissues with high β-oxidation activity, such as germinating seedlings and senescing leaves. The contribution of AtECH2 to the degradation of unsaturated fatty acids was assessed by analyzing the carbon flux through the β-oxidation cycle in plants that synthesize peroxisomal polyhydroxyalkanoate and that were over- or underexpressing the AtECH2 gene. These studies revealed that AtECH2 participates in vivo to the conversion of the intermediate 3R-hydroxyacyl-CoA, generated by the metabolism of fatty acids with a cis (Z)-unsaturated bond on an even-numbered carbon, to the 2E-enoyl-CoA for further degradation through the core β-oxidation cycle.

The peroxisome is the site of numerous important biochemical reactions in plants, including photorespiration, the β-oxidation cycle, and the glyoxylate cycle. Although several enzymes involved in these pathways have been identified, analysis of the plant proteome for proteins possessing putative peroxisome targeting sequences have identified numerous candidate peroxisomal proteins for which no functions have been assigned (1Reumann S. Ma C. Lemke S. Babujee L. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 2587-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Furthermore, prediction of peroxisomal proteins can be made difficult by the absence of recognizable signal peptide, particularly for peroxisomal membrane protein. Thus, our present knowledge of the complexity of the biochemical pathways present in the peroxisome is fragmented. The peroxisomal β-oxidation cycle is of primary importance during seedling establishment following germination, because it is responsible for the breakdown of fatty acids into acetyl-CoA, which is subsequently converted to glucose via the glyoxylate cycle and gluconeogenesis (2Gerhardt B. Prog. Lipid Res. 1992; 31: 417-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although fatty acid β-oxidation is very active during germination in oleaginous seed and during senescence, this cycle is also present in mature photosynthetic tissues, such as leaves, as well as in developing seeds (3Poirier Y. Ventre G. Caldelari D. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 1359-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Degradation of saturated fatty acids in the peroxisome occurs via four enzyme activities located on three proteins that form the core β-oxidation pathway. The first step is mediated by an acyl-CoA oxidase, converting acyl-CoA to 2E-enoyl-CoA. This is followed by the hydration of the 2E-enoyl-CoA to 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA by an enoyl-CoA hydratase and the subsequent conversion to 3-oxoacyl-CoA by a 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase participating in β-oxidation are typically both present on a single protein, named multifunctional enzyme (MFE). 2The abbreviations used are: MFE, multifunctional enzyme; PHA, polyhydroxyalkanoate; DAI, days after imbibition; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; ECFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; CaMV, cauliflower mosaic virus; MDH, malate dehydrogenase from cucumber; RNAi, RNA interference. Two forms of MFE have been found in various organisms. In bacteria, plants, and mammals, the type 1 MFE (MFE-1) mediates the conversion of 2E-enoyl-CoA to 3-oxoacyl-CoA via the isomer 3S-hydroxyacyl-CoA, whereas the type 2 MFE (MFE-2) found in mammals and fungi carries out the same reaction via the 3R-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediate. Although MFE-1 and MFE-2 are catalyzing similar reactions, these two MFE have no sequence identity and are structurally different (4Huyghe S. Mannaerts G.P. Baes M. Van Veldhoven P.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 973-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A 3-ketothiolase completes the β-oxidation cycle by cleaving 3-oxoacyl-CoA to generate acetyl-CoA and an acyl-CoA. Several genes encoding the enzymes of the core β-oxidation cycle have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana and other plants (5Graham I.A. Eastmond P.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 2002; 41: 156-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The core β-oxidation is not capable of completely degrading unsaturated fatty acids with cis (Z configuration) double bonds on an even-numbered carbon. For organisms possessing an MFE-1, this is due to the fact that hydration of 2Z-enoyl-CoA by the enoyl-CoA hydratase 1 generates the R-isomer of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, which is not a substrate for the 3S-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase present in the MFE-1. Additional enzymes have thus been described that contribute to β-oxidation to avoid this metabolic block created by cis-unsaturated bonds (6Hiltunen J.K. Filppula S.A. Koivuranta K.T. Siivari K. Qin Y.M. Hayrinen H.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 116-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Two pathways have been proposed by Schulz and Kunau (7Schulz H. Kunau W.-H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 403-406Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (86) Google Scholar) for the degradation of fatty acids having cis-double bonds at even-numbered carbons (see Fig. 1). In one pathway, named the reductase-isomerase pathway (Fig. 1, route 2), the unsaturated fatty acid is degraded by the core β-oxidation cycle to 2E,4Z-enoyl-CoA, which is subsequently reduced to 3E-enoyl-CoA by the Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase. The 3E-enoyl-CoA is then converted to 2E-enoyl-CoA by the enzyme Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase before returning to the core β-oxidation cycle. Peroxisomal Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase and Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase have been identified and studied in both yeast and mammals (8Hiltunen J.K. Qin Y.-M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 9Hiltunen J.K. Mursula A.M. Rottensteiner H. Wierenga R.K. Kastaniotis A.J. Gurvitz A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 35-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In plants, genes encoding the same enzymes have been identified in A. thaliana, 3S. Goepfert and Y. Poirier, unpublished observation. and enzyme activities have been detected in germinating cucumber seedlings (10Behrends W. Thieringer R. Engeland K. Kunau W.H. Kindl H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 263: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the second pathway, named the hydratase-epimerase pathway (Fig. 1, route 1), the unsaturated fatty acid is degraded by the core β-oxidation enzymes to 3R-hydroxyacyl-CoA that is then converted to 3S-hydroxyacyl-CoA before rejoining the core β-oxidation cycle. Conversion of 3R-hydroxyacyl-CoA to 3S-hydroxyacyl-CoA can be achieved either directly by a 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA epimerase or indirectly by the combined action of an enoyl-CoA hydratase 2, converting 3R-hydroxyacyl-CoA to 2E-enoyl-CoA, and an enoyl-CoA hydratase 1, converting 2E-enoyl-CoA to 3S-hydroxyacyl-CoA (2Gerhardt B. Prog. Lipid Res. 1992; 31: 417-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 11Engeland K. Kindl H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 12Hiltunen J.K.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20475-20481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MFE-1 of both Escherichia coli and cucumber has been shown to harbor a 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA epimerase activity (13Preisig-Muller R. Guhnemann-Schafer K. Kindl H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20475-20481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Yang S. Elzinga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6588-6592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Yang S.Y. He X.Y. Schulz H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6441-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammals, enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 is found as part of the MFE-2. In S. cerevisiae, MFE-2 is the only multifunctional enzyme present in the peroxisome, and thus acts as one of the enzyme of the core β-oxidation cycle for saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (9Hiltunen J.K. Mursula A.M. Rottensteiner H. Wierenga R.K. Kastaniotis A.J. Gurvitz A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 35-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In mammals, the MFE-2 has been found to contribute to bile acid synthesis, and the degradation of very long-chain fatty acids and branched-chain fatty acids, such as pristanic acid, but its involvement in the degradation of cis-unsaturated fatty acids has not been studied (4Huyghe S. Mannaerts G.P. Baes M. Van Veldhoven P.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 973-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Monofunctional enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 has also been identified in several Pseudomonas species, as well as in Aeromonas punctata, and has been implicated in the synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) (16Fukui T. Shiomi N. Doi Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 667-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Tsuge T. Fukui T. Matsusaki H. Taguchi S. Kobayashi G. Ishizaki A. Doi Y. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 184: 193-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No monofunctional enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 has been previously described in mammals or fungi, apart from proteolytic fragments of MFE-2 (4Huyghe S. Mannaerts G.P. Baes M. Van Veldhoven P.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 973-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Partial purification of a protein showing enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 activity has previously been described in cucumber seedlings, but the corresponding gene had not been identified (11Engeland K. Kindl H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this work, a gene from A. thaliana, named AtECH2, has been identified as encoding a peroxisomal monofunctional enoyl-CoA hydratase 2. Analysis of the carbon flux through the β-oxidation cycle in plants underexpressing the gene revealed the participation of AtECH2 in the degradation of unsaturated fatty acids. Sequence Analysis—The Arabidopsis protein data base available on The Arabidopsis Information Resource (www.arabidopsis.org/Blast/) was investigated using the BLASTP algorithm for protein showing homology to the human and fungal enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 domain present in the MFE-2 from human (P51659) and S. cerevisiae (ScFox2p and Ykr009p). Protein sequences were aligned using ClustalW (18Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55766) Google Scholar). The Institute for Genomic Research plant data base (www.tigr.org/plantProjects.shtml) was investigated using the TBLASTN algorithm for cDNA fragments encoding homologous sequences to AtECH2. Expressed sequence tags were assembled into contigs using a contig assembly program (19Huang X. Genomics. 1992; 14: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and the resulting contigs were translated into protein and aligned using ClustalW. Representative expressed sequence tags showing high homology to AtECH2 were: for Zea mays, BG842325.2, BG837223.1, and BE056943.1; for Glycine max, BI785998.1, BI787459.1, and AW349034.1; for Lycopersicon esculentum, BI921386.1 and BM409883.1; for Sorghum bicolor, BE595322.1, BE596452.1, BF657019.1, and BM329174.1; for Triticum aestivum, TC266049; for Hordeum vulgare, TC148035; for Oryza sativa sp. japonica cv niponbare, LOC_Os09g37280; and for Pinus taeda, TC75425. Bacterial Strains and DNA Constructs—E. coli DH5α was used to maintain and propagate all plasmids, with the exception of Gateway® native plasmids (pB7GWIWGII (2Gerhardt B. Prog. Lipid Res. 1992; 31: 417-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), pMDC32, pDONR™201, and pDONR™207), which were maintained in E. coli DB3.1™ (Invitrogen). All Gateway® technology-related procedures were done according to the manufacturer's instructions. Binary vectors containing T-DNA were electroporated in Agrobacterium tumefaciens pGV3101 pMP90. Expressed sequence tag AY070763 was obtained from RIKEN Biological Resource Center (www.brc.riken.jp). The shuttle plasmid pYE352-AtECH2 was constructed by replacing the catalase A (CTA1) gene from pYE352-CTA (20Filppula S.A. Sormunen R.T. Hartig A. Kunau W.H. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27453-27457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) by AtECH2. This was achieved by PCR amplification of AtECH2 from the cDNA clone AY070763 using the primers 5′-TCTAATCTAGATCGGAGATGGCGAC-3′ and 5′-AATATCTCGAGGGACCTAACATTCT-3′, followed by restriction with XbaI and XhoI restriction enzymes. For expression in plants, the AtECH2 cDNA sequence was amplified by PCR using primers AtECHcds-AttB1 5′-(AttB1)ATGGCGACTAGCGATTCT-3′ and AtECHcds-AttB2 5′-(AttB2)CTAAAGTGACGAAGATAA-3′ and recombined into pDONR207. The resulting pDONR207-ECH2 was further recombined with pMDC32 (21Curtis M.D. Grossniklaus U. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1969) Google Scholar) to give the binary vector pMDC32-AtECH2, which was subsequently electroporated in Agrobacterium tumefaciens. For the RNA interference construct, the gene-specific tag CATMA1a65370 for AtECH2 was obtained from CATMA project (22Hilson P. Allemeersch J. Altmann T. Aubourg S. Avon A. Beynon J. Bhalerao R.P.

Weingartner M. Weisbeek P.J. Wirta V. Wittink F.R. Zabeau M. Small I. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 2176-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and further amplified with the primers ECH2-AttB1 5′-(AttB1)CGCGTATTGCGAGAGTA-3′ ECH2-AttB2 5′-(AttB2)GCGCACAGGTTGTCTAT-3′. The resulting product was recombined into pDONR201 to give pDONR201-ECH2-GST. Recombination with pB7GWIWG2(II) Gateway® vectors for Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation (23Karimi M. De Meyer B. Hilson P. Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 103-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) resulted in the plasmid pB7GWIWG2(II)-ECH2. The LeECH2 cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR performed on RNA obtained from the aerial parts of a 3-week-old Lycopersicon esculentum cv Ailsa Craig plant using primers LeECH2-XbaI 5′-TCTCTCTAGATTTAATGGCAGGGTCTGGA-3′ and LeECH2-XhoI 5′-CGAGCGCTCGAGAAACACTCACAG-3′. The PCR product was subcloned in pGEMT-Easy (Promega, Madison, WI). LeECH2 was subsequently excised by XbaI-XhoI and replaced the CTA1 gene in pYE352-CTA1 to yield the plasmid pYE352-LeECH2, which was transformed in the yeast strain fox2Δ PHAC1. Similarly, a SpeI-XbaI fragment was transferred from LeECH2-pGEMT in the XbaI site of pMDC32 generating pMDC32-LeECH2. Microscopy—The plasmids pCAT-ECFP-MDH and pCATEYFP-Not have previously been described (24Fulda M. Shockey J. Werber M. Wolter F.P. Heinz E. Plant J. 2002; 32: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In-frame fusion of AtECH2 with the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) was achieved by amplifying AtECH2 from the cDNA clone AY070763 with the primers AtECH2-EagI-5′ 5′-AAGCGGCCGTGGATTCCGATG-3′ and AtECH2-XbaI-3′ 5′-TGACAGCCCAATATATCTAGACCTAACATT-3′, restricting the PCR product with EagI and XbaI and inserting the fragment into pCAT-EYFP-Not digested with NotI and XbaI. Onion (Allium cepa) cells were transformed, and fluorescence analyzed as previously described (25Goepfert S. Vidoudez C. Rezzonico E. Hiltunen J.K. Poirier Y. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 1947-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Enzymatic Assays and PHA Production in Yeast—Wild-type S. cerevisiae strain BY4742 (matα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0) and the isogenic fox2Δ mutant (Ykr009c::kanMX4) were obtained from EUROSCARF (www.uni-frankfurt.de/fb15/mikro/euroscarf/index.html). Plasmids were transformed into S. cerevisiae strains by the lithium acetate procedure (26Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). Yeast strains were routinely propagated on selective media composed of 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco, Detroit, MI), 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose, and appropriate drop-out supplement (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). For protein extraction and enzymatic assays, pYE352-AtECH2 was transformed in yeast strains fox2Δ PHAC1. Crude protein extract were obtained from cells grown in selective media containing 0.1% glucose, 2% Pluronic-127, and 0.1% oleic acid (Sigma). Assays were preformed as described in a previous study (27Palosaari P.M. Kilponen J.M. Sormunen R.T. Hassinen I.E. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3347-3353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PHA-synthesizing strains were generated with the yeast shuttle plasmid Yiplac111-PHA containing the PHAC1 synthase gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa modified for peroxisomal targeting by the addition, at the carboxyl end of the encoded protein, of the last 34 amino acids of the Brassica napus isocitrate lyase (28Marchesini S. Erard N. Glumoff T. Hiltunen J.K. Poirier Y. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 6495-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For experiments analyzing PHA synthesis, a stationary phase culture of cells grown in selective media containing 2% glucose was harvested by centrifugation, and cells were washed once in water and resuspended at a 1:10 dilution in fresh selective media containing 0.1% (w/v) glucose, 2% Pluronic-127 (w/v) (Sigma), and 0.1-0.01% (v/v) fatty acid. Cells were grown for an additional 3-4 days before harvesting them for PHA analysis as previously described (29Poirier Y. Erard N. Petetot J.M.-C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 5254-5260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fatty acids were purchased from Nu-Check-Prep (Elysian, MN). Plant Culture, RNA Extraction, and Northern Blot Analysis—Seeds of A. thaliana, accession Columbia (Col-0), were surface-sterilized and plated on media containing half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) media, 1% sucrose, and 0.8% agar. Plates were left in the dark at 4 °C for 48 h before placing them under constant illumination (70 μE.m-2) at 21 °C (defined as day 0 after imbibition (DAI)). After 15 DAI, plants were transplanted into soil under the same light and temperature conditions. Whole plants were collected from plates from 0 to 15 DAI. Green leaves, senescent leaves (30-50% chlorotic), stems, and flower buds were collected from plants grown in pots 40 DAI. Roots were harvested 7 DAI from plants grown in liquid half-strength MS medium supplemented with 2% sucrose. Transgenic plants over- and underexpressing AtECH2 were grown on half-strength MS media, 1% sucrose, 0.8% agar and harvested at 14 DAI. Total RNA was extracted with hot borate protocol (30Wan C.Y. Wilkins T.A. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar) for seedlings from 0 to 5 DAI and with the LiCl protocol (www2.unil.ch/ibpv/WWWPR/Docs/rna_preparation.htm) for all other samples. Northern blots were made with 20 μg of total RNA according to Sambrook and Russell (31Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3d Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). [32P]dCTP-labeled probe was made by random priming using Prime-a-gene® labeling system (Promega) and purified on the ProbeQant® kit (Amersham Biosciences). Probe template is a PCR fragment corresponding to the 5′ part of the cDNA of AtECH2. Prehybridization and hybridization were carried in sodium phosphate buffer 25 mm, 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.372 g/liter EDTA at 65 °C. Washes were done at 65 °C, twice for 10 min with 2× SSC 0.1% SDS, and then twice for 10 min in 1× SSC 0.1% SDS. Production and Analysis of Transgenic Plants for PHA Accumulation—Wild-type A. thaliana and transgenic line PHAC3.3 (32Mittendorf V. Bongcam V. Allenbach L. Coullerez G. Martini N. Poirier Y. Plant J. 1999; 20: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) were transformed by the flower dip method (33Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Selection of seeds was carried on half-strength MS medium containing 1% sucrose, 0.8% agar, and either the herbicide Basta (15 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), or hygromycin (30 μg/ml). For PHA analysis, seeds were surface-sterilized and plated on media containing half-strength MS, 1% sucrose, and 0.8% agar. Plates were first placed at 4 °C for 48 h before placing them under constant illumination (70 μE.m-2) at 21 °C. After 7 DAI, 8-10 seedlings were transferred in liquid half-strength MS, 1% sucrose, 2% Pluronic-127, and 0.025% fatty acid and grown for an additional 7 days with constant agitation (90 rpm) under the same light and temperature conditions before harvest. PHA was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as previously described (34Mittendorf V. Robertson E.J. Leech R.M. Kruger N. Steinbuchel A. Poirier Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13397-13402Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Identification of a Candidate Gene Encoding an Enoyl-CoA Hydratase—Searches using the BLASTP program available on The Arabidopsis Information Resource (www.arabidopsis.org) for A. thaliana proteins showing significant similarity to the enoyl-CoA hydratase domain of the MFE-2 of human (HsMFE2) and of S. cerevisiae (ScFox2p) revealed only one protein encoded by the gene At1g76150. This protein, named AtECH2, showed 40, 34, and 38% amino acid identity to the enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 domain of the MFE-2 of human and S. cerevisiae, and the monofunctional enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. AtECH2 was predicted to encode a protein of 309 amino acids with a pI of 7.6 and an estimated molecular mass of 34 kDa. Fig. 2A presents the alignment of AtECH2 with the monofunctional enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 from A. punctata (ApPHAJ) and P. aeruginosa (PaPHAJ2), and the hydratase domain of the MFE-2 from human (HsMFE2), S. cerevisiae (ScFox2p), and Candida tropicalis (CtMFE2). Multiple sequence alignment of eukaryotic enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 has previously revealed a conserved region showing a motif (Y/F)X1,2(L/V/I/G)(S/T/G/C)GDX-NP(L/I/V)HX5(AS) (35Qin Y.M. Haapalainen A.M. Kilpelainen S.H. Marttila M.S. Koski M.K. Glumoff T. Novikov D.K. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4965-4972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), called the hydratase 2 motif. This motif was found in AtECH2 between amino acids 203 and 219 (upper bracket in Fig. 2, A and B). Crystallization of the enoyl-CoA hydratase domain of the C. tropicalis MFE-2 identified four amino acids interacting with the CoA moiety that are highly conserved among eukaryotic hydratase 2 (arrows 2 in Fig. 2A) as well as five amino acids forming the active site (arrows 1 in Fig. 2A) (36Koski M.K. Haapalainen A.M. Hiltunen J.K. Glumoff T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24666-24672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All these nine amino acids were conserved in the AtECH2. Another notable feature of AtECH2 is the C-terminal tripeptide Ser-Ser-Leu (arrows 3 in Fig. 2A). Although this terminal tripeptide was not considered as a peroxisomal targeting signal in targeting prediction algorithms, a recent study aimed at identifying plant peroxisomal targeting signals described Ser-Ser-Leu as a minor peroxisomal targeting signal (37Reumann S. Ma C. Lemke S. Babujee L. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 783-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). AtECH2 protein sequence was used to identify putative enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 in various plant species. Alignment of these plant enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 is shown in Fig. 2B. There is a high degree of conservation found throughout the proteins for ECH2 of plants belonging to the Monocotyledon (H. vulgare, T. aestivum, S. bicolor, Z. mays, and O. sativa) and Dicotyledons (G. max and L. esculentum) classes as well as in one member of the Coniferophyta division (P. taeda). All residues forming the catalytic sites were conserved, and, of the four conserved residues (arrows 2 in Fig. 2B) interacting with the CoA moiety, only the aromatic amino acid Phe-153 of AtECH2 was replaced in various plants by the aromatic amino acid Tyr. Plant enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 showed predominance for the C-terminal tripeptide Ser-Ser-Leu (arrows 3 in Fig. 2B), whereas the pine homologous protein ended with the tripeptide Ser-Ala-Leu. Localization of AtECH2 in Peroxisomes—To assess the peroxisomal addressing of AtECH2, a fusion protein between an EYFP at the N terminus and AtECH2 at the C terminus was constructed and expressed under the control of a double cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35 S viral promoter to allow transient expression of the fusion protein in onion cells following biolistic bombardment. As a control, a second plasmid carrying a fusion gene between an enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) and the peroxisomal malate dehydrogenase from cucumber (MDH) was used. The EYFP:AtECH2 and ECFP: MDH gene constructs were transformed together in onion epidermal cells, and the fluorescence was examined by confocal microscopy after 12 h. Control experiments have determined that fluorescence of the EYFP and ECFP could be detected without cross-interference when expressed in the same cells (data not shown). Cells expressing the EYFP:AtECH2 have a punctuate fluorescence pattern that was expected for proteins located in the peroxisomes (Fig. 3A). The fluorescence pattern observed with the EYFP:AtECH2 matched precisely the pattern observed with the ECFP:MDH, revealing that AtECH2 is a peroxisomal protein (Fig. 3, B and C). In Vivo Complementation of the Enoyl-CoA Hydratase 2 Activity in S. cerevisiae—The in vivo enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 activity of AtECH2 was first assessed through the synthesis of PHA in transgenic S. cerevisiae. PHA is synthesized in bacteria from the polymerization of 3R-hydroxyacyl-CoA by a PHA synthase (38Poirier Y. Prog. Lipid Res. 2002; 41: 131-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that accumulation of PHA in yeast expressing a P. aeruginosa PHA synthase in the peroxisome was dependent on the β-oxidation of fatty acids and on the generation of 3R-hydroxyacyl-CoA from the MFE-2 encoded by the FOX2 gene (28Marchesini S. Erard N. Glumoff T. Hiltunen J.K. Poirier Y. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 6495-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 presents the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry profiles of monomers present in PHA produced in S. cerevisiae strains grown in media containing 0.1% (v/v) tridecanoic acid. Fig. 4A displays the profile obtained from a wild-type strain having an intact β-oxidation cycle. The 3-hydroxy acid monomers are identified with the prefix H, followed by the number of carbons in the chain and the number of unsaturated bonds. The PHA produced is mainly composed of odd-chain 3-hydroxy acids corresponding to the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediates generated by the β-oxidation of tridecanoic acid, namely 3-hydroxytridecanoic acid (H13:0), 3-hydroxyundecanoic acid (H11:0), 3-hydroxynonanoic acid (H9:0), and 3-hydroxyheptanoic acid (H7:0). Fig. 4B shows that, in a fox2Δ strain devoid of MFE-2 activity, no PHA is accumulated. Fig. 4C shows that expression of AtECH2 in the fox2Δ strain enabled the synthesis of PHA that contained only H13:0 as an odd-chain monomer, indicating that, although the 3R-hydroxytridecanoyl-CoA was generated, this intermediate was not furt"

To investigate the potential role of BCR-ABLp190 cessation in leukaemia development, we generated mice carrying a tetracycline-repressible BCR-ABLp190 transgene. These mice were morphologically normal at birth, and developed leukaemias. Disease was characterized by the presence of B-cell blasts co-expressing myeloid markers, reminiscent of the human counterpart. BCR-ABLp190 activation can initiate leukaemia in both young and adult mice. Transitory expression of BCR-ABLp190 is enough to develop leukaemia. Suppression of the BCR-ABLp190 transgene in leukaemic CombitTA-p190 mice did not rescue the malignant phenotype, indicating that BCR-ABLp190 is not required to maintain the disease in mice. Similar results were obtained by inactivation of BCR-ABLp190 with STI571 (Gleevec; Novartis, East Hanover, NJ, USA) in leukaemic CombitTA-p190 mice. However, gradual suppression of BCR-ABLp190 in leukaemic CombitTA-p190 mice identified a minimum level of BCR-ABLp190 expression necessary to revert the specific block in B-cell differentiation in the leukaemic cells. Overall, the findings indicate that BCR-ABLp190 appears to cause epigenetic and/or genetic changes in tumour-maintaining cells that render them insensitive to BCR-ABLp190 inactivation."

Cross-linking studies, knock-out, and reverse genetics experiments have established the crucial function of the positively charged eukaryotic N-terminal domain of PsaF for the binding of both donors (10Hippler M.

Hereby, Lys23 of PsaF from C. reinhardtii was found to be the key residue for the electrostatic interaction between PSI and both donors (12Hippler M. Drepper F. Haehnel W. Rochaix J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7339-7344Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The positively charged N-terminal domain is missing in prokaryotic organisms, and correspondingly, knock-out experiments and functional electron transfer measurements have demonstrated that, in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, efficient binding and electron transfer between PSI and pc or cyt c6 are independent of PsaF (10Hippler M. Reichert J. Sutter M. Zak E. Altschmied L. Schröer U. Herrmann R.G. Haehnel W.

Introduction of the basic PsaF domain from C. reinhardtii into cyanobacterial PsaF allowed efficient binding and fast electron transfer between the algal donors and the chimeric cyanobacterial PSI, proving that the positively charged N-terminal domain of PsaF is essential for electrostatic attraction of the donors and formation for the electron transfer complex competent in fast electron transfer (15Hippler M. Drepper F. Rochaix J.D. Muhlenhoff U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4180-4188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As outlined, in cyanobacteria, electrostatic interactions between the electron donors and the oxidizing side of PSI are independent of PsaF or any other peripheral PSI subunit. However, site-directed mutagenesis of pc or cyt c6 from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Anabaena PCC 7119 reveal the importance of electrostatic attractions between the reaction partners. Analysis of binding and electron transfer between the altered donors and the cyanobacterial PSI revealed that a positively charged amino acid located at the “northern face” of either pc or cyt c6 is crucial for the interaction with the reaction center (19Molina-Heredia F.P.

De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13292-13297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an equivalent positively charged exposed amino acid is present in cyt c6 from C. reinhardtii (22Kerfeld C.A. Anwar H.P. Interrante R. Merchant S. Yeates T.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 627-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) but absent from pc of C. reinhardtii (23Redinbo M.R. Cascio D. Choukair M.K. Rice D. Merchant S. Yeates T.O. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10560-10567Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and other eukaryotic pc structures. It is tempting to speculate that this positively charged amino acid expressed by pc or cyt c6 in cyanobacteria is important for electrostatic recognition of a negatively charged amino acid present in the core subunits PsaA or PsaB, thereby helping the formation of an electron transfer complex. It is of note that the hydrophobic interaction site of the PSI core formed by PsaA and PsaB with the electron transfer donors is conserved between prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. The high resolution structural data of cyanobacterial and pea PSI (24Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar, 25Ben-Shem A. Frolow F. Nelson N. Nature. 2003; 426: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) show that a Trp residue (corresponding to Trp627 in C. reinhardtii) from a luminal helix of PsaB together with a Trp residue (corresponding to Trp651 in C. reinhardtii) from a luminal helix of PsaA form a sandwich-like structure directly situated above P700. The importance of the lumenal loop j of the PsaB for electron transfer between PSI and the soluble donors has been demonstrated in Synechocystis PCC 6803. A double mutation in the lumenal loop j of the PsaB (W622C/A623R) caused a highly photosensitive phenotype and exhibited a severe defect in the interaction and electron transfer with pc or cyt c6 (26Sun J.

The function of the two Trp residues in electron transfer between the two donors and PSI was directly analyzed in a reverse genetic experiment in C. reinhardtii. Alteration of the Trp residues by site-directed mutagenesis and transformation of PsaA- and PsaB-deficient strains resulted in the generation of PsaA and PsaB mutant strains PsaA-Trp651Phe, PsaA-Trp651Ser, and PsaB-Trp627Phe (corresponding to PsaA-Trp655 PsaB-Trp631 in Synechococcus) (13Sommer F.

Chem. 2004; 279: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The change of either of the two PsaA or PsaB Trp residues to Phe abolished the formation of an intermolecular electron transfer complex between the altered PSI and pc, indicating that PsaATrp651 as well as PsaBTrp627 of loops i/j form the hydrophobic recognition site required for binding of pc to the core of PSI. In respect to electrostatic and hydrophobic recognition sites of the eukaryotic donor molecules, only pc has been investigated in detail. Site-directed mutagenesis of eukaryotic pc has demonstrated that the “southern” conserved negatively charged patch and the northern hydrophobic flat site of pc are required for electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic contact between pc and PSI, respectively, to promote binding and efficient electron transfer between pc and PSI (8Nordling M.

The precise electrostatic recognition site of eukaryotic cyt c6 that enables specific binding to the positively charged domain of PsaF is unknown. To identify the amino acid on cyt c6 responsible for binding to PsaF, we isolated a chemically cross-linked complex between cyt c6 and PSI from C. reinhardtii that was competent in fast and efficient electron transfer. The active cross-linked complex was digested with trypsin, and peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometric analysis identified cross-linked peptides and amino acids on cyt c6 and PsaF that, in turn, allows defining the precise recognition sites on both proteins.

A. 1998; 95: 7339-7344Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The measuring light was provided by a luminescence diode (Hitachi HE8404SG, 40 milliwatt, full width at half-maximum 30 nm) supplied with a stabilized battery-driven current source. The light was filtered through a 817-nm interference filter (full width at half-maximum 9 nm) and passed through a cuvette containing 200 μl of the sample with an optical path-length of 1 cm. Mass Spectrometry—For mass spectrometric identification of the peptides, the excised protein bands were destained with 70% ethanol, 10% acetic acid, cut in small pieces, and subjected to trypsin digestion as described previously (34Naumann B. Stauber E.J. Busch A. Sommer F. Hippler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20431-20441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis was performed on a LCQ Deca XP Plus ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, San Jose, California) in combination with a Famos autosampler, Switchos valve machine, and an Ultimate high pressure liquid chromatography machine (LC-Packings, Sunnyvale, California) as described previously (34Naumann B. Stauber E.J. Busch A. Sommer F. Hippler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20431-20441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For reversed phase chromatography, a linear gradient over 90 min with an initial aqueous phase of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in 5:95 acetonitrile:water and a final organic phase of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in 80:20 acetonitrile:water was used. Acquisition of mass spectra and sequence identification using Sequest software (Thermo Electron, San Jose, California) were done as described previously, except that the range of peptide masses (MH+) was 200-7500. The data base used for the peptide search was constructed of photosynthetic components of Chlamydomonas. To detect cross-linked peptides, Glu or Asp residues were allowed up to six different additional masses per run when searching the spectra against the data base with the Sequest software. The masses corresponded to various tryptic fragments of PsaF, allowing up to two missed cleavages and searching in different combinations of the different additional masses. Model Construction—The structure of C. reinhardtii cyt c6 is already solved (Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 1cyj) (22Kerfeld C.A. Anwar H.P. Interrante R. Merchant S. Yeates T.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 627-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and was used for the model presented here. To create a model of the electron transfer complex between PSI and cyt c6, the C. reinhardtii PsaA, PsaB, and PsaF sequences were modeled to the eukaryotic PSI structure (PDB entry 1yo9), which is a model derived from the crystal structure of a eukaryotic PSI and a cyanobacterial PSI structure (35Jolley C. Ben-Shem A. Nelson N. Fromme P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33627-33636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Sequences for each PSI subunit were obtained from the Chlamydomonas genome project version 3.0 and homology models for each subunit were constructed individually using the Swiss model online server (36Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4506) Google Scholar) and the Swiss PDB viewer (37Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9587) Google Scholar). The cyt c6 was then docked by hand to the PSI complex taking the biological data of a distance of ∼14 Å between the redox cofactors and the data presented here into account. The model was energy-minimized using the Swiss PDB viewer implemented GROMOS96. Cross-linking between PSI and Cyt c6—Cross-linking of PSI with cyt c6 resulted in a cross-linked product visible as an additional band after SDS-PAGE separation and Coomassie staining of the reaction mixture (Fig. 1). The band appeared in the mass range of the PsaF-cyt c6 cross-linked product, as described previously, by immunodetection with anti-PsaF antibodies (13Sommer F. Drepper F. Hippler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6573-6581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The band was excised, digested with trypsin, and used for further mass spectrometric analysis. The Cross-linked Complex between PSI and Cyt c6 Is Competent in Fast Electron Transfer as Revealed by Flash-induced Absorption Spectroscopy—To investigate the functionality of the cross-linked complex between PSI and cyt c6, the isolated cross-linked particles were analyzed by flash-induced absorption spectroscopy. The resulting kinetic traces (Fig. 2) can be deconvoluted by a bi-exponential decay revealing three distinct populations of PSI in the analyzed sample. The fast phase shows the same properties as the intermolecular electron transfer complex reaction between PSI and cyt c6, with a half-time of 4 μs. The amplitude of this fast phase corresponds to 60% of the total amplitude. Because this kinetic component is extremely sensitive to changes in distance and geometry within the electron transfer complex, we conclude that, in more than half of the cross-linked particles, PSI is cross-linked in a functional way that resembles the in vivo native complex. The second, slower phase with a half-time of 42 μs and a minor amplitude of 6.8% in respect to the total amplitude might relate to a cross-link product obeying a distorted geometry of the electron transfer partners. The constant fraction with 33.2% of the total amplitude is reduced in a different timescale and corresponds to not cross-linked or not functionally cross-linked PSI, which is reduced by ascorbate. Mass Spectrometric Analysis Reveals Specific Sites of Protein-Protein Interaction—Mass spectrometric analysis of the excised and tryptic digested protein band revealed PsaF and cyt c6 as expected. The identified peptide sequences and recovery rates are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1Recovery of peptides from PsaF and cytochrome c6 by MS The underlined sequences were found by MS, and the italic sequences were found as cross-linked products. Gly58-Arg66 of cytochrome c6 and Ala13-Arg28 of PsaF were only found in cross-linked peptides.RecoverySequence%Cytochrome c653ADLALGAQVFNGNCAACHMGGRNSVMPEKTLDKAALEQYLDGGFKVESIIYQVENGKGAMPAWADRLSEEE IQAVAEYVFKQATD AAWKYPsaF55DIAGLTPCSESKAYAKLEKKELKTLEKRLKQYEADSAPAVALKATMERTKARFANYAKAGLLC GNDGLPHLIADPGLALKYGHAG EVFIPTFGFLYVAGYIGYVGRQYLIAVKGEAKPTDKEIIIDVPLATKLAWQGAGWPLAAVQELQRGTLLEKEEN ITVSPR Open table in a new tab For the identification of cross-linked peptides using Sequest, Glu and Asp residues were allowed additional masses that corresponded to tryptic peptides of PsaF, allowing up to two missed cleavages (minus H2O for the cross-link peptide bound). The rationale behind this is that we expected to find cyt c6 peptides that were cross-linked via Lys residues of PsaF. Because the Sequest software allows only up to six modifications, the mentioned additional masses were searched in different combinations. In complete digests, we found no significant hits for queries that included PsaF-peptides that contained the C-terminal Lys residue as the only Lys residue. This was expected, because cross-linking the ϵ-amino group of a Lys residue to the γ/δ-carboxyl group of Asp/Glu residue results in loss of the recognition site for peptide hydrolysis by trypsin. For queries with PsaF peptides that include one missed cleavage site, we found peptides 24TLEKR28 and 21ELKTLEK27 cross-linked with the cyt c6 peptide 67LSEEEIQAVAEYVFK81. Allowing two missed cleavage sites, we identified PsaF peptide 20KELKTLEK27 cross-linked to the same cyt c6 peptide (summarized in Table 2). Because of the fact that all PsaF peptides were linked to the same cyt c6 peptide 67LSEEEIQAVAEYVFK81 and this peptide was also found by Sequest by itself (see Fig. 3A), additional cross-linking/interaction sites between cyt c6 and the basic patch of PsaF could be predicted. It should be of note that the cross-linking products were also found by Sequest searches when looking for PsaF tryptic peptides modified on Lys with the mass corresponding to the cyt c6 peptide 67-81 (data not shown), although the Xcorr factors were significantly lower. This demonstrates that peptide length and query identity strongly influences the outcome of the Sequest algorithm. This is not surprising, because these cutoff values were designed for simple linear peptides and have less significance for the more complex cross-linked peptides.TABLE 2Identified cross-linked peptides in one representative MS-MS experiment Listed are scan numbers; z (charge of the precursor ion); dM, calculated mass, measured mass of precursor; XCorr, correlation factor for Sequest analysis (only ions with a XCorr ≥ 1.5, 2.5, or 3.5 for singly, doubly, or triply charged ions, respectively, were taken into account); ΔCn, difference in XCorr between best and second best hit; ions, fragments from MS-MS experiment/maximal expected number of fragments (only y- and b-ions of the cytochrome c6 peptide are accounted for); sequence, proposed sequence from Sequest (the signs behind the Glu/Asp correspond to the respective cross-linked PsaF peptide shown on the bottom of the table).ScanzdMMH+XCorrΔCnIonsSequence1497–149930.02725.63.90960.000026/56(R) LSEa20KELKTLEK27EEIQAVAEYVFK3.77970.033225/56(R) LSEEa20KELKTLEK27EIQAVAEYVFK1500–150421.52724.03.52800.000015/28(R) LSEa20KELKTLEK27EEIQAVAEYVFK3.41020.033413/28(R) LSEEa20KELKTLEK27EIQAVAEYVFK1583–158730.12597.34.31840.000028/56(R) LSEb21ELKTLEK27EEIQAVAEYVFK4.25100.015627/56(R) LSEEb21ELKTLEK27EIQAVAEYVFK1592–159521.42596.12.88090.000012/28(R) LSEEb21ELKTLEK27EIQAVAEYVFK2.83200.016912/28(R) LSEb21ELKTLEK27EEIQAVAEYVFK1532–15353–0.72384.04.61490.000029/56(R) LSEc24TLEKR28EEIQAVAEYVFK4.55290.013428/56(R) LSEEc24TLEKR28EIQAVAEYVFK1540–154320.92382.44.17990.000019/28(R) LSEc24TLEKR28EEIQAVAEYVFK4.04820.031518/28(R) LSEEc24TLEKR28EIQAVAEYVFK3.81240.087916/28(R) LSEEEc24TLEKR28IQAVAEYVFK1007–10192–0.71778.71.720.268/16(K) GAMPAWADd13AYAKLEK19R1008–101210.61777.41.130.596/16(K) GAMPAWADd13AYAKLEK19Ra 20KELKTLEK27b 21ELKTLEK27c 24TLEKR28d 13AYAKLEK19 Open table in a new tab Unfortunately, Sequest analysis did not allow for discrimination of the specific sites of cross-linking (Glu69/Glu70/Glu71 on cyt c6 or Lys20/Lys23 on PsaF for 20KELKTLEK27) and gave significant values for the different proposed products. Therefore, we manually examined the tandem mass spectra for discriminating y and b ions. We did not find specific tandem mass spectrometry fragments to discriminate between Glu69 and Glu70 for the cross-link with 20KELKTLEK27 and 21ELKTLEK27 of PsaF. However, for the peptide PsaLys20-Lys27, we found the series y′2+4-y′2+7, indicating Lys23 to be the linking residue. For the PsaF peptide 24TLEKR28 cross-linked to the cyt c6 peptide 67LSEEEIQAVAEYVFK81, we found y12+, y2+12, b3+, and b2+3 ions indicating a cross-link between Glu69 and Lys27 (see Fig. 3C). As stated above, we expected other cross-linked peptides. Therefore, we carefully re-examined other Sequest hits that were below the significance cutoff and checked their significance with an extended tandem mass spectrometry product table, including y and b ions as well as y′ and b′ ions. Indeed we found an additional cross-linking product, cyt c6-58GAMPAWADR66 cross-linked to PsaF-13AYAKLEK19, implying a cross-link between Asp65 of cyt c6 and Lys16 of PsaF. The peptide cyt c6-58GAMPAWADR66 was not found in the tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the total cross-linked peptides. However, this is not related to cross-linking efficiency but rather to a feature of the “flyability” of the peptide, because it was not detected in an tandem mass spectrometry experiment with only purified and trypsin-digested cyt c6 (data not shown). Looking at the resulting geometry of the PSI and cyt c6 cross-linked complex, it seems rather unlikely that this product is part of the proper electron transfer complex (see “Discussion”). We propose that this PSI and cyt c6 cross-linked complex corresponds to the fraction of PSI with a slower reduction half-time of 42 μs and a distorted geometry. To elucidate the electrostatic interaction between cyt c6 and PSI on the molecular level, we took advantage of chemical cross-linking, which resulted in a zero-length cross-linked complex between PsaF and cyt c6. Importantly, the cross-linked complex was competent in fast and efficient electron transfer, indicating that cross-linking conserved the authentic orientation of the electron transfer partners in the complex. Mass spectrometric analyses of tryptic peptides from the cross-linked product between cyt c6 and PsaF revealed specific interaction sites between residues Lys27 of PsaF and Glu69 of cyt c6 and between Lys23 of PsaF and Glu69/Glu70 of cyt c6. Interestingly, this identifies the Lys residues of PsaF, in particular Lys23, which are implicated in binding of pc and cyt c6, as demonstrated by the reverse genetics experiments (12Hippler M. Drepper F. Haehnel W. Rochaix J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7339-7344Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This recognition site is also consistent with pea PSI crystal structure (25Ben-Shem A. Frolow F. Nelson N. Nature. 2003; 426: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). In respect to the soluble electron donor and binding partner, this recognizes Glu69/Glu70 of cyt c6 as electrostatic partner sites. Glu69 and Glu70 are located at the “eastern face” of cyt c6. In cyanobacteria, a positively charged amino acid located at the northern face of either pc or cyt c6 is crucial for the interaction with the reaction center (19Molina-Heredia F.P. Diaz-Quintana A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13292-13297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an equivalent positively charged, exposed amino acid is present in cyt c6 from C. reinhardtii (22Kerfeld C.A. Anwar H.P. Interrante R. Merchant S. Yeates T.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 627-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although the residue on PSI interacting with this positively charged, exposed amino acid is unknown, our result demonstrates that the negatively charged residues Glu69/Glu70 of cyt c6 bind to Lys23 and Lys27 of PsaF and represent the electrostatic recognition site of eukaryotic cyt c6. In Fig. 4, we present a molecular model of the intermolecular electron transfer complex between eukaryotic cyt c6 and PSI. In this model, the distance between the redox cofactors is ∼14 Å, as estimated by Hippler et al. (10Hippler M. Reichert J. Sutter M. Zak E. Altschmied L. Schröer U. Herrmann R.G. Haehnel W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6374-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and the Glu69 and Glu70 of cyt c6 are able to form a strong salt bridge with Lys27 and Lys23 of PsaF, respectively, as the mass spectrometric data indicate. Lys20 and Lys16 form weaker salt bridges with Glu71 of cyt c6 and Glu613 of PsaB, respectively. This is in accordance with the finding that Glu613 of PsaB functions to keep the N-terminal part of PsaF in a proper position to enable an effective electron transfer complex (13Sommer F. Drepper F. Hippler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6573-6581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in this model, the mentioned conserved positive charge on the northern face of cyt c6 (Arg66) and the adjacent Asp65 can form a strong salt bridge with the pair Arg623/Asp624 of PsaB. This again is in line with the finding that, when disrupting the hydrophobic interaction area for the electron donors on PSI, plastocyanin, which lacks this additional recognition site, is more compromised in complex formation with PSI than cyt c6 (27Sommer F. Drepper F. Haehnel W. Hippler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2019106929,"Previous radiation inactivation and enzyme characterization studies demonstrated that the Streptococcus equisimilis hyaluronan synthase (seHAS) is phospholipid-dependent and that cardiolipin (CL) is the best phospholipid for enzyme activation. Here we investigated the ability of seHAS, purified in the absence of added lipid, to be activated by synthetic phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylserine, or CL lipids containing fatty acyl chains of different length or different numbers of double bonds. The most effective lipid was tetraoleoyl CL (TO-CL), whereas tetramyristoyl CL (TM-CL) was ineffective. None of the phosphatidylserine species tested gave significant activation. PAs containing C10 to C18 saturated acyl chains were not effective activators, and neither were oleoyl lyso PA, dilinoleoyl PA, or PA containing one oleoyl chain and either a palmitoyl or stearoyl chain. In contrast, dioleoyl PA stimulated seHAS ∼10-fold, to ∼20% of the activity observed with TO-CL. The tested acidic lipids such as PA and CL activated the enzyme most efficiently if they contained only oleic acid. Mixing experiments showed that the enzyme interacts preferentially with TO-CL in the presence of TM-CL. Similarly, seHAS incorporated into phosphotidylcholine-based liposomes showed increasing activity with increasing TO-CL, but not TM-CL, content. Inactivation of membrane-bound seHAS by solubilization with Nonidet P-40 was prevented by TO-CL, but not TM-CL. The pH dependence of seHAS in the presence of synthetic or naturally occurring CLs showed the same pattern of lipid preference between pH 6 and 10.5. Unexpectedly, HAS showed lipid-independent activity at pH 11.5. The results suggest that Class I HAS enzymes are lipid-dependent and that assembly of active seHAS-lipid complexes has high specificity for the phospholipid head group and the nature of the fatty acyl chains.

IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The Class I HAS enzymes are processive, and when an HA chain is released, it is no longer capable of being elongated. Typical mass ranges of HA products made by HASs are very broad and range up to 8–10 MDa. Unlike the vast majority of glycosyltransferases that make glycoside linkages at the nonreducing end, the streptococcal HASs assemble HA at the reducing end (4Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 6Bodevin-Authelet S. Kusche-Gullberg M. Pummill P.E. DeAngelis P.L. Lindahl U. J. Biol.

In this mechanism, cleavage of the UDP-HA linkage at the reducing end results in chain termination. The three streptococcal HASs, which are 417–419 amino acids long (7Kumari K. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32539-32546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 9Ward P.N. Field T.R. Ditcham W.G.F. Maguin E. Leigh J.A. Infect.

Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2037-2046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic HASs contain an additional ∼140 amino acids at the C-terminal end, which are predicted to include two MDs. Previous radiation inactivation studies (11Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Kempner E.S.

Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4239-4245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the streptococcal HASs are lipid-dependent and particularly active in the presence of cardiolipin (CL). The activity of many integral membrane enzymes is dependent on, or influenced by, a specific type of phospholipid, and there are now many cases known in which the activating lipid is CL (13Zazueta C. Ramirez J. Garcia N. Baeza I. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 191: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 18Gomez Jr., B. Robinson N.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9031-9038Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation comprise a large fraction of this group, and their ability to form large functional complexes is CL-dependent. The endoplasmic reticulum UDP-GlcNAc:dolichol phosphate, GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase is another example of an enzyme whose conformation and activity are stimulated by CL (19Chandra N.C. Doody M.B. Bretthauer R.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This glycosyltransferase makes dolichol-diphospho-GlcNAc, which is utilized in the first steps of the pathway for N-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis. CL domains within membranes have been reported in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis Marburg membranes as assessed using the fluorescent dye 10-N-nonyl-acridine orange (20Mileykovskaya E. Dowhan W. Birke R.L. Zheng D. Lutterodt L. Haines T.H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 22Kawai F. Shoda M. Harashima R. Sadaie Y. Hara H. Matsumoto K. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), which interacts with CL. Although the interaction of this dye and CL may be influenced by other factors and not uniquely specific, CL appears to enhance the formation of N-nonyl-acridine orange dimers (23Garcia Fernandez M.I. Ceccarelli D. Muscatello U. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 328: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The possible presence of CL-rich domains within cell membranes has intriguing implications for the localization and function of proteins that interact with CL tightly and specifically. In the present study, we sought to determine in more detail the phospholipid preference of seHAS either reconstituted into defined liposomes or using synthetic lipids containing known fatty acyl chains of different lengths or containing different numbers of double bonds. The results indicate that the enzyme is activated most effectively by CL, but the ability to be activated is very dependent on the nature of the particular fatty acyl chains present.

Column wash buffer contains 25 mm Na2KPO4, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DDM, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 46 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm histidine. Elution buffer was identical to wash buffer, except that the histidine concentration was 200 mm. Phosphate buffer contains 20 mm Na2KPO4, pH 7.4. Expression and Purification of seHAS—E. coli SURE™ cells containing pKK223-3 plasmid encoding seHAS, with a C-terminal His6 fusion, were grown at 30 °C in Luria broth, HAS expression was induced, and membranes containing seHAS were prepared as described earlier (12Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Clyne T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4239-4245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The membrane pellets were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.3 m glycerol and protease inhibitors, sonicated briefly, aliquoted, recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and stored at –80 °C. The extraction buffer, membrane solubilization procedure, and affinity chromatography over Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen Inc.) were described previously (12Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Clyne T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4239-4245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). After loading DDM extract, the column was washed with 10 volumes of wash buffer, and seHAS was released using 3 volumes of elution buffer. No added phospholipids were present during any stage of the purification. HAS Activity Assays—Activity of seHAS was determined in 100 μl (final volume) of assay buffer with or without phospholipids at the concentrations indicated in the figures, as described previously (12Tlapak-Simmons V.L.

Chem. 1999; 274: 4246-4253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Purified seHAS (∼0.3 μg) was added to initiate the enzyme reaction, and the mixtures were gently agitated in a Taitec MicroMixer, model E-36, at 30 °C for 60 min, or for the indicated time. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 12% (w/v) SDS and analyzed by descending paper chromatography using Whatman 3MM paper and elution with 1 m ammonium acetate, pH 5.5 (adjusted with glacial acetic acid), and 95% ethanol (7:13). The values are presented as the means ± S.E. (n = 3–4). Phospholipid Preparation—Portions of stock chloroform or ethanol solutions of each phospholipid were dried under nitrogen, resuspended in 0.05% (w/v) DDM in distilled water, and added to assay buffer to give the desired final concentration. In experiments with combinations of TM-CL and TO-CL, the two lipids were reconstituted in DDM either separately and then mixed when added to assay buffer, or the chloroform solutions were mixed prior to evaporation and resuspension in DDM. pH Dependence of seHAS Activity in the Presence of Different CLs—A modified assay buffer without sodium and potassium phosphate, UDP-sugars, or lipid was prepared at room temperature. Phosphate buffers ranging in pH from 4.5 to 12 were prepared using 500 mm solutions of phosphoric acid or mono-, di-, or tribasic potassium phosphate, which were mixed to achieve the desired final pH when diluted to 25 mm phosphate in modified assay buffer. The final pH values were measured using an Accumet model 15 pH meter. One of the four different CL preparations was then added to a final concentration of 2 mm. The purified seHAS was then added to start the reaction. Preparation of seHAS Proteoliposomes—Recombinant seHAS purified in the absence of added lipid was reconstituted into proteoliposomes containing various proportions of PC and TO (or TM as indicated) using OG and Bio-Beads SM 2, as described by Rigaud and Levy (26Rigaud J.L. Levy D. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 372: 65-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Phospholipids (50 mg) in chloroform were dried under vacuum and resuspended in 3 ml of diethyl ether. One ml of phosphate buffer was added, and the two-phase system was then sonicated on ice for 3 min at 3 W using a Sonicator Misonix 3000 with a micro tip. The organic solvent was evaporated at room temperature under reduced pressure (300–400 mm Hg). During evaporation the suspension converts into a viscous gel, which on further evaporation again forms a suspension. At this point 2 ml of phosphate buffer was added, evaporation (∼700 mm Hg) continued for ∼30 min to remove traces of solvent, and the liposome suspension was sequentially extruded through 0.4- and 0.2-μm syringe filters to produce uniformly sized liposomes. Preformed liposomes were diluted in phosphate buffer to a final concentration of 2–3 mg/ml lipid, and a 2.2-fold weight excess of detergent was added from a 10% (w/v) solution of OG in phosphate buffer. The OG-phospholipid mixture was incubated for 2 h at room temperature, the desired amount of purified seHAS was added, and the seHAS-liposome mixture was incubated for 90 min at room temperature. OG was then removed by two treatments with wet Bio-Beads, at a 30:1 (w/w) ratio of beads:OG, for 1 h at room temperature with gentle mixing on a rotating wheel. The beads were allowed to settle at 1 × g, the proteoliposome suspension was transferred and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended by pipetting up and down in phosphate buffer, and unincorporated protein was removed by recentrifugation. Final purified seHAS-proteoliposomes were resuspended in phosphate buffer, stored at 4 °C, and used within 1 week. General—Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) with the Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce), using bovine serum albumin as the standard. SDS-PAGE and Western analysis procedures were performed using the methods of Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and Burnette (29Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5847) Google Scholar), respectively. seHAS Activation by Synthetic Phospholipids—When seHAS is affinity-purified from DDM extracts of E. coli membranes in the absence of exogenous lipids, the enzyme displays very low and variable activity. The purified enzyme was greatly stimulated by mixtures of some, but not all, naturally occurring phospholipids (Fig. 5 in Ref. 12Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Clyne T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4239-4245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As noted previously, bovine CL activated seHAS, purified in the absence of added lipids, to a much greater extent than phosphatidic acid (PA), PC, phosphatidyl C0ethanolamine, phosphatidyl glycerol, phosphatidylinositol, or phosphatidylserine (PS). PS was the only other lipid that stimulated seHAS activity significantly, to a level several-fold above background and ∼25% of the activity with bovine CL. These results indicated a significant lipid dependence for the streptococcal enzyme and confirmed earlier radiation inactivation studies, in which CL was identified as a component of the active synthase (11Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Kempner E.S. Baggenstoss B.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26100-26109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To define better the fatty acyl requirements for HAS activity, we tested the abilities of well defined synthetic lipids to stimulate the activity of lipid-depleted, purified seHAS. The reference lipid in these comparisons was TO-CL, which was previously found to be a better activating lipid than crude bovine or E. coli CL preparations (24Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baron C.A. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9234-9242Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We first tested a series of synthetic PA species (Fig. 1). The activity of purified seHAS was not stimulated by 2 mm of PA variants containing two identical fatty acyl groups ranging from C10 to C18 in length (Fig. 1A). Although the enzyme was several-fold more active in the presence of PA (16:0) than the other members of this series, this level of activity was only ∼5% of that in the presence of TO-CL. Based on the activation of seHAS by CL-containing oleoyl groups, we expected PA (18:1) to be a good activating lipid, and it was by far the most effective PA variant tested (∼18% of the TO-CL-stimulated activity). PA species containing a single oleoyl chain (lyso) or with a second palmitoyl or stearyl fatty acyl chain were unable to activate seHAS (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1B shows the concentration dependence for activation of seHAS by dioleoyl PA and TO-CL and the lack of effect with dilinoleoyl PA or distearyl PA. We then tested a series of PS variants with two identical saturated fatty acyl chains ranging from C12 to C18 (Fig. 2). Although in this experiment the mean activity of seHAS in the presence of dilauroyl PS was ∼3-fold greater than in the presence of TM-CL, the results with this PS lipid were variable and not statistically different from any of the other variants tested except TO-CL. Dioleoyl PS was unable to stimulate seHAS activity (Fig. 2), in contrast to dioleoyl PA (Fig. 2). Lyso-oleoyl PS was also unable to activate the enzyme (Fig. 2). Although a naturally occurring PS mixture stimulated activity (12Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Clyne T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4239-4245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), none of the synthetic PS variants tested showed the ability to activate the enzyme. Presumably, other PS species that were not tested in this study are capable of activating HAS, or an activating contaminant (e.g. CL) may be present in some commercial PS preparations. Among the commercially available synthetic PA and CL lipids tested, the two containing only oleic acid were consistently capable of activating purified seHAS (TO-CL ≫ dioleoyl PA). Dilinoleoyl PA and distearoyl PA showed inconsistent and low levels of stimulation, and some of this variability, as noted above, is likely due to the presence of variable amounts of endogenous tightly bound annular lipids still associated with seHAS (i.e. not removed by the purification procedure). seHAS Preferentially Interacts with TO-CL Compared with TM-CL—If seHAS and multiple CL molecules form discrete, specific complexes, then the way in which lipid is presented to the lipid-depleted enzyme might affect the kinetics of forming active HAS-lipid complexes and affect the experimental results. To assess this possible complication, the abilities of the above lipids (as well as TM-CL, bovine CL, and E. coli CL) to activate seHAS were tested using two different protocols. In the standard assay, the enzyme is added last to assay buffer containing substrates and lipid. If enzyme and lipid require substantial time to interact to achieve seHAS activation, then a lag time would occur under these conditions; in this case, a preincubation of enzyme and lipid, prior to the addition of substrate, should decrease such a lag. When this was tested (Fig. 3), in all but one case (with E. coli CL), seHAS activity was actually greater under the standard conditions, without a 30-min pre-treatment. This result indicates that seHAS and phospholipids interact quickly, with no apparent kinetic lag, to form enzyme complexes. An important feature of a lipid requirement for any enzyme is whether the enzyme interaction with preferred lipid is much more favored, and therefore more specific, than for other lipids that are not capable of activating the enzyme. Is the enzyme capable of binding many different types of lipids with relatively little difference in the energetics of binding each lipid, or is there great specificity (presumably indicating a greater Keq) for the activating lipid? Since two synthetic CL species were available with dramatically different abilities to activate seHAS, we performed mixing experiments to test whether the purified enzyme was more readily able to interact with the activating TO-CL compared with the inactive TM-CL. In the first experiment (Fig. 4), seHAS was mixed with either 1 mm TM-CL or 1 mm TO-CL and increasing amounts of the second CL species. If TM-CL was fixed at 1 mm, then seHAS activity was initially very low as expected but increased sharply as the TO-CL concentration increased from 0.25 to 1 mm. TO-CL was able to activate seHAS in the presence of a greater or equal concentration of TM-CL. In contrast, when the fixed lipid was TO-CL, the addition of TM-CL, even up to 2 mm, did not decrease the ability of TO-CL to activate seHAS. These results indicate that seHAS interacts preferentially with TO-CL compared with TM-CL. In a second kinetic experiment (Fig. 5), we assessed the affects on the rate of HA synthesis of 1 mm TO-CL or TM-CL alone or as mixtures of the two CL species. The behavior of the enzyme was different depending on whether the two lipids were premixed and dried from organic solvent before aqueous suspension (Fig. 5A) or were mixed separately from aqueous suspensions (Fig. 5B). The activity of seHAS in the presence of either TM-CL or TO-CL alone was not affected by the method of lipid preparation (Fig. 5, solid circles and squares). When the lipids were premixed prior to suspension, the addition of 1 mm TM-CL had no effect on the rate of seHAS activity in the presence of 1 mm TO-CL (Fig. 5A, open circles), consistent with the results in Fig. 4. However, the enzyme was less active in this same lipid mixture when the lipids were presented to the protein as separate aqueous suspensions (Fig. 5B, open circles). Interestingly, after a lag time of ∼20–25 min, the steady-state rate of HA synthesis in the presence of the two CL species was identical to that with TO-CL alone. These results indicate that when the two lipids are presented as a mixture from separate aqueous suspensions, seHAS interacts with each of the CL species (e.g. as micelles or liposomes) in a kinetically different way. The protein-lipid interactions are dynamic (i.e. kinetically reversible), and the interaction with TO-CL is probably more favorable thermodynamically than with TM-CL. seHAS Shows the Same Order of CL Preference between pH 6 and 10.5—In a previous characterization of the purified seHAS, we noted an unusually broad pH range for enzyme activity, from pH 6 to pH 10.5–11.0 (24Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baron C.A. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9234-9242Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because this result was obtained in the presence of BCL, we wanted to determine whether the enzyme behaved any differently with the more effectively activating TO-CL or whether the inability of TM-CL to activate seHAS was pH-dependent (Fig. 6A). As expected, lipid-depleted purified seHAS had very low activity with TM-CL from pH 4.5 to 10.5, although a very small peak of activity was observed between pH 7.5 and 8.5. The bovine, E. coli, and TO-CL preparations showed the same overall pattern of pH dependence, and their order of effectiveness did not change with pH. In each case, an interesting multi-component profile was observed between pH 6 and 10.5 showing two distinct peaks with maximum activities at pH ∼7.5–8 and pH 9–10. This result was observed in three independent experiments, although the decreased activity observed in the region at pH 8.5 was variable. In all cases, the enzyme was essentially inactive at pH 10.5, but another small peak of activity was found between pH 11 and 12, an unusually high pH for retention of enzyme activity. The results show that the lipid requirement for seHAS activity and the preference for TO-CL are still present and consistent over a broad range between pH 6 and pH ∼10.5. seHAS Becomes Lipid-independent above pH 11—The additional peak of enzyme activity seen in Fig. 6A above pH 10.5–11 was unexpected and seemed unusual. This activity was reproducible, but on further examination, we found that phospholipids were not required at this very high pH for seHAS to make HA (Fig. 6B). Treatment with Streptomyces hyaluronidase verified that the enzyme synthesized normal HA products (not shown). In multiple experiments, the level of HAS activity at pH 11.5 without lipid ranged up to ∼10% of that at pH 7.6 with BCL. Lipid Dependence of seHAS Incorporated into Proteoliposomes—We next wanted to characterize the lipid dependence of seHAS incorporated into liposomes of defined size and composition. Proteoliposomes were prepared by disrupting preformed PC-based liposomes with OG, adding purified seHAS, and then removing the detergent. Transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 7A) showed single intact liposomes of relatively uniform size (∼50 nm). To determine the efficiency of seHAS incorporation into liposomes, the protein remaining in the supernatant after ultracentrifugation was precipitated using trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig. 7B). Only trace amounts of seHAS were detected in the supernatant after centrifugation, demonstrating that essentially complete incorporation of purified recombinant seHAS protein into liposomes was achieved. Consistent with the above and previous (12Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Clyne T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4239-4245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) results, seHAS had little or no activity in proteoliposomes containing only PC (not shown). We then tested the effect of different total lipid-to-protein molar ratios on seHAS activity in proteoliposomes containing TO-CL. When liposomes were prepared with a constant PC:TO-CL molar ratio (4:1) and different amounts of purified seHAS, enzyme activity increased with increasing protein-to-lipid ratios (Fig. 7C). To assess whether seHAS showed the same specific activation by TO-CL in proteoliposomes as in the above experiments, we varied the TO-CL:PC molar ratio, while keeping the lipid-to-protein molar ratio constant. As a control to assess the potential activity of the enzyme, we assayed the activity of seHAS in proteoliposomes in the presence or absence of 2 mm BCL. seHAS showed much higher activity in liposomes produced using a 1:1 molar ratio rather than a 1:2 ratio of TO-CL:PC (Fig. 8A). Inclusion of exogenous BCL had a strong stimulatory effect on seHAS activity if the liposome TO-CL content was 33 mol % but did not further increase the enzyme activity when the TO-CL content was 50 mol %. This result indicates that proteoliposomes with a PC-to-TO-CL molar ratio of 1:1 provide sufficient opportunity for seHAS to be activated optimally by TO-CL (or conversely, to be not inhibited by interaction with PC). This finding was valid for proteoliposome preparations with a range of seHAS-to-lipid molar ratios (Fig. 8B). If purified seHAS was reconstituted in a similar way using proteoliposomes containing TM-CL, rather than TO-CL, the enzyme showed little or no activity (not shown). TO-CL Rescues the Activity of Detergent-solubilized seHAS—Finally, we examined the ability of TM-CL or TO-CL to prevent the apparently irreversible inactivation of HAS that typically occurs during extraction with nonionic detergents (Fig. 9). Based on a titration experiment (not shown) to assess the sensitivity of membrane-b"

We previously described the effects of overexpression cyclin D1, D2 or D3 in mouse epidermis and tumor development. We now asked whether cyclin D2 and/or cyclin D3 play a relevant role in ras-dependent tumorigenesis. Here, we described the effect of cyclin D3 and cyclin D2 overexpression in mouse skin tumor development. Notably, overexpression of cyclin D3 results in reduced tumor development and malignant progression to squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). Biochemical analysis of keratinocytes shows that overexpression of cyclin D3 results in strong reduction of cyclin D2 and its associated kinase activity. Furthermore, we found that reinstatement of cyclin D2 level in the cyclin D3/cyclin D2 bigenic mice results in a complete reversion of the inhibitory action of cyclin D3. Supporting these results, ablation of cyclin D2 results in reduced tumorigenesis and malignant progression. On the other hand, overexpression of cyclin D2 results in an increased number of papillomas and malignant progression. We conclude that cyclin D3 and cyclin D2 play opposite roles in mouse skin tumor development and that the suppressive activity of cyclin D3 is associated with cyclin D2 downregulation."

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12664-12672Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The MiDAS is a structurally independent domain that dimerizes efficiently to yield homogeneous monomer and dimer populations in vitro. The MiDAS RNA dimerizes under biologically relevant conditions of both temperature and ionic environment, in the absence of proteins. Moreover, RNAs spanning sequences closely related to the MiDAS are sufficient to mediate RNA dimerization and encapsidation in vivo when inserted into nonviral mRNAs (3Hibbert C.S. Mirro J. Rein A.

Thus, the MiDAS domain is an important system for studying retroviral RNA dimerization as it contains all of the RNA sequence elements required for the high selectivity and affinity of this process both in vitro and in vivo. Structures of the MiDAS domain for MuSV in the monomeric starting state and in the final dimer state have been mapped at single nucleotide resolution using selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) (15Badorrek C.S.

The two stem-loops, SL1 and SL2, contain conserved GACG tetraloops (19Konings D.A. Nash M.A. Maizel J.V. Arlinghaus R.B. J.

Similarly, stable stem-loop motifs, terminating in GACG tetraloops, are prominent features for at least two retroviral genera, the gamma retroviruses (19Konings D.A. Nash M.A. Maizel J.V. Arlinghaus R.B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 632-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the nonprimate lentiviruses (29Monie T.P. Greatorex J.S. Maynard-Smith L. Hook B.D. Bishop N. Beales L.P. Lever A.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 294-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Understanding the relative structural contributions of self-complementary and GACG stem-loop domains is essential to develop models for the broad organizing principles of RNA genome structure and the ability of retroviruses to function as simple diploid entities in biology. Significant conformational changes occur in each of the three PAL1, PAL2, and SL1-SL2 domain structural building blocks during dimerization (15Badorrek C.S. Weeks K.M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 17Badorrek C.S. Weeks K.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12664-12672Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Tounekti N. Mougel M.

Biol. 1999; 291: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). PAL1 resides in a stem-loop structure in the monomer state and forms an extended intermolecular duplex involving both genomic RNA strands in the dimer (Fig. 1, green sequences). PAL2 is relatively unstructured in the MiDAS monomer and lies in a flexible domain that is connected to the rest of the RNA via a stable anchoring helix (Fig. 1A, shaded box) (15Badorrek C.S. Weeks K.M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Upon dimerization, the unstructured PAL2 sequences from two monomers also form an extended intermolecular duplex (Fig. 1, red sequences). As the PAL2 intermolecular duplex forms, the anchoring helix characteristic of the monomer state melts (Fig. 1B, shaded boxes) (17Badorrek C.S. Weeks K.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12664-12672Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). At the 3′ end of the MiDAS, SL1 and SL2 form cross-strand loop-loop interactions involving conventional G-C base pairs and additional noncanonical interactions (26Kim C. Tinoco I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9396-9401Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) with SL2′ and SL1′ sequences, respectively, from the second RNA strand (Fig. 1, orange sequences). During dimerization, SL1 also extends by 4 bp (Fig. 1B, black box) (16Badorrek C.S. Gherghe C.M. Weeks K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13640-13645Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). When this conformational change occurs, the SL1-SL2 domain forms a compactly folded and high affinity tertiary structure domain (16Badorrek C.S. Gherghe C.M. Weeks K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13640-13645Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Formation of the PAL2 intermolecular duplex and extension of SL1 in the dimer state both require disruption of the anchoring helix. Thus, PAL2 and SL1-SL2 domain interactions are potentially coupled during dimerization. We analyze the contribution of each of these key structural features to the stability of the MuSV genomic RNA dimer. In the context of the MiDAS domain, the SL1-SL2 domain interaction makes the largest contribution to overall thermodynamic stability in the dimer. PAL1 and PAL2 form 10- and 16-bp duplexes in the dimer and, as isolated structural elements, would be expected to have large thermodynamic stabilities of up to -15 kcal/mol. Surprisingly, the net thermodynamic increment for forming either the PAL1 or PAL2 intermolecular duplex in the dimer is small. We infer that the free energy released upon formation of either extended duplex in the dimer is almost exactly balanced by the energetic cost to break pre-existing interactions in the starting monomer structure. These data indicate that the highly conserved ability to form intermolecular duplexes in retroviral RNA genomes may be more important for retroviral processes such as modulating protein-binding sites or regulating dimerization kinetics than simply stabilizing the dimer state. Retroviral RNA Constructs—DNA templates for in vitro transcription of the native and mutant MiDAS RNA constructs (PAL1Stb, PAL2Del, Stb-Del, AA/AA) were generated by PCR from the pLNBS (30Ly H. Nierlich D. Olsen J. Kaplan A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 7255-7261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) plasmid or from synthetic oligonucleotide (Midland) templates. RNA constructs were generated by T7 RNA polymerase-mediated transcription (200 μl, 37 °C, 6 h; containing 80 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 40 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 mm spermidine, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm each nucleoside triphosphate, ∼10 μg of PCR-generated template, 200 units of SUPERase-In (Ambion), and 0.07 mg/ml polymerase). Internally labeled RNAs were generated using 25 μCi of [α-32P]ATP and 0.5 mm unlabeled ATP. RNAs were purified by denaturing gel electrophoresis (8% (w/v) polyacrylamide, 7 m urea), excised from the gel, eluted overnight (into 0.5 m sodium acetate (pH 6.0), 1 mm EDTA; 4 °C), concentrated by ethanol precipitation, and stored in TE (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA) at -20 °C. Equilibrium Dimerization Affinities—All dimerization reactions were performed at 37 °C and under an approximately physiological ion environment (200 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5). Internally 32P-labeled RNA (0.05 nm) was combined with the identical unlabeled RNA (at 0.1-300 nm) in 6.4 μl. RNAs were denatured at 90 °C, snap-cooled on ice for 3 min, treated with 3.2 μl of 5× dimer buffer (250 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 m potassium acetate (pH 7.5), 25 mm MgCl2) (15Badorrek C.S. Weeks K.M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and 6.4 μl of loading dye (30% glycerol, 0.01% xylene cyanol, and bromphenol blue), and incubated at 37 °C for either 2 or 8 h. Monomer and dimer forms were resolved on nondenaturing gels (8% polyacrylamide, 1× TBE) run at a gel temperature of 25 °C (1 h at 7 watts). RNAs were also resolved in gel and running buffers containing 5 mm MgCl2. Gels were pre-run for 20 min prior to loading, and the running buffer was re-equilibrated every 10 min to maintain uniform ion concentrations. Monomer and dimer species were visualized by phosphorimaging, and the dimerization dissociation constant (Kdimer) was obtained by fitting to Equation 1, A4CT((Kdimer+4CT)-Kdimer2+8KdimerCT)(Eq. 1) where A is the fraction dimer at saturating RNA concentrations and CT is the total concentration of RNA. SHAPE Analysis of Native and Mutant Dimers—SHAPE experiments were performed on native or mutant MiDAS RNAs that contained a 3′ nonviral RNA cassette that provides an efficient DNA primer binding site (31Merino E.J. Wilkinson K.A. Coughlan J.L. Weeks K.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 4223-4231Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), linked to the MiDAS RNA via an AAAU sequence. Control experiments showed that introduction of the 3′ cassette had no effect on dimerization affinities. The MiDAS RNA construct (9 pmol) was heated at 90 °C for 3 min in 2.7 μl of water, cooled on ice, and treated with 1.8 μl of 5× dimerization buffer at 37 °C for 2 h. The RNA solution was then treated with 1 μl of NMIA (100 mm in anhydrous DMSO) and allowed to react for 45 min (∼4 half-lives) (31Merino E.J. Wilkinson K.A. Coughlan J.L. Weeks K.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 4223-4231Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 32Wilkinson K.A. Merino E.J. Weeks K.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 4659-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Primer Extension—DNA primers were complementary to the 3′ end of the RNA structure cassette (5′-GAA CCG GAC CGA AGC CCG-3′) or to SL1 (5′-CAG AAC TCG TCA GTT CCA CCA-3′) (15Badorrek C.S. Weeks K.M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). NMIA-modified RNA (2 μl, 1.8 pmol) was annealed to a 5′-32P-labeled DNA primer (1 μl, 1 pmol) in 12 μl total volume and incubated at 60 (6 min) and 35 °C (10 min). Reverse transcription buffer (7 μl; 143 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.4), 214 mm potassium acetate, 7.14 mm MgCl2, 1.43 mm each dNTP, 14.3 mm dithiothreitol) was added, and subsequent primer extension steps were performed as described (15Badorrek C.S. Weeks K.M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 33Wilkinson K.A. Merino E.J. Weeks K.M. Nat. Protocols. 2006; 1 (in press)Crossref Scopus (550) Google Scholar), using ThermoScript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 50 °C. cDNA fragments were resolved on a series of 14% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels to achieve nucleotide resolution throughout the analyzed region. Band intensities were quantified using semi-automated footprinting analysis software (34Das R. Laederach A. Pearlman S.M. Herschlag D. Altman R.B. RNA (N. Y.). 2005; 11: 344-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). SHAPE reactivity data for the mutants were normalized to that of the native MiDAS using nucleotide 314 for PAL1Stb and nucleotide 319 for the PAL2Del and Stb-Del mutants. Free Energy Calculations—RNAstructure (35Mathews D.H. Disney M.D. Childs J.L. Schroeder S.J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7287-7292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar) was used to estimate the change in free energy associated with formation of the PAL1 and PAL2 intermolecular duplexes relative to the structures these sequences form in the monomeric initial state (illustrated in Scheme 1). Structures for PAL1 and PAL2 in the monomer state were obtained using strong and moderate SHAPE reactivities to constrain single-stranded nucleotides (15Badorrek C.S. Weeks K.M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). PAL1 stability was calculated for nucleotides 205-227. PAL2 stability was estimated for nucleotides 244-299, as the mean folding free energy for three postulated (15Badorrek C.S. Weeks K.M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) interconverting structures in the 231-315 domain and subtracting the free energy of the anchoring duplex (nucleotides 231-243/300-315). Stabilities for the PAL1 and PAL2 intermolecular duplexes in the dimer state were estimated using the bimolecular folding mode in RNAstructure (35Mathews D.H. Disney M.D. Childs J.L. Schroeder S.J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7287-7292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Incremental Dissociation Constants for Individual Dimerization Steps—For the dimerization step involving SL1-SL2 domain interactions, the dimerization constant K1 was measured directly as the affinity of the Stb-Del mutant. For steps involving SL1-SL2 interactions plus either PAL1 or PAL2 formation, K2 and K2′ were calculated from Kdimer for the PAL2Del and PAL1Stb mutants, respectively, as Kdimer = K1K2. For the third step, K3 and K3′ were calculated from Kdimer for dimerization of the native MiDAS, Kdimer = K1K2K3. Free energies for each dimerization step were calculated as ΔG =-RT ln(1/Kx) at 37°C. Strategy—To quantify the energetic contribution of each element of the MiDAS RNA to stability of the retroviral dimer, we constructed mutants that compromise precisely each of the three primary contributors to dimerization: PAL1, PAL2, and the SL1-SL2 domain (Fig. 2). The ability of PAL1 to form an intermolecular duplex in the dimer was abolished by stabilizing the PAL1 stem-loop in its monomer form to make the PAL1Stb mutant (Fig. 2A). PAL2 was compromised by a 12-nucleotide deletion in the PAL2Del mutant (Fig. 2B, dashed line). This deletion completely abrogates PAL2 intermolecular duplex formation but does not cause significant structural changes in other parts of the MiDAS RNA monomer (15Badorrek C.S. Weeks K.M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We also constructed a PAL1Stb-PAL2Del double mutant, Stb-Del, that eliminates both PAL1 and PAL2 duplexes in the dimer (Fig. 2C). Two SL1-SL2 domains form an extensive tertiary interface mediated by loop-loop interactions involving the GACG sequences in the apical loops (26Kim C. Tinoco I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9396-9401Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and by interdigitated interactions between closely packed U-shaped SL1-SL2 motifs (16Badorrek C.S. Gherghe C.M. Weeks K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13640-13645Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). SL1 from one RNA interacts with SL2′ from the second strand (16Badorrek C.S. Gherghe C.M. Weeks K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13640-13645Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). No simple, compact mutation can completely disrupt this tertiary interface; however, we selectively disrupted the loop-loop component of the SL1-SL2 domain tertiary structure by converting the conserved GACG sequence in the apical tetraloops to GAAA (Fig. 2D, AA/AA mutant). GAAA sequences form a stable local loop structure but cannot form strong cross-strand loop-loop interactions. The double loop mutant also prevents noncognate SL1-SL1′ or SL2-SL2′ interactions from forming (16Badorrek C.S. Gherghe C.M. Weeks K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13640-13645Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Dimerization Affinities for Native and Mutant MiDAS RNAs—An important feature of the MiDAS domain is that dimerization does not require extreme temperature or solution conditions. Dimerization proceeds efficiently at 37 °C and at roughly physiological ionic strength (200 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.5)). This well behaved dimerization activity appears to reflect that inhibitory RNA sequences are absent in the MiDAS domain. Both native and mutant RNAs form homogeneous monomer and dimer species as judged by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3). Exploratory work showed that RNA dimers in which either the PAL1 or PAL2 intermolecular duplex has formed can be detected by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, both in the presence and absence of Mg2+. Dimerization at the SL1-SL2 domain specifically requires the presence of Mg2+ in the gel and running buffer in order to be detected during electrophoresis. Thus, dimerization for all RNA constructs was visualized in both Mg2+-free and Mg2+-containing gels (Fig. 3, A and B). Dimerization reactions were performed as a function of RNA concentration, and apparent dimerization dissociation constants (Kdimer) decrease by 3-fold or less when the equilibration period is extended from 2 to 8 h. We therefore take the 8-h value as a good approximation for fully equilibrated retroviral RNA dimers. The native MiDAS RNA forms a very high affinity dimer, independent of the presence of Mg2+ in the gel. Kdimer values are 0.39 and 0.22 nm, as visualized in gels run in the absence and presence of Mg2+, respectively (Fig. 3, C and D, open and closed circles). We then evaluated the thermodynamic contribution of the SL1-SL2 domain to dimer formation using the AA/AA mutant in which native loop-loop interactions are disrupted. Dimerization affinities are similar, independent of whether Mg2+ is present in the gel. However, dimerization is weakened by ∼100-fold relative to the native sequence (Kdimer = 20 nm; Fig. 3, open and closed squares). Thus, the SL1-SL2 domain is a significant contributor to the stability and structure of the dimer state. In contrast, the PAL1Stb and PAL2Del RNA variants, which eliminate the ability to form either PAL1 or PAL2, dimerize with affinities that are within 2.5-fold of that for the wild type (Fig. 3, triangles and inverted triangles). These data indicate that formation of either the PAL1 or PAL2 intermolecular duplex makes a very small contribution to the stability of the dimer if the SL1-SL2 domain is present. We next evaluated the dimerization activity of the Stb-Del mutant, in which both PAL1 and PAL2 are compromised. This RNA is only capable of dimerizing by forming interactions in the SL1-SL2 domain, including via cross-strand loop-loop base pairs at the GACG tetraloops (see Fig. 1). Dimer stability is strongly dependent on whether Mg2+ is present during nondenaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3, A and B, Stb-Del panels). Formation of a dimer species is barely detectable in gels run in the absence of Mg2+ (apparent Kdimer ∼ 4.2 μm), whereas stable dimer formation is readily detected in Mg2+-containing gels and is characterized by a Kdimer of 25 nm. These results demonstrate that two SL1-SL2 domains form a high affinity interaction that is strongly dependent on the presence of Mg2+. In the presence of the stable Mg2+-mediated SL1-SL2 domain interaction, PAL1 and PAL2 each then make small additional contributions to dimer stability. Structural Analysis of Dimers—We explored the specific structural differences in the dimers formed by the PAL1Stb, PAL2Del, and Stb-Del mutants using single nucleotide resolution RNA SHAPE analysis (31Merino E.J. Wilkinson K.A. Coughlan J.L. Weeks K.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 4223-4231Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 32Wilkinson K.A. Merino E.J. Weeks K.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 4659-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In the SHAPE approach, an RNA is treated with a strongly electrophilic reagent, NMIA, that reacts preferentially with 2′-hydroxyl groups in conformationally flexible nucleotides. Flexible nucleotides react to form 2′-O-ester adducts, which are then detected as stops to reverse transcriptase-mediated primer extension. The secondary structure of the MiDAS region in the dimer state was recently established by SHAPE (17Badorrek C.S. Weeks K.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12664-12672Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We confirmed the secondary structure of our MiDAS dimer by subjecting the native dimer RNA to 2′-O-esterification and detecting cDNA products in a sequencing gel (Fig. 4A). Absolute SHAPE reactivities were calculated by subtracting background band intensities observed for reactions omitting NMIA from those obtained in the presence of the reagent (Fig. 4B). Local nucleotide flexibility information was obtained for almost every position in the MiDAS RNA. The nucleotides comprising the PAL1 and PAL2 intermolecular duplexes are uniformly unreactive toward SHAPE chemistry (Fig. 4C). SL1 and SL2 form stable stem-loop structures connected by a flexible two-nucleotide linker (nucleotides 353-354). The PAL1, PAL2, and SL1-SL2 domain structures are then connected by two highly reactive, and therefore flexible, linker regions (nucleotides 220-282 and 299-309; Fig. 4, B and C). SHAPE analysis thus strongly supports the secondary structure model for the dimer state shown in Fig. 4C. SHAPE Analysis of MiDAS Mutants—Absolute nucleotide reactivities were also obtained for the PAL1Stb, PAL2Del, and Stb-Del mutants using SHAPE chemistry. Structural differences that distinguish each mutant from the native sequence in the dimer state can be evaluated in a straightforward way using reactivity histograms (Fig. 5). SHAPE reactivity for the native sequence is gray and reactivities for the mutants are shown in color in Fig. 5. Higher and lower reactivities for a mutant at a given position indicate that the mutant sequence is more flexible or more constrained, respectively, relative to wild type. The reactivity profile for the PAL1Stb variant superimposes very closely with that for the wild type sequence over nearly the entire length of the MiDAS domain (Fig. 5A, compare red and gray lines). The most significant difference is the 2-fold reduced reactivity of nucleotide 221 in the PAL1 stem at the 5′ end of the RNA, indicating that this position is more constrained in the PAL1Stb mutant. The observed low reactivity at nucleotide 221 reflects the duplex stabilizing effect of the mutation introduced at this position (Fig. 2A). The primer extension reaction also records the increased stability of the PAL1 stem-loop in an indirect way, because the stabilized PAL1 structure yields a prominent stop to primer extension by the reverse transcriptase enzyme (nucleotides 223-229; Fig. 5A, dashed line). Thus, SHAPE analysis indicates that the PAL1Stb mutant folds to a dimer structure that is very similar to that of the native sequence, except that PAL1 remains in its monomeric conformation, embedded in a stem-loop (Fig. 6A). The PAL2Del mutation was shown previously to induce only relatively minor changes to the structure of the monomer state. The PAL2Del is compatible with the monomer conformation because PAL2 lies in the middle of a large flexible domain (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the PAL2Del mutation introduces many changes to the structure of the final dimer (Fig. 5B, compare green and gray histograms). The most important structural differences lie in three distinct regions in the PAL2Del mutant RNA. Positions 231-249 and 305-314 span the anchoring helix and are 2-10-fold less reactive in the mutant than in the native dimer. Next, nucleotides 317-318 and 351 are 3-5-fold more reactive in the mutant, consistent with a model in which SL1 remains in the shorter, monomer-like conformation for this stem-loop (see Fig. 1A). Finally, nucleotides 265-268, 287-288, and 303 in the PAL2 sequence and in other parts of the flexible domain are 3-12-fold more reactive in the mutant, consistent with failure to form the PAL2 helix. Together, the comparative SHAPE reactivity information is consistent with a secondary structure model for the PAL2Del dimer in which the PAL1, but"

Bcl-X(L) expression is rapidly induced by a wide range of survival signals and many cancer cells constitutively express high levels. The Bcl-X gene has a complex organization with multiple promoters giving rise to RNAs with alternate 5' non-coding exons. Here we have investigated the mechanisms that control basal and induced expression of Bcl-X(L) in B-lymphoma cells. Antisense experiments demonstrated that Bcl-X(L) was essential for survival of Akata6 B-lymphoma cells. The levels of RNAs containing the IB Bcl-X non-coding exon, derived from the distal 1B promoter, correlated with basal expression of Bcl-X(L) in primary malignant B cells and this promoter was highly active in B-cell lines. The activity of this promoter was largely dependent on a single Ets binding site and Ets family proteins were bound at this promoter in intact cells. CD40 ligand (CD40L)-induced cell survival was associated with increased Bcl-X(L) expression and accumulation of exon IA-containing RNAs, derived from the proximal 1A promoter. Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) inhibition prevented induction of Bcl-X(L) protein and exon IA-containing RNAs by CD40L. Therefore, the distal Bcl-X 1B promoter plays a critical role in driving constitutive expression-mediated via Ets family proteins in malignant B cells, whereas NF-kappaB plays a central role in the induction of Bcl-X(L) in response to CD40 signalling via the proximal 1A promoter."

In this study we have identified a region of the disintegrin elegantin, termed the ""linker domain"" (amino acids 38-47), with inhibitory activity toward α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-mediated cell adhesion on fibronectin (Fn). Using a chimeric structure-function approach in which sequences of the functionally distinct disintegrin kistrin were introduced into the elegantin template at targeted sites, a loss of inhibitory function toward α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-mediated adhesion on Fn was observed when the elegantin linker domain was substituted.
