https://openalex.org/W2504691963,"GNPS is an open-access community-curated analysis platform for sharing natural product mass spectrometry data that enables continuous, automatic reanalysis of deposited 'living' data sets. The potential of the diverse chemistries present in natural products (NP) for biotechnology and medicine remains untapped because NP databases are not searchable with raw data and the NP community has no way to share data other than in published papers. Although mass spectrometry (MS) techniques are well-suited to high-throughput characterization of NP, there is a pressing need for an infrastructure to enable sharing and curation of data. We present Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS; http://gnps.ucsd.edu ), an open-access knowledge base for community-wide organization and sharing of raw, processed or identified tandem mass (MS/MS) spectrometry data. In GNPS, crowdsourced curation of freely available community-wide reference MS libraries will underpin improved annotations. Data-driven social-networking should facilitate identification of spectra and foster collaborations. We also introduce the concept of 'living data' through continuous reanalysis of deposited data."
https://openalex.org/W2507421003,"Prescription drug abuse is a growing problem nationally. In an effort to curb this problem, emergency physicians might rely on subjective cues such as race-ethnicity, often unknowingly, when prescribing opioids for pain-related complaints, especially for conditions that are often associated with drug-seeking behavior. Previous studies that examined racial-ethnic disparities in opioid dispensing at emergency departments (EDs) did not differentiate between prescriptions at discharge and drug administration in the ED. We examined racial-ethnic disparities in opioid prescription at ED visits for pain-related complaints often associated with drug-seeking behavior and contrasted them with conditions objectively associated with pain. We hypothesized a priori that racial-ethnic disparities will be present among opioid prescriptions for conditions associated with non-medical use, but not for objective pain-related conditions. Using data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey for 5 years (2007-2011), the odds of opioid prescription during ED visits made by non-elderly adults aged 18-65 for 'non-definitive' conditions (toothache, back pain and abdominal pain) or 'definitive' conditions (long-bone fracture and kidney stones) were modeled. Opioid prescription at discharge and opioid administration at the ED were the primary outcomes. We found significant racial-ethnic disparities, with non-Hispanic Blacks being less likely (adjusted odds ratio ranging from 0.56-0.67, p-value < 0.05) to receive opioid prescription at discharge during ED visits for back pain and abdominal pain, but not for toothache, fractures and kidney stones, compared to non-Hispanic whites after adjusting for other covariates. Differential prescription of opioids by race-ethnicity could lead to widening of existing disparities in health, and may have implications for disproportionate burden of opioid abuse among whites. The findings have important implications for medical provider education to include sensitization exercises towards their inherent biases, to enable them to consciously avoid these biases from defining their practice behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2481564434,"Recent studies have shown that myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced necrosis can be controlled by multiple genes. In this study, we observed that both strands (5p and 3p) of miR-223 were remarkably dysregulated in mouse hearts upon I/R. Precursor miR-223 (pre-miR-223) transgenic mouse hearts exhibited better recovery of contractile performance over reperfusion period and lesser degree of myocardial necrosis than wild type hearts upon ex vivo and in vivo myocardial ischemia. Conversely, pre-miR-223 knock-out (KO) mouse hearts displayed opposite effects. Furthermore, we found that the RIP1/RIP3/MLKL necroptotic pathway and inflammatory response were suppressed in transgenic hearts, whereas they were activated in pre-miR-223 KO hearts upon I/R compared with wild type controls. Accordingly, treatment of pre-miR-223 KO mice with necrostatin-1s, a potent necroptosis inhibitor, significantly decreased I/R-triggered cardiac necroptosis, infarction size, and dysfunction. Mechanistically, we identified two critical cell death receptors, TNFR1 and DR6, as direct targets of miR-223-5p, whereas miR-223-3p directly suppressed the expression of NLRP3 and IκB kinase α, two important mediators known to be involved in I/R-induced inflammation and cell necroptosis. Our findings indicate that miR-223-5p/-3p duplex works together and cooperatively inhibits I/R-induced cardiac necroptosis at multiple layers. Thus, pre-miR-223 may constitute a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of ischemic heart disease."
https://openalex.org/W2523411829,"The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) system orchestrates cellular responses to hypoxia in animals. HIF is an α/β-heterodimeric transcription factor that regulates the expression of hundreds of genes in a tissue context-dependent manner. The major hypoxia-sensing component of the HIF system involves oxygen-dependent catalysis by the HIF hydroxylases; in humans there are three HIF prolyl hydroxylases (PHD1–3) and an asparaginyl hydroxylase (factor-inhibiting HIF (FIH)). PHD catalysis regulates HIFα levels, and FIH catalysis regulates HIF activity. How differences in HIFα hydroxylation status relate to variations in the induction of specific HIF target gene transcription is unknown. We report studies using small molecule HIF hydroxylase inhibitors that investigate the extent to which HIF target gene expression is induced by PHD or FIH inhibition. The results reveal substantial differences in the role of prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation in regulating hypoxia-responsive genes in cells. PHD inhibitors with different structural scaffolds behave similarly. Under the tested conditions, a broad-spectrum 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase inhibitor is a better mimic of the overall transcriptional response to hypoxia than the selective PHD inhibitors, consistent with an important role for FIH in the hypoxic transcriptional response. Indeed, combined application of selective PHD and FIH inhibitors resulted in the transcriptional induction of a subset of genes not fully responsive to PHD inhibition alone. Thus, for the therapeutic regulation of HIF target genes, it is important to consider both PHD and FIH activity, and in the case of some sets of target genes, simultaneous inhibition of the PHDs and FIH catalysis may be preferable.

https://openalex.org/W2480807373,"Starch synthesis in cereal grain endosperm is dependent on the concerted actions of many enzymes. The starch plastidial phosphorylase (Pho1) plays an important role in the initiation of starch synthesis and in the maturation of starch granule in developing rice seeds. Prior evidence has suggested that the rice enzyme, OsPho1, may have a physical/functional interaction with other starch biosynthetic enzymes. Pulldown experiments showed that OsPho1 as well as OsPho1 devoid of its L80 region, a peptide unique to higher plant phosphorylases, captures disproportionating enzyme (OsDpe1). Interaction of the latter enzyme form with OsDpe1 indicates that the putative regulatory L80 is not responsible for multienzyme assembly. This heterotypic enzyme complex, determined at a molar ratio of 1:1, was validated by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation studies of native seed proteins and by co-elution chromatographic and co-migration electrophoretic patterns of these enzymes in rice seed extracts. The OsPho1-OsDpe1 complex utilized a broader range of substrates for enhanced synthesis of larger maltooligosaccharides than each individual enzyme and significantly elevated the substrate affinities of OsPho1 at 30 °C. Moreover, the assembly with OsDpe1 enables OsPho1 to utilize products of transglycosylation reactions involving G1 and G3, sugars that it cannot catalyze directly.

In higher plants starch phosphorylase (Pho1, EC 2.4.1.1) consists of two isoforms, Pho1 and Pho2, located in separate intracellular compartments. Pho1 is located in the plastid, whereas Pho2 is distributed to the cytoplasm (1Shimomura S. Nagai M. Fukui T. Comparative glucan specificities of two types of spinach leaf phosphorylase.J.

The cytoplasmic Pho2 is involved in the metabolism of maltose, the amylolytic degraded starch product transported from the chloroplast to the cytoplasm. A role of Pho1 in starch biosynthesis was first reported for the plastidial PhoB enzyme from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (5Dauvillée D. Chochois V. Steup M. Haebel S. Eckermann N. Ritte G. Ral J.P. Colleoni C. Hicks G. Wattebled F. Deschamps P. d'Hulst C. Liénard L. Cournac L. Putaux J.L. Dupeyre D. Ball S.G. Plastidial phosphorylase is required for normal starch synthesis in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Plant J. 2006; 48: 274-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) where strains containing mutations in the structural gene STA4 exhibit reduced levels of starch and a modified amylopectin structure and elevated amylose content. The role of starch phosphorylase in higher plants remained enigmatic until the identification and characterization of pho1 mutants in rice, which exhibited pronounced alterations in seed starch. When grown at normal temperature, pho1 plants produced seeds ranging from shrunken in size to pseudo-normal-appearing seeds, the latter having reduced weight compared with normal seeds produced by wild type plants (6Satoh H. Shibahara K. Tokunaga T. Nishi A. Tasaki M. Hwang S.K. Okita T.W. Kaneko N. Fujita N. Yoshida M. Hosaka Y. Sato A. Utsumi Y. Ohdan T. Nakamura Y. Mutation of the plastidial α-glucan phosphorylase gene in rice affects the synthesis and structure of starch in the endosperm.Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 1833-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). At lower temperature, pho1 plants bore mainly shrunken seeds, indicating that Pho1 plays a significant role for starch biosynthesis at low temperature, whereas its activity at higher temperature is partially compensated by one or more other factors yet to be identified. The biosynthetic role of the rice Pho1 (OsPho1) is substantiated by its catalytic properties. The rice Pho1 is a homodimer (210 kDa) that exhibits considerably higher catalytic activity in the synthesis direction, having equilibrium constants ranging from 13 to 45 (7Hwang S.K. Nishi A. Satoh H. Okita T.W. Rice endosperm-specific plastidial α-glucan phosphorylase is important for synthesis of short-chain malto-oligosaccharides.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2010; 495: 82-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) depending on the acceptor substrate. The biosynthetic role is conspicuously displayed when OsPho1 is incubated with Pi alone using maltohexaose as a substrate. Although degradative products are produced, near equal amounts of synthetic products are also generated. Moreover, the enzyme showed significantly increased substrate affinities and catalytic activities at subsaturating substrate concentrations when the reaction temperature was lowered from 36 °C to 18 °C (4Hwang S.K. Singh S. Cakir B. Satoh H. Okita T.W. The plastidial starch phosphorylase from rice endosperm: catalytic properties at low temperature.Planta. 2016; 243: 999-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), supporting the enzyme's physiological role at low growth temperature. The higher plant Pho1 is structurally homologous to Pho2 and microbial and animal glycogen phosphorylases with one significant exception. The enzyme from higher plants contains an additional 78–80-amino acid peptide (L78/L80) positioned near the middle of the primary sequence, which is not found in Pho2, maltodextrin phosphorylase, or glycogen phosphorylases (4Hwang S.K.

Plant. 2002; 114: 506-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This region, which has a number of charged amino acids, forms an undefined loop structure (supplemental Fig. S1) on the surface of the enzyme when modeled based on the crystal structure of Pho2 from Arabidopsis thaliana (9O'Neill E.C. Rashid A.M. Stevenson C.E.M. Hetru A.C. Gunning A.P. Rejzek M. Nepogodiev S.A. Bornemann S. Lawson D.M. Field R.A. Sugar-coated sensor chip and nanoparticle surfaces for the in vitro enzymatic synthesis of starch-like materials.Chem. Sci. 2014; 5: 341-350Crossref Google Scholar). Removal of L80 from OsPho1 did not affect the catalytic properties of OsPho1 for Glc1P, amylopectin, and malto-oligosaccharide but significantly increased substrate affinity when glycogen was used as the substrate (4Hwang S.K. Singh S. Cakir B. Satoh H. Okita T.W. The plastidial starch phosphorylase from rice endosperm: catalytic properties at low temperature.Planta. 2016; 243: 999-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), suggesting the L80 domain per se is not directly involved in catalysis in rice. It has also been suggested that L80 is not important for regulation of the enzyme but, instead, protects the OsPho1 protein under heat stress conditions (4Hwang S.K. Singh S. Cakir B. Satoh H. Okita T.W. The plastidial starch phosphorylase from rice endosperm: catalytic properties at low temperature.Planta. 2016; 243: 999-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In sweet potato roots, high molecular weight complexes showing Pho1 activity contained the 20S proteasome that interacts with the L78 region of Pho1 and degrades the Pho1 protein under heat stress (10Lin Y.C.

Plastidial starch phosphorylase in sweet potato roots is proteolytically modified by protein-protein interaction with the 20S proteasome.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e35336Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In addition, like the L80 of OsPho1 the L78 of sweet potato, Pho1 has a number of charged amino acids that have been suggested to be potential targets for protein kinase activity (11Young G.H. Chen H.M. Lin C.T. Tseng K.C. Wu J.S. Juang R.H. Site-specific phosphorylation of L-form starch phosphorylase by the protein kinase activity from sweet potato roots.Planta. 2006; 223: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It was proposed that L78 serves as a switch controlling the catalytic direction of the enzyme reaction as proteolytic removal of the L78 region induced by the phosphorylation event resulted in alteration of the enzyme's affinities toward substrates (8Chen H.M.

In rice endosperm, protein-protein interactions occur between or among starch synthases (SSs), branching enzymes (BEs), pullulanase, and OsPho1 (21Abe N. Asai H. Yago H. Oitome N.F. Itoh R. Crofts N.

In wheat, it has been reported that Pho1 interacts with BEI and BEIIb in an ATP-dependent manner in soluble extracts of developing endosperms harvested at mid-to-late developmental stage (14Tetlow I.J.

Protein phosphorylation in amyloplasts regulates starch branching enzyme activity and protein-protein interactions.Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 694-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the same interaction was not detected in developing endosperms harvested at the early stage possibly due to low BEI expression (13Tetlow I.J. Beisel K.G. Cameron S. Makhmoudova A. Liu F. Bresolin N.S. Wait R. Morell M.K. Emes M.J. Analysis of protein complexes in wheat amyloplasts reveals functional interactions among starch biosynthetic enzymes.Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 1878-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In maize endosperm, a novel multienzyme complex consisting of SSIIa, SSIII, BEIIa, BEIIb, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) large and small subunits, and pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) was reported (15Hennen-Bierwagen T.A. Lin Q. Grimaud F. Planchot V. Keeling P.L. James M.G. Myers A.M.

Interestingly, the maize Pho1 was found associated with SSI, SSIIa, BEI, and BEIIa in the starch granule when expression of BEIIb was abolished in an amylose extender (ae−) mutant (17Liu F. Makhmoudova A. Lee E.A. Wait R. Emes M.J. Tetlow I.J. The amylose extender mutant of maize conditions novel protein-protein interactions between starch biosynthetic enzymes in amyloplasts.J. Exp.

Proteome and phosphoproteome analysis of starch granule-associated proteins from normal maize and mutants affected in starch biosynthesis.J. Exp. Bot. 2008; 59: 3395-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, direct evidence for an interaction between the maize endosperm Pho1 and BEIIb/BEI has not been established. A very weak interaction between OsPho1 and BEIIa was observed in rice endosperm when co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) was performed with Pho1 or BEIIa antibodies, a view supported by co-electrophoresis migration patterns as assessed by blue-native PAGE (12Crofts N. Abe N. Oitome N.F. Matsushima R. Hayashi M. Tetlow I.J. Emes M.J. Nakamura Y. Fujita N. Amylopectin biosynthetic enzymes from developing rice seed form enzymatically active protein complexes.J. Exp. Bot. 2015; 66: 4469-4482Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the interaction between OsPho1 and BE may be indirect, as OsPho1 and BE may form an indirect physical association on glucans to synthesize branched α-glucans or maltodextrins (23Nakamura Y. Ono M. Utsumi C. Steup M. Functional interaction between plastidial starch phosphorylase and starch branching enzymes from rice during the synthesis of branched maltodextrins.Plant Cell Physiol. 2012; 53: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To identify potential protein-interacting partners of the rice Pho1, we incubated developing rice seed extracts with immobilized OsPho1 or a L80-deleted form of OsPho1 (OsPho1ΔL80) as bait. Although starch synthases and branching enzyme proteins were expected, we instead identified disproportionating enzyme (d-enzyme or OsDpe1) as a prominent interacting partner of OsPho1. Results are presented that OsPho1 and OsDpe1 form a heteromeric multisubunit protein complex, and both enzymes are functional in the complex to cooperatively synthesize glucan substrates. Our earlier study showed that OsPho1 and OsPho1ΔL80 are homodimers that showed similar kinetic properties when their recombinant forms were assayed (4Hwang S.K. Singh S. Cakir B. Satoh H. Okita T.W. The plastidial starch phosphorylase from rice endosperm: catalytic properties at low temperature.Planta. 2016; 243: 999-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). If the extended L80 region (supplemental Fig. S1) is responsible for the protein-protein interaction, the potential partner proteins would interact with OsPho1 but not with OsPho1ΔL80 (14Tetlow I.J. Wait R. Lu Z. Akkasaeng R. Bowsher C.G. Esposito S. Kosar-Hashemi B. Morell M.K. Emes M.J. Protein phosphorylation in amyloplasts regulates starch branching enzyme activity and protein-protein interactions.Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 694-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). To identify proteins interacting with the OsPho1 proteins, we repeatedly attempted a pulldown assay using His6-tagged OsPho1 or OsPho1ΔL80 bound to Ni+-agarose resins but were unsuccessful due to instability of protein binding and background problems. Thus, we employed the HaloTag® pulldown technology as this method allows for stringent washing conditions to reduce undesirable background of nonspecific interacting proteins. Three fusion proteins, HaloTag®;green fluorescence protein (HT-GFP; control), HT-OsPho1, and HT-OsPho1ΔL80 (supplemental Fig. S2), were successfully overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and starch phosphorylase activities of the fusion proteins in the cleared cell lysates were measured (Fig. 1A). Both HT-OsPho1 and HT-OsPho1ΔL80 showed substantial levels of starch phosphorylase activities, whereas HT-GFP emitted strong fluorescence under 360-nm ultraviolet light, indicating that the recombinant-expressed proteins fused to HT maintained their active forms. The proteins were then purified to near homogeneity and covalently coupled to HaloLink resins. The resins were extensively washed with binding buffer and incubated with protein extracts from immature rice seeds (10 days after flowering (DAF)) in the absence or presence of 1 mm ATP to enable potential phosphorylation-dependent OsPho1 interaction with other proteins, as demonstrated by the phosphorylation-dependent interaction of SBEIIb and Pho1 in wheat amyloplast extracts (14Tetlow I.J. Wait R. Lu Z. Akkasaeng R. Bowsher C.G. Esposito S. Kosar-Hashemi B. Morell M.K. Emes M.J. Protein phosphorylation in amyloplasts regulates starch branching enzyme activity and protein-protein interactions.Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 694-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). When the bound proteins were eluted and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, the silver-stained polyacrylamide gel showed unique bands at ∼63 kDa in both HT-OsPho1 (labeled b in Fig. 1B) and HT-OsPho1ΔL80 (labeled d) samples irrespective of the presence of 1 mm ATP. Unique polypeptide bands at 105 kDa (labeled a), 95 kDa (labeled c), and 63 kDa (labeled b and d) from both samples were analyzed by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Mass spectrometry results revealed that the bands at 105 kDa and 95 kDa were OsPho1 and OsPho1ΔL80, respectively, whereas the 63-kDa bands were identified as 4-α-glucanotransferase (disproportionating enzyme, Dpe1 or D-enzyme; EC 2.4.1.25). The molecular mass of rice Dpe1 (OsDpe1), as estimated by mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, corresponds well with the calculated molecular mass (62 kDa) of the matured monomeric form of OsDpe1 (GenBankTM accession number AK318541). No protein bands corresponding to the size of rice BEs (>80 kDa) (12Crofts N. Abe N. Oitome N.F. Matsushima R. Hayashi M. Tetlow I.J. Emes M.J. Nakamura Y. Fujita N.

Biochem. 2014; 83: 168-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To confirm the interaction between OsPho1 and OsDpe1, the partially purified tag-less OsDpe1 and GFP proteins were mixed with His6-OsPho1 or with His6-OsPho1ΔL80 and then subjected to immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). After the IMAC resins were washed extensively, the proteins were eluted with 100 mm imidazole and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. No promiscuous bands were detected when GFP was incubated with OsPho1 or OsPho1ΔL80. By contrast, the 62-kDa OsDpe1 was captured by both OsPho1 forms at amounts relative to their input (Fig. 2A). The physiological interaction of OsDpe1 with OsPho1 was confirmed using rice-developing seed extracts. HT-OsDpe1 fusion protein was constructed, expressed in E. coli, and captured on HaloLink resin. Soluble protein extracts from immature rice seeds were incubated with the HaloLink-OsDpe1 resin, and the bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by silver staining of the polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotting (Fig. 2B). The silver-stained polyacrylamide gel displayed a complex distribution of polypeptide bands. When we performed immunoblot analysis with anti-OsPho1 (supplemental Fig. S3 A) and anti-OsDpe1 (supplemental Fig. S3B) antibodies, the major bands (denoted by triangles) in the silver-stained gel from the HT-OsDpe1 sample alone strongly reacted with anti-OsDpe1 antibody, whereas the bands seen at different sizes (denoted by filled triangles) from HT-OsDpe1 incubated with rice extracts reacted with OsPho1 antibody. This result indicates that intact and degraded forms of OsPho1 were captured by HaloLinked OsDpe1 and that OsPho1 is a major interacting partner of OsDpe1. Co-IP assays were performed to verify the in situ interaction between OsPho1 and OsDpe1 in developing rice seeds. Affinity purified anti-OsPho1 and anti-OsDpe1 antibodies were immobilized on protein-A beads and incubated with soluble protein extracts from immature rice seeds. The bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-OsPho1 or anti-OsDpe1 antibodies (Fig. 2C). Immunoprecipitates (IPs) generated with the anti-OsPho1 antibody contained its respective antigen, OsPho1, as well as OsDpe1. Likewise, IPs formed using anti-OsDpe1 antibody contained its respective antigen, OsDpe1, as well as OsPho1. Overall, the capturing of recombinant and native OsDpe1 by recombinant OsPho1 and the reciprocal co-IP results indicate that OsPho1 and OsDpe1 form a stable protein complex. The expression levels of OsPho1 and OsDpe1 in immature seeds harvested at 7, 14, and 21 days after flowering were measured using the purified recombinant OsDpe1 and OsPho1 proteins as references (Fig. 3). Immunoblot analysis using anti-OsPho1 and anti-OsDpe1 antibodies (Fig. 3A) showed that the levels of OsDpe1 and OsPho1 protein were fairly constant throughout seed development (Fig. 3, A, B, and C). When the relative levels of the enzymes were calculated, OsPho1 is found to be much more abundant (>25-fold) than OsDpe1 during all development stages examined in this study (Fig. 3D). The recombinant OsDpe1 was subjected to size exclusion chromatography to measure its molecular weight. Our result showed that OsDpe1 has a molecular mass of 121 kDa (supplemental Fig. S4A), suggesting the rice Dpe1 forms a homodimer when taking into account that OsDpe1 monomer is 62 kDa as assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2). An equal amount of the recombinant OsPho1 and OsDpe1 was mixed and incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and nondenaturing native polyacrylamide gel (10%) electrophoresis was performed in Tris-Tricine buffer. The protein bands were then visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining. Fig. 4A shows that OsDpe1 protein migrated noticeably faster than OsPho1 protein, whereas a mixture of OsPho1 and OsDpe1 proteins barely migrated and was detected at the top part of the gel. This result indicates a formation of a high molecular weight complex between the two proteins. We further analyzed the protein complex formation by using Superdex-200 size exclusion chromatography (supplemental Fig. S5). The two dimeric forms of the recombinant enzymes were mixed at three different molar ratios (2:1, 1:1, and 1:2) and resolved by chromatography, and the amounts of each protein in each fraction estimated by the CBB staining of polypeptide bands was resolved by SDS-PAGE. At a OsPho1-OsDpe1 ratio of 1:2, two major peaks were observed on the chromatogram (result not shown), and SDS-PAGE analysis showed two proteins were at a similar molar ratio in the early fractions, but OsDpe1 bands were more prevalent in the later fractions, indicating a large amount of free OsDpe1 dimers were eluted in the later fractions. At 2:1, OsPho1 bands were prevalent in the early fractions, but OsDpe1 band declined drastically, and OsPho1 remained at higher levels thereafter, indicating a large amount of free OsPho1 dimers were eluted in the later fractions. However, at 1:1, two proteins were present at similar levels throughout the elution profile. These results suggest that OsPho1 and OsDpe1 interact with each other at the stoichiometric molar ratio of 1:1. The molecular size of the OsPho1-OsDpe1 complex was estimated to be 620 kDa (supplemental Fig. S4B), indicating the protein complex likely contains 4 subunits of OsPho1 and 4 subunits of OsDpe1. To demonstrate the physiological existence of the OsPho1-OsDpe1 complex, we analyzed the elution profiles of OsDpe1 and OsPho1 present in soluble protein extract from immature rice seeds (10 DAF) by performing Superdex-200 chromatography and subsequent analysis of the fractions by immunoblot analysis with antibodies raised against OsPho1 and OsDpe1 (Fig. 4B). Although OsDpe1 co-eluted with OsPho1 in a small range of high molecular weight fractions (fractions 11–14), OsPho1 proteins were detected in a broader range of fractions (10–18) with the latter fractions overlapping with the elution profile of β-amylase (200 kDa) that was used as a molecular size marker. When a protein extract from immature seeds of BMF136 (pho1 null mutant) was analyzed, OsDpe1 proteins were no longer eluted in the high molecular weig"

Cardiac ischemia is also associated with activation, up-regulation, and secretion of various proteolytic enzymes. Here, using whole-cell patch clamp and Western blotting analysis, we demonstrate that the hERG/IKr channel was selectively cleaved by the serine protease, proteinase K (PK). Using molecular biology techniques including making a chimeric channel between protease-sensitive hERG and insensitive human ether-a-go-go (hEAG), as well as application of the scorpion toxin BeKm-1, we identified that the S5-pore linker of hERG is the target domain for proteinase K cleavage. To investigate the physiological relevance of the unique susceptibility of hERG to proteases, we show that cardiac ischemia in a rabbit model was associated with a reduction in mature ERG expression and an increase in the expression of several proteases, including calpain. Using cell biology approaches, we found that calpain-1 was actively released into the extracellular milieu and cleaved hERG at the S5-pore linker.

Coordinated ion channel activity controls the rhythmic heartbeat, and dysfunction of ion channels causes cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death (1Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C.

The ventricular action potential duration is reflected by the QT interval on an electrocardiogram. Reduction of hERG current (IhERG) prolongs the action potential and causes long QT syndrome (LQTS), a cardiac electrical disorder that predisposes individuals to the potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmia torsades de pointes and sudden death (1Keating M.T.

Many loss-of-function mutations in hERG have been identified in humans, which decrease IKr and cause type 2 inherited LQTS (5Anderson C.L. Delisle B.P. Anson B.D. Kilby J.A. Will M.L. Tester D.J.

Dysfunction of hERG also represents a primary cause of acquired LQTS. For example, hERG is preferentially targeted by a large number of drugs, giving rise to drug-induced LQTS (1Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. Molecular and cellular mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias.Cell. 2001; 104: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have shown that a reduction in the serum K+ concentration (hypokalemia) selectively decreases hERG function and expression, leading to LQTS (6Guo J. Massaeli H. Xu J. Jia Z. Wigle J.T.

Although many factors may contribute to sudden death in ischemic heart disease, the finding that QT prolongation occurs in many ischemic cases has changed the classical concept of the cardiac ischemia cascade (25Kenigsberg D.N.

QT interval prolongation as predictor of sudden death in patients with myocardial infarction.Circulation. 1978; 57: 1074-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). The extent of QT prolongation was shown to be an independent predictor of sudden cardiac death (27Schwartz P.J. Wolf S.

Cardiol. 2003; 92: 203-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It is currently unknown how cardiac ischemia causes QT prolongation. In the present study, we demonstrate that hERG expressed in HEK cells and IKr in cardiomyocytes are uniquely susceptible to extracellular protease-mediated damage. We show that the cleavage site is located in the extracellular S5-pore linker. We show that replacing the S5-pore linker of hERG with that of human EAG (hEAG) completely eliminated the PK sensitivity of hERG channels. As well, application of the hERG S5-pore linker binding scorpion toxin BeKm-1 effectively protected ERG channels from protease-mediated cleavage. Furthermore, our data show that coronary ligation-induced cardiac ischemia in rabbits led to a selective reduction in mature ERG protein expression with a concomitant increase in the cysteine protease calpain, the serine protease matriptase-2, and the matrix metalloproteinase MMP-2 expression. In particular, we found that transfection of calpain-1 into HEK cells led to a drastic increase in the expression of calpain-1 in the culture medium, and transfer of this medium to hERG-expressing HEK cells resulted in a reduction in mature hERG channel expression and IhERG. Finally, we identified that calpain-1 cleaves mature hERG in the S5-pore linker. Using protease cleavage-predicting software (PROSPER) and site-directed mutagenesis in the S5-pore linker, we identified that calpain-1 cleaves mature hERG at amino acid position Gly-603. Recognition of the unique susceptibility of hERG channels to extracellular proteases extends our understanding of hERG regulation as well as the development of QT prolongation and arrhythmias in pathophysiological conditions such as cardiac ischemia. We examined the effects of PK treatment on IKr, Ito (transient outward K+ current), IK1 (inward rectifier K+ current), ICa-Ba (Ba2+-mediated L-type Ca2+ channel current), and INa (Na+ current) in ventricular myocytes from neonatal rats. Ventricular myocytes were isolated and cultured on glass coverslips for 24 h.

To further understand the specificity of proteases on K+ channels, we studied the effects of PK on hERG, Kv4.3 (encoding Ito), Kir2.3 (encoding IK1), KCNQ1 + KCNE1 (encoding IKs), and hEAG (hERG-related K+ channel) channels stably expressed in HEK 293 cells.

The cells were then collected for patch clamp or Western blotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A, PK reduced IhERG in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 of 5.9 μg/ml. To determine whether the PK-mediated reduction of IhERG was a result of cell surface cleavage of mature hERG channels, we performed Western blotting analysis of whole cell lysate in control and PK-treated cells. Normal hERG proteins on Western blots display two bands with molecular masses of 155 and 135 kDa. Using various techniques, including biotin-mediated cell surface protein analysis, we and others have established that, for hERG proteins extracted from cells under normal culture conditions, the 155 kDa band reflects the mature, fully glycosylated channels localized in the plasma membrane, and the 135 kDa band reflects the immature, core-glycosylated hERG channels localized intracellularly (6Guo J.

As shown in Fig. 3B, PK treatment for 12 h led to a concentration-dependent reduction of the 155-kDa hERG band with an EC50 of 8.4 μg/ml. However, PK treatment did not affect the intracellularly localized 135-kDa (immature) hERG proteins. These data indicate that PK-mediated cleavage of mature hERG protein is responsible for the reduced IhERG. To investigate the PK cleavage site of hERG channels, we analyzed hERG degradation products from hERG-HEK cells treated with PK (200 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 20 min. Because proteinase K cannot permeate the cell membrane, it has been used as a tool to cleave cell surface protein to identify the plasma membrane-localized hERG channel proteins (29Guo J. Massaeli H.

As expected, PK treatment selectively abolished the 155-kDa hERG band without affecting the 135-kDa hERG band (Fig. 4A). The disappearance of the 155 kDa band was accompanied by the appearance of a 70 kDa band fragment when an N terminus-targeting hERG (N-20) antibody was used (Fig. 4A, left). When a C terminus-targeting hERG antibody (C-20) was used, the elimination of the 155 kDa band of hERG was accompanied by the appearance of a 65 kDa band fragment (Fig. 4A, right). Extracellularly applied proteases may cleave hERG channels by targeting the S1-S2 linker, the S3-S4 linker, the S5-pore linker, or the pore-S6 linker. Structurally, whereas the S5-pore linker contains 43 amino acid residues, the S1-S2, S3-S4, and pore-S6 linkers contain about 26, 4, and 6 amino acid residues, respectively (UniProt, Q12809). The long S5-pore linker is approximately in the middle of the channel protein sequence. Based on ExPASy-ProtParam Tool (software) analysis of cleavage products by PK, the cleavage site is predicted to be in the S5-pore linker (Fig. 4). The combined molecular mass of the N-terminal and C-terminal fragments after PK digestion is 135 kDa (70 + 65 kDa), which is 20 kDa less than the mature 155-kDa hERG protein that has been cleaved. Two possibilities may account for the missing 20-kDa fragment. First, a small peptide fragment of 20 kDa could be digested from the channel during cleavage. Second, an N-linked oligosaccharide at position Asn-598 in the S5-pore linker, which results from full glycosylation during channel maturation, may be cleaved off during digestion. The second possibility was previously proposed by Rajamani et al. (13Rajamani S. Anderson C.L. Valdivia C.R. Eckhardt L.L. Foell J.D. Robertson G.A. Kamp T.J. Makielski J.C. Anson B.D. January C.T.

Our data as described below also support the notion that N-linked oligosaccharide in the S5-pore linker is cleaved off during PK digestion. Under normal culture/physiological conditions, the hERG subunit is synthesized as a 132-kDa protein and undergoes core glycosylation with the addition of a 3-kDa glycan to become the 135-kDa immature product in the endoplasmic reticulum. During maturation, the core-glycosylated (135-kDa) hERG undergoes complex glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus with the addition of a 20-kDa oligosaccharide to become the 155-kDa mature protein, which is transported to the plasma membrane and has a half-life of ∼11 h (35Gong Q.

The glycosylation of hERG channels has been shown to be N-linked at position Asn-598 and can be prevented by tunicamycin treatment or by the N598Q mutation (13Rajamani S. Anderson C.L. Valdivia C.R.

It has been shown that glycosylation is not required for the cell surface expression of functional hERG channels (35Gong Q. Anderson C.L. January C.T. Zhou Z.

Thus, after prevention of N-linked glycosylation by either tunicamycin treatment or N598Q mutation, there is neither mature protein at 155 kDa nor immature protein at 135 kDa; instead, there is mature protein at 132 kDa localized in the plasma membrane and immature protein also at 132 kDa localized intracellularly (13Rajamani S.

Forty-eight multiparous transition cows were matched and divided into four groups: control, 15 g/d RPC, 15 g/d RPM or 15 g/d RPC + 15 g/d RPM. Diet samples were collected daily before feeding, and blood samples were collected weekly from the jugular vein before morning feeding from 21 days prepartum to 21 days postpartum. Postpartum dry matter intake (DMI) was increased by both additives (P < 0.05), and energy balance values in supplemented cows were improved after parturition (P < 0.05). Both RPC and RPM decreased the plasma concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), β-hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA), total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (P < 0.05), but increased the plasma levels of glucose, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB 100, P < 0.05). The supplements improved milk production (P < 0.05), and increased (P < 0.05) or tended to increase (0.05 < P < 0.10) the contents of milk fat and protein. The post-ruminal choline and methionine elevated the blood antioxidant status, as indicated by total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity and the vitamin E concentration (P < 0.05), and reduced the plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) level (P < 0.05). Furthermore, RPM and RPC elevated the plasma interleukin 2 (IL-2) concentration and the CD4+/CD8+ T lymphocyte ratio in peripheral blood (P < 0.05). Alternatively, the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-6 were decreased by RPM and RPC (P < 0.05). Overall, the regulatory responses of RPC and RPM were highly correlated with time and were more effective in the postpartum cows. The results demonstrated that dietary supplementation with RPC and RPM promoted energy balance by increasing postpartal DMI and regulating hepatic lipid metabolism, improved postpartum lactation performance and enhanced antioxidant capacity and immune function of transition dairy cows."

This community, which is established shortly after birth, develops rapidly to form one of the most densely populated ecological niches in nature by the age of 2–3 years. Despite millions of years of co-evolution with mammalian hosts (2Ley R.E. Hamady M. Lozupone C. Turnbaugh P.J. Ramey R.R. Bircher J.S. Schlegel M.L. Tucker T.A. Schrenzel M.D. Knight R. Gordon J.I.

Evidence is rapidly accumulating that advantage can be taken of the gut microbiota in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases and disorders. To realize this potential it is important to discern the complex metabolic interactions among different microbiota taxa, which promote a healthy composition and prevent imbalance (dysbiosis) associated with disease (6Brown K.

Both of these classes of α-(1,6)-oligosaccharides selectively boost the counts of bifidobacteria and gut-adapted lactobacilli in vitro and in vivo (10Mäkeläinen H. Hasselwander O. Rautonen N.

Food Res. 2009; 53: S62-S67Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), but the molecular basis of this preferential enumeration is unclear. Bifidobacteria are strictly saccharolytic, but in contrast to other commensals of the HGM most of their glycoside hydrolases are intracellular, and their genomes encode only a few extracellular hydrolases targeting polysaccharides (16Ventura M. O'Connell-Motherway M. Leahy S. Moreno-Munoz J.A. Fitzgerald G.F. van Sinderen D. From bacterial genome to functionality; case bifidobacteria.Int. J.

Acad. Sci. 2008; 1125: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Instead, bifidobacteria rely on their specialized carbohydrate transport systems for uptake of available oligosaccharides (18Flint H.J. Duncan S.H. Scott K.P. Louis P. Interactions and competition within the microbial community of the human colon: links between diet and health.Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 9: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). ABC transporters are the most common class of glycan transporters in bifidobacteria (19Pokusaeva K. Fitzgerald G.F. van Sinderen D. Carbohydrate metabolism in Bifidobacteria.Genes Nutr. 2011; 6: 285-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). ABC transporters use the free energy of ATP hydrolysis via two intracellular nucleotide binding domains to energize the uptake of a variety of molecules. Extracellular solute binding proteins (SBPs) are responsible for capture of ligands, which are subsequently translocated through a pore formed by two transmembrane domains (20ter Beek J. Guskov A. Slotboom D.J. Structural diversity of ABC transporters.J. Gen. Physiol. 2014; 143: 419-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Although some substrate recognition is conferred by the transmembrane domains, SBPs largely define the specificity and the affinity of bacterial ABC importers (21Berntsson R.P. Smits S.H. Schmitt L. Slotboom D. J Poolman B. A structural classification of substrate-binding proteins.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Oligosaccharide transporters are likely to play a pivotal role in the highly competitive and extremely densely populated gut niche, as the intracellular (or periplasmic) accumulation of oligosaccharides precludes loss to competing organisms. Despite their importance, molecular insight for most oligosaccharide transporters in the gut niche and especially those from bifidobacteria is lacking. Growth of the probiotic bacterium Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04 on the α-(1,6)-galactosides melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose and the α-(1,6)-glucosides isomaltose and panose (Fig. 1) differentially induced the expression of a locus encoding three glycoside hydrolases and an ABC transporter (22Andersen J.M. Barrangou R. Abou Hachem M. Lahtinen S.J. Goh Y.J. Svensson B. Klaenhammer T.R. Transcriptional analysis of oligosaccharide utilization by Bifidobacterium lactis Bl-04.BMC Genomics. 2013; 14: 312Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the present study, we determined the affinities of BlG16BP and the SBP associated to this ABC transporter to a range of α-(1,6)-oligosaccharides and established its specificity for galactosides and glucosides sharing a common α-(1,6)-diglycoside motif. The structures of the SBP in complex with the two preferred ligands raffinose and panose provided insight into the structural basis for this specificity. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses show that close homologues of BlG16BP are conserved within most bifidobacteria and a few strains of Firmicutes, consistent with preferential fermentation of α-(1,6)-oligosaccharides by these taxonomic groups of the HGM. Competition assays between B. ovatus, from the dominant HGM genus Bacteroides, and B. animalis subsp. lactis provided evidence that ABC-mediated oligosaccharide uptake confers an advantage in competition for raffinose, the preferred carbohydrate ligand for the identified ABC transporter. This first biochemical and structural study of an α-(1,6)-oligosaccharide transport protein presented here provides a basic understanding of the versatility of ABC transporter associated SBPs in glycan capture and provides evidence for a competitive advantage associated with ABC-mediated glycan transport. Ligand preference of BlG16BP was explored using SPR. No binding to the monosaccharides fructose, galactose, and glucose was observed. The SBP was specific for α-(1,6)-glucosides (IMO and panose) and α-(1,6)-galactosides (RFO) (Fig. 1) as judged by the lack of binding to the β-glycosides cellobiose, xylo-oligosaccharides, β-galacto-oligosaccharides, β-fructo-oligosaccharides, or malto-oligosaccharides. The binding kinetics rate constants were too fast to be modeled, and the equilibrium dissociation constants (Table 1) were determined from steady state sensograms (Fig. 2). The highest affinity was measured toward the trisaccharides panose and raffinose (Table 1) with KD values of 9 μm and 21 μm, respectively. Reducing the ligand size to a disaccharide resulted in a substantial affinity reduction (∼35-fold for the melibiose compared with raffinose and 120-fold for isomaltose as compared with panose). By contrast, the change in affinity with increasing oligosaccharide size was clearly different between the RFO and the IMO. Thus, the presence of two additional α-(1,6) galactosyl moieties at the non-reducing end of raffinose in verbascose abolished the binding within the tested ligand concentration range, whereas the affinity for the α-(1,6)-glucosides with a degree of polymerization of 3–7 was similar and only ∼14-fold lower than for the preferred trisaccharide panose (Table 1).

Open table in a new tab The crystal structures of BlG16BP in complex with raffinose and panose showed well defined densities for the bound oligosaccharides in the ligand binding site that features a deep but open pocket large enough to accommodate a trisaccharide. Three aromatic residues from Domain 2 provide stacking interactions to each glycosyl ring in a trisaccharide ligand, whereas polar contacts are provided by both domains of BlG16BP. The non-reducing end glycosyl unit of both ligands (galactosyl in raffinose and glucosyl in panose) stacks onto Phe-392 (defined as position 1) and makes polar contacts to Asp-394, Asn-109, and His-395 (Fig. 4, D and E). Interestingly Asp-394 is able to form hydrogen bonds to both the equatorial C4-OH of the nonreducing end glucosyl in panose and the axial C4-OH of the galactosyl in raffinose, thus allowing for an equivalent mode of ligand binding at position 1 (Fig. 4, D and E). The glucosyl moiety of raffinose and panose at position 2 stacks onto Tyr-291 and makes polar contacts to Lys-58, Glu-60, and Asp-326. Although the pyranose rings at positions 1 and 2 can be overlaid almost perfectly, the planes of the terminal glycosyl moieties residues at position 3 are almost orthogonal to each other. Thus, the glucosyl moiety of panose stacks onto Trp-216 with almost parallel planes of the sugar ring and the indole side chain (Fig. 4, D and E). By contrast, the fructosyl residue in raffinose has a smaller area of van der Waals contact with Trp-216, with the planes of the furanose and indole rings being almost orthogonal to each other (Fig. 4, D and E). Homologues of BlG16BP are encoded by genomes of several species within Bifidobacterium. While the solvent-exposed residues are variable, the binding pocket residues of BlG16BP that make direct ligand contacts are invariant in Bifidobacterium (data not shown). An exception is the conservative substitution of Asn-109 to aspartic acid in some Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum strains. The composition and conservation of loci encompassing orthologues of the BlG16BP gene within Bifidobacterium was performed. Genes encoding permease components of an ABC importer, transcriptional regulators, GH36 α-galactosidases that mediate degradation of soybean α-1,6-galactosides (RFO), oligo-α-1,6-glucosidases (glycoside hydrolase family 13, subfamily 31, GH13_31) that catalyze the hydrolysis of α-(1,6)-glucosides (IMO), were invariably co-localized with BlG16BP orthologues in human gut adapted taxa (Fig. 5). This organization defines the α-(1,6)-galactoside/glucoside utilization loci in Bifidobacterium with the exception of the insect gut-residing Bifidobacterium asteroides (Fig. 5). The occurrence of potential ABC transporters of α-(1,6)-glycosides in other taxa, particularly from the gut niche, was analyzed using a different strategy to overcome the low sequence conservation of SBPs. The genetic co-localization of an ABC transporter and an α-galactosidase of family GH36 was used as a discriminator to map the taxonomic distribution of BlG16BP homologues in putative α-(1,6)-galactoside utilization loci. Using this approach, 263 gene loci encoding GH36 enzymes (mainly α-galactosidases) together with an ABC transporter and enzymes predicted to be involved in the degradation of α-(1,6)-glucosides (e.g. α-(1,6)-glucosidases of GH13_31) or the sucrose moieties produced from RFO (e.g. sucrose phosphorylases of GH13_18 or sucrose hydrolases of GH32) were found. Most of the loci originated from the Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, including bifidobacteria species and other taxa typically associated with human hosts (Fig. 5). These SBPs populated three subtrees (1, 2, and 3) in this phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 6). BlG16BP and homologous sequences sharing the same genetic organization were in subtree 1. By contrast, subtree 2 SBPs co-localized with putative α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase genes (of GH36, data not shown), suggesting a role in uptake of α-N-acetyl-hexoseamine-containing glycans, e.g. from mucin. Subtree 3 is mostly populated by SBPs from marine or soil bacteria. The majority of bifidobacterial SBPs populate a single branch in subtree 1 together with BlG16BP (Fig. 6).

To assay for oligosaccharide uptake preference, B. animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04 was grown in the presence of equal amounts of the RFOs melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose (Fig. 1). The depletion of oligosaccharides was monitored in the culture supernatant throughout the growth experiment. Raffinose was depleted first followed by stachyose and, thereafter, melibiose (Fig. 7). Growth of seven strains of bifidobacteria on raffinose or a mixture of IMOs was performed. All tested strains except Bifidobacterium bifidum, which lacks the genes encoding the BlG16BP ABC transporter, grew efficiently on both raffinose and the IMO mixture (Table 4). Moreover, B. ovatus from the dominant human commensal Bacteroidetes phylum, was able to grow equally well on these substrates (Table 4). This shows that growth on α-(1,6)-glycosides does not require ABC-mediated transport as Bacteroides lack this type of transporters.TABLE 4Growth of different bifidobacteria and B. ovatus on raffinose and a mixture of isomaltooligosaccharidesStrainsRaffinoseIMO mixB. animalis subsp. lactis Bl-041.8 ± 0.052.0 ± 0.16B. adolescentis ATCC 157032.4 ± 0.052.7 ± 0.05B. longum subsp. longum JCM 12171.7 ± 0.011.4 ± 0.05B. longum subsp. infantis ATCC 156970.8 ± 0.122.0 ± 0.15B. breve ATCC 156481.5 ± 0.311.6 ± 0.17B. dentium Bd11.1 ± 0.101.2 ± 0.08B. bifidum ATCC 29521NDNDB. ovatus ATCC 84831.9 ± 0.011.8 ± 0.13 Open table in a new tab We wanted to evaluate the ability of B. ovatus to compete with B. animalis lactis Bl-04 for raffinose, the preferred substrate for the BlG16BP ABC transporter.

This distribution persisted after a second round of co-culture (Fig. 8). The complexity and the density of the HGM are highest in the distal gut, reaching 1011 cells g−1 content (30Kleerebezem M.

Humans consume large amounts of non-digestible glycans that reach the colon intact and exert a significant effect on the composition of the microbiota (9Koropatkin N.M. Cameron E.A. Martens E.C. How glycan metabolism shapes the human gut microbiota.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2012; 10: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Uptake of glycan oligomers is likely to be a key adaptation strategy to the fierce competition as it allows further intracellular (or periplasmic) breakdown of these oligomers and precludes loss to competing taxa. The involvement of ABC transporters in uptake of non-digestible oligosaccharides in health-stimulating bacteria has been highlighted through several “omics” studies (22Andersen J.M. Barrangou R.

https://openalex.org/W2510142674,"Guanine-nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) are negative regulators of Rho family GTPases that sequester the GTPases away from the membrane. Here we ask how GDI-Cdc42 interaction regulates localized Cdc42 activation for cell motility. The sensitivity of cells to overexpression of Rho family pathway components led us to a new biosensor, GDI.Cdc42 FLARE, in which Cdc42 is modified with a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) 'binding antenna' that selectively reports Cdc42 binding to endogenous GDIs. Similar antennae could also report GDI-Rac1 and GDI-RhoA interaction. Through computational multiplexing and simultaneous imaging, we determined the spatiotemporal dynamics of GDI-Cdc42 interaction and Cdc42 activation during cell protrusion and retraction. This revealed remarkably tight coordination of GTPase release and activation on a time scale of 10 s, suggesting that GDI-Cdc42 interactions are a critical component of the spatiotemporal regulation of Cdc42 activity, and not merely a mechanism for global sequestration of an inactivated pool of signaling molecules."

Human PDLSCs (hPDLSCs) were stimulated with P. gingivalis LPS in the presence or in the absence of soluble CD14 (sCD14) and the production of interleukin (IL)-6, chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 8 (CXCL8), and chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) was measured. The response to P. gingivalis LPS was compared with that to TLR4 agonist Escherichia coli LPS and TLR2-agonist Pam3CSK4. The response of hPDLSCs to both P. gingivalis LPS and E. coli LPS was significantly enhanced by sCD14. In the absence of sCD14, no significant difference in the hPDLSCs response to two kinds of LPS was observed. These responses were significantly lower compared to that to Pam3CSK4. In the presence of sCD14, the response of hPdLSCs to P. gingivalis LPS was markedly higher than that to E. coli LPS and comparable with that to Pam3CSK4. The response of hPdLSCs to bacterial LPS is strongly augmented by sCD14. Local levels of sCD14 could be an important factor for modulation of the host response against periodontal pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2516221229,"Despite growing concerns about the welfare of horses in Great Britain (GB) there has been little surveillance of the welfare status of the horse population. Consequently we have limited knowledge of the range of welfare problems experienced by horses in GB and the situations in which poor welfare occurs. Thirty-one in-depth interviews were conducted with a cross -section of equine stakeholders, in order to explore their perceptions of the welfare problems faced by horses in GB. Welfare problems relating to health, management and riding and training were identified, including horses being under or over weight, stabling 24 hours a day and the inappropriate use of training aids. The interviewees also discussed broader contexts in which they perceived that welfare was compromised. The most commonly discussed context was where horses are kept in unsuitable environments, for example environments with poor grazing. The racing industry and travellers horses were identified as areas of the industry where horse welfare was particularly vulnerable to compromise. Lack of knowledge and financial constraints were perceived to be the root cause of poor welfare by many interviewees. The findings give insight into the range of welfare problems that may be faced by horses in GB, the contexts in which these may occur and their possible causes. Many of the problems identified by the interviewees have undergone limited scientific investigation pointing to areas where further research is likely to be necessary for welfare improvement. The large number of issues identified suggests that some form of prioritisation may be necessary to target research and resources effectively."
https://openalex.org/W2512216199,"The scientific community has recognized the importance of integrating farmer's perceptions and knowledge (FPK) for the development of sustainable pest and disease management strategies. However, the knowledge gap between indigenous and scientific knowledge still contributes to misidentification of plant health constraints and poor adoption of management solutions. This is particularly the case in the context of smallholder farming in developing countries. In this paper, we present a case study on coffee production in Uganda, a sector depending mostly on smallholder farming facing a simultaneous and increasing number of socio-ecological pressures. The objectives of this study were (i) to examine and relate FPK on Arabica Coffee Pests and Diseases (CPaD) to altitude and the vegetation structure of the production systems; (ii) to contrast results with perceptions from experts and (iii) to compare results with field observations, in order to identify constraints for improving the information flow between scientists and farmers. Data were acquired by means of interviews and workshops. One hundred and fifty farmer households managing coffee either at sun exposure, under shade trees or inter-cropped with bananas and spread across an altitudinal gradient were selected. Field sampling of the two most important CPaD was conducted on a subset of 34 plots. The study revealed the following findings: (i) Perceptions on CPaD with respect to their distribution across altitudes and perceived impact are partially concordant among farmers, experts and field observations (ii) There are discrepancies among farmers and experts regarding management practices and the development of CPaD issues of the previous years. (iii) Field observations comparing CPaD in different altitudes and production systems indicate ambiguity of the role of shade trees. According to the locality-specific variability in CPaD pressure as well as in FPK, the importance of developing spatially variable and relevant CPaD control practices is proposed."

We identify observations featuring firm-specific spikes in Twitter activity, and randomly assign each observation to a ten-minute increment matching on the firm and a number of repeating time indicators. We examine the extent that unusual levels of chatter on Twitter about a firm portend an oncoming surge of trading of its stock within the hour, over and above what would normally be expected for the stock for that time of day and day of week. We also compare the findings from our explanatory model to the predictive power of Tweets.

https://openalex.org/W2510275008,"Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that is characterized by chronic inflammation and destruction of joints. Netrin-1, a chemorepulsant, laminin-like matrix protein, promotes inflammation by preventing macrophage egress from inflamed sites and is required for osteoclast differentiation. We asked whether blockade of Netrin-1 or its receptors [Unc5b and DCC (deleted in colorectal carcinoma)] may be useful therapeutic targets for treatment of inflammatory arthritis. Arthritis was induced in 8-wk-old C57Bl/6 mice by intraperitoneal injection of K/BxN serum. Murine monoclonal antibodies against Netrin-1, Unc5b, or DCC (10 μg/mouse) were injectedweekly for 4 wk(n = 10). Paw swelling and thickness were assessed and following euthanasia 2–4 wk after serum transfer, paws were prepared for micro–computed tomography and histology. Paw inflammation was maximal 2 wk after injection. Anti–Netrin-1 or anti-Unc5b, but not anti-DCC, antibodies significantly reduced paw inflammation (clinical score: 9.8 ± 0.8, 10.4 ± 0.9, and 13.5 ± 0.5, respectively vs. 16 ± 0 for control; P < 0.001). Micro–computed tomography showed bony erosions in untreated or anti-DCC–treated mice, whereas there were no erosions in anti–Netrin-1/anti-Unc5β-treated-animals. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining demonstrated a marked decrease in osteoclasts in anti-Netrin-1/anti-Unc5b–treated animals. Immunofluorescence staining revealed a decrease in cathepsin K+ and CD68+ cells in anti–Netrin-1/anti-Unc5b–treated animals.

https://openalex.org/W2517131274,"Focusing one's attention by external guiding stimuli towards a specific area of the visual field produces systematical neural signatures. One of the most robust is the change in topological distribution of oscillatory alpha band activity across parieto-occipital cortices. In particular, decreases in alpha activity over contralateral and/or increases over ipsilateral scalp sites, respect to the side of the visual field where attention was focused. This evidence comes mainly from experiments where an explicit cue informs subjects where to focus their attention, thus facilitating detection of an upcoming target stimulus. However, recent theoretical models of attention have highlighted a stochastic or non-deterministic component related to visuospatial attentional allocation. In an attempt to evidence this component, here we analyzed alpha activity in a signal detection paradigm in the lack of informative cues; in the absence of preceding information about the location (and time) of appearance of target stimuli. We believe that the unpredictability of this situation could be beneficial for unveiling this component. Interestingly, although total alpha power did not differ between Seen and Unseen conditions, we found a significant lateralization of alpha activity over parieto-occipital electrodes, which predicted behavioral performance. This effect had a smaller magnitude compared to paradigms in which attention is externally guided (cued). However we believe that further characterization of this spontaneous component of attention is of great importance in the study of visuospatial attentional dynamics. These results support the presence of a spontaneous component of visuospatial attentional allocation and they advance pre-stimulus alpha-band lateralization as one of its neural signatures."
https://openalex.org/W2492257130,"Multifunctional proteins play a variety of roles in metabolism. Here, we examine the catalytic function of the combined 3-deoxy-d-arabino heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase (DAH7PS) and chorismate mutase (CM) from Geobacillus sp. DAH7PS operates at the start of the biosynthetic pathway for aromatic metabolites, whereas CM operates in a dedicated branch of the pathway for the biosynthesis of amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine. In line with sequence predictions, the two catalytic functions are located in distinct domains, and these two activities can be separated and retain functionality. For the full-length protein, prephenate, the product of the CM reaction, acts as an allosteric inhibitor for the DAH7PS. The crystal structure of the full-length protein with prephenate bound and the accompanying small angle x-ray scattering data reveal the molecular mechanism of the allostery. Prephenate binding results in the tighter association between the dimeric CM domains and the tetrameric DAH7PS, occluding the active site and therefore disrupting DAH7PS function. Acquisition of a physical gating mechanism to control catalytic function through gene fusion appears to be a general mechanism for providing allostery for this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2512806184,"Carbohydrate active enzymes often contain auxiliary binding sites located either on independent domains termed carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) or as so-called surface binding sites (SBSs) on the catalytic module at a certain distance from the active site. The SBSs are usually critical for the activity of their cognate enzyme, though they are not readily detected in the sequence of a protein, but normally require a crystal structure of a complex for their identification. A variety of methods, including affinity electrophoresis (AE), insoluble polysaccharide pulldown (IPP) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) have been used to study auxiliary binding sites. These techniques are complementary as AE allows monitoring of binding to soluble polysaccharides, IPP to insoluble polysaccharides and SPR to oligosaccharides. Here we show that these methods are useful not only for analyzing known binding sites, but also for identifying new ones, even without structural data available. We further verify the chosen assays discriminate between known SBS/CBM containing enzymes and negative controls. Altogether 35 enzymes are screened for the presence of SBSs or CBMs and several novel binding sites are identified, including the first SBS ever reported in a cellulase. This work demonstrates that combinations of these methods can be used as a part of routine enzyme characterization to identify new binding sites and advance the study of SBSs and CBMs, allowing them to be detected in the absence of structural data."

It could be hypothesized that relatively younger athletes nearly only have a chance for selection if they are early maturing. However, surprisingly this influence of the biological maturity status on the RAE could not be proven, yet. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of the biological maturity status on the RAE in dependence of the level of competition. The study investigated 372 elite youth ski racers: 234 provincial ski racers (P-SR; high level of competition) and 137 national ski racers (N-SR; very high level of competition). Anthropometric characteristics were measured to calculate the age at peak height velocity (APHV) as an indicator of the biological maturity status. A significant RAE was present among both P-SR and N-SR, with a larger effect size among the latter group. The N-SR significantly differed in APHV from the P-SR. The distribution of normal, early and late maturing athletes significantly differed from the expected normal distribution among the N-SR, not among the P-SR. Hardly any late maturing N-SR were present; 41.7% of the male and 34% of the female N-SR of the last relative age quarter were early maturing. These findings clearly demonstrate the significant influence of the biological maturity status on the selection process of youth alpine ski racing in dependence of the level of competition. Relatively younger athletes seem to have a chance of selection only if they are early maturing."
https://openalex.org/W2497106451,"Sepsis remains associated with a high mortality rate. Endotoxin has been shown to influence viscoelastic coagulation parameters, thus suggesting a link between endotoxin levels and the altered coagulation phenotype in septic patients. This study evaluated the effects of systemic polyspecific IgM-enriched immunoglobulin (IgM-IVIg) (Pentaglobin® [Biotest, Dreieich, Germany]) on endotoxin activity (EA), inflammatory markers, viscoelastic and conventional coagulation parameters.Patients with severe sepsis were identified by daily screening in a tertiary, academic, surgical ICU. After the inclusion of 15 patients, the application of IgM-IVIg (5 mg/kg/d over three days) was integrated into the unit's standard operation procedure (SOP) to treat patients with severe sepsis, thereby generating ""control"" and ""IgM-IVIg"" groups. EA assays, thrombelastometry (ROTEM®) and impedance aggregometry (Multiplate®) were performed on whole blood. Furthermore, routine laboratory parameters were determined according to unit's standards.Data from 26 patients were included. On day 1, EA was significantly decreased in the IgM-IVIg group following 6 and 12 hours of treatment (0.51 ±0.06 vs. 0.26 ±0.07, p<0.05 and 0.51 ±0.06 vs. 0.25 ±0.04, p<0.05) and differed significantly compared with the control group following 6 hours of treatment (0.26 ±0.07 vs. 0.43 ±0.07, p<0.05). The platelet count was significantly higher in the IgM-IVIg group following four days of IgM-IVIg treatment (200/nl ±43 vs. 87/nl ±20, p<0.05). The fibrinogen concentration was significantly lower in the control group on day 2 (311 mg/dl ±37 vs. 475 mg/dl ±47 (p = 0.015)) and day 4 (307 mg/dl ±35 vs. 420 mg/dl ±16 (p = 0.017)). No differences in thrombelastometric or aggregometric measurements, or inflammatory markers (interleukin-6 (IL-6), leukocyte, lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP)) were observed.Treatment with IgM-enriched immunoglobulin attenuates the EA levels in patients with severe sepsis and might have an effect on septic thrombocytopenia and fibrinogen depletion. Viscoelastic, aggregometric or inflammatory parameters were not influenced.clinicaltrials.gov NCT02444871."
https://openalex.org/W2507473410,"Affective or hedonic responses to food are crucial for humans, both advantageously (e.g., enhancing survival) and disadvantageously (e.g., promoting overeating and lifestyle-related disease). Although previous psychological studies have reported evidence of unconscious cognitive and behavioral processing related to food, it remains unknown whether affective reactions to food can be triggered unconsciously and its relationship with daily eating behaviors. We investigated these issues by using the subliminal affective priming paradigm. Photographs of food or corresponding mosaic images were presented in the peripheral visual field for 33 ms. Target photos of faces with emotionally neutral expressions were then presented, and participants rated their preferences for the faces. Eating behaviors were also assessed using questionnaires. The food images, relative to the mosaics, increased participants' preference for subsequent target faces. Furthermore, the difference in the preference induced by food versus mosaic images was positively correlated with the tendency to engage in external eating. These results suggest that unconscious affective reactions are elicited by the sight of food and that these responses contribute to daily eating behaviors related to overeating."

A total of 572 bats belonging to 22 species were collected on Anjouan, Mayotte, La Réunion, Mauritius, Mahé and Madagascar and screened by the Rapid Fluorescent Focus Inhibition Test for the presence of neutralising antibodies against the two main rabies related lyssaviruses circulating on the African continent: Duvenhage lyssavirus (DUVV) and Lagos bat lyssavirus (LBV), representing phylogroups I and II, respectively. A total of 97 and 42 sera were able to neutralise DUVV and LBV, respectively. No serum neutralised both DUVV and LBV but most DUVV-seropositive bats (n = 32/220) also neutralised European bat lyssavirus 1 (EBLV-1) but not Rabies lyssavirus (RABV), the prototypic lyssavirus of phylogroup I. These results highlight that lyssaviruses belonging to phylogroups I and II circulate in regional bat populations and that the putative phylogroup I lyssavirus is antigenically closer to DUVV and EBLV-1 than to RABV. Variation between bat species, roost sites and bioclimatic regions were observed. All brain samples tested by RT-PCR specific for lyssavirus RNA were negative."

In this study, PA1024 was purified to high levels, and the enzymatic activity was investigated by spectroscopic and polarographic techniques. Purified PA1024 did not exhibit nitronate monooxygenase activity; however, it displayed NADH:quinone reductase and a small NADH:oxidase activity. The enzyme preferred NADH to NADPH as a reducing substrate. PA1024 could reduce a broad spectrum of quinone substrates via a Ping Pong Bi Bi steady-state kinetic mechanism, generating the corresponding hydroquinones. The reductive half-reaction with NADH showed a kred value of 24 s-1 and an apparent Kd value estimated in the low micromolar range. The enzyme was not able to reduce the azo dye methyl red, routinely used in the kinetic characterization of azoreductases. Finally, we revisited and modified the existing six conserved motifs of PA1024, which define a new class of NADH:quinone reductases and are present in more than 490 hypothetical proteins in the GenBankTM, the vast majority of which are currently misannotated as nitronate monooxygenase."
https://openalex.org/W2499813179,"Clinical resistance to the second-generation antiandrogen enzalutamide in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), despite persistent androgen receptor (AR) activity in tumors, highlights an unmet medical need for next-generation antagonists. We have identified and characterized tetra-aryl cyclobutanes (CBs) as a new class of competitive AR antagonists that exhibit a unique mechanism of action. These CBs are structurally distinct from current antiandrogens (hydroxyflutamide, bicalutamide, and enzalutamide) and inhibit AR-mediated gene expression, cell proliferation, and tumor growth in several models of CRPC. Conformational profiling revealed that CBs stabilize an AR conformation resembling an unliganded receptor. Using a variety of techniques, it was determined that the AR-CB complex was not recruited to AR-regulated promoters and, like apo AR, remains sequestered in the cytoplasm, bound to heat shock proteins. Thus, we have identified third-generation AR antagonists whose unique mechanism of action suggests that they may have therapeutic potential in CRPC."
https://openalex.org/W2502238532,"Background Anaemia in children under five years old is associated with poor health, growth and developmental outcomes. In Papua, Indonesia, where the burden of anaemia in infants is high, we conducted a community survey to assess the association between Plasmodium infection, helminth carriage and the risk of anaemia. Methods A cross sectional household survey was carried out between April and July 2013 in 16 villages in the District of Mimika using a multistage sampling procedure. A total of 629 children aged 1–59 months from 800 households were included in the study. Demographic, symptom and anthropometry data were recorded using a standardized questionnaire. Blood and stool samples were collected for examination. Results Of the 533 children with blood film examination, 8.8% (47) had P. vivax parasitaemia and 3.9% (21) had P. falciparum; the majority of children with malaria were asymptomatic (94.4%, 68/72). Soil transmitted helminth (STH) infection was present in 43% (105/269) of children assessed; those with STH were at significantly greater risk of P. vivax parasitaemia compared to those without STH (OR = 3.7 [95%CI 1.5–9.2], p = 0.004). Anaemia (Hb<10 g/dl) was present in 24.5% (122/497) of children and associated with P. vivax parasitaemia (OR = 2.9 [95%CI, 1.7–4.9], p = 0.001), P. falciparum parasitaemia (OR = 4.3 [95%CI, 2.0–9.4], p<0.001), hookworm carriage (OR = 2.6 [95%CI, 1.2–5.8], p = 0.026), Plasmodium–helminth coinfection (OR 4.0 [95%CI, 1.4–11.3], p = 0.008) and severe stunting (OR = 1.9 ([95%CI, 1.1–3.3], p = 0.012). Conclusions Asymptomatic P. vivax and P. falciparum infections and hookworm all contribute to risk of paediatric anaemia in coendemic areas and should be targeted with prevention and treatment programs. The relationship between helminth infections and the increased risk of P. vivax parasitaemia should be explored prospectively."

Nano-sized liposomes may accumulate in and selectively deliver drugs to an inflammatory lesion with enhanced vascular permeability. The aims of this study were to investigate the distribution of liposomal FK506, an immunosuppressive drug encapsulated within liposomes, and the drug’s effects on cardiac function in a rat experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) model. We prepared polyethylene glycol-modified liposomal FK506 (mean diameter: 109.5 ± 4.4 nm). We induced EAM by immunization with porcine myosin and assessed the tissue distribution of the nano-sized beads and liposomal FK506 in this model. After liposomal or free FK506 was administered on days 14 and 17 after immunization, the cytokine expression in the rat hearts along with the histological findings and hemodynamic parameters were determined on day 21. Ex vivo fluorescent imaging revealed that intravenously administered fluorescent-labeled nano-sized beads had accumulated in myocarditic but not normal hearts on day 14 after immunization and thereafter. Compared to the administration of free FK506, FK506 levels were increased in both the plasma and hearts of EAM rats when liposomal FK506 was administered. The administration of liposomal FK506 markedly suppressed the expression of cytokines, such as interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α, and reduced inflammation and fibrosis in the myocardium on day 21 compared to free FK506. The administration of liposomal FK506 also markedly ameliorated cardiac dysfunction on day 21 compared to free FK506. Nano-sized liposomes may be a promising drug delivery system for targeting myocarditic hearts with cardioprotective agents."
https://openalex.org/W2515820523,"This study aimed to estimate the combining ability, of T. cacao genotypes preselected for drought tolerance through diallel crosses. The experiment was conducted under greenhouse conditions at the Cacao Research Center (CEPEC), Ilhéus, Bahia, Brazil, in a completely randomized block design, in an experimental arrangement 21 x 2 [21 complete diallel crosses and two water regimes (control and stressed)]. In the control, soil moisture was kept close to field capacity, with predawn leaf water potential (ΨWL) ranging from -0.1 to -0.5 MPa. In the drought regime, the soil moisture was reduced gradually by decreasing the amount of water application until ΨWL reached -2.0 to -2.5 MPa. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed for most morphological attributes analyzed regarding progenies, water regime and their interactions. The results of the joint diallel analysis revealed significant effects between general combining ability (GCA) x water regimes and between specific combining ability (SCA) x water regimes. The SCA 6 genetic material showed high general combining ability for growth variables regardless of the water regime. In general, the water deficit influenced the production of biomass in most of the evaluated T. cacao crosses, except for SCA-6 x IMC-67, Catongo x SCA, MOC-01 x Catongo, Catongo x IMC-67 and RB-40 x Catongo. Multivariate analysis showed that stem diameter (CD), total leaf area (TLA), leaf dry biomass (LDB), stem dry biomass (SDB), root dry biomass (RDB), total dry biomass (TDB), root length (RL), root volume (RV), root diameter (RD) <1 mm and 1 <(RD) <2 mm were the most important growth parameters in the separation of T. cacao genotypes in to tolerant and intolerant to soil water deficit."

This study examines the global grid as a network with nations as nodes and international electricity trade as links. We analyze the structure of the global electricity trade network and find that the network consists of four sub-networks, and provide a detailed analysis of the largest network, Eurasia. Russia, China, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan have high betweenness measures in the Eurasian sub-network, indicating the degrees of centrality of the positions they hold. The analysis reveals that the Eurasian sub-network consists of seven communities based on the network structure. We find that the communities do not fully align with geographical proximity, and that the present international electricity trade in the Eurasian sub-network causes an approximately 11 million additional tons of CO2 emissions."
https://openalex.org/W2496373675,"It has been suggested that DYNLT1, a dynein light chain known to bind to various cellular and viral proteins, can function both as a molecular clamp and as a microtubule-cargo adapter. Recent data have shown that the DYNLT1 homodimer binds to two dynein intermediate chains to subsequently link cargo proteins such as the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Lfc or the small GTPases RagA and Rab3D. Although over 20 DYNLT1-interacting proteins have been reported, the exact sequence requirements that enable their association to the canonical binding groove or to the secondary site within the DYNLT1 surface are unknown. We describe herein the sequence recognition properties of the hydrophobic groove of DYNLT1 known to accommodate dynein intermediate chain. Using a pepscan approach, we have substituted each amino acid within the interacting peptide for all 20 natural amino acids and identified novel binding sequences. Our data led us to propose activin receptor IIB as a novel DYNLT1 ligand and suggest that DYNLT1 functions as a molecular dimerization engine bringing together two receptor monomers in the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. In addition, we provide evidence regarding a dual binding mode adopted by certain interacting partners such as Lfc or the parathyroid hormone receptor. Finally, we have used NMR spectroscopy to obtain the solution structure of human DYNLT1 forming a complex with dynein intermediate chain of ∼74 kDa; it is the first mammalian structure available."
https://openalex.org/W2506790856,"Protein phosphatase Z (Ppz) is a fungus specific enzyme that regulates cell wall integrity, cation homeostasis and oxidative stress response. Work on Saccharomyces cerevisiae has shown that the enzyme is inhibited by Hal3/Vhs3 moonlighting proteins that together with Cab3 constitute the essential phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase (PPCDC) enzyme. In Candida albicans CaPpz1 is also involved in the morphological changes and infectiveness of this opportunistic human pathogen. To reveal the CaPpz1 regulatory context we searched the C. albicans database and identified two genes that, based on the structure of their S. cerevisiae counterparts, were termed CaHal3 and CaCab3. By pull down analysis and phosphatase assays we demonstrated that both of the bacterially expressed recombinant proteins were able to bind and inhibit CaPpz1 as well as its C-terminal catalytic domain (CaPpz1-Cter) with comparable efficiency. The binding and inhibition were always more pronounced with CaPpz1-Cter, indicating a protective effect against inhibition by the N-terminal domain in the full length protein. The functions of the C. albicans proteins were tested by their overexpression in S. cerevisiae. Contrary to expectations we found that only CaCab3 and not CaHal3 rescued the phenotypic traits that are related to phosphatase inhibition by ScHal3, such as tolerance to LiCl or hygromycin B, requirement for external K+ concentrations, or growth in a MAP kinase deficient slt2 background. On the other hand, both of the Candida proteins turned out to be essential PPCDC components and behaved as their S. cerevisiae counterparts: expression of CaCab3 and CaHal3 rescued the cab3 and hal3 vhs3 S. cerevisiae mutations, respectively. Thus, both CaHal3 and CaCab3 retained the PPCDC related functions and have the potential for CaPpz1 inhibition in vitro. The fact that only CaCab3 exhibits its phosphatase regulatory potential in vivo suggests that in C. albicans CaCab3, but not CaHal3, acts as a moonlighting protein."
https://openalex.org/W2509416031,"Global warming is likely leading to species’ distributional shifts, resulting in changes in local community compositions and diversity patterns. In this study, we applied species distribution models to evaluate the potential impacts of temperature increase on ant communities in Korean temperate forests, by testing hypotheses that 1) the risk of extinction of forest ant species would increase over time, and 2) the changes in species distribution ranges could drive upward movements of ant communities and further alter patterns of species richness. We sampled ant communities at 335 evenly distributed sites across South Korea and modelled the future distribution range for each species using generalized additive models. To account for spatial autocorrelation, autocovariate regressions were conducted prior to generalized additive models. Among 29 common ant species, 12 species were estimated to shrink their suitable geographic areas, whereas five species would benefit from future global warming. Species richness was highest at low altitudes in the current period, and it was projected to be highest at the mid-altitudes in the 2080s, resulting in an upward movement of 4.9 m yr−1. This altered the altitudinal pattern of species richness from a monotonic-decrease curve (common in temperate regions) to a bell-shaped curve (common in tropical regions). Overall, ant communities in temperate forests are vulnerable to the on-going global warming and their altitudinal movements are similar to other faunal communities."

The closer the resemblance of these models to human tumor characteristics, the more suitable they are for drug-development and –testing. In the present study, we generated a complex 3D lung tumor test system based on acellular rat lungs. A decellularization protocol was established preserving the architecture, important ECM components and the basement membrane of the lung. Human lung tumor cells cultured on the scaffold formed cluster and exhibited an up-regulation of the carcinoma-associated marker mucin1 as well as a reduced proliferation rate compared to respective 2D culture. Additionally, employing functional imaging with 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) these tumor cell cluster could be detected and tracked over time. This approach allowed monitoring of a targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment in the in vitro lung tumor model non-destructively. Surprisingly, FDG-PET assessment of single tumor cell cluster on the same scaffold exhibited differences in their response to therapy, indicating heterogeneity in the lung tumor model. In conclusion, our complex lung tumor test system features important characteristics of tumors and its microenvironment and allows monitoring of tumor growth and -metabolism in combination with functional imaging. In longitudinal studies, new therapeutic approaches and their long-term effects can be evaluated to adapt treatment regimes in future."

Because protein structure is regulated through posttranslational modifications, we investigated the Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO)ylation of TTR. We chose the widely used Ubc9 fusion-directed SUMOylation system, which is based on a fusion of the SUMOylation substrate of interest with Ubc9, a sole SUMO conjugating enzyme. Surprisingly, despite our presumptions, we found that Ubc9 fused to TTR was SUMOylated at a unique set of lysine residues. Three unknown SUMOylation sites of Ubc9-K154, K18 and K65-were revealed by mass spectrometry (MS). The previously reported SUMOylation at K49 of Ubc9 was also observed. SUMOylation of the lysine residues of TTR fused to Ubc9 was hardly detectable. However, non-fused TTR was SUMOylated via trans-SUMOylation by Ubc9 fused to TTR. Interestingly, mutating the catalytic residue of Ubc9 fused to TTR did not result in complete loss of the SUMOylation signal, suggesting that Ubc9 linked to TTR is directly cross-SUMOylated by the SUMO-activating enzyme E1. Ubc9, TTR or fusion proteins composed of TTR and Ubc9 specifically affected the global SUMOylation of cellular proteins. TTR or Ubc9 alone increased global SUMOylation, whereas concomitant presence of TTR and Ubc9 did not further increase the amount of high-molecular weight (HMW) SUMO conjugates. Our data suggest that TTR may influence the SUMOylation of Ubc9, thereby altering signalling pathways in the cell."

Carotid ultrasound was performed and far wall cIMT in three carotid artery segments was registered, representing the common carotid (CCA-IMT), carotid bifurcation (BIF-IMT) and the internal carotid artery (ICA-IMT). Measurements were compared between FH+ and FH negative groups and stepwise backward regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with increased cIMT.During the study period 382 patients were enrolled, of which 262 (68%) were males and 233 (61%) reported FH of CVD. Regression analyses adjusting for risk factors revealed age as the most important predictor of cIMT in all segments. The association between FH+ and cIMT was modified by age (p = 0.014) and was significant only regarding ICA-IMT. FH+ was associated with increased ICA-IMT in patients aged < 45y (p = 0.001), but not in patients ≥ 45y (p = 0.083).

We characterized one of the non-cellulosomal enzymes, Cel5I, composed of a Family-5 Glycoside Hydrolase catalytic module (GH5), a tandem of Family-17 and -28 Carbohydrate Binding Modules (CBM), and three S-layer homologous (SLH) modules, where the latter are expected to anchor the protein on the cell surface. Cel5I is the only putative endoglucanase targeting the cell surface as well as the only putative protein in R. cellulolyticum containing CBM17 and/or CBM28 modules. We characterized different recombinant structural variants from Cel5I. We showed that Cel5I has an affinity for insoluble cellulosic substrates through its CBMs, that it is the most active endoglucanase on crystalline cellulose of R. cellulolyticum characterized to date and mostly localized in the cell envelope of R. cellulolyticum. Its role in vivo was analyzed using a R. cellulolyticum cel5I mutant strain. Absence of Cel5I in the cell envelope did not lead to a significant variation of the phenotype compared to the wild type strain. Neither in terms of cell binding to cellulose, nor for its growth on crystalline cellulose, thus indicating that the protein has a rather subtle role in tested conditions. Cel5I might be more important in a natural environment, at low concentration of degradable glucose polymers, where its role might be to generate higher concentration of short cellodextrins close to the cell surface, facilitating their uptake or for signalization purpose."

The antigenic breakdown products of the vaccine may not persist, and undefined tonic stimulation has been proposed to maintain the specific memory. We have suggested that cellular stress agents to which the immune cells are constantly exposed may be responsible for tonic stimulation. Here we have studied four stress agents: sodium arsenite, an oxidative agent; Gramicidin, eliciting K+ efflux and calcium influx; dithiocarbamate, a metal ionophore; and aluminum hydroxide (alum), an immunological adjuvant. The aims of this study are to extend these investigations to T and B cell responses of unimmunized and ovalbumin (OVA)-immunized BALB/c mice, and furthermore, to ascertain whether stress is involved in optimal expression of memory B cells, as demonstrated in CD4+ T cells. Examination of the homeostatic pathway defined by IL-15/IL-15R (IL-15 receptor) interaction and the inflammasome pathway defined by the IL-1-IL-1R interaction between dendritic cells (DC) and CD4+ T cells suggests that both pathways are involved in the development of optimal expression of CD4+CD45RO+ memory T cells in unimmunized and OVA-immunized BALB/c mice. Furthermore, significant direct correlation was found between CD4+CD44+ memory T cells and both IL-15 of the homeostatic and IL-1β of the inflammasome pathways. However, CD19+CD27+ memory B cells in vivo seem to utilize only the IL-15/IL-15R homeostatic pathway, although the proliferative responses are enhanced by the stress agents. Altogether, stress agents may up-regulate unimmunized and OVA-immunized CD4+CD44+ memory T cells by the homeostatic and inflammasome pathways. However, the CD19+CD27+ memory B cells utilize only the homeostatic pathway. Immunological memory is a fundamental function of vaccination. The antigenic breakdown products of the vaccine may not persist, and undefined tonic stimulation has been proposed to maintain the specific memory. We have suggested that cellular stress agents to which the immune cells are constantly exposed may be responsible for tonic stimulation. Here we have studied four stress agents: sodium arsenite, an oxidative agent; Gramicidin, eliciting K+ efflux and calcium influx; dithiocarbamate, a metal ionophore; and aluminum hydroxide (alum), an immunological adjuvant. The aims of this study are to extend these investigations to T and B cell responses of unimmunized and ovalbumin (OVA)-immunized BALB/c mice, and furthermore, to ascertain whether stress is involved in optimal expression of memory B cells, as demonstrated in CD4+ T cells. Examination of the homeostatic pathway defined by IL-15/IL-15R (IL-15 receptor) interaction and the inflammasome pathway defined by the IL-1-IL-1R interaction between dendritic cells (DC) and CD4+ T cells suggests that both pathways are involved in the development of optimal expression of CD4+CD45RO+ memory T cells in unimmunized and OVA-immunized BALB/c mice.

Altogether, stress agents may up-regulate unimmunized and OVA-immunized CD4+CD44+ memory T cells by the homeostatic and inflammasome pathways. However, the CD19+CD27+ memory B cells utilize only the homeostatic pathway.

The homeostatic dendritic cell (DC)-CD4+ T cell interactive memory circuit can be stimulated by heat, oxidative or K+ efflux, and Ca2+ influx stress agents. They induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in DC, leading to NFκB signaling and membrane-associated (ma)IL-15 expression (8Pétrilli V. Papin S. Dostert C. Mayor A. Martinon F. Tschopp J.

CD40 ligand on CD4+ T cells in turn re-activates CD40 molecules on DC, inducing DC maturation and IL-15 expression, thereby maintaining a feedback circuit. The proliferating CD4+ T cells were characterized as CD45RA−CD62L+ central memory cells, which undergo homeostatic proliferation (9Wang Y. Seidl T. Whittall T. Babaahmady K. Lehner T.

Sodium arsenite is an oxidative stress agent releasing free radicals of ROS, which leads to a state of redox disequilibrium (13Hirst J. King M.S. Pryde K.R.

British Crop Protection Council, Farnham, Surrey, UK and Royal Society of Chemistry, Information Sciences, Cambridge, UK1994Google Scholar) and is used in agriculture. The results suggested that stress agents utilize a dual signaling pathway mediated by the interaction between DC and CD4+ T cells. The homeostatic (H) pathway activates NFκB, which transactivates maIL-15 expression on DC, binding IL-15R on CD4+ T cells and inducing CD40L expression (9Wang Y. Seidl T. Whittall T. Babaahmady K. Lehner T. Stress activated dendritic cells interact with CD4+ T cells to elicit homeostatic memory.Eur. J. Immunol. 2010; 40: 1628-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Recently, we have presented evidence in vitro in primary human T cells that both the homeostatic (H) and inflammasome (I) pathways are required for optimal CD4+CD45RO+ memory T cell expression (15Wang Y. Lavender P. Watson J. Arno M. Lehner T. Stress-activated dendritic cells (DC) induce dual interleukin (IL)-15- and IL1β-mediated pathways, which may elicit CD4+ memory T cells and interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes.J. Biol.

The objectives of this study were to study the effect of three stress agents and alum, an adjuvant, which also demonstrates stress-mediated functions in DC interacting with CD4+ T and CD19+ B cells, to induce T cell receptor-independent homeostatic memory in CD44+ memory T cells and CD27+ memory B cells in BALB/C mice (9Wang Y. Seidl T. Whittall T. Babaahmady K. Lehner T. Stress activated dendritic cells interact with CD4+ T cells to elicit homeostatic memory.Eur. J. Immunol. 2010; 40: 1628-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 10Wang Y. Rahman D. Lehner T. A comparative study of stress-mediated immunological functions with the adjuvanticity of alum.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 17152-17160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The phenotypic expression of memory T and B cells and their proliferative responses were then compared with the effect of the same stress agents, but in OVA-immunized mice. Thus, both unimmunized and OVA-immunized memory T and B cells were evaluated with reference to the H and I pathways. The results suggest that although the H and I pathways are required to elicit optimal CD4+CD44+ memory T cells in both unimmunized and OVA-immunized studies, CD19+CD27+ memory B cells used only the H pathway. The specificities of the stress-treated, unimmunized T and B memory cells were not evaluated, but they are likely to represent the steady state of memory responses to the past exposure of multiple antigens, as suggested for prior immunization with tetanus toxoid in human T cell proliferation (9Wang Y. Seidl T. Whittall T. Babaahmady K. Lehner T. Stress activated dendritic cells interact with CD4+ T cells to elicit homeostatic memory.Eur. J. Immunol. 2010; 40: 1628-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To study DC and T and B cell responses and functions induced by stress, we used unimmunized and OVA-immunized BALB/c mice. Splenic CD11c+ DC, naive and memory CD4+ T cells, and CD19+ B cells were studied for their responses to stress, the role of H and I pathways, as well as the effect on activation-induced deamination (AID) and on IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies. We have previously demonstrated that maIL-15 and IL-1β are up-regulated in CD11C+ splenic DC when BALB/c mice were treated with stress agents and OVA (10Wang Y. Rahman D. Lehner T. A comparative study of stress-mediated immunological functions with the adjuvanticity of alum.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 17152-17160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We hypothesized from our studies with CD4+ T cells (15Wang Y. Lavender P. Watson J. Arno M. Lehner T. Stress-activated dendritic cells (DC) induce dual interleukin (IL)-15- and IL1β-mediated pathways, which may elicit CD4+ memory T cells and interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 15595-15609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) that the homeostatic pathway is driven by interaction between maIL-15DC and IL-15Ra on B cells, whereas the inflammasome pathway is driven by interaction between IL-1 expressed by DC and IL-1R on B cells. Analysis of variance of maIL-15 in splenic CD11C+ DC showed significant difference between the stress agent-treated mice without OVA immunization (F = 3.868, p = 0.021), although separately only alum reached significance (Fig. 1A). A greater increase in maIl-15 was observed in DC from the stress agents in OVA-immunized mice (F = 5.61, p = 0.004) and separately with each stress agent (Fig. 1A). The gating strategy and representative flow cytometry are presented in Fig. 1B. Caspase-1 was very significantly up-regulated, in both the untreated (F = 9.947, p = 0.0002) and OVA-immunized animals (F = 6.064, p = 0.0032, Fig. 1C). Activated caspase-1 converts pro-IL-1 into IL-1β, which was similarly up-regulated by the stress agents, surprisingly to a greater extent in the untreated mice (F = 13.74, p < 0.0001) than in the OVA-immunized mice (F = 3.734, p = 0.023, Fig. 1D). Thus, CD11c+ DC were activated by the stress agents to initiate the H and I pathways, in both unimmunized and OVA-immunized BALB/c mice, although significant differences were found between the stress agents. Previous studies have shown that CD40L is increased with antigen or mitogen stimulation (16Frentsch M. Arbach O. Kirchhoff D. Moewes B. Worm M. Rothe M. Scheffold A. Thiel A. Direct access to CD4+ T cells specific for defined antigens according to CD154 expression.Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 1118-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), and we have demonstrated that stress may also up-regulate CD40L in the absence of direct antigen stimulation (10Wang Y. Rahman D. Lehner T. A comparative study of stress-mediated immunological functions with the adjuvanticity of alum.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 17152-17160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Here we have investigated in vivo any difference in response to stress in unimmunized as compared with OVA-immunized CD40L response. All four stress agents induced an increase of CD40L in the unimmunized group, but the ANOVA was not significant, unlike comparison between each stress agent (except Gramicidin) and the baseline control (Fig. 2A). This discrepancy is most likely to be due to the large S.D. of CD40L induced by two of the stress agents. However, the OVA-dependent responses were significantly up-regulated (F = 6.22, p = 0.0028) and further boosted on in vitro re-stimulation with OVA (F = 13.61, p < 0.0001, Fig. 2A). Gating of CD4+ T cells and the effect of stress agents are shown by flow cytometry (Fig. 2B). We then studied CD40L expression to find out whether it was dependent on H pathway, I pathway, or both pathways. Statistical analysis of any correlation utilized data from all 40 animals treated with the four stress agents in vivo (excluding those in vitro treated with OVA). The aim was to analyze the biological effect of cellular stress between DC generating maIL-15 of the homeostatic and IL-1β of the inflammasome pathway with CD40L expressed by CD4+ T cells. A significant direct correlation was found between CD40L in CD4+ T cells with both IL-15 (p = 0.0004, Fig. 2C) and IL-1β (p = 0.027, Fig. 2D) expressed by the CD11c DC. This is consistent with the concept that both pathways are involved in activating CD4+ T cells, although the homeostatic pathway appears to be stronger than that of the inflammasome. Comparison of CD40L expression with IL-15 and IL-1β in Fig. 1, A and C, showed no significant difference on further statistical analysis of unimmunized and OVA-immunized mice (data not shown). The CD4+ T cell transcription factors were studied in splenic cells from BALB/c mice treated with the stress agents, to differentiate between unimmunized and OVA-immunized activation of transcription factors. A significant increase in Tbet expression was found in CD4+ T cells (F = 4.792, p = 0.009) with all stress agents except alum (p < 0.05 to p < 0.01, Fig. 3A). The OVA-immunized, stress-treated mice also showed an increase in Tbet, but this did not reach statistical significance (F = 2.21, p = 0.1) unless the cells were re-stimulated in vitro with OVA (F = 11.64, p < 0.0001 and individually p < 0.05 to p < 0.001, Fig. 3A). The representative FACS data are presented in Fig. 3B. RORγt transcription in CD4+ T cells failed to show a significant increase in the unimmunized stress-stimulated DC, but the OVA-immunized re-stimulated cells were significantly up-regulated (F = 4.58, p = 0.011 or individually p < 0.05 to p < 0.01; Fig. 3C); the FACS data are shown in Fig. 3D. Gata3 failed to show significant changes with the stress agents (data not shown). The results suggest that although Tbet is up-regulated in both unimmunized and OVA-dependent stress-treated mice, RORγt is up-regulated only in the stress-treated, OVA-immunized, and boosted animals. These transcription data are consistent with Th1 and Th17 but not Th2 responses as shown below. Stress-induced H and I pathways elicited up-regulation of Tbet, which transcribes IFN-γ, and RORγt, which transcribes IL-17 cytokines, but GATA3, which mediates IL-4 and IL-10, was not increased, except when IL-4 was treated with alum. Significant up-regulation of IFN-γ was found in the CD4+ T cells of unimmunized animals with all stress agents (F = 9.59, p = 0.0003, Fig. 3E). However, OVA-immunized mice showed limited although significant up-regulation of IFN-γ (F = 3.54, p = 0.03) with sodium arsenite (p < 0.05) and alum (p < 0.05 Fig. 3E), which was greatly boosted with OVA when treated with all stress agents (F = 15.29, p < 0.0001, Fig. 3E). Similar results were found on analysis of the IL-17 data, with significant up-regulation by all stress agents in the OVA-unimmunized animals (F = 12.5, p < 0.0001). OVA-immunized animals failed to show significant increase in IL-17 (F = 2.68, p = 0.067), but in vitro boosting with OVA greatly increased IL-17 production (F = 16.6, p < 0.0001; Fig. 3F). Neither IL-4 nor IL-10 showed any increase with the stress agents in CD4+ T cells from the unimmunized or OVA-immunized mice (with the exception of IL-4 with alum). These results are consistent with the transcription factors, showing significant up-regulation of Tbet and RORγt but not GATA3. The role of unimmunized versus specifically immunized memory T cell development is of fundamental importance to our understanding of maintenance of memory in the absence of antigen stimulation. The CD4+CD44+ memory T cells were significantly up-regulated with all stress agents, except alum (F = 4.432, p = 0.012, Fig. 4A). OVA-immunized mice also demonstrated significant increase with the stress agents (F = 3.189, p = 0.04, Fig. 4A), but this was limited to dithiocarbamate and alum. However, in vitro re-stimulation with OVA of the DC significantly boosted CD44+ memory CD4+ T cells (F = 6.431, p = 0.002), and each stress agent up-regulated these cells (p < 0.01, Fig. 4A). Representative FACS data are presented (Fig. 4B). The effector memory CD4+CD62L− T cells were then examined, and these were comparable, although greatly enhanced, as compared with the CD44+ memory T cells (Fig. 4C) in the unimmunized (F = 7.641, p = 0.0001), OVA-immunized (F = 6.798, p = 0.002), and boosted (F = 9.465, p = 0.0003) cells. Representative FACS data are presented (Fig. 4D). As expected, all unimmunized and OVA-immunized or OVA re-stimulated cells showed significant decrease in the CD4+CD44+CD62L+ central memory T cells (F = 7.641, p = 0.001, F = 6.798, p = 0.002 and F = 9.465, p = 0.0003, respectively, data not shown). The specificity of the CD4+CD44+ memory T cells to OVA was demonstrated by tetramer staining in Gramicidin-treated OVA-immunized cells and gating (p < 0.01, Fig. 4E). Overall the results are consistent with our previous findings, except that up-regulation of both CD4+CD44+ memory T cells and the corresponding CCR7− effector memory cells is demonstrated not only in unimmunized but also immunized CD4+ T cells. The functional effect of stress on T cell proliferation was studied in splenic cells as above. CD4+ T cells showed significant up-regulation of proliferation with all stress agents in the unimmunized (F = 14.3, p < 0.0001, Fig. 5A) and OVA-immunized mice (F = 2.96, p < 0.005, except for Gramicidin), but when re-stimulated with OVA, they were all enhanced (F = 9.85, p < 0.0005, Fig. 5A). It seems that the stress agents enhance expansion of both unimmunized and OVA-immunized CD4+ T cells, but there was a great increase in the OVA-immunized baseline, without treatment with the stress agents, which accounted for the limited increase in the OVA-immunized animals. The aim of the inhibition studies of the H and I pathways by treatment with IL-15 antibodies and IL-1βR1 inhibitors, respectively, was to find out whether the CD4+CD44+ memory T cells require both pathways for optimum expression in vivo, as demonstrated for unstimulated human CD4+ memory T cells in vitro (14Tomlin C. The Pesticide Manual: A World Compendium. British Crop Protection Council, Farnham, Surrey, UK and Royal Society of Chemistry, Information Sciences, Cambridge, UK1994Google Scholar). Here we show in BALB/c mice that immunization with OVA increased the CD4+CD44+ memory T cells with Gramicidin and alum (p < 0.05, Fig. 5B), but not sodium arsenite (large S.D.). IL-15 antibody inhibited significantly with all except alum treatment, although maximum inhibition resulted when both IL-15 antibody and IL-1βR1 inhibitor were used, but the 5% level of significance with alum was reached only when both inhibitors were used (Fig. 5B). As with CD4+ T cells, CD19+ B cells in stress-treated mice showed significantly increased proliferation with all the stress agents in the unimmunized mice (F = 6.77, p = 0.002; Fig. 5C). However, the OVA-immunized stress-treated animals demonstrated a significant increase in B cell proliferation only if they were re-stimulated in vitro with OVA (F = 8.89, p = 0.0005, Fig. 5C). This difference was also seen with AID and suggests that B cells are required to be boosted with the antigen to express CD40L and proliferative responses. Inhibition studies of the H and I pathways were then carried out with CD19+CD27+ B memory cells to find out whether they require both pathways for optimum expression of memory B cells, as demonstrated with CD4+CD44+ memory T cells. Memory B cells showed significant increase with sodium arsenite and Gramicidin, but inhibition in OVA-immunized mice treated with the stress agents was limited to IL-15 antibodies, and that applied also to alum (p < 0.005 to p < 0.0001, Fig. 5D). When both inhibitors were used, there was no significant increase over that elicited by IL-15 antibodies alone. These studies suggest that unlike CD4+CD44+ memory T cells, the CD19+CD27+ memory B cells are only IL-15 (H) pathway-dependent in the interaction between DC and CD19+CD27+ B cells. To elicit the H and I pathways in B cells, we studied expression of the corresponding receptors to the IL-15 and IL-1β expressed by the DC. A 6.5-fold increase in IL-15Rα and an ∼4-fold increase in IL-1RI expression were found in the memory CD27+ B cells, as compared with the naive CD19+ B cells (Fig. 6A; only IL-1R1 results are presented and gating in Fig. 6B). Although a small proportion of CD19+ B cells in unimmunized and OVA-immunized animals expressed IL-15Rα (3.5 ± 0.9 and 3.2 ± 0.2%) and IL-1R1 (3.5 ± 1.7 and 3.4 ± 2.2%), respectively, treatment with the stress agents failed to up-regulate these receptors (data not shown). However, because IL-15Rα and IL-1RI were greatly increased in CD27+CD19+ memory B cells, treatment with the stress agents showed significant increase only in the unimmunized, dithiocarbamate-, or alum-treated cells and in OVA-immunized cells treated only with alum, as compared with the CD27+-untreated controls (p < 0.05, Fig. 6A, only IL-1R1 presented). AID is a fundamental function of B cells initiating somatic hypermutation (SHM), which generates high affinity antibodies by a process of affinity maturation (17Muramatsu M. Kinoshita K. Fagarasan S.

Kinoshita K. Fagarasan S. Yamada S. Shinkai Y. Honjo T.

Immunol. 2008; 26: 261-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). AID in unimmunized stress-treated mice showed no significant change (Fig. 6C), but in the OVA-immunized mice, it was significantly increased (F = 3.78, p = 0.02), mostly after re-stimulation with OVA and all stress agents (F = 39.0 p < 0.0001, Fig. 6, B and C, and gating in Fig. 6, C and D). We have then tested any correlation between AID and CD40L using paired cells from 40 mice, as described for CD40L with maIl-15 and IL-1β (Fig. 2, C and D). It is interesting that two functional readings of CD40L in CD4+ T cells and AID in CD19+ B cells should be significantly correlated (p = 0.02, Fig. 6E). This raises the possibility that the stress agents may up-regulate AID in B cells through an interaction between CD40L in T cells and CD40 in B cells. Any correlation between the H and I pathways of CD4+CD44+ T or CD19+CD27+ B memory cells was further explored with reference to IL-15 and IL-1β. Again, this used paired cells from 40 mice, as described above. Indeed, DC maIL-15 showed near direct correlation with CD4+CD44+ memory T cells (p = 0.054, Fig. 7A), reaching strong significance with CD44+CD62L− effector memory T cells (p < 0.0001, Fig. 7B), as well as with CD19+CD27+ memory B cells (p = 0.009, Fig. 7C). However, significant correlation was found between IL-1β and CD4+CD44+ memory T cells (p = 0.007, Fig. 7D) and effector memory T cells (p = 0.005, Fig. 7E), but not with CD19+CD27+ memory B cells (Fig. 7F). The data are consistent with the present and previous finding (15Wang Y. Lavender P. Watson J. Arno M. Lehner T. Stress-activated dendritic cells (DC) induce dual interleukin (IL)-15- and IL1β-mediated pathways, which may elicit CD4+ memory T cells and interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes.J. Biol.

One of the functions of AID is CSR, which elicits class switch antibody isotypes from IgM to IgG, IgA, and IgE. Here we have assayed by ELISA the IgM, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG3, and IgA antibody classes to OVA and the total concentrations of these immunoglobulins. There was little or no increase in any of the antibody classes in response to treatment with the stress agents in the unimmunized mice (Fig. 8A). However, in the OVA-immunized animals, IgG1-specific antibodies were significantly increased (F = 8.86, p = 0.0005) when treated with all but sodium arsenite (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001, Fig. 8A). IgG2a and IgG3 were not significantly affected by stress (data not shown). IgA antibodies to OVA were significantly up-regulated (p < 0.005; F = 6.18), but only with Gramicidin (p < 0.01; Fig. 8B). Surprisingly, IgM antibodies to OVA were also significantly increased (F = 11.78, p < 0.0001, Fig. 8C), although only to dithiocarbamate and alum (p < 0.005). Although the increases in IgM and IgA antibody titers were significant, they were about a tenth of those seen with IgG1 antibodies. It is noteworthy that AID showed significant direct correlation with IgG1 (r = 0.551, p = 0.007, Fig. 8D) and IgM (r = 0.796, p < 0.0001, Fig. 8F), but not with IgA, the titer of which was only slightly increased (Fig. 8E). It is not clear whether SHM and/or CSR are involved, as both are mediated by AID (20Barreto V. Reina-San-Martin B. Ramiro A.R. McBride K.M. Nussenzweig M.C. C-terminal deletion of AID uncouples class switch recombination from somatic hypermutation and gene conversion.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 501-508Ab"

More specifically, this requirement must account for conditions that could artificially inflate the effect of a programme, such as the fluidity of the local labour market or the performance of the local job centre. Failure to achieve representativeness results in Cluster Sampling Bias (CSB). This paper makes three contributions to the literature. Theoretically, it approaches the notion of CSB as a human behaviour. It offers a comprehensive theory, whereby researchers with limited resources and conflicting priorities tend to oversample ‘effect-enhancing’ clusters when piloting a new intervention. Methodologically, it advocates for a ‘narrow and deep’ scope, as opposed to the ‘wide and shallow’ scope, which has prevailed so far. The PILOT-2 dataset was developed to test this idea. Empirically, it provides evidence on the prevalence of CSB. In conditions similar to the PILOT-2 case study, investigators (1) do not sample clusters with a view to maximise generalisability; (2) do not oversample ‘effect-enhancing’ clusters; (3) consistently oversample some clusters, including those with higher-than-average client caseloads; and (4) report their sampling decisions in an inconsistent and generally poor manner. In conclusion, although CSB is prevalent, it is still unclear whether it is intentional and meant to mislead stakeholders about the expected effect of the intervention or due to higher-level constraints or other considerations."

As existing vaccines against H. somni infection have shown to be of limited efficacy, we used a reverse vaccinology approach to identify new vaccine candidates. Three groups (B, C, D) of cattle were immunized with subunit vaccines and a control group (group A) was vaccinated with adjuvant alone. All four groups were challenged with H. somni. The results demonstrate that there was no significant difference in clinical signs, joint lesions, weight change or rectal temperature between any of the vaccinated groups (B,C,D) vs the control group A. However, the trend to protection was greatest for group C vaccinates. The group C vaccine was a pool of six recombinant proteins. Serum antibody responses determined using ELISA showed significantly higher titers for group C, with P values ranging from < 0.0148 to < 0.0002, than group A. Even though serum antibody titers in group B (5 out of 6 antigens) and group D were significantly higher compared to group A, they exerted less of a trend towards protection. In conclusion, the vaccine used in group C exhibits a trend towards protective immunity in cattle and would be a good candidate for further analysis to determine which proteins were responsible for the trend towards protection."
