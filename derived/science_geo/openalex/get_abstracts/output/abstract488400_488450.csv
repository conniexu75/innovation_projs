https://openalex.org/W1988491543,"The HIV/AIDS pandemic and its impact on women prompt the investigation of prevention strategies to interrupt sexual transmission of HIV. Long-acting drug delivery systems that simultaneously protect womenfrom sexual transmission of HIV and unwanted pregnancy could be important tools in combating the pandemic. We describe the design, in silico, in vitro and in vivo evaluation of a dual-reservoir intravaginal ring that delivers the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor tenofovir and the contraceptive levonorgestrel for 90 days. Two polyether urethanes with two different hard segment volume fractions were used to make coaxial extruded reservoir segments with a 100 µm thick rate controlling membrane and a diameter of 5.5 mm that contain 1.3 wt% levonorgestrel. A new mechanistic diffusion model accurately described the levonorgestrel burst release in early time points and pseudo-steady state behavior at later time points. As previously described, tenofovir was formulated as a glycerol paste and filled into a hydrophilic polyurethane, hollow tube reservoir that was melt-sealed by induction welding. These tenofovir-eluting segments and 2 cm long coaxially extruded levonorgestrel eluting segments were joined by induction welding to form rings that released an average of 7.5 mg tenofovir and 21 µg levonorgestrel per day in vitro for 90 days. Levonorgestrel segments placed intravaginally in rabbits resulted in sustained, dose-dependent levels of levonorgestrel in plasma and cervical tissue for 90 days. Polyurethane caps placed between segments successfully prevented diffusion of levonorgestrel into the tenofovir-releasing segment during storage.Hydrated rings endured between 152 N and 354 N tensile load before failure during uniaxial extension testing. In summary, this system represents a significant advance in vaginal drug delivery technology, and is the first in a new class of long-acting multipurpose prevention drug delivery systems."
https://openalex.org/W2052519022,"The emerging infectious amphibian diseases caused by amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, Bd) and ranaviruses are responsible for global amphibian population declines and extinctions. Although likely to have been spread by a variety of activities, transcontinental dispersal appears closely associated with the international trade in live amphibians. The territory of Hong Kong reports frequent, high volume trade in amphibians, and yet the presence of Bd and ranavirus have not previously been detected in either traded or free-ranging amphibians. In 2012, a prospective surveillance project was conducted to investigate the presence of these pathogens in commercial shipments of live amphibians exported from Hong Kong International Airport. Analysis of skin (Bd) and cloacal (ranavirus) swabs by quantitative PCR detected pathogen presence in 31/265 (11.7%) and in 105/185 (56.8%) of amphibians, respectively. In addition, the water in which animals were transported tested positive for Bd, demonstrating the risk of pathogen pollution by the disposal of untreated wastewater. It is uncertain whether Bd and ranavirus remain contained within Hong Kong’s trade sector, or if native amphibians have already been exposed. Rapid response efforts are now urgently needed to determine current pathogen distribution in Hong Kong, evaluate potential trade-associated exposure to free-ranging amphibians, and identify opportunities to prevent disease establishment."
https://openalex.org/W1983660153,"There is an urgent need for new therapeutic avenues to improve the outcome of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Current studies have suggested that cucurbitacin I, a natural selective inhibitor of JAK2/STAT3, has a potent anticancer effect on a variety of cancer cell types. This study showed that autophagy and apoptosis were induced by cucurbitacin I. Exposure of GBM cells to cucurbitacin I resulted in pronounced apoptotic cell death through activating bcl-2 family proteins. Cells treatment with cucurbitacin I up-regulated Beclin 1 and triggered autophagosome formation and accumulation as well as conversion of LC3I to LC3II. Activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin/p70S6K pathway, but not the PI3K/AKT pathway, occurred in autophagy induced by cucurbitacin I, which was accompanied by decreased hypoxia-inducible factor 1α. Stable overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α induced by FG-4497 prevented cucurbitacin I-induced autophagy and down-regulation of bcl-2. Knockdown of beclin 1 or treatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine also inhibited autophagy induced by cucurbitacin I. A coimmunoprecipitation assay showed that the interaction of Bcl-2 and Beclin 1/hVps34 decreased markedly in cells treated with cucurbitacin I. Furthermore, knockdown of beclin 1 or treatment with the lysosome inhibitor chloroquine sensitized cancer cells to cucurbitacin I-induced apoptosis. Finally, a xenograft model provided additional evidence for the occurrence of cucurbitacin I-induced apoptosis and autophagy in vitro. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cucurbitacin I-mediated GBM cell death and may provide an efficacious therapy for patients harboring GBM."
https://openalex.org/W2028017696,"Regulation of endothelial cell biology by the Notch signaling pathway (Notch) is essential to vascular development, homeostasis, and sprouting angiogenesis. Although Notch determines cell fate and differentiation in a wide variety of cells, the molecular basis of upstream regulation of Notch remains poorly understood. Our group and others have implicated the Krüppel-like factor family of transcription factors as critical regulators of endothelial function. Here, we show that Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is a central regulator of sprouting angiogenesis via regulating Notch. Using a murine model in which KLF4 is overexpressed exclusively in the endothelium, we found that sustained expression of KLF4 promotes ineffective angiogenesis leading to diminished tumor growth independent of endothelial cell proliferation or cell cycling effects. These tumors feature increased vessel density yet are hypoperfused, leading to tumor hypoxia. Mechanistically, we show that KLF4 differentially regulates expression of Notch receptors, ligands, and target genes. We also demonstrate that KLF4 limits cleavage-mediated activation of Notch1. Finally, we rescue Notch target gene expression and the KLF4 sprouting angiogenesis phenotype by supplementation of DLL4 recombinant protein. Identification of this hitherto undiscovered role of KLF4 implicates this transcription factor as a critical regulator of Notch, tumor angiogenesis, and sprouting angiogenesis.

Identification of this hitherto undiscovered role of KLF4 implicates this transcription factor as a critical regulator of Notch, tumor angiogenesis, and sprouting angiogenesis. Formation of a functional vascular network via sprouting angiogenesis occurs by a coordinated series of events including selection of a leading tip cell, sprout elongation and stalk formation, branching, anastomosis, pruning, and finally, stabilization of the connected network. The Notch family of ligands, receptors, and transcription factors (Notch) has critical but incompletely understood roles in vascular development (1.Iso T. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. Notch signaling in vascular development.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Mouse models null for the Notch receptor NOTCH1 and the Notch ligands DLL1, DLL4, and JAG1 are embryonic lethal, demonstrating a failure to remodel the primitive vascular plexus with defective arterial branching and hemorrhage (2.Krebs L.T.

Tip cells are specialized endothelial cells (ECs) 3The abbreviations used are: ECendothelial cellKLFKrüppel-like factorHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellqPCRquantitative PCRGFRgrowth factor-reducedANOVAanalysis of varianceIHCimmunohistochemicalPCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenNICDNotch intracellular domainTgtransgenicEVempty vector. that lead to outgrowth of new sprouting vessels. Studies have shown that increased tip cell expression of the Notch ligand DLL4 suppresses the tip cell phenotype in adjacent endothelial cells resulting in coordinated, effective sprouting and network formation (6.Hellström M. Phng L.K. Hofmann J.J. Wallgard E. Coultas L. Lindblom P. Alva J. Nilsson A.K. Karlsson L. Gaiano N. Yoon K. Rossant J. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Kalén M. Gerhardt H. Betsholtz C. Dll4 signalling through Notch1 regulates formation of tip cells during angiogenesis.Nature. 2007; 445: 776-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). This DLL4-mediated lateral inhibition of DLL4 expression encourages neighboring EC to become the proliferating stalk cells that make up the lumenized body of the developing vessel. In the absence of DLL4-NOTCH1 signaling, all sprouting ECs become tip cells and an organized, mature vascular network is not formed (7.Phng L.K. Gerhardt H. Angiogenesis: a team effort coordinated by notch.Dev. Cell. 2009; 16: 196-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Dynamic fluctuation of DLL4 expression occurs at the cellular level during normal sprouting angiogenesis in vertebrates and Drosophila melanogaster (8.Jakobsson L. Franco C.A. Bentley K. Collins R.T.

Competitive interactions between cells: death, growth, and geography.Science. 2009; 324: 1679-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In mouse models, this dynamic DLL4 expression pattern is partially due to utilization of a VEGF-VEGFR-DLL4-Notch-VEGFR feedback loop (8.Jakobsson L. Franco C.A. Bentley K. Collins R.T. Ponsioen B.

Krüppel-like factors (KLFs) are increasingly appreciated as key regulators of endothelial cell biology. KLFs are members of the zinc finger family of transcription factors known to play important roles in the regulation of cellular growth and differentiation (10.McConnell B.B. Yang V.W. Mammalian Krüppel-like factors in health and diseases.Physiol. Rev. 2010; 90: 1337-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Our group has previously shown that Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is regulated by physiologic stimuli (e.g. shear stress and inflammatory stimuli); and KLF4 regulates key endothelial targets that modulate the inflammatory and coagulant state of the endothelium (11.Hamik A. Lin Z. Kumar A. Balcells M. Sinha S. Katz J. Feinberg M.W. Gerzsten R.E. Edelman E.R. Jain M.K. Krüppel-like factor 4 regulates endothelial inflammation.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13769-13779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). More recently, using a mouse model of atherothrombosis, we have unequivocally demonstrated that EC KLF4 is an important in vivo regulator of critical endothelial functions (12.Zhou G. Hamik A. Nayak L. Tian H. Shi H. Lu Y. Sharma N. Liao X. Hale A. Boerboom L. Feaver R.E. Gao H. Desai A. Schmaier A. Gerson S.L. Wang Y. Atkins G.B. Blackman B.R. Simon D.I. Jain M.K. Endothelial Krüppel-like factor 4 protects against atherothrombosis in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2012; 122: 4727-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, a role of endothelial KLF4 in neovascularization has not yet been described. Herein, we propose that KLF4 is an upstream regulator of Notch expression and that sustained expression of KLF4 leads to ineffective angiogenesis, resulting in pronounced attenuation of tumor growth. It is becoming apparent that dual anti-angiogenesis therapy will be required to treat tumors as many become resistant to anti-VEGF therapy alone (13.Wang Z. Li Y. Ahmad A. Azmi A.S. Banerjee S. Kong D. Sarkar F.H. Targeting Notch signaling pathway to overcome drug resistance for cancer therapy.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1806: 258-267PubMed Google Scholar). In recent years, combination anti-tumor therapy using anti-VEGF agents coupled with controlled expression of DLL4 has been an active area of discussion (14.Li J.L. Harris A.L. Crosstalk of VEGF and Notch pathways in tumour angiogenesis: therapeutic implications.Front. Biosci. 2009; 14: 3094-3110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, the upstream signaling pathways that regulate expression of Notch in blood vessels have remained largely unknown (15.Zhang J. Fukuhara S. Sako K. Takenouchi T. Kitani H. Kume T. Koh G.Y. Mochizuki N. Angiopoietin-1/Tie2 signal augments basal Notch signal controlling vascular quiescence by inducing delta-like 4 expression through AKT-mediated activation of β-catenin.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 8055-8066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We have discovered that endothelial transcription factor KLF4 regulates mammalian neovascularization with a phenotype reminiscent of Dll4 blockade (16.Noguera-Troise I. Daly C. Papadopoulos N.J. Coetzee S. Boland P. Gale N.W. Lin H.C. Yancopoulos G.D. Thurston G.

Signaling inhibits tumour growth by deregulating angiogenesis.Nature. 2006; 444: 1083-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar) suggesting that KLF4-mediated regulation of Notch may be an attractive therapeutic target. EC-KLF4 Tg mice are on a C57BL/6 background and were generated in our laboratory using a VE-Cadherin promoter (gift of K. Walsh, Boston University, Boston, MA) driving the expression of a human KLF4 transgene. Mice were assessed for EC-specific overexpression previously by protein levels (12.Zhou G. Hamik A. Nayak L.

All animals and protocols were used in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Case Western Reserve University and the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Subcutaneous injection of 1–2.5 × 106 pathogen-free B16-F10 melanoma cells into the rear flank was performed in 8–12-week-old WT and EC-K4 Tg mice (6 experiments of n = 4–14 animals per group) as previously described (18.Overwijk W.W. Restifo N.P. B16 as a mouse model for human melanoma.Curr. Prot. Immunol. 2009; 39: 20.1.1-20.1.29Google Scholar). Eight to 10 days after injection animals were sacrificed and tumors were harvested, weighed, and photographed. One hour prior to sacrifice Hypoxyprobe (60 mg/kg; Chemicon; HP2–1000) was administered via intraperitoneal injection and 5 min prior to sacrifice 100 μl of FITC-labeled Lycopersicon esculentum lectin (20 μg/ml; Vector Laboratories; FL1171) was administered intravenously. Spheroid formation assays were performed as previously described (19.Zhao X. Lu X. Feng Q. Deficiency in endothelial nitric oxide synthase impairs myocardial angiogenesis.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2002; 283: H2371-H2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Fifty μl/well of Matrigel diluted 1:1 in cold serum-free DMEM was pipetted into a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C for ∼1 h. The diluted Matrigel was supplemented with either 0.2 μg/ml of recombinant DLL4-Fc (Abcam, ab108557) or IgG-Fc isotype control (Abcam, ab90295). 3 × 104 primary mouse cardiac EC were then seeded into each well and cultured in DMEM containing 20% FBS, 25 μg of endothelial cell growth supplement, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% heparin. The cells were allowed to grow for 3–4 days until visible sprouts were observed. The cells were subsequently fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and imaged (×100) using an inverted photomicroscope. Endothelial structures 0.19 mm or larger were considered sprouts. Quantification was performed using ImageJ (NIH). 96-Well plates were coated with 10 μg/ml of recombinant DLL4-Fc (Sinobiologicals, 10171-H02H) or IgG-Fc isotype control (Abcam, ab90295) suspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), incubated at room temperature for ∼6 h, and aspirated off before EC seeding. The tissue culture plate was rinsed with warmed PBS before 1.5 × 104 HUVEC/well were seeded and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. The cells were rinsed with warmed PBS, then lysed and harvested for gene expression analysis. Two wells were pooled for RNA isolation and considered as n = 1. Each experiment was performed using an n = 3 for each condition and repeated three times. Data were pooled from all experiments and are represented as relative gene expression normalized to empty virus (EV) IgG. Statistical significance was determined using a one-way unstacked ANOVA. We assessed Notch activity in transfection experiments using a CSL concatemer reporter (CBX4) and cotransfection of NICD and KLF4 expression plasmids. Notch activation was determined using a Veritas luminometer (Promega) and data are expressed as relative luciferase units. We determined the effect of KLF4 on activation of Notch target gene activity using a HES1 promoter-reporter construct. We also performed assays in which we adenovirally overexpressed KLF4 and NICD to determine patterns of interaction between these transcriptional regulators on endogenous Notch family members and Notch target gene expression. The ICN (described here as NICD) retrovirus was created as previously described (20.Weng A.P. Nam Y. Wolfe M.S. Pear W.S. Griffin J.D. Blacklow S.C. Aster J.C. Growth suppression of pre-T acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells by inhibition of Notch signaling.Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Murine cardiac EC were isolated as described previously (12.Zhou G. Hamik A. Nayak L. Tian H. Shi H. Lu Y. Sharma N. Liao X. Hale A. Boerboom L. Feaver R.E. Gao H. Desai A. Schmaier A. Gerson S.L. Wang Y. Atkins G.B. Blackman B.R. Simon D.I. Jain M.K. Endothelial Krüppel-like factor 4 protects against atherothrombosis in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2012; 122: 4727-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Hearts from 5 mice were pooled, sorted, and purified using Dynal beads (Invitrogen, 110.07) at a concentration of 4 × 108 beads/ml. The first purification round was performed using an anti-PECAM antibody, and the second using an anti-ICAM antibody (BD Pharmigen, 553370 and 553325, respectively). Murine EC were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 50 mg of endothelial cell growth supplement, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1% Fungizone, and 1% heparin. EC at passages 1–3 were used for all experiments. HUVEC were isolated as previously described (22.Crampton S.P. Davis J. Hughes C.C. Isolation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC).J. Vis. Exp. 2007; 3: 183PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Baudin B. Bruneel A. Bosselut N. Vaubourdolle M. A protocol for isolation and culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells.Nature Protocols. 2007; 2: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). De-identified umbilical cords were collected from the maternity ward at University Hospitals Case Medical Center with institutional consent. Cords of 10–30 cm of length were used for all studies. Briefly, the umbilical vein was flushed with 1× Hanks' balanced salt solution to remove blood. The vein was then clamped using a hemostat and filled with 0.2% (w/v) collagenase (Roche, 103586) until the vein was moderately distended. The cord was then massaged gently prior to incubation at room temperature for 30 min. The collagenase digest was collected and a final volume of 50 ml was obtained with additional Hanks' balanced salt solution. The material was centrifuged at ∼1200 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet resuspended in 10 ml of EBM-2 media (Lonza, CC-3162) with EGM-2 aliquots (Lonza, CC-4176) and seeded on plates coated with 0.1% gelatin. The resulting cell culture was incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For all cell cultures past p1, EBM-2 media with EGM-2 aliquots was used. All primary HUVEC used were at p1–4 and commercial HUVEC were p1–7. All studies were performed with HUVEC we isolated from umbilical cords, commercially obtained (Lonza) HUVEC, or human aortic endothelial cells. Similar results were obtained from each cell source. Efficacy of adeno- or lentiviral infection was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of total cellular RNA isolated from the respective cell source. The adenovirus overexpresses human KLF4 (Ad-K4), whereas the lentivirus overexpressing KLF4 (Lenti-K4) contains a mouse transgene (pLOVE-KLF4, Addgene plasmid number 15950; control EV is pLOVE, Addgene plasmid number 15948). Effects on gene expression in all overexpression experiments were assessed 2 days after virus infection. Appropriate empty viral constructs were used as controls. Knockdown of KLF4 was achieved using Dharmacon On-Target siRNA plus (J-005089-09, 9314; K4−/−) and appropriate non-targeting siRNA control (D-001810-01-05; NS). Effects on gene expression were assessed 2 days after transfection. RNA isolation was performed using either the High-Pure RNA isolation kit (Roche, 11828665001) or Aqueous-Micro kit (Ambion, AM1931). Reverse transcription was subsequently performed using iScript (Bio-Rad, 170-8891) or Quantitect Reverse Transcription kits (Qiagen, 205311). Isolation of RNA from tumor samples was performed using PureZol and the Aurum Total RNA Fatty and Fibrous Tissue Kit (Bio-Rad, 732-6830). Hypoxia was induced for ∼16 h using a hypoxia chamber that maintains O2 levels at 3%. All qPCR reagents used were from Light Cycler 480 kits (Roche, 04887-301001 or -352001) using probes from the Roche Universal Probe Library or SYBR Green. Gene expression was normalized to SDHA, β-actin, GAPDH, 36B4, or Pecam using the ΔΔCp method and shown as relative fold-change to the respective control.

We then derived the copy number from the line of best fit for the standard curve using the Cp for KLF4 from our cell/tissue samples. ChIP assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Millipore, 17-295). Briefly, HUVEC were infected with EV or an adenovirus overexpressing human KLF4 (Ad-K4) for 48 h, then fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min. The fixed HUVEC were then washed in cold PBS (with protease inhibitors), scraped, and resuspended in lysis buffer. DNA was sheared to fragments between ∼200 and 1,000 bp in size. The cell lysate was collected and diluted 10-fold, followed by treatment with protein A-agarose/salmon sperm DNA slurry. The supernatant was then incubated with 5 μg of KLF4 antibody (Sigma, HPA002926) or IgG control overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitant was collected by pulldown with protein A-agarose/salmon sperm DNA slurry and washed.

Rabbit anti-human cleaved NOTCH1 (NICD) (1:500; Cell Signaling, 2421) was used with an anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling; 7074S) and ECL Plus chemiluminescent detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometry was performed using ImageJ (NIH), and represents data pooled from four separate blots using HUVEC derived from separate umbilical cords. Sprout formation assays with HUVEC were performed using growth factor-reduced (GFR) and regular Matrigel (BD Biosciences, 354230 and 354234) as previously described (21.Williams C.K. Li J.L. Murga M. Harris A.L. Tosato G. Upregulation of the notch ligand δ-like 4 inhibits VEGF-induced endothelial cell function.Blood. 2006; 107: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Growth factor-enriched (normal) or GFR Matrigel was plated in a 12-well plate in triplicate. Using 6 × 105 cells/well, sprouts were allowed to form for ∼6–8 h, then cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and imaged using phase-contract microscopy. Images were analyzed using ImageJ for total cellularity and tubule length, number of tubules, number of nodes, and tubule:node ratio. Data were pooled from 3 experiments using 3 wells per condition and 3 images per well. Data were analyzed using a one-way unstacked ANOVA and Student's t test for paired normoxia-hypoxia samples. Harvested tumors were carefully partitioned in optimal cutting temperature medium, placed on dry ice, and frozen at −80 °C for at least 24 h prior to sectioning; cryosections were cut into 10-μm slides for immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. IHC studies were performed for vessel density analysis by staining for PECAM (1:100; BD Pharmigen, 553370) and KLF4 levels (1:50; R&D Systems, AF3158). Corresponding Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies were used (1:800; Invitrogen, donkey anti-rat, A-21208 and 1:200; Invitrogen, chicken anti-goat, A-21467, respectively). Hypoxyprobe staining was performed using Hypoxyprobe monoclonal antibody conjugated with FITC (1:200; Chemicon, 90529) with corresponding anti-FITC secondary antibody (Chemicon, 90530). Pericyte coverage was assessed using PECAM, Ng-2 (Millipore, AB5320), and laminin (Covance, PRB-432C) antibodies. Assessment of proliferation in tumors was performed by co-staining for 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, GBI Labs; E19-18) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA, Cell Signaling Technology; 13110). All data are reported as the mean ± S.E. pooled from all experiments. Analysis between two paired samples was performed using a two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. Analysis between more than two sample groups was performed using a one-way unstacked ANOVA (Minitab). For all data, statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05 and notated by an asterisk (*). We first sought to determine the role of KLF4 in regulating angiogenesis-associated genes in vitro using overexpression and knockdown experiments and assessing target gene expression by qPCR. These experiments were performed using HUVEC infected with Lenti-K4, achieving ∼7-fold overexpression, or KLF4 siRNA (K4−/−) achieving ∼80% knockdown, and appropriate EV and NS controls, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). Overexpression and knockdown of KLF4 was assessed by fold-change (Fig. 1A) and copy number analysis (Fig. 1B). Overexpression of KLF4 promotes expression of canonical angiogenesis-associated target genes HIF-1α, VEGFR1, and eNOS, whereas decreasing VEGFR2 expression levels (Fig. 1C, left panel). Knockdown of KLF4 leads to decreased expression of HIF-1α, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and eNOS (Fig. 1C, right panel). Overexpression of KLF4 leads to increased VEGFA expression independent of hypoxia (3% O2) (Fig. 1D, left panel). Knockdown of KLF4 limits VEGFA expression independently of hypoxia (Fig. 1D, right panel). Similar results were obtained in commercially available Lonza HUVEC and human aortic endothelial cells. Endogenous KLF4 expression was induced by hypoxia (Fig. 1E). Briefly, we overexpressed human KLF4 in HUVEC and immunoprecipitated KLF4 bound to target DNA. We designed primers flanking the putative KLF4 binding site CACCC to determine fold-enrichment of KLF4 on target promoters. Limited mechanistic studies (ChIP) demonstrate enrichment of KLF4 at specific CACCC sites in the promoters of VEGFA, VEGFR1, and VEGFR2 (Fig. 1F). These findings suggest that KLF4 expression is sensitive to angiogenic stimuli and that KLF4 plays a direct role in transcriptional regulation of angiogenesis. Next, we utilized an in vitro Matrigel model of sprouting angiogenesis in the context of EC overexpression and knockdown of KLF4 and exposure to hypoxia to study the effect of KLF4 on sprout formation. Notably, sustained overexpression of KLF4 markedly increased the total cellular area in normal Matrigel cultures independently of and synergistically with hypoxia, demonstrating enhanced overall sprout formation (Fig. 2A). Hypoxia, a potent stimulus of neovascularization, increased the number of sprouts and number of nodes in a similar manner to overexpression of KLF4 (Fig. 2B). In GFR Matrigel, KLF4-stimulated increases in the cellular area, sprouts, and nodes are even more prominent than those induced by hypoxia (Fig. 2, C and D). We observed no difference in the sprout:node ratio or average sprout length with either hypoxia or sustained KLF4 expression in GFR Matrigel (Fig. 2, C and D). Representative images are show"
https://openalex.org/W2122613105,"Background We investigated the relationship between average monthly temperature and the most common clinical pathogens causing infections in intensive care patients. Methods A prospective unit-based study in 73 German intensive care units located in 41 different hospitals and 31 different cities with total 188,949 pathogen isolates (102,377 Gram-positives and 86,572 Gram-negatives) from 2001 to 2012. We estimated the relationship between the number of clinical pathogens per month and the average temperature in the month of isolation and in the month prior to isolation while adjusting for confounders and long-term trends using time series analysis. Adjusted incidence rate ratios for temperature parameters were estimated based on generalized estimating equation models which account for clustering effects. Results The incidence density of Gram-negative pathogens was 15% (IRR 1.15, 95%CI 1.10–1.21) higher at temperatures ≥20°C than at temperatures below 5°C. E. cloacae occurred 43% (IRR = 1.43; 95%CI 1.31–1.56) more frequently at high temperatures, A. baumannii 37% (IRR = 1.37; 95%CI 1.11–1.69), S. maltophilia 32% (IRR = 1.32; 95%CI 1.12–1.57), K. pneumoniae 26% (IRR = 1.26; 95%CI 1.13–1.39), Citrobacter spp. 19% (IRR = 1.19; 95%CI 0.99–1.44) and coagulase-negative staphylococci 13% (IRR = 1.13; 95%CI 1.04–1.22). By contrast, S. pneumoniae 35% (IRR = 0.65; 95%CI 0.50–0.84) less frequently isolated at high temperatures. For each 5°C increase, we observed a 3% (IRR = 1.03; 95%CI 1.02–1.04) increase of Gram-negative pathogens. This increase was highest for A. baumannii with 8% (IRR = 1.08; 95%CI 1.05–1.12) followed by K. pneumoniae, Citrobacter spp. and E. cloacae with 7%. Conclusion Clinical pathogens vary by incidence density with temperature. Significant higher incidence densities of Gram-negative pathogens were observed during summer whereas S. pneumoniae peaked in winter. There is increasing evidence that different seasonality due to physiologic changes underlies host susceptibility to different bacterial pathogens. Even if the underlying mechanisms are not yet clear, the temperature-dependent seasonality of pathogens has implications for infection control and study design."

https://openalex.org/W2047800295,"Invasive rodent species have established on 80% of the world's islands causing significant damage to island environments. Insular ecosystems support proportionally more biodiversity than comparative mainland areas, highlighting them as critical for global biodiversity conservation. Few techniques currently exist to adequately detect, with high confidence, species that are trap-adverse such as the black rat, Rattus rattus, in high conservation priority areas where multiple non-target species persist. This study investigates the effectiveness of camera trapping for monitoring invasive rodents in high conservation areas, and the influence of habitat features and density of colonial-nesting seabirds on rodent relative activity levels to provide insights into their potential impacts. A total of 276 camera sites were established and left in situ for 8 days. Identified species were recorded in discrete 15 min intervals, referred to as 'events'. In total, 19 804 events were recorded. From these, 31 species were identified comprising 25 native species and six introduced. Two introduced rodent species were detected: the black rat (90% of sites), and house mouse Mus musculus (56% of sites). Rodent activity of both black rats and house mice were positively associated with the structural density of habitats. Density of seabird burrows was not strongly associated with relative activity levels of rodents, yet rodents were still present in these areas. Camera trapping enabled a large number of rodents to be detected with confidence in site-specific absences and high resolution to quantify relative activity levels. This method enables detection of multiple species simultaneously with low impact (for both target and non-target individuals); an ideal strategy for monitoring trap-adverse invasive rodents in high conservation areas."

We examined 11,870 GenBank records to provide a baseline inventory and insight into patterns of global AIV subtype diversity and richness. Further, we conducted an extensive literature review and communicated directly with scientists to accumulate data from 50 non-overlapping studies and over 250,000 birds to assess the status of historic sampling effort. We then built virus subtype sample-based accumulation curves to better estimate sample size targets that capture a specific percentage of virus subtype richness at seven sampling locations. Our study identifies a sampling methodology that will detect an estimated 75% of circulating virus subtypes from a targeted bird population and outlines future surveillance and research priorities that are needed to explore the influence of host and virus biodiversity on emergence and transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2134351178,"Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumour characterized by osteoid production and/or osteolytic lesions of bone. A lack of response to chemotherapeutic treatments shows the importance of exploring new therapeutic methods. Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, Novartis Pharma), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was originally developed for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Several studies revealed that imatinib mesylate inhibits osteoclast differentiation through the M-CSFR pathway and activates osteoblast differentiation through PDGFR pathway, two key cells involved in the vicious cycle controlling the tumour development. The present study investigated the in vitro effects of imatinib mesylate on the proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, and migration ability of five osteosarcoma cell lines (human: MG-63, HOS; rat: OSRGA; mice: MOS-J, POS-1). Imatinib mesylate was also assessed as a curative and preventive treatment in two syngenic osteosarcoma models: MOS-J (mixed osteoblastic/osteolytic osteosarcoma) and POS-1 (undifferentiated osteosarcoma). Imatinib mesylate exhibited a dose-dependent anti-proliferative effect in all cell lines studied. The drug induced a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in most cell lines, except for POS-1 and HOS cells that were blocked in the S phase. In addition, imatinib mesylate induced cell death and strongly inhibited osteosarcoma cell migration. In the MOS-J osteosarcoma model, oral administration of imatinib mesylate significantly inhibited the tumour development in both preventive and curative approaches. A phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase array kit revealed that PDGFRα, among 7 other receptors (PDFGFRβ, Axl, RYK, EGFR, EphA2 and 10, IGF1R), appears as one of the main molecular targets for imatinib mesylate. In the light of the present study and the literature, it would be particularly interesting to revisit therapeutic evaluation of imatinib mesylate in osteosarcoma according to the tyrosine-kinase receptor status of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2048678996,"Evolution by natural selection depends on the relationship between individual traits and fitness. Variation in individual fitness can result from habitat (territory) quality and individual variation. Individual quality and specialization can have a deep impact on fitness, yet in most studies on territorial species the quality of territory and individuals are confused. We aimed to determine if variation in breeding success is better explained by territories, individual quality or a combination of both. We analysed the number of fledglings and the breeding quality index (the difference between the number of fledglings of an individual/breeding pair and the average number of fledglings of the monitored territories in the same year) as part of a long term (16 years) peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) monitoring program with identification of individuals. Using individual and territory identities as correlates of quality, we built Generalised Linear Models with Mixed effects, in which random factors depicted different hypotheses for sources of variation (territory/individual quality) in the reproductive success of unique breeding pairs, males and females, and assessed their performance. Most evidence supported the hypothesis that variation in breeding success is explained by individual identity, particularly male identity, rather than territory. There is also some evidence for inter year variations in the breeding success of females and a territory effect in the case of males. We argue that, in territorial species, individual quality is a major source of variation in breeding success, often masked by territory. Future ecological and conservation studies on habitat use should consider and include the effect of individuals, in order to avoid misleading results."
https://openalex.org/W2062250273,"Early-life stress (ELS) in mice causes sustained hypomethylation at the downstream Avp enhancer, subsequent overexpression of hypothalamic Avp and increased stress responsivity. The sequence of events leading to Avp enhancer methylation is presently unknown. Here, we used an embryonic stem cell-derived model of hypothalamic-like differentiation together with in vivo experiments to show that binding of polycomb complexes (PcG) preceded the emergence of ELS-responsive DNA methylation and correlated with gene silencing. At the same time, PcG occupancy associated with the presence of Tet proteins preventing DNA methylation. Early hypothalamic-like differentiation triggered PcG eviction, DNA-methyltransferase recruitment and enhancer methylation. Concurrently, binding of the Methyl-CpG-binding and repressor protein MeCP2 increased at the enhancer although Avp expression during later stages of differentiation and the perinatal period continued to increase. Overall, we provide evidence of a new role of PcG proteins in priming ELS-responsive DNA methylation at the Avp enhancer prior to epigenetic programming consistent with the idea that PcG proteins are part of a flexible silencing system during neuronal development."

Materials and Methods Cross-sectional data from participants aged 40–75 years: 4,672 white and 1,348 migrant South Asian participants from ADDITION-Leicester (UK) and 985 indigenous South Asians from Jaipur Heart Watch/New Delhi studies (India). Cut-points were derived using fractional polynomial models with fasting and 2-hour glucose as outcomes, and ethnicity, objectively-measured BMI/WC, their interaction and age as covariates. Results Based on fasting glucose, obesity cut-points were 25 kg/m2 (95% Confidence Interval: 24, 26) for migrant South Asian, and 18 kg/m2 (16, 20) for indigenous South Asian populations. For men, WC cut-points were 90 cm (85, 95) for migrant South Asian, and 87 cm (82, 91) for indigenous South Asian populations. For women, WC cut-points were 77 cm (71, 82) for migrant South Asian, and 54 cm (20, 63) for indigenous South Asian populations. Cut-points based on 2-hour glucose were lower than these. Conclusions These findings strengthen evidence that health interventions are required at a lower BMI and WC for South Asian individuals. Based on our data and the existing literature, we suggest an obesity threshold of 25 kg/m2 for South Asian individuals, and a very high WC threshold of 90 cm for South Asian men and 77 cm for South Asian women. Further work is required to determine whether lower cut-points are required for indigenous, than migrant, South Asians."
https://openalex.org/W2041011994,"Background Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been found to produce beneficial effects on ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, most of the MSCs died when transplanted into the ischemic tissue, which severely limit their therapeutic potential. Methods Using an in vitro model of hypoxia and serum deprivation (H/SD), we investigated the hypothesis that sevoflurane preconditioning could protect MSCs against H/SD-induced apoptosis and improve their migration, proliferation, and therapeutic potential. The H/SD of MSCs and neuron-like PC12 cells were incubated in a serum-free medium and an oxygen concentration below 0.1% for 24 h. Sevoflurane preconditioning was performed through a 2-h incubation of MSCs in an airtight chamber filled with 2 vol% sevoflurane. Apoptosis of MSCs or neuron-like PC12 cells was assessed using Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI). Furthermore, the mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed using lipophilic cationic probe. The proliferation rate was evaluated through cell cycle analysis. Finally, HIF-1α, HIF-2α, VEGF and p-Akt/Akt levels were measured by western blot. Results Sevoflurane preconditioning minimized the MSCs apoptosis and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, it increased the migration and expression of HIF-1α, HIF-2α, VEGF, and p-Akt/Akt, reduced by H/SD. In addition, neuron-like PC12 cells were more resistant to H/SD-induced apoptosis when they were co-cultured with sevoflurane preconditioning MSCs. Conclusion These findings suggest that sevoflurane preconditioning produces protective effects on survival and migration of MSCs against H/SD, as well as improving the therapeutic potential of MSCs. These beneficial effects might be mediated at least in part by upregulating HIF-1α, HIF-2α, VEGF, and p-Akt/Akt."
https://openalex.org/W2067375138,"DNA damage to cochlear hair cells caused by 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) is essential for the development of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Human 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase1 (hOGG1) is a key enzyme in the base excision repair (BER) pathway that eliminates 8-oxoG. Many epidemiological and functional studies have suggested that the hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism (rs1052133) is associated with many diseases. The purpose of this investigation was to investigate whether the hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism in the human BER pathway is associated with genetic susceptibility to NIHL in a Chinese population. This polymorphism was genotyped among 612 workers with NIHL and 615 workers with normal hearing. We found that individuals with the hOGG1 Cys/Cys genotype had a statistically significantly increased risk of NIHL compared with those who carried the hOGG1 Ser/Ser genotype (adjusted OR=1.59, 95% CI=1.13-2.25) and this increased risk was more pronounced among the workers in the 15- to 25- and >25-year noise exposure time, 85-92 dB(A) noise exposure level, ever smoking, and ever drinking groups, similar effects were also observed in a recessive model. In summary, our data suggested that the hOGG1 Cys/Cys genotype may be a genetic susceptibility marker for NIHL in the Chinese Han population."

Due to the ability to produce and release various soluble mediators, neutrophils may participate in the regulation of the inflammatory response. Little is known about the role of neutrophils during protozoan infections including infection by Trypanosoma cruzi. In the present study we investigated the importance of inflammatory neutrophils on macrophage activation and T. cruzi replication in vitro, in cells obtained from BALB/c mice and C57Bl/6 mice. Co-cultures of BALB/c apoptotic or live neutrophils with infected peritoneal macrophages resulted in increased replication of the parasites and in the production of TGF-β and PGE2. The treatment with anti-TGF-β neutralizing antibody and COX inhibitor blocked the parasite replication in vitro. On the other hand, co-cultures of T. cruzi infected macrophages with live neutrophils isolated from C57BL/6 mice resulted in decreased number of trypomastigotes in culture and increased production of TNF-α and NO. The addition of anti-TNF-α neutralizing antibody or elastase inhibitor resulted in the abolishment of macrophage microbicidal effect and increased parasite replication. Addition of elastase to infected macrophages reduced the replication of the parasites, and on the other hand, addition of a selective inhibitor of iNOS increased parasite growth, suggesting the role of NO in this system. Our findings reveal that neutrophils may regulate T. cruzi experimental infection and determine susceptibility and resistance to infection."

The second objective was to examine two aspects of age differences that have not been considered in previous studies: age differences in the variability of sleep measures as well as the magnitude of age differences in phasic events across the distribution of values (i.e., at each decile rather than a single measure of location such as the mean or median. A total of 24 young (mean age=20.75 ± 1.78 years) and 24 older (mean age=71.17 ± 6.15 years) adults underwent in-home polysomnography. Whole-night spindle density was significantly higher in young adults than older adults. The two age groups did not differ significantly in whole-night REM density, although significant increases in REM density across the night were observed in both age groups. These results suggest that spindle density is more affected by age than REM density. Although age differences were observed in the degree of absolute variability (older adults had significantly larger variances than young adults for sleep efficiency and time spent awake after sleep onset), a similar pattern was also observed within the two age groups: the four sleep measures with the lowest degrees of relative variability were the same and included time spent in REM and Stage 2 sleep, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency. The distributional analysis of age differences in sleep spindle density revealed that the largest age differences were initially observed in the middle of the distributions, but as the night progressed, they were seen at the upper end of the distributions. The results reported here have potential implications for the causes and functional implications of age-related changes in sleep architecture."
https://openalex.org/W2011591603,"Felids generally follow a poly-estrous reproductive strategy. Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) display a different pattern of reproductive cyclicity where physiologically persistent corpora lutea (CLs) induce a mono-estrous condition which results in highly seasonal reproduction. The present study was based around a sono-morphological and endocrine study of captive Eurasian lynx, and a control-study on free-ranging lynx. We verified that CLs persist after pregnancy and pseudo-pregnancy for at least a two-year period. We could show that lynx are able to enter estrus in the following year, while CLs from the previous years persisted in structure and only temporarily reduced their function for the period of estrus onset or birth, which is unique among felids. The almost constant luteal progesterone secretion (average of 5 ng/ml serum) seems to prevent folliculogenesis outside the breeding season and has converted a poly-estrous general felid cycle into a mono-estrous cycle specific for lynx. The hormonal regulation mechanism which causes lynx to have the longest CL lifespan amongst mammals remains unclear. The described non-felid like ovarian physiology appears to be a remarkably non-plastic system. The lynx's reproductive ability to adapt to environmental and anthropogenic changes needs further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2089018194,"Investigations into human norovirus infection, replication and pathogenesis, as well as the development of potential antiviral agents, have been restricted by the lack of a cell culture system for human norovirus. To date, the optimal cell culture surrogate virus model for studying human norovirus biology is the murine norovirus (MNV). In this report we generate a tetracycline-regulated, inducible eukaryotic cell system expressing the entire MNV ORF1 polyprotein. Once induced, the MNV ORF1 polyprotein was faithfully processed to the six mature non-structural proteins that predominately located to a discrete perinuclear region, as has been observed in active MNV infection. Furthermore, we found that expression of the ORF1 polyprotein alone was sufficient to induce apoptosis, characterised by caspase-9 activation and survivin down-regulation. This cell line provides a valuable new tool for studying MNV ORF1 non-structural protein function, screening for potential antiviral agents and acts as a proof-of-principle for such systems to be developed for human noroviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2015715728,"Background Sexual segregation in vertebrate foraging niche is often associated with sexual size dimorphism (SSD), i.e., ecological sexual dimorphism. Although foraging behavior of male and female seabirds can vary markedly, differences in isotopic (carbon, δ13C and nitrogen, δ15N) foraging niche are generally more pronounced within sexually dimorphic species and during phases when competition for food is greater. We examined ecological sexual dimorphism among sympatric nesting Pygoscelis penguins asking whether environmental variability is associated with differences in male and female pre-breeding foraging niche. We predicted that all Pygoscelis species would forage sex-specifically, and that higher quality winter habitat, i.e., higher or lower sea ice coverage for a given species, would be associated with a more similar foraging niche among the sexes. Results P2/P8 primers reliably amplified DNA of all species. On average, male Pygoscelis penguins are structurally larger than female conspecifics. However, chinstrap penguins were more sexually dimorphic in culmen and flipper features than Adélie and gentoo penguins. Adélies and gentoos were more sexually dimorphic in body mass than chinstraps. Only male and female chinstraps and gentoos occupied separate δ15N foraging niches. Strong year effects in δ15N signatures were documented for all three species, however, only for Adélies, did yearly variation in δ15N signatures tightly correlate with winter sea ice conditions. There was no evidence that variation in sex-specific foraging niche interacted with yearly winter habitat quality. Conclusion Chinstraps were most sexually size dimorphic followed by gentoos and Adélies. Pre-breeding sex-specific foraging niche was associated with overall SSD indices across species; male chinstrap and gentoo penguins were enriched in δ15N relative to females. Our results highlight previously unknown trophic pathways that link Pygoscelis penguins with variation in Southern Ocean sea ice suggesting that each sex within a species should respond similarly in pre-breeding trophic foraging to changes in future winter habitat."
https://openalex.org/W2006653204,"According to much research, the Own Group Bias (OGB) in face memory occurs as a consequence of social categorization – ingroup members are more likely than outgroup members to be encoded as individuals and remembered well. The current work is an examination of the role of anticipated future interaction in the OGB. We conducted two studies showing that anticipated interaction influences group-based face memory. In Study 1, we provided correlational evidence that beliefs about the amount and importance of future interaction one will have with racial outgroup members is associated with the OGB, such that people expecting more interaction with outgroup members show a reduced OGB. In Study 2, we manipulated expectations about future interactions with lab-created groups and observed that high levels of anticipated future interaction with the outgroup eliminated the OGB. Thus, social group categorization drives face memory biases to the extent that group membership affords the expectation of interpersonal interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2056216302,"The West African Gaboon viper (Bitis rhinoceros) has an extraordinary coloration of pale brown and velvety black markings. The velvety black appearance is caused by a unique hierarchical surface structures which was not found on the pale brown scales. In the present study we examined the wettability of the vipeŕs scales by measuring contact angles of water droplets. Velvet black scale surfaces had high static contact angles beyond 160° and low roll-off angles below 20° indicating an outstanding superhydrophobicity. Our calculations showed that the Cassie-Baxter model describes well wettability effects for these surfaces. Self-cleaning capabilities were determined by contaminating the scales with particles and fogging them until droplets formed. Black scales were clean after fogging, while pale scales stayed contaminated. Black scales feature multifunctional structures providing not only water-repellent but also self-cleaning properties. The pattern of nanoridges can be used as a model for surface-active technical surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1963982713,"The emerging infectious disease chytridiomycosis is driven by the spread of amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, Bd), a highly virulent pathogen threatening global amphibian biodiversity. Although pandemic in distribution, previous intensive field surveys have failed to detect Bd in Madagascar, a biodiversity hotspot home to hundreds of endemic amphibian species. Due to the presence of Bd in nearby continental Africa and the ecological crisis that can be expected following establishment in Madagascar, enhanced surveillance is imperative. I sampled 565 amphibians commercially exported from Madagascar for the presence of Bd upon importation to the USA, both to assist early detection efforts and demonstrate the conservation potential of wildlife trade disease surveillance. Bd was detected in three animals via quantitative PCR: a single Heterixalus alboguttatus, Heterixalus betsileo, and Scaphiophryne spinosa. This is the first time Bd has been confirmed in amphibians from Madagascar and presents an urgent call to action. Our early identification of pathogen presence prior to widespread infection provides the necessary tools and encouragement to catalyze a swift, targeted response to isolate and eradicate Bd from Madagascar. If implemented before establishment occurs, an otherwise likely catastrophic decline in amphibian biodiversity may be prevented."

In our study, a pathogenic organism targeting C. vulgaris was discovered. The algae-lytic activity relates to a fraction from lysates of infected C. vulgaris that was blocked upon filtration through a 3 µm filter. 18S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that it shared 99.0% homology with the protist Pseudobodo tremulans. Scanning electron microscope analysis showed that Pseudobodo sp. KD51 cells were approximately 4-5 µm long, biflagellate with an anterior collar around the anterior part of the cell in unstressed feeding cells. Besides the initial host, Pseudobodo sp. KD51 could also kill other algae, indicating its relatively wide predatory spectrum. Heat stability, pH and salinity tolerance experiments were conducted to understand their effects on its predatory activities, and the results showed that Pseudobodo sp.

https://openalex.org/W2095264293,"of our study was to examine serum inhibin A and inhibin B concentrations in ovarian cancer patients in relation to clinicopathological features and 5-year survival.We enrolled 90 epithelial ovarian cancer patients in our study, aged 45-81 years, who underwent optimal cytoreductive surgery. In all patients, serum inhibin A and inhibin B concentrations were measured using a two-step sandwich type enzyme immunoassay before surgery.In the group of patients with ovarian cancer median serum concentration of inhibin A was 3.87 pg/mL (0.96-10.09) and inhibin B was 13.9 pg/mL (5.1-45.0). Median concentrations of inhibin A and B in relation to FIGO stage and histological subtype did not differ significantly. Inhibin A levels were significantly higher in patients with lower grading (G1 and G2) in comparison to those with higher grade G3 (p=0.001). There were no differences in inhibin B concentrations in relation to grading. The Kaplan-Meier analyses demonstrated no differences in survival rate in relation to inhibin A levels, while there was a stepwise impairment of 5-years survival with increased inhibin B level. In the group of patients with inhibin B levels higher than 20 pg/ml the survival rate was lower (p=0,00625, log-rank test).1. Higher inhibin A serum levels were found in patients with highly differentiated ovarian carcinoma compared to the group of patients with a poorly differentiated cancer, which may confirm the influence of inhibin A on cell proliferation processes. 2. A significant importance of inhibin B was demonstrated in the prediction of death within less than a five year period. The probability of survival in patients featuring high inhibin B levels was lower with statistical significance. This may indicate the need for further studies on how to block the inhibin B activation pathway in the ovarian carcinoma therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1968482088,"HIV-1 integrase (IN) is essential for the integration of viral DNA into the host genome and an attractive therapeutic target for developing antiretroviral inhibitors. LEDGINs are a class of allosteric inhibitors targeting LEDGF/p75 binding site of HIV-1 IN. Yet, the detailed binding mode and allosteric inhibition mechanism of LEDGINs to HIV-1 IN is only partially understood, which hinders the structure-based design of more potent anti-HIV agents. A molecular modeling study combining molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and binding free energy calculation were performed to investigate the interaction details of HIV-1 IN catalytic core domain (CCD) with two recently discovered LEDGINs BI-1001 and CX14442, as well as the LEDGF/p75 protein. Simulation results demonstrated the hydrophobic domain of BI-1001 and CX14442 engages one subunit of HIV-1 IN CCD dimer through hydrophobic interactions, and the hydrophilic group forms hydrogen bonds with HIV-1 IN CCD residues from other subunit. CX14442 has a larger tert-butyl group than the methyl of BI-1001, and forms better interactions with the highly hydrophobic binding pocket of HIV-1 IN CCD dimer interface, which can explain the stronger affinity of CX14442 than BI-1001. Analysis of the binding mode of LEDGF/p75 with HIV-1 IN CCD reveals that the LEDGF/p75 integrase binding domain residues Ile365, Asp366, Phe406 and Val408 have significant contributions to the binding of the LEDGF/p75 to HIV1-IN. Remarkably, we found that binding of BI-1001 and CX14442 to HIV-1 IN CCD induced the structural rearrangements of the 140 s loop and oration displacements of the side chains of the three conserved catalytic residues Asp64, Asp116, and Glu152 located at the active site. These results we obtained will be valuable not only for understanding the allosteric inhibition mechanism of LEDGINs but also for the rational design of allosteric inhibitors of HIV-1 IN targeting LEDGF/p75 binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2065219940,"Why do humans make errors on seemingly trivial perceptual decisions? It has been shown that such errors occur in part because the decision process (evidence accumulation) is initiated before selective attention has isolated the relevant sensory information from salient distractors. Nevertheless, it is typically assumed that subjects increase accuracy by prolonging the decision process rather than delaying decision onset. To date it has not been tested whether humans can strategically delay decision onset to increase response accuracy. To address this question we measured the time course of selective attention in a motion interference task using a novel variant of the response signal paradigm. Based on these measurements we estimated time-dependent drift rate and showed that subjects should in principle be able trade speed for accuracy very effectively by delaying decision onset. Using the time-dependent estimate of drift rate we show that subjects indeed delay decision onset in addition to raising response threshold when asked to stress accuracy over speed in a free reaction version of the same motion-interference task. These findings show that decision onset is a critical aspect of the decision process that can be adjusted to effectively improve decision accuracy."

Patients who had bimaxillary orthognathic surgery reviewed at post-operative 6 months, 12 months or 24 months were recruited to undergo neurosensory tests with subjective and 3 objective assessments. Possible risk factors of NSD including subjects' age and gender, surgical procedures and surgeons' experience were analyzed.238 patients with 476 sides were recruited. The incidences of subjective NSD after maxillary procedures were 16.2%, 13% and 9.8% at post-operative 6 months, 12 months and 24 months, respectively; the incidences of subjective NSD after mandibular procedures were 35.4%, 36.6% and 34.6% at post-operative 6 months, 12 months and 24 months, respectively. Increased age was found to be a significant risk factor of NSD after orthognathic surgery at short term (at 6 months and 12 months) but not at 24 months. SSO has a significantly higher risk of NSD when compared to VSSO. SSO in combination with anterior mandibular surgery has a higher risk of NSD when compared to VSSO in combination with anterior mandibular surgery or anterior mandibular surgery alone. Gender of patients and surgeons' experience were not found to be risk factors of NSD after orthognathic surgery.The incidence of NSD after maxillary and mandibular orthognathic procedures at post-operative 6 months, 12 months and 24 months was reported.

https://openalex.org/W1990050143,"The calicivirus minor capsid protein VP2 is expressed via termination/reinitiation. This process depends on an upstream sequence element denoted termination upstream ribosomal binding site (TURBS). We have shown for feline calicivirus and rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus that the TURBS contains three sequence motifs essential for reinitiation. Motif 1 is conserved among caliciviruses and is complementary to a sequence in the 18 S rRNA leading to the model that hybridization between motif 1 and 18 S rRNA tethers the post-termination ribosome to the mRNA. Motif 2 and motif 2* are proposed to establish a secondary structure positioning the ribosome relative to the start site of the terminal ORF. Here, we analyzed human norovirus (huNV) sequences for the presence and importance of these motifs. The three motifs were identified by sequence analyses in the region upstream of the VP2 start site, and we showed that these motifs are essential for reinitiation of huNV VP2 translation. More detailed analyses revealed that the site of reinitiation is not fixed to a single codon and does not need to be an AUG, even though this codon is clearly preferred. Interestingly, we were able to show that reinitiation can occur at AUG codons downstream of the canonical start/stop site in huNV and feline calicivirus but not in rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus. Although reinitiation at the original start site is independent of the Kozak context, downstream initiation exhibits requirements for start site sequence context known for linear scanning.

Translation of mRNAs represents one of the basic processes in living organisms and is a prominent site of gene regulation that occurs at the step of translational initiation. Eukaryotic mRNAs are generally monocistronic, and the translational start site is usually located close to the 5′ end. Initiation of translation is conducted with the help of a set of initiation factors, first accomplishing binding of the 40 S ribosomal subunit to the cap structure, then supporting scanning of the preinitiation complex along the RNA to identify the translational start site that is the first AUG in most cases. After positioning of the AUG in the P-site of the 40 S subunit of the ribosome, the large subunit is bound to the ribosomal complex and translation starts (for scanning model see Refs. 1.Hinnebusch A.G.

So far, the best studied case of translation reinitiation after translation of a long upstream ORF in higher eukaryotic cells was found in caliciviruses. The single strand positive sense RNA genome of caliciviruses is 7–8 kb long and contains two or three functional ORFs (33.Green K.Y. Ando T. Balayan M.S. Berke T. Clarke I.N. Estes M.K. Matson D.O.

ORF1 codes for the nonstructural proteins, which are translated as a polyprotein that is processed co- and post-translationally by a virus-encoded protease. A 3′-terminal, small ORF codes for the minor capsid protein VP2 with a size that varies among the caliciviruses from 8 to 20 kDa (34.Clarke I.N. Lambden P.R. Organization and expression of calicivirus genes.J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 181: S309-S316Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The major capsid protein VP1 is encoded by a separate ORF2 in members of the genera Vesivirus and Norovirus or is part of the ORF1-encoded polyprotein in viruses belonging to the genera Lagovirus, Nebovirus, and Sapovirus. The genomic RNA serves as a template for the synthesis of the nonstructural polyprotein. A 3′-coterminal subgenomic mRNA is used for translation of at least the overwhelming amount of the major capsid protein VP1 and the minor capsid protein VP2. Both the full-length and the subgenomic RNAs do not carry a 5′ cap but are covalently linked to a viral protein (VPg). VPg serves as a primer for genome replication (35.Rohayem J. Robel I. Jäger K.

Reinitiation of translation in caliciviruses depends on an upstream sequence named TURBS (termination upstream ribosomal binding site; 40–70 nt), which is thought to bind the post-termination ribosome and therefore to increase the chance of reinitiation. The TURBS region contains three essential motifs (Fig. 1). Motif 1 (UGGGA) is found to be conserved among caliciviruses and is located at similar positions in the mRNAs of the different caliciviruses, upstream of the 3′-terminal ORFs. This motif is complementary to the loop region of helix 26 of the 18 S rRNA. Hybridization of motif 1 to 18 S rRNA was demonstrated to be important for reinitiation (39.Luttermann C. Meyers G. The importance of inter- and intramolecular base pairing for translation reinitiation on a eukaryotic bicistronic mRNA.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). There is also evidence for an interaction of motif 1 with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) (26.Pöyry T.A. Kaminski A. Connell E.J. Fraser C.S. Jackson R.J. The mechanism of an exceptional case of reinitiation after translation of a long ORF reveals why such events do not generally occur in mammalian mRNA translation.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In contrast to motif 1, the sequence of motif 2 is not conserved, but this motif is located at similar positions in the mRNA, 12–23 nt upstream of the 3′ ORF start codon. A complementary sequence to motif 2, named motif 2*, is located directly upstream of motif 1. These two motifs were proposed to establish a secondary structure playing a role in positioning the ribosome relative to the start site of the 3′-terminal ORF (23.Luttermann C. Meyers G.

The basic mechanism of the reinitiation process is clearly conserved among caliciviruses, but the efficiency of reinitiation varies for the different caliciviruses between 5 and 20% of the VP1 translation rate. In this study, we describe analysis of the termination-reinitiation mechanism of VP2 translation for human Norovirus (huNV). In contrast to other caliciviral genera, the stop codon of the VP1 coding frame is located upstream of the VP2 start codon (see Fig. 1). Therefore, our analyses were focused on the start site used for the reinitiation event, and we compared the results with data generated for other caliciviruses and found differences in start site recognition but also common features for this interesting mechanism of translation.

Restriction and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Schwalbach, Germany) and Fermentas GmbH (Sankt Leon-Rot, Germany). The huNV coding regions for constructs pNVWT and pNPWT were generated by PCR from a full-length cDNA clone (Norovirus Hu/NLV/Dresden174/pUS-NorII/1997/GE, GenBankTM accession number AY741811) kindly provided by J.

The 4–5-fold volume of cell lysate was used for precipitation of the protein resulting from translation of the second frame compared with that for precipitation of the first frame. AU1 tag-dependent precipitation for the pNV56 constructs was done with an AU-1 antiserum from BIOZOL Diagnostic (Munich, Germany). Double precipitation was used to ensure quantitative recovery of the proteins as tested before. The precipitates were combined, and aliquots thereof were separated by 10–16% PAGE using a gel system published previously (45.Schägger H. von Jagow G. Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for the separation of proteins in the range from 1 to 100 kDa.Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10477) Google Scholar). The gels were analyzed with a Fujifilm BAS-1500 phosphorimager, and the intensities of the signals were determined with TINA 2.0 software (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). The molar ratio of VP1 and VP2 was calculated based on the number of labeled residues within the proteins and the measured radioactivity. For comparison of expression efficiencies of different constructs, the VP2 expression level of the wild type (WT) construct was defined as 100%. The amounts of VP2 expression of the other constructs were normalized to the values determined for VP1 as an internal standard. The corrected value for VP2 was then used for calculation of the expression efficiency, given as a percentage of the WT value. An analogous quantification was done for analysis of the polymerase and VP1 proteins of the constructs established for analysis of the second NV TURBS located in the polymerase coding region (construct pNPWT and mutants thereof).

Here we present evidence demonstrating protection against ovalbumin expressing B16 (B16-OVA) metastatic melanoma lung tumor formation by sublingual vaccination with the model tumor antigen OVA plus synthetic glycolipid alpha-galactosylceramide (aGalCer) for harnessing the adjuvant potential of natural killer T (NKT) cells, which effectively bridge innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. The protective efficacy of immunization with OVA plus aGalCer was antigen-specific as immunized mice challenged with parental B16 tumors lacking OVA expression were not protected. Multiple sublingual immunizations in the presence, but not in the absence of aGalCer, resulted in repeated activation of NKT cells in the draining lymph nodes, spleens, and lungs of immunized animals concurrent with progressively increasing OVA-specific CD8+ T cell responses as well as serum IgG and vaginal IgA levels. Furthermore, sublingual administration of the antigen only in the presence of the aGalCer adjuvant effectively boosted the OVA-specific immune responses. These results support potential clinical utility of sublingual route of vaccination with aGalCer-for prevention of pulmonary metastases."
https://openalex.org/W2023616977,"Background 5′-deoxy-5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA) is an endogenous compound produced through the metabolism of polyamines. The therapeutic potential of MTA has been assayed mainly in liver diseases and, more recently, in animal models of multiple sclerosis. The aim of this study was to determine the neuroprotective effect of this molecule in vitro and to assess whether MTA can cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) in order to also analyze its potential neuroprotective efficacy in vivo. Methods Neuroprotection was assessed in vitro using models of excitotoxicity in primary neurons, mixed astrocyte-neuron and primary oligodendrocyte cultures. The capacity of MTA to cross the BBB was measured in an artificial membrane assay and using an in vitro cell model. Finally, in vivo tests were performed in models of hypoxic brain damage, Parkinson's disease and epilepsy. Results MTA displays a wide array of neuroprotective activities against different insults in vitro. While the data from the two complementary approaches adopted indicate that MTA is likely to cross the BBB, the in vivo data showed that MTA may provide therapeutic benefits in specific circumstances. Whereas MTA reduced the neuronal cell death in pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus and the size of the lesion in global but not focal ischemic brain damage, it was ineffective in preserving dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-pyridine (MPTP)-mice model. However, in this model of Parkinson's disease the combined administration of MTA and an A2A adenosine receptor antagonist did produce significant neuroprotection in this brain region. Conclusion MTA may potentially offer therapeutic neuroprotection."

The duration of the sporogonic cycle within the mosquitoes ranges from 10 to 21 days depending on the parasite species and temperature. During blood feeding salivary gland proteins are injected into the vertebrate host, along with malaria sporozoites in the case of an infected mosquito. To identify salivary gland proteins depleted after blood feeding of female Anopheles campestris-like, a potential malaria vector of Plasmodium vivax in Thailand, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and nano-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques were used. Results showed that 19 major proteins were significantly depleted in three to four day-old mosquitoes fed on a first blood meal. For the mosquitoes fed the second blood meal on day 14 after the first blood meal, 14 major proteins were significantly decreased in amount. The significantly depleted proteins in both groups included apyrase, 5′-nucleotidase/apyrase, D7, D7-related 1, short form D7r1, gSG6, anti-platelet protein, serine/threonine-protein kinase rio3, putative sil1, cyclophilin A, hypothetical protein Phum_PHUM512530, AGAP007618-PA, and two non-significant hit proteins. To our knowledge, this study presents for the first time the salivary gland proteins that are involved in the second blood feeding on the day corresponding to the transmission period of the sporozoites to new mammalian hosts. This information serves as a basis for future work concerning the possible role of these proteins in the parasite transmission and the physiological processes that occur during the blood feeding."
https://openalex.org/W2083502523,"Cochlear implants (CIs) can partially restore functional hearing in deaf individuals. However, multiple factors affect CI listener's speech perception, resulting in large performance differences. Non-speech based tests, such as spectral ripple discrimination, measure acoustic processing capabilities that are highly correlated with speech perception. Currently spectral ripple discrimination is measured using standard psychoacoustic methods, which require attentive listening and active response that can be difficult or even impossible in special patient populations. Here, a completely objective cortical evoked potential based method is developed and validated to assess spectral ripple discrimination in CI listeners. In 19 CI listeners, using an oddball paradigm, cortical evoked potential responses to standard and inverted spectrally rippled stimuli were measured. In the same subjects, psychoacoustic spectral ripple discrimination thresholds were also measured. A neural discrimination threshold was determined by systematically increasing the number of ripples per octave and determining the point at which there was no longer a significant difference between the evoked potential response to the standard and inverted stimuli. A correlation was found between the neural and the psychoacoustic discrimination thresholds (R2 = 0.60, p<0.01). This method can objectively assess CI spectral resolution performance, providing a potential tool for the evaluation and follow-up of CI listeners who have difficulty performing psychoacoustic tests, such as pediatric or new users."

It is unknown how PVL affects metabolic patterns of tumor free hepatic tissues. The aim of this preliminary study is to evaluate the effect of PVL on glucose metabolism, using PET/MRI imaging in healthy rat liver.Male Wistar rats (n=30) underwent PVL. 2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) PET/MRI imaging (nanoScan PET/MRI) and morphological/histological examination were performed before (Day 0) and 1, 2, 3, and 7 days after PVL. Dynamic PET data were collected and the standardized uptake values (SUV) for ligated and non-ligated liver lobes were calculated in relation to cardiac left ventricle (SUVVOI/SUVCLV) and mean liver SUV (SUVVOI/SUVLiver).PVL induced atrophy of ligated lobes, while non-ligated liver tissue showed compensatory hypertrophy. Dynamic PET scan revealed altered FDG kinetics in both ligated and non-ligated liver lobes. SUVVOI/SUVCLV significantly increased in both groups of lobes, with a maximal value at the 2nd postoperative day and returned near to the baseline 7 days after the ligation. After PVL, ligated liver lobes showed significantly higher tracer uptake compared to the non-ligated lobes (significantly higher SUVVOI/SUVLiver values were observed at postoperative day 1, 2 and 3). The homogenous tracer biodistribution observed before PVL reappeared by 7th postoperative day.The observed alterations in FDG uptake dynamics should be taken into account during the assessment of PET data until the PVL induced atrophic and regenerative processes are completed."
https://openalex.org/W1996661778,"Background In preparation for full Affordable Care Act implementation, California has instituted two healthcare initiatives that provide comprehensive coverage for previously uninsured or underinsured individuals. For many people living with HIV, this has required transition either from the HIV-specific coverage of the Ryan White program to the more comprehensive coverage provided by the county-run Low-Income Health Programs or from Medicaid fee-for-service to Medicaid managed care. Patient advocates have expressed concern that these transitions may present implementation challenges that will need to be addressed if ambitious HIV prevention and treatment goals are to be achieved. Methods 30 semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted between October, 2012, and February, 2013, with policymakers and providers in 10 urban, suburban, and rural California counties. Interview topics included: continuity of patient care, capacity to handle payer source transitions, and preparations for healthcare reform implementation. Study team members reviewed interview transcripts to produce emergent themes, develop a codebook, build inter-rater reliability, and conduct analyses. Results Respondents supported the goals of the ACA, but reported clinic and policy-level challenges to maintaining patient continuity of care during the payer source transitions. They also identified strategies for addressing these challenges. Areas of focus included: gaps in communication to reach patients and develop partnerships between providers and policymakers, perceived inadequacy in new provider networks for delivering quality HIV care, the potential for clinics to become financially insolvent due to lower reimbursement rates, and increased administrative burdens for clinic staff and patients. Conclusions California's new healthcare initiatives represent ambitious attempts to expand and improve health coverage for low-income individuals. The state's challenges in maintaining quality care and treatment for people living with HIV experiencing these transitions demonstrate the importance of setting effective policies in anticipation of full ACA implementation in 2014."
https://openalex.org/W2085220982,"One of the important challenges in the field of evolutionary robotics is the development of systems that can adapt to a changing environment. However, the ability to adapt to unknown and fluctuating environments is not straightforward. Here, we explore the adaptive potential of simulated swarm robots that contain a genomic encoding of a bio-inspired gene regulatory network (GRN). An artificial genome is combined with a flexible agent-based system, representing the activated part of the regulatory network that transduces environmental cues into phenotypic behaviour. Using an artificial life simulation framework that mimics a dynamically changing environment, we show that separating the static from the conditionally active part of the network contributes to a better adaptive behaviour. Furthermore, in contrast with most hitherto developed ANN-based systems that need to re-optimize their complete controller network from scratch each time they are subjected to novel conditions, our system uses its genome to store GRNs whose performance was optimized under a particular environmental condition for a sufficiently long time. When subjected to a new environment, the previous condition-specific GRN might become inactivated, but remains present. This ability to store ‘good behaviour’ and to disconnect it from the novel rewiring that is essential under a new condition allows faster re-adaptation if any of the previously observed environmental conditions is reencountered. As we show here, applying these evolutionary-based principles leads to accelerated and improved adaptive evolution in a non-stable environment."

Cells mitotic index were determined in squashed root cells from Allium cepa bulbs exposed to zidovudine or nevirapine for 48 hr. The concentration of zidovudine and nevirapine inhibiting 50% root growth after 96 hr exposure was 65.0 µM and 92.5 µM respectively. Root length of all antiretroviral-exposed roots after 96 hr exposure was significantly shorter than the unexposed roots while additional root growth during a subsequent 48 hr recovery period in the absence of drug was not significantly different. By ANOVA, there was a significant association between percentage of cells in mitosis and zidovudine dose (p=0.004), but not nevirapine dose (p=0.68). Chromosomal aberrations such as sticky chromosomes, chromatin bridges, multipolar mitoses and binucleated cells were observed in root cells exposed to zidovudine and nevirapine for 48 hr. The most notable chromosomal aberration was drug-related increases in sticky chromosomes. Overall, the study showed inhibition in root length growth, changes in the mitotic index, and the induction of chromosomal aberrations in Allium bulbs treated for 96 hr or 48 hr with zidovudine and nevirapine. The study reveals generalized cytogenotoxic damage induced by exposure to zidovudine and nevirapine, and further show that the two compounds differ in their effects on mitosis and the types of chromosomal aberrations induced."

https://openalex.org/W2066282544,"Vessel proliferation underlies a number of serious pathological conditions. Infantile Hemangioma (IH) is a low-aggressive vascular tumor, interesting as an in vivo model of spontaneous tumor regression. Identifying mechanisms underlying IH spontaneous regression may then help to elucidate vessel-growth control, strongly deregulated in other serious conditions such as sarcoma, melanoma, diabetic retinopathy. The present study was aimed at identifying early regression indicators within hematological parameters. Thirty-four blood samples were collected from IH diagnosed babies (20-months median age), spontaneously regressing with age. Nineteen serum standard blood-tests were carried out using diagnostic reagents; in addition, serum-expression of 27 cytokine/chemokines was measured. Samples were divided in three age-groups, namely ≤12, 13 to 24 and >24 months-age, respectively. Red-cells count, Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, Neutrophils, Lymphocytes, MCP-1 and MIP-1beta were significantly different in the three age-groups, according to one-way ANOVA analysis. The same parameters showed a significant Pearson-correlation with age, supporting the direct link of age with IH-regression. ROC analysis showed that red-cells count, Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, MCP-1 and MIP-1beta levels significantly discriminate IH in the proliferating-phase from IH in the regressing-phase. Such data indicate for the first time that standard hematological tests and cytokine serum-expression values may effectively discriminate proliferating- from regressing-IH, unrevealing early regression signs, and demonstrate that standard blood-tests may have novel unsuspected diagnostic/prognostic relevance in altered vessel-growth conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2081439568,"In biological systems energy serves as the ultimate commodity, often determining species distributions, abundances, and interactions including the potential impact of invasive species on native communities. The Asian clam Potamocorbula amurensis invaded the San Francisco Estuary (SFE) in 1986 and is implicated in the decline of native fish species through resource competition. Using a combined laboratory/field study we examined how energy expenditure in this clam is influenced by salinity, temperature and food availability. Measures of metabolism were made at whole organism (metabolic rate) and biochemical (pyruvate kinase (PK) and citrate synthase (CS) enzyme activities) levels. We found in the field, over the course of a year, the ratio of PK to CS was typically 1.0 suggesting that aerobic and fermentative metabolism were roughly equivalent, except for particular periods characterized by low salinity, higher temperatures, and intermediate food availabilities. In a 30-day laboratory acclimation experiment, however, neither metabolic rate nor PK:CS ratio was consistently influenced by the same variables, though the potential for fermentative pathways did predominate. We conclude that in field collected animals, the addition of biochemical measures of energetic state provide little additional information to the previously measured whole organism metabolic rate. In addition, much of the variation in the laboratory remained unexplained and additional variables, including reproductive stage or body condition may influence laboratory-based results. Further study of adult clams must consider the role of organismal condition, especially reproductive state, in comparisons of laboratory experiments and field observations."
https://openalex.org/W2044917172,"Background Pharyngeal bacteria are exposed to different sugar conditions depending on the diet of the child. We hypothesized that dietary factors such as daily intake of carbohydrates could be associated with pneumococcal carriage and the occurrence of otitis media in children. Methods Our study design was a cross-sectional study among 1006 children attending child day care centers. Parents filled in a food frequency questionnaire. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected from each child. The primary outcome was the occurrence of pneumococcal carriage and the secondary outcome the number of acute otitis media episodes during life. Principal component analysis was used to group dietary intake into nine factors. The models were adjusted for age, gender of the child and educational level of the mother. Results The dietary factor which included high consumption of sweet pastries and jam was associated with an increased risk of pneumococcal carriage (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.36, P-value 0.04). The factor including frequent consumption of fruit and berries was associated with a decreased risk of acute otitis (regression coefficient −0.51, 95% CI −0.98 to −0.03, P = 0.04). A high intake of consumption of sweets and snacks (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.80, P = 0.03) was associated with an increased risk of caries. Conclusions Diet was associated with a risk of pneumococcal carriage and the occurrence of otitis media. Diet may thus be a modifiable risk factor for the occurrence of acute otitis media."

This strain has a high superovulation response, allows visual detection of chimeric coat color contribution of C57BL/6 ES-cells and provides a simplified breeding format that generates black G1 offspring of pure inbred C57BL/6 background in one step, providing the ideal host for genetically manipulated C57BL/6 ES cells."
https://openalex.org/W2059587792,"Most protein purification procedures include an affinity tag fused to either the N or C-terminal end of the protein of interest as well as a procedure for tag removal. Tag removal is not straightforward and especially tag removal from the C-terminal end is a challenge due to the characteristics of enzymes available for this purpose. In the present study, we demonstrate the utility of the divalent uranyl ion in a new procedure for protein purification and tag removal. By employment of a GFP (green florescence protein) recombinant protein we show that uranyl binding to a phosphorylated C-terminal tag enables target protein purification from an E. coli extract by immobilized uranyl affinity chromatography. Subsequently, the tag can be efficiently removed by UV-irradiation assisted uranyl photocleavage. We therefore suggest that the divalent uranyl ion (UO22+) may provide a dual function in protein purification and subsequent C-terminal tag removal procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2016816698,"To qualitatively analyze and evaluate a bi-directional promoter transcriptional function in both transient and transgenic systems, several different plasmids were constructed and recombinant MDV type 1 strain GX0101 was developed to co-express a Neuraminidase (NA) gene from Avian Influenza Virus H9N2 strain and a Fusion (F) gene from the Newcastle disease virus (NDV). The two foreign genes, NDV-F gene and AIV-NA gene, were inserted in the plasmid driven in each direction by the bi-directional promoter. To test whether the expression of pp38/pp24 heterodimers are the required activators for the expression of the foreign genes, the recombinant plasmid pPpp38-NA/1.8kb-F containing expression cassette for the two foreign genes was co-transfected with a pp38/pp24 expression plasmid, pBud-pp38-pp24, in chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells. Alternatively, plasmid pPpp38-NA/1.8kb-F was transfected in GX0101-infected CEFs where the viral endogenous pp38/pp24 were expressed via virus infection. The expression of both foreign genes was activated by pp38/pp24 dimers either via virus infection, or co-expression. The CEFs transfected with pPpp38-NA/1.8kb-F alone had no expression. We chose to insert the expression cassette of Ppp38-NA/1.8kb-F in the non-essential region of GX0101ΔMeq US2 gene, and formed a new rMDV named MZC13NA/F through homologous recombination. Indirect fluorescence antibody (IFA) test, ELISA and Western blot analyses indicated that F and NA genes were expressed simultaneously under control of the bi-directional promoter, but in opposite directions. The data also indicated the activity of the promoter in the 1.8-kb mRNA transcript direction was higher than that in the direction for the pp38 gene. The expression of pp38/pp24 dimers either via co-tranfection of the pBud-pp38-pp24 plasmid, or by GX0101 virus infection were critical to activate the bi-directional promoter for expression of two foreign genes in both directions. Therefore, the confirmed function of the bi-directional promoter provides better feasibilities to insert multiple foreign genes in MDV genome based vectors."
https://openalex.org/W2033425821,"The mid-latitudes of East Asia are characterized by the interaction between the Asian summer monsoon and the westerly winds. Understanding long-term climate change in the marginal regions of the Asian monsoon is critical for understanding the millennial-scale interactions between the Asian monsoon and the westerly winds. Abrupt climate events are always associated with changes in large-scale circulation patterns; therefore, investigations into abrupt climate changes provide clues for responses of circulation patterns to extreme climate events. In this paper, we examined the time scale and mid-Holocene climatic background of an abrupt dry mid-Holocene event in the Shiyang River drainage basin in the northwest margin of the Asian monsoon. Mid-Holocene lacustrine records were collected from the middle reaches and the terminal lake of the basin. Using radiocarbon and OSL ages, a centennial-scale drought event, which is characterized by a sand layer in lacustrine sediments both from the middle and lower reaches of the basin, was absolutely dated between 8.0–7.0 cal kyr BP. Grain size data suggest an abrupt decline in lake level and a dry environment in the middle reaches of the basin during the dry interval. Previous studies have shown mid-Holocene drought events in other places of monsoon marginal zones; however, their chronologies are not strong enough to study the mechanism. According to the absolutely dated records, we proposed a new hypothesis that the mid-Holocene dry interval can be related to the weakening Asian summer monsoon and the relatively arid environment in arid Central Asia. Furthermore, abrupt dry climatic events are directly linked to the basin-wide effective moisture change in semi-arid and arid regions. Effective moisture is affected by basin-wide precipitation, evapotranspiration, lake surface evaporation and other geographical settings. As a result, the time scales of the dry interval could vary according to locations due to different geographical features."
https://openalex.org/W2334670730,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms of interleukin-28B (IL28B) rs8099917 are reported to be associated with virologic clearance in interferon-and ribavirin -based treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients. We examined virologic response in accordance with IL28B polymorphisms in our living donor liver transplantation series under a preemptive interferon and RBV treatment approach. Adequate DNA samples from both the recipient and donor for the study of single nucleotide polymorphisms of IL28B were available from 96 cases and were the subjects of the present study. Various clinical factors related with virologic response including early virologic response (EVR) and sustained virologic response (SVR) were examined. Totally 51% presented with EVR and 44% achieved SVR. Presence of the major allele (TT) in either the recipient or the donor corresponded to SVR of 53% and 48%. Presence of the minor allele (TG or GG) corresponded to SVR of 26% and 32%. Multivariate analysis revealed that genotype of HCV or EVR, but not IL28B polymorphisms in either the recipient or donor, was an independent factor for achieving SVR. When virologic response to treatment was incorporated into analysis, the impact of IL28B polymorphism on virological clearance remained relative to other factors and was not significantly independent."
https://openalex.org/W2020060678,"Circulating monocytes in the bloodstream typically migrate to other tissues and differentiate into tissue resident macrophages, the process being determined by the constituents of the microenvironments encountered. These may include microbes and their products. In this study, we investigated whether Moraxella catarrhalis Ubiquitous Surface Protein A1 (UspA1), known to bind to a widely expressed human cell surface receptor CEACAM1, influences monocyte differentiation as receptor engagement has been shown to have profound effects on monocytes. We used the recombinant molecules corresponding to the regions of UspA1 which either bind (rD-7; UspA1527–665) or do not bind (r6–8; UspA1659–863) to CEACAM1 and investigated their effects on CD206, CD80 and CD86 expression on freshly isolated human CD14+ monocytes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Exposure to rD-7, but not r6–8, biased monocyte differentiation towards a CD14+CD206+ phenotype, with reduced CD80 expression. Monocytes treated with rD-7 also secreted high levels of IL-1ra and chemokine IL-8 but not IL-10 or IL-12p70. The effects of rD-7 were independent of any residual endotoxin. Unexpectedly, these effects of rD-7 were also independent of its ability to bind to CEACAM1, as monocyte pre-treatment with the anti-CEACAM antibody A0115 known to inhibit rD-7 binding to the receptor, did not affect rD-7-driven differentiation. Further, another control protein rD-7/D (a mutant form of rD-7, known not to bind to CEACAMs), also behaved as the parent molecule. Our data suggest that specific regions of M. catarrhalis adhesin UspA1 may modulate inflammation during infection through a yet unknown receptor on monocytes."
