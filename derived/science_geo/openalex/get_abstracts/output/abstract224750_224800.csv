Enzyme systems which catalyze the synthesis of GSH from glutamic acid, cysteine, and glycine have been found in the livers of pigeons and of various mammals. The presence of the GSH-synthesizing system has also been demonstrated in extracts of E. coli. The formation of GSH in pigeon liver proceeds in at least two consecutive steps and involves the formation of GlutCyst as an intermediate. The formation of GlutCyst as well as the subsequent condensation of the dipeptide with glycine requires ATP. Of the two steps which are concerned with the total synthesis of GSH, only that which results in the formation of the tripeptide from GlutCyst has been extensively studied. The name glutathione synthetase is proposed for the enzyme which catalyzes the condensation of GlutCyst and glycine to form GSH. The synthesis of GSH can be determined by means of the glyoxalase assay, or more conveniently by measuring the incorporation of radio-active glycine or glutamic acid into the tripeptide. GSH formation is strongly inhibited by ADP, which is not only a product of the synthetic reaction but is liberated by the action of ATP-ase present in crude liver extracts. Therefore, for optimal rates of GSH synthesis ATP is continuously regenerated by adding 3-PGA."
