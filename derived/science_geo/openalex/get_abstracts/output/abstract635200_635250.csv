https://openalex.org/W2953014442,"Parkinson's disease, the most common age-related movement disorder, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with unclear etiology. Key neuropathological hallmarks are Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites: neuronal inclusions immunopositive for the protein α-synuclein. In-depth ultrastructural analysis of Lewy pathology is crucial to understanding pathogenesis of this disease. Using correlative light and electron microscopy and tomography on postmortem human brain tissue from Parkinson's disease brain donors, we identified α-synuclein immunopositive Lewy pathology and show a crowded environment of membranes therein, including vesicular structures and dysmorphic organelles. Filaments interspersed between the membranes and organelles were identifiable in many but not all α-synuclein inclusions. Crowding of organellar components was confirmed by stimulated emission depletion (STED)-based super-resolution microscopy, and high lipid content within α-synuclein immunopositive inclusions was corroborated by confocal imaging, Fourier-transform coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering infrared imaging and lipidomics. Applying such correlative high-resolution imaging and biophysical approaches, we discovered an aggregated protein-lipid compartmentalization not previously described in the Parkinsons' disease brain."

Metagenomic sequencing could identify LRI pathogens much faster than culture, but methods are needed to remove the large amount of human DNA present in these samples for this approach to be feasible. We developed a metagenomics method for bacterial LRI diagnosis that features efficient saponin-based host DNA depletion and nanopore sequencing. Our pilot method was tested on 40 samples, then optimized and tested on a further 41 samples. Our optimized method (6 h from sample to result) was 96.6% sensitive and 41.7% specific for pathogen detection compared with culture and we could accurately detect antibiotic resistance genes. After confirmatory quantitative PCR and pathobiont-specific gene analyses, specificity and sensitivity increased to 100%. Nanopore metagenomics can rapidly and accurately characterize bacterial LRIs and might contribute to a reduction in broad-spectrum antibiotic use."

https://openalex.org/W2949897197,"Pericytes are positioned between brain capillary endothelial cells, astrocytes and neurons. They degenerate in multiple neurological disorders. However, their role in the pathogenesis of these disorders remains debatable. Here we generate an inducible pericyte-specific Cre line and cross pericyte-specific Cre mice with iDTR mice carrying Cre-dependent human diphtheria toxin receptor. After pericyte ablation with diphtheria toxin, mice showed acute blood-brain barrier breakdown, severe loss of blood flow, and a rapid neuron loss that was associated with loss of pericyte-derived pleiotrophin (PTN), a neurotrophic growth factor. Intracerebroventricular PTN infusions prevented neuron loss in pericyte-ablated mice despite persistent circulatory changes. Silencing of pericyte-derived Ptn rendered neurons vulnerable to ischemic and excitotoxic injury. Our data demonstrate a rapid neurodegeneration cascade that links pericyte loss to acute circulatory collapse and loss of PTN neurotrophic support. These findings may have implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of neurological disorders that are associated with pericyte loss and/or neurovascular dysfunction."

Here we show that germline knockout of Trem2 or the TREM2R47H variant reduces microgliosis around amyloid-β plaques and facilitates the seeding and spreading of neuritic plaque tau aggregates. These findings demonstrate a key role for TREM2 and microglia in limiting the development of peri-plaque tau pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2951246796,"T cells clear virus from the CNS and dynamically regulate brain functions, including spatial learning, through cytokine signaling. Here we determined whether hippocampal T cells that persist after recovery from infection with West Nile virus (WNV) or Zika virus (ZIKV) impact hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. Using newly established models of viral encephalitis recovery in adult animals, we show that in mice that have recovered from WNV or ZIKV infection, T cell-derived interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signaling in microglia underlies spatial-learning defects via virus-target-specific mechanisms. Following recovery from WNV infection, mice showed presynaptic termini elimination with lack of repair, while for ZIKV, mice showed extensive neuronal apoptosis with loss of postsynaptic termini. Accordingly, animals deficient in CD8+ T cells or IFN-γ signaling in microglia demonstrated protection against synapse elimination following WNV infection and decreased neuronal apoptosis with synapse recovery following ZIKV infection. Thus, T cell signaling to microglia drives post-infectious cognitive sequelae that are associated with emerging neurotropic flaviviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2951581350,"Inhibitory extracellular matrices form around mature neurons as perineuronal nets containing chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans that limit axonal sprouting after CNS injury. The enzyme chondroitinase (Chase) degrades inhibitory chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and improves axonal sprouting and functional recovery after spinal cord injury in rodents. We evaluated the effects of Chase in rhesus monkeys that had undergone C7 spinal cord hemisection. Four weeks after hemisection, we administered multiple intraparenchymal Chase injections below the lesion, targeting spinal cord circuits that control hand function. Hand function improved significantly in Chase-treated monkeys relative to vehicle-injected controls. Moreover, Chase significantly increased corticospinal axon growth and the number of synapses formed by corticospinal terminals in gray matter caudal to the lesion. No detrimental effects were detected. This approach appears to merit clinical translation in spinal cord injury. Chondroitinase injections into monkey spinal cords 4 weeks after hemisection injury increased corticospinal axon growth and corticospinal synapse formation and improved functional outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2956085105,"Three mitochondrial metabolic pathways are required for efficient energy production in eukaryotic cells: the electron transfer chain (ETC), fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO), and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The ETC is organized into inner mitochondrial membrane supercomplexes that promote substrate channeling and catalytic efficiency. Although previous studies have suggested functional interaction between FAO and the ETC, their physical interaction has never been demonstrated. In this study, using blue native gel and two-dimensional electrophoreses, nano-LC-MS/MS, immunogold EM, and stimulated emission depletion microscopy, we show that FAO enzymes physically interact with ETC supercomplexes at two points. We found that the FAO trifunctional protein (TFP) interacts with the NADH-binding domain of complex I of the ETC, whereas the electron transfer enzyme flavoprotein dehydrogenase interacts with ETC complex III. Moreover, the FAO enzyme very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase physically interacted with TFP, thereby creating a multifunctional energy protein complex. These findings provide a first view of an integrated molecular architecture for the major energy-generating pathways in mitochondria that ensures the safe transfer of unstable reducing equivalents from FAO to the ETC. They also offer insight into clinical ramifications for individuals with genetic defects in these pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2953985982,"The hippocampus is able to rapidly learn incoming information, even if that information is only observed once. Furthermore, this information can be replayed in a compressed format in either forward or reverse modes during sharp wave–ripples (SPW–Rs). We leveraged state-of-the-art techniques in training recurrent spiking networks to demonstrate how primarily interneuron networks can achieve the following: (1) generate internal theta sequences to bind externally elicited spikes in the presence of inhibition from the medial septum; (2) compress learned spike sequences in the form of a SPW–R when septal inhibition is removed; (3) generate and refine high-frequency assemblies during SPW–R-mediated compression; and (4) regulate the inter-SPW interval timing between SPW–Rs in ripple clusters. From the fast timescale of neurons to the slow timescale of behaviors, interneuron networks serve as the scaffolding for one-shot learning by replaying, reversing, refining, and regulating spike sequences. How does the hippocampus learn with only a single presentation of a stimulus? Nicola and Clopath show how interneuron networks can dilate pre-existing spike sequences during sharp waves into theta sequences for one-shot learning."
https://openalex.org/W2954826469,"Climate warming has the potential to disrupt plant-pollinator interactions or to increase competition of co-flowering plants for pollinators, due to species-specific phenological responses to temperature. However, studies focusing on the effect of temperature on solitary bee emergence and the flowering onset of their food plants under natural conditions are still rare. We studied the effect of temperature on the phenology of the two spring bees Osmia cornuta and Osmia bicornis, by placing bee cocoons on eleven grasslands differing in mean site temperature. On seven grasslands, we additionally studied the effect of temperature on the phenology of the red-list plant Pulsatilla vulgaris, which was the first flowering plant, and of co-flowering plants with later flowering. With a warming of 0.1°C, the abundance-weighted mean emergence of O. cornuta males advanced by 0.4 days. Females of both species did not shift their emergence. Warmer temperatures advanced the abundance-weighted mean flowering of P. vulgaris by 1.3 days per 0.1°C increase, but did not shift flowering onset of co-flowering plants. Competition for pollinators between P. vulgaris and co-flowering plants does not increase within the studied temperature range. We demonstrate that temperature advances plant flowering more strongly than bee emergence suggesting an increased risk of pollinator limitation for the first flowers of P. vulgaris."
https://openalex.org/W2950142310,"The diversity of antibody variable regions makes cDNA sequencing challenging, and conventional monoclonal antibody cDNA amplification requires the use of degenerate primers. Here, we describe a simplified workflow for amplification of IgG antibody variable regions from hybridoma RNA by a specialized RT-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing. We perform three separate reactions for each hybridoma: one each for kappa, lambda, and heavy chain transcripts. We prime reverse transcription with a primer specific to the respective constant region and use a template-switch oligonucleotide, which creates a custom sequence at the 5' end of the antibody cDNA. This template-switching circumvents the issue of low sequence homology and the need for degenerate primers. Instead, subsequent PCR amplification of the antibody cDNA molecules requires only two primers: one primer specific for the template-switch oligonucleotide sequence and a nested primer to the respective constant region. We successfully sequenced the variable regions of five mouse monoclonal IgG antibodies using this method, which enabled us to design chimeric mouse/human antibody expression plasmids for recombinant antibody production in mammalian cell culture expression systems. All five recombinant antibodies bind their respective antigens with high affinity, confirming that the amino acid sequences determined by our method are correct and demonstrating the high success rate of our method. Furthermore, we also designed RT-PCR primers and amplified the variable regions from RNA of cells transfected with chimeric mouse/human antibody expression plasmids, showing that our approach is also applicable to IgG antibodies of human origin. Our monoclonal antibody sequencing method is highly accurate, user-friendly, and very cost-effective."
https://openalex.org/W2955466237,"Sediment flushing can tackle reservoirs siltation and improve sediment flux through dammed rivers. However, the increase of the sediment loading below the dam can trigger a suite of undesired ecological effects in the downstream river reaches. To limit these drawbacks, sediment flushing can be controlled, by jointly regulating the sediment concentration of the evacuated water and the streamflow in the downstream channel. In this paper, we report on ten controlled sediment flushing operations (CSFOs), carried out between 2006 and 2012 in the central Italian Alps, at four hydropower reservoirs. These CSFOs displayed specific common traits: (i) Limits were set by the local environmental authorities concerning the allowable suspended sediment concentration. (ii) Reservoirs were fully drawn-down, earth-moving equipment was used to dislodge sediment, and the downstream water discharge was increased, compared to baseflow, by operating upstream intakes. (iii) Abiotic and biotic measurements in selected downstream reaches (before, during, and after the CSFOs) represented an integral part of the operations. In contrast, significant differences characterize the hydropower facilities (elevation and storage of reservoirs, in particular) as well as the basic CSFOs parameters (i.e., season, duration, mass and grain-size of the evacuated sediment, suspended sediment concentration). The macroinvertebrate assemblages resulted noticeably impacted by the CSFOs. In the short term, a significant density drop was observed, slightly influenced by the extent of the perturbation. In contrast, the latter appeared to control the assemblages contraction in terms of richness, according to the different sensitivity to sediment stress of the different taxa. The time employed to recover pre-CSFO standard ranged from few months to just under one year, and the related patterns would seem mostly correlated to the flushing season and to further site specificities. The density of trout populations was impacted as well, thus suggesting the adoption of mitigating strategies as removal by electrofishing before, and repopulation after the CSFO."
https://openalex.org/W2954627588,"Destructive maceration, a wide host range, and longevity in non-plant substrates has established Dickeya dianthicola (blackleg of potato) as a significant threat to potato industries worldwide. To protect these businesses, a specific and sensitive point-of-care D. dianthicola detection tool is necessary. We have developed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for specific, sensitive, and rapid detection of D. dianthicola, which can be streamlined for point-of-care use. The developed LAMP assay targets a unique gene, alcohol dehydrogenase, of D. dianthicola. Assay specificity was assessed using strains present in inclusivity (16 D. dianthicola strains) and exclusivity panels (56 closely related, potato pathogenic, and other bacterial strains). Amplification with strains of inclusivity panel occurred, and cross-reactivity with non-target DNA was not observed. The limit of detection (LOD) was 10 CFU/ml when dilutions were made before isolating the genomic DNA; however, LOD was determined as 1 pg using 10-fold serially diluted D. dianthicola genomic DNA. Similar LOD of 1 pg was observed when serially diluted target genomic DNA was mixed with host genomic DNA. LOD (1 pg) was also calculated with 10-fold serially diluted synthetic DNA fragments containing primer target sites. Naturally and artificially inoculated plant samples were used for field adaptability tests with the field-deployable Optigene Plant Material Lysis Kit and a heat block (65°C); the results were obtained within 20 minutes. Despite the lack of method precision, no false positives or false negatives were observed. Therefore, with prepared reactions and a steady heat source, this assay can be used for rapid point-of-care detection, which is imperative for quarantine, eradication, disease management, and border protection."
https://openalex.org/W2954288046,"Degradation of polysaccharides is central to numerous biological and industrial processes. Starch-active polysaccharide monooxygenases (AA13 PMOs) oxidatively degrade starch and can potentially be used with industrial amylases to convert starch into a fermentable carbohydrate. The oxidative activities of the starch-active PMOs from the fungi Neurospora crassa and Myceliophthora thermophila, NcAA13 and MtAA13, respectively, on three different starch substrates are reported here. Using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography coupled with pulsed amperometry detection, we observed that both enzymes have significantly higher oxidative activity on amylose than on amylopectin and cornstarch. Analysis of the product distribution revealed that NcAA13 and MtAA13 more frequently oxidize glycosidic linkages separated by multiples of a helical turn consisting of six glucose units on the same amylose helix. Docking studies identified important residues that are involved in amylose binding and suggest that the shallow groove that spans the active-site surface of AA13 PMOs favors the binding of helical amylose substrates over nonhelical substrates. Truncations of NcAA13 that removed its native carbohydrate-binding module resulted in diminished binding to amylose, but truncated NcAA13 still favored amylose oxidation over other starch substrates. These findings establish that AA13 PMOs preferentially bind and oxidize the helical starch substrate amylose. Moreover, the product distributions of these two enzymes suggest a unique interaction with starch substrates.

https://openalex.org/W2949777383,"A thorough understanding of the heritability, genetic correlations and additive and non-additive variance components of tree growth and wood properties is a requisite for effective tree breeding. This knowledge is essential to maximize genetic gain, that is, the amount of increase in trait performance achieved annually through directional selection. Understanding the genetic attributes of traits targeted by breeding is also important to sustain decade-long genetic progress, that is, the progress made by increasing the average genetic value of the offspring as compared to that of the parental generation. In this study, we report quantitative genetic parameters for fifteen growth, wood chemical and physical traits for the world-famous Eucalyptus urograndis hybrid (E. grandis × E. urophylla). These traits directly impact the optimal use of wood for cellulose pulp, paper, and energy production. A population of 1,000 trees sampled in a progeny trial was phenotyped directly or following the development and use of near-infrared spectroscopy calibration models. Trees were genotyped with 33,398 SNPs and 24,001 DArT-seq genome-wide markers and genomic realized relationship matrices (GRM) were used for parameter estimation with an individual-tree additive-dominant mixed model. Wood chemical properties and wood density showed stronger genetic control than growth, cellulose and fiber traits. Additive effects are the main drivers of genetic variation for all traits, but dominance plays an equally or more important role for growth, singularly in this hybrid. GRM´s with >10,000 markers provided stable relationships estimates and more accurate parameters than pedigrees by capturing the full genetic relationships among individuals and disentangling the non-additive from the additive genetic component. Low correlations between growth and wood properties indicate that simultaneous selection for wood traits can be applied with minor effects on genetic gain for growth. Conversely, moderate to strong correlations between wood density and chemical traits exist, likely due to their interdependency on cell wall structure such that responses to selection will be connected for these traits. Our results illustrate the advantage of using genome-wide marker data to inform tree breeding in general and have important consequences for operational breeding of eucalypt urograndis hybrids."
https://openalex.org/W2951071478,"Background In recent months, multiple publications have demonstrated the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify images of skin cancer as precisely as dermatologists. However, these CNNs failed to outperform the International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2016 challenge which ranked the average precision for classification of dermoscopic melanoma images. Accordingly, the technical progress represented by these studies is limited. In addition, the available reports are impossible to reproduce, due to incomplete descriptions of training procedures and the use of proprietary image databases or non-disclosure of used images. These factors prevent the comparison of various CNN classifiers in equal terms. Objective To demonstrate the training of an image-classifier CNN that outperforms the winner of the ISBI 2016 CNNs challenge by using open source images exclusively. Methods A detailed description of the training procedure is reported while the used images and test sets are disclosed fully, to insure the reproducibility of our work. Results Our CNN classifier outperforms all recent attempts to classify the original ISBI 2016 challenge test data (full set of 379 test images), with an average precision of 0.709 (vs. 0.637 of the ISBI winner) and with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.85. Conclusion This work illustrates the potential for improving skin cancer classification with enhanced training procedures for CNNs, while avoiding the use of costly equipment or proprietary image data."
https://openalex.org/W2955663165,"Excessive alcohol consumption induces intestinal dysbiosis of the gut microbiome and reduces gut epithelial integrity. This often leads to portal circulation–mediated translocation of gut-derived microbial products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), to the liver, where these products engage Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and initiate hepatic inflammation, which promotes alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Although the key self-destructive process of autophagy has been well-studied in hepatocytes, its role in macrophages during ALD pathogenesis remains elusive. Using WT and myeloid cell–specific autophagy-related 7 (Atg7) knockout (Atg7ΔMye) mice, we found that chronic ethanol feeding for 6 weeks plus LPS injection enhances serum alanine aminotransferase and IL-1β levels and augments hepatic C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) expression in WT mice, a phenotype that was further exacerbated in Atg7ΔMye mice. Atg7ΔMye macrophages exhibited defective mitochondrial respiration and displayed elevated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and inflammasome activation relative to WT cells. Interestingly, compared with WT cells, Atg7ΔMye macrophages also had a drastically increased abundance and nuclear translocation of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) after LPS stimulation. Mechanistically, LPS induced co-localization of IRF1 with the autophagy adaptor p62 and the autophagosome, resulting in subsequent IRF1 degradation. However, upon p62 silencing or Atg7 deletion, IRF1 started to accumulate in autophagy-deficient macrophages and translocated into the nucleus, where it induced CCL5 and CXCL10 expression. In conclusion, macrophage autophagy protects against ALD by promoting IRF1 degradation and removal of damaged mitochondria, limiting macrophage activation and inflammation.

Therefore, it is of utmost importance to understand how chronic liver inflammation is induced as a result of excessive alcohol consumption.

Chronic alcohol consumption is well known to cause intestinal dysbiosis and compromise intestinal barrier function, which, in turn, increases gut permeability, allowing translocation of gut microbe–derived products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), to the liver through the portal circulation (4Seki E.

TLR4 engagement activates two parallel signaling branches that utilize the adaptor molecules MyD88 and TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF). The MyD88-dependent pathway, activated by all TLRs except for TLR3, is responsible for up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNFα, pro-IL-1β, IL-6, CXCL1, and CCL3), whereas the TRIF-mediated signaling axis (activated by TLR3 and TLR4) induces production of IFN-β, CCL5, and CXCL10 in macrophages (8Yamamoto M.

In addition to TLR4, accumulating evidence over the past decade suggests that the NLRP3 inflammasome, a key immune sensor of tissue damage, drives hepatic inflammation after chronic alcohol overconsumption, promoting ALD progression (10Petrasek J.

Notably, TLR4 also contributes to NLRP3 inflammasome activation, as it provides a strong “priming” signal to induce de novo synthesis of pro-IL-1β as well as NLRP3 up-regulation, a crucial step required for inflammasome activation and subsequent maturation of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β (11Tsutsui H.

Interestingly, autophagy has been shown to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation by promoting elimination of damaged mitochondria after NLRP3 activator stimulation. This ultimately prevents the generation of the NLRP3 inflammasome activators, mitochondrial ROS and oxidized mitochondrial DNA (16Zhong Z. Umemura A. Sanchez-Lopez E. Liang S. Shalapour S. Wong J.

Based on these findings, we investigated the role of macrophage autophagy in ALD pathogenesis. We demonstrated that chronic ethanol feeding suppressed macrophage autophagy, leading to overactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Moreover, decreased macrophage autophagy also results in defective autophagic degradation of IRF1, a transcription factor responsible for LPS-induced CCL5 and CXCL10 expression, exacerbating inflammation. In summary, our results provide novel insights for understanding the role of macrophage autophagy in ALD pathogenesis. First we investigated whether autophagy is altered in liver macrophages during ALD development. LC3B is a structural protein of autophagosomes that is lipidated to attach it to the autophagosomal membrane, converting it from LC3B-I to LC3B-II during autophagy, which is commonly used as a surrogate indicator for autophagy activity (19Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Levine B. Methods in mammalian autophagy research.Cell. 2010; 140 (20144757): 313-32610.1016/j.cell.2010.01.028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3531) Google Scholar). We found that liver macrophages from ethanol-fed mice exhibited a drastic reduction in LC3B-II abundance relative to those from control mice (Fig. 1, A and B). To determine whether autophagy flux is inhibited in liver macrophages in ALD, liver macrophages were treated with the lysosomal inhibitors ammonium chloride and leupeptin (Fig. 1A). Inhibition of lysosomal proteases increased LC3B-II and p62 levels in liver macrophages from control mice, whereas the LC3B-II expression levels in liver macrophages from ethanol-fed mice were much lower than those in liver macrophages from control mice, and inhibition of lysosomal proteases did not significantly increase either LC3B-II or p62 levels in Fig. 1, A–C. This suggests that autophagy activities are low and that autophagic flux is diminished in liver macrophages from ethanol-treated mice (19Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Levine B. Methods in mammalian autophagy research.Cell. 2010; 140 (20144757): 313-32610.1016/j.cell.2010.01.028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3531) Google Scholar). As macrophage autophagy activity is compromised in ALD, we went on to investigate the in vivo role of macrophage autophagy in alcohol-induced liver injury and steatosis using myeloid cell–specific, Atg7-deficient (Atg7ΔMye) mice that were subjected to ethanol feeding for 6 weeks. As shown in Fig. 2A, chronic ethanol feeding slightly increased serum ALT levels in WT mice, which was further exacerbated in Atg7ΔMye mice (Fig. 2A). To better mimic the pathological condition seen in ALD patients, in whom intestinal permeability is increased as a result of alcohol overconsumption, we i.p. injected a single dose of LPS, a gut-derived microbial product acting through TLR4 on liver macrophages to promote ALD development, into mice after 6 weeks of ethanol feeding. Ethanol and LPS co-administration resulted in dramatically elevated serum ALT levels in Atg7ΔMye mice compared with WT control mice (Fig. 2A). This correlated with a significant increase in the numbers of TUNEL-positive apoptotic hepatocytes as well as enhanced cell death (as measured by cleaved caspase-3 immunoblot analysis) in Atg7ΔMye mice compared with their WT littermates (Fig. 2, B–D). Additionally, hepatic steatosis was dramatically increased in Atg7ΔMye mice after ethanol and LPS co-administration (Fig. 2E). These results collectively demonstrate that macrophage autophagy inhibits liver injury and steatosis in mice after ALD is induced. A number of previous studies have demonstrated that macrophage autophagy negatively regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation and subsequent IL-1β maturation (16Zhong Z. Umemura A. Sanchez-Lopez E. Liang S. Shalapour S. Wong J. He F. Boassa D. Perkins G. Ali S.R. McGeough M.D. Ellisman M.H. Seki E. Gustafsson A.B.

Although there were no significant differences in hepatic IL-1β and TNFα mRNA levels between WT and Atg7ΔMye mice after ethanol and LPS treatment, serum IL-1β protein levels were drastically elevated in Atg7ΔMye mice after ALD was induced (Fig. 3, A–C). These data suggest that macrophage autophagy inhibits IL-1β maturation in ALD. To further confirm this notion, we measured caspase-1 cleavage as well as IL-1β production in WT and Atg7ΔMye BMDMs after LPS + ATP treatment. Indeed, deficiency in Atg7 led to much more pronounced mature IL-1β production after LPS + ATP stimulation (Fig. 3D). This further correlated with more abundant caspase-1 p20 subunits in culture supernatants from Atg7ΔMye BMDMs, although Atg7 deficiency had no effect on the expression of pro-IL-1β or TNF secretion (Fig. 3, E and F). We then investigated whether increased IL-1β by Atg7 deficiency is associated with increased death in hepatocytes from ethanol-fed Atg7ΔMye mice (Fig. 2). We examined hepatocyte apoptosis in response to recombinant IL-1β. We found that IL-1β did not increase hepatocyte death in normal hepatocytes, whereas hepatocytes isolated from ethanol diet–fed mice increased TUNEL-positive cells and cleaved caspase-3 by IL-1β treatment (Fig. 3, G and H), suggesting that ethanol feeding sensitized hepatocytes to IL-1β-induced death. Subsequently, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanism of ethanol-mediated IL-1β production. Because mitochondrial ROS are critical for NLRP3 inflammasome activation, we next compared mitochondrial ROS production in WT versus Atg7ΔMye BMDMs. As shown in Fig. 4A, Atg7 deficiency in macrophages resulted in overproduction of mitochondrial ROS (Fig. 4, A and B). These results suggest that macrophage autophagy suppresses mitochondrial ROS production, preventing NLRP3 inflammasome activation as well as IL-1β maturation. We then examined whether Atg7 deficiency and ethanol can compromise mitochondrial function in liver macrophages by measuring the oxygen consumption rate (OCR). As shown in Fig. 4, B and C, liver macrophages from Atg7ΔMye mice and ethanol-fed WT mice had a lower OCR relative to control diet–fed mice. These results suggest that autophagy suppression by chronic ethanol feeding could be associated with compromised mitochondrial function. Last, we examined whether mitochondrial ROS contributes to IL-1β production. MitoQ is a selective inhibitor of mitochondrial ROS (16Zhong Z. Umemura A. Sanchez-Lopez E. Liang S. Shalapour S. Wong J. He F. Boassa D. Perkins G. Ali S.R. McGeough M.D. Ellisman M.H. Seki E. Gustafsson A.B. Hoffman H.M. et al.NF-κB restricts inflammasome activation via elimination of damaged mitochondria.Cell. 2016; 164 (26919428): 896-91010.1016/j.cell.2015.12.057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). MitoQ treatment suppressed IL-1β production and caspase-1 activation (Fig. 4, D and E), suggesting that increased mitochondrial ROS in Atg7ΔMye BMDMs promotes inflammasome activation, producing IL-1β. Taken together, these results suggest that chronic ethanol consumption reduces macrophage autophagy, causing an accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria and ROS in liver macrophages, promoting NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β production.Figure 4Macrophage autophagy negatively regulates activation of caspase-1 and IL-1β maturation through mitochondrial ROS production.

In addition to NLRP3 inflammasome overaction, we observed that Atg7ΔMye mice also exhibited increased production of CCL5 and CXCL10 after LPS or chronic ethanol feeding (Fig. 5, A and B). Notably, chronic ethanol feeding plus LPS injection induced a further elevation of CCL5 and CXCL10 levels in Atg7ΔMye mice relative to their WT littermates (Fig. 5, A and B). In line with this notion, Atg7ΔMye BMDMs, compared with WT cells, produced more CCL5 and CXCL10 after LPS stimulation (Fig. 5C). CCL5 and CXCL10 induction is mediated by the TLR4-TRIF pathway (8Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Sanjo H. Takeuchi O. Sugiyama M. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S. Role of adaptor TRIF in the MyD88-independent toll-like receptor signaling pathway.Science. 2003; 301 (12855817): 640-64310.1126/science.1087262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2497) Google Scholar). Indeed, macrophages deficient in TRIF, but not MyD88, abolished LPS-induced expression of CCL5 and CXCL10 (Fig. 5D). These results together suggest that, in addition to antagonizing NLRP3 inflammasome activation, macrophage autophagy also inhibits CCL5 and CXCL10 production and may thereby further prevent alcohol-mediated liver injury, inflammation, and steatosis. To further delineate how macrophage autophagy inhibits CCL5 and CXCL10 production, we examined whether any of the TLR4-TRIF pathway downstream signaling molecules may be regulated by autophagy. Engagement of the TLR4–TRIF–dependent pathway is known to activate the transcription factor IRF3. However, we did not observe any apparent differences in the levels of IRF3 mRNA or phosphorylated IRF3 protein in Atg7-deficient macrophages relative to WT cells over 10 h after LPS treatment (Fig. 6, A and B). In addition to IRF3, it has been reported that IRF1 is required for IL-1β–induced CCL5 and CXCL10 transcription (21Harikumar K.B. Yester J.W. Surace M.J. Oyeniran C. Price M.M. Huang W.C. Hait N.C. Allegood J.C. Yamada A. Kong X. Lazear H.M. Bhardwaj R. Takabe K. Diamond M.S. Luo C. et al.K63-linked polyubiquitination of transcription factor IRF1 is essential for IL-1-induced production of chemokines CXCL10 and CCL5.Nat. Immunol. 2014; 15 (24464131): 231-23810.1038/ni.2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Interestingly, IRF1 protein but not mRNA abundance was dramatically increased in Atg7-deficient macrophages relative to WT cells as early as 4 h after LPS stimulation (Fig. 6, A and B). We therefore examined whether autophagy participates in posttranslational regulation of IRF1 in macrophages. By taking advantage of BMDMs from LC3B-GFP transgenic mice, we visualized autophagosome formation by microscopy. Upon LPS stimulation, IRF1 expression started to increase, and some IRF1 proteins were already translocated into the nucleus (Fig. 6C). Notably, a significant fraction of IRF1 was retained in the cytosol, where it co-localized with LC3-GFP–labeled autophagosomes (Fig. 6C). However, in Atg7-deficient LC3B-GFP transgenic macrophages where autophagosome formation was disrupted, the majority of IRF1 proteins were already translocated into the nucleus (Fig. 6C). Together, these results clearly demonstrate that autophagy inhibits IRF1 protein degradation and prevents its nuclear translocation, inhibiting IRF1-dependent transcription of downstream genes. Indeed, we found that IRF1 is required for LPS-induced CCL5 and CXCL10 production (Fig. 6D) and further confirmed that induction of IRF1 by LPS is largely dependent on the TRIF-dependent pathway (Fig. 6, E and F). Taken together, these results suggest that macrophage autophagy prevents LPS-induced CCL5 and CXCL10 expression by promoting the degradation of IRF1. As p62/SQSTM1 is a key adaptor protein that connects the autophagic cargo with autophagosome (14Li Y. Wang S. Ni H.M. Huang H. Ding W.X. Autophagy in alcohol-induced multiorgan injury: mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.Biomed Res. Int. 2014; 2014 (25140315): 498491Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we next examined whether p62 participates in autophagy-mediated IRF1 degradation. Indeed, IRF1 was co-localized with both LC3B autophagosome and p62 aggregates after LPS stimulation (Fig. 7A). Moreover, p62-deficient macrophages (shp62 immortalized BMDMs) had increased IRF1 in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions compared with control macrophages after LPS stimulation (Fig. 7B). Consistently, LPS-induced CCL5 and CXCL10 production was also significantly higher in p62-silenced macrophages relative to control cells (Fig. 7, C and D).

Here, we expanded this 3D platform to assess the interactions of normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) and human primary mammary fibroblasts (HPMFs) with breast cancer-derived, tumorigenic cells (MDA-MB-231). Medium conditioned by MDA-MB-231 cells activates both types of fibroblasts, imbuing them with the capacity to accelerate the rate of aggregation and coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells more than four fold. Acceleration is achieved 1) by direct physical interactions with MDA-MB-231 cells, in which activated fibroblasts penetrate the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel 3D environment and function as supporting scaffolds for MDA-MB-231 aggregation and coalescence, and 2) through the release of soluble accelerating factors, including matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) and, in the case of activated NHDFs, SDF-1α/CXCL12. Fibroblast activation includes changes in morphology, motility, and gene expression. Podoplanin (PDPN) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) are upregulated by more than nine-fold in activated NHDFs while activated HPMFs upregulate FAP, vimentin, desmin, platelet derived growth factor receptor A and S100A4. Overexpression of PDPN, but not FAP, in NHDF cells in the absence of MDA-MB-231-conditioned medium, activates NHDFs. These results reveal that complex reciprocal signaling between fibroblasts and cancer cells, coupled with their physical interactions, occurs in a highly coordinated fashion that orchestrates aggregation and coalescence, behaviors specific to cancer cells in a 3D environment. These in vitro interactions may reflect events involved in early tumorigenesis, particularly in cases of field cancerization, and may represent a new mechanism whereby cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote tumor growth."

We monitored WNT-3A–induced activation by detection of phosphorylation of LDL receptor–related protein 6 (LRP6), electrophoretic mobility shift of the phosphoprotein Dishevelled (DVL), β-catenin stabilization and dephosphorylation, and TCF-dependent transcription.

https://openalex.org/W2954187924,"Recent plastid genome (plastome) studies of legumes (family Fabaceae) have shown that this family has undergone multiple atypical plastome evolutions from each of the major clades. The tribe Desmodieae belongs to the Phaseoloids, an important but systematically puzzling clade within Fabaceae. In this study, we investigated the plastome evolution of Desmodieae and analyzed its phylogenetic signaling. We sequenced six complete plastomes from representative members of Desmodieae and from its putative sister Phaseoloid genus Mucuna. Those genomes contain 128 genes and range in size from 148,450 to 153,826 bp. Analyses of gene and intron content revealed similar characters among the members of Desmodieae and Mucuna. However, there were also several distinct characters identified. The loss of the rpl2 intron was a feature shared between Desmodieae and Mucuna, whereas the loss of the rps12 intron was specific to Desmodieae. Likewise, gene loss of rps16 was observed in Mucuna but not in Desmodieae. Substantial sequence variation of ycf4 was detected from all the sequenced plastomes, but pseudogenization was restricted to the genus Desmodium. Comparative analysis of gene order revealed a distinct plastome conformation of Desmodieae compared with other Phaseoloid legumes, i.e., an inversion of an approximately 1.5-kb gene cluster (trnD-GUC, trnY-GUA, and trnE-UUC). The inversion breakpoint suggests that this event was mediated by the recombination of an 11-bp repeat motif. A phylogenetic analysis based on the plastome-scale data set found the tribe Desmodieae is a highly supported monophyletic group nested within the paraphyletic Phaseoleae, as has been found in previous phylogenetic studies. Two subtribes (Desmodiinae and Lespedezinae) of Desmodieae were also supported as monophyletic groups. Within the subtribe Lespedezinae, Lespedeza is closer to Kummerowia than Campylotropis."

We utilized in vitro assays, 3D gastric gland organoid cultures, mouse models, and human tissue samples to investigate the biological and molecular impact of DARPP-32 on activation of IGF1R and STAT3 signaling and gastric tumorigenesis. DARPP-32 enhanced phosphorylation of IGF1R (Y1135), a step that was critical for STAT3 phosphorylation at Y705, nuclear localization, and transcription activation. By using proximity ligation and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we found that IGF1R and DARPP-32 co-existed in the same protein complex. Binding of DARPP-32 to IGF1R promoted IGF1R phosphorylation with subsequent activation of downstream SRC and STAT3. Analysis of gastric tissues from the TFF1 knockout (KO) mouse model of gastric neoplasia, demonstrated phosphorylation of STAT3 in the early stages of gastric tumorigenesis. By crossing the TFF1 KO mice with DARPP-32 (DP) knockout (KO) mice, that have normal stomach, we obtained double knockout (TFF1 KO/DP KO). The gastric mucosa from the double KO mice did not show phosphorylation of IGF1R or STAT3. In addition, the TFF1 KO/DP KO mice had a significant delay in developing neoplastic gastric lesions. Analysis of human gastric cancer tissue microarrays, showed high levels of DARPP-32 and positive immunostaining for nuclear STAT3 in cancer tissues, as compared to non-cancer histologically normal tissues. In summary, the DARPP-32-IGF1R signaling axis plays a key role in regulating the STAT3 signaling, a critical step in gastric tumorigenesis."

Here, we isolated bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from several CML patients by Ficoll-Hypaque density-gradient centrifugation for coculture with K562 and BV173 cells with or without TKIs. We used real-time quantitative PCR to assess the level of interleukin 7 (IL-7) expression in the MSCs and employed immunoblotting to monitor protein expression in the BCR/ABL, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. We also used a xenograft tumor model to examine the in vivo effect of different MSCs on CML cells. MSCs from patients with IM-resistant CML protected K562 and BV173 cells against IM- or NI-induced cell death, and this protection was due to increased IL-7 secretion from the MSCs. Moreover, IL-7 levels in the BM of patients with IM-resistant CML were significantly higher than in healthy donors or IM-sensitive CML patients. IL-7 elicited IM and NI resistance via BCR/ABL-independent activation of JAK1/STAT5 signaling, but not of JAK3/STAT5 or PI3K/AKT signaling. IL-7 or JAK1 gene knockdown abrogated IL-7–mediated STAT5 phosphorylation and IM resistance in vitro and in vivo. Because high IL-7 levels in the BM mediate TKI resistance via BCR/ABL-independent activation of JAK1/STAT5 signaling, combining TKIs with IL-7/JAK1/STAT5 inhibition may have significant utility for managing CML.

We carried out cross-sectional surveys in four municipalities: Santa Isabel do Rio Negro (SIRN-AM) (n = 328); Nossa Senhora de Nazaré (NSN-PI) and Teresina (TER-PI) (n = 605 and n = 297, respectively); and Cachoeiras de Macacu (CAM-RJ) (n = 543). We also studied 61 fecal samples/adult worms obtained from pigs (n = 53 in NSN-PI and n = 8 in TER-PI). A ~450 bp fragment of the Ascaris cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) and ~400 bp of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (nad1) were amplified and sequenced. Maximum-likelihood (ML) tree and Median-joining (MJ) haplotype network analyses were performed. We also performed scanning electron micrographs of adult specimens. Positivity rates were 93/328 (28.4%) in SIRN-AM, 6/297 (2.0%) in TER-PI, 0/605 (0%) in NSN-PI, and 6/543 (1.1%) in CAM-RJ. In NSN-PI it reached 11/53 (20.7%) in pigs. The MJ network based on cox1 locus (383 bp) revealed three main clusters, one centered around haplotypes H01/H28/H32 and the other around H07/H11. The cox1 haplotypes had a heterogeneous distribution, showing no pattern by geographic region, and high haplotype diversity. The ML trees based on cox1 and nad1 loci showed a similar topology with each other, and with the haplotype networks. Three distinct clusters were observed. Sequences of cox1 and nad1 from humans and animals were distributed throughout the tree and it was not possible to differentiate specimens of human and swine origin. Ascaris populations obtained from humans and swine in different Brazilian regions are not discriminable through the genetic markers used, which indicates the potential for zoonotic transmission and the need for better control of these infections in swine herds, mainly when created in a peridomestic environment."
https://openalex.org/W2955161187,"Background Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the major public health problems in Ethiopia. Data on genetic diversity and resistance profile of circulating TB strains is critical for informing the national TB control program. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 213 smear positive pulmonary TB patients between 2015 and 2016. Sputum samples were cultured on LJ media following the Petroff’s method. Region of difference-9 (RD9)-deletion typing and spoligo-typing were performed for molecular analysis of M. tuberculosis at species and strain levels, respectively. Drug sensitivity and mutation patterns of the isolates were assessed by the conventional indirect proportion method and molecular line probe assays (LPAs), respectively. Data were analyzed using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) software version 20. Results Spoligo-typing of 150 M. tuberculosis isolates led to 57 different patterns of which 25 were new strains. The majority (71.6%) of the isolates were grouped in to 17 clusters consisting 2 to 24 isolates. The majority of the strains belonged to Euro-American lineage and the predominant spoligotypes were SIT 37 and SIT 149. MDR-TB was detected in 5.2% and 20.3% of new and retreatment cases, respectively. Two MDR-TB isolates exhibited additional resistance to one of the second line anti-TB drugs. Common gene mutations including S531L, S315T1 and M306V were detected in RIF, INH and EMB resistant strains, respectively. Conclusions The identification of several new strains, higher proportion of MDR-TB and higher clustering rate in this study, warrants the need for re-enforcement of the national TB control program. The detection of common gene mutations in the majority drug resistant strains might suggest the feasibility of LPAs for rapid screening of drug resistant M. tuberculosis strains in Ethiopia."

https://openalex.org/W2955678108,"Introduction Providing safety culture is the first and undoubtedly most important feature that patient care should have, as it is the basis for other measures. There are associations between Burnout Syndrome and lower perceptions of safety culture and greater risks in patient safety. Objective To analyze the relationship between patient safety culture and burnout in pediatric hospitals. Method This is a cross-sectional study with a quantitative approach performed with health professionals who work in pediatric hospitals located in the Metropolitan Region of Cariri, Northeastern Brazil. The study enrolled 148 professionals who performed direct health care for the child in three different hospitals. For the evaluation of the Patient Safety Culture, the version, translated and validated for Brazil, of the Survey on Patient Safety Culture (HSOPSC) questionnaire was applied and to evaluate the occurrence of Burnout, we chose the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Results Among the dimensions of burnout that presented the most moderate to high, depersonalization and low professional achievement stand out. When considering the syndrome with the professional who presented a ""high"" score in only one of the three dimensions, it was identified that 44.6% presented the disease. All patient safety dimensions studied correlated with some dimension of burnout. Conclusion The study evidenced the influence of all patient safety domains for the development of burnout syndrome in pediatric professionals. Also, it was identified that the organizational climate is the main determinant of burnout, especially in what refers to ""teamwork between units""."
https://openalex.org/W2955847459,"Pneumonia is one of the most economically important respiratory diseases of calves and knowledge of the impact of clinical disease on pharmacokinetics (PK) in young calves is limited. This study was undertaken to investigate the efficacy and PK of two antibiotics, tulathromycin and danofloxacin, in two age groups of calves experimentally infected with Pasteurella multocida. Both danofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, and tulathromycin, a macrolide antibiotic is approved for the treatment of bovine respiratory disease (BRD). To evaluate potential influences of age and disease on drug distribution and elimination in calves, plasma, interstitial fluid (ISF), and pulmonary epithelial lining fluid (PELF) were analyzed for drug concentrations. Concentrations for both drugs in the PELF were estimated by a urea dilution assay of the collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. Age was determined to be a significant covariate for calves administered danofloxacin and tulathromycin for plasma PK parameters. For calves administered danofloxacin, the area under the curve (AUC) in the plasma was lower in 6-month old calves (18.9 ± 12.6 hr* μg/mL) vs. 3-week old calves (32.0 ± 8.2 hr* μg/mL). Clearance (CL/F) of danofloxacin was higher in 6-month old calves. In contrast, tulathromycin plasma concentrations were higher in 6 month old calves and CL/F was higher in 3-week old calves. Age did not significantly influence the ISF concentrations of danofloxacin or tulathromycin in calves with respiratory disease, unlike previous studies which reported higher ISF concentrations of danofloxacin and tulathromycin in 6-month old calves when compared to younger calves. PELF concentrations were higher than plasma and ISF for both danofloxacin and tulathromycin, but did not differ between age groups. Potential reasons for age-related differences on plasma concentration–time profiles and the impact of disease on the partitioning of the drug from the blood to the lungs and ISF as a function of age are explored."
https://openalex.org/W2956150507,"Ramadan fasting is compulsory for all healthy adult Muslims. Although sick people are exempted from Ramadan fasting, some patients such as hemodialysis patients prefer to fast during Ramadan. The effect of Ramadan fasting on clinical outcomes and biochemical markers among hemodialysis patients is not clear. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of daily Ramadan fasting and partial Ramadan fasting on key biochemical and clinical markers among hemodialysis patients as compared to hemodialysis patients who chose not to fast during Ramadan.A prospective cohort study of 269 end stage renal disease patients were recruited from the hemodialysis unit in An-Najah National University Hospital, Nablus, Palestine. The participants were divided into three cohorts based on their plans for fasting during Ramadan in May 2018; Ramadan fasting group (RFG), Ramadan partial fasting group (RPFG) and Ramadan not-fasting group (RNFG). Key clinical and biochemical markers were measured before, during and after Ramadan.After adjustment for diabetic and hypertension status and other sociodemographic variables, RFG had higher mean inter-dialytic weight gain (IDWG) by 0.62 kg than RNFG (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26, 0.99). RPFG also had slight increase in mean IDWG than RNFG by 0.35 kg (95% CI 0.11, 0.60). Additionally, RFG and RPFG had significant increase in mean serum potassium as compared to RNFG. Diabetes was independently associated with increased IDWG by 0.48 kg (0.25, 0.72). Diabetes and hypertension were associated with some independent changes in biochemical markers, but these were clinically negligible.Our findings suggest that Ramadan fasting (fully or partially) is tolerable by hemodialysis patients and is not associated with important clinical complications. However, these patients should be made aware of the potential risk of fluid overload and hyperkalemia, if they decide to fast during Ramadan. Thus, they should be closely monitored and instructed to adhere to their dietary and fluid intake allowances. Further prospective cohort studies with comprehensive dietary measures and information on adverse clinical outcomes may provide more evidence about the tolerability and safety of Ramadan fasting by hemodialysis patients."
https://openalex.org/W2954794039,"Background and aims The occurrence of endothelial alterations in the liver and in the splanchnic vasculature of cirrhotic patients and experimental models of liver diseases has been demonstrated. However, the pathological role of the portal vein endothelium in this clinical context is scarcely studied and, therefore, deserves attention. In this context, we aimed to investigate whether pathological endothelial activation occurs in the portal vein of cirrhotic rats. Methods Cirrhosis was induced in wistar rats by CCl4 inhalation. We generated immortalized endothelial cells from the portal vein of control (CT-iPVEC) and cirrhotic rats (CH-iPVEC) by retroviral transduction of the SV40 T antigen. We assessed differential gene expression and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in iPVECs and in portal veins of control and cirrhotic rats. Finally, we assessed the therapeutic effectiveness of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2NP) on reversing PVEC activation and macrophage polarization. Results CH-iPVECs overexpressed collagen-I, endothelin-1, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, IL-6 and PlGF genes. These results were consistent with the differential expression showed by whole portal veins from cirrhotic rats. In addition, CH-iPVECs showed a significant increase in intracellular ROS and the capacity of potentiating M1 polarization in macrophages. The treatment of CH-iPVECs with CeO2NPs blocked intracellular ROS formation and IL-6 and TIMP-2 gene overexpression. In agreement with the in vitro results, the chronic treatment of cirrhotic rats with CeO2NPs also resulted in the blockade of both ROS formation and IL-6 gene overexpression in whole portal veins. Conclusions Endothelial cells from portal vein of cirrhotic rats depicted an abnormal phenotype characterized by a differential gene expression and the induction of M1 polarization in macrophages. We identified the excess of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a major contributor to this altered phenotype. In addition, we demonstrated the utility of the nanomaterial cerium oxide as an effective antioxidant capable of reverse some of these pathological features associated with the portal vein in the cirrhosis condition."
https://openalex.org/W2951674772,"How pluripotent stem cells differentiate into the main germ layers is a key question of developmental biology. Here, we show that the chromatin-related factor Whsc1 (also known as Nsd2 and MMSET) has a dual role in pluripotency exit and germ layer specification of embryonic stem cells. On induction of differentiation, a proportion of Whsc1-depleted embryonic stem cells remain entrapped in a pluripotent state and fail to form mesendoderm, although they are still capable of generating neuroectoderm. These functions of Whsc1 are independent of its methyltransferase activity. Whsc1 binds to enhancers of the mesendodermal regulators Gata4, T (Brachyury), Gata6 and Foxa2, together with Brd4, and activates the expression of these genes. Depleting each of these regulators also delays pluripotency exit, suggesting that they mediate the effects observed with Whsc1. Our data indicate that Whsc1 links silencing of the pluripotency regulatory network with activation of mesendoderm lineages. Tian et al. report that the chromatin-related factor Whsc1 regulates the exit from pluripotency and germ layer specification of mouse embryonic stem cells by binding to enhancers of mesendodermal regulators."
https://openalex.org/W2954867709,"The integration of conflicting signals in response to environmental constraints is essential to efficient plant growth and development. The light-dependent and the stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent signaling pathways play opposite roles in many aspects of plant development. While these pathways have been extensively studied, the complex nature of their molecular dialogue is still obscure. When mobilized by the Arabidopsis thaliana β-glucosidase 1 (AtBG1), the glucose ester-conjugated inactive form of ABA has proven to be a source of the active hormone that is essential for the adaptation of the plant to water deficit, as evidenced by the impaired stomatal closure of atbg1 mutants in response to water stress. In a suppressor screen designed to identify the molecular components of AtBG1-associated physiological and developmental mechanisms, we identified the mutation variant of AtBG1 traits (vat1), a new mutant allele of the red light/far-red light photoreceptor PHYTOCHROME B (PHYB). Our study reveals that atbg1 plants harbor increased stomatal density in addition to impaired stomatal closure. We also provide evidence that the vat1/phyb mutation can restore the apparent transpiration of the atbg1 mutant by decreasing stomatal aperture and restoring a stomatal density similar to wild-type plants. Expression of key regulators of stomatal development showed a crosstalk between AtBG1-mediated ABA signaling and PHYB-mediated stomatal development. We conclude that the AtBG1-dependent regulation of ABA homeostasis and the PHYB-mediated light signaling pathways act antagonistically in the control of stomatal development."

Uphill glutamate uptake into cells is energetically driven by coupling to co-transport of three Na+ ions. In exchange, one K+ ion is counter-transported. Currently accepted transport mechanisms assume that Na+ and K+ effects are exclusive, resulting from competition of these cations at the binding level. Here, we used electrophysiological analysis to test the effects of K+ and Na+ on neuronal glutamate transporter excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1; the rat homologue of human excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (EAAT3)). Unexpectedly, extracellular K+ application to EAAC1 induced anion current, but only in the presence of Na+. This result could be explained with a K+/Na+ co-binding state in which the two cations simultaneously bind to the transporter. We obtained further evidence for this co-binding state, and its anion conductance, by analyzing transient currents when Na+ was exchanged for K+ and effects of the [K+]/[Na+] ratio on glutamate affinity. Interestingly, we observed the K+/Na+ co-binding state not only in EAAC1 but also in the subtypes EAAT1 and -2, which, unlike EAAC1, conducted anions in response to K+ only. We incorporated these experimental findings in a revised transport mechanism, including the K+/Na+ co-binding state and the ability of K+ to activate anion current.

https://openalex.org/W2953997722,"In the brain, the TrkA receptor for Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) is expressed primarily in the cholinergic system. TrkA/NGF support neuronal health and function, and deficiencies in this axis are associated with progressive cholinergic neuron atrophy and death, and with cognitive deficit in disorders such as Down's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. These observations led to the hypothesis that TrkA agonists may rescue atrophic cholinergic neurons and benefit cognition. Indeed, a small molecule TrkA partial agonist called D3 normalized TrkA signals and improved memory in cognitive impairment models of ageing and an APP mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Paradoxically, in young healthy mice chronic delivery of D3 caused impaired memory without impairing learning, a form of anterograde amnesia. Here, we use this as a model to study the mechanisms of impaired memory. In young healthy mice acute or chronic treatment with D3 induces hyperactivation of TrkA-mediated signals in hippocampus, and causes a deficit in hippocampal-dependent memory consolidation proximal to drug exposure, without affecting learning or memory retrieval. The impairment after acute drug exposure is reversible. The impairment after long-term drug exposure is irreversible, likely due to a decrease in hippocampal CA1 neuron basal arborization. These findings support the notion of a homeostatic role for TrkA in memory, and demonstrate the differential outcomes of TrkA (hyper)activation in healthy versus disease states."
https://openalex.org/W2953693663,"The human pathogen Helicobacter pylori is known for its colonization of the upper digestive system, where it escapes the harsh acidic environment by hiding in the mucus layer. One factor promoting this colonization is the helical cell shape of H. pylori. Among shape determining proteins are cytoskeletal elements like the recently discovered bactofilins. Bactofilins constitute a widespread family of polymer-forming bacterial proteins whose biology is still poorly investigated. Here we describe the first biochemical analysis of the bactofilin HP1542 of H. pylori reference strain 26695. Purified HP1542 forms sheet-like 2D crystalline assemblies, which clearly depend on a natively structured C-terminus. Polymerization properties and protein stability were investigated. Additionally, we also could demarcate HP1542 from amyloid proteins that share similarities with the bactofilin DUF domain. By using zonal centrifugation of total H. pylori cell lysates and immunfluorescence analysis we revealed peripheral membrane association of HP1542 mostly pronounced near mid-cell. Interestingly our results indicate that H. pylori bactofilin does not contribute to cell wall stability. This study might act as a starting point for biophysical studies of the H. pylori bactofilin biology as well as for the investigation of bactofilin cell physiology in this organism. Importantly, this study is the first biochemical analysis of a bactofilin in a human pathogen."

TSOL is a component of MS3T, a novel multifunctional surface/sub-surface/systemic therapeutic formulation. Antimicrobial activity of TSOL was compared with the antimicrobial compound ZnO against X. citri subsp. citri and ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ surrogate Liberibacter crescens in batch cultures. X. citri subsp. citri and L. crescens were also introduced into microfluidic chambers, and the inhibitory action of TSOL against biofilm formation was evaluated. The minimum inhibitory concentration of TSOL for both X. citri subsp. citri and L. crescens was 40ppm. TSOL was bactericidal to X. citri subsp. citri and L. crescens above 150 ppm and 200 ppm, respectively. On the contrary, ZnO was more effective as a bactericidal agent against L. crescens than X. citri subsp. citri. TSOL was more effective in controlling growth and biofilm formation of X. citri subsp. citri in batch cultures compared to ZnO. Time-lapse video imaging microscopy showed that biofilm formation of X. citri subsp. citri was inhibited in microfluidic chambers treated with 60 ppm TSOL. TSOL also inhibited further growth of already formed X. citri subsp. citri and L. crescens biofilms in microfluidic chambers. Leaf spraying of TSOL showed higher plant uptake and systemic movement in citrus (Citrus reshni) plants compared to that of ZnO, suggesting that TSOL is a promising antimicrobial compound to control vascular plant pathogens such as ‘Ca.

DNA methylation alterations are not restricted to the immediate peritumor environment, but spatially widespread in the adjacent and distant histologically normal prostate tissues. In the current study, we utilized high-throughput methylation arrays to identify epigenetic changes in the urine from men with and without cancer. Design, setting, and participants DNA urine samples were enriched for methylated fragments using MBD methyl-binding antibodies and applied to high density CytoScanHD arrays. Significant loci were validated using quantitative pyrosequencing and binary logistic regression modeling applied to urine sample analyses in a training (n = 83) and validation approach (n = 84). Methylation alterations in prostate tissues using pyrosequencing at the PLA2G16 locus were examined in 38 histologically normal specimens from men with (TA, n = 26) and without (NTA, n = 12) cancer and correlated to gene expression. Results Methylation microarrays identified 3,986 loci showing significantly altered methylation in the urine samples from patients with PC compared to those without (TA vs NTA; p<0.01). These loci were then compared against subjects with their prostates removed to exclude non-prostate cell markers yielding 196 significant regions. Multiple CpGs adjacent to PLA2G16 CpG island showed increased methylation in TA compared to NTA (p<0.01) in a large validation study of urine samples. The predictive accuracy of PLA2G16 methylation at CG2 showed the highest predictive value at 0.8 (odds ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.16–1.62; p<0.001). Using a probability cutoff of 0.065, the sensitivity and specificity of the multivariate model was 92% and 35%. When histologically normal prostate tissues/biopsies from patients with PC (TA) were compared to subjects without cancer, significant hypermethylation of PLA2G16 was noted (odds ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.71; p = 0.01). Conclusion PLA2G16 methylation defines an extensive field defect in histologically normal prostate tissue associated with PC.

https://openalex.org/W2955015451,"Over the period 1982-2015, temperatures have exhibited an asymmetric warming pattern diurnally, as well as seasonally across the Loess Plateau. However, very limited research has studied the implications and effects of such seasonally heterogeneous warming across the Loess Plateau. In this study, we also analyzed the time series trends and seasonal spatial patterns of the maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperatures and evaluated how different vegetation responded to daytime and nighttime warming in the Loess Plateau from 1982 to 2015 based on the NDVI and meteorological parameters (precipitation or temperature). We found that Tmax and Tmin significantly increased throughout the years except for Tmax in autumn, and the diurnal asymmetric warming showed some striking seasonal differences. For example, the increasing rates of Tmin in spring, summer, autumn, and winter were 0.75, 1.20, 1.88, and 1.10 times larger than that of Tmax, respectively. NDVI showed significantly positive correlation with Tmax and Tmin in spring and winter, while NDVI presented significantly positive correlation with Tmin in summer and Tmax in autumn across entire Loess Plateau. Furthermore, we also discovered diverse seasonal responses in terms of vegetation types to daytime and nighttime warming. For instance, Spring NDVI showed significantly positive partial correlations with Tmax and Tmin. In summer, grasslands and wetlands merely displayed significantly positive partial correlations with Tmin. Cultivated land presented significantly positive partial correlation between the NDVI and Tmax (Tmin) in autumn. In winter, cultivated land, forest, and grassland exhibited significantly positive partial correlation with Tmax and Tmin, while only wetland showed a significantly positive partial correlation with Tmax. Our results demonstrated responses of vegetation to climate extremes and enhance a better understanding of the seasonally different responses of vegetation under global climate change at different scale."

The solution is obtained via moving window optimization, a technique for solving inverse dynamics. An analysis is performed to modify the method to avoid oscillatory behavior of the resulting heat flux profile. The method parameters are tuned in relation to characteristic phases of the flight. Results are presented and correlated with measured flight data. Conclusions are drawn for better experiments for measuring heat flux on a sounding rocket skin."
https://openalex.org/W2955464325,"The subcortical mechanisms subtending the sensorimotor processes related to the peripersonal space (PPS) have been well characterized, whereas less evidence is available concerning the cortical mechanisms. We investigated the theta, alpha and beta event-related spectral perturbations (ERSP) while holding the forearm in different positions into the PPS of the face. Fifty healthy individuals were subjected to EEG recording while being provided with median nerve electric stimulation at the wrist of the right hand held at different hand-to-face distances. Theta and beta rhythms were significantly perturbed depending on the hand-to-face distance, whereas alpha oscillations reflected a more general, non-specific oscillatory response to the motor task. The perturbation of theta and beta frequency bands may reflect the processes of top-down modulation overseeing the conscious spatiotemporal encoding of sensory-motor information within the PPS. In other words, such perturbation reflects the continuous update of the conscious internal representations of the PPS to build up a purposeful and reflexive motor response."

However, their impacts on the soil microbial community, the driving force for soil N cycle and thus the environmental fate of N, are largely unknown. Here, the high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was used to evaluate how long-term defoliation management and grass growth habits (propagation types and photosynthetic pathways) modulated the soil microbial community. The investigation included three cool-season C3 grasses (creeping bentgrass, Kentucky bluegrass, and tall fescue) and three warm-season C4 grasses (bermudagrass, St. Augustinegrass, and zoysiagrass). Creeping bentgrass and bermudagrass were managed as putting greens with a lower mowing height; tall fescue spread in a tussock manner via tiller production whereas other grasses propagated in a creeping manner via rhizomes and/or stolons. Ordination analysis showed that both bacterial and fungal communities were primarily separated between putting green and non-putting green systems; and so were N-cycle gene relative abundances, with the putting greens being greater in N mineralization but lower in nitrification. Compared to warm-season grasses, cool-season grasses slightly and yet significantly enhanced the relative abundances of Chloroflexi, Verrucomicrobia, and Glomeromycota. Tall fescue yielded significantly greater bacterial and fungal richness than non-tussock grasses. As the main explanatory soil property, pH only contributed to < 18% of community compositional variations among turfgrass systems. Our results indicate that defoliation management was the main factor in shaping the soil microbial community and grass growth habits was secondary in modulating microbial taxon distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2954433471,"The regulation of cholesterol, an essential brain lipid, ensures proper neuronal development and function, as demonstrated by links between perturbations of cholesterol metabolism and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease. The central nervous system (CNS) acquires cholesterol via de novo synthesis, where glial cells provide cholesterol to neurons. Both lipoproteins and lipoprotein receptors are key elements in this intercellular transport, where the latter recognize, bind and endocytose cholesterol containing glia-produced lipoproteins. CNS lipoprotein receptors are like those in the periphery, among which include the ApoB, E binding lipolysis stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR). LSR is a multimeric protein complex that has multiple isoforms including α and α’, which are seen as a doublet at 68 kDa, and β at 56 kDa. While complete inactivation of murine lsr gene is embryonic lethal, studies on lsr +/- mice revealed altered brain cholesterol distribution and cognitive functions. In the present study, LSR profiling in different CNS regions revealed regiospecific expression of LSR at both RNA and protein levels. At the RNA level, the hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and olfactory bulb, all showed high levels of total lsr compared to whole brain tissues, whereas at the protein level, only the hypothalamus, olfactory bulb, and retina showed the highest levels of total LSR. Interestingly, major regional changes in LSR expression were observed in aged mice which suggests changes in cholesterol homeostasis in specific structures in the aging brain. Immunocytostaining of primary cultures of mature murine neurons and glial cells isolated from different CNS regions showed that LSR is expressed in both neurons and glial cells. However, lsr RNA expression in the cerebellum was predominantly higher in glial cells, which was confirmed by the immunocytostaining profile of cerebellar neurons and glia. Based on this observation, we would propose that LSR in glial cells may play a key role in glia-neuron cross talk, particularly in the feedback control of cholesterol synthesis to avoid cholesterol overload in neurons and to maintain proper functioning of the brain throughout life."
https://openalex.org/W2955708518,"Prescription of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) compared to warfarin for treating atrial fibrillation patients have increased substantially since their introduction in the England’s National Health Service. Assessment of the risk of strokes and bleeds in relation to the large-scale uptake in DOACs compared to warfarin at the clinical commissioning group (CCG) level needs to be carried out. Publicly available- aggregated, CCG level, multi-source health and prescription records data were interrogated to investigate the association between prescription rate of DOACs and stroke/ bleed events during the period of 2013 to 2016. Variability of prescription rates and patient numbers across 208 CCGs were used to infer the effect of DOACs on stroke and bleed risk. Relative risk (RR) and 95% credible intervals (CI) were estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo approach in JAGS. During the study period, the proportion of DOAC prescriptions increased at an average rate of 122% per annum. DOAC prescription was association with a 50% reduction in ischaemic (RR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.39, 0.57) and haemorrhagic stroke (RR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.26–0.77). In contrast, DOAC prescription reached significant association with reduction in gastrointestinal bleeds (RR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.73–0.98) but not clinically relevant bleeds (RR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.85–1.05). Sex stratified data showed significant association between DOAC prescription and reduction in haemorrhagic stroke risk (RR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.28–0.52) and gastrointestinal bleeds (RR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.63–0.93) in males only. Age stratified data suggested significant association with reduction in risk of both ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes in patients aged 70 years and above, and reduction in risk of clinically relevant and gastrointestinal bleeds in patients aged 70–79 years only. Publicly available health and prescription data for the English population indicates reduction in stroke and bleed risk in specific age and sex sub-groups with the uptake of DOACs compared to warfarin between 2013 and 2016."

A clinical decision-making process based on a multidisciplinary meeting was formalized in the Lyon university hospital.To investigate whether this decisional process ensured a clinical benefit to patients assigned to renal revascularization.Single-centre retrospective cohort study, including patients diagnosed from April 2013 to February 2015 with an atherosclerotic renal artery disease with a peak systolic velocity >180cm/s. For each patient, the decision taken in multidisciplinary meeting (medical treatment or revacularization) was compared to the one guided by international guidelines. Blood pressure values, number of antihypertensive medications, presence of an uncontrolled or resistant hypertension, and glomerular filtration rate at one-year follow-up were compared to baseline values. Safety data were collected.Forty-nine patients were included: 26 (53%) were assigned to a medical treatment and 23 (47%) to a renal revascularization. Therapeutic decision was in accordance with the 2013 American Health Association guidelines and with the 2017 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for 78% and 22% of patients who underwent revascularization, respectively. Patients assigned to revascularization presented a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (-23±34mmHg, p = 0.007), diastolic blood pressure (-12±18mmHg, p = 0.007), number of antihypertensive medications (-1.00±1.03, p = 0.001), and number of uncontrolled or resistant hypertension (p = 0.022 and 0.031) at one-year follow-up. Those parameters were not modified among patients assigned to medical treatment alone. There was no grade 3 adverse event.Based on a multidisciplinary selection of revascularization indications, patients on whom a renal revascularization was performed exhibited a significant improvement of blood pressure control parameters with no severe adverse events."

To clarify the basis of this tRNA gene–mediated (TGM) silencing, here, conducting a bioinformatics analysis of available ChIP-chip and ChIP-sequencing genomic data from yeast, we investigated whether the RNAP III transcriptional machinery can recruit protein factors required for RNAP II transcription. An analysis of 46 genome-wide protein-density profiles revealed that 12 factors normally implicated in RNAP II–mediated gene transcription are more enriched at tRNA than at mRNA loci. These 12 factors typically have RNA-binding properties, participate in the termination stage of the RNAP II transcription, and preferentially localize to the tRNA loci by a mechanism that apparently is based on the RNAP III transcription level. The factors included two kinases of RNAP II (Bur1 and Ctk1), a histone demethylase (Jhd2), and a mutated form of a nucleosome-remodeling factor (Spt6) that have never been reported to be recruited to tRNA loci. Moreover, we show that the expression levels of RNAP II–transcribed genes downstream of tRNA loci correlate with the distance from the tRNA gene by a mechanism that depends on their orientation. These results are consistent with the notion that pre-tRNAs recruit RNAP II–associated factors, thereby reducing the availability of these factors for RNAP II transcription and contributing, at least in part, to the TGM-silencing mechanism.

Nucleolar clustering of the tDNAs and the tRNA synthesis are not the only factors affecting TGM silencing. The integrity of pre-tRNA also appears to play a role in TGM silencing, considering that its alteration by transcript truncation relieves silencing effects in vivo (12Pratt-Hyatt M. Pai D.A.

A mutant of the small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein protein Cbf5 that relieves TGM silencing also dissociates the pre-tRNA and tRNA genes from the nucleolus, suggesting a possible role of the pre-tRNA subnuclear localization in the silencing mechanism (7Kendall A.

In this work, we report that some protein factors implicated in the termination stage of RNAP II transcription appear to be significantly recruited at RNAP III–transcribed loci by a mechanism that is positively correlated with their RNA-binding properties and with the RNAP III occupancy. The results suggest a new antagonistic model for TGM silencing in which the tRNA transcripts contribute to the silencing mechanism by reducing the availability of factors required for the normal RNAP II transcription. To investigate the mechanistic basis of TGM silencing, we evaluated the possibility that RNAP III transcriptional machinery could recruit specific RNAP II–associated factors. Large datasets related to the ChIP-chip and ChIP-sequencing genomic profiles of protein factors involved in the transcription by RNAP II have been produced and made available in recent years. These data have been principally used to establish where and when the RNAP II–associated factors act during the mRNA synthesis. In contrast, the possible interaction of these factors with the RNAP III transcriptional machinery has scarcely been considered. Yet, in some cases, the high signals of these factors detected in the RNAP III–transcribed tDNAs have been considered as artifacts of the technical procedures and deemed not worthy of particular attention (15Waldminghaus T. Skarstad K. ChIP on Chip: surprising results are often artifacts.BMC Genomics. 2010; 11 (20602746): 41410.1186/1471-2164-11-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 16Teytelman L. Thurtle D.M.

Here, we examined the genome-wide occupancy at RNAP III genes of protein factors with different functions and acting at different stages of the RNAP II transcriptional process, as illustrated in Table 1. We analyzed four datasets covering a total of 46 samples. To reduce the possible differences in ChIP profiles due to the use of various technical procedures, each dataset was characterized by samples acquired and processed by a single research group and was analyzed separately using at least one internal control constituted by ChIP profiles of RNAP II subunits. We considered an RNAP II–associated factor as significantly enriched at the tRNA loci if two conditions were met: first, its average ChIP signal at the tRNA loci had to be statistically higher than at the mRNA loci; second, to exclude false-positive results due to systematic technical artifacts, the RNAP II ChIP signals in samples within the same dataset had to be statistically higher at mRNA than at tRNA loci.Table 1ChIP-chip and ChiP-seq datasetsDatasetProtein nameDescriptionAaData are from Meinel et al.

Moreover, Nab2 was also shown to directly interact with RNAP III and have an important role in an efficient RNAP III transcription initiation (17Reuter L.M. Meinel D.M. Strässer K.

For these reasons, the genomic ChIP profiles of Nab2 and Nrd1 were taken as positive controls for the recruitment of RNAP II factors to tRNA loci. Fig. 1 illustrates our typical results for protein factors with a high and low preference for tRNA loci. For each transcription unit of tRNA (red squares) and mRNA (gray circles), Fig. 1 compares the average read counts of RNAP II with those of Nab2, Sub2, Hpr1, and the RNAP III subunit Rpc160, taken from dataset A (17Reuter L.M.

As expected, the signal of RNAP II is significantly higher at the mRNA than at tRNA loci, and the signal of RNAP III is higher at tRNA than at mRNA loci (p value (t test) < 0.000001).

As illustrated in Fig. 2, the co-occupancy of Sub2 and Nab2 is also supported by the strong correlation between their average ChIP counts at the tRNA loci (Pearson correlation coefficient (rp) = 0.79, n = 275, p < 0.0001). In contrast to Sub2 and Nab2, the genomic distribution of Hpr1, a subunit of the THO complex operating in coupling transcription elongation with mRNA export, is noticeably higher at the mRNA sites than at tDNAs (p value (t test) < 0.000001) (Fig. 1), consistent with its preference for mRNA loci.Figure 2Occupancy at tRNA loci.

The broken line indicates linear regression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Among the proteins of dataset A (Table 1), which included the Sub2, Hpr1, Nab2, Rpc160, and RNAP II examined above, two other RNAP II–associated factors exhibited a significant preference for tDNAs, Yra1 (p value (t test) < 0.000001) and, with weaker evidence, Npl3 (p value (t test) = 0.018) (Fig. S1). The remaining RNAP II–associated factors of dataset A (Gbp2, Hrb1, Mft1, and Tho2) exhibited a clear preference for the mRNA loci (Fig. S1). The above analysis of the read counts distribution between tRNA and mRNA loci was performed on all ChIP profiles of the four datasets listed in Table 1 (see Fig. S1). As a final result, we found that 13 of the 46 proteins investigated here exhibited a preferential localization at the tDNAs rather than the mRNA loci: the subunit of RNAP III Rpc160, eight RNAP II–associated factors (Nab2, Sub2, Yra1, Pcf11, Clp1, Rat1, Nrd1, and Npl3), one histone demethylase (Jhd2), two protein kinases (Bur1 and Ctk1), and a mutant of the nucleosome remodeling factor Spt6 lacking the 202 C-terminal residues (Spt6ΔCTD). It should be noted that, although not clearly evident and relatively weaker than the other factors, the occupancy of Nrd1 at tRNA sites satisfies the criterion of being statistically higher than at mRNA sites (p value (t test) <0.0002). The high levels of recruitment to the tRNA loci of Jhd2, Bur1, Ctk1, and Spt6ΔCTD (Fig. S2) are surprising because, to our knowledge, they have never been mentioned before either as genuine signals nor as artifacts. The results from the four datasets were consistent with each other; the enrichment at tDNAs of Pcf11, Sub2, and Yra1 was coherently validated by more than one dataset (see Table 1), and as expected by unbiased data, all the 11 RNAP II subunits examined here were richer at the mRNA than at the tRNA loci. Because dataset A also includes the ChIP profiles of the RNAP III subunit Rpc160 (17Reuter L.M. Meinel D.M. Strässer K. The poly(A)-binding protein Nab2 functions in RNA polymerase III transcription.Genes Dev. 2015; 29 (26220998): 1565-157510.1101/gad.266205.115Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 22Meinel D.M.

Recruitment of TREX to the transcription machinery by its direct binding to the phospho-CTD of RNA polymerase II.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9 (24244187): e100391410.1371/journal.pgen.1003914Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we used this dataset to determine whether the enrichment of RNAP II–associated factors at tDNAs correlated with the level of RNAP III. Among the 10 samples of dataset A, only those proteins with a highly significant signal at the tRNA loci (Nab2, Sub2, and Yra1) significantly and positively correlated with the RNAP III occupancy at tDNAs (rp = 0.67, 0.76, and 0.45, respectively, p < 0.0001) (Fig. S3). It is noteworthy that the Pearson partial correlation between the occupancy of RNAP III and Yra1 at the tRNA loci, after controlling for the Sub2 occupancy, was slightly negative and statistically insignificant (partial rp = −0.038, p = 0.53), suggesting that the recruitment of Yra1 to tDNA sites could be mediated by Sub2. It has previously been reported that Nab2 occupies the tRNA sites and the other RNAP III genes: RDN5, SNR6, SNR52, RPR1, RNA170, ZOD1, and SCR1 (17Reuter L.M. Meinel D.M. Strässer K. The poly(A)-binding protein Nab2 functions in RNA polymerase III transcription.Genes Dev. 2015; 29 (26220998): 1565-157510.1101/gad.266205.115Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Here, we found that the occupancies of Sub2 and Yra1 at the RNAP III genes others than the tDNAs positively correlated with the occupancy of Nab2 (rp = 0.92 and 0.61, respectively, p < 0.05). Moreover, as shown above for the tRNA loci, we found that the read counts of RNAP III at the RNAP III genes other than the tDNAs positively correlated with those of Nab2, Sub2, and Yra1 (rp = 0.82, 0.91, and 0.78, respectively, p < 0.005). Spt6 is an essential RNAP II transcription elongation factor (26Hartzog G.A. Wada T. Handa H. Winston F. Evidence that Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 control transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genes Dev. 1998; 12 (9450930): 357-36910.1101/gad.12.3.357Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) that coordinates chromatin structure and histone modifications (27DeGennaro C.M.

Biol. 2013; 33 (24100010): 4779-479210.1128/MCB.01068-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Its structure contains several domains, including an S1 RNA-binding domain and, at the C terminus, a tandem SH2 (tSH2) domain that binds the phosphorylated Rpb1 subunit of RNAP II (28Sdano M.A. Fulcher J.M. Palani S. Chandrasekharan M.B. Parnell T.J. Whitby F.G. Formosa T. Hill C.P. A novel SH2 recognition mechanism recruits Spt6 to the doubly phosphorylated RNA polymerase II linker at sites of transcription.Elife. 2017; 6 (28826505): e2872310.7554/eLife.28723Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Spt6 does not typically occupy the tRNA loci (29Perales R. Erickson B. Zhang L. Kim H. Valiquett E. Bentley D. Gene promoters dictate histone occupancy within genes.EMBO J. 2013; 32 (24013117): 2645-265610.1038/emboj.2013.194Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the deletion of its C terminus, which contains the RNAP II-binding domain, has partial effects on its in vivo occupancy at coding regions (30Burugula B.B. Jeronimo C. Pathak R. Jones J.W. Robert F. Govind C.K. Histone deacetylases and phosphorylated polymerase II C-terminal domain recruit Spt6 for cotranscriptional histone reassembly.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2014; 34 (25182531): 4115-412910.1128/MCB.00695-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Here, we analyzed the effects that the C-terminal deletion of Spt6 caused on its distribution between the mRNA and tRNA loci. As shown in Fig. 3, the occupancy of native Spt6 at tDNAs is low, as consistent with previous results (29Perales R. Erickson B. Zhang L. Kim H. Valiquett E. Bentley D. Gene promoters dictate histone occupancy within genes.EMBO J. 2013; 32 (24013117): 2645-265610.1038/emboj.2013.194Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Surprising, Spt6ΔCTD is significantly more enriched at the tDNAs than at the mRNA sites. This selective enrichment at tRNA loci upon the C-terminal deletion is illustrated in Fig. 4, where the occupancy at tRNA and the mRNA loci of Spt6 and Spt6ΔCTD are directly compared. Remarkably, the deletion of the C terminus only marginally reduced the correlation between Spt6 and RNAP II at the mRNA sites (rp(Spt6, RNAP II) = 0.97 and rp(Spt6ΔCTD, RNAP II) = 0.84).Figure 4Occupancy at tRNA and mRNA loci.

https://openalex.org/W2953884554,"In the course of recent comparative genomic studies conducted on nervous systems across the phylogeny, current thinking is leaning in favor of more heterogeneity among nervous systems than what was initially expected. The isolation and characterization of molecular components that constitute the cnidarian neuron is not only of interest to the physiologist but also, on a larger scale, to those who study the evolution of nervous systems. Understanding the function of those ancient neurons involves the identification of neurotransmitters and their precursors, the description of nutrients used by neurons for metabolic purposes and the identification of integral membrane proteins that bind to those compounds. Using a molecular cloning strategy targeting membrane proteins that are known to be present in all forms of life, we isolated a member of the solute carrier family 6 from the scyphozoan jellyfish Cyanea capillata. The phylogenetic analysis suggested that the new transporter sequence belongs to an ancestral group of the nutrient amino acid transporter subfamily and is part of a cluster of cnidarian sequences which may translocate the same substrate. We found that the jellyfish transporter is expressed in neurons of the motor nerve net of the animal. To this end, we established an in situ hybridization protocol for the tissues of C. capillata and developed a specific antibody to the jellyfish transporter. Finally, we showed that the gene that codes for the jellyfish transporter also expresses a long non-coding RNA. We hope that this research will contribute to studies that seek to understand what constitutes a neuron in species that belong to an ancient phylum."
