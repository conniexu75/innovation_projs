https://openalex.org/W1639188211,"Growth/differentiation factor-5 (GDF-5) is a member of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, which plays an important role in bone development in vivo. Mutations in the GDF-5 gene result in brachypodism in mice and Hunter-Thompson type chondrodysplasia in human. BMPs transduce their effects through binding to two different types of serine/threonine kinase receptors, type I and type II. However, binding abilities appear to be different among the members of the BMP family. BMP-4 binds to two different type I receptors, BMP receptors type IA (BMPR-IA) and type IB (BMPR-IB), and a type II receptor, BMP receptor type II (BMPR-II). In addition to these receptors, osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1, also known as BMP-7) binds to activin type I receptor (ActR-I) as well as activin type II receptors (ActR-II and ActR-IIB). Here we investigate the binding and signaling properties of GDF-5 through type I and type II receptors. GDF-5 induced alkaline phosphatase activity in a rat osteoprogenitor-like cell line, ROB-C26. 125I-GDF-5 bound to BMPR-IB and BMPR-II but not to BMPR-IA in ROB-C26 cells and other nontransfected cell lines. Analysis using COS-1 cells transfected with the receptor cDNAs revealed that GDF-5 bound to BMPR-IB but not to the other type I receptors when expressed alone. When COS-1 cells were transfected with type II receptor cDNAs, GDF-5 bound to ActR-II, ActR-IIB, and BMPR-II but not to transforming growth factor-β type II receptor. In the presence of type II receptors, GDF-5 bound to different sets of type I receptors, but the binding was most efficient to BMPR-IB compared with the other type I receptors. Moreover, a transcriptional activation signal was efficiently transduced by BMPR-IB in the presence of BMPR-II or ActR-II after stimulation by GDF-5. These results suggest that BMPR-IB mediates certain signals for GDF-5 after forming the heteromeric complex with BMPR-II or ActR-II.

Several proteins belong to the BMP family, which can be divided into three subgroups based on their structural similarities; i.e. Drosophila decapentaplegic gene product (DPP), BMP-2 and BMP-4 form one subgroup; Drosophila 60A, BMP-5, BMP-6/Vgr1, osteogenic protein (OP)-1/BMP-7, and OP-2/BMP-8 form one subgroup; and GDF-5, −6, and −7 form another subgroup (4Kingsley D.M.

BMPs were originally identified as proteins that induce ectopic bone and cartilage formation in vivo (7Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Celeste A.J. Mitsock L.M. Whitters M.J. Kriz R.W. Hewick R.M. Wang E.A.

In vitro studies have revealed that BMPs have various biological effects on different cell types, e.g. stimulation of proteoglycan synthesis in chondroblasts (9Vukicevic S. Luyten F.P. Reddi A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8793-8797Google Scholar), synthesis of collagen and alkaline phosphatase during chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation (9Vukicevic S. Luyten F.P.

GDF-5 also stimulates chondrogenic phenotype expression in vitro and induces cartilage and bone formation in vivo (14Hötten G.C. Matsumoto T. Kimura M. Bechtold R.F. Kron R. Ohara T. Tanaka H. Satoh Y. Okazaki M. Shirai T. Pan H. Kawai S. Pohl J.S. Kudo A. Growth Factors. 1996; 13: 65-74Google Scholar). BMPs are widely distributed not only in bone and cartilage but in other tissues; e.g. BMP-3, −4, −5, and −6 are found in lung and liver, and OP-1/BMP-7 is expressed in kidney (15Özkaynak E. Schnegelsberg P.N.J. Jin D.F. Clifford G.M. Warren F.D. Drier E.A. Oppermann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25220-25227Google Scholar). BMPs play important roles in the embryonal development. Null mutation in the BMP-4 gene leads to defects in mesoderm formation during the early embryonic stage (16Winnier G. Blessing M. Labosky P.A. Hogan B.L.M. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 2105-2116Google Scholar). OP-1/BMP-7-deficient mice die shortly after birth because of poor kidney development and have eye defects and skeletal abnormalities (17Dudley A.T. Lyons K.M. Robertson E.J. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 2795-2807Google Scholar, 18Luo G. Hofmann C. Bronckers A.L.J.J. Sohocki M. Bradley A. Karsenty G. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 2808-2820Google Scholar). GDF-5/CDMP-1 is predominantly expressed in the precartilaginous mesenchymal condensation and the cartilaginous cores of the developing long bone (1Storm E.E. Huynh T.V. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Kingsley D.M. Lee S.-J. Nature. 1994; 368: 639-643Google Scholar, 3Chang S.C. Hoang B. Thomas J.T. Vukicevic S. Luyten F.P. Ryba N.J.P. Kozak C.A. Reddi A.H. Moos Jr., M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28227-28234Google Scholar). Mutations in the murine GDF-5 gene result in abnormal skeletal development, known as brachypodism (1Storm E.E. Huynh T.V. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Kingsley D.M. Lee S.-J. Nature. 1994; 368: 639-643Google Scholar). In a recent study, a mutation in the human GDF-5 gene was shown to be associated with a recessive human chondrodysplasia (Hunter-Thompson type) (19Thomas J.T. Lin K. Nandedkar M. Camargo M. Cervenka J. Luyten F.P. Nature Genet. 1996; 12: 315-317Google Scholar). The resulting phenotype of this disorder is similar to murine brachypodism. Members of the TGF-β superfamily transduce their signals through the formation of heteromeric complexes of two different types of serine/threonine kinase receptors, i.e. type I receptors of about 50-55 kDa and type II receptors of more than 70 kDa (20Massagué J.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 548-553Google Scholar). A series of receptor serine/threonine kinases, termed activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)-1 to −6, was previously identified to constitute a type I receptor family, including a TGF-β type I receptor (TβR-I/ALK-5), two activin type I receptors (ActR-I/ALK-2 and ActR-IB/ALK-4), and two BMP type I receptors (BMPR-IA/ALK-3 and BMPR-IB/ALK-6) (23Ebner R.

In the TGF-β and activin receptor systems, ligand binds first to its specific type II receptor, and the complex of ligand and type II receptor is then recognized by type I receptor. Upon formation of the heteromeric receptor complex, type I receptor is phosphorylated by type II receptor, and subsequent activation of the catalytic activity of type I receptor kinase is essential for signaling (38Wrana J.L.

Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Albert P.S. Massagué J. Riddle D.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 644-649Google Scholar), whereas OP-1/BMP-7 binds to BMPR-IB and less efficiently to BMPR-IA (27ten Dijke P. Yamashita H. Sampath T.K. Reddi A.H. Estevez M. Riddle D.L. Ichijo H. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16985-16988Google Scholar). OP-1/BMP-7, but not BMP-4, can also bind to one of the activin type I receptors, ActR-I, in the presence of DAF-4 (27ten Dijke P. Yamashita H. Sampath T.K. Reddi A.H. Estevez M. Riddle D.L. Ichijo H. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16985-16988Google Scholar). In addition, OP-1/BMP-7 was recently shown to bind ActR-II and ActR-IIB and mediate certain activin-like effects through the ActR-II·ActR-I complex (43Yamashita H. ten Dijke P. Huylebroeck D. Sampath T.K. Andries M. Smith J.C. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 217-226Google Scholar). We have recently shown that ALK-1 (also termed TGF-β superfamily receptor type I or R3) mediates certain signals after stimulation by OP-1/BMP-7. 2H. Nishitoh, M. Saitoh, I. Asahina, S. Enomoto, T. K. Sampath, M. Takagi, and H. Ichijo, submitted for publication. Human BMPR-II was recently cloned, and it was shown that BMP-2, BMP-4, and OP-1/BMP-7 bound to BMPR-II and transduced signals in combination with certain type I receptors after forming heteromeric complexes (35Liu F. Ventura F. Doody J. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3479-3486Google Scholar, 36Rosenzweig B.L. Imamura T. Okadome T. Cox G.N. Yamashita H. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. Proc. Natl.

In contrast to the TGF-β and activin receptors, BMP type I and type II receptors bind ligands independently, but binding affinity is up-regulated in the presence of both receptor types. The ligand-receptor interactions of BMPs in mammals are remarkably similar to those observed with the DPP receptor system in Drosophila (44Ruberte E. Marty T. Nellen D. Affolter M. Basler K. Cell. 1995; 80: 889-897Google Scholar, 45Letsou A. Arora K. Wrana J.L. Simin K. Twombly V. Jamal J. Staehling-Hampton K. Hoffmann F.M. Gelbart W.M. Massagué J. O'Connor M.B. Cell. 1995; 80: 899-908Google Scholar). However, the precise signaling mechanism of the BMP/DPP receptor systems remains unknown. We investigated the biological effect of GDF-5 on osteoprogenitor-like cell lines and identified type I and type II receptors for GDF-5; BMPR-IB and BMPR-II, but not BMPR-IA, bound GDF-5 in ROB-C26 cells and other cell types. Moreover, we show here that GDF-5 transduces its signal through heteromeric complexes of BMPR-IB and various type II receptors. Mink lung epithelial cells (Mv1Lu) and COS-1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Chemically mutagenized Mv1Lu cell line (R mutant, clone 4-2) (46Laiho M.

The other cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS and antibiotics in 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C. For a histochemical analysis of ALP activity, cells were fixed for 10 min with 3.7% formaldehyde at room temperature. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated for 20 min with a mixture of 0.1 mg/ml of naphthol AS-MX phosphate (Sigma), 0.5% N,N-dimethylformamide, 2 m MgCl2, and 0.6 mg/ml of fast blue BB salt (Sigma) in 0.1 Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, at room temperature. For a quantitative analysis of ALP activity, cells were washed with 20 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 m NaCl and extracted with lysis buffer (20 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 m NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100). ALP activity was determined by an established technique using p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) as a substrate (48Asahina I. Sampath T.K. Nishimura I. Hauschka P.V. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 921-933Google Scholar). Protein concentration in each extract was measured by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Antisera to the type I receptors were made against synthetic peptides corresponding to the intracellular juxtamembrane parts of the type I receptors (26ten Dijke P. Yamashita H. Ichijo H. Franzén P.

Cells were incubated on ice for 2-3 h with 0.2-0.5 n of 125I-labeled ligands in the presence or absence of unlabeled ligands in a binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.9 m CaCl2, 0.49 m MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). After incubation, the cells were washed with the binding buffer without bovine serum albumin, and cross-linking was done in the same buffer containing 0.27 m of disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) and 1 m of bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (Pierce) for 15 min on ice. The cells were washed once with a buffer containing 10 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 m EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.3 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and lysed for 20 min in lysis buffer (20 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 m NaCl, 10 m EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate) containing 1.5% Trasylol (Bayer) and 1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and clarified by centrifugation. Cross-linked materials were then incubated with antisera for 45 min at 4°C. Immune complexes were bound to protein A-Sepharose (Kabi-Pharmacia) for 30 min at 4°C, washed once with a buffer containing 20 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, followed by one wash in distilled water. For isolation of BMPR-IIHis complexes, cells were extracted with a buffer containing 50 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation and incubated with Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4°C in the presence of 20 m imidazole. Beads were rinsed briefly once with the same buffer. The immune complexes or complexes isolated by Ni2+-NTA-agarose were eluted by boiling for 3 min in SDS sample buffer (100 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 36% glycerol, 4% SDS) containing 10 m dithiothreitol and analyzed by SDS-7% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were fixed, dried, and subjected to the analysis using a Fuji BAS 2000 Bio-Imaging Analyzer (Fuji Photo Film). R mutant Mv1Lu cells were co-transfected with p3TP-Lux promoter-reporter construct (25Attisano L. Cárcamo J. Ventura F. Weis F.M.B. Massagué J. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 671-680Google Scholar, 54Cárcamo J. Zentella A. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1573-1581Google Scholar) with plasmids containing the type I or type II receptor cDNAs as described above. One day after transfection, cells were starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% FBS for 6 h and then exposed to 300 ng/ml of GDF-5 for 24 h. Luciferase activity in the cell lysate was measured using the luciferase assay system (Toyo Ink) according to the manufacturer's protocol and a luminometer (AutoLumat LB953; EG&G Berthold). GDF-5 stimulated mesenchyme aggregation and chondrogenesis in rat limb bud cells in vitro and induced ectopic cartilage and bone formation in mice tissues of rodents in vivo (14Hötten G.C. Matsumoto T. Kimura M. Bechtold R.F. Kron R. Ohara T. Tanaka H. Satoh Y. Okazaki M. Shirai T. Pan H. Kawai S. Pohl J.S. Kudo A. Growth Factors. 1996; 13: 65-74Google Scholar). However, several osteoblastic cell lines, such as MC3T3-E1 cells, did not efficiently respond to GDF-5 as measured by ALP activity in contrast to the effects of other BMPs. To identify the signaling receptors for GDF-5, we first attempted to find cell lines that respond to GDF-5 using the enzyme histochemical study of ALP activity. In ROB-C26 rat osteoprogenitor-like cell line, GDF-5 increased the number of ALP-positive cells at 300 ng/ml (Fig. 1A). However, most cell lines, including MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblastic cells, ROS17/2.8 rat osteosarcoma cells, and C2C12 mouse myoblastic cells, had no significant increase in ALP activity by the treatment with GDF-5 (data not shown). Fig. 1B shows the dose-dependent effect of GDF-5 on ROB-C26 cells treated for 6 days. ALP activity was induced by GDF-5 in a dose-dependent manner. In order to investigate which serine/threonine kinase receptors act as type I and type II receptors for GDF-5, the ROB-C26 cells were tested for the binding of GDF-5. The cells were affinity-labeled using 125I-GDF-5, and the cross-linked complexes were analyzed by immunoprecipitation using the antiserum against each of type I and type II receptors, followed by SDS-gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Cross-linked complexes of 80-90 kDa could be immunoprecipitated by the antiserum to BMPR-IB (Fig. 2A). A high molecular mass complex of 150-200 kDa, which may represent a type II receptor complex, was co-immunoprecipitated by the BMPR-IB antiserum. The type II receptor complex could be immunoprecipitated by the BMPR-II antiserum, and co-immunoprecipitation of the type I receptor complex was also seen (Fig. 2A). Immunoprecipitation by the BMPR-II antiserum was less efficient than that by the BMPR-IB antiserum, which may be due to a poor affinity of the BMPR-II antiserum (36Rosenzweig B.L. Imamura T. Okadome T. Cox G.N. Yamashita H. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7632-7636Google Scholar). Weak bands could be seen after immunoprecipitation by the antisera against ALK-1, BMPR-IA, and TβR-II (Fig. 2A), but these were not reproducible. Binding of 125I-BMP-2 was also tested in the ROB-C26 cells (Fig. 2B). Although 125I-BMP-2 is known to bind BMPR-IA and BMPR-IB as well as BMPR-II in other systems, binding to only BMPR-IB and BMPR-II could be seen in this cell type, suggesting that this cell line predominantly expresses BMPR-IB rather than BMPR-IA. The binding of 125I-GDF-5 and 125I-BMP-2 to BMPR-IB was competed with unlabeled GDF-5 and also with BMP-2 (Fig. 2C). To identify the endogenous receptors for GDF-5 in other cell types, we tested some other cell lines for the binding of GDF-5. In the U1240 MG glioblastoma cell line and the Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cell line, BMPR-IB could bind GDF-5 (Fig. 3). In contrast, 125I-BMP-2-cross-linked complexes to Mv1Lu were immunoprecipitated by BMPR-IA (data not shown). In most cell types investigated, including ATDC5 chondroblastic cells, MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblastic cells, ROS17/2.8 rat osteosarcoma cells, BEC bovine endothelial cells, and C2C12 mouse myoblastic cells, binding of GDF-5 was not clear (data not shown). In order to further investigate the type I and type II receptors for GDF-5, binding was tested using COS-1 cells transfected with the cDNAs for serine/threonine kinase receptors. For the transfection of BMPR-II cDNA, a C-terminally truncated form of BMPR-IIHis, which encodes 530 amino acid residues with a hexahistidine tag in its C terminus and, therefore, forms about 100 kDa of cross-linked complexes (35Liu F. Ventura F. Doody J. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3479-3486Google Scholar), was used. The cross-linked complexes were precipitated using the specific antisera or Ni2+-NTA agarose beads. When singly transfected, we could observe binding of GDF-5 only to BMPR-IB among six type I receptors. Among different type II receptors, ActR-II, ActR-IIB1, and BMPR-IIHis bound GDF-5 (Fig. 4). GDF-5 did not bind well to other serine/threonine kinase receptors, including BMPR-IA, ActR-I (Fig. 4), and DAF-4, a BMP type II receptor in C. elegans (data not shown). When type I receptor cDNAs were co-transfected with the BMPR-IIHis, ActR-II, or ActR-IIB1 cDNA, GDF-5 bound different sets of type I receptors. In the presence of BMPR-IIHis, GDF-5 bound efficiently to BMPR-IB, but not to the other type I receptors (Fig. 5A). BMPR-IB as well as BMPR-II bands could be seen when the cross-linked complexes were immunoprecipitated by the BMPR-IB antiserum. When isolated with Ni2+-NTA agarose beads, co-precipitation of the BMPR-IB complex could also be observed (Fig. 5A). Binding to BMPR-IB was up-regulated in the presence of BMPR-IIHis, compared with its absence (data not shown). In the presence of ActR-II, GDF-5 bound most efficiently to BMPR-IB (Fig. 5B). Weak binding of GDF-5 was also seen to BMPR-IA in the presence of ActR-II (Fig. 5B). In the presence of ActR-IIB1, GDF-5 bound efficiently to BMPR-IB, but also to ActR-I and to BMPR-IA very weakly (Fig. 5C). Thus, the binding of GDF-5 is most efficient to BMPR-IB compared with the other type I receptors, and weak binding to BMPR-IA and ActR-I is observed in the presence of different type II receptors. When COS-1 cells were co-transfected with BMPR-IB and ActR-IIB1 cDNAs, the BMPR-IB complex could not be immunoprecipitated with the type II receptor antiserum (Fig. 5C), suggesting that BMPR-IB forms a heteromeric complex with BMPR-II and ActR-II upon GDF-5 binding but less efficiently with ActR-IIB1. We next investigated whether type I and type II receptors are capable of signaling upon binding GDF-5 using a p3TP-Lux promoter-reporter construct (54Cárcamo J. Zentella A. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1573-1581Google Scholar). R mutant Mv1Lu cells were transfected with type I and/or type II receptors, together with p3TP-Lux, and stimulated or not stimulated by GDF-5. Since transfection of empty pSV7d vector showed no luciferase response to GDF-5 (Fig. 6, first set of bars), these cells were used for the analysis of transfected GDF-5 receptor signaling activity. Cells transfected with ActR-II or BMPR-II alone did not respond to GDF-5 (Fig. 6). Cells transfected with BMPR-IA or BMPR-IB alone showed a very weak response to GDF-5, which may be ascribed to the presence of endogenous activin and BMP type II receptors in the R mutant cells (26ten Dijke P. Yamashita H. Ichijo H. Franzén P. Laiho M. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Science. 1994; 264: 101-104Google Scholar, 36Rosenzweig B.L. Imamura T. Okadome T. Cox G.N. Yamashita H. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7632-7636Google Scholar). When p3TP-Lux was co-transfected with ActR-II and BMPR-IB, transcriptional activation was clearly observed after stimulation by GDF-5 (Fig. 6). BMPR-IA also showed a less but significant increase in luciferase activity in the presense of ActR-II. Similarly, co-transfection of BMPR-II and BMPR-IB mediated transcriptional activation; however, co-transfection of BMPR-II and BMPR-IA did not show significant transcriptional activation (Fig. 6). In the R mutant cells co-transfected with ActR-IIB1 and type I receptors (ActR-I, BMPR-IA, and BMPR-IB), the activation of transcription by GDF-5 was not detected (data not shown). In the present paper, we first tried to find the cell lines that respond to GDF-5 in order to identify the signaling receptors for GDF-5. In contrast to BMP-2, BMP-4, and OP-1/BMP-7, GDF-5 did not efficiently induce the ALP activity in most cell lines, including MC3T3-E1, ROS17/2.8, and C2C12 cells. Only the osteoprogenitor-like cell line, ROB-C26, could respond to GDF-5 (Fig. 1, A and B). These data suggested to us that the bioactivity of GDF-5 can be observed in limited cell types, and the receptor-binding profile of GDF-5 may be different from those of other BMPs. We then investigated the receptors in the ROB-C26 cells using antibodies against known serine/threonine kinase receptors. Interestingly, GDF-5 bound to only BMPR-IB and BMPR-II in this cell line but not to the other serine/threonine kinase receptors, including BMPR-IA (Fig. 2A). Since BMP-2 showed a similar binding profile in the ROB-C26 cells (Fig. 2B), this cell line may predominantly express BMPR-IB and BMPR-II compared with the other receptors. Furthermore, the binding of 125I-GDF-5 and 125I-BMP-2 to BMPR-IB was competed by unlabeled GDF-5 or BMP-2 (Fig. 2C), indicating that the binding site to BMPR-IB is shared by these ligands. MC3T3-E1 cells are known to respond to BMP-4 and OP-1/BMP-7. In this cell type, ActR-I and BMPR-IA were shown to bind 125I-OP-1/BMP-7 and 125I-BMP-4, respectively (27ten Dijke P. Yamashita H. Sampath T.K. Reddi A.H. Estevez M. Riddle D.L. Ichijo H. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16985-16988Google Scholar). However, 125I-GDF-5 did not efficiently bind to MC3T3-E1 cells, and we could not detect the cross-linked complexes with 125I-GDF-5 in this cell line using any of the serine/threonine kinase receptor antisera (data not shown). We then investigated the binding of GDF-5 to cell lines of nonskeletal origins. In U-1240 MG glioblastoma cells and Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cells, GDF-5 bound only to BMPR-IB among the six type I receptors (Fig. 3). These cells have previously been shown to endogenously express ActR-I and BMPR-IA (27ten Dijke P. Yamashita H. Sampath T.K. Reddi A.H. Estevez M. Riddle D.L. Ichijo H. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16985-16988Google Scholar), but the cross-linked complexes with 125I-GDF-5 were not immunoprecipitated by the antiserum against ActR-I or BMPR-IA. Moreover, we found that 125I-BMP-2 bound to BMPR-IA as well as BMPR-IB in the Mv1Lu cells (data not shown). Taken together, the binding profile of GDF-5 in nontransfected cells is different from that of BMP-2, BMP-4, or OP-1/BMP-7; i.e. GDF-5 preferentially binds to BMPR-IB but not to ActR-I and BMPR-IA. We next studied the binding of GDF-5 in COS-1 cells transfected with the receptor cDNAs. Similar to BMP-4 and OP-1/BMP-7, BMPR-IB bound GDF-5 without the transfection of type II receptors. However, other type I receptors did not bind GDF-5 in the absence of type II receptors (Fig. 4). Binding of GDF-5 to the type II receptors was similar to that of OP-1/BMP-7; i.e. GDF-5 bound to BMPR-II as well as ActR-II and ActR-IIB1 (Fig. 4). When the type I receptors were co-transfected with the type II receptors, the binding profiles were complicated; GDF-5 formed complexes only with BMPR-IB in the presence of BMPR-II (Fig. 5A), but it formed complexes not only with BMPR-IB but also with BMPR-IA in the presence of ActR-II (Fig. 5B). In the presence of ActR-IIB1, binding of GDF-5 to ActR-I, BMPR-IA, and BMPR-IB could be seen, but BMPR-IB was not likely to form a tight complex with ActR-IIB1, because co-immunoprecipitation of neither ActR-IIB1 by the BMPR-IB antiserum nor BMPR-IB by the ActR-IIB1 antiserum could be observed (Fig. 5C). Analysis of the signaling activity of GDF-5 using the p3TP-Lux construct in the R mutant Mv1Lu cells was in good agreement with the binding data observed in the transfected COS-1 cells. GDF-5 transduced the signal through BMPR-IB together with BMPR-II or ActR-II (Fig. 6). The complex of BMPR-IA and ActR-II mediated a less efficient signal than those containing BMPR-IB. GDF-5 did not transduce the p3TP-Lux signal through ActR-IIB1 and the type I receptors (data not shown). In contrast, activin was shown to activate the p3TP-Lux signal through ActR-IIB and ActR-I (25Attisano L. Cárcamo J. Ventura F. Weis F.M.B. Massagué J. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 671-680Google Scholar). These results in the nontransfected and transfected cells indicate that BMPR-IB and BMPR-II can act as functional type I and type II receptors for GDF-5, respectively. ActR-II may also possibly serve as a type II receptor for GDF-5 in certain cell types. Cartilage and bone formation could be induced by GDF-5 in rodent thigh in vivo (14Hötten G.C. Matsumoto T. Kimura M. Bechtold R.F. Kron R. Ohara T. Tanaka H. Satoh Y. Okazaki M. Shirai T. Pan H. Kawai S. Pohl J.S. Kudo A. Growth Factors. 1996; 13: 65-74Google Scholar). Moreover, osteoblasts in primary culture were shown to respond to GDF-5, increasing ALP activity (14Hötten G.C. Matsumoto T. Kimura M. Bechtold R.F. Kron R. Ohara T. Tanaka H. Satoh Y. Okazaki M. Shirai T. Pan H. Kawai S. Pohl J.S. Kudo A.

BMPR-IB is expressed in the process of bone formation during embryogenesis and after bone fracture, although the expression profile appears to be limited compared with that of BMPR-IA (55Dewulf N.

These data suggest that the bone and cartilage formation by GDF-5 observed in vivo is induced through BMPR-IB. Binding of GDF-5 was observed in U-1240 MG glioblastoma cells and Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cells. In addition to bone and cartilage, BMPR-IB and BMPR-II are expressed in various soft tissues during embryogenesis (36Rosenzweig B.L. Imamura T. Okadome T. Cox G.N. Yamashita H. ten Dijke P.

Vukicevic S. Luyten F.P. Ryba N.J.P. Kozak C.A. Reddi A.H. Moos Jr., M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28227-28234Google Scholar) showed that although GDF-5 (CDMP-1) is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscles, GDF-6 (CDMP-2) is found in various soft tissues. Thus, GDF-5 or other highly related proteins may have broad physiological functions in different tissues. Compatible with the limited expression of GDF-5, the mutations in the GDF-5 gene result in the abnormalities only in skeletal tissues in both mouse and human (1Storm E.E. Huynh T.V. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Kingsley D.M. Lee S.-J. Nature. 1994; 368: 639-643Google Scholar, 19Thomas J.T. Lin K. Nandedkar M. Camargo M. Cervenka J. Luyten F.P. Nature Genet. 1996; 12: 315-317Google Scholar). The other GDF-5-like proteins, including GDF-6 and GDF-7, may play important roles in nonskeletal tissues. Among the TGF-β superfamily, BMPs are classified by their ability to form bone and cartilage in vivo. However, BMPs include heterogenous members, and they can be subdivided into subgroups based on their amino acid sequence similarities. Moreover, the biological activities appear to be different among the members in the BMP family. Present data showed that binding profiles of GDF-5 are more limited than those of BMP-2, BMP-4, and OP-1/BMP-7, which suggests different biological functions of GDF-5 both in vitro and in vivo. Future studies including the comparison of the receptor binding properties of the other members in the BMP family, will be needed to understand the in vivo functions of various members of the BMP family.

Here we describe an efficient signal sequence trap method and isolation of a novel CC chemokine. An expression library was constructed by inserting 5′ portion-enriched cDNAs from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells into upstream of signal sequence-deleted CD4 cDNA in an Epstein-Barr virus shuttle vector. After electroporation into Raji cells, CD4 antigen-positive cells were enriched by repeated cell sorting and plasmids were recovered in <i>Escherichia coli.</i> Out of 100 plasmid clones examined, 42 clones directed expression of CD4 antigen on the cell surface. Among them were signal sequences of CD6, β<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin, MGC-24, and T cell receptor ϵ-chain, and at least four novel potential signal sequences. A cDNA clone encoding a novel CC chemokine was isolated by using one of the trapped fragments. The gene designated as TARC from Thymus and Activation-Regulated Chemokine was expressed transiently in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and constitutively in thymus. Radiolabeled recombinant TARC specifically bound to T cell lines and peripheral T cells but not to monocytes or granulocytes. The binding of radiolabeled TARC to the high-affinity receptor (<i>K<sub>d</sub></i>, 2.1 n) on Jurkat was displaced by TARC but not by interleukin-8, MIP-1α, RANTES, or MCP-1. TARC also bound to the promiscuous chemokine receptor on erythrocytes (<i>K<sub>d</sub></i>, 17 n). TARC induced chemotaxis in T cell lines Hut78 and Hut102. Pretreatment of Hut78 with pertussis toxin abolished the TARC-induced cell migration. Collectively, T cells express a highly selective receptor for TARC that is coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein. TARC may a factor playing important roles in T cell development in thymus as well as in trafficking and activation of mature T cells."

Here, we purified and characterized 6B4 proteoglycan-binding proteins from rat brain. From the CHAPS (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid) extract of brain microsomal fractions, 18-, 28-, and 40-kDa proteins were specifically isolated using 6B4 proteoglycan-Sepharose. N-terminal amino acid sequencing identified the 18-kDa protein as pleiotrophin/heparin-binding growth-associated molecule (HB-GAM). Scatchard analysis of 6B4 proteoglycan-pleiotrophin binding revealed low (Kd = 3 n) and high (Kd = 0.25 n) affinity binding sites. Chondroitinase ABC digestion of the proteoglycan decreased the binding affinities to a single value (Kd = 13 n) without changing the number of binding sites. This suggested the presence of two subpopulations of the proteoglycan with different chondroitin sulfate structures. Heparin potently inhibited binding of 6B4 proteoglycan to pleiotrophin (IC50 = 3.5 ng/ml). Heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate C inhibited moderately (IC50 = 150 and 400 ng/ml, respectively), but, in contrast, chondroitin sulfate A and keratan sulfate were poor inhibitors (IC50 > 100 µg/ml). Immunofluorescence and immunoblotting analyses indicated that both 6B4 proteoglycan and PTPζ are located on cortical neurons. Anti-6B4 proteoglycan antibody added to the culture medium suppressed pleiotrophin-induced neurite outgrowth of cortical neurons.

Cloning the cDNA for 6B4 proteoglycan revealed that it is an extracellular variant of a receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase, PTPζ/RPTPβ (3Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Shintani T. Nishiwaki T. Noda M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 67-70Google Scholar, 4Maurel P. Rauch U. Flad M. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2512-2516Google Scholar). We then demonstrated that PTPζ is also present in the form of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan with a 380-kDa core glycoprotein in the rat brain (3Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Shintani T. Nishiwaki T. Noda M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 67-70Google Scholar). The 6B4 proteoglycan is composed of an N-terminal carbonic anhydrase (CAH)-like domain, a fibronectin type III domain, and a C-terminal serine, glycine-rich domain that is thought to be the chondroitin sulfate attachment region (3Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Shintani T. Nishiwaki T. Noda M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 67-70Google Scholar, 4Maurel P. Rauch U. Flad M. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2512-2516Google Scholar). In PTPζ, the serine, glycine-rich domain is followed by a membrane-spanning region and two tyrosine phosphatase domains (5Krueger N.X. Saito H. Proc. Natl.

PTPζ and 6B4 proteoglycan are widely distributed in the developing nervous system and may play roles in neuronal cell migration, neurite extension, axonal outgrowth, and development of the cerebellar mossy fiber system (1Maeda N. Matsui F. Oohira A. Dev. Biol. 1992; 151: 564-574Google Scholar, 2Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Oohira A. Noda M. Neuroscience. 1995; 67: 23-35Google Scholar, 7Cannoll P.D. Barnea G. Levy J.B. Sap J.

We demonstrated that 6B4 proteoglycan is a repulsive substrate for cell adhesion but promotes neurite extension and differentiation of cortical neurons (11Maeda N. Noda M. Development. 1996; 122: 647-658Google Scholar). These results suggest that 6B4 proteoglycan as well as PTPζ participate in various aspects of brain development by regulating the tyrosine phosphorylation level of intracellular proteins. However, little is known about the signal transduction system coupled extracellularly or intracellularly with these proteoglycan molecules. phosphate-buffered saline protein-tyrosine phosphatase carbonic anhydrase heparin-binding growth-associated molecule bovine serum albumin 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Screening various extracellular matrix and cell adhesion molecules revealed that N-CAM, Ng-CAM, and tenascin bind to phosphacan (8Milev P. Friedlander D.R. Sakurai T. Karthikeyan L. Flad M.

Contactin was recently identified as PTPζ/RPTPβ-binding protein by screening an expression cDNA library using the CAH domain as probe (12Peles E. Nativ M. Campbell P.L. Sakurai T. Martinez R. Lev S.

These studies indicated that 6B4 proteoglycan and PTPζ bind various extracellular and cell surface molecules. At present, however, the specific ligands that regulate the phosphatase activity of PTPζ upon their binding are unknown. In this study, we investigate ligands that bind to 6B4 proteoglycan and PTPζ by means of affinity chromatography using a matrix coupled with intact or chondroitinase ABC-digested 6B4 proteoglycan. Several proteins bound to 6B4 proteoglycan-Sepharose dependently on or independently of chondroitin sulfate moiety. An 18-kDa protein, which bound to 6B4 proteoglycan-Sepharose independently of chondroitin sulfate, was identified as pleiotrophin. Pleiotrophin (13Li Y.-S. Milner P.G. Chauhan A.K.

Kovesdi I. Growth Factors. 1991; 5: 99-114Google Scholar), is a mitogenic and neurite-promoting factor isolated from the brain. Pleiotrophin shows 50% homology to midkine, and they are considered to constitute a new growth factor gene family (16Kadomatsu K. Tomomura M. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 1312-1328Google Scholar). Syndecan-3/N-syndecan binds pleiotrophin (17Raulo E. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. Nolo R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12999-13004Google Scholar), but the signal-transducing receptor for this factor is unknown. In this study, we examine the function of 6B4 proteoglycan and PTPζ as a possible receptor of pleiotrophin. Human recombinant pleiotrophin was purchased from R&D systems. Recombinant human aFGF was from Intergen. Tenascin purified from human glioma cell line u-251MG was from Chemicon International Inc. Fibronectin was purchased from Nitta Gelatin.

Heparin, poly—lysine, and rabbit IgG were obtained from Sigma. CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B, Protein G Sepharose 4FF, and HiTrap Protein G were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. A mixture of monoclonal antibodies to phosphorylated neurofilament, SMI 312, was obtained from Sternberger Monoclonals Inc. Texas Red Avidin D and Vectastain ABC kit were obtained from Vector Labs.

Ponceau S was purchased from Aldrich. The Chroma Spin column was obtained from Clontech. Immunoplate Maxisorp was purchased from Nunc. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, F12 medium, and B-27 supplement were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Postnatal 16-day-old (P16) Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized and killed by decapitation, then the whole brains were dissected. 16 g of tissues were mixed with 5 volumes of a solution containing 0.32 sucrose, 5 m EDTA, 0.1 m PMSF, 10 µ pepstatin A, 10 µ leupeptin, and 50 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and homogenized in a glass-Teflon Potter homogenizer with 10 strokes at 850 rpm. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 2°C, and the precipitate was washed again under the same conditions. The combined supernatants were centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 60 min at 2°C to precipitate the P2+P3 fraction. This fraction was resuspended in 40 ml of a solution containing 0.2 NaCl, 1 m EDTA, 10 µ pepstatin A, 10 µ leupeptin, and 10 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After adding 4.4 ml of 10% CHAPS, the solution was stirred overnight at 0°C. The sample was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 60 min at 2°C, and the supernatant was applied to affinity chromatography. We purified 6B4 proteoglycan from 20-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat whole brains under dissociative conditions as described (2Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Oohira A. Noda M. Neuroscience. 1995; 67: 23-35Google Scholar). This preparation was estimated to be more than 97% pure based on SDS-PAGE. Chondroitinase ABC digestion of 6B4 proteoglycan proceeded as follows. The purified proteoglycan was dialyzed against 200 ml of 50 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 m EDTA and 30 m sodium acetate, then incubated for 1 h at 37°C in the presence of 50 milliunits of protease-free chondroitinase ABC. 2.5 ml of 150 µg/ml (as protein) intact or chondroitinase ABC-digested 6B4 proteoglycan was dialyzed three times against 0.5 NaCl, 0.1 NaHCO3 at 4°C. The proteoglycan was coupled to 1 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's protocol. A mixture of 50 µl of 1 MgCl2 and CaCl2 and 10 ml of the CHAPS extract was added to 0.5 ml of 6B4 proteoglycan-Sepharose in a 15-ml centrifuge tube. After rotating overnight at 4°C, the treated gel was poured into a small column and washed with 5 ml of 0.2% CHAPS, 0.2 NaCl, 10 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, followed by 5 ml of 10 m EDTA, 0.2% CHAPS, 0.2 NaCl, 10 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The bound proteins were then eluted with 5 ml of 1 NaCl, 0.2% CHAPS, 10 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The eluted 6B4 proteoglycan-binding proteins (∼3 µg) were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane according to the method of Towbin et al. (19Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar). The proteins were stained for 3 min with 0.5% Ponceau S in 1% acetic acid and then destained with 1% acetic acid. Protein bands were excised with a razor blade, and the amino acid sequences were determined using an Applied Biosystems sequencer 492. We dialyzed 6B4 proteoglycan (7 µg in 70 µl) against 100 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0 and then applied the dialyzate to dried [125I]Bolton-Hunter reagent (100 µCi). The reaction mixture was incubated for 3 h on ice, and then 30 µl of 1 glycine, pH 7.5, was added. After a 2-h incubation at 4°C, free [125I]Bolton-Hunter reagent was removed by passing through a Chroma Spin 30 column equilibrated with 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.15 NaCl, 10 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2. The specific radioactivity was 2.0 × 106 cpm/µg. Wells of Nunc Maxisorp Immunoplates were coated with 2∼5 µg/ml of proteins in 35 µl of 5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 4°C overnight. The wells were washed three times with PBS and then blocked with 1% BSA/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. We diluted 125I-6B4 proteoglycan in 0.5% BSA, 2 m CaCl2, 2 m MgCl2, 0.1% CHAPS, 0.15 NaCl, 10 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, and then added 125I-6B4 proteoglycan (15,000 cpm/35 µl for the usual assay and 2,000∼80,000 cpm/35 µl for Scatchard analyses) to the coated wells and incubated the plates for 5 h at room temperature. The wells were washed three times with 2 m CaCl2, 2 m MgCl2, 0.15 NaCl, 10 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. The bound materials were released by adding 200 µl of 0.1 NaOH, 0.2% SDS to the wells. The plate was shaken for 15 min at room temperature, and then the eluted radioactivity was measured using a gamma counter. We digested 125I-6B4 proteoglycan with glycanases as follows. First, we diluted 125I-6B4 proteoglycan with 0.5% BSA, 2 m CaCl2, 2 m MgCl2, 0.15 NaCl, 10 m sodium acetate, 10 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 0.2 µg/ml. Various concentrations of protease-free chondroitinase ABC and heparitinases I and II were then added to the samples, and the solutions were incubated for 1 h at 30°C for use in binding assays. Cerebra were dissected from embryonic 16- (E16) or 17-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats, and the meninges were removed. The tissues were incubated in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (CMF-HBSS) containing 0.1% trypsin for 15 min at 37°C. After three washes with CMF-HBSS, the tissues were triturated with Pasteur pipettes in CMF-HBSS containing 0.025% DNase I, 0.4 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 3 mg/ml BSA, and 12 m MgSO4. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 160 × g for 5 min at 4°C, and the pelleted cells were washed once with CMF-HBSS. Cells were resuspended in culture medium consisting of a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and F12 medium (DF medium) containing 2% B-27 supplement (DF/B-27 medium) and were seeded as described below. Glass coverslips (13 mm in diameter) were incubated in 0.002% poly—lysine, washed five times with distilled water, and then air dried. Cells (40 µl of a 1 × 105 cells/ml suspension) were plated on coverslips in 24-well plates. After a 1-h incubation at 37°C under 5% CO2, 0.5 ml per well of DF/B-27 medium was added. The cells were cultured overnight and processed for immunocytochemistry as described below. For the neurite extension assay, wells of Nunc Maxisorp Immunoplates were coated overnight with 2 µg/ml pleiotrophin or 2 µg/ml poly—lysine at 4°C. The wells were washed three times with distilled water and then blocked with 0.25% BSA for 2 h at 37°C. The solutions were removed, and then 40 µl of DF/B-27 medium containing antibodies at various concentrations were added to the wells followed by 1.5 × 104 cortical neurons (10 µl in the medium) per well. Phase-contrast micrographs were taken after a 50-h incubation, and neurite length distribution was analyzed as described (11Maeda N. Noda M. Development. 1996; 122: 647-658Google Scholar). Cultures were washed once with PBS and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, for 15 min. Fixed cells were rinsed three times with Tris-buffered saline, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 30 min, then blocked with 2% BSA, 4% goat serum in PBS. Cells were then incubated for 2 h with the mixture of anti-phosphorylated neurofilament antibodies, SMI 312 (1/500), and anti-6B4 proteoglycan antiserum (1/500). After three washes with PBS, the cells were incubated for 30 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1/100) and biotinylated anti-rabbit Ig (1/200), followed by three washes with PBS, and then incubated once more for 30 min with Texas Red Avidin D (1/1000). The cells were washed three times with PBS, mounted, and observed using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. All solutions were diluted with PBS containing 0.05% BSA. Incubations were at room temperature. Cortical neurons (107 cells) in DF/B-27 medium were plated on 6-cm culture plates coated with poly—lysine as described above. After 3 days of culture under 5% CO2 at 37°C, the cells were extracted for 2 h at 4°C with 1.5 ml of 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 m PMSF, 10 µ pepstatin A, 10 µ leupeptin, 1 m EDTA, 50 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (buffer A). After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min, 500-µl aliquots of the supernatant were adsorbed for 1 h at 4°C with 25 µl of Protein G Sepharose 4FF. After a brief centrifugation, 1 µg of anti-6B4 proteoglycan antibody (3Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Shintani T. Nishiwaki T. Noda M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 67-70Google Scholar) or control rabbit IgG was added to the supernatants and incubated for 1 h at 4°C. Thereafter, 25 µl of Protein G Sepharose 4FF was added to the solution, and the tubes were rotated for 1 h at 4°C. The gels were washed three times with 0.5 ml of buffer A and then mixed with the same volume of 5 m EDTA, 1 m PMSF, 0.1 m pepstatin A, 60 m sodium acetate, 0.2 Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Protease-free chondroitinase ABC (5 milliunits) was added to the samples, which were then incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The samples were mixed with 16 µl of 4-fold concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The samples were applied to 5% SDS-PAGE and processed for immunoblotting as described (2Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Oohira A. Noda M. Neuroscience. 1995; 67: 23-35Google Scholar). IgG fraction from anti-6B4 proteoglycan antibody (3Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Shintani T. Nishiwaki T. Noda M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 67-70Google Scholar) was prepared with HiTrap Protein G according to the supplier's protocol. The protein concentration was determined using a MicroBCA kit with BSA as the standard. To purify 6B4 proteoglycan-binding proteins, the CHAPS extracts of the P2+P3 fraction from P16 rat whole brain were mixed with 6B4 proteoglycan-Sepharose in the presence or absence of calcium and magnesium ions. The mixture was rotated overnight and then poured into a column. After washing the column with a buffer containing 0.2 NaCl, the bound proteins were eluted with 10 m EDTA and then with 1 NaCl (Fig. 1). Several proteins that eluted with EDTA seemed to be aggregated in the presence of divalent cations because similar proteins were also eluted with EDTA from a control Sepharose CL-4B column (data not shown). Three major proteins (18-, 28-, and 40-kDa proteins) were eluted with 1 NaCl from the 6B4 proteoglycan-Sepharose column but not from Sepharose CL-4B. Divalent cations (5 m each) were not essential, but in their absence, these proteins did not bind efficiently to the column. Next, chondroitinase ABC-digested 6B4 proteoglycan was coupled to a Sepharose gel for affinity chromatography and tested as described above. Under these conditions, 40- and 28-kDa proteins flowed through the column, and only the 18-kDa protein was eluted with 1 NaCl, suggesting that the two former proteins are chondroitin sulfate-binding proteins (data not shown). Gas phase amino acid sequencing indicated that the N-terminals of the 28- and 40-kDa proteins were blocked, since the N-terminal amino acid was undetectable. Amino acid sequences obtained from the CNBr-digested samples could not be found in the sequence of proteins that have been reported to date (data not shown). On the other hand, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 18-kDa protein obtained was GKKEKPEKKVKKSDXGEXQXSVXVPT, which faithfully corresponded to that of pleiotrophin except for the four X positions (13Li Y.-S. Milner P.G. Chauhan A.K. Watson M.A. Hoffman R.M. Kodner C.M. Milbrandt J. Deuel T.F. Science. 1990; 250: 1690-1694Google Scholar). The results of the affinity chromatography suggested that pleiotrophin specifically binds to 6B4 proteoglycan. We therefore measured the binding of 125I-6B4 proteoglycan using ELISA plates coated with various proteins. Among these, pleiotrophin and tenascin significantly bound to 6B4 proteoglycan, whereas aFGF, fibronectin, and laminin did not (Fig. 2A). Tenascin reportedly binds phosphacan (8Milev P. Friedlander D.R. Sakurai T. Karthikeyan L. Flad M. Margolis R.K. Grumet M. Margolis R.U. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1703-1715Google Scholar). The binding of 125I-6B4 proteoglycan to pleiotrophin was dependent on the concentration of the proteoglycan, and the nonspecific binding was negligibly low (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that 6B4 proteoglycan bound to pleiotrophin. Pleiotrophin is a heparin-binding protein that binds to the heparan sulfate chains of syndecan (17Raulo E. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. Nolo R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12999-13004Google Scholar, 20Mitsiadis T.A. Salmivirta M. Muramatsu T. Muramatsu H. Rauvala H. Lehtonen E. Jalkanen M. Theslaff I. Development. 1995; 121: 37-51Google Scholar). The 6B4 proteoglycan preparation did not contain any detectable amount of heparan sulfate proteoglycan. It was also confirmed that the preparation did not contain N-syndecan by immunoblotting analysis using anti-N-syndecan monoclonal antibody H5 (18Watanabe E. Matsui F. Keino H. Ono K. Kushima Y. Noda M. Oohira A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 44: 84-96Google Scholar) (data not shown). Next, we analyzed the effects of various glycosaminoglycans on 6B4 proteoglycan-pleiotrophin binding. As shown in Fig. 3, heparin potently inhibited the binding of 6B4 proteoglycan to pleiotrophin (IC50 = 3.5 ng/ml), and heparan sulfate moderately suppressed the binding (IC50 = 150 ng/ml). Chondroitin sulfate C also had a moderate effect (IC50 = 400 ng/ml), but in contrast, chondroitin sulfate A scarcely influenced the 6B4 proteoglycan-pleiotrophin binding (IC50 > 100 µg/ml). However, chondroitinase ABC digests of chondroitin sulfate A and C (unsaturated disaccharides) had no effect on the binding. The roles of chondroitin sulfate chains in the 6B4 proteoglycan-pleiotrophin interaction were tested by digesting 125I-6B4 proteoglycan with various concentrations of chondroitinase ABC, and then we assayed the binding (Fig. 4A). Digestion with increasing amounts of enzyme reduced the binding to about 60% of the control. Additional heparitinase digestion did not affect the binding (Fig. 4A, open square), which was consistent with the finding that 6B4 proteoglycan does not contain heparan sulfate (2Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Oohira A. Noda M. Neuroscience. 1995; 67: 23-35Google Scholar). Scatchard analysis of the binding of native 6B4 proteoglycan to pleiotrophin indicated that there are low (Kd = 3.0 n) and high (Kd = 0.25 n) affinity binding sites (Fig. 4, B and C). We then performed a binding assay using the chondroitinase ABC-digested 125I-6B4 proteoglycan (Fig. 4B). Scatchard analysis indicated that chondroitinase ABC digestion of the 6B4 proteoglycan reduced the affinity of both sites (Kd = 13 n) without changing the number of binding sites (Fig. 4C). Dissociated cortical neurons from E16 rats were doubly stained with anti-6B4 proteoglycan antibody (anti-6B4 PG) and anti-phosphorylated neurofilament monoclonal antibody (anti-P-NF). As shown in Fig. 5, P-NF-positive neurons were stained with anti-6B4 PG. The cell bodies and a portion of neurites showed strong immunoreactivity to anti-6B4 PG. It is notable that the rims of the growth cones and the filopodial processes were 6B4 proteoglycan-positive. A polyclonal antibody against the C-terminal portion of 6B4 proteoglycan (anti-31-5) (3Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Shintani T. Nishiwaki T. Noda M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 67-70Google Scholar) gave similar results. Immunoprecipitates with anti-6B4 PG were prepared from extracts of cultured cortical neurons and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-6B4 PG (Fig. 6). Two core protein bands of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (300 and 380 kDa) were detected after chondroitinase ABC digestion. Judging from the molecular weight and enzyme activity, the former was 6B4 proteoglycan and the latter was PTPζ (3Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Shintani T. Nishiwaki T. Noda M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 67-70Google Scholar). There were two additional minor bands of 230 and 260 kDa, which were not sensitive to chondroitinase ABC digestion. These proteins are probably the precursor form of the proteoglycans in the cells, which are not yet glycosylated with chondroitin sulfate, or dvPTPζ, which is another splicing variant of PTPζ (6Levy J.B. Canoll P.D. Silvennoinen O. Barnea G. Morse B. Honegger A.M. Huang J.-T. Cannizzaro L.A. Park S.-H. Druck T. Huebner K. Sap J. Ehrlich M. Musacchio J.M. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10573-10581Google Scholar). Because this culture was estimated to be 98% pure neurons (11Maeda N. Noda M. Development. 1996; 122: 647-658Google Scholar), these results suggest that cortical neurons synthesize both 6B4 proteoglycan and PTPζ. Pleiotrophin stimulates neurite outgrowth (13Li Y.-S. Milner P.G. Chauhan A.K. Watson M.A. Hoffman R.M. Kodner C.M. Milbrandt J. Deuel T.F. Science. 1990; 250: 1690-1694Google Scholar, 14Rauvala H. Pihlaskari R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16625-16635Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, neurons aggregated without neurites on the uncoated ELISA plates after 20 h. By contrast, cortical neurons actively extended long neurites on the pleiotrophin-coated plates (Fig. 7B). To examine whether 6B4 proteoglycan-pleiotrophin interaction is involved in the neurite outgrowth, anti-6B4 PG was added to the culture medium. Anti-6B4 PG significantly suppressed the pleiotrophin-induced neurite outgrowth of cortical neurons at a concentration of over 200 µg/ml, in contrast to the control IgG (Fig. 7, C and D). On the other hand, poly—lysine-induced neurite outgrowth was not influenced by anti-6B4 PG, indicating that the effect of the antibody is not a nonspecific cytotoxic activity (Fig. 7D). In fact, the cell viability determined by trypan blue exclusion was not influenced by adding the antibody to the medium (data not shown). However, it was revealed that anti-6B4 proteoglycan (200 µg/ml) did not interfere with 6B4 proteoglycan-pleiotrophin binding by the solid phase binding assay (data not shown). This result suggests that anti-6B4 proteoglycan does not directly mask the pleiotrophin binding site but affects the signal transfer mechanism of PTPζ and 6B4 proteoglycan. This study provides evidence that 6B4 proteoglycan binds pleiotrophin. The 6B4 proteoglycan had high and low affinity binding sites for pleiotrophin. Chondroitinase ABC digestion of 6B4 proteoglycan reduced the affinity of the proteoglycan to pleiotrophin without changing the number of binding sites. These results suggested that the core protein of 6B4 proteoglycan together with chondroitin sulfate chains constitute the binding sites for pleiotrophin. Among the various glycosaminoglycans, heparin potently inhibited the binding of 6B4 proteoglycan to pleiotrophin, consistent with the fact that pleiotrophin has high affinity for heparin (13Li Y.-S. Milner P.G. Chauhan A.K. Watson M.A. Hoffman R.M. Kodner C.M. Milbrandt J. Deuel T.F. Science. 1990; 250: 1690-1694Google Scholar, 15Kretschmer P.J. Fairhurst J.L. Decker M.M. Chan C.P. Gluzman Y. Böhlen P. Kovesdi I. Growth Factors. 1991; 5: 99-114Google Scholar). N-Syndecan/syndecan-3 and syndecan-1 were reported to bind pleiotrophin through heparan sulfate chains (17Raulo E. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. Nolo R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12999-13004Google Scholar, 20Mitsiadis T.A. Salmivirta M. Muramatsu T. Muramatsu H. Rauvala H. Lehtonen E. Jalkanen M. Theslaff I. Development. 1995; 121: 37-51Google Scholar). Heparitinase digestion of 6B4 proteoglycan did not affect the binding activity to pleiotrophin, showing that heparan sulfate is not involved in the binding. This is consistent with the finding that 6B4 proteoglycan does not contain heparan sulfate (2Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Oohira A. Noda M. Neuroscience. 1995; 67: 23-35Google Scholar). Our Scatchard analysis indicated that there were two binding sites with different affinities to pleiotrophin. This may be explained by the presence of two populations of 6B4 proteoglycan in the brain bearing chondroitin sulfate chains with different structures. In fact, Rauch et al. (21Rauch U. Gao P. Janetzko A. Flaccus A. Hilgenberg L. Tekotte H. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14785-14801Google Scholar) have reported that monoclonal antibodies distinguished two subpopulations of phosphacan with different chondroitin sulfate structures. We showed here that chondroitin sulfate C was a potent inhibitor of 6B4 proteoglycan-pleiotrophin binding as well as heparan sulfate. In contrast, chondroitin sulfate A was a poor inhibitor. From this point of view, it is also notable that the structure of chondroitin sulfate chains on 6B4 proteoglycan changes during development of the brain. In the early developmental stages, substantial amounts of chondroitin sulfate C unit are found, but later, the chondroitin sulfate chains of 6B4 proteoglycan are virtually composed of only chondroitin sulfate A units (2Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Oohira A. Noda M. Neuroscience. 1995; 67: 23-35Google Scholar, 21Rauch U. Gao P. Janetzko A. Flaccus A. Hilgenberg L. Tekotte H. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14785-14801Google Scholar). This developmental change in the structure of chondroitin sulfate may change the binding affinity of the proteoglycan to pleiotrophin. The contribution of chondroitin sulfate to the protein function is similar in thrombomodulin (22Bourin M.-C. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 419-425Google Scholar). Digesting thrombomodulin with chondroitinase abolished the inhibitory effect of this molecule on thrombin-induced fibrinogen clotting, indicating that chondroitin sulfate constitutes part of the active site. Raulo et al. (17Raulo E. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. Nolo R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12999-13004Google Scholar) purified N-syndecan from the membrane fractions of the rat brain and from the cultured neurons as a major binding protein for pleiotrophin. The 6B4 proteoglycan is quite soluble, and most of it is recovered in the soluble fraction of the brain extract. Moreover, there is much less PTPζ than N-syndecan. This may be why Raulo et al. (17Raulo E. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. Nolo R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12999-13004Google Scholar) did not detect 6B4 proteoglycan as pleiotrophin-binding protein. They indicated that adding anti-N-syndecan antibody or digesting the neurons with heparitinase suppresses the pleiotrophin-induced neurite outgrowth (17Raulo E. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. Nolo R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12999-13004Google Scholar, 23Rauvala H. Vanhala A. Castrén E. Nolo R. Raulo E. Merenmies J. Panula P. Dev. Brain Res. 1994; 79: 157-176Google Scholar), suggesting that N-syndecan is involved in the signal transduction of pleiotrophin. The Kd value of the binding of N-syndecan to pleiotrophin is 0.6 n, which is in a similar range to those of 6B4 proteoglycan (0.25 and 3 n). The content of pleiotrophin in the developing brain is extremely high, being about 10∼15 µg/g of wet tissue (24Rauvala H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2933-2941Google Scholar). This is also true for 6B4 proteoglycan or N-syndecan in the brain. About 10∼18 µg of 6B4 proteoglycan and 10 µg of N-syndecan can be purified from 1 g of brain (2Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Oohira A. Noda M. Neuroscience. 1995; 67: 23-35Google Scholar, 17Raulo E. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. Nolo R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12999-13004Google Scholar). Thus, 6B4 proteoglycan and N-syndecan have an apparently equivalent binding capacity for pleiotrophin, and 6B4 proteoglycan and PTPζ may compose another signal transduction pathway for pleiotrophin. Immunoelectron microscopy indicated that pleiotrophin is located not only on the cell surface but also in the extracellular matrix, suggesting that pleiotrophin binds to some extracellular matrix components (25Matsumoto K. Wanaka A. Takatsuji K. Muramatsu H. Muramatsu T. Tohyama M. Dev. Brain Res. 1994; 79: 229-241Google Scholar). Our studies indicated that 6B4 proteoglycan is localized at extracellular matrix as well as cell surface (10Nishizuka M. Ikeda S. Arai Y. Maeda N. Noda M. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 24: 345-355Google Scholar). Thus, 6B4 proteoglycan may serve as an extracellular reservoir of pleiotrophin. In addition to the soluble 6B4 proteoglycan, an alternatively spliced variant PTPζ is located on the neuronal cell surface as a receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase. Although it is not confirmed whether this molecule binds pleiotrophin, its carbohydrate modification is quite similar to that of 6B4 proteoglycan, including the chondroitin sulfate (3Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Shintani T. Nishiwaki T. Noda M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 67-70Google Scholar). 2H. Hamanaka, N. Maeda, and M. Noda, unpublished observation. Therefore, it is conceivable that PTPζ is a cell surface signal-transducing receptor for pleiotrophin. The developmental expression of pleiotrophin is dynamically regulated during development of the brain (13Li Y.-S. Milner P.G. Chauhan A.K. Watson M.A. Hoffman R.M. Kodner C.M. Milbrandt J. Deuel T.F. Science. 1990; 250: 1690-1694Google Scholar, 23Rauvala H. Vanhala A. Castrén E. Nolo R. Raulo E. Merenmies J. Panula P. Dev. Brain Res. 1994; 79: 157-176Google Scholar, 25Matsumoto K. Wanaka A.

In the rat cerebral cortex, the expression of pleiotrophin begins at around E12-E14, peaks at the perinatal period, and persists at a lower concentration into adulthood (23Rauvala H. Vanhala A. Castrén E. Nolo R. Raulo E. Merenmies J. Panula P. Dev. Brain Res. 1994; 79: 157-176Google Scholar, 25Matsumoto K. Wanaka A. Takatsuji K. Muramatsu H. Muramatsu T. Tohyama M. Dev. Brain Res. 1994; 79: 229-241Google Scholar). In the early cerebral cortex, pleiotrophin is located along radial glial fibers, a scaffold for neuronal migration, and in the subplate and the marginal zone (23Rauvala H. Vanhala A. Castrén E. Nolo R. Raulo E. Merenmies J. Panula P. Dev. Brain Res. 1994; 79: 157-176Google Scholar, 25Matsumoto K. Wanaka A. Takatsuji K. Muramatsu H. Muramatsu T. Tohyama M. Dev. Brain Res. 1994; 79: 229-241Google Scholar). Later, in the early postnatal period, pleiotrophin is more widely expressed in the cerebral cortex including the pathways of the developing axon (23Rauvala H. Vanhala A. Castrén E. Nolo R. Raulo E. Merenmies J. Panula P. Dev. Brain Res. 1994; 79: 157-176Google Scholar, 25Matsumoto K. Wanaka A. Takatsuji K. Muramatsu H. Muramatsu T. Tohyama M. Dev. Brain Res. 1994; 79: 229-241Google Scholar). These expression profiles are quite similar to those of 6B4 proteoglycan and PTPζ (2Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Oohira A. Noda M. Neuroscience. 1995; 67: 23-35Google Scholar, 7Cannoll P.D. Barnea G. Levy J.B. Sap J. Ehrlich M. Silvennoinen O. Schlessinger J. Musacchio J.M. Dev. Brain Res. 1993; 75: 293-298Google Scholar), suggesting that these molecules concertedly function together in the development of the cortex, especially in neuronal migration and in axonal outgrowth. Increasing evidence indicates that pleiotrophin and 6B4 proteoglycan promote neurite extension (2Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Oohira A. Noda M. Neuroscience. 1995; 67: 23-35Google Scholar, 11Maeda N. Noda M. Development. 1996; 122: 647-658Google Scholar, 12Peles E. Nativ M. Campbell P.L. Sakurai T. Martinez R. Lev S. Clary D.O. Schilling J. Barnea G. Plowman G.D. Grumet M. Schlessinger J.

Pleiotrophin attached to the substratum induces neurite outgrowth from cortical neurons in vitro. 6B4 proteoglycan itself does not promote neurite extension but rather exerts repulsive effects on neurons. However, plates coated with 6B4 proteoglycan together with poly—lysine, fibronectin, or tenascin promoted neurite extension from cortical neurons (2Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Oohira A. Noda M. Neuroscience. 1995; 67: 23-35Google Scholar, 11Maeda N. Noda M. Development. 1996; 122: 647-658Google Scholar). The CAH region of PTPζ/RPTPβ coated on a substratum promotes neurite extension from tectal neurons (12Peles E. Nativ M. Campbell P.L. Sakurai T. Martinez R. Lev S. Clary D.O. Schilling J. Barnea G. Plowman G.D. Grumet M. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1995; 82: 251-260Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrated that anti-6B4 proteoglycan antibody suppressed the pleiotrophin-induced neurite outgrowth, suggesting that 6B4 proteoglycan and PTPζ are the functional receptors for pleiotrophin. The mechanism by which 6B4 proteoglycan regulates neurite outgrowth seems to be rather complex. Milev et al. (30Milev P. Meyer-Puttlitz B. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24650-24653Google Scholar) have reported that complex-type N-linked oligosaccharides mediate the binding of phosphacan to Ng-CAM, N-CAM, and tenascin. The CAH region of phosphacan binds contactin (12Peles E. Nativ M. Campbell P.L. Sakurai T. Martinez R. Lev S. Clary D.O. Schilling J. Barnea G. Plowman G.D. Grumet M. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1995; 82: 251-260Google Scholar). Matrix-bound 6B4 proteoglycan/phosphacan may be recognized by neuronal cell surface receptors such as contactin and N-CAM, which trigger the neurite outgrowth. On the other hand, 6B4 proteoglycan and PTPζ on the neuronal cell surface may bind to matrix-bound ligands such as pleiotrophin, which also leads to neurite outgrowth. An immunohistochemical analysis of the cultured cortical neurons revealed immunoreactivity to anti-6B4 proteoglycan antibody on the rims of the growth cones and the filopodial processes, which are actin-rich structures that play important roles in axonal path finding and neurite outgrowth. Since this antibody recognizes both 6B4 proteoglycan and PTPζ (3Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Shintani T. Nishiwaki T. Noda M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 67-70Google Scholar), it is not clear which protein is responsible for this immunoreactivity. However, our recent analysis of cDNA transformants, stably expressing in the mouse fibroblast L cells, indicated that PTPζ was localized at cell cortical structures such as membrane ruffles and lamellipodia. 3T. Nishiwaki, N. Maeda, and M. Noda, unpublished observation. The cell cortex is rich in actin filaments and actin-binding proteins and plays important roles in cell locomotion and cell-cell and cell-substratum interaction (31Bretscher A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 337-374Google Scholar). We therefore postulate that PTPζ functions as a receptor that regulates the organization of actin filaments and that the ligand binding to this receptor leads to the reorganization of cytoskeleton in the growth cones and filopodial processes, resulting in neurite outgrowth and cell locomotion. Further studies are required to elucidate the involvement of pleiotrophin and PTPζ in the regulation of the neuronal cytoskeleton.

Most of the COOH-terminal domain of PLC-β isozymes is predicted to be helical, and three regions in this domain, PLC-β1 residues 911-928 (region 1), 1055-1072 (region 2), and 1109-1126 (region 3), contain a high proportion of basic residues that are highly conserved. Projection of the sequences of these three regions in helical wheels reveals clustering of the basic residues. The role of the COOH terminus and the clustered basic residues in PLC-β1 was investigated by either truncating the entire COOH-terminal domain (mutant ΔC) or replacing two or three clustered basic residues with isoleucine (or methionine), and expressing the mutant enzymes in CV-1, Rat-2, or Swiss 3T3 cells. The ΔC mutant no longer showed the ability to be activated by Gqα, to translocate to the nucleus, or to associate with the particulate fraction. Substitution of clusters of basic residues in regions 1 and 2 generally reduced the extent of activation by Gqα, whereas substitution of a basic cluster in region 3 had no effect. Substitution of the cluster of lysine residues 914, 921, and 925 in region 1 had the most marked effect, reducing Gqα-dependent activity to 10% of that of wild type. All substitution mutants, with the exception of that in which lysine residues 1056, 1063, and 1070 in region 2 were substituted with isoleucine, behaved like the wild-type enzyme in showing an approximately equal distribution between cytoplasm and nucleus; only 12% of the region 2 mutant was present in the nucleus. None of the basic clusters appeared critical for particulate association; however, replacement of each cluster reduced the amount of PLC-β1 in the particulate fraction by some extent, suggesting that all the basic residues contribute to the association, presumably by interacting with acidic residues in the particulate fraction. Membrane localization of PLC-β isozymes is therefore likely mediated by both the COOH-terminal domain and the pleckstrin homology domain, the latter of which is known to bind phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate.

The primary structures of PLC-β isozymes do not show any readily recognizable characteristics, such as amino-terminal signal sequences or transmembrane domains of membrane-associated proteins. The PLC-β isozymes located at the plasma membrane are activated in response to external signals by either the GTP-bound α subunits of Gq class G proteins or the βγ subunits of G proteins (9Sternweis P.C.

Cocco L. Nature. 1992; 358: 242-245Google Scholar). Although this latter observation is in dispute, PLC-β1 (18Divecha N. Rhee S.G. Letcher A.J. Irvine R.F. Biochem.

The nuclear PLC-β enzymes, which are activated independently of their plasma membrane counterparts by unknown mechanisms, catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides during cell growth and differentiation (16Divecha N.

Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). This COOH-terminal domain is required for both interaction with Gqα subunits (24Park D. Jhon D.-Y. Lee C.-W. Ryu S.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3710-3714Google Scholar, 25Wu D. Jiang H. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3704-3709Google Scholar) and association with particulate fractions (25Wu D. Jiang H. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3704-3709Google Scholar). From the amino acid sequence alone, the method of Rost and Sander (26Rost B. Sander C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7558-7562Google Scholar) predicts a secondary structure comprising 77.8%α helix, 1.6%β strand, and 20.6% loop for the PLC-β1 COOH-terminal domain. The COOH-terminal domains of PLC-β isozymes contain a high proportion of lysine and arginine residues (5Lee C.-W. Park D.J. Lee K.-H. Kim C.G. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21318-21327Google Scholar), some of which appear in clusters when the sequences of three regions (region 1, residues 911-928; region 2, residues 1055-1072; region 3, residues 1109-1126) that are predicted to be helical with a high reliability index are projected in a helical wheel (Fig. 1, B and C). Furthermore, the basic amino acids in these regions are highly conserved among PLC-β isozymes (Fig. 1B). We have now replaced these clusters of basic amino acids in PLC-β1 with equal numbers of isoleucine residues (which are similar in size to lysine), expressed the mutant enzymes in CV-1, Rat-2, and Swiss 3T3 cells, and measured the effects of the mutations on activation by Gqα subunits, on nuclear localization, and on particulate association.DISCUSSIONThe role of the COOH-terminal domain of PLC-β1 in the interaction with Gqα and particulate association has previously been studied. PLC-β1 from which the 336 residues COOH-terminal to His880 were removed by proteolysis showed a catalytic activity almost equal to that of intact PLC-β1 but was no longer sensitive to Gqα (24Park D. Jhon D.-Y. Lee C.-W. Ryu S.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3710-3714Google Scholar). However, proteolyzed PLC-β1 lacking ∼100 residues from the COOH terminus was activated by Gqα (24Park D. Jhon D.-Y. Lee C.-W. Ryu S.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3710-3714Google Scholar). Analysis of a series of deletion and truncation mutants of PLC-β1 further localized the Gqα interaction site to residues 903-1142 (25Wu D. Jiang H. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3704-3709Google Scholar). Residues 903-1030 were similarly shown to be required for the association of PLC-β1 with the particulate fraction (25Wu D. Jiang H. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3704-3709Google Scholar). A COOH-terminal truncation (314 residues) of PLC-β2 resulted in an enzyme that was activated by Gβγ subunits but not by Gqα subunits (14Lee S.B. Shin S.H. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25952-25957Google Scholar), indicating that the COOH-terminal domain is not essential for interaction with Gβγ. Our current observation that the ΔC mutant was neither activated by Gqα nor associated with the particulate fraction is thus consistent with previous data. We have also now shown that the COOH-terminal domain of PLC-β1 is required for nuclear localization of the enzyme.The activation of PLC-β1 by Gqα was markedly inhibited by the substitution of clustered basic residues in regions 1 and 2 of the COOH-terminal domain of the enzyme, but not by the substitution of three clustered basic residues in region 3. The extent of activation of the M1 mutant was about one-fourth that of the wild type. However, because the basal activity of the M1 mutant was 1.9-fold that of the wild-type enzyme and because the amounts of enzymes in the assay were adjusted to give similar basal activities, the diminished extent of activation of the M1 mutant might be partly attributable to this basal activity normalization. Although limited data points did not allow a quantitative kinetic analysis, distinct effects on the affinity for Gqα and Vmax were apparent. Among the five subdivided clusters of regions 1 and 2, M1a substitution was most inhibitory and reduced Vmax to ∼10% of the wild-type value. M1b substitution slightly reduced affinity without decreasing Vmax. M2a substitution also decreased affinity but appeared to increase Vmax. The inhibition associated with M2b substitution appeared to be attributable to reductions in both affinity and Vmax. M2c substitution reduced Vmax to 40% of that of the wild-type enzyme. M3 mutation did not affect the Gqα-dependent activation.Evidence suggests the existence of nuclear-specific PLC signaling. Thus, exposure of Swiss 3T3 cells to insulin-like growth factor-1 resulted in a transient increase in PLC-β1 activity and the hydrolysis of nuclear, but not cytoplasmic, PIP2 (17Martelli A.M. Gilmour R.S. Bertagnolo V. Neri L.M. Manzoli L. Cocco L. Nature. 1992; 358: 242-245Google Scholar, 22Cocco L. Martelli A.M. Gilmour R.S. Ognibene A. Manzoli F.A. Irvine R.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 720-725Google Scholar). Autonomous nuclear PLC-β1 signaling was also suggested to be one of the earliest events that follow exposure of human osteosarcoma SaOS-2 cells to interleukin-1 (21Marmiroli S. Ognibene A. Bavelloni A. Cinti C. Cocco L. Maraldi N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13-16Google Scholar). A decrease in nuclear PIP2 hydrolysis and the levels of nuclear PLC-β1 was detected during differentiation of erythroleukemia cells (32Martelli A.M. Billi A.M. Gilmour R.S. Neri L.M. Manzoli L. Ognibene A. Cocco L. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2536-2540Google Scholar, 33Divecha N. Letcher A.J. Banfic H.H. Rhee S.G. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 63-67Google Scholar). In addition, nuclear-specific PIP2 hydrolysis was demonstrated during S phase of the cell cycle in HeLa cells (20York J.D. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7847-7850Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of activation of nuclear PLC and the roles of the diacyglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate so generated remain unclear. Translocation of protein kinase C has been demonstrated coincident with the generation of diacylglycerol in the nucleus (16Divecha N. Banfić H. Irvine R.F. Cell. 1993; 74: 405-407Google Scholar). Recent evidence also suggests the existence of a functional Ca2+ store responsive to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in the nucleus (34Stehno-Bittel L. Lückhoff A. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1995; 14: 163-167Google Scholar). Inositol 1,4-biphosphate has been implicated as an activator of DNA polymerase (35Sylvia V. Curtin G. Noran J. Stec J. Busbee D. Cell. 1988; 54: 651-658Google Scholar).A total of 10 mammalian PLC isozymes (four β type, two γ type, and four γ type) has been identified (23Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Google Scholar). Although their distribution in the nucleus has not been systematically studied, several studies have detected PLC-β1, but not PLC-γ1 or PLC-γ1, in this organelle (17Martelli A.M. Gilmour R.S. Bertagnolo V. Neri L.M. Manzoli L. Cocco L. Nature. 1992; 358: 242-245Google Scholar, 18Divecha N. Rhee S.G. Letcher A.J. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 617-620Google Scholar, 19Mazzoni M. Bertagnolo V. Neri L.M. Carini C. Marchisio M. Milani D. Manzoli F.A. Capitani S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 114-120Google Scholar). We recently showed that all four PLC-β isozymes translocate to the nucleus when overexpressed in Swiss 3T3 cells.2 The entry of large proteins such as PLC-β1 into the nucleus appears to be mediated by multiple pathways (36Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Google Scholar, 37Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1993; 74: 385-386Google Scholar). From a large number of nuclear proteins, consensus sequences for nuclear transport have been deduced. These nuclear localization sequences are usually short and contain a high proportion of basic amino acids (36Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Google Scholar). One type of consensus sequence, known as the bipartite signal motif, comprises two basic amino acids, a spacer region of any 10 amino acids, and a basic cluster in which 3 out of the next 5 residues must be basic (36Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Google Scholar). Lysine residues 1055 and 1056 are separated by 12 amino acids from lysine residues 1069, 1070, and 1071 in region 2 of the COOH-terminal domain of PLC-β1. However, region 2 does not appear to function as a bipartite consensus sequence because neither substitution of Lys1055 in mutant M2a nor substitution of Lys1069 in mutant M2c had any effect on PLC-β1 distribution between the nucleus and cytoplasm.It has also been suggested that proteins are retained in the nucleus by binding to other nuclear components and that this binding is mediated by a domain structure rather than a short sequence of the retained protein (37Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1993; 74: 385-386Google Scholar, 38Schmidt-Zachmann M.S. Dargemont C. Kühn L.C. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 493-504Google Scholar). The fact that substitution of lysines 1056, 1063, and 1070 in mutant M2b markedly reduced nuclear translocation suggests that these 3 residues likely provide critical sites for interaction with negatively charged nuclear components. This effect is unlikely to be attributable to nonspecific disturbance of protein structure because similar substitutions in M1a, M1b, M2a, M2c, and M3 mutants did not affect their distribution between the nucleus and cytoplasm. The lack of PLC-β1 nuclear translocation in CV-1 cells may reflect the absence of the putative negatively charged components in the nucleus of these cells.When cells are broken in a buffer containing a low salt concentration, PLC-β isozymes, unlike PLC-γ and PLC-γ isozymes, are associated predominantly with the particulate fraction. This association is disrupted in the presence of a high salt concentration (such as 2 KCl), suggesting that it is mediated by electrostatic interaction. The specific components of the particulate fraction (such as plasma membrane, cytoskeleton, or endoplasmic reticulum) with which PLC-β isozymes are associated is not known. However, stable attachment of PLC-β isozymes to PIP2-containing lipid vesicles has been demonstrated by ultracentrifugation (39James S.R. Paterson A. Harden T.K. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11872-11881Google Scholar); the attachment required the presence of PIP2. Detailed kinetic studies have indicated that PLC-β isozymes possess at least one binding pocket for PIP2 other than the catalytic site (39James S.R. Paterson A. Harden T.K. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11872-11881Google Scholar). Consistent with this conclusion, all PLC isozymes contain pleckstrin homology domains, a distinct protein module of ∼100 residues that has the ability to bind PIP2 (40Harlan J.E. Hajkuk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Google Scholar), at their NH2 termini. The pleckstrin homology domain of PLC-β isozymes therefore likely interacts with PIP2. However, the observation that the ΔC mutant is virtually completely cytosolic suggests that the PIP2-pleckstrin homology domain interaction is not sufficient for stable association with the particulate fraction and that additional binding affinity is provided by electrostatic interaction. Consistent with this proposal is the observation that the monovalent acidic lipid phosphatidylserine facilitates PLC-β binding to lipid vesicles (39James S.R. Paterson A. Harden T.K. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11872-11881Google Scholar, 41Boguslavsky V. Rebecci M. Morris A.J. Jhon D.Y. Rhee S.G. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3032-3037Google Scholar). Therefore, interaction of acidic lipids, including phosphoinositides and phosphatidylserine, in membranes with basic amino acids in the COOH-terminal domain of PLC-β appears to be an important determinant of enzyme distribution. However, interaction of PLC-β isozymes with negatively charged proteins in membranes or the cytoskeleton cannot be ruled out. Our results suggest that all, rather than a subset of, the basic residues in regions 1, 2, and 3 of the COOH-terminal domain of PLC-β1 contribute to the interaction of the enzyme with the particulate fraction, a conclusion consistent with the observation that all of the mutant enzymes, especially ΔC, were eluted before the wild-type enzyme from the cation exchange resin of the heparin HPLC column. INTRODUCTIONThe β type phospholipase C isozymes (PLC-β1, -β2, -β3, and -β4) 1The abbreviations used are: PLCphospholipase CPCRpolymerase chain reactionHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPIphosphatidylinositolPIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphateGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. are present predominantly in the particulate fraction when tissues and cultured cells are homogenized in a low ionic strength buffer, whereas PLC-γ and PLC-γ isozymes are detected mainly in the cytosolic fraction (1Lee K.-Y.

The primary structures of PLC-β isozymes do not show any readily recognizable characteristics, such as amino-terminal signal sequences or transmembrane domains of membrane-associated proteins. The PLC-β isozymes located at the plasma membrane are activated in response to external signals by either the GTP-bound α subunits of Gq class G proteins or the βγ subunits of G proteins (9Sternweis P.C.

Cocco L. Nature. 1992; 358: 242-245Google Scholar). Although this latter observation is in dispute, PLC-β1 (18Divecha N. Rhee S.G. Letcher A.J. Irvine R.F. Biochem.

The nuclear PLC-β enzymes, which are activated independently of their plasma membrane counterparts by unknown mechanisms, catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides during cell growth and differentiation (16Divecha N.

The liganded AhR enters the nucleus, where it interacts with Arnt, generating an AhR/Arnt heterodimer that recognizes a specific nucleotide sequence within an enhancer upstream of the CYP1A1 gene (8Fisher J.M.

Toxicol. 1993; 6: 754-763Google Scholar). The binding of AhR/Arnt to the enhancer induces transcription, which is accompanied by alterations in chromatin structure and the binding of general transcription factors to the CYP1A1 promoter (12Ko H.P. Okino S.T. Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 430-436Google Scholar, 13Okino S.T. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3714-3721Google Scholar, 14Whitlock Jr., J.P. Okino S.T. Dong L. Ko H.P. Clarke-Katzenberg R. Ma Q. Li H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 809-818Google Scholar). Induction of cytochrome P4501A1 enzyme activity increases the ability of the cell to detoxify aromatic hydrocarbons (15Conney A.H. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 4875-4917Google Scholar). Thus, induction represents an interesting mechanism by which the cell adapts to changes in its external environment.As is typical of many transcription factors, AhR and Arnt have modular organizations. For example, both AhR and Arnt contain basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) motifs; the HLH domains mediate heterodimerization between AhR and Arnt, while the basic regions are responsible for the binding of the AhR/Arnt heterodimer to DNA (16Dong L. Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7942-7948Google Scholar, 17Fukunaga B.N. Probst M.R. Reisz-Porszasz S. Hankinson O. J. Biol.

Both AhR and Arnt exhibit regions of amino acid sequence homology with Per (a Drosophila circadian rhythm protein) and Sim (a protein involved in Drosophila central nervous system development) (19Huang Z.J. Edery I. Robash M. Nature. 1993; 364: 259-263Google Scholar, 20Nambu J.R. Lewis J.O. Wharton K.A. Crews S.T. Cell. 1991; 67: 1157-1167Google Scholar). These regions of homology (PAS domains) may contribute to protein-protein interactions during heterodimerization (18Reisz-Porszasz S. Probst M.R. Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6075-6086Google Scholar, 21Lindebro M.C. Poellinger L. Whitelaw M.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3528-3539Google Scholar). In addition, AhR and Arnt have transactivation domains, which are functionally distinct from the DNA-binding and heterodimerization domains (22Jain S. Dolwick K.M. Schmidt J.V. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31518-31524Google Scholar, 23Li H. Dong L. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28098-28105Google Scholar, 24Ma Q. Dong L. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol.

Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8343-8355Google Scholar).Others (1Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Google Scholar) have suggested that Arnt might play a more general role in mediating cellular responses to environmental stimuli and, therefore, that cells might contain additional proteins that serve as heterodimerization partners for Arnt. In support of this idea, studies of human hypoxia-inducible factor 1, which regulates cellular responses to low oxygen tension, reveal that it contains two bHLH/PAS proteins, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) and Arnt (27Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Google Scholar). Such findings raise the intriguing possibility that cellular adaptation to hypoxia involves a mechanism that is Arnt dependent. Arnt could be very influential in such a role because adaptation to hypoxia involves increases in erythropoiesis, vascularization, and glycolytic enzyme activity, as well as other changes (28Goldberg M.A. Schneider T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4355-4359Google Scholar, 29Helfman T. Falanga V. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1993; 306: 37-41Google Scholar, 30Semenza G.L. Roth P.H. Fang H.-M. Wang G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23757-23763Google Scholar, 31Wenger R.H. Rolfs A. Marti H.H. Bauer C. Gassman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27865-27870Google Scholar).We have undertaken a two-hybrid screening approach to find new proteins that interact with Arnt. We have used as the target Arnt's N-terminal region, which participates in Arnt's protein-protein interactions with AhR. Using this approach, we have identified mouse HIF1α as a heterodimerization partner for mouse Arnt. We demonstrate the functional importance of this observation by showing that Arnt is required for induction of the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) in response to hypoxia. Our studies provide new insights into the mechanism by which cells adapt to low oxygen tension, and they emphasize the importance of Arnt as a regulator of cellular responses to environmental stimuli.DISCUSSIONWe have used a yeast two-hybrid system to clone and identify mouse HIF1α as a dimerization partner for mouse Arnt. The functional importance of this protein-protein interaction is revealed by our observation that the PGK1 gene fails to respond to hypoxia in Arnt-defective cells. Our findings complement and extend those of Wang et al. (27Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Google Scholar) and Wang and Semenza (41Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Google Scholar), who identified HIF1α and Arnt as components of a DNA-binding protein complex that mediates cellular responses to hypoxia in human cells. The high amino acid sequence homology between mouse and human HIF1α suggests that the regulatory mechanism by which cells adapt to low oxygen tension is similar for the two species.Two observations imply that Arnt's HLH domain is important for its interaction with HIF1α. First, successful cloning relied upon a protein-protein interaction between HIF1α and a fragment of Arnt that contains its bHLH and PAS domains, which have been implicated in Arnt's heterodimerization capability. Second, deletion of Arnt's bHLH domain abrogates the response of the PGK1 gene to oxygen deprivation. The simplest explanation for this finding is that ArntΔbHLH fails to heterodimerize with HIF1α.Our findings indicate that Arnt's transactivation domain is dispensable for the induction of PGK1 gene expression by hypoxia. Similarly, we reported previously that Arnt's transactivation capability is not required for the induction of CYP1A1 transcription by dioxin (12Ko H.P. Okino S.T. Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 430-436Google Scholar). Therefore, in both the hypoxia-responsive and dioxin-responsive systems, Arnt appears to serve as a dimerization partner that confers DNA recognition capability upon HIF1α/Arnt and AhR/Arnt, respectively.Studies of dioxin-inducible transcription reveal that AhR/Arnt binds to the consensus DNA sequence 5′-TNGCGTG-3′ in the CYP1A1 enhancer (42Lusska A. Shen E. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6575-6580Google Scholar, 43Shen E.S. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6815-6819Google Scholar). Cross-linking studies and binding site selection experiments suggest that Arnt's basic domain binds to the 5′-GTG-3′ component of the CYP1A1 consensus sequence (37Swanson H.I. Chan W.K. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26292-26302Google Scholar, 44Bacsi S.G. Reisz-Porszasz S. Hankinson O. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 432-438Google Scholar). By comparison, studies of hypoxia-responsive genes imply that HIF1α/Arnt recognizes the consensus DNA sequence 5′-(G/Y)ACGTGC(G/T)-3′ upstream of PGK1 (30Semenza G.L. Roth P.H. Fang H.-M. Wang G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23757-23763Google Scholar). We note that this nucleotide sequence also contains a 5′-GTG-3′ motif; we speculate that it interacts with Arnt's basic domain during the induction of PGK1 transcription by hypoxia. We also note that AhR/Arnt's recognition sequence and HIF1α/Arnt's recognition sequence both contain a CpG dinucleotide, a motif that may undergo cytosine methylation. Cytosine methylation blocks the binding of AhR/Arnt to its recognition sequence and the response to dioxin (45Shen E.S. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17754-17758Google Scholar). By analogy, we envision that cytosine methylation may also block DNA binding by HIF1α/Arnt and the response to hypoxia. Thus, we hypothesize that DNA methylation has the potential to inhibit some cellular responses to decreased oxygen tension, possibly in tissue-specific fashion.Our findings indicate that HIF1α and AhR differ with respect to their transactivation mechanisms. In particular, we show that HIF1α's transactivation function is expressed independently of Arnt; however, in the dioxin-responsive system, transactivation by AhR requires heterodimerization with Arnt. We envision that heterodimerization triggers a conformational change in AhR, which allows its latent transactivation function to be expressed (12Ko H.P. Okino S.T. Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 430-436Google Scholar, 24Ma Q. Dong L. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12697-12703Google Scholar). Transactivation by HIF1α must involve a different mechanism because it does not require Arnt for expression.In several other receptor-dependent regulatory systems (i.e. those that respond to glucocorticoid hormones, heat shock, or dioxin), the receptor domain that mediates inducibility is distinct from the domain that mediates transactivation (24Ma Q. Dong L. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12697-12703Google Scholar, 46Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Google Scholar, 47Green M. Scheutz Sullivan E.K. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3354-3362Google Scholar). Thus, the observation that hypoxia responsiveness and transactivation capability map to the same 83-amino acid region of HIF1α is unusual because it suggests that the functional domains are congruent. Its amino acid composition and primary sequence reveal that HIF1α's C-terminal 83-amino acid segment is not rich in acidic residues, glutamine, or proline; thus, it does not resemble certain transactivation domains described previously (40Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Google Scholar). The segment is enriched in leucine and isoleucine residues (∼20%), as well as in serine residues (∼11%), and it exhibits clusters of hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids. These atypical properties may reflect the fact that the segment mediates hypoxia responsiveness as well as transactivation and, therefore, that its structure reflects a combination of these two functions.The fact that Arnt is a component of more than one regulatory pathway is interesting for several reasons. First, it increases the plausibility that Arnt mediates additional adaptive responses to environmental stimuli and that other Arnt-dependent signaling systems exist within the cell. Second, it raises the possibility that “cross-talk” exists between Arnt-dependent regulatory systems and that activation of one pathway (e.g. by dioxin) may affect the cell's ability to respond to a second stimulus (e.g. hypoxia). These appear to be potentially interesting issues for future research.

We have shown previously that the primase is recruited anew from solution for each cycle of Okazaki fragment synthesis and that association of primase with the replication fork is via a protein-protein interaction with the helicase, DnaB. We describe here mutant primases that have an altered interaction with DnaB and that direct the synthesis of Okazaki fragments of altered length compared to the wild-type. The mutant primases were deficient only in their ability to participate in replication reactions where their entry to the DNA was provided by the initial protein-protein interaction with DnaB. The primer synthesis capacity of these proteins remained unaffected, as was their ability to interact with the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. Neither replication fork rate nor the efficiency of primer utilization was affected at replication forks programmed by the mutant enzymes. Thus, the interaction between DnaG and DnaB at the replication fork is the primary regulator of the cycle of Okazaki fragment synthesis.

Liss, Inc., New York1987: 183Google Scholar) therefore modified their model, suggesting that if the signal to prime remained the release of the lagging-strand polymerase from the just completed Okazaki fragment, size variation could be accommodated if the lagging-strand polymerase synthesized DNA at a faster rate than the leading-strand polymerase and paused between termination of synthesis and release from the template. This would allow for variation in the distance on the lagging-strand template between two primers. Footprinting experiments of the bacteriophage T4 polymerase and its accessory proteins on a hairpin primer-template supported this model (11Munn M.M. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20034-20044Google Scholar). However, recently, Hacker and Alberts (12Hacker K.J. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24221-24228Google Scholar) demonstrated that the release of the polymerase from the nascent strand followed a first order kinetic decay with no lag when the polymerase encountered the 5′-end of what would be the previous Okazaki fragment at a replication fork. Stukenberg et al. (13Stukenberg P.T. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1994; 78: 877-887Google Scholar) showed that the pol III HE behaved in a fashion similar to the T4 polymerase in that the core-β assembly bound to the nascent strand dissociated when it encountered the 5′-end of a DNA strand annealed to the same template, but not when it was stalled by deprivation of deoxynucleoside triphosphates. At the replication fork, this would make the lagging-strand core available for recycling to the next primer. Whereas this spontaneous action of the polymerase may be the trigger for dissociation of core from β, it is not clear how this relates to the regulation of Okazaki fragment length. We have shown (14Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Google Scholar) that, just as for the T4 forks, Escherichia coli forks reconstituted in vitro can also be made to vary the size of the Okazaki fragments synthesized. Thus, what determines cycling of the lagging-strand polymerase and setting of Okazaki fragment length are likely to be two related but separate questions, answers to which might lie in the properties of two or more distinct protein complexes in the replisome. We found that Okazaki fragment size at replication forks reconstituted in vitro was governed by the frequency of primer synthesis and the efficiency with which the primers were used to initiate nascent lagging-strand synthesis (15Zechner E.L. Wu C.A. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4045-4053Google Scholar). We postulated that priming frequency at the replication forks was not determined by the properties of the lagging-strand polymerase, but by the distributive interaction of the primase with the replication fork with respect to the Okazaki fragment cycle. This interaction was suggested to be between primase and the replication fork helicase, DnaB (16Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Reems J.A. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4074-4083Google Scholar). That an interaction between DnaG and DnaB might exist had been suggested previously (17Marians K.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 16: 673-719Google Scholar), yet physical proof of such an interaction had remained elusive, presumably because of its weak and transient nature. We used functional domain analysis of primase by limited proteolysis coupled with assay in reconstituted replication reactions in vitro to identify the C-terminal 16 kDa of primase as the DnaB interaction domain (18Tougu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Google Scholar). As described in an accompanying article (19Tougu K. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21391-21397Google Scholar), analysis of the 16-kDa domain showed that deletion of the C-terminal 16 amino acids resulted in an enzyme that could act as a bona fide primase during DnaB-independent replication, yet was completely unable to support DnaB-dependent DNA replication presumably because of the loss of its DnaB interaction site. Additional deletion analysis showed that removal of the extreme C-terminal 8 amino acids from p16 abrogated its interaction with DnaB. We describe here the identification of single amino acid residues at the extreme C terminus of primase that, when mutated to alanine, result in proteins with altered interactions with DnaB. These point mutations do not affect the ability of DnaG to behave as a bona fide primase in DnaB-independent replication reactions, whereas they display altered properties in DnaB-dependent replication reactions. At the replication fork, this results in corresponding alterations in the size of the lagging-strand product, suggesting that Okazaki fragment length is indeed determined primarily by the interaction between DnaG and DnaB at the replication fork. We present a model that integrates the relationship between the polymerase and priming cycles on the lagging-strand side of the replication fork. Alanine substitution mutants of p16 were constructed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the following primers and pET3d-p16 (18Tougu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Google Scholar) as the template: The C-terminal primer for p16-T573A, p16-L574A, p16-N575A, and p16-Q576A was 5′-TCCCTCTATAGTGAGTCGGGATCCCTATTCGGCACTTAA-3′. The N-terminal primers were: p16-T573A, 5′-CGCCTGGAGCTCTGGGCATTAAACCAGGAG-3′; p16-L574A, 5′-CGCCTGGAGCTCTGGACAGCAAACCAGGAG-3′; p16-N575A, 5′-CGCCTGGAGCTCTGGACATTAGCCCAGGAGCTG-3′; and p16-Q576A, 5′-CGCCTGGAGCTCTGGACATTAAACGCGGAGCTGGCGA-3′. The N-terminal PCR primer for p16-E577A, p16-L578A, p16-K580A, and p16-K581A was 5′-AACGATTAATGCCAACCATGGCAGAGAGCGGCGTTT-3′. The C-terminal PCR primers were: p16-E577A, 5′-GGTAGGATCCTCACTTTTTCGCCGCCTCCTGGTT-3′; p16-L578A, 5′-CTTTTTCGCCAGCGCCTGGTTTAA-3′; p16-K580A, 5′-GGTAGGATCCTCACTTTGCCGCCAGCTCCTG-3′; p16K581A, 5′-GGTAGGATCCTCACGCTTTCGCCAGCTCCTG-3′. All of the PCR products were digested with SacI and BamHI, and the resulting DNA fragments were recovered from a polyacrylamide gel and ligated to SacI- and BamHI-digested, alkaline phosphatase-treated pET11d-p16. Candidate clones were recovered after transformation into DH5α, and the presence of the desired mutation was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. DnaG T573A, DnaG Q576A, and DnaG K580A were constructed by digesting the respective p16 mutant constructs with SacI and SphI. The DNA fragment containing the mutated region of the DnaG open reading frame was then purified by sedimentation through a 10-40% neutral sucrose gradient in 1 NaCl. The fragment was then ligated to SacI- and SphI-digested, alkaline phosphatase-treated pET3c-dnaG (20Marians K.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 507-521Google Scholar). Candidate clones were recovered after transformation into DH5α, and the presence of the desired mutation was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Wild-type and mutant p16 constructs were transformed into B834(λDE3) (Novagen) and overexpressed by induction for 2.5 h at 37°C with 0.4 m isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside in medium containing 500 µg/ml ampicillin. Purification of p16 proteins was as described previously (18Tougu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant DnaG constructs were transformed into BL21(λDE3) (Novagen) and overexpressed by induction with 0.4 m isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside for 2.5 h at 37°C in LB medium containing 500 µg/ml ampicillin. Purification of DnaG proteins was as described previously (18Tougu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Google Scholar). Primosomal proteins, the E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB), and the pol III HE were as described in an accompanying article (19Tougu K. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21391-21397Google Scholar), as were the G4 single-stranded (circular) (ss(c)) → replicative form (RF), general priming, and φX174 ss(c) → RF replication reactions. Tailed form II DNA template was prepared according to Mok and Marians (21Mok M. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16644-16654Google Scholar). Rolling circle replication reaction mixtures (12 µl) containing 50 m Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 12 m MgOAc, 10 m dithiothreitol, 5 µ ATP, 80 m KCl, 100 µg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.42 n tailed form II DNA (as molecules), 1.1 µ SSB, 3.2 n DnaB, 56 n DnaC, 28 n DnaT, 2.5 n PriA, 2.5 n PriB, 2.5 n PriC, 28 n pol III HE, and wild-type and mutant primases as indicated in the figure legends were incubated at 30°C for 2 min. GTP, CTP, and UTP were then each added to 200 µ, ATP to 1 m, and the dNTPs to 40 µ, and the incubation continued for 1.5 min. [α-32P]dATP was then added to give a specific activity of 2000-4000 cpm/pmol and the incubation continued for 10 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA to 40 m. An aliquot of the reaction mixture was acid-precipitated for the determination of total DNA synthesis and the DNA products analyzed by alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis as described by Wu et al. (14Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Google Scholar). Standard reaction mixtures were incubated for 6 min after the addition of label to establish active replication forks. A 10-fold excess of 5-methyl-dCTP was then added to the reaction mixtures. The reaction was terminated after an additional 25-s incubation by the addition of a 25-fold excess of ddGTP over dGTP. Nascent DNA was then digested with AluI, HpaII, HaeIII, and HhaI, which cannot cleave hemimethylated DNA but do cleave nonmethylated DNA. DNA products were analyzed by electrophoresis through horizontal 0.5% agarose gels at 1.6 V/cm for 24 h. The length of the largest DNA fragment was determined by comparison with the DNA size standards, and the replication fork rate was equal to this length (in nucleotides) divided by 25 s. The control reactions were identical except that the DNA was not digested with the restriction enzymes. Standard rolling circle DNA replication reactions containing the concentrations of wild-type and mutant primases as indicated and [α-32P]UTP and [α-32P]CTP each at 10,000 cpm/pmol were incubated for 10 min at 30°C. RNA and DNA products were recovered by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation after treatment of the reaction mixture with alkaline phosphatase (2 units) and analyzed by electrophoresis through a 15% (19:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide) polyacrylamide gel containing 50% urea using 100 m Tris borate (pH 8.3) as the electrophoresis buffer. The label now appears in two populations, as free 10-12-nt primers and as primer that has been used to initiate Okazaki fragment synthesis. The latter population barely enters this high percentage gel. The efficiency of primer utilization is calculated from the ratio of the label appearing as free primer to the total radioactivity on the gel as determined by phosphorimager analysis. In an accompanying article, we report that the extreme C-terminal 8 amino acids of primase are required for interaction with DnaB (19Tougu K. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21391-21397Google Scholar). To localize the amino acids involved in the DnaG-DnaB interaction, 8 of the 9 C-terminal amino acids of primase were replaced with Ala. Our strategy was to first construct the eight alanine substitution mutants within the context of p16 (the C-terminal domain of primase that can be overexpressed and purified from E. coli and which inhibits the primase-DnaB interaction; Ref. 18Tougu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Google Scholar) in order to determine whether any of them showed an altered DnaG-DnaB interaction in vitro. Mutations that endowed p16 with such a biochemical phenotype would then be introduced to full-length primase in order to study their effect on Okazaki fragment synthesis at the replication fork. The C-terminal 9 amino acids of primase are: T573LNQELAKK581. With the exception of Ala579, these were all substituted with Ala in our p16 overexpression vector and the resulting mutant proteins, as well as wild-type p16, were purified (Fig. 1A). L578A was completely insoluble, so we constructed L578F, which had a somewhat better solubility. Nevertheless, only partially purified preparations of L578F and K581A were used in the assays described below because of their limited overexpression. To analyze the ability of mutant p16 or mutant primases (see below) to interact with DnaB, two different replication assays were used that require DnaB to attract DnaG to the ss(c) DNA template: general priming (22Arai K. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4308-4312Google Scholar) and φX174 ss(c) → RF DNA replication (23Wickner S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4120-4124Google Scholar, 24Schekman R. Weiner J.H. Weiner A. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5859-5865Google Scholar). In the former reaction, DnaB bound to naked DNA serves as a target for DnaG. Once attracted to the DNA in this manner, DnaG can synthesize a primer that can be utilized by the pol III HE to prime complementary strand synthesis. This reaction is inhibited if the DNA is coated with SSB. Under these circumstances, an enzymatically more complex reaction is required to develop a target for DnaG binding. In the φX ss(c) → RF reaction, PriA, PriB, PriC, DnaT, DnaC, and DnaB are required to first form the preprimosome on the DNA (25Arai K. Low R. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 707-711Google Scholar). Primase can then bind to DnaB present in the preprimosome and become activated to synthesize a primer on the DNA. Primase alone is essentially inactive for primer synthesis in either of these assays. Wild-type p16 is a potent inhibitor of these reactions because it competes with primase for binding to DnaB (Fig. 1B). p16 by itself is devoid of any primase or DNA binding activity (18Tougu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Google Scholar). The eight mutant p16 proteins could be divided into four classes based on their ability to inhibit φX ss(c) → RF DNA replication (Fig. 1B). T573A, N575A, and E577A were moderately better inhibitors of replication than wild-type p16, indicating that these mutant proteins might interact somewhat more strongly with DnaB than the wild-type protein. L574A, L578F, and K581A inhibited replication to a comparable extent as wild-type p16, suggesting that changing these amino acids to Ala (or Phe in the case of L578F) did not affect the primase-DnaB interaction significantly. K580A showed a moderately reduced inhibition of replication when compared to wild-type p16, indicating that the ability of K580A to interact with DnaB was weaker than that of wild-type p16. Finally, Q576A showed a severely reduced inhibition of replication compared to wild-type p16, indicating a drastic loss in the ability of Q576A to interact with DnaB. One mutation from each class was chosen for characterization in the context of full-length primase. Thus, we generated the T573A, K580A, and Q576A mutations in the full-length primase open reading frame, overexpressed, and purified these mutant proteins concurrently with wild-type primase (Fig. 2A). The activity of these mutant proteins was compared to that of the wild-type protein in the general priming reaction (Fig. 2B). As was the case when the mutation was in the form of p16, the T573A primase displayed a moderately better interaction with DnaB, as inferred from its ability to support general priming somewhat better (30-40% increase in specific activity) than wild-type primase. K580A primase showed a moderately reduced interaction with DnaB, as inferred from its somewhat reduced ability (70-140% decrease in specific activity) to support general priming compared to the wild-type protein, consistent with the behavior of the K580A p16. Finally, just as Q576A p16 showed a severely reduced ability to interact with DnaB, the ability of the Q576A primase mutant to support general priming compared to the wild-type p16 was extremely compromised (4-12-fold reduction in specific activity). The effects observed with the mutant primases could be a result of an alteration in the primer synthetic activity of the enzyme. To assess this, the activity of each mutant protein was determined in the bacteriophage G4 ss(c) → RF priming and replication reaction (Fig. 3). G4 ss(c) → RF DNA replication is DnaB-independent (26Zechel K. Bouché J.-P. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4684-4689Google Scholar). Rather than requiring the assistance of DnaB to gain entry to the ss(c) DNA for subsequent priming, primase is capable of recognizing a hairpin structure at the G4 origin of complementary strand synthesis by itself, provided that the DNA is coated with SSB. The enzyme then synthesizes a specific 29-nt primer that is elongated by the pol III HE (27Bouché J.-P. Rowen L. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 759-765Google Scholar). All three mutant primases were fully active in supporting G4 ss(c) → RF replication (Fig. 3A). In fact, the T573A primase had a 2-fold higher specific activity than wild-type primase. In addition, the primers synthesized by the mutant primases were indistinguishable from the one synthesized by the wild-type primase (Fig. 3B). Therefore, these point mutations at the C terminus of primase affect neither its primer synthetic capability nor its ability to support replication, suggesting that potential interactions with DNA, SSB, and the pol III HE have not been affected adversely. Thus, we have engineered point mutations in primase that affect selectively its ability to interact with DnaB, the replication fork helicase, without affecting the ability of these mutant proteins to act as bona fide primases. This gave us the means to determine the effect of the interaction between the replication fork helicase and primase on Okazaki fragment length. We examine replication fork action in a rolling circle DNA replication system supported by a specialized tailed form II DNA template in the presence of the pol III HE, SSB, and the primosomal proteins (14Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Google Scholar). Replication forks that form on the template support sustained DNA synthesis, generating long (>0.5 Mbp) multigenome length duplex tails consisting of a continuous leading strand annealed to discontinuous Okazaki fragments. This system accurately mimics the action of the E. coli fork in that replication fork rates approach speeds equivalent to those estimated for the fork in vivo. DNA products are analyzed by electrophoresis through denaturing alkaline agarose gels. The long leading strand appears as a discrete band, migrating at the exclusion limit of the gel (about 50 kb), whereas the Okazaki fragments appear as a smear, representing a population of DNA fragments ranging from 0.5 to 5 kb in length. If Okazaki fragment length were set by the interaction between DnaG and DnaB, then altering either protein to affect the affinity of the interaction should result in the generation of Okazaki fragments of altered length at the replication fork; a weaker than wild-type interaction would be expected to result in a lower priming frequency, leading to longer Okazaki fragments than wild type, whereas a stronger than wild-type interaction would be expected to lead to a higher priming frequency and shorter Okazaki fragments than wild type. The underlying assumptions of this model are: (i) that the strength of the DnaG-DnaB interaction correlates directly with priming frequency, (ii) that the rate of replication fork progression, and thus the rate at which template is generated, is constant, and (iii) that the DnaG-DnaB interaction is the major determinant of Okazaki fragment length during a cycle of Okazaki fragment synthesis. This issue was addressed by examining the variation in Okazaki fragment size as a function of the primase concentration in the rolling circle replication system (Fig. 4). The behavior of the mutant proteins was consistent with both the observations described in the previous sections and with the model. The T573A primase, which appeared to have a slightly higher affinity for DnaB than wild type, consistently produced smaller Okazaki fragments than the wild type when present at equivalent concentrations (Figs. 4, A and C). This difference was barely noticeable at the highest primase concentration tested, and ranged between 10% and 20% at primase concentrations between 40 and 160 n. On the other hand, the K580A primase, which appeared to have a moderately lower affinity for DnaB than the wild type, consistently produced larger Okazaki fragments than the wild type (Fig. 4, A and C). Even at the highest concentrations of primase tested, the K580A mutant directed the synthesis of fragments that were 50% larger than those produced in the presence of the wild type. As the concentration of primase decreased, the magnitude of the effect increased, reaching 120% at 40 n primase. It should be noted that the resolution of the gels limited, to a certain extent, the experimental analysis, because as Okazaki fragments approached 15 kb in size, it became difficult to distinguish them from leading-strand product. At a concentration equal to those for the wild type, the Q576A primase directed the synthesis of Okazaki fragments that were drastically altered in size (Fig. 4, B and C). Even at 1.28 µ primase, a concentration that is nearly 4-fold oversaturated for the wild type with respect to the production of the minimum-sized Okazaki fragments, the Q576A primase directed the synthesis of fragments that were 70% longer in size. At 320 n primase, a concentration of the wild type that still generates fragments of minimum length, the Q576A protein directed the synthesis of fragments that were nearly 14-fold longer. Whereas the data with the mutant primases are consistent with our model, there are alternative explanations for the observed changes in Okazaki fragment size with respect to the wild type. Because fragment size is dictated by the distance between two successful initiations on the lagging-strand template, if the frequency of primer synthesis and the efficiency of primer utilization remained constant, a mutant primase-induced variation in the rate at which template was generated (i.e. in the rate of replication fork movement) could also lead to alteration in Okazaki fragment size. To assess this, we determined the rate of replication fork movement at active forks reconstituted with the wild-type and mutant primases (Fig. 5). We used a methodology that we had developed previously (14Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Google Scholar). Active replication forks are pulse-labeled with 5-methyl-dCTP and the reaction is terminated shortly after the addition of the pulse-label. The 5-methyl-dCMP incorporated renders the region of the DNA tail synthesized during the pulse resistant to the action of restriction endonucleases such as HaeIII that have dC residues in their recognition sequence. The DNA is digested with a mixture of these enzymes. This effectively removes all non-methylated DNA synthesized before the pulse. The 32P-labeled material is now electrophoresed through denaturing gels, and the length of the sharp trailing edge represents the longest distance traveled by a replication fork during the pulse period. Fork speed was assessed at concentrations of the mutant primases where they generated Okazaki fragments of distinctly different sizes. In all cases, the size of the leading strands synthesized during the pulse period were the same (Fig. 5). The slight variation observed could not account for the almost 15-fold difference expected when comparing the Q576A primase to the wild type if alterations in replication fork rate were the basis for observed changes in the size of the Okazaki fragments. It is possible, for example in the case of the Q576A primase, that the enzyme actually associates with the fork with the same affinity as the wild type and synthesizes primers at the same frequency, but the mutant primase interferes with the ability of the lagging-strand polymerase to cycle to the new primer terminus, leading to a decrease in the efficiency of primer utilization. We have shown previously that this will lead to the generation of"

The form(s) of PLA2 important for cell injury and the implications of enhanced activity of the enzyme, however, have not been discerned. Previous studies reveal an increase in PLA2 activity associated with cell injury, but this association does not establish a causal relationship between the increase in activity and the injury. LLC-PK1 cell lines were created that express either the cytosolic PLA2 or a group II PLA2. The susceptibility of these cells to hydrogen peroxide toxicity was determined in order to evaluate the relative importance of these two forms of PLA2 in oxidant injury. Expression of cytosolic PLA2 in the LLC-cPLA2 cell line was associated with a 50-fold increase in PLA2 activity in the cytosolic fraction, an increase in agonist-stimulated arachidonate release, and immunodetection of the cytosolic PLA2 protein that was undetectable in control cells. Exposure to hydrogen peroxide or menadione, but not mercuric chloride, resulted in significantly greater lactate dehydrogenase release in LLC-cPLA2 cells when compared with control cells. Exogenous arachidonic acid (150 µ) did not enhance hydrogen peroxide-induced injury. The intracellular calcium chelator, 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid/tetra(acetoxymethyl) ester, protected the cells against injury, but the calcium ionophore, A23187, did not increase injury. Glycine conferred no protective effect against hydrogen peroxide toxicity. By contrast to these results with cytosolic PLA2-expressing cells, secretory PLA2 expression to very high levels did not increase susceptibility to hydrogen peroxide. Thus, cytosolic PLA2 may an be an important mediator of oxidant damage to renal epithelial cells."

https://openalex.org/W2087167617,"We previously showed that substitution of a glycine residue for the palmitoylated cysteine 341 of the human β2-adrenergic receptor (Gly341β2AR), increases the basal level of the receptor phosphorylation and reduces its ability to functionally interact with Gs. In the present study, we show that additional mutation of serines 345 and 346 (Ala345,346Gly341β2AR) restored normal phosphorylation and receptor-Gs coupling, thus suggesting that the increased phosphorylation of this site, rather than the lack of palmitoylation per se, is responsible for the poor coupling of the unpalmitoylated receptor. This is supported by the observation that chemical depalmitoylation of purified β2AR did not affect the ability of the receptor to stimulate adenylyl cyclase in reconstitution assays. Furthermore, mutation of Ser345,346 in a wild type receptor background (Ala345,346β2AR) significantly decreased the rate of agonist-promoted desensitization of the receptor-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity, supporting a role for this phosphorylation site in regulating the functional coupling of the receptor. Since serines 345 and 346 are located in a putative cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylation site immediately downstream of the palmitoylated cysteine 341, the hypothesis that the accessibility of this site may be regulated by the receptor palmitoylation state was further assessed in vitro. In membrane phosphorylation assays, Gly341β2AR was found to be a better substrate for PKA than the wild type receptor, thus supporting the notion that palmitoylation restrains access of the phosphorylation site to the enzyme. Taken together, the data demonstrate that palmitoylation of cysteine 341 controls the phosphorylation state of the PKA site located in the carboxyl tail of the β2AR and by doing so modulates the responsiveness of the receptor. We previously showed that substitution of a glycine residue for the palmitoylated cysteine 341 of the human β2-adrenergic receptor (Gly341β2AR), increases the basal level of the receptor phosphorylation and reduces its ability to functionally interact with Gs. In the present study, we show that additional mutation of serines 345 and 346 (Ala345,346Gly341β2AR) restored normal phosphorylation and receptor-Gs coupling, thus suggesting that the increased phosphorylation of this site, rather than the lack of palmitoylation per se, is responsible for the poor coupling of the unpalmitoylated receptor.

To account for the rapid recycling required of the lagging-strand polymerase, it has been proposed that it is held at the replication fork by protein-protein interactions with the leading-strand polymerase as part of a dimeric polymerase assembly. Solution studies showed that the replicative polymerase, the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, was indeed a dimer with two catalytic cores held together by the τ subunit. However, the functionality of this arrangement at the replication fork has never been demonstrated. We showed previously that the lagging-strand polymerase acted processively during multiple rounds of Okazaki fragment synthesis, i.e. the same polymerase core assembly synthesized each and every fragment made by the fork. Using extreme dilution of active replication forks and the isolation of protein-DNA complexes capable of supporting coupled leading- and lagging-strand synthesis, we demonstrate here that this coupling of leading- and lagging-strand synthesis is, in fact, mediated by the τ subunit of the holoenzyme acting as a physical bridge between the core assemblies synthesizing the leading and lagging strands.

The fourth intracellular loop (ICL4), which connects the tenth and eleventh transmembrane spans, has a primary sequence that is highly conserved across species, is the site of a preserved sequence motif in the ABC transporter family, and contains a relatively large number of missense mutations associated with cystic fibrosis (CF). To investigate the role of ICL4 in CFTR function and to learn how CF mutations in this region disrupt function, we studied several CF-associated ICL4 mutants. We found that most ICL4 mutants disrupted the biosynthetic processing of CFTR, although not as severely as the most common ΔF508 mutation. The mutations had no discernible effect on the channel's pore properties; but some altered gating behavior, the response to increasing concentrations of ATP, and stimulation in response to pyrophosphate. These effects on activity were similar to those observed with mutations in the nucleotide-binding domains, suggesting that ICL4 might help couple activity of the nucleotide-binding domains to gating of the Cl− channel pore.

Although CF-associated missense mutations have been discovered throughout the coding region of the CFTR gene (5Tsui L.C. Hum. Mutat. 1992; 1: 197-203Google Scholar), certain regions appear to have a relatively high frequency of missense mutations; for example, M1, M6, and specific regions of NBD1 are the sites of many missense mutations. The study of CF-associated missense mutations in these regions has helped elucidate the function of CFTR and has shown how the mutations disrupt function in CF. Studies of mutations in M1 and M6 have shown that these regions contribute to the Cl− conducting pore (6Sheppard D.N. Rich D.P. Ostedgaard L.S. Gregory R.J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J.

Examination of the distribution of CF-associated missense mutations shows that the fourth intracellular loop (ICL4) which lies between M10 and M11 is another region that contains many missense mutations: at least 19 CF-associated missense mutations have been discovered in this loop (Fig. 1) (15Férec C.

Kaplan, personal communication), and R1070W (M. Macek, S. Sedriks, S. Kiesewetter, and G. R. Cutting, personal communication). Interestingly, one residue within ICL4, R1066, has been reported to have four separate CF-associated mutations: R1066C, R1066H, R1066L, and R1066S. Inspection of CFTR sequences from various species including human, rat, mouse, bovine, ovine, frog, and shark shows substantial sequence conservation throughout the MSDs, particularly within the intracellular loops. Evolutionary maintenance of these residues suggests that they have an important function. Additional support for an important function came from a recent study by Manavalan et al. (21Manavalan P. Smith A.E. McPherson J.M. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 279-290Google Scholar) who compared the length, sequence, and predicted secondary structure of the intra- and extracellular loops of the MSDs of various ABC transporters. Their study showed that the length of the intracellular loops was conserved, and they uncovered a consensus sequence in ICL4 (Fig. 1). This consensus sequence encompasses the cluster of CF-causing mutations in ICL4. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that ICL4 may play an important role in the structure and function of CFTR. To test this hypothesis and to learn how CF-associated mutations in ICL4 disrupt function, we constructed several of the CF-associated mutants in this region by site-directed mutagenesis, expressed them in heterologous cells, and studied their processing and function. CFTR mutants were constructed in the vaccinia virus expression plasmid pTM-CFTR4 (22Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Google Scholar) by the method of Kunkel (23Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Google Scholar). Mutations were verified by restriction enzyme analysis, DNA sequencing around the site of mutation, and in vitro expression. Wild-type and mutant CFTR were transiently expressed in HeLa cells using the vaccinia virus/T7 bacteriophage hybrid expression system as described previously (8Anderson M.P. Welsh M.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1701-1704Google Scholar). Cells were studied 14 to 24 h after transfection. We followed a protocol described previously (24Denning G.M. Ostedgaard L.S. Welsh M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 551-559Google Scholar). Briefly, soluble lysates of HeLa cells expressing the various constructs were immunoprecipitated with antibody M1-4 (9Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Google Scholar), which recognizes the C terminus of CFTR, phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP and the catalytic subunit of PKA, and separated on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Radioactivity was quantitated using a radioanalytical imaging system (AMBIS, San Diego, CA). Methods for excised, inside-out, and whole cell patch-clamp recording have been described previously (10Sheppard D.N. Ostedgaard L.S. Winter M.C. Welsh M.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 876-883Google Scholar, 25Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Google Scholar, 26Carson M.R. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L27-L32Google Scholar). Voltages are referenced to the extracellular side of the membrane. Whole cell and excised macropatch data were collected at potentials of +20 and −40 mV, respectively; single channel data were recorded at a holding potential of −80 mV for kinetic analysis. Experiments were conducted at 34-36°C. Liquid junction potentials and potentials at the tip of the patch-pipette were measured and current-voltage (I-V) relationships corrected for the corresponding offset. In whole cell studies, CFTR Cl− channels were activated with cAMP agonists (10 µ forskolin, 100 µ 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 500 µ 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate sodium salt (CPT-cAMP). In excised, inside-out patches of membrane, CFTR was activated with the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA, Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and 1 m ATP (ATP, disodium salt, Sigma). For excised inside-out patch experiments, the pipette (extracellular) solution contained (in m): 140 N-methyl—glucamine, 100 aspartic acid, 35.5 HCl, 5 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 TES, pH 7.3, with 1 NaOH (final Cl− concentration was 49.5 m). The bath (intracellular) solution contained (in m): 140 N-methyl—glucamine, 135.5 HCl, 3 MgCl2, 10 TES, 4 Cs(OH)2/1 EGTA, pH 7.3, with 1 HCl (free Ca2+ concentration was < 10−8 and final Cl− concentration was approximately 146 m). For whole cell experiments, the pipette (intracellular) solution contained (in m): 120 N-methyl—glucamine, 85 m aspartic acid, 3 MgCl2, 10 TES, 4 Cs(OH)2, 1 EGTA, 1 m Na2ATP, pH 7.3, with 1 HCl (free Ca2+ concentration was <10−8 and final Cl− concentration was approximately 41 m). The bath (extracellular) solution contained (in m): 140 NaCl, 10 TES, 1.2 MgSO4, 1.2 CaCl2, and 30 m dextrose, pH 7.3, with 1 NaOH (final Cl− concentration was approximately 142.4 m). For anion selectivity experiments using excised inside-out patches, the pipette (extracellular) solution contained (in m): 110 N-methyl—glucamine, 100 aspartic acid, 30 NaCl, 10 TES, 5 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, pH 7.3, with 1 HCl. The bath (intracellular) solution contained (in m): 140 of NaCl, NaBr, or NaI, 10 TES, 3 MgCl2, 4 Cs(OH)2/1 EGTA, pH 7.3, with 1 NaOH. Twenty to 40 1-s ramps of voltage from −100 to +60 mV were averaged to obtain the I-V relationship for calculation of permeability and conductance ratios in excised macropatches. Permeability ratios, PX/PCl, where X is Br− or I−, were calculated from reversal potential (Erev) measurements using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation, as described previously (27Anderson M.P. Gregory R.J. Thompson S. Souza D.W. Paul S. Mulligan R.C. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Science. 1991; 253: 202-205Google Scholar). Chord conductance was measured as the slope between Erev and Erev minus 25 mV. Conductance ratios, GX/GCl, where X is Br− or I−, are the ratio of chord conductance of Br− or I− relative to that of Cl−. Single-channel current amplitudes were determined from distributions of current in amplitude histograms. The fit of linear least squares regression lines to single-channel I-V relationships was used to determine single-channel conductance at negative voltages, where I-V relationships were linear. For whole cell and excised macropatch data, replayed records were filtered at 1 kHz using a variable 8-pole Bessel filter (Frequency Devices Inc., Haverhill, MA) and digitized at 2 kHz. For single channel analysis, replayed data were filtered at 1 kHz using a variable 8-pole Bessel filter, digitized at 5 kHz, and digitally filtered at 500 Hz. Event lists for single channel analysis were created using a half-height transition protocol; transitions less than 1 ms in duration were excluded from analysis. To derive open and closed time constants, single channel open and closed time histograms were plotted with a logarithmic abscissa with 10 bins/decade and were fit with both one and two component exponential functions using the maximum likelihood method, with a lower fitting limit of 2.5 ms. To determine if the two component function fit statistically better than a one component fit, the log likelihood ratio test was used and considered significant at a value of 2.0 or greater. Burst analysis was performed as described previously using the pClamp 6.0 software package (28Carson M.R. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1711-1717Google Scholar). We used a tc (the time which delineates interburst from intraburst closures) of 20 ms as derived from single channel closed time histograms. A tc of 20 ms was found suitable for all ICL4 mutants as well as wild-type CFTR. Regions of data from patches containing greater than one active channel with no superimposed openings were used for burst duration analysis as described previously (28Carson M.R. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1711-1717Google Scholar). Results are presented as means ± S.E. for n observations. Statistical significance was determined using a log likelihood ratio test or an unpaired Student's t test where appropriate. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Many CF-associated mutations cause a loss of CFTR Cl− channel function by disrupting biosynthetic processing such that the mutant protein is not delivered to the cell membrane (see Ref. 29Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1251-1254Google Scholar, for a review). Processing of CFTR can be assessed by examining its glycosylation state(s). Electrophoresis of wild-type CFTR resolves two bands: a broad, slowly migrating band (band C) that represents mature protein, and a more rapidly migrating band (band B) that represents immature protein (Fig. 2). Band C is endoglycosidase H resistant, consistent with protein that has migrated through the Golgi complex (22Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Google Scholar). Band B is endoglycosidase H sensitive, consistent with core glycosylation and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. CFTR with the most common CF-associated mutation, ΔF508, produces a protein which is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and is only core glycosylated (band B) (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2A shows that all the ICL4 mutations studied produced protein. However, the relative amount of the mature band C form of CFTR varied widely. For example, levels of mature F1052V were similar to wild-type, whereas L1065P, R1070Q, and H1085R were similar to ΔF508 in that they produced little mature protein (Fig. 2, A and B). The other ICL4 mutants expressed intermediate amounts of mature protein. Although in some places it appears that two bands may be present in the area marked as band C, this was not a consistent finding. In Fig. 2 the processing of ΔF508 and the milder CF-associated mutant, P574H (10Sheppard D.N. Ostedgaard L.S. Winter M.C. Welsh M.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 876-883Google Scholar), are provided for reference. To evaluate the effect of ICL4 mutations on Cl− channel activity, we selected the mutants R1066C, R1066H, R1066L, A1067T, and F1052V for study. The three mutants at residue Arg-1066 and the one at Ala-1067 were of interest because they lie within the center of the cluster of CF causing mutations, because they are encompassed by the ABC transporter consensus sequence, and because they show different levels of defective processing. We also selected F1052V, which lies outside the cluster of mutations and the ABC transporter consensus sequence, because we thought it would likely have a functional defect since it is associated with CF yet is processed like wild-type protein. We initially used the whole cell patch-clamp technique to test if mutants form regulated Cl− channels. We found that cells expressing all of the ICL4 mutants (F1052V, R1066C, R1066H, R1066L, and A1067T) generated cAMP-stimulated Cl− selective currents that showed time- and voltage-independent behavior identical to that of wild-type CFTR (data not shown). These data indicate that CFTR variants bearing mutations in ICL4 are able to form regulated Cl− channels with several properties similar to those of wild-type protein. However, the fact that each of the ICL4 mutants is associated with CF suggested that in addition to defective processing they may possess functional characteristics different from that of the wild-type protein. A region of increased hydrophobicity lies in the middle of ICL4 (21Manavalan P. Smith A.E. McPherson J.M. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 279-290Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). It is possible that such a region might be associated with the plasma membrane where it could contribute to the formation of the channel pore. An emerging theme in the construction of ion channels is that intra- and extracellular loops fold back into the plasma membrane and line the permeation pathway (30Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Nature. 1994; 371: 119-122Google Scholar, 31MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1995; 14: 889-892Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether the ICL4 mutations altered the conductive properties of the channel using excised, inside-out patches of membrane. Fig. 3 shows representative single-channel traces from the mutants. Mutations did not alter single-channel conductance: wild-type, 8.9 ± 0.3 pS; F1052V, 9.6 ± 0.2 pS; R1066C, 8.9 ± 0.4 pS; R1066H, 8.5 ± 0.7; R1066C, 8.6 ± 0.3; and A1067T, 9.2 ± 0.2 pS. Using excised patches of membrane, we also examined the relative anion permeability and conductivity sequence for 3 of the mutants. Table I shows that F1052V, R1066L, and A1067T did not alter the relative permeability or conductivity sequence for Cl−, Br−, or I−. These data suggest that the mutations in ICL4 did not alter the conductive properties of CFTR Cl− channels.TABLE IEffect of ICL4 mutations on anion selectivitynPx/PCLGx/GCLBr−Cl−I−Br−Cl−I−Wild-type31.29 ± 0.071.000.56 ± 0.131.18 ± 0.561.000.35 ± 0.06F1052V21.411.000.500.981.000.53R1066L41.36 ± 0.071.000.88 ± 0.111.15 ± 0.221.000.40 ± 0.11A1067T41.29 ± 0.151.000.66 ± 0.041.00 ± 0.101.000.43 ± 0.06 Open table in a new tab In agreement with our whole cell data, excised patch studies demonstrated that all of the mutants were both PKA- and ATP-dependent (data not shown). However, some of the ICL4 mutants had readily apparent alterations in gating. Fig. 3 shows single channel tracings selected to illustrate these differences. The most noticeable differences compared to wild-type were that the R1066C channels had longer closed times between bursts of activity. In addition, the Arg-1066 mutants and F1052V appeared to have bursts of activity with altered durations. The differences in gating were quantified in Fig. 4, Fig. 5. Interestingly, mutation of Arg-1066 to cysteine reduced open state probability (Po) (Fig. 3, Fig. 4A), yet when this same residue was mutated to histidine or leucine there was no effect on Po. The decrease in Po of R1066C was not due to a decrease in burst duration, but was instead due to an increased long closed time between bursts of activity (Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5C). In contrast to the cysteine mutation, mutation of Arg-1066 to histidine did not significantly alter any of the kinetics and mutation to leucine produced a small decrease in burst duration and increase in fast closed time. Mutation of the adjacent residue Ala-1067 to threonine produced a different pattern; Po was decreased primarily because of a decrease in burst duration.Fig. 5Open and closed time constants for wild-type CFTR and ICL4 mutants. Time constants were plotted and fit as described under “Experimental Procedures.”τo refers to open time constant, τcf refers to fast closed time constant, and τcs refers to slow closed time constant. n = at least three for each, except n = 2 for τcs for R1066C. Asterisks indicate p < 0.05 relative to wild-type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These findings show that ICL4 mutations altered channel gating without affecting Cl− permeation. These effects are similar to the effect of mutations in the NBDs of CFTR (10Sheppard D.N. Ostedgaard L.S. Winter M.C. Welsh M.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 876-883Google Scholar, 28Carson M.R. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1711-1717Google Scholar, 32Carson M.R. Welsh M.J. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2443-2448Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility of a functional interaction between these CFTR domains. Therefore we speculated that ICL4 mutations might disrupt or modify some aspect of NBD-mediated gating; i.e. they might alter the interaction with ATP or they might affect the way the channel responds to agents whose effect is mediated through the NBDs. To test this hypothesis we first examined the effect of increasing concentrations of ATP on channel activity. We studied R1066L and A1067T because they showed altered gating (Fig. 4, Fig. 5); we did not study R1066C because it was difficult to study in excised, inside-out membrane patches, possibly because of its very low Po and poor processing. Fig. 6 shows that as the concentration of ATP increased, the Po of wild-type and mutant CFTR increased. R1066L had a response identical to that of wild-type CFTR. The maximum Po of A1067T was decreased, but the shape of the concentration Po curve mirrored that of wild-type. As we have previously reported (8Anderson M.P. Welsh M.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1701-1704Google Scholar), the shape of the curves did not fit simple Michaelis kinetics. This pattern of response for A1067T is similar to what we have found with the NBD mutants G551D, G1244E, and G1349D (8Anderson M.P. Welsh M.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1701-1704Google Scholar). The decrease in maximum Po without a change in the shape of the dose-response curve suggests that in A1067T ATP binding may be unaltered but that a step distal to binding may be affected. To investigate further a potential interaction between ICL4 and the NBDs, we examined the effect of PPi on several ICL4 mutants. Previous studies have shown that pyrophosphate (PPi) stimulates CFTR Cl− channels through an interaction with the NBDs (33Gunderson K.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19349-19353Google Scholar, 34Carson M.R. Winter M.C. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20466-20472Google Scholar). PPi increases the Po of wild-type CFTR by prolonging the burst duration and by decreasing the interburst interval, effects which suggest that it interacts primarily with NBD2 (34Carson M.R. Winter M.C. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20466-20472Google Scholar). Fig. 7A shows that application of PPi to the cytosolic surface of an excised macropatch reversibly increased the activity of R1066L channels. However, Fig. 7B shows that the response of R1066L and F1052V to PPi was less than that of wild-type CFTR. This result suggested that ICL4 mutations may have altered an effect of PPi which is mediated through the NBDs, and perhaps specifically NBD2. To begin to isolate the effect of PPi to a specific NBD and to test further our hypothesis, we examined the response of several NBD mutants to PPi. We found that two NBD1 mutants, K464A and G551S, had a normal or increased response to PPi (Fig. 7C). In contrast, mutation of two analogous residues in NBD2, K1250M and G1349D, decreased the relative response to PPi. Each of these NBD1 and NBD2 mutations inhibit CFTR current to a similar extent. ICL4 of CFTR has a primary sequence that is highly preserved across species from elasmobranch to amphibian to mammals; it is the site of a conserved motif in the ABC transporter family, and it contains a relatively large number of residues that are sites of CF-associated missense mutations. Our data show that CF-associated mutations in ICL4 can disrupt the biosynthesis of CFTR and that some mutations altered gating of the channel. These considerations indicate that ICL4 plays an important role in determining the structure and function of CFTR. Previous studies have shown that CF-associated mutations can disrupt the processing of mutant CFTR so that it fails to escape from the endoplasmic reticulum and traffic to the plasma membrane. This is the primary defect in the most common CF mutation, ΔF508 (22Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Google Scholar). Previous reports of defective processing have focused on CF-associated missense mutations in the NBDs (10Sheppard D.N. Ostedgaard L.S. Winter M.C. Welsh M.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 876-883Google Scholar, 13Champigny G. Imler J.L. Puchelle E. Dalemans W. Gribkoff V. Hinnrasky J. Dott K. Barbry P. Pavirani A. Lazdunski M.

The molecular basis for misprocessing of mutant CFTR is not well understood; presumably it results from altered folding and/or structure of the mutant protein with consequent recognition as abnormal and degradation by the cellular quality control system. Our results showing that ICL4 mutations disrupt processing suggest that ICL4 plays a critical structural role in the protein. ICL4 mutations could cause misprocessing because they disrupt the structure of ICL4 itself, or they could have an indirect effect by altering the structure of an associated part of the protein. More profound changes in ICL2 can also disrupt processing. Delaney et al. (36Delaney S.J. Rich D.P. Thomson S.A. Hargrave M.R. Lovelock P.K. Welsh M.J. Wainwright B.J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 426-431Google Scholar) found that deletion of exon 5 (residues 163-193) disrupted processing and hence Cl− channel activity. Xie et al. (37Xie J. Drumm M.L. Ma J. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28084-28091Google Scholar) reported that deletion of 19 residues from ICL2 (residues E267 to M285) produced a similar effect. However, when that channel was incorporated into lipid bilayers it produced regulated Cl− channels. In addition, when Chang et al. (38Chang X-B. Hou Y-X. Jensen T.J. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18572-18575Google Scholar) introduced a glycosylation site into ICL4 at Val-1056 they found that the amount of protein decreased. In addition to their effect on processing, ICL4 mutations altered channel function. However, we could discern no relationship between the effect on processing and the effect on function. For example, the mutant F1052V was processed normally but had dramatically altered function, whereas the R1066H mutation had a dramatic effect on processing but little discernible effect on function. Moreover, mutation of Arg-1066 to three different residues, histidine, leucine, and cysteine, each decreased processing to roughly similar extents, yet had different effects on function. Clearly the requirements for channel processing and function are different. This conclusion is consistent with observations on NBD mutations; for example, the ΔF508 mutation is severely misprocessed yet retains approximately one-third of its function; whereas the G551D mutation is processed correctly but has very little function (9Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Google Scholar, 12Dalemans W. Barbry P. Champigny G. Jallat S. Dott K. Dreyer D. Crystal R.G. Pavirani A.

How might ICL4 participate in the Cl− channel function of CFTR? Our whole cell and excised patch data revealed no alteration of conductive properties, suggesting that ICL4 does not contribute directly to the conduction pore. Instead, ICL4 mutations altered the gating behavior. Because NBD mutations also alter gating, the data suggested the possibility of an interaction between ICL4 and the NBDs. The fact that ICL4 and NBD2 mutants reduced the response to PPi and the finding that G1349D and A1067T altered the effect of increasing concentrations of ATP in a similar way further suggest some interaction between ICL4 and the NBDs, particularly NBD2. In CFTR, some mechanism must exist for interaction between the NBDs, which control channel gating, and the MSDs which form the channel pore. There is evidence for such an interaction in other ABC transporters. In P-glycoprotein, transported substrate interacts with the MSDs and stimulates ATPase activity by the NBDs. Conversely, ATP hydrolysis by the NBDs stimulates drug efflux (40Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Germann U.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4854-4858Google Scholar). Recent work by Loo and Clarke (41Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Google Scholar) provided biochemical evidence for an interaction between each NBD and its respective MSD in P-glycoprotein. We speculate that in CFTR, ICL4 and probably other intracellular loops may link the NBDs to the MSDs. In this way the intracellular loops might couple the activity of the NBDs to the gating of the channel. This function for the ICLs could explain their evolutionary conservation in CFTR from different species and in other ABC transporters. There is precedent for such speculation in P-glycoprotein, where mutagenesis of the intracellular loops can alter substrate specificity (42Currier S.J. Kane S.E. Willingham M.C. Cardarelli C.O. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25153-25159Google Scholar, 43Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28683-28689Google Scholar). In addition, in several prokaryotic ABC transporters, where individual domains are encoded by separate genes, it has been suggested that a conserved sequence motif in a hydrophilic cytosolic loop of the membrane-spanning subunit is the site of interaction with the subunit containing the NBD (44Kerppola R.E. Ames G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2329-2336Google Scholar, 45Dassa E. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 39-47Google Scholar). These data also have implications for CF. First, an understanding of how particular CF-causing mutations disrupt CFTR function may prove helpful in the design and development of suitable therapies. For example, processing of several of the ICL4 mutants was not completely disrupted suggesting that some of the mutant protein may traffic to the plasma membrane. In such cases interventions designed to increase the activity of the mutant protein could potentially be of therapeutic benefit. Second, knowledge of how ICL4 mutations disrupt processing could help provide a better understanding of how the more common ΔF508 mutation disrupts processing. Third, these results provide some information about the relationship between genotype and phenotype. There are reports that several of the mutations (for example, F1052V, H1054D, and L1077P) are associated with a milder, pancreatic sufficient phenotype in which pancreatic function is not completely defective (17Mercier B. Lissens W. Novelli G. Kalaydjieva L. DeArce M. Kapranov N. Canki-Klain N. Lenoir G. Chauveau P. Lenaerts C. Rault S. Cashman S. Sanguiolo F. Audrézet M.P. Dallapiccola B. Guillermit H. Bonduelle M.

Our data suggest that in those mutants at least some of the protein is correctly processed. Therefore the pancreatic sufficient phenotype could result from residual activity of the mutant protein at the cell surface. However, not all of the data are as readily interpretable. For example, H1085R is misprocessed like ΔF508, yet it is reported to occur in a patient with a pancreatic sufficient phenotype. Conversely, our data with the mutants R1066L, R1066H, and A1067T are similar to that obtained with the “mild” mutants A455E and P574H (10Sheppard D.N. Ostedgaard L.S. Winter M.C. Welsh M.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 876-883Google Scholar) in that they retained partial processing and function. Yet those three ICL4 mutants were reported to be associated with a pancreatic insufficient phenotype (15Férec C. Audrézet M.P. Mercier B. Guillermit H. Moullier P. Quéré I. Verlingue C. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 188-191Google Scholar, 17Mercier B. Lissens W. Novelli G. Kalaydjieva L. DeArce M. Kapranov N. Canki-Klain N. Lenoir G. Chauveau P. Lenaerts C. Rault S. Cashman S. Sanguiolo F. Audrézet M.P. Dallapiccola B. Guillermit H. Bonduelle M. Liebaers I. Quéré I. Verlingue C. Ferec C. Genomics. 1993; 16: 296-297Google Scholar). In attempting to draw correlations about genotype, mechanism of dysfunction, and clinical phenotype, caution is warranted. Most of the mutations we studied are very rare in patients and therefore it is difficult to be confident of the clinical phenotype. However, further investigation into the relationship between genotype, mechanism of dysfunction, and clinical phenotype should yield new insight into how mutations in CFTR produce disease.

ATP and ADP, but not AMP or adenosine, induced a dose- and extracellular Ca2+-dependent rise in [Ca2+]i in identified gonadotrophs in a Mg2+- and suramin-sensitive manner. ATP, adenosine-5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), adenosine-5′-O-(1-thiotriphosphate), 2-methylthio-ATP, and 3′-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl-ATP were roughly equipotent in rising [Ca2+]i in gonadotrophs, while ADP was effective only at submillimolar concentration range, and none of these compounds permeabilized the cells. On the other hand, α,β-methylene-ATP, β,γ-methylene-ATP, and UTP were unable to induce any rise in [Ca2+]i. This pharmacological profile is consistent with expression of P2X2 and/or P2X5 purinergic receptor channels. Patch-clamp experiments showed that ATP induced an inward depolarizing current in gonadotrophs clamped at −90 mV, associated with an increase in [Ca2+]i. The ATP-induced [Ca2+]i response was partially inhibited by nifedipine, a blocker of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels (VSCC), but was not affected by tetrodotoxin, a blocker of voltage-sensitive Na+ channels. Thus, the P2-depolarizing current itself drives Ca2+ into the cell, but also activates Ca2+ entry through VSCC. In accord with this, low [ATP] induced plasma membrane-dependent [Ca2+]i oscillations in quiescent cells, and increased the frequency of spiking in spontaneously active cells. ATP-induced Ca2+ influx also affected agonist-induced and InsP3-dependent [Ca2+]i oscillations by increasing the frequency, base line, and duration of Ca2+ spiking. In addition, ATP stimulated gonadotropin secretion and enhanced agonist-induced gonadotropin release. ATP was found to be secreted by pituitary cells during agonist stimulation and was promptly degraded by ectonucleotidase to adenosine.

https://openalex.org/W2035041777,"We previously demonstrated that [3H]β-funaltrexamine ([3H]β-FNA) labeled the rat µ opioid receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells with high specificity, and [3H]β-FNA-labeled receptors migrated as one broad band with a mass of 80 kDa. In this study, we determined the region and then the amino acid residue of the µ receptor involved in the covalent binding of [3H]β-FNA. [3H]β-FNA-labeled receptors were solubilized and purified to ∼10% purity by immunoaffinity chromatography with antibodies against a C-terminal domain peptide. The site of covalent bond formation was determined to be within Ala206-Met243 by CNBr cleavage of partially purified labeled µ receptors and determinations of sizes of labeled receptor fragments. The amino acid residue of β-FNA covalent incorporation was then determined by site-directed mutagenesis studies within this region. Mutation of Lys233 to Ala, Arg, His, and Leu completely eliminated covalent binding of [3H]β-FNA, although these mutants bound β-FNA with high affinity. Mutations of other amino acid residues did not affect covalent binding of [3H]β-FNA. These results indicate that [3H]β-FNA binds covalently to Lys233. Since [3H]β-FNA is a rigid molecule, the information will be very useful for molecular modeling of interaction between morphinans and the µ receptor.

In this study, we determined the region and then the amino acid residue of the µ receptor involved in the covalent binding of [3H]β-FNA. [3H]β-FNA-labeled receptors were solubilized and purified to ∼10% purity by immunoaffinity chromatography with antibodies against a C-terminal domain peptide. The site of covalent bond formation was determined to be within Ala206-Met243 by CNBr cleavage of partially purified labeled µ receptors and determinations of sizes of labeled receptor fragments. The amino acid residue of β-FNA covalent incorporation was then determined by site-directed mutagenesis studies within this region. Mutation of Lys233 to Ala, Arg, His, and Leu completely eliminated covalent binding of [3H]β-FNA, although these mutants bound β-FNA with high affinity. Mutations of other amino acid residues did not affect covalent binding of [3H]β-FNA. These results indicate that [3H]β-FNA binds covalently to Lys233. Since [3H]β-FNA is a rigid molecule, the information will be very useful for molecular modeling of interaction between morphinans and the µ receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2013032587,"To explore the basis for interleukin (IL)-2 receptor (IL-2R) signaling specificity, the roles of tyrosine-based sequences located within the cytoplasmic tails of the β and γc chains were examined in the murine helper T cell line HT-2. Activation of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway, cellular proliferation, and the induction of various genes were monitored. All four of the cytoplasmic tyrosine residues as well as the distal portion of the γc proved dispensable for the entire spectrum of IL-2R signaling responses studied. Conversely, select tyrosine residues within the β chain were essential and differentially required for various signaling events. Specifically, activation of c-fos gene expression was found to occur exclusively through the most membrane proximal tyrosine, Tyr-338, whereas proliferation and the activation of STAT-5 were induced either through Tyr-338 or through the two C-terminal tyrosine residues, Tyr-392 and Tyr-510. These tyrosine residues mediated the induction of two different STAT-5 isoforms, which were found to form heterodimers upon receptor activation. In contrast to the tyrosine dependence of c-fos and STAT-5 induction, bcl-2 gene induction proceeded independently of all IL-2Rβ tyrosine residues. Thus, the tyrosine-based modules present within the IL-2Rβ cytoplasmic tail play a critical role in IL-2R signaling, mediating specificity, redundancy, and multifunctionality."

Various mutagenesis protocols were used to localize this interaction domain to the extreme C terminus of the primase. A mutant primase missing only the C-terminal 16 amino acids was isolated and its activities examined. This mutant enzyme was fully active as a primase, but was incapable of interacting with DnaB. Thus, the mutant primase could not support DNA synthesis in either the general priming reaction or during φX174 complementary strand DNA replication.

https://openalex.org/W2019110177,"We have previously shown that c-Krox is a zinc finger protein that can increases the transcriptional activity of the mouse α1(I) collagen promoter through its binding to two GC-rich sequences (Galéra, P., Musso, M., Ducy, P., and Karsenty, G.

In this report we show that c-Krox can bind to an additional site in the promoter of the α1(I) collagen gene and to three sites in the promoter of the α2(I) collagen gene, the other gene coding for type I collagen. One of the binding sites present in both promoters is adjacent to the CCAAT box. We have performed a structure/function analysis of c-Krox locating the transactivation domain in the zinc finger and C-terminal domains and the dimerization domain in the C-terminal end of the protein. We also demonstrate that c-Krox is an early response gene, whose expression is detectable as early as 9.5-day postcoitum in mouse embryos. Whole-mount in situ hybridization shows that c-Krox is expressed in dermatomes, the somite derivatives that generate dermis, and section in situ hybridization shows that c-Krox and α1(I) collagen mRNAs colocalized in skin but not in bone during development. This result is consistent with the predominant expression of c-Krox in skin in postnatal life.

https://openalex.org/W2138130007,"Abstract Expression of the N-methyl—aspartate (NMDA) receptor 2B (NR2B) subunit is neural-specific and differentially regulated. It is expressed in the forebrain and in cerebellar granule cells at early postnatal stages and selectively repressed in the cerebellum after the second postnatal week, where it is replaced by the NR2C subunit. This switch confers distinct properties to the receptor. In order to understand the molecular mechanisms that differentially regulate the NR2B gene in the forebrain and cerebellum during development, we have isolated and characterized the promoter region of the NR2B gene. Two 5′ noncoding exons and multiple transcription start sites were identified. Transcriptional analysis in transgenic mice reveals that an upstream 800-base pair region, which includes the first exon, is sufficient to direct neural-specific transcription. Developmental repression of the gene in the cerebellum requires additional regulatory elements residing in the first intron or second exon. Sequence elements that may participate in the regulation of the NR2B gene were identified by comparison to other neural genes. These studies provide insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating the switch of NMDA receptor subunit expression in the cerebellum, which ultimately account for the physiological changes in receptor function during development."
https://openalex.org/W2003185746,"The expression of the von Willebrand factor (vWf) gene is restricted to endothelial cells and megakaryocytes. We have previously reported the identification of a region of the vWf gene that regulates its cell-type-specific expression in cell culture. This region (spanning nucleotides −487 to +247) consists of a core promoter (spanning nucleotides −90 to +22), a positive regulatory region (spanning nucleotides +155 to +247), and a negative regulatory region spanning nucleotides −312 to −487. To identify the trans-acting factor(s) that interacts with the negative regulatory region, we carried out gel mobility and DNase1 footprint analyses of sequences −312 to −487. These analyses demonstrated that an NF1-like protein interacts with DNA sequences spanning −440 to −470 nucleotides in the negative regulatory region of the vWf promoter. Base substitution mutations of the NF1 binding site abolished the NF1-DNA interaction. Furthermore, mutation of the NF1 binding site in the promoter fragment (−487 to +155) that contained the core and the negative regulatory region resulted in activation of the mutant promoter in both endothelial and nonendothelial cells. The wild type promoter fragment (−487 to +155) was not activated in either cell type. These results demonstrate that an NF1-like protein functions as a repressor of vWf promoter activity. In contrast, the mutation of the same NF1 binding site, but now in the context of the larger 734-base pair endothelial cell-specific promoter fragment (−487 to +247), did not result in promoter activation in nonendothelial cells. The data indicate that there are additional repressor elements within the vWf promoter region suppressing its activity specifically, in nonendothelial cells, and suggest that there is a secondary repressor element(s) that is located in the terminal region of the first exon of this gene.

Endothelial cells are known to have a fundamental role in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes including tissue homeostasis, blood tissue exchange, thrombosis, angiogenesis, and cancer metastasis (1Davies P.F.

CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1988: 3Google Scholar, 6Risau W. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 926-933Google Scholar). Therefore, defining the basic molecular determinants of the endothelial cell phenotype is important to a variety of clinical and basic science disciplines (6Risau W. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 926-933Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism that controls the lineage specificity of endothelial cells is not well understood. One approach toward understanding the lineage specificity of endothelial cells is through investigation of the mechanism that regulates transcription of endothelial cell-specific genes, such as the gene that codes for von Willebrand factor (vWf). 1The abbreviations used are: vWfvon Willebrand factorBAEbovine aorta endothelialBSMbovine smooth musclePCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)PIPESpiperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid. von Willebrand factor bovine aorta endothelial bovine smooth muscle polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid. The protein vWf is a glycosylated protein that circulates in blood plasma as multimers of up to 100 subunits (7Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22777-22780Google Scholar). The vWf gene is located on chromosome 12, spans ∼178-kilobase pairs, and is interrupted by 51 introns (8Mancuso D.J. Tuley E.A. Westfield L.A. Worrall N.K. Shelton-Inloes B.B. Sorace J.M. Alevy Y.J. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19514-19527Google Scholar). The biosynthesis and secretion of vWf have been extensively studied (7Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22777-22780Google Scholar, 9Girma J.P. Meyer D. Verweij C.L. Pannekoek H. Sixma J.J. Blood. 1987; 70: 605-611Google Scholar, 10Ruggeri Z.M. Zimmerman T.S. Blood. 1987; 70: 895-904Google Scholar). Expression of the vWf is highly restricted to endothelial cells and megakaryocytes and is most often used as a marker for endothelial cell-specific differentiation (11Piovella F. Nalli G. Malamani D. Majolino I. Frassoni F. Sitar G.M. Ruggeri A. Dell'Orbo C. Ascar E. Br. J. Haematol. 1987; 39: 209-213Google Scholar). In addition, vWf has a central role in at least two major aspects of hemostasis, mediation of platelet interaction with damaged endothelial surfaces and stabilization of factor VIII in the circulation (7Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22777-22780Google Scholar, 12Tuddenham E.G.F. Blood. 1989; 3: 251-262Google Scholar). Investigation of the mechanism of endothelial cell-specific regulation of the vWf gene may also provide insight into the nature of the molecular defects that result in vWf quantitative deficiencies in patients with von Willebrand disease. The lineage specificity of differentiated cells has been proposed to depend upon the cell-type-specific distribution of various transcription factors (13Pani L. Qian X. Clevidence D. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 552-562Google Scholar). Through interactions with cis-acting DNA elements located in the promoter or enhancer regions of a cell-specific gene, such transcription factors regulate the expression of genes that are specific to that particular lineage. This molecular regulatory system is best exemplified by GATA transcription factors in erythroid specific hematopoiesis (14Orkin S.H. Blood. 1992; 80: 575-581Google Scholar). Until recently most emphasis has been on the factors that positively regulate gene expression. There is increasing evidence to suggest that trans-acting factors that negatively regulate gene expression are also important in determining cell lineage specificity (15Johnson A.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 655-658Google Scholar, 16Levine M. Manley J.L. Cell. 1989; 59: 405-408Google Scholar). The presence of negative regulatory elements and repressors has been reported in many genes including those for yeast mating type (17Keleher C.A. Goutte C. Johnson A.D. Cell. 1988; 53: 927-936Google Scholar), chicken lysozyme (18Baniahmad A. Steiner C. Köhne C.A. Renkawitz R. Cell. 1990; 61: 505-514Google Scholar), rat growth hormone (19Roy R.J. Gosslin P. Anzivino M.J. Moore D.D. Guerin S.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 401-408Google Scholar), and others (15Johnson A.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 655-658Google Scholar, 16Levine M. Manley J.L. Cell. 1989; 59: 405-408Google Scholar). In addition it has been shown that trans-acting factors such as hormone receptors can function both as repressors and activators depending on the sequence context of the promoters (16Levine M. Manley J.L. Cell. 1989; 59: 405-408Google Scholar, 20Adler S. Waterman M.L. He X. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1988; 52: 685-695Google Scholar). Direct evidence for the role of repressors in regulating cell-type-specific gene expression was provided by the recent report of Chong et al. (21Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramírez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G. Cell. 1995; 80: 949-957Google Scholar) that describes a repressor protein REST. The REST protein is expressed in all cell types except those of neuronal origin and inhibits the expression of the sodium channel gene in all cells, except those of neuronal origin (21Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramírez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G. Cell. 1995; 80: 949-957Google Scholar). One direct method to identify both positive and negative factors that may regulate the endothelial cell-type-specific expression of the vWf gene would be to identify the cis-acting elements that regulate gene expression. Such cis-acting regulatory elements may then be used to identify and characterize the trans-acting factors that bind to them. We have identified a region of the vWf gene spanning sequences −487 to +247 bp that mediates the endothelial cell-specific expression of a heterologous reporter gene in cell culture (22Jahroudi N. Lynch D.C. Mol. &Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 999-1008Google Scholar). This region consists of a core promoter spanning −90 to +22 bp (+1 being the transcription start site) which is not cell-type-specific, a negative regulatory region located within −312 to −487 bp, and a positive regulatory region located in the 100-bp terminal sequences of the first exon (+150 to +247). We have shown that the negative regulatory region inhibits transcription in all cell types studied. The positive regulatory region is required to overcome the inhibitory negative regulator in endothelial cells. Furthermore, an intact GATA binding site in the positive regulatory region is necessary for endothelial cell-specific activation of the promoter (22Jahroudi N. Lynch D.C. Mol. &Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 999-1008Google Scholar). We now report that an NF1-like protein (23Leegwater P.A.J. van Driel W. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1515-1521Google Scholar) interacts with its cognate cis-acting element in the negative regulatory region of the vWf promoter and through this interaction inhibits promoter activity in both endothelial and nonendothelial cells. We also report that there are additional negative regulatory element(s), located in the terminal region of the first exon, that inhibit vWf promoter activity in nonendothelial cells. Generation of the plasmids HGH-1, HGH-B, and HGH-K are previously described (22Jahroudi N. Lynch D.C. Mol. &Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 999-1008Google Scholar). To generate plasmids HGH-Brm3 and HGH-Krm3, appropriate fragments of the vWf gene (−487 to +155 for HGH-Brm3 and −487 to +247 for HGH-Krm3) were amplified using PCR with 49- and 39-mer oligonucleotides as primers. These oligonucleotides contained 40 and 30 bases that were complementary to the region of interest, and the remaining 9 bases at the 5′ end of each oligonucleotide contained a SalI restriction site. Oligonucleotides complementary to −487 to −447 containing the 3-bp substitution at positions −452, −453, and −454 were used in combination with oligonucleotide complementary to +125 to +155 to generate Brm3 fragment and +217 to +247 to generate Krm3 fragment. The resulting fragments were cloned into the unique SalI site upstream of the growth hormone structural gene in plasmid pφHGH (obtained from Nichols Institute Diagnostics). The resulting HGH-Brm3 and HGH-Krm3 plasmids were sequenced using the Promega Sequenase kit that confirmed the presence of the required three-base substitutions, with no other mutations in the vWf fragments. Primary bovine aorta endothelial (BAE) cells and bovine smooth muscle (BSM) cells were maintained as described previously (22Jahroudi N. Lynch D.C. Mol. &Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 999-1008Google Scholar). Primary cells, between passages 7 and 12, were used for transfection at 50-70% confluency. Transfections were carried out by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (24Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Google Scholar). The precipitates were left on BAE cells for 6 h and on BSM cells for 16 h. Cells were transfected with 25 µg of the various vWf-HGH plasmids. To determine transfection efficiency, 5 µg of plasmid πSVHPβWT (which contains human β-globin structural gene and promoter (25Treisman R. Orkin S.H. Maniatis T. Nature. 1983; 302: 591-596Google Scholar)) was cotransfected with each test plasmid. The media of the transfected cells were assayed for the presence of growth hormone 72 h after removal of the calcium phosphate coprecipitate. The growth hormone assays were performed as described by Allegro (Nichols Institute Diagnostics). Total RNA was isolated from cells by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method as described previously (26Chung S. Perry R.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 2075-2082Google Scholar). Single-stranded vWf antisense RNA complementary to the 5′-untranslated and flanking region of vWf gene was used as the probe. For synthesis of the probe, a fragment covering the PvuII (+155) to EcoRI (−2182) sites was cloned into the SmaI site of vector pGEM2 with the PvuII end closest to the T7 promoter to generate the plasmid pPT2. The antisense RNA probe was generated by linearization of this plasmid at the unique KpnI site (−620 in the vWf fragment) and transcription with T7 polymerase as described by Promega Biotec. Single-stranded RNA probe complementary to globin mRNA was generated from EcoRI digestion and SP6 polymerase transcription of a template plasmid, made by insertion of the 5′ fragment of the β-globin gene (−128 to +351) into the SP6-PL1 vector (27Charnay P. Treisman R. Mellon P. Chao M. Axel R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1984; 38: 251-263Google Scholar). Total RNA (25 µg for vWf and 10 µg for globin RNA) and 100,000 cpm of antisense RNA probe (specific activity, 108 cpm/µg) were resuspended in 80% formamide, 40 m PIPES (pH 6.7), 0.4 NaCl, 1 m EDTA and allowed to hybridize at 50°C for 16 h. RNase digestion was carried out in the presence of a mixture of 40 µg of pancreatic RNase A per ml, 2 µg of RNase T per ml, 10 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 m EDTA, and 400 m NaCl at 30°C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by addition of 20 µl of 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 50 µg of proteinase K, followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Samples were then electrophoresed on a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels. Nuclear extracts from BAE and BSM cells were prepared by the method of Schreiber et al. (28Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Google Scholar). DNase1 footprint analysis was carried by incubating 30 µg of nuclear extract with 5′ end-labeled probe spanning nucleotide −550 to −300 sequences. The probe was generated using PCR and primers that corresponded to −300 to −330 and −550 to −520. The primer corresponding to −300 to −330 was radioactively labeled using polynucleotide kinase and γ-32P. The end-labeled probe (10,000 cpm) and nuclear extracts were incubated on ice for 30 min in the presence of 2.5 m CaCl2, 5 m MgCl2, and 2 µg of poly(dI-dC). Following incubation samples were treated with 0, 10, 20, and 50 µg/ml DNase1 for 2 min at room temperature. The DNase1 digestion was terminated by addition of 2 µl of 0.5 EDTA, and DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Purified DNA was analyzed on 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. A sequencing reaction of the same labeled DNA fragment was run in parallel on the same gel. For gel mobility experiments the double-stranded oligonucleotides used as probes corresponded to −470 to −500, −410 to −440, and wild type or mutated (3-bp substitution) −440 to −470 sequences. Oligonucleotides corresponding to wild type and mutated NF1 binding site of the adenovirus replication of origin were as described (23Leegwater P.A.J. van Driel W. van der Vliet P.C.

Binding reactions were carried out in the presence (100 ×) or absence of competitors (wild type or mutant oligonucleotides). The 5′ end-labeled probes (5000 cpm, approximately 3 × 105 cpm/ng) were incubated with 3 µg of nuclear extract, 1 µg of poly(dI-dC), 0.5 m dithiothreitol in a buffer containing (final concentration) 10 m HEPES (pH 7.8), 50 m KCl, 5 m MgCl2, 1 m EDTA, and 5% glycerol. The reaction mixture, in a final volume of 20 µl, was incubated on ice for 20 min, and DNA-protein complex was separated from unbound probe on a 5% polyacrylamide gel run in 0.5 × TBE (90 m Tris borate (pH 8.2), 2.5 m EDTA) at 4°C. We have previously reported that the region of the vWf gene spanning nucleotides −90 to +155 can function as a promoter and drive the expression of a heterologous growth hormone gene in bovine endothelial cells, bovine smooth muscle cells, and HeLa cells (22Jahroudi N. Lynch D.C. Mol. &Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 999-1008Google Scholar). The activity of this nonspecific promoter was inhibited by sequences spanning −312 to −487 nucleotides in all three cell types studied (22Jahroudi N. Lynch D.C. Mol. &Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 999-1008Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this inhibition was accomplished through binding of a repressor protein(s) that recognizes a specific cis-acting DNA element(s) located somewhere within this approximately 200-bp region. To determine whether there is a protein that interacts with DNA sequences in the negative regulatory region, a footprint analysis was carried out. The DNA probe for these analyses was a 5′ end-labeled fragment corresponding to −320 to −550 sequences. The PCR-generated radioactive-labeled fragment was incubated with 30 µg of nuclear extract prepared from BAE cells as described under “Materials and Methods.” The DNA/protein mixtures were digested with various concentrations of DNase1, and purified DNA was analyzed on an 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. The results of these analyses indicated the presence of a protected region covering −442 to −471 sequences (Fig. 1). A protected region that covered sequences −500 to −530 was also observed; however, this was not further analyzed since this region was not included in the promoter fragments that we have studied. These data establish that the region spanning sequences −440 to −470 of the vWf promoter interacted with a protein(s). To determine whether the observed footprint was the result of a specific protein-DNA complex formation, we carried out gel mobility experiments using a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to sequences −440 to −470. The oligonucleotide was labeled with [32P]ATP (using the 5′ end labeling technique) and incubated with the nuclear extract from BAE cells. DNA-nuclear extract complexes were analyzed by gel electrophoresis in a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The results demonstrated that the oligonucleotide corresponding to sequences −440 to −470 interacted with a nuclear factor(s) (Fig. 2). This complex was shown to be specifically abolished by the presence of a specific competitor (an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the same region). Nonspecific competitors (an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the sequences −320 to −350 in the negative region) did not abolish the formation of this complex (Fig. 2). Oligonucleotides corresponding to other sequences of the 200 bp of the negative regulatory region did not form a specific complex when used as probes in gel mobility experiments (data not shown). These results were consistent with the hypothesis that a cis-acting element in the negative regulatory region interacts with a possible “repressor” protein. They also indicated that this element was located in the region spanning nucleotides −470 to −440 of the vWf promoter. To determine the exact DNA sequences in the −440 to −470 region that were involved in formation of the DNA-protein complex, we carried out mutation analysis of this region. A total of 10 double-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized, each containing three different bp substitutions, and were used either as probes or competitors in gel mobility experiments. Results of these analyses (4 of the 10 mutations shown) indicated that none of the mutants were able to form the specific complex with the BAE nuclear extract or compete for formation of the specific DNA-protein complex when the wild type oligonucleotide was used as the probe (Fig. 3). The lower complexes observed with all these mutants were nonspecific. A nonspecific complex migrating to the same position was also observed with wild type probe. The higher intensity of this nonspecific complex in the mutant probe may have been attributable to a greater availability of the labeled probe, since it was not specifically bound to NF1. An additional complex was also observed with the mutant m1 that migrated faster than the NF1-DNA complex. Since this complex was only observed with m1 mutant, we believe it to be the consequence of the specific base changes in this oligonucleotide that generated a protein binding site that was nonspecific. That this added band does not represent binding of an authentic factor specifically to vWf sequences in the absence of repressor protein is concluded because we did not observe the same complex in any of the other mutants m2, m3, or m4. Base changes corresponding to the m1 mutation were not used to generate vWf promoter fragments containing mutation in the repressor binding site. These mutation analyses establish that the entire intact −470 to −440 sequence was necessary for binding of the newly identified protein(s) to this region. To determine the identity of the protein(s) that interacted with the −440- to −470-bp region, we analyzed the nucleotide sequences in this region and identified a DNA sequence that had homology with the binding site for the NF1 (29Gander I. Foeckler R. Rogge L. Meisterernst M. Schneider R. Mertz R. Lottspeich F. Winnacker E.-L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 951: 411-418Google Scholar). The consensus NF1 binding site and the corresponding sequences in the −440- to −470-bp region of the vWf promoter are shown in Fig. 3A. Gel mobility experiments were next carried out with BAE nuclear extracts using the vWf −440- to −470-bp oligonucleotide (V) as a probe. An oligonucleotide that corresponded to NF1-binding sequences of the adenovirus origin of replication (A) (23Leegwater P.A.J. van Driel W. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1515-1521Google Scholar, 29Gander I. Foeckler R. Rogge L. Meisterernst M. Schneider R. Mertz R. Lottspeich F. Winnacker E.-L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 951: 411-418Google Scholar) was used as a competitor. Formation of a DNA-protein complex with the probe V was abolished in the presence of a 100 × molar excess of the unlabeled adenovirus NF1 binding oligonucleotide designated as “A” (Fig. 4A, lane 4). An adenovirus oligonucleotide that contained a mutation in the NF1 binding site (mA) did not abolish the formation of this complex (Fig. 4A, lane 5). When the adenovirus NF1 binding oligonucleotide (A) was used as a probe, the specific NF1-DNA complex that formed migrated to the same position as that observed with vWf sequences (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 1 and 6). Furthermore, addition of a 100 × molar excess of unlabeled −440 to −470 oligonucleotide (V) as a competitor abolished the formation of the specific NF1-DNA complex (Fig. 4A, lane 9, and Fig. 4B, lane 2). Addition of a 100 × molar excess of unlabeled vWf oligonucleotide (m3) that contained the mutation in the NF1 binding site did not abolish the formation of this complex (Fig. 4B, lane 3). These results establish that the protein(s) interacting with sequences −440 to −470 of the negative regulatory region of the vWf promoter include an NF1-like protein. Mutation analyses and transfection studies were next carried out to determine whether the NF1-like factor that interacted with the sequences −440 to −470 functioned as a repressor of vWf promoter activity. Constructs of the vWf promoter containing triple base substitutions in this region were fused to the growth hormone structural gene (used as a reporter gene) for these analyses. The triple base substitutions were the same as that in oligonucleotide m3, which was shown to inhibit the DNA-protein interaction in gel mobility experiments (Fig. 3). We incorporated this mutation in the context of the promoter that included the core region and the negative regulatory region (sequences −487 to +155) to generate plasmid HGH-Brm3 (Fig. 5A). The plasmid containing the wild type sequences was designated HGH-B (22Jahroudi N. Lynch D.C. Mol. &Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 999-1008Google Scholar). Each of the plasmids was transfected into BAE cells, and the promoter activity of the mutated vWf sequences (HGH-Brm3) was compared with that of the wild type (HGH-B) and to that of the plasmid containing only the core promoter region (HGH-1). The results of growth hormone production assays indicated that the promoter activity of the mutant HGH-Brm3 was similar to that of HGH-1 (Fig. 5A). The negative regulatory region of the unaltered vWf promoter inhibited the activity of the core promoter (Fig. 5, compare HGH-1 and HGH-B). These results indicated that the mutation in the NF1 binding sequence abolished its inhibitory effect in the negative regulatory region of the vWf gene promoter in BAE cells. Previous results showed that the basal level of growth hormone expressed from the plasmid HGH-B was not due to vWf promoter sequences (22Jahroudi N. Lynch D.C. Mol. &Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 999-1008Google Scholar). The vWf promoter fragments used in generation of these plasmids included the vWf transcription initiation site and 155 bp of the first exon that codes for the 5′-untranslated region. Thus, an antisense vWf-specific RNA probe was used to detect the vWf portion of the chimeric transcripts and to identify the transcripts that initiate from the correct start site (+1) in the vWf fragment. RNase protection analysis demonstrated the absence of detectable vWf transcript from the HGH-B plasmid (Fig. 5B). To confirm that the increase in the level of growth hormone expression in plasmid HGH-Brm3 correlated with an increase in transcription from the correct initiation site, similar RNase protection analyses were carried out with this plasmid. As a control for transfection efficiency, plasmid πSVHPβWT (25Treisman R. Orkin S.H. Maniatis T. Nature. 1983; 302: 591-596Google Scholar) containing the human globin gene was cotransfected with each of the vWf-HGH plasmids. Results of the RNase protection experiments confirmed that there was no detectable vWf transcript from plasmid HGH-B, whereas the vWf transcript was detected from plasmid HGH-Brm3 (Fig. 5B). These results demonstrated that mutation in sequences −470 to −440 of the vWf promoter inhibited protein-DNA complex formation and also abolished the inhibitory effect of the negative regulatory region restoring transcription. The data establish that the NF1-like protein that interacts with sequences −470 to −440 bp functions as a repressor of vWf transcription in endothelial cells. The negative regulatory region of the vWf promoter was shown to have an inhibitory function in both vWf expressing and nonexpressing cell types. To determine whether the same repressor was present in nonendothelial cells, nuclear extracts were made from BSM cells and used in gel mobility experiments with the radioactively labeled oligonucleotide −470 to −440. The results of this analysis (Fig. 6) indicated that the BSM nuclear extract formed a specific complex with the DNA probe which migrated in the same position as the complex formed with the BAE nuclear extract. The formation of this complex was also abolished in the presence of a specific competitor, whereas the nonspecific competitor had no effect (Fig. 6). These results were consistent with the hypothesis that a repressor protein (identified as an NF1-like protein in BAE cells) was present in both vWf expressing and nonexpressing cell types and interacted with the negative regulatory region. To determine whether a mutation in the NF1 binding site also abolished the repression of the promoter activity in nonendothelial cells, transfection experiments were next carried out in bovine smooth muscle cells. When plasmids HGH-B and HGH-Brm3 were transfected into BSM cells, similar results to those observed in endothelial cells were obtained (Fig. 7). The level of growth hormone expression from plasmid HGH-B was reduced compared with that of HGH-1, whereas the level of expression from plasmid HGH-Brm3 was comparable with that of HGH-1 (Fig. 7). These results establish that the NF1-like protein functions as a repressor of vWf transcription in nonendothelial cells as well as endothelial cells. Sequences spanning nucleotides +155 to +247 in the 3′-terminal region of the first exon of the vWf promoter have been reported to abolish the inhibitory effect of the negative regulatory region only in endothelial cells (22Jahroudi N. Lynch D.C. Mol. &Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 999-1008Google Scholar). To determine whether the endothelial cell-specific activity of sequences −487 to +247 bp of the vWf promoter was dependent only on binding of the NF1-like protein to the negative regulatory region, we next tested the effect of the same 3-bp substitutions when incorporated into the context of the larger promoter fragment −487 to +247 to generate plasmid HGH-Krm3 (this construct is the same as wild type plasmid HGH-K except for the 3-bp substitution). The activities of the mutated and wild type plasmids were then analyzed in transfected BAE and BSM cells. The results (Fig. 8) demonstrated that both plasmids facilitated a similar level of growth hormone expression in BAE cells. This result was consistent with the hypothesis that the positive regulatory region overcomes the effect of the repressor in BAE cells. Thus, mutation of the NF1 binding site had no additional effect. However in BSM cells, both mutated and wild type plasmids behaved similarly, and there was no increased activity as a result of mutation in the NF1 binding site (Fig. 8). The present results indicate that inhibition of the repressor function of the NF1 protein was not sufficient to abolish cell-type-specific activity of sequences −478 to +247 (a larger fragment) of the vWf promoter. Other DNA cis-acting elements (in addition to the NF1 binding site) within the vWf promoter region must also be able to repress promoter activity in nonendothelial cells. The presence of sequences +155 to +247 bp was the only difference between the active HGH-Brm3 and inactive HGH-Krm3. Thus, comparison of the activity of these two plasmids (both containing the NF1 binding site mutation) in BSM cells indicated that other repressor element(s) may be located in the sequences spanning +155 to +247 bp of the vWf gene. We have previously demonstrated that the region of the vWf promoter spanning nucleotides −487 to +247 functions in an endothelial cell-specific manner. This region was shown to consist of a core promoter, a negative regulatory region, and a positive regulatory region. The core promoter that constitutes nucleotides −90 to +22 bp was shown to drive the expression of a heterologous human growth hormone gene in all cell types studied. Addition of sequences upstream of nucleotide −90 that spanned the region −312 to −487 bp was shown to inhibit core promoter activity in all cell types studied. Sequences corresponding to nucleotides +155 to +247 of the first exon were shown to counteract the inhibitory effect of the negative region in an endothelial cell-specific manner. We have demonstrated the presence of several cis-acting elements, including an SP1, an octamer, and a GATA binding site in the +155 to +247 positive regulatory region. Among these only the GATA binding sequence was necessary for promoter activity in endothelial cells. Mutation of the GATA binding site inhibited the interaction of a GATA protein with its cognate cis-acting element and abolished promoter activity in endothelial cells (22Jahroudi N. Lynch D.C. Mol. &Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 999-1008Google Scholar). Our present data demonstrate that the inhibitory function of the upstream negative regulatory region of the vWf promoter was mediated through the interaction of an NF1-like protein with nucleotides spanning sequences −440 to −470. Three-bp substitutions that inhibited the interaction of the NF1-like protein with these sequences abolished the repressor function of the negative regulatory region. The NF1 protein was originally characterized as a 47-kDa protein that interacted with sequences at adenovirus origin of replication and was necessary for viral DNA replication (23Leegwater P.A.J. van Driel W. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1515-1521Google Scholar, 29Gander I. Foeckler R. Rogge L. Meisterernst M. Schneider R. Mertz R. Lottspeich F. Winnacker E.-L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 951: 411-418Google Scholar). However, DNA sequences that comprise the negative regulatory region of a number of genes including human retinal binding protein (30Colantuoni V. Pirozzi A. Blance C. Cortese R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 631-636Google Scholar), chicken β-globin (31Emerson B.M. Nickol J.M. Fong T.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 1189-1200Google Scholar), mouse Ren-1d (32Nakamura N. Burt W. Paul M. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 56-59Google Scholar), Sparc (33Nomura S. Hashmi S. McVey J.H. Ham J. Parker M. Hogan B.L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12201-12207Google Scholar), collagen (34Rossi P. Karsenty G. Roberts A.B. Roche N.S. Sporn M.B. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 1988; 52: 405-414Google Scholar), and rat growth hormone (19Roy R.J. Gosslin P. Anzivino M.J. Moore D.D. Guerin S.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 401-408Google Scholar) are reported to have homology to the NF1 binding sequence. Proteins that recognize NF1 binding sequences are part of a family of proteins and are designated “NF1-like proteins” (19Roy R.J. Gosslin P. Anzivino M.J. Moore D.D. Guerin S.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 401-408Google Scholar). In addition, other proteins such as C/EBP (35Landschultz W.H. Johnson P.H. Adashi E.Y. Graves B.J. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 786-800Google Scholar, 36Rosenfeld P.J. Kelly T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1398-1408Google Scholar), CP1, and CP2 (37Chodosh L.A. Baldwin A.S. Carthew R.W. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 53: 11-24Google Scholar) and a subset of modified histone H1 (38Ristiniemi J. Oikarinen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2164-2174Google Scholar) also can interact with the NF1 binding DNA sequences. To our knowledge there are no antibodies available that recognize NF1 proteins. Thus, we were not able to directly demonstrate by supershift that the specific protein that interacts with sequences −470 to −440 is the previously reported NF1 protein. However, the binding characteristics of our identified protein were similar to members of the NF1 family. The DNase1 footprint analyses demonstrated the protection of an approximately 24-nucleotide region, and mutation analyses demonstrated that the entire 30 nucleotides in the −440 to −470 region were necessary for DNA-protein interaction. These results were consistent with previously reported characteristics of the NF1-DNA interaction (23Leegwater P.A.J. van Driel W. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1515-1521Google Scholar). Furthermore, gel mobility experiments demonstrated competition of vWf sequences for the protein that binds adenovirus NF1 binding sequences, indicating that the protein(s) recognizing adenovirus NF1 binding site and the vWf sequences are members of the NF1-like protein family. A direct role for an NF1-like protein as a repressor has been previously reported (19Roy R.J. Gosslin P. Anzivino M.J. Moore D.D. Guerin S.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 401-408Google Scholar). A 52-kDa protein member of this family was shown to function as a repressor of rat growth hormone promoter in nonpituitary cells (19Roy R.J. Gosslin P. Anzivino M.J. Moore D.D. Guerin S.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 401-408Google Scholar). This result demonstrated that an NF1-like protein functioned as a repressor that was involved in cell-type-specific gene regulation. Our results establish that an NF1-like protein also functioned as a repressor of the vWf promoter, but it inhibited the vWf promoter activity in both endothelial and nonendothelial cell types. There are several possible mechanisms that might describe how a repressor functions (15Johnson A.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 655-658Google Scholar, 16Levine M. Manley J.L. Cell. 1989; 59: 405-408Google Scholar). A repressor may inhibit promoter activity by interfering with the function of an adjacent activator. This inhibition may be achieved either through protein interaction when both activator and repressor are bound to DNA or through repressor binding to the DNA which may mask the binding site of an activator. In each of these mechanisms, the repressor interferes with the function of an activator that is required to interact with general transcription machinery to initiate transcription. Another mechanism by which a repressor might function is proposed to be through direct interaction with the components of general transcription machinery, thereby preventing transcription. Although we do not have direct evidence to demonstrate which mechanism is involved in repression of the vWf promoter by NF1, our results favor a mechanism that involves direct repression. We reasoned that if there was an activator adjacent to the NF1 binding site, which was necessary for transcription, deletion of sequences from −487 to −90 bp should have abolished promoter activity. Such a deletion would have been expected to have removed both the NF1 and the putative activator binding sites. The observed transcriptional activity of the plasmid HGH-1 that did not include sequences −487 to −90 indicated to us that removal of these sequences did not abolish transcription. We cannot rule out that an activator(s) may bind to sequences downstream of the −90 nucleotide and that its function could have been inhibited by the NF1 repressor. Although it was clearly demonstrated that the NF1-like protein functioned as a repressor of the vWf promoter, mutation of the NF1 binding site in the context of the larger endothelial cell-specific vWf promoter fragment (−487 to +247) did not result in promoter activation in bovine smooth muscle cells. The same mutation in the context of the promoter that included the smaller core and negative regulatory region (−487 to +155) resulted in promoter activity in smooth muscle cells. These results suggested that sequences spanning nucleotide +155 to +247 of the vWf promoter inhibit promoter activity in nonendothelial cells even when the NF1 binding site is mutated. Thus, another repressor may interact with sequences in this region and inhibit expression in nonendothelial cells. Since this same +155 to +247 region positively activated vWf expression in endothelial cells, we hypothesize that a second repressor functions in a cell-type-specific manner and represses vWf promoter activity only in nonendothelial cells. However, this hypothesis does not exclude the possibility that this repressor may also be present in endothelial cells with its function inhibited (similar to that of NF1) by positively activating factors such as GATA factor (and perhaps another as yet unidentified factor) in endothelial cells. The results of our deletion and mutation analyses of the vWf promoter are summarized in Fig. 9. We propose a model to explain the endothelial cell-type-specific regulation of the vWf gene, through a mechanism involving selective “de-repression” (Fig. 9). Such a mechanism involves the presence of factors that override the repressor function of the NF1-like protein (and perhaps the second downstream repressor) on the vWf promoter in endothelial cells. The observation that a positive regulatory region is necessary for activation of the vWf promoter in endothelial cells suggested that trans-acting factors may interact with this region and play a role in de-repression. We have already demonstrated that mutation of the GATA binding site abolishes the promoter activity of sequences −487 to +247 in endothelial cells. Thus, the GATA factor (shown as G in Fig. 9B) and perhaps other as yet unidentified factors (represented as A? in Fig. 9) that interact with sequences +155 to +247 may function as de-repressors. The observation in smooth muscle cells that the sequences +155 to +247 inhibited the promoter activation even in absence of NF1 binding (as shown by lack of expression of plasmid HGH-Krm3 in BSMC, Fig. 8) suggests that this second repressor may also directly inhibit transcription rather than interfere with the de-repression function of an activator. Thus, the presence of two independent repressors may be responsible for preventing the expression of the vWf gene in cells that are not of endothelial origin. Studies with transgenic mice expressing the endothelial cell-specific vWf promoter have demonstrated that the sequences −487 to +247 of the vWf promoter function in an organ-specific manner (39Aird W.C. Jahroudi N. Weiler-Guettler H. Rayburn H.B. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4567-4571Google Scholar). In mouse embryos this promoter was active in the endothelial cells of most of the embryonic vasculature, whereas in adult mice its activity was restricted to a subset of brain endothelial cells (39Aird W.C. Jahroudi N. Weiler-Guettler H. Rayburn H.B. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4567-4571Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that endothelial cells are heterogeneous in vivo, and those of different organs express different molecules. Most endothelial cells do express vWf (6Risau W. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 926-933Google Scholar). Thus, the organ-specific activity of the −487 to +247 region suggests that there are other cis-acting elements that are necessary to activate the vWf promoter in endothelial cells of other organs in vivo. This organ-specific behavior of the vWf promoter may be modulated through the NF1-like protein. Selective de-repression of the vWf promoter may be extended to include cis-acting elements in other regions of the gene that are required to overcome NF1 repression in endothelial cells of various organs, whereas elements in the terminal region of the first exon are sufficient to override the repression in endothelial cells of the brain vasculature. A secondary repressor of the vWf promoter in the +155 to +247 region may function to maintain repression of vWf transcription in cells of nonendothelial origin."
https://openalex.org/W2021918499,"The main antigenic region of foot-and-mouth disease virus serotype C1, also called site A, has been inserted in zones of the beta-galactosidase important for the stabilization of the active site, causing important changes in the Km and the specific activity of the resulting enzymes. The peptide is displayed at the surface of the recombinant proteins and, in all the cases, presents a good antigenicity. Among the recombinant proteins constructed, in proteins M278VP1 and M275SVP1 the peptide is inserted in a large loop of the beta-galactosidase (amino acids 272-288) involved in the formation of the activating interface. In these constructs, the binding of the specific antibodies directed to the foreign peptide causes an increase of the beta-galactosidase activity up to about 200%. This phenomenon has been proved using monoclonal antibodies and also using polyclonal sera generated against the peptide. Different hypothesis of the mechanism of modulation upon antibody binding are discussed. This insertion site seems to be sensitive enough to enzymatic modulation mediated by antibody binding. We propose further exploring this insertion site as a tool for a rapid detection of specific antibodies in a quick and simple homogeneous assay based on the colorimetric determination of beta-galactosidase activity."

In addition, PD 098059 prevented bombesin-induced DNA synthesis and progression of the cells through the cell cycle, indicating that the mitogenic effect of bombesin is dependent on the activation of p42mapk. However, in the presence of insulin, which neither stimulated p42mapk activation nor DNA synthesis on its own in Swiss 3T3 cells, bombesin potently stimulated DNA synthesis even at concentrations of PD 098059 (15 µ) that completely abolished the mitogenic effect of bombesin alone. Furthermore, Swiss 3T3 cells stably transfected with interfering mutants of MEK-1 showed a marked decrease in the mitogenic effect of bombesin. In contrast, the combination of bombesin and insulin strongly stimulated DNA synthesis in these cells to levels comparable with that obtained in the wild type cells. Thus, our data demonstrate that insulin dramatically reduced the requirement for the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway for reinitiation of DNA synthesis in bombesin-treated Swiss 3T3 cells and consequently indicate that the contribution of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade to mitogenesis depends on the combination of extracellular signals that are used to stimulate these cells.

Using the yeast two-hybrid system, this region of the Crk-II SH2 domain was found to interact with a subset of SH3 domains, notably the Abl SH3 domain. Furthermore, this proline-rich insert was found to modify the efficiency with which Crk-II was phosphorylated by the p140c-abl tyrosine kinase. In vitro, the interaction of full-length non-phosphorylated Crk-II with a glutathione S-transferase-Abl SH3 domain fusion protein was very weak. However, phosphorylation of Crk-II on Tyr-221 which induces an intramolecular association with the SH2 domain, or addition of a phosphopeptide corresponding to the Crk-II Tyr-221 phosphorylation site, stimulated association of Crk-II with the Abl SH3 domain. NMR spectroscopic analysis showed that binding of the Tyr-221 phosphopeptide to the Crk SH2 domain induced a chemical shift change in Val-71, located in the proline-rich insert, indicative of a change in the structure of the proline-rich loop in response of Crk SH2-pTyr-221 interaction. These results suggest that the proline-rich insert in the Crk SH2 domain constitutes an SH3 domain-binding site that can be regulated by binding of a phosphopeptide ligand to the Crk SH2 domain.

https://openalex.org/W1507992882,"High level, anterior pituitary-specific expression of the rat growth hormone (rGH) promoter requires cooperative actions of several different transcription factors. Previously, we described a series of multisubunit, tissue-general, transcription factor complexes that bound to the GHF3 activation site and strongly regulated rGH promoter activity. A 43-kDa DNA-binding subunit common to each of the different GHF3 complexes is identified here as the transcription factor, CCAAT/Enhancer-binding Protein α (C/EBPα). In human monocyte U937 cells, which do not express the endogenous or transfected GH genes, co-expression of C/EBPα and Pit-1 synergistically activated the transfected rGH promoter. Full-length C/EBPα was present in the GH-secreting GC, and prolactin-secreting 235-1, pituitary cell lines, but not in GHFT1-5 cells, which are transformed at a stage in development immediately prior to GH expression. Transient expression of C/EBPα in GHFT1-5 cells strongly activated the co-transfected rGH promoter through the GHF3 binding site; a second activation site mapped to evolutionary conserved GH promoter sequences between −106 and −33. C/EBPα activation was synergistic with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and forskolin, activators of protein kinases C and A, respectively. Thus, C/EBPα is an important regulator of rGH promoter activity that appears to function in synergy with Pit-1, activators of A and C protein kinases and possibly other factors.

Promoter mutagenesis and transient transfection demonstrated that several different sequence elements are critical for rGH promoter activity. The nonadditive effects of those promoter mutants suggested that cooperation between those factors was crucial to the high level and pituitary-specific regulation of the rGH promoter (3Schaufele F. Imura H. The Pituitary Gland. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 91-116Google Scholar). The importance of these cooperative activities was underscored by studies showing that the rGH promoter could be strongly activated in nonpituitary cells (4Schaufele F. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Mol.

Thus, a detailed knowledge of the factors that bind to the rGH promoter and their cooperative and/or mutually disruptive activities will be required to understand the physiologic and ontologic regulation of GH transcription. rat GH growth hormone thyrotroph embryonic factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate chloramphenicol acetyltransferase growth hormone factor-3 D-binding protein. Previously, we identified a factor termed GHF3 that binds to rGH promoter sequences between −239 and −219 and is one of the strongest determinants of rGH promoter activity; promoter mutants that disrupted the GHF3 binding site reduced the activity of the rGH promoter transfected into GH-secreting rat pituitary GC cells by 75% (16Schaufele F. Cassill J.A. West B.L. Reudelhuber T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14592-14598Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift experiments showed that complexes of differing electrophoretic mobility bound to the GHF3 binding site and that the identical site was footprinted in each of those complexes (16Schaufele F. Cassill J.A. West B.L. Reudelhuber T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14592-14598Google Scholar). Two-dimensional gel mobility shift assays showed that each complex shared a DNA-binding subunit of similar electrophoretic mobility (16Schaufele F. Cassill J.A. West B.L. Reudelhuber T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14592-14598Google Scholar). Consistent with the presence of a common DNA-binding subunit, uv cross-linking of the different complexes to the GHF3 binding site demonstrated that each complex contained a DNA cross-linked factor of identical size, approximately 46 kDa (16Schaufele F. Cassill J.A. West B.L. Reudelhuber T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14592-14598Google Scholar). This agreed well with the predominant 43-kDa GHF3 DNA-binding subunit detected by a Southwestern blot using a radiolabeled GHF3 DNA binding site to probe crude GC cell extracts separated electrophoretically according to size (16Schaufele F. Cassill J.A. West B.L. Reudelhuber T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14592-14598Google Scholar). Thyrotroph embryonic factor (TEF), which binds to multiple sites within the promoter for the gene encoding the β-subunit of the thyroid-stimulating hormone, also bound to the rGH promoter over the GHF3 site (17Drolet D.W. Scully K.M. Simmons D.M. Wegner M. Chu K. Swanson L.T. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1739-1753Google Scholar). However, the 29.3-kDa size of TEF (17Drolet D.W. Scully K.M. Simmons D.M. Wegner M. Chu K. Swanson L.T. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1739-1753Google Scholar) does not agree well with the ∼43-kDa size of the predominant GHF3 DNA-binding subunit present in GC cells or even with other minor 35-, 58-, 72-, and 140-kDa GHF3-binding proteins detected by Southwestern blot (16Schaufele F. Cassill J.A. West B.L. Reudelhuber T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14592-14598Google Scholar). Given the importance of the GHF3 site, it was necessary to identify the factor that binds to it to understand the control of rGH expression. This factor was of additional interest because it is the DNA-binding subunit common to the array of alternate multisubunit GHF3 complexes. We demonstrate here, by antibody interference with gel mobility shift complexes and by Western blots of GHF3 factors purified by DNA affinity chromatography, that the GHF3 DNA-binding subunit contains C/EBPα. A role for C/EBPα in the pituitary-specific regulation of the GH gene was further supported by a number of observations: 1) C/EBPα and Pit-1 synergistically activated the rGH promoter in human monocyte U937 cells; 2) full-length C/EBPα was detected in extracts of GH-secreting GC cells and prolactin-secreting 235-1 cells but not in Pit-1-containing, GHFT1-5 pituitary progenitor cells transformed at a developmental stage prior to the expression of any mature pituitary hormones (18Lew D. Brady H. Klausing K. Yaginuma K. Theill L.E. Stauber C. Karin M. Mellon P.L. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 683-693Google Scholar); and 3) transient expression of C/EBPα in GHFT1-5 cells strongly activated a co-transfected rGH promoter, implying that C/EBPα may be limiting for rGH expression in these pituitary progenitor cells. 60% of the C/EBPα activation in GHFT1-5 cells required the GHF3 binding site, whereas the remaining activation required rGH promoter sequences between −106 and −33. rGH promoter activation by C/EBPα was synergistic with cultivating the GHFT1-5 cells with PMA and forskolin, activators of protein kinases C and A, respectively (19Nishizuka Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1983; 8: 13-16Google Scholar, 20Seamon K.B. Daly J.W. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1981; 7: 201-224Google Scholar) further demonstrating the importance of integrative functions in the regulation of high level rGH promoter activity. Thus, C/EBPα is an important factor regulating high level transcription of rGH promoter activity and appears to function in synergy with Pit-1, activators of protein kinases A and C, and possibly other factors through the GHF3 and secondary activation sites. Affinity-purified Pit-1 and 20 µg of nuclear extracts, prepared as described previously (21Schaufele F. West B.L. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17189-17196Google Scholar), were separated by discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted to nitrocellulose. GHF3 purified 600-fold by one round of DNA binding site affinity chromatography (16Schaufele F. Cassill J.A. West B.L. Reudelhuber T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14592-14598Google Scholar) was subjected to a second round of affinity purification and simultaneously blotted. Blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk powder and probed with the indicated primary antibodies. C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPγ polyclonal antibodies were a gift from W.-C. Yeh and S. L. McKnight (Tularik, South San Francisco). Anti-TEF antibodies were obtained from D. Drolet and M. G. Rosenfeld (University of California, San Diego), and anti-DBP antibodies were received from D. Lavery and U. Schibler (University of Geneva). Pit-1 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Berkeley Antibody Company (BAbCo). The blots were then probed with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (Amersham Corp. and Promega Corp., respectively) and developed using the ECL chemiluminescence solutions (Amersham). Gel mobility shift assays were conducted essentially as described previously (21Schaufele F. West B.L. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17189-17196Google Scholar) except that affinity-purified GHF3 (16Schaufele F. Cassill J.A. West B.L. Reudelhuber T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14592-14598Google Scholar) was first incubated for 15 min at room temperature with the indicated antibodies or nonimmune serum. Following preincubation, a radiolabeled 87-base pair fragment containing rGH promoter sequences between −285 and −198 that span the GHF3 site (−239 to −219), was added with or without 50 ng of a cold competitor oligonucleotide (−240 to −216) (16Schaufele F. Cassill J.A. West B.L. Reudelhuber T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14592-14598Google Scholar). pGHF1 and GHF2 control competitor oligonucleotides were previously described (11Schaufele F. West B.L. Reudelhuber T.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5235-5243Google Scholar). Because of nonspecific DNA binding activities in the nonimmune and C/EBPα-primed sera, 4 µg of poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) had to be added to each incubation. Poly(dI-dC) was added at the time of probe and oligonucleotide addition. The −237/+8 promoter and −230/−226 mutation thereof (see Fig. 6, mut/237) (16Schaufele F. Cassill J.A. West B.L. Reudelhuber T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14592-14598Google Scholar), the −106/+8 (8West B.L. Catanzaro D.F. Mellon S.A. Cattini P.A. Baxter J.D. Reudelhuber T.L. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1990; 265: 14592-14598Google Scholar) were previously described. +1 is the transcription start site. All rGH promoters were cloned upstream of the coding sequences of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene carried in a pUC vector deleted of sequences between AatII and EcoRI (4Schaufele F.

Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 405-407Google Scholar). Use of the modified pUC vector was critical, since the −33/+8 rGH promoter carried in the standard pUC was strongly activated by C/EBPα expression (data not shown), whereas parallel transfected −33/+8 promoters carried in the modified pUC vector were not (see Fig. 6, Fig. 7). Thus, there appears to be a C/EBPα activation site present in the standard pUC vector, but this site was eliminated in the experiments described here.Fig. 7GHF3 binding sites confer C/EBPα activation to the nonresponsive, −33/+8 rGH promoter.

Transfection was by electroporation using the Bio-Rad electroporation apparatus set at 960 microfarads and 0.3 V. The electroporation buffer consisted of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% glucose and 10 µg/ml of Biobrene Plus (Applied Biosystems Inc.). 5 µg of each promoter was co-transfected with 5 µg (see Fig. 6) or 10 µg (see Figs. 3, 4, 5) of a C/EBPα cDNA expression vector, 5 µg (see Fig. 4) or 10 µg (see Fig. 3) of a Pit-1 cDNA expression vector, or compensatory amounts of a control, empty (no cDNA inserted) expression vector. The amounts of C/EBPα and control expression vectors were varied in Fig. 7 as indicated. 1 µg of a firefly luciferase cDNA expressed under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter was co-transfected with each point. Transfected cells were induced the following day with 10−5 forskolin (Sigma) and 10−8 PMA or control delivery vehicles and collected 1 day after PMA and forskolin induction. CAT activity, luciferase activity, and protein amounts were determined for each extract. Luciferase activity normalized to the amount of extract protein was marginally increased by C/EBPα expression when GHFT1-5 cells were incubated with PMA and forskolin (2.0 ± 0.7-fold over 10 experiments) but not when incubated with control delivery vehicles (1.0 ± 0.4). CAT activities, derived from the rGH237 promoter and normalized to the amount of extract protein, were much more dramatically affected by C/EBPα expression (see Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). A minimum of three independent experiments (see figure legends for n) were normalized to the expression level of the rGH237 promoter activated by C/EBPα expression and PMA/forskolin incubation (100%) and presented as the percentage mean ± S.D.Fig. 4The rGH promoter is activated by C/EBPα expression in mouse pituitary progenitor cells.

Scully K.M. Simmons D.M. Wegner M. Chu K. Swanson L.T. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1739-1753Google Scholar) and TEF protein was capable of binding to the GHF3 site in the rGH promoter (17Drolet D.W. Scully K.M. Simmons D.M. Wegner M. Chu K. Swanson L.T. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1739-1753Google Scholar), the size of TEF is different from the size of the major GHF3-binding protein found in GC cells (16Schaufele F. Cassill J.A. West B.L. Reudelhuber T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14592-14598Google Scholar). We also did not detect TEF in Western blots (data not shown) of GHF3 DNA-binding subunit purified from GC cell extracts by GHF3 binding site affinity chromatography (16Schaufele F. Cassill J.A. West B.L. Reudelhuber T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14592-14598Google Scholar), although the lack of a Western signal with extracts from a variety of pituitary and nonpituitary cells limited the conclusion that no anti-TEF cross-reacting material is present in affinity-purified GHF3. TEF is a member of a large family of transcription factors, the bZIP proteins, that bind to similar DNA sequences and share homology in their DNA binding and dimerization domains (23Lee K.A. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 9-14Google Scholar, 24Wedel A. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 171-185Google Scholar). Since only the portions of TEF that were conserved with other bZIP proteins were necessary for binding to the GHF3 site (17Drolet D.W. Scully K.M. Simmons D.M. Wegner M. Chu K. Swanson L.T. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1739-1753Google Scholar), it was possible that the authentic GHF3 DNA-binding subunit was another bZIP factor. Western blots using polyclonal antibodies directed against a 42-kDa bZIP protein, C/EBPα (25Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. Adashi E.Y. Graves B.J. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 786-800Google Scholar, 26Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Google Scholar), detected an appropriately sized factor present in the GHF3-binding fractions enriched from GC cell extracts by DNA affinity chromatography (Fig. 1A, purified GHF3). 34- and 30-kDa proteins that cross-reacted with the C/EBPα antibody were also detected in the affinity-purified material. In contrast, C/EBPα antibodies did not cross-react with Pit-1 prepared from the same extracts by DNA affinity chromatography (purified Pit-1), although Pit-1 antibodies were cross-reactive with affinity-purified Pit-1 (Fig. 1B). Thus, C/EBPα co-purifies with GHF3 binding activity and is of a size consistent with the GHF3 DNA-binding factor detected by uv cross-linking and Southwestern analysis (16Schaufele F. Cassill J.A. West B.L. Reudelhuber T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14592-14598Google Scholar). To determine if C/EBPα merely co-purified with the binding activity or whether C/EBPα is an integral component of the GHF3 complex, we examined the effect of C/EBPα antibodies on GHF3 binding. Anti-C/EBPα antibodies inhibited the formation of the gel shift GHF3 complex formed with affinity-purified GHF3-binding factor (Fig. 2), whereas they did not affect the ability of affinity-purified Pit-1 to bind to DNA (data not shown). Nonimmune sera or polyclonal antibodies against other bZIP transcription factors including C/EBPγ (26Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Google Scholar), TEF (17Drolet D.W. Scully K.M. Simmons D.M. Wegner M. Chu K. Swanson L.T. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1739-1753Google Scholar), and DBP (27Mueller C.R. Maire P. Schibler U. Cell. 1990; 61: 279-291Google Scholar) did not affect the gel shifts. 2F. Schaufele, unpublished data. C/EBPα therefore co-purifies with the DNA-binding subunit of the multisubunit GHF3 complexes and is required for GHF3 factor binding to the GHF3 site. C/EBPα is present in a number of cell types in which the GH gene is not transcribed (28Birkenmeier E.H. Gwynn B. Howard S. Jerry J. Gordon J.I. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L.

Commun. 1995; 215: 106-113Google Scholar), yet the activity of the rGH promoter is strongly dependent upon the GHF3 binding site (16Schaufele F. Cassill J.A. West B.L. Reudelhuber T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14592-14598Google Scholar). The rGH promoter is inactive in human monocyte U937 cells but can be activated by Pit-1 and TR co-expression (4Schaufele F. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 656-665Google Scholar). The rGH promoter was also synergistically activated by the co-expression of C/EBPα and Pit-1 to a level that was 3.6 ± 0.3-fold greater than would be expected from the summation of the increases in activity from independent Pit-1 and C/EBPα expression (Fig. 3). Mutation of the GHF3 binding site abolished synergy (data not shown). In U937 cells, the rGH promoter activated by both Pit-1 and C/EBPα was 37.9 ± 12.9% as active as the Pit-1- and TR-activated promoter in parallel experiments, whereas the much weaker activations by independent TR or C/EBPα expression were equivalent (TR was 1.2-fold more active on average). The 72-125 mutation in Pit-1 that selectively reduces Pit-1 synergy with TR without affecting the intrinsic activation ability of Pit-1 (6Chang W. Zhou W. Baxter J.D. Theill L.E. Schaufele F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17733-17738Google Scholar) marginally reduced Pit-1 synergy with C/EBPα from 3.6- to 2.0-fold (Fig. 3). In contrast, the same mutation dramatically reduced Pit-1 synergy with TR from 10.2- to 3.0-fold in parallel experiments. Thus, there are some differences in the sequence requirements for Pit-1 synergy with C/EBPα or with TR. GHFT1-5 cells are an excellent cell line for studying the regulation of rGH gene expression, since they represent an embryonic pituitary cell type transformed during the developmental window in which Pit-1 is expressed prior to commitment to the GH-, TSH-, or PRL-secreting cell lineages (18Lew D. Brady H. Klausing K. Yaginuma K. Theill L.E. Stauber C. Karin M. Mellon P.L. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 683-693Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B).2 Therefore, factors other than Pit-1 expression must limit rGH expression in these cells. The 43-kDa C/EBPα species was not detectable in Western blots of GHFT1-5 extracts, although C/EBPα was observed in GC cells, prolactin-secreting 235-1 cells, and human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells (Fig. 1A). A 34-kDa factor that cross-reacted with the anti-C/EBPα antibody was detected in extracts from all three pituitary cell types (Fig. 1A), and a 30-kDa cross-reacting factor was detected in the GC and 235-1 cell extracts. Neither the 30- nor the 34-kDa species were detected in HeLa cell extracts (Fig. 1A). The wild type −237/+8 rGH promoter was weakly active when transfected into GHFT1-5 cells (Fig. 4). Co-expression of C/EBPα resulted in a 4.5-fold, on average (n = 9), enhancement of CAT activity expressed from the rGH promoter. In contrast, Pit-1 co-expression did not activate the rGH promoter and did not further enhance the C/EBPα-activated rGH promoter (Fig. 4). The Pit-1 expression vector is active in GHFT1-5 cells under these conditions, since its transfection strongly activates the prolactin promoter, 3K. Hassan and F. Schaufele, unpublished data. minimal promoters to which rGH Pit-1 binding sites are multimerized and appended (6Chang W. Zhou W. Baxter J.D. Theill L.E. Schaufele F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17733-17738Google Scholar), and even the −237/+8 rGH promoter, but only if TR is co-expressed and the transfected GHFT1-5 cells are incubated with PMA and forskolin (6Chang W. Zhou W. Baxter J.D. Theill L.E. Schaufele F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17733-17738Google Scholar). Since Pit-1 and TR activate the rGH promoter only in PMA- and forskolin-induced GHFT1-5 cells, the effect of PMA and forskolin on the activation of the rGH promoter by C/EBPα and/or Pit-1 was investigated. Incubation of C/EBPα-transfected GHFT1-5 cells with PMA and forskolin caused a 15.4-fold, on average (n = 9), enhancement of the rGH promoter, much greater than the sum of the 1.8- and 4.5-fold effects caused by independent PMA/forskolin incubation and C/EBPα activation, respectively (Fig. 4). Pit-1 did not enhance C/EBPα activation of the rGH promoter even when the GHFT1-5 cells were incubated with PMA and forskolin. Synergistic activation by C/EBPα and PMA/forskolin incubation was maximal when both protein kinase inducers were present (Fig. 5). C/EBPα activation after incubation with both PMA and forskolin was 1.8-fold higher than the sum of the increases by independent PMA and forskolin incubation over C/EBPα activation in the absence of PMA and forskolin. PMA was independently able to synergize with C/EBPα, albeit more poorly than when both PMA and forskolin were present. Point mutations disrupting the GHF3 binding site (16Schaufele F. Cassill J.A. West B.L. Reudelhuber T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14592-14598Google Scholar) in the −237/+8 promoter showed that 60% of the C/EBPα activation in GHFT1-5 cells, in either the presence or absence of Pit-1 or PMA/forskolin, required the GHF3 binding site (Fig. 6, compare wild type (wt/237) promoter with mutant (mut/237) promoter). Whereas the rGH promoter truncated to −106 was activated by C/EBPα expression to the same extent as the −237/+8 promoter mutated in the GHF3 binding site, the rGH promoter truncated to −33 was not activated by C/EBPα expression, even at high amounts of transfected C/EBPα expression vector (Fig. 7A). The −33/+8 promoter could be made strongly responsive (43.2-fold activation on average when co-transfected with 10 µg of c/EBPα expression vector) to C/EBPα by inserting six copies of the GHF3 binding site immediately upstream of it (Fig. 7B), demonstrating that the −33/+8 promoter was competent for C/EBPα activation. The GHF3 site is a major locus controlling the transcription of the rGH promoter and is bound by a series of different multisubunit complexes via a single, common DNA-binding subunit (16Schaufele F. Cassill J.A. West B.L. Reudelhuber T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14592-14598Google Scholar). As a first step toward elucidating the structures and activities of the different GHF3 complexes, we have determined in the following ways that the common DNA-binding subunit contains C/EBPα: C/EBPα co-fractionated with factors enriched greater than 600-fold in the minimal DNA-binding subunit of GHF3 (Fig. 1A); antibodies directed against C/EBPα disrupted GHF3 gel mobility shift complexes (Fig. 2) formed with affinity-purified GHF3; Southwestern blots previously identified the predominant GHF3-binding factor as having a molecular mass of 43 kDa (16Schaufele F. Cassill J.A. West B.L. Reudelhuber T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14592-14598Google Scholar), similar to the 42-kDa size of C/EBPα (25Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. Adashi E.Y. Graves B.J. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 786-800Google Scholar, 26Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A); and the GHF3 binding site contains strong similarity (Fig. 8) to an optimal, palindromic C/EBP binding site (31Shuman J.D. Vinson C.R. McKnight S.L. Science. 1990; 249: 771-774Google Scholar, 32Lamb P. McKnight S.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 417-422Google Scholar). C/EBPα is a member of the bZIP family of transcription factors, and the known ability of C/EBPα to heterodimerize with some other bZIP factors (26Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Google Scholar, 33Roman C. Platero J.S. Shuman J. Calame K. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1404-1415Google Scholar, 34Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F.

Current evidence suggests that C/EBPα is likely to be the only DNA-binding factor in the minimal DNA-binding subunit, since protein-DNA uv cross-linking of the minimal GHF3 DNA-binding subunit detected exclusively a 46-kDa cross-linked species (16Schaufele F. Cassill J.A. West B.L. Reudelhuber T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14592-14598Google Scholar). Similarly, Western blots of affinity-purified, GHF3 DNA-binding subunit probed with antibodies against the bZIP proteins DBP (27Mueller C.R. Maire P. Schibler U. Cell. 1990; 61: 279-291Google Scholar), TEF (17Drolet D.W. Scully K.M. Simmons D.M. Wegner M. Chu K. Swanson L.T. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1739-1753Google Scholar), and C/EBPγ (26Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Google Scholar) (data not shown) did not indicate that these factors co-purified with the GHF3 DNA-binding subunit. These antibodies also did not disrupt the gel shift complexes formed between affinity-enriched GHF3 and the GHF3 binding site (data not shown). It is possible that these or other bZIP proteins may oligomerize with C/EBPα to participate as other subunits of the higher order GHF3 complexes that did not co-purify with the DNA-binding subunit. Although no such C/EBP oligomers have been reported to date, oligomerization through leucine zippers has been demonstrated (37Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Google Scholar, 38Junius F.K. MacKay J.P. Bubb W.A. Jensen S.A. Weiss A.S. King G.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6164-6174Google Scholar). Further studies will be required to define the other subunits of the multisubunit GHF3 complexes. The relative lack of full-length (42-kDa) C/EBPα in pituitary progenitor GHFT1-5 cells compared with adult-derived GC or 235-1 pituitary tumor cells (Fig. 1), combined with the strong activation of the rGH promoter in GHFT1-5 cells by C/EBPα expression (Fig. 4), provided additional evidence for an important role of C/EBPα in the pituitary-specific expression of the rGH promoter. Previously reported distributions of C/EBPα RNA or protein in rats (28Birkenmeier E.H. Gwynn B. Howard S. Jerry J. Gordon J.I. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1146-1156Google Scholar), mice (28Birkenmeier E.H. Gwynn B. Howard S. Jerry J. Gordon J.I. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1146-1156Google Scholar, 29Kuo C.F. Xanthopoulos K.G. Darnell J.E. Development. 1990; 109: 473-481Google Scholar), or humans (30Antonson P. Xanthopoulos K.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 106-113Google Scholar) did not specifically include the pituitary gland. C/EBPα expression is associated with the terminally differentiated state in other tissues and has antiproliferative actions in some cells (39Umek R.M. Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 288-292Google Scholar, 40Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Darlington G.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4726-4733Google Scholar, 41Mischoulon D. Rana B. Bucher N.L. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2553-2560Google Scholar, 42Chandrasekaran C. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8871-8875Google Scholar, 43Lin F.-T. MacDougald O.A. Diehl A.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9606-9610Google Scholar), making it possible that C/EBPα expression promotes both rGH expression (Fig. 4) and concomitant differentiation into a nonproliferative cell type. Pituitary-specific activation of the rGH promoter by C/EBPα is likely to be dependent upon Pit-1 (Fig. 3), although the presence of both Pit-1 and C/EBPα in lactotroph 235-1 cells (Fig. 1) that do not express GH indicates a role for other factors. C/EBPα antibodies also cross-reacted with 30- and 34-kDa proteins present both in affinity-purified GHF3 and in extracts from the GC and 235-1 cells; only the 34-kDa species seemed to be present in GHFT1-5 cells (Fig. 1A). A 30-kDa C/EBPα variant originating from an internal translation initiation site within the C/EBPα mRNA has been described previously in mice, rats, and chickens (43Lin F.-T. MacDougald O.A. Diehl A.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9606-9610Google Scholar, 44Calkhoven C.F. Bouwman P.R. Snippe L. Ag G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5540-5547Google Scholar, 45Ossipow V. Descombes P. Schibler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8219-8223Google Scholar). This amino-terminal truncated, 30-kDa C/EBPα lacks the transcriptional activation functions (45Ossipow V. Descombes P. Schibler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8219-8223Google Scholar) and antiproliferative activity (43Lin F.-T. MacDougald O.A. Diehl A.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9606-9610Google Scholar) of C/EBPα but retains its DNA binding and dimerization domains, consistent with its purification by DNA affinity chromatography (Fig. 1A). The previously reported extinction of GH gene expression in fusions of GH-secreting GC cells and L-cells may involve factors binding to the GHF3 site (46Tripputi P. Guerin S.L. Moore D.D. Science. 1988; 241: 1205-1207Google Scholar), and it is possible that an altered balance of activating 42-kDa C/EBPα and inactive 30-kDa C/EBPα could contribute to this suppression. The origins and activity of the 34-kDa form have not been reported, and it may represent a pituitary-specific isoform of C/EBPα. Basal rGH promoter activity in GHFT1-5 cells was inhibited by a point mutation (Fig. 6, mut/237) that inhibits GHF3 factor binding, suggesting that GHFT1-5 cells contain an activating factor, possibly the 34-kDa C/EBPα variant, that binds to the GHF3 site. The same promoter mutation reduced, but did not eliminate, activation of the rGH promoter by ectopic C/EBPα expression in GHFT1-5 cells (Fig. 6). Because the promoter containing the GHF3 binding site mutation was still activated by C/EBPα, it was impossible to differentiate whether C/EBPα activation through the GHF3 binding site was a result of direct binding of C/EBPα to the GHF3 site or whether C/EBPα was binding to a separate site and merely synergizing with other GHF3-binding factors present in GHFT1-5 cells. C/EBPα activation of the −33/+8 rGH promoter truncated to contain little more than the TATA box was wholly GHF3 binding site-dependent (Fig. 7B), suggesting that C/EBPα activation can occur directly through the GHF3 binding site. Thus, it is likely that C/EBPα directly binds to the GHF3 site in vivo (Fig. 7) as well as in vitro (Fig. 1, Fig. 2) to cause the activation of the rGH promoter. The current data also suggest that C/EBPα participates, directly or indirectly, in the cAMP- and PMA-dependent effects on the rGH promoter. rGH promoter activation by C/EBPα was synergistic with incubating GHFT1-5 cells with PMA and forskolin, activators of protein kinases C and A, respectively (Figs. 4, 5, 6). GH expression is tightly regulated by the hypothalamic factor, growth hormone-releasing factor, through a cAMP intermediary (47Bilezikjian L.M. Vale M.M. Endocrinology. 1983; 113: 1726-1731Google Scholar, 48Barinaga M. Bilezikjian L.M. Vale W.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Nature. 1985; 314: 279-281Google Scholar). As forskolin increases the intracellular concentration of cAMP (20Seamon K.B. Daly J.W. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1981; 7: 201-224Google Scholar), it is possible that the effects of forskolin on rGH promoter activity may be mimicking the effects of growth hormone-releasing factor. Pit-1 is another target for PMA and forskolin action and is phosphorylated by both protein kinase A and C in vitro and in vivo (49Kapiloff M.S. Farkash Y. Wegner M. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1991; 253: 786-789Google Scholar). Forskolin activation of the rGH promoter has also been suggested to be Pit-1 binding site-dependent (50Dana S. Karin M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 815-821Google Scholar, 51Copp R.P. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 790-796Google Scholar), although this is difficult to ascertain given the dependence of the rGH promoter on the Pit-1 binding sites. Pit-1 mutated in its protein kinase A and C phosphorylation sites was 65% as effective as wild type Pit-1 at activating the rGH promoter (52Fischberg D.J. Chen X.H. Bancroft C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1566-1573Google Scholar), demonstrating that other rGH promoter-binding factors, possibly C/EBPα, contribute significantly to both protein kinase A and C activation. PMA and forskolin synergy with C/EBPα displayed components dependent upon both the GHF3 binding site and a second C/EBPα activation site that maps to between −106 and −33 (Fig. 6). The molecular nature of this secondary C/EBPα activation site is currently unknown, but since purified GHF3 did not bind to a rGH promoter fragment spanning sequences −106 to −15 (Fig. 2), it is not likely to be mediated directly through GHF3 factor binding at that site. We have also observed that C/EBPα expression activates the human GH promoter in GHFT1-5 cells and is synergistic with PMA and forskolin. 4K. Randhawa and F. Schaufele, unpublished data. We currently do not know if C/EBPα activation of the human promoter requires the homologous −106 to −33 sequences conserved between the rat and human promoters (53Miller W.L. Eberhardt N.L. Endocrine Rev. 1983; 4: 97-130Google Scholar). Thus, the GHF3 binding site strongly contributes to the control of the rGH promoter in GH-secreting pituitary cells derived from adult pituitary tumors (16Schaufele F. Cassill J.A. West B.L. Reudelhuber T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14592-14598Google Scholar) and probably in transgenic mice (54Lira S.A. Crenshaw III, E.B. Glass C.K. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4755-4759Google Scholar). The GHF3-binding factor, identified here as C/EBPα, synergizes with PMA and forskolin or with Pit-1 and strongly activates the rGH promoter in C/EBPα-deficient pituitary progenitor cells. The role of C/EBPα as the central, DNA-binding subunit of the multisubunit GHF3 complexes is also interesting given the unique architecture of the GHF3 complexes: a number of physiologic control mechanisms may impinge on this single factor and be integrated at this regulatory bottleneck. Determining the molecular nature of C/EBPα-interacting proteins in those higher order complexes will also be essential to understanding the central role of the GHF3 binding site and C/EBPα in the regulation of rGH promoter activity.

The phosphorylation of topo IIβ changes its apparent molecular mass determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis from 180 to 190 kDa in mitotic cells, whereas topo IIα affects it only slightly (Kimura, K., Nozaki, N., Saijo, M., Kikuchi, A., Ui, M., and Enomoto, T.

While its protein moiety remained intact, 75% of the phosphates attached to topo IIβ were removed within 4 h after release from mitotic block. On the other hand, 35% of topo IIα protein and 52% of the attached phosphates disappeared. We verified that M phase-specific phosphorylation had no particular effect on the catalytic activities of both topo II isoforms after extensive phosphatase digestion.

They are expressed somewhat tissue-specifically (20Tsutui K. Tsutui K. Okada S. Watanabe M. Shohmori T. Seki S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19076-19083Google Scholar, 21Taagepera S. Rao P.N. Drake F.H. Gorbsky G.J. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8407-8411Google Scholar) and differentially in the cell cycle (22Woessner R.D. Mattern M.R. Mirabelli C.K. Johnson R.K. Drake F.H. Cell Growth & Differ. 1991; 2: 209-214Google Scholar, 23Kimura K. Saijo M. Ui M. Enomoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1173-1176Google Scholar). Topo IIα is expressed predominantly in proliferating cells and is barely detectable in resting cells. The level of topo IIα reaches the maximum during the G2-M phase of the cell cycle while that of topo IIβ remains constant (22Woessner R.D. Mattern M.R. Mirabelli C.K. Johnson R.K. Drake F.H. Cell Growth & Differ. 1991; 2: 209-214Google Scholar, 23Kimura K. Saijo M. Ui M. Enomoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1173-1176Google Scholar). This suggests that each isoform has a different role in the cells. Both isoforms are phosphorylated in the cells in many species (24Rottmann M. Schröder H.C. Gramzow M. Renneisen K. Kurelec B.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24523-24526Google Scholar). Topo IIα is reported to be phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, with maximal phosphorylation in G2-M phase (26Heck M.M.S. Hittelman W.N. Earnshaw W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15161-15164Google Scholar, 30Saijo M. Ui M. Enomoto T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 359-363Google Scholar, 31Burden D.A. Goldsmith L.J. Sullivan D.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 297-304Google Scholar), and at specific sites of topo II protein, particularly in M phase (33Burden D.A. Sullivan D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14651-14655Google Scholar, 34Wells N.J. Hickson I.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 491-497Google Scholar). We reported that electrophoretic mobility of topo IIβ from mitotic cells differs from that isolated from interphase cells (23Kimura K. Saijo M. Ui M. Enomoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1173-1176Google Scholar) and that this is caused by M phase-specific phosphorylation (32Kimura K. Nozaki N. Saijo M. Kikuchi A. Ui M. Enomoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24523-24526Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of topo IIβ caused the dramatic change in its electrophoretic mobility from 180 kDa at interphase to an apparent molecular mass of 190 kDa at M phase (32Kimura K. Nozaki N. Saijo M. Kikuchi A. Ui M. Enomoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24523-24526Google Scholar, 33Burden D.A. Sullivan D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14651-14655Google Scholar), whereas the phosphorylation of topo IIα causes only a slight change in the mobility, resulting in the escape from our attention. The role of phosphorylation of topo II remains controversial. Some have reported that topo II activity is regulated by phosphorylation (35Cardenas M.E. Gasser S.M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 219-225Google Scholar), whereas Shiozaki and Yanagida (36Shiozaki K. Yanagida M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1023-1036Google Scholar) have reported that in fission yeast phosphorylation does not change the topo II activity itself. We also reported that phosphorylation has no effect upon the activity of topo IIα from mouse FM3A cells (37Kimura K. Saijo M. Tanaka M. Enomoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10990-10995Google Scholar). Besides the effect on the enzymatic activity, Vassetzky et al. (38Vassetzky Y.S. Dang Q. Benedetti P. Gasser S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6962-6974Google Scholar) suggest that phosphorylation by casein kinase II is required for the facilitated multimerization of topo II. However, little is known about the effect of phosphorylation of topo II in vivo. We analyzed the phosphorylation of topo II particularly in M phase, because that is when topo II is required for the condensation and segregation of chromosomes. In this report, we investigated the fate of phosphates when cells exit M phase, the effects of M phase-specific phosphorylation on the catalytic activities, and the association of two topo II isoforms with mitotic chromosomes. HeLa S3 cells were cultured at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagles' minimal essential medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin G potassium, 100 µg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 10% fetal bovine serum. HeLa S3 cells (4 × 106) were inoculated into 150-cm2 culture flasks containing 20 ml of the growth medium and incubated for 2 days. Aphidicolin was added to the culture at a final concentration of 3 µg/ml, and 16 h thereafter, the medium was discarded. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in fresh medium for another 8 h. The medium was replaced with Eagle's minimal essential medium for suspension culture containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.04 µg/ml nocodazole, and the cells were incubated for 4 h to accumulate mitotic cells. Mitotic cells were detached from the surface of the culture flask by vigorously shaking the flask horizontally, several times. The detached mitotic cells were collected by centrifugation. The mitotic index of the cells collected in this manner was over 85% and that of logarithmically growing (log phase) cells was below 3%. BALB/c mice were injected intraperitoneally three times at 14-day intervals with topo IIα or topo IIβ purified from HL60 cells or with the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthetic peptide, SDFPTEPPSLPRTGRARKE, that is located near the C terminus of the human topo IIβ sequence, in Freund's adjuvant. The fourth injection was given in the absence of adjuvant, and 3 days later the splenocytes were fused with the myeloma line P3-X63Ag8,653. The culture media were screened by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We confirmed by immunoblotting that the isolated clone, 8D2, produced antibody that specifically recognized topo IIα and that clones 5A7- and 3H10-produced antibodies that specifically recognized topo IIβ. Harvested cells were washed once with calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in buffer 1 (10 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 m MgCl2, 1 m EDTA, 10 m NaF, 10 m p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 0.05% Triton X-100 at a concentration of 2 × 107 cells/ml, and kept at 0°C for 20 min to be lysed. The nuclear fraction was precipitated by centrifugation for 5 min at 1,000 × g and washed with buffer 1. Nuclear extracts were prepared by suspending the nuclear fraction in 100 µl of buffer 1 containing 0.4 KCl and standing at 0°C for 30 min. The suspension was separated by centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 × g, and the supernatant was recovered. The nuclear extracts were mixed with 5 ml of protein G-Sepharose beads, which had been incubated with 200 µl of anti-topo II monoclonal antibody for 1 h at room temperature and washed with buffer 2 (50 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 KCl, 0.5% Triton X-100). The mixture was shaken for 2 h at 4°C, and the beads were washed five times with buffer 2 and twice with water. Proteins absorbed to the beads were extracted with 20 µl of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue by heating 95°C for 3 min, then the beads were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was resolved by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS. Harvested cells were washed once with calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 20 µl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer by boiling at 95°C for 3 min. The lysates were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS. After electrophoresis, the gel was soaked in Tris glycine buffer (0.1 Tris, 0.192 glycine) containing 20% methanol for 10 min. Proteins were transferred from the gel to a nitrocellulose membrane at 2 mA/cm2 for 45 min in the above buffer, using a semi-dry blotting apparatus. The membrane was washed once with TBS (50 m Tris, pH 7.4 and 150 m NaCl), soaked in TBS containing 1% skim milk for 1 h, incubated overnight with 50-fold diluted anti-topo II monoclonal antibody in TBS containing 1% skim milk, washed three times with TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and then incubated for 1 h with 1,000-fold diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) in TBS containing 1% skim milk. The membrane was washed three times with TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using a Konica Immunostaining HPR-1000 kit. Logarithmically growing HeLa cells were labeled essentially as described by Kroll and Rowe (27Kroll D.J. Rowe T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7957-7961Google Scholar), except that they were incubated for 4 h with 100 µCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (>5,000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) or 20 µCi/ml [35S]methionine (>1,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.) in phosphate-free or methionine-free medium, respectively. Mitotic cells were labeled essentially described by Kimura et al. (32Kimura K. Nozaki N. Saijo M. Kikuchi A. Ui M. Enomoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24523-24526Google Scholar), except that they were incubated for 4 h with 100 µCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate or 20 µCi/ml [35S]methionine in phosphate-free or methionine-free medium containing 0.04 µg/ml nocodazole, respectively. The mitotic cells were then collected as described above. The radiolabel chase experiment was initiated by washing the 32P- or 35S-labeled cells three times with radioisotope-free media containing 1 m sodium phosphate or 1 m methionine, respectively. Equal aliquots of these cells were then plated into 100-mm dishes containing the chase media, and at various times the cells were harvested. The harvested cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated as described above. Half of the lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-topo IIβ antibody, 3H10, and one-twentieth of the lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-topo IIα antibody, 8D2. The radioactivity was visualized and evaluated using an image analyzer (BAS 2000; Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). DNA topoisomerase II was assayed by measuring the relaxation of supercoiled DNA or unknotting activities using P4 phage DNA. The standard reaction mixture (20 µl) for the DNA relaxation assay consisted of 50 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 m KCl, 10 m MgCl2, 1 m ATP, 0.5 m dithiothreitol, 0.5 m Na3EDTA, 100 µg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 µg of supercoiled pUC19 DNA. The incubation proceeded at 30°C, and the reaction was stopped with 5 µl of stop solution containing 5% SDS, 25% Ficoll, and 0.05% bromphenol blue. The samples were incubated for 15 min at 50°C and then loaded onto a 0.8% agarose gel in TBE buffer (89 m Tris borate, pH 8.2, and 2 m EDTA). After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide and photographed under UV illumination. DNA unknotting activity was assayed as described above for the relaxing assay except that 0.1 µg of P4 knotted DNA was used as the substrate. Topoisomerase II was dephosphorylated using purified potato acid phosphatase (PAP) as described by Shiozaki and Yanagida (36Shiozaki K. Yanagida M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1023-1036Google Scholar). Harvested cells were washed once with calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline, then suspended with buffer 1 containing 1% Triton X-100 at a concentration of 2 × 107 cells/ml, and lysed at 0°C for 20 min. The lysate was centrifuged for 5 min at 1,000 × g. The supernatants were saved as the 1% Triton X-100-soluble fraction, and the precipitate was washed once with buffer 1 and recovered as nuclear fraction. The nuclear fraction was resuspended at a concentration of 2 × 107 nuclei/ml with buffer 1 containing 0.5 NaCl and placed at 0°C for 30 min with occasional gentle mixing. In the experiment extracting each isoform of topo II with varying concentrations of NaCl, nuclei or chromosomes were isolated by homogenizing with a Dounce homogenizer by 40 strokes to disrupt nuclear structure and recovered by centrifugation for 5 min at 1,800 × g. The disrupted nuclei from log phase cells or chromosomes from M phase cells were suspended at a concentration of 2 × 107 nuclei/ml in buffer 1 containing various concentrations of NaCl and placed at 0°C for 30 min with occasional gentle mixing. The suspensions were separated by centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 × g and then the supernatants were recovered as NaCl-soluble fractions and the pellets as precipitates at the indicated concentrations. Each fraction was boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the amount of topo II was measured by immunoblotting as described above. Anti-topo IIα antibody, 8D2, or anti-topo IIβ antibody, 5A7 (150 µg), was mixed with 100 µl of protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), shaken at room temperature for 4 h, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The beads were resuspended in 10 volumes of 0.2 sodium borate, pH 9.0, containing 20 m pipelimidic acid dimethyl ester dihydrochloride, and gently shaken for 30 min at room temperature in 0.2 ethanolamine, pH 8.0. The beads were stored in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.01% NaN3. We detected a change in the apparent molecular mass from 180 to 190 kDa in topo IIβ in mitotic cells (23Kimura K. Saijo M. Ui M. Enomoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1173-1176Google Scholar) and confirmed that it was caused by phosphorylation (32Kimura K. Nozaki N. Saijo M. Kikuchi A. Ui M. Enomoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24523-24526Google Scholar). To precisely understand the relationship between phosphorylation and the change in the electrophoretic mobility of two isoforms precisely, we examined the electrophoretic mobility and phosphorylation of the isoforms by means of immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation using monoclonal antibodies specific for topo IIα or topo IIβ (Fig. 1). Logarithmically growing (log phase cells) and M phase cells were directly lysed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Two isoforms were detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 1A). The anti-topo IIα antibody recognized a single band of 170 kDa in log phase cell lysates and two adjacent bands in the slightly higher range in mitotic cell lysates (Fig. 1A (a), lanes 1 and 2). Anti-topo IIβ recognized a single band of 180 kDa in log phase cell lysates and major and less intense bands at 190 and 185 kDa, respectively, in M phase cell lysates (Fig. 1A (b), lanes 1 and 2). The change in the electrophoretic mobility of topo IIα in mitotic cells was small and half of the population remained unchanged. Most of the topo IIβ band moved from 180 to around 190 kDa. A small quantity of an intermediate band was found in M phase, yet the molecular weight range was higher than that in log phase cells. Nuclear extracts from log and M phase cells were immunoprecipitated using anti-topo IIα or anti-topo IIβ antibodies, and precipitates were digested with potato acid phosphatase (PAP) or heat-inactivated PAP as a control and then resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining (Fig. 1B). In parallel, the same experiments were performed using the cells labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and visualized using an image analyzer (Fig. 1C). Both isoforms of topo II incorporated 32P in log phase and M phase cells (Fig. 1C, lane 1), and most of it disappeared upon digestion with PAP (Fig. 1C, lane 2); on the other hand the 32P label was not affected by incubating with heat-inactivated PAP (Fig. 1C, lane 3). The electrophoretic mobility of two isoforms from log phase cells scarcely changed after digestion with PAP (Fig. 1B (a) (c)). Topo IIα from M phase cells changed electrophoretic mobility only slightly (Fig. 1B (b)), whereas topo IIβ from M phase cells changed it from 190 to 180 kDa after digesting with PAP (Fig. 1B (d)). This shows that M phase-specific phosphorylation affected the electrophoretic mobility of topo II, particularly that of topo IIβ. The anti-topo IIβ monoclonal antibody, 3H10, precipitated a 170-kDa band in addition to topo IIβ from extracts prepared from log phase and mitotic cells. We examined the 170-kDa band by immunoblotting (Fig. 2). Immunoprecipitated materials using anti-topo IIβ monoclonal antibody, 3H10, were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then immunoblotted with anti-topo IIα monoclonal antibody, 8D2, or anti-topo IIβ monoclonal antibody, 3H10 or 5A7. The anti-topo IIα antibody recognized the 170-kDa band (lane 2), and the anti-topo IIβ antibodies recognized the upper bands (lanes 3 and 4). These results showed that 3H10 precipitates topo IIα in addition to topo IIβ. Mitotic cells were inoculated and harvested at the indicated times. Fig. 3A shows immunoblots using a monoclonal antibody against topo IIα (a) or topo IIβ (b). The electrophoretic mobility was slightly changed in topo IIα, but the mobility of the topo IIβ band was changed from 190 to 180 kDa, in parallel with the decline in the mitotic index. Using M phase cells labeled with [35S]methionine (Fig. 3B) or [32P]orthophosphate (Fig. 3C), we examined the turnover of topo II protein, and phosphates attached to it were examined. Fig. 3D shows the degradation curves of topo II protein and phosphates attached to each isoform. Thirty-five percent of the topo IIα and 52% of the attached phosphates disappeared within 4 h after release from an M phase block (Fig. 3D (a)). This showed that 26% of the attached phosphates per topo IIα protein was removed during the period. On the other hand, most of the topo IIβ escaped degradation, but 75% of the attached phosphates disappeared during the same period (Fig. 3D (b)), indicating that 75% of phosphates per topo IIβ protein were removed during this period. The removal of phosphates attached to topo IIβ was prominent in the first 2 h after release from M phase, as the mitotic index dropped from 87 to 5%. These results indicated that phosphates are effectively removed from topo IIβ protein during the transition from M to G1 phase, whereas that from topo IIα is relatively small. The turnover of protein and phosphate of each topo II isoform in log phase cells was also examined (Fig. 4) as described by Kroll and Rowe (27Kroll D.J. Rowe T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7957-7961Google Scholar). The amounts of [35S]methionine-labeled topo II (Fig. 4A) and attached [32P] (Fig. 4B) are shown in Fig. 4C. The half-life of topo IIα was about 25 h and that of the attached phosphates was about 12 h (Fig. 4C (a)). The topo IIβ was more stable, with a half-life of over 40 h, but attached phosphates disappeared rapidly, with a half-life of about 10 h (Fig. 4C (b)). When the 32P label was corrected for loss due to the degradation of topo II protein, the decay curves for phosphates attached to topo II became those shown in Fig. 4D. The half-lives of phosphates attached to topo IIα and topo IIβ were about 20 and 13 h, respectively. We examined the effect of phosphorylation of topo II in the M phase upon the activity of topo IIα (Fig. 5) and topo IIβ (Fig. 6). Topo IIβ was depleted from M phase extracts with an anti-topo IIβ column, and the depleted extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-topo IIα monoclonal antibody, 802. The precipitated materials were digested with PAP or heat-inactivated PAP as a control. Fig. 5A shows the silver staining of precipitated materials, indicating that topo IIα preparation is free from topo IIβ. The topo II activity of the precipitated materials was tested using pUC19 DNA (Fig. 5B) or P4-knotted DNA as a substrate (Fig. 5C). The DNA relaxing and unknotting activities of topo IIα did not change after dephosphorylation with PAP. In a similar experiment, the activity of topo IIβ was examined. Topo IIα was depleted from M phase extracts with a column containing an anti-topo IIα, and then the topo IIα-depleted M phase extracts were immunoprecipitated with the anti-topo IIβ monoclonal antibody, 3H10. The precipitated materials were digested with PAP or heat-inactivated PAP. The silver staining of the precipitated materials shows that the topo IIβ preparation is free from topo IIα (Fig. 6A). By digesting with PAP, the doublet bands of topo IIβ, around 190 kDa, disappeared and a 180-kDa single band appeared (Fig. 6A, lane 2), whereas the mobility of topo IIβ did not change in the control experiment using heat-inactivated PAP (Fig. 6A, lane 3). The DNA relaxing (Fig. 6B) and DNA unknotting activity (Fig. 6C) of topo IIβ did not change after dephosphorylation with PAP. In a similar experiment using the topo IIβ monoclonal antibody, 5A7, the topo II activity did not change regardless of dephosphorylation with PAP (data not shown).Fig. 6Effect of M phase phosphorylation of topo IIβ on its catalytic activity. A, topo IIα was depleted from nuclear extracts prepared from mitotic cells (5 × 106) using a column containing anti-topo IIα, and the topo IIα-depleted extracts were immunoprecipitated with the anti-topo IIβ antibody, 3H10, and the precipitates were digested with PAP or heat-inactivated PAP. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. Lane 1, precipitates with no treatment; lane 2, precipitates digested with PAP; lane 3, precipitates digested with heat-inactivated PAP. B, M phase precipitates (from 7 × 105 cells) were digested with PAP (a) or heat-inactivated PAP (b) and incubated with 0.1 µg of pUC19 DNA in the medium for topo II assay. The topo II reaction was stopped at the indicated times. Lane 1, 0 min; lane 2, 1 min; lane 3, 2 min; lane 4, 4 min; lane 5, 8 min; lane 6, 15 min; lane 7, 30 min. C, same as B except that 0.1 µg of P4 knotted DNA was used as the substrate DNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Whole cell extracts, 1% Triton X-100-soluble fraction, and 0.5 NaCl soluble fraction prepared from log and M phase cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using anti-topo IIα (Fig. 7A (a)) and anti-topo IIβ monoclonal antibody (Fig. 7A (b)). About 75% of the proteins in log phase cells and 90% of those in M phase were extracted with 1% Triton X-100, but neither isoform of topo II was present in this extract (Fig. 7A, lanes 2 and 5). Both isoforms were almost completely extracted with 0.5 NaCl in buffer 1 (compare lanes 1 and 3, 4 and 6). These results indicated that both isoforms bind to nuclei or mitotic chromosomes and are extracted by 0.5 NaCl. The disrupted nuclei prepared from log phase cells (Fig. 7B) or chromosomes from M phase cells (Fig. 7C) were extracted with various concentrations of NaCl, and then the supernatants and pellets were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using anti-topo IIα (a) or anti-topo IIβ monoclonal antibody (b). The intensity of bands was measured with a densitometer to quantify the amount of topo II (c). Both isoforms were extracted almost equally from log phase cells (Fig. 7B (c)). On the other hand, topo IIβ was extracted with lower concentrations of NaCl from M phase chromosomes than topo IIα (Fig. 6C (c)). About 62% of topo IIβ protein was extracted by 0.15 NaCl, whereas only 17% of topo IIα was extracted. Mammalian cells express two isoforms of topo II (topo IIα and topo IIβ) that exist as phosphoproteins. Topo IIα is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner (26Heck M.M.S. Hittelman W.N. Earnshaw W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15161-15164Google Scholar, 30Saijo M. Ui M. Enomoto T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 359-363Google Scholar, 31Burden D.A. Goldsmith L.J. Sullivan D.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 297-304Google Scholar), and specific sites of topo IIα are phosphorylated during the M phase (33Burden D.A. Sullivan D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14651-14655Google Scholar, 34Wells N.J. Hickson I.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 491-497Google Scholar). We showed that the electrophoretic mobility of topo IIβ reduced (23Kimura K. Saijo M. Ui M. Enomoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1173-1176Google Scholar) by phosphorylation in the M phase (32Kimura K. Nozaki N. Saijo M. Kikuchi A. Ui M. Enomoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24523-24526Google Scholar). The mobility change of topo IIα in the M phase was relatively small compared with that of topo IIβ (Fig. 1). The kinase that phosphorylates topo II in mammalian cells has not been definitely identified. It has been suggested that casein kinase II phosphorylates topo II in yeast and Drosophila cells (25Ackerman P. Glover C.V.C. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12653-12660Google Scholar, 29Cardenas M.E. Dang Q. Glover C.V.C. Gasser S.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1785-1796Google Scholar). However, reacting the two isoforms with casein kinase II did not affect their electrophoretic mobility (data not shown), indicating that the kinases that phosphorylate topo IIα and/or topo IIβ in M phase are different. An analysis of the turnover of topo II protein and the attached phosphates during the transition from M phase to G1 phase (Fig. 3), we demonstrated that both isoforms were dephosphorylated during this period and that the dephosphorylation rate of topo IIβ was higher than that of topo IIα. The turnover of topo II protein and attached phosphates in log phase cells were examined (Fig. 4) as described by Kroll and Rowe (27Kroll D.J. Rowe T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7957-7961Google Scholar). Topo IIα protein was relatively stable, with a half-life of about 25 h, whereas that of attached phosphates was about 20 h. These were comparable with the reported values (27 and 17 h, respectively) (27Kroll D.J. Rowe T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7957-7961Google Scholar). However, 35% of topo IIα was degraded within 4 h of the transition from M to G1 phase, indicating that topo IIα degraded rapidly in this period of the cell cycle. The change of topo II stability during the cell cycle has also been found in chicken cells (26Heck M.M.S. Hittelman W.N. Earnshaw W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15161-15164Google Scholar). Topo IIβ, which is expressed constantly during the cell cycle (22Woessner R.D. Mattern M.R. Mirabelli C.K. Johnson R.K. Drake F.H. Cell Growth & Differ. 1991; 2: 209-214Google Scholar, 23Kimura K. Saijo M. Ui M. Enomoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1173-1176Google Scholar), was remarkably stable with a half-life much longer than 40 h and was stable during the transition from M phase to G1 phase. In contrast, the phosphates attached to topo IIβ were relatively unstable even in log phase cells, and the half-life was about 13 h. The monoclonal antibody, 3H10, which specifically recognized topo IIβ in Western blotting, precipitated topo IIα as well as topo IIβ (Fig. 2). This phenomenon may be explained as follows. One is that the anti-topo IIβ antibody cross-reacts with topo IIα under the conditions of immunoprecipitation. The other is that topo IIα and topo IIβ homodimers form a higher order complex in the cells or during the preparation of extracts, after which the anti-topo IIβ antibody precipitates a fraction of topo IIα along with topo IIβ. We examined whether the M phase-specific phosphorylation of topo IIα and topo IIβ affects their activity. Both topo II isoforms were dephosphorylated with PAP, and their activities were compared with those of phosphorylated enzymes. The activities of the two isoforms did not change after dephosphorylation (Fig. 5, Fig. 6), indicating that M phase-specific phosphorylation exerts no effect on the activity of either isoform, at least under our experimental conditions. The possibility that the binding of antibody to topo II cancels the effect of phosphorylation on topo II activity seems unlikely because similar results were obtained using different antibodies that recognize different epitopes. Thus M phase-specific phosphorylation does not regulate the activity of topo II. We examined the binding of each isoform of topo II to interphase nuclei or mitotic chromosomes. Neither topo IIα nor topo IIβ was extracted with 1% Triton X-100 from interphase and M phase cells, suggesting that both isoforms bind to nuclei or chromosomes. Topo IIα and topo IIβ were extracted with NaCl at almost an equal efficiency from disrupted nuclei (Fig. 7B). These results are somewhat different from those of NIH 3T3 cells (22Woessner R.D. Mattern M.R. Mirabelli C.K. Johnson R.K. Drake F.H. Cell Growth & Differ. 1991; 2: 209-214Google Scholar). It has been reported that the extraction of topo IIβ requires slightly higher concentrations of NaCl than topo IIα from NIH 3T3 nuclei. Topo IIβ was extracted from M phase chromosomes at lower concentrations of NaCl than topo IIα (Fig. 7C). Zini et al. (39Zini N. Martelli A.M. Sabatelli P. Santi S. Negri C. Ricotti G.C.B.A. Maraldi N.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 460-466Google Scholar) have reported that topo IIβ localizes in the nucleolus and topo IIα in the nucleoplasm. Thus, the disintegration of nucleolar structure in M phase may affect the solubility of topo IIβ, although Petrov et al. (40Petrov P. Drake F.H. Loranger A. Huang W. Hancock R. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 204: 73-81Google Scholar) have reported that the both isoforms are present in the nucleoplasm and nucleolus. Thus, it also seems possible that the different phosphorylation states of the isoforms affect their binding to chromosomes."

Horseradish peroxidase conjugated to goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody was procured from Bangalore Genei (Bangalore, India). Fetuin, neuraminidase, and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The Escherichia coli strains used for expression and mutagenesis were NM522, TG1, and CJ236. The mutants were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of the expression plasmid of PNA (27Sharma V. Surolia A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 148: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) using the method of Kunkel et al. (28Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A.

The synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-ACGACCGCCATTGGAGCCGGA-3′ and 5′-ATCTGACGACCGCCGGCGGAGCCGGAGGC-3′, complementary to the sense strand with mismatches (shown underlined) at the nucleotides corresponding to Leu-212 of PNA, were used to generate mutants L212N and L212A, respectively. The changes result in the concomitant loss of a StyI site in both mutants and the appearance of a new NaeI site in the L212A mutant. Mutations were confirmed by complete sequencing of the clones using the Sequenase DNA sequencing kit (Version 2.0) from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Standard recombinant DNA techniques (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were utilized if not otherwise indicated. Wild-type and mutant PNAs were expressed as described previously (27Sharma V. Surolia A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 148: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), except that purification of guanidine-solubilized protein under denaturing conditions using the His.Tag affinity on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin preceded refolding. The lectin thus purified appeared as a single peak corresponding to the molecular mass of tetrameric PNA when subjected to gel filtration. Hemagglutination and inhibition procedures were as described previously (27Sharma V. Surolia A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 148: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The minimum concentration of the lectin that gave complete hemagglutination was used to compare the lectin activity, and the minimum concentrations of the saccharide required for complete hemagglutination inhibition by 3 µg/ml lectin for the sugars were compared. The binding assay was as described earlier for the 14-kDa β-galactoside-binding human lectin (30Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23648-23653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Costar serocluster enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate was coated with asialofetuin (20 µg/well) overnight at 4°C. After blocking the wells with 1% bovine serum albumin, the lectins (500 ng/well) were allowed to interact for 1 h at room temperature in the presence of varying concentrations of different carbohydrate inhibitors. The bound lectin was quantified by a double-antibody method using anti-PNA IgG as the primary antibody and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase as the secondary antibody. Each step was followed by three washes with Tris-buffered saline, and after the final wash, the plates were developed using tetramethyl benzidene/H2O2 as substrate and read at 450 nm on a BIOTEK EL 311 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. The concentration of sugar required for 50% inhibition (IC50) was calculated, taking the quantity of lectin bound in the absence of inhibitor as 100%. The IC50 values reported below and in Table II are averages of three independent experiments. The crystal structure determination of PNA by us (31Banerjee R. Mande S.C. Ganesh V. Das K. Dhanaraj V. Mahanta S.K. Suguna K. Surolia A. Vijayan M.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) revealed that the four identical subunits have the same jelly-roll tertiary structure, but that they associate in the most unusual fashion, giving rise to an open quarternary structure unknown in any tetrameric protein thus far. The complex of the lectin with lactose, now available at a high resolution (32Banerjee R. Das K. Ravishankar R. Suguna K. Surolia A. Vijayan M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), shows that the interaction is mediated through nine hydrogen bonds (Fig. 1) with amino acid residues in the four loops constituting the carbohydrate-binding site of legume lectins. These include Asp-83, Gly-104, and Asn-127, which are highly conserved in legume lectins, as well as Asp-80, Ser-211, and Gly-213, which are unique to PNA. In addition, the conserved Tyr-125 stacks against the terminal galactose ring. Yet another invariant residue is Ala-82, the peptide bond succeeding which adopts a cis-conformation in all legume lectins. This is known to be crucial for properly orienting Asp-83, which is a key binding site residue. Even a conservative replacement at most of these positions drastically affects the sugar binding of PNA. 2V. Sharma and A. Surolia, unpublished observations. In the absence of the x-ray structures of PNA complexed with either LacNAc or T-antigen, we analyzed the PNA-lactose complex to identify those residues around the binding pocket that do not make direct contact with lactose, but could bind to LacNAc or T-antigen. One such residue is Leu-212, the side chain of which extends at the brim of the variable edge of the binding pocket in PNA. The backbone atoms of the loop carrying Leu-212 are close to the glucopyranoside ring of the lactose in the structure. The 2′-OH of this ring, the position at which Lac differs from LacNAc by the absence of bulky N-acetamido group, does not make any contact with the lectin, but is 4.1-4.4 Å from the atoms of the Leu-212 side chain. This implies that the leucyl side chain would be in close proximity to the acetamido group on binding to LacNAc. The accommodation of this large group on binding to LacNAc would therefore necessitate conformational rearrangement of the loop containing Leu-212. This could involve displacement of the loop away from the GlcNAc ring of LacNAc, facilitated by the conformational flexibility of two consecutive glycines after Leu-212 with the consequent restructuring of the hydrogen bonds. The possible sacrifice of the interaction between the backbone amide of Gly-213 and the 3′-OH in the process could in effect or partly explain the observed lower affinity of PNA for LacNAc in comparison with that for Lac (34Goulut-Chassaing C. Decastel M. Tran A.T. Tabary F. Bourrillon R. Biochimie (Paris). 1992; 74: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The additional hydrophobic stabilization that might accrue due to interactions between the acetamido group and the leucyl side chain might not be large enough to compensate for the disruption referred to above. The conformation of the nonreducing sugar residue in LacNAc (or Lac) and T-antigen is identical. However, due to differences in their glycosidic linkages (β1-4 in LacNAc compared with β1-3 in T-antigen), the orientation of the reducing sugar residue with respect to the nonreducing one is not the same in these disaccharides (Fig. 2). Consequently, the C-2 substituent of the reducing sugar residue of LacNAc occupies a position equivalent to that of the hydroxymethyl (6′-OH) group in the corresponding sugar residue of T-antigen. Thus, T-antigen would require neither a large conformational readjustment of the binding site nor a hydrophobic environment in this region. The higher affinity of T-antigen, known to be facilitated by the presence of an acetamido group, is perhaps determined by additional interactions with a different region of the binding pocket. The initial analysis of the combining site in the PNA-lactose complex clearly implicated Leu-212 as a residue with significant proclivity to discriminate among the disaccharides binding to PNA. Any alteration in Leu-212 would seem to influence only the substituents at the 2′-OH of Lac or the 6′-OH of T-antigen. A smaller aliphatic amino acid instead of leucine would seem to prefer the binding of sugars with the bulkier acetamido group in the above positions, whereas a longer hydrophilic residue in the same place would prohibit substitution by large nonpolar groups. Therefore, we decided to characterize the two mutants generated by replacing Leu-212 with alanine and asparagine in bacterially produced PNA (27Sharma V. Surolia A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 148: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Alanine was an obvious choice for exploring the steric role of the longer leucyl side chain, and asparagine, being a hydrophilic residue closest in size to leucine, was ideal for studying the influence of the hydrophobic environment. Upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the purified L212A and L212N mutants showed a single band that comigrated with recombinant PNA. They exhibited similar hemagglutinating activity compared with wild-type PNA, as shown in Table I. The mutations did not affect the affinity of the lectin for sialylated T-antigen or galactose, which was evident from their ability to agglutinate only desialylated rabbit erythrocytes, which have the terminal galactose residues exposed on the surface. Hemagglutination inhibition experiments confirmed that the affinity of lectins for monosaccharides like galactose and galactosamine is impervious to the alterations in Leu-212, whereas it varies for the disaccharides lactose and T-antigen (Table I). This is expected as Leu-212 is too far from the primary binding site to influence the binding. The hemagglutination inhibition experiments indicated an improved potency of lactose to inhibit L212N, while LacNAc and T-antigen were inactive toward L212N and L212A, respectively. Both mutants reacted with the polyclonal anti-PNA antibody and bound to immobilized asialofetuin, as did wild-type PNA. The carbohydrate specificity and binding affinities were therefore further examined by assaying the binding of the lectins to asialofetuin in the presence of varying amounts of sugar inhibitors using a solid-phase microtiter plate assay (Fig. 3). The data were normalized with respect to the values obtained in the absence of sugar. All the sugars that gave complete inhibition exhibited a sigmoidal curve for the percentage binding as a function of the log of the sugar concentration. The concentration at which 50% inhibition was achieved (IC50) was used to compare the binding affinities of the different sugars. The results of the asialofetuin binding assay (Table II) confirmed that the mutations of Leu-212 do not alter the affinity for monosaccharide ligands such as galactose. Most interestingly, mutant L212N does not bind LacNAc at concentrations as high as 80 m, i.e. even at 20 times the IC50 of wild-type PNA. The presence of the asparaginyl side chain, however, seems to improve the binding to lactose, which then had a 3-fold lower IC50. T-antigen, which binds wild-type PNA with an IC50 of ∼0.1 m, exhibits a comparable affinity (IC50 = 0.09 m) for L212N. The increase in the binding constant for lactose suggests improved association with the lectin, probably mediated by additional interaction between the asparaginyl side chain and the 2′-OH of the glucopyranoside ring. Following the same rationale, non-binding of LacNAc is apparently a result of disruption of the favorable interaction between its acetamido group and the hydrophobic side chain of leucine by the asparagine residue at the equivalent position. The other mutant, L212A, shows pronounced affinity for LacNAc, with the IC50 value improving by 8-fold in contrast to that for lactose, which is not altered appreciably. Thus, the replacement of leucine by an amino acid with a shorter aliphatic chain (alanine) facilitates the binding of LacNAc, while its substitution by a polar residue of nearly equivalent size (asparagine) compromises the binding. Surprisingly, however, L212A interacts very poorly with T-antigen, and we failed to observe >35% inhibition even at concentrations as high as 20 m. Considering that wild-type PNA has an IC50 of 0.1 m, the mutation L212A leads to >100-fold deterioration of the binding affinity of the lectin for the T-hapten. This underlines the subtle differences in the binding of lactose and T-antigen with PNA. Moreover, both mutants did not interact with either GalNAc (100 m) or sialylated T-antigens (NeuAcα2-3Galβ1-3GalNAc and NeuAcα2-3Galβ1-3(NeuAcα2-6)GalNAc, at 5 m each). Since fetuin contains both N- and O-linked chains, specificities of the mutant and wild-type PNAs were also examined by their reactivities toward asialo-orosomucoid (α-acid glycoprotein), which contains only N-linked glycan. An equimolar concentration of asialo-orosomucoid exhibits about 48, 0-5, and 157% activity compared with fetuin for wild-type PNA, L212N, and L212A, respectively. This is qualitatively consistent with the ligand inhibition data, further confirming the enhancement in the anti-T-antigen specificity of L212N and that of L212A for N-acetyllactosamine. Thus, it appears that Leu-212 is a residue at a position critical for discriminating the carbohydrate recognition in PNA. The two mutants L212N and L212A exhibit differential and almost complementary specificity for the two PNA ligands (Fig. 4). The L212N mutant shows no binding to LacNAc and displays exquisite T-antigen specificity, while L212A interacts extremely poorly with T-antigen and recognizes LacNAc with greater efficacy. In conclusion, we have been able to modify the specificity of PNA for LacNAc and T-antigen by rational site-directed mutagenesis. Our data show that, by subtle manipulations in the more hypervariable loop (7Young N.M. Oomen R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 924-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) of the binding site of a legume lectin, one could achieve meaningful alterations in specificity and that residues other than the ones that make primary contact with the saccharide are important in influencing the lectin specificity. Owing to their ability to differentiate between complex carbohydrates based on subtle variations, plant lectins are extensively used as probes for cell-surface receptor sites. It is for this reason that the plant lectins, although first used as tools in the beginning of the century, continue to play a central role in immunology, cancer biology, etc., and their importance has not been affected by the advent of newer technologies. Our results give us grounds to believe that engineering lectins to further improve specificities would lead to the development of better tools for carbohydrate recognition.

To examine the effects of PAK I on cleavage arrest, subfemtomole amounts of endogenously active (58 kDa) and inactive (60 kDa) PAK I and a tryptic peptide (37 kDa) containing the active catalytic domain were injected into one blastomere of 2-cell frog embryos. Active PAK I resulted in cleavage arrest in the injected blastomere at mitotic metaphase, whereas the uninjected blastomere progressed through mid- to late cleavage. Injection of other protein kinases at similar concentrations had no effect on cleavage. Endogenous PAK I was highly active in frog oocytes, and antibody to PAK I reacted specifically with protein of 58-60 kDa. PAK I protein was decreased at 60 min post-fertilization, with little or no PAK I protein or activity detectable at 80 min post-fertilization or in 2-cell embryos. At the 4-cell stage PAK I protein increased, but the protein kinase was present primarily as an inactive form. Rac2 and Cdc42, but not Rac 1, were identified in oocytes and throughout early embryo development. Thus, PAK I appears to be a potent cytostatic protein kinase involved in maintaining cells in a non-dividing state. PAK I activity is high in oocytes and appears to be regulated by degradation/synthesis and through autophosphorylation via binding of Cdc42.

To identify its role in frog retina, first s26 was purified to nearly homogeneity with three chromatographical steps. Based on the partial amino acid sequences of the proteolysed fragments of s26, we isolated cDNAs that encode s26. The analysis of its amino acid sequence revealed that s26 is an S-modulin-like protein, while it shows higher homology to visinin. Visinin is a Ca2+-binding protein reported to be present in chicken cones, but its localization in the retina had been a subject in dispute. The present study showed that s26 is present in cone photoreceptors. The study also showed that s26 inhibits phosphorylation of rhodopsin after a light flash at high Ca2+ concentrations as S-modulin does. From these results, we concluded that s26 is a cone homologue of S-modulin. The result is consistent with the idea that each type of photoreceptors expresses each cell-type specific version of phototransduction proteins.

Ka values were significantly higher when these mAbs were tested with dsDNA as compared with the 83-100 dimer. Further higher Ka values were measured with mononucleosomes containing DNA and histones. It is proposed that these four mAbs are directed against a topographic determinant formed by DNA and the region 83-100 of H3 present as a dimer at the surface of nucleosome, and that they react, although significantly less well, with DNA and peptide dimer tested separately.

https://openalex.org/W2049701004,"A long-standing conundrum of glucocorticoid receptors has been why the steroid binding domain is active in hybrid proteins but not in isolation. For this reason, the precise boundaries of the steroid binding domain have not been defined. These questions have now been systematically examined with a variety of receptor deletion constructs. Plasmids encoding amino acids 537-673 and 537-795 of the rat receptor did not yield stable proteins, while the fusion of receptor or non-receptor sequences upstream of 537-673 afforded stable proteins that did not bind steroid. Wild type steroid binding affinity could be obtained, however, when proteins such as β-galactosidase or dihydrofolate reductase were fused upstream of receptor amino acids 537-795. Studies of a series of dhfr/receptor constructs with deletions at the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends of the receptor sequence localized the boundaries of the steroid binding domain to 550-795. The absence of steroid binding upon deletion of sequences in the carboxyl-terminal half of this domain was consistent with improperly folded receptor sequences. This conclusion was supported by analyses of the proteolysis and thermal stability of the mutant receptors. Thus, three independent regions appear to be required for the generation of the steroid binding form of receptors: 1) a protein sequence upstream of the steroid binding domain, which conveys stability to the steroid binding domain, 2) sequences of the carboxyl-terminal amino acids (674-795), which are required for the correct folding of the steroid binding domain, and 3) amino-terminal sequences (550-673), which may be sufficient for steroid binding after the entire steroid binding domain is properly folded. These results establish that the steroid binding domain of glucocorticoid receptors is not independently functional and illustrate the importance of both protein stability and protein folding when constructing mutant proteins.

These results establish that the steroid binding domain of glucocorticoid receptors is not independently functional and illustrate the importance of both protein stability and protein folding when constructing mutant proteins. The presence of separate functional domains in glucocorticoid receptors was first postulated on the basis of protease digestion studies (1Wrange O. Gustafsson J.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 856-865Google Scholar). Chymotrypsin digestion removed about half of the receptor to give a 42-kDa (3.6 nm) fragment that still bound steroid and DNA. Trypsin digestion of receptor-steroid complexes liberated an even smaller, about 30-kDa (1.9 nm) steroid-containing fragment that no longer bound DNA. Further support for this domain structure came after the cloning of glucocorticoid receptors, when it was found that the receptor could be divided up into three functionally active domains: an amino-terminal activation domain, a central DNA binding domain, and a carboxyl-terminal steroid binding domain (2Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Google Scholar, 3Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Google Scholar). An initially surprising feature of all the steroid receptors was that functional activity was retained when the domains of different receptors were interchanged for each other or for the segments of other proteins. Particularly notable examples were the swapping of DNA binding domains of two receptors (4Green S. Chambon P. Nature. 1987; 325: 75-78Google Scholar, 5Umesono K. Evans R.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1139-1146Google Scholar) and the fusing of a steroid binding domain either to different positions of the original receptor or to other proteins (6Picard D. Salser S.J. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 1073-1080Google Scholar, 7Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 899-906Google Scholar). When the steroid binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor was fused to other proteins, not only was steroid binding retained, but also the activity of the rest of the fusion protein was usually controlled by steroid binding (6Picard D. Salser S.J. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 1073-1080Google Scholar, 7Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 899-906Google Scholar, 8Godowski P.J. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5114-5118Google Scholar, 11Hope T.J. Huang X. McDonald D. Parslow T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7787-7791Google Scholar, 12Umek R.M. Friedman A.D.

Thus, in most instances, the various domains of the glucocorticoid receptor appeared to function autonomously. In fact, a separate evolution and function of the specific domains has been proposed (14Yamamoto K.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1985; 19: 209-252Google Scholar, 15Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Google Scholar, 16Amero S.A. Kretsinger R.H. Moncrief N.D. Yamamoto K.R. Pearson W.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 3-7Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with reports that transcription factors generally have a modular structure (17Frankel A.D. Kim P.S. Cell. 1991; 65: 717-719Google Scholar) and that individual protein domains, containing 100-200 amino acids (18Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1994; 370: 111-117Google Scholar), can fold independently of the rest of the protein (19Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3147-3161Google Scholar, 20Peng Z. Kim P.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2136-2141Google Scholar, 21Eyles S.J. Radford S.E. Robinson C.V. Dobson C.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13038-13048Google Scholar). Despite the numerous examples of domain modularity, direct evidence that a given glucocorticoid receptor domain is active in isolation exists only for the DNA binding domain and perhaps the amino-terminal domain. Thus, the fragment corresponding to amino acids 440-525 of the rat receptor, which is only slightly larger than the DNA binding domain (reviewed in Ref. 22Simons Jr., S.S. Vitam. Horm. 1994; 48: 49-130Google Scholar), can bind DNA (23Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Google Scholar, 24Alroy I. Freedman L.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1045-1052Google Scholar). The amino-terminal transactivation domain also possesses transcriptional activity (7Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 899-906Google Scholar, 8Godowski P.J. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1988; 241: 812-816Google Scholar), but this activity could be realized only when the domain is part of some larger DNA-binding protein. Thus, deletion of the amino-terminal domain reduced the trans-activation and synergism of intact glucocorticoid receptors (25Muller M. Baniahmad C. Kaltschmidt C. Renkawitz R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1498-1503Google Scholar), while fusion of the amino-terminal domain to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 caused an increased transcriptional activation, and synergism, from tandem arrangements of a palindromic GAL4 binding sequence (26Baniahmad C. Muller M. Altschmied J. Renkawitz R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 155-165Google Scholar). One example of a biologically relevant activity of the amino-terminal domain in isolation may be squelching (27McEwan I.J. Wright A.P.H. Dahlman-Wright K. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.-A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 399-407Google Scholar). However, the observation that three antibodies to amino-terminal sequences do not inhibit squelching but do prevent transactivation (28McEwan I.J. Almlof T. Wikstrom A.-C. Dahlman-Wright K. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25629-25636Google Scholar) suggest that the two activities involve different processes. To date, there has been no convincing evidence that the isolated steroid binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor retains steroid binding activity. Very poor steroid binding was seen for the “steroid binding domain” either expressed in cell-free translation assays (29Rusconi S. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1309-1315Google Scholar) or overexpressed in Escherichia coli (30Ohara-Nemoto Y. Stromstedt P.-E. Dahlman-Wright K. Nemoto T. Gustafsson J.-A. Carlstedt-Duke J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 37: 481-490Google Scholar). A 16-kDa tryptic fragment of the preformed native receptor, which has been deduced to be amino acids 537-673 of the rat receptor (31Simons Jr., Sistare F.D. Chakraborti P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14493-14497Google Scholar), does display wild type specificity of steroid binding and is not associated with the DNA binding domain in a noncovalent complex (32Chakraborti P.K. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Simons Jr., J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11366-11373Google Scholar). However, these results pose the conundrum of how steroid binding can be retained in a fragment that is smaller than the proposed steroid binding domain, which by itself does not bind steroid. For these reasons, no consensus has emerged as to the precise limits of the steroid binding domain, which has been considered to start anywhere between amino acids 546 and 574 of the rat receptor (22Simons Jr., S.S. Vitam. Horm. 1994; 48: 49-130Google Scholar). We sought in this paper to define the limits of the steroid binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor and to determine whether the steroid binding domain, like the DNA binding domain, can function in isolation. Additionally, we wanted to understand the differences between steroid binding receptor fragments that were prepared by proteolysis from preformed receptors (31Simons Jr., Sistare F.D. Chakraborti P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14493-14497Google Scholar) and those expressed directly from the corresponding mRNA (29Rusconi S. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1309-1315Google Scholar) or cDNA (30Ohara-Nemoto Y. Stromstedt P.-E. Dahlman-Wright K. Nemoto T. Gustafsson J.-A. Carlstedt-Duke J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 37: 481-490Google Scholar). One plausible explanation was that other regions of the receptor are required for correct folding but that, once properly folded, an intact and functional steroid binding core can be isolated. To test this hypothesis, we prepared and examined the activity of several receptor constructs containing portions of the steroid binding domain both in isolation and fused to other proteins. Surprisingly, the steroid binding domain was found not to be functionally independent and to require extra-domain sequences for its activity. Unless otherwise indicated, all operations were performed at 0°C.

A polyclonal antibody (aP1) against the carboxyl-terminal region of the rat glucocorticoid receptor was a gift from Dr. Bernd Groner (Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, Germany). Biotinylated anti-rabbit second antibodies for Western blotting were from Vector Laboratories. TAPS buffer was composed of 25 m TAPS, 1 m EDTA, and 10% glycerol and was adjusted to pH 8.8 or 9.5 at 0°C with sodium hydroxide. Two-fold concentrated SDS sample buffer (2 × SDS) contained 0.6 Tris, pH 8.8, 2% SDS, 0.2 dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, and bromphenol blue. Transfer buffer for Western blotting was made from 25 m Tris, 192 m glycine, 20% methanol in water (pH ∼8.3 at room temperature). Tris-buffered saline (TBS) had 20 m Tris and 0.28 NaCl in water (pH 7.5 at room temperature). All enzymatic manipulations were performed according to manufacturers' recommendations. The constructs were transformed into DH5α competent cells (Life Technologies, Inc.), selected on LB plates containing 50 µg/ml ampicillin (Digene Diagnostics, Inc.) and grown in Superbroth (Quality Biologicals, Inc.). The plasmid DNAs were extracted and purified by the Qiagen Mini or Maxi Kits. pSVL407C was prepared by removing the 407-795 sequence as a BamHI fragment from VARO407-795 (33Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3333-3340Google Scholar) and inserting it into the empty pSVLT vector obtained by BamHI digestion of pSVLT407-556 (34Miesfeld R. Godowski P.J. Maler B.A. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1987; 236: 423-427Google Scholar). The other truncated receptor plasmids (pSVL1-673, pSVLTm537C, and pSVLTm537-673) were made by sequential oligonucleotide-directed point mutagenesis of the original full-length wild type receptor in pSVLGR (35Miesfeld R. Rusconi S. Godowski P.J. Maler B.A. Okret S. Wikstrom A.-C. Gustafsson J.-A. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 389-399Google Scholar) using the Amersham Oligonucleotide Site-directed Mutagenesis System (version 2.1). An SphI-EcoRI fragment, encompassing amino acids 494-768 of the receptor, was subcloned into M13mp18. Single-stranded DNA was isolated and used as template in the mutagenesis reactions. A stop codon in place of Leu-674 was introduced first by changing Val-675 to a BamHI site with the oligonucleotide 5′-GATTGCAGGGATCCTATG-3′ and then altering Leu-674 to a stop codon with 5′-CAAAGATAGCAGGGATCC-3′ (underlined nucleotides indicate changes from wild type sequence). A two-step procedure was also used to create the 537 boundary. Lys-536 was changed to a methionine with the oligonucleotide 5′-GAAAATCCTAACATGACAATAGTTCC-3′, and then an NdeI cloning site was introduced immediately upstream with 5′-GGAAAATCCTCATATGACAATAGTTC-3′. pSVL1-673 was created by ligating a BamHI-SphI fragment (amino acids 1-494) to a SphI-BamHI fragment (amino acids 494-673) into the BamHI-digested pSVL vector. pSVLTm537C and pSVLTm537-673 were constructed by subcloning NdeI-BamHI fragments containing 537C, or 537-673, into a modified pSVL vector (pSVLTm) containing a 64-base pair translational leader sequence from the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (pSVLT) (34Miesfeld R. Godowski P.J. Maler B.A. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1987; 236: 423-427Google Scholar). A NdeI site at the initiator methionine of the thymidine kinase leader sequence was introduced by PCR using the nucleotides 5′-TTTCAGAGGTTATTCAGG-3′ and 5′-GGTACCCATATGCGCTTCTACAAGGC-3′ to give the vector pSVLTm. Fusion protein constructs between β-galactosidase (β-gal) and truncated rat glucocorticoid receptors were made by substituting the appropriate new restriction fragments into pZ540C, which contains amino acids 540-795 of the rat receptor fused in-frame to carboxyl-terminal of β-gal (33Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3333-3340Google Scholar). Specific primers were used to amplify the desired regions of receptor. A SalI recognition site was placed in the 5′ primer, and a stop codon plus a BamHI recognition site was placed in the 3′ primer. pZ540C was digested with either SalI plus XbaI or XbaI plus BamHI. The 5-kb fragment from double digestion with XbaI plus BamHI and the 3-kb fragment from SalI plus XbaI digestion were ligated to the PCR product that had been digested with SalI and BamHI. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The primers used in PCR were as follows. For pZ537C: 5′ primer, 5′-TAGTCGACAAACAATAGTTCCTGCAGC-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-TTGTCATAGGTCTGCTTGAGGAT-3′; for pZ537-673: 5′ primer, 5′-TAGTCGACAAACAATAGTTCCTGCAGC-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-ATGGATCCTATCTTTGTAATTCAGAGG-3′. pGST537C was constructed by modifying the plasmid pdhfr537C, which was digested with EcoRI plus AvaI to generate three fragments (a 4.7-kb vector fragment, a 0.7-kb fragment, and a 0.6-kb fragment containing amino acids 560 to 781 of the receptor). The sequence containing full-length GST plus receptor amino acids 537 to 559 was generated by PCR using a bacterial expression vector for GST537C 2S. Bayly and S. S. Simons, unpublished results. as the template. The PCR primers used were as follows: 5′ primer is 5′-GCCAGAATTCATGTCCCCTATACTAGG-3′; 3′ primer is 5′-CACTGCTGCAATCACTTGAC-3′. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and AvaI and then ligated with the above 4.7- and 0.6-kb fragments to generate pGST537C. The constructs involving a fusion of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and truncated rat glucocorticoid receptors were made by modifying the plasmid pMT2D/G (Israel and Kaufman (45Israel D.I. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4290-4294Google Scholar)). pMT2D/G contains amino acids 494-795 of the rat receptor fused to the carboxyl-terminal of DHFR, at which an SphI site had been generated with adaptors. pMT2D/G affords two fragments with EcoRI digestion. One of the fragments (4.7 kb) was used as the vector for subsequent cloning. The other fragment (1.4 kb) was further digested with SphI to isolate the desired 0.6-kb DHFR sequence. Different lengths of receptor were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from pSVLGR (35Miesfeld R. Rusconi S. Godowski P.J. Maler B.A. Okret S. Wikstrom A.-C. Gustafsson J.-A. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 389-399Google Scholar). 5′ primers for PCR have an SphI recognition site upstream of the receptor cDNA sequence. 3′ Primers contain receptor cDNA followed by a stop codon plus an EcoRI recognition site. After digestion with SphI and EcoRI, the PCR product was ligated to the above 4.7-kb vector and 0.6-kb DHFR-containing fragments. All the constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Primers used in PCR are as follows. For pdhfr537C: 5′ primer (for this and all constructs starting at 537), 5′-GTATAGCATGCACAATAGTTCCTGCAGC-3′; 3′ primer (for this and all constructs ending at 795), 5′-CGGAATTCAACTTTCTTTAAGGCAAC-3′; for pdhfr537-766: 3′ primer, 5′-GCGGAATTCTATTCAATACTCATGGTC-3′; for pdhfr537-710: 3′ primer, 5′-GCGGAATTCTAAGTCATTCGAATCTCA-3′; for pdhfr537-673: 3′ primer, 5′-CGGAATTCTATCTTTGTAATTCAGAGG-3′; for pdhfr547C: 5′ primer, 5′-GCGGAATTCTAGTTCCCTTCCCTTTT-3′; for pdhfr550C: 5′ primer, 5′-GTATAGCATGCTTGGTGTCACTGCTG-3′; for pdhfr552C: 5′ primer, 5′-GTATAGCATGCTCACTGCTGGAGGTG-3′; for pdhfr554C: 5′ primer, 5′-GTATAGCATGCCTGGAGGTGATTGAAC-3′; for pdhfr556C: 5′ primer, 5′-GTATAGCATGCGTGATTGAACCCGA-3′. For pSVLTmdhfr494C, the open reading frame of dhfr-494C fusion protein was amplified from pMT2D/G using the following primers which contain an NdeI site on the 5′ primer (5′-CACTGAGCATATGGTTCGACCATT-3′) and a BamHI site on the 3′ primer (5′-AGCGGATCCATTCAACTTTCTTTAAG-3′). The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI. pSVLTm vector was prepared by digestion of pSVLTm537C with NdeI and BamHI to release the insert GR537C. The pSVLTm vector was then purified and ligated to NdeI and BamHI-digested, above PCR-produced dhfr-494C fusion protein sequence. T3MSTΔ9 contains amino acids 407 to 795 of the rat receptor with deletion of amino acids 690-704 (29Rusconi S. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1309-1315Google Scholar). T3iΔ17 encompasses amino acids 407-795 with deletion of 616-695 (29Rusconi S. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1309-1315Google Scholar). pdhfr537Δ616-695C and pdhfr537Δ690-704C were constructed by exchanging the fragment within two BstBI sites (corresponding to amino acids 487 to 707) in pdhfr537C with the corresponding fragment from T3MSTΔ9 or T3iΔ17, respectively. pSVL1-766 was constructed by inserting the BstBI (at amino acid 707) to XbaI (in the receptor 3′-untranslated region) fragment of pdhfr537-766 into pSVLGR. Monolayer cultures of COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Wild type and truncated receptor expression plasmids (10 µg) were introduced into COS-7 cells (∼6 × 105/100-mm dish) by standard calcium phosphate transfection methods (36Szapary D. Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 941-952Google Scholar). Briefly, after ∼16 h of incubation at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator, the excess calcium phosphate and precipitate were removed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were incubated for another ∼48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and harvested by trypsinization followed by centrifugation and washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The washed cells were stored at 80°C until assayed. The 16-kDa fragment was generated by trypsin digestion (14-26 µg/ml trypsin for 1 h at 0°C) of crude cell receptors, followed by the addition of a 10-fold (w/w) excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor to stop further digestion, as described (31Simons Jr., Sistare F.D. Chakraborti P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14493-14497Google Scholar). COS-7 cell cytosol containing the steroid-free receptors was obtained by the lysis of cells at 80°C and centrifugation at 15,000 × g (37Simons Jr., S.S. Miller P.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6876-6882Google Scholar). [3H]Dex binding assays and competition binding assays all contained added 20 m sodium molybdate (32Chakraborti P.K. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Simons Jr., J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11366-11373Google Scholar). Briefly, 30% cytosol was incubated at 0°C for 2.5 h with 50 n [3H]Dex in the presence or absence of a 500-fold excess of nonradioactive Dex. Dextran-coated charcoal was used to remove the unbound [3H]Dex and, after centrifugation, the supernatant was counted in Hydrofluor. Scatchard analyses were conducted at 0°C for 18 h with various concentrations of [3H]Dex ± 100-fold excess of nonradioactive Dex. Unbound [3H]Dex was removed with dextran-coated charcoal, and the samples were processed as above. Bacterial strains containing the T7 expression vectors encoding receptor sequences 537C and 537-673 were prepared by subcloning NdeI-BamHI fragments encompassing residues 537-673 and 537-795 into NdeI-BamHI-digested pET3a. Single colonies were used to inoculate 4-ml cultures of Luria-Bertani medium with ampicillin and grown with vigorous shaking (300 rpm) at 37°C until visibly turbid (5 h). Receptor protein expression was induced during an additional 2.75 h with 0.1 m isopropyl-1-thio-β—galactopyranoside. Cultures were centrifuged in a Microfuge. The pellets were resuspended in 300 µl of pH 9.5 TAPS buffer and frozen until needed at 80°C. Upon thawing, the cells were treated with 3 volumes of 2 × SDS buffer, vortexed, heated at 100°C for 5 min, and then centrifuged. The supernatant was then analyzed on gels. Samples diluted 1:2 in 2 × SDS buffer were analyzed on constant percentage acrylamide gels (between 8 and 14% with a 1:37.5 ratio of bisacrylamide to acrylamide) run in a water-cooled (15°C) Protean II slab gel apparatus (Bio-Rad) at 35 mA/gel. Gels were fixed, stained, marked at the positions of the molecular weight markers with Ult-Emit, and fluorographed for 1-2 weeks at 80°C as described (38Modarress K.J. Cavanaugh A.H. Chakraborti P.K. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25621-25628Google Scholar). Electrophoretic transfer from SDS-polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose, conducted in a Trans-Blot (Bio-Rad) apparatus (∼15 h at 100 mA, then ∼250 mA for 2 h), followed by incubation with primary and secondary antibodies and staining and visualization by enhanced chemiluminescence, was performed as described (38Modarress K.J. Cavanaugh A.H. Chakraborti P.K. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25621-25628Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding for the intact and truncated receptors of Fig. 1 were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells, which contain very low levels of glucocorticoid receptors (see Fig. 2 below). Cytosolic extracts were then prepared to monitor the presence, and ability to bind steroid, of each receptor construct. The wild type (1-795) and amino-terminal domain truncated (407-795 = 407C) receptors both were stable proteins with very similar steroid binding and Dex-Mes affinity labeling capacity (data not shown). The affinity for dexamethasone (Dex) binding to the 407C receptors was not determined but was expected to be at least that of the smaller 42-kDa chymotryptic fragment of ≈ 413-781 (or −795), which had previously been found to possess 84% of the affinity of the intact receptor (31Simons Jr., Sistare F.D. Chakraborti P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14493-14497Google Scholar). By Western blotting, the expression level of wild type and 407C receptors was similar (Fig. 2). The presence of additional, lower molecular weight bands appears due to alternative translational start sites (35Miesfeld R. Rusconi S. Godowski P.J. Maler B.A. Okret S. Wikstrom A.-C. Gustafsson J.-A. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 389-399Google Scholar, 39Chakraborti P.K. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol.

Aliquots of the COS-7 cell extracts of Fig. 1, along with an aliquot of mock transfected cells and 16-kDa fragment (*) prepared by trypsin digestion of steroid-free receptors from HTC cells, were separated on a 10.8%, or 9% (for 1-673, 1-766, and mock transfection), polyacrylamide gel and Western-blotted with anti-receptor antibody (aP1). The receptors were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence, as described under “Materials and Methods” (location of the receptors is as indicated: wild type, >; 407C, >; 1-766, >; 1-673, →). The positions of the molecular mass markers (phosphorylase b (97,400 Da), bovine serum albumin (66,300 Da), ovalbumin (45,000 Da), carbonic anhydrase (30,600 Da), soybean trypsin inhibitor (21,500 Da), and lactalbumin (14,400 Da)) were marked by Ult-Emit and visualized on film at the same time as chemiluminescence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Neither fragments smaller than 407C, nor larger but containing less of the carboxyl-terminal end of the receptor, displayed significant amounts of steroid binding activity (Fig. 1). Both of the carboxyl truncated receptors 1-766 and 1-673 afforded stable proteins (Fig. 2). The cell-free translated fragment corresponding to 547-795 was reported to bind Dex with 1/350 the affinity of the intact receptor (29Rusconi S. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1309-1315Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, the slightly larger 537-795 (predicted molecular weight = 29,924) and smaller 537-673 (predicted molecular weight = 15,546) fragments gave neither any Dex binding, or Dex-Mes labeling (Fig. 1 and data not shown), nor any detectable receptor protein in transiently transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 2).

Signal sequences have been shown to be functional by fusing them to a nonmitochondrial passenger protein and observing import. In many cases, a signal sequence has been fused to passenger proteins, such as dihydrofolate reductase, and import occurred. There are, though, several unexplained instances in which a signal sequence was attached to a passenger protein and import was not observed. In this study, the N-terminal 23 residues of the matrix enzyme rhodanese could import several passenger proteins but were unable to import the mature form of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (mALDH). However, if these same 23 residues were fused to the middle portion of mALDH, import was recovered, suggesting that the rhodanese signal sequence and N terminus of mALDH were incompatible for import. Circular dichroism data indicated that a peptide corresponding to the region of fusion between rhodanese and mALDH had less structure than corresponding peptides from imported fusion proteins, suggesting that mALDH may alter the helix in the rhodanese signal sequence, thus preventing import.

A431 cells were transfected with the PLNCx plasmid using Lipofectin® (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Positive transfectants were obtained by selection with the neomycin analog geneticin (0.5 mg/ml). The ability of the antisense RNAs to suppress the expression of protein kinases in the transfectant clones was determined by immunoblotting analysis and assay of residual enzyme activity. Cells were harvested and homogenized in 10 m Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 2 m MgCl2, 2 m EDTA containing 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Nuclei were precipitated by low speed centrifugation. Fifty micrograms of post-nuclei fraction protein was subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the separated proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Expression of protein kinase C was probed with antibody against the α-isoform of protein kinase C (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). β-Adrenergic receptor kinase levels were probed with polyclonal antibodies raised against the peptide sequence 389-402 of β-adrenergic receptor kinase-1. Protein kinase A and C activities were assessed by using pre-made assay kits purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The manufacturer's protocol was followed. Protein kinase A activity is defined as the amount of phosphate incorporated into a substrate peptide, Kemptide, in the presence of 10 µ cyclic AMP minus that incorporated in the presence of the protein kinase A inhibitor peptide (1 µ). The specific activity of protein kinase C is the difference between phosphorylation of an acetylated peptide derived from myelin basic protein in the presence of 10 µ phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to that in the presence of 20 µ protein kinase C inhibitory peptide(19-36). The number of β2-adrenergic receptors was determined by radioligand binding to intact cells incubated with 0.5 n [125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) (DuPont NEN, Boston, MA) in the presence or absence of 10 µ propranolol at 23°C for 90 min. The incubation buffer contained 50 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 m MgCl2, and 150 m NaCl. The affinity constants for ICYP and isoproterenol (Sigma) binding were determined using crude membrane fractions incubated with or without 0.1 m GTPγS. The dissociation constant for ICYP was calculated by Scatchard plot analysis with ICYP concentrations ranging from 0 to 1 n. The high (Kh) and low (Kl) affinities for isoproterenol binding to β2AR were determined by isoproterenol (0-1 µ) displacement of ICYP (0.25 n). The Kh values were from a two-site curve fitting (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) to the data obtained in the absence of GTPγS. The Kl values were from a single-site curve fitting to the data obtained in the presence of 100 µ GTPγS. Specific antisense and sense oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized and purified to cell culture grade (Operon Tech., Alameda, CA), as described (2Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Google Scholar). Wild-type A431 cells were treated with 30 µ oligodeoxynucleotides for 2 days prior to the analysis of desensitization. Two days prior to the desensitization analysis, cells were seeded in 96-well plates at the density of 25,000-50,000 cells/well. Cells were washed and challenged with or without 1 µ isoproterenol for 30 min at 37°C. At the end of the first challenge, cells were washed three times, and incubated in Hepes buffer containing Ro-20-1724 (0.1 m, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and adenosine deaminase (0.5 unit/ml) for 5 min prior to (and included in) the second challenge with 1 µ agonist. For resensitization, isoproterenol-treated cells were washed free of agonist and maintained in buffer containing no phosphodiesterase inhibitor for 60 min after the first challenge. Five minutes before the second challenge of the agonist, cells were incubated again in the presence of Ro-20-1724 and adenosine deaminase. The agonist-induced cAMP production within 5 min incubation in the second challenge of agonist was measured. cAMP accumulation was determined as described (19Brown B.L. Albano D.M. Ekins R.P. Sgherzi A.M. Biochem. J. 1971; 121: 561-562Google Scholar). The data are calculated as “% desensitization” in which “100% desensitization” reflects no cAMP accumulation in response to a second challenge with the agonist. “0% desensitization” refers to a cAMP response to a second challenge is equivalent to that obtained in response to the first challenge. Cells were preincubated in the presence or absence of protein kinase C inhibitors, such as bisindolylmaleimide and calphostin C (Calbiochem), or protein phosphatase inhibitors, such as FK506 (Fujisawa USA, Deerfield, IL), cyclosporin A (Signal Transduction, San Diego, CA), fenvalerate (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA), okadaic acid, and calyculin A (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) for 15 min before experiments. Each inhibitor was included throughout the incubation for desensitization and resensitization as described before. Antisense sequences of 29-33 bases in length were engineered into the retroviral expression vector pLNCx (20Watkins D.C. Johnson G.L. Malbon C.C. Science. 1992; 258: 1373-1375Google Scholar) targeting protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and β-adrenergic receptor kinase, and used to stably transfect A431 cells. After transfection, neomycin-resistant clones were selected and tested for expression of kinase by immunoblotting (Fig. 1) and by measurement of enzyme activity (not shown). As shown by immunoblotting, the expression of β-adrenergic receptor kinase (Fig. 1A, molecular mass ∼ 79 kDa) and protein kinase C (Fig. 1B, molecular mass ∼ 80 kDa) was suppressed effectively in the clones stably expressing the RNA antisense to each. Assay of total protein kinase C activity agreed well with the immunoblotting, displaying >80% reduction. The expression of PKCα and PKCγ was suppressed by the antisense, whereas PKCβ and PKCϵ isoforms were not detected (not shown). As previously reported (21Pippig S. Andexinger S. Daniel K. Puzicha M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3201-3208Google Scholar), the assay for β-adrenergic receptor kinase activity was of insufficient sensitivity to accurately detect endogenous β-adrenergic receptor kinase levels in the extracts of wild-type cells. Likewise, immunoblotting of protein kinase A in wild-type cells was not sensitive enough to detect endogenous levels of the enzyme in whole cell extracts. Total protein kinase A activity, however, was directly assayed and found to be reduced 70-85% in clones at early passages. The initial observations of unique roles of protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and β-adrenergic receptor kinase in agonist-induced desensitization were obtained using treatment with oligodeoxynucleotides antisense and sense to mRNA of each kinase (2Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Google Scholar). Creating stably transfected clones expressing RNA antisense to each protein kinase permitted studies precluded by the small-scale required for oligodeoxynucleotide-induced suppression. Stable transfectants expressing RNA antisense to protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and β-adrenergic receptor kinase were analyzed for agonist-induced desensitization and the results were compared to those obtained by oligodeoxynucleotide-induced suppression (Fig. 2). The data demonstrate a sharp reduction in agonist-induced desensitization in the A431 clones deficient in either protein kinase A or β-adrenergic receptor kinase. In the protein kinase C-deficient clones, in contrast, agonist-induced desensitization was markedly potentiated. Stable transfection with the empty expression vector itself has no effect. The extent of isoproterenol-induced desensitization was nearly doubled in cells made deficient in protein kinase C. Both wild-type and empty vector transfected cells reached the maximal desensitization (∼30% reduction in Vmax) at 10 min following challenge with the agonist. The extent of desensitization plateaued from 10 to 40 min. In contrast, protein kinase C-deficient cells displayed a progressive increase in desensitization (30-50%) from 10 to 40 min following the challenge (not shown). These data agreed well with those obtained with oligodeoxynucleotide-treated cells. The unexpected potentiation of desensitization by protein kinase C-deficiency (2Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Google Scholar) was confirmed by these studies. The availability of stable transfectants lacking protein kinase C permitted further analysis of the role of this kinase in desensitization. The protein kinase C-deficiency provoked a small, but not significant, reduction in the level of β2AR expression (Table I). A similar reduction was observed with cells transfected with empty vector alone (not shown). The dissociation constant, Kd, for radiolabeled ICYP was unaffected and the distribution of receptors in the high- and low-affinity forms were equivalent in wild-type and protein kinase C-deficient cells. The binding constants for the high- and low-affinity sites also were not altered in the protein kinase C-deficient clones. Basal level of cAMP accumulation in protein kinase C-deficient cells was equivalent to that in wild-type cells, whereas the maximal accumulation of cAMP in response to 1 µ isoproterenol in protein kinase C-deficient cells was slightly, but not significantly, reduced (Table II). The EC50 values of isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation were 2.5 and 5.9 n for wild-type and protein kinase C-deficient cells, respectively.TABLE I.β2-Adrenergic receptor numbers and binding properties in wild-type and protein kinase C-deficient A431 cellsclonesBinding propertiesICYPIsoproterenolβ2AR/cellKd (p)Kh (n)Kl (µ)WT73,000 ± 4000146 ± 244.9 (24%)0.64 (76%)PKC-deficient56,000 ± 9000aStatistically, not different from WT (p < 0.05).164 ± 34aStatistically, not different from WT (p < 0.05).7.9 (21%)aStatistically, not different from WT (p < 0.05).0.82 (79%)aStatistically, not different from WT (p < 0.05).a Statistically, not different from WT (p < 0.05).

Open table in a new tab The data from the stimulatory responses provided no clue as to the basis for potentiation of desensitization by protein kinase C-deficiency. The ability of the cells to recover from agonist-induced desensitization was explored next. Cells were stimulated with 1 µ isoproterenol for 30 min, then washed free of agonist and examined for the ability to re-establish agonist-stimulated cAMP accumulation (Fig. 3). For clones stably transfected with empty vector, washout of agonist promoted a gradual loss of the desensitization, i.e. resensitization. The t1/2 for resensitization in the control clones was ∼25 min. Within 50 min of washout of agonist, resensitization was completed in these clones. The protein kinase C-deficient cells, in sharp contrast, displayed a rather static level of desensitization. Desensitization persisted for more than 60 min following the washout of the agonist in the protein kinase C-deficient cells. A second approach, treating cells with inhibitors of protein kinase C was explored. Wild-type cells treated with either bisindolylmaleimide (0.3 µ) (22Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamed L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-17781Google Scholar) or calphostin C (0.3 µ) (23Burns R.F. Miller F.D. Merriman R.L. Howbert J.J. Heath W.F. Kobayashi E. Takahashi I. Tamaoki T. Nakano H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 288-293Google Scholar) displayed a blunted resensitization, retaining ∼70% of agonist-induced desensitization at 60 min following washout of the agonist (not shown). Taken together, the data from the loss-of-function mutant clones and from wild-type clones treated with either inhibitor of protein kinase C provide an explanation for the potentiation of desensitization observed in the protein kinase C-deficient cells, i.e. protein kinase C activity is critical to the recovery phase of agonist-induced desensitization. The loss of receptor resensitization in protein kinase C-deficient cells and the central role of protein phosphorylation in agonist-induced desensitization prompted consideration of protein phosphatases. A series of well characterized protein phosphatase inhibitors were screened for effects on resensitization of β2AR, following a 30-min agonist-induced desensitization (Table III). Inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 and 2A by okadaic acid (100 n) and calyculin A (10 n) failed to alter significantly receptor resensitization, when measured at 60 min following agonist washout. In the presence of okadaic acid, the desensitized receptor activity was completely recovered within 60 min. Although calyculin A at 10 n has been reported to block substantially receptor dephosphorylation (24Pippig S. Andexinger S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676Google Scholar), it did not affect resensitization in our experiments (data not shown). A minimal, residual degree of desensitization was detected in cells treated with 100 n calyculin A at 60 min after resensitization. Cells did not tolerate higher concentrations of either okadaic acid or calyculin A, precluding analysis of resensitization at higher concentrations of either inhibitor (not shown). Treating cells with the protein phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate (100 µ), also failed to alter the resensitization. Noticeably, neither okadaic acid nor calyculin A enhanced desensitization, measured at 5 min post the first challenge of agonist.TABLE IIIEffect of protein phosphatase inhibitors on receptor resensitizationDrugsConcentrationsDesensitization (%)5-min post-challenge60-min post-challengeNone27.0 ± 3.00.9 ± 4.6Okadaic acid100 n31.4 ± 4.26.3 ± 0.1Calyculin A100 n30.3 ± 8.313.3 ± 3.0Vanadate100 µ33.7 ± 1.52.5 ± 8.4FK506100 ng/ml74.8 ± 1.840.4 ± 2.1 Open table in a new tab Most striking were the effects obtained with the inhibitor of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase (protein phosphatase 2B), FK506. FK506 associates with immunophilin FKBP12 and specifically inhibits protein phosphatase 2B activity (25Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman I. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Google Scholar, 26O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neil E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Google Scholar). Treatment with FK506 potentiated agonist-induced desensitization by more than 2-fold (27 versus 75% desensitization) measured at 5 min postwashout. FK506-treated cells displayed a persistent desensitization at 60 min postchallenge of agonist, much like deficiency in protein kinase C (Fig. 3). Cells treated with inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2B, either cyclosporin A (100 ng/ml) or fenvalerate (10 n) (25Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman I. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Google Scholar, 27Enan E. Matsumura F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1777-1784Google Scholar), also displayed blunted resensitization (not shown). Protein phosphatase 2B expression was readily detected in these cells via immunoblotting (not shown). The effects of FK506 treatment on resensitization were dose-dependent (Table IV). Since FK506 and protein kinase C deficiency both suppressed the ability of the cells to recover from agonist-induced desensitization, it was of interest to explore whether their effects were additive. Although both FK506 and protein kinase C-deficiency abolished recovery of cells from agonist-induced desensitization, the effects of the two, in combination, were not additive. Treatment of protein kinase C-deficient cells with FK506 did not suppress resensitization further than protein kinase C-deficiency alone. As expected, treatment of protein kinase C-deficient cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate failed to change either the extent of desensitization or resensitization (not shown).TABLE IVEffect of FK506 on receptor resensitizationClonesFK506Desensitization (%) (60-min post-challenge)ng/mlWild-type08.9 ± 5.01020.2 ± 7.810040.4 ± 2.1PKC-deficient033.0 ± 2.210035.0 ± 6.0 Open table in a new tab The attenuation that accompanies chronic stimulation is a fundamental feature of cell signaling. For GPLR, agonist-induced desensitization (1Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Google Scholar) and down-regulation (28Hadcock J.R. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5021-5025Google Scholar) are nearly universally observed. Protein phosphorylation is central to agonist-induced desensitization, with roles implicated for several protein kinases including protein kinase A (7Hausdorff W.P. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Irons G.P.

Ruoho A.E. Johson G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4316-4320Google Scholar), and G-protein-linked receptor kinases (31Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 409-412Google Scholar). In our earlier studies of protein kinases and agonist-induced desensitization, we created loss-of-function mutants by treating cells with oligodeoxynucleotides antisense to specific kinases (2Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Google Scholar). Elimination of protein kinase A and β-adrenergic receptor kinase resulted in a profound loss of attenuation in response to β-adrenergic stimulation of cAMP accumulation in a variety of cell types. Loss of protein kinase C, in contrast, potentiated rather than blunted agonist-induced desensitization. In the current work, use of stably transfected clones permitted further analysis of the effects of protein kinase C-deficiency on desensitization. The hypothesis that protein kinase C acts to suppress desensitization and/or enhance resensitization was tested in loss-of-function mutants, deficient in protein kinase C. Elimination of protein kinase C potentiated desensitization, but was shown not to influence the onset of the process, prompting analysis of the resensitization process. Protein kinase C-deficiency was found not only to influence the recovery of cells from agonist-induced desensitization, but also to block the recovery phase entirely. Loss-of-function mutant cells failed to recover from desensitization for more than an hour following agonist washout. Empty vector transfected cells displayed a recovery process with a t1/2∼25 min. This critical observation was confirmed using an independent approach, treatment of wild-type cells with either bisindolylmaleimide or calphostin C, inhibitors of protein kinase C. The central role of protein phosphorylation in agonist-induced desensitization for GPLR prompted an analysis of protein phosphatase activity in the recovery phase. The role and character of phosphatases in the resensitization process were established using well known phosphatase inhibitors, specific for protein phosphatase 1, protein phosphatase 2A, protein phosphatase 2B, and protein phosphotyrosine phosphatase activities. Although protein phosphatase 2A has been shown to dephosphorylate β-adrenergic receptor kinase-phosphorylated GPLR in the reconstituted system (32Pitcher J.A. Payne E.S. Csortos C. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8343-8347Google Scholar), neither okadaic acid nor calyculin A, inhibitors of protein phosphatase 2A altered significantly the recovery of agonist-induced desensitization. These observations indicate no major role of protein phosphatase 2A in resensitization in these cells, and further suggest that the reversal of β-adrenergic receptor kinase-mediated phosphorylation is not essential for the recovery of receptor activity. Likewise, the inability of vanadate ions to alter agonist-induced desensitization argues against a role of protein phosphotyrosine phosphatase in resensitization of GPLR. Although shown recently to be substrates for tyrosine kinases both in vivo (3Karoor V. Baltensperger K. Paul H. Czech M.P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25305-25308Google Scholar) and in vitro (4Baltensperger K. Karoor V. Paul H. Czech M.P. Ruoho A. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14939-14946Google Scholar), β2AR are cross-regulated by hormones like insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I, whereas activation of tyrosine kinases is not known to occur in homologous desensitization. In association with immunophilin FKBP12, FK506 is known to inhibit protein phosphatase 2B activity (25Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman I. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Google Scholar, 26O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neil E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Google Scholar). Treating cells with FK506 potentiated agonist-induced desensitization of β2AR-mediated cAMP accumulation and attenuated sharply the recovery from desensitization that typically follows washout of the agonist. These effects were dose-dependent and suggest a central role of protein phosphatase 2B in the recovery phase from agonist-induced desensitization of GPLRs. The action of FK506 observed in wild-type cells was absent in the protein kinase C-deficient mutants. Taken together these data provide a compelling case for a central role of protein phosphatase 2B in protein kinase C-dependent recovery of cells from agonist-induced desensitization (Fig. 4). In view of the data obtained in the loss-of-function mutant clones lacking protein kinase C, activation of protein kinase C with phorbol esters might be expected to reduce desensitization overall, by accelerating the recovery phase. In the loss-of-function mutants treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate had no effect, as expected. Paradoxically, treating wild-type cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate enhanced desensitization (not shown). The basis for this effect was revealed recently in studies reported by Chuang et al. (33Chuang T.T. LeVine III, H. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18660-18665Google Scholar) demonstrating that protein kinase C potentiates the activity of β-adrenergic receptor kinase (Fig. 4). Thus, protein kinase C appears to play a pivotal role in regulating GPLR desensitization. In the forward direction, activation of protein kinase C leads to increased β-adrenergic receptor kinase activity promoting greater desensitization. In the reverse direction, protein kinase C is obligate and central to the recovery from desensitization. The action of protein kinase C on the recovery phase appears to require protein phosphatase 2B. As determined through metabolic labeling of the cells with 32P, protein phosphatase 2B was phosphorylated in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment of the cells (not shown). This novel role for protein kinase C highlights a new dimension in our understanding of cross-talk between GPLR-mediated responses. In view of the ability of catecholamines to activate both α-adrenergic receptors (linked to phospholipase C and protein kinase C activation) and β-adrenergic (linked to adenylylcyclase activation) receptors co-expressed in many cells, such cross-talk would seem integral in cell signaling.

https://openalex.org/W1970533648,"EmrE is a small, 12-kDa, highly polyspecific antiporter, which exchanges hydrogen ions with aromatic cations such as methyl viologen. EmrE-mediated transport is inhibited by the sulfhydryl-reactive reagent 4-(chloromercuri)benzoic acid (PCMB) but not by a variety of other sulfhydryl reagents. This differential effect is due to the fact that the organic mercurial is a substrate of the transporter and can reach domains otherwise inaccessible to the different reagents. To find out which of the three cysteine residues in EmrE is reacting with PCMB, each was replaced with serine and it was shown that none of them is essential for transport activity. A protein completely devoid of Cys residues (CL) is also capable of substrate accumulation albeit at a slower rate. Mutated proteins in which only one of the native cysteines was left whereas the other changed to serine were also constructed. The use of these proteins demonstrated that two of the three Cys in EmrE, Cys-41 and Cys-95, but not Cys-39, react with PCMB. A related mercurial, 4-(chloromercuri)benzenesulfonic acid (PCMBS), is only a very poor inhibitor, probably because of the negative charge it bears. PCMBS reacts with EmrE in an asymmetric and unique way. It reacts with the mutant bearing a single Cys residue in position 95 (CL-C95) only when the reagent is present in the outside face of the membrane and with the mutant CL-C41 only when allowed to permeate to the cell interior; as expected, it does not react with the mutant protein bearing a single Cys at position 39 (CL-C39). It is concluded that PCMB permeates through the substrate pathway of EmrE and covalently reacts with the two exposed residues, Cys-95 and Cys-41, but not with Cys-39, located on the opposite face of the helix relative to residue 41. In addition, because of the asymmetric reactivity to PCMBS, an inhibitor that does not permeate through the protein, it is concluded that Cys-41 is closer to the cytoplasmic face than Cys-95. The results demonstrate the existence of a domain accessible only to substrates and provide a unique tool for studying the substrate permeation pathway of an ion-coupled transporter.

Resistance to a wide range of cytotoxic compounds is a common phenomenon observed in many organisms throughout the evolutionary scale and probably developed in order to cope with the variety of toxic compounds that are part of the natural environment in which living cells dwell (see for example Refs. 1Neu H.C.

One of the survival strategies that evolved is removal of toxic substances by transport. Multidrug transporters are the proteins usually responsible for performing this task and have been found in many organisms, from bacteria to man (4Nikaido H. Science. 1994; 264: 382-388Google Scholar, 5Griffith J. Baker M. Rouch D. Page M. Skurray R. Paulsen I. Chater K. Baldwin S. Henderson P. Curr. Opin.

They actively remove a wide variety of substrates in an energy-dependent process and thereby decrease the concentration of the offending compounds near their target. A great diversity of multidrug transporters are known to us today, and we can group them in several different families based on structure similarities. A unique family (Smr or MiniTEXANs) is represented by very small proteins, about 100 amino acids long, which render bacteria resistant to a variety of toxic cations (10Grinius L. Dreguniene G.

Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1167-1175Google Scholar). Two MiniTEXANs, Smr (12Grinius L.L. Goldberg E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29998-30004Google Scholar, 13Paulsen I. Brown M. Dunstan S. Skurray R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2827-2833Google Scholar) and EmrE (14Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Google Scholar), have been characterized, purified and reconstituted in a functional form. Both proteins catalyze H+/cation antiport in proteoliposomes reconstituted with purified transporter and behave as multidrug transporters capable of recognizing a wide range of substrates and inhibitors. In addition, EmrE has been shown to display unique properties of solubility in organic solvents such as a mixture of chloroform and methanol (14Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Google Scholar). After solubilization in the above solvent, the protein retains its ability to transport as judged from the fact that it can be reconstituted in a functional form. Using transmission FTIR (Fourier transform infrared) and oriented ATR-FTIR (attenuated total reflection FTIR) spectra, the protein was found to be a four-membered transmembrane antiparallel helical bundle. The helices in EmrE are oriented perpendicular to the lipid bilayer with a tilt angle of 27° with respect to the bilayer normal (15Arkin I. Russ W. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7233-7238Google Scholar). An elegant and systematic approach to the identification of residues lining an ion channel has been applied to the acetylcholine and γ-aminobutyric acid receptors and to the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (16Akabas M. Kaufmann C. Archdeacon P. Karlin A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 919-927Google Scholar, 17Akabas M. Kaufmann C. Cook T.A. Archdeacon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14865-14868Google Scholar, 18Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21505-21508Google Scholar). Each residue in putative transmembrane spanning segments is mutagenized to cysteine and the accessibility of the new cysteine to small, charged, water-soluble, sulfhydryl-specific reagents is tested. The polar reagents react only with sulfhydryls at the water accessible surface of the protein, i.e. those exposed in the channel lumen. The covalent attachment of any of these groups to a cysteine in the channel is assumed to alter the channel function. This approach, called the substituted-cysteine accessibility method, allows, therefore, identification of residues in the permeation pathway. In a variation of this method, Ag+, a sulfhydryl-reactive substrate of a K+ channel was used to study the channel exposed residues (19Lü Q. Miller C. Science. 1995; 268: 304-307Google Scholar) and selected cysteine point mutations in residues located at or near the aqueous pore were found to confer mercurial sensitivity to a mercurial-insensitive water channel (20Shi L.B. Verkmen A.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 538-544Google Scholar). In general, however, the method is limited to those proteins in which the substrate pathway is hydrophilic and accessible to molecules other than the substrate. In ion-coupled transporters, on the other hand, at least part of the permeability pathway must be reachable only by substrates or inhibitors. Yan and Maloney have probed a bacterial membrane antiporter that exchanges glucose 6-phosphate and inorganic phosphate with 4-(chloromercuri)benzenesulfonic acid (PCMBS), 1The abbreviations used are: PCMBS4-(chloromercuri)benzenesulfonic acidIAAiodoacetic acidMTSEAmethanethiosulfonate ethylammoniumNEMN-ethylmaleimidePCMB4-(chloromercuri)benzoic acidTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. a hydrophilic and impermeant sulfhydryl-reactive agent presumably resembling the substrate in volume and charge (21Yan R.T. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Google Scholar, 22Yan R.T. Maloney P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 37-44Google Scholar). They showed that transmembrane-spanning segment 7 is an α-helix whose central portion is accessible to PCMBS. 4-(chloromercuri)benzenesulfonic acid iodoacetic acid methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium N-ethylmaleimide 4-(chloromercuri)benzoic acid N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. In this report we show that the three native cysteine residues in EmrE (Fig. 1) are inaccessible to either small hydrophilic reagents, such as the negatively charged iodoacetic acid (IAA) and the positively charged methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium (MTSEA), or to hydrophobic ones such as N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). However, a sulfhydryl-reactive substrate such as PCMB inactivates transport of the wild type protein because it is a substrate of the transporter and can reach domains otherwise inaccessible to the other reagents. Each of the cysteine residues in EmrE was replaced with serine, and it was shown that none of them is essential for transport activity. A protein completely devoid of Cys residues is also capable of substrate accumulation, albeit at a slower rate, and it was used to generate mutants with a single Cys residue at each of the Cys positions in the wild type protein. Using these mutant proteins it was found that two of the three Cys in EmrE, Cys-41 and Cys-95, but not Cys-39, react with PCMB. PCMBS, which is a very weak inhibitor because of the negative charge it bears, reacts with EmrE in an asymmetric and unique way; it reacts with Cys-95 from the outside face of the membrane and Cys-41 from the inside. Escherichia coli JM109 (23Yanish-Perron C. Viera J. Messing J. Gene (Amst). 1985; 33: 103-199Google Scholar) and plasmid pKK56 (14Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Google Scholar) are used throughout this work. In plasmid pKK56, EmrE is cloned into EcoRI and HindIII sites of pKK223-3 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Mutants were obtained by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis using the overlap extension procedure described by Ho et al. (24Ho S.F. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst). 1989; 77: 51-59Google Scholar). For each mutation a set of two overlapping oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutation were constructed. The outside primers were those used for the wild type EmrE (14Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Google Scholar). Mutagenic oligonucleotides were prepared incorporating a unique restriction site to facilitate mutant identification, and in several cases this required an additional conservative mutation that did not affect EmrE expression. Mutated DNA was identified by the acquisition of the new restriction site and sequenced to ensure that no other mutations occurred during the amplification process (Sequenase version 2.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The primer 5′-GGTACGATCATTTCTTATTGTGC with a unique Sau3AI site and a conservative change in Thr-36 and Ile-37 was used to obtain the C39S variant when using wild type DNA as template or CL-C41 when using C95S as DNA template; 5′-GGTACAATTATTTGTTATAGCGCATCATTCTGG with a unique CfoI site yielded C41S when using wild type DNA as template or CL-C39 when using C95S as template; 5′-GCATGATGTTGATTAGCGCCGG with a unique CfoI site gave C95S when using wild type DNA as template; 5′-GGTACAATTATTTCTTATAGCGCATCATTCTGG with a unique CfoI site was used to give CL, when using C95S as DNA template and CL-C95 when using wild type as DNA template. For testing resistance to toxic compounds, cells were grown at 37°C in LB-Amp medium with different concentrations of the compound and A600 nm was checked. E. coli JM109 transformed with the appropriate plasmid was grown in minimal medium A with 0.5% glycerol and thiamine and ampicillin as above. When the culture reached an A600 = 0.9, isopropyl β—thiogalactoside was added to 0.5 m; 2 h later, the cells were chilled on ice and harvested by centrifugation. Membranes were prepared by disrupting the cells using a French pressure procedure (25Rosen B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 328-336Google Scholar), except that the buffer used was 10 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 250 m sucrose, 150 m choline chloride, 0.5 m dithiothreitol, 2.5 m MgSO4, and 15 µg/ml DNase I. After ultracentrifugation membranes were resuspended at 10 mg of protein/ml, frozen in liquid air, and stored at −70°C. EmrE was extracted essentially as described (14Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Google Scholar) from 2.5 ml of membranes (10 mg of protein/ml) with 37 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:1), incubated 20 min on ice. For phase separation, 7.5 ml of H2O were added and the suspension was centrifuged. The upper phase was removed, and the lower phase with the enriched protein was stored at −70°C. For analysis in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a sample was dried, resuspended in sample buffer, and analyzed in 16% gels as described (26Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar). For reconstitution, 4-9 µg of extracted protein was mixed with 18 µl of E. coli phospholipids (50 mg/ml), 750 µl of chloroform:methanol (1:1) and 180 µl chloroform:methanol (1:2). The suspension was dried with argon and resuspended in a solution (60 µl) containing 0.18 NH4Cl, 0.015 Tris-HCl, pH 6.9. The suspension was kept at −70°C. Before the assay, the proteoliposome suspension was thawed and sonicated in a bath-type sonicator for a few seconds until clear. Transport of [14C]methyl viologen into proteoliposomes was assayed by dilution of 3 µl of the ammonium chloride containing proteoliposomes into 200 µl of an ammonium-free medium containing 35 µ [14C]methyl viologen (90 nCi), 140 m KCl, 10 m Tricine, and 5 m MgCl2 (pH 8.5). At given times, the reaction was stopped by dilution with 2 ml of the same ice-cold solution, filtering through Schleicher & Schüll filters (0.2 µm) and washing with an additional 2-ml solution. The radioactivity on the filters was estimated by liquid scintillation. In each experiment the values obtained in a control reaction with 5 µ nigericin were subtracted from all experimental points. This background was between 5 and 10% of the experimental values. Proteoliposomes of wild type EmrE and the various mutants (75-300 ng of protein/µl of liposome) reconstituted in ammonium chloride medium were preincubated for the indicated times at 22°C with different concentrations of sulfhydryl reagents and diluted 60-fold into the ammonium-free medium containing [14C]methyl viologen as described above. Protein determination was done in dry samples according to Peterson (27Peterson G. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Google Scholar). Phospholipids were prepared from E. coli as described (28Viitanen P. Newman M.J. Foster L. Wilson T.H. Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 429-452Google Scholar). To test the role of Cys residues in EmrE-mediated transport, we mutagenized each of the three cysteines in EmrE and tested the effect of a variety of sulfhydryl reagents. After treatment of proteoliposomes reconstituted with highly enriched EmrE with the various reagents, transport of [14C]methyl viologen was assayed by dilution of ammonium chloride-loaded proteoliposomes into an ammonium-free medium. Under these conditions a pH gradient was generated, acid inside, which was utilized by EmrE to accumulate [14C]methyl viologen against its concentration gradient in a process that involves the exchange of one or more H+ with the substrate (14Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig. 2A describe an experiment in which proteoliposomes were incubated with various concentrations of selected reagents: IAA and MTSEA, two small hydrophilic, highly reactive compounds, bearing negative and positive charge, respectively (Fig. 2B); incubation with concentrations as high as 3 m for the above reagents had no effect on the initial rate of ΔpH-driven [14C]methyl viologen accumulation. The hydrophobic neutral NEM had also no effect on transport up to a concentration of 12 m (only part of the concentration range of NEM is shown in Fig. 2A). On the other hand, a relatively more bulky compound, PCMB, inhibited transport in a concentration-dependent way; pretreatment with about 1 m PCMB results in a 50% decrease in the initial rate and practically full inhibition is detected above 1.5 m. This compound is also relatively hydrophobic but it bears a positive charge (−Hg+) in proximity to the aromatic benzene ring (Fig. 2B). In position para to the Hg, a weak carboxyl moiety is usually ionized at neutral pH. The more hydrophilic analogue, PCMBS, bears a sulfonate residue instead of the carboxyl at PCMB (Fig. 2B) and is, therefore, permanently charged; PCMBS inhibits the EmrE-mediated transport with slightly higher potency: 50% inhibition at 0.5 m, full-inhibition above 1.5 m (Fig. 2A). The PCMB-inhibited protein is completely inactive, as judged not only from its inability to drive ΔpH-dependent uptake. It cannot catalyze downhill efflux of [14C]methyl viologen from preloaded liposomes or exchange of the intraliposomal substrate with an excess of unlabeled substrate (data not shown). The inhibition by both reagents is fully reversible after a 10-min incubation with 5 m dithiothreitol, as expected from the type of reaction of these two mercurials with Cys residues (data not shown). Since the reactivity of the other sulfhydryl reagents is certainly not lower than that of PCMB and PCMBS, we tested whether it is possible that they react but do not inhibit activity. To test this assumption the proteoliposomes were exposed to the various compounds prior to PCMB treatment to test for “protection” of the inhibition site. The results of such an experiment, in which wild type and several single cysteine mutant proteins (see below for details) were exposed to the reagents, are summarized in Table I. The results suggest that none of the reagents, except for the mercurials, react with any of the sensitive Cys: pretreatment of the proteoliposomes with 3 m of either IAA, MTSEA, or NEM have no effect by itself on the activity, as shown above and also do not prevent the inhibition by PCMB.TABLE I.Pretreatment with other sulfhydryl reagents does not prevent inhibition by PCMB or PCMBSPretreatment conditionsMercurial[14C]Methyl viologen uptakeWild typeCL-C41CL-C95pmolNo additionNone540 (100)360 (100)420 (100)3 m IAANone545 (101)380 (105)415 (98)3 m MTSEANone535 (99)380 (105)420 (100)3 m NEMNone510 (94)400 (110)420 (100)1.5 m PCMBNone80 (15Arkin I.

Open table in a new tab To identify the residue(s) that are the site of action of PCMB and PCMBS and to test for their possible role in the transport reaction, each of the three Cys in EmrE: Cys-39, Cys-41, and Cys-95, was replaced with Ser and also a strain in which all three of them were replaced (CL) 2The mutants are named as follows: single amino acid replacements are named with the letter of the original amino acid, then its position in the protein and the letter of the new amino acid. The protein in which all the cysteines were replaced is CL. Proteins with single Cys residues are named CL, followed by the position of the single Cys residue. was obtained. The results in Fig. 3 summarize the phenotype of cells bearing the various mutants: E. coli cells, otherwise sensitive to the toxic effects of ethidium bromide (400 µg/ml; Fig. 3A), methyl viologen (0.4 m; Fig. 3B), and acriflavine (50 µg/ml; Fig. 3C), become resistant to the above compounds when transformed with a multicopy plasmid carrying wild type emrE. Essentially the same phenotype is observed when the cells are transformed with plasmids coding for mutants C39S, C41S, C95S, or for CL, a completely Cys-less protein (Fig. 3). Control cells, mock-transformed with vector only, are sensitive to all the above compounds, while growing normally in the presence of ampicillin (Fig. 3D). We conclude that none of the Cys residues is essential for conferring multiple drug resistance and also EmrE without any Cys (CL) is functional according to this criterion. To test the level of expression and to quantitate the level of activity of each mutant protein, they were extracted with chloroform:methanol and visualized with Coomassie Blue after separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The levels of expression of the various proteins do not differ significantly from the expression of wild type EmrE (data not shown). To test the ability of each mutant to catalyze ΔpH-driven [14C]methyl viologen accumulation, the proteins were reconstituted into proteoliposomes and transport was measured. The results of such an experiment are shown in Fig. 4. Each of the mutants in which single cysteines were replaced with serine is capable of active accumulation of [14C]methyl viologen. While the wild type protein accumulates about 2100 pmol/min/µg of protein and C41S shows essentially the same rate, C95S accumulates at about 51% (1050 pmol/min/µg of protein) of the above rate and C39S at 32% of the activity (650 pmol/min/µg of protein). In all the single replacements, the steady state levels of accumulation are comparable. The Cys-less protein, in which the three Cys residues were replaced with Ser, displays the lowest activity: only 7-30% of the wild type. The CL protein is particularly poor in its ability to catalyze transport, and a rather high variability in the activity of the CL protein was observed from batch to batch of proteoliposomes. These findings suggest some fluctuation in the stability of this mutant and/or in its ability to reconstitute. Once in proteoliposomes, however, the activity of the CL protein is stable and reproducible. An important conclusion from these findings is that none of the Cys residues in EmrE is essential for transport. Even though the rates of uptake are significantly modified by the replacements all of them are active and catalyze ΔpH-dependent accumulation of [14C]methyl viologen. Each of the single Cys replacements was sensitive to the inhibitory effects of both mercurials: PCMB and PCMBS (Fig. 5, A and B). The PCMB concentration required to inhibit the rate of transport catalyzed by the wild type protein by 50% (about 1 m) was very similar to the amount required to inhibit the C95S and C41S mutants. C39S was consistently somewhat more sensitive (0.4 m IC50). As expected, the CL protein was much less sensitive, but a small and reproducible inhibition was observed which reached a maximum of about 30%, when the concentration of PCMB during the pretreatment was 4.5 m. PCMBS inhibits 50% of the activity of wild type EmrE, C39S, and C95S in the range of 0.3-0.6 m. However, while it fully inhibited the wild type protein at higher concentrations, it consistently and reproducibly inhibited only 65-70% of the activity of the two mutants. The C41S protein was inhibited only by about 30%. The CL protein was practically unaffected up to 3 m PCMBS. Since in each of the mutant proteins generated above there are still two other Cys residues, to assess which one is the target of action of PCMB, CL proteins with single Cys at their native positions were engineered: CLC39, CLC41, and CLC95. The three above mutants were tested for activity and for their sensitivity to PCMB and PCMBS (Fig. 5, C and D). Each of the single Cys proteins display activities somewhat higher than that shown by the CL protein yet lower than the wild type (see Fig. 4); the range of activities obtained in five different proteoliposome preparations were (in nmol/mg/7 min): 620-800 for CL-C41, 800-1000 for CL-C39, and 720-1000 for CL-C95. The sensitivity to PCMB and PCMBS was tested as described for the other proteoliposome preparations, after exposure to the indicated concentrations and dilution (60-fold) into the assay buffer. CLC41 and CLC95, but not CLC39, are sensitive to the effect of PCMB: the concentration required to inhibit CLC95 is slightly higher (IC50 = 1.5 m) than that required to inhibit CLC41 (IC50 = 0.5 m). In both cases, about 80% inhibition is detected at 4.5 m reagent. CLC39, on the other hand, is only slightly inhibited (about 25%), and this is about the same degree of inhibition observed in CL-EmrE. The general pattern of sensitivity of the various proteins to PCMBS is similar to that described above for PCMB. However, full inhibition is not seen for any of the mutants; it inhibits only 40-50% the CLC95 protein and 60-70% the CL-C41 mutant. Similar to CL-EmrE, the activity of CL-C39 is not influenced at all by PCMBS up to 3 m in the treatment medium. From the above studies with the mutants bearing single Cys, we conclude that while residues 41 and 95 are fully exposed to PCMB, they are only partially accessible to PCMBS. Residue 39 is inaccessible to both mercurials. None of the single Cys is exposed to any of the other sulfhydryl reagents tested, since their activity is not influenced by pretreatment with any of them and the reaction with the mercurials is not prevented (Table I). The partial accessibility to PCMBS in the single Cys replacements as opposed to the full sensitivity of the wild type protein and the reason for the differential exposure to the various sulfhydryl-reactive agents were further probed. As seen above (Fig. 5), PCMB, but not PCMBS, brings about a small but significant inhibition of the activity of the CL and CLC39 protein when the proteoliposomes are pretreated and diluted 60-fold into the assay mixture. This effect of PCMB is due to a reversible and competitive inhibition of the CL protein as shown in Fig. 6A. When PCMB is added directly to the assay medium, a concentration-dependent inhibition is observed with an IC50 of about 150 µ. This concentration dependence is in line with what is observed in Fig. 5 (A and C), where the PCMB was added to the CL EmrE or to CLC39 prior to the reaction (for example at 4.5 m) and diluted 60-fold to 75 µ; the inhibition observed is about 25%. Since the CL protein has no Cys residues and since the inhibition of CL-mediated transport is reversible, these findings suggest an effect of PCMB independent of its reactivity with sulfhydryls. When this effect is analyzed kinetically, it is seen (Fig. 6A, inset) that the inhibition fits a fully competitive behavior with an apparent KI of 110 µ. The analog that bears a permanent negative charge (PCMBS) has very weak but reproducible inhibitory effect of about 15% at 1 m and 50% at 3 m (only part of the range is shown). It is concluded that PCMB behaves as a competitive inhibitor or a substrate of EmrE, while PCMBS is 30-fold less potent. To test whether PCMB is transported, a pH gradient was generated across the membrane of CL proteoliposomes and they were allowed to accumulate [14C]methyl viologen during 10 min. If no additions were made, uptake continued slowly for the next 5 min and increased by about 20% (Fig. 6B). If, however, PCMB or methyl viologen was added, a rapid decrease of the intraliposomal label was observed. This finding is explaine"

We also measured BP mRNA half-life and performed nuclear run-on experiments to study if tRA down-regulates BP by destabilizing the mRNA and/or by decreasing the rate of transcription. BP mRNA in ME-180 cells is very stable with a half-life of >16 h, and tRA decreased BP mRNA with a half-time of 5 h. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide blocked the tRA effect, suggesting that transcriptional regulation as well as de novo protein synthesis contribute to this post-transcriptional regulation of BP mRNA levels. In addition, tRA decreased the rate of BP gene transcription by 2- to 3-fold within 1 h.

Kavanagh J.J. Paredes-Espinoza M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 499-500Google Scholar). squamous cell carcinoma binding protein for fibroblast growth factors (GenBank M60047) fibroblast growth factor kilobases all-trans-retinoic acid improved minimal essential medium glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The mechanisms by which retinoids suppress carcinogenesis and regulate differentiation and the expression of the transformed phenotype in SCCs have not been elucidated. It is thought that nuclear retinoid receptors act as ligand-activated trans-acting factors that mediate the effects of retinoids on gene expression and thereby alter the growth and differentiation of normal and tumor cells. Most studies have stressed modulation of differentiation, examining markers such as transglutaminase type I, loricrin, involucrin, filaggrin, and keratin K1 (11Lotan R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 17F (suppl.): 167-174Google Scholar). Recently, we found that tRA inhibits in vivo progression of a human SCC model system (ME-180 cells), and we hypothesized that the tRA action was through an inhibition of stromal cell-induced angiogenesis as well as stimulation of tumor apoptosis. 2E. D. E. Liaudet-Coopman and A. Wellstein, unpublished data. The mechanism of the anti-angiogenic action of tRA in vivo is not known, but it could be due to the inhibitory effect on endothelial cell proliferation as well as to the production or release of angiogenic factors by tumor cells. Although it has been described that tRA decreased the transcription rate of epidermal growth factor receptor in ME-180 cells (12Zheng Z.S. Polakowska R. Johnson A. Goldsmith L.A. Cell. Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 225-232Google Scholar), classical angiogenic growth factors, such as FGFs, or vascular endothelial cell growth factor or their receptors have not been reported to be down-regulated by retinoids. Another possibility could be that tRA down-regulates auxiliary proteins required for the mechanism of action of angiogenic factors. A potential candidate could be a binding protein for FGFs (BP) that has been shown to positively modulate the activity of FGFs (13Czubayko F. Smith R.V. Chung H.C. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28243-28248Google Scholar), and the present study reports on the regulation of BP gene expression by tRA. BP is a secreted protein that binds to aFGF and bFGF in a non-covalent reversible manner (14Wu D. Kan M. Sato G.H. Okamoto T. Sato J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16778-16785Google Scholar). BP mRNA has been found to be expressed at high levels in SCC from patients and in SCC cell lines of different origin. We showed that expression of BP in a non-tumorigenic human cell line (SW-13), which expresses bFGF, leads to a tumorigenic and angiogenic phenotype of these cells (13Czubayko F. Smith R.V. Chung H.C. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28243-28248Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of BP in these cells obviously solubilizes their endogenous bFGF from its extracellular storage and allows it to reach its receptor suggesting that BP serves as an extracellular carrier molecule for bFGF. Our current results show that BP expression is rapidly reduced by tRA and that both post-transcriptional and transcriptional events combine to regulate BP abundance in tRA-treated SCC cells. Squamous cell carcinoma cell lines ME-180, FaDu, A431, SCC25, NCI-H596, and SW900 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were cultured in improved minimal essential medium (IMEM) (Biofluids, Inc., Rockville, MD) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). ME-180 cells were grown to 80% confluence on 150-mm tissue culture dishes, washed twice in serum-free IMEM, and then treated with tRA (Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc., San Diego, CA) in serum-free IMEM. Total RNA was isolated with the RNA STAT-60 method using commercially available reagents and protocols (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX). 30 µg of total RNA were separated by electrophoresis in 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel and then blotted onto nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The blots were prehybridized in 6 × SSC (0.9 sodium chlorate, 0.09 sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 5 × Denhardt's solution (0.1% (w/v) Ficoll, 0.1% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 100 µg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA (Life Technologies, Inc.)) for 4 h at 42°C. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 42°C in the same buffer. After hybridization, blots were washed three times with 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS for 10 min at 42°C and once with 1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 65°C. Autoradiography was performed using intensifying screens at −70°C. Blots were stripped by boiling 2 × for 10 min in 1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS. Hybridization probes were prepared by random-primed DNA labeling (Boehringer Mannheim) of purified insert fragments from human BP (13Czubayko F. Smith R.V. Chung H.C. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28243-28248Google Scholar), human RARβ, and RARγ (Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc.) and human GAPDH (CLONTECH). The final concentration of the labeled probes was always greater than 2 × 106 cpm/ml of hybridization solution. Quantitation of mRNA levels was performed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). ME-180 cells were grown to 80% confluence on 150-mm tissue culture dishes. Cells were treated with 10−5 tRA in serum-free IMEM, and nuclei from 107 cells for each time point were isolated after incubation in lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 as described in Ref. 15Martin M.B. Riegel A.T. Schoenberg D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2355-2361Google Scholar. Nuclear run-on experiments were performed with [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Corp.). Equal amounts of radioactivity (0.5-1 × 107 cpm) were hybridized to nitrocellulose filters containing 3 µg of each plasmid. After hybridization for 4 days at 42°C, the filters were washed four times with 2 × saline/sodium/phosphate/EDTA, 0.1% SDS for 5 min at 25°C and treated for 30 min at 25°C in 2 × saline/sodium/phosphate/EDTA containing 20 µg/ml RNase A. The filters were then washed four times for 30 min in 1 × saline/sodium/phosphate/EDTA, 1% SDS at 65°C. The amount of radioactivity present in each slot was determined using a PhosphorImager after overnight exposure, and autoradiograms were exposed for 1-3 days with intensifying screens. To study regulation of BP gene expression by retinoids in SCC, six human SCC cell lines were treated with tRA (10−5) for 24 h. As demonstrated in the Northern blots in Fig. 1, tRA decreased BP mRNA levels. PhosphorImager analysis showed that the reduction was by 79, 73, 83, 76, 89, and 39% in ME-180, FaDU, A431, SCC25, NCI-H596, and SW900 cells, respectively. The standard error of these experiments was less than 10% (n = 2-4 experiments/cell line). GAPDH mRNA remained unaffected by tRA treatment, as judged relative to the total amount of RNA loaded and was used to standardize the different mRNAs analyzed. Alternatively, β-actin was used. These data show that the tRA-induced down-regulation of BP mRNA is a general phenomenon in human SCC cell lines although the extent appears to differ. We selected ME-180 cells for more detailed studies into the mechanisms of regulation of BP gene expression. The time course and dose dependence of tRA-induced down-regulation of BP mRNA in ME-180 cells are shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3. tRA (10−5) induced an 80% decrease in the steady-state level of BP mRNA after 24 h (Fig. 2). The maximum effect was reached 8-12 h after tRA exposure with a half-time of 5 h for this effect and remained constant in the continuous presence of tRA for another 24 h. As a positive control gene, we used RARγ (16Zou C.-P. Clifford J.L. Xu X.-C. Sacks P.G. Chambon P. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5479-5487Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, tRA rapidly induced a 2-fold increase in the steady-state level of RARγ mRNA. In contrast, RARα and RARβ mRNA levels were not modulated by tRA treatment (data not shown). The decrease of the BP mRNA was dependent on the concentration of tRA (Fig. 3). An 80% decrease in the steady-state level of BP mRNA was observed in cells grown for 24 h in the presence of 10 µ tRA, and we estimate the half-maximal effective concentration as 200 n tRA. Consistent with previous reports, we observed no toxicity of tRA (10−5) on ME-180 cells (12Zheng Z.S. Polakowska R. Johnson A. Goldsmith L.A. Cell. Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 225-232Google Scholar).Fig. 3Concentration dependence of BP mRNA down-regulation by tRA in ME-180 cells. Cells were exposed for 24 h to different concentrations of tRA. Northern analyses were as described in the legend to Fig. 1, using 30 µg of total RNA/lane. Signal intensities were quantified by phosphoimaging and normalized to GAPDH. A representative Northern blot is shown in panel A, and quantitative data are shown in panel B. The mean ± S.E. of two separate experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We then studied the reversibility of the tRA effect on BP mRNA (Fig. 4). ME-180 cells were incubated for 24 h with tRA (10−5), and at 0, 8, 16, and 24 h after removal of tRA, RNA was isolated. BP mRNA levels increased from 20 to 71% of control value by 8 h and reached control levels by 24 h after removal of tRA. These data show that tRA-induced down-modulation of BP mRNA is a reversible phenomenon. The tRA-induced decrease in BP mRNA steady-state levels could be the result of a post-transcriptional or a transcriptional effect or a combination of both. We first assessed whether tRA treatment affected the stability of the BP mRNA. For that, experiments were performed to determine whether the addition of inhibitors of transcription (actinomycin D) or translation (cycloheximide) could inhibit the tRA-induced modulation of BP mRNA. Actinomycin D (5 µg/ml) or cycloheximide (10 µg/ml) was added without or with tRA (10−5), and BP mRNA levels were determined at various time points (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). As can be seen in Fig. 5, the BP mRNA level did not change within 16 h after the addition of actinomycin D. To assure that the concentration of actinomycin D was sufficient to block transcription, we probed the same blots for two mRNA species with a relatively short half-life, i.e. RARβ and RARγ (17Hu L. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 391-396Google Scholar). Both mRNA levels were found to decrease after the actinomycin D treatment (see Fig. 5) as expected after transcription blockade. Furthermore, these data show that BP mRNA is relatively stable in ME-180 cells with a half-life of over 16 h. Simultaneous addition of tRA and actinomycin D completely blocked the effects of tRA (Fig. 5) as did cycloheximide (Fig. 6). This indicates that transcription as well as new protein synthesis are necessary for the tRA-induced down-regulation of BP mRNA.Fig. 6Effect of cycloheximide on the expression of BP mRNA. ME-180 cells were cultured for 8 or 16 h in the absence or presence of 10−5 tRA in combination with 10 µg/ml cycloheximide. Total RNA was isolated and hybridized to BP and GAPDH probes as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Northern blot analyses were performed with 30 µg of total RNA/lane. The mean ± S.E. of two separate experiments is shown. □, tRA; ⋄, cycloheximide; ∘, tRA + cycloheximide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test whether a short time of tRA treatment would be sufficient to bring about degradation of BP mRNA, ME-180 cells were pretreated for 4 h with 10−5 tRA and then actinomycin D was added to further inhibit transcription (Fig. 7). In comparison with tRA treatment alone (cf. Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5), the addition of actinomycin D after tRA pretreatment did not affect the further decline of BP mRNA. This suggests that short term control of BP mRNA levels by tRA is predominantly regulated via mRNA stability. To determine whether tRA also affects the rate of transcription of the BP gene, we next performed nuclear run-on experiments. Nuclei were isolated from ME-180 cells treated with tRA 10−5 for 1, 6, and 24 h, and nascent transcripts were hybridized to filter-bound plasmid probes as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig. 8, tRA caused a decrease in BP transcription 1 h after treatment. In two independent experiments, BP transcription was down-regulated 2- to 3-fold between 1 and 24 h of treatment. Normalization to β-actin transcription was used as a control since it remained unchanged by tRA in ME-180 cells as reported by others (12Zheng Z.S. Polakowska R. Johnson A. Goldsmith L.A. Cell. Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 225-232Google Scholar). These data show that tRA inhibits BP transcription in addition to the above effects on mRNA stability. In the embryo, retinoic acid has been implicated as the natural morphogen responsible for pattern formation in developing chick limb buds (18Thaller C. Eichele G. Nature. 1987; 327: 625-628Google Scholar), acting via nuclear hormone receptors of the steroid and thyroid hormone receptor superfamilies. These receptors have been thought to act primarily through direct modulation of gene transcription (19Evans R. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Google Scholar), but additional evidence has also emerged that ligands for these receptors are capable of influencing steady-state mRNA levels through post-transcriptional mechanisms, mainly through mRNA stabilization (20Nielsen D.A. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 953-957Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids stabilize human growth hormone mRNA (21Paek I. Axel R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1496-1507Google Scholar); estrogens stabilize the low density lipoprotein II and vitellogenin mRNAs (22Cochrane A.W. Deely R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 555-567Google Scholar); and retinoic acid stabilizes the keratin 19 mRNA (23Crowe D.L. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 183-188Google Scholar), c-fos mRNA (24Busam K.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2267-2273Google Scholar), and proteolipid protein mRNA (25Lopez-Barahona M. Minano M. Mira E. Iglesia T. Stunnenberg H.G. Rodriguez-Pena A. Munoz A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 805-814Google Scholar). However, there are examples of mRNAs whose stability is decreased by these hormones. Estrogens accelerate the turnover of albumin mRNA in Xenopus liver (26Schoenberg D.R. Moskaitis J.E. Smith L.H. Pastori R.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 805-814Google Scholar) and estrogen receptor mRNA in human mammary adenocarcinoma cells (27Saceda M. Lippman M.E. Lindsey R.K. Puente M. Martin M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1782-1787Google Scholar). It has also been reported that glucocorticoids increase the turnover of c-myc mRNA (28Maroder M. Martinotti S. Vacca A. Screpanti I. Petrangeli E. Frati L. Gulino A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1153-1157Google Scholar) and thymidine kinase (Tk-1) (29Frost G.H. Rhee K. Thompson Jr., E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6748-6754Google Scholar). Retinoic acid has been shown to destabilize adipsin mRNA (30Antras J. Lasnier F. Pairault J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1157-1161Google Scholar), tyrosine aminotransferase mRNA (31Pan C.J. Shelly L.L. Rabin D.S. Chou J.Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 572-580Google Scholar), and myeloblastin mRNA (32Labbaye C. Zhang J. Casanova J.L. Lanotte M. Teng J. Miller W.H. Cayre Y.E. Blood. 1993; 81: 475-481Google Scholar). In this report, we show that tRA rapidly down-regulates BP mRNA. This BP mRNA modulation is a general feature since it was observed in six SCC cell lines. The tRA-induced down-regulation of BP mRNA in the ME-180 cell is due to a combined decrease in the stability of its mRNA and of the transcriptional rate of the gene. Our data show that BP mRNA is generally very stable in ME-180 cells. We were not able to precisely determine the half-life of BP mRNA because blockade of transcription by exposure of cells to actinomycin D for longer than 16 h leads to general cytotoxicity. Clearly, the half-life of BP mRNA is longer than 16 h, and we conclude that the early down-regulation of steady-state BP mRNA by tRA is mainly due to increased turnover of the BP mRNA. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide block the effects of tRA when either inhibitor is added simultaneously with tRA. Furthermore, once tRA has been allowed to act for 4 h, the addition of actinomycin D no longer affects the decline of BP mRNA brought about by the initial treatment with tRA. Since parallel addition of actinomycin D and of tRA blocked the down-regulation of BP mRNA, the data also imply that tRA rapidly induces transcription of a gene product that decreases the stability of BP mRNA. The data preclude the alternative possibility that tRA inhibits the expression of a gene product that is required to stabilize a generically unstable BP mRNA. If the latter were the case, one would expect any nonspecific inhibitor of transcription or translation (e.g. actinomycin D and cycloheximide) to accelerate the degradation of BP mRNA due to the reduction of the stabilizing gene product. Reversibility of the tRA effect within 24 h after removal of the drug furthermore indicates that the product induced has a relatively short half-life. Several studies have provided some insight into the nature of mRNA decay (33Brawerman G. Cell. 1987; 48: 5-6Google Scholar) and have identified structural features that determine susceptibility to decay, and we wondered whether BP mRNA would contain any signature sequence that may confer regulatability of RNA stability. The selectivity of mRNA decay can be best explained by the action of specific factors, acting in trans, that recognize unique cis-elements in the mRNA. Endonucleolytic cuts triggered by interactions between trans-acting factors and cis-elements result in rapid mRNA destruction. A specific sequence promoting mRNA decay (5′-AUUUA-3′) has been identified in the 3′-noncoding regions of a variety of mRNAs (34Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Google Scholar). The manner in which this sequence promotes mRNA decay is unknown although it may be recognized and cleaved by a specific endonuclease. Recent studies identified functionally independent determinants within the c-fos transcript that specifically target this message for rapid decay (24Busam K.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2267-2273Google Scholar). One of the determinants is this AU-rich element that is present in the 3′-untranslated region of c-fos mRNA. A second c-fos instability determinant, which is located in the protein coding region of the c-fos message, is structurally unrelated to this element. Interestingly, we found that an AU-rich element is also present in the 3′-noncoding sequence of human BP mRNA, and we speculate that this sequence might be regulating stability. Our experiments also provide evidence for transcriptional down-regulation of BP in addition to the post-transcriptional effects. We show that the decrease in BP transcription begins very early, 1 h following tRA addition (Fig. 8). From the relatively fast kinetics of tRA-mediated effects on BP gene expression, it is tempting to speculate that the response may be controlled by a direct interaction between a retinoic acid receptor and transcriptional regulatory sequences in the BP gene. However, the fast negative response of the transcription rate to a nuclear receptor ligand does not necessarily imply a direct interaction between receptor and promoter, but it may be in parallel with the negative regulatory mechanism, e.g. described for the interaction between the glucocorticoid receptor and AP1 transcription factors (35Yang-Yen H.F. Chambard J.C. Sun Y.L. Smeal T. Schmidt T.J. Drouin J. Karin M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1205-1215Google Scholar). On the other hand, our findings could also be explained by the existence of a negative tRA response element in the BP promoter as shown for other genes (36Tomic M. Jiang C.K. Epstein H.S. Freedberg I.M. Samuels H.H. Blumenberg M. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 965-973Google Scholar, 37Lipkin S.M. Nelson C.A. Glass C.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In conclusion, tRA down-regulates BP gene expression in different SCC cell lines, and more detailed studies with a representative cell line show that this down-regulation occurs both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Interestingly, the tRA effects on BP mRNA stability are sensitive to actinomycin D and cycloheximide, suggesting that tRA-induced gene transcription and protein synthesis are required for the destabilizing effect on BP mRNA.

Chem. 1987; 262: 13180-13187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP is not required, however, for specific binding of the UvrA to damaged sites. For example, ATPγS completely inhibits specific binding of UvrA to damaged sites, whereas nonspecific binding is enhanced. In the presence of ATP there is a little unwinding (ΔL = 0.5) of a supercoiled DNA, whereas there is about 100° or about 3 bp of unwinding per (UvrA)2 when ATP is substituted for ATPγS (9Oh E.Y. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8557-8571Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). When damaged DNAs are included in an unwinding reaction, the UvrA protein induces enhanced unwinding of the DNA helix. A UvrA mutant with cysteine substitution for phenylalanine at 740 failed to bind to dsDNA and ssDNA (10Wang J. Mueller K.L. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10771-10775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the C-terminal zinc finger motif of UvrA possesses a DNA binding activity. From velocity sedimentation experiments, it was suggested that UvrA and UvrB subunits interact to form a complex in solution in a UvrA-to-UvrB stoichiometry of 2:1 (11Orren D.K. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The ATPase resulting from interaction of UvrA and UvrB had a lower Km and Vmax of UvrA when compared to UvrA by itself (12Oh E.Y. Claassen L. Thiagalingam S. Mazur S. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4145-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Several experimental facts suggest that UvrA and UvrB proteins form nucleoprotein complexes with undamaged DNA. In DNA unwinding experiments, the UvrAB complex induced a 150° to 220° unwinding of undamaged DNA per UvrA dimer in the presence of ATPγS, nearly twice that seen for UvrA alone (9Oh E.Y. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8557-8571Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The UvrA protein in the presence of increasing amounts of UvrB induces a gradual increase in the unwinding of damaged DNA. The cryptic UvrB ATPase became activated by UvrA in the presence of dsDNA, ssDNA, or UV dsDNA (13Caron P.R. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10891-10902Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 14Seeley T.W. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6577-6581Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Associated with the DNA unwinding activity and the ssDNA-stimulated ATPase activity of the UvrAB complex is a unique helicase-like activity (15Oh E.Y. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3638-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The UvrAB helicase acts unidirectionally (5′ to 3′) on short duplexes and D-looped DNA. This helicase activity requires nucleoside triphosphate-hydrolysis of either ATP or dATP (16Oh E.Y. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1336-1343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It also shows a strong preference for unwinding duplex DNA possessing a 5′ ssDNA flanking region (17Oh, E. Y., 1987, Mechanism of DNA Repair. Ph.D. thesis, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.Google Scholar). The strand displacement activity of the UvrAB complex is inhibited by UV photoproducts. Like other DNA helix-tracking processes, the ATP-dependent action of the UvrAB complex simultaneously generates both transient positive and negative supercoils in relaxed covalently closed circular DNA templates (18Koo H.S. Claassen L. Grossman L. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Slow dissociation of the UvrA from single-stranded DNA and a marginal discrimination factor of UvrA between damaged and undamaged DNA molecules may contribute to the processivisity of the helicase activity of the UvrAB complex which needs to translocate along the strand to which the complex binds (7Mazur S.J. Grossman L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4432-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Grossman L. Thiagalingam S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16871-16874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this model, the UvrAB complex binds initially to undamaged sites followed by unidirectional translocation along the DNA. This raises the question whether there are preferred binding sites in undamaged DNA. Because of the effects on the RNAP-induced DNA structure around the transcription start site on DNA repair by UvrABC endonuclease, bubble and loop regions in duplex DNA were examined for binding sites of the UvrAB complex independent of RNAP. Here we report that the UvrAB complex binds to bubble and loop regions with an affinity similar to that for damaged DNA, and that preferential incision was observed in the strand complementary to the strand along which the UvrAB complex translocates. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. or New England Biolabs and used in buffers suggested by the supplier. T4 DNA ligase was obtained from New England Biolabs. T4 polynucleotide kinase was from Life Technologies, Inc. Sequenase version 2.0 and plasmid pTZ18U were purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. The enhanced chemiluminesence (ECL) kit was purchased from Amersham Corp. P1 nuclease, bacteriophage M13KO7 and plasmid pTZ18R were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. E. coli strain DH5α (F−, end A1, his R17(rk−, mk+), sup E44, thi −1, λ−, rec A1, gyr A96, rel A1, Δ(argF−lac zya)U169, φ80 lac ZΔM15) was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The E. coli CJ 236 (dut 1, ung 1, thi 1, rel A1/pC 105[F′, Cm]) used to generate uracil-containing phage was from Dr. J. D. Roberts, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, NC. UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC proteins were purified as described previously (20Yeung A.T. Mattes W.B. Oh E.Y. Yoakum G.H. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14 (a): 8535-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized using a MilliGen/Biosearch 7500 automated synthesizer supplied by Scott D. Morrow of the Oligonucleotide Synthesis Facility in the Department of Biochemistry at the Johns Hopkins University. The plasmids pTZ18R and pTZ18U were purified using the Qiagen column protocol. Calf thymus DNA was from Sigma. ATP and ATPγS were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech. Radioisotopes, such as [γ-32P]ATP, [α-32P]dCTP, [α-32P]dGTP, and [α-32P]TTP, were obtained from ICN Radiochemicals. The synthesized oligomers were annealed to make short DNA duplexes; GC, GC-bubble, and AT (Fig. 1A). Each complementary strand within a filling-in buffer for Sequenase was heated at 65°C for 20 min and then cooled to room temperature. The 3′ ends of annealed oligomers were labeled with [α-32P]dNTPs using the filling-in function of Sequenase. The labeled DNA molecules were further purified from an 8% native polyacrylamide gel (10 × 8 × 0.1 cm). The CJ 236 strain of E. coli transformed with pTZ18U was used to generate uracil containing ssDNA (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cells from a minimal plate were grown at 37°C until mid-log phase (A595 of 0.4) in 2 × YT medium supplemented with 0.25 µg/ml uridine. The mid-log phase cells were infected with M13KO7 at a multiplicity of infection of about 10, and continued incubation at 37°C for 1 h and 15 min. Kanamycin was added to a final concentration of 75 µg/ml and the culture continued shaking at 220 rpm for 12 h. The supernatant fraction of the culture was used to prepare the ssDNA in a standard method for phage preparation (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was followed as described by Kunkel et al. (40Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar). Two primers, the “Bubble” primer (5′-CCGCTCACTTAAGGTGTGTTCATACGAGCCGG-3′) and the “Loop” primer (5′-CGCTCACAAAAGGGAGATCTTGRGAACATACGAGC-3′), were used in this study. Changed sequences were verified by DNA sequencing for a bubble region and a restriction (BglII) digestion for loop formation. A colony harboring a plasmid containing the changed sequence was selected, and then circular ssDNA was prepared by M13KO7 phage infections. The purified single-stranded DNAs were irradiated with UV light and annealed with complementary circular ssDNA molecules (pTZ18R). A DNA fragment (187 bp) containing the bubble or loop region was obtained by cutting with restriction enzymes (AseI and AccI) and labeled at the 3′ end by a filling-in reaction. The labeled fragment was further separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel (10 × 8 × 0.1 cm) and eluted from the gel. DNA molecules were placed on parafilm floating on ice water and irradiated by ultraviolet (UV) light from a germicidal lamp at 130 J/min/m2. Single-stranded DNA molecules were irradiated to 400 J/m2 - 1.0 kJ/m2. The standard binding buffer contains 30 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 85 m KCl, 10 m MgCl2, 1 m DTT, and 100 µg/ml BSA. The filter buffer is the binding buffer without DTT and BSA. The UvrA protein (various concentrations) was added to labeled DNAs in the binding buffer. After 10-15 min of incubation, unlabeled and unirradiated CTD was added to a final concentration of 100 µ (bp) for a 10-s challenge immediately prior to filtration or loading on 4.5% polyacrylamide gels (10 × 8 × 0.1 cm). In the brief challenge, only the rapidly dissociating complexes and free proteins are removed (7Mazur S.J. Grossman L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4432-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose membrane filters were soaked in the filter binding buffer prior to use. For experiments with DNA containing a bubble region, the filters were soaked in 0.4 KOH for 20 min, then rinsed extensively with distilled water, and stored at 4°C in the filter binding buffer until used (7Mazur S.J. Grossman L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4432-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The sample (20 µl) was filtered at a rate of 100 µl/4 s and the filters washed with 300 µl of the filter binding buffer. The filters were dried for 10 min under a heat lamp, and the radioactivities determined by scintillation counting. Nucleoprotein complexes were resolved in 4.5-5% polyacrylamide gels (10 × 8 × 0.1 cm)/1 × TBE (89 m Tris, 89 m borate, and 1 m EDTA) at 70 volts and 15-20 mA at room temperature. For the detection of the UvrAB-DNA complex, the gel and running buffer containing 10 m MgCl2 and 1 m ATP was preequilibrated for 60 min. Apparent dissociation constants for UvrA or UvrAB binding to DNA substrate can be determined by measuring the extent of complex formation as a function of protein concentration. The dissociation constant (Kd) was determined at 50% formation of nucleoprotein complexes. The rates of association of UvrA or UvrAB to DNA substrates were measured by adding an aliquot of UvrA or UvrAB to a solution of 32P-labeled DNA fragments in the binding buffer with ATP on ice. After a rapid mixing by a quick spin at 4°C, the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37°C. The reaction samples were challenged at varying times by the addition of 100 µ (bp) CTD for 10 s before being filtered through nitrocellulose filters or loading into polyacrylamide gels. The challenge removes UvrA nonspecifically bound to DNA. The rate of complex formation is given by the following equations (38Riggs A.D. Bourgeois S. Cohn M. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 53: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) kat=1P-DlnD(P-PD)P(D-PD)(Eq. 1) kat1/2=1P-Dln2(Eq. 1) where t1/2 denotes time at which complex formation is 50% and P and D correspond to the initial concentration UvrA and GC-bubble DNA substrates. The rate of dissociation of UvrA-bubble DNA or UvrAB-bubble DNA complexes was measured by the addition of CTD. UvrA or UvrA plus UvrB were incubated with 32P-labeled GC-bubble oligomers in the binding buffer at 37°C for 15 min. The dissociation was initiated by adding CTD at 37°C to a final concentration of 100 µ (bp). The amount of the labeled DNA bound as a function time was determined by the nitrocellulose filter binding assay. Dissociation kinetic data were analyzed by the following equations (38Riggs A.D. Bourgeois S. Cohn M. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 53: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) −kdt=lnPDPD0(Eq. 3) −kdt1/2=ln12(Eq. 4) where PDo represents the extent of protein-DNA complex at zero times and PD denotes the extent of remaining protein-DNA complex at various times. Proteins were incubated with GC-bubble oligomers at 37°C for 15 min, and protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was soaked in 1 × chamber buffer (25 m Tris, 192 m glycine, pH 8.3) for 30 min to equilibrate. The proteins in the gel were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using the Hoefer protocol. A monoclonal antibody against UvrA and UvrB (22Kovalsky O.I. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27421-27426Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) were used in this blotting. Protein bands were detected by the ECL kit. End-labeled DNA substrates containing bubble or loop regions were incubated with UvrA and UvrB proteins in the presence of 45 ng of unlabeled plasmid DNA in the DNA binding buffer for 10 min at 37°C. After incubation, the reactions were mixed with 1 µl of 100 m KMnO4 and incubated for 2 min at 37°C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 2 µl of 8.3 β-mercaptoethanol and placed on ice, followed by the addition of 23 µl of stop solution (4 NH4OAc and 35 m EDTA) (23Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8074-8081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lee D.N. Landick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 759-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). After a phenol/chloroform extraction, each sample was precipitated with six volumes of 100% ethanol and 20 µg of glycogen and then treated with 1 -piperidine as described by Maxam and Gilbert (25Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8973) Google Scholar). Sequencing reactions were performed as described by Maxam and Gilbert with the end-labeled DNAs. After drying in vacuo, all samples were resuspended in formamide loading buffer (85% formamide, 1 × TBE, 0.01% xylene cyanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) and electrophoresed through a 5% sequencing gel (40 × 38 × 0.04 cm) in 1 × TBE. The gel was dried and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film using a DuPont Lighting Plus intensifying screen or to the Phosphor imaging plate. The extent of KMnO4 reactivity was quantified by use of a Fuji PhosphorImager. The reaction mixture, as prepared in the KMnO4 reaction, was incubated with 1 µl of P1 nuclease (1 units/µl) for 30 s at 37°C. The reaction was terminated according to the procedure in the KMnO4 reaction. Precipitated DNAs were resuspended in the formamide loading buffer and electrophoresed through a 5% sequencing gel. Each reaction mixture was conducted in a volume of 10 µl. The final reaction compositions were 30 m Tris, 85 m KCl, 10 m MgCl2, 1 m DTT, 100 µg/ml BSA, and 2 m ATP. After incubating the DNA substrates with 7.5 n UvrA and 34 n UvrB protein at 37°C for 10 min, incision was initiated by the addition of 30 n UvrC protein and incubated for 5 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 µl of the formamide loading buffer and heated immediately at 90°C for 3 min. The samples were loaded onto a 5-6% sequencing gel. The M. luteus UV-endonuclease reaction was carried out using the same conditions as that in the UvrABC incision reaction. The extent of incision was quantified by use of a Fuji PhosphorImager. To investigate the binding of UvrA to undamaged DNAs, a synthetic DNA oligomer containing a 12-base pair DNA mismatch and oligomers with various G+C levels (Fig. 1A) were used in a gel mobility shift assay. Fig. 1B shows the gel mobility shift assay monitoring UvrA binding to the DNA substrates in the presence of ATP. A stable nucleoprotein complex was formed only with GC-bubble oligomers, having been challenged with a high concentration of unlabeled DNA prior to being loaded on a 4.5% native polyacrylamide gel. UvrA seems to bind to this substrate as a dimer, as already described (7Mazur S.J. Grossman L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4432-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Duplex DNA oligomers (GC and AT) and the fragment (GN) of a similar length showed less than 5% of complex formation over the same ranges of UvrA concentration. In Fig. 1C, the binding of UvrA to the GC-bubble oligomer is presented as a function of UvrA concentration. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) for of the UvrA is 5 × 10−9. The binding constant for the GC-bubble oligomer can be compared to values for damaged sites (Table I): 1 × 108−1 for the psoralen adduct thymine-4′-hydroxymethyl-4,5′,8-trimethyl (8van Houten B. Gamper H. Sancar A. Hearst J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13180-13187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 3.7 × 108−1 for the (6Sancar A. Rupp W.D. Cell. 1983; 33: 249-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) photoproduct; 4.2 × 108 for the trans,syn-dimer (27Reardon J.T. Nichols A.F. Keeney S. Smith C.A. Taylor J.-S. Linn S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21301-21308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 2 × 109−1 for UV-damaged DNA (7Mazur S.J. Grossman L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4432-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The affinity of UvrA binding to the GC-bubble oligomer is similar to that for damaged DNA. The stimulation of the ATPase of the UvrAB complex in the presence of dsDNA or ssDNA suggests that the UvrAB complex is able to bind productively to these DNA molecules (12Oh E.Y. Claassen L. Thiagalingam S. Mazur S. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4145-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To enable demonstration of the potential helicase activity, the UvrAB complex needs to bind to single-stranded regions in a helicase substrate. However, no UvrAB-DNA (undamaged) complex has been detected directly because the UvrA dissociates very quickly from undamaged DNA. Fig. 2A shows a gel mobility shift assay monitoring the formation of the UvrAB-DNA complex with the GC-bubble oligomer. To stabilize nucleoprotein complexes during electrophoresis, 1 m ATP and 10 m MgCl2 were included in a gel and buffer. A constant amount of UvrB was incubated with increasing amounts of UvrA protein (lanes 5-8). A new shifted band appeared in the presence of UvrB proteins when compared to a band in the presence of UvrA alone (lanes 1-4). There was no UvrA-DNA complex observed in the presence of over a 2-fold excess of UvrB, indicating that most of the UvrA formed UvrAB complexes. The formation of this new nucleoprotein complex depends on the presence of UvrB proteins. The constituents of the protein-DNA complexes separated on gels were detected by Western blotting (Fig. 2B). After a gel mobility shift assay, proteins were electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and then followed by detection as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lane 1 shows the position of migration of free UvrA. In the absence of the GC-bubble oligomer, UvrA protein was detected below the well because UvrA became bound to CTD nonspecifically (lane 2). In the presence of GC-bubble oligomer, a single band was detected in lane 3 even when challenged by CTD. This band is in the same position as that of the DNA shift band in Fig. 2A (lanes 1-4), indicating that the protein band in the Western blot is associated with the GC-bubble oligomer. In the presence of UvrB protein, a new shifted band was observed but the UvrA-DNA band disappeared (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5). The position of the new shifted band matched to that in Fig. 2A (lanes 5 to 8). UvrB alone is not able to bind to any type of DNA (28Yeung A.T. Mattes W.B. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14 (b): 2567-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In lane 7, free UvrB was detected but no UvrB-CTD was detected. When the UvrB was incubated with UvrA and the GC-bubble oligomer, a shifted band was detected (Fig. 2B, lanes 8 and 9), which is in the same position in Fig. 2A (lanes 4 and 5). Therefore, the shifted DNA contains both the UvrA and UvrB protein, indicating that the UvrAB complex is able to form a stable nucleoprotein complex with the GC-bubble oligomer. This detection of the UvrAB-DNA (undamaged) complex is the first directly monitoring the intermediate of the preincision complex. From the DNA binding experiments involving UvrA with the GC-bubble oligomer, a filter efficiency of 0.7 was obtained. In detecting the UvrAB-DNA complex, a 30% formation of UvrAB-DNA complexes was measured from the gel mobility shift assay (Fig. 2C) and a 75% complex obtained from the filter binding (Fig. 2D). The low level of formation in the gel may be due to the lack of stability of the UvrAB-DNA complex during electrophoresis. The binding of UvrAB to the GC-bubble oligomer was quantitated by nitrocellulose filter binding. The filter binding was carried out using varying UvrA concentrations ranging from 0 to 80 n in the presence of a 2-fold molar excess of UvrB (Fig. 2D). The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was determined as the amount of UvrA protein existing as a monomer that resulted in 50% of the protein being bound to the DNA. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd = 5 × 10−9) for UvrAB to the GC-bubble oligomer is remarkably similar to that of UvrA (Table I). In addition, this constant is similar to that measured with UvrA for AP-DNA and UvrAB for BA-DNA (29Snowden A. Van Houten B. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 19-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The rate of association of UvrA with the GC-bubble oligomer was determined by measuring the extent of formation of UvrA-DNA complex at various times. A value for the association rate constant was then determined (see “Experimental Procedures”). The experimentally determined association rate constant for UvrA binding to the GC-bubble oligomer was 1.1 × 106−1 s−1 (Table I), which is greater than that estimated for single-stranded DNA (7Mazur S.J. Grossman L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4432-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The association rate constant for UvrAB-DNA complex formation was also obtained from filter binding experiments. The experimentally determined association rate constant for the UvrAB complex binding to the GC-bubble oligomer was 1.4 × 106−1 s−1 (Table I), which is similar to that for UvrA alone. The time course for the dissociation process of UvrA from the GC-bubble oligomer revealed a half-life of 80 min for the Uvr-DNA complex, corresponding to a dissociation rate of kd = 1.4 × 10−4 s−1. This rate constant is less than that (3.7 × 10−3 s−1) of UV-damaged sites (7Mazur S.J. Grossman L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4432-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and other photoproducts (trans,syn -dimer; 1.1 × 10−3 s−1, Dewar photoproduct; 2.1 × 10−3 s−1) (27Reardon J.T. Nichols A.F. Keeney S. Smith C.A. Taylor J.-S. Linn S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21301-21308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Table I). The experimentally determined dissociation rate constant (kd) of the UvrAB complex is 1.5 × 10−3 s−1, corresponds to a half-life of 7.5 min. The UvrAB complex remained on the GC-bubble oligomer for less time than UvrA but longer than UvrA on damaged sites (7Mazur S.J. Grossman L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4432-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) (Table I). The results show that the presence of UvrB affects the complex stability or the dissociation rate, which may be due to the translocation of the UvrAB complex. The binding of UvrAB complex to the GC-bubble oligomer implies that a single-stranded region in duplex DNA may provide a preferred binding site for the UvrAB complex. This binding is consistent with the requirement for a single-stranded region for UvrAB helicase activity. Whether a bubble or loop region can serve as a start site for the translocation of the UvrAB complex and for repair by the UvrABC endonuclease is fundamental. Thus, a longer DNA substrate (187 bp) containing a bubble or loop region was constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To confirm the sequence and nature of the single-stranded region in a bubble and loop region, P1 nuclease and KMnO4 (30Hayatsu H. Ukita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 31Rubin C.M. Schmid C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 4613-4619Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) were used and the reactive sites were mapped (Fig. 3) P1 nuclease is specific for single-stranded region and digests a phosphodiester bond at pA-N residue (32Linn S.M. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1985Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, most of the P1 sites are cleaved. Thymines in single-stranded DNA regions are specifically modified by treatment with KMnO4, resulting in breakage of the phosphodiester bond by piperidine. The results from the treatment of both P1 nuclease and KMnO4 are consistent with the sequences in the bubble and loop region (Fig. 3), suggesting that the DNA fragment has a single-stranded region"
https://openalex.org/W2064550248,"The role of calcium as an activator and regulator of many biological processes is linked to the ability of the cell to rapidly change its cytoplasmic calcium levels. Calcium acts as an intracellular messenger in hormone-induced bud formation during the development of the moss Physcomitrella patens. Calcium transport and ligand binding studies have implicated plasma membrane-localized 1,4-dihydropyridine (DHP)-sensitive calcium channels in this increase in cellular calcium. To understand the regulation of the moss calcium channel, we investigated the involvement of GTP binding regulatory proteins (G proteins). Guanosine 5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate (GTPγS), a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog that locks G proteins into their active state, stimulated DHP binding to high affinity receptors in the moss plasma membrane. DHP binding was measured as the ability of the DHP agonist Bay K8644 or the DHP antagonist nifedipine to compete with the DHP arylazide [3H]azidopine for binding to moss plasma membranes. G protein stimulation of binding was seen when competition was carried out with either nifedipine or Bay K8644. G proteins regulated the rates of association and dissociation of bound [3H]azidopine, and stimulation was dependent on GTPγS concentration. Guanosine 5′-(β-thio)diphosphate, a GDP analog that locks G proteins into their inactivated state, did not affect the dose dependence of either the agonist or the antagonist. These results suggest that G proteins may act via a membrane-delimited pathway to regulate calcium channels in the moss plasma membrane. The role of calcium as an activator and regulator of many biological processes is linked to the ability of the cell to rapidly change its cytoplasmic calcium levels. Calcium acts as an intracellular messenger in hormone-induced bud formation during the development of the moss Physcomitrella patens. Calcium transport and ligand binding studies have implicated plasma membrane-localized 1,4-dihydropyridine (DHP)-sensitive calcium channels in this increase in cellular calcium. To understand the regulation of the moss calcium channel, we investigated the involvement of GTP binding regulatory proteins (G proteins). Guanosine 5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate (GTPγS), a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog that locks G proteins into their active state, stimulated DHP binding to high affinity receptors in the moss plasma membrane. DHP binding was measured as the ability of the DHP agonist Bay K8644 or the DHP antagonist nifedipine to compete with the DHP arylazide [3H]azidopine for binding to moss plasma membranes. G protein stimulation of binding was seen when competition was carried out with either nifedipine or Bay K8644. G proteins regulated the rates of association and dissociation of bound [3H]azidopine, and stimulation was dependent on GTPγS concentration. Guanosine 5′-(β-thio)diphosphate, a GDP analog that locks G proteins into their inactivated state, did not affect the dose dependence of either the agonist or the antagonist. These results suggest that G proteins may act via a membrane-delimited pathway to regulate calcium channels in the moss plasma membrane. The growth and development of plants are strongly influenced by physiological and environmental signals. The pathway from these chemical or physical cues to a new developmental program involves biochemical and molecular changes in the cell. An important component in many of the signal transduction pathways in plants is a controlled change in cellular calcium concentrations through the coordination of passive fluxes and active transport across organellar and plasma membranes (1Gilroy S. Jones R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3591-3595Google Scholar, 2Neuhaus G. Bowler C. Kern R. Chua N.-H. Cell. 1993; 73: 937-952Google Scholar, 3Bush D.S. Annu. Rev. Plant Phys. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 95-122Google Scholar). One example of a dramatic developmental change that is modulated by calcium is the formation of buds during moss development (4Saunders M.J. Hepler P.K. Planta (Heidelb.). 1981; 152: 272-281Google Scholar, 5Saunders M.J. Hepler P.K. Science. 1982; 217: 943-945Google Scholar, 6Saunders M.J. Hepler P.K. Dev.

Plant Physiol. 1988; 86: 684-687Google Scholar, 9Markmann-Mulisch U. Bopp M. J. Plant Physiol. 1987; 129: 155-168Google Scholar). Early in moss development, a single cell spore germinates to form a thread-like protonema composed of a single cell type, the chloronema. Increased production of the hormone auxin induces divisions in the chloronema tip cell that give rise to a completely different cell type, the caulonema. Accumulation of the hormone bryokinin, an adenine-type cytokinin, induces development of buds from single initial cells that form on most caulonema cells (10Brandes H. Kende H. Plant Physiol. 1986; 43: 827-837Google Scholar). Formation of buds is an integral part of the moss life cycle; it leads to the development of the mature gametophyte and subsequent sexual reproduction. In vivo bud formation, calcium transport, and ligand binding studies implicated 1,4-dihydropyridine (DHP) 1The abbreviations used are: DHP1,4-dihydropyridinebis-tris propane1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propaneGTPγSguanosine 5′-(γ-thio)triphosphateGDPβSguanosine 5′-(β-thio)diphosphateGMP-PNP5′-guanylyl imidodiphosphate.-sensitive calcium channels in the increase in cellular calcium during moss development. In moss protonemata, application of DHP calcium channel agonists in the absence of cytokinin stimulated bud initial formation, whereas DHP calcium channel antagonists blocked cytokinin-induced bud formation (8Conrad P.A. Hepler P.K. Plant Physiol. 1988; 86: 684-687Google Scholar). Increases in calcium influx into moss protoplasts were seen within 15 s of addition of cytokinin, and calcium influx was inhibited by DHP antagonists and stimulated by DHP agonists (11Schumaker K.S. Gizinski M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10937-10941Google Scholar). DHP-sensitive binding of the DHP arylazide [3H]azidopine to purified moss plasma membranes was found to be cytokinin-dependent (12Schumaker K.S. Gizinski M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23461-23467Google Scholar). While physiological events implicating calcium in hormone-induced bud formation have been described, the biochemical pathways that link signal perception to channel regulation remain largely unknown. 1,4-dihydropyridine 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane guanosine 5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate guanosine 5′-(β-thio)diphosphate 5′-guanylyl imidodiphosphate. In animal cells, G proteins have been implicated in the direct regulation of calcium channels. G proteins are αβγ-heterotrimers that share a common set of βγ-dimers and differ in the composition of their α-subunits. The α-subunits are similar yet distinct gene products that bind and hydrolyze GTP and act on specific effectors. These plasma membrane-localized regulatory G proteins transduce extracellular signals into intracellular events by coupling to membrane receptors (13Brown A.M. Birnbaumer L. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: H401-H410Google Scholar); voltage-dependent calcium channels are common targets for direct G protein coupling independent of cytoplasmic factors (14Hescheler J. Rosenthal W. Trautwein W. Schultz G. Nature. 1987; 325: 445-447Google Scholar, 15Yatani A. Codina J. Imoto Y. Reeves J.P. Birnbaumer L. Brown A.M. Science. 1987; 238: 1288-1292Google Scholar, 16Yatani A. Imoto Y. Codina J. Hamilton S.L. Brown A.M. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9887-9895Google Scholar). Studies of the effect of G proteins on DHP binding indicate a role for G proteins in the response of calcium channel ligand binding to the channel in its resting state (17Bergamaschi S. Govoni S. Cominetti P. Parenti M. Trabucchi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 1279-1286Google Scholar, 18Dunn S.M.J. Bladen C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5716-5721Google Scholar). Evidence is accumulating for the presence and function of G proteins in plants. Plant G protein homologs have been identified in protein binding assays using radiolabeled GTP, antisera to animal G proteins, or toxin-mediated ADP-ribosylation of G proteins using radioactive NAD (19Terryn N. Van Montagu M. Inze D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 22: 143-152Google Scholar). Genes encoding α-subunit homologs have also been isolated from a number of plants (20Ma H. Yanofsky M.F. Meyerowitz E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3821-3825Google Scholar, 21Ma H. Yanofsky M.F. Huang H. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 107: 189-195Google Scholar). At the physiological level, G proteins have been implicated in phytochrome-induced chloroplast development and anthocyanin biosynthesis in tomato and in the regulation of stomatal aperture in Vicia faba guard cells (22Fairley-Grenot K. Assmann S.M. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 1037-1044Google Scholar, 23Wu W.-H. Assmann S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6310-6314Google Scholar, 24Bowler C. Neuhaus G. Yamagata H. Chua N.-H. Cell. 1994; 77: 73-81Google Scholar). In guard cells, inward rectifying K+ currents were enhanced with G protein inhibitors and inhibited with G protein activators, cholera toxin, and pertussis toxin (22Fairley-Grenot K. Assmann S.M. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 1037-1044Google Scholar, 23Wu W.-H. Assmann S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6310-6314Google Scholar). To understand the regulation of calcium levels during moss bud formation, we tested the hypothesis that G proteins regulate calcium channels in the moss plasma membrane. In this study, we investigated whether the in vitro addition of stable GTP analogs activates a G protein in purified plasma membranes of the moss Physcomitrella patens. To do this, we determined if G proteins interact with DHP receptors, thereby altering the ability of DHP agonists and antagonists to bind to their recognition sites. We report evidence for G protein modification of DHP binding to calcium channel receptors in the moss plasma membrane. Our results suggest that G proteins may regulate calcium channels in moss and may do so via a membrane-delimited (cytoplasm-independent) pathway. P. patens (Hedw.) Br. Eur. was cultured and grown aseptically using a modified Knop's medium solidified with 1.5% (w/v) agar (basal medium) (25Knight C.C. Cove D.J. Boyd P.J. Ashton N.W. Glime J.M. Methods in Bryology: Proceedings of the Bryology Methods Workshop. Hattori Botanical Laboratory, Michinan, Japan1988: 47-58Google Scholar). Plants were grown at 25°C under continuous white fluorescent light (45-50 microeinsteins/m2· s1). Petri dishes containing appropriately supplemented basal medium overlaid with sterile cellophane were inoculated with spore suspensions. To prepare spore suspensions, 50 mature capsules were sterilized by soaking in 70% ethanol (5 ml) for 2 min, followed by 5.25% (w/v) sodium hypochlorite, 0.1% Triton X-100 (10 ml) for 10 min with occasional swirling. The capsules were washed four times with sterile distilled water (10 ml each) and resuspended in 10 ml of sterile distilled water. Capsules were opened with sterile forceps, and plates were inoculated with 1 ml of spore suspension each (∼4 × 103 viable spores). After incubation at room temperature for 2 weeks, protonemal tissue was harvested and ground in sterile water (1 g/6 ml) with a tissue homogenizer (Tissue Tearor, Biospec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK) for 2 min at 11,000 rpm. Ground tissue (0.25 g/1.5 ml) was transferred to sterile flasks containing 50 ml of Gottwald's medium (26Gottwald R. Buetelmann P. Hartmann E. Glime J.M. Methods in Bryology: Proceedings of the Bryology Methods Workshop. Hattori Botanical Laboratory, Michinan, Japan1988: 73-76Google Scholar). Flasks were incubated at room temperature under fluorescent lights (as described above) on a rotary shaker for 3 weeks at 100 rpm. The tissue was then subcultured by transferring 9-ml aliquots into flasks containing 50 ml of Gottwald's medium. Cultures were incubated for an additional 2 weeks, and the tissue was harvested, weighed (yield of ∼1 g of tissue/flask), and used for membrane isolation. All procedures were conducted at 4°C. Moss vegetative tissue (35-60 g) was homogenized by mortar and pestle in a medium containing 250 m sorbitol, 3 m EGTA, 25 m Hepes/bis-tris propane (pH 7.4), 1 m dithiothreitol, 0.1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 m iodoacetamide, 0.01 m pepstatin A, 0.2% bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free), and 0.25 g/g of fresh weight polyvinylpolypyrrolidone at a medium/tissue ratio of 1.5 ml/g, fresh weight. After filtration through cheesecloth, the tissue was homogenized again in 1 ml of the homogenization medium/g of the original tissue weight, washed in 0.5 ml of the same medium/g, and filtered. The filtered homogenate was centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 × g, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 60,000 × g (Beckman SW 28 rotor, rmax). The resulting pellet (crude microsomal fraction) was resuspended in 250 m sorbitol, 2.5 m Hepes/bis-tris propane (pH 7.2), and 1 m dithiothreitol (resuspension buffer). The suspension (1.1 ml) was layered over a two-step (6 and 12%, w/w) dextran gradient (5 ml each) prepared in resuspension buffer. After centrifugation for 2 h at 70,000 × g (Beckman SW 28.1 rotor, rmax), a turbid band at the 6-12% dextran interface was collected and is referred to as plasma membrane-enriched vesicles. Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. A filtration assay was used to measure G protein regulation of DHP binding. Membranes were incubated at 20°C in a solution containing 20 m Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5), 0.1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 m KCl, 1 m CaCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 10 n [3H]azidopine at a final protein concentration of 0.066 mg/ml. Incubations were stopped by rapid filtration of reaction aliquots (usually 450 µl) under reduced pressure through glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/C). The filters were immediately washed twice with 5 ml of an ice-cold solution containing 100 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Duplicate experiments were systematically carried out using at least three different membrane preparations. Ten-µl samples of the incubation mixture were taken for measurement of the total amount of [3H]azidopine present, and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. All experiments were carried out under dim light due to the light sensitivity of the DHPs. Solvent controls were included in all assays where necessary. The glass fiber filters used for filtration were presoaked for at least 1 h in 0.3% polyethyleneimine. Under these conditions, [3H]azidopine bound to filters in the absence of membranes and could be displaced by nonradioactive ligand. Control experiments were performed without vesicles for each experiment, and the binding data were corrected for nonspecific filter interactions. Nonspecific binding, measured by preincubation of membranes with a 100 µ concentration of the DHP antagonist nifedipine or with a 1 µ concentration of the DHP agonist Bay K8644 (methyl-1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-3-nitro-4-(2-trifluoromethylphenyl)pyridine 5-carboxylate) on ice for 60 min, was <10% of total binding at a 10 n concentration of ligand. Nonspecific binding was subtracted from total binding to yield specific binding. Variations of binding conditions for individual experiments are indicated in the appropriate figure and table legends. For determination of the effect of guanine nucleotide analogs on the association of DHP with its receptor, nucleotides were incubated with plasma membranes for 5 min at room temperature prior to the addition of [3H]azidopine. For determination of the effect of guanine nucleotide analogs on the disassociation of DHP from its receptor, 10 n [3H]azidopine was first incubated with plasma membranes for 60 min on ice. Dissociation was initiated by adding excess unlabeled ligand (100 µ nifedipine or 1 µ Bay K8644) and filtering aliquots at the appropriate time. For determination of association rate constants (k1), the amount of labeled ligand-receptor complex was determined in aliquots taken at various times between initiation of the reaction and the time to equilibrium. The data were analyzed using linear regression of the first-order log plots of ln(100 − (Bt/Be)) versus time, where Bt is the amount of specifically bound [3H]azidopine at assay time t and Be is the equilibrium-specific binding of [3H]azidopine (28Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Google Scholar). Dissociation rate constants (k−1) were determined by measuring the amount of labeled ligand-receptor complex remaining at various times after the addition of excess unlabeled ligand, and the data were analyzed using linear regression of first-order plots of ln(Bt/Be) (28Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Google Scholar). [3H]Azidopine (70-90 Ci/mmol) was purchased from DuPont NEN. Unlabeled nifedipine and (±)-Bay K8644 were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. Guanine nucleotide analogs were purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were of the highest quality available from commercial sources. G proteins have been implicated in the direct regulation of calcium channels in animal cells (13Brown A.M. Birnbaumer L. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: H401-H410Google Scholar). Under these conditions, where regulation is independent of changes in intracellular second messengers, the binding of GTP may alter the interaction of ligands with their receptors (18Dunn S.M.J. Bladen C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5716-5721Google Scholar, 29Rodbell M. Nature. 1980; 284: 17-22Google Scholar). To determine the role of G proteins in the regulation of the calcium channel in moss, we have investigated the effects of guanine nucleotide analogs on the properties of DHP binding to moss plasma membranes. In the studies presented here, the binding of unlabeled DHPs to receptors in moss plasma membranes was measured by their ability to compete with the binding of the labeled DHP antagonist [3H]azidopine. The amount of [3H]azidopine specifically bound when 10 n was incubated with 0.066 mg/ml membrane protein was increased by the presence of 1 µ GTPγS, a pseudo-irreversible activator of G proteins. Stimulation of specific binding was seen when competition was carried out with the DHP antagonist nifedipine (Fig. 1A) or the DHP agonist Bay K8644 (Fig. 1C). The association reaction of [3H]azidopine with moss DHP receptors reached a steady state within 30 min when either nifedipine or Bay K8644 was used. Kinetic data for association, plotted semilogarithmically (Fig. 1, B and D), showed the linear relationships that would be expected for pseudo first-order reactions. Using the first-order rate equation, this representation gives a k1 of 1.1 × 10−3−1 s−1 for nifedipine (n = 4) and 8.4 × 10−4−1 s−1 (n = 3) for Bay K8644. The addition of GTPγS increased the rate constants by an average of 61% for nifedipine-sensitive binding (k1 = 1.8 × 10−3−1 s−1) and 76% for Bay K8644-sensitive binding (k1 = 1.1 × 10−3−1 s−1). To determine the concentrations of GTPγS required to stimulate DHP-sensitive binding, we measured the effect of varying the GTPγS concentration on the rates of association. Concentrations of GTPγS as low as 0.1 µ in the incubation medium stimulated DHP-sensitive binding (Fig. 2, A and C), and the effects were saturated by 1 µ. Two- and three-fold G protein stimulations of binding were seen, and half-maximal stimulation occurred at 4.1 and 3.9 µ GTPγS for nifedipine (Fig. 2B) and Bay K8644 (Fig. 2D), respectively. GDPβS, a competitive inhibitor of G proteins, had no effect on either nifedipine- or Bay K8644-sensitive binding (Fig. 2, A and C). As described previously, nifedipine increases the rate of dissociation of [3H]azidopine in moss membranes (12Schumaker K.S. Gizinski M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23461-23467Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A); similar results were observed for Bay K8644 (Fig. 3C). The effects of GTPγS and GDPβS on the ability of the DHPs to accelerate [3H]azidopine dissociation were measured (Fig. 3, A and C). Time courses of dissociation followed first-order kinetics, producing rate constants of dissociation of 1.6 × 10−3 s−1 (nifedipine; n = 2) and 1.2 × 10−3 s−1 (Bay K8644; n = 3) (Fig. 3, A and C). GTPγS enhances the displacement produced by both DHPs (Fig. 3, A and C); the addition of the stable GTP analog increased the dissociation rate constants by 76% for nifedipine-sensitive binding (k−1 = 2.1 × 10−3 s−1) and by 60% for Bay K8644-sensitive binding (k−1 = 2.0 × 10−3 s−1). GDPβS had no effect on the ability of either DHP to affect the dissociation kinetics at any of the concentrations tested (Fig. 3, A and C). To determine the concentrations of GTPγS required to stimulate DHP-sensitive displacement of binding, we measured the effect of varying the GTPγS concentration on the rates of dissociation. As with the effects of GTPγS on the association of [3H]azidopine with the moss DHP receptor, concentrations as low as 0.1 µ in the incubation medium stimulated DHP-sensitive displacement (Fig. 4, A and C), and the effects were saturated by 1 µ. For both nifedipine and Bay K8644, a 2.5-fold maximal G protein-stimulated displacement of binding was seen, and half-maximal displacement occurred at 4.3 µ GTPγS (Fig. 4, B and D). GDPβS at the same concentrations had no effect on either nifedipine- or Bay K8644-sensitive displacement (Fig. 4, A and C). To investigate whether the apparent binding of DHPs is sensitive specifically to G protein regulation, we studied the effects of several other nucleotides (GTP, GDP, ATP, and GMP-PNP) on the ability of nifedipine and Bay K8644 to accelerate the association and dissociation of [3H]azidopine. As with GDPβS, the addition of the nucleotides GDP, cAMP, and ATP did not modify DHP binding (TABLE I, TABLE II). However, the active G protein modulators GTP and GMP-PNP did increase the association and dissociation rates in a manner similar to the effects seen with GTPγS (TABLE I, TABLE II).TABLE ISpecificity of nucleotide effects on the DHP-sensitive formation of the [3H]azidopine-moss plasma membrane DHP receptor complexNucleotide[3H]Azidopine boundNifedipineBay K8644%None (control)100100GTPγS187 ± 6174 ± 18GTP192 ± 4199 ± 13GMP-PNP186 ± 9206 ± 6GDPβS95 ± 799 ± 14ATP84 ± 12107 ± 14cAMP90 ± 21103 ± 26 Open table in a new tab TABLE IISpecificity of nucleotide effects on the DHP-sensitive dissociation of the [3H]azidopine-moss plasma membrane DHP receptor complexNucleotide[3H]Azidopine boundNifedipineBay K8644%None (control)100100GTPγS203 ± 6189 ± 18GTP221 ± 4194 ± 13GMP-PNP187 ± 9196 ± 6GDPβS101 ± 786 ± 14ATP94 ± 1293 ± 14cAMP97 ± 2195 ± 26 Open table in a new tab We have previously shown that plasma membranes from the moss P. patens contain a single class of binding sites for the calcium channel blocker [3H]azidopine (12Schumaker K.S. Gizinski M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23461-23467Google Scholar). In the absence of multiple classes of binding sites, other mechanisms must exist to provide a level of channel control during development. The ability of the stable GTP analog GTPγS to stimulate the interaction of DHPs with their receptors in moss plasma membranes suggests that coupling of a G protein to these high affinity DHP-binding sites may provide a mechanism of channel regulation. The specificity of G protein action is supported by stimulation of DHP binding by elevated concentrations of GTP and the active nucleotides GTPγS and GMP-PNP as well as the lack of effect of the inactive nucleotides GDPβS, ATP, and cAMP. While the mechanism of G protein action is unknown, binding of the G protein may modify the conformation of the DHP-binding sites, enhancing the possibility of interaction with calcium channel antagonist and agonist ligands. Low levels of Triton X-100 were required to see the effects of GTP and its analogs on DHP binding. Membranes used in this study were isolated using dextran gradients that enrich for sealed vesicles (30Sze H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1985; 36: 175-208Google Scholar). While Triton X-100 at the concentration used had no effect on DHP binding, it prevented 45Ca2+ uptake into moss protoplasts (data not shown), suggesting that membranes have been permeabilized. If, as expected, the membranes used represent a mixture of right-side-out and inside-out vesicles, the fact that no binding was observed in the absence of Triton X-100 suggests that GTP and the DHPs may bind to opposite faces of the plasma membrane. While voltage-dependent calcium channels have been found in the plasma membrane of cells in carrot (31Thuleau P. Ward J.M. Ranjeva R. Schroeder J.I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2970-2975Google Scholar, 32Thuleau P. Moreau M. Schroeder J.I. Ranjeva R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5843-5847Google Scholar), wheat (33Huang J.W. Grunes D.L. Kochian L.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3473-3477Google Scholar, 34Piñeros M. Tester M. Planta (Heidelb.). 1995; 195: 478-488Google Scholar), and maize (35Marshall J. Corzo A. Leigh R.A. Sanders D. Plant J. 1994; 5: 683-694Google Scholar), no evidence currently exists for G protein modulation of these channels. G proteins have been shown to regulate inward rectifying K+ channels in the plasma membrane of V. faba guard cells. Using isolated membrane patches, G protein regulators were shown to affect the open state probability of single inward K+ channels and provided evidence for a membrane-delimited pathway of G protein regulation (23Wu W.-H. Assmann S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6310-6314Google Scholar). Experiments presented here were done using isolated plasma membranes and suggest that G protein regulation of DHP binding in moss may also take place via a membrane-associated or cytoplasm-independent pathway. G protein regulation of DHP binding in moss indicates that the mechanism of binding differs from binding in animal cells in several ways. (i) While binding studies in animal cells suggest that DHP-binding sites may exist in distinct conformations with different affinity for antagonists and agonists (17Bergamaschi S. Govoni S. Cominetti P. Parenti M. Trabucchi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 1279-1286Google Scholar, 18Dunn S.M.J. Bladen C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5716-5721Google Scholar), the present study suggests that differences in affinity do not exist in plant cells. GTP and stable analogs showed similar effects on the DHP antagonist nifedipine and the agonist Bay K8644 (cf. Figs. 1 (A and C) and 3 (A and C)). (ii) In microsomal membrane preparations from rabbit skeletal muscle (18Dunn S.M.J. Bladen C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5716-5721Google Scholar) and synaptic membrane preparations from rats (17Bergamaschi S. Govoni S. Cominetti P. Parenti M. Trabucchi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 1279-1286Google Scholar), G proteins were shown to accelerate DHP-induced dissociation at low affinity DHP-binding sites. In these membranes, DHPs at greater than micromolar concentrations increase the rate of dissociation of radiolabeled DHP, which may be a consequence of a protein conformational change induced by DHP occupancy of low affinity sites (18Dunn S.M.J. Bladen C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5716-5721Google Scholar). In our studies, we have detected only high affinity DHP sites in the plasma membranes of P. patens (12Schumaker K.S. Gizinski M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23461-23467Google Scholar), and in the present study, we present evidence for G protein regulation of this high affinity DHP binding. Whole cell studies of the effect of DHPs on bud formation in moss suggested that hormone-induced bud formation is modulated by calcium entry into cells (8Conrad P.A. Hepler P.K. Plant Physiol. 1988; 86: 684-687Google Scholar). Subsequent studies characterizing calcium influx into moss protoplasts and DHP binding to moss plasma membranes implicated DHP-sensitive calcium channels in this process (11Schumaker K.S.

The data presented in this study support the hypothesis that G proteins regulate DHP binding to high affinity sites that are likely associated with voltage-dependent channels and suggest cytoplasm-independent regulation. Electrophysiological studies will allow us to link G proteins and the transport activity of the moss calcium channels directly. In addition, these studies will allow investigation into the requirement for cytoplasmic factors in G protein regulation and will allow us to determine if differential regulation of the channel is a determinant of bud formation during moss development.

In accordance with other serpins, PAI-1 is thought to undergo a conformational change upon reactive center cleavage. In this study we have developed methods to produce and purify reactive center cleaved wild-type PAI-1 and characterized this molecular form of PAI-1 by biochemical and biophysical methods. Incubation with Sepharose-bound trypsin caused cleavage only at the P1-P1′ bond in the reactive center and resulted in 39- and 4-kDa polypeptides, strongly held together by noncovalent interactions. Circular dichroism measurements suggest that the reactive center cleavage triggers larger conformational changes than the conversion from the active to the latent form. Cleaved PAI-1 did not bind to either PAs or vitronectin but retained the heparin-binding capacity. To study the structure of cleaved PAI-1 by polarized fluorescence spectroscopy and to measure intramolecular distances, we used cysteine substitution mutants to which extrinsic fluorescence probes were attached. These studies revealed increasing orientational freedom of probes in the P3 and P1′ positions upon cleavage. Distance measurements based on fluorescence energy transfer between probes in positions P3 and P1′ indicate that these residues are separated by at least 68 ± 10 Å in cleaved PAI-1.

Erickson L.A. Lawrence D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2956-2960Google Scholar). Like many other protease inhibitors in blood, PAI-1 belongs to the serine protease inhibitor superfamily (serpins) (2Ny T. Sawdey M. Lawrence D. Milan J.L. Loskutoff D.J. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6776-6780Google Scholar, 3Carrell R.W. Boswell D.R. Barrett A.J. Salvesen J. Proteinase Inhibitors. Elsevier, Amsterdam1986: 403Google Scholar). Although PAI-1 is produced as an active molecule, it has a metastable conformation and can exist in three interconvertible forms (active, latent, and substrate-like) (4Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11581-11587Google Scholar, 5Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Vaughan D.E. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11693-11696Google Scholar, 6Urano T. Strandberg L. Johansson L.B.-Å. Ny T.

Active PAI-1 inhibits the target proteases tissue-type PA (tPA; EC 3.4.21) and urokinase-type PA (uPA; EC) by formation of 1:1 stoichiometric complexes (3Carrell R.W. Boswell D.R. Barrett A.J. Salvesen J. Proteinase Inhibitors. Elsevier, Amsterdam1986: 403Google Scholar). Latent PAI-1 has no inhibitory activity, but denaturation followed by renaturation restores inhibitory activity, which slowly declines over time as PAI-1 reverts to the latent form. PAI-1 can also exist in a nonfunctional substrate-like conformation, which is cleaved by the target protease as a substrate. In blood as well as in the extracellular matrix, active PAI-1 is found associated with vitronectin, which stabilizes PAI-1 in its active conformation (8Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Alessi M.-C. Baudner S.

FEBS Lett. 1988; 242: 125-128Google Scholar). The glycosaminoglycan heparin also binds to PAI-1, and this interaction results in an enhanced association rate with the nontarget protease thrombin (10Ehrlich H.J. Keijer J. Preissner K.T. Klein Gebbink R. Pannekoek H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1021-1028Google Scholar). Like other serpins, PAI-1 is thought to act by presenting its reactive center as an ideal substrate to the target protease (3Carrell R.W. Boswell D.R. Barrett A.J. Salvesen J. Proteinase Inhibitors. Elsevier, Amsterdam1986: 403Google Scholar). However, after the initial interaction the enzyme fails to complete the cleavage reaction, and the two molecules become irreversibly locked in a stable complex. Existing hypotheses (11Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Google Scholar, 12Shieh B.-H. Potempa J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13420-13423Google Scholar, 13Lawrence D.A. Strandberg L. Ericson J. Ny T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20293-20301Google Scholar) assume that active inhibitory serpins contain an exposed reactive center loop above the core of the protein, but the inhibitory conformation of this loop is not known. To acquire a conformation necessary for effective inhibition, the reactive center loop also appears to be partly inserted between strands 3 and 5 of the β-sheet A (14Carrell R.W. Evans D.L.I. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 438-446Google Scholar, 15Carrell R.W. Evans D.L. Stein P.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 576-578Google Scholar, 16Björk I. Nordling K. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6501-6505Google Scholar). Loop insertion may not be required for protease recognition, but it seems to be required for inhibition (17Lawrence D.A. Olson S.T. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27657-27662Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, natural or artificially introduced substitutions in the P6-P14 region 2Throughout we refer to amino acids on the NH2-terminal side of the scissile bond in the PAI-1 molecule as P1, P2, P3, etc. and the amino acids on the carboxyl side as P1′, P2′, P3′, etc. that may affect loop insertion lead to decreased inhibitory activity and increased substrate properties in various serpins (14Carrell R.W. Evans D.L.I. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 438-446Google Scholar, 17Lawrence D.A. Olson S.T. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27657-27662Google Scholar, 18Audenaert A.-M. Knockaert I. Collen D. Declerck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19559-19564Google Scholar). Following docking with protease, the reactive center loop is presumed to further insert into β-sheet A, thereby achieving tight binding and inhibition (19Gettins P. Patston P.A. Schapira M. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 461-467Google Scholar, 20Skriver K. Wikoff W.R. Patston P.A. Tausk F. Schapira M. Kaplan A.P. Bock S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9216-9221Google Scholar). Although the molecular basis for the arrest of peptide bond hydrolysis is not fully understood (21Bode W. Huber R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 45-52Google Scholar), recent data suggest that the reactive center loop is cleaved in the native protease inhibitor complex (22Wilczynska M. Fa Ohlsson P.-I. Ny T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29652-29655Google Scholar, 23Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. Day D.E. Beskenpas M.B. Verhamme I.M. Kvassman J.-O. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25309-25312Google Scholar, 24Fa M.

Cleavage of the reactive center loop by protease and the subsequent loop insertion may therefore induce the conformational changes required to lock the inhibitor-protease complex (22Wilczynska M.

Weiss V. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16626-16630Google Scholar, 26Gettins P. Harten B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3634-3639Google Scholar, 27Carrell R.W. Oven M.C.

Declerck P.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 891-897Google Scholar). A similar loop insertion takes place when PAI-1 converts to the latent conformation (30Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Google Scholar); the reactive center becomes inaccessible to the protease, and the PAI-1 molecule obtains an energetically more stable structure (31Sancho E. Declerck P.J. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Booth N.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1064-1069Google Scholar, 32Strandberg L. Karolin J. Johansson L.B.-Å. Fa M. Aleshkov S. Ny T. Thromb. Res. 1994; 76: 253-267Google Scholar). Selective proteolysis of serpins may not only lead to the loss of inhibitory activity (27Carrell R.W. Oven M.C. Nature. 1985; 317: 730-732Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 33Potempa J. Fedak D. Dubin A. Mast A. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21482-21487Google Scholar); new antigenic determinants may emerge after cleavage, and cleaved serpins can obtain new biological functions, undetectable in the parent inhibitor molecule (33Potempa J. Fedak D. Dubin A. Mast A. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21482-21487Google Scholar, 34Banda M.J. Rice A.G. Griffin G.L. Senior R.M. J. Biol.

Thus, it is clear that cleaved serpins represent a new type of molecule with a unique structure and function. Although the cleaved form of a noninhibitory substrate mutant of PAI-1 has been characterized (18Audenaert A.-M. Knockaert I. Collen D. Declerck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19559-19564Google Scholar), problems in producing large amounts of detergent-free, natural PAI-1 have hampered studies of the cleaved wild type form of PAI-1. In this study we have purified reactive center cleaved wild type PAI-1 and evaluated its biochemical and biophysical properties. The cleaved PAI-1 molecule was found to have lost its ability to bind to PAs and vitronectin, while the capacity to bind to heparin was preserved. To estimate the distance between the P3 and P1′ residues in cleaved PAI-1 in solution we have used a novel method based on donor-donor fluorescence energy transfer and time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy experiments. Restriction enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, bacteriophage T4 DNA ligase, and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase 1 were purchased from Boehringer (Mannheim GmbH, FRG), in vitro mutagenesis kit was from Amersham (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom), and oligonucleotides were made on a 332 DNA/RNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, Cheshire, UK) Sephacryl S-200 and heparin-Sepharose were from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden). Isopropyl-β—thiogalactopyranoside, o-phenylendiamine, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody, −1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (EC), and dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) were from Sigma. Single-chain tPA (sctPA), two-chain tPA (tctPA), PAI-1-depleted plasma, monoclonal antibody toward PAI-1 (MAI-11), the chromogenic substrate Flavigen tPA, and the PAI-1 ELISA assays, Imulyse PAI-1 and TintElize PAI-1, were purchased from Biopool AB (Umeå, Sweden). Ukidan urokinase (uPA) was from Serono SA (Aubonne, Switzerland). Chromogenic substrates S-2444 and S-2288 were purchased from Chromogenix (Mölndal, Sweden), and anhydrotrypsin was from Pierce. The fluorescent labeling reagent N-(4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-S-indacene-3-propionyl)-N′-(iodoacethylene-diamine) (BDYIA) and Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Purified vitronectin was a generous gift from Dr. B. Dahlbäck (University of Lund, Sweden). Enzyme reactions were carried out using the conditions suggested by the suppliers. Transformation of Escherichia coli and all DNA manipulations were completed as described (36Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was performed by the method of Sanger et al. (37Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) modified for double-stranded DNA as described (38Chen E.Y. Seeburg P.H. DNA. 1985; 4: 165-170Google Scholar). For constructions and DNA purifications, plasmids were propagated in E. coli strain DH5α. For production of wild type and mutant forms of PAI-1 protein the Lon− E. coli strain SG20043 was used (39Trisler P. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 184-191Google Scholar). The design and construction of P1′ and P3 cysteine mutants have been described before (24Fa M. Karolin J. Aleshkov S. Strandberg L. Johansson L.B.-Å. Ny T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13833-13840Google Scholar, 32Strandberg L. Karolin J. Johansson L.B.-Å. Fa M. Aleshkov S. Ny T. Thromb. Res. 1994; 76: 253-267Google Scholar). Briefly, serine at position 344 (P3) and methionine at position 347 (P1′) were substituted with cysteines by site-directed mutagenesis. In addition, a double mutant with cysteine residues at both P1′ and P3 was prepared using the same methodology. Mutated PAI-1 DNA was cloned into the prokaryotic expressional vector pDLO6 as described earlier (40Lawrence D. Strandberg L. Grundström T. Ny T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 523-533Google Scholar). The purification of nonglycosylated prokaryotic PAI-1 from E. coli to homogeneity was performed as described (40Lawrence D. Strandberg L. Grundström T. Ny T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 523-533Google Scholar). To remove traces of latent PAI-1 before cleavage with trypsin, the purified PAI-1 preparations were loaded on a commercial anhydrotrypsin column (Pierce) and equilibrated with 0.15 sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1 NaCl, 0.01% Tween 80 (buffer A). The column was washed with the same buffer, and PAI-1 was eluted with 0.5 Arg-HCl, pH 7.4, in buffer A. PAI-1 from the anhydrotrypsin column usually showed 95-100% activity toward uPA and will be referred to as an active PAI-1. To convert active PAI-1 to the latent form, the buffer was changed to 0.02 sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.1 NaCl, 0.01% Tween 80, using a PD10 column (Pharmacia). The protein concentration was then adjusted to 0.1 mg/ml, and the mixture was incubated for 48 h at 37°C. To remove residual active PAI-1, the samples were passed through the anhydrotrypsin column again, and the absence of activity was confirmed by the chromogenic activity assay. Samples of active and latent PAI-1 were analyzed using standard ELISA and Western blotting protocols. 5 mg of TPCK-treated (chymotrypsin-free) trypsin (Sigma) was coupled per 1 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose gel, according to protocols from the manufacturer (Pharmacia), and the gel was stored at 4°C until use. For time course experiments, aliquots of gel (0.5 ml) were placed in 2-ml minicolumns, and 100 µl of PAI-1 (0.4 mg/ml) was applied. PAI-1 was then incubated on the column at room temperature for the indicated times before elution with five portions of 125 µl of buffer A containing 0.5 Arg-HCl, pH 7.4. Before each large scale preparation of cleaved PAI-1, the optimal time of digestion was predetermined by small scale experiments using the same batch of trypsin-Sepharose. For large scale preparation of cleaved PAI-1, active PAI-1 (0.1-0.4 mg/ml) in buffer A containing 0.5 Arg-HCl, pH 7.4, was applied on a trypsin-Sepharose column and incubated at room temperature for 1-2 min before elution with the same buffer. The cleavage products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and NH2-terminal sequence analysis, and overdigested samples were discarded. If traces of active PAI-1 remained in the eluted material it was transferred into buffer A using a PD10 column and passed over an anhydrotrypsin column again. The flow-through, containing the cleaved PAI-1, was then concentrated using Centricon-10 cartridges (Amicon) before purity and cleavage were monitored by SDS-PAGE and NH2-terminal sequence analysis. Samples containing 200 µg of cleaved PAI-1 were separated on a Sephacryl S-200 column (1 × 38 cm) at a flow rate of 10 ml/h in a buffer containing 0.15 NaCl, 0.05 sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.01% Tween 80, and 0.1 µ dithiothreitol. The PAI-1 content in the fractions (0.5 ml) was determined by ELISA assay (Imulyse). PAI-1 samples, in 0.05 sodium phosphate, pH 5.6, 0.15 NaCl, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, and 0.01% Tween 80, were loaded on a 1-ml Hitrap™ heparin-Sepharose column (Pharmacia) at a flow rate 14 ml/h and eluted with a NaCl gradient (0.15-1). The fractions were analyzed for PAI-1 antigen by ELISA as described above. Labeling of PAI-1 single Cys mutants was performed as described earlier (24Fa M. Karolin J. Aleshkov S. Strandberg L. Johansson L.B.-Å. Ny T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13833-13840Google Scholar) except that PAI-1 was cleaved before labeling. For labeling of the cleaved double mutant (P1′cys-P3cys), reactions were performed in a buffer containing 20 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 50 m NaCl, 1 m Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, and 20-50 µ of PAI-1. BDYIA dissolved in Me2SO was added to a final concentration of 2 m (final concentration of Me2SO was 15%). The mixture was incubated in darkness for 2 h at room temperature on a rotating platform, after which excess BDYIA was removed by gel filtration using a Sephadex G-25 column (1 × 38 cm) at a flow rate of 20 ml/h. The incorporation efficiency was calculated from the absorbances of BDYIA (λmax = 505 nm) and PAI-1 (λmax = 280 nm) by using the molar absorptivities of ϵBDYIA = 80,000 −1 cm−1 and ϵPAI-1 = 43,000 −1 cm−1. Usually, the efficiency of labeling was 95-100% for the cleaved double mutant and 50-85% for single cysteine mutants. The specific inhibitory activity of intact or cleaved PAI-1 toward different PAs was determined by the chromogenic assay as described previously (40Lawrence D. Strandberg L. Grundström T. Ny T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 523-533Google Scholar). Specific activities of single- and two-chain forms of tPA were 750 IU of tPA/µg, and the specific activity of uPA was 140 IU of uPA/µg. Microtiter plates were coated with 0.5 µg/ml of uPA, sctPA, or tctPA or with 1 µg/ml vitronectin as described (13Lawrence D.A. Strandberg L. Ericson J. Ny T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20293-20301Google Scholar). The plates were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.01% Tween 80 (PBST) and then blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 60 min at 23°C, followed by three washes with PBST. As background controls, wells without vitronectin or PAs, but treated in the same way, were used. Samples containing increasing concentrations (0-400 µg/ml) of active or cleaved PAI-1 were added to the microtiter plates and incubated for 30 min at 23°C. The plates were washed three times with PBST before 150 µl/well of 1000-fold diluted rabbit antiserum against PAI-1 was added. The plates were then incubated for 60 min at room temperature, washed as above, and developed as standard ELISA plates using goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). After background adjustments, the amount of bound PAI-1 was determined for each well using standard curves of either active or cleaved PAI-1, which were incubated in wells coated with MAI-11 α-PAI-1 monoclonal antibody (Biopool). The steady-state fluorescence spectra and anisotropies were obtained by using a SPEX Fluorolog 112 instrument (SPEX Industries), equipped with Glan-Thompson polarizers. The temperature of samples was kept at 4°C. The spectral bandwidths were 5.6 and 2.7 nm for the excitation and emission monochromators, respectively. A PRA 3000 system (Photophysical Research Associates Inc., Ontario, Canada) was used for time-correlated single-photon-counting measurements of the fluorescence decay. The excitation source is a thyratron-gated flash lamp (model 510C, Photophysical Research Associates) filled with deuterium gas and operated at about 30 kHz. The excitation wavelengths were selected by interference filters (Omega/Saven AB, Sweden) centered at 470 nm (half bandwidth = 9.3 nm). The fluorescence emission was observed above 520 nm through a long pass filter (Schott, Germany). The maximum absorbance (at about 505 nm) was kept below 0.08, corresponding to a BDYIA concentration of about 1 µ. The fluorescence decay curves were measured by repeated collection of photons during 200 s for each setting of polarizers. The curves were deconvoluted on a silicon graphic workstation, IRIS, IMO0160, by using a nonlinear least squares analysis based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Further details are given in Ref. 41Karolin J. Johansson L.B.-Å. Strandberg L. Ny T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 7801-7806Google Scholar and references therein. The time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy for experiments with PAI-1 was performed in buffer containing 150 m NaCl, 50 m sodium phosphate (pH 5.6), and 0.01% Tween 80 and was analyzed according to the model described by Fa et al. (24Fa M. Karolin J. Aleshkov S. Strandberg L. Johansson L.B.-Å. Ny T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13833-13840Google Scholar) and references therein. For protein molecules whose rotational diffusion is immobilized on the fluorescence time scale, the fluorescence anisotropy is described by the following equation.r(t)=r0(ρ0e−t/Φ+ρ∞)(Eq. 1) In Equation 1 the Φ is an effective rotational correlation time of the fluorescent probe. The constant value of r0ρ∞ corresponds to the residual fluorescence anisotropy, reached after sufficiently long times t ≥ t∞. The residual value of ρ∞ can take values between 0 and 1, depending on the orientational restriction in the binding site. A cone model (42Kinosita Jr., K. Kawato S. Ikegami A. Biophys. J. 1977; 20: 289Google Scholar) is sometimes used as a simplifying orientational potential in anisotropic systems like membranes and proteins. It then assumed that the probability of orientation of the transition dipole moment is the same for any angle less than the cone angle βc. The cone angles reported in this work were calculated from the following equation.ρ∞={1/2cosβc(1+cosβc)}2(Eq. 2) The angle βc must, of course, not be taken literally. It merely serves as a rough estimate of the probe's orientational restriction at the binding site. The CD spectra were recorded on a JASCO J-720 spectropolarimeter. The bandwidth was 1.0 nm, and the step resolution was 0.2 nm. Quartz cuvettes with an optical path length of 0.2 cm were thermostatted at 23 ± 1°C. The buffer was 50 m sodium phosphate (pH 5.6), and the protein concentrations were typically 60 µg/ml. Active PAI-1 was purified by anhydrotrypsin chromatography to ensure that only molecules exposing the reactive center remained. Samples of latent and cleaved PAI-1 were prepared as described above and additionally passed through the anhydrotrypsin column to remove remaining active PAI-1. The purity of samples from different steps was monitored by SDS-PAGE (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or by immunoblot analysis (40Lawrence D. Strandberg L. Grundström T. Ny T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 523-533Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). For NH2-terminal sequence analysis, purified cleaved PAI-1 were immobilized on Immobilon membranes (44Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Google Scholar) and analyzed on a 477 A Pulsed Liquid Phase Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Analysis of the amino acid composition was performed by standard techniques after sample hydrolysis in 6 HCl, pH 7.4, for 24 h at 110°C in vacuo. Following interaction with target protease the reactive center of inhibitory serpins is cleaved, which results in the incorporation of the strained loop into the middle of β-sheet A, whereby the reactive center P1 and P1′ residues become separated by approximately 70 Å. (14Carrell R.W. Evans D.L.I. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 438-446Google Scholar, 45Mourey L. Samama J.P. Delarue M. Choay J. Lormeau J.C. Petitiou M. Moras D.

Lesjak M. Laurell C.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 595-606Google Scholar). For the preparation of cleaved wild type PAI-1 it is important to ensure that no latent PAI-1, which is resistant to protease digestion, contaminates the preparations and that a specific and efficient cleavage of the P1-P1′ bond can be achieved. As starting material for the preparation of reactive center cleaved PAI-1, we used active PAI-1 purified to homogeneity from E. coli (40Lawrence D. Strandberg L. Grundström T. Ny T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 523-533Google Scholar). Before cleavage, the PAI-1 preparation was passed over an anhydrotrypsin column, since this procedure efficiently removes traces of latent PAI-1. Active PAI-1 eluted from the anhydrotrypsin column was incubated with a 2-fold molar excess of trypsin, and the kinetics of cleavage was studied by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. As shown in Fig. 1, lanes 1-4, the intensity of the 43-kDa fragment representing intact inhibitor (lane 1) decreases over time, and reaction products with apparent molecular masses of 45 and 39 kDa, respectively, are formed. The 45-kDa doublet most likely represents a complex between PAI-1 and trypsin, and the 39-kDa band a proteolytic modified form of PAI-1. Except for a minor conversion of the 45-kDa complex to the proteolytically cleaved 39-kDa form, observed after 30 min of incubation, the reaction products seem to be stable to further digestion. To optimize conditions for the isolation of cleaved PAI-1 on a large scale, active PAI-1 was incubated with trypsin-Sepharose for different times at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 2, 43-kDa intact PAI-1 (lane 1) is converted to the 39-kDa cleaved form of PAI-1 in a time-dependent manner (lanes 2-5). This indicates that Sepharose-bound trypsin, like trypsin in solution, cleaves PAI-1 to form a 39-kDa cleavage product, which is stable to further digestion. The total yield of cleaved PAI-1 that could be eluted from the column was only about 50%. Likewise, the cleavage activity of trypsin-Sepharose was reduced during the cleavage reaction. This is consistent with the results seen in Fig. 1, indicating that the PAI-1 forms a complex with trypsin and becomes immobilized to the trypsin-Sepharose beads. To identify the position of the unique trypsin-sensitive cleavage site of PAI-1, proteolytically modified PAI-1 eluted from the trypsin-Sepharose column was subjected to NH2-terminal sequence analysis. This analysis revealed the presence of two NH2-terminal sequences: Val-His-His-Pro-Pro-Ser and Met-Ala-Pro-Glu-Glu-Ile. These sequences correspond to the NH2-terminal ends of intact PAI-1 and a peptide fragment starting with the P1′ residue of PAI-1. Trypsin is a rather nonspecific serine protease that preferentially hydrolyzes peptide bonds involving the carboxyl groups of lysine and arginine (48Keil-Dlouha V. Zylber N. Tong N. Keil B. FEBS Lett. 1971; 16: 287-291Google Scholar), and the primary structure of PAI-1 contains more than 30 possible trypsin-susceptible sites. However, our studies reveal that only a single cleavage site corresponding to the reactive center P1-P1′ peptide bond is exposed to the solvent, while the regions containing other trypsin-sensitive sites are relatively buried. The above demonstrated reactive center cleavage of acti"

In order to determine whether any of the lysine residues located in the amino-terminal half of the protein play a role in the transport of anions through the channels, the first nine amino-terminal lysine residues of OprP were substituted with glutamates. The mutant proteins were purified and the channels they formed were characterized by reconstituting the purified porins in planar lipid membranes. In comparison to the wild-type protein, the Lys74, Lys121, and Lys126 mutants all displayed reduced levels of conductance at KCl concentrations below 1, and the Lys74 and Lys121 mutants no longer exhibited a saturation of conductance at high anion concentrations. In addition, the ability of phosphate ions to inhibit the conductance of Cl− ions through the channels formed by the Lys121 mutant was greatly reduced, while their ability to inhibit the Cl− conductance of the Lys74 mutant was reduced by approximately 2-fold. To clarify the roles that Lys74, Lys121, and Lys126 play in regulating the channel characteristics of OprP, these amino acids were replaced with either glycine or glutamine residues. Analysis of these mutants suggested that both Lys74 and Lys126 may serve to funnel anions toward the binding site, but only the presence of Lys121 is required for the formation of the inorganic phosphate-specific binding site of OprP."

INTRODUCTIONMany fundamental biological processes are profoundly affected by small conformational changes induced by the binding of very specific ligand “signal” molecules as well as by single amino acid mutations in the protein. These conformational changes may be evident in the thermodynamics of the ligand-protein/ligand-mutant interaction. The binding of cAMP to the cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP), 1The abbreviations used are: CRPcyclic AMP receptor proteincNMPcyclic nucleoside monophosphateCRP*CRP mutants known to activate transcription in the absence of ligandITCisothermal titration calorimetry. a dimer (Mr = 45,000) of two identical subunits with one cAMP binding site in each subunit, induces a conformational change in CRP (1Ebright R.H. Le Grice S.F.J. Miller J.P. Krakow J.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 182: 91-107Google Scholar), and this change is evident in the cooperative binding between the two binding sites of CRP and in the endothermic nature of the binding reaction (2Gorshkova I.I. Moore J.L. McKenney K.H. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21679-21683Google Scholar). This conformational change is followed by the binding of CRP to specific DNA sequences in the promoter regions of many catabolite-sensitive operons and by the interaction of CRP with RNA polymerase to initiate transcription (3De Crombrugghe B. Busby S. Buc H. Science. 1984; 224: 831-838Google Scholar, 4Garges S. Adhya S. Cell. 1985; 41: 745-751Google Scholar, 5Busby S. Ebright R.H. Cell. 1994; 79: 743-746Google Scholar). More specifically, cAMP binds to at least six amino acid residues including Thr127 in the subunit and Ser128 from the other subunit in the amino-terminal domain of CRP (6McKay D.B. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9518-9524Google Scholar, 7Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 311-326Google Scholar). In the carboxyl-terminal domain, specific amino acids within the helix-turn-helix portion of the E and F α-helices interact with the specific DNA sequences (8Ebright R.H. Kolb A. Buc H. Kunkel T.A. Krakow J.S. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6083-6087Google Scholar), and a surface exposed loop around amino acids 156-164 interacts with the α-subunit of RNA polymerase (5Busby S. Ebright R.H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 599-605Google Scholar). The binding of other cyclic nucleotides (cNMP) differ in their ability to induce conformational changes in CRP (1Ebright R.H. Le Grice S.F.J. Miller J.P. Krakow J.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 182: 91-107Google Scholar, 12Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3200-3204Google Scholar). Indeed, the binding of cGMP to CRP does not exhibit cooperative behavior between the two binding sites, is exothermic (2Gorshkova I.I. Moore J.L. McKenney K.H. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21679-21683Google Scholar), and does not initiate transcription.Single or double amino acid mutations in CRP, as well as minor substitutions in the structure of cAMP, also result in changes in the activity of CRP from the complete absence of transcriptional activity (1Ebright R.H. Le Grice S.F.J. Miller J.P. Krakow J.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 182: 91-107Google Scholar) to activation in the absence of cNMP (13Aiba H. Nakamura T. Mitani H. Mori H. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3329-3332Google Scholar, 14Blazy B. Ullmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11645-11649Google Scholar, 15Garges S. Adhya S. J.

Studies on the CRP mutants known to activate transcription in the absence of ligand (CRP*) have been helpful in understanding the conformational change induced in CRP by the ligand. Another class of CRP mutants, positive control mutants, have been particularly helpful in dissecting the transcriptional activation function of CRP. These proteins are able to bind DNA but are unable to efficiently activate transcription (19Zhou Y. Zhang X. Ebright R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6081-6085Google Scholar, 20Bell A. Gaston K. Williams R. Chapman K. Kolb A. Buc H. Minchin S. Williams J. Busby S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7243-7250Google Scholar, 21Eschenlauer A.C. Reznikoff W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5024-5029Google Scholar, 22Irwin N. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8315-8319Google Scholar). Typically, positive control mutations are on the surface exposed areas of CRP and are thought to affect protein-protein interactions between CRP and RNA polymerase. The highly specific dependence of transcriptional activation on amino acid substitution in CRP is particularly evident, as will be shown in this investigation by the conversion of the positive control mutant S128A to a CRP* upon the introduction of a second mutation, Thr127→ Leu in the cAMP binding site. Earlier, it was shown that the single Thr127→ Leu mutation in CRP results in activation of transcription by the binding of cGMP and not cAMP (23Moore, J., 1993, The Mechanism of Activation of the Escherichia coli Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein by Cyclic AMP. Ph.D. thesis, George Washington University, Washington, D. C..Google Scholar). Interestingly, the positive control nature of the mutant S128A results from a mutation at the cAMP binding site instead of in the RNA polymerase contact region.Differences in the level of activation induced by minor changes in the cNMP structure and by mutations in CRP may be exhibited in differences in the thermodynamics of the binding of cNMP to mutants of CRP because this is the initial step in the activation of the protein. This is typically exemplified by the contrast between the cooperative and endothermicity of the cAMP to CRP binding reaction, which results in the activation of transcription and the noncooperative nature and exothermicity of the cGMP to CRP binding reaction, which does not activate transcription (2Gorshkova I.I. Moore J.L. McKenney K.H. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21679-21683Google Scholar). In the present investigation, the binding constant (Kb), the binding enthalpy (ΔHb), and the binding entropy (ΔSb) are determined from isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements for cAMP, cGMP, and cIMP binding to S128A and the CRP* mutant T127L/S128A. These thermodynamic quantities are compared with the cNMP binding properties of CRP and T127L from Gorshkova et al. (2Gorshkova I.I. Moore J.L. McKenney K.H. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21679-21683Google Scholar). Because, as will be shown, there is little correlation between the cNMP binding thermodynamics and the level of activity of the ligated protein, differences in DNA binding, in vitro and in vivo, between CRP and the positive control mutant S128A were also investigated to account for the inactivity of the S128A mutant. In addition, energy minimization computations were performed on the cAMP-ligated forms of CRP, S128A, and T127L/S128A to determine any structural changes in the mutant relative to CRP that might account for the difference in activity. In particular, conformational differences between CRP and the mutants were compared in the DNA binding region, the RNA polymerase contact region, and in the hinge region consisting of residues 130-139, which connect the carboxyl-terminal and amino-terminal domains of CRP (6McKay D.B. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9518-9524Google Scholar, 7Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 311-326Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONAll the cNMP binding reactions to the T127L (2Gorshkova I.I. Moore J.L. McKenney K.H. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21679-21683Google Scholar), S128A, and T127L/S128A mutants are totally different from those of cAMP binding to CRP. They are exothermic, both enthalpically and entropically driven, and noncooperative. Although the mutants exhibit profound differences in their transcriptional activities, differences in their cNMP binding affinities or free energy changes, ΔΔGob, are small, ranging from 1.2 to −3.6 kJ mol−1 because large differences in the binding enthalpies are compensated by large differences in the binding entropies. This enthalpy-entropy compensation has been observed in many binding reactions including those involving mutated proteins (39Sturtevant J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 69-78Google Scholar) and may be a consequence of the participation of water in the binding reaction in solution (40Lumry R. Rajender S. Biopolymers. 1970; 9: 1125-1227Google Scholar). Enthalpy-entropy compensation may also be a consequence of coupling the transitions between different conformational states of the protein and the binding process (41Eftink M.R. Anusiem A.C. Biltonen R.L. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3884-3896Google Scholar). This coupling would also be accompanied by large heat capacity changes, which are indeed observed for the cNMP binding reactions, especially the cAMP binding reactions.Large changes in the binding heat capacity, ΔCp, occur for the second cAMP binding reaction to CRP (−1.47 ± 0.17 kJ mol−1K−1) and for cGMP binding to the T127L mutant (−0.76 ± 0.12 kJ mol−1K−1)(2), which are both active in the initiation of transcription (23Moore, J., 1993, The Mechanism of Activation of the Escherichia coli Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein by Cyclic AMP. Ph.D. thesis, George Washington University, Washington, D. C..Google Scholar), compared with ΔCp for the first cAMP binding step (−0.30 ± 0.08 kJ mol−1K−1) and cGMP binding to CRP (−0.47 ± 0.15 kJ mol−1K−1)(2). It was proposed that the large differences in ΔCp might reflect the structural changes necessary for activation of transcription (2Gorshkova I.I. Moore J.L. McKenney K.H. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21679-21683Google Scholar). However, a large heat capacity change of −0.87 ± 0.10 kJ mol−1K−1 is also observed for binding of cAMP to S128A, which does not activate transcription. The more negative heat capacity changes may reflect structural changes upon cNMP binding but not necessarily structural changes for activation of transcription. Apparently, there is no direct correlation between the thermodynamic cNMP binding quantities and the initiation of transcription by CRP. Consequently, changes in the activation of transcription must arise from changes in other regions of CRP. The most probable regions are the DNA binding region, the hinge region, or the RNA polymerase contact region of the cNMP-ligated mutants.S128A is a positive control mutant; it binds to the DNA binding site with approximately the same affinity as CRP but does not activate transcription with natural promoters (17Harman J.G. Peterkofsky A. McKenney K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8072-8077Google Scholar). Irwin and Ptashne (22Irwin N. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8315-8319Google Scholar) isolated three mutants that are positive controls with the gal, lac, and mal operons, and Zhou et al. (19Zhou Y. Zhang X. Ebright R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6081-6085Google Scholar) isolated 21 mutants of CRP that do not activate transcription at the lac promoter but bind to DNA. All these mutations were located at the CRP surface loop, which most likely makes contact with RNA polymerase. S128A is unique; the mutation is at the cAMP binding site about 20 Å from both the DNA and RNA polymerase binding regions and thus would not be expected to effect the RNA polymerase contact region as is substantiated by the energy minimization results. The source of its inactivity appears to be in the DNA binding region, where there is an explicit difference in the DNA binding properties between S128A and CRP. The binding of DNA to S128A reaches saturation at a lower ratio of DNA to S128A concentration than that for DNA binding to CRP. S128A in the presence of cAMP is less active in repression of transcription of the synthetic promoter galP1Δ4 than CRP. This indicates that the DNA·S128A·cAMP2 complex is different than the corresponding CRP complex and may account for the lack of transcriptional activity by S128A. This difference may result from the conformational displacements in the amino acid residues between S128A and CRP at the DNA binding site, particularly observed for Ser179, Glu181, and Thr182 in the energy minimized differences between the cAMP-ligated CRP and S128A complexes. The interaction of Glu181 and Thr182 with the lac operon is supported by electrostatic models (38Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3973-3977Google Scholar) and chemical studies (42Simpson R.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 759-766Google Scholar). Ebright et al. (8Ebright R.H. Kolb A. Buc H. Kunkel T.A. Krakow J.S. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6083-6087Google Scholar) found that Glu181 is directly involved in making sequence specific contact with DNA. More recently, Cheng et al. (43Cheng X. Kovac L. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10816-10826Google Scholar) bound a fluorescein probe to Cys178 and observed that the increase of the fluorescence intensity of the probe correlates with increase in cAMP concentration, whereas a decrease in the fluorescence intensity of the probe correlates with an increase in cGMP concentration. Thus, the binding of cAMP to the CRP site where the Thr127 and Ser128 mutations occur directly affected Cys178 in the DNA binding region. Although energy minimization results involving two mutations in the starting structure should be examined with care, the minimum displacement between the S128A/T127L mutant and CRP residues occurs at Cys178 adjacent to Ser179, and the additional Thr127→ Leu mutation in the S128A mutant does restore the activity of the protein.

More specifically, cAMP binds to at least six amino acid residues including Thr127 in the subunit and Ser128 from the other subunit in the amino-terminal domain of CRP (6McKay D.B. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9518-9524Google Scholar, 7Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 311-326Google Scholar). In the carboxyl-terminal domain, specific amino acids within the helix-turn-helix portion of the E and F α-helices interact with the specific DNA sequences (8Ebright R.H. Kolb A. Buc H. Kunkel T.A.

Indeed, the binding of cGMP to CRP does not exhibit cooperative behavior between the two binding sites, is exothermic (2Gorshkova I.I. Moore J.L. McKenney K.H. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21679-21683Google Scholar), and does not initiate transcription.Single or double amino acid mutations in CRP, as well as minor substitutions in the structure of cAMP, also result in changes in the activity of CRP from the complete absence of transcriptional activity (1Ebright R.H.

Studies on the CRP mutants known to activate transcription in the absence of ligand (CRP*) have been helpful in understanding the conformational change induced in CRP by the ligand. Another class of CRP mutants, positive control mutants, have been particularly helpful in dissecting the transcriptional activation function of CRP. These proteins are able to bind DNA but are unable to efficiently activate transcription (19Zhou Y. Zhang X. Ebright R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6081-6085Google Scholar, 20Bell A.

Typically, positive control mutations are on the surface exposed areas of CRP and are thought to affect protein-protein interactions between CRP and RNA polymerase. The highly specific dependence of transcriptional activation on amino acid substitution in CRP is particularly evident, as will be shown in this investigation by the conversion of the positive control mutant S128A to a CRP* upon the introduction of a second mutation, Thr127→ Leu in the cAMP binding site. Earlier, it was shown that the single Thr127→ Leu mutation in CRP results in activation of transcription by the binding of cGMP and not cAMP (23Moore, J., 1993, The Mechanism of Activation of the Escherichia coli Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein by Cyclic AMP. Ph.D. thesis, George Washington University, Washington, D. C..Google Scholar). Interestingly, the positive control nature of the mutant S128A results from a mutation at the cAMP binding site instead of in the RNA polymerase contact region.Differences in the level of activation induced by minor changes in the cNMP structure and by mutations in CRP may be exhibited in differences in the thermodynamics of the binding of cNMP to mutants of CRP because this is the initial step in the activation of the protein. This is typically exemplified by the contrast between the cooperative and endothermicity of the cAMP to CRP binding reaction, which results in the activation of transcription and the noncooperative nature and exothermicity of the cGMP to CRP binding reaction, which does not activate transcription (2Gorshkova I.I. Moore J.L. McKenney K.H. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21679-21683Google Scholar). In the present investigation, the binding constant (Kb), the binding enthalpy (ΔHb), and the binding entropy (ΔSb) are determined from isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements for cAMP, cGMP, and cIMP binding to S128A and the CRP* mutant T127L/S128A. These thermodynamic quantities are compared with the cNMP binding properties of CRP and T127L from Gorshkova et al. (2Gorshkova I.I. Moore J.L. McKenney K.H. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21679-21683Google Scholar). Because, as will be shown, there is little correlation between the cNMP binding thermodynamics and the level of activity of the ligated protein, differences in DNA binding, in vitro and in vivo, between CRP and the positive control mutant S128A were also investigated to account for the inactivity of the S128A mutant. In addition, energy minimization computations were performed on the cAMP-ligated forms of CRP, S128A, and T127L/S128A to determine any structural changes in the mutant relative to CRP that might account for the difference in activity. In particular, conformational differences between CRP and the mutants were compared in the DNA binding region, the RNA polymerase contact region, and in the hinge region consisting of residues 130-139, which connect the carboxyl-terminal and amino-terminal domains of CRP (6McKay D.B. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9518-9524Google Scholar, 7Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 311-326Google Scholar). Many fundamental biological processes are profoundly affected by small conformational changes induced by the binding of very specific ligand “signal” molecules as well as by single amino acid mutations in the protein. These conformational changes may be evident in the thermodynamics of the ligand-protein/ligand-mutant interaction.

Le Grice S.F.J. Miller J.P. Krakow J.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 182: 91-107Google Scholar), and this change is evident in the cooperative binding between the two binding sites of CRP and in the endothermic nature of the binding reaction (2Gorshkova I.I. Moore J.L. McKenney K.H. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21679-21683Google Scholar).

DISCUSSIONAll the cNMP binding reactions to the T127L (2Gorshkova I.I. Moore J.L. McKenney K.H. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21679-21683Google Scholar), S128A, and T127L/S128A mutants are totally different from those of cAMP binding to CRP. They are exothermic, both enthalpically and entropically driven, and noncooperative. Although the mutants exhibit profound differences in their transcriptional activities, differences in their cNMP binding affinities or free energy changes, ΔΔGob, are small, ranging from 1.2 to −3.6 kJ mol−1 because large differences in the binding enthalpies are compensated by large differences in the binding entropies. This enthalpy-entropy compensation has been observed in many binding reactions including those involving mutated proteins (39Sturtevant J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 69-78Google Scholar) and may be a consequence of the participation of water in the binding reaction in solution (40Lumry R. Rajender S. Biopolymers. 1970; 9: 1125-1227Google Scholar). Enthalpy-entropy compensation may also be a consequence of coupling the transitions between different conformational states of the protein and the binding process (41Eftink M.R. Anusiem A.C. Biltonen R.L. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3884-3896Google Scholar). This coupling would also be accompanied by large heat capacity changes, which are indeed observed for the cNMP binding reactions, especially the cAMP binding reactions.Large changes in the binding heat capacity, ΔCp, occur for the second cAMP binding reaction to CRP (−1.47 ± 0.17 kJ mol−1K−1) and for cGMP binding to the T127L mutant (−0.76 ± 0.12 kJ mol−1K−1)(2), which are both active in the initiation of transcription (23Moore, J., 1993, The Mechanism of Activation of the Escherichia coli Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein by Cyclic AMP. Ph.D. thesis, George Washington University, Washington, D. C..Google Scholar), compared with ΔCp for the first cAMP binding step (−0.30 ± 0.08 kJ mol−1K−1) and cGMP binding to CRP (−0.47 ± 0.15 kJ mol−1K−1)(2). It was proposed that the large differences in ΔCp might reflect the structural changes necessary for activation of transcription (2Gorshkova I.I. Moore J.L. McKenney K.H. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21679-21683Google Scholar). However, a large heat capacity change of −0.87 ± 0.10 kJ mol−1K−1 is also observed for binding of cAMP to S128A, which does not activate transcription. The more negative heat capacity changes may reflect structural changes upon cNMP binding but not necessarily structural changes for activation of transcription. Apparently, there is no direct correlation between the thermodynamic cNMP binding quantities and the initiation of transcription by CRP. Consequently, changes in the activation of transcription must arise from changes in other regions of CRP. The most probable regions are the DNA binding region, the hinge region, or the RNA polymerase contact region of the cNMP-ligated mutants.S128A is a positive control mutant; it binds to the DNA binding site with approximately the same affinity as CRP but does not activate transcription with natural promoters (17Harman J.G. Peterkofsky A. McKenney K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8072-8077Google Scholar). Irwin and Ptashne (22Irwin N. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8315-8319Google Scholar) isolated three mutants that are positive controls with the gal, lac, and mal operons, and Zhou et al. (19Zhou Y. Zhang X. Ebright R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6081-6085Google Scholar) isolated 21 mutants of CRP that do not activate transcription at the lac promoter but bind to DNA. All these mutations were located at the CRP surface loop, which most likely makes contact with RNA polymerase. S128A is unique; the mutation is at the cAMP binding site about 20 Å from both the DNA and RNA polymerase binding regions and thus would not be expected to effect the RNA polymerase contact region as is substantiated by the energy minimization results. The source of its inactivity appears to be in the DNA binding region, where there is an explicit difference in the DNA binding properties between S128A and CRP. The binding of DNA to S128A reaches saturation at a lower ratio of DNA to S128A concentration than that for DNA binding to CRP. S128A in the presence of cAMP is less active in repression of transcription of the synthetic promoter galP1Δ4 than CRP. This indicates that the DNA·S128A·cAMP2 complex is different than the corresponding CRP complex and may account for the lack of transcriptional activity by S128A. This difference may result from the conformational displacements in the amino acid residues between S128A and CRP at the DNA binding site, particularly observed for Ser179, Glu181, and Thr182 in the energy minimized differences between the cAMP-ligated CRP and S128A complexes. The interaction of Glu181 and Thr182 with the lac operon is supported by electrostatic models (38Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3973-3977Google Scholar) and chemical studies (42Simpson R.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 759-766Google Scholar). Ebright et al. (8Ebright R.H. Kolb A. Buc H. Kunkel T.A. Krakow J.S. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6083-6087Google Scholar) found that Glu181 is directly involved in making sequence specific contact with DNA. More recently, Cheng et al. (43Cheng X. Kovac L. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10816-10826Google Scholar) bound a fluorescein probe to Cys178 and observed that the increase of the fluorescence intensity of the probe correlates with increase in cAMP concentration, whereas a decrease in the fluorescence intensity of the probe correlates with an increase in cGMP concentration. Thus, the binding of cAMP to the CRP site where the Thr127 and Ser128 mutations occur directly affected Cys178 in the DNA binding region. Although energy minimization results involving two mutations in the starting structure should be examined with care, the minimum displacement between the S128A/T127L mutant and CRP residues occurs at Cys178 adjacent to Ser179, and the additional Thr127→ Leu mutation in the S128A mutant does restore the activity of the protein. All the cNMP binding reactions to the T127L (2Gorshkova I.I. Moore J.L. McKenney K.H. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21679-21683Google Scholar), S128A, and T127L/S128A mutants are totally different from those of cAMP binding to CRP.

Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6083-6087Google Scholar) found that Glu181 is directly involved in making sequence specific contact with DNA. More recently, Cheng et al. (43Cheng X. Kovac L. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10816-10826Google Scholar) bound a fluorescein probe to Cys178 and observed that the increase of the fluorescence intensity of the probe correlates with increase in cAMP concentration, whereas a decrease in the fluorescence intensity of the probe correlates with an increase in cGMP concentration. Thus, the binding of cAMP to the CRP site where the Thr127 and Ser128 mutations occur directly affected Cys178 in the DNA binding region. Although energy minimization results involving two mutations in the starting structure should be examined with care, the minimum displacement between the S128A/T127L mutant and CRP residues occurs at Cys178 adjacent to Ser179, and the additional Thr127→ Leu mutation in the S128A mutant does restore the activity of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2074257478,"The aim of this study was to construct a single chain chimeric FcϵRIα receptor capable of effector function in leukocytes, including cytotoxic lymphocytes. To determine the most effective single chain FcϵRIα receptor with respect to IgE binding and signaling function, a variety of chimeric gene constructs were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells. The most effective chimera consisted of four parts including: wild-type or mutated extracellular domains (Trp130→ Ala130, W130A) of FcϵRIα, membrane proximal and transmembrane regions of FcγRIIa, and intracellular CD3ζ (ϵIIaIIaζ). Scatchard analysis indicated that these FcϵRIα chimeric receptor bound ligand with an affinity of 0.9 to 2.2 × 109−1. Ligand binding capacity was dramatically reduced with the deletion of 11 membrane proximal amino acids of FcϵRIα; however, function was restored by substitution with the equivalent region of FcγRIIa, suggesting a crucial requirement for a “spacer” segment between the transmembrane and extracellular ligand binding domain. Chimeras that bound IgE effectively also mediated phagocytosis. Chimeric receptors that contained transmembrane ζ were expressed as multimers and consequently did not bind IgE effectively; however, cotransfection of these chimeras with γ-chain largely reconstituted IgE-mediated phagocytosis. The mouse cytotoxic T lymphocyte cell line, CTLLR8 was stably transfected with ϵIIaIIaζ, and cloned transfectants were demonstrated to lyse target cells in an anti-FcϵRIα or IgE antibody-dependent manner. Therefore, functional single chain chimeric FcϵRIα receptors were expressed in the absence or presence of associated ζ or γ molecules and were used to redirect killer lymphocytes to target cells.

In particular, chimeras of single chain Fv (scFv) monoclonal antibody (mAb) linked to FcϵRIγ or CD3ζ have been used to direct cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) to tumor cells in vitro and in vivo (2Moritz D. Wels W. Mattern J. Groner B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4318-4322Google Scholar, 4Hwu P. Shafer G.E. Treisman J. Schindler D.G. Gross G. Cowherd R. Rosenberg S.A. Eshhar Z. J. Exp.

These receptors have proven utility; however, they suffer from two major drawbacks, the first being the need to generate and express individual chimeric antibody receptors for every tumor antigen targeted, and the second that a monospecific interaction between the receptor and tumor cells may be ineffective given that tumor cells have and continually develop heterogeneous antigen expression. By contrast, chimeras comprising Fc receptors (FcR) capable of binding antibodies of a variety of anti-tumor specificities may provide a more effective and universal means of redirecting cytotoxic lymphocytes to tumors. Given the high affinity of FcϵRI for IgE mAb and low serum levels of IgE, it is possible that redirection of effector cells using chimeric FcϵRI might provide a novel, effective anti-tumor strategy. human immunodeficiency virus antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity bovine serum albumin cytotoxic T lymphocyte(s) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high affinity FcR for IgE Fc receptor(s) interleukin-2 immunoglobulin E polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction monoclonal antibody(ies) single chain variable fragment sheep red blood cells T cell receptor trinitrophenyl. FcϵRI is the high affinity receptor for IgE and is found on mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, activated monocytes, and Langerhans cells (8Metzger H. Alcaraz G. Hohman R. Kinet J.-P. Pribluba V.

Med. 1992; 175: 1353-1365Google Scholar). It is a multimeric receptor complex consisting of a ligand binding α subunit, a β subunit, and a homodimer of two signal-transducing γ subunits (8Metzger H. Alcaraz G. Hohman R. Kinet J.-P. Pribluba V. Quarto R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1986; 4: 419-470Google Scholar, 9Ravetch J.V. Kinet J.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 457-492Google Scholar, 12Hulett M.D. Hogarth P.M. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 57: 1-127Google Scholar). The β and γ subunits also play an important role in transport of the α subunit to the cell membrane (13Miller L. Blank U. Metzger H. Kinet J.-P. Science. 1989; 244: 334-337Google Scholar, 14Ra C.

The α subunit of FcϵRI was found to be sufficient for IgE binding using a chimera of extracellular α-chain linked to transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail of p55 interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor (16Hakimi J. Seals C. Kondas J.A. Pettine L. Danho W. Kochan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22079-22081Google Scholar). The IgE binding region was more closely mapped to the second extracellular domain of FcϵRI by using a series of chimeras that interchanged portions of FcϵRI and FcγRIIa or FcγRIII (17Hulett M.D. McKenzie I.F.C. Hogarth P.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 640-645Google Scholar, 18Mallamaci M.A. Chizzonite R. Griffen M. Nettleton M. Hakimi J. Tsien W.-H. Kochan J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22076-22083Google Scholar). The contribution of individual components of receptor complexes to functional receptor expression have also been determined for subunits of the T cell receptor (TCR). The TCR is a multimeric complex composed of an antigen-binding heterodimer (α/β- or γ/γ-chains) together with a set of invariant CD3 chains, γ, γ, ϵ, and ζ (19Clevers H. Alarcan B. Willeman T. Terhorst C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 629-662Google Scholar). The ζ chain is a 16-kDa protein with a 9-amino acid extracellular portion, a 21-amino acid transmembrane region, and a 113-amino acid cytoplasmic tail (20Samelson L.E. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1985; 43: 223-231Google Scholar, 21Weissman A.M. Hou D. Orloff D.G. Modi W.S. Seuanez H. O'Brien S.J. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9709-9713Google Scholar). ζ usually exists as a 32-kDa homodimer but can also form heterodimers with CD3η (22Baniyash M. Garcia-Morales P. Bonifacino J.S. Samelson L.E. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9874-9878Google Scholar, 23Orloff D.G. Frank S.J. Robey F.A. Weissman A.M. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14812-14817Google Scholar) or FcϵRIγ (24Orloff D.G. Ra C.

Immunol. 1991; 147: 4263-4270Google Scholar) via a disulfide bond between cysteine residues present within the transmembrane region. ζ was initially shown to be play an important role in TCR-mediated signal transduction through the use of a ζ-negative T cell hybridoma (26Sussman J.J. Bonifacino J.S. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Weissman A.M. Saito T. Klausner R.D. Ashwell J.D. Cell. 1988; 52: 85-95Google Scholar) and subsequently by ζ-chain transfection studies (27Weissman A.M. Frank S.J. Orloff D.G. Mercep M. Ashwell J.D. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3651-3656Google Scholar, 28Frank S.J. Niklinska B.B. Orloff D.G. Mercep M. Ashwell J.D. Klausner R.D. Science. 1990; 249: 174-177Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic portion of the ζ-chain was demonstrated to be capable of signal transduction in the absence of other members of the TCR complex (29Irving B.A. Weiss A. Cell. 1991; 64: 891-901Google Scholar). Minimal sequence requirements for signal transduction via ζ were located to immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs using this approach (30Romeo C. Amiot M. Seed B. Cell. 1992; 68: 889-897Google Scholar, 31Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3281-3285Google Scholar). CD3ζ contains three such immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs and FcϵRIγ one immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (31Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3281-3285Google Scholar). Similarly, the important region for signaling via the γ subunit of FcϵRI was located to the first 60 amino acids (32Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8905-8909Google Scholar). In this study, we have transiently expressed various FcϵRIζ chimeras in a simian kidney fibroblast cell line, COS-7, to investigate the structural determinants necessary to mediate functional IgE binding and subsequent signal transduction. The most effective chimeric FcϵRIζ receptors bound IgE and phagocytosed opsonized sheep red blood cells (SRBC) efficiently. The function of chimeric FcϵRIα receptors was dependent upon an intact membrane proximal sequence and the type of transmembrane region employed. Expression of optimally functional chimeric FcϵRIζ receptor in a mouse CTL cell line conferred the ability to lyse target cells in an antibody-dependent manner. Relevant portions of molecules were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from cDNA in the following plasmids: human ζ from pGEM3Z-ζ (21Weissman A.M. Hou D. Orloff D.G. Modi W.S. Seuanez H. O'Brien S.J. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9709-9713Google Scholar), human FcϵRIα from pKC3-E.1.1 (17Hulett M.D. McKenzie I.F.C. Hogarth P.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 640-645Google Scholar), human FcϵRIα (tryptophan 130 mutated to alanine 130, W130A) from pKC3-E.1.1, and human FcγRIIa from M13mp18 (33Hibbs M.L. Bonadonna L. Scott B.M. McKenzie I.F.C. Hogarth P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2240-2244Google Scholar). Following amplification, these portions were joined using PCR-splice overlap extension, cut with the appropriate restriction endonucleases, and cloned into the pCMV5 expression vector (34Andersson S. Davis D.N. Dahlbäck H. Jörnvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Google Scholar). A schematic representation and notation of each chimera is shown in Fig. 1.

Each construct was used to transform Escherichia coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene) and fully sequenced using the T7 sequencing kit (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). COS-7, a simian kidney fibroblast cell line, was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 5 × 10−5β-mercaptoethanol, 2 m glutamine, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Cells were maintained at 37°C with 10% CO2. COS-7 cells were grown to 50% confluency (approximately 2 × 105 cells in 2 ml per well), washed twice in DMEM without fetal calf serum, and transiently transfected by the DEAE-dextran method (35Seed B. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3365-3369Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA (5 µg/ml) was incubated for 10 min at room temperature in DMEM containing 0.2 mg/ml DEAE-dextran (Pharmacia) and 1 m chloroquine (Sigma, Darmstadt, FRG). One ml of the mixture was added per well (6-well plates) or 10 ml per flask (175-cm2 tissue culture flasks) (Falcon, Becton Dickinson, Plymouth, UK). Cells were incubated for 4 h at 37°C, prior to media removal and 1-min 10% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide shock. Cells were then washed twice in DMEM and incubated for 48 h prior to harvest. SRBC were washed three times in 0.15 NaCl, resuspended to 2 × 108/ml, and labeled with trinitrophenyl (TNP) by incubating for 20 min in 0.05 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2). After three washes, TNP-SRBC were resuspended to 1 × 108/ml in a 1:5000 dilution of a mouse anti-TNP mAb (IgE ascites of ATCC cell line HB121) in PBS/0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. Following 3 further washes, 2 × 108 IgE-coated SRBC in 1 ml of PBS were added to transfected COS-7 cells in 6-well plates. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 5 min, centrifuged (700 × g/5 min), and finally incubated (4°C/30 min) before being microscopically examined for rosette formation. A rosette was defined as a COS-7 cell that bound more than 5 SRBC, and at least 400 COS-7 cells were evaluated in each well. Transfected COS-7 cells in 6-well plates were stripped nonenzymatically, resuspended in 1 ml of a 1:1000 dilution of 3B4 anti-human FcϵRI (ascites mouse IgG1 mAb) in PBS/0.5% BSA was added to transfected COS-7 cells in 6-well plates (above) and left at 4°C for 1 h. Cells were then washed 3 times in PBS/0.5% BSA and incubated for 1 h at 4°C in 1 ml of a 1:200 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled F(ab′)2 sheep anti-mouse Ig (Silenus, Hawthorn, Australia). After another 3 washes, fluorescence was assessed with a flow cytometer (FACScan, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The percentage of cells whose fluorescence intensity was clearly above that of cells treated with an isotype-matched control antibody (mouse IgG1 mAb; anti-human granzyme B, 1D10) was recorded. Twenty million COS-7 cell transfectants were washed 3 times in PBS and labeled in 200 µl of PBS with 5 µl of sodium [125I]iodide (Amersham, UK) for 5 min in the presence of 1 mg/ml lactoperoxidase (Sigma) and hydrogen peroxide (BDH, Kilsyth, Australia) increasing in concentration every minute from 0.001% to 0.03%. After 3 additional washes, cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.01 Tris, 0.15 NaCl, 1 m EDTA, 1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2% aprotinin) for 30 min at 4°C. Nuclei and cell debris were then pelleted by centrifugation (10,000 × g/15 min/4°C), supernatant was decanted into a fresh tube and precleared with 50 µl of protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia). The lysate was then divided into 2 aliquots and incubated overnight at 4°C in the presence of 50 µl of Sepharose beads coupled to either 3B4 anti-FcϵRIα mAb or to an isotype-matched control mAb (4H10, anti-human metase, mouse IgG1). The beads were washed four times in lysis buffer, heated to 85°C for 10 min, and the eluted proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (10% acrylamide gel). The gel was then dried and analyzed by autoradiography (Kodak). Assays were performed using recombinant Fc portions of human IgE (obtained from Dr. Hannah Gould, King's College, London, UK), prepared by incubating 10 µg of IgE-Fc (in 50 µl of PBS, pH 7.4) with 500 µCi of Na125I (Amersham) in the presence of 1 mg/ml chloramine T (Merck, Darmstadt, FRG) for 30 s on ice. Labeling reactions were stopped with 50 µl of 2.4 mg/ml sodium metabisulfite and 10 mg/ml tyrosine; free 125I was removed from labeled protein by passage through a PD-10 Sephadex G-25 column (Pharmacia). COS-7 cells transiently transfected with chimeric cDNAs were harvested 60 h after transfection, washed twice in PBS/0.5% BSA, and resuspended at 2 × 106/ml in PBS/0.5% BSA for use in binding assays. Fifty-µl aliquots of cells were incubated with 50 µl of serial dilutions of 125I-Fc in PBS/0.5% BSA for 2 h at 4°C. Cells were washed three times in PBS/0.5% BSA, resuspended in 100 µl, and counted in a γ-counter. Phagocytosis of SRBC by transfected COS-7 cells was determined essentially as described in Hutchinson et al. (36Hutchinson M.J. Harrison P.T. Floto R.A. Allen J.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 481-487Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 cells were prepared as for rosetting, then plates were incubated at 37°C for 6 h and washed in PBS to remove nonadherent SRBC. COS-7 cells were then exposed to hypotonic shock for 20 s (PBS, 1 m NaCl, pH 2.5) resulting in lysis of exposed SRBC, but leaving COS-7 cells and any internalized SRBC intact. Cells were then fixed (0.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4) and stained for myeloperoxidase activity (0.004% formaldehyde, 0.3 m o-dianisidine/PBS). The efficiency of phagocytosis was assessed microscopically and expressed as a phagocytic index calculated as the number of SRBC internalized per positive COS cell, where a cell containing 1 or more red cells was considered positive (and 100 were counted). CTL lines were generated by stable transfection of the mouse CTL cell line, CTLLR8 (37Palladino M.A. Obata Y. Stockert E. Oettgen H.F. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 572-576Google Scholar), with a construct containing FcϵRIζ driven by a 7.4-kilobase fragment of the murine perforin 5′-flanking and promoter region including exon I, intron I, and part of exon II (38Lichtenheld M.G. Podack E.R. Levy R.B. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2153-2163Google Scholar). The construct also contained the selectable marker “neo” driven by the thymidine kinase promoter. Transfection was performed by electroporation of 107 cells in 0.25 ml of DMEM at 250 V and a capacitance of 960 microfarads (Gene Pulser, Bio-Rad). Stable transfected clones were derived by culture in complete DMEM containing 0.8 mg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). FcϵRI-expressing clones were established by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis following treatment with 3B4 mAb and by their ability to form rosettes with IgE-coated SRBC. Parental CTLLR8 and the derived 3H2 clone were grown to midlog phase in complete DMEM supplemented with 10% culture supernatant from the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated gibbon T cell leukemia MLA-144 as a source of IL-2. The ability to redirect cytotoxicity using mouse CTLLR8 was assessed using a standard 4-h 51Cr release reverse ADCC assay. 3H2 cells were prepared by washing three times in DMEM and resuspension in 1 ml of complete media with a 1/500 dilution of 3B4 (anti-FcϵRIα) or 4H10 (anti-human Met-1 isotype control) mAb. Following incubation at 4°C for 30 min, cells were washed once in DMEM, counted, and resuspended to 107 cells/ml. Mouse mastocytoma P815 (FcγR+) target cells were washed in RPMI 1640 three times and then incubated for 1 h at 75 µCi of [51Cr]sodium chromate (Amersham, Bucks, UK) in 100 µl of RPMI 1640. After washing with complete medium, these cells were used as targets. The 51Cr-labeled target cells (2 × 104 cells/ml) were mixed with parental CTLLR8 or 3H2 at various ratios in round-bottomed microtiter plates in a total volume of 200 µl for 4 h at 37°C. The plates were then centifuged at 250 × g for 5 min, and 100-µl aliquots of the supernatants were assayed for radioactivity using a γ-counter. The spontaneous release of 51Cr was determined by incubating the target cells with medium alone, whereas the maximum release was determined by adding SDS to a final concentration of 5%. The percent specific lysis was calculated as follows: 100 × [(experimental 51Cr release − spontaneous 51Cr release)/(maximium 51Cr release − spontaneous 51Cr release)]. The ability to redirect cytotoxicity using mouse 3H2 cells was also assessed using a 4-h 51Cr release ADCC assay. An anti-Ly-2(CD8) IgE mAb was employed to direct 3H2 cytotoxicity. E3 (Ly-2+) target cells were washed in RPMI 1640 three times and then incubated for 1 h at 75 µCi of [51Cr]sodium chromate in 100 µl of RPMI 1640. After washing with complete medium, these E3 cells were labeled with chimeric (human/rat) YTS 169.4 anti-Ly-2 IgE mAb (39Isaacs J.D. Clark M.R. Greenwood J. Waldmann H. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3062-3071Google Scholar) for 30 min at 4°C and washed twice in medium at 4°C. Then, 51Cr-labeled target cells (2 × 104 cells/ml) were mixed with 3H2 at various ratios in round-bottomed microtiter plates in a total volume of 200 µl for 4 h at 37°C. The plates were then centifuged at 250 × g for 5 min, and 100-µl aliquots of the supernatants were assayed for radioactivity using a γ-counter. The spontaneous release and the percent specific lysis was calculated as above. In order to construct a chimeric FcϵRI receptor capable of effector function in the absence of endogenous CD3ζ or FcϵRIγ signaling molecules, a number of chimeric gene constructs composed of various extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains were generated by PCR-splice overlap extension and transfected into COS-7 cells (Fig. 1). Expression was initially assessed by flow cytometry using the anti-human FcϵRI mAb, 3B4, that recognizes an epitope located in domain I of FcϵRIα. The level of expression varied between chimeras, ranging from approximately 10 to 25% of cells, and no fluorescence was observed in COS-7 cells transfected with the CMV5 vector alone (Table I).TABLE IFlow cytometric analysis for chimeric FcϵRI expression in COS-7 cellsChimera% positive cellsϵIIaIIaIIa10.0 ± 1.2ϵ−ζζ9.5 ± 1.4ϵ−ζζ+γ subunit6.8 ± 1.0ϵϵζζ11.2 ± 1.0ϵϵζζ+γ subunit10.0 ± 1.1ϵϵζζ (C11S)13.9 ± 1.0ϵϵζζ (C11S) +γ subunit10.9 ± 1.1ϵIIaIIaζ20.7 ± 0.6ϵϵIIaζ25.3 ± 1.8ϵ−IIaζ14.4 ± 1.5ϵIIaIIaζ (W130A)23.4 ± 1.2 Open table in a new tab The capacity of each construct to confer IgE binding ability on transfected COS-7 cells was assessed by a rosetting assay using IgE-coated SRBC (Fig. 2, A and B). Initially, a chimera was generated that included just the IgE binding domains of FcϵRI (lacking an 11-amino acid membrane-proximal region) fused to transmembrane and intracellular ζ (ϵ−ζζ). Although this chimeric receptor was expressed on the cell surface (9.5%, Table I), it was unable to bind IgE as assessed by erythrocyte-antibody complex rosetting (Fig. 2, A and B). Domain II of FcϵRI is largely responsible for binding of IgE (17Hulett M.D. McKenzie I.F.C. Hogarth P.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 640-645Google Scholar, 18Mallamaci M.A. Chizzonite R. Griffen M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 12736-12743Google Scholar) and is normally separated from the cell membrane by the 11-amino acid membrane-proximal region. It was postulated that the lack of IgE binding by ϵ−ζζ might be caused by steric hindrance between FcϵRI domain II and the cell membrane, and, therefore, a new construct was designed that included the membrane-proximal region. The receptor ϵϵζζ was generated which includes the 11-amino acid membrane-proximal region of FcϵRIα. COS-7 cells transfected with ϵϵζζ were able to form few rosettes (approximately 5%). Clearly, the presence of this region between the IgE binding domain II and the membrane permitted some IgE binding. Lysates of COS-7 cells transfected with ϵϵζζ were analyzed by SDS-PAGE following surface iodination and immunoprecipitation with 3B4 mAb. Chimeric molecules of the predicted 50 kDa were demonstrated under reducing conditions (Fig. 3); however, nonreducing conditions revealed only molecules of 120-200 kDa (Fig. 3). This suggested that the chimeric ϵϵζζ receptor existed as a multimeric complex on the cell surface. To determine whether IgE binding was affected by multimerization of chimeric receptor molecules, a construct was made in which Cys11 of transmembrane ζ was mutated to Ser11 (ϵϵζζ(C11S)). Cys11 of ζ has previously been implicated in its dimerization (22Baniyash M. Garcia-Morales P. Bonifacino J.S. Samelson L.E. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9874-9878Google Scholar, 23Orloff D.G. Frank S.J. Robey F.A. Weissman A.M. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14812-14817Google Scholar, 24Orloff D.G. Ra C. Frank S.J. Klausner R.D. Kinet J.P. Nature. 1990; 347: 189-191Google Scholar). A minor increase in rosette formation was observed (up to 10%) (Fig. 2A). Immunoprecipitation and nonreducing SDS-PAGE demonstrated a ratio of ∼60% 50-kDa monomer to ∼40% 120-150-kDa multimeric complex (Fig. 3). Therefore, we hypothesize that other residues in the ϵϵζζ(C11S) chimera might also be responsible for multimer formation. The transmembrane region of ζ was next substituted with that of human FcγRIIa. Human FcγRIIa normally exists as a monomer on the cell surface and can associate with the γ subunit of FcϵRI although this interaction is not necessary for expression. 2J. van der Winkel, personal communication. This chain has previously been used to express monomeric FcR chimeras (17Hulett M.D. McKenzie I.F.C. Hogarth P.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 640-645Google Scholar, 36Hutchinson M.J. Harrison P.T. Floto R.A. Allen J.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 481-487Google Scholar). The resulting construct was a tripartite chimera composed of extracellular FcϵRI, membrane-proximal and transmembrane FcγRIIa, and intracellular ζ (ϵIIaIIaζ). This construct was expressed more effectively in COS-7 cells (Table I), and rosette formation by COS-7 cells transfected with ϵIIaIIaζ was in excess of 50% (Fig. 2, A and B). Immunoprecipitation of ϵIIaIIaζ demonstrated some residual multimeric receptor, but the majority of chimeric receptor existed as the 50-kDa monomer (Fig. 3). A construct simply made up of extracellular FcϵRIα fused to transmembrane and cytoplasmic FcγRIIa (ϵIIaIIaIIa) (Fig. 1) was expressed at lower levels (Table I), but also formed >50% rosettes (Fig. 2A) and existed predominantly as a 50-kDa monomer as determined by immunoprecipitation (data not shown). Replacement of the membrane proximal (Ile170→ Gln180) FcγRIIa with the corresponding region (Gln170→ Ser178) of FcϵRI (ϵϵIIaζ) did not affect the ability of chimeric FcϵRI receptor to rosette IgE-coated SRBC (Fig. 2A). However, complete elimination of the membrane-proximal region, by linking Val169 of FcϵRI directly to Pro179 of FcγRIIa (ϵ−IIaζ), totally abolished rosette formation (Fig. 2A). Immunoprecipitation and nonreducing SDS-PAGE suggested that ϵ−IIaζ does exist predominantly as a monomeric receptor (data not shown). The affinity of transfected FcϵRI chimer"

KI-IOV from volume-expanded cells (either with one-half osmolarity medium or with inclusion of the permeant solute ethylene glycol) demonstrate two ankyrin-binding populations. A high affinity population occurs transiently under volume-expanded conditions. This population has a Bmax of 18 ± 7 µg/mg and a Kd of 25 ± 9 n. Total binding of high and low affinity sites is 57 ± 17 µg/mg. This change in ankyrin affinity is reversible on volume regulatory decrease. A major target protein in the KI-IOV was identified as the skate homolog of the mammalian red cell anion exchanger band 3. Inclusion of the purified cytoplasmic domain of band 3 competes away more than 80% of the ankyrin binding. To determine whether increased ankyrin affinity is due to band 3 tetramer formation that occurs in volume expansion, cells were treated with pyridoxal 5-phosphate or 4,4′-dinitrostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid, two agents that increase tetramer formation under isoosmotic conditions.

During DNA damage-induced recruitment of RNA polymerase (RNAP), there is a physical association of the β subunit of Escherichia coli RNAP and the UvrA component of the repair apparatus (G. C. Lin and L. Grossman, submitted for publication). This molecular affinity is reflected in the ability of the RNAP to increase, in a promoter-dependent manner, DNA supercoiling by the UvrAB complex. In the presence of the RNAP, the UvrAB complex is able to bind to promoter regions and to translocate in a 5′ to 3′ direction along the non-transcribed strand. As a consequence of this helicase-catalyzed translocation, preferential incision of DNA damaged sites occurs downstream on the transcribed strand. Because of the helicase directionality, the initial binding of the UvrAB complex to the transcribed strand would inevitably lead to its collision with the RNAP. These results imply that the RNAP-induced DNA structure in the vicinity of the transcription start site signals a landing or entry site for the UvrAB complex on DNA.

This ATPase provides the energy to drive the UvrAB DNA helicase activity, which can displace short complementary fragments (20-50 oligonucleotides) and D-looped DNA in a 5′→ 3′ direction on the strand to which the UvrAB complex binds (10Oh E.Y.

The UvrAB helicase activity generates supercoiling of relaxed covalently closed circular DNA duplexes (12Koo H.S. Claassen L. Grossman L. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1212-1216Google Scholar). These characteristics suggest that the UvrAB complex tracks along DNA scanning for damage in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner (13Thiagalingam S. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18382-18389Google Scholar, 14Grossman L. Thiagalingam S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16871-16874Google Scholar) and that the helix-turn-helix (15Wang J. Grossman L. J. Biol.

The UvrAB complex eventually leads to the formation of a highly stable UvrB-DNA nucleoprotein complex (17Orren D.K. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15796-15803Google Scholar, 18Visse R. King A.

The binding of the UvrA to undamaged DNA is 103- to 104-fold weaker than to damaged sites (6Mazur S.J. Grossman L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4432-4443Google Scholar, 19Van Houten B. Gamper H. Sancar A.

Hence, the specificity of UvrA for damaged sites is quite limited given that UvrA must be able to recognize a single damaged site per E. coli genome. It seems unlikely that UvrA or UvrAB can locate damage by random passive diffusion, suggesting an alternative scanning mechanism for interaction with damaged substrates (6Mazur S.J. Grossman L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4432-4443Google Scholar, 14Grossman L. Thiagalingam S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16871-16874Google Scholar, 20Bertrand B.E. Selby C.P. Hearst J.E. Sancar A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 27-36Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the UvrAB complex recognizes damaged sites during translocation is not yet understood. A sophisticated requirement of NER is transcription-coupled repair, which quickly targets the repair machinery to genes that are actively transcribed by RNAP. This process is responsible for the rapid removal of possible transcription blocking lesions from the transcribed strand, while the non-transcribed strand is repaired at a slow rate similar to the overall genome (21Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Google Scholar). Preferential repair was found to be conserved from E. coli (22Mellon I. Hanawalt P.C. Nature. 1989; 342: 95-98Google Scholar) to yeast (23Smerdon M.J. Thoma F. Cell. 1990; 61: 675-684Google Scholar) and to mammalian cells (21Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Google Scholar, 24Bohr V.A. Okumoto D.S. Ho L. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16666-16672Google Scholar). The identification of those factors that play a role in transcription-coupled repair is the elucidation of the mechanism of this conserved pathway. In E. coli it has been resolved to a considerable detail. A TRCF was isolated that is necessary and sufficient for transcription-coupled repair in a defined in vitro system (25Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21330-21336Google Scholar). TRCF, encoded by the mfd gene, is able to recognize and displace the stalled RNAP complex and to lead the UvrABC complex to the site of the lesion possibly due to its affinity for the damage recognition subunit UvrA (26Selby C.P. Sancar A. Science. 1993; 260: 53-58Google Scholar). One of the astonishing recent discoveries was that a basal transcription factor, TFIIH, contains components that are integral to nucleotide excision repair, thus establishing an important link between transcription and DNA repair in higher organisms (27Wang Z. Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Kornberg R.D. Friedberg E.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 74-76Google Scholar, 28Schaeffer L. Roy R. Humbert S. Moncollin V. Vermeulen W. Hoeijmakers J.H. Chambon P. Egly J.M.

Zawel L. Ahn K. Sancar A. Reinberg D. Nature. 1994; 368: 769-772Google Scholar). It is speculated that the preferential targeting of repair proteins to actively transcribed genes in eukaryotes is facilitated by the obligatory loading of repair proteins onto promoter regions during transcription initiation (26Selby C.P. Sancar A. Science. 1993; 260: 53-58Google Scholar). It is unclear how the translocation of the UvrAB complex is linked to transcription-coupled repair at the molecular level. From reversible cross-linking experiments and resolution of the resultant components of E. coli RNAP with the Uvr proteins during SOS, it is suggested that a physical interaction between RNAP and repair proteins may be required for the transcription-coupled repair. The effect of this physical interaction is the subject of this study in which its effect on damaged DNA was examined. Here we show that the UvrAB complex preferentially binds to the promoter regions of DNA in an open complex induced by RNAP resulting in enhancing UvrAB induced supercoiling. Further, incision takes place in the strand opposite to which the UvrABC endonuclease binds.

Plasmid DNAs, pTZ18R (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and pHE6 (34Milman G. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 482-491Google Scholar), were prepared using the Qiagen column protocol. DNA molecules were placed on parafilm floating on ice water and irradiated by ultraviolet (UV) light (germicidal lamp) at 130 J/min/m2. λPL promoter fragments were prepared by cutting the plasmid pHE6 with restriction enzymes and labeled at their 3′ ends using the Klenow fragment or Sequenase. The 461-bp DNA fragments containing the λPL promoter were separated on a native polyacrylamide gel after restriction enzyme digestion with BglII and SmaI. This fragment was digested with HpaII and then labeled by filling in with [α-32P]dCTP for the non-transcribed strand (NTS). To label the transcribed strand (TS), BglII-SmaI digested fragments were filled in with [α-32P]dGTP and then digested with the HaeIII restriction enzyme. The sample was loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel with 1 × TBE (89 m Tris, 89 m borate, and 1 m EDTA) buffer. The band corresponding to the expected size was excised after electrophoresis and then sliced into small pieces. The labeled DNA fragments were eluted in TE (pH 8.0) overnight at 37°C. The recovery of labeled DNA was about 70%. The procedure used for following supercoiling has been described previously (12Koo H.S. Claassen L. Grossman L. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1212-1216Google Scholar). Negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA (pTZ18R or p18R) purified using the Qiagen column protocol was relaxed to completion with calf thymus DNA topoisomerase I as follows; DNA was incubated in buffer (50 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 m KCl, 10 m MgCl2, 0.1 m EDTA, 30 mg/ml BSA) with calf thymus DNA topoisomerase I for 2 h and further purified by double phenol extraction followed by phenol/chloroform (1:1) extraction and ethanol precipitation just prior to reaction. The degree of relaxation of DNA was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. Each supercoiling reaction (20 µl) contained 30 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 m MgCl2, 50 m KCl or 50 m NaCl, 1 m DTT, 50 mg/ml BSA, 2-4 m ATP, and 40 ng of relaxed DNA. Incubation was performed at 37°C for various times in the presence of UvrA, UvrB, and E. coli DNA topoisomerase I. To monitor the superhelical states of DNA templates, the reactions were terminated by adding stop solution (0.5% SDS, 25 m EDTA) and 6 µg of proteinase K and then incubation continued for 2 h. DNA samples were run on horizontal agarose gel (20.5 × 24 cm) electrophoresis (0.9% agarose in 0.5 × TPE (44.5 m Tris phosphate, 1 m EDTA) buffer) for 14-16 h at 50 V at room temperature. After electrophoresis, hybridization was followed as described previously (12Koo H.S. Claassen L. Grossman L. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1212-1216Google Scholar). For two-dimensional electrophoresis, DNA samples were loaded in four positions. Once one-dimensional electrophoresis was completed, the gel was soaked in 8 µ chloroquine for 2-3 h. The gel was placed on a gel apparatus with 90° rotation. Electrophoresis was carried out in the buffer containing 8 µ chloroquine for 8 h at room temperature. The extent of highly positive supercoiled form (+) was quantified by the AMBIS Optical Imaging System. E. coli RNAP was mixed with 165 p labeled DNA and 2.5 µ unlabeled plasmid DNA (bp) in a reaction buffer containing 30 m Tris-HCl, 10 m MgCl2, 50-100 m KCl, 100 µg/ml BSA, 1 m DTT. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 15 min. One microliter of DNase I (40 ng/µl) was added successively to the incubation mixture, which was mixed rapidly. The mixture was further incubated at 37°C for 30 s, and DNase I digestion was stopped by the addition of 20 µl of stop solution (4 NH4OAc and 35 m EDTA). The DNA was purified by extraction with phenol/chloroform (1:1) and precipitated with 20 µg of glycogen (Boehringer Mannheim) and 4 volumes of 100% ethanol. The DNA pellet was washed with 0.5 ml of 70% ethanol. The pellet was dried and resuspended in 4 µl of loading buffer (85% formamide, 1 × TBE, 0.01% xylene cyanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue). All samples were heated at 90°C for 3 min and chilled immediately on ice. Samples were loaded onto a 6% urea-sequencing gel (38 × 42 × 0.04 cm, 19:1 (w/w); acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 7 urea, 1 × TBE). For sequencing comparisons, Maxam-Gilbert sequencing was carried out (35Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods in Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Google Scholar). Transcription complexes were formed as in the footprinting experiment, and treated with 1 µl of 100 m KMnO4 and incubated for 2 min at 37°C (36Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8074-8081Google Scholar). The reactions were terminated by the addition of 2 µl of 8.2 of β-mercaptoethanol and placed on ice, followed by the addition of 23 µl of stop solution. After phenol/chloroform extraction, each sample was precipitated with 100% ethanol and 20 µg of glycogen and then treated with 1 piperidine as described by Maxam and Gilbert (35Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods in Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Google Scholar). Sequencing reactions were performed as described by Maxam and Gilbert with the identical substrate used in transcription complexes. After drying in vacuo, all samples were resuspended in loading buffer and electrophoresed through 5% urea-sequencing gels. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film using a Dupont Lighting Plus intensifying screen or to a Phosphor imaging plate. Incision by the UvrABC endonuclease or M. luteus UV-endonuclease was conducted in a volume of 20 µl. The final reaction mixtures contained 30 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 85 m KCl, 10 m MgCl2, 1 m DTT, 2 m ATP. After incubation of the UV-irradiated (400 J/m2) DNA substrates with RNAP at 37°C for 10 min, UvrA (0.1-0.2 pmol) and UvrB (0.3-0.6 pmol) protein were added and then incubated for another 10 min. Incision was initiated by the addition of UvrC(0.3 pmol) protein and incubated for 5 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 21 µl of stop solution and placed on ice. The samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform (1:1) to remove the proteins followed by precipitation with absolute ethanol. The DNA was pelleted, washed with 70% (v/v) ethanol, and dried. Pellets were resuspended in 4 µl of loading solution and heated for 3 min at 90°C. The samples were loaded onto a 5-6% urea-sequencing gel. The M. luteus UV-endonuclease incision was carried out in the buffer as described previously (37Grafstrom R.H. Park L. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13465-13474Google Scholar) or under the same conditions as in the UvrABC incision reaction. RNA polymerase unwinds DNA as it binds to the promoter unwinding DNA continuously as the enzyme extends the growing nascent RNA chain (38Gamper H. Hearst J. Cell. 1982; 29: 81-90Google Scholar). The localized unwinding results in the transient formation of positive supercoils ahead of the RNAP complex and negative supercoils behind it (39Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7024-7027Google Scholar, 40Wu H.Y. Shy S.H. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Cell. 1988; 53: 433-440Google Scholar, 41Tsao Y.P. Wu H.Y. Liu L.F. Cell. 1989; 56: 111-118Google Scholar). Simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (SV40 T antigen) acts similarly as a helicase and is able to unwind duplex DNA producing positive and negative supercoils in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent reaction (42Yang L. Jessee C.B. Lau K. Zhang H. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6121-6125Google Scholar). This process relies on the translocation of proteins along DNA which is accompanied by the unwinding of closed circular duplex DNA. Like SV40 T antigen and RNA polymerase, the UvrAB complex can also unwind DNA generating both positive and negative supercoils in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent reaction (12Koo H.S. Claassen L. Grossman L. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1212-1216Google Scholar). It seems that the initial entrance into DNA by helicases such as SV40 T antigen and the UvrAB complex is due to localized unwinding because DnaB and UvrD, which cannot unwind duplex DNA by just binding to it, are unable to generate supercoils. 2H. Koo and B. Ahn, unpublished information. However, the efficiency with which the UvrAB complex unwinds duplex DNA has not yet been determined. RNA transcription-dependent supercoiling requires the specific binding of RNAP to its promoter for translocation along a transcription unit, whereas SV40 T antigen and the UvrAB complex can bind to DNA nonspecifically. It, however, has not yet been determined where the UvrAB complex initiates translocation. The specific interaction between the β-subunit of RNAP and UvrA 3G. C. Lin and L. Grossman, submitted for publication. provides insights into the potential interaction between transcription and UvrAB catalyzed translocation. Supercoiling reactions were performed under non-transcribing conditions to avoid the complication of dealing with the supercoiling introduced by RNA transcription. UvrA and UvrB proteins were incubated with the closed circular relaxed plasmid, pTZ18R, in the presence of ATP and E. coli DNA topoisomerase I protein. The accumulation of highly positively supercoiled species of DNA (marked in (+)) was greatly increased by T7 RNAP (28-fold, lane 6 in Fig. 1A) or E. coli RNAP (10-fold, lane 7 in Fig. 1B). This synergistic effect on supercoiling is clearly RNAP concentration-dependent. Even at equimolar ratios of relaxed plasmid DNA:RNA polymerase (lane 3 in Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 5 in Fig. 1B) enhancement is evident. One to 0.1 molar ratios of UvrAB to RNAP were sufficient for stimulation of supercoiling (lane 4 in Fig. 1A and lane 5 in Fig. 1B). Saturation was reached at 1:1 ratios (lane 5 in Fig. 1A). At these concentrations little supercoiling occurred by RNAP alone (lane 7 in Fig. 1A, lane 8 in Fig. 1B). Supercoiling stimulation may reflect UvrAB tracking along the template DNA because of the supercoiling reaction under these non-transcribing conditions. Enhancement of supercoiling by the UvrAB complex seems to be due to the binding of RNAP to its promoter (this paper). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to determine the nature of the DNA species formed in the presence of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I, UvrA, UvrB, and RNAP. The first dimension was carried out in TPE buffer, and the second dimension was performed in chloroquine-containing TPE buffer (Fig. 1C). The electrophoretic positions of relaxed DNA (d), nicked form (a), and highly positively supercoiled forms (c) are shown (1 in Fig. 1C). It was reported in previous studies (12Koo H.S. Claassen L. Grossman L. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1212-1216Google Scholar) that highly positive supercoils are formed by UvrAB proteins in this supercoiling reaction (2 in Fig. 1C). When the DNA substrate was incubated in the presence of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I, UvrA, UvrB, and T7 RNAP, highly positively supercoiled DNA was produced as the amount of T7 RNAP was increased (3 and 4 in Fig. 1C). These data are in agreement with those in Fig. 1A and show that the UvrAB complex can generate transient positive and negative supercoils in the presence of RNAP under non-transcribing conditions. The supercoiling by the UvrAB complex was greatly increased when UV-irradiated relaxed DNA was used in the supercoiling reaction (12Koo H.S. Claassen L. Grossman L. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1212-1216Google Scholar). It has been postulated that DNA damaged sites may provide the UvrAB complex with an anchoring site enhancing the translocation of the UvrAB complex along the DNA. Therefore, the binding of the UvrAB complex to DNA was increased, resulting in increasing the number of plasmid molecules being converted into highly positively supercoiled form. In Fig. 1D, supercoiling by the UvrAB complex is increased (8.3-fold) as a consequence of UV damage (393 J/m2) (lane 4), as reported previously (12Koo H.S. Claassen L. Grossman L. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1212-1216Google Scholar, 13Thiagalingam S. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18382-18389Google Scholar). The increase (14-fold) in the formation of highly positive supercoils in the presence of RNAP (lane 5) was greater than that of damaged DNA alone. When UV-damaged DNA and RNAP were included in the supercoiling reaction, supercoiling (19.5-fold, lane 6) was greater than that of undamaged DNA (lane 5) and that in the absence of RNAP (lane 4). The enhancement of supercoiling suggests that RNAP and/or UV-damaged sites provide binding sites for the UvrAB complex. The shift of topoisomers (lane 2) is due to the unwinding of DNA by the presence of photodimers. T7 promoterless plasmids were constructed to determine if the specific binding of RNA polymerase to its promoter is required for enhancement of the UvrAB supercoiling. The T7 promoter region of pTZ18R was excised as a 365-bp fragment by PvuII restriction enzyme followed by ligation. It can be seen in Fig. 2 that the positively supercoiled form (+) was generated by the UvrAB complex with the DNA template containing the T7 promoter (lanes 1 and 2). Under conditions of preincubation with T7 RNAP and relaxed plasmid pTZ18R, there was no further effect on the extent of supercoiling (lanes 3-7). However, in the reaction with the T7 “promoterless” plasmid DNA, the extent of supercoiling was not affected with synergistic levels of T7 RNAP. There were some changes within the spectrum of DNA topoisomeric species generated by the T7 RNAP alone (lane 12) without the UvrAB complex, suggesting some nonspecific binding of T7 RNAP under these experimental conditions. The data from these experiments suggest that the specific binding of T7 RNAP to its promoter may be related to the enhancement of DNA supercoiling by the UvrAB complex and that the RNAP may exert its influence through its effect on DNA structure. The location and extent of binding of UvrAB may be enhanced by the specific binding of RNAP to its promoter. It suggests that the local DNA structure around the promoter is a potential site for the strand and site preferential binding of the UvrAB protein complex. DNase I footprinting was performed to localize the binding of the UvrAB complex to DNA influenced by E. coli RNAP. λPL promoter fragments isolated from plasmid pHE6 were incubated with E. coli RNAP and then digested with DNase I. E. coli RNAP bound to the λPL promoter fragment protects a region from −48 to +18 on the non-transcribed strand and from −48 to +20 on the transcribed strand (Fig. 3). This cleavage site is similar to that observed by Oppenheim's group (43Giladi H. Koby S. Gottesman M.E. Oppenheim A.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 937-948Google Scholar). The DNase I footprinting pattern obtained for RNAP at λPL is also similar to other strong promoters like those in the lac UV5 and λPR promoters. For both promoters, protection by RNAP is extended to about 20 nucleotides downstream beyond the transcription start site. The UV5 promoter was protected upstream of the start site to around −52 (44Kovacic R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13654-13661Google Scholar) and the λPR was protected in the promoter to position −57 and to −52 on the transcribed and non-transcribed strands, respectively (45Craig M.L. Suh W. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15624-15632Google Scholar). In Fig. 3, the DNase I footprinting pattern reflects the location of RNAP, and the UvrAB complex in the presence of ATP. Lanes 6 and 12 are control lanes of free DNA. Lanes 1 and 7 are those regions protected by RNAP. The UvrAB footprints in lanes 4, 5, 10, and 11 show no specific binding by the UvrAB complex under these reaction conditions. When UvrAB and RNAP were incubated together, there is an extended protection region downstream (position a showed 50% protection) beyond the transcription start site at +1 in only the non-transcribed strand (lanes 2 and 3 in Fig. 3B), whereas no like protection is seen in the transcribed strand (lanes 8 and 9). The extended region of protection in the non-transcribed strand is not well defined. It is likely that the UvrAB complex is moving downstream as a consequence of ATP hydrolysis. The extended region of protection in the non-transcribed strand is seen with T7 RNAP as well (data not shown). The direction of the region on the non-transcribed strand of the DNA helix is 5′ to 3′, which is consistent with the directionality of the UvrAB helicase. The UvrAB complex should predominantly bind to this strand to translocate along the strand in a 5′ to 3′ direction. The thymine residues in the single-stranded region of DNA within the open complex (so called transcription bubble) were sensitive to KMnO4 reactivity. The oxidized thymine residues are detected by piperidine-catalyzed cleavage of the DNA strand followed by denaturing gel electrophoresis. KMnO4 oxidizes the 5-6 double bond of thymine to create a diol. Thus, thymine residues in B-form DNA are protected from attack by the bases stacked above and below them, and only those thymine residues in single-stranded or structurally altered DNA regions are efficiently modified (46Hayatsu H. Ukita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 556-561Google Scholar, 47Nielson P.E. J. Mol. Recog. 1990; 3: 1-25Google Scholar). Thymines within the single-stranded synthetic bubble or loop regions of the DNA substrate react uniformly with KMnO4 (59Ahn B. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21462-21470Google Scholar). To examine directly the formation of a single-stranded regions in the λPL promoter, KMnO4 reactions were performed in the presence of RNAP (Fig. 4A). Thymines in positions −11T, −10T, −2T, and −51T (lane 5) in the transcribed strand and −7T (lane 10) in the non-transcribed strand were modified by KMnO4 in the presence of E. coli RNAP (Fig. 4A) and cleaved by piperidine treatment. This cleavage is specific for the active form of RNAP because cleavage is not observed in the presence of heat-denatured RNAP (data not shown) or in the absence of RNAP (lane 3). This indicates that the"
