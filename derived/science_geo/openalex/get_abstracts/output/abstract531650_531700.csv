https://openalex.org/W622076448,"Integrative taxonomy is an approach for defining species and genera by taking phylogenetic, morphological, physiological, and ecological data into account. This approach is appropriate for microalgae, where morphological convergence and high levels of morphological plasticity complicate the application of the traditional classification. Although DNA barcode markers are well-established for animals, fungi, and higher plants, there is an ongoing discussion about suitable markers for microalgae and protists because these organisms are genetically more diverse compared to the former groups. To solve these problems, we assess the usage of a polyphasic approach combining phenotypic and genetic parameters for species and generic characterization. The application of barcode markers for database queries further allows conclusions about the 'coverage' of culture-based approaches in biodiversity studies and integrates additional aspects into modern taxonomic concepts. Although the culture-dependent approach revealed three new lineages, which are described as new species in this paper, the culture-independent analyses discovered additional putative new species. We evaluated three barcode markers (V4, V9 and ITS-2 regions, nuclear ribosomal operon) and studied the morphological and physiological plasticity of Coccomyxa, which became a model organism because its whole genome sequence has been published. In addition, several biotechnological patents have been registered for Coccomyxa. Coccomyxa representatives are distributed worldwide, are free-living or in symbioses, and colonize terrestrial and aquatic habitats. We investigated more than 40 strains and reviewed the biodiversity and biogeographical distribution of Coccomyxa species using DNA barcoding. The genus Coccomyxa formed a monophyletic group within the Trebouxiophyceae separated into seven independent phylogenetic lineages representing species. Summarizing, the combination of different characteristics in an integrative approach helps to evaluate environmental data and clearly identifies microalgae at generic and species levels."
https://openalex.org/W2144266435,"In the last decade, Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) diagnosis and therapy have not notably improved probably due to delay in the diagnosis, among other issues. Precocity and accuracy should be critical parameters in novel AKI biomarker discovery. microRNAs are key regulators of cell responses to many stimuli and they can be secreted to the extracellular environment. Therefore, they can be detected in body fluids and are emerging as novel disease biomarkers. We aimed to identify and validate serum miRNAs useful for AKI diagnosis and management. Using qRT-PCR arrays in serum samples, we determined miRNAs differentially expressed between AKI patients and healthy controls. Statistical and target prediction analysis allowed us to identify a panel of 10 serum miRNAs. This set was further validated, by qRT-PCR, in two independent cohorts of patients with relevant morbi-mortality related to AKI: Intensive Care Units (ICU) and Cardiac Surgery (CS). Statistical correlations with patient clinical parameter were performed. Our results demonstrated that the 10 selected miRNAs (miR-101-3p, miR-127-3p, miR-210-3p, miR-126-3p, miR-26b-5p, miR-29a-3p, miR-146a-5p, miR-27a-3p, miR-93-3p and miR-10a-5p) were diagnostic biomarkers of AKI in ICU patients, exhibiting areas under the curve close to 1 in ROC analysis. Outstandingly, serum miRNAs estimated before CS predicted AKI development later on, thus becoming biomarkers to predict AKI predisposition. Moreover, after surgery, the expression of the miRNAs was modulated days before serum creatinine increased, demonstrating early diagnostic value. In summary, we have identified a set of serum miRNAs as AKI biomarkers useful in clinical practice, since they demonstrate early detection and high diagnostic value and they recognize patients at risk."
https://openalex.org/W609936955,"Cover crop benefits include nitrogen accumulation and retention, weed suppression, organic matter maintenance, and reduced erosion. Organic farmers need region-specific information on winter cover crop performance to effectively integrate cover crops into their crop rotations. Our research objective was to compare cover crop seeding mixtures, planting dates, and termination dates on performance of rye (Secale cereale L.) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) monocultures and mixtures in the maritime Pacific Northwest USA. The study included four seed mixtures (100% hairy vetch, 25% rye-75% hairy vetch, 50% rye-50% hairy vetch, and 100% rye by seed weight), two planting dates, and two termination dates, using a split-split plot design with four replications over six years. Measurements included winter ground cover; stand composition; cover crop biomass, N concentration, and N uptake; and June soil NO3(-)-N. Rye planted in mid-September and terminated in late April averaged 5.1 Mg ha(-1) biomass, whereas mixtures averaged 4.1 Mg ha(-1) and hairy vetch 2.3 Mg ha(-1). Delaying planting by 2.5 weeks reduced average winter ground cover by 65%, biomass by 50%, and cover crop N accumulation by 40%. Similar reductions in biomass and N accumulation occurred for late March termination, compared with late April termination. Mixtures had less annual biomass variability than rye. Mixtures accumulated 103 kg ha(-1) N and had mean C:N ratio <17:1 when planted in mid-September and terminated in late April. June soil NO3(-)-N (0 to 30 cm depth) averaged 62 kg ha(-1) for rye, 97 kg ha(-1) for the mixtures, and 119 kg ha(-1) for hairy vetch. Weeds comprised less of the mixtures biomass (20% weeds by weight at termination) compared with the monocultures (29%). Cover crop mixtures provided a balance between biomass accumulation and N concentration, more consistent biomass over the six-year study, and were more effective at reducing winter weeds compared with monocultures."
https://openalex.org/W1569188151,"Illumina Sequencing data can provide high coverage of a genome by relatively short (most often 100 bp to 150 bp) reads at a low cost. Even with low (advertised 1%) error rate, 100 × coverage Illumina data on average has an error in some read at every base in the genome. These errors make handling the data more complicated because they result in a large number of low-count erroneous k-mers in the reads. However, there is enough information in the reads to correct most of the sequencing errors, thus making subsequent use of the data (e.g. for mapping or assembly) easier. Here we use the term ""error correction"" to denote the reduction in errors due to both changes in individual bases and trimming of unusable sequence. We developed an error correction software called QuorUM. QuorUM is mainly aimed at error correcting Illumina reads for subsequent assembly. It is designed around the novel idea of minimizing the number of distinct erroneous k-mers in the output reads and preserving the most true k-mers, and we introduce a composite statistic π that measures how successful we are at achieving this dual goal. We evaluate the performance of QuorUM by correcting actual Illumina reads from genomes for which a reference assembly is available.We produce trimmed and error-corrected reads that result in assemblies with longer contigs and fewer errors. We compared QuorUM against several published error correctors and found that it is the best performer in most metrics we use. QuorUM is efficiently implemented making use of current multi-core computing architectures and it is suitable for large data sets (1 billion bases checked and corrected per day per core). We also demonstrate that a third-party assembler (SOAPdenovo) benefits significantly from using QuorUM error-corrected reads. QuorUM error corrected reads result in a factor of 1.1 to 4 improvement in N50 contig size compared to using the original reads with SOAPdenovo for the data sets investigated.QuorUM is distributed as an independent software package and as a module of the MaSuRCA assembly software. Both are available under the GPL open source license at http://www.genome.umd.edu.gmarcais@umd.edu."
https://openalex.org/W2150946670,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication and persistence are sustained by a nuclear episome, the covalently closed circular (CCC) DNA, which serves as the transcriptional template for all viral RNAs. CCC DNA is converted from a relaxed circular (RC) DNA in the virion early during infection as well as from RC DNA in intracellular progeny nucleocapsids via an intracellular amplification pathway. Current antiviral therapies suppress viral replication but cannot eliminate CCC DNA. Thus, persistence of CCC DNA remains an obstacle toward curing chronic HBV infection. Unfortunately, very little is known about how CCC DNA is formed. CCC DNA formation requires removal of the virally encoded reverse transcriptase (RT) protein from the 5' end of the minus strand of RC DNA. Tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase-2 (Tdp2) was recently identified as the enzyme responsible for cleavage of tyrosyl-5' DNA linkages formed between topoisomerase II and cellular DNA. Because the RT-DNA linkage is also a 5' DNA-phosphotyrosyl bond, it has been hypothesized that Tdp2 might be one of several elusive host factors required for CCC DNA formation. Therefore, we examined the role of Tdp2 in RC DNA deproteination and CCC DNA formation. We demonstrated Tdp2 can cleave the tyrosyl-minus strand DNA linkage using authentic HBV RC DNA isolated from nucleocapsids and using RT covalently linked to short minus strand DNA produced in vitro. On the other hand, our results showed that Tdp2 gene knockout did not block CCC DNA formation during HBV infection of permissive human hepatoma cells and did not prevent intracellular amplification of duck hepatitis B virus CCC DNA. These results indicate that although Tdp2 can remove the RT covalently linked to the 5' end of the HBV minus strand DNA in vitro, this protein might not be required for CCC DNA formation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W631402746,"In daily life, mobility requires walking while performing a cognitive or upper-extremity motor task. Although previous studies have evaluated the effects of dual tasks on gait performance, few studies have evaluated cortical activation and its association with gait disturbance during dual tasks. In this study, we simultaneously assessed gait performance and cerebral oxygenation in the bilateral prefrontal cortices (PFC), premotor cortices (PMC), and supplemental motor areas (SMA), using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, in 17 young adults performing dual tasks. Each participant was evaluated while performing normal-pace walking (NW), walking while performing a cognitive task (WCT), and walking while performing a motor task (WMT). Our results indicated that the left PFC exhibited the strongest and most sustained activation during WCT, and that NW and WMT were associated with minor increases in oxygenation levels during their initial phases. We observed increased activation in channels in the SMA and PMC during WCT and WMT. Gait data indicated that WCT and WMT both caused reductions in walking speed, but these reductions resulted from differing alterations in gait properties. WCT was associated with significant changes in cadence, stride time, and stride length, whereas WMT was associated with reductions in stride length only. During dual-task activities, increased activation of the PMC and SMA correlated with declines in gait performance, indicating a control mechanism for maintaining gait performance during dual tasks. Thus, the regulatory effects of cortical activation on gait behavior enable a second task to be performed while walking."

Hence defatted cottonseed meals from both glanded (with gossypol) and glandless (without gossypol) cotton seeds were separated into water soluble and insoluble fractions, or water soluble, alkali soluble as well as total protein isolates. The contents of gossypol, total protein and amino acids, fiber and carbohydrates, and selected macro and trace elements in these products were determined and compared with each other and with those of soy meal products. Data reported in this work improved our understanding on the chemical composition of different cottonseed meal products that is helpful for more economical utilization of these products. These data would also provide a basic reference for product standards and quality control when the production of the cottonseed meal products comes to pilot and industrial scales."
https://openalex.org/W1556218031,"Prokaryotic proteins are regulated by pupylation, a type of post-translational modification that contributes to cellular function in bacterial organisms. In pupylation process, the prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein (Pup) tagging is functionally analogous to ubiquitination in order to tag target proteins for proteasomal degradation. To date, several experimental methods have been developed to identify pupylated proteins and their pupylation sites, but these experimental methods are generally laborious and costly. Therefore, computational methods that can accurately predict potential pupylation sites based on protein sequence information are highly desirable. In this paper, a novel predictor termed as pbPUP has been developed for accurate prediction of pupylation sites. In particular, a sophisticated sequence encoding scheme [i.e. the profile-based composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs (pbCKSAAP)] is used to represent the sequence patterns and evolutionary information of the sequence fragments surrounding pupylation sites. Then, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained using the pbCKSAAP encoding scheme. The final pbPUP predictor achieves an AUC value of 0.849 in 10-fold cross-validation tests and outperforms other existing predictors on a comprehensive independent test dataset. The proposed method is anticipated to be a helpful computational resource for the prediction of pupylation sites.

https://openalex.org/W2170705884,"Transcriptional activation by transcription factors is coupled with histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling. However, the relationship between TGF-β1-induced gene transcription by Krüppel-like factor (KLF)-4 and histone acetylation remains unknown. In our study, KLF4 overexpression or knockdown, respectively increased or decreased H3 acetylation and p300 occupancy, which is concentrated in the region containing TGF-β1 control elements (TCEs) of the genes by TGF-β1 regulation during vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation. Coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays showed that phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) formed a complex with KLF4 to inhibit the phosphorylation of the latter in basal conditions. After TGF-β1 signaling activation, PTEN was phosphorylated by p38 MAPK or PI3K/Akt signaling, phosphorylated PTEN lost its ability to dephosphorylate KLF4, and the cofactors interacting with KLF4 switched from PTEN to p300. Then, KLF4-p300 complexes were recruited to KLF4-binding sites of the gene promoter of VSMCs, to acetylate histone H3 and activate transcription. In addition, phosphorylated KLF4 enhanced p300 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity via the p38 MAPK pathway, which may be responsible for H3 acetylation. Taken together, the results of our study reveal a novel mechanism whereby KLF4 mediates the link between TGF-β1-induced gene transcription activation and H3 acetylation during VSMC differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W594443940,"The American Heart Association supports an association between periodontal disease (PD) and atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASVD) but does not as of yet support a causal relationship. Recently, we have shown that major periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola are causally associated with acceleration of aortic atherosclerosis in ApoEnull hyperlipidemic mice. The aim of this study was to determine if oral infection with another significant periodontal pathogen Fusobacterium nucleatum can accelerate aortic inflammation and atherosclerosis in the aortic artery of ApoEnull mice. ApoEnull mice (n = 23) were orally infected with F. nucleatum ATCC 49256 and euthanized at 12 and 24 weeks. Periodontal disease assessments including F. nucleatum oral colonization, gingival inflammation, immune response, intrabony defects, and alveolar bone resorption were evaluated. Systemic organs were evaluated for infection, aortic sections were examined for atherosclerosis, and inflammatory markers were measured. Chronic oral infection established F. nucleatum colonization in the oral cavity, induced significant humoral IgG (P=0.0001) and IgM (P=0.001) antibody response (12 and 24 weeks), and resulted in significant (P=0.0001) alveolar bone resorption and intrabony defects. F. nucleatum genomic DNA was detected in systemic organs (heart, aorta, liver, kidney, lung) indicating bacteremia. Aortic atherosclerotic plaque area was measured and showed a local inflammatory infiltrate revealed the presence of F4/80+ macrophages and CD3+ T cells. Vascular inflammation was detected by enhanced systemic cytokines (CD30L, IL-4, IL-12), oxidized LDL and serum amyloid A, as well as altered serum lipid profile (cholesterol, triglycerides, chylomicrons, VLDL, LDL, HDL), in infected mice and altered aortic gene expression in infected mice. Despite evidence for systemic infection in several organs and modulation of known atherosclerosis risk factors, aortic atherosclerotic lesions were significantly reduced after F. nucleatum infection suggesting a potential protective function for this member of the oral microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W1538791156,"Endotoxin tolerance reprograms Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4-mediated macrophage responses by attenuating induction of proinflammatory cytokines while retaining expression of anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial mediators. We previously demonstrated deficient TLR4-induced activation of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) 4, IRAK1, and TANK-binding kinase (TBK) 1 as critical hallmarks of endotoxin tolerance, but mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we examined the role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Pellino-1 in endotoxin tolerance and TLR signaling. LPS stimulation increased Pellino-1 mRNA and protein expression in macrophages from mice injected with saline and in medium-pretreated human monocytes, THP-1, and MonoMac-6 cells, whereas endotoxin tolerization abrogated LPS inducibility of Pellino-1. Overexpression of Pellino-1 in 293/TLR2 and 293/TLR4/MD2 cells enhanced TLR2- and TLR4-induced nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and expression of IL-8 mRNA, whereas Pellino-1 knockdown reduced these responses. Pellino-1 ablation in THP-1 cells impaired induction of myeloid differentiation primary response protein (MyD88), and Toll-IL-1R domain-containing adapter inducing IFN-β (TRIF)-dependent cytokine genes in response to TLR4 and TLR2 agonists and heat-killed Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, whereas only weakly affecting phagocytosis of heat-killed bacteria. Co-expressed Pellino-1 potentiated NF-κB activation driven by transfected MyD88, TRIF, IRAK1, TBK1, TGF-β-activated kinase (TAK) 1, and TNFR-associated factor 6, whereas not affecting p65-induced responses. Mechanistically, Pellino-1 increased LPS-driven K63-linked polyubiquitination of IRAK1, TBK1, TAK1, and phosphorylation of TBK1 and IFN regulatory factor 3. These results reveal a novel mechanism by which endotoxin tolerance re-programs TLR4 signaling via suppression of Pellino-1, a positive regulator of MyD88- and TRIF-dependent signaling that promotes K63-linked polyubiquitination of IRAK1, TBK1, and TAK1.

The structures of two PDOs from human and Arabidopsis thaliana have been reported; however, little is known about the substrate binding and catalytic mechanism. The crystal structures of two bacterial PDOs from Pseudomonas putida and Myxococcus xanthus were determined at 1.5- and 2.5-Å resolution, respectively. The structures of both PDOs were homodimers, and their metal centers and β-lactamase folds were superimposable with those of related enzymes, especially the glyoxalases II. The PDOs share similar Fe(II) coordination and a secondary coordination sphere-based hydrogen bond network that is absent in glyoxalases II, in which the corresponding residues are involved instead in coordinating a second metal ion. The crystal structure of the complex between the Pseudomonas PDO and GSH also reveals the similarity of substrate binding between it and glyoxalases II. Further analysis implicates an identical mode of substrate binding by known PDOs.

https://openalex.org/W1446378365,"Theories of personality have posited an increased arousal response to external stimulation in impulsive individuals. However, there is a dearth of studies addressing the neural basis of this association.We recorded skin conductance in 26 individuals who were assessed with Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11) and performed a stop signal task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Imaging data were processed and modeled with Statistical Parametric Mapping. We used linear regressions to examine correlations between impulsivity and skin conductance response (SCR) to salient events, identify the neural substrates of arousal regulation, and examine the relationship between the regulatory mechanism and impulsivity.Across subjects, higher impulsivity is associated with greater SCR to stop trials. Activity of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) negatively correlated to and Granger caused skin conductance time course. Furthermore, higher impulsivity is associated with a lesser strength of Granger causality of vmPFC activity on skin conductance, consistent with diminished control of physiological arousal to external stimulation. When men (n = 14) and women (n = 12) were examined separately, however, there was evidence suggesting association between impulsivity and vmPFC regulation of arousal only in women.Together, these findings confirmed the link between Barratt impulsivity and heightened arousal to salient stimuli in both genders and suggested the neural bases of altered regulation of arousal in impulsive women. More research is needed to explore the neural processes of arousal regulation in impulsive individuals and in clinical conditions that implicate poor impulse control."
https://openalex.org/W1512332458,"Despite a continuous rise in consumption of coffee over the past 60 years and recent studies showing positive benefits linked to human health, intensive coffee farming practices have been associated with environmental damage, risks to human health, and reductions in biodiversity. In contrast, organic farming has become an increasingly popular alternative, with both environmental and health benefits. This study aimed to characterize and determine the differences in the prokaryotic soil microbiology of three Brazilian coffee farms: one practicing intensive farming, one practicing organic farming, and one undergoing a transition from intensive to organic practices. Soil samples were collected from 20 coffee plant rhizospheres (soil directly influenced by the plant root exudates) and 10 control sites (soil 5 m away from the coffee plantation) at each of the three farms for a total of 90 samples. Profiling of 16S rRNA gene V4 regions revealed high levels of prokaryotic diversity in all three farms, with thousands of species level operational taxonomic units identified in each farm. Additionally, a statistically significant difference was found between each farm’s coffee rhizosphere microbiome, as well as between coffee rhizosphere soils and control soils. Two groups of prokaryotes associated with the nitrogen cycle, the archaeal genus Candidatus Nitrososphaera and the bacterial order Rhizobiales were found to be abundant and statistically different in composition between the three farms and in inverse relationship to each other. Many of the nitrogen-fixing genera known to enhance plant growth were found in low numbers (e.g. Rhizobium, Agrobacter, Acetobacter, Rhodospirillum, Azospirillum), but the families in which they belong had some of the highest relative abundance in the dataset, suggesting many new groups may exist in these samples that can be further studied as potential plant growth-promoting bacteria to improve coffee production while diminishing negative environmental impacts."
https://openalex.org/W570384166,"Entomopathogenic nematodes have been classified into cruisers (active searchers) and ambushers (sit and wait foragers). However, little is known about their dispersal and foraging behavior at population level in soil. We studied lateral dispersal of the ambush foraging Steinernema carpocapsae (ALL strain) and cruise foraging Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (GPS11 strain) from infected host cadavers in microcosms (0.05 m2) containing Wooster silt-loam soil (Oxyaquic fragiudalf) and vegetation in the presence or absence of non-mobile and mobile hosts. Results showed that the presence of a non-mobile host (Galleria mellonella larva in a wire mesh cage) enhanced H. bacteriophora dispersal for up to 24 hr compared with no-host treatment, but had no impact on S. carpocapsae dispersal. In contrast, presence of a mobile host (G. mellonella larvae) increased dispersal of S. carpocapsae compared with no host treatment, but had no effect on H. bacteriophora dispersal. Also H. bacteriophora was better at infecting non-mobile than mobile hosts released into the microcosms and S. carpocapsae was better at infecting mobile than non-mobile hosts, thus affirming the established cruiser-ambusher theory. However, results also revealed that a large proportion of infective juveniles (IJs) of both species stayed near (≤ 3.8 cm) the source cadaver (88-96% S. carpocapsae; 67-79% H. bacteriophora), and the proportion of IJs reaching the farthest distance (11.4 cm) was significantly higher for S. carpocapsae (1.4%) than H. bacteriophora (0.4%) in the presence of mobile hosts. S. carpocapsae also had higher average population displacement than H. bacteriophora in the presence of both the non-mobile (5.07 vs. 3.6 cm/day) and mobile (8.06 vs. 5.3 cm/day) hosts. We conclude that the two species differ in their dispersal and foraging behavior at the population level and this behavior is affected by both the presence and absence of hosts and by their mobility."
https://openalex.org/W603840394,"Background Long working hours are a worldwide problem and may increase the risk of various health issues. However, the health effects of long working hours on suicidal thoughts have not been frequently studied. Our goal was to investigate the relationship between long working hours and suicidal thoughts in the rapidly developing country of Korea. Methods Data from 12,076 participants (7,164 men, 4,912 women) from the 4th and 5th Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys were used for the current analysis. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for suicidal thoughts. Combined effects of long working hours and lower socioeconomic status or sleep disturbance were also estimated. Results Compared to groups who worked less than 52 hours per week, odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for suicidal thoughts in groups who worked 60 hours or more per week were 1.36 (1.09–1.70) for males and 1.38 (1.11–1.72) for females, even after controlling for household income, marital status, history of hypertension or diabetes mellitus, health-related behaviors, and past two weeks’ experience of injury, intoxication, or acute or chronic diseases, as well as type of work. The combined effects of long working hours with lower socioeconomic status, or with sleep disturbance, were also significantly higher compared to participants who worked less than 52 hours per week with higher socioeconomic status, or with 6–8 hours of nighttime sleep. Conclusion In this study, long working hours were linked to suicidal thoughts for both genders. Additionally, the odds of those suicidal thoughts were higher for lower socioeconomic groups. To prevent adverse psychological health problems such as suicidal thoughts, a strategy regarding long working hours should be investigated."
https://openalex.org/W1549513369,"Steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) is a transcriptional coactivator not only for steroid receptors, such as androgen receptor and estrogen receptor, but also for other transcription factors. SRC-1 has been shown to play an important role in the progression of breast cancer and prostate cancer. However, its role in liver cancer progression remains unknown. In this study, we report that SRC-1 was overexpressed in 25 (62.5%) of 40 human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens. Down-regulation of SRC-1 decreased HCC cell proliferation and impaired tumor maintenance in HCC xenografts. Knockdown of SRC-1 reduced protein levels of the proliferation marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the oncogene c-Myc. Knockout of SRC-1 in mice reduced diethylnitrosamine/CCl4-induced tumor formation in the liver and the expression of c-Myc and PCNA in liver tumors. SRC-1 promoted c-Myc expression, at least in part, by directly interacting with β-catenin to enhance Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Consistent with these results, the expression of SRC-1 was positively correlated with PCNA expression in human HCC specimens, and the expression levels of c-Myc in SRC-1-positive HCC specimens were higher than in SRC-1-negative HCC specimens. In addition, SRC-1 and SRC-3 were co-overexpressed in 47.5% of HCC specimens, and they cooperated to promote HCC cell proliferation. Simultaneous down-regulation of SRC-1 and SRC-3 dramatically inhibited HCC cell proliferation.

HCC grows rapidly and is usually accompanied by vascular invasion, metastasis, recurrence, and poor prognosis. Considering the high incidence and mortality rate of HCC, it is necessary to develop a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the growth and progression of HCC.

Steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1; also known as NCOA1) was first discovered in 1995 as an authentic nuclear receptor coactivator (4Oñate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W.

SRC-1 protein is detected in 19–34% of human breast tumors.

Our previous study demonstrated that SRC-3/AIB1 promotes HCC progression by enhancing cell proliferation and invasion (18Xu Y. Chen Q. Li W. Su X. Chen T. Liu Y. Zhao Y. Yu C.

SRC-1 is another member of the SRC/p160 family whose role in liver cancer remains unknown. In this study, we report that SRC-1 was overexpressed in 25 of 40 human HCC specimens, suggesting a potential impact by SRC-1 on HCC progression. Knockdown of SRC-1 decreased HCC cell proliferation and oncogenic potential in vitro by reducing the expression of c-Myc and PCNA. Consistent with these in vitro results, c-Myc expression levels in SRC-1-positive HCC specimens were higher than levels in SRC-1-negative HCC specimens, and expression of SRC-1 was positively correlated with PCNA in human HCC specimens. Taken together, our results show that SRC-1 is an important regulator of HCC growth and progression that has potential as a therapeutic molecular target for HCC. Forty pairs of HCC specimens and adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues were obtained from the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University (Xiamen, China). Informed consent was obtained from each patient, and the study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institute Research Ethics Committee at Xiamen University. Human HCC cell line HepG2, Huh-7, SK-Hep-1, MHCC97H, MHCC97L, and human hepatocyte cell line L-O2 were cultured in DMEM or 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were transfected with reporter plasmid together with PCR3.1-Rluc as an internal control in the presence of indicated plasmids. Cells were harvested at 48 h post-transfection. Luciferase activity was assayed and normalized to the value of Renilla luciferase activity. Specific and nonspecific siRNAs were purchased from Invitrogen. siRNA was transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To generate stably transfected cells, cells were transfected with the specific shRNA plasmid. The puromycin was used to select stably transfected cells. SRC-1-specific targeting sequences are CCTCAGGGCAGAGAACCATCT and CACGACGAAATAGCCATAC, SRC-3-specific targeting sequence is AGACTCCTTAGGACCGCTT, c-Myc-specific targeting sequence is AGACCTTCATCAAAAACATTT. An MTT assay was used to detect cell proliferative rate. A total of 3000 cells were seeded into 96-well plates, and MTT was added to each well every day. Cells were incubated for 4 h until the solubilization buffer (10% SDS + 0.01 m HCl) was added. The absorbance was measured at 560 nm by a microplate reader. For cell counting, 3 × 104 SRC-1-knockdown cells and control cells were seeded into 12-well plates. Then cells were stained with trypan blue, and live cells were counted every day. The results shown are from triplicate experiments. For this analysis, 4 × 105 cells were seeded into 6-well plates, synchronized by serum starvation for 24 h, and re-entered into the cell cycle by an exchange of medium with 10% FBS DMEM for 24 h. Both adherent and non-adherent cells were harvested and fixed in 70% ethanol at 4 °C overnight. Cells were incubated with RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min and then stained with propidium iodide. Cell cycle status was measured by flow cytometry. We measured DNA synthesis by using a Click-iT 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) Alexa Fluor Imaging Kit (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded into 6-well cell culture plates with glass coverslips at a density of 2.0 × 105 cells/well and incubated in normal DMEM for 48 h. Culture medium was then replaced with DMEM containing 10 μm EdU (Invitrogen). After a 3-h incubation, the cells on the glass coverslips were fixed with formaldehyde. After permeabilization in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100, cells were stained with Alexa 594-azide (Invitrogen). Cells were mounted in mounting medium and imaged with a fluorescence microscope. A total of 4 × 105 cells were seeded into 6-well plates and cultured with either 10% FBS or 1% FBS for 72 h. Both adherent and non-adherent cells were harvested and stained with propidium iodide. Cells were detected and analyzed by flow cytometry. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was obtained from 2 μg of total RNA using a reverse transcription kit (Toyobo). Real-time PCR was performed using universal SYBR Green Master (Roche Applied Science). Relative quantification was achieved by normalization to GAPDH. For co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays, cells were first lysed with lysis buffer. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using the appropriate antibodies or control immunoglobulin G (IgG). After extensive washing, precipitates were analyzed by Western blot analysis. Equal amounts of protein lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes. Filters were probed with the following primary antibodies: anti-SRC-1 (Cell Signaling), anti-SRC-3 (Cell Signaling), anti-PCNA (Cell Signaling), anti-β-actin (Sigma), anti-β-catenin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HA (Roche Applied Science), anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-PARP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-c-Myc (Abcam). Blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce) and visualized by chemiluminescence. The band density was quantified by densitometry using Scion imaging software and normalized to β-actin levels. The coding sequence of SRC-1 was cloned into the pGS5 plasmid at a site downstream of the T7 promoter. Escherichia coli extract-based cell-free in vitro expression of SRC-1 protein was induced using the S30 T7 high yield protein expression system (Promega), following the manufacturer's protocol. For GST pull-down assays, 1 μg of E. coli-produced GST or GST-β-catenin protein was immobilized in glutathione-agarose (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at room temperature. After several washes, the agarose was resuspended and then incubated with in vitro expressed SRC-1 protein at 4 °C. After extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted, resolved using SDS-PAGE, and visualized by immunoblotting. For focus formation assays, 500 cells were cultured in 6-well plates in DMEM with 10% FBS. After 3 weeks, cells were stained with 0.005% crystal violet for 10 min to detect foci, and colonies were counted. Male mice were injected with LiCl, through the tail vein, at a dose of 12.9 mg/kg body weight every 12 h for 2 days. Control mice were injected with the same volume of vehicle (0.9% saline solution). Forty-eight hours following LiCl injection, mice were sacrificed, and the livers were harvested for Western blot analysis. All experimental procedures involving animals were performed in accordance with animal protocols approved by the Laboratory Animal Center of Xiamen University. Four to six-week-old male nude mice were obtained from the Laboratory Animal Center of Xiamen University. A total of 4 × 106 SRC-1-knockdown cells or control cells were subcutaneously injected into the dorsal flanks of mice. From day 6 after injection, the tumor size was measured along two perpendicular axes every 3 days using a vernier caliper. The volume of the tumor was calculated using the formula, volume = length × width2 × 0.5. All experimental procedures involving animals were performed in accordance with animal protocols approved by the Laboratory Animal Center of Xiamen University. SRC-1+/+ and SRC-1−/− mice were maintained on a C57BL/6 background. Fifteen-day-old male SRC-1+/+ and SRC-1−/− mice were intraperitoneally injected with DEN (25 mg/kg). This was followed by biweekly intraperitoneal injections of CCl4 (0.5 ml/kg), starting at 4 weeks of age. After 12 CCl4 injections, when the mice were 27 weeks old, they were sacrificed, and their livers were excised for photographing, quantitation, hematoxylin and eosin staining, and Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis. All experimental procedures involving animals were performed in accordance with animal protocols approved by the Laboratory Animal Center of Xiamen University. Slides were soaked in preheated citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and heated in a microwave for 20 min to retrieve antigen. After cooling, slides were washed with PBS, incubated with Ki-67 antibody (1:500) for 1 h, and then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. After washing, 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride was added to visualize labeled proteins. Data were collected from several independent experiments, with three replicates performed per experiment. All data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistically significant effects (p < 0.05) were evaluated by a two-tailed Student's test. We previously reported that SRC-3/AIB1 was overexpressed in nearly 70% of human HCC specimens and that it promoted HCC progression by enhancing cell proliferation and invasion (18Xu Y. Chen Q. Li W. Su X. Chen T. Liu Y. Zhao Y. Yu C. Overexpression of transcriptional coactivator AIB1 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression by enhancing cell proliferation and invasiveness.Oncogene. 2010; 29: 3386-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As a member of the SRC/p160 family, the role of SRC-1 in HCC progression remains unknown. To evaluate the expression of SRC-1 in HCC, we performed Western blot analysis to detect protein levels of SRC-1 in a set of 40 human HCC specimens. As shown in Fig. 1A, SRC-1 was up-regulated in 25 (62.5%) of the 40 human HCC specimens compared with the surrounding non-tumorous tissues. In addition, mRNA levels of SRC-1 were also up-regulated in HCC specimens compared with non-tumorous tissues (Fig. 1B). Overexpression of SRC-1 in human HCC indicates that SRC-1 may be involved in HCC progression. To determine whether SRC-1 enhances HCC cell proliferation, levels of the cell proliferation marker PCNA were analyzed in HCC specimens. Tumors were divided into two groups according to SRC-1 protein expression: SRC-1-positive (+) and SRC-1-negative (−). As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, SRC-1-positive tumors showed significantly higher protein levels of PCNA than SRC-1-negative tumors. In addition, a positive correlation was identified between the protein levels of PCNA and SRC-1 in HCC specimens (Fig. 1E). These results suggest that SRC-1 may enhance HCC cell proliferation. To determine whether SRC-1 expression is up-regulated in the HCC cell lines compared with the hepatocyte cell line, we used Western blot analysis to compare the protein expression of SRC-1 across five human HCC cell lines (HepG2, SK-Hep-1, Huh-7, MHCC97H, and MHCC97L) and the hepatocyte cell line L-O2. As shown in Fig. 2A, SRC-1 was significantly increased in the HCC cell lines compared with L-O2 cells. To determine the role of SRC-1 in cell proliferation, RNA interference was used to knock down SRC-1 expression. Transfection of two SRC-1-specific siRNAs (siSRC-1-1 and siSRC-1-2) decreased the protein level of SRC-1 in HepG2, Huh-7, and SK-Hep-1 cells (Fig. 2B). Significantly, down-regulation of SRC-1 decreased proliferation in HepG2, Huh-7, and SK-Hep-1 cells, as measured by an MTT assay (Fig. 2C). To establish stable SRC-1-knockdown cell lines for further study, HepG2 cells were transfected with pSuper-SRC-1-shRNA (shSRC-1) or control (shCtrl) constructs. Puromycin was used to select stably transfected cells. Two SRC-1-knockdown stable cell lines (shSRC-1-14 and shSRC-1-15) were established, and the down-regulation of SRC-1 was confirmed in these cell lines by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2D, inset). Stable knockdown of SRC-1 significantly decreased cell proliferation, as measured by MTT assay and direct cell counting (Fig. 2, D and E), and colony formation, as measured by a colony formation assay (Fig. 2F). These results indicate that SRC-1 promotes HCC cell growth. Because down-regulation of SRC-1 decreased HCC cell proliferation, the cell cycle was analyzed to determine whether down-regulation of SRC-1 inhibits cell cycle progression. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the percentage of SRC-1-knockdown cells in G1 phase was increased compared with control cells. This increase was associated with a reduction in the number of cells at S and G2/M phase (Fig. 3A). To detect proliferative cells, EdU staining was performed, and EdU-incorporated cells were calculated. Consistent with a reduced number of SRC-1-knockdown cells in S phase, as measured by flow cytometric analysis, down-regulation of SRC-1 decreased the proportion of EdU-incorporated cells (Fig. 3B). In addition, the percentage of cells in sub-G1 phase, which indicates apoptotic cells, was higher in SRC-1-knockdown cell lines (Fig. 3A), indicating that down-regulation of SRC-1 significantly increases cell apoptosis under normal growth conditions. It has been reported that SRC-1 can regulate the expression of c-Myc in breast cancer cells (12Al-azawi D. Ilroy M.M. Kelly G. Redmond A.M. Bane F.T. Cocchiglia S. Hill A.D. Young L.S.

Metastatic progression with resistance to aromatase inhibitors is driven by the steroid receptor coactivator SRC-1.Cancer Res. 2012; 72: 548-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To determine whether c-Myc expression is affected by SRC-1 in HCC cells, the mRNA levels of c-Myc in stable SRC-1-knockdown and control cells was examined. As shown in Fig. 3C, SRC-1-knockdown cells exhibited a significant decrease in mRNA levels of c-Myc compared with control cells. Consistent with these results, protein levels of c-Myc were also significantly decreased in SRC-1-knockdown cells compared with control cells (Fig. 3D). In addition, SRC-1-knockdown cells showed a significant reduction in the levels of PCNA protein (Fig. 3D). Consistent with data obtained previously from stable SRC-1-knockdown cells, the transient knockdown of SRC-1 significantly decreased protein levels of c-Myc (Fig. 3E, left). By contrast, overexpression of SRC-1 significantly increased protein levels of c-Myc (Fig. 3E, right). To confirm the role of c-Myc in HepG2 cell proliferation, c-Myc-specific siRNA was used to knock down c-Myc expression in HepG2 cells, and cell proliferation was measured. As shown in Fig. 3, F and G, down-regulation of c-Myc did indeed significantly decrease proliferation in HepG2 cells, as measured by an MTT assay and EdU staining. To determine whether SRC-1 affects cell proliferation through regulation of c-Myc, SRC-1-knockdown cells were transfected with c-Myc expression constructs to restore c-Myc expression, and then cell proliferation was examined. The results showed that transfection of c-Myc expression constructs rescued cell proliferation in SRC-1-knockdown cells (Fig. 3H), indicating that SRC-1 affects cell proliferation, at least in part, through the regulation of c-Myc. In agreement with the results obtained from the in vitro experiments, c-Myc expression was significantly higher in SRC-1-positive human HCC tissue than in SRC-1-negative HCC tissue (Fig. 3I), indicating that SRC-1 up-regulates c-Myc to promote human HCC growth. It has been reported that SRC-2, which belongs to the SRC/p160 family, can interact with β-catenin to promote its transactivation activity (20Li H. Kim J.H. Koh S.S. Stallcup M.R. Synergistic effects of coactivators GRIP1 and β-catenin on gene activation: cross-talk between androgen receptor and Wnt signaling pathways.J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 37853-37867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because c-Myc can be directly regulated by the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, we hypothesized that SRC-1 might cooperate with β-catenin to enhance the transactivation of c-Myc. We therefore transfected SRC-1 and/or β-catenin expression constructs, together with a c-Myc promoter reporter, into cells in the absence or presence of LiCl, a reagent that can enhance the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In the absence of LiCl, c-Myc promoter activity was increased 4- and 11-fold by SRC-1 and β-catenin transfections, respectively, whereas it was increased 57-fold when co-transfected with both SRC-1 and β-catenin (Fig. 4A). In the presence of LiCl, the effects of SRC-1 and/or β-catenin on the promoter activity of c-Myc were further enhanced (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that SRC-1 cooperates with β-catenin to enhance the promoter activity of c-Myc. To determine whether SRC-1 specifically enhances β-catenin transactivation activity, we examined the effects of SRC-1 on the activity of the TOPFlash reporter, a well established Wnt/β-catenin reporter. Overexpression of SRC-1 and β-catenin synergistically increased TOPFlash reporter activity in the absence or presence of LiCl (Fig. 4B), indicating that SRC-1 is involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. To test whether SRC-1 regulates the expression of c-Myc, at least in part, through β-catenin, HepG2 cells were transfected with β-catenin expression constructs together with siCtrl or siSRC-1. As shown in Fig. 4C, overexpression of β-catenin significantly enhanced c-Myc protein levels. However, this enhancement was dramatically suppressed when SRC-1 expression was knocked down (Fig. 4C). To detect whether SRC-1 is involved in Wnt/β-catenin signaling in normal hepatocytes in vivo, SRC-1+/+ and SRC-1−/− mice were treated with LiCl, which has been shown to activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in the liver (22Du Q. Park K.S. Guo Z. He P. Nagashima M. Shao L. Sahai R. Geller D.A. Hussain S.P. Regulation of human nitric oxide synthase 2 expression by Wnt β-catenin signaling.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 7024-7031Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4D, LiCl treatment induced levels of c-Myc in the livers of SRC-1+/+ mice significantly higher than those in SRC-1−/− mice, indicating that SRC-1 is required for optimal activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway for inducing c-Myc expression not only in HCC cells but also in normal hepatocytes. To detect whether SRC-1 and β-catenin interact with each other, FLAG-tagged SRC-1 and HA-tagged β-catenin were co-transfected into 293T cells, and co-IP was performed. Anti-HA antibodies, but not control IgG, immunoprecipitated SRC-1 from cell lysates (Fig. 4E, top). Reciprocally, anti-FLAG antibodies, but not control IgG, immunoprecipitated β-catenin from the cell lysates (Fig. 4E, bottom). In addition, the interaction between endogenous SRC-1 and β-catenin in HepG2 cells was detected by co-IP assays using anti-SRC-1 and anti-β-catenin antibodies (Fig. 4F). To determine whether SRC-1 can directly bind to β-catenin, E. coli-produced GST-β-catenin protein was incubated with SRC-1 protein produced by an E. coli extract-based cell-free protein synt"

The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of zinc have been suggested, but few data are available on the relationship between zinc status and inflammatory markers in epidemiological studies.The present study aims to investigate the cross-sectional relationships of serum cytokines and CRP with dietary zinc intake and serum zinc levels in healthy men and women aged 40 and older in rural areas of South Korea.A group of 1,055 subjects (404 men, 651 women) was included in dietary zinc analysis while another group of 695 subjects (263 men, 432 women) was included in serum zinc analysis. Serum IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP were measured as inflammatory markers.There was no significant inverse relationship between dietary zinc intake and inflammatory markers. We found a significant inverse relationship between serum zinc levels and all three inflammatory markers in women (P for trend = 0.0236 for IL-6; P for trend = 0.0017 for TNF-α; P for trend = 0.0301 for CRP) and between serum zinc levels and a single inflammatory marker (IL-6) in men (P for trend = 0.0191), although all R2 values by regression were less than 10%.In conclusion, serum zinc levels may be inversely related to inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP), particularly in women."
https://openalex.org/W2277117704,"The eukaryotic protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis. Polyamine biosynthesis is essential in T. brucei, and the polyamine spermidine is required for synthesis of a novel cofactor called trypanothione and for deoxyhypusine modification of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A). eIF5A promotes translation of proteins containing polyprolyl tracts in mammals and yeast. To evaluate the function of eIF5A in T. brucei, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down eIF5A levels and found that it is essential for T. brucei growth. The RNAi-induced growth defect was complemented by expression of wild-type human eIF5A but not by a Lys-50 mutant that blocks modification by deoxyhypusine. Bioinformatics analysis showed that 15% of the T. brucei proteome contains 3 or more consecutive prolines and that actin-related proteins and cysteine proteases were highly enriched in the group. Steady-state protein levels of representative proteins containing 9 consecutive prolines that are involved in actin assembly (formin and CAP/Srv2p) were significantly reduced by knockdown of eIF5A. Several T. brucei polyprolyl proteins are involved in flagellar assembly. Knockdown of TbeIF5A led to abnormal cell morphologies and detached flagella, suggesting that eIF5A is important for translation of proteins needed for these processes. Potential specialized functions for eIF5A in T. brucei in translation of variable surface glycoproteins were also uncovered. Inhibitors of deoxyhypusination would be expected to cause a pleomorphic effect on multiple cell processes, suggesting that deoxyhypusine/hypusine biosynthesis could be a promising drug target in not just T. brucei but in other eukaryotic pathogens. The eukaryotic protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis. Polyamine biosynthesis is essential in T. brucei, and the polyamine spermidine is required for synthesis of a novel cofactor called trypanothione and for deoxyhypusine modification of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A). eIF5A promotes translation of proteins containing polyprolyl tracts in mammals and yeast. To evaluate the function of eIF5A in T. brucei, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down eIF5A levels and found that it is essential for T. brucei growth. The RNAi-induced growth defect was complemented by expression of wild-type human eIF5A but not by a Lys-50 mutant that blocks modification by deoxyhypusine. Bioinformatics analysis showed that 15% of the T. brucei proteome contains 3 or more consecutive prolines and that actin-related proteins and cysteine proteases were highly enriched in the group. Steady-state protein levels of representative proteins containing 9 consecutive prolines that are involved in actin assembly (formin and CAP/Srv2p) were significantly reduced by knockdown of eIF5A.

Knockdown of TbeIF5A led to abnormal cell morphologies and detached flagella, suggesting that eIF5A is important for translation of proteins needed for these processes.

Inhibitors of deoxyhypusination would be expected to cause a pleomorphic effect on multiple cell processes, suggesting that deoxyhypusine/hypusine biosynthesis could be a promising drug target in not just T. brucei but in other eukaryotic pathogens. Human African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, is a fatal vector-borne disease caused by the single celled parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei (1Stuart K. Brun R. Croft S.

Although the disease reached epidemic levels in the 1990s, the World Health Organization now reports fewer than 10,000 cases, although millions in sub-Saharan Africa remain at risk (5World Health Organization Trypanosomiasis, Human African (Sleeping Sickness). World Health Organization, Geneva2014Google Scholar). Gains made against the disease have been attributed to renewed control efforts and the effectiveness of the new combination therapy nifurtimox/eflornithine. Eflornithine (α-difluoromethylornithine) is a suicide inhibitor of the polyamine biosynthetic enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (6Willert E. Phillips M.A. Regulation and function of polyamines in African trypanosomes.Trends Parasitol. 2012; 28: 66-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The polyamines putrescine and spermidine are cationic amines that are essential for growth in all eukaryotic cells (7Pegg A.E. Feith D.J. Polyamines and neoplastic growth.Biochem. Soc.

They play roles in transcription, translation, and ion channel regulation, although the exact nature of their function in many of these processes remains poorly understood. In trypanosomatids, polyamines play a specialized role in the formation of trypanothione, a unique glutathione-spermidine conjugate that mediates redox balance in these species (10Wirtz E. Leal S.

The one demonstrated universal role for polyamines in eukaryotic cells is the requirement for spermidine to serve as a substrate in the enzyme-catalyzed hypusine (Nϵ-(4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl)lysine) modification of eIF5A (13Park M.H.

Bacteria express a functional counterpart of eIF5A, elongation factor P, that is modified by lysine rather than spermidine, but in contrast, it is not an essential protein. Both eIF5A (mammalian and yeast) and elongation factor P have recently been demonstrated to promote peptide bond formation during the translation of polyprolyl (poly(Pro)) tracts consisting of consecutive prolines (3 or greater) and of triplets of PPX (where X = Gly, Trp, Asp, or Asn) (20Gutierrez E.

The covalent modifications of eIF5A with hypusine and of elongation factor P by lysinylation were both necessary to the function of these proteins in alleviating the ribosome stalling that occurs at these motifs. Although eIF5A/elongation factor P function in the translation of only a subset of proteins, the percentage of proteins containing proline-stalling motifs is high, and it is greater in eukaryotes than in bacteria (33% (human) versus 5.8% (Escherichia coli)) (14Rossi D.

Genome-wide analyses and functional classification of proline repeat-rich proteins: potential role of eIF5A in eukaryotic evolution.PLoS One. 2014; 9e111800 Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although it is still yet to be determined whether poly(Pro) proteins are involved in the control of specific cellular processes, in yeast it was found that a high fraction of proteins involved in cytoskeleton organization and active polarization contains poly(Pro) tracts (24Li T.

Modification of eIF5A occurs on a conserved lysine residue (Lys-50 in human eFI5A) and is catalyzed by two enzymatic reactions: transfer of the 4-aminobutyl moiety from spermidine catalyzed by deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) 2The abbreviations used are: DHSdeoxyhypusine synthaseDOHHdeoxyhypusine hydroxylaseCAP/Srv2pG-actin-binding proteinBSFbloodstream form T. bruceiPFprocyclic form T. bruceiTettetracyclineTbT. bruceiHsHomo sapiensTERTtelomerase reverse transcriptaseqPCRreal time (quantitative) polymerase chain reactionDHODHdihydroorotate dehydrogenaseNnucleusKkinetoplastidVSGvariant surface glycoproteinFLAflagellum adhesion glycoprotein. and hydroxylation of the second carbon by deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH) forming hypusine (Fig. 1A). DHS has been shown to be essential in all species where it has been studied including mammals and yeast (25Park M.H. Wolff E.C. Folk J.E. Is hypusine essential for eukaryotic cell proliferation?.Trends Biochem.

Chem. 2010; 285: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the kinetoplastids and Entamoeba encode two DHS genes, and it was shown for T. brucei that the two gene products (one catalytically active but impaired and the other catalytically inactive) associate to form a heterotetrameric enzyme, which is the functionally active form of the enzyme (26Nguyen S. Jones D.C. Wyllie S. Fairlamb A.H. Phillips M.A. Allosteric activation of trypanosomatid deoxyhypusine synthase by a catalytically dead paralog.J. Biol.

This novel mechanism of enzyme activation by a catalytically inactive paralog was also observed for T. brucei S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, which is required for formation of the DHS substrate spermidine (28Willert E.K. Fitzpatrick R. Phillips M.A. Allosteric regulation of an essential trypanosome polyamine biosynthetic enzyme by a catalytically dead homolog.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The hydroxylase reaction is not found in all eukaryotes; however, the kinetoplastids do contain a homolog of DOHH, and it has recently been shown to be a functional enzyme in Leishmania (30Chawla B.

The finding that DHS is essential in T. brucei and other eukaryotes has sparked interest in identifying inhibitors of DHS as potential drugs for the treatment of proliferative diseases (14Rossi D.

Herein we studied the function of eIF5A in T. brucei by characterizing the effects of RNA interference (RNAi)-induced gene knockdown. We found that eIF5A was essential in both bloodstream form (BSF) and insect stage procyclic form (PF) parasites where knockdown of eIF5A led to morphological abnormalities including cell rounding and detached flagella. We also demonstrate that modification of the conserved lysine with deoxyhypusine is required for eIF5A function in T. brucei. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify T. brucei proteins containing poly(Pro) tracts, and we found that actin-related proteins (formins), cysteine proteases, and flagellum-associated proteins were highly represented in this set. Steady-state protein levels of two representative poly(Pro) proteins involved in the actin cytoskeleton were analyzed after eIF5A knockdown, demonstrating that they were reduced after depletion of eIF5A. Thus eIF5A and deoxyhypusine modification are essential in T. brucei and are required for optimal expression of proteins containing poly(Pro) tracts.

PFs were cultured in SDM-79 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 15% FBS at 28 °C. Antibiotics were added for maintenance of recombinant cell lines based on the nature of the integrated plasmids at the following concentrations: G418 (BSF, 2.5 μg ml−1; PF, 15 μg ml−1; Sigma), hygromycin B (BSF, 2.5 μg ml−1; PF, 25 μg ml−1; Sigma), phleomycin (BSF and PF, 2.5 μg ml−1; Invivogen), blasticidin S (BSF, 2 μg ml−1; PF, 10 μg ml−1; Invivogen), and Tet (BSF, 1 μg ml−1; PF, 10 μg ml−1; Sigma). A 451-base pair region (2–452) of the TbEIF5A coding sequence was identified using RNAit. This segment was PCR-amplified from BSF single marker genomic DNA (primers in Table 1) and TA-cloned into the Gateway entry vector pCR®8/GW/TOPO® (Life Technologies). The entry clone (100 ng) was combined with the destination vector pTrypRNAiGate (100 ng) using the Gateway® LR Clonase® reaction to generate a Tet-inducible stem-loop (Life Technologies) as described (34Kalidas S.

To generate the K50A mutant, the AAA codon was mutated to GCA by Phusion PCR mutagenesis. The PCR mixtures (50 μl) contained 1× Phusion HF buffer, 200 μm dNTPs, 0.5 μm 5′-phosphorylated mutagenesis primers, 30 pg of pCRTM-Blunt II-eIF5A plasmid template, and 1 unit of Phusion polymerase (New England Biolabs). PCR cycling conditions were denaturation at 98 °C for 30 s and annealing and extension at 72 °C for 3 min for 25 cycles followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Plasmid template was digested in a reaction (100 μl) containing 1 μl of DpnI (New England Biolabs), 1× Cutsmart buffer, and 25 μl of PCR mixture. Digested PCR product was purified using the High Pure PCR Product Purification kit (Roche Applied Science). The product was recircularized using the Quick LigationTM kit (New England Biolabs) in a reaction (21 μl) containing 25 ng of PCR product, 1× ligation buffer, and 1 μl of T4 DNA ligase. Chemically competent E. coli Top10 cells (75 μl) were transformed with 2 μl of the ligation reaction, and colonies were selected with kanamycin (50 μg ml−1). pCR-Blunt II-HsEIF5A-K50A plasmids were identified by sequencing using M13 primers. The HsEIF5A-K50A mutant was cloned into the pLew100v5 expression plasmid as detailed above for wild type to generate pLew100v5-HsEIF5A-K50A. K50A eIF5A mutant plasmids were identified by sequencing using M13 primers.

Cells were transferred to a flask containing 50 ml of prewarmed medium and allowed to recover at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 8 h before selection antibiotics were added. The culture was plated into a 48-well plate at 1 ml/well. Residual culture was brought up to 48 ml in selection medium (1:24 dilution) and plated into a second 48-well plate. After the death of parallel negative transfection controls and density of transfected wells reached >105 ml−1, 4 wells were selected for limited dilution to generate clonal cells lines. For PF, 3 × 107 parasites were combined with linearized plasmid (5 μg) in Human T Cell Nucleofector Buffer (100 μl) and transfected using protocol X-014. The cells were transferred to SDM-79 medium supplemented with 20% FBS (10 ml) and plated into a 24-well plate at 1 ml/well. Cells were allowed to recover at 28 °C for 16 h before addition of appropriate selection antibiotics and additional medium. Independent transfectants were diluted again, and cultures arising from the lowest dilution were used for growth experiments. For qPCR analysis of mRNA levels, 5 × 107 cells were collected at the indicated times from Tet-treated cells and untreated controls.

https://openalex.org/W2202385057,"Severe hypertriglyceridemia is a well-known cause of pancreatitis. Usually, there is a moderate increase in plasma triglyceride level during pregnancy. Additionally, certain pre-existing genetic traits may render a pregnant woman susceptible to development of severe hypertriglyceridemia and pancreatitis, especially in the third trimester. To elucidate the underlying mechanism of gestational hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis, we undertook DNA mutation analysis of the lipoprotein lipase (LPL), apolipoprotein C2 (APOC2), apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5), lipase maturation factor 1 (LMF1), and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) genes in five unrelated pregnant Chinese women with severe hypertriglyceridemia and pancreatitis. DNA sequencing showed that three out of five patients had the same homozygous variation, p.G185C, in APOA5 gene. One patient had a compound heterozygous mutation, p.A98T and p.L279V, in LPL gene. Another patient had a compound heterozygous mutation, p.A98T & p.C14F in LPL and GPIHBP1 gene, respectively. No mutations were seen in APOC2 or LMF1 genes. All patients were diagnosed with partial LPL deficiency in non-pregnant state. As revealed in our study, genetic variants appear to play an important role in the development of severe gestational hypertriglyceridemia, and, p.G185C mutation in APOA5 gene appears to be the most common variant implicated in the Chinese population. Antenatal screening for mutations in susceptible women, combined with subsequent interventions may be invaluable in the prevention of potentially life threatening gestational hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis."
https://openalex.org/W561045162,"Anaplasma marginale is a tick-borne rickettsial pathogen of cattle with a worldwide distribution. Currently a safe and efficacious vaccine is unavailable. Outer membrane protein (OMP) extracts or a defined surface protein complex reproducibly induce protective immunity. However, there are several knowledge gaps limiting progress in vaccine development. First, are these OMPs conserved among the diversity of A. marginale strains circulating in endemic regions? Second, are the most highly conserved outer membrane proteins in the immunogens recognized by immunized and protected animals? Lastly, can this subset of OMPs recognized by antibody from protected vaccinates and conserved among strains recapitulate the protection of outer membrane vaccines? To address the first goal, genes encoding OMPs AM202, AM368, AM854, AM936, AM1041, and AM1096, major subdominant components of the outer membrane, were cloned and sequenced from geographically diverse strains and isolates. AM202, AM936, AM854, and AM1096 share 99.9 to 100% amino acid identity. AM1041 has 97.1 to 100% and AM368 has 98.3 to 99.9% amino acid identity. While all four of the most highly conserved OMPs were recognized by IgG from animals immunized with outer membranes, linked surface protein complexes, or unlinked surface protein complexes and shown to be protected from challenge, the highest titers and consistent recognition among vaccinates were to AM854 and AM936. Consequently, animals were immunized with recombinant AM854 and AM936 and challenged. Recombinant vaccinates and purified outer membrane vaccinates had similar IgG and IgG2 responses to both proteins. However, the recombinant vaccinates developed higher bacteremia after challenge as compared to adjuvant-only controls and outer membrane vaccinates. These results provide the first evidence that vaccination with specific antigens may exacerbate disease. Progressing from the protective capacity of outer membrane formulations to recombinant vaccines requires testing of additional antigens, optimization of the vaccine formulation and a better understanding of the protective immune response."
https://openalex.org/W1559724710,"Co-speciation is a fundamental concept of evolutionary biology and intuitively appealing, yet in practice hard to demonstrate as it is often blurred by other evolutionary processes. We investigate the phylogeographic history of the monogenean ectoparasites Gyrodactylus teuchis and G. truttae on European salmonids of the genus Salmo. Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 were sequenced for 189 Gyrodactylus individuals collected from 50 localities, distributed across most major European river systems, from the Iberian- to the Balkan Peninsula. Despite both anthropogenic and naturally caused admixture of the principal host lineages among major river basins, co-phylogenetic analyses revealed significant global congruence for host and parasite phylogenies, providing firm support for co-speciation of G. teuchis and its salmonid hosts brown trout (S. trutta) and Atlantic salmon (S. salar). The major split within G. teuchis, coinciding with the initial divergence of the hosts was dated to ~1.5 My BP, using a Bayesian framework based on an indirect calibration point obtained from the host phylogeny. The presence of G. teuchis in Europe thus predates some of the major Pleistocene glaciations. In contrast, G. truttae exhibited remarkably low intraspecific genetic diversity. Given the direct life cycle and potentially high transmission potential of gyrodactylids, this finding is interpreted as indication for a recent emergence (<60 ky BP) of G. truttae via a host-switch. Our study thus suggests that instances of two fundamentally different mechanisms of speciation (co-speciation vs. host-switching) may have occurred on the same hosts in Europe within a time span of less than 1.5 My in two gyrodactylid ectoparasite species."
https://openalex.org/W2246402463,"Air pollution is known to exacerbate chronic inflammatory conditions of the lungs including pulmonary hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and autoimmune diseases. Directly pathogenic antibodies bind pro-inflammatory cell receptors and cause or exacerbate inflammation. In contrast, anti-inflammatory antibody isotypes (e.g. mouse immunoglobulin G1, IgG1) bind inhibitory cell receptors and can inhibit inflammation. Our previous studies showed that co-exposure to antigen and urban ambient particulate matter (PM2.5) induced severe pulmonary arterial thickening and increased right ventricular systolic pressures in mice via T-cell produced cytokines, Interleukin (IL)-13 and IL-17A. The aim of the current study was to understand how B cell and antibody responses integrate into this T cell cytokine network for the pulmonary hypertension phenotype. Special focus was on antigen-specific IgG1 that is the predominant antibody in the experimental response to antigen and urban ambient PM2.5. Wild type and B cell-deficient mice were primed with antigen and then challenged with antigen and urban particulate matter and injected with antibodies as appropriate. Our data surprisingly showed that B cells were necessary for the development of increased right ventricular pressures and molecular changes in the right heart in response to sensitization and intranasal challenge with antigen and PM2.5. Further, our studies showed that both, the increase in right ventricular systolic pressure and right ventricular molecular changes were restored by reconstituting the B cell KO mice with antigen specific IgG1. In addition, our studies identified a critical, non-redundant role of B cells for the IL-17A-directed inflammation in response to exposure with antigen and PM2.5, which was not corrected with antigen-specific IgG1. In contrast, IL-13-directed inflammatory markers, as well as severe pulmonary arterial remodeling induced by challenge with antigen and PM2.5 were similar in B cell-deficient and wild type mice. Our studies have identified B cells and antigen specific IgG1 as potential therapeutic targets for pulmonary hypertension associated with immune dysfunction and environmental exposures."
https://openalex.org/W750054252,"IL23/IL17 pathway plays an important role in the development of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In general, the genes encoding the cytokines are genetically polymorphic and polymorphisms in genes IL23R and IL17 have been proved to be associated with its susceptibility to inflammatory diseases as well as cancer including colorectal cancer. Moreover, it has been shown that these interleukins are involved in anti-tumor or pro-tumor effects of various cancers. Previously, we showed that there is a significant association between IL17A, IL17F and IL23R polymorphisms as well as the occurrence of colorectal cancer and the clinical features of the disease. The purpose of the present work is to investigate an association between IL17A, IL17F and IL23R polymorphisms in 102 Tunisian patients with colorectal cancer treatment. The association was analyzed by statistical tools. We found that patients with mutated genotypes of IL17A G197A SNP could be a risk factor for the inefficiency of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Unlike IL17F variant, patients with wild type genotypes require surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. On the one hand, we found no evidence that supports a significant association between IL23R polymorphism and the combined genotypes of these three genes and the colorectal cancer treatment. On the other hand, we showed that there is an important interaction between IL17A/IL17F polymorphisms and the stage of the disease as well as its treatment. Finally, patients with IL17F wild type genotype highlighted that there is a valid longer OS without all treatments and with radiotherapy and a neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In contrast, we observed that there are no relationships between IL17A, IL23R and the survival of these patients neither with nor without the treatment. Our results suggest that polymorphisms in IL17A and IL17F genes may be a predictive source of colorectal cancer therapy type. Therefore, IL17F may serve as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1863540665,"Background Evidence of an association between serum vitamin D and cardiovascular disease risk is inconsistent and comes predominantly from studies in high-income settings. We assessed the association between serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D) and cardiovascular disease risk factors in a population of young Indian adults. Methods Cross-sectional analyses of data from APCAPS (Andhra Pradesh Children and Parents Study); a prospective birth cohort study in rural south India. Participants were 1038 (40.3% females) adults aged 18-24 years. Main outcome measures were blood pressures, fasting serum lipids (cholesterols and triglycerides), fasting glucose, insulin, measures of arterial stiffness (aortic augmentation index and aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV)), carotid intima-media thickness, body mass index (BMI) and body fat (dual X-ray absorptiometry). Results Vitamin D deficiency (≤20ng/ml) was observed in 41.1% of this lean (mean BMI: 19.5) and active (mean minutes of moderate or vigorous physical activity per day: 186) population. Vitamin D deficiency was associated with higher median body fat in both males (15.9% body fat in vitamin D deficient males vs. 14.6% in non-deficient males, p<0.05) and females (29.1% body fat in vitamin D deficient females vs. 27.8% in non-deficient females, p<0.05) but no associations were observed between vitamin D deficiency and mean BMI or median fat mass index (FMI). Except a weak inverse association with fasting insulin in males, there was no clear association between serum vitamin D levels and cardiovascular disease risk factors in fully adjusted models. Conclusions We did not find clear evidence for an association between serum vitamin D levels and cardiovascular disease risk factors. Our results, consistent with the limited evidence from randomised trials of vitamin D supplementation and Mendelian randomisation experiments, suggest that the postulated link between serum vitamin D and cardiovascular disease may be non-causal. Instead, it may be attributable to confounding by lifestyle factors such as obesity and physical inactivity which may provide more fruitful targets for cardiovascular disease prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2207325955,"Transgenic mice (Tg) overexpressing human apolipoprotein D (H-apoD) in the brain are resistant to neurodegeneration. Despite the use of a neuron-specific promoter to generate the Tg mice, they expressed significant levels of H-apoD in both plasma and liver and they slowly develop hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. We show here that hepatic PPARγ expression in Tg mice is increased by 2-fold compared to wild type (WT) mice. Consequently, PPARγ target genes Plin2 and Cide A/C are overexpressed, leading to increased lipid droplets formation. Expression of the fatty acid transporter CD36, another PPARgamma target, is also increased in Tg mice associated with elevated fatty acid uptake as measured in primary hepatocytes. Elevated expression of AMPK in the liver of Tg leads to phosphorylation of acetyl CoA carboxylase, indicating a decreased activity of the enzyme. Fatty acid synthase expression is also induced but the hepatic lipogenesis measured in vivo is not significantly different between WT and Tg mice. In addition, expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1, the rate-limiting enzyme of beta-oxidation, is slightly upregulated. Finally, we show that overexpressing H-apoD in HepG2 cells in presence of arachidonic acid (AA), the main apoD ligand, increases the transcriptional activity of PPARγ. Supporting the role of apoD in AA transport, we observed enrichment in hepatic AA and a decrease in plasmatic AA concentration. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the hepatic steatosis observed in apoD Tg mice is a consequence of increased PPARγ transcriptional activity by AA leading to increased fatty acid uptake by the liver."
https://openalex.org/W567143684,"Climate is the predominant environmental driver of freshwater assemblage pattern on large spatial scales, and traits of freshwater organisms have shown considerable potential to identify impacts of climate change. Although several studies suggest traits that may indicate vulnerability to climate change, the empirical relationship between freshwater assemblage trait composition and climate has been rarely examined on large scales. We compared the responses of the assumed climate-associated traits from six grouping features to 35 bioclimatic indices (~18 km resolution) for five insect orders (Diptera, Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Plecoptera and Trichoptera), evaluated their potential for changing distribution pattern under future climate change and identified the most influential bioclimatic indices. The data comprised 782 species and 395 genera sampled in 4,752 stream sites during 2006 and 2007 in Germany (~357,000 km² spatial extent). We quantified the variability and spatial autocorrelation in the traits and orders that are associated with the combined and individual bioclimatic indices. Traits of temperature preference grouping feature that are the products of several other underlying climate-associated traits, and the insect order Ephemeroptera exhibited the strongest response to the bioclimatic indices as well as the highest potential for changing distribution pattern. Regarding individual traits, insects in general and ephemeropterans preferring very cold temperature showed the highest response, and the insects preferring cold and trichopterans preferring moderate temperature showed the highest potential for changing distribution. We showed that the seasonal radiation and moisture are the most influential bioclimatic aspects, and thus changes in these aspects may affect the most responsive traits and orders and drive a change in their spatial distribution pattern. Our findings support the development of trait-based metrics to predict and detect climate-related changes of freshwater assemblages."

Constitutive NF-κB is often found in some types of cancers, contributing to oncogenesis and tumor progression. Therefore, knowing how NF-κB is regulated is important for its therapeutic control. Post-translational modification of the p65 subunit of NF-κB is a well known approach for its regulation. Here, we reported that in response to interleukin 1β, the p65 subunit of NF-κB is phosphorylated on the novel serine 316. Overexpression of S316A (serine 316 → alanine) mutant exhibited significantly reduced ability to activate NF-κB and decreased cell growth as compared with wtp65 (wild type p65). Moreover, conditioned media from cells expressing the S316A-p65 mutant had a considerably lower ability to induce NF-κB than that of wtp65. Our data suggested that phosphorylation of p65 on Ser-316 controls the activity and function of NF-κB. Importantly, we found that phosphorylation at the novel Ser-316 site and other two known phosphorylation sites, Ser-529 and Ser-536, either individually or cooperatively, regulated distinct groups of NF-κB-dependent genes, suggesting the unique role of each individual phosphorylation site on NF-κB-dependent gene regulation. Our novel findings provide an important piece of evidence regarding differential regulation of NF-κB-dependent genes through phosphorylation of different p65 serine residues, thus shedding light on novel mechanisms for the pathway-specific control of NF-κB.

https://openalex.org/W1829452291,"Binocular vision is obviously useful for depth perception, but it might also enhance other components of visual processing, such as image segmentation. We used naturalistic images to determine whether giving an object a stereoscopic offset of 15-120 arcmin of crossed disparity relative to its background would make the object easier to recognize in briefly presented (33-133 ms), temporally masked displays. Disparity had a beneficial effect across a wide range of disparities and display durations. Most of this benefit occurred whether or not the stereoscopic contour agreed with the object’s luminance contour. We attribute this benefit to an orienting of spatial attention that selected the object and its local background for enhanced 2D pattern processing. At longer display durations, contour agreement provided an additional benefit, and a separate experiment using random-dot stimuli confirmed that stereoscopic contours plausibly contributed to recognition at the longer display durations in our experiment. We conclude that in real-world situations binocular vision confers an advantage not only for depth perception, but also for recognizing objects from their luminance patterns and bounding contours."
https://openalex.org/W1902899308,"The Hawaiian islands are an extremely isolated oceanic archipelago, and their fauna has long served as models of dispersal in island biogeography. While molecular data have recently been applied to investigate the timing and origin of dispersal events for several animal groups including birds, insects, and snails, these questions have been largely unaddressed in Hawai'i’s only native terrestrial mammal, the Hawaiian hoary bat, Lasiurus cinereus semotus. Here, we use molecular data to test the hypotheses that (1) Hawaiian L. c. semotus originated via dispersal from North American populations of L. c. cinereus rather than from South American L. c. villosissimus, and (2) modern Hawaiian populations were founded from a single dispersal event. Contrary to the latter hypothesis, our mitochondrial data support a biogeographic history of multiple, relatively recent dispersals of hoary bats from North America to the Hawaiian islands. Coalescent demographic analyses of multilocus data suggest that modern populations of Hawaiian hoary bats were founded no more than 10 kya. Our finding of multiple evolutionarily significant units in Hawai'i highlights information that should be useful for re-evaluation of the conservation status of hoary bats in Hawai'i."
https://openalex.org/W2108433167,"Within the integrated community case management of childhood illnesses (iCCM) programme, the traditional health promotion and prevention role of community health workers (CHWs) has been expanded to treatment. Understanding both the impact and the implementation experience of this expanded role are important. In evaluating UNICEF's implementation of iCCM, this qualitative case study explores the implementation experience in Ghana.Data were collected through a rapid appraisal using focus groups and individual interviews during a field visit in May 2013 to Accra and the Northern Region of Ghana. We sought to understand the experience of iCCM from the perspective of locally based UNICEF staff, their partners, researchers, Ghana health services management staff, CHWs and their supervisors, nurses in health facilities and mothers receiving the service. Our analysis of the findings showed that there is an appreciation both by mothers and by facility level staff for the contribution of CHWs. Appreciation was expressed for the localisation of the treatment of childhood illness, thus saving mothers from the effort and expense of having to seek treatment outside of the village. Despite an overall expression of value for the expanded role of CHWs, we also found that there were problems in supporting and sustaining their efforts. The data showed concern around CHWs being unpaid, poorly supervised, regularly out of stock, lacking in essential equipment and remaining outside the formal health system.Expanding the roles of CHWs is important and can be valuable, but contextual and health system factors threaten the sustainability of iCCM in Ghana. In this and other implementation sites, policymakers and key donors need to take into account historical lessons from the CHW literature, while exploring innovative and sustainable mechanisms to secure the programme as part of a government owned and government led strategy."
https://openalex.org/W1913764559,"The highly specialized coronulid barnacle Xenobalanus globicipitis attaches exclusively on cetaceans worldwide, but little is known about the factors that drive the microhabitat patterns on its hosts. We investigate this issue based on data on occurrence, abundance, distribution, orientation, and size of X. globicipitis collected from 242 striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) that were stranded along the Mediterranean coast of Spain. Barnacles exclusively infested the fins, particularly along the trailing edge. Occurrence, abundance, and density of X. globicipitis were significantly higher, and barnacles were significantly larger, on the caudal fin than on the flippers and dorsal fin. Barnacles were found more frequently and in greater numbers on the dorsal rather than ventral side of the caudal fin and on the central third of dorsal and ventral fluke surfaces. Nearly all examined individuals attached with their cirral fan oriented opposite to the fluke edge. We suggest that X. globicipitis may chemically recognize dolphins as a substratum, but fins, particularly the flukes, are passively selected because of creation of vortices that increase contact of cyprids with skin and early survival of these larvae at the corresponding sites. Cyprids could actively select the trailing edge and orient with the cirri facing the main direction of flow. Attachment on the dorsal side of the flukes is likely associated with asymmetrical oscillation of the caudal fin, and the main presence on the central segment of the flukes could be related to suitable water flow conditions generated by fluke performance for both settlement and nutrient filtration."
https://openalex.org/W1577221282,"Macrophages are important cells of innate immunity with specialized capacity for recognition and elimination of pathogens and presentation of antigens to lymphocytes for adaptive immunity. Macrophages become activated upon exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines and pathogenic stimuli. Classical activation of macrophages with interferon-γ (IFNγ) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) triggers a wide range of signaling events and morphological changes to induce the immune response. Our previous microtubule (MT) proteomic work revealed that the stathmin association with MTs is considerably reduced in activated macrophages, which contain significantly more stabilized MTs. Here, we show that there is a global decrease in stathmin levels, an MT catastrophe protein, in activated macrophages using both immunoblotting and immunofluorescent microscopy. This is an LPS-specific response that induces proteasome-mediated degradation of stathmin. We explored the functions of stathmin down-regulation in activated macrophages by generating a stable cell line overexpressing stathmin-GFP. We show that stathmin-GFP overexpression impacts MT stability, impairs cell spreading, and reduces activation-associated phenotypes. Furthermore, overexpressing stathmin reduces complement receptor 3-mediated phagocytosis and cellular activation, implicating a pivotal inhibitory role for stathmin in classically activated macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2136302759,"In chronic kidney disease (CKD), both anemia and deregulated phosphate metabolism are common and predictive of adverse outcome. Previous studies suggest that iron status influences phosphate metabolism by modulating proteolytic cleavage of FGF23 into C-terminal fragments. Red cell distribution width (RDW) was recently identified as a strong prognostic determinant for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, independently of iron status. We assessed whether RDW is associated with FGF23 cleaving in CKD patients with heart failure.The associations between RDW and either intact FGF23 (iFGF23), C-terminal FGF23 (cFGF23, reflecting iFGF23 and C-terminal fragments together) and the iFGF23/cFGF23 ratio were analyzed in 52 patients with CKD (eGFR 34,9 ± 13.9 ml/min/1.73m2) and chronic heart failure (CHF). Associations between RDW and FGF23 forms were studied by linear regression analysis adjusted for parameters of renal function, iron metabolism, phosphate metabolism and inflammation.Median cFGF23 levels were 197.5 [110-408.5] RU/ml, median iFGF23 levels were 107.3 [65.1-162.2] pg/ml and median FGF23 ratio was 0.80 [0.37-0.86]. Mean RDW was 14.1 ± 1.2%. cFGF23 and RDW were associated (β = 1.63 x 10(-3), P < 0.001), whereas iFGF23 and RDW were not (β = -1.38 x 10(-3), P = 0.336). The iFGF23/cFGF23 ratio was inversely associated with RDW. The difference between cFGF23 and iFGF23 (cFGF23- iFGF23) was positively associated with RDW (β = 1.74 x 10(-3), P < 0.001). The association between cFGF23 and RDW persisted upon multivariable linear regression analysis, adjusted for parameters of renal function, phosphate metabolism, iron metabolism and inflammation (β = 0.97 x 10(-3), P = 0.047).RDW is associated with cFGF23 but not with iFGF23 levels in patients with CKD and CHF. This suggests a connection between RDW and FGF23 catabolism, independent of iron status and inflammation. Future studies are needed to unravel underlying mechanisms and whether these pertain to the link between RDW and outcome."

VhChiP is responsible for the uptake of chitin oligosaccharides, with particular selectivity for chitohexaose. In this study, we employed electrophysiological and biochemical approaches to demonstrate that Trp136, located at the mouth of the VhChiP pore, plays an essential role in controlling the channel's ion conductivity, chitin affinity, and permeability. Kinetic analysis of sugar translocation obtained from single channel recordings indicated that the Trp136 mutations W136A, W136D, W136R, and W136F considerably reduce the binding affinity of the protein channel for its best substrate, chitohexaose. Liposome swelling assays confirmed that the Trp136 mutations decreased the rate of bulk chitohexaose permeation through the VhChiP channel. Notably, all of the mutants show increases in the off-rate for chitohexaose of up to 20-fold compared with that of the native channel. Furthermore, the cation/anion permeability ratio Pc/Pa is decreased in the W136R mutant and increased in the W136D mutant. This demonstrates that the negatively charged surface at the interior of the protein lumen preferentially attracts cationic species, leading to the cation selectivity of this trimeric channel."
https://openalex.org/W1559392677,"Cognitive and neuronal effects of nicotine show high interindividual variability. Recent findings indicate that genetic variations that affect the cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter system impact performance in cognitive tasks and effects of nicotine. The current pharmacogenetic functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study aimed to investigate epistasis effects of CHRNA4/DRD2 variations on behavioural and neural correlates of visuospatial attention after nicotine challenge using a data driven partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) approach. Fifty young healthy non-smokers were genotyped for CHRNA4 (rs1044396) and DRD2 (rs6277). They received either 7 mg transdermal nicotine or a matched placebo in a double blind within subject design prior to performing a cued target detection task with valid and invalid trials. On behavioural level, the strongest benefits of nicotine in invalid trials were observed in participants carrying both, the DRD2 T- and CHRNA4 C+ variant. Neurally, we were able to demonstrate that different DRD2/CHRNA4 groups can be decoded from the pattern of brain activity in invalid trials under nicotine. Neural substrates of interindividual variability were found in a network of attention-related brain regions comprising the pulvinar, the striatum, the middle and superior frontal gyri, the insula, the left precuneus, and the right middle temporal gyrus. Our findings suggest that polymorphisms in the CHRNA4 and DRD2 genes are a relevant source of individual variability in pharmacological studies with nicotine."
https://openalex.org/W569345190,"Thymosin beta-4 (Tβ4) is known to induce hair growth and hair follicle (HF) development; however, its mechanism of action is unknown. We generated mice that overexpressed Tβ4 in the epidermis, as well as Tβ4 global knockout mice, to study the role of Tβ4 in HF development and explore the mechanism of Tβ4 on hair growth. To study Tβ4 function, we depilated control and experimental mice and made tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). To explore the effect of Tβ4 on hair growth and HF development, the mRNA and protein levels of Tβ4 and VEGF were detected by real-time PCR and western blotting in control and experimental mice. Protein expression levels and the phosphorylation of P38, ERK and AKT were also examined by western blotting. The results of depilation indicated that hair re-growth was faster in Tβ4-overexpressing mice, but slower in knockout mice. Histological examination revealed that Tβ4-overexpressing mice had a higher number of hair shafts and HFs clustered together to form groups, while the HFs of control mice and knockout mice were separate. Hair shafts in knockout mice were significantly reduced in number compared with control mice. Increased Tβ4 expression at the mRNA and protein levels was confirmed in Tβ4-overexpressing mice, which also had increased VEGF expression. On the other hand, knockout mice had reduced levels of VEGF expression. Mechanistically, Tβ4-overexpressing mice showed increased protein expression levels and phosphorylation of P38, ERK and AKT, whereas knockout mice had decreased levels of both expression and phosphorylation of these proteins. Tβ4 appears to regulate P38/ERK/AKT signaling via its effect on VEGF expression, with a resultant effect on the speed of hair growth, the pattern of HFs and the number of hair shafts."

We compared structural magnetic resonance images (MRI) of three professional track-and-field athletes to age-, gender- and education-matched control subjects. To determine brain features specific to these top athletes, we tested for significant deviations in structural grey matter density between each of the three top athletes and a carefully matched control sample. While total brain volumes were comparable between athletes and controls, we show regional grey matter differences in striatum and thalamus. The demonstrated brain anatomy patterns remained stable and were detected after 2 years with Olympic Games in between. We also found differences in the fusiform gyrus in two top long jumpers. We interpret our findings in reward-related areas as correlates of top athletes' persistency to reach top-level skill performance over years."
https://openalex.org/W1495697228,"Segment 5, ORF 1 of the infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) genome, encodes for the ISAV F protein, which is responsible for viral-host endosomal membrane fusion during a productive ISAV infection. The entry machinery of ISAV is composed of a complex of the ISAV F and ISAV hemagglutinin esterase (HE) proteins in an unknown stoichiometry prior to receptor engagement by ISAV HE. Following binding of the receptor to ISAV HE, dissociation of the ISAV F protein from HE, and subsequent endocytosis, the ISAV F protein resolves into a fusion-competent oligomeric state. Here, we present a 2.1 A crystal structure of the fusion core of the ISAV F protein determined at low pH. This structure has allowed us to unambiguously demonstrate that the ISAV entry machinery exhibits typical class I viral fusion protein architecture. Furthermore, we have determined stabilizing factors that accommodate the pH-dependent mode of ISAV transmission, and our structure has allowed the identification of a central coil that is conserved across numerous and varied post-fusion viral glycoprotein structures. We then discuss a mechanistic model of ISAV fusion that parallels the paramyxoviral class I fusion strategy wherein attachment and fusion are relegated to separate proteins in a similar fashion to ISAV fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1534133888,"The periodontal ligament has a rich sensory nerve supply which originates from the trigeminal ganglion and trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus. Although various types of mechanoreceptors have been reported in the periodontal ligament, the Ruffini ending is an essential one. It is unknown whether the distribution of periodontal nerve fibers in deciduous teeth is identical to that in permanent teeth or not. Moreover, morphological changes in the distribution of periodontal nerve fibers during resorption of deciduous teeth and eruption of successional permanent teeth in diphyodont animals have not been reported in detail. Therefore, in this study, we examined changes in the distribution of periodontal nerve fibers in the cat during changes in dentition (i.e., deciduous, mixed and permanent dentition) by immunohistochemistry of protein gene product 9.5. During deciduous dentition, periodontal nerve fibers were concentrated at the apical portion, and sparsely distributed in the periodontal ligament of deciduous molars. During mixed dentition, the periodontal nerve fibers of deciduous molars showed degenerative profiles during resorption. In permanent dentition, the periodontal nerve fibers of permanent premolars, the successors of deciduous molars, increased in number. Similar to permanent premolars, the periodontal nerve fibers of permanent molars, having no predecessors, increased in number, and were densely present in the apical portion. The present results indicate that the distribution of periodontal nerve fibers in deciduous dentition is almost identical to that in permanent dentition although the number of periodontal nerve fibers in deciduous dentition was low. The sparse distribution of periodontal nerve fibers in deciduous dentition agrees with clinical evidence that children are less sensitive to tooth stimulation than adults."

Flow analysis has been carried out under the approximations of a low Reynolds number and long wavelength. Coupled equations are solved using shooting method for numerical solution for the axial velocity function, temperature and pressure gradient distributions. We analyze the influence of various interesting parameters on flow quantities. The present study can be considered as a mathematical presentation of the dynamics of physiological organs with stones."
https://openalex.org/W565202497,"Due to changes in land use, the natural habitats of an increasing number of plant species have become more and more fragmented. In landscapes that consist of patches of suitable habitat, the frequency and extent of long-distance seed dispersal can be expected to be an important factor determining local genetic diversity and regional population structure of the remaining populations. In plant species that are restricted to riparian habitats, rivers can be expected to have a strong impact on the dynamics and spatial genetic structure of populations as they may enable long-distance seed dispersal and thus maintain gene flow between fragmented populations. In this study, we used polymorphic microsatellite markers to investigate the genetic diversity and the spatial genetic structure of 28 populations of Saxifraga granulata along two rivers in central Belgium. We hypothesized that rivers might be essential for gene flow among increasingly isolated populations of this species. Genetic diversity was high (HS = 0.68), which to a certain extent can be explained by the octoploid nature of S. granulata in the study area. Populations along the Dijle and Demer rivers were also highly differentiated (G""ST = 0.269 and 0.164 and DEST = 0.190 and 0.124, respectively) and showed significant isolation-by-distance, indicating moderate levels of gene flow primarily between populations that are geographically close to each other. Along the river Demer population genetic diversity was higher upstream than downstream, suggesting that seed dispersal via the water was not the primary mode of dispersal. Overall, these results indicate that despite increasing fragmentation populations along both rivers were highly genetically diverse. The high ploidy level and longevity of S. granulata have most likely buffered negative effects of fragmentation on genetic diversity and the spatial genetic structure of populations in riparian grasslands."
https://openalex.org/W1822922665,"Restoration of endogenous insulin production by islet transplantation is considered a curative option for patients with type 1 diabetes. However, recurrent autoimmunity and alloreactivity cause graft rejection hindering successful transplantation. Here we tested whether transplant tolerance to allogeneic islets could be achieved in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice by simultaneously tackling autoimmunity via antigen-specific immunization, and alloreactivity via granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and rapamycin (RAPA) treatment. Immunization with insB9-23 peptide alone or in combination with two islet peptides (IGRP206-214 and GAD524-543) in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) were tested for promoting syngeneic pancreatic islet engraftment in spontaneously diabetic NOD mice. Treatment with G-CSF/RAPA alone or in combination with insB9-23/IFA was examined for promoting allogeneic islet engraftment in the same mouse model. InsB9-23/IFA immunization significantly prolonged syngeneic pancreatic islet survival in NOD mice by a mechanism that necessitated the presence of CD4+CD25+ T regulatory (Treg) cells, while combination of three islet epitopes was less efficacious in controlling recurrent autoimmunity. G-CSF/RAPA treatment was unable to reverse T1D or control recurrent autoimmunity but significantly prolonged islet allograft survival in NOD mice. Blockade of interleukin-10 (IL-10) during G-CSF/RAPA treatment resulted in allograft rejection suggesting that IL-10-producing cells were fundamental to achieve transplant tolerance. G-CSF/RAPA treatment combined with insB9-23/IFA did not further increase the survival of allogeneic islets. Thus, insB9-23/IFA immunization controls recurrent autoimmunity and G-CSF/RAPA treatment limits alloreactivity, however their combination does not further promote allogeneic pancreatic islet engraftment in NOD mice."
https://openalex.org/W1912211568,"Activating Ras signaling is a major driver in juvenile and the myeloproliferative variant of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML/MP-CMML). Numerous studies suggest that GM-CSF signaling plays a central role in establishing and maintaining JMML/MP-CMML phenotypes in human and mouse. However, it remains elusive how GM-CSF signaling impacts on JMML/MP-CMML initiation and progression. Here, we investigate this issue in a well characterized MP-CMML model induced by endogenous NrasG12D/+ mutation. In this model, NrasG12D/+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are required to initiate and maintain CMML phenotypes and serve as CMML-initiating cells. We show that the common β chain of the GM-CSF receptor (βc) is dispensable for NrasG12D/+ HSC function; loss of βc does not affect the expansion, increased self-renewal, or myeloid differentiation bias in NrasG12D/+ HSCs. Therefore, βc−/− does not abrogate CMML in NrasG12D/+ mice. However, βc deficiency indeed significantly reduces NrasG12D/+-induced splenomegaly and spontaneous colony formation and prolongs the survival of CMML-bearing mice, suggesting that GM-CSF signaling plays an important role in promoting CMML progression. Together, our results suggest that inhibiting GM-CSF signaling in JMML/MP-CMML patients might alleviate disease symptoms but would not eradicate the disease.

https://openalex.org/W2202326665,"The study was performed in order to determine whether peripheral blood monocyte in vitro function, and lymphocyte in vivo activation at diagnosis, was associated with HPV tumor infection status and 15-year survival in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. Sixty-five patients from a consecutive cohort of newly diagnosed HNSCCs, together with 18 control patients, were included in the study. Monocyte responsiveness was assessed by measuring monocyte in vitro interleukin (IL)-6 secretions after 24 hours of LPS stimulation in cultures with a serum-free medium. T lymphocyte activation was determined as the fraction of CD71-positive cells on CD3-positive cells by flow cytometry, whereas HPV infection was determined by PCR on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue. Disease-specific survivals and overall survivals were determined 15 years following inclusion. HPV-positive HNSCC patients had a lower monocyte LPS-stimulated IL-6 response. A high LPS-stimulated monocyte IL-6 response predicted a decreased survival rate (P=0.019). A high percentage of CD71-positive T lymphocytes also predicted an impaired prognosis (P=0.021). The predictive power of IL-6 monocyte LPS-stimulated responses was retained when adjusted for age, gender and TNM stage of the patients. The monocyte and T lymphocyte survival predictions were independent of each other. The survival was particularly low with a combined high activated monocyte and T lymphocyte status. In a multivariate analysis, IL-6 secretion and the percentage of CD71-positive T lymphocytes both uniquely predicted survival independent of HPV infection status. It is postulated that the natural and adaptive immune systems are separately and additionally linked to the clinical aggressiveness of HNSCCs."
https://openalex.org/W1643737658,"Light has direct effects on sleep and wakefulness causing arousal in diurnal animals and sleep in nocturnal animals. In the present study, we assessed the modulation of light-induced sleep by melanopsin and the histaminergic system by exposing mice to millisecond light flashes and continuous light respectively. First, we show that the induction of sleep by millisecond light flashes is dose dependent as a function of light flash number. We found that exposure to 60 flashes of light occurring once every 60 seconds for 1-h (120-ms of total light over an hour) induced a similar amount of sleep as a continuous bright light pulse. Secondly, the induction of sleep by millisecond light flashes was attenuated in the absence of melanopsin when animals were presented with flashes occurring every 60 seconds over a 3-h period beginning at ZT13. Lastly, the acute administration of a histamine H3 autoreceptor antagonist, ciproxifan, blocked the induction of sleep by a 1-h continuous light pulse during the dark period. Ciproxifan caused a decrease in NREMS delta power and an increase in theta activity during both sleep and wake periods respectively. The data suggest that some form of temporal integration occurs in response to millisecond light flashes, and that this process requires melanopsin photoreception. Furthermore, the pharmacological data suggest that the increase of histaminergic neurotransmission is sufficient to attenuate the light-induced sleep response during the dark period."
https://openalex.org/W583503675,"Introduction Microarray analysis has revolutionized the role of genomic prognostication in breast cancer. However, most studies are single series studies, and suffer from methodological problems. We sought to use a meta-analytic approach in combining multiple publicly available datasets, while correcting for batch effects, to reach a more robust oncogenomic analysis. Aim The aim of the present study was to find gene sets associated with distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) in systemically untreated, node-negative breast cancer patients, from publicly available genomic microarray datasets. Methods Four microarray series (having 742 patients) were selected after a systematic search and combined. Cox regression for each gene was done for the combined dataset (univariate, as well as multivariate – adjusted for expression of Cell cycle related genes) and for the 4 major molecular subtypes. The centre and microarray batch effects were adjusted by including them as random effects variables. The Cox regression coefficients for each analysis were then ranked and subjected to a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Results Gene sets representing protein translation were independently negatively associated with metastasis in the Luminal A and Luminal B subtypes, but positively associated with metastasis in Basal tumors. Proteinaceous extracellular matrix (ECM) gene set expression was positively associated with metastasis, after adjustment for expression of cell cycle related genes on the combined dataset. Finally, the positive association of the proliferation-related genes with metastases was confirmed. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, the results depicting mixed prognostic significance of protein translation in breast cancer subtypes are being reported for the first time. We attribute this to our study combining multiple series and performing a more robust meta-analytic Cox regression modeling on the combined dataset, thus discovering 'hidden' associations. This methodology seems to yield new and interesting results and may be used as a tool to guide new research."
https://openalex.org/W649718113,"The quest for novel therapeutic targets in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is still ongoing. One of such targets, cyclin A1, was shown to be overexpressed in AML including AML stem cells. However, the function of cyclin A1 in AML is largely unknown, and the data on its impact on patients´ survival remain controversial. Therefore, we developed a transgenic mouse model of stem cell-directed inducible cyclin A1 overexpression and crossed these mice with PML-RARα-knockin mice, which develop an AML M3-like phenotype. To observe the effects of cyclin A1 loss-of-function, we also crossed PML-RARα-knockin mice to cyclin A1-knockout mice. Neither overexpression nor loss of cyclin A1 significantly altered leukemogenesis in PML-RARα-knockin mice. These findings imply that upregulation of cyclin A1 is not essential for leukemogenesis. Our data suggest that cyclin A1 does not represent a suitable target for AML therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1264685568,"In this paper, we describe a new restricted randomization method called run-reversal equilibrium (RRE), which is a Nash equilibrium of a game where (1) the clinical trial statistician chooses a sequence of medical treatments, and (2) clinical investigators make treatment predictions. RRE randomization counteracts how each investigator could observe treatment histories in order to forecast upcoming treatments. Computation of a run-reversal equilibrium reflects how the treatment history at a particular site is imperfectly correlated with the treatment imbalance for the overall trial. An attractive feature of RRE randomization is that treatment imbalance follows a random walk at each site, while treatment balance is tightly constrained and regularly restored for the overall trial. Less predictable and therefore more scientifically valid experiments can be facilitated by run-reversal equilibrium for multi-site clinical trials."
