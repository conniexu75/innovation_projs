Now, two studies suggest that the scope of mutations in human tumors extends to gene regulatory regions. In a study of 70 melanomas, Huang et al. (p. 957 , published online 24 January) found that 71% harbored one of two specific mutations in the promoter region of TERT , the gene coding for the catalytic subunit of telomerase, the enzyme that caps chromosome ends. Independently, Horn et al. (p. 959 , published online 24 January) identified a disease-segregating germline mutation in the TERT promoter in a family predisposed to melanoma and found additional TERT promoter mutations in a high percentage of sporadic melanomas and melanoma cell lines. The mutations in both studies generated new binding sites for specific transcription factors and, in reporter assays, caused an increase in transcription."

https://openalex.org/W2056262547,"Proton Still Too Small Despite a proton's tiny size, it is possible to measure its radius based on its charge or magnetization distributions. Traditional measurements of proton radius were based on the scattering between protons and electrons. Recently, a precision measurement of a line in the spectrum of muonium—an atom consisting of a proton and a muon, instead of an electron—revealed a radius inconsistent with that deduced from scattering studies. Antognini et al. (p. 417 ; see the Perspective by Margolis ) examined a different spectral line of muonium, with results less dependent on theoretical analyses, yet still inconsistent with the scattering result; in fact, the discrepancy increased."

The best ferroelectric properties are found in perovskites such as barium titanate (BTO) and lead zirconate titanate; however, environmentally friendly, lead-free alternatives are highly desirable. Fu et al. (p. 425 ; see the Perspective by Bonnell ) find that the organic molecular crystal diisopropylammonium bromide has ferroelectric properties comparable to those of BTO and may represent a viable alternative to perovskites."
https://openalex.org/W2000381516,"Genetic Clues to Meningioma Meningiomas are the most common primary brain tumors in adults. Located within the layer of tissue covering the brain, these tumors are usually slow-growing and benign but can cause serious neurological complications. About half of these tumors have mutations in the neurofibromin 2 gene ( NF2 ). To identify other genes that contribute to meningioma pathogenesis, Clark et al. (p. 1077 , published online 24 January) performed genome sequence analysis on 300 tumors. Meningiomas fell into two general classes: benign tumors located at the skull base—which tend to harbor mutations in the TRAF7, KLF4, AKT1 , and SMO genes—and higher-grade tumors located in the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres harbor mutations in NF2."
https://openalex.org/W2054115583,"Mitochondrial fission is fundamentally important to cellular physiology. The dynamin-related protein Drp1 mediates fission, and interaction between mitochondrion and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) enhances fission. However, the mechanism for Drp1 recruitment to mitochondria is unclear, although previous results implicate actin involvement. Here, we found that actin polymerization through ER-localized inverted formin 2 (INF2) was required for efficient mitochondrial fission in mammalian cells. INF2 functioned upstream of Drp1. Actin filaments appeared to accumulate between mitochondria and INF2-enriched ER membranes at constriction sites. Thus, INF2-induced actin filaments may drive initial mitochondrial constriction, which allows Drp1-driven secondary constriction. Because INF2 mutations can lead to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, our results provide a potential cellular mechanism for this disease state."
https://openalex.org/W2023368253,"Caspases are either apoptotic or inflammatory. Among inflammatory caspases, caspase-1 and -11 trigger pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death. Whereas both can be detrimental in inflammatory disease, only caspase-1 has an established protective role during infection. Here, we report that caspase-11 is required for innate immunity to cytosolic, but not vacuolar, bacteria. Although Salmonella typhimurium and Legionella pneumophila normally reside in the vacuole, specific mutants (sifA and sdhA, respectively) aberrantly enter the cytosol. These mutants triggered caspase-11, which enhanced clearance of S. typhimurium sifA in vivo. This response did not require NLRP3, NLRC4, or ASC inflammasome pathways. Burkholderia species that naturally invade the cytosol also triggered caspase-11, which protected mice from lethal challenge with B. thailandensis and B. pseudomallei. Thus, caspase-11 is critical for surviving exposure to ubiquitous environmental pathogens."

While these have been demonstrated for photons, carrying it over for electrons and the possibility of quantum electronic implementations has been challenging. Using two independent single-electron sources patterned into a two-dimensional electron gas, Bocquillon et al. (p. 1054 , published online 24 January; see the Perspective by Schönenberger ) performed single-electron interference experiments. The results demonstrate that the generated electrons can possess the desired properties for potential quantum applications."
https://openalex.org/W2029330932,"Cullin-RING ligases are multisubunit E3 ubiquitin ligases that recruit substrate-specific adaptors to catalyze protein ubiquitylation. Cul3-based Cullin-RING ligases are uniquely associated with BTB adaptors that incorporate homodimerization, Cul3 assembly, and substrate recognition into a single multidomain protein, of which the best known are BTB-BACK-Kelch domain proteins, including KEAP1. Cul3 assembly requires a BTB protein “3-box” motif, analogous to the F-box and SOCS box motifs of other Cullin-based E3s. To define the molecular basis for this assembly and the overall architecture of the E3, we determined the crystal structures of the BTB-BACK domains of KLHL11 both alone and in complex with Cul3, along with the Kelch domain structures of KLHL2 (Mayven), KLHL7, KLHL12, and KBTBD5. We show that Cul3 interaction is dependent on a unique N-terminal extension sequence that packs against the 3-box in a hydrophobic groove centrally located between the BTB and BACK domains. Deletion of this N-terminal region results in a 30-fold loss in affinity. The presented data offer a model for the quaternary assembly of this E3 class that supports the bivalent capture of Nrf2 and reveals potential new sites for E3 inhibitor design.

https://openalex.org/W1979526637,"The development of zeolite-like structures with extra-large pores (>12-membered rings, 12R) has been sporadic and is currently at 30R. In general, templating via molecules leads to crystalline frameworks, whereas the use of organized assemblies that permit much larger pores produces noncrystalline frameworks. Synthetic methods that generate crystallinity from both discrete templates and organized assemblies represent a viable design strategy for developing crystalline porous inorganic frameworks spanning the micro and meso regimes. We show that by integrating templating mechanisms for both zeolites and mesoporous silica in a single system, the channel size for gallium zincophosphites can be systematically tuned from 24R and 28R to 40R, 48R, 56R, 64R, and 72R. Although the materials have low thermal stability and retain their templating agents, single-activator doping of Mn(2+) can create white-light photoluminescence."

In contrast, purely organic compounds are rarely susceptible to incremental addition or removal of electrons without accompanying fragmentation or coupling reactions. Barnes et al. (p. 429 ; see the Perspective by Benniston ) report a catenane (a compound comprising interlocked rings) in which the topological structure stabilizes six different states that successively differ by the presence or absence of one or two electrons in the framework. The hepta-oxidized state proved remarkably resilient to oxygen exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2054915008,"Signaling pathways can induce different dynamics of transcription factor (TF) activation. We explored how TFs process signaling inputs to generate diverse dynamic responses. The budding yeast general stress-responsive TF Msn2 acted as a tunable signal processor that could track, filter, or integrate signals in an input-dependent manner. This tunable signal processing appears to originate from dual regulation of both nuclear import and export by phosphorylation, as mutants with one form of regulation sustained only one signal-processing function. Versatile signal processing by Msn2 is crucial for generating distinct dynamic responses to different natural stresses. Our findings reveal how complex signal-processing functions are integrated into a single molecule and provide a guide for the design of TFs with ""programmable"" signal-processing functions."

Plaçais and Preat (p. 440 ) investigated how the brain of Drosophila deals with severe resource limitation. The brain cut selected expenses to reduce the threat to survival and switched off the formation of aversive long-term memory that depends on costly protein synthesis. However, Hirano et al. (p. 443 ) focused on mild food-deprivation, which actually enhanced long-term memory formation. Presumably, improved memory should enhance survival when competing for limited food. After longer food deprivation, enhancement of aversive long-term memory decreased, while that of appetitive long-term memory remained high: Presumably, as starvation nears, it becomes more important to pursue food at all costs, and so appetitive memory takes precedence over aversive memories."
https://openalex.org/W2033212303,"Pondering Pulsars Pulsars are rapidly rotating, magnetized neutron stars that are powered by the loss of rotational energy. Because their emission is beamed, their light appears to pulse on and off at regular intervals. Changes in radio emission behavior have been observed for a number of pulsars, manifesting themselves as switches between ordered and disordered variations in intensity and pulse shapes, but these changes have not been seen at other wavelengths. Based on simultaneous radio and x-ray observations of pulsar PSR B0943+10, Hermsen et al. (p. 436 ) show that changes in emission state identified in radio measurements show counterpart fluctuations in the strength and temporal behavior of x-rays. Some of these changes were unexpected in their character and physical properties, challenging pulsar emission theories."

Over the past two decades a class of stellar outbursts emerged with luminosities between those of novae and supernovae—intermediate-luminosity red transients (ILRTs). Ivanova et al. (p. 433 ) propose that these ILRTs are the signature of common envelope events in which a lower-mass star in a close binary system is engulfed by matter transferred from its more massive and more evolved companion star."
https://openalex.org/W2080555616,"The capsaicinoids are a group of compounds produced by chili pepper fruits and are used widely in many fields, especially in medical purposes. The capsaicinoid biosynthetic pathway has not yet been established clearly. To understand more knowledge in biosynthesis of capsaicinoids, we applied RNA-seq for the mixture of placenta and pericarp of pungent pepper (Capsicum frutescens L.). We have assessed the effect of various assembly parameters using different assembly software, and obtained one of the best strategies for de novo assembly of transcriptome data. We obtained a total 54,045 high-quality unigenes (transcripts) using Trinity software. About 92.65% of unigenes showed similarity to the public protein sequences, genome of potato and tomato and pepper (C. annuum) ESTs databases. Our results predicted 3 new structural genes (DHAD, TD, PAT), which filled gaps of the capsaicinoid biosynthetic pathway predicted by Mazourek, and revealed new candidate genes involved in capsaicinoid biosynthesis based on KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analysis. A significant number of SSR (Simple Sequence Repeat) and SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) markers were predicted in C. frutescens and C. annuum sequences, which will be helpful in the identification of polymorphisms within chili pepper populations. These data will provide new insights to the pathway of capsaicinoid biosynthesis and subsequent research of chili peppers. In addition, our strategy of de novo transcriptome assembly is applicable to a wide range of similar studies."

https://openalex.org/W2017707375,"The development of adult-onset diseases is influenced by perinatal exposure to altered environmental conditions. One such exposure, bisphenol A (BPA), has been associated with obesity and diabetes, and consequently labeled an obesogen. Using an isogenic murine model, we examined the effects of perinatal exposure through maternal diet to 50 ng (n=20), 50 μg (n=21), or 50 mg (n=18) BPA/kg diet, as well as controls (n=20) on offspring energy expenditure, spontaneous activity, and body composition at 3, 6, and 9 mo of age, and hormone levels at 9 and 10 mo of age. Overall, exposed females and males exhibited increased energy expenditure (P<0.001 and 0.001, respectively) throughout the life course. In females, horizontal and vertical activity increased (P=0.07 and 0.06, respectively) throughout the life course. Generally, body composition measures were not different throughout the life course in exposed females or males (all P>0.44), although body fat and weight decreased in exposed females at particular ages (all P<0.08). Milligram-exposed females had improved glucose, insulin, adiponectin, and leptin profiles (all P<0.10). Thus, life-course analysis illustrates that BPA is associated with hyperactive and lean phenotypes. Variability across studies may be attributable to differential exposure duration and timing, dietary fat and phytoestrogen content, or lack of sophisticated phenotyping across the life course.—Anderson, O.S., Peterson, K.E., Sanchez, B.N., Zhang, Z., Mancuso, P., Dolinoy, D.C.

https://openalex.org/W2046692984,"Background Control of the global Tuberculosis (TB) burden is hindered by the lack of a simple and effective diagnostic test that can be utilized in resource-limited settings. Methods We evaluated the performance of Truenat MTB™, a chip-based nucleic acid amplification test in the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in clinical sputum specimens from 226 patients with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). The test involved sputum processing using Trueprep-MAG™ (nanoparticle-based protocol run on a battery-operated device) and real-time PCR performed on the Truelab Uno™ analyzer (handheld, battery-operated thermal cycler). Specimens were also examined for presence of MTB using smear microscopy, liquid culture and an in-house nested PCR protocol. Results were assessed in comparison to a composite reference standard (CRS) consisting of smear and culture results, clinical treatment and follow-up, and radiology findings. Results Based on the CRS, 191 patients had “Clinical-TB” (Definite and Probable-TB). Of which 154 patients are already on treatment, and 37 were treatment naïve cases. Remaining 35 were confirmed “Non-TB” cases which are treatment naïve cases. The Truenat MTB test was found to have sensitivity and specificity of 91.1% (CI: 86.1–94.7) and 100% (CI: 90.0–100) respectively, in comparison to 90.58% (CI: 85.5–94.3) and 91.43% (CI: 76.9–98.2) respectively for the in-house nested PCR protocol. Conclusion This preliminary study shows that the Truenat MTB test allows detection of TB in approximately one hour and can be utilized in near-care settings to provide quick and accurate diagnosis."

Previous in vitro studies have indicated that DMP1 might regulate the expression of DSPP during dentinogenesis. To examine whether DMP1 controls dentinogenesis through the regulation of DSPP in vivo, we cross-bred transgenic mice expressing normal DSPP driven by a 3.6-kb rat Col1a1 promoter with Dmp1 KO mice to generate mice expressing the DSPP transgene in the Dmp1 KO genetic background (referred to as “Dmp1 KO/DSPP Tg mice”). We used morphological, histological, and biochemical techniques to characterize the dentin and alveolar bone of Dmp1 KO/DSPP Tg mice compared with Dmp1 KO and wild-type mice. Our analyses showed that the expression of endogenous DSPP was remarkably reduced in the Dmp1 KO mice. Furthermore, the transgenic expression of DSPP rescued the tooth and alveolar bone defects of the Dmp1 KO mice. In addition, our in vitro analyses showed that DMP1 and its 57-kDa C-terminal fragment significantly up-regulated the Dspp promoter activities in a mesenchymal cell line. In contrast, the expression of DMP1 was not altered in the Dspp KO mice.

The human THAP9 gene is related to the Drosophila P-element transposase. Here, we show that human THAP9 can mobilize Drosophila P-elements in both Drosophila and human cells. Chimeric proteins formed between the Drosophila P-element transposase N-terminal THAP DNA binding domain and the C-terminal regions of human THAP9 can also mobilize Drosophila P elements. Our results indicate that human THAP9 is an active DNA transposase that, although ""domesticated,"" still retains the catalytic activity to mobilize P transposable elements across species."
https://openalex.org/W1995370257,"Bacterial pathogens need to acquire nutrients from the host, but for many nutrients their importance during infection remain poorly understood. We have investigated the importance of methionine acquisition and synthesis for Streptococcus pneumoniae growth and virulence using strains with gene deletions affecting a putative methionine ABC transporter lipoprotein (Sp_0149, metQ) and/or methionine biosynthesis enzymes (Sp_0585 - Sp_0586, metE and metF). Immunoblot analysis confirmed MetQ was a lipoprotein and present in all S. pneumoniae strains investigated. However, vaccination with MetQ did not prevent fatal S. pneumoniae infection in mice despite stimulating a strong specific IgG response. Tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry demonstrated that MetQ has both a high affinity and specificity for L-methionine with a KD of ∼25 nM, and a ΔmetQ strain had reduced uptake of C14-methionine. Growth of the ΔmetQ/ΔmetEF strain was greatly impaired in chemically defined medium containing low concentrations of methionine and in blood but was partially restored by addition of high concentrations of exogenous methionine. Mixed infection models showed no attenuation of the ΔmetQ, ΔmetEF and ΔmetQ/ΔmetEF strains in their ability to colonise the mouse nasopharnyx. In a mouse model of systemic infection although significant infection was established in all mice, there were reduced spleen bacterial CFU after infection with the ΔmetQ/ΔmetEF strain compared to the wild-type strain. These data demonstrate that Sp_0149 encodes a high affinity methionine ABC transporter lipoprotein and that Sp_0585 – Sp_0586 are likely to be required for methionine synthesis. Although Sp_0149 and Sp_0585-Sp_0586 make a contribution towards full virulence, neither was essential for S. pneumoniae survival during infection."

https://openalex.org/W2031021913,"Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNAs, play pivotal roles in stem cell biology. Methyl-CpG binding protein 1 (MBD1), an important epigenetic regulator of adult neurogenesis, controls the proliferation and differentiation of adult neural stem/progenitor cells (aNSCs). We recently demonstrated that MBD1 deficiency in aNSCs leads to altered expression of several noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs).Here we show that one of these miRNAs, miR-195, and MBD1 form a negative feedback loop. While MBD1 directly represses the expression of miR-195 in aNSCs, high levels of miR-195 in turn repress the expression of MBD1. Both gain-of-function and loss-of-function investigations show that alterations of the MBD1-miR-195 feedback loop tip the balance between aNSC proliferation and differentiation.Therefore the regulatory loop formed by MBD1 and miR-195 is an important component of the epigenetic network that controls aNSC fate."
https://openalex.org/W2142720988,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in children worldwide and can cause high mortality, especially in developing countries. However, information on the clinical and molecular characteristics of RSV infection in developing countries is limited. From April 2010 to May 2011, 1,082 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from children with ARI admitted to the Children's Hospital 2, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Samples were screened for RSV and genotyped by reverse transcription-PCR and sequencing. Demographic and clinical data was also recorded. RSV was found in 23.8% (257/1,082) of samples. RSV A was the dominant subgroup, accounting for 91.4% (235/257), followed by RSV B, 5.1% (13/257), and 9 cases (3.5%) were mixed infection of these subgroups. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that all group A strains belonged to the GA2 genotype. All group B strains belonged to the recently identified BA genotype, and further clustered into 2 recently described subgenotypes BA9 and BA10. One GA2 genotype strain had a premature stop codon which shortened the G protein length. RSV infection was significantly associated with younger age and higher severity score than those without. Co-infection with other viruses did not affect disease severity. RSV A caused more severe disease than RSV B. The results from this study will not only contribute to the growing database on the molecular diversity of RSV circulating worldwide but may be also useful in clinical management and vaccine development."

We hypothesized that those estimates might be inaccurate if the accuracy of the reference assays is not perfect. Here, we investigated this using statistical modeling.Data from a cohort study of 549 patients suspected of dengue infection presenting at Colombo North Teaching Hospital, Ragama, Sri Lanka, that described the application of our reference assay (a combination of Dengue IgM antibody capture ELISA and IgG antibody capture ELISA) and of three rapid diagnostic tests (Panbio NS1 antigen, IgM antibody and IgG antibody rapid immunochromatographic cassette tests) were re-evaluated using bayesian latent class models (LCMs). The estimated sensitivity and specificity of the reference assay were 62.0% and 99.6%, respectively. Prevalence of dengue infection (24.3%), and sensitivities and specificities of the Panbio NS1 (45.9% and 97.9%), IgM (54.5% and 95.5%) and IgG (62.1% and 84.5%) estimated by bayesian LCMs were significantly different from those estimated by assuming that the reference assay was perfect.

In our setting, the combination of NS1, IgM and IgG rapid diagnostic tests could be used on admission to rule out dengue infection with a high level of accuracy (NPV 95.2%). Further evaluation of rapid diagnostic tests for dengue infection should include the use of appropriate statistical models."
https://openalex.org/W2140636019,"Exposure to cyanide causes a spectrum of cardiac, neurological, and metabolic dysfunctions that can be fatal. Improved cyanide antidotes are needed, but the ideal biological pathways to target are not known. To understand better the metabolic effects of cyanide and to discover novel cyanide antidotes, we developed a zebrafish model of cyanide exposure and scaled it for high-throughput chemical screening. In a screen of 3120 small molecules, we discovered 4 novel antidotes that block cyanide toxicity. The most potent antidote was riboflavin. Metabolomic profiling of cyanide-treated zebrafish revealed changes in bile acid and purine metabolism, most notably by an increase in inosine levels. Riboflavin normalizes many of the cyanide-induced neurological and metabolic perturbations in zebrafish. The metabolic effects of cyanide observed in zebrafish were conserved in a rabbit model of cyanide toxicity. Further, humans treated with nitroprusside, a drug that releases nitric oxide and cyanide ions, display increased circulating bile acids and inosine. In summary, riboflavin may be a novel treatment for cyanide toxicity and prophylactic measure during nitroprusside treatment, inosine may serve as a biomarker of cyanide exposure, and metabolites in the bile acid and purine metabolism pathways may shed light on the pathways critical to reversing cyanide toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2013663401,"Background Impaired left ventricular (LV) function has been shown by strain rate (SR) imaging in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Our aim was to investigate global and regional, systolic and diastolic left atrial (LA) and right atrial (RA) longitudinal deformation in CAD using velocity vector imaging. Methods Echocardiographic and velocity vector imaging studies were performed in 20 patients with mild CAD, 40 patients with severe CAD and 25 controls. Maximal atrial volume, peak atrial longitudinal strain (εs) and SR during LV systole (SRs), SR during early LV filling (SRe) and late LV filling (SRa) were measured. Longitudinal strain during atrial contraction (εa) was obtained at the onset of P-wave on electrocardiography, and εa/εs was calculated. Results Longitudinal peak εs and SRs of LA showed decreased trend among CAD patients. The global and lateral LA SRe were prominently lower, while RA εa, SRa and εa/εs were prominently higher in 2 CAD groups than control group (P value <0.05). As compared with controls and patients with other single-vessel disease, LA SRa and εa/εs ratio were significantly increased among patients with exclusively left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) stenosis (SRa 1.14±0.38 s−1, 1.10±0.41 s−1, 1.45±0.46 s−1, P value<0.05; εa/εs 0.44±0.11, 0.44±0.20, 0.57±0.12, P value<0.01). Conclusions Apparently decreased SRe of LA and increased εa, SRa and εa/εs of RA were found in CAD patients with preserved LVEF and E/E' in gray zone. SRa and εa/εs of LA were found to significantly increase in those with LAD stenosis."

We found that the interaction between MukB, the bacterial condensin, and ParC, a subunit of topoisomerase IV, enhanced relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA and knotting by topoisomerase IV, which are intramolecular DNA rearrangements but not decatenation of multiply linked DNA dimers, which is an intermolecular DNA rearrangement required for proper segregation of daughter chromosomes. MukB DNA binding and a specific chiral arrangement of the DNA was required for topoisomerase IV stimulation because relaxation of positively supercoiled DNA was unaffected. This effect could be attributed to a more effective topological reconfiguration of the negatively supercoiled compared with positively supercoiled DNA by MukB.

https://openalex.org/W2070395533,"The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasing worldwide and diverse environmental and genetic risk factors are well recognized. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the calpain-10 gene (CAPN-10), which encodes a protein involved in the secretion and action of insulin, and chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) through drinking water have been independently associated with an increase in the risk for T2DM. In the present work we evaluated if CAPN-10 SNPs and iAs exposure jointly contribute to the outcome of T2DM. Insulin secretion (beta-cell function) and insulin sensitivity were evaluated indirectly through validated indexes (HOMA2) in subjects with and without T2DM who have been exposed to a gradient of iAs in their drinking water in northern Mexico. The results were analyzed taking into account the presence of the risk factor SNPs SNP-43 and -44 in CAPN-10. Subjects with T2DM had significantly lower beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity. An inverse association was found between beta-cell function and iAs exposure, the association being more pronounced in subjects with T2DM. Subjects without T2DM who were carriers of the at-risk genotype SNP-43 or -44, also had significantly lower beta-cell function. The association of SNP-43 with beta-cell function was dependent on iAs exposure, age, gender and BMI, whereas the association with SNP-44 was independent of all of these factors. Chronic exposure to iAs seems to be a risk factor for T2DM in humans through the reduction of beta-cell function, with an enhanced effect seen in the presence of the at-risk genotype of SNP-43 in CAPN-10. Carriers of CAPN-10 SNP-44 have also shown reduced beta-cell function."
https://openalex.org/W2006907839,"Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that has eluded characterization in terms of local abnormalities of brain activity, and is hypothesized to affect the collective, ""emergent"" working of the brain. Indeed, several recent publications have demonstrated that functional networks in the schizophrenic brain display disrupted topological properties. However, is it possible to explain such abnormalities just by alteration of local activation patterns? This work suggests a negative answer to this question, demonstrating that significant disruption of the topological and spatial structure of functional MRI networks in schizophrenia (a) cannot be explained by a disruption to area-based task-dependent responses, i.e. indeed relates to the emergent properties, (b) is global in nature, affecting most dramatically long-distance correlations, and (c) can be leveraged to achieve high classification accuracy (93%) when discriminating between schizophrenic vs control subjects based just on a single fMRI experiment using a simple auditory task. While the prior work on schizophrenia networks has been primarily focused on discovering statistically significant differences in network properties, this work extends the prior art by exploring the generalization (prediction) ability of network models for schizophrenia, which is not necessarily captured by such significance tests."

Chromatin is composed of repetitive units called nucleosomes that consist of DNA (147 base pairs) wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins (two subunits of each of the histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) (1Luger K. Richmond T.J. DNA binding within the nucleosome core.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 2Luger K. Hansen J.C. Nucleosome and chromatin fiber dynamics.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Posttranslational modifications of the N-terminal tails of histones affect chromatin structure, consequently serving as “histone marks” for transcriptional repression or activation (3Kouzarides T. Chromatin modifications and their function.Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8060) Google Scholar, 4Ruthenburg A.J. Li H. Patel D.J. Allis C.D. Multivalent engagement of chromatin modifications by linked binding modules.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). One important type of histone mark is histone methylation, which is regulated by specific sets of proteins that carry out the addition, removal, or specific binding of methyl groups (4Ruthenburg A.J. Li H. Patel D.J. Allis C.D. Multivalent engagement of chromatin modifications by linked binding modules.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). The MBT 3 domain-containing proteins bind to low methylated histones, functioning as the chromatin “readers,” and have been linked to development and tumor suppression by genetic analyses (5Bonasio R. Lecona E. Reinberg D. MBT domain proteins in development and disease.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2010; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The MBT domain was first reported in Drosophila dL3mbt (6Gateff E. Löffler T. Wismar J. A temperature-sensitive brain tumor suppressor mutation of Drosophila melanogaster.

Mutations in the MBT domain of dL3mbt caused malignant overgrowth in the larval brain, implicating a tumor suppressing function of dL3mbt and the importance of the MBT domain (6Gateff E. Löffler T.

In mammals, three different groups of MBT proteins have been identified, with hSCML2 and hSCMH1 containing two MBT domains; L3MBTL1, L3MBTL3, and L3MBTL4 containing three MBT domains; and L3MBTL2, SFMBT1, and SFMBT2 containing four MBT domains (5Bonasio R. Lecona E. Reinberg D. MBT domain proteins in development and disease.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2010; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The MBT proteins prevalently bind to mono- and dimethylated histone lysines in vitro and repress transcription via interaction with various repressors (5Bonasio R. Lecona E. Reinberg D. MBT domain proteins in development and disease.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2010; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Different MBT proteins have been identified in various protein complexes (5Bonasio R. Lecona E. Reinberg D. MBT domain proteins in development and disease.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2010; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), suggesting that MBT proteins have distinct functional activities and modes of action in regulating chromatin. In this study, we focused on a poorly characterized MBT protein, SFMBT1 (Scm-like with four mbt domains 1). Mammalian SFMBT1 contains four MBT repeat domains that are essential for mediating histone H3 N-terminal tail binding and transcriptional repression (8Wu S. Trievel R.C. Rice J.C. Human SFMBT is a transcriptional repressor protein that selectively binds the N-terminal tail of histone H3.FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3289-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, dSfmbt contains four MBT repeats and is a polycomb protein because dSfmbt knockout displays a classic polycomb phenotype with strong and widespread derepression of HOX genes (9Klymenko T. Papp B. Fischle W. Köcher T. Schelder M. Fritsch C. Wild B. Wilm M. MÜller J. A Polycomb group protein complex with sequence-specific DNA-binding and selective methyl-lysine-binding activities.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1110-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). dSfmbt is part of the Pho repressive complex, which contains the DNA-binding protein Pho and recruits other polycomb proteins, mediating H3K27me3 for transcriptional silencing at target loci (10Simon J.A. Kingston R.E. Mechanisms of polycomb gene silencing. Knowns and unknowns.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 697-708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MBT repeat domain of dSfmbt preferentially binds to mono- or dimethylated lysine containing histone peptides (11Grimm C. Matos R. Ly-Hartig N. Steuerwald U. Lindner D. Rybin V. MÜller J. MÜller C.W. Molecular recognition of histone lysine methylation by the Polycomb group repressor dSfmbt.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1965-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although SFMBT1 was considered as a mammalian homologue for Drosophila dSfmbt in the literature, mammalian SFMBT1 and dSfmbt are probably not homologues, and SFMBT1 is likely unique to mammals on the basis of the following evidence: 1) SFMBT1 was not found in the mammalian Pho homolog YY1 protein complex in mammalian cells (12Wu S. Shi Y. Mulligan P. Gay F. Landry J. Liu H. Lu J. Qi H.H. Wang W. Nickoloff J.A. Wu C. Shi Y. A YY1-INO80 complex regulates genomic stability through homologous recombination-based repair.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar); 2) human SFMBT1 binds selectively with the N-terminal tail of histone H3 in a manner that appears to be independent of histone modification (8Wu S. Trievel R.C. Rice J.C. Human SFMBT is a transcriptional repressor protein that selectively binds the N-terminal tail of histone H3.FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3289-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); and 3) SFMBT1 belongs to a different branch from dSfmbt on the basis of evolutionary relationship and domain organizations (5Bonasio R. Lecona E. Reinberg D. MBT domain proteins in development and disease.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2010; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Therefore, alternative mechanisms might account for the role of mammalian SFMBT1 in transcriptional regulation, and SFMBT1 might have unique functions. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying SFMBT1 transcriptional repression as well as its biological functions are unknown. To gain unbiased biochemical insights into how SFMBT1 exerts its transcription repressor function, we performed affinity purification and MS analysis of the SFMBT1 protein complex. Our data revealed a novel biochemical connection of SFMBT1 with CtBP/LSD1/HDAC complexes, polycomb protein complexes (PRC), and other MBT proteins, suggesting functional cooperation of these corepressor proteins in establishing repressive chromatin states. We subsequently utilized a skeletal myogenesis model to investigate the biological functions of Sfmbt1 because epigenetic regulation has critical roles in the highly regulated myogenic process. Through gain of function and loss of function studies in combination with gene expression profiling studies, we found that Sfmbt1 critically regulates the myogenic programs through transcriptional silencing of the master regulator of myogenic process, MyoD. pLKO.1-based lentiviral shRNA plasmids targeting mouse Sfmbt1 and MyoD genes were purchased from Open Biosystems. Human SFMBT1 truncation mutants (N: 1–473 aa, M: 494–699 aa, and C: 721–866 aa) were cloned to the pGex vector to generate GST fusion proteins. GFP-SFMBT1 was generated with the pEGFP-C3 vector. pQCXIP-FLAG-SFMBT1 was described previously (8Wu S. Trievel R.C. Rice J.C.

C2C12 cells (ATCC) were cultured in DMEM with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Primary myoblasts were isolated and maintained as described previously (16Springer M.L. Rando T.A. Blau H.M. Gene delivery to muscle.Curr. Protoc. Hum. Genet. 2002; 13: 13.4.1-13.4.19Google Scholar). Briefly, limb muscles from newborn mice were minced and then digested with collagenase/dispase at 37 °C for 30 min. The dissociated cells were collected and cultured in a collagen-coated dish with F-10-based primary myoblast selective growth medium (Ham F-10 nutrient mixture supplied with 20% FBS, 2.5 ng/ml bFGF/ml, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). To selectively enrich myoblasts, myoblasts were physically dissociated from the culture dish during splitting, whereas the majority of fibroblasts remained attached. To further exclude the easily attaching fibroblasts, the dissociated cells were preplated to a fresh dish for 15 min, and then the unattached myoblasts were collected and cultured in a new dish. The selection process was repeated until a high purity of myoblasts was attained. For the myogenesis assay, myoblasts were grown to 80–90% confluence and induced for differentiation by switching from growth medium to differentiation medium (DMEM containing 2% horse serum). The detailed purification procedure was described previously (17Ogawa H. Ishiguro K. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Nakatani Y. A complex with chromatin modifiers that occupies E2F- and Myc-responsive genes in G0 cells.Science. 2002; 296: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts were prepared from 293T cells stably transduced with FLAG-SFMBT1. FLAG-SFMBT1 protein complexes were then purified using anti-FLAG M2 mAb-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma). After extensive washing, protein complexes were eluted using the elution buffer containing 50 μg/ml FLAG peptides at room temperature for 30 min. The eluted protein samples were separated on 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-tris gels (Invitrogen) and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The procedures for Western blotting and immunoprecipitation studies were described previously (18Wu L. Aster J.C. Blacklow S.C. Lake R. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Griffin J.D. MAML1, a human homologue of Drosophila mastermind, is a transcriptional co-activator for NOTCH receptors.Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Viral production and transduction in cells was described previously (19Shen H. McElhinny A.S. Cao Y. Gao P. Liu J. Bronson R. Griffin J.D. Wu L.

Stably transduced cells (polyclonal) were obtained and maintained by puromycin selection. To prepare concentrated viruses, supernatants containing lentiviruses were centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C using a SW28 rotor (Beckman). The pellets were suspended with PBS, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. The viral titers were determined following a procedure provided by Open Biosystems. Immunofluorescence staining and luciferase reporter assays were performed as described previously (18Wu L. Aster J.C. Blacklow S.C. Lake R. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Griffin J.D. MAML1, a human homologue of Drosophila mastermind, is a transcriptional co-activator for NOTCH receptors.Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Microarray experiments were performed using RNA isolated from the C2C12 scramble shRNA control and C2C12 Sfmbt1 knockdown. The total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen) and purified using a Qiagen column with in-column DNase digestion. Hybridizations of Affymetrix mouse genome 430 2.0 arrays were performed at the Dana Farber Microarray core facility. The data were preprocessed and analyzed using dChip software. To reduce the false positives, probe sets defined as “Absent” detection calls crossing all samples were removed from the data analysis. Genes with a fold change ≥ 1.5 and p < 0.05 were considered differentially expressed. GST pull-down assays were performed as described previously (18Wu L. Aster J.C. Blacklow S.C. Lake R. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Griffin J.D. MAML1, a human homologue of Drosophila mastermind, is a transcriptional co-activator for NOTCH receptors.Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacterially expressed GST or GST-SFMBT1 fusion proteins were induced and purified with glutathione-Sepharose. Equivalent amounts of GST or GST-SFMBT1 immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose were then incubated with a nuclear extract of 293T transfected with HA-MyoD. After extensive washing, the pull-down HA-MyoD was detected by Western blot analysis. cDNA was generated with 2 μg of total RNA using a GeneAmp RNA PCR kit (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR was performed using the StepOneTM real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) with the SYBR Green PCR core reagents kit (Applied Biosystems). The sequences for the primers used are listed in supplemental Table S1. ChIP assays were performed as described previously (20Gu Y. Lin S. Li J.L. Nakagawa H. Chen Z. Jin B. Tian L. Ucar D.A. Shen H. Lu J. Hochwald S.N. Kaye F.J. Wu L. Altered LKB1/CREB-regulated transcription co-activator (CRTC) signaling axis promotes esophageal cancer cell migration and invasion.Oncogene. 2012; 31: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature to cross-link the DNA to chromatin-associated protein complexes. The cross-linking was stopped with glycine, and cells were then collected and sonicated with a MISONIX S-4000 sonicator to shear DNA to lengths between 200 and 800 bp. The DNA-protein complexes were then immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies and washed extensively. The ChIP DNA was then purified and eluted with 100 μl of H2O. A total of 2.5 μl of ChIP DNA was used for real-time PCR analysis. The primer sequences are listed in supplemental Table S1. A DNase I sensitivity assay was performed with RQ1 RNase-free DNse (Promega). Nuclei of 5 × 105 cells were treated with DNase at 37 °C for 30 min, and then the reactions were stopped with EDTA at a final concentration of 25 mm. Genomic DNA samples were purified by protease K digestion and phenol chloroform extraction. The purified DNA samples were analyzed by real-time PCR to measure the relative amount of uncut DNA around the promoter region of Myogenin. An independent Student's t test was used to analyze data from various experiments. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying transcriptional repression function of SFMBT1, we performed a proteomic analysis to identify SFMBT1-interacting partners in mammalian cells. The SFMBT1 protein complex was immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG beads from nuclear extracts of FLAG-SFMBT1-expressing 293T cells followed by elution with FLAG peptides. The SFMBT1-associated proteins were next separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A) and subjected to MS analysis. We found that SFMBT1-associated proteins consist of distinct transcriptional corepressors, including 17 components of the CtBP/LSD1/HDAC protein complex, 11 members of PRC, and four MBT proteins (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1). We further validated the interaction of SFMBT1 with these corepressors identified from our MS analysis. As shown in Fig. 1C, we performed immunoprecipitation of FLAG-SFMBT1 followed by Western blotting and validated that LSD1 core complex components, including LSD1, CoREST, BHC80, HDAC1, and HDAC2, were present in SFMBT1 immunoprecipitates. Using similar assays, we observed that SFMBT1 interacted with PRC1 proteins PHC1 and RNF2 but not with PRC2 members EZH2 and SUZ12 (Fig. 1D), which is consistent with our MS data (B). Because our MS data also indicated an interaction between SFMBT1 and L3MBTL3, we performed coimmunoprecipitation and detected an interaction between GFP-SFMBT1 and FLAG-L3MBTL3 in mammalian cells (Fig. 1E). Also, consistent with our MS data, we failed to detect SFMBT1 interaction with SMRT/HDAC3 corepressors (Fig. 1F). Therefore, we identified the biochemical components of the SFMBT1 protein complex, which suggest that SFMBT1 mediates transcriptional repression via interactions with multiple transcriptional repression complexes. The biological functions of SFMBT1 are unknown. Previous observations that mouse Sfmbt1 is expressed in skeletal muscles (21Usui H. Ichikawa T. Kobayashi K. Kumanishi T.

To investigate the function of Sfmbt1 in myogenesis, we utilized the C2C12 myoblast differentiation model and first investigated the pattern of Sfmbt1 expression during myogenic differentiation. We found that the Sfmbt1 transcript level was highest in undifferentiated myoblasts and reduced during the course of differentiation (Fig. 2A). Thus, these data suggest a possible role for Sfmbt1 in repressing myogenic differentiation. We next investigated the respective functional consequences of SFMBT1 overexpression and Sfmbt1 depletion on myoblast proliferation and differentiation. First, C2C12 myoblasts were transduced with human FLAG-SFMBT1 retroviruses or empty vector control viruses followed by puromycin selection. SFMBT1 expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2B). The transduced C2C12 myoblasts were induced to differentiate, and myotube formation and muscle-specific gene expression were then examined various days after differentiation. We found that ectopic SFMBT1 expression resulted in a block in myotube formation (Fig. 2C) and a decrease in expression of muscle differentiation markers (myosin and Myogenin) (D). Ectopic SFMBT1 expression appeared to have little effect on the proliferation of undifferentiated myoblasts in growth medium (Fig. 2E). Thus, SFMBT1 represses myogenic differentiation, likely contributing to the maintenance of undifferentiated states of myoblasts. Next, we knocked down Sfmbt1 expression in C2C12 myoblasts using lentiviral-mediated shRNA targeting Sfmbt1 (shSfmbt1) or scrambled shRNA as a control (Fig. 3A). When induced for differentiation, Sfmbt1 knockdown cells displayed a more differentiated phenotype than control cells, as shown by the formation of larger and more myotubes (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S2) and earlier and more robust expression of myogenic transcription factor Myogenin and muscle gene Myosin (Fig. 3C). Moreover, Sfmbt1 knockdown significantly reduced the proliferation rate of C2C12 myoblasts cultured in growth medium (Fig. 3D). The shRNA knockdown effects were specific, as we observed similar effects with an independent shRNA construct targeting a different region of Sfmbt1 (supplemental Fig. S3). Importantly, we found that Sfmbt1 knockdown promoted differentiation and reduced proliferation of primary mouse myoblasts (Fig. 3, E–H, and supplemental Fig. S2). Therefore, our gain of function and loss of function studies (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3) strongly indicate that Sfmbt1 is required for proper proliferation of myogenic progenitor cells and prevention of premature differentiation. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying Sfmbt1 regulation of myogenesis, we examined Sfmbt1-regulated genes in undifferentiated myoblasts. We performed a microarray analysis to compare gene expression between proliferating Sfmbt1 knockdown and control cells and identified a total of 206 up-regulated genes and 307 down-regulated genes with the criteria of fold change ≥ 1.5 and p < 0.05 (Fig. 4A and supplemental Table S2, S3). The up-regulated genes with highest fold changes in Sfmbt1 knockdown cells were numerous muscle differentiation genes whose expression is normally repressed in proliferating, undifferentiated muscle progenitors. These genes included muscle transcription factors, Myogenin and Mef2C, and many myofibrillar genes such as troponin, Tnnc, Tnnt, Tnni, Myosin light and heavy chains, and α-actin. Elevated expression levels of several typical muscle genes such as Myogenin (myog), Mef2c, Myh3, Mylpf, Gas2, and Tnnc2 in Sfmbt1 knockdown cells were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, expression of the muscle stem cell factors Bmi1 (26Robson L.G. Di Foggia V. Radunovic A. Bird K. Zhang X. Marino S. Bmi1 is expressed in postnatal myogenic satellite cells, controls their maintenance and plays an essential role in repeated muscle regeneration.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e27116Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and Nestin (27Day K.

Our findings thus support that Sfmbt1 critically confers transcriptional silencing of muscle genes in myogenic progenitor cells. The myogenic transcription factor MyoD is associated with transcriptional corepressors to repress MyoD-mediated transcription in undifferentiated myogenic progenitors (25Aziz A. Liu Q.C. Dilworth F.J. Regulating a master regulator: establishing tissue-specific gene expression in skeletal muscle.Epigenetics. 2010; 5: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Because Sfmbt1 depletion resulted in enhanced expression of important MyoD target genes such as Myogenin and Mef2c in myoblasts, we investigated a possible interaction between Sfmbt1 and MyoD. We compared the Sfmbt1 target gene set from our microarray data with the published MyoD ChIP-Sequence gene set (28Cao Y. Yao Z. Sarkar D. Lawrence M. Sanchez G.J. Parker M.H. MacQuarrie K.L.

Theories based on some form of cellular bistability, however, do not seem able to account for the fact that noisy neurons can collectively store information in a robust manner. We show how a sufficiently clustered network of simple model neurons can be instantly induced into metastable states capable of retaining information for a short time (a few seconds). The mechanism is robust to different network topologies and kinds of neural model. This could constitute a viable means available to the brain for sensory and/or short-term memory with no need of synaptic learning. Relevant phenomena described by neurobiology and psychology, such as local synchronization of synaptic inputs and power-law statistics of forgetting avalanches, emerge naturally from this mechanism, and we suggest possible experiments to test its viability in more biological settings."
https://openalex.org/W2161767206,"Context The last decade witnessed growing differences in abortion dynamics in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine despite demographic, social, and historical similarities of these nations. This paper investigates changes in birth control practices in the three countries and searches for an explanation of the diverging trends in abortion. Methods Official abortion and contraceptive use statistics, provided by national statistical agencies, were analysed. Respective laws and other legal documents were examined and compared between the three countries. To disclose inter-country differences in prevalence of the modern methods of contraception and its association with major demographic and social factors, an analysis of data from national sample surveys was performed, including binary logistic regression. Results The growing gap in abortion rate in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine is a genuine phenomenon, not a statistical artefact. The examination of abortion and prevalence of contraception based on official statistics and three national sample surveys did not reveal any unambiguous factors that could explain differences in abortion dynamics in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. However, it is very likely that the cause of the inter-country discrepancies lies in contraceptive behavior itself, in adequacies of contraceptive knowledge and practices. Additionally, large differences in government policies, which are very important in shaping contraceptive practices of the population, were detected. Conclusion Since the end of the 1990s, the Russian government switched to archaic ideology in the area of reproductive health and family planning and neglects evidence-based arguments. Such an extreme turn in the governmental position is not observed in Belarus or Ukraine. This is an important factor contributing to the slowdown in the decrease of abortion rates in Russia."

The principal component of this binding site is contributed by an α subunit, and it binds the cationic moiety of the nicotinic pharmacophore. The other part of the pharmacophore, a hydrogen bond acceptor, has recently been shown to bind to the complementary non-α subunit via the backbone NH of a conserved Leu. This interaction was predicted by studies of ACh-binding proteins and confirmed by functional studies of the neuronal (CNS) nAChR, α4β2. The ACh-binding protein structures further suggested that the hydrogen bond to the backbone NH is mediated by a water molecule and that a second hydrogen bonding interaction occurs between the water molecule and the backbone CO of a conserved Asn, also on the non-α subunit. Here, we provide new insights into the nature of the interactions between the hydrogen bond acceptor of nicotinic agonists and the complementary subunit backbone. We studied both the nAChR of the neuromuscular junction (muscle-type) and a neuronal subtype, (α4)2(β4)3.

https://openalex.org/W2163456856,"The gut microbiota is implicated in host metabolism and energy regulation. Germ-free (GF) C57BL/6 mice display decreased adiposity, an effect associated with increased intestinal fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF) and decreased hepatic lipogenesis. However, whether the altered metabolism observed in the absence of gut microbiota extends to other species, commonly used to examine energy metabolism, is unknown. Thus, we used the GF Fischer 344 rat to examine adiposity and associated alterations in intestinal nutrient chemoreceptors, gut peptide levels, and FIAF expression, as well as markers of hepatic and adipose lipogenesis and adipogenesis. We found that GF rats displayed similar body weights and adiposity relative to controls. GF state was associated with up-regulation of intestinal and hepatic FIAF, decreased expression of hepatic FAS, ACC-1, and SREBP, and increased pAMPK and pACC. However, GF rats displayed reduced adipocyte FIAF, increased lipogenic enzymes, and decreased pAMPK, accompanied by an increase in adipocyte size. These findings show that, despite increased intestinal FIAF and reduced hepatic lipogenesis, adiposity is preserved in the Fisher 344 GF rat, unlike the C57Bl/6J GF mouse, with a shift in increased adipocyte lipogenesis. This also demonstrates that adipose, rather than intestinal, FIAF may have a more prominent role in adiposity."
https://openalex.org/W2040319454,"The removal of initiating primers from the 5'-ends of each Okazaki fragment, required for the generation of contiguous daughter strands, can be catalyzed by the combined action of DNA polymerase δ and Fen1. When the flaps generated by displacement of DNA synthesis activity of polymerase δ become long enough to bind replication protein A or form hairpin structures, the helicase/endonuclease enzyme, Dna2, becomes critical because of its ability to remove replication protein A-coated or secondary structure flaps. In this study, we show that the N-terminal 45-kDa domain of Dna2 binds hairpin structures, allowing the enzyme to target secondary structure flap DNA. We found that this activity was essential for the efficient removal of hairpin flaps by the endonuclease activity of Dna2 with the aid of its helicase activity. Thus, the efficient removal of hairpin structure flaps requires the coordinated action of all three functional domains of Dna2. We also found that deletion of the N-terminal 45-kDa domain of Dna2 led to a partial loss of the intra-S-phase checkpoint function and an increased rate of homologous recombination in yeast. We discuss the potential roles of the N-terminal domain of Dna2 in the maintenance of genomic stability."
https://openalex.org/W1998852308,"Adiponectin, an abundant adipose tissue-derived protein, exerts protective effect against cardiovascular disease. Adiponectin receptors (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) mediate the beneficial effects of adiponectin on the cardiovascular system. However, the alteration of AdipoRs in cardiac remodeling is not fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the effect of angiotensin II (AngII) on cardiac AdipoRs expression and explored the possible molecular mechanism. AngII infusion into rats induced cardiac hypertrophy, reduced AdipoR1 but not AdipoR2 expression, and attenuated the phosphorylations of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase, and those effects were all reversed by losartan, an AngII type 1 (AT1) receptor blocker. AngII reduced expression of AdipoR1 mRNA and protein in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, which was abolished by losartan, but not by PD123319, an AT2 receptor antagonist. The antioxidants including reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger NAC, NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin, Nox2 inhibitor peptide gp91 ds-tat, and mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I inhibitor rotenone attenuated AngII-induced production of ROS and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2. AngII-reduced AdipoR1 expression was reversed by pretreatment with NAC, apocynin, gp91 ds-tat, rotenone, and an ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that AngII provoked the recruitment of c-Myc onto the promoter region of AdipoR1, which was attenuated by PD98059. Moreover, AngII-induced DNA binding activity of c-Myc was inhibited by losartan, NAC, apocynin, gp91 ds-tat, rotenone, and PD98059. c-Myc small interfering RNA abolished the inhibitory effect of AngII on AdipoR1 expression. Our results suggest that AngII inhibits cardiac AdipoR1 expression in vivo and in vitro and AT1 receptor/ROS/ERK1/2/c-Myc pathway is required for the downregulation of AdipoR1 induced by AngII."
https://openalex.org/W2027835934,"MeCP2 is an abundant methyl-cytosine-guanine (CG)-binding protein and transcriptional repressor. We developed a biochemical system that exhibits CG methylation-specific transcriptional repression by purified human MeCP2. MeCP2 represses transcription by histone deacetylase (HDAC)-dependent and HDAC-independent mechanisms. Our system appears to recreate the HDAC-independent component of MeCP2-mediated repression and occurs via inhibition of the assembly of transcription preinitiation complexes. At a ratio of approximately one molecule of MeCP2 per two methyl-CG dinucleotides, as found in mammalian neurons, the magnitude of methylation-specific repression was greater than 10-fold. Notably, the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A had no effect on MeCP2-mediated repression with either naked DNA or chromatin templates. We designed a CG-deficient core promoter that is resistant to MeCP2-mediated repression when placed in a plasmid lacking CG dinucleotides. By using this CG-deficient reporter as a reference, we found that eight CG dinucleotides in the core promoter region are sufficient for strong methylation-specific repression by MeCP2. In contrast, MeCP2 does not repress a construct with 13 CG dinucleotides located ∼1.7 kbp upstream of the promoter. Furthermore, by analysis of C-terminally truncated MeCP2 proteins, we found that binding of MeCP2 to methyl-CG dinucleotides is not sufficient for transcriptional repression. Hence, MeCP2-mediated repression is not due to the simple steric blockage of the transcriptional machinery. These experiments suggest that MeCP2 can function as a global methyl-CG-specific, HDAC-independent repressor. This HDAC-independent mechanism of MeCP2-mediated repression may be important in cells, such as mammalian neurons, that have high levels of CG methylation and MeCP2."
https://openalex.org/W2017702993,"In a typical experiment on decision making, one out of two possible stimuli is displayed and observers decide which one was presented. Recently, Stanford and colleagues (2010) introduced a new variant of this classical one-stimulus presentation paradigm to investigate the speed of decision making. They found evidence for ""perceptual decision making in less than 30 ms"". Here, we extended this one-stimulus compelled-response paradigm to a two-stimulus compelled-response paradigm in which a vernier was followed immediately by a second vernier with opposite offset direction. The two verniers and their offsets fuse. Only one vernier is perceived. When observers are asked to indicate the offset direction of the fused vernier, the offset of the second vernier dominates perception. Even for long vernier durations, the second vernier dominates decisions indicating that decision making can take substantial time. In accordance with previous studies, we suggest that our results are best explained with a two-stage model of decision making where a leaky evidence integration stage precedes a race-to-threshold process."

The existing generic classification includes three genera consisting of brachypterous species, with all other species placed in the genus Archiborborus. We present the first phylogenetic hypothesis for the subfamily based on morphological, molecular, and combined datasets. Morphological data include 53 characters and cover all valid described taxa (33 species in 4 genera) in the subfamily, as well as 83 undescribed species. Molecular data for five genes (mitochondrial 12S rDNA, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, and cytochrome B, and nuclear alanyl-tRNA synthetase and 28S rDNA) were obtained for 21 ingroup taxa. Data support the separation of the Archiborborinae from the Copromyzinae, with which they were formerly combined. Analyses support consistent groups within the subfamily, but relationships between groups are poorly resolved. The validity of the brachypterous genera Penola Richards and Frutillaria Richards is supported. The former genus Archiborborus Duda is paraphyletic, and will be divided into monophyletic genera on the basis of this work. Aptery and brachyptery have evolved multiple times in the subfamily. Antrops Enderlein, previously including a single brachypterous species, is a senior synonym of Archiborborus."

In this study, we have identified topoisomerase IIβ (Top2β) as a specific determinant for CPT sensitivity, but not for many other cytotoxic agents, in non-S-phase cells.

Camptothecin (CPT), a Top1-targeting drug, can interfere with the catalytic cycle of Top1 by inhibiting the religation reaction and therefore increases the half-life of the transient Top1-DNA covalent adducts (also known as Top1 cleavage complexes) (1.Champoux J.J.

Topoisomerase I inhibitors: camptothecins and beyond.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar). The Top1 cleavage complex itself is highly reversible, and the single strand nick within the complex is concealed by the covalently linked Top1 protein and thus remains undetected in the absence of cellular processing. The two major intracellular helix-tracking processes, DNA replication and transcription, have been implicated in eliciting DNA damage response upon CPT treatment (21.Desai S.D. Zhang H.

Tumor cell death induced by topoisomerase-targeting drugs.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 53-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the collision of Top1 cleavage complexes with DNA replication machineries and the subsequently generated DNA double strand breaks are responsible for the S-phase-specific cytotoxicity of CPT (22.Hsiang Y.H.

Slowly growing cells are more resistant to CPT treatment, possibly due to the reduced replication-mediated Top1 cleavage complex processing (25.D'Arpa P. Beardmore C. Liu L.F. Involvement of nucleic acid synthesis in cell killing mechanisms of topoisomerase poisons.Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6919-6924PubMed Google Scholar). This S-phase-selective cytotoxicity enables Top1-based chemotherapy to be efficacious in treating several types of cancers, including ovarian, lung, and colon cancers (20.Pommier Y.

It has been shown that in the absence of DNA replication, DNA single strand breaks are generated upon proteasomal degradation of Top1 that is covalently trapped on DNA in the presence of CPT (23.Lin C.P. Ban Y. Lyu Y.L. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. A ubiquitin-proteasome pathway for the repair of topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complexes.J. Biol.

In addition to proteasome, repair of Top1 cleavage complexes also involves tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase (Tdp1) that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the tyrosyl-3′-phosphate linkage between a protein (peptide) and DNA (28.El-Khamisy S.F.

It has been shown that either the inhibition of proteasome or a mutation in Tdp1 can enhance CPT sensitivity (27.Desai S.D. Li T.K. Rodriguez-Bauman A. Rubin E.H. Liu L.F.

SCAN1 mutant Tdp1 accumulates the enzyme–DNA intermediate and causes camptothecin hypersensitivity.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2224-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The predominant single strand breaks generated upon CPT treatment in non-S-phase cells can largely explain the fact that non-S-phase or postmitotic cells are generally much more resistant to CPT. Other than the involvement of various repair pathways, it remains unclear how CPT sensitivity is determined in the absence of DNA replication. In this study, we observed that Top2β deficiency could increase CPT cytotoxicity in quiescent Top2β-deficient (Top2β−/−) as well as ICRF-187-treated wild-type (Top2β+/+) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The increased sensitivity is associated with the depletion of RNA polymerase II large subunit (RNAP LS), p53 accumulation, general transcription inhibition, and apoptosis induction. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), VP-16 (etoposide), CPT (camptothecin), TPT (topotecan), ICRF-187, bleomycin, staurosporine, and cisplatin were purchased from Sigma.

Tritium-labeled UTP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Top2β+/+ and Top2β−/− primary MEFs were isolated from E13.5 mouse embryos as described previously (35.Zhang A. Lyu Y.L. Lin C.P. Zhou N. Azarova A.M. Wood L.M. Liu L.F. A protease pathway for the repair of topoisomerase II-DNA covalent complexes.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35997-36003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). MEFs were cultured in DMEM containing 10% serum (FetalPlex animal serum complex, Gemini Bio-Products), l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml) in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For all experiments, 24 h after plating in 10% serum-containing DMEM, MEFs were cultured for another 24 h in 0.2% serum-containing DMEM before various drug treatments. For MTT cytotoxicity assays, primary MEFs were plated in 96-well plates (1.0 × 104 cells/well) for 24 h followed by culturing in DMEM supplemented with 0.2% serum for another 24 h. Cells were then treated continuously with various doses of different drugs for 4 days. At the end of drug treatments, 30 μl of MTT (1 μg/ml) was added, and cells were further incubated for 4 h in the humidified CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Upon removal of media, 150 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to each well, and the absorbance at 570 nm was determined for each well using a microplate reader. All assays were performed at least twice in triplicate. Primary MEFs cultured in 6-well plates were treated with DMSO (0.1%), CPT, or VP-16 for various times. At the end of the treatment, cells were harvested from tissue culture plates using 0.25% trypsin, 2.21 mm EDTA. After washing once with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were subjected to staining by annexin V using the annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit I (BD Biosciences) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were resuspended in 100 μl of 1× annexin V binding buffer, followed by a 15-min staining in the dark with FITC-conjugated annexin V for the detection of phosphatidylserine flipping and propidium iodine for the determination of membrane integrity. Then, an additional 400 μl of 1× annexin V binding buffer was added to each reaction immediately before the flow cytometry analysis. 2.5 × 105 primary Top2β+/+ and Top2β−/− MEFs were treated with 0, 1, or 10 μm CPT for 20 min. Cells were lysed immediately following CPT treatment upon aspirating CPT-containing DMEM tissue culture media using the 3× SDS sample buffer (175 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 15% glycerol, 5% SDS, 300 mm dithiothreitol, 0.006% bromphenol blue). Cell lysates were then analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Top1 and anti-α-tubulin antibodies. To determine the level of DNA synthesis in Top2β+/+ and Top2β−/− primary MEFs, 6 × 105 cells were plated in 60-mm tissue culture plates, and 24 h later, cells were pulse-labeled with EdU (10 μm) for 1 h. For measuring EdU incorporation in quiescent MEFs, 24 h after plating, MEFs were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 0.2% serum for an additional 24 h before pulse-labeling with EdU. Cells were harvested from tissue culture plates by incubating in 0.25% trypsin, 2.21 mm EDTA and subsequently washed once with ice-cold 1× PBS. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in 0.1 ml of cold 1× PBS, 0.1% glucose solution and immediately fixed by adding 1 ml of ice-cold 70% ethanol, and the fixation reaction was incubated in 4 °C for 1 h. Fixed cells were then subjected to the Click-iT reaction to reveal the incorporated EdU in newly synthesized DNA as described in the manufacturer's manual (Click-iT® EdU Alexa Fluor® 488 flow cytometry assay kit, Invitrogen). Cells were then treated with RNase A followed by DNA staining with 7-aminoactinomycin D (7AAD) for 1 h at 37 °C. Both DNA content and EdU incorporation were scored using the flow cytometry analysis. At the end of each treatment, primary MEFs were subjected to pulse labeling for 6 h with 5 μCi of [5,6-3H]uridine (47 Ci/mmol; ICN)/ml. Following uridine labeling, cells were lysed with a solution containing 4 m isothioguanidine, 0.5% Sarkosyl, 2 mm sodium citrate, and 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol. Cell lysates were then directly spotted onto separate DE81 DEAE-cellulose filter papers. Filters were washed three times (30 min each) with 0.3 m ammonium formate followed by a single ethanol wash (10 min). Filters were then dried, and the amount of uridine present on individual filters was determined using a Beckman liquid scintillation counter following standard procedures. At the end of each treatment, primary MEFs were subjected to pulse abeling with 0.5 mm EU for 6 h. Following the EU labeling, cells were trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin, 2.21 mm EDTA and processed for Click-iT reaction as described in the EdU labeling assay, except that RNase A and 7-aminoactinomycin D were not used. EU incorporation was then determined by flow cytometry. Top1-targeting drugs (e.g. CPT) are known to induce S-phase-specific cytotoxicity; this is largely attributed to the arrest of the advancing replication forks by the drug-induced Top1 cleavage complexes (22.Hsiang Y.H. Lihou M.G. Liu L.F. Arrest of replication forks by drug-stabilized topoisomerase I-DNA cleavable complexes as a mechanism of cell killing by camptothecin.Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5077-5082PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of non-S-phase cytotoxicity of Top1-targeting drugs is less well characterized. Using serum-starved primary MEFs (quiescent cells that are not in S-phase) as a model, we have previously shown that Top2β knock-out MEFs (Top2β−/−) were highly resistant to Top2-targeting drugs (e.g. VP-16) as compared with wild-type MEFs (Top2β+/+) (36.Azarova A.M. Lyu Y.L. Lin C.P. Tsai Y.C. Lau J.Y. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. From the cover: Roles of DNA topoisomerase II isozymes in chemotherapy and secondary malignancies.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In addition, we have also examined the cytotoxicity of Top1-targeting drugs in Top2β−/− MEFs. Surprisingly, sensitivity to CPT was much higher in Top2β−/− MEFs than in wild-type MEFs. As shown in Fig. 1, the viability of MEFs upon CPT treatment (4-day continuous treatment) showed a clear dependence on the presence of Top2β. Top2β+/+ MEFs are relatively resistant to CPT, with an IC50 greater than 25 μm (Fig. 1 and Table 1). However, Top2β−/− MEFs were much more sensitive to CPT, with an IC50 less than 2 μm (Fig. 1 and Table 1). To determine whether this hypersensitivity phenomenon was specific to Top1-targeting drugs, a variety of agents was examined using the 4-day MTT assay. As shown in Table 1, Top2β−/− MEFs were hypersensitive only to Top1-targeting drugs (i.e. CPT and TPT) but not other cytotoxic agents such as staurosporine, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and bleomycin. The reduced sensitivity to VP-16 (etoposide, a Top2-targeting drug) is expected because Top2β−/− MEFs lack the drug target. These results suggest a specific link between Top2β deficiency and enhanced sensitivity toward Top1-targeting drugs.TABLE 1Top2β-deficient MEFs are hypersensitive to Top1-targeting drugsCPTTPTVP-16StaurosporineH2O2BleomycinμmμmμmμmμmμmTop2β+/+>20>2522 ± 1.50.4 ± 0.122 ± 392 ± 5Top2β−/−1.7 ± 0.56.5 ± 0.3>2000.3 ± 0.220 ± 299 ± 4 Open table in a new tab In addition to Top2β−/− knock-out MEFs, we have also manipulated the protein level of Top2β by treating wild-type MEFs with ICRF-187 to investigate the relationship between sensitivity to Top1-targeting drugs and the Top2β protein level. ICRF-187 is a catalytic inhibitor of Top2 and is able to induce Top2β degradation in various cells (37.Lyu Y.L. Kerrigan J.E. Lin C.P. Azarova A.M. Tsai Y.C. Ban Y. Liu L.F.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 3239-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 (inset), a 24-h treatment of ICRF-187 was able to significantly down-regulate Top2β in primary MEFs. Under this condition, sensitivity to CPT and TPT, but not staurosporine, was greatly increased (>5-fold) in ICRF-187-treated Top2β+/+ MEFs (Table 2). By contrast, VP-16-induced cytotoxicity was reduced at least 7-fold by ICRF-187 treatment (Fig. 1 and Table 2). Our results indicate that Top2β is involved in determining the cytotoxicity of Top1-targeting drugs in quiescent MEFs.TABLE 2ICRF-187 sensitizes wild-type MEFs to Top1-targeting drugsCPTTPTVP-16StaurosporineμmμmμmμmDMSO18 ± 1>2529 ± 30.5 ± 0.3ICRF-1872.7 ± 0.27.2 ± 0.3>2000.7 ± 0.5 Open table in a new tab In the absence of high level DNA replication, there was much less collision between the replication fork and CPT-trapped Top1 cleavage complexes, and quiescent or postmitotic cells are in general more resistant to CPT.

We therefore pulse-labeled primary MEFs with the thymidine analog EdU for d"

As a sink for lipophilic pollutants, vegetation is very important for the degradation and fate of organic contamination; however, little was known about their phytotoxicity and mechanisms of toxic effect. In this study, the stereoselective phototoxicity of four isomers (α, β, γ, and δ) of HCHs mediated by independent as well as interconnecting systems of photosynthesis and enzymatic antioxidant defense system in Arabidopsis thaliana were assessed.Our results revealed that all the HCHs not only stimulated the activities of catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD), but also inhibited the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD). In photosynthesis system, the photosynthetic efficiency of PSI and PSII were all down regulated. Meanwhile, results from both systems showed that δ-HCH was the most toxic one, while α-HCH the least in Arabidopsis thaliana.For the first time, stereoselective effects of different isomers of HCH in plant were demonstrated. And the results suggest that it requires further research to fully elucidate the environmental toxicity and their mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2014069744,"Transcription and expression regulation of some individual cel genes (cel5A, cel5I, cel5D and cel44O) of Clostridium cellulolyticum were investigated. Unlike the cip-cel operon, these genes are transcribed as monocistronic units of transcription, except cel5D. The location of the transcription initiation sites was determined using RT-PCR and the mRNA 5′-end extremities were detected using primer extension experiments. Similarly to the cip-cel operon, cel5A and cel5I expressions are regulated by a carbon catabolite repression mechanism, whereas cel44O and cel5D expressions do not seem to be submitted to this regulation. The role of the putative transcriptional regulator GlyR2 in the regulation of cel5D expression was investigated. The recombinant protein GlyR2 was produced and was shown to bind in vitro to the cel5D and glyR2 promoter regions, suggesting that besides regulating its own expression, GlyR2 may regulate cel5D expression. To test this hypothesis in vivo, an insertional glyR2 mutant was generated and the effect of this disruption on cel5D expression was evaluated. Levels of cel5D mRNAs in the mutant were 16 fold lower than that of the wild-type strain suggesting that GlyR2 acts as an activator of cel5D expression."
https://openalex.org/W2015990640,"A tissue antigen, HLA-B27, is strongly associated with a group of rheumatic diseases called spondyloarthritides. Despite the intensive research, the exact role of HLA-B27 in the pathogenesis of these diseases is still unclear. Here we studied whether HLA-B27 modulates the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT-1) serine 727 residue and the localization of STAT-1 in Salmonella-infected human monocytic cells. In addition, we studied the role of signaling molecule double-stranded RNA activated protein kinase (PKR) in these modulatory effects. U937 human monocytic cell transfectants stably expressing wild type HLA-B27 or mutated HLA-B27 heavy chains with amino acid substitutions in the B pocket were prepared. The PMA-differentiated cells were infected with S. enteritidis. Western blotting was used to detect the phosphorylation of STAT-1, and to visualize the localization of STAT-1 in the cells confocal microscopy was used. Specific inhibitors were employed to study the role of PKR in STAT-1 phosphorylation. We discovered that the phosphorylation of STAT-1 serine 727 is prolonged in cells expressing misfolding forms of HLA-B27 after S. enteritidis infection, whereas in mock cells and in cells expressing mutated, non-misfolding HLA-B27 the phosphorylation of serine 727 is transient. Interestingly, STAT-1 serine 727 phosphorylation is partly dependent on PKR. In addition, more STAT-1 is localized in the nucleus of HLA-B27-expressing cells, even before an external trigger, when compared to mock cells. In conclusion, our results show that the phosphorylation of STAT-1 serine 727 residue is prolonged in HLA-B27-expressing monocyte-macrophage U937 cells after bacterial infection. This is of interest since the phosphorylation of serine 727 on STAT-1 is suggested to contribute to macrophage activation and promote inflammatory responses. Therefore, our results provide a mechanism which explains how the expression of an HLA-B27 molecule can impact the course of Salmonella infection and reactive arthritis."

https://openalex.org/W2017335222,"Populations of the Large-flowered Sandwort (Arenaria grandiflora L.) in the Fontainebleau forest (France) have declined rapidly during the last century. Despite the initiation of a protection program in 1991, less than twenty individuals remained by the late 1990s. The low fitness of these last plants, which is likely associated with genetic disorders and inbreeding depression, highlighted the need for the introduction of non-local genetic material to increase genetic diversity and thus restore Fontainebleau populations. Consequently, A. grandiflora was introduced at three distant sites in the Fontainebleau forest in 1999. Each of these populations was composed of an identical mix of individuals of both local and non-local origin that were obtained through in vitro multiplication. After establishment, the population status (number of individuals, diameter of the plants, and number of flowers) of the introduced populations was monitored. At present, two populations (one of which is much larger than the other) persist, while the third one became extinct in 2004. Analyses of the ecological parameters of the introduction sites indicated that differences in soil pH and moisture might have contributed to the differences in population dynamics. This introduction plan and its outcome attracted interest of local community, with those who supported the plan and regarded its 10-year result as a biological success (i.e., persistent populations were created), but also those who expressed reservations or disapproval of the plan and its outcome. To understand this controversy, a sociological study involving 27 semi-structured interviews was carried out. From these interviews emerged three areas of controversy: alteration of the identity of the plant, alteration of the identity of its territory, and the biological and ethical consequences of the techniques used for the experimental conservation."
