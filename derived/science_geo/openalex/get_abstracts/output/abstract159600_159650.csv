https://openalex.org/W2039576757,"Many cofactors bind the hormone-activated estrogen receptor (ER), yet the specific regulators of endogenous ER-mediated gene transcription are unknown. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we find that ER and a number of coactivators rapidly associate with estrogen responsive promoters following estrogen treatment in a cyclic fashion that is not predicted by current models of hormone activation. Cycles of ER complex assembly are followed by transcription. In contrast, the anti-estrogen tamoxifen (TAM) recruits corepressors but not coactivators. Using a genetic approach, we show that recruitment of the p160 class of coactivators is sufficient for gene activation and for the growth stimulatory actions of estrogen in breast cancer supporting a model in which ER cofactors play unique roles in estrogen signaling."

In control HeLa cells, Bax is present in the cytosol and weakly associated with mitochondria as a monomer with an apparent molecular mass of 20,000 Da. After treatment of the HeLa cells with the apoptosis inducer staurosporine or UV irradiation, Bax associated with mitochondria is present as two large molecular weight oligomers/complexes of 96,000 and 260,000 Da, which are integrated into the mitochondrial membrane. Bcl-2 prevents Bax oligomerization and insertion into the mitochondrial membrane. The outer mitochondrial membrane protein voltage-dependent anion channel and the inner mitochondrial membrane protein adenosine nucleotide translocator do not coelute with the large molecular weight Bax oligomers/complexes on gel filtration. Bax oligomerization appears to be required for its proapoptotic activity, and the Bax oligomer/complex might constitute the structural entirety of the cytochromec-conducting channel in the outer mitochondrial membrane.

Bax oligomerization appears to be required for its proapoptotic activity, and the Bax oligomer/complex might constitute the structural entirety of the cytochromec-conducting channel in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Apoptosis is mediated through two major pathways, the death receptor pathway and the mitochondrial pathway (1Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6296) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial pathway is controlled and regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins (2Yang E. Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Green D.R. Reed J.C.

This protein family can be divided into antiapoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, A1) and proapoptotic (Bax, Bak, Bok/Mtd, Bcl-Xs, Bid, Bad, Bik/Nbk, Bim, Blk) members (5Kroemer G. Nat.

Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar). Although the overall amino acid sequence homology between the family members is relatively low, they contain highly conserved domains, referred to as Bcl-2 homology domains (BH1 to -4). The activity of these proteins appears to be regulated, at least partly, by formation of homo- and heterocomplexes (8Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

The conserved BH domains are involved in these interactions. In the proapoptotic proteins, Bax and Bak, the BH3 domain is essential for complex formation as well as for their “killing” effect (4Kelekar A. Thompson C.B.

The hydrophobic C-terminal domain present in some of the proteins has been implicated in targeting the proteins to intracellular membranes (11Borner C. Martinou I. Mattmann C. Irmler M. Schaerer E.

It now appears clear that mitochondria have an important function in at least some apoptotic signaling cascades (3, 19– 20). Following a death stimulus, many proteins from the mitochondrial intramembrane space, including cytochrome c, adenylate kinase, Smac/DIABLO, procaspases, and apoptosis-inducing factor, have been reported to be released into the cytosol (21Bossy-Wetzel E.

Cell. 2000; 102: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). The release of cytochrome c has been shown to be a fast process, depleting the mitochondria of cytochrome c within a few minutes (27Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). In the cytosol, cytochrome c forms a complex with Apaf-1, dATP, and procaspase 9 (28Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). The complex formation leads to caspase 9 activation followed by downstream activation of other caspases, ultimately leading to cell death. Mounting evidence points to Bax and other proapoptotic family members as the central regulators of the release of proteins from the mitochondrial intramembrane space. Overexpression of Bax in cells or the addition of purified recombinant Bax directly to isolated mitochondria triggers the release of cytochrome c (29Rosse T. Olivier R. Monney L. Rager M. Conus S.

However, the mechanism through which Bax triggers the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane is unclear. The three-dimensional solution structure of the full-length Bax protein has recently been solved by NMR (33Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). The Bax structure shows a high similarity to the overall conformation of the two other Bcl-2 family proteins for which structural information is available, the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL and the BH3 domain-only protein Bid (34Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.-L. Ng S.-C. Fesik S.W.

Of the three proteins, the Bax structure is the only one that contains the C-terminal hydrophobic domain. This domain forms a helix (α9) that protects the BH3-containing hydrophobic cleft on the protein. The structures of the Bcl-2 proteins are reminiscent of diphtheria toxin and the colicins A and E1. These toxins are pore-forming proteins that function as membrane channels that allow passage of ions or small polypeptides. Bax and other Bcl-2 family proteins have been shown to possess channel-forming activity in artificial membranes (37Minn A.J. Velez P. Schendoe S.L. Liang H. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Fill M.

We have shown that in contrast to oligomeric Bax, monomeric recombinant Bax cannot form channels in liposomes nor trigger cytochromec release from isolated mitochondria (41Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Eskes R. Martinou J.-C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Recently, Bax tetramers were shown to form a channel large enough to allow the release of cytochrome c from liposomes (42Saito M. Korsmeyer S.J. Schlesinger P.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 553-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Here we show that, in cultured cells exposed to the apoptosis inducer staurosporine or UV irradiation, Bax forms oligomers, which possibly form complexes with yet unidentified mitochondrial membrane proteins. The Bax oligomers are found inserted into the mitochondrial membrane. Moreover, we show that in the presence of Bcl-2, Bax oligomer formation and insertion into the mitochondrial membrane is inhibited.

Apoptosis was induced by culturing the cells in medium containing 1 μm staurosporine for 16 h; alternatively, the cells were UV irradiated (280 mJ cm−2) and subsequently cultured for 16 h. Control cells were cultured in the absence of staurosporine or without UV irradiation. At the end of the treatment, the cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA, recovered by centrifugation at 750 × g for 10 min, washed, and suspended in mitochondrial buffer (MB) (210 mmmanitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5). The cells suspended in MB supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were disrupted by passage through a 25G1 0.5 × 25 needle. The sample was passed through the needle five times and subsequently centrifuged at 2000 × g for 3 min. The supernatant was saved, and the pellet was resuspended in MB. The breakage procedure was repeated four times. The combined supernatants were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 3 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. This supernatant was kept and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to give the cytosolic cell fraction. The pellet fraction, corresponding to the mitochondrial fraction, was suspended in MB and recentrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Alternatively, the first 13,000 × g mitochondrial pellet was suspended in 4 ml of MB, and 2-ml portions were layered on top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient consisting of 20 ml of 1.2 m sucrose, 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, on top of 17 ml of 1.6 m sucrose, 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. The sample was centrifuged at 27,000 rpm in a Beckman SW28 rotor for 2 h at 4 °C. Mitochondria were recovered at the interface of 1.2 and 1.6 m sucrose and washed in MB. All manipulations were carried out at 4 °C. Isolated mitochondria (3 mg/ml) suspended in 1 ml of KCl buffer (15 mm Hepes-NaOH, 125 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mmNaH2PO4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm succinate, pH 7.5) were incubated with 50 nmrecombinant caspase 8-cleaved Bid for 30 min at 30 °C. At the end of the incubation, the sample was centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 10 min, and the mitochondria were washed with MB buffer. The washed mitochondrial fraction was suspended in MB containing 2% CHAPS or 2% Triton X-100, incubated on ice for 1 h, sonicated, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant corresponds to the solubilized mitochondrial fraction. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. The mitochondrial pellet was suspended in 0.1 mNa2CO3, pH 12, to a final protein concentration of 3 mg/ml and incubated on ice for 20 min. At the end of the incubation, the sample was centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 1 h. The supernatant, which contains nonmembrane-integrated proteins, was saved, and CHAPS was added to a final concentration of 2%. The pellet was suspended in MB containing 2% CHAPS, incubated on ice for 1 h, sonicated, and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant, which contains solubilized integral membrane proteins, was saved. Gel filtrations were performed at 4 °C on a Superdex 200 (16/60) column equilibrated in 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, 300 mm NaCl, 0.2 mmDTT, 2% (w/v) CHAPS, pH 7.5, and run at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. When Triton extracts were analyzed, CHAPS was replaced by 2% Triton X-100. The column was calibrated with gel filtration standard proteins from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech giving the following elution volumes: thyroglobulin (669,000 Da), 49.9 ml; ferritin (440,000 Da), 55.9 ml; catalase (232,000 Da), 65.5 ml; BSA (67,000 Da), 77.5 ml; ovalbumin (43,000 Da), 83.2 ml; chymotrypsinogen A (25,000 Da), 92.9 ml; ribonuclease A (13,700 Da), 97.4 ml. The void volume of the column was determined by blue Sepharose that eluted at 43.3 ml. A 500-μl sample was loaded onto the column, and the eluate was monitored at 280 nm. After 20 min elution (20 ml), fractions of 2 ml were collected, and aliquots from the fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. The samples were separated on 14% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The proteins were detected with the specific antibodies as indicated in the figures, and the blots were developed with the ECL system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Bax was tagged with His, HA, and Myc at the N terminus, and the constructs were cloned into the pC1 vector (Stratagene). HEK cells were then transfected with the three different Bax constructs (Fugene6) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The transfection efficiency was between 50 and 60%. 100 μm ZVAD was added 60 min prior to the addition of 1.6 μg of each of the Bax plasmids, and the cells were cultured for 16 h. At the end of the incubation, the cells were harvested, and mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation as described above. Mitochondria isolated from transfected HEK cells corresponding to 0.5 mg of mitochondrial protein was incubated with 1 μm caspase 8-cleaved Bid in KCl buffer (15 mm Hepes-NaOH, 125 mm KCl, 4 mmMgCl2, 5 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm succinate, pH 7.5) for 15 min at 30 °C. At the end of the incubation, the mitochondria were recovered by centrifugation and resuspended in 400 μl of MB containing 1 mm EGTA. The cross-linkers bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (Pierce) and disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) were added to final concentrations of 2 mm, and the sample was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to a final concentration of 20 mm and subsequent incubation for 15 min at room temperature. The mitochondria were recovered by centrifugation and solubilized by incubation in radioimmune precipitation buffer (19 mm Tris-HCl, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate) for 30 min at 4 °C. The sample was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was treated with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 3 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose was removed by centrifugation, and 4 μg of anti-His antibody and 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose were added and incubated on rotation for 16 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose was recovered by centrifugation and washed four times with 400 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer. The washed Sepharose was suspended in sample buffer, and the samples were analyzed on 10% NuPage gels in a Mops running buffer system (Novex). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and analyzed by Western blot with four different antibodies, anti-HA, anti-Myc, anti-Bax, and anti-VDAL. Cytosolic samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 5 min and then treated with cross-linker and analyzed as above. Full-length Bax with a His tag at the N terminus was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as previously described (45Montessuit S. Mazzei G. Magnenat E. Antonsson B. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Oligomerization was induced by disrupting the bacteria in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. During the purification, Triton was exchanged for 1% octyl glucoside. The purified protein was stored in 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, 0.2 mm DTT, 1% octyl glucoside, 30% glycerol, pH 7.5, at −80 °C. Full-length Bid with a His tag at the N terminus was expressed inE. coli and purified as previously described (46Desagher S. Osen-Sand A Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J-C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). The purified Bid was stored in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm DTT, 30% glycerol, pH 7.5, at −80 °C. Caspase 8-cleaved Bid was generated by mixing 200 μl of Bid (12.4 mg/ml) with 200 μl of caspase cleavage buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH, 10 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl, 10% sucrose, pH 7.5) and 1 μl of caspase 8 (3 mg/ml), and the sample was incubated for 2 h at 20 °C. Over 95% of Bid was cleaved as estimated by SDS-PAGE. Cleaved Bid was separated from caspase 8 by binding to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose; step-eluted by 100 mm imidazole; dialyzed into 25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm DTT, 30% glycerol, pH 7.5; and stored at −80 °C. Cultured HeLa cells have been used to study the quaternary structure of Bax in apoptotic cells. Apoptosis was induced by culturing the cells in the presence of 1 μm staurosporine for 16 h or by UV irradiation. Consistent with published results, in untreated HeLa cells, Bax was found both in the cytosol and associated with the mitochondria (Fig. 1). In apoptotic cells, Bax almost completely disappeared from the cytosol. Although a small increase in Bax associated with the mitochondria was seen in the apoptotic cells, this does not fully account for the decreased cytosolic Bax concentration (Fig. 1), suggesting that cytosolic Bax that is not translocated to the mitochondria is eliminated in apoptotic cells, possibly through proteolysis (47Wood D.E. Thomas A. Devi L.A. Berman Y. Beavis R.C. Reed J.C. Newcomb E.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1069-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). To study the quaternary structure of Bax associated with mitochondria from control and apoptotic HeLa cells, mitochondrial proteins were extracted with 2% Triton X-100 as described under “Materials and Methods.” The soluble mitochondrial extracts were analyzed on gel filtration, and the fractions from the column were analyzed by Western blot with an anti-Bax antibody. Gel filtration separates molecules according to the Stokes radius and gives an estimate of their molecular weights and thus of their quaternary structure. Bax extracted from either control or apoptotic HeLa cell mitochondria eluted as a single peak at fractions 20–24, corresponding to a molecular mass of 260,000 Da (Fig.2). Monomeric Bax was found neither in control nor apoptotic mitochondrial extract. Furthermore, analysis of other mitochondrial membrane proteins that have been suggested to interact with Bax, including Bak, Bcl-XL, and VDAC, all coeluted with Bax as high molecular weight complexes in fractions 20–24. Again, no difference was observed between mitochondrial extracts from control and apoptotic cells (Fig. 2). However, the mitochondrial membrane protein Cox IV eluted with a main peak in fractions 28–30 and a minor peak in fractions 22–24. The void volume of the column was at fraction 12. Triton X-100 has been reported to induce dimerization of Bax and other Bcl-2 family members (48Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we reported that Triton X-100 was able to trigger oligomerization of soluble monomeric Bax (41Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Eskes R. Martinou J.-C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Therefore, Triton might have induced the oligomerization of Bax and possibly other proteins extracted from the mitochondrial membrane, masking any differences in protein quaternary structure between control and apoptotic cells. Previous studies on the ability of various detergents to trigger Bax oligomerization showed that in contrast to Triton X-100 and octyl glucoside, CHAPS had no effect on Bax quaternary structure (41Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Eskes R. Martinou J.-C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether CHAPS could extract Bax from mitochondria. As shown in Fig. 3,2% CHAPS was as efficient as 2% Triton X-100 in extracting Bax from the mitochondrial membrane of both control and apoptotic cells. This is an important control to ensure that we were not extracting and analyzing only a subpopulation of Bax from the mitochondria. Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation from control and apoptotic HeLa cells, proteins were extracted with 2% CHAPS as described under “Materials and Methods,” and the soluble mitochondrial extracts were analyzed on gel filtration. In the mitochondrial extract from control cells, Bax eluted in fractions 36–40. This corresponds to a molecular mass of 20,000 Da, which is close to the theoretical calculated molecular mass of monomeric Bax, 22,000 Da (Fig.4 A). In contrast, in the mitochondrial extract from cells where apoptosis had been induced by staurosporine treatment, Bax eluted mainly as large oligomers in fractions 20–28. Two peaks with estimated molecular masses of 260,000 and 96,000 Da were consistently detected (n = 9) (Fig.4 A). The amount of monomeric Bax eluting in fractions 36–38 varied between preparations and could depend on the percentage of cells that had entered apoptosis at the time of harvest. Identical results were obtained with a monoclonal anti-Bax antibody, confirming that the protein detected was indeed Bax (results not shown). Western blot analysis with marker antibodies for various organelles showed that the mitochondria isolated by differential centrifugation was contaminated mainly by ER (Fig. 5). To ensure that the Bax oligomers were associated with the mitochondria, the mitochondrial fraction was further purified on a sucrose gradient; this purification step improved the purity of the preparation. The sucrose gradient-purified mitochondria confirmed the result; oligomeric Bax (fractions 20–28) was found in the mitochondrial extract from apoptotic cells, whereas monomeric Bax (fractions 36–40) was present in both apoptotic and control mitochondrial extracts (Fig.4 B). In addition, inducing apoptosis by exposing HeLa cells to UV irradiation also induced oligomerization of Bax associated with the mitochondria. Similar to mitochondrial extract from staurosporine-treated cells, two peaks of Bax oligomers at fractions 20–22 (M r 260,000) and fractions 26–28 (M r 96,000) were detected on gel filtration (Fig. 6). Furthermore, we treated isolated HeLa mitochondria with 50 nm caspase 8-cleaved Bid for 30 min. The extract from the Bid-treated mitochondria contained the same Bax oligomers as mitochondria from staurosporine- or UV-treated HeLa cells (Fig. 6). Thus, inducing apoptosis by three different stimuli all resulted in Bax oligomerization. In addition to its interactions with Bcl-2 family members, Bax has also been reported to interact with other mitochondrial membrane proteins. Interactions with the outer mitochondrial membrane protein VDAC and the inner membrane protein ANT, both part of the permeability transition pore, have been reported (49Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar, 50Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Jurgensmeier J.M. Susin S.A. Vieira H.L.A. Prevost M.-C. Xie Z. Matsuyama S. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. Science. 1998; 281: 2027-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the Bax oligomers contained these proteins, the fractions from the gel filtration column were analyzed for Bak, Bcl-XL, VDAC, and ANT (Fig.4 A). Two major peaks of Bak were detected, eluting in fractions 24–26 and 30–32. A low amount was also present over a wide molecular weight range (fractions 14–32), which suggests various forms of oligomers and/or complexes. However, no difference in the distribution between control and apoptotic cells was detected. Thus, since the Bax oligomers are not present in the mitochondrial membrane of nonapoptotic cells, interactions between Bak and the Bax oligomers are unlikely. Bcl-XL was similarly detected over a large range (fractions 16–32) with a major peak in fractions 26–32. As for Bak, no difference between control and ap"

Stimulation of the Wnt pathway results in the accumulation of a nuclear β-catenin/Tcf complex, activating Wnt target genes. A crystal structure of β-catenin bound to the β-catenin binding domain of Tcf3 (Tcf3-CBD) has been determined. The Tcf3-CBD forms an elongated structure with three binding modules that runs antiparallel to β-catenin along the positively charged groove formed by the armadillo repeats. Structure-based mutagenesis defines three sites in β-catenin that are critical for binding the Tcf3-CBD and are differentially involved in binding APC, cadherin, and Axin.

In HSC, interaction of CXCR3 with its ligands resulted in increased chemotaxis and activation of the Ras/ERK cascade. Activation of CXCR3 also stimulated Src phosphorylation and kinase activity and increased the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and its downstream pathway, Akt.

The concurrent presence of inflammation and extracellular matrix deposition is a characteristic of chronic tissue injury, where the persistence of a wound healing response may lead to permanent scarring and end-stage organ failure, such as in the case of glomerulosclerosis in the kidney, cirrhosis of the liver, atherosclerosis, or pulmonary fibrosis (1Collins T. Robbin's Pathological Basis of Disease. 6th Ed. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1999: 50-88Google Scholar). The pivotal role played by vascular pericytes of different tissues in the process of wound healing has been clearly recognized in recent years. These cells become activated in the presence of damage to the specific tissue, proliferate, migrate, and acquire a myofibroblast-like phenotype, resulting in the production of extracellular matrix as part of the healing process. Hepatic stellate cells (HSC)1 and renal glomerular mesangial cells (MC) represent tissue-specific pericytes, which are deeply involved in the development of the wound healing response and in the pathogenesis of tissue fibrosis in the setting of a chronic damage (2Abboud H.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 3Friedman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2247-2250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar). Understanding the biology of these cells may help to devise novel strategies for the treatment of chronic liver and kidney diseases. The chemokine system has received considerable attention for its involvement in a number of biologic processes. Although members of this family have been initially recognized for their ability to recruit leukocytes to sites of injury, more recent investigation has shown that this system participates in the regulation of a wide number of conditions, including physiologic leukocyte homeostasis, development, angiogenesis, cancer, and the response to infection (4Luster A.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3272) Google Scholar, 5Rossi D. Zlotnik A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 217-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2109) Google Scholar). Activation of the chemokine system has been reported in the presence of chronic inflammation and fibrosis, two processes that are part of the wound healing response (6Romagnani P. Beltrame C. Annunziato F. Lasagni L. Luconi M. Galli G. Cosmi L. Maggi E. Salvadori M. Pupilli C. Serio M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2518-2526PubMed Google Scholar, 7Marra F. DeFranco R. Grappone C.

In addition, several studies have shown that the pericytes responsible for tissue fibrosis may both express chemokines and be targets of the action of chemokines (8Gharaee-Kermani M. Denholm E.M.

In fact, pericytes express chemokine receptors, which, upon activation, elicit biologic actions that favor the wound healing process, including proliferation, migration, and extracellular matrix synthesis (6Romagnani P. Beltrame C. Annunziato F. Lasagni L. Luconi M. Galli G. Cosmi L. Maggi E. Salvadori M. Pupilli C. Serio M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2518-2526PubMed Google Scholar, 12Banas B. Luckow B.

The chemokine receptor CXCR3 is bound with high affinity by the chemokines interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), monokine activated by interferon-γ (Mig), and interferon-inducible T cell α chemoattractant (14Piali L.

CXCR3 has been identified on several cells of hematopoietic lineage, including T and B lymphocytes, and natural killer cells (4Luster A.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3272) Google Scholar, 16Loetscher M. Gerber B. Loetscher P. Jones S.A. Piali L. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of CXCR3 has been indicated as a marker of polarization of the T helper subset of T cells toward a Th1 phenotype (17Bonecchi R. Bianchi G. Bordignon P.P. D'Ambrosio D. Lang R. Borsatti A. Sozzani S. Allavena P. Gray P.A. Mantovani A. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that CXCR3 is expressed by human MC in culture, where CXCR3 agonists induce an increase in cell proliferation, and the expression of CXCR3 on MC is up-regulated in conditions of chronic glomerular damage, indicating a possible involvement in wound healing and repair (6Romagnani P. Beltrame C. Annunziato F. Lasagni L. Luconi M. Galli G. Cosmi L. Maggi E. Salvadori M. Pupilli C. Serio M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2518-2526PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the relevance of this system in a number of pathophysiologic conditions, little information is available on the signal transduction pathways activated by CXCR3 and their possible correlation with the biologic actions elicited by its agonists. In this study we have characterized CXCR3's signaling in HSC and in MC, as paradigm of vascular pericytes belonging to different tissues. We report that CXCR3 activates multiple signaling pathways, including the Ras/ERK pathway, Src, and the PI3K/Akt pathway, which correlate with the ability to induce biologic actions in target cells. Human recombinant IP-10, Mig, EGF, and PDGF-BB were purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Monoclonal antibodies against CXCR3 were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Phospho-specific antibodies against the activated form of ERK, MEK, Raf-1, and Akt (Ser-473), and anti-MEK antibodies were from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Polyclonal Anti-ERK antibodies used for Western blotting, polyclonal anti-Akt antibodies, and rat monoclonal anti-Ras antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Agarose-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were from Oncogene Science (Uniondale, NY). Polyclonal anti-ERK antibodies used for immune complex kinase assay, phospho-specific antibodies against activated Src (Y416), and monoclonal anti-Src antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). For anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting, a mixture of PY99 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) monoclonal antibodies was used. PD98059, AG1478, wortmannin, and genistein were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). PP1 was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Radionuclides were purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). All other reagent were of analytical grade. Human HSC were isolated from wedge sections of liver tissue unsuitable for transplantation by collagenase/pronase digestion and centrifugation on Stractan gradients. Procedures used for cell isolation and characterization have been extensively described elsewhere (18Casini A. Pinzani M. Milani S. Grappone C. Galli G. Jezequel A.M. Schuppan D. Rotella C.M. Surrenti C. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 245-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All the experiments were conducted on cells cultured on uncoated plastic dishes (passage 3–6), showing an “activated” or “myofibroblast-like” phenotype. Cultures of MC were obtained from macroscopically normal kidneys of patients with localized renal tumors undergoing nephrectomy, as described previously (6Romagnani P. Beltrame C. Annunziato F.

The cortex was separated from the medulla and minced; glomeruli were isolated by a standard sieving technique through graded mesh size screens (60, 80, 150 mesh). The glomerular suspension was collected, washed with RPMI 1640 (Sigma), and incubated with 750 units/ml collagenase type IV at 37 °C for 30 min. The glomeruli were then cultured in RPMI 1640 with 17% fetal calf serum and other supplements to obtain MC (6Romagnani P. Beltrame C. Annunziato F. Lasagni L. Luconi M. Galli G. Cosmi L. Maggi E. Salvadori M. Pupilli C. Serio M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2518-2526PubMed Google Scholar). Cultured glomeruli were maintained in a humidified environment of 5% CO2/95% air at 37 °C, and the medium was changed three times a week. MC were used between passages 4 and 7. After saturation of nonspecific binding sites with total rabbit IgG, cells were incubated for 20 min on ice with specific or isotype control antibody. In the indirect staining, this step was followed by a second incubation on ice with an appropriate anti-isotype-conjugated antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL). Finally, cells were washed and analyzed on a FACSCalibur cytofluorimeter using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). In all cytofluorimetric analyses, a total of 104 events for each sample was acquired. Confluent HSC or MC were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in serum-free medium for 48 h. The cells were incubated with agonists for 24 or 36 h and then pulsed with [3H]thymidine. DNA synthesis was measured as the incorporation of tritiated thymidine, as described elsewhere (20Pinzani M. Gesualdo L. Sabbah G.M. Abboud H.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1786-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Confluent HSC or MC were serum-starved for 48 h and then washed, trypsinized, and resuspended in serum-free medium containing 1% albumin at a concentration of 3 × 105 cells/ml. Chemotaxis was measured in modified Boyden chambers equipped with 8-μm pore filters (Poretics, Livermore, CA) coated with rat tail collagen (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA), as previously described (21Marra F. Efsen E. Romanelli R.G. Caligiuri A. Pastacaldi S. Batignani G. Bonacchi A. Caporale R. Laffi G. Pinzani M. Gentilini P. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 466-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). When inhibitors were used, cultured cells were incubated with the drugs to be tested or with their vehicle for 15 min before trypsinization, and equal concentrations were added in the Boyden chamber. Confluent, serum-starved HSC or MC were treated with the appropriate conditions, quickly placed on ice, and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Except for the analysis of Ras activation (see below), the monolayer was lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05% (w/v) aprotinin). Insoluble proteins were discarded by high speed centrifugation at 4 °C. Protein concentration in the supernatant was measured in triplicate using a commercially available assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Equal amounts of total cellular proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot as previously described (21Marra F. Efsen E. Romanelli R.G. Caligiuri A. Pastacaldi S. Batignani G. Bonacchi A. Caporale R. Laffi G. Pinzani M. Gentilini P. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 466-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation was conducted after immunoprecipitation. Briefly, 150 μg of total cellular proteins were incubated with anti-EGF receptor antibodies and protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. The Immunobeads were washed twice in lysis buffer and once in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmNa3VO4, resuspended in Laemmli buffer, and analyzed by Western blot as described above. ERK was immunoprecipitated from 25 μg of total cell lysate using polyclonal anti-ERK antibodies and protein A-Sepharose. After washing, the immunobeads were incubated in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 25 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 0.4 mg/ml myelin basic protein for 30 min at 30 °C. At the end of the incubation, the reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmli buffer and run on 15% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and autoradiographed. This assay was performed after immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, as described elsewhere (22Choudhury G.G. Wang L.M. Pierce J. Harvey S.A. Sakaguchi A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8068-8072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Marra F. Choudhury G.G. Abboud H.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1218-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Radioactive lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography, using chloroform/methanol/30% ammonium hydroxide/water (46/41/5/8, v/v). After drying, the plates were autoradiographed. The radioactive spots were then scraped and counted in a β-counter. Activation of Ras in response to CXCR3 ligands was determined exactly as described by deRooij and Bos (24deRooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding for the GST-RBD fusion protein (kindly provided by Dr. J. L. Bos) was expressed in bacteria and used to obtain recombinant GST-RBD, as described elsewhere (24deRooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Serum-deprived HSC exposed to different conditions were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholase, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors. One milligram of protein was incubated with recombinant GST-RBD and glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma), washed, and analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE followed by anti-Ras immunoblotting. Activation of Src was analyzed by immune complex kinase assay as described by Ishida et al. (25Ishida M. Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Ishida T. Bernstein K.E. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Protein (200 μg) in radioimmune precipitation buffer was incubated with monoclonal anti-Src antibodies and precipitated by the addition of rabbit anti-mouse IgG and protein A-Sepharose. After washing with radioimmune precipitation buffer, the immunobeads were incubated with a buffer containing 20 mmHepes, pH 7.0, 10 mm MnCl2, 20 μg of enolase (Sigma), and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at 30 °C. At the end of the incubation, the reaction was stopped with Laemmli buffer and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the band corresponding to enolase was cut and counted in a β-counter. An immune complex kinase assay of Akt activity was performed as described elsewhere (26Robino G. Parola M. Marra F. Caligiuri A. DeFranco R.M. Zamara E. Bellomo G. Gentilini P. Pinzani M. Dianzani M.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40561-40567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μg of protein was immunoprecipitated using anti-Akt antibodies and protein G-agarose. The Immunobeads were washed three times with washing buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 40 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The assay was performed by resuspending the beads in kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate) in the presence of 1 μm protein kinase A inhibitor peptide, 50 μm unlabeled ATP, and 6 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, using exogenous histone H2B (1.5 μg/assay tube) as the substrate and incubating for 20 min at room temperature. The proteins in the samples were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and subjected to autoradiography. Data presented herein are representative of at least three experiments with comparable results. Unless otherwise indicated, bar graphs show the mean ± S.D. of data from a representative experiment. Because CXCR3 expression has been previously reported in MC (6Romagnani P. Beltrame C. Annunziato F. Lasagni L. Luconi M. Galli G. Cosmi L. Maggi E. Salvadori M. Pupilli C. Serio M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2518-2526PubMed Google Scholar), we first investigated by flow cytometry whether human HSC, as liver-specific pericytes, express this chemokine receptor. As compared with the cells treated with isotype-specific control antibody, anti-CXCR3 antibodies induced a clear shift in fluorescence, indicating CXCR3 expression on the cell surface (Fig.1 A). Expression of the receptor by human HSC was also confirmed by Western blotting (data not shown). To test whether CXCR3 expressed by HSC is functional, we assessed the effects of IP-10 on HSC migration, because activation of chemokine receptors is often associated with the induction of chemotaxis. Exposure of HSC to increasing concentrations of IP-10 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in cell migration, which was 3- to 4-fold greater than that observed in unstimulated cells (Fig. 1 B). When IP-10 (100 ng/ml) was added to both the upper and lower chamber of the Boyden system, HSC migration was similar to that of unstimulated cells, indicating that the effects of IP-10 are dependent on chemotaxis rather than on chemokinesis (data not shown). CXCR3 may be activated by three ligands, including Mig, therefore, we compared the effects of IP-10 and Mig to confirm the role of CXCR3 in the IP-10-induced cell migration. Both agonists were equally effective in their ability to induce cell migration (Fig. 1 C). In addition, the chemotactic activity was shown to peak at a concentration of 100 ng/ml for both ligands (Fig. 1 C and data not shown). We and others have previously reported that ligands of CXCR3 stimulate proliferation of vascular pericytes, including MC (6Romagnani P. Beltrame C. Annunziato F. Lasagni L. Luconi M. Galli G. Cosmi L. Maggi E. Salvadori M. Pupilli C. Serio M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2518-2526PubMed Google Scholar) and smooth muscle cells (9Wang X. Yue T.L. Ohlstein E.H. Sung C.P. Feuerstein G.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24286-24293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effects of CXCR3 ligands on DNA synthesis in HSC. However, neither IP-10 nor Mig, when tested at concentrations as high as 1 μg/ml, resulted in an increase in DNA synthesis, whereas the cells were clearly responsive to known mitogens, such as PDGF (Fig. 1 D). These results indicate that HSC express functional CXCR3 receptors on the cells surface and that activation of this chemokine receptor induces migration, but not proliferation, of this cell type. Despite the relevance of CXCR3 in many pathophysiologic processes, no information on the signal transduction pathways activated by this chemokine receptor is presently available. Using HSC as a model system of cells constitutively expressing this receptor, we explored the intracellular signaling pathways activated by CXCR3. We first focused on the Ras/ERK pathway, which is activated in response to many soluble factors, including chemokines (27Venkatakrishnan G. Salgia R. Groopman J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6868-6875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and regulates different cellular functions. Exposure of HSC to IP-10 for different periods of time resulted in increased phosphorylation of both ERK isoforms, p44ERK-1and p42ERK-2, as assessed by using antibodies that specifically recognize the phosphorylated forms of ERK (Fig.2 A). Peak activation was observed at 15–30 min after addition of IP-10 and returned to basal levels within 4 h after stimulation. At later time points, no ERK phosphorylation could be detected (Fig. 2 A, and data not shown). Concentrations of IP-10 higher than 100 ng/ml did not result in a further increase in ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 2 B). We also tested whether increased phosphorylation of ERK was indeed associated with increased catalytic activity using an immune complex kinase assay. Increased phosphorylation of the substrate myelin basic protein was observed at the same time points where increased ERK phosphorylation was detected (Fig. 2 C). To demonstrate that the effects of IP-10 on ERK are due to CXCR3 activation, similar experiments were conducted using Mig as an agonist. Also in this case, a transient activation of ERK was observed, with a similar time course as that observed in cells exposed to IP-10 (Fig. 2 D). Taken together, these data indicate that interaction between CXCR3 and its ligands leads to activation of ERK. Similar to other members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, ERK activation results from the sequential activation of a small G protein of the Ras superfamily, and a kinase cascade involving a MAPK kinase kinase and a MAPK kinase (28Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). MEK-1/2 is the MAPK kinase responsible for ERK activation. Therefore we explored the effects of IP-10 on the phosphorylation of MEK. At the same time points in which activation of ERK was observed, IP-10 caused a clear increase in the amount of phosphorylated MEK, similarly to PDGF, a known activator of the Ras/ERK pathway (Fig. 3 A). Of note, activation of MEK was associated with activation of the upstream kinase Raf-1, which acts as a MAPK kinase kinase in the Ras/ERK cascade (Fig. 3 B). Finally, we tested whether exposure of HSC to a CXCR3 ligand was associated with increased activation of Ras. We used a fusion protein (GST-RBD) comprising the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1 to selectively precipitate active Ras, which physically interacts with this domain of Raf-1 (24deRooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, active Ras was barely detectable as a doublet migrating at 21 kDa (Fig. 3 C). Exposure of the cells either to IP-10 or to PDGF, used as a positive control, resulted in a greater amount of precipitated Ras, indicating increased activation. Upon activation of G protein-coupled receptors, several mechanisms may be involved in the activation of the Ras/ERK pathway, including nonreceptor tyrosine kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Because the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src has been implicated in the downstream signaling of different G protein-coupled receptors, we explored the ability of IP-10 to activate Src. CXCR3 activation by IP-10 was accompanied by a marked increase in Src phosphorylation on the activation-specific tyrosine 416 (Fig. 4 A) (29Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar), indicating that this receptor activates Src. To confirm that increased phosphorylation of Src was associated with enhanced kinase activity, we performed immune complex kinase assays using immunoprecipitated Src and enolase as a substrate. Also in this condition, an increase in Src activity was observed, which was of the same magnitude as that induced by PDGF, a known activator of this pathway (Fig. 4 B). Because cell migration may be critically regulated by activation of PI3K, we also tested whether the activity of this kinase could be modified by CXCR3 ligands. PI3K activity associated with anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates was increased by 3-fold in cells exposed to IP-10 (Fig.5 A) and declined thereafter. Activation of c-Akt, also known as protein kinase B, has been recognized as a pathway that lies downstream of PI3K activation (30Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar). Akt phosphorylation on the activation-specific residue Thr-473 (30Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar), was markedly increased in HSC exposed to IP-10, similarly to cells treated with PDGF, a known activator of Akt (Fig. 5 B). Moreover, activation of CXCR3 increased the catalytic activity of Akt, as assessed by immune complex kinase assay using PDGF as a positive control (Fig. 5 C) (31Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that CXCR3 activation leads to increased activity of Src and of the PI3K/Akt pathway. To establish which pathways are critical for the CXCR3-mediated activation of ERK, we treated HSC with specific inhibitors of different signaling pathways before adding IP-10. Tyrosine kinases, including Src, and PI3K have both been shown to be implicated in the activation of Ras and the ERK cascade by GPCR (32Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K.

Induction of a protooncogene, normally involved in mitogenic responses, by a genotoxic agent that causes growth arrest seems paradoxical. We now provide an explanation for the role of c-Jun in the UV response of mouse fibroblasts. c-Jun is necessary for cell-cycle reentry of UV-irradiated cells, but does not participate in the response to ionizing radiation. Cells lacking c-Jun undergo prolonged cell-cycle arrest, but resist apoptosis, whereas cells that express c-Jun constitutively do not arrest and undergo apoptosis. This function of c-Jun is exerted through negative regulation of p53 association with the p21 promoter. Cells lacking c-Jun exhibit prolonged p21 induction, whereas constitutive c-Jun inhibits UV-mediated p21 induction."
https://openalex.org/W1965294448,"Threonyl-tRNA synthetase, a class II synthetase, uses a unique zinc ion to discriminate against the isosteric valine at the activation step. The crystal structure of the enzyme with an analog of seryl adenylate shows that the noncognate serine cannot be fully discriminated at that step. We show that hydrolysis of the incorrectly formed ser-tRNA(Thr) is performed at a specific site in the N-terminal domain of the enzyme. The present study suggests that both classes of synthetases use effectively the ability of the CCA end of tRNA to switch between a hairpin and a helical conformation for aminoacylation and editing. As a consequence, the editing mechanism of both classes of synthetases can be described as mirror images, as already seen for tRNA binding and amino acid activation."

In fact, in the United States the incidence of sepsis has increased during the last decennia (1Glauser M.P. Zanetti G. Baumgartner J.D. Cohen J. Lancet. 1991; 338: 732-736Abstract PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) and sepsis has become the most common cause of death in intensive care units, with 150,000 deaths annually (2Parillo J.E. Ann.

Many cases of sepsis are caused by Gram-negative bacteria (1Glauser M.P. Zanetti G. Baumgartner J.D. Cohen J. Lancet. 1991; 338: 732-736Abstract PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS),1 a component of the outer membrane of these bacteria, is the primary cause of Gram-negative sepsis and gives rise to the same clinical features as are observed in patients with sepsis (3Parillo E.P.

Activation of these cells induces the release of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and interleukins (IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-6). These cytokines are responsible for the metabolic and physiologic changes that ultimately lead to pathological conditions (11Waage A. Brandtzaeg P. Halstensen A. Kierulf P. Espevik T. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 169: 333-338Crossref Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 12Chensue S.W. Terebuh P.D. Remick D.G. Scales W.E. Kunkel S.L. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 395-402PubMed Google Scholar, 13Henderson B.

The importance of these cytokines in LPS-induced death arises from observations that administration of TNFα or IL-1 to animals provokes a similar reaction as detected after injection of LPS (14Tracey K.J.

Lipoproteins are suggested to play an important role in the protection against infection and inflammation. All lipoproteins (high density lipoproteins (HDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), lipoprotein(a), very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), and chylomicrons) can bind endotoxin (27Van Lenten B.J.

In particular, incubation of VLDL or chylomicrons with LPS before administration to rodents significantly reduces the serum levels of TNFα and protects against endotoxin-induced death (28Harris H.W. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Rapp J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 29Harris H.W. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Read T.E. Kane J.P. Jones A.L. Eichbaum E.B. Bland G.F. Rapp J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1028-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The protective effect is caused by a lipoprotein-mediated redirection of LPS from Kupffer cells to parenchymal liver cells (29Harris H.W. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Read T.E. Kane J.P. Jones A.L.

Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1341-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and a subsequent secretion of LPS into the bile, where it is inactivated (34Read T.E. Harris H.W. Grunfeld H. Feingold K.R. Calhoun M.C. Kane J.P. Rapp J.H. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3496-3502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, macrophages become less activated, which results in a reduced production of proinflammatory mediators. Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins may be used therapeutically to protect against Gram-negative sepsis or septic shock, but the need for isolation from human lymph or blood impedes their possible application. Within our laboratory, we have developed an emulsion model for chylomicrons from commercially available lipids and human recombinant apoE (35Rensen P.C.N. Van Dijk M.C.M. Havenaar E.C. Bijsterbosch M.K. Van Berkel T.J.C. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), which is selectively taken up via apoE-specific receptors on liver parenchymal cells. In a rat model, we demonstrated that recombinant chylomicrons can target LPS to liver parenchymal cells, which prevents its binding to both splenic and hepatic macrophages. Furthermore, it was shown that apoE binds LPS directly and alters its metabolic fate, suggesting that apoE in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins may be crucial for the lipoprotein-endotoxin interaction (36Rensen P.C.N. van Oosten M. van de Bilt E. van Eck M.

Rats were given an intravenous (i.v.) injection of LPS (10 μg/kg) derived from Salmonella minnesota R595 (Re) (List Biological Laboratories Inc., Campbell, CA), which was preincubated with PBS, apoE-free emulsion (20 mg of triglycerides per kg), apoE (800 μg/kg) or apoE-enriched emulsion for 30 min at 37 °C. Blood samples were taken up to 150 min after injection from the tail vein and allowed to clot for 30 min at room temperature. Serum samples, obtained after centrifugation at 16,000 × gfor 5 min, were screened for their IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα content. ApoE-deficient mice (22–27 g) and control mice (22–27 g) were given an intravenous injection of LPS (25 μg/kg body weight). At the indicated time points (up to 180 min), blood samples were taken, and serum was obtained as described above. In the serum samples TNFα levels were determined. Rat IL-1β was detected using a rat IL-1β-specific ELISA. 96-well plates (NUNC MAXISORP) were coated overnight at 4 °C with sheep anti-rat IL-1β antibodies in coating buffer (PBS containing 0.14 m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8.1 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.2–7.4). Plates were washed three times with wash/dilution buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 2.5 mm NaH2HPO4, 7.4 mmNa2HPO4, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.2). The plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with serum samples and recombinant rat IL-1β (diluted in normal rat serum) as a standard. The plates were washed and subsequently incubated with biotinylated sheep anti rat IL-1β for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed again and streptavidin/polyhorseradish peroxidase was added. After 30 min at room temperature, plates were washed and 1,2-o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride was added, and plates were left for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 mH2SO4, and the absorbance was measured at 495 nm. IL-6 was detected as described by Aardenet al. (39Aarden L.A. De Groot E.R. Schaap O.L. Lansdorp P.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 1411-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). In short, the IL-6-dependent B9 cells (mouse hybridoma cell line) were cultured in IMDM containing 5% fetal calf serum, 3.02 g/liter NaHCO3, 0.1% β-mercapthoethanol, penicillin/streptavidin, and 30 units/ml human recombinant IL-6 (Central Laboratory for Blood research (CLB), Amsterdam, The Netherlands). For detection of IL-6, B9 cells (5 × 103 cells/well) and dilutions of serum samples were added to 96-well plates in a total volume of 200 μl/well. Human IL-6 was used as a standard. Cells were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After this period [3H]thymidine (125 nCi/well) was added, and the cells were incubated for another 4 h at 37 C, 5% CO2. Cells were harvested on a glass filter, and [3H]radioactivity was counted using a Wallac MicroBeta plus LCC. TNFα content of the serum samples was determined using a commercially available ELISA kit for rat or mouse TNFα (Immunosource, Zoersel-Halle, Belgium). The assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mice received an intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg of d-galactosamine. Subsequently, they were injected i.v. with LPS (150 ng/kg), which was preincubated for 30 min at 37 C with PBS or apoE (25 μg/kg). During the 72-h period after injection, the survival was determined, after which no further loss of animals occurred. Mice were injected with PBS or LPS (100 μg/kg). At different time points after injection, blood samples were taken from the tail vein and allowed to clot for 30 min. Serum was obtained by centrifugation for 5 min at 16,000 × g and screened for their apoE content, using a mouse apoE-specific ELISA as described (36Rensen P.C.N. van Oosten M. van de Bilt E. van Eck M.

Proteins within the sera (1-μl aliquots) were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 20% methanol, 192 mm glycine, and 0.02% SDS. Blots were immunolabeled with rabbit anti-mouse apoE antibody and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence, essentially as described (40Van Velzen A.G. Da Silva P.P. Gordon S. Van Berkel T.J.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The n value is indicated for each experiment. Statistical differences in cytokine and apoE production were determined using a two-tailed Student's ttest. Statistical differences in survival curves among the groups of mice were analyzed by log rank test. For both analyses, Graphpad software (Prism and Instat) was used. To determine the effect of apoE on LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine levels, rats were injected with LPS in the absence or presence of apoE and/or emulsion, and the cytokine levels were determined up to 4 h after injection. Injection of LPS resulted in a strong induction of TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 in serum, reaching peak levels at 60, 90, and 120 min after LPS administration, respectively (Fig.1). Injection with PBS alone had no effect on cytokine levels (not shown). Administration of the apoE-enriched emulsion together with LPS largely inhibited the LPS-induced maximum levels of TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 for 80%, 91%, and 98%, respectively (p < 0.05, Fig. 1). In fact, apoE alone inhibited the LPS-induced maximum serum levels of these cytokines (p < 0.05) to a similar extent (68%, 99%, and 99%) as the apoE-enriched emulsion. The effects observed with free and emulsion-associated apoE were not significantly different, suggesting that the apoE moiety of the recombinant chylomicrons is responsible for the detoxification of LPS. In agreement with this assumption, the apoE-free emulsion did not significantly reduce the LPS-induced cytokine levels (Fig. 1). The proinflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-1 may both play an important role in the fatal outcome of Gram-negative sepsis. Inhibition of the LPS-induced serum levels of these cytokines by concomitant administration of apoE is, therefore, expected to render rodents less susceptible to a lethal dose of LPS. Mice were sensitized to the lethal action of LPS withd-(+)-galactosamine (GalN) according to Galanos et al. (41Galanos C. Freudenberg M.A. Reutter W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76 (.,): 5939-5943Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). We have observed in rats that preincubation of radioiodinated LPS (10–20 μg/kg) with apoE (1.6 mg/kg) significantly reduced the uptake of LPS by the liver (46.1 ± 5.3%versus 69.2 ± 7.4% of the injected dose at 10 min after injection; p < 0.001), and increased the HDL-bound fraction of LPS in the serum (40.5 ± 3.5%versus 12.6 ± 2.8%; p < 0.001, Ref.36Rensen P.C.N. van Oosten M. van de Bilt E. van Eck M. Kuiper J. van Berkel T.J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2438-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Using the same dosage in mice, the effects of apoE on the kinetics of LPS are essentially similar. ApoE significantly reduces the liver uptake of LPS (54.0 ± 2.1% versus 79.2 ± 5.0% at 10 min after injection; p < 0.01), and increases the association of LPS to HDL in the serum (33.3 ± 1.0%versus 12.1 ± 3.0%; p < 0.01) (not shown). The distribution of LPS over the various organs was similar in mice and rats. The same results were obtained using GalN-pretreated mice, indicating that GalN does not interfere with the mechanism of redirecting LPS from (hepatic and splenic) macrophages to liver parenchymal cells in vivo. Intravenous injection of LPS into GalN-pretreated mice (150 ng/kg) resulted in death of 57% (4/7) of the mice within 48 h after injection (Fig.2). In contrast, all mice were rescued by the concomitant administration of a low dose of apoE (25 μg/kg), which was just sufficient to bind all of the injected LPS (36Rensen P.C.N. van Oosten M. van de Bilt E. van Eck M. Kuiper J. van Berkel T.J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2438-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This significant (p = 0.022) difference in mortality demonstrates that the interference of apoE with the metabolic fate of LPS is not only accompanied by a strong inhibition of the cytokine levels in serum but also protects against LPS-induced death. ApoE-deficient mice and control mice were injected with a sublethal dose of LPS (25 μg/kg). The level of TNFα was determined up to 3 h after injection, and both types of mice showed an increase in TNFα levels starting at 30 min after injection and peaking at 60–90 min after LPS injection (Fig. 3). The TNFα levels in control mice were significantly (p < 0.05) lower than in the apoE-deficient mice, indicating that the presence of apoE in the serum significantly protects the mice against the effects of LPS. Next, we questioned whether the observed effects of exogenous apoE on the detoxification of LPS may imply a physiological role of endogenous apoE in Gram-negative bacterial infections. It is known that LPS, which remains in the serum after injection into rodents, is largely associated with HDL (42Ulevitch R.J. Johnston A.R. Weinstein D.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 64: 1516-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). ApoE does bind to HDL when injected into rodents, and we observed that incubation of LPS with apoE before injection, results in an ∼3-fold higher association of LPS with HDL in rats and mice (36Rensen P.C.N. van Oosten M. van de Bilt E. van Eck M. Kuiper J. van Berkel T.J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2438-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that LPS may increase the endogenous serum levels of apoE, leading to an increased detoxification capacity of the serum. Indeed, a single challenge of mice with LPS (100 μg/kg) had a profound effect on the serum level of endogenous apoE (Fig.4 A). Whereas injection of PBS had no effect, injection of LPS resulted in a gradual increase of the apoE concentration up to 178.8 ± 8.4% of the initial value at 12 h after injection. The apoE level returned to baseline levels at 36 h after injection (Fig. 4 A). In these fed animals, LPS had no substantial effect on the serum levels of triglycerides, which basically showed feeding state-dependent fluctuations. However, a small but significant difference in cholesterol level was observed at 12 h after injection (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4 B). To avoid the feeding-dependent lipid fluctuations, the experiment was repeated with animals, which were fasted, starting 12 h before injection and throughout the experiment (not shown). In the control animals a decrease in serum apoE (80.4 ± 7.4% of the initial value) and total cholesterol (93.0 ± 0.1% of the initial value) was observed. In contrast, at 100 μg/kg, LPS again largely increased the serum level of apoE (186 ± 11%;p < 0.001), which was accompanied by a modest, but highly significant, increase in cholesterol level (115.8 ± 4.8%;p < 0.01). Analysis of the apoE content of the individual lipoprotein fractions that were separated by fast protein liquid chromatography (SMART System; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden), showed that the additional apoE was specifically recovered in the HDL fraction, which represents the predominant lipoprotein fraction in mice (not shown). The increase in serum apoE was also visualized by immunolabeling on blots and was in accordance with the data obtained with ELISA (Fig.4 C). The intensity of the apoE band was increased at 12 h after the injection of LPS, whereas in the controls a slight reduction of the apoE staining was observed. The antibody reacted solely with a single 34-kDa protein band in the serum of fasted C57Bl/6J mice that were injected with PBS or LPS. This band could not be detected in the serum of apoE-deficient mice, which accounts for the specific staining of apoE. The present work demonstrates that LPS strongly increases the endogenous serum level of apoE in a rodent model. The mechanism by which apoE is increased may involve either de novo protein synthesis as induced by LPS and/or cytokines or release from existing intra- and extracellular pools. It is likely that a continuous LPS stimulus may provoke a long-term elevation of serum apoE levels. Indeed, septic patients demonstrated that, although these patients show a severe hypocholesterolemia, both the HDL and LDL fractions were largely enriched in apoE (43Fraunberger P. Parhofer K.G. Cremer P. Gerling A. Siegele B. Walli A.K. Seidel D. Atherosclerosis. 1997; 134 (abstr.): 349Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), whereas a single LPS-challenge increased the apoE content of HDL in African green monkeys (44Auerbach B.J. Parks J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10264-10270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we observed that exogenous apoE decreased the LPS-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines, probably by decreasing the release of cytokines by macrophages. These data are in full accordance with our earlier findings that free and emulsion-bound apoE, but not the emulsion alone, altered the in vivo kinetics of radioiodinated LPS and largely decreased the association of LPS with macrophages (36Rensen P.C.N. van Oosten M. van de Bilt E. van Eck M. Kuiper J. van Berkel T.J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2438-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The interference of apoE with the metabolic fate of LPS is not only accompanied by a strong inhibition of the cytokine levels in serum, but also protects against LPS-induced death, indicating that the reduction in cytokine levels is followed by a reduction in mortality. The absence of apoE from the serum (apoE-deficient mice) led to a 2-fold higher sensitivity of the mice for treatment with LPS than control mice, because in the absence of apoE, a 2-fold increase is TNFα levels was observed. This is surprising because apoE-deficient mice have 8-fold higher cholesterol levels than control mice, but the absence of apoE from the lipoproteins apparently leads to an inability to neutralize LPS. These data are in agreement with very recent data of de Bont et al. (45De Bont N. Netea M.G. Demacker P.N.M. Verschueren I. Kullberg B.J. van Dijk K.W. van der Meer J.W. Stalenhoef A.F. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 680-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who showed that apoE-deficient mice produce significantly more TNFα in response to LPS than control mice, and the mortality after injection of LPS was significantly higher in apoE-deficient mice than in control mice. The levels of IL-1 and IL-6 however were similar in apoE-deficient and control mice in response to LPS. Until recently, apoE has been assigned a classical anti-atherogenic role in lipid metabolism (46Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar). Recent data, however, indicate that only 2–10% of the endogenous apoE serum level in rodents is sufficient for the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis (38Van Eck M. Herijgers N. Yates J. Pearce N.J. Hoogerbrugge P.M. Groot P.H.E. VanBerkel T.J.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3117-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 47Linton M.F. Atkinson J.B. Fazio S. Science. 1995; 267: 1034-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). These data imply that serum apoE may have other functions that are unrelated to lipid metabolism. Indeed, initial data do indicate that apoE may have immunomodulatory functions (48Mistry M.J. Clay M.A. Kelly M.E. Steiner M.A. Harmony J.A.K. Cell Immunol. 1995; 160: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 49Roselaar S.E. Daugherty A. Circulation. 1997; 96 (abstr.): I-347Google Scholar, 50Laskowitz D.T. Goel S. Bennett E.R.

Matthew W.D. J. Neuroimmunol. 1997; 76: 70-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The present observations strongly suggest that we have now identified a protective role of apoE in Gram-negative sepsis. In conclusion, we postulate that in severe Gram-negative bacterial infection, a physiological increase in endogenous apoE forms a defense mechanism against the development of sepsis. If, withstanding this protection mechanism, the infection is not adequately neutralized, administration of exogenous apoE may be of highly therapeutic significance to overcome failure of this endogenous defense mechanism.

The condensin complex was originally identified and purified fromXenopus egg extracts and shown to have an ATP-dependent positive supercoiling activity in vitro. We report here the characterization of a human condensin complex purified from HeLa cell nuclear extracts. The human 13S complex has exactly the same composition as its Xenopuscounterpart, being composed of two structural maintenance of chromosomes (human chromosome-associated polypeptide (hCAP)-C and hCAP-E) subunits and three non-structural maintenance of chromosomes (hCAP-D2/CNAP1, hCAP-G, and hCAP-H/BRRN) subunits. Human condensin purified from asynchronous HeLa cell cultures fails to reconfigure DNA structure in vitro. When phosphorylated by purified cdc2-cyclin B, however, it gains the ability to introduce positive supercoils into DNA in the presence of ATP and topoisomerase I. Strikingly, human condensin can induce chromosome condensation when added back into a Xenopus egg extract that has been immunodepleted of endogenous condensin. Thus, the structure and function of the condensin complex are highly conserved betweenXenopus and humans, underscoring its fundamental importance in mitotic chromosome dynamics in eukaryotic cells.AF331796 13S condensin is a five-subunit protein complex that plays a central role in mitotic chromosome condensation.

Recent studies in Xenopus egg cell-free extracts led to the identification of a five-subunit protein complex, termed 13S condensin, that plays a key role in this process (3Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 449-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 4Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M.

TheXenopus 13S condensin complex is composed of two subcomplexes, an 8S core subcomplex (8SC)1 consisting of two structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) subunits (XCAP-C and -E) and an 11S regulatory subcomplex (11SR) containing three non-SMC subunits (XCAP-D2, -G, and -H) (3Hirano T.

Similar five-subunit complexes have also been identified from Schizosaccharomyces pombe (7Sutani T. Yuasa T. Tomonaga T. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yanagida M.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Each of the condensin subunits is essential for cell viability in yeasts, and their mutations lead to defects in chromosome condensation and segregation in mitosis (7Sutani T. Yuasa T. Tomonaga T.

Subunit composition of the putative condensin complex in human cells is not fully understood, although a complex containing hCAP-C, hCAP-E, and CNAP1 (homologous to XCAP-C, XCAP-E, and XCAP-D2, respectively) has been reported very recently (13Schmiesing J.A. Gregson H.C. Zhou S. Yokomori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6996-7006Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). 13S condensin, when purified from Xenopus egg mitotic extracts, displays a DNA-stimulated ATPase activity and changes DNA structure in an ATP-dependent manner in vitro. It introduces positive supercoils into relaxed circular DNA in the presence of type I topoisomerases (14Kimura K. Hirano T. Cell. 1997; 90: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and converts nicked circular DNA into positively knotted forms in the presence of a type II topoisomerase (15Kimura K. Rybenkov V.V. Crisona N.J. Hirano T. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 239-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The interphase form of 13S condensin lacks these activities, although its subunit composition is the same as that of the mitotic form. It was found that mitosis-specific phosphorylation of the non-SMC subunits by purified cdc2-cyclin B can activate the ATP-dependent activities of 13S condensin in vitro (5Kimura K. Hirano M. Kobayashi R. Hirano T. Science. 1998; 282: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 15Kimura K. Rybenkov V.V. Crisona N.J. Hirano T. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 239-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Moreover, the ability of 13S condensin to induce DNA supercoiling in the purified system is tightly coupled with its ability to promote chromosome condensation in the cell-free extracts (6Kimura K. Hirano T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11972-11977Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These results suggest strongly that the supercoiling and knotting activities are fundamental to condensin function and directly contribute to mitotic chromosome condensation. However, these in vitro activities have so far been detected only in theXenopus condensin complex purified from egg extracts. It is therefore very important to determine whether the functional, as well as structural, properties of the condensin complex are conserved in different organisms and at different developmental stages. In this paper, we report the purification of 13S condensin from HeLa cell nuclear extracts and describe its complete subunit composition. We show that the human complex displays ATP-dependent supercoiling and knotting activities that are regulated by phosphorylation by cdc2-cyclin B in vitro. Finally, a functional complementation assay demonstrates that the human condensin complex can induce chromosome condensation in Xenopus egg extracts. By searching the human expressed sequence tag (EST) data base, we identified a set of partial cDNA sequences that potentially encode the human ortholog of XCAP-G (AW503468, AW194979, AW401913, BE278549, AI628901, and AI761782). A nucleotide sequence assembled from these clones encoded a 768-amino acid polypeptide that is homologous to the C-terminal 3/4 of XCAP-G. The following two polymerase chain reaction primers were designed to amplify a human cDNA fragment using a λgt10 library as a template: 5hG1, 5′-CCCTCTAGAGCTATGCAGAAGCATCTTC-3′ (XbaI tag sequence is underlined); and 3hG1, 5′-TAGGATCCAGGGATATTGGGATTGTGGG-3′ (BamHI tag sequence is underlined). A resulting ∼530-base pair fragment was used as a hybridization probe to screen a HeLa cell cDNA library (Stratagene). Eight positive clones were analyzed, and seven of them were found to contain the full coding sequence. One of the full-length clones (pHG104) was fully sequenced. Rabbit polyclonal antisera were raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to the C-terminal sequences of hCAP-C (VAVNPKEIASKGLC; see Ref. 16Schmiesing J.A. Ball A.R. Gregson H.C. Alderton J.M.

After immunoaffinity purification of cohesin (18Losada A. Yokochi T. Kobayashi R. Hirano T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), 2 ml of the flowthrough fraction (equivalent to 9 × 108 cells) were incubated with 200 μg of anti-hCAP-G coupled to 200 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 4 °C for 1 h. The mixture was poured into a 2-ml column, washed consecutively with 80 column volumes of XBE2-gly (10 mm K-Hepes (pH 7.7), 100 mmKCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 10% glycerol), 10 volumes of XBE2-gly containing 400 mm KCl, and 10 volumes of XBE2-gly. To elute condensin from the column, the hCAP-G tail peptide was added at a final concentration of 0.4 mg/ml in XBE2-gly. The peak fractions were pooled (∼150 μl), supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml ovalbumin and 1 mm DTT, and concentrated 3-fold with Microcon-30 tubes (Amicon). This procedure yielded ∼1.5–2.0 μg of human condensin of >95% purity as judged by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). For phosphorylation, purified condensin (1 μg) was incubated at 22 °C for 30 min in 40 μl of phosphorylation buffer (XBE2-gly containing 1 mg/ml ovalbumin, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm MgATP) in the presence or absence of cdc2-cyclin B (1 ng) purified from Xenopus egg extracts (5Kimura K. Hirano M. Kobayashi R. Hirano T. Science. 1998; 282: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP (specific radioactivity of >5000 Ci/mmol) was added at a final concentration of 0.05 mCi/ml in the labeling reaction. For the rescue experiment (see Fig. 4), condensin was eluted in XBE6 (10 mm K-Hepes (pH 7.7), 100 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 50 mm sucrose) instead of XBE2-gly and concentrated in the same way. The amounts of purified complexes were determined by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue stain using bovine serum albumin as a standard.

A search of the human EST data base identified a set of partial cDNA sequences that potentially encode the human ortholog of XCAP-G, a 130-kDa subunit of theXenopus 13S condensin complex (4Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). On the basis of this information, we designed polymerase chain reaction primers, amplified a human cDNA fragment, and used it as a hybridization probe to screen a HeLa cell cDNA library. The longest open reading frame deduced from multiple clones encoded a 1,015-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 114.1 kDa, which was highly homologous to XCAP-G along its entire length (62% identical; 74% conserved). We named this polypeptide human chromosome-associated polypeptide-G (hCAP-G). Members of this class of condensin subunits had been reported from S. pombe (Cnd3; see Ref. 7Sutani T. Yuasa T. Tomonaga T. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2271-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and S. cerevisiae (Ycg1/Ycs5; see Refs. 8Freeman L. Aragon-Alcaide L. Strunnikov A.V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar and 12Ouspenski I.I. Cabello O.A. Brinkley B.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1305-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). An alignment of these sequences is shown in Fig. 1. We found that hCAP-G contains HEAT repeats, a highly degenerate repeating motif found in a number of proteins with diverse functions (19Andrade M.A. Bork P. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 115-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1,red rectangles). This is in agreement with our recent sequence analysis showing that each of the CAP-G family members has at least nine copies of this motif (20Neuwald A.F. Hirano T. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1445-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). During the preparation of this manuscript, the same human cDNA was cloned by serological screening in an attempt to identify melanoma antigens (21Jager D. Stockert E. Jager E. Gure A.O. Scanlan M.J. Knuth A. Old L.J. Chen Y.-T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3584-3591PubMed Google Scholar). Very recently, Schmiesing et al. (13Schmiesing J.A. Gregson H.C. Zhou S. Yokomori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6996-7006Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) reported a human protein complex that contains hCAP-C, hCAP-E, and CNAP1 (homologous to XCAP-D2; see Ref. 5Kimura K. Hirano M. Kobayashi R. Hirano T. Science. 1998; 282: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). It remains unknown, however, whether the complex also contains hCAP-G (this study) and BRNN (17Cabello O.A. Baldini A. Bhat M. Bellen H. Belmont J.W. Genomics. 1997; 46: 311-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) (homologous to XCAP-H; see Ref. 4Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). In this manuscript, we refer to CNAP1 and BRNN as hCAP-D2 and hCAP-H, respectively, in accordance with the nomenclature of theirXenopus orthologs. We raised a set of peptide antibodies against the putative subunits of human condensin (see “Experimental Procedures”). It was found that an hCAP-G antibody coimmunoprecipitates five discrete bands from a HeLa cell nuclear extract as judged by silver stain (Fig.2 A, lane 1). Immunoblotting analysis clearly showed that the five bands correspond to hCAP-C (170 kDa), -D2 (155 kDa), -E (135 kDa), -G (120 kDa), and -H (100–105 kDa) (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2–6). The stoichiometry of the five subunits was apparently ∼1:1:1:1:1, although hCAP-H always appeared as a fuzzy band (presumably because of multiple phosphorylation) as we had also observed for XCAP-H inXenopus egg extracts (4Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). When a HeLa nuclear extract was subject to sucrose gradient centrifugation, the five polypeptides cofractionated with a sedimentation coefficient of ∼13 S (Fig. 2 B, upper panel). A small fraction of hCAP-C and hCAP-E cosedimented at a second peak of ∼8 S, suggesting the presence of an SMC core subcomplex (8SC). These sedimentation properties of the human condensin subunits were very similar to those found in Xenopus egg extracts (4Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). In this experiment, we did not detect the presence of an 11SR consisting of the non-SMC subunits only (6Kimura K. Hirano T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11972-11977Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This was not surprising, however, because even in the Xenopus egg extracts this subcomplex is present at a very low level (∼1/10 of the 13S complex) and not detectable in the same assay (4Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). We then purified the human 13S complex by immunoaffinity column chromatography using the hCAP-G peptide antibody and fractionated it by sucrose gradient centrifugation (Fig. 2 B, lower panel). Again, all the five subunits cofractionated at a single peak of 13S, confirming that they tightly associate with each other and form a complex. Taking these results together, we conclude that the 13S holocomplex of human condensin has exactly the same size and subunit composition as itsXenopus counterpart. The Xenopus 13S condensin complex introduces positive supercoils into relaxed circular DNA in the presence of ATP and topoisomerase I in vitro (supercoiling assay; see Ref. 14Kimura K. Hirano T. Cell. 1997; 90: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). It also converts nicked circular DNA into positively knotted forms in the presence of ATP and topoisomerase II (knotting assay; see Ref. 15Kimura K. Rybenkov V.V. Crisona N.J. Hirano T. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 239-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The two activities are regulated by mitosis-specific phosphorylation of the non-SMC subunits (5Kimura K. Hirano M. Kobayashi R. Hirano T. Science. 1998; 282: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 15Kimura K. Rybenkov V.V. Crisona N.J. Hirano T. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 239-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We wished to test whether human condensin displays a similar set of activities. When the complex was affinity-purified from a nuclear extract of an asynchronously grown HeLa cell culture (Fig.3 A, lane 1), it exhibited little activity in the supercoiling and knotting assays (Fig.3 B, lanes 1–4). We reasoned that most of the purified complexes were in the interphase (unphosphorylated) form, thereby producing the negative result. To test this possibility, the purified condensin fraction was treated with cdc2-cyclin B (Fig.3 A, lane 2). This treatment phosphorylated the three non-SMC subunits, hCAP-D2, hCAP-G, and hCAP-H, as judged by [32P] labeling (Fig. 3 A, lane 4). Remarkably, we found that the phosphorylated form of condensin was active in both of supercoiling and knotting assays (Fig. 3 B,lanes 5–8). Neither of these activities was found in the purified cdc2-cyclin B fraction alone. The apparently less effective stimulation of the knotting activity compared with the supercoiling activity (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4 and 8) is probably because of the less quantitative nature of the former assay; a similar observation was made with Xenopus condensin (15Kimura K. Rybenkov V.V. Crisona N.J. Hirano T. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 239-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). As expected, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the final products of the supercoiling assay were positively supercoiled (data not shown). These results show that the human condensin complex displays the same set of biochemical activities as itsXenopus counterpart. The cdc2-mediated stimulation of these activities also suggests that they contribute directly to mitosis-specific condensation of chromosomes in human somatic cells. To further test for the functional similarity between the human and Xenopus condensin complexes, we set up a complementation assay in Xenopus egg extracts. When sperm chromatin was incubated in a control extract containing endogenous condensin (Fig. 4 A, lane 1), it was converted into a mass of mitotic chromosomes (Fig.4 B, panel a). In a condensin-depleted extract (Fig. 4 A, lane 2), however, no chromosome assembly occurred (Fig. 4 B, panel b). When purified Xenopus condensin (Fig. 4 A, lane 3) was added back into the extract, it restored the ability of the extract to condense chromosomes (Fig. 4 B, panel c) as we reported previously (4Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 6Kimura K. Hirano T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11972-11977Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Strikingly, we found that human condensin purified from a HeLa nuclear extract (Fig.4 A, lane 4) could also functionally complement the extract, inducing chromosome condensation very effectively (Fig.4 B, panel d). No pre-treatment with cdc2-cyclin B was required in this assay, suggesting that the human complex was phosphorylated by a protein kinase(s) present in the Xenopusegg extract and converted into an active complex. In summary, the current work identifies, for the first time, all the five subunits of the 13S condensin complex purified from HeLa cells. Like Xenopus condensin, the human complex displays ATP- and phosphorylation-dependent supercoiling and knotting activities in vitro, providing strong lines of evidence that they are fundamental to condensin function (and thereby mitotic chromosome condensation), not only in early embryonic cells but also in somatic cells.

We undertook experiments to clarify the functional relationship between the small Mafs and their partners in vivo. Embryos expressing abundant transgene-derived MafK died of severe anemia, while lines expressing lower levels of small Maf lived to adulthood. Megakaryocytes from the latter overexpressing lines exhibited reduced proplatelet formation and MARE-dependent transcription, phenocopying mafG null mutant mice. When the mafG null mutants were bred to small Maf-overexpressing transgenic animals, both loss- and gain-of-function phenotypes were reversed. These results provide direct in vivo evidence that transcriptional regulation through MARE elements hinges on an exquisitely sensitive balance of activating CNC molecules and their small Maf partners."
https://openalex.org/W2097955448,"POU domain proteins contain a bipartite DNA binding domain divided by a flexible linker that enables them to adopt various monomer configurations on DNA. The versatility of POU protein operation is additionally conferred at the dimerization level. The POU dimer formed on the PORE (ATTTGAAATGCAAAT) can recruit the transcriptional coactivator OBF-1, whereas POU dimers formed on the consensus MORE (ATGCATATGCAT) or on MOREs from immunoglobulin heavy chain promoters (AT[G/A][C/A]ATATGCAA) fail to interact. An interaction with OBF-1 is precluded since the same Oct-1 residues that form the MORE dimerization interface are also used for OBF-1/Oct-1 interactions on the PORE. Our findings provide a paradigm of how specific POU dimer assemblies can differentially recruit a coregulatory activity with distinct transcriptional readouts."
https://openalex.org/W77858255,"While cytoplasmic PI3Kinase (PI3K) is well characterized, regulation of nuclear PI3K has been obscure. A novel protein, PIKE (PI 3K inase E nhancer), interacts with nuclear PI3K to stimulate its lipid kinase activity. PIKE encodes a 753 amino acid nuclear GTPase. Dominant-negative PIKE prevents the NGF enhancement of PI3K and upregulation of cyclin D1. NGF treatment also leads to PIKE interactions with 4.1N, which has translocated to the nucleus, fitting with the initial identification of PIKE based on its binding 4.1N in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Overexpression of 4.1N abolishes PIKE effects on PI3K. Activation of nuclear PI3K by PIKE is inhibited by the NGF-stimulated 4.1N translocation to the nucleus. Thus, PIKE physiologically modulates the activation by NGF of nuclear PI3K."

Therefore, the balance between protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatase activities is thought to be important in the modulation of insulin signaling in insulin-resistant states. We thus employed the adenovirus-mediated gene transfer technique, and we analyzed the effect of overexpression of a wild-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP1B) on insulin signaling in both L6 myocytes and Fao cells. In both cells, PTP1B overexpression blocked insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRS-1 by more than 70% and resulted in a significant inhibition of the association between IRS-1 and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt phosphorylation as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation. Moreover, insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis was also inhibited by PTP1B overexpression in both cells. These effects were specific for insulin signaling, because platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-stimulated PDGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and Akt phosphorylation were not inhibited by PTP1B overexpression. The present findings demonstrate that PTP1B negatively regulates insulin signaling in L6 and Fao cells, suggesting that PTP1B plays an important role in insulin resistance in muscle and liver.

The activated insulin receptor binds to insulin receptor substrates (IRSs)1 via the YMXM motif, and IRSs are also phosphorylated on tyrosine residues (1White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tyrosine-phosphorylated IRSs activate their downstream signaling molecules, such as phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and p21ras. Since tyrosine phosphorylation is essential for insulin signaling, the balance of activities between protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPase) appears to be very important for the effects of insulin. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that PTPase activity is increased in insulin-resistant states such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. It has been reported that obese human subjects have increased PTPase activity in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue (2Ahmad F. Azevedo J.L. Cortright R. Dohm G.L. Goldstein B.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 3Ahmad F. Considine R.V. Goldstein B.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2806-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and a 10% body weight reduction causes a decrease in overall adipose tissue PTPase activity with enhanced insulin sensitivity (4Ahmad F. Considine R.V. Bauer T.L. Ohannesian J.P. Marco C.C. Goldstein B.J. Metabolism. 1997; 46: 1140-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Furthermore, insulin infusion in vivo produces a rapid 25% suppression of soluble PTPase activity in muscles of insulin-sensitive subjects, but this response is severely impaired in subjects who are insulin-resistant (5McGuire M.C. Fields R.M. Nyomba B.L. Raz I. Bogardus C. Tonks N.K. Sommercorn J. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 939-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Moreover, increased PTPase activity is also observed in the liver (6Meyerovitch J. Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 976-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and skeletal muscle (7Ahmad F. Goldstein B.J. Metabolism. 1995; 44: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) of diabetic rats. Taken together, abnormalities of PTPase activity are thought to be important to understand the molecular mechanism of insulin resistance. Previous studies showed that the tandem domain transmembrane enzymes, leukocyte antigen-related and leukocyte common antigen-related phosphatase/RPTPα, and the intracellular, single domain enzymes, protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP1B) and SHP2 are candidate PTPases for the regulation of the insulin signaling pathway. In particular, PTP1B directly interacts with the activated insulin receptor (8Seely B.L. Staub P.A. Reichart D.R. Berhanu P. Milarski K.L. Raltiel A.R. Kusari J. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and exhibits the highest specific activity toward IRS-1 (9Goldstein B.J. Bittner-Kowalczyk A. White M.F. Harbeck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4283-4289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). We have also reported that exposing Rat 1 fibroblasts expressing human insulin receptors to a high glucose condition impairs insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRS-1 due to the increased PTP1B expression and activity (10Maegawa H. Ide R. Hasegawa M. Ugi S. Egawa K. Iwanishi M. Kikkawa R. Shigeta Y. Kashiwagi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7724-7730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of PTP1B by the electroporation method reduces the level of GLUT4 on the cell surface in primary cultured rat adipose cells (11Chen H. Wertheimer S.J. Lin C.H. Katz S.L. Amrein K.E. Burn P. Quon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8026-8031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is reported that mice lacking theptp1b gene show increased insulin sensitivity and resistance to high fat diet-induced obesity, which is supported by enhanced insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRS-1 in muscle and liver (12Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1905) Google Scholar). Thus, PTP1B appears to play an important role in the regulation of insulin signaling. In the present study, we employed the adenovirus-mediating gene transfer technique, and we analyzed the effect of PTP1B overexpression on insulin signaling in model cells of insulin target tissues, such as L6 myocytes and Fao cells. In both cells, PTP1B overexpression markedly inhibited insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRS-1 and resulted in a significant inhibition of the association between IRS-1 and the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase and Akt phosphorylation as well as MAP kinase phosphorylation. Moreover, glycogen synthesis was also inhibited under both basal and insulin-stimulated conditions. The present findings demonstrate that PTP1B negatively regulates insulin signaling in muscle and liver cells. Human insulin was provided by Lilly. Anti-PTP1B antibody, anti-IRS-1 antibody, and anti-p85 N-SH2 antibody were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-phospho-Akt antibody and anti-phospho-MAP kinase antibody were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated phosphotyrosine antibody (RC20H) and insulin receptor antibody were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies, anti-ERK2 antibody, anti-Akt1 antibody, and anti-PDGF receptor antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's (DME) medium and fetal calf serum (FCS) were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All radioisotopes were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. XAR-5 film was obtained from Eastman Kodak Co. All other reagents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma. L6 cells, which were provided by Dr. A. Klip (The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada), were grown and maintained in minimum Eagle's medium-α containing 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FCS in a 5% CO2 environment. The cells were reseeded in the appropriate culture dishes and, after reaching subconfluency, the medium was changed to minimum Eagle's medium-α containing 2% FCS. The medium was then changed every 2 days until the cells were fully differentiated, typically after 5 days. Fao cells, which were from Dr. C. R. Kahn (Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA), were grown and maintained in DME medium containing 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FCS in a 5% CO2 environment. Prior to experimentation, the cells were trypsinized and reseeded in the appropriate culture dishes. The Ad-E1A-transformed human embryonic kidney cell line 293 was cultured in DME high glucose medium containing 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FCS in a 5% CO2 environment. The recombinant adenovirus containing PTP1B cDNA was generated as described previously (13Wang J. Cheung A.T. Kolls J.K. Bryer-Ash M. Diabetes. 1999; 48 Suppl. 1: 328Google Scholar). 2J. Wang, A. T. Cheung, J. K. Kolls, W. W. Starks, A. Martinez, D. Dietzen, and M. Bryer-Ash, manuscript in preparation. PTP1B wild-type cDNA was subcloned into pACCMVpLpASR(+) plasmid (14Gluzman Y. Reichl H. Solnick D. Gluzman Y. Eucaryotic Viral Vectors. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 187-192Google Scholar). This plasmid contains 1.3 map units of adenovirus 5 (Ad5) left end, cytomegalovirus early promoter, PUC19 polylinker site, and SV40 poly(A) signal sequences, followed by map units 9–18 of the Ad5 genome. The resulting recombinant plasmid was then cotransfected into 293 packaging cells with pJM17 plasmid (15McGrory W.J. Bautista D.S. Graham F.L. Virology. 1988; 163: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), which carriers Ad5 genomic DNA and propagated as described previously (16Kolls J. Peppel K. Silva M. Beutler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Mature recombinant Ad5 encoding PTP1B wild type was thus generated after in vivo homologous recombination between these two plasmids. Since 293 cells were originally derived from adenovirus transformation, the missing E1 gene function of pJM17 was provided in trans. The resulting recombinant virus containing the PTP1B was denoted as Ad5-PTP1B and was replication-defective (at least in cells lacking the E1 region of the adenovirus) but fully infectious. L6 myocytes and Fao cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10–50 plaque formation units/cell for 1 or 2 h with stocks of either a control recombinant adenovirus (Ad5-ctrl) containing the cytomegalovirus promoter, pUC 18 polylinker, a fragment of the SV40 genome, or the recombinant adenovirus containing PTP1B (Ad5-PTP1B). Transduced cells were incubated for 56 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and appropriate medium with 2% heat-inactivated serum, followed by incubation in the starvation media required for the assay. The efficiency of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer was ∼90% as measured by immunocytochemistry. Ad5-ctrl- or Ad5-PTP1B-infected cells were starved for 16 h in DME regular glucose medium with 0.05% FCS. The cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml insulin for 5–10 min at 37 °C and lysed in a solubilizing buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaF, pH 7.5, for 30 min at 4 °C. The cell lysates were centrifuged to remove insoluble materials. For Western blot analysis, whole cell lysates (20 μg of protein per lane) were denatured by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting in Towbin buffer containing 20% methanol. For immunoblotting, membranes were blocked and probed with specified antibodies. Blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked second antibody followed by chemiluminescence detection, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Glycogen synthase activity was determined as described previously (17Egawa K. Sharma P.M. Nakashima N. Huang Y. Huver E. Boss G.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14306-14314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Differentiated L6 myocytes were infected with Ad5-PTP1B or Ad5-ctrl at 50 m.o.i. for 1 h and grown in medium containing heat-inactivated serum (2%) for 72 h. The cells were serum- and glucose-starved in DME with no glucose, 0.1% BSA, 2 mm pyruvate medium for 3 h and then stimulated with or without 200 ng/ml insulin for 30 min in 5 mm glucose containing medium. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline three times, scraped in the buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm KF, pH 7.4, and sonicated. After centrifugation, the protein concentration was measured. 10 μg of protein was used to determine the ability to stimulate incorporation of [14C]UDP-glucose into glycogen in the presence or absence of glucose 6-phosphate. Glycogen synthesis was measured as described previously (18Maegawa H. Kobayashi M. Ishibashi O. Takata Y. Shigeta Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: E616-E623PubMed Google Scholar) with some modification. Fao cells were infected with Ad5-PTP1B or Ad5-ctrl at 10 m.o.i. for 2 h and grown in medium containing 2% heat-inactivated serum for 56 h. The cells were serum-starved for 16 h, and the medium was then replaced with DME medium containing 1% BSA. The cells were incubated with [14C]glucose (0.4 μCi/well) and 100 ng/ml insulin for 2 h in a CO2 incubator, washed with phosphate-buffered saline 3 times, and lysed with 2 n NaOH at 55 °C. The synthesized [14C]glycogen was precipitated with cold glycogen in 66% ethanol and washed, and the radioactivity was measured. The values are expressed as mean ± S.E., unless otherwise stated. Scheffe's multiple comparison test was used to determine the significance of any differences among more than three groups. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Differentiated L6 myocytes and Fao cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing wild-type PTP1B as described under “Experimental Procedures”. Following 72 h of incubation, the cells were lysed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-PTP1B antibody (Fig. 1). Small amounts of endogenous PTP1B were observed in both cell lines. PTP1B was expressed in a dose-dependent manner in each cell line. Total phosphatase activity also increased dose-dependently in PTP1B overexpressing cells as reported previously2 (13Wang J. Cheung A.T. Kolls J.K. Bryer-Ash M. Diabetes. 1999; 48 Suppl. 1: 328Google Scholar) (data not shown). The infected cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml insulin for 5 min and lysed. The cell lysates (200–500 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with anti-insulin receptor antibody or anti-IRS-1 antibody. The immunocomplexes were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRS-1 were decreased more than 70% in the Ad5-PTP1B infected cells in both cell lines (Fig.2, A, C, F, G, I, andL). The membranes were stripped and reblotted with anti-p85 antibody. The association between IRS-1 and the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase also decreased in PTP1B overexpressing cells (Fig. 2,D and J) and paralleled the reduction of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2, C and I). Next, we studied the downstream signaling of PI 3-kinase. Either PTP1B expressing L6 myocytes or Fao cells were stimulated with insulin for 10 min, lysed, and analyzed by Western blotting with phospho-specific Akt antibody (Fig. 3). Overexpression of PTP1B almost completely inhibited insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation in both cell lines. Phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase, which is another downstream molecule of PI 3-kinase, was also decreased by PTP1B overexpression (data not shown). Differentiated L6 myocytes were infected with PTP1B and control adenoviruses at 50 m.o.i. for 1 h. Following 72 h of incubation, the cells were serum- and glucose-starved for 3 h and stimulated with 200 ng/ml of insulin for 30 min. Overexpression of PTP1B almost completely inhibited insulin-stimulated glycogen synthase activity (control 2.51 ± 0.29% versus PTP1B 1.55 ± 0.19%, p < 0.02, Fig.4). Next, we examined [14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen in Fao cells. The adenovirus-infected Fao cells were incubated with insulin and [14C]glucose for 2 h, and glycogen synthesis was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 5, overexpression of PTP1B inhibited glycogen synthesis at both basal (control 126.4 ± 0.99% versus PTP1B 88.5 ± 7.24%, p < 0.01) and insulin-stimulated conditions (control 190.9 ± 6.93 versus PTP1B 121.9 ± 7.80,p < 0.001). The PTP1B expressing cells were stimulated with insulin for 10 min, lysed, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-phospho-specific MAP kinase antibody (Fig.6). PTP1B expression totally inhibited insulin-stimulated MAP kinase phosphorylation in both cell lines. Finally, we examined the effects of PTP1B on platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling. Either Ad5-ctrl- or Ad5-PTP1B-infected L6 myocytes were stimulated with 30 ng/ml PDGF for 5 min, lysed, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody or anti-phospho-specific Akt antibody (Fig. 7). PTP1B expression did not affect either PDGF-induced PDGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation or Akt phosphorylation. Thus, the observation concerning PTP1B overexpression appears to be specific for insulin signaling. We previously reported that exposing Rat 1 fibroblasts expressing human insulin receptors to high glucose conditions impaired the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRS-1 due to the increased expression and activity of PTP1B (10Maegawa H. Ide R. Hasegawa M. Ugi S. Egawa K. Iwanishi M. Kikkawa R. Shigeta Y. Kashiwagi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7724-7730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). More direct evidence has shown that overexpression of PTP1B reduced the level of GLUT4 on the cell surface in primary cultured rat adipose cells (11Chen H. Wertheimer S.J. Lin C.H. Katz S.L. Amrein K.E. Burn P. Quon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8026-8031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported (12Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1905) Google Scholar) that the PTP1B knockout mice showed increased insulin sensitivity and resistance to high fat diet-induced obesity with enhanced insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRS-1 in muscle and liver. However, in those mice, insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRS-1 in adipose tissue was not affected. Another study also showed that increased insulin sensitivity in PTP1B-deficient mice was tissue-specific, as insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was elevated in skeletal muscle, whereas adipose tissue was unaffected (19Klaman L.D. Boss O. Peroni O.D. Kim J.K. Martino J.L. Zabolotny J.M. Moghal N. Lubkin M. Kim Y. Sharpe A.H. Stricker-Krongrad A. Shulman G.I. Neel B.G. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5479-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that overexpression of PTP1B decreased insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRS-1 by about 50% but did not affect the glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (20Venable C.L. Frevert E.U. Kim Y. Fischer B.M. Kamatkar S. Neel B.G. Kahn B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18318-18326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of PTP1B for insulin effects appears to be tissue-specific. In the current studies, we overexpressed PTP1B wild-type in L6 myocytes and Fao cells using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to analyze the effect of PTP1B on insulin signaling. PTP1B overexpression markedly inhibited insulin-stimulated MAP kinase phosphorylation, Akt phosphorylation, and glycogen synthesis in both L6 myocytes and Fao cells with marked inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRS-1. These inhibitory effects were specific for insulin signaling, because PTP1B overexpression did not affect PDGF-stimulated phosphorylation of PDGF receptor and Akt (Fig. 7). Similar to data derived from animal studies, the inhibitory effects of PTP1B on insulin signaling appears cell type-specific. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, PTP1B overexpression inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRS-1 by about 50%, but Akt phosphorylation and glucose uptake were intact (20Venable C.L. Frevert E.U. Kim Y. Fischer B.M. Kamatkar S. Neel B.G. Kahn B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18318-18326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRS-1 were greater in L6 myocytes and Fao cells, so this may be one explanation for the different effects of PTP1B among these cells. It has been reported that PTP1B anchors to the endoplasmic reticulum and is activated after release into the cytosol by truncation of its COOH terminus (21Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A. Neel B.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 545-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 22Frangioni J.V. Oda A. Smith M. Salzman E.W. Neel B.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4843-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Localization of overexpressed PTP1B may be different in each cell line. Another explanation for these findings may be the different expression levels of endogenous PTP1B. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, PTP1B may not play an important role because its expression level is relatively low, and other phosphatases may be important. Thus, overexpression of PTP1B might show smaller effects than in L6 and Fao cells. In L6 myocytes and Fao cells, both insulin-stimulated MAP kinase phosphorylation and PI 3-kinase pathway were inhibited by PTP1B overexpression. However, only insulin-stimulated MAP kinase phosphorylation was significantly blocked by PTP1B overexpression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (20Venable C.L. Frevert E.U. Kim Y. Fischer B.M. Kamatkar S. Neel B.G. Kahn B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18318-18326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This difference may be able to explain the cell type specificity of PTP1B effects. Adenovirus-mediated liver-specific PTP1B overexpression in rats did not cause insulin resistance in the recent study by Wang et al.2 The reason for this difference between in vivo and in vitro study is unclear. One possible explanation is the difference of the expression level. PTP1B overexpression was increased by about 2–3-fold in the liver of the rats in this study, whereas it was increased by 20–30 times in our cells. PTP1B overexpression showed different effects among L6 myocytes, Fao cells, and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. PTP1B caused insulin resistance in muscle and liver cells but had small effects in adipocytes (20Venable C.L. Frevert E.U. Kim Y. Fischer B.M. Kamatkar S. Neel B.G. Kahn B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18318-18326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) in the culture system, similar to the observation of the PTP1B knockout mice (12Elchebly M. Payette P.

It was reported that insulin signaling was impaired in muscle but was not in liver of IRS-1 knockout mice by rescuing up-regulated IRS-2 expression (23Yamauchi T. Tobe K. Tamemoto H. Ueki K. Kaburagi Y. Yamamoto-Honda R. Takahashi Y. Yoshizawa F. Aizawa S. Akamuma Y. Sonenberg N. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3074-3084Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), but the disruption to the irs-2 gene in mice caused severe insulin resistance in the liver (24Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was reported that IRS-3 plays an important role in adipose tissue of IRS-1 knockout mice (25Kaburagi Y. Satoh S. Tamemoto H. Yamamoto-Honda R. Tobe K. Veki K. Yamauchi T.

These findings demonstrate that specific molecules mediate insulin signaling in different tissues. RPTPα or another phosphatase might be important in adipose tissue. In conclusion, the present findings indicate that PTP1B negatively regulates insulin signaling in muscle and liver cells. Investigating the activity of PTP1B may be important in understanding the molecular mechanism of insulin resistance in the type 2 diabetic patients. We thank Dr. A. Klip (The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada) and Dr. C. R. Kahn (Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA) for donating L6 cells and Fao cells, respectively."

In vertebrate, this family comprises at least nine distinct members: BTG1,BTG2/TIS21/PC3, BTG3/ANA, TOB,TOB2, B9.10, PC3K, PC3B, and B9.15.

Furthermore, BTG2 expression is regulated by p53 and has been found to be involved in DNA damage-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest (8Rouault J.P. Falette N. Guéhenneux F. Guillot C. Rimokh R. Wang Q.

Rat BTG2, known as PC3 (for pheochromocytoma cell-3) was recently shown to inhibit S-phase entry in an Rb-dependent fashion, correlated with the inhibition of cyclin D1 expression (15Guardavaccaro D.

Therefore the authors suggest that PC3 may act as a transcriptional regulator of cyclin D1. These results support our previous work, indicating that BTG1 and BTG2 may play a role in transcription regulation. We have shown that these proteins associate physically and functionally with the homeoprotein HOXB9 and enhance HOXB9-mediated transcription (16Prévôt D. Voeltzel T. Birot A.M. Morel A.P.

In addition, we have demonstrated that both BTG1 and BTG2 interact with mCAF1 (17Rouault J.P. Prévôt D. Berthet C. Birot A.M. Billaud M. Magaud J.P. Corbo L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22563-22569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), whose yeast homolog is a component of the CCR4·NOT transcriptional complex, which can affect transcription either positively or negatively (18Liu H.Y. Badarinarayana V. Audino D.C. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1096-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The association of BTG1 with hCAF1, the human homolog of mCAF1, has been confirmed by a study (19Bogdan J.A. Adams-Burton C. Pedicord D.L. Sukovich D.A. Benfield P.A. Corjay M.H. Stoltenborg J.K. Dicker I.B. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) that showed that hCAF1 overexpression in different cell lines leads to a proliferation block, demonstrating its involvement in growth suppression. Furthermore, a search in GenBank with the hCAF1 cDNA sequence revealed sequence identity with a human cosmid (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession number AB020860), localized in the short arm of chromosome 8 at 8p21.3-p22, a region frequently deleted in numerous human tumors (20Verma R.S. Manikal M. Conte R.A. Godec C.J. Cancer Invest. 1999; 17: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Levy A. Dang U.C. Bookstein R.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3127-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). CAF1 was subsequently shown to interact with two other members of the BTG family, TOB and TOB2 (13Ikematsu N. Yoshida Y. Kawamura-Tsuzuku J. Ohsugi M. Onda M. Hirai M. Fujimoto J. Yamamoto T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7432-7441Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Recently, the paralog of thehCAF1 gene, hPOP2, has been identified (23Fidler C. Wainscoat J.S. Boultwood J. Genomics. 1999; 56: 134-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (EMBL/GenBank accession number AF053318). The authors mapped this gene on chromosome 5q31-q33 and suggested that hPOP2 might be the tumor suppressor gene associated with the development of the myelodysplastic (5q-) syndrome. The human POP2 protein was later described (under the name of CALIF) as interacting with hNOT2 and hNOT3, the human homologs of the yeast proteins involved in the formation of the CCR4·NOT complex (24Albert T.K. Lemaire M. van Berkum N.L. Gentz R. Collart M.A. Timmers H.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In other words, CAF1 and POP2 seem to be involved in transcriptional regulation, and both are localized on chromosome regions frequently deleted in human tumors. The structural and functional characterization of these genes should help to establish their role in transcription regulation and in tumorogenesis. In the present study, we demonstrate that POP2 protein, like CAF1, interacts with both BTG1 and BTG2, and we define their interaction regions. We also examine the expression of CAF1 and POP2, together with BTG1 and BTG2, in different human tissues. Finally, we present functional results indicating the involvement of these proteins in estrogen receptor α (ERα)-mediated transcription regulation. The cDNA encompassing the entirehPOP2 open reading frame, along with the 3′-nontranslated regions (NT) of hCAF1 and hPOP2 mRNA, were cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR. 1 μg of total RNA from a human lymphoblastoid cell line was reverse-transcribed using 100 ng of oligo(dT) as primer, following the Superscript 2 (Life Technologies, Inc.) protocol. One-tenth of this mixture was used as a template for PCR. 50 pmol of specific oligonucleotides were added, and the reaction was carried out following Promega's instructions, at an annealing temperature of 50 °C. The expected cDNAs were recovered, cloned, and sequenced. Sequences of the synthetic oligonucleotides used were as follows: hPOP2 3′: 5′-TAAGCACCACTCTGGGATCA-3′; hPOP2 5′: 5′-ACTTCTCAGGTTTCTTCAGG-3′; hCAF1 3′-NT 3′: 5′-AGTTTATCAAAATATTCAATGATG-3′; hCAF1 3′-NT 5′: 5′-TTGTATGGCCTTGGTTCTGG-3′; hPOP2 3′-NT 3′: 5′-ATGGAGTAGAGAAGTGGGAG-3′; hPOP2 3′-NT 5′: 5′-TGATCCCAGAGTGGTGCTTA-3′. To generate the bacterial expression vectors for BTG1, BTG2, and CAF1, their full-length coding sequences were inserted into the pGEX-ET expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in-frame with the glutationeS-transferase (GST) coding sequence. The pP1-CAT reporter plasmid contains the P1 promoter (nucleotides −900+13) of the humanERα gene fused to the CAT gene (25Treilleux Peloux N. Brown M. Sergeant A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1319-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The pERE-Luc, which contains three copies of the ERα consensus elements (ERE) upstream from the TATA box fused to the luciferase gene, was provided by V. Laudet (ENSL, Lyon, France). The pG4-TK-CAT reporter plasmid contains six GAL4 consensus elements upstream from the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter region, fused to the CATgene. All mammalian expression constructs used are derivatives of the SV40 promoter-driven expression vector pSG5 (Stratagene). The plasmid pSG5Flag was derived from pSG5 by insertion between the EcoRI and BamHI sites of an oligonucleotide containing the Flag peptide sequence (IBI Flag system; Eastman Kodak Co.) and a polylinker. The full-length BTG1cDNA and the fragments coding for the regions containing amino acids 1–96, 1–117, 1–126, and 38–171, obtained by PCR, were cloned in-frame with the Flag epitope to generate pSG5FlagBTG1, pSG5FlagBTG1/1–96, pSG5FlagBTG1/1–117, pSG5FlagBTG1/1–126, and pSG5FlagBTG1/38–171. pSG5FlagBTG1S159A and pSG5FlagBTG1ΔBoxB were obtained from pSG5FlagBTG1 by directed mutagenesis (USE mutagenesis kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), respectively, replacing the AGC codon (coding for serine 159) by a GCG (coding for alanine), and deleting bases 292–351, corresponding to Box B. pSG5FlagBTG1ML2, M3L2, ML1L2, and M3L1 were obtained from pSG5FlagBTG1 by the same technique, replacing, at one or both LXXLL sites (bases 130–144 and 280–294), one or three CTN codons (coding for leucine) by a GCG (coding for alanine). pSG5FlagCAF1 has been described (17Rouault J.P.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22563-22569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar); for pSG5FlagPOP2, the full-length hPOP2 coding sequence, amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR as described above, has been cloned in pSG5Flag vector. pSG5HEO has been described (26Tora L. Mullick A. Metzger D. Ponglikitmongkol M. Park I. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1981-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). All of the GAL4 fusion plasmids were obtained by subcloning the different coding regions from pSG5Flag vectors into the Gal4PolyII plasmid (27Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar) in-frame with the yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain coding sequence, as described (17Rouault J.P. Prévôt D. Berthet C.

The fragment corresponding to BTG1 amino acids 76–171, used to generate pGALBTG1/76–171, was obtained by digesting theBTG1 cDNA with BamHI. pVPBTG1, pVPBTG2, and pVPCAF constructs were obtained by cloning the respective coding regions in-frame with the VP16 transactivation domain coding sequence into the pSG5FNV vector, as already described (17Rouault J.P. Prévôt D. Berthet C. Birot A.M. Billaud M. Magaud J.P. Corbo L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22563-22569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The fragments coding for the regions containing amino acids 1–267 and 1–226 of CAF1 were obtained by digesting the 3′-end of CAF1 cDNA with the Bal31 exonuclease (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and then used to construct pVPCAF/1–267 and pVPCAF/1–226. The fragments coding for the regions containing amino acids 1–52 and 53–285 of CAF1 were obtained by digesting the CAF1 cDNA with EcoRI and then used to construct pVPCAF/1–52 and pVPCAF/53–285. pVPCAFΔ229–247 and pVPCAFΔ11–31 were obtained from pSG5FlagCAF by directed mutagenesis (USE mutagenesis kit), deleting, respectively, bases 724–780 (corresponding to amino acids 229–247) and 70–132 (corresponding to amino acids 11–31). The cloned products were verified by DNA sequencing, and the correct expression of all the proteins was checked. The plasmids used for transfection were prepared by the alkaline lysis method and purified by polyethylene glycol/LiCl. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and seeded at 2.5 × 105 cells/well in six-well microtiter plates 8 h prior to transfection. The transfected DNA included various amounts of reporter and expression vectors, as detailed in the figure legends, with 50 ng of the pCMV-βGAL plasmid as an internal control, in 5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 1 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). The amount of transfected SV40 promoter was kept constant by the addition of pSG5 to the transfection mixture. After 24 h, the cells were washed and treated, where necessary, with a medium containing 10 nm 17β-estradiol for 24 h. The transfected cells were washed and collected 48 h after transfection. CAT-ELISA and luciferase assay were performed using the CAT-ELISA kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the Luc Kit (Promega) following the manufacturers' instructions. The transfected cells were lysed in 0.150 ml of lysis buffer. The supernatants were assayed for CAT and luciferase protein production. All transfection data were normalized by β-galactosidase assays, quantified by o-nitrophenly β-d-galactopyranoside assay using a standard linear curve. Reporter activity was expressed as the ratio of fold induction to the activity of the reporter vector alone or as pg of CAT protein/ml of cell lysate. Each set of experiments was repeated at least three times, and similar results were obtained in each case. For protein expression assays, 50 μg of transfected HeLa cell lysate was subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gel. The separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) by electroblotting. Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto each lane, as measured by Bradford assay and confirmed by Red Ponceau staining of the transferred membrane. ERα was detected with an anti-human monoclonal antibody (HC-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins. The protein was visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), following the manufacturer's instructions. GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli DH5α, purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and quantified using the Bio-Rad method. SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining were used to confirm the integrity of the full-length fusion proteins. For in vitroprotein-protein interaction assays, 10 μg of GST and GST fusion proteins was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads in the binding buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% milk, 10% glycerol) and packed in minicolumns. 15 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins synthesized in vitro (TNT T7 Quick Kit, Promega) were suspended in the binding buffer and passed through GST-, GST-BTG1-, GST-BTG2-, or GST-CAF1-glutathione-Sepharose minicolumns. After washing, the retained proteins were eluted with 10 mmglutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, analyzed on a 12% SDS polyacrylamide gel, and visualized by autoradiography. For in vitroprotein-protein interaction assays, 5 μg of GST, GST-CAF1, or GST-FLRG purified proteins were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to membrane. After denaturation in 6 m and renaturation in 0.187 m guanidine-HCl in HB buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 5 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), the blots were saturated at 4 °C in buffer H (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 7.75 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 25 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1% milk), then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated ERα, synthesized in a reticulocyte lysate-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) in the presence or absence of 100 nm 17β-estradiol. After washing in buffer H for 1 h at 4 °C, the filters were dried and autoradiographed. The pre-made multi-tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were hybridized to the indicated32P-probes labeled by random priming (Rediprime kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). hCAF1 and hPOP2 proteins exhibit 76% sequence identity (see Fig.1 A), but their corresponding cDNA are divergent in the 5′- and 3′-nontranslated regions. To determine the tissue-specific patterns of CAF1 andPOP2 gene expression, Northern blots containing human RNA from various tissues were performed using specific probes corresponding to the 3′-nontranslated regions of each transcript. Transcripts of hCAF1 and hPOP2 were observed in a wide variety of tissues, with the highest levels for hCAF1, in the skeletal muscle, heart, and pancreas and for hPOP2, the heart and pancreas. A 2.4-kb mRNA species was detected with both the CAF1 and POP2 probes (see Fig.1 B). Besides the 2.4-kb transcript, the hCAF1probe also detected significant amount of a 4.3-kb transcript in the skeletal muscle and a 1.35-kb transcript, which was the most abundant in the testis and was not detected in the lung or brain (Fig.1 B). Both forms were absent in the stomach, small intestine, and thymus. The nature and function of these variant transcripts are still unknown. At the same time we monitored the expression ofBTG1 and BTG2 (see Fig. 1 B):BTG1 transcript was found, though at barely detectable levels, in most tissues assayed other than the pancreas, heart, and lung, unlike BTG2 expression, which was abundant in the majority of the tissues analyzed, less so in the brain, and absent from the liver and testis. Given that hPOP2 and hCAF1 exhibit 76% amino acid sequence identity, we next investigated whether hPOP2 interacted with BTG1 and BTG2. We also tested the possibility that hPOP2 could interact with CAF1.The hCAF1 and mCAF1 proteins have only one amino acid sequence difference (Fig.1 A), so we used CAF1 to indicate both human and mouse proteins. The cDNA encompassing the entire hPOP2 open reading frame was cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The interaction assay was performed in the mammalian two-hybrid system, as already described (17Rouault J.P. Prévôt D. Berthet C. Birot A.M. Billaud M. Magaud J.P. Corbo L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22563-22569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A both BTG1 and BTG2 interacted with hPOP2 in mammalian cells, but hPOP2 did not associate with CAF1. To verify that hPOP2 can interact directly with BTG1 and BTG2, we performed in vitro association assays with purified recombinant GST fusion proteins. GST-BTG1, GST-BTG2, and, as a control, GST alone, were coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled hPOP2. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the specific retention of hPOP2 was observed with the GST-BTG1 and GST-BTG2 beads, but not with the control GST beads. The incubation of GST-BTG1 and GST-BTG2 with [35S]methionine-labeled luciferase, used as a control, failed to show any specific interaction (Fig. 2 B). These results point to a direct physical interaction of hPOP2 with both BTG1 and BTG2 and indicate that POP2 does not interact with CAF1 and that it does not homodimerize (data not shown). Our previous studies indicated that BTG1 and BTG2 were able to interact with mCAF1 in yeast and in mammalian cells and that Box B was necessary to this interaction (17Rouault J.P. Prévôt D. Berthet C. Birot A.M. Billaud M. Magaud J.P. Corbo L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22563-22569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). More recent work has confirmed that BTG1 protein interacts with hCAF1 (19Bogdan J.A. Adams-Burton C. Pedicord D.L. Sukovich D.A. Benfield P.A. Corjay M.H. Stoltenborg J.K. Dicker I.B. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), but the authors indicate that this interaction is mediated by the phosphorylation of BTG1 Ser-159. To define further the BTG1 regions involved in the interaction with CAF1, we used the mammalian two-hybrid system, given that proteins are more likely to be appropriately modified post-transcriptionally and that the results are therefore more likely to represent biologically significant interactions. Several deletion mutants of BTG1, described in Fig.3 A, were fused to the DNA binding domain of the GAL4 protein and assayed for possible interaction with CAF1 fused to the VP16 transactivation domain (VP16CAF1) in HeLa cells (see Fig. 3 B). As expected, no interaction was found with the GALBTG1ΔBoxB chimera, lacking Box B (amino acids 98–117), whereas GALBTG1S159A, in which the BTG1 Ser-159 is mutated into Ala, did not prevent BTG1 interaction with CAF1. The results of this assay indicate that the phosphorylation of serine 159, unlike Box B, is not indispensable for BTG1-CAF1 interaction. In contrast to the results obtained with yeast (17Rouault J.P. Prévôt D. Berthet C. Birot A.M. Billaud M. Magaud J.P. Corbo L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22563-22569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the deletion mutant GALBTG1/1–117 was unable to interact with CAF1, showing that Box B is necessary but not sufficient for this interaction in HeLa cells. As the deletion mutant GALBTG1/1–126 was still able to interact with CAF1, we conclude that the interaction in question does not require the C terminus of BTG1 but is strictly dependent on the short sequence flanking Box B (amino acids 118–126), which is highly conserved between BTG1 and BTG2. The deletion mutant GALBTG1/38–171 did not interact with CAF1, showing that the N terminus of BTG1 is required for the interaction. This region (amino acids 1–38) is also involved in the interaction of both BTG1 and BTG2 with HOXB9 protein in yeast (16Prévôt D. Voeltzel T. Birot A.M. Morel A.P. Rostan M.C. Magaud J.P. Corbo L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 147-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and contains a short motif (EIAAAV) that is conserved in all the members of the BTG family. It is possible that this motif has some functional significance, at least in protein-protein interactions. All of the results obtained with the GALBTG1 chimeric mutants were confirmed in vitro, using a GST pull-down method with purified GST-CAF1 and35S-radiolabeled mutant BTG1 proteins (Fig. 3 D). We conclude that the interactions observed were direct and not modified by the presence of the GAL4 domain in the fusion proteins. Analysis of the interactions of the VP16POP2 chimeric protein with the GALBTG1 fusion mutants gave similar results (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the direct interaction of CAF1 and POP2 with BTG1 involve two regions of BTG1 (amino acids 1–38 and 98–126). As these two regions are highly conserved between BTG1 and BTG2, it is probable that they are also necessary for the interactions of CAF1 and POP2 with BTG2. Seeking then to delineate the regions of CAF1 which are important for its association with BTG1 and BTG2, we made a series of deletion constructs of CAF1 (Fig. 4 A). Using the mammalian two-hybrid assay (Fig. 4 B), we found that two regions, corresponding to residues 11–31 and 229–247, are important for the interaction between CAF1 and both BTG2 (Fig.4 B) and BTG1 (data not shown). None of the hybrid proteins activated expression of CAT reporter gene on its own. In fact, as described in our previous studies (17Rouault J.P. Prévôt D. Berthet C. Birot A.M. Billaud M. Magaud J.P. Corbo L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22563-22569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), CAF1 and BTG proteins do not seem to be capable of stimulating transcription when tethered to multimerized DNA sites through a GAL4 binding domain in HeLa cells. We confirmed all of these interactions by in vitro interaction using a GST pull-down assay, showing that the interactions observed in HeLa cells are direct (Fig. 4 D). As these regions are conserved between CAF1 and POP2, they are probably also involved in BTG-POP2 interactions. The fact that BTG1 and BTG2 interact with CAF1 and POP2, which are homologs of the yeast transcription factor yCAF1/POP2 and act as cofactors for HOXB9-mediated transcription (16Prévôt D. Voeltzel T. Birot A.M. Morel A.P. Rostan M.C. Magaud J.P. Corbo L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 147-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), supports the hypothesis that these proteins play a role in transcription regulation. In addition, BTG1 and BTG2 contain two copies of an LXXLL motif known as the NR (nuclear receptor) box (Fig. 6 A), which was identified as being essential for the interaction of a number of coactivators with nuclear receptors (29Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar). One motif (referred to below as L1) is located in the N-terminal part of the two proteins; the other motif (referred to below as L2) is located within the middle part, at the beginning of Box B, one of the two conserved domains that constitute the BTG family signature. These observations incited us to study the possible role of the BTG proteins in the transcriptional regulation of the nuclear receptors. We first focused on ERα because both BTG and ERα are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation: hormone binding to ERα induces conformational changes leading to the recruitment of transcriptional auxiliary factors, binding of ERα to EREs in gene promoters, and regulation of transcriptional activity of genes involved in proliferation, development, and differentiation (for review, see Refs.30Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar, 31Gronemeyer H. Laudet V. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 1173-1308"

While PTHrP is known to be a critical regulator of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, the signaling pathways through which this factor acts remain to be elucidated. Here we show that both cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and AP-1 activation are critical to PTHrP signaling in chondrocytes. PTHrP treatment leads to rapid CREB phosphorylation and activation, while CREB DNA binding activity is constitutive. In contrast, PTHrP induces AP-1 DNA binding activity through induction of c-Fos protein expression. PTHrP activates CRE and TRE reporter constructs primarily through PKA-mediated signaling events. Both signaling pathways were found to be important mediators of PTHrP effects on chondrocyte phenotype. Alone, PTHrP suppresses maturation and stimulates proliferation of the chondrocyte cultures. However, in the presence of dominant negative inhibitors of CREB and c-Fos, these PTHrP effects were suppressed, and chondrocyte maturation was accelerated. Moreover, in combination, the effects of dominant negative c-Fos and CREB are synergistic, suggesting interaction between these signaling pathways during chondrocyte differentiation.

During limb development, a cartilaginous template is formed from mesenchymal condensations that perform the skeletal elements (1Wright E. Hargrave M.R. Christiansen J. Cooper L. Kun J. Evans T. Gangadharan U. Greenfield A. Koopman P. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Subsequent longitudinal bone growth is dependent upon the process of endochondral ossification whereby chondrocytes sequentially proliferate and differentiate. Chondrocyte differentiation is marked by profound physical and biochemical changes, including a 5–10-fold increase in volume and expression of alkaline phosphatase and type X collagen (2Buckwalter J.A. Mower D. Ungar R. Schaeffer J. Ginsberg B. J. Bone Joint Surg. Am. Vol. 1986; 68: 55-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar,3Linsenmayer T.F. Chen Q.A. Gibney E. Gordon M.K. Marchant J.K. Mayne R. Schmid T.M. Development. 1991; 111: 191-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The process of chondrocyte differentiation culminates in calcification of the matrix and cellular apoptosis (4Gibson G.J. Kohler W.J. Schaffler M.B. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 5Hatori M. Klatte K.J. Teixeira C.C. Shapiro I.M. J. Bone Miner.

The calcified matrix subsequently serves as the template for primary bone formation. Endochondral ossification is regulated by local growth factors including PTHrP1, which has been defined as a critical regulator of the rate of endochondral ossification. Mice null for either PTHrP (7Karaplis A.C. Luz A. Glowacki J. Bronson R.T. Tybulewicz V.L. Kronenberg H.M. Mulligan R.C.

Science. 1996; 273: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar) display accelerated chondrocyte differentiation and therefore abnormal endochondral bone formation. In contrast, animals that overexpress PTHrP exhibit delay in chondrocyte terminal differentiation (9Weir E.C. Philbrick W.M. Amling M. Neff L.A. Baron R. Broadus A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10240-10245Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Humans with an activating mutation in the PTH/PTHrP receptor have Jansen's metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, characterized by disorganization of the growth plate and delayed chondrocyte terminal differentiation (10Schipani E. Lanske B. Hunzelman J. Luz A. Kovacs C.S. Lee K. Pirro A. Kronenberg H.M. Juppner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13689-13694Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Thus, PTHrP signaling is critical for normal growth plate morphology and function. PTHrP receptor activation stimulates both protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling. Activation of these signaling pathways mediates important effects and in chondrocytes PKA signaling is associated with proliferation, stimulation of proteoglycan synthesis, and inhibition of alkaline phosphatase activity (11Zuscik M.J. Puzas J.E. Rosier R.N. Gunter K.K. Gunter T.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 352-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PTHrP also stimulates phospholipase C activity with metabolism of membrane phospholipids and production of diacyl glycerol and inositol phosphate (12Zuscik M.J. Gunter T.E. Rosier R.N. Gunter K.K. Puzas J.E. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 13Segre G.V. Abou-Samra A.B. Juppner H. Schipani E. Force T. Urena P. Freeman M. Kong X.F. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Hock J. J. Endocrinol. Invest. 1992; 15: 11-17PubMed Google Scholar). Inositol phosphate stimulates the release of intracellular calcium stores while the regeneration of diacylglycerol leads to activation of protein kinase C. While much is known about the upstream signaling events immediately following receptor ligation, there is little information on the downstream transcription factors involved in mediating PTHrP effects in chondrocytes and their relationship with PKA and PKC signaling. One of the potential downstream signaling targets of PKA is the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) (14Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). This transcription factor is a CREB/ATF family member that is constitutively present in the nucleus. CREB binds to a DNA consensus cAMP response element (CRE) primarily as a homodimer, via a leucine zipper domain. CREB is activated by PKA-mediated phosphorylation within its P-box domain (15Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2067) Google Scholar), which permits its interaction with p300/CBP and other coactivators, leading to gene transcription. Thymocytes and T cells from transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative form of CREB specifically in these cells display a profound proliferative defect and G1cell-cycle arrest in response to a number of different activation signals (16Barton K. Muthusamy N. Chanyangam M. Fischer C. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). ATF-2 deficiency, another member of the CREB/ATF family, has been shown to induce chondrodysplasia and neurological abnormalities in mutant mice (17Reimold A.M. Grusby M.J. Kosaras B. Fries J.W. Mori R. Maniwa S. Clauss I.M. Collins T. Sidman R.L. Glimcher M.J. Glimcher L.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Although the role of CREB in cartilage development or bone formation has not been investigated, the finding that CREB KO mouse has a dwarf phenotype (18Rudolph D. Tafuri A. Gass P. Hammerling G.J. Arnold B. Schutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4481-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) combined with the established important role of CREB in PKA mediated events in other cells, suggests that this transcription factor may be involved in regulating some of the critical events in chondrocyte differentiation. PTHrP also activates the transcription factor AP-1, a complex formed through interactions between Fos and Jun family members (19Porte D. Tuckermann J. Becker M. Baumann B. Teurich S. Higgins T.

These interactions are also mediated by leucine zipper domains to form Fos/Jun heterodimers or Jun/Jun homodimers (21Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3285) Google Scholar). The protein complex binds to the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate response element (TRE), a specific cis-acting DNA consensus sequence in the promoter region of target genes. AP-1-regulated genes appear to have an important role in skeletal physiology. Transgenic mice overexpressing c-Fos develop bone and cartilaginous tumors (22Ruther U. Garber C. Komitowski D. Muller R. Wagner E.F. Nature. 1987; 325: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), while Fos-Jun double transgenic mice develop osteosarcomas at a higher frequency (23Wang Z.Q. Liang J.

Brakenhoff K.D. Quinn C.O. Partridge N.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1834-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and in chondrocytes PTHrP was found to increase c-Jun and JunD mRNA and protein levels (25Kameda T. Watanabe H. Iba H. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 495-503PubMed Google Scholar). AP-1 activation has been shown to be mediated by several different signaling pathways including PKA and PKC (26Anouar Y. Lee H.W. Eiden L.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,27White B.R. Duval D.L. Mulvaney J.M. Roberson M.S. Clay C.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 566-577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this work we have characterized CREB and c-Fos as two important regulators of cartilage development and have investigated their activation by PKA and PKC signaling. We have shown that their activation occurs rapidly in response to PTHrP stimulation and that interference with their function results in alteration of cartilage phenotype produced by PTHrP. This represents the first report documenting a critical role for CREB in cartilage development. Embryonic cephalic sternal chondrocytes (day 13) were prepared and cultured as described (28Leboy P.S. Vaias L. Uschmann B. Golub E. Adams S.L. Pacifici M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17281-17286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After isolation and primary culture for 5–7 days, floating cells were plated in secondary cultures at 2.5 × 105cells/cm2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% NuSerum IV (Collaborative Biomedical, Bedford MA), 4 units/ml hyaluronidase (Sigma), and 2 mml-glutamate (Sigma). After 6 days, upper sternal chondrocytes (USC) were harvested and plated in 6-well plates for the transient transfection assay and alkaline phosphatase or 60-mm dishes for Northern analysis. PTHrP (10−7m) was added to the cultures in some experiments. Cell were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice in Golden lysis buffer (29Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 μm microcysteine. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g. The protein concentration of the soluble material was estimated using Coomassie Plus Protein Assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). 25 μg of extracts was assayed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell), the blots were probed with the following antibodies: anti-CREB or anti-phospho-CREB antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) at a dilution 1:500, anti-c-Fos, anti-ATF-2, anti-CREM, and anti-ATF-1 (Santa Cruz) at a dilution 1:1000. In one case, the membrane was striped and reprobed with anti-β-actin (Sigma) in a dilution 1:8000 to serve as a loading control. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibodies (Bio-Rad) were used as secondary antibody. The immune complexes were detected using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nuclear protein extracts were prepared as previously described (30Schwarz E.M. Salgame P. Bloom B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7734-7738Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. 5 μg of this nuclear extracts from upper sternal chondrocytes treated with PTHrP for 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, or 4 h were incubated with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 2 ng of 32P-end-labeled CRE or TRE consensus oligos (Santa Cruz) and run on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. Supershifts were performed with antibodies specific for CREB/ATF and Fos/Jun family members. The incubation with antibodies was 20 min prior to the addition of oligonucleotides. For this set of experiments we have used Stratagene's Path detect in vivosignal transduction pathway reporting systems, which are a series of inducible reporter vectors that contain the firefly luciferase reporter gene driven by a basic promoter (TATA box) plus a defined inducible enhancer element: four repeats of CRE (CRE-Luc) or seven repeats of the TRE (TRE-Luc). The transfection efficiency was controlled for by co-transfecting pRL vector from Promega and determining theRenilla uniformis luciferase activity. The upper sternal chondrocytes were transiently transfected in serum-free media (supplemented with insulin and triiodothyronine) (31Volk S.W. Luvalle P. Leask T. Leboy P.S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) with these plasmids using the transfection reagent Fugene-6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Twelve hours after transfection, a PTHrP (10−7m) treatment was given to the cells for 24 h. Two plasmids expressing the PKA catalytic subunit and 360–672 amino acids from MEKK were used as positive controls for the CRE/TRE-Luc reporting systems, respectively. The following inhibitors purchased from Calbiochem were used: H-89, 10 μm for PKA inhibition, GO6976, 12 μm for PKC inhibition, 1 μm KN-93 for CaM kinase II, and 50 μmPD98059 for MEKK. We have also used a dominant negative CREB and c-Fos in the pRC-CMV vector, as previously described (32Ahn S. Olive M. Aggarwal S. Krylov D. Ginty D.D. Vinson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 967-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). In the co-transfection experiments 1 μg of reporter and 1 μg of dominant negative (or empty vector for control) were co-transfected in a ratio 1:3 with the transfection reagent. Other reporters used were c-Fos promoter and several cyclin D1 promoter constructs from Dr. R. Pestell (Albert Einstein College of Medicine). Constructs employed were the following: 1745-bp full-length cyclin D1 promoter, 66 bp of the promoter encompassing the CRE site situated at 52 bp and 1745 mut and 66 mut that have the CRE site mutated as previously described (33Brown J.R. Nigh E. Lee R.J. Ye H. Thompson M.A. Saudou F. Pestell R.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5609-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity in cell lysate was measured using Luciferase assay system (Promega) and an Optocomp luminometer (MGM Instruments). Chick embryonic fibroblasts grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.2% fetal chick serum and penicillin/streptomycin were transfected with the replication competent avian sarcoma virus RCASBP(A) alone and RCASBP(A) containing dominant negative c-Fos and CREB inserts. Cells were passaged three times to allow the spreading of the virus. At confluence, growth media was changed to low serum (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% NuSerum) for collection of virus. Viral supernatants were collected at 24-h intervals for 3 days. At the time of secondary plating, chondrocytes were incubated with fresh viral supernatant for 48 h followed by addition of PTHrP in some of the samples. Total RNA was extracted from cultures using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). 5 μg of the total RNA was run on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 17.5% formaldehyde and transferred to a GeneScreen Plus membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The RNA was UV cross-linked to the membrane. Northern analysis was performed using denaturing formaldehyde/agarose gels as described (34Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Sieman J.G. Smith J.A. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. J. Wiley, and Sons, New York1997Google Scholar). A synthetic type X oligonucleotide was end labeled as previously described (34Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Sieman J.G. Smith J.A. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. J. Wiley, and Sons, New York1997Google Scholar). Prehybridization was performed in QuickHyb solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for 20 min at 68 °C. Hybridization was done at 73 °C for 1 h. The blot was washed twice for 15 min with 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS, followed by a 30-min wash with 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS. The blot was exposed to X-Omat AR film (Kodak, Rochester, NY) for autoradiography. Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured as previously described (35O'Keefe R.J. Crabb I.D. Puzas J.E. Rosier R.N. J. Bone Joint Surg. Am. Vol. 1989; 71: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Culture medium was aspirated from chondrocytes cultured in 6-well plates, which then were rinsed with 150 mm NaCl. One ml of reaction buffer containing 0.25m 2-methyl-2-aminopropanol, 1 mmMgCl2, and 2.5 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) at pH 10.3 was added to the wells at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped after 30 min by the addition of 0.5 ml of 0.3 mNa3PO4 (pH 12.3). The alkaline phosphatase activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 410 nm by comparison with standard solutions of p-nitrophenol and an appropriate blank. Flow cytometry was performed using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter Calibur cytometer and the Cell Quest (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) plotting program. 2–3 × 106 cells were resuspended in 70% EtOH at 4 °C for at least 12 h. The cells were then resuspended in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mg/ml RNase and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Finally cells were stained with propidium iodide (10 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) and run through the flow cytometer. Chondrocytes plated at 200,000 cells/well in a 6-well plate were treated with PTHrP for 24 h and incubated with 2 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the last 4 h. Cells were washed with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid two times and then the cells were left in 0.5 ml of 1 n NaOH, 0.1% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C. 100-μl aliquots were added to 4 ml of Ecoscint fluid and assayed for 3H incorporation. Statistical comparisons were made between the groups using a way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Significance was considered present when the p value was less than 0.05 and is denoted in each of the figures. The effects of PTHrP stimulation on CREB/ATF activation were investigated in sternal chondrocytes at various times following treatment over a 2-h time course experiment. The level of CREB protein remained constant as determined by Western blotting (Fig.1 A). However, phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) levels were markedly increased following this treatment. The increase in pCREB was detectable within 5 min, maximal by 30 min, and returned to baseline levels 2 h after PTHrP stimulation (Fig.1 A). Following PTHrP stimulation, there was also an increase in c-Fos protein levels that was observed as early as 30 min, was maximal by 1 h, and returned to basal levels by 4 h (Fig.1 B). To determine the effect of PTHrP stimulation on CREB DNA binding activity in chondrocytes, gel mobility shift assays were performed. These experiments revealed minimal differences over a 4-h time course following PTHrP stimulation (Fig.2 A). To characterize this protein-DNA complex, supershift experiments using specific antibodies to members of the CREB/ATF family were performed. In this experiment, only CREB binding to this consensus sequence was detected (Fig.2 B), although ATF-2 and CREM proteins could be detected in these extracts by Western blot (Fig. 2 C). These findings suggest that CREB protein levels and DNA binding activity remain constant following PTHrP treatment. However, PTHrP may modulate gene expression in sternal chondrocytes by inducing CREB phosphorylation and therefore increasing its transcriptional activity.Figure 2PTHrP induces AP-1, but not CREB DNA binding activity. Nuclear extracts (5 μg/lane) obtained from USC stimulated with PTHrP for various time points, were incubated with or without anti-c-Fos antibody, followed by addition of a radioactive labeled consensus AP-1 probe (A). Nuclear extracts (5 μg/lane) from USC were also incubated with radioactively labeled CRE oligonucleotides and then gel shift assay was performed (A). Nuclear extracts (5 μg/lane) from USC were preincubated with antibodies against different CREB/ATF or Fos family members, before addition of radioactive labeled CRE or AP-1 oligonucleotides and then gel shift assay was performed (B). Western blots with antibodies against different CREB/ATF family members were done with whole cell lysates from USC (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess AP-1 activation following PTHrP stimulation, gel mobility shift assays were performed using a probe containing the TRE consensus sequence. PTHrP stimulated a marked increase in DNA binding (Fig.2 A). The increase was detectable at 30 min, peaked at 1 h, and remained elevated 4 h following PTHrP treatment. Addition of an antibody directed against c-Fos protein inhibited DNA binding (Fig. 2 A), showing the presence of c-Fos protein in the gel mobility shift complex, consistent with the increase in c-Fos protein expression observed on Western blot. In contrast, incubation with antibodies directed against Fra1, ATF-2, and CREM did not affect DNA binding (Fig. 2 B). To determine whether this apparent stimulation of CREB and AP-1 signaling is associated with an increase in gene transcription, sternal chondrocytes were transfected with CRE and TRE luciferase reporter constructs and treated with PTHrP (Fig.3). PTHrP (10−7m) treatment resulted in transcriptional activation of both the TRE (23-fold) and CRE (103-fold) constructs. As a positive control we co-transfected the reporter constructs with either activated MAPK kinase kinase (MEKK) or PKA constructs. In these experiments the MEKK construct was a more potent stimulator of the TRE reporter, while the PKA construct caused about a 40-fold stimulation of both the CRE and the TRE reporters (Fig. 3 A). These latter findings indicate the presence of cross-talk between these signaling pathways in chondrocytes following PTHrP stimulation. Furthermore, PKA signaling in these cells results in activation of both CRE and TRE mediated transcription. To determine the relative effects of the PKA, PKC, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and calmodulin kinase signaling pathways on CRE activation, the CRE reporter was transfected into sternal chondrocytes and the cultures were treated with PTHrP in the presence and absence of pharmacological inhibitors of these various pathways (Fig.3 B). Inhibition of PKA signaling with H89 resulted in a 95% inhibition of CRE activation, consistent with the role of PKA as a potent inducer of CREB phosphorylation. Inhibitors of PKC (GO6976, 45% inhibition), mitogen-activated protein kinase (PD98059, 27% inhibition), and calmodulin kinase (KN93, 17% inhibition) all had less potent effects. PKA inhibition also had the greatest effect on the TRE reporter (80% inhibition), while inhibition of MAP kinase signaling resulted in a 37.7% decrease in luciferase activity. In contrast, inhibition of PKC and calmodulin kinase did not affect PTHrP-mediated activation of the TRE reporter (Fig. 3 C). To confirm our findings regarding CREB and AP-1 transcriptional activation following PTHrP treatment, constructs expressing dominant negative c-Fos (AFOS) and CREB (ACREB) were each co-transfected into sternal chondrocytes with reporter constructs for the CRE and TRE (Fig.4). The ACREB construct completely inhibited CRE activation by PTHrP, while the AFOS construct did not inhibit PTHrP activation of the CRE (Fig. 4 A). Moreover, the AFOS construct induced an increase in the PTHrP stimulation of CRE reporter. A possible explanation for this finding is that AP-1 inhibition may result in greater availability of the transcriptional coactivator, CBP (CREB-binding protein), for CREB-mediated signaling. In contrast, both ACREB and AFOS constructs inhibited activation of the TRE reporter following stimulation by PTHrP (Fig. 4 B). Co-transfection of both constructs reduced the detectable luciferase activities to below basal levels. These findings further confirm PTHrP activation of PKA and phosphorylation of CREB, leading to CRE dependent transcription. In contrast, activation of AP-1 by CREB is likely indirect and may be mediated by stimulation of c-Fos transcription. To test this, a c-Fos promoter-reporter construct was transfected into sternal chondrocytes. PTHrP treatment resulted in a 91-fold stimulation in luciferase activity (Fig. 4 C). Co-transfection of these cultures with the ACREB construct blocked this PTHrP stimulation of the cFos promoter, while the AFOS construct had no effect, further supporting a model of PTHrP activation of AP-1 through CREB-dependent transcription of c-Fos. PTHrP regulates the rate of chondrocyte terminal differentiation. To see if PTHrP inhibits terminal differentiation through CREB or AP-1 signaling, we investigated the expression of markers of chondrocyte maturation, type X collagen (colX) mRNA expression, and alkaline phosphatase activity, in cell cultures following PTHrP treatment. Short-term experiments were performed using transiently transfected chondrocytes (2 days), while longer term experiments (7 days) were performed with chondrocytes infected with a replication competent retrovirus that permitted sustained expression in a larger percentage of cells. In the absence of PTHrP, ACREB, and AFOS had minimal effects in both the transiently transfected and retrovirally infected cultures (Fig.5, A and B). However, in the presence of PTHrP, transient transfection of ACREB and AFOS constructs stimulated type X collagen (colX) mRNA expression, 1.6- and 1.3-fold, respectively (Fig. 5 A), compared with vector-transfected control chondrocytes. These signaling pathways appeared to be synergistic, since co-transfection of both ACREB and AFOS resulted in even greater colX mRNA expression (5.2-fold). Effects of the dominant negative signaling molecules were much greater when the constructs were introduced by retroviral infection. Alone, both ACREB and AFOS infection resulted in a larger induction of colX in PTHrP-treated cultures compared with minimal increases in retroviral infected control samples (Fig. 5 B). In PTHrP-treated cultures, transient transfection with both ACREB and AFOS resulted in only small increases in alkaline phosphatase activity (data not shown). Much larger effects on alkaline phosphatase activity were observed when the cultures were infected with retroviral constructs, consistent with the findings observed with the other maturation marker, type X collagen. In the PTHrP-treated cultures, ACREB doubled and AFOS tripled alkaline phosphatase activity (Fig.6) compared with smaller increases in untreated samples (1.3- and 1.7-fold increases). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that PTHrP effects on maturation are mediated by both CREB and AP-1 signaling. Furthermore, while the findings suggest basal AP-1 and CREB signaling, these transcription factors are much more relevant in the presence of PTHrP. To evaluate the effects of PTHrP on proliferation, sternal chondrocytes were treated with PTHrP and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter 24 h latter (Table I). PTHrP treatment resulted in more than a 2-fold increase in the number of cells entering the cell cycle and undergoing DNA synthesis (S + G2 + M). Since cyclin D1 is a required for t"

DAG serves as an allosteric activator of classical and novel protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms that mediate many cellular responses, including cell growth and differentiation (29Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar, 30Michell R.H. Essays Biochem. 1997; 32: 31-47PubMed Google Scholar, 31Olson E.N. Burgess R. Staudinger J. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 699-705PubMed Google Scholar). PA has been suggested to participate in different cellular processes, such as cell proliferation and actin polymerization (32Cross M.J.

The intracellular level of these two lipids can also be modulated by the action of DGK, which generates PA by phosphorylation of DAG (35Sakane F. Kanoh H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1139-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 36Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol.

Lipids. 1999; 98: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although the role of DGK in signal transduction is poorly understood, it has been proposed that DGK activity might be involved in the attenuation of positive DAG signaling (38Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), as well as in the generation of PA for downstream intracellular events (39Flores I. Casaseca T. Martinez A.C. Kanoh H.

In the present work we have investigated the role of lipid second messengers in the cellular response to hypoxia and their involvement in the regulation of HIF-1-dependent transcription. Previous reports have shown that cellular exposure to hypoxia induces the intracellular accumulation of DAG (43Goldberg M. Zhang H.L. Steinberg S.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 44Yoshioka K. Clejan S. Fisher J.W. Life Sci. 1998; 63: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Herein we show that exposure to hypoxia also results in a marked accumulation of the intracellular level of PA through the action of DGK. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of DGK activity with the specific DGK inhibitors R59949 and R59022 prevents HIF-1-dependent transcription due to a reduction of hypoxia-induced HIF-1-DNA complex formation, as well as HIF-1α subunit transactivation activity. These results demonstrate for the first time that PA generation through DGK is part of the cellular response to hypoxia and provide evidence for an essential role of this lipid kinase in the signal transduction pathway that culminates in the activation of HIF-1. [32P]Orthophosphate (carrier free) and [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 3000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Silica gel thin layer chromatography plates (60 Å, LK6D) were from Whatman (Clifton, NJ). DGK inhibitor I (R59022) and DGK inhibitor II (R59949) were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). The authentic phospholipid standards 1,2-dioleoylglycerol and 1,2-dioleoyl phosphatidic acid were from Sigma, and phosphatidylbutanol (PBut) was from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was from Sigma. Analytic grade organic solvents for TLC were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). HeLa cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with GLUTAMAX-I (Life Technologies Ltd.), whereas 293-T and Hep3B cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany) in the presence of 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Labtech International Ltd., Woodside, United Kingdom). Cells were routinely cultured in 95% air/5% CO2 (normoxic conditions) at 37 °C. To expose cells to hypoxia, they were placed into an airtight chamber with inflow and outflow valves that was infused with a mixture of 1% O2, 5% CO2, 94% N2 (S.E. Carburos Metalicos S.A., Madrid, Spain) for 30 min. In all experiments, cells were plated at 70–90% confluency, and when cells were completely attached, after 3–4 h in the case of HeLa cells or after 12–14 h in the case of 293-T and Hep3B cells, they were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia in the presence or in the absence of R59949 or R59022. The cellular incubation with both DGK inhibitors was performed in serum-free medium because this compound is inactive in the presence of serum (40Flores I. Jones D.R. Cipres A. Diaz-Flores E. Sanjuan M.A. Merida I. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 708-714PubMed Google Scholar). All other experiments were performed using 10% fetal calf serum-supplemented medium. Cells were cultured in phosphate-free medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (extensively dialyzed against 0.9% (w/v) NaCl) for 90 min before the addition of [32P]orthophosphate (100 μCi/ml) for an additional 90 min. Thereafter, the cells were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia in the presence or in the absence of 0.5% (v/v) butan-1-ol. Phospholipids were then extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (45Bligh E. Dyer W. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41844) Google Scholar) and separated on TLC plates developed with a solvent system consisting of ethyl acetate/isooctane/acetic acid (9:5:2 (v/v/v)) for the separation of [32P]PA and [32P]PBut or chloroform/pyridine/88% formic acid (60:30:7 (v/v/v)) for the detection of endogenous levels of [32P]PA in the absence of 1-butanol. The dried TLC plates were subjected to autoradiography, and the bands corresponding to radiolabeled PA and PBut were identified by comigration with authentic nonlabeled PA and PBut standards. Quantification of the band corresponding to [32P]PA was performed using the Bio-Rad Molecular Analyst Software. Total lipids were extracted from cells exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 6 h. The amount of DAG was determined by its conversion into [32P]PA byEscherichia coli DGK in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP as previously described (46Flores I. Martinez A.C. Hannun Y.A. Merida I. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3528-3533PubMed Google Scholar). DAG levels were corrected to the total phospholipid phosphate content. The method of Bartlett (47Bartlett G. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) was used for the assay of total phosphate. DGK activity was determined in cell lysates as previously described (39Flores I. Casaseca T. Martinez A.C. Kanoh H. Merida I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10334-10340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were incubated with 1,2-dioleoylglycerol in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Thereafter, the generation of [32P]PA by endogenous DGK was determined by its separation using TLC employing a solvent system consisting of chloroform/methanol/4 m ammonium hydroxide (9:7:2 (v/v/v)). The band corresponding to radiolabeled PA was quantified as above. To generate the p9HIF1-Luc reporter plasmid, we cloned nine copies in tandem of an oligonucleotide containing the HIF-1 binding sequence located between positions –985 and –951 of the 5′ human vascular endothelial growth factor gene promoter (6Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3135) Google Scholar, 48Liu Y. Cox S.R. Morita T. Kourembanas S. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar), upstream of a minimal promoter fused to the firefly luciferase cDNA. For the generation of p3EGR Luc, we cloned a single copy of the following nucleotide sequence (5′ to 3′) containing three binding sites for the transcription factor denominated early growth response factor 1 (EGR 1) (underlined): GCGCCCCCGCAAGCTTCGCCCCCGCAAAACGCCCCCGCA. To generate constructs encoding the GAL4 DNA binding domain (amino acids 1–147) (GAL4 DBD) in-frame with the amino acid sequences 530–582 or 775–826 of HIF-1α subunit, we amplified these regions using the polymerase chain reaction with primers containingBamHI overhangs and using as template the HIF-1α expression vector (kindly provided by Dr. E. Huang; Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The polymerase chain reactions were performed under the previously described conditions (18Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Leung S.W. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19253-19260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Thereafter, polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into the BamHI site of the pGAL4 DBD expression vector to generate the constructs designated pGAL4 DBD (530) HIF-1α and GAL4 DBD (775) HIF-1α. The pGAL4 DBD vector and the pGAL4 Luc reporter plasmid were kindly provided by Dr. J. M Redondo (Centro de Biologı́a Molecular, consejo superior de investigaciones cientificas, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain) Confluent cell cultures growing in 100 mm culture dishes were transfected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum with 20 μg of p9HIF-1 Luc or p3EGR Luc plasmids by using a standard calcium phosphate method (49Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.1989Google Scholar). For GAL4 experiments, 13 μg of the pGAL4 DBD or pGAL4 DBD (530) HIF-1α constructs were cotransfected with 7 μg of pGAL4 Luc or 7 μg of pGAL4 DBD (775) HIF-1α plasmid with 13 μg of pGAL4 Luc. After 10–16 h in the presence of DNA precipitates, cells were treated as indicated above prior to luciferase analysis. After cellular treatments, cell plates were rapidly placed on ice to avoid effects of reoxygenation prior to the preparation of nuclear extracts according to the procedure described elsewhere (50Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3902) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts containing 3–5 μg were incubated with 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), 100 ng of calf thymus DNA, and 2.5 μl of 5× DNA binding buffer (50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 130 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmZnCl2, 25 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmEDTA, 25% (v/v) glycerol) in a final volume of 11 μl for 10 min at room temperature. For the supershift assay, 1.5 μl of a polyclonal antibody raised against residues 1–13 of the human HIF-1α protein or the corresponding preimmune serum was added to the binding reaction and incubated for an additional 10 min. Thereafter, 0.5–1.5 ng (1.5 μl) of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (10–20 × 107 cpm/μg) was added. After 20 min of incubation at room temperature, 2 μl of Ficoll 400 20% (w/v) were added, and DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis. The complementary oligonucleotides annealed and used as probe in EMSA were (5′ to 3′) TCGACCACAGTGCATACGTGGGCTCCAACAGGTCCTCTTC and (5′ to 3′) TCGAGAAGAGGACCTGTTGGAGCCCACGTATGCACTGTGG (nucleotides spanning positions –985 to –951 of the human vascular endothelial growth factor 5′ gene promoter sequence are underlined). Whole cellular lysates from 2 × 105 cells were resolved after heating on an 8% polyacrylamide-SDS gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Thereafter, immunoblotting was performed as previously described (23Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S. Feliciano C.E. Wood T.M. Melendez J.A. Rodriguez A.M. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25130-25138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar) using the HIF-1α antibody (dilution 1:1000) (Transduction Laboratories, Becton Dickinson) or the Sp-1 antibody (dilution 1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Because DAG is a well recognized lipid second messenger, we decided to investigate whether the level of DAG was affected upon exposure of HeLa cells to hypoxia. As shown in Fig. 1, the exposure of HeLa cells to hypoxia induces a significant increase in the intracellular level of DAG. This result is in agreement with previous reports that have shown a sustained increase of DAG level in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, as well as in the Hep3B cell line in response to hypoxia (43Goldberg M. Zhang H.L. Steinberg S.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 44Yoshioka K. Clejan S. Fisher J.W. Life Sci. 1998; 63: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These data led us to propose that the accumulation of DAG could be a common mechanism that underlines the cellular response to hypoxia. Accumulation of DAG can lead to the activation of PLD through the induction of DAG-dependent PKC activity (51Wakelam M.J. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1998; 1436: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next analyzed whether hypoxia also resulted in the generation of PA through PLD. The reaction catalyzed by PLD generates PBut instead of PA when cells are incubated in the presence of the primary alcohol butan-1-ol (32Cross M.J. Roberts S. Ridley A.J. Hodgkin M.N. Stewart A. Claesson-Welsh L. Wakelam M.J.O. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 588-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore the measurement of PBut levels has been considered a marker of cellular PLD activity. Thus, the activation of PLD in 32P metabolically labeled HeLa cells treated with the phorbol ester PMA in the presence of butan-1-ol 0.5% (v/v) led to a marked increase of [32P]PBut level as previously described (Fig. 2) (52Edwards Y.S. Murray A.W. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In contrast, exposure of 32P-radiolabeled HeLa cells to hypoxia produced a strong increase of [32P]PA even in the presence of the same amount of butan-1-ol, whereas the basal [32P]PBut level was only moderately increased (Fig. 2). These data were confirmed with a parallel analysis of [32P]PA levels by high pressure liquid chromatography (data not shown). We conclude from these results that hypoxia induces a marked increase in cellular PA primarily through a PLD-independent mechanism. PA may also arise from conversion of DAG into PA by DGK (35Sakane F. Kanoh H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1139-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 36Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 37van Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because hypoxia accumulates DAG (Fig. 1), we thought that conversion of DAG into PA by DGK activity could account for the hypoxia-inducible PA generation in HeLa cells. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of the previously recognized DGK inhibitor R59949 (35Sakane F. Kanoh H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1139-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 39Flores I. Casaseca T. Martinez A.C. Kanoh H. Merida I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10334-10340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) on the hypoxia-induced PA accumulation. First, we tested whether the endogenous DGK activity of HeLa cells was sensitive to R59949. We found that treatment of HeLa cells with R59949 (10 μm) produced a significant inhibition (57%) of total endogenous HeLa DGK activity (Fig.3 A). Pretreatment of [32P]orthophosphate metabolically labeled HeLa cells with doses of R59949 ranging from 1 to 10 μmproduced a dose-dependent inhibition of hypoxia-induced [32P]PA accumulation (Fig. 3 B). The basal [32P]PA level in HeLa cells was also slightly inhibited in the presence of the same doses of the DGK inhibitor (Fig.3 B). Together, these data led us to propose that the conversion of hypoxia-dependent DAG accumulation into PA by a R59949-sensitive DGK isoform(s) is responsible for hypoxia-induced PA elevation in HeLa cells. As in the case of HeLa cells, we also found that hypoxia induced a marked PA accumulation in [32P]orthophosphate metabolically labeled Hep3B and 293-T cells that was inhibited by the DGK kinase inhibitor (Fig.4 A). Time course experiments in 293-T cells revealed a sustained hypoxia-induced PA accumulation that was detected as soon as after 3 h and remained elevated even after 15 h (Fig. 4 B). The delay of 3 h in the detection of PA accumulation was probably due to the fact that ∼2.5–3 h are required to reach fully established hypoxic conditions in the culture medium after initial influx of hypoxic atmosphere (data not shown). In this regard, a similar delay has been observed in other hypoxia-induced intracellular events, as in the case of activation of HIF-1 that is only completely induced after 2–4 h of hypoxia (53Wiesener M.S. Turley H. Allen W.E. Willam C. Eckardt K.U. Talks K.L. Wood S.M. Gatter K.C. Harris A.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Maxwell P.H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we performed experiments to answer the question whether the accumulation of PA was also detected with other cellular stresses or was it specific to hypoxia. We found that the exposure of HeLa cells to ultraviolet light C or heat shock during 15 min resulted in an induction of 1.2 ± 0.3-fold and 1.3 ± 0.4-fold (n = 4) in the level of PA, respectively, whereas an induction of 2–3-fold was observed after hypoxia exposure. Taken together, these data indicate that a sustained PA accumulation through a R59949-sensitive DGK mechanism is a general cellular response to low oxygen tension. Next we asked whether hypoxia-dependent PA accumulation was involved in the activation of HIF-1-dependent transcription. As a first approach, HeLa cells were transfected with the HIF-1-responsive reporter plasmid p9HIF-1 Luc. Pretreatment of transfected HeLa cells with R59949, at doses identical to those that impaired hypoxia-inducible PA accumulation (1–10 μm), gradually inhibited the hypoxia-inducible transcription promoted by p9HIF-1 Luc (Fig. 5, top panel). Similar results were obtained with R59022 (10 μm), a different specific DGK activity inhibitor (Fig. 5, top panel). As a control of specificity, we analyzed in parallel the previously described PMA-dependent transcription driven by the EGR 1 (54Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol Biol. 1995; 50: 191-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The response to PMA driven by the EGR-responsive reporter plasmid, p3EGR Luc, was not markedly affected by pretreatment with the same doses of R59949 or R59022 (Fig. 5, bottom panel). The binding of HIF-1 to DNA specific sequences is required to promote HIF-1-driven transcription. Therefore, we analyzed by EMSA whetherR59949 pretreatment interfered with the formation of HIF-1-DNA complex. The DNA probe used in this EMSA was the HIF-1 binding sequence multimerized in the p9HIF-1 Luc. Exposure of HeLa cells to hypoxia induced the appearance of two major hypoxia-inducible DNA-protein complexes indicated as H1 and H2 (Fig.6 A). A specific polyclonal antibody against the α subunit of HIF-1, but not the corresponding preimmune serum, was able to supershift both hypoxia-inducible complexes without affecting constitutive DNA-protein complexes, evidencing the presence of HIF-1 specifically in H1 and H2 complexes (Fig. 6 A). The hypoxia-dependent formation of H1 and H2 complexes was markedly reduced in HeLa cells pretreated withR59949 (10 μm), whereas we did not observe any significant effect of the DGK inhibitor on the constitutive DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 6 A). Furthermore, the addition of R59949 (10 μm) to the in vitro binding reaction did not affect the formation of both HIF-1-DNA complexes (data not shown), indicating that R59949 affected the cellular mechanisms that lead to the appearance of HIF-1-DNA complexes upon hypoxic stimulation. The binding of HIF-1 heterodimer to DNA requires a previous hypoxia-induced stabilization and subsequent accumulation of the HIF-1α subunit (17Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed whether th"

These are assembled into a number of distinct receptors, but the regulation of their relative proportions is yet unknown. Here, we studied the composition of cerebellar GABAA receptors after targeted disruption of the δ subunit gene. In membranes and extracts of δ−/− cerebellum, [3H]muscimol binding was not significantly changed, whereas [3H]Ro15-4513 binding was increased by 52% due to an increase in diazepam-insensitive binding. Immunocytochemical and Western blot analysis revealed no change in α6 subunits but an increased expression of γ2 subunits in δ−/− cerebellum. Immunoaffinity chromatography of cerebellar extracts indicated there was an increased coassembly of α6 and γ2 subunits and that 24% of all receptors in δ−/− cerebellum did not contain a γ subunit. Because 97% of δ subunits are coassembled with α6 subunits in the cerebellum of wild-type mice, these results indicated that, in δ−/− mice, α6βγ2 and αβ receptors replaced δ subunit-containing receptors. The availability of the δ subunit, thus, influences the level of expression or the extent of assembly of the γ2 subunit, although these two subunits do not occur in the same receptor.

Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). A variety of drugs, such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, steroids, anesthetics, and convulsants exert their pharmacologically and clinically important actions by modulating the function of these receptors (2Sieghart W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 181-234PubMed Google Scholar). GABAA receptors are composed of five subunits derived from different subunit classes. So far, six α, four β, three γ, one δ, one ε, one π, one θ, and three ρ subunits have been cloned from mammalian brain (3Barnard E.A. Skolnick P. Olsen R.W. Möhler H. Sieghart W. Biggio G.

From possible permutations of these subunits, theoretically, an extremely large number of receptors with distinct subunit composition can be formed. Due to restrictions in the cellular expression of individual subunits and to mechanisms governing the assembly of receptors, however, only a limited number of receptor subtypes actually are present in the brain (5Stephenson F.A.

The regulation of the expression of the different receptors relative to each other is unknown. Targeted disruption of genes by homologous recombination is widely used to study the functional role of the respective gene product in the organism. In receptors composed of multiple subunits, the deletion of one subunit might also reduce the abundance of its subunit partners present in the same receptors. Indeed, after the disruption of the GABAA receptor α6 subunit gene, not only were the α6 subunits completely eliminated from cerebellar granule cells but also the δ subunits were dramatically reduced (16Jones A. Korpi E.R. McKernan R.M. Pelz R. Nusser Z. Mäkelä R. Mellor J.R. Pollard S. Bahn S. Stephenson F.A. Randall A.D. Sieghart W. Somogyi P. Smith A.J.H. Wisden W. J.

Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1685-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the α6 subunit is necessary for the oligomerization and surface expression of the δ subunit. The recent generation of δ−/− mice (18Mihalek R.M. Banerjee P.K. Korpi E. Quinlan J.J. Firestone L.L. Mi Z.-P. Lagenaur C. Tretter V. Sieghart W. Anagnostaras S. Sage J.R. Fanselow M. Guidotti A.

A. 1999; 96: 12905-12910Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) allowed to investigate whether the δ subunit is also essential for the surface expression of the α6 subunit. Therefore, in the present study, the abundance and subunit composition of GABAA receptors was compared in the cerebellum of δ+/+ and δ−/− mice. In contrast to α6−/− mice (17Nusser Z. Ahmad Z. Tretter V. Fuchs K. Wisden W. Sieghart W. Somogyi P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1685-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the total number of GABAAreceptors was not reduced in the cerebellum of δ−/− mice, despite the complete loss of δ subunits. Instead, an up-regulation of the γ2 subunit-containing receptors was observed. Furthermore, the composition of GABAA receptors in the cerebellum of δ−/− mice differed significantly from that of δ+/+ mice. Targeted disruption of the δ subunit of the GABAA receptor in mouse embryonic stem cells and production of wild-type (δ+/+), and homozygous δ−/− mice is described in detail in a previous study (18Mihalek R.M. Banerjee P.K. Korpi E. Quinlan J.J. Firestone L.L. Mi Z.-P. Lagenaur C. Tretter V. Sieghart W. Anagnostaras S. Sage J.R. Fanselow M. Guidotti A. DeLorey T.M. Olsen R.W. Homanics G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12905-12910Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The replacement-type DNA targeting construct placed a selectable marker gene in exon 4, upstream of the exons required for the putative transmembrane regions of this receptor subunit. This targeting event prevented the production of δ protein, i.e. produced a true null allele. The mice used for the present studies were the F2–F5 generation on a mixed C57BL/6J × strain 129Sv/SvJ genetic background. These mice were normal in their gross behavior. δ+/+ mice were the F3 generation on a mixed C57BL/6J × strain 129Sv/SvJ genetic background. The generation of anti-peptide α1-(1–9) (19Zezula J.

Honer M. Michel C. Möhler H. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 1413-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) has been described earlier. The antibodies were shown to precipitate recombinant GABAA receptors containing the respective subunit only and did not exhibit cross-reactivity with other GABAA receptors (13Jechlinger M. Pelz R. Tretter V. Klausberger T. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2449-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nusser Z. Ahmad Z. Tretter V. Fuchs K. Wisden W. Sieghart W. Somogyi P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1685-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Membranes from a total of 12 δ+/+ and 12 δ−/− cerebella were isolated individually, and equal amounts (15 μg) of protein per slot were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the same 10% polyacrylamide gel (13Jechlinger M. Pelz R. Tretter V. Klausberger T. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2449-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and detected by subunit specific antibodies. Secondary antibodies (Fab′2 fragments of goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to alkaline phosphatase, Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs Inc.) were visualized by the reaction of alkaline phosphatase with CSPD (Tropix, Bedford, MA) and the chemiluminescence signal was quantified by densitometry of Kodak X-Omat S films with the Docu Gel 2000i gel documentation system using RFLP scan software (MWG biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). The linear range of the detection system was established by determining the antibody response to a range of antigen concentrations following immunoblotting. The experimental conditions were designed such that immunoreactivities obtained in the assay were within this linear range, thus permitting a direct comparison of the amount of antigen applied per gel lane between samples. Different exposures of the same membrane were used to ensure that the measured signal was in the linear range of the x-ray film. To test for equal protein loading, in some experiments a monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody, was included in the antibody solution, and the amounts of endogenous β-actin were quantitatively determined in a way analogous to GABAA receptor subunits. Protein loading was comparable in different slots and referring the data to the amounts of endogenous β-actin neither changed the results nor reduced variability. GABAA receptors were solubilized from cerebellar membranes of δ+/+ and δ−/− mice using a deoxycholate buffer (0.5% deoxycholate, 0.05% phosphatidylcholine, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm benzamidine, 200 μg/ml bacitracin, and 300 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and immunoaffinity chromatography was performed as described (13Jechlinger M. Pelz R. Tretter V. Klausberger T. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2449-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, deoxycholate extracts were cycled three times through the affinity column (synthesized as described in Ref. 21Mossier B. Tögel M. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25777-25782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at a rate of 2 ml/h. To determine the percentage of receptors retained by the column, immunoprecipitations with subunit-specific antibodies and [3H]muscimol binding assays were performed with the original extract and the column efflux in parallel. For immunoprecipitation, 200 μl of the clear deoxycholate membrane extract was mixed with 30 μl of antibody solution (20–45 μg of antibody), and the mixture was incubated under gentle shaking at 4 °C overnight. Then 50 μl of pansorbin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) plus 100 μl of a low salt buffer for immunoprecipitation (50 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, pH 8.0, 1 mm benzamidine, 200 μg/ml bacitracin, and 300 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 5% dry milk powder were added, and incubation was continued for 2 h at 4 °C. The precipitate was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g, and the pellet was washed twice with 500 μl of high salt buffer for immunoprecipitation (50 mm Tris/HCl, 600 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 8.3, 1 mm benzamidine, 200 μg/ml bacitracin, and 300 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and once with 500 μl of low salt buffer for immunoprecipitation. For determination of the total amount of receptors present in the extract, solubilized receptors were precipitated by a mixture containing 10 μg of β1-(350–404), 18 μg of β2-(351–405), and 15 μg of β3-(345–408) antibody per 200 μl of extract. This antibody mixture was used, because all functional GABAA receptors are supposed to contain at least one of these three β subunits. Precipitation with polyethylene glycol could not be used for the determination of total [3H]muscimol binding due to the rapid dissociation of [3H]muscimol from its binding site. The high viscosity of the polyethylene glycol solution causes relatively long filtration and washing times and, thus, significant losses of previously bound [3H]muscimol. The amounts of β1-(350–404), β2-(351–405), and β3-(345–408) antibodies used were sufficient to maximally precipitate GABAAreceptors containing the respective β subunits from brain extracts. The total number of [3H]muscimol binding sites measured in receptors precipitated by this antibody mixture was higher than that precipitated by polyethylene glycol, whereas the total number of [3H]Ro15-4513 binding sites measured was identical whether receptors were precipitated by the antibody mixture or polyethylene glycol (13Jechlinger M. Pelz R. Tretter V. Klausberger T. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2449-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nusser Z. Ahmad Z. Tretter V. Fuchs K. Wisden W. Sieghart W. Somogyi P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1685-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cerebellar membranes were homogenized and washed three times with 50 mm Tris/citrate, pH 7.1. Extracted receptors were immunoprecipitated, and the precipitate was suspended in 1 ml of a solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-citrate buffer, pH 7.1. A total of 1 ml of a solution containing 100 μg of membrane protein or the resuspended immunoprecipitate was incubated with 2–50 nmof [3H]Ro15-4513 (21.7 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the absence or presence of 100 μm diazepam or 100 μm Ro15-1788, or with 2–50 nm[3H]muscimol (20 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the absence or presence of 1 mm GABA, for 90 min at 4 °C. Then the suspensions were filtered through Whatman GF/B filters, and the filters were washed and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. Two series of animals were processed. In the first series, five adult δ+/+ and five adult δ−/− mice were anesthetized with Sagatal (pentobarbitone sodium, 220 mg/kg intraperitoneal) and perfused through the heart first with 0.9% saline, then with a fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.05% glutaraldehyde, and 0.2% picric acid in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4; PB) for 7–15 min. After perfusion the brains were removed, and blocks from the vermis of the cerebellum were cut out and washed in PB before sectioning with a Vibratome. Normal goat serum (NGS, 20%) was used in 50 mm Tris-HCl containing 0.9% NaCl (pH 7.4, TBS) as the blocking solution for 1 h, before the sections were incubated in the primary antibody solution (in TBS containing 1% NGS and 0.05% Triton X-100) overnight. Primary antibodies were used at the following final protein concentrations (in μg/ml): α1 = 0.9–1.3 (P16); α6 = 0.5–0.6 (P24); β2 = 0.9 (β2-(351–405)R23); β3 = 1.7–2.0 (β3-(345–408)R1); γ2 = 1.0 (γ2-(1–29), 22); and δ = 1.1 (δ-(1–44)R5). After washing, the sections were incubated in either biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG or biotinylated goat anti-guinea pig IgG (diluted 1:50 in TBS containing 1% NGS, Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK) for 2 h. The sections were then incubated in avidin biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (diluted 1:100 in TBS) for 1.5 h before the peroxidase enzyme reaction was visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as chromogen and H2O2 as oxidant. Sections were then routinely processed for light microscopic examination. In the second series, three adult δ+/+ and three δ−/− mice were anesthetized and perfused with the same fixative as above for 10 min. After perfusion, 50-μm-thick sections were cut from the cerebellum on a Vibratome. All solutions contained 0.1% Triton X-100. Normal goat serum (NGS, 20%) in TBS was used as blocking solution, before the sections were incubated in the primary antibody solution in TBS containing 1% NGS overnight. Primary antibodies were used at the following final protein concentrations: α1(P16), 0.6 μg/ml; γ2-(319–366, T12/20/B9), 0.9 μg/ml. After washing, the sections were incubated for 5 h in goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to Alexa488, diluted 1:1000 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at room temperature. Sections were washed and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). The animals were coded and measurements were carried out according to a double-blind protocol. Neither the person taking the images nor the person making the subsequent measurements knew the identity of the animals. The code was opened only after completing the measurements. One digital image (cooled charge-coupled device camera, Xilix Microimager, OpenLab version 2.2.1, Improvision, Coventry, UK) was captured from each of three sections per animal using a 20× objective, 100-watt mercury lamp, and an L5 filter block (excitation filter, BP 480/40 nm; RKP 565 nm; suppression filter BP 610/75) of a Leitz DMRB fluorescence microscope. The same exposure time was used for images from all animals for a given antibody, and the images were treated in an identical way. The images were transferred to Adobe Photoshop (version 5.5) and the mean gray scale pixel value (12-bit) was determined separately for the molecular and granule cell layers for each section using the Histogram command. Each animal was characterized by the mean average gray scale pixel value obtained from the three sections. The values of control and δ−/− animals were compared with the unpaired t test. In cerebellum, immunoreactivity for the δ subunit is restricted to the granule cell layer (15Nusser Z. Sieghart W. Somogyi P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Jones A. Korpi E.R. McKernan R.M. Pelz R. Nusser Z. Mäkelä R. Mellor J.R. Pollard S. Bahn S. Stephenson F.A. Randall A.D. Sieghart W.

Korpi E.R. McKernan R.M. Pelz R. Nusser Z. Mäkelä R. Mellor J.R. Pollard S. Bahn S. Stephenson F.A. Randall A.D. Sieghart W. Somogyi P. Smith A.J.H. Wisden W. J.

In agreement with these immunocytochemical results, neither the complete δ subunit (54-kDa protein band) nor a truncated δ subunit protein were detectable in cerebellar membranes of δ−/− mice by Western blot analysis (18Mihalek R.M. Banerjee P.K. Korpi E. Quinlan J.J. Firestone L.L. Mi Z.-P. Lagenaur C. Tretter V. Sieghart W. Anagnostaras S. Sage J.R. Fanselow M. Guidotti A. DeLorey T.M. Olsen R.W. Homanics G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12905-12910Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Finally, in contrast to δ+/+ mice, where an immunoaffinity column containing the δ-(1–44) antibody was able to remove 28.8 ± 4.2% (n = 3, mean ± S.E.) of all [3H]muscimol binding sites from cerebellar extracts, no [3H]muscimol binding sites could be removed by this column from cerebellar extracts of δ−/− mice, confirming the absence of δ subunit-containing receptors in mice with a targeted disruption of the δ subunit. In addition to the δ subunit, five other major subunits can be detected in cerebellar granule cells: α1, α6, β2, β3, and γ2 (15Nusser Z. Sieghart W. Somogyi P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nusser Z. Ahmad Z. Tretter V. Fuchs K. Wisden W. Sieghart W. Somogyi P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1685-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We applied light microscopic immunolabeling to assess possible alterations in the expression of these subunits and to determine the cellular distribution of any change. Immunoperoxidase reactions indicated no change in immunoreactivity for the α1, α6, β2, and β3 subunits, but showed an up-regulation of immunoreactivity for the γ2 subunit in the cerebellar granule cell layer of δ−/− animals (Fig. 1). To quantify the change, light microscopic immunofluorescence labeling for the γ2 and α1 subunits was carried out and measured. For the γ2 subunit, the mean gray scale pixel value increased by 82% (53.5 ± 7.9, mean ± S.D.,n = 3, control; 97.2 ± 5.9, n = 3, δ−/−, p < 0.01, unpaired t test) in the granule cell layer of δ−/− mice. In addition, there was also a small (18%) but significant (p < 0.01, unpairedt test) increase in γ2 subunit labeling in the molecular layer of the δ−/− mice (49.1 ± 1.8,n = 3, control; 58.2 ± 2.4, n = 3, δ−/−). In agreement with the results of the peroxidase reactions, no significant change (p > 0.05, unpairedt test) was detected in immunoreactivity for the α1 subunit in either the granule cell (81.0 ± 6.7,n = 3, control; 91.5 ± 4.7, n = 3, δ−/−) or the molecular layers (75.2 ± 6.0,n = 3, control; 84.3 ± 13.0, n = 3, δ−/−). Membranes from the cerebellum of δ+/+ or δ−/− mice were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantitative Western blot analysis, using subunit-specific antibodies directed against α1, α6, β2, β3, γ2, and δ subunits (13Jechlinger M. Pelz R. Tretter V. Klausberger T. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2449-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nusser Z. Ahmad Z. Tretter V. Fuchs K. Wisden W. Sieghart W. Somogyi P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1685-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the expression of α1 subunits was increased by 25% in the cerebellum of δ−/− mice, whereas the levels of α6 or β2 subunits were not significantly different from those found in δ+/+ mice. The expression of β3 subunits was increased by 23% and that of γ2 subunits was increased by 45% (Fig. 2). To investigate whether the additional γ2 subunits expressed in δ−/− cerebellum were part of functional receptors, [3H]Ro15-4513 binding studies were performed in membranes from δ+/+ and δ−/− cerebellum. [3H]Ro15-4513 is a ligand for the benzodiazepine binding site of GABAA receptors, which are only formed by receptors containing a γ subunit (2Sieghart W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 181-234PubMed Google Scholar). Scatchard analysis of specific [3H]Ro15-4513 binding indicated that the total number (Bmax) of sites was increased by 52% in δ−/− mice, whereas the binding affinity was not significantly different (Table I). In agreement with previous reports (24Korpi E.R. Uusi-Oukari M. Kaivola J. Neuroscience. 1993; 53: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 25Sieghart W. Eichinger A. Richards J.G.

Ther. 1991; 257: 1236-1242PubMed Google Scholar), 31% of total binding in the cerebellum of δ+/+ mice was not displaced by 100 μm diazepam, but could be displaced by 100 μm Ro15-1788, a benzodiazepine site antagonist. This diazepam-insensitive (DIS) binding, which is attributed to receptors containing α6 subunits (27Lüddens H. Pritchett D.B. Köhler M. Killisch I. Keinänen K. Monyer H. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 1990; 346: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) was increased by 180% in δ−/− mice. The diazepam-sensitive (DS) [3H]Ro15-4513 binding, however, was comparable in δ−/− and δ+/+ mice (Table I).Table IComparison of benzodiazepine binding sites by Scatchard analysis of [3H]Ro15–4513 bindingParameterδ+/+δ−/−pA.

Membranes or precipitated receptors were then filtered through Whatman GF/B filters and washed as described. Scatchard analysis was performed from [3H]Ro15–4513 binding data that could be displaced by 100 μm Ro15–1788 (total specific binding) or by 100 μm diazepam (diazepam sensitive = DS binding).

These data were confirmed by binding studies using [3H]flunitrazepam as a ligand. In contrast to [3H]Ro15-4513, [3H]flunitrazepam exclusively binds to DS sites (25Sieghart W. Eichinger A. Richards J.G. Möhler H. J. Neurochem. 1987; 48: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Scatchard analyses from two separate experiments indicated that Bmax values observed in membranes from δ+/+ cerebella (2072 and 1640 fmol/mg of protein) were comparable to those observed in δ−/− cerebella (2103 and 2126 fmol/mg of protein) and were also comparable to theBmax values of the DS [3H]Ro15-4513 binding sites in these tissues (TableI). In other experiments, GABAA receptors were extracted from cerebellar membranes by a deoxycholate buffer and then immunoprecipitated with a combination of antibodies directed against the β1, β2, and β3 subunits of GABAA receptors (13Jechlinger M.

https://openalex.org/W2038611992,"Amino acid transport in mouse peritoneal macrophages is mediated by several membrane carriers with different substrate specificity and sensitivity to environmental stimuli. We reported previously that transport activities of cystine and arginine in the macrophages were induced markedly by low concentrations of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). It is known that a variety of macrophage functions are affected by ambient oxygen tension. In this study, we have investigated the effects of oxygen on the induction of amino acid transport activity by LPS and found that the induction of cystine, but not arginine, transport activity was dependent on the ambient oxygen tension. When the macrophages were cultured with 2% O2 in the presence of 1 ng/ml LPS, induction of cystine transport activity was reduced by ∼70% compared with cells cultured under normoxic conditions. In macrophages, transport of cystine is mediated by a Na+-independent anionic amino acid transporter named system xc−. System xc− is composed of two protein components, xCT and 4F2hc , and the expression of xCT was closely correlated with system xc−activity. A putative NF-κB binding site was found in the 5′-flanking region of the xCT gene, but the enhanced expression of xCT by LPS and oxygen was not mediated by NF-κB binding. An increase in intracellular GSH in macrophages paralleled induction of xCT, but not γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase. These results suggest the importance of system xc− in antioxidant defense in macrophages exposed to LPS and oxidative stress.AB037650AB037661 Amino acid transport in mouse peritoneal macrophages is mediated by several membrane carriers with different substrate specificity and sensitivity to environmental stimuli. We reported previously that transport activities of cystine and arginine in the macrophages were induced markedly by low concentrations of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). It is known that a variety of macrophage functions are affected by ambient oxygen tension. In this study, we have investigated the effects of oxygen on the induction of amino acid transport activity by LPS and found that the induction of cystine, but not arginine, transport activity was dependent on the ambient oxygen tension. When the macrophages were cultured with 2% O2 in the presence of 1 ng/ml LPS, induction of cystine transport activity was reduced by ∼70% compared with cells cultured under normoxic conditions. In macrophages, transport of cystine is mediated by a Na+-independent anionic amino acid transporter named system xc−. System xc− is composed of two protein components, xCT and 4F2hc , and the expression of xCT was closely correlated with system xc−activity.

Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). We have previously characterized anionic, neutral, and cationic amino acid transport systems in mouse peritoneal macrophages, which are known to be activated by a variety of factors such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)1 and cytokines (2Watanabe H. Bannai S. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 628-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 3Sato H. Watanabe H. Ishii T. Bannai S. J. Biol.

Macrophages exhibit cytoprotective functions including antigen presentation and microbicidal or tumoricidal activity. The major anionic amino acid transport system in macrophages is system xc−, which mediates the exchange of an anionic form of cystine and glutamate across the plasma membrane (2Watanabe H. Bannai S. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 628-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The transport system for neutral amino acids in macrophages seems to be unique, transporting most neutral substrates such as serine, alanine, and leucine via a Na+-independent mechanism (3Sato H. Watanabe H. Ishii T. Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13015-13019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For cationic amino acids, a system y+-like cationic amino acid transport system mediates the uptake of arginine, lysine, and ornithine, although the system in macrophages has slightly different characteristics from those of the typical system y+(4Sato H. Ishii T. Sugita Y. Bannai S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1069: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have found that a very low concentration of LPS markedly enhances the activities of cystine and arginine transport in mouse peritoneal macrophages (5Sato H. Fujiwara K. Sagara J. Bannai S. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 6Sato H. Fujiwara M. Bannai S. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1992; 52: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The enhanced uptake of cystine results from the induction of system xc− activity and increased influx of arginine is because of the induction of the typical system y+ activity. The induction of cystine transport may contribute to the maintenance of intracellular GSH levels because cystine taken up by the cells is reduced to cysteine, a rate-limiting precursor for GSH synthesis (7Bannai S. Tateishi N. J. Membrane Biol. 1986; 89: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In contrast, the induction of the arginine transport activity is a key event for production of nitric oxide involved in microbicidal and tumoricidal processes in activated macrophages (8Bogle R.G. Baydoun A.R. Pearson J.D. Mann G.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 9Shibazaki T. Fujiwara M. Sato H. Fujiwara K. Abe K. Bannai S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1311: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding a protein with properties consistent with system y+ in LPS-activated mouse macrophages has been identified and named mCAT-2B (10Closs E.I. Lyons C.R. Kelly C. Cunningham J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20796-20800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that system xc− is composed of two proteins and have cloned cDNAs for these proteins, namely 4F2hc (heavy chain of the surface antigen 4F2, also named CD98) and xCT (11Sato H. Tamba M. Ishii T. Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11455-11458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Coexpression of the ubiquitous transmembrane protein 4F2hc with xCT (and cDNAs of some other amino acid transporters) has been shown to induce amino acid transport activity in Xenopus oocytes (12Mastroberardine L.

Recent studies have shown that in macrophages, ambient oxygen tension alters the morphology, expression of cell surface markers, viability, phagocytosis, metabolic activity, and release of cytokines (16Lewis J.S. Lee J.A. Underwood J.C.E. Harris A.L. Lewis C.E. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 66: 889-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). It is likely that antioxidant systems such as intracellular GSH are affected by ambient oxygen tension and/or oxidative stress in these cells activated by LPS. In the present study, we have investigated the effects of oxygen on the induction of cystine and arginine transport activity in the macrophages caused by treatment with LPS. We have established that induction of cystine transport by LPS is dependent on ambient oxygen levels, whereas LPS-induced activation of arginine transport via system y+ was unaffected. l-[14C]Cystine,l-[14C]arginine, andl-[14C]serine were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Thioglycolate broth (Brewer's formula) and Bacto LPS (Salmonella typhosa 0901) were from Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI. Fetal bovine serum was obtained from BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD, and the lot which contains less than 0.3 ng/ml endotoxin was used. Monobromobimane was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc., OR. Macrophages were collected by peritoneal lavage from female C57BL/6 mice weighing 20–25 g who had previously received 4 days prior an intraperitoneal injection of 2 ml of 4% thioglycolate broth. The lavage medium was RPMI 1640 containing 10 units/ml heparin. The cells were washed twice with RPMI 1640 and plated at 1 × 106 cells/35-mm diameter culture dish containing RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air, and after 1 h the medium was replaced to remove nonadherent cells. For hypoxic conditions, cells were cultured in a gas-tight chamber flushed with 95% N2 and 5% CO2, and the required concentrations of O2were measured using an oxygen meter. Amino acid uptake was measured using techniques described previously (17Bannai S. Kitamura E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2372-2376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were rinsed three times in warmed PBSG (10 mm phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl), pH 7.4, containing 0.01% CaCl2, 0.01% MgCl2·6H2O, and 0.1% glucose) and then incubated in 0.5 ml of the warmed uptake medium at 37 °C for specified time periods. The uptake medium was PBSG with a labeled amino acid (0.1 μCi/0.5 ml). Uptake was terminated by rapidly rinsing the culture dishes three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and radioactivity associated with cell extracts was determined as described previously (17Bannai S. Kitamura E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2372-2376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid uptake was determined under conditions approaching initial rates of uptake, i.e. measuring uptakes for cystine, serine, and arginine at 120, 30, and 15 s, respectively. For each of the amino acids, uptake increased linearly during the specified incubation interval. Intracellular GSH was extracted with 5% trichloroacetic acid and then treated with ether to remove the acid. The GSH content in the aqueous layer was measured using an enzymatic method described previously, which is based on the catalytic action of GSH in the reduction of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) by the GSH reductase system (18Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5488) Google Scholar). The GSH extracted from the cells was mostly reduced GSH, and the content of the oxidized form, GSSG, was negligible throughout the experiments in this study. The efflux of GSH was measured as follows. The cells were rinsed three times with PBSG and incubated with 0.5 ml of PBSG at 37 °C for 1 h. Then GSH in the PBSG was quantified by the method described above. The cysteine content in the cells was determined by the method of Cotgreave and Moldéus (19Cotgreave I.A. Moldéus P. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1986; 13: 231-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) with a slight modification (20Sagara J. Miura K. Bannai S. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The cells were rinsed three times with PBSG and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 10 min with 100 μl of 8 mmmonobromobimane in 50 mm N-ethylmorpholine, pH 8 and 100 μl of 50 mm phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.01% CaCl2, 0.01% MgCl2·6H2O, and 0.1% glucose. Then 10 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid was added. The protein precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min and aliquots were analyzed for cysteine-bimane adduct by HPLC. The HPLC separation was achieved on a steel column (4.6 × 100 mm) packed with 3-μm octadodecylsilica reversed-phase material. The fluorescence at 480 nm was monitored with excitation at 394 nm. The elution was performed with 9% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.25% (v/v) acetic acid, pH 3.7 for 8 min, and then with 75% (v/v) acetonitrile in water for 5 min. The flow rate was 1 ml/min throughout the process. The mouse cDNAs for xCT, 4F2hc, γ-GCS, and β-actin were used as probes. The probes were labeled using [α-32P]dCTP and RediprimeTM II random prime labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Ten μg of total RNA was electrophoresed, transferred, and hybridized as described previously (11Sato H. Tamba M. Ishii T. Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11455-11458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Mouse genomic library (Stratagene) was screened using mouse xCT cDNA as a probe. The positive plaques were isolated, and one of the clones that contained exon 1 and the 5′-flanking region of the gene was subcloned into pBluescript. The transcription initiation site was determined using a 5′-RACE system for rapid amplification of cDNA ends, version 2.0 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and Primer Extension System (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocols. The nuclear extracts were prepared by a modified procedure based on the method of Monick et al. (21Monick M.M. Carter A.B. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18075-18080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (5 × 106) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and collected by centrifugation. The cell pellets were resuspended in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mmKCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA) and incubated for 15 min on ice. The cells were vortexed for 30 s after addition of Nonidet P-40 (0.6%), then centrifuged, and the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of extraction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 300 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol). After a 20-min incubation on ice, followed by a 5-min centrifugation, nuclear proteins were recovered from the supernatant. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously using a32P-radiolabeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the consensus NF-κB DNA-binding site (22Kaul N. Choi J. Forman H.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The DNA probes (20,000 cpm) were incubated with 3 μg of nuclear protein under the binding conditions (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 5% glycerol) in a final volume of 20 μl. The reactions were carried out at 4 °C for 15 min and products were electrophoresed on native 6% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were analyzed by autoradiography. The activity of cystine transport was measured in mouse peritoneal macrophages cultured under various oxygen tensions in the absence or presence of LPS (Fig. 1). Cystine transport activity was induced by LPS in an oxygen tension-dependent manner. However, hyperoxia (50% O2) significantly reduced the activity of cystine transport. To establish whether other amino acid transporters responded in a similar manner, we investigated the effect of oxygen tension on arginine and serine transport activity (Fig.2). Although arginine transport was induced markedly by the low concentrations of LPS, as reported previously (6Sato H. Fujiwara M. Bannai S. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1992; 52: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the induction of transport was unaffected by hypoxia. Neither LPS nor oxygen tension had any effect on the activity of serine transport.Figure 2Effects of oxygen on the uptake of arginine (A) and serine (B) by macrophages incubated with LPS. Macrophages were incubated under hypoxia (2% O2) for 1 h, and the medium was replaced by fresh medium with (filled bars) or without (open bars) 1 ng/ml LPS. The cells were further incubated under hypoxia (2% O2) or normoxia (20% O2) for 11 h, and the rates of uptake of 0.05 mm l-[14C]arginine andl-[14C]serine were measured.

(n = 4–6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The dose-dependent expression of xCT and 4F2hc mRNAs by LPS was investigated in macrophages cultured under 20% O2(normoxia) and 2% O2 (hypoxia). As shown in Fig.3 A, under normoxia, expression of xCT was not detected in the cells in the absence of LPS, but three xCT transcripts (∼12, 3.5, and 2.5 kilobases) from cells treated with 1 ng/ml LPS were observed. These multiple bands may represent alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation sites, or a combination of both (11Sato H. Tamba M. Ishii T. Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11455-11458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The expression of these transcripts was significantly decreased in cells treated with 1000 ng/ml LPS. These results are consistent with the previous report that the induction of the activity of system xc− is maximal in macrophages treated with 1 ng/ml (5Sato H. Fujiwara K. Sagara J. Bannai S. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The expression of xCT in cells treated with 1 ng/ml LPS under hypoxia was lower than that in the cells treated with the same amount of LPS under normoxia. The expression of xCT mRNA in the cells treated with 1000 ng/ml under hypoxia was hardly detected. Fig. 3 B shows the time-dependent expression of xCT and 4F2hc mRNAs in cells cultured with 1 ng/ml LPS under hypoxia and normoxia. The expression of xCT mRNA was not detected in the freshly isolated macrophages, but expression increased gradually, reaching maximal levels after 8–12 h of culture under normoxia. Expression of xCT mRNA in cells cultured under hypoxia was increased over a similar time course, although expression was significantly lower than that in cells cultured under normoxia. The expression of 4F2hc also increased during culture with LPS, but changes in oxygen tension had negligible effects on expression. These results suggest that the decreased activity of cystine transport in the cells cultured with LPS under hypoxia is caused in part by the transcriptional regulation of xCT mRNA expression. We have isolated the xCT gene from the mouse genome library and analyzed the sequence of 5′-flanking region. As shown in Fig.4, there are several putative AP-1 binding sites and a putative NF-κB binding site. We have investigated the effects of oxygen on the binding activity of NF-κB by LPS. The binding activity of NF-κB remained relatively low in the macrophages treated with 1 ng/ml LPS, and a significant increase was observed when the cells were treated with 1000 ng/ml LPS (Fig.5). Oxygen did not affect the NF-κB binding activity. The pattern of the NF-κB binding was inconsistent with those of xCT mRNA, suggesting that the induction of xCT mRNA by LPS and oxygen is not mediated by NF-κB.Figure 5Activation of NF-κB in macrophages cultured with LPS under hypoxia and normoxia.Macrophages were incubated under hypoxia (2% O2) for 1 h, and the medium was replaced by fresh medium containing 0, 1, or 1000 ng/ml LPS. The cells were further incubated for 1 h under hypoxia or normoxia (20% O2), and the nuclear extracts were prepared. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously demonstrated that intracellular GSH levels are significantly increased in the macrophages cultured with LPS (5Sato H. Fujiwara K. Sagara J. Bannai S. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It is known that γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in de novo GSH synthesis. We have investigated the effect of LPS and oxygen on the expression of γ-GCS in these cells. Fig. 6 shows the expression of mRNAs for γ-GCS and xCT in the cells cultured with diethyl maleate or LPS under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Diethyl maleate is an electrophilic agent, which reacts with GSH enzymatically or nonenzymatically. The expression of γ-GCS mRNA was induced markedly by diethyl maleate, but unaffected by LPS. As shown in Fig.7, the intracellular GSH level in LPS-challenged cells cultured under hypoxia for 12 h was significantly lower than the level in cells cultured under normoxia. These results are consistent with the results that the cystine transport activity in the cells treated with LPS is decreased under hypoxia (Fig. 1). In comparison with GSH levels in cells treated without LPS under normoxia, the GSH level was 1.8-fold higher in cells treated with LPS. By contrast, the GSH level in cells cultured under normoxia for 12 h with diethyl maleate, which induces both mRNAs for system xc− and γ-GCS (Fig. 6), were increased 2.4-fold.Figure 7Intracellular GSH levels in macrophages incubated with diethyl maleate and LPS under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. Macrophages were incubated under hypoxia (2% O2) for 1 h, and the intracellular GSH level was measured. For other cells, the medium was replaced by fresh medium (Cont) containing 100 μm diethyl maleate (DEM), or 1 ng/ml LPS (LPS). The cells were further incubated under hypoxia (2% O2, open bars) or normoxia (20% O2, hatched bars) for 3 and 11 h, and intracellular GSH levels were measured. Each point represents the mean ± S.D. (n = 4–6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is of importance to determine whether the intracellular cysteine, which is a rate-limiting substrate for GSH synthesis, increases in response to induction of cystine transport activity. We investigated the intracellular cysteine levels in the cells cultured with or without LPS under hypoxia or normoxia (Fig. 8). The intracellular cysteine paralleled the activity of system xc−, supporting the hypothesis that the induction of system xc− activity is responsible for increased GSH. It might be possible that LPS and/or oxygen inhibit the efflux of GSH from the cells, and this inhibition accounts for increased intracellular GSH. However, as shown in Fig.9, the rate of efflux of GSH was higher in the cells cultured with LPS than that in the cells cultured without LPS. The higher rate of the efflux probably reflects the higher intracellular GSH level, because the efflux of GSH is carrier-mediated and depends on the intracellular GSH levels (23Sagara J. Makino N. Bannai S. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1876-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unlikely that the GSH efflux system is affected by LPS and/or oxygen. Taken together, the present findings indicate that the elevation in intracellular GSH levels caused by LPS is dependent on the induction of xCT but not γ-GCS. By contrast, the increased intracellular GSH levels caused by diethyl maleate are due to an induction of both xCT and γ-GCS. It is worth noting that GSH levels decreased significantly in the cells treated with diethyl maleate for 4 h. This initial depletion of intracellular GSH levels seems to be the result of an enzymatic reaction between GSH and diethyl maleate catalyzed by glutathione S-transferase (24Chasseaud L.F. Adv. Cancer Res. 1979; 29: 175-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar).Figure 9Effect of LPS on GSH efflux in macrophages incubated under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. Macrophages were incubated under hypoxia (2% O2) for 1 h, and the medium was replaced by fresh medium (Cont) containing 1 ng/ml LPS (LPS). The cells were further incubated under hypoxia (2% O2, open bars) or normoxia (20% O2, striped bars) for 11 h, and efflux of GSH was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each point represents the mean ± S.D. (n = 4–6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In a variety of types of cells in culture, the intracellular GSH level is regulated by the activity of system xc− (7Bannai S. Tateishi N. J. Membrane Biol. 1986; 89: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). γ-GCS is known to be the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH synthesis and also regulates GSH level. The enzyme is induced by various stress agents including the electrophilic agent, diethyl maleate (25Sekhar K.R. Long M. Long J. Xu Z.Q. Summar M.L. Freeman M.L. Radiat. Res. 1997; 147: 592-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This agent also induces the activity of system xc− (5Sato H. Fujiwara K. Sagara J. Bannai S. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, the increase in intracellular GSH level caused by diethyl maleate is most likely caused by the induction of both γ-GCS and system xc−. In the present study, we have demonstrated that LPS and oxygen strongly induce the expression of xCT mRNA without significantly altering γ-GCS mRNA levels. The intracellular cysteine level was increased concomitantly with the increase in cystine transport activity. The increase in the intracellular GSH level by LPS reflects the increase in intracellular cysteine. The increase in GSH level in the macrophages exposed to LPS is mainly dependent on the induced activity of system xc−, not the activity of γ-GCS. The results of the present study indicate that the induced activity of system xc− by LPS is further enhanced by oxygen. It is likely that the activity of system xc− is relatively low in unstimulated macrophages in vivo, because average oxygen tension in the peritoneum is ∼5% (26Towell M.E. Lysak I. Layne E.C. Bessman S.P. J. Appl. Physiol. 1976; 41: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Once these cells are activated by endotoxins, the activity of system xc−is induced, and oxygen or reactive oxygen species probably enhances the induction. Because GSH antagonizes the oxygen toxicity or oxidative stress, it is likely that GSH turns over rapidly in the macrophages exposed to endotoxins and oxidative stress in a pathological state such as inflammation. The response of system xc− activity to LPS and oxygen may be advantageous to the macrophages, which are elicited into the inflammatory regions. Recently, Li et al. (27Li H. Marshall Z.M. Whorton A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C803-C811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that chronic exposure of bovine aortic endothelial cells toS-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (NO donor) led to a concentration-dependent increase in cystine transport activity and that the increased cystine transport activity is mediated by system xc−. It might be that the induction of xCT mRNA in macrophages by LPS is mediated by NO produced by the cells. However, as we demonstrated previously (9Shibazaki T. Fujiwara M. Sato H. Fujiwara K. Abe K. Bannai S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1311: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), NO production by the macrophages incubated with 1 ng/ml LPS was almost negligible. Nevertheless, the activity of system xc− reaches maximum by 1 ng/ml LPS. Thus, the involvement of NO in the induction of xCT mRNA under the conditions used in the present study is eliminated. We have identified several AP-1 binding sites in the 5′-flanking region of the xCT gene. Several AP-1 sites also exist in the 5′-flanking region of the human 4F2hc gene (28Gottesdiener K.M. Karpinski B.A. Lindsten T. Strominger J.L. Jones N.H. Thompson C.B. Leiden J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3809-3819Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These sites may be involved in the regulation of the expression of xCT and 4F2hc. However, induction of system xc−activity by phorbol myristate acetate is very low in comparison with LPS under normoxia (5Sato H. Fujiwara K. Sagara J. Bannai S. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), suggesting only a limited role for AP-1 in the stimulation of xCT mRNA transcription by LPS. We have also found that there is a putative NF-κB binding site in the 5′-flanking region. NF-κB plays a central role in the regulation of many genes involved in cellular defense mechanisms and expression of cytokines. Reactive oxygen species have been proposed as the intermediate second messengers involved in the activation of NF-κB by TNF-α and IL-1 (29Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3387) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that the LPS signal is mediated by the Toll-like receptor 4 in the presence of CD14 and activates NF-κB in macrophages (30Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Takada H. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). Perhaps NF-κB is one of the candidate transcription factors involved in the induction of xCT mRNA by LPS and oxygen. However, in the presence of LPS, the activation of NF-κB derived from the macrophages cultured under hypoxia seemed to be similar to that derived from the cells cultured under normoxia (Fig.5). These results are inconsistent with those of the uptake of cystine. In addition, NF-κB was hardly activated by 1 ng/ml LPS, whereas induction of system xc− activity was maximally activated by 1 ng/ml (5Sato H. Fujiwara K. Sagara J. Bannai S. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In contrast, NF-κB was potently activated by 1000 ng/ml LPS, nevertheless expression of xCT in cells treated with 1000 ng/ml LPS was significantly lower than that in the cells treated with 1 ng/ml LPS. These results suggest that other signaling pathway(s) exist downstream of the signal transduction involved in the induction of xCT mRNA by LPS and oxygen, although it is not clear at present which transcription factor is involved in the induction of xCT mRNA by LPS and oxygen. Studies using transcription factor Nrf2-knockout mice have revealed that expression of phase II enzymes is regulated by Nrf2, whose activity is induced by oxidative stress and electrophilic agents (31Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3088) Google Scholar). Transcription factor Nrf2 is thought to bind to the electrophile response element (EpRE) in the 5′-flanking region of these genes and to enhance the activity of transcription. The gene for γ-GCS contains the EpRE in its 5′-flanking region, and this region is important for inducible expression of γ-GCS by the electrophilic agent (32Mulcahy R.T. Wartman M.A. Bailey H.H. Gipp J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7445-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). We have found that the mouse xCTgene also contains an EpRE-like sequence in its 5′-flanking region (Fig. 4), suggesting that its expression is regulated by the electrophilic agent in a manner similar to that documented for γ-GCS. Recently, we have shown that in peritoneal macrophages from Nrf2-deficient mice, LPS still potently induces the activity of system xc−, whereas diethyl maleate does not (33Ishii T. Itoh K. Takahashi S. Sato H. Yanagawa T. Katoh Y. Bannai S. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16023-16029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). This result indicates that the signal initiated by LPS is transduced by a different mechanism from EpRE-mediated transcription. Gene expression of xCT seems to be an interesting model system for study of signal transduction from LPS, because the expression is regulated by a pathophysiological concentration of LPS and is oxygen-sensitive. We thank Dr J. K. Andersen for kindly providing the cDNA for mouse γ-GCS."

A full-length cDNA of 365 nucleotides encoding the precursor of BeKm-1 was isolated using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction technique from mRNA obtained from scorpion telsons. Sequence analysis of the cDNA revealed that the precursor contains a signal peptide of 21 amino acid residues. The mature toxin consists of 36 amino acid residues.

K+ channels are involved in neuroendocrine secretion, cell volume regulation, electrolyte balance, and regulation of levels of excitability. K+ channels have been classified according to their biophysical and pharmacological characteristic (2Christie M.J. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1995; 22: 944-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recent molecular cloning of a large number of K+ channels has resulted in a classification into structural classes including the 2-transmembrane K+ channels (inward rectifiers), the 4-transmembrane K+ channels (2P domain channels), and the 6-transmembrane K+ channels (voltage-dependent, Ca2+-activated, or cyclic nucleotide gated) (seee.g. Ref. 3Coetzee W.A. Amarillo Y. Chiu J. Chow A. Lau D. McCormack T. Moreno H. Nadal M.S. Ozaita Pountney A. Saganich M. Vega-Saenz de Miera E. Rudy B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 233-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Natural toxins are useful probes for evaluating the involvement of K+ channels in cell activity, and for investigating K+ channel structure and localization. In recent years, peptide toxins that block various K+ channels with high affinity have been purified from diverse animal venoms (see Refs. 4Rowan E.G. Harvey A.L. Braz. J. Med. Biol.

The largest group of K+ channel peptide inhibitors is the family of neurotoxic peptides found in scorpion venoms. These peptides block, in nanomolar concentrations, both voltage-gated and Ca2+-activated K+ channels in a wide variety of cell types, and generally contain 31–40 amino acid residues cross-linked by three or four disulfide bridges (5Miller C.

These toxins have been intensively studied using biochemical, structural, and electrophysiological methods. Both natural and mutated recombinant scorpion short chain toxins have also been used to identify the pore region (9MacKinnon R. Miller C. Science. 1989; 245: 1382-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 10MacKinnon R. Heginbotham L. Abramson T.

Despite rapid advances in the molecular biology of K+channels, the subunit composition and the physiological role of several K+ channel subtypes are still unclear. That is why the identification and characterization of ligands that interact specifically with ion channels is critical not only for defining their structural and functional organization, but also to elucidate the contribution of specific ion channels to certain physiological phenomena. A score of years ago Brown and co-workers (17Brown D.A. Adams P.R. Nature. 1980; 283: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) discovered the M-current, a voltage-dependent potassium current in sympathetic neurons that is suppressed by muscarinic acetylcholinic receptor activity. M-channels open at resting potentials and are slowly activated by membrane depolarization. They play a key role in controlling repetitive firing in many neurons (and hence may be of significance to normal cognitive function, dementia, and epilepsy), and are regulated by a variety of G protein-coupled receptors. The 4-kDa polypeptide BeKm-1 was previously isolated from the venom of the Central Asian scorpion Buthus eupeus, and characterized as the first peptide inhibitor of the M-like current in NG108-15 mouse neuroblastoma × rat glioma cells (1Filippov A.K. Kozlov S.A. Pluzhnikov K.A. Grishin E.V. Brown D.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It was shown that BeKm-1 affected neither transient and delayed rectifier K+ current nor Na+ current. The molecular constituents underlying the native M-current and M-like currents have remained an intriguing puzzle. Recently, the ether-a-go-go gene(EAG)1 K+ channel was suggested to contribute to the mammalian M-channel underlying the native M-current in neurons (18Stansfeld C. Ludwig J. Roeper J. Weseloh R. Brown D. Pongs O. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 13-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Later, heteromeric KCNQ2/KCNQ3 channels were demonstrated to contribute to the native M-current (19Wang H.S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). During the last year, the M-like current described in NG108-15 cells has been reported to contain two components: a “fast” and a “slow,” which have been suggested to be carried by KCNQ2/KCNQ3 and channels encoded by the mouse ether-a-go-go-related gene(mERG1), respectively (20Selyanko A.A.

Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The study of the action of BeKm-1 on these different K+-channel types might throw light upon the true toxin target in the cell. In heart, both KCNQ1 channels and ERG channels play significant roles in the repolarization of the action potential. Mutations in either channel gene result in a prolongation of the QT-interval on the electrocardiogram and give rise to long QT syndrome. Long QT syndrome is a disorder that may cause syncope and sudden death resulting from episodic ventricular arrhytmias and ventricular fibrillation. Inherited long QT type 2 results from mutaions in the human ERG, originally referred to as hERG. As novel members of the ERG family emerge, the terminology hERG1 seems more appropriate. This paper presents the total amino acid sequence of BeKm-1 deduced from cDNA sequencing and the biological properties of the recombinant BeKm-1 and of the three mutants containing point changes in the COOH-terminal region of the toxin. In the present study, we have investigated the action of recombinant BeKm-1 on native M-like current in NG108-15 cells, and directly on cloned human KCNQ- and hERG1 potassium channels. Native BeKm-1 toxin was purified from the scorpion venom as described previously (1Filippov A.K. Kozlov S.A. Pluzhnikov K.A. Grishin E.V. Brown D.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Disulfide bonds of the purified toxin were reduced with dithiothreitol, and SH-groups were modified with 4-vinylpyridine (22Kawasaki I. Itano H.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 48: 546-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The modified toxin was digested with Staphylococus aureusprotease V8 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 12–14 h in 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, at a ratio of 1 μg of enzyme per 25 μg of toxin or with trypsin at 37 °C for 16 h in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.5 (ratio enzyme:toxin 1:20). The digests were fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC on an Ultrasphere ODS column (2 × 250 mm) using an acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of BeKm-1 and its internal peptides were determined by automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems Sequencer (470A protein sequencer) on-line with the phenylthiohydantoin analyzer (120A analyzer). Total RNA was isolated by a guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol chloroform method (23Kiyatkin N. Dulubova I. Grishin E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) from scorpion venom glands frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after sacrificing. Poly(A)-rich RNA was prepared from total RNA by two-cycle chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose as described (24Aviv H. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 1408-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (5183) Google Scholar). Reverse transcriptase (RT) reaction was performed with 2 μg of mRNA (pre-heated at 70 °C for 5 min) in a total reaction volume of 20 μl of 1 × RT buffer (U.S. Biochemical). The downstream primer used was the primer RLdT with the sequence 5′-GAGAATTCGGATCCCTGCAGAAGCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′. Other components of the RT reaction were 0.5 mm of each dNTP, 1 unit/μml RNAsin, 100 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. 1 μl of this reaction mixture was used in 50 μl of polymerase chain reaction. PCR was carried out with denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 1 min at 50 °C, and extension for 1 min at 72 °C. Oligonucleotide primers used were sense T1 (codes for the predicted amino acid sequence from Arg1 to Lys6of BeKm-1 with codon degeneracy), 5′-GGAATTCG(G/A/T/C)CC(G/A/T/C)AC(G/A/T/C)GA(C/T)ATAAA(A/G)TG-3′, and antisense RL, 5′-GAGAATTCGGATCCCTGCAGAAGCTT-3′. The 220-bp fragment was gel purified, digested with EcoRI/PstI, and ligated to similarly prepared vector pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene).Escherichia coli MH1 was used for plasmid propagation. The recombinant clones were analyzed with the standard technique (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and sequenced on both strands using the Sanger (26Sanger F. Nisclen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52655) Google Scholar) dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. 5′-RACE was performed according to the anchored PCR technique described (27Loh E.Y. Elliott J.F. Cwirla S. Lanier L.L. Davis M.M. Science. 1989; 243: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). A poly(dG) tail sequence was introduced to the first strand cDNA with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (U. S. Biochemical) in 1 × terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase buffer with 1 mm dGTP for 15 min at 37 °C; the reaction was stopped by heating at 70 °C for 10 min. Amplification was performed using one specific primer T2 corresponding to the 3′-flanking region of the cDNA of BeKm-1 (5′-GCATTACATACTTTCATTATAAATCTG-3′) and poly(dC) primer C13 (5′-GTGAATTCCTTAACCCCCCCCCCCCC-3′). The denaturation step was at 94 °C for 30 s, the annealing step was at 57 °C for 1 min, and the extension was at 72 °C for 1 min. Amplification was performed for 30 cycles and the product was analyzed. An appropriate size region was cut from the gel and directly reamplified with a mixture of universal primer M13 and M13-C13 (5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGAATTCCTTAACCCCCCCCCCCCC-3′) as the primers for the poly(dG) end at the ratio of 10:1 and the T2 primer. Amplification was performed in the same conditions for 12 cycles. Two PCR bands ∼250 and 300 bp were reamplified separately with M13 and the T3 primer, corresponding to C terminus of BeKm-1 (5′-CCATTCACGCACCTTCCATTAGTC-3′). The PCR products were cloned using AdvanTAgeTM PCR Cloning Kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's procedure and sequenced. The following nucleotide probes were used for mutagenesis: R27K, 5′-CAAAAACCATT-CACGCACTTTCCATTAGTCTTCCC-3′; F32K, 5′-CGAATTCTAAAAACAGTCGCACTTACCATTCACGCAC-3′. Mutated codons are underlined. Mutagenesis of Arg27 was achieved using two sequential polymerase chain reactions as described (28Park C.-S. Miller C. Neuron. 1992; 9: 307-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding BeKm-1 was amplified by PCR. The forward primer was nondegenerate oligonucleotide E1, 5′-GGAATTCGGACGACGACGACAAGCGACCTACAGATATAAAATGCAG-3′, containing an EcoRI restriction enzyme site (italicized) and corresponding to five codons encoding an enterokinase cleavage site and NH2-terminal residues 1–6 of BeKm-1. Primer E2, 5′-CGAATTCTAAAAACAGTCGCAAAAACCATTCACGC-3′, or F32K primer in the case of F32K-contained mutants, were used as the reverse primers. Both of them carried an EcoRI restriction enzyme site (italicized) and corresponded to the stop codon and COOH-terminal residues 28–36 of BeKm-1. The PCR fragments encoding mature and mutated BeKm-1 were gel purified, digested with EcoRI, and cloned into the expression vector pEZZ18 (Protein A gene Fusion Vector, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Clones were screened for the presence and orientation of the inserts by PCR. The resulting constructs were checked by sequencing and used to transform E. coli HB101 stain for protein production (29Boyer H.W. Roulland-Dussoix D. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 41: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (2571) Google Scholar). The wild type and mutated genes of BeKm-1 were expressed in the periplasm of E. coli as a fusion protein with two IgG-binding domains (ZZ) of staphylococcal Protein A. E. coli HB101 cells harboring the expression vectors were cultured at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. After 30 h the cells were harvested, resuspended in TS solution (50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl), and lysed by ultrasonication. After ultrasonication, the mixture was centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 rpm to remove any remaining insoluble particles. The supernatant was applied to an IgG-Sepharose 6FF column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed first with TS solution, containing 1 m NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20 and then with TS solution. The bound proteins were eluted with 0.5 m acetic acid, pH 3.4, and immediately lyophilized. Purity of the hybrid proteins was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207180) Google Scholar). The toxins were cleaved from fusion proteins by enterokinase (31Mihailova A.G. Rumsh L.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (1 μg/50 μg of fusion protein) at 37 °C in 50 mmTris buffer, pH 8.0, for up to 36 h. The recombinant toxins were purified from the cleavage mixture by chromatography on a reverse phase HPLC column (Delta Pak C18 300-Å pore, 3.9 × 300 mm, Waters) using an acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The fractions containing recombinant toxins were rechromatographed on an ODS Ultrasphere column (4.6 × 150 mm, Beckman). Mass spectrometry and NH2-terminal amino acid determination verified the composition of the purified material. The peptide content was determined using the bicincholinic acid method (32Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18638) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Mass analysis of the recombinant toxins was performed in a VISION 2000-time of flight mass spectrometer with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization, Thermo Bioanalysis Corp. (United Kingdom). NG108-15 mouse neuroblastoma × rat glioma cells were cultured and differentiated as described previously (32Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18638) Google Scholar). Recordings were made in the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp, at room temperature (20–25 °C). The perfusing solution comprised (mm): NaCl 144, KCl 2.5, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 0.5, HEPES 5, and glucose 10, adjusted to pH 7.4 with Tris base Electrodes (2–4 MΩ) were filled with a solution containing (mm): K acetate 90, KCl 20, Hepes 40, MgCl2 3, EGTA 3, Na2ATP 3, and Na-GTP 0.3, adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH. Recombinant and mutated BeKm-1 were dissolved in water at 100 μm, and added to the circulating bath solution to give a final concentration of 100 nm. To record the M-like current, cells were voltage-clamped with discontinuous (“switching”) amplifier (Axoclamp-2A, Axon Instruments, Inc.) with sampling a voltage at 6–8 kHz (50% duty cycle). Commands were generated via Digidata 1200 interface using pClamp 6 software (Axon Instruments). A standard voltage step protocol for M-current recording was used (33Robbins J. Trouslard J. Marsh S.J. Brown D.A. J. Physiol. 1992; 451: 159-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 34Adams P.R. Brown D.A. Constanti A. J. Physiol. 1982; 332: 223-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 35Brown D.A. Higashida H. J. Physiol. 1988; 397: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), in which cells were held at −28 mV and stepped for 1 s to potentials between −18 and −128 mV, by 10-mV negative increments. Current amplitudes at the end of each step were measured for subsequent construction of current-voltage relations using pClamp 6 software. The leak component of current was estimated by extrapolating a line fitted by eye from the region of the current-voltage relationship (negative to −60 mV) where only linear (ohmic) currents were observed. The resulting numerical data for control and BeKm-1-inhibited current records were processed in Quattro Pro version 5.0, and percentage reduction of the current at −28 mV was calculated. Graphs were created in Microcal Origin version 4.1. In addition, the current was monitored during toxin application by repeated steps from −28 mV to −68 and −108 mV, to ascertain when a steady-state block was reached. HEK-293 cells were incubated for 3–5 h in Opti-MEM medium with a transfection mixture containing: 2.0 μg of the appropriate K+ channel cDNA (α-subunits: KCNQ2-KCNQ4, hEAG, rELK1, and hERG1; β-subunits: KCNE1 and KCNE2), LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies), and Plus reagent (Life Technologies). In experiments with transiently transfected cells, recordings were performed 24–72 h post-transfection using enhanced green fluorescent protein as a marker of successful transfection. Some experiments were performed on HEK-293 cells stably expressing K+ channels (hSK1, rSK2, hIK, hBK, or hERG1+KCNE1). For details see Refs. 36Jensen B.S. Strøbæk D. Christophersen P. Jørgensen T.D.

SK, IK, and BK currents were recorded after application of voltage ramps ranging from −80 mV to +80 mV (duration 200 ms, holding potential 0 mV). The bath solution was an extracellular K+solution. Cells expressing KCNQ2/KCNQ3 channels were bathed in an extracellular Na+ solution and the currents were activated by a 1-s step from a holding potential of −90 mV to −30 mV. In the initial experiments with the hERG1 expressing cells, the currents were activated by a voltage protocol reassembling a cardiac action potential. In the protocol the cells were held at −90 mV and depolarized to +30 mV followed by 8 hyperpolarizing ramps altogether shaping an action potential with a duration of 315 ms. The composition of solutions used in experiments performed on HEK-293 cells consisted of extracellular Na+ solution (mm): NaCl 140, KCl 4, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1, and Hepes 10 (pH 7.4, titrated with NaOH), the extracellular K+ solution (mm): KCl 144, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1, and Hepes 10 (pH 7.4, titrated with KOH); and the intracellular solutions (mm): KCl 110, CaCl2 5.1–7.6, MgCl2 1.2–1.4, Na2ATP 4, EGTA 10/KOH 30, and Hepes 10 (pH 7.2, titrated with KOH). The partial amino acid sequence of BeKm-1 was determined from the NH2-terminal sequence and the sequences of the peptides derived from proteolytic digestion. The sequence of the NH2-terminal amino acid fragment was obtained after reducing and modification of cysteine residues. The hydrolysis of the modified toxin chain using V8 proteinase fromS. aureus resulted in two peptides, which were sequenced. The sequences of these peptides had an overlapping region, and the primary structure of the BeKm-1 fragment Arg1-Cys28 was determined. Amino acid sequences of some peptides obtained from tryptic hydrolysis of native BeKm-1 corresponded to the established regions of the toxin molecule. To determine the full amino acid sequence and to predict the structure of the toxin precursor, the cDNA encoding BeKm-1 was isolated. Briefly, the first strand cDNA was synthesized using poly(A)-rich RNA by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and first-strand primer (RLdT) containing restriction sites for cloning. Degenerate oligonucleotide primer T1 was designed using amino acid sequence information and codes for the toxin region from Arg1 to Lys6. PCR using RL and T1 primers yielded a single band of the expected size (220 bp). This PCR product was subcloned in pBluescript between thePstI and EcoRI sites and sequenced. All cDNA sequences had one major open reading frame (ORF), encoding an amino acid sequence corresponding to the partial amino acid sequence of BeKm-1 obtained from primary structural analysis of the native toxin. 5′-RACE was used to identify the unknown sequence of the 5′-end of the mRNA. 5′-Flanking sequence information was obtained using the anchored PCR technique (27Loh E.Y. Elliott J.F. Cwirla S. Lanier L.L. Davis M.M. Science. 1989; 243: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). In this procedure, mRNA was first transcribed with reverse transcriptase and a poly(dG) tail was added to the 3′-end of the strand with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. The product was then amplified with a specific 3′-primer (in our case a T2 oligonucleotide) and another oligonucleotide consisting of a poly(dC) tail (C13 and M13-C13 primers). Series of consistent PCR generated two bands of about 300 and 250 bp with cloned cDNA sequences that had long and short 5′-untranslated region, respectively, that may be a result of partial degradation of the mRNA. The full-length cDNA of BeKm-1, together with its 5′- and 3′-untranslated region, is shown in Fig.1. The full-length of the cDNA, excluding the poly(A) tail, was 365 bp and contained a 171-bp ORF encoding a 57-amino acid peptide. The first ATG was located at position 121. The 3′-untranslated region of the cDNA contained a putative polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) ∼16 nucleotides upstream from the poly(A) tail. The ORF encoded a polypeptide precursor for BeKm-1 in which the first 21 amino acid residues are predicted to be a signal peptide followed by the mature 36-amino acid peptide. The signal peptide has structural features characteristic of secreted proteins, and shows homology to the published leader peptides of KTx, KTx2 (39Legros C. Bougis P.E. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and Ts κ (40Legros C. Oughuideni R. Darbon H. Rochat H. Bougis P.E. Martin-Eauclaire M.F.

To obtain significant quantities of the peptide and its mutated forms for structure-function investigation, the E. coli expression system was adopted. We expressed the wild-type BeKm-1 and three mutated toxins (R27K, F32K, and R27K/F32K) as fusion proteins with two IgG-binding domains of Protein A from S. aureus. Sense and antisense primers, both with a specific restriction enzyme site, were used to amplify the BeKm-1 toxin cDNA for cloning into the pEZZ18 expression vector. The pentapeptide sequence DDDDK, which is recognized by the restriction protease enterokinase, was inserted immediately upstream of the BeKm-1 sequence. A translation termination codon was inserted at the end of the BeKm-1 cDNA. Site-directed mutants were constructed using PCR, and each mutated plasmid was verified by sequencing. The final constructs were transformed into the E. coli strain HB101. Fusion proteins were directly secreted into the periplasm of HB101, making them easy to purify by affinity chromatography on an IgG-Sepharose column. The size of the affinity purified proteins observed from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was in accordance with that expected from a fusion protein of ZZ and BeKm-1. The yield of fused toxins varied from 2 to 6 mg/liter of culture. The fusion proteins were treated with enterokinase and purified by reverse-phase HPLC to obtain the pure recombinant toxins. The recombinant, enterokinase-digested BeKm-1 had the same retention time as the native toxin when fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC (Fig.2). Homogeneity of recombinant BeKm-1 and of each mutant was further confirmed by analytical reverse-phase HPLC employing an Ultrasphere ODS column. The total yield of purified recombinant peptides was"

The in vitro DNA decatenation activity of recombinant topo IIα and -β is inhibited by association with catalytically inactive, recombinant HDAC1. We provide evidence for the in vivo significance of the topo II-HDAC1 association, showing that inhibition of HDAC activity with trichostatin A suppresses apoptosis induced by the topo II poison etoposide, but not by the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin. We suggest that chromatin remodeling by an HDAC-containing complex facilitates both topo II-catalyzed DNA rearrangement and etoposide-induced DNA damage in vivo.

In humans, this is achieved by the unique decatenation activity of DNA topoisomerase II (topo1 II). Topo II is essential for normal and neoplastic cellular proliferation, and several common anti-cancer drugs exert their cytotoxic effects through this enzyme (1Froelich-Ammon S.J. Osheroff N. J.

Cell Res. 2000; 256: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Topoisomerase II activity in mammalian cells has been attributed to at least two isoforms. Topo IIα (p170) associates with chromosomes during prophase and throughout mitosis and is thought to be a major component of the nuclear scaffold (3Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar, 4Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). It has a peak of expression during G2/M of the cell cycle (5Austin C.A. Marsh K.L. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In contrast, the closely related topo IIβ (p180) isoform is thought to have a more general role in DNA metabolism, with expression levels that remain relatively constant during cell and growth cycles (5Austin C.A. Marsh K.L. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Both isoforms interact with the C-terminal region of the tumor suppressor protein, p53 (6Cowell I.G. Okorokov A.L. Cutts S.A. Padget K. Bell M. Milner J. Austin C.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). p53 is a component of a multiprotein complex that contains the histone deacetylase HDAC1 and the corepressor Sin3a (7Murphy M.

The NuRD/Mi-2 repression complex contains both nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase activities (12Zhang Y. LeRoy G. Seelig H.-P. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1998; 95: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), whereas the Sin3 complex contains only the latter (9Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar). Both complexes contain the Rb-associated proteins RbAp46 and RbAp48 and associate with various, sometimes DNA-binding, transcriptional repressor and corepressor proteins (11Ng H.H. Bird A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 121-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The Xenopus NuRD complex (which contains homologues of mammalian HDAC1, RbAp48, and the methyl-CpG-binding protein MBD3) copurifies with DNA topoisomerase II (13Wade P.A. Gegonne A. Jones P.L. Ballestar E. Aubry F. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that mammalian topo II isoforms and HDAC1 may interact in a multiprotein complex. Here we show that HDAC1 and DNA topoisomerase II isoforms physically interact both in vivo and in vitro. We also show that the HDAC inhibitor, TSA, suppresses apoptosis induced by the topo II poison etoposide, but not by the topo I inhibitor camptothecin. Our results raise the interesting possibility that chromatin remodeling by a topo II-HDAC-containing complex is involved in topo II-catalyzed DNA rearrangements and/or generation of etoposide-induced DNA strand breaksin vivo. The human cell lines HL-60 (promyelocytic leukemia; p53 null) and HeLa were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 8% fetal calf serum. Regions of HDAC1 cDNA were subcloned into the pGEX3T-4 family of vectors (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and verified by sequencing. GST fusion proteins were purified essentially as described previously (6Cowell I.G. Okorokov A.L. Cutts S.A. Padget K. Bell M. Milner J. Austin C.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Recombinant human DNA topoisomerase IIα and -β were made in a yeast system and purified as described previously (14Austin C.A.

Characterization and use of rabbit polyclonal antibodies against topo IIα (18511α) and topo IIβ (18513β) are described elsewhere (15Cowell I.G. Willmore E. Chalton D. Marsh K.L. Jazrawi E. Fisher L.M. Austin C.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 243: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A polyclonal rabbit antibody against mammalian HDAC1 was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 467–482 and affinity-purified as described previously (16White D.A. Belyaev N.D. Turner B.M. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1999; 10: 417-424Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Antibody against topo I was obtained commercially (TopoGen, number 2012). HeLa whole cell extract was prepared by lysing cells in incubation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing 1.0% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, protease inhibitors (0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and “Complete MiniTM” tablets, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 50 units of DNase I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) per 108cells. The lysate was incubated in ice for 10 min, and the clarified supernatant was used in standard immunoprecipitations as described previously (6Cowell I.G. Okorokov A.L. Cutts S.A. Padget K. Bell M. Milner J. Austin C.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Nan X. Ng H.-H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2804) Google Scholar). To confirm specificity, cognate blocking peptide (10 μg) was incubated with the antibody for 30 min before the addition of extract. Preimmune serum and irrelevant antisera were used as controls. GST pull down experiments used equivalent amounts of GST fusion proteins prebound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (6Cowell I.G. Okorokov A.L. Cutts S.A. Padget K. Bell M. Milner J. Austin C.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Interactions with recombinant topo IIα were performed in incubation buffer containing 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. Yeast strains CG-1945 from a Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System II kit (CLONTECH) were transformed with appropriate binary combinations of constructs containing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and the GAL4 activation domain, as recommended by the manufacturers.HIS3 reporter gene expression was assayed on plates (6Cowell I.G. Okorokov A.L. Cutts S.A. Padget K. Bell M. Milner J. Austin C.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), in the presence of 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole to suppress background growth (18Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Histone deacetylase activity was assayed as described previously (17Nan X. Ng H.-H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2804) Google Scholar). DNA strand-passage assays were performed on kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) as described previously (6Cowell I.G. Okorokov A.L. Cutts S.A. Padget K. Bell M. Milner J. Austin C.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). HL-60 cells were grown until in mid-log phase, then treated with 100 nm (30 ng/ml) TSA for 0.5 h before additional treatments with either 100 μm (59 μg/ml) etoposide or 5.8 μm (2 μg/ml) camptothecin for 1.5 h. Control samples were treated with the dilution vehicles (0.1% Me2SO and 0.1% ethanol). All cells were observed in situ with phase-contrast microscopy to count cells with an apoptotic morphology, after staining with 10 μm Hoechst 33342 with the addition of 0.1 μm propidium iodide to visualize necrotic cells. Cells were also labeled with either FITC-annexin V conjugate (PharMingen) or with the FAM-VAD-FMK reagent provided in the CaspaTagTM fluorescein caspase activity kit (Intergen). Labeled cells were detected by indirect fluorescence microscopy (all cells) or by FACS analysis on a Coulter Epics flow cytometer. HeLa whole cell extract was immunoprecipitated with affinity-purified antibody against mammalian HDAC1 and precipitated material tested for the presence of topo IIα by Western blotting (Fig.1 A). Anti-HDAC1 brought down easily detectable amounts of topo IIα. There was no detectable immunoprecipitation of topo IIα with preimmune serum, and immunoprecipitation was completely abolished by inclusion in the incubation mix of the peptide used to raise the anti-HDAC1 antibody (Fig. 1 A). The anti-HDAC1 antibody did not immunoprecipitate detectable levels of topo IIβ (data not shown), and antibody to topo IIβ brought down only a comparatively small amount of the α isoform (Fig. 1 A). However, antisera against both topo IIα and topo IIβ immunoprecipitate 6–9% of total deacetylase activity from HeLa whole cell extract (Fig. 1 B). The activity is fully inhibited by TSA. Negative control immunoprecipitations with preimmune serum, an irrelevant antibody (anti-CDK7), or an antibody against DNA topoisomerase I (topo I) did not bring down activity above that of the no-antibody control. We performed in vitro pull down experiments of endogenous protein with GST fusion proteins. Full-length mammalian HDAC1, tagged with a GST moiety, but not GST itself, bound endogenous topo IIα in whole cell extract (Fig. 2 A). In the converse experiment, a GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal domain (CTD) of topo IIα was able to pull down endogenous HDAC1 (Fig. 2 B). The fusion protein of the CTD of topo IIβ was also able to pull down small amounts of HDAC1 (Fig. 2 B). Fusion proteins of the CTD of topo IIα and topo IIβ were able to pull down between 9 and 11% of deacetylase activity (Fig.2 C), comparable with the amounts brought down by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1 B). Whereas GST-topo IIβ pulls down less HDAC1, as detected on Western blots, than comparable amounts of GST-topo IIα (Fig. 2 B), the two different fusion proteins bring down similar amounts of deacetylase activity (Fig.2 C). A possible explanation for this quantitative discrepancy is that other deacetylases, in addition to HDAC1, are preferentially associated with topo IIβ. GST fusion proteins containing the C-terminal domain of HDAC1 interact with recombinant topo IIα (Fig.3). This domain has previously been shown to contain the LXCXE motif (residues 414–418), that appears to mediate interactions with the retinoblastoma protein pRb (19Brehm A. Miska E.A. McCance D.J. Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1998; 391: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). In contrast, an N-terminal HDAC1 fusion protein, containing the catalytic site, showed minimal interaction with recombinant topo IIα (Fig. 3). A yeast two-hybrid system (18Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) was used to test for direct in vivo interaction between topo II and HDAC1. Inserts were constructed to express the topo IIα and topo IIβ C-terminal domains (6Cowell I.G. Okorokov A.L. Cutts S.A. Padget K. Bell M. Milner J. Austin C.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and the HDAC1 region 220–482 (Fig. 3). Expression of the integrated, GAL4-dependent HIS3 reporter gene was used to detect interactions between “bait” and “prey” proteins in vivo. Topo IIα CTD or topo IIβ CTD as bait, together with HDAC1 as prey, allowed growth of large colonies (over 2 mm diameter) on His-selective medium. All three proteins were ineffective when expressed individually (Fig. 4). To explore the biological significance of the topo II-HDAC1 interaction, we tested the ability of full-length recombinant HDAC1 to modulate the functional properties of recombinant topo IIα and -β. Both of these enzymes can decatenate kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) to minicircle monomers, a process that requires a double-stranded break in the kDNA to allow strand passage. The addition of increasing amounts of HDAC1 to the reaction decreases the decatenation of kDNA by topo IIα and -β (Fig. 5). Addition of GST alone did not affect decatenation by either topo IIα and -β. We tested the effect of the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (20Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) on apoptosis induced by the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide (VP-16). Etoposide causes topoisomerase II-mediated DNA damage by increasing the steady-state concentration of covalent DNA cleavage complexes (1Froelich-Ammon S.J. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21429-21432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 2Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 4Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Cells treated with etoposide acquire an apoptotic morphology, notably the condensation of chromatin at the nuclear periphery and blebbing of the plasma membrane (2Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 21Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 69: 383-424Crossref Scopus (2450) Google Scholar). HL-60 cells displayed apoptotic chromatin condensation after only 1.5-h treatment with either 100 μm etoposide or 5.8 μm camptothecin, an inhibitor of topo I (Fig. 6 A). Plasma membrane changes during early apoptosis include the exposure of phosphatidylserine to the external cellular environment (22Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4627) Google Scholar). This change was measured by binding of FITC-conjungated annexin V and counting of labeled cells by fluorescence microscopy (Fig.6 B). Activation of cysteine aspartyl proteases (caspases) (21Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 69: 383-424Crossref Scopus (2450) Google Scholar) during the apoptosis of HL-60 cells was assayed with a fluorescent substrate and FACS analysis of viable cells (Fig. 6 C). Chromatin condensation, membrane changes, and caspase activation all demonstrated that prior treatment with 100 nm TSA suppresses the apoptotic effect of etoposide (Fig. 6, A–C). In contrast, TSA did not affect apoptosis induced by the topo I inhibitor camptothecin (Fig. 6, A–C). Note that topo I does not associate with detectable amounts of deacetylase activity (Fig.1 B). An identical anti-apoptotic effect of TSA treatment was also observed for the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line H1299 and HeLa cells (data not shown). The results presented show that the histone deacetylase HDAC1 is physically associated with each of the two isoforms of human topoisomerase II, topo IIα and topo IIβ. The association occursin vivo, being detectable by coimmunoprecipitation from human cell extracts and by yeast two-hybrid assay. It also occursin vitro. GST-coupled recombinant topo IIα and topo IIβ pull down significant amounts of HDAC activity from cell extracts, while recombinant HDAC1 inhibits the in vitro decatenation activity of recombinant topo IIα. Since completion of the work reported here, Tsai et al. (23Tsai S.C. Valkov N. Yang W.M. Gump J. Sullivan D. Seto E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) have reported essentially the same findings for the two very similar deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2. Interestingly, whereas Tsai et al. (23Tsai S.C. Valkov N. Yang W.M. Gump J. Sullivan D. Seto E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) find evidence for an interaction between topo IIα and various regions of HDAC2, including N-terminal residues 1–57, we find that only the C-terminal region of HDAC1 (residues 220–482) interacts with topo II in vitro. These two deacetylases seem to differ in their mode of interaction with topo II. In experiments to assess the biological significance of the topo II-HDAC interaction, we analyzed the effect of the deacetylase inhibitor TSA on processes known to require topo II activity. The most striking effect so far has been on the ability of the topo II poison etoposide to drive cells into apoptosis. We show that treatment with TSA prior to the addition of etoposide suppresses apoptosis in a variety of cell lines. The effect is seen even with HL60 cells, in which apoptosis is detectable within less than 1 h, a finding that minimizes the probability that inhibition of apoptosis is due to pleiotropic effects of TSA, such as its ability to alter cell cycle progression. The inhibitory effect of TSA was detected in several p53-null cell lines, so the interaction between HDAC1 and p53 (7Murphy M. Ahn J. Walker K.K. Hoffman W.H. Evans R.M. Levine A.J. George D.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2490-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) cannot be responsible. Microscopically detectable chromatin remodeling is a diagnostic characteristic of cells in the later stages of apoptosis, and recent reports indicate that both topo II and histone acetylation play a role in this process (24Durrieu F. Samejima K. Fortune J.M. Kandels-Lewis S. Osheroff N. Earnshaw W.C. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 923-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, our results indicate that this is not the stage at which TSA exerts the inhibitory effect reported here. We have shown that TSA inhibition is detectable even when using an assay that measures one of the earliest changes of apoptosis, namely the alteration in membrane phospholipids detected by binding of annexin V (22Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4627) Google Scholar). These findings argue that TSA is acting at a relatively early stage in apoptosis, prior to the onset of major changes in nuclear ultrastructure. It remains possible that TSA also effects more subtle chromatin changes, possibly those determining expression of genes required for progression through apoptosis (25Green D.R.

Indeed, recent results indicate that both topo II and changes in acetylation act at various stages in the pathways by which cells progress through apoptosis (24Durrieu F. Samejima K. Fortune J.M.

In attempting to explain the effect of TSA on etoposide-induced apoptosis, it is important to note that etoposide is a topo II poison that blocks the enzyme after DNA cleavage but prior to strand passage (4Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Covalent topoisomerase-DNA cleavage complexes accumulate in the presence of such poisons. DNA replication, transcription, or helicase activity all disrupt these complexes, releasing the DNA double-strand breaks that can precipitate apoptosis (1Froelich-Ammon S.J. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21429-21432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 4Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Reducing either the accumulation of topo II-DNA complexes, or their breakdown, will both reduce DNA damage and hence apoptosis. A possible explanation for the results presented here is that HDAC-dependent chromatin remodeling is necessary for the initiation of topo II-catalyzed DNA rearrangement or for dissociation of topo II-DNA complexes, or both. If this were the case, then HDAC inhibitors such as TSA would be expected to prevent the appearance of DNA damage in the presence of topo II poisons, and consequent progression into apoptosis, exactly as we have found. Crucially, TSA has no effect on apoptosis induced by the topo I inhibitor camptothecin. We show here that topo I is not associated with HDAC1. Further support for these ideas comes from the recent results of Tsai et al. (23Tsai S.C. Valkov N. Yang W.M. Gump J. Sullivan D. Seto E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), who show that topo II is associated not only with HDAC1/2, but also with MTA2, a protein that is part of the NuRD chromatin remodeling complex. The NuRD complex contains both HDAC1/2 and Mi-2, a protein with ATPase/helicase activity (12Zhang Y. LeRoy G. Seelig H.-P. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1998; 95: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). We and others (23Tsai S.C. Valkov N. Yang W.M. Gump J. Sullivan D. Seto E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) find that HDAC1 can inhibit the catalytic activity of topo II in vitro. This is an important confirmation of the ability of topo II and HDAC1 to interact, but is not, at first sight, consistent with the proposition outlined above that HDAC activity facilitates topo II catalysis, or its consequences. This can be resolved by noting that the GST-HDAC1 construct used to inhibit topo II in vitro is catalytically inactive, presumably because it lacks essential protein partners such as RbAp46/48 (8Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar, 11Ng H.H. Bird A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 121-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). It would be wrong to assume that catalytically active HDAC1, in the context of a multiprotein complex that includes both HDAC and chromatin remodeling activities (23Tsai S.C. Valkov N. Yang W.M. Gump J. Sullivan D. Seto E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), is also inhibitory. It might even be the case that, in vivo, topo II activity is inhibited only by association with HDAC rendered catalytically inactive by inhibitors such as TSA. Such an effect would complement the suppression of topo II activity brought about by inhibition of chromatin remodeling. We thank Dr. G. Anderson for help with the FACS analysis, Dr. J.

https://openalex.org/W2020208784,"Abstract Serum response factor is a MADS box transcription factor that binds to consensus sequences CC(A/T)6GG found in the promoter region of several serum-inducible and muscle-specific genes. In skeletal myocytes serum response factor (SRF) has been shown to heterodimerize with the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix family of factors, related to MyoD, for control of muscle gene regulation. Here we report that SRF binds to another myogenic factor, TEF-1, that has been implicated in the regulation of a variety of cardiac muscle genes. By using different biochemical assays such as affinity precipitation of protein, GST-pulldown assay, and coimmunoprecipitation of proteins, we show that SRF binds to TEF-1 both in in vitro and in vivoassay conditions. A strong interaction of SRF with TEF-1 was seen even when one protein was denatured and immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane, indicating a direct and stable interaction between SRF and TEF-1, which occurs without a cofactor. This interaction is mediated through the C-terminal subdomain of MADS box of SRF encompassing amino acids 204–244 and the putative 2nd and 3rd α-helix/β-sheet configuration of the TEA/ATTS DNA-binding domain of TEF-1. In the transient transfection assay, a positive cooperative effect of SRF and TEF-1 was observed when DNA-binding sites for both factors, serum response element and M-CAT respectively, were intact; mutation of either site abolished their synergistic effect. Similarly, an SRF mutant, SRFpm-1, defective in DNA binding failed to collaborate with TEF-1 for gene regulation, indicating that the synergistic trans-activation function of SRF and TEF-1 occurs via their binding to cognate DNA-binding sites. Our results demonstrate a novel association between SRF and TEF-1 for cardiac muscle gene regulation and disclose a general mechanism by which these two super families of factors are likely to control diversified biological functions."

The highest rates of transport and intraluminal isotope accumulation (using radiolabeled compound and a rapid filtration technique) were found in hepatic microsomes. These microsomes contain the highest amount of protein-disulfide isomerase, which is known to have a dehydroascorbate reductase activity. The steady-state level of intraluminal isotope accumulation was more than 2-fold higher in hepatic microsomes prepared from spontaneously diabetic BioBreeding/Worcester rats and was very low in fetal hepatic microsomes although the initial rate of transport was not changed. In these microsomes, the amount of protein-disulfide isomerase was similar, but the availability of protein thiols was different and correlated with dehydroascorbate uptake. The increased isotope accumulation was accompanied by a higher rate of dehydroascorbate reduction and increased protein thiol oxidation in microsomes from diabetic animals.

The suitable redox properties of these organelles are necessary for the formation and the maintenance of disulfide bonds in the secretory and plasma membrane proteins. Oxidizing conditions can be generated by the import of an oxidizing agent. It is apparently inconsistent with the above facts that these compartments contain ascorbate, a reducing compound, at high concentrations (3Daniels A.J. Dean G. Viveros O.H. Diliberto Jr., E.J.

The intraluminal accumulation of ascorbate can theoretically be explained by an active transport process or by its local generation from a membrane-permeable precursor. Whereas there are no data supporting the first possibility in the ER, the facilitated diffusion of dehydroascorbate (DHA), the oxidized form of ascorbate, has been described in rat liver microsomes. DHA uptake is presumably mediated by the glucose transporter T3 subunit of the glucose-6-phosphatase system (6Bánhegyi G. Marcolongo P. Puskás F. Fulceri R. Mandl J. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2758-2762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Local ascorbate oxidation and DHA formation have also been observed in microsomal vesicles (7Csala M. Mile V. Benedetti A. Mandl J. Bánhegyi G. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 413-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, ascorbate accumulation can be attributed to the intraluminal reduction of DHA taken up. However, enzyme(s) participating in the process and the source(s) of the reducing equivalents are unknown. Protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), a major protein of the ER lumen, is known to have DHA reductase activity (8Wells W.W. Xu D.P. Yang Y. Rocque P.A. J. Biol.

The aim of the present work was to explore the role of PDI in the intraluminal ascorbate accumulation in the ER. To this end, DHA transport, DHA reduction, and ascorbate accumulation were investigated in microsomes from various organs/cells having different PDI activities.DISCUSSIONThe transport of ascorbate and DHA through the membrane of the ER has been described in rat liver microsomal vesicles (6Bánhegyi G.

The data presented here suggest that these transports are general phenomena in microsomal vesicles prepared from various tissues or cells. However, liver microsomes only display a significant accumulation of radiolabeled compounds upon DHA addition. This accumulation is likely because of the intravesicular reduction of DHA to ascorbate. Because microsomal preparations do not contain reducing equivalents in the form of NADPH or glutathione, the main source of electrons for the reduction of DHA must be protein thiols. The reaction between protein thiol groups and DHA can even occur nonenzymatically or can be catalyzed by PDI, an abundant enzyme of the (hepatic) ER (8Wells W.W. Xu D.P. Yang Y. Rocque P.A. J. Biol.

Our results suggest that PDI activity might have a decisive role in the intraluminal DHA reduction and ascorbate accumulation; the process was the most intensive where the highest PDI activity can be found,i.e. in liver microsomes (25Bjelland S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1987; 87: 907-914Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 26Marcus N. Shaffer D. Farrar P. Green M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1309: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).To further envisage the role of PDI, DHA transport was investigated in liver microsomes from spontaneously diabetic BB/Wor rats. An increased hepatic activity of PDI in experimental streptozotocin diabetes has been reported (27Nieto A. Mira E. Castaño J.G. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), whereas others found a decrease in the same conditions (28Thomas J.H. Varandani P.T. Biochim. Biophys.

We detected an increased accumulation of radiolabeled compounds upon 14C DHA addition in microsomes from diabetic animals, although neither the level nor the activity of PDI was increased in these microsomes. Therefore, PDI activityper se cannot explain the differences in ascorbate accumulation in control and diabetic liver microsomes. The phenomenon can be explained by a different supply of reducing agents. In fact, the initial protein thiol level was higher, and the DHA-induced thiol oxidation was faster in microsomes from diabetic rats. It should be noted that streptozotocin diabetes also results in the elevation of protein thiols in liver microsomes. 2G. Nardai and P. Csermely, unpublished observation. On the other hand, fetal liver microsomes that contain low amounts of protein thiols exhibited moderate ascorbate accumulation despite their high PDI level. These findings suggest that at high PDI activity the availability of protein thiols can also determine the rate of intraluminal DHA reduction.Ascorbate has been reported to promote protein disulfide formation in secretory proteins in the ER lumen (31Csala M. Braun L. Mile V. Kardon T. Szarka A. Kupcsulik P. Mandl J. Bánhegyi G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This process is hindered in diabetes; latent or intracellular scurvy appears because of the competition for the uptake between DHA and glucose at the plasma membrane (32Ngkeekwong F.C. Ng L.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and metabolic hypoxia develops because of the excess of reducing power (33Williamson J.R. Chang K. Frangos M. Hasan K.S.

Both factors can result in decreased protein thiol oxidation in the lumen of the hepatic ER. The increased production of DHA is verified in diabetes (34Som S. Basu S. Mukherjee D. Deb S.

We detected an increased accumulation of radiolabeled compounds upon 14C DHA addition in microsomes from diabetic animals, although neither the level nor the activity of PDI was increased in these microsomes. Therefore, PDI activityper se cannot explain the differences in ascorbate accumulation in control and diabetic liver microsomes. The phenomenon can be explained by a different supply of reducing agents. In fact, the initial protein thiol level was higher, and the DHA-induced thiol oxidation was faster in microsomes from diabetic rats. It should be noted that streptozotocin diabetes also results in the elevation of protein thiols in liver microsomes. 2G. Nardai and P. Csermely, unpublished observation. On the other hand, fetal liver microsomes that contain low amounts of protein thiols exhibited moderate ascorbate accumulation despite their high PDI level. These findings suggest that at high PDI activity the availability of protein thiols can also determine the rate of intraluminal DHA reduction. Ascorbate has been reported to promote protein disulfide formation in secretory proteins in the ER lumen (31Csala M. Braun L. Mile V. Kardon T. Szarka A. Kupcsulik P. Mandl J. Bánhegyi G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This process is hindered in diabetes; latent or intracellular scurvy appears because of the competition for the uptake between DHA and glucose at the plasma membrane (32Ngkeekwong F.C. Ng L.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and metabolic hypoxia develops because of the excess of reducing power (33Williamson J.R. Chang K. Frangos M. Hasan K.S. Ido Y. Kawamura T. Nyengaard J.R. van den Enden M. Kilo C. Tilton R.G. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Both factors can result in decreased protein thiol oxidation in the lumen of the hepatic ER. The increased production of DHA is verified in diabetes (34Som S. Basu S. Mukherjee D. Deb S. Choudhury P.R. Mukherjee S. Chatterjee S.N. Chatterjee I.B. Metabolism. 1981; 30: 572-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and its accelerated uptake into the ER therefore can be regarded as a compensatory mechanism supporting protein disulfide formation in this pathological state."

Rab5, a small molecular weight GTPase, functions in the formation and maintenance of the early/sorting endosome. Overexpression of the constitutively active form, Rab5(Q79L), leads to enhanced endosome fusion resulting in the enlargement of early endosomes. Using an adenoviral expression system to regulate the time and level of Rab5(Q79L) overexpression in HeLa cells, we find that although endosomes are dramatically enlarged, the rates of transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis and recycling are unaffected. Moreover, despite the enlarged endosome phenotype, neither the rate of internalization of a fluid phase marker nor the rate of recycling of a bulk lipid marker were affected. These results suggest that GTP hydrolysis by Rab5 is rate-limiting for endosome fusion but not for endocytic trafficking and that early endosome geometry may be a less critical determinant of sorting efficiencies than previously thought.

Many receptor-ligand complexes dissociate in the mildly acidic environment of the early endosome (1Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). It has been proposed (1Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar) that endosomal morphology and resulting geometric considerations play a major role in controlling sorting efficiency in the early endosome. In this model, membrane proteins destined for recycling accumulate in long tubular extensions of the early endosome, which have a high surface to volume ratio. Fluid phase content including released ligands is deposited in the vacuolar portions of the early endosome, which, being spherical, approach a minimum surface to volume ratio. These vacuolar portions dissociate from tubular regions to carry their contents to late endosomes and/or lysosomes (3Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Rab5 is a small molecular weight GTPase associated with the plasma membrane and early/sorting endosomes. Rab5 controls homotypic early endosome fusion and thus functions in the formation of early endosomes (4Barbieri M.A. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18720-18722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M.

Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). A point mutation in the GTPase domain (glutamine to leucine; denoted as Rab5(Q79L)) reduces Rab5 GTPase activity and results in a mutant Rab5 with an increased propensity to be in the active, GTP-bound state (7Li G. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24475-24480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Expression of this constitutively active form of Rab5 enhances homotypic endosome fusion leading to the formation of enlarged early endosomes. It also has been reported that Rab5(Q79L) overexpression increases the rate of transferrin receptor uptake and decreases the rate of transferrin receptor recycling (8Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) although the mechanism for these effects remains obscure. Rab5 is preferentially associated with the vacuolar portions of the early endosome (9Sönnichsen B. DeRenzis S. Nielsen E. Rietdorf J. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 901-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar), and Rab5(Q79L) overexpression leads to the formation of large spherical endosomes as visualized in semithick sections by electron microscopy (10Stenmark H. Valencia A. Martinez O. Ullrich O. Goud B. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To test whether the Rab5(Q79L) effects on transferrin receptor endocytosis and recycling can be correlated with these dramatic changes in endosomal size and geometry, we utilized a tetracycline-regulatable adenoviral expression system that allows us to temporally control Rab5(Q79L) expression levels. The early endosomal compartment was dramatically enlarged in adenovirally infected HeLa cells overexpressing Rab5(Q79L). However, the presence of these enlarged endosomes did not alter the kinetics of endocytic membrane trafficking of either cell surface receptors or bulk membrane lipids. These unexpected results argue that geometric considerations may contribute to a lesser extent than previously assumed in determining the sorting and recycling efficiencies of the early endosomal compartment. tTA-HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM1 supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin (growth medium). Wild type and mutant (canine) Rab5a constructs (a gift of M. Zerial) were tagged with the hemagglutinin epitope on the amino terminus and subcloned into pUHD expression vectors (11Damke H. Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bujard H. Schmid S.L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 157: 209-220Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). HA-Rab5(WT)- and HA-Rab5(Q79L)-expressing cells were generated by cotransfecting the tTA-HeLa cells with cDNA that encodes HA-Rab5(WT) or HA-Rab5(Q79L) (10 μg) and the plasmid pBSpac (0.5 μg) by calcium phosphate transfection. Positive clones were selected by culture in 200 ng/ml puromycin, 400 μg/ml G418, and 2 μg/ml tetracycline and screened by Western blot for their abilities to express Rab5 48 h after induction by the removal of tetracycline (11Damke H. Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bujard H. Schmid S.L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 157: 209-220Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Stably transfected cells were cultured in the presence of 1 μg/ml tetracycline. Wild type or mutant Rab5 expression was induced by washing out the existing tetracycline with two PBS (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) washes and incubating the cells in growth medium without tetracycline for 48 h. Cells, grown on coverslips to ∼70% confluency, were washed twice with room temperature PBS and then incubated with 50 μg/ml Alexa-transferrin (Molecular Probes) in PBS+++ (PBS, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin) for the indicated times at 37 °C. Coverslips were moved to 4 °C, washed twice with ice-cold PBS++++ and three times with ice-cold citrate buffer, and re-equilibrated with two additional ice-cold PBS++++ washes (12Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The coverslips were fixed in a 4% formaldehyde/PBS++ (PBS, 1 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2) solution at room temperature for 5 min and on ice for an additional 15 min. Excess formaldehyde was removed with 3 × 5-min washes in PBS++. Cells were permeabilized in 0.1% saponin/5% goat serum/PBS++ for 15 min. After 3 × 5-min PBS++ washes, the coverslips were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h. Antibodies used (source in parentheses) were mouse monoclonal anti-HA tag 12CA5 (Ian Wilson, The Scripps Research Institute) and mouse monoclonal anti-Rab5 (Transduction Laboratories). Unbound primary antibody was removed with 3 × 5-min PBS++ washes, and the coverslips were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (noted in figure legends). Coverslips were subjected to 6 × 5-min PBS++ washes, rinsed in Millipore water, and mounted on a coverslip slide using Fluoromount G (EM Sciences). 35-mm dishes of cells were washed twice in room temperature PBS and put on ice with PBS to cool to 4 °C for 5 min. Cells were then harvested in 500 μl of ice-cold solubilization buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 50 mm Tris, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, and 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were solubilized by gently rocking for 10 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet the insoluble material. Protein concentration was determined by BCA, and 100 μg of solubilized protein was run on 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis mini-gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted using monoclonal antibodies against Rab5 or 12CA5 as above. Proteins were detected using secondary goat anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence. HA-Rab5(WT) or HA-Rab5(Q79L) was put under the control of a tetracycline-regulatable promoter in the pAdlox vector 3′ to the Ψ5 packaging site and 5′ to the poly(A) site. Adenoviruses were generated as previously described (13Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to use in experiments, adenoviruses were plaque-purified to a single viral population and then amplified. In experiments in which cells expressed Rab5 continuously for 18 h, tTA-HeLa cells at ∼70% confluency were infected with adenovirus at an m.o.i. of 10 plaque-forming units/cell. Cells were infected with adenovirus in DMEM with or without 1 μg/ml tetracycline for 2 h at 37 °C. After infection, the viral medium was removed and replaced with growth medium with or without tetracycline. When Rab5 expression was studied using a bolus concentration, tTA-HeLa cells at ∼70% confluency were infected with adenovirus at an m.o.i. of 300 plaque-forming units/cell. Infection took place at 37 °C for 2 h in DMEM, and the adenovirus-containing medium was removed and replaced with growth medium containing 10 μg/ml cycloheximide for 3 h to prevent protein but not mRNA synthesis. Cycloheximide was washed out with three washes of DMEM, and the cells were returned to 37 °C incubation with growth medium for the indicated times, typically 1, 3, or 12 h. At all time points, the cells remained adherent to the dish without any obvious signs of toxicity or cell death. Infected cells were assayed for transferrin uptake and recycling as previously described (14van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowiz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. To measure a single round of transferrin receptor endocytosis, harvested cells were preincubated for 1 h with 4 μg/ml B-XX-Tfn. Prior to internalization, unbound ligand was removed by three washes in ice-cold PBS++++ (PBS, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). Cells were resuspended to a concentration of 3–4 × 106cells/ml and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. B-XX-Tfn trafficking was stopped by transferring a 50-μl aliquot of the cell suspension to an Eppendorf tube containing 750 μl of ice-cold PBS++++. Internalized B-XX-Tfn was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based assay as previously described (14van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowiz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Fluid phase uptake was performed on infected 35-mm dishes of cells as previously described (15Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 16Marsh M. Schmid S. Kern H. Harms E. Male P. Mellman I. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 875-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Lipid recycling was performed as described by Hao and Maxfield (17Hao M. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15279-15286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Quantitation of C6-NBD-SM in medium or in cell lysates was performed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences fluorimeter at an excitation wavelength of 465 nm and measuring the peak height between 518 and 558 nm. Data are plotted as the C6-NBD-SM that remains cell-associated at each time point. To begin to probe the mechanism of Rab5(Q79L) effects on TfnR endocytosis and recycling, we generated stably transformed cell lines expressing HA-tagged wild type Rab5 (HA-Rab5(WT)) and constitutively active HA-Rab5(Q79L) under the control of a tetracycline-responsive expression system. Using this system, stable cell lines can be generated while avoiding any deleterious effects that may result from continuously altering cellular membrane trafficking (11Damke H. Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bujard H. Schmid S.L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 157: 209-220Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Stable cell lines generated in this manner express either HA-Rab5(WT) or HA-Rab5(Q79L) in a tetracycline-regulated manner as determined by Western blotting using either the 12CA5 anti-HA antibody (not shown) or antibodies against Rab5, which reveal both the more slowly migrating recombinant HA-tagged protein and the endogenous Rab5 (Fig. 1 A). In these stably transformed cells, recombinant HA-Rab5 is expressed at roughly equimolar levels compared with endogenous protein. Expression of Rab5(WT) at these levels did not affect endosome morphology (Fig. 1 B, upper left), whereas expression of Rab5(Q79L) at these levels was sufficient to cause the expected morphological phenotype—enlarged endosomes (upper right). Expression of HA-Rab5(Q79L) was suppressed when cells were cultured in the presence of tetracycline (upper middle panel). In all cases, the endosomes were functional in that fluorescently labeled Tfn was internalized and delivered to them (Fig. 1 B, lower panels). Unexpectedly, examination of the single-round uptake and recycling kinetics of Tfn revealed that despite formation of enlarged endosomes there was no perturbation of Tfn uptake in cells induced to express either WT or mutant Rab5 compared with uninduced control cells (Fig. 1 C). Similarly, there was no change in the steady state accumulation of Tfn receptors in this endosomal compartment. These data suggested that the enlarged endosome phenotype is not predictive of defects in endocytic membrane trafficking. Given that a threshold level of Rab5(Q79L) expression may be required to cause changes in membrane trafficking (8Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar), it remained possible that the lack of changes in TfnR trafficking was due to low levels of exogenous protein expression. Consequently, we elected to employ an adenoviral expression system to obtain reproducibly and uniformly higher levels of overexpression. In addition, adenovirus allows for the rapid induction of high levels of protein, thus circumventing problems that may occur as a result of chronic exposure of a foreign protein to the cell. The adenoviral expression system was designed to retain the tetracycline regulation so that any potential adenovirus effects could be controlled by infection of cells in the presence of tetracycline. When cultured under inducing conditions for 18 h in the absence of tetracycline, tTA-HeLa cells infected with recombinant adenoviruses encoding either WT or mutant Rab5 expressed 50–100-fold higher levels of the desired protein compared with endogenous Rab5 (Fig.2 A). Importantly, WT and mutant Rab5 expression was not detectable when infected cells were cultured in the presence of tetracycline. As expected at these high levels of overexpression, the characteristically enlarged endosomal morphology was readily apparent in cells expressing HA-Rab5(Q79L) (Fig.2 B). These enlarged endosomes remained accessible to internalized Tfn as indicated by the colocalization of fluorescently labeled transferrin (Alexa-Tfn) and Rab5 containing vesicles stained with an antibody that recognizes the HA epitope (Fig. 2 B). Despite the fact that transferrin receptors were trafficking through these dramatically enlarged endosomes when the kinetics of transferrin receptor trafficking was measured, there were no changes in the uptake of the transferrin receptor (Fig. 2 C) compared with control uninfected cells or cells infected with HA-Rab5(WT). Like the stably transfected Rab5 tTA-HeLa cell lines, adenovirus expression of wild type and mutant Rab5 did not alter the steady state accumulation of Tfn within the cell. Our findings are inconsistent with previous results showing effects of both Rab5(WT) and Rab5(Q79L) overexpression on endocytosis and recycling of TfnR (5Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 8Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). One trivial explanation for these differences is that previous studies were performed on adherent cells following internalization of125I-Tfn, whereas our assay follows B-XX-Tfn uptake in nonadherent cells. However, similar results were obtained when we assayed endocytosis and recycling of 125I-Tfn in adherent adenovirally infected HeLa cells using the methodology of others (Refs.5Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 8Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, and data not shown). A second methodological difference was that previous studies employed a protocol that ensured a rapid bolus of Rab5 overexpression (5Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 8Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). In contrast, the persistent overexpression of Rab5(Q79L) in our system may enable induction of a compensatory mechanism(s) that restores transferrin receptor trafficking to normal steady state rates. Therefore, we adapted our expression system for rapid induction of a bolus of protein expression. For these experiments, cells were infected with a 30-fold higher m.o.i. of adenovirus (see “Materials and Methods” for details), and Rab5 expression was controlled using cycloheximide. Briefly, tTA-HeLa cells were infected with adenovirus (m.o.i. of 300) for 2 h. Cells were then treated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide for 3 h to accumulate mRNA in the absence of protein expression. The cycloheximide was washed from the cells, and protein was expressed for the indicated periods of time before experiments were performed. As shown in Fig.3 A, this protocol allows for tight control of protein synthesis while permitting a regulatable, high level of Rab5 expression. Within 1 h of HA-Rab5(Q79L) expression, exogenous HA-Rab5(Q79L) levels were estimated to be 50-fold over endogenous Rab5 (Fig. 3 A). The level of HA-Rab5(Q79L) expression continued to increase with increased time of incubation in the absence of cycloheximide, plateauing at 6–12 h postinfection. A similar expression pattern was seen when cells were infected with HA-Rab5(WT) adenovirus (data not shown). After only an hour of protein synthesis, the enlarged endosomal phenotype could be detected (Fig.3 B). Increased duration of HA-Rab5(Q79L) synthesis caused a successive increase in the size of early endosomes, whereas increased HA-Rab5(WT) expression caused only minor increases in endosome size. At each time point, we performed a kinetic analysis of transferrin uptake and recycling (Fig. 4). Consistent with our findings thus far, despite the dramatic changes in endosomal morphology seen at even the earliest time points of HA-Rab5(Q79L) expression (1 h), we were unable to detect changes in endocytosis or steady state accumulation of TfnR within the cell. Although endosome size continued to enlarge at 3 and 12 h of HA-Rab5(Q79L) expression, there was similarly no effect on the rates or efficiency of TfnR uptake and intracellular accumulation compared with uninfected cells or cells infected in the presence of 1 μg/ml tetracycline, which served as controls. In all cases, Tfn uptake was maximal at 5 min, and recycling occurred with a half-time of ∼7–8 min, consistent with results of others (18Dautry-Varsat A. Ciechanover A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2258-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, 19Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J.

It has been proposed (1Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar, 2Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar) that sorting in the early endosome occurs, at least in part, by a default mechanism based on the geometry of the tubulovesicular early endosome. In this model, the high surface area of the tubular portions of the endosome facilitates recycling of membrane-associated components, perhaps through an iterative process (19Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 21Dunn K.W. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3303-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Others have argued that more directed sorting mechanisms are required for the highly efficient endocytic trafficking of recycling receptors such as the TfnR (22Stoorvogel W. Oorschot V. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The appearance of coated buds containing TfnR on early endosomes (22Stoorvogel W. Oorschot V. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and the sorting motif-dependent inhibition of TfnR recycling by bafilomycin (23Presley J.F. Mayor S. McGraw T.E. Dunn K.W. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13929-13936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) support this latter hypothesis. Thus, our inability to detect an effect on the kinetics and efficiency of TfnR uptake and recycling in cells despite dramatic alterations in early endosome size and geometry may reflect the involvement of Rab5-independent, directed sorting events. Consistent with this possibility, one notable difference in our experiments compared with others is that in previous studies human TfnR vectors were introduced in parallel with the Rab5(WT) and Rab5(Q79L) constructs (8Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar), whereas we are studying transport kinetics of endogenous receptors. Thus, it is possible that at higher levels of expression TfnR endocytic trafficking becomes more sensitive to alterations in endosomal morphology and/or Rab5 function than that of endogenous Tfn receptors. Importantly, we obtained similar results when examining endogenous TfnR endocytosis and recycling kinetics using adenovirally infected HepG2 cells expressing Rab5(Q79L) (data not shown). To determine whether the dramatic changes in early endosome morphology affect the bulk sorting properties of early endosomes as predicted by current models, we examined the kinetics of endocytosis of a bulk fluid phase marker and the kinetics of recycling of a bulk membrane lipid marker. To focus on the rates of volume endocytosis rather than the extent of volume accumulation, we analyzed the initial rate of fluid phase HRP uptake. As can be seen (Fig. 5,A–C), we were unable to detect differences in the rate of HRP endocytosis at either 1, 3, or 12 h after bolus induction of expression of WT or mutant Rab5 compared with either uninduced or uninfected controls. Previous studies on HRP uptake in Rab5-expressing cells (7Li G. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24475-24480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) focused on later time points of uptake when changes in endosomal volume will be reflected by increased accumulation of HRP at steady state. Our results suggest that GTP hydrolysis by Rab5 is not rate-limiting for bulk or receptor-mediated endocytosis in HeLa cells. We next measured the rates of bulk membrane recycling in cells overexpressing Rab5(Q79L), expecting that membrane lipids would accumulate in the enlarged vacuolar portions of the early endosome slowing their recycling. For these experiments we used C6-NBD-SM, a readily extractable, fluorescently labeled membrane lipid (17Hao M. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15279-15286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were labeled with C6-NBD-SM for 10 min at 37 °C to allow the C6-NBD-SM to traffic to the early endosomes. After extracting the plasma membrane C6-NBD-SM through a series of backwashes in a fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin solution, dissociable C6-NBD-SM was measured by the fluorescence in the medium. Unexpectedly, there was no appreciable difference in the rate or extent of C6-NBD-SM recycling from the endosome to the plasma membrane at any time point after induction of Rab5 WT or mutant overexpression (Fig. 5,D–F). Thus, in these cells efficiency of recycling of either bulk membrane or TfnR was not affected by dramatic changes in endosome geometry. We find that the early endosomal compartment significantly expands in cells overexpressing the constitutively active Rab5 mutant, Rab5(Q79L). This finding is consistent with previous work of others (8Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 24Roberts R.L. Barbieri M.A. Pryse K.M. Chua M. Morisaki J.H. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and with the model that Rab5 plays a critical role in early endosome biogenesis and morphogenesis by controlling the rate of endosome fusion events while in the Rab5/GTP-bound form (4Barbieri M.A. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18720-18722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, and in contrast to previous reports (7Li G. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24475-24480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar), in the presence of Rab5(Q79L) overexpression we observed no detectable acceleration in the kinetics of Tfn receptor or fluid phase uptake. Further, there were no changes in steady state, intracellular accumulation of the Tfn receptor or lipid recycling despite the appearance of these morphologically altered early endosomes. Our results were obtained at a variety of levels of Rab5(Q79L) overexpression, which caused varying degrees of change in endosome morphology and after even brief exposure to mutant Rab5 provided little opportunity for the induction of compensatory mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1984428272,"Previously, the role of residues in the ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been studied by mutagenesis, but the dependence of mitochondrial biogenesis on functional AAC impedes segregation of the mutational effects on transport and biogenesis. Unlike other mitochondrial carriers, expression of the AAC from yeast or mammalians in Escherichia coli encountered difficulties because of disparate codon usage. Here we introduce the AAC from Neurospora crassa inE. coli, where it is accumulated in inclusion bodies and establish the reconstitution conditions. AAC expressed with heat shock vector gave higher activity than with pET-3a. Transport activity was absolutely dependent on cardiolipin. The 10 single mutations of intrahelical positive residues and of the matrix repeat (+X+) motif resulted in lower activity, except of R245A. R143A had decreased sensitivity toward carboxyatractylate. The ATP-linked exchange is generally more affected than ADP exchange. This reflects a charge network that propagates positive charge defects to ATP4− more strongly than to ADP3− transport. Comparison to the homologous mutants of yeast AAC2 permits attribution of the roles of these residues more to ADP/ATP transport or to AAC import into mitochondria.

Its slow intrinsic turnover is a result of unusually large and highly charged substrates; it is the most strongly expressed member of the mitochondrial carrier family (1Klingenberg M. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1976: 383-438Crossref Google Scholar). The AAC has been instrumental in understanding certain principles of transport mechanism, such as the “single binding gated pore mechanism” (2Weidemann M.J. Erdelt H. Klingenberg M. Eur. J.

Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1985: 511-553Crossref Google Scholar). Based on its sequence and topological studies, it is generally assumed that the AAC has six transmembrane helices, with three repeat domains containing two helices each. However, very little is known about the three-dimensional structure of the AAC, as is the situation with all mitochondrial solute transporters.

Most mutations involved neutralizing charged residues and the effects on various functions were determined (9Müller V. Basset G. Nelson D.R. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16132-16143Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 10Müller V. Heidkämper D. Nelson D.R. Klingenberg M.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16144-16152Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A beneficial spin-off from the yeast system was the occurrence of spontaneous revertants by second-site mutations (12Nelson D.R. Douglas M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 13Nelson D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 14Nelson D.R. Felix C.M. Swanson J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 285-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). A disadvantage of the yeast expression system is the dependence on mitochondrial growth and biogenesis on the transport performance of AAC. The level of AAC expression varied widely among the mutants and could be drastically suppressed. Therefore, in several mutants that lacked AAC protein, the functional effect could not be accurately determined. Further, it could not be clearly deduced whether the mutated residue was involved primarily in the incorporation or in the transport function of AAC. In fact, it seemed that functional impairment also decreased the level of AAC expression. To avoid the dilemma of how to interpret the mutational effect, we aimed to express AAC heterologously in an organism that does not depend on AAC such as Escherichia coli. The deposition of the synthesized AAC into inclusion bodies (IB) instead of the E. coli membrane may prevent a possible devitalizing influence onE. coli (15Fiermonte G. Walker J.E. Palmieri F. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Previously, the expression of the bovine AAC1 in E. coli (16Powell S.J. Medd S.M. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was reported; however, the very low levels detected in immunoblots are questionable. In our hands, it was not possible to express marked amounts of yeast AAC2 in E. coli, despite the abundant expression reported for other mitochondrial carriers from yeast (15Fiermonte G. Walker J.E. Palmieri F. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 17Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Palmieri F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11033-11040Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This discrepancy might be due to unfavorable codon usage for yeast AAC2 in E. coli. However, the AAC from Neurospora crassa could be expressed in high amounts in E. coli. Here we determined the conditions in which AAC from N. crassa could be renatured and reconstituted from IB into phospholipid vesicles by introducing some additional measures that were not required for the reconstitution of other mitochondrial carriers from inclusion bodies. Single mutational neutralizations of 10 positive charges are introduced in the AAC fromN. crassa, and the effects on the transport properties and the interaction with inhibitors were measured. The detergents pentaethylene glycol monodecylether (C10E5), octaethylene glycol monododecylether (C12E8), tetraethylene glycol monooctylether (C8E4), phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE), and Dowex 1X8 (200–400-mesh) were obtained from Fluka, Triton X-114 and Triton X-100 from Sigma, the zwitterionic detergents Empigen BB and Sulfabetaine B12 from Marchon Ltd. (France), and Amberlite XAD-2 from Aldrich. Octyl polyoxyethylene, a mixture of C8E2 to C8E12, was kindly donated by J. Rosenbusch. [14C]ADP and [14C]ATP were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Restriction endonucleases and T4-DNA ligase were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals or New England Biolabs and used as recommended by the supplier. The heat shock vector pJLA503 carrying the AAC gene from N. crassa (18Arends H. Sebald W. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was obtained from W. Neupert (Institute of Physiological Chemistry, The University of Munich, Germany). The shuttle vector pSEYc58 (19Emr S.D Vassarotti A. Garrett J. Geller B.L. Takeda M. Douglas M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) containing the geneAAC2 from S. cerevisiae (20Lawson J.E. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12818-14812Google Scholar) was obtained from D. Nelson (Dept. of Biochemistry, University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN). The human gene AAC1 was supplied by N. Neckelmann (21Neckelmann N. Li K. Wade R.P. Shuster R. Wallace D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7580-7584Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The three wild type (wt) AAC genes were cloned for mutagenesis into the shuttle vector pT7Blue and for protein expression into the vector pET-3a (Novagen). DNA isolation, restriction, cloning, and transformation into the E. coli cell strains DH1 and BL21(DE3)plysS were performed as described in Ref. 22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Nolan C. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar. All mutants of the AAC gene from N. crassa were generated by using an oligonucleotide-directed system (U.S.E. mutagenesis kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The AAG codon for the mutant K28A was changed to GCA, and for the mutant K38A it was changed to GCC. For the arginine mutants R86A, R143A, R145A, R195A, R243A, R244A, R245A, and R285A, the codons CGT and CGC were changed to GCA. The mutated AAC gene fromN. crassa contains the restriction sites forNdeI, BamHI, and EcoRI, which allowed the recloning of the 1207-base pair DNA fragment from the pT7Blue shuttle vector into the heat shock pJLA503 vector (23Schauder B. Blöcker H. Frank R. McCarthy E.G. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 52: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). All the cloned and mutated AAC genes were sequenced by dideoxy chain termination using a Thermo Sequenase kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Expression of the different AAC proteins (wt and mutants) was carried out in the E. coli strain DH1 with the heat shock vector pJLA503 or in the strain BL21(DE3)plysS with the pET-3a vector. A total of 500 ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium plus 50 mg of ampicillin was inoculated with an overnight cell culture of transformed DH1 cells, starting with anA578 nm of 0.1. Under vigorous shaking at 30 °C (about 3.5 h), cells were grown to anA578 nm of 1.2–1.4. For the expression vector pJLA503, AAC expression was induced with the addition of 500 ml of 54 °C LB medium to the cell suspension. Growth was continued for 1 h at 43 °C. For induction by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, 600 ml of LB medium plus ampicillin were inoculated with an overnight cell culture of transformed BL21(DE3)plysS cells containing the vector pET-3a-AAC. Under vigorous shaking at 37 °C, cells were grown for 2 h toA578 nm of 0.6. Expression was induced by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and growth was continued for 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested and stored at 20 °C. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 10 ml of solution 1 (50 mm Tris base, 25% sucrose, pH 7.0) and incubated with lysozyme (20 mg/g of cells) for 1 h at 37 °C. All the following steps were performed on ice. 10 ml of solution 1 was added, with further additions of 18.5 mm EDTA, 1.5% Triton X-100, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Cells were disrupted by sonification and centrifuged at 30,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The pellet containing IB was resuspended in 20 ml of solution 2 (1 m urea, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol), sonified, and centrifuged. Further enrichment of IB was achieved by additional washing steps including centrifugation and resuspension period, using 20 ml of solution 2 in the first, 20 ml of solution 3 (20 mm Tris base, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0) in the second, and 10–20 ml of solution 4 (50 mm Tris base, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol) in the final wash. The resulting purified IB pellet (40–50 mg of IB/1 liter of E. coli suspension) was stored in liquid nitrogen. Phospholipid from turkey egg yolk (PC) was isolated from fresh turkey eggs as described (24Wells M.A. Hanahan D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 14: 178-183Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and was used as standard PC for developing the standard reconstitution procedure. The extraction step with diethylether was omitted. To remove phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), the standard PC was dissolved in a mixture of chloroform/methanol (2:3) and treated with Al2O3. To remove residual cholesterol, the standard PC was dissolved in methanol and centrifuged at 26,000 ×g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was evaporated by a vigorous stream of nitrogen, resulting in the final PC product. AAC from inclusion bodies (IB-AAC) was solubilized at 0 °C in 100 μl of 1.67% (w/v) N-lauroylsarcosine (sarkosyl), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithioerythrol, 10 mm Tris base, pH 7.0 (15Fiermonte G. Walker J.E. Palmieri F. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and 0.05% polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG) was added to prevent protein aggregation (25Cleland J.L. Builder S.E. Swartz J.R. Winkler M. Chang J.Y. Wang D.I.C. Bio/Technology. 1992; 10: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). After 15 min the solution was diluted 3-fold with 10 mm Tris base to give a final detergent concentration of 0.56% and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 4 min at 4 °C. For reconstitution the phospholipid was solubilized by sonicating 200 mg of the PC in 800 μl of 0.1 m PIPES, pH 7.5, until the suspension became clear. Typically, 100 μl of this PC suspension was added dropwise to a detergent (D) solution (200 mg/ml C10E5) to a final volume of 240 μl and stored on ice. C10E5 was found to be very useful for the reconstitution of the uncoupling protein (26Klingenberg M. Winkler E. Huang S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 369-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The PC-detergent solution contained 20 mg of PC and 28 mg of C10E5 (D/PC = 1.4). 80 μl of this suspension were mixed with 1.6 mg of cardiolipin (CL). To a final volume of 1 ml, a solution of 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm potassium gluconate, and 20 mmADP or ATP were added. Then, 100 μg of the solubilized IB-AAC protein were added, followed by 100 mg of Amberlite XAD-2 (Aldrich). 80 μl of the PC-detergent mixture and 100 mg of Amberlite were added twice in 30-min intervals. In subsequent intervals of 30 min, 2 × 100 mg and 1 × 200 mg Amberlite were added with gentle shaking overnight. The Amberlite was separated from the proteoliposomes by centrifugation, and the external ADP or ATP were removed by passage over a Sephadex G75 column of 0.6 × 28 cm. The elution buffer contained 50 mm NaCl and 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.4. The transport measurements were based on the counterexchange of external [14C]ADP or [14C]ATP with internal ADP or ATP. A newly developed automated sampling and separation device was used, and the time progress of the exchange was measured by taking samples from 2 to 300 s as described previously (11Heidkämper D. Müller V. Nelson D.R. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16144-16152Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Additionally, the equation for the calculation of the transport rates is given here. For inhibition studies, 50 μl of IB-AAC proteoliposomes or 35 μl of mt-AAC proteoliposomes were incubated with 10 μmcarboxyatractylate (CAT), 10 μm bongkrekic acid (BKA), or a combination of 10 μm CAT and 4 μm BKA. After 10 min, 100 μm [14C]ADP was added for 5 min. An aliquot of 50 μl of this mixture was injected on a Dowex column and rapidly processed as described above. The protein concentration of the proteoliposomes was estimated using the “Amido Black method” described in Refs. 27Kaplan R.S. Pedersen P.L. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar and 28Schaffner W. Weißmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar. Protein was precipitated from 200 μl of proteoliposomes of IB-AAC or 400 μl of mt-AAC with trichloroacetic acid (104 g/100 ml) and filtered. (Millipore HAWP 020 00, 0.45-μm pore size, 24-mm diameter). Filters were stained, dried, and then eluated. The absorbance of the eluate was read at 630 nm in a 1-ml cuvette against water. The blank containing all components except protein was subtracted, and a standard curve was calculated with 2–24 μg of bovine serum albumin. To compare AAC mutations expressed in E. coliwith those previously obtained in mitochondria, we first attempted to express the AAC2 from S. cerevisiae in E. coli. The cDNAs for yeast AAC2 and human AAC1 were incorporated into the heat shock vector pJLA503 and into the T7 RNA polymerase pET-3a vector. In both cases, virtually no expression of AAC protein was observed, as deduced from the lack of IB formation and documented by immunoblots of extracts from whole cells. We noted that the codons for several residues are very unfavorable for E. coli expression. In particular, the arginine codons AGG and AGA, which have a very low expression incidence in E. coli (29Las Varenne J.B. Lloubes R. Lazdunski C. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 549-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) are present in the AAC2 sequences. We also tried to express human AAC1 in E. coli. Again, no measurable synthesis of human AAC1 was obtained, probably due to a disparate codon usage. In particular, the arginine triplet Arg-252/Arg-253/Arg-254 may make translation inE. coli very difficult. Therefore, the DNA sequence of AAC2 (S. cerevisiae) for this triplet was changed from AGAAGAAGA to CGTCGTAGA, which has a high translation probability. However, there was no detectable expression of the modified AAC2 in E. coli. We then turned to the AAC from N. crassa, which has been shown to be abundantly expressed in E. coli (30Mahlke K. Ph.D. thesis. University of Munich, Munich, Germany1991Google Scholar). The codons for arginine in AAC (N. crassa) are mostly CGT or CGC, which provide a high translation probability. Two systems were used to express AAC (N. crassa) in E. coli: the T7 RNA polymerase promoter system with the expression vector pET-3a and the heat shock promoter system with the expression vector pJLA503. The IB-AAC expressed in the two different systems had different abilities to reconstitute transport activity. With the pET-3a expression system, the transport activity reached only about 40% of the activity obtained with the heat shock promoted vector (data not shown). This difference was observed throughout the variations of the reconstitution parameters. For this reason, all of the following solubilization and renaturation experiments were performed with heat shock-induced IB-AAC using the pJLA503 vector expression system. The previously reported procedure for the solubilization and renaturation of the phosphate and citrate carrier from inclusion bodies did not produce active vesicles with the IB-AAC. In the pursuit of an active AAC, several modifications had to be introduced, which are briefly highlighted here. Among the various solubilizers of IB-AAC tried, sarkosyl also proved to provide the basis for the reconstitution. However, some subsequent steps had to be modified, as monitored by the exchange rate (Table I). These included addition of PEG during the solubilization of IB and during the reconstitution. Further, the nonionic detergent required for the solubilization of the phospholipid and subsequent proteoliposome formation proved to be quite critical. The best reconstitution was obtained with C8E4 and C10E5, whereas the use of Triton X-100 or X-114 resulted in low exchange rates, probably due to leaky proteoliposomes. Several other factors were tested to improve the reconstitution yield (data not shown). For example, the addition of salts such as KCl, ammonium acetate, or Na2SO4 decreased the activity of reconstituted E. coli IB-AAC (see also Fig. 3). This is in contrast to the conditions applied to reconstitute AAC from mitochondria in which salts increased the activity (31Krämer R. Kürzinger G. Biochim. Biophys, Acta. 1984; 765: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Table IDependence of reconstitution on various detergents, phospholipid composition, and detergent adsorbersRelative exchange activity (VT)−PEGPEG%Detergents used for reconstitution1-aThe influence of various detergents on the reconstitution.

Detergent was removed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1-b Different phospholipid compositions were used for the reconstitution. Detergent was removed by stepwise addition of Biobeads (350 mg) at 30-min intervals. For details of further purification steps with Al2O3 and methanol of the PC preparation (24Wells M.A. Hanahan D.J.

Open table in a new tab Different solubilization and reconstitution conditions were used to develop the standard reconstitution procedure. Phospholipid from fresh turkey egg yolk (PC) was isolated as described in Ref. 24Wells M.A. Hanahan D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 14: 178-183Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar and was used as standard PC. The estimated D/D exchange activity of these exchange measurements were related to the exchange activity of the basic D/D exchange VT = 1260 (μmol/min g protein) of the heat shock-induced, reconstituted wt IB-AAC. The choice of appropriate phospholipids was an important factor for reconstitution. (Table I). Phospholipids from egg yolk (PC) have been shown to be superior for reconstitution of yeast AAC, as compared with phospholipids from other sources such as asolectin from soybean or from E. coli (32Krämer R. Klingenberg M. FEBS Lett. 1977; 82: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The additional extraction step of the standard PC with methanol, which removed residual cholesterol improved activity more than 3-fold. In contrast, purification using Al2O3, which removes PE, resulted in less active proteoliposomes. On the other hand, further addition of PE to the standard PC did not enhance activity. The slow addition of the detergent phospholipid mixture to the sarkosyl-solubilized IB-AAC was essential for successful reconstitution. Three equal portions of the detergent phospholipid mixture were added every 30 min. The formation of the proteoliposomes was initiated by the stepwise removal of the detergent by polystyrene beads. As shown in Table I, removal of detergent for the reconstitution with Biobeads was less effective than with Amberlite XAD-2. This procedure is similar to those used for the reconstitution of uncoupling protein from brown adipose tissue (33Winkler E. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and of AAC from yeast and bovine heart mitochondria (34Knirsch M. Gawaz M.P. Klingenberg M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 244: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The dependence of AAC activity on CL has been documented for the AAC from bovine heart and yeast (32Krämer R. Klingenberg M. FEBS Lett. 1977; 82: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 35Brandolin G. Doussiere J. Gulik A. Gulik-Krzywicki T. Lauquin G.J. Vignais P.V. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1940-1944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Typically, AAC isolated from mitochondria carries some CL; however, this may not be sufficient for full activity. CL is not expected to be present in IB-AAC and this was experimentally confirmed (data not shown). Therefore, it was not surprising to find an absolute dependence on CL addition. As shown in Fig. 1, this dependence is nonlinear. Marked translocation activity is obtained only when the phospholipids contain more than 4% CL and maximum is reached at 12%. The nonlinear dependence on the CL content in the present system differs from the linear dependence observed with reconstituted AAC2 isolated from yeast mitochondria (36Hoffmann B. Stöckl A. Schlame M. Beyer K. Klingenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1940-1944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One problem when comparing reported transport activity is the widely different protein/phospholipid ratio used (see “Discussion”). We therefore examined the relationship of transport activity to the protein/phospholipid ratio to find optimum conditions for accurately measuring the transport rates in the reconstituted proteoliposomes (Fig. 2). While the 14C uptake measured at 20 s decreased with the protein amount, the exchange rate VT related to the protein content increased surprisingly 5-fold when changing the phospholipid/protein ratio from 10−2 to 10−3. In a compromise for accurate measurements, which are required for mutants with decreased activity, a PC/protein ratio of 200 was employed. Transport by AAC is electrical in the case of an exchange between ADP3− and ATP4− (37Krämer R. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To compensate for these charge differences, K+ and valinomycin were added to the proteoliposomes. K+ ions were usually added in the form of KCl for reconstitution of mitochondrial AAC. To assess the effect of K+ ions on the transport activity, the two electroneutral (homo) exchange modes D/D and T/T and the electrical (hetero) exchanges D/T and T/D were measured. To better characterize the influence on the exchange modes of IB-AAC, AAC from N. crassa mitochondria (mt-AAC) was also isolated and reconstituted. With mt-AAC (N. crassa), high activity was observed for the two hetero exchange modes in the presence of KCl, whereas potassium gluconate at high concentrations reduc"

Acta. 2000; 1486: 108-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Maintenance of this asymmetry appears to be critical to cell survival in higher eukaryotes, since the exposure of PtdSer on the cell surface is a signal for macrophage clearance (21Fadok V.A.

Furthermore, PtdSer exposure on the surface of platelets is essential to initiate the coagulation cascade (24Rosing J. Bevers E.M. Comfurius P. Hemker H.C. van Dieijen G. Weiss H.J. Zwaal R.F. Blood. 1985; 65: 1557-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and regulation of phospholipid asymmetry across the plasma membrane may modulate a variety of other processes including membrane budding (25Farge E. Ojcius D.M. Subtil A. Dautry-Varsat A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C725-C733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and activation of PtdSer-dependent enzymes (26Devaux P.F. Zachowski A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 73: 107-120Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Although the activity of aminophospholipid transport has been well characterized, the identity of the aminophospholipid translocase has remained elusive. A 115-kDa P-type ATPase, purified and cloned from bovine chromaffin granules, has been proposed to have aminophospholipid translocase activity based on inference from the absence of selective PtdSer uptake in yeast cells in which its yeast orthologue,DRS2, was deleted (27Tang X. Halleck M.S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Science. 1996; 272: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). However, failure to confirm the dependence of PtdSer uptake on the expression of DRS2 in two independently constructed null strains (28Siegmund A. Grant A. Angeletti C. Malone L. Nichols J.W. Rudolph H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34399-34405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 29Marx U. Polakowski T. Pomorski T. Lang C. Nelson H. Nelson N. Herrmann A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) calls into question the inference that the chromaffin granule P-type ATPase has aminophospholipid translocase activity. Other membrane proteins have been identified as aminophospholipid translocases (30Schroit A.J. Madsen J. Ruoho A.E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1812-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 31Morrot G. Zachowski A. Devaux P.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 266: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 32Auland M.E.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12257-12263Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); however, a definitive demonstration of selective phospholipid translocase activity is lacking in each case (20Daleke D.L. Lyles J.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 108-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). As such, there is no consensus as to the identity of this transporter. Identification of the Ca2+-activated, nonselective phospholipid transporter (scramblase) has been more successful. The protein responsible for the loss of asymmetry in erythrocytes has been purified (34Basse F. Stout J.G. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17205-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and the cDNA has been cloned and sequenced (35Zhou Q. Zhao J. Stout J.G. Luhm R.A. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18240-18244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Although the expression of scramblase in human cancer cell lines is directly correlated with Ca2+-activated exposure of PtdSer in the exoplasmic leaflet (18Zhao J. Zhou Q. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6603-6606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), scramblase expression in these same cell lines does not correlate with PtdSer exposure activated by apoptosis (36Fadeel B. Gleiss B. Hogstrand K. Chandra J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Henter J.I. Orrenius S. Samali A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This discrepancy suggests a second unidentified pathway for PtdSer translocation across the plasma membrane that is responsive to the apoptotic cascade. This pioneering work illustrates the need for further research on the molecular details of the regulation and maintenance of phospholipid distribution in eukaryotic cells. The use of phospholipids with the fluorescent label NBD covalently attached to a short acyl chain provides a means by which phospholipid transbilayer translocation can be addressed (37Pagano R.E. Sleight R.G. Science. 1985; 229: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we and others have applied these NBD-labeled phospholipids to study the mechanisms and regulation of phospholipid transbilayer transport across the plasma membrane in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae(29Marx U. Polakowski T. Pomorski T. Lang C. Nelson H. Nelson N. Herrmann A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 38Kean L.S. Fuller R.S. Nichols J.W. J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) are internalized predominantly by inwardly directed transbilayer transport (flip) across the plasma membrane. However, at ambient growth temperatures, the net accumulation of both NBD-phospholipids reflects the sum of inwardly and outwardly directed transbilayer translocation, flip and flop, respectively (39Kean L.S. Grant A.M. Angeletti C. Mahe Y. Kuchler K. Fuller R.S. Nichols J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 40Grant A.M. Hanson P.K. Malone L. Nichols J.W. Traffic. 2001; 2: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The transcription factors Pdr1p and Pdr3p regulate the net accumulation of NBD-labeled PtdCho and PtdEtn (39Kean L.S. Grant A.M. Angeletti C. Mahe Y. Kuchler K. Fuller R.S. Nichols J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Pdr1p and Pdr3p are among the primary regulators of pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) in yeast, and gain-of-function mutations in these genes confer the ability to grow in the presence of structurally unrelated compounds that are normally cytotoxic. This drug-resistant phenotype is thought to be mediated primarily by transcriptional up-regulation of a variety of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters as well as members of the major facilitator superfamily, many of which have been convincingly shown to efflux drugs (Refs. 41Mahe Y.

Therefore, it was previously assumed that the NBD-lipid accumulation defect seen in somePDR1 and PDR3 gain-of- function mutants was due solely to up-regulated NBD-phospholipid flop. The fact that deletion of the ABC transporters PDR5 and YOR1, individually or in combination, partially rescues the NBD-PtdEtn accumulation defect of a PDR1 gain-of-function mutant (45Decottignies A. Grant A.M. Nichols J.W. de Wet H. McIntosh D.B. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12612-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) confirms the role of efflux in modulating lipid and drug accumulation within the cell. To date, few, if any, studies have examined the role of drug resistance networks in regulating the unidirectional uptake of drugs or lipid analogs. By monitoring the flip of NBD-phospholipids at low temperature when flop is inhibited, we have made the novel observation that in addition to their established role in up-regulating flop,PDR1 and PDR3 also dramatically down-regulate NBD-phospholipid flip. Furthermore, we show here that flip is down-regulated when cells experience nutrient starvation, suggesting that down-regulation of the expression and/or activity of the transporter responsible for NBD-phospholipid flip is a physiological response to environmental stress.

After labeling, the cells were washed three times with two volumes of ice-cold SDC. Cells were resuspended and subsequently incubated in either SDC or SC-azide at 2 or 30 °C. At the given time points, cells were rapidly cooled in an ice bath, washed three times with two volumes of ice-cold SC-azide, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Flow cytometric analysis of the NBD-lipid-labeled cells was performed with a FACScalibur or FACScan cytometer (Becton-Dickinson Immunocytochemistry, San Jose, CA) as described previously (45Decottignies A. Grant A.M. Nichols J.W. de Wet H. McIntosh D.B. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12612-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of a 50 μg/ml stock solution of propidium iodide were added to ∼4 × 105cells in 1 ml of SC-azide immediately prior to dilution (∼3 times) and flow cytometric analysis on a cytometer equipped with an argon laser operating at 488 nm. Analysis was performed with CellQuest (Becton-Dickinson Immunocytochemistry Systems) software, using the propidium iodide staining to exclude dead cells when quantifying NBD fluorescence. Fluorescence microscopy was performed on a Carl Zeiss microscope, Axiovert 135 model (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). Fluorescence images were enhanced with an image-intensifying camera (model VE1000-SIT; DAGE-MTI, Inc., Michigan City, IN), digitized, and stored. Contrast enhancement was performed with Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester PA). Our laboratory has previously observed that when yeast cells are labeled with NBD-PE, washed, and incubated at 30 °C, the intracellular fluorescence gradually decreases with time (39Kean L.S. Grant A.M. Angeletti C. Mahe Y. Kuchler K. Fuller R.S. Nichols J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Based on data obtained by fluorescence microscopy, fluorometry, and chemical analysis, we concluded that this decrease results from the transport of intact NBD-PE to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, where it is degraded by periplasmic phospholipases to water-soluble products with low quantum yields (39Kean L.S. Grant A.M. Angeletti C. Mahe Y. Kuchler K. Fuller R.S. Nichols J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Since the rate of NBD-PE exposure to the exoplasmic surface is not inhibited in a strain defective in a late stage of vesicle secretion (sec6–4), we concluded that NBD-PE is not secreted, but rather flopped to the surface (39Kean L.S. Grant A.M. Angeletti C. Mahe Y. Kuchler K. Fuller R.S. Nichols J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition, we observed that the rate of appearance of NBD-PE at the exoplasmic surface was essentially the same whether it was measured by degradation or transfer to excess liposomes in the solution. Thus, we concluded that the rate of fluorescence decrease was limited by the rate of flop, not degradation (39Kean L.S. Grant A.M. Angeletti C. Mahe Y. Kuchler K. Fuller R.S. Nichols J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and therefore provided an accurate measurement of the rate of flop. In Fig. 1, we demonstrate that flow cytometry can be used to measure the time-dependent loss of fluorescence in a wild-type yeast strain. Flow cytometry has the advantage over fluorometry of allowing the exclusion of dead cells, which readily absorb NBD-PE, from the analysis of the mean fluorescence. Briefly, a culture of yeast in early log phase was labeled with Me2SO-solubilized NBD-PE at low temperature and washed with cold medium. Aliquots of labeled cells were then resuspended in the indicated medium at either 30 or 2 °C, and changes in fluorescence as a function of time were measured by flow cytometry. As expected (39Kean L.S. Grant A.M. Angeletti C. Mahe Y. Kuchler K. Fuller R.S. Nichols J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the fluorescence of labeled cells resuspended in standard medium at 30 °C gradually decreased over time. However, cells incubated at low temperature (2 °C) or following energy depletion with sodium azide experienced no significant change in cellular fluorescence during a 90-min incubation. These data show that NBD-PE flop is an energy-requiring process that is essentially blocked at low temperature. Similar results were obtained for NBD-PC (data not shown). At ambient growth temperatures (∼30 °C), yeast cells grown to early log phase readily accumulate both NBD-PC (29Marx U. Polakowski T. Pomorski T. Lang C. Nelson H. Nelson N. Herrmann A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 38Kean L.S. Fuller R.S. Nichols J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1403-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 40Grant A.M.

Traffic. 2001; 2: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) by transbilayer transport across the plasma membrane. At this temperature, since the rate of flop is substantial, it is not possible to determine whether regulation of the extent of net accumulation results from regulation of flip, flop, or a combination of both. However, since the rate of flop is essentially nil at 2 °C (Fig. 1) and since endocytosis and vesicle fusion and budding (40Grant A.M. Hanson P.K. Malone L. Nichols J.W. Traffic. 2001; 2: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 47Riezman H. Cell. 1985; 40: 1001-1009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 48Riezman H. Chvatchko Y. Dulic V.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar) are blocked at this temperature, measurement of NBD-phospholipid accumulation at 2 °C reflects the rate of flip independent of flop. Flow cytometry was used in Fig. 2 to demonstrate that the cell-associated NBD-PC and NBD-PE fluorescence gradually increases with time at 2 °C. Since no fluorescence is detectable in the plasma membrane by fluorescence microscopy following labeling with either NBD-PC or NBD-PE at 2 °C (40Grant A.M. Hanson P.K. Malone L. Nichols J.W. Traffic. 2001; 2: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), nor is it transported to and degraded in the vacuole under these conditions (40Grant A.M. Hanson P.K. Malone L. Nichols J.W. Traffic. 2001; 2: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the cell-associated fluorescence originates solely from internalized, membrane-associated NBD-PC or NBD-PE. Thus, measurement of low temperature accumulation by flow cytometry provides a measure of the average rate of flip, independent of flop, for a large population of live cells and provides a means to investigate its activity and regulation. These data (Fig. 2) illustrate that the flip of NBD-PC is slightly faster than NBD-PE and that neither flip rate begins to saturate during the first 2 h. We have shown previously that the low temperature flip of NBD-PC and NBD-PE is inhibited by energy depletion with sodium azide and fluoride. Here we show that the flip of both NBD-phospholipids is also inhibited by the protonophore CCCP (Fig. 2). Because maintenance of the proton gradient by the proton pump Pma1p requires ATP, it is likely that the inhibition of flip by azide and fluoride is a secondary effect of ATP depletion and that the energy required for flip is provided primarily by the proton electrochemical gradient. Consistent with this model, we have observed that PMA1 mutants with decreased membrane potential show a concomitant reduction in low temperature internalization of NBD-phospholipids (data not shown). Since a large fraction of NBD-PC and NBD-PE fluorescence is localized in the mitochondria following low temperature labeling, it is possible that depolarization of the mitochondrial proton-electrochemical gradient by CCCP inhibits the uptake of NBD-PC and NBD-PE by inhibiting their accumulation in the mitochondria in addition to inhibiting flip across the plasma membrane. To rule out this possibility, we studied petite strains obtained by treatment of the CRY2 strain with ethidium bromide (50Fox T.D. Folley L.S. Mulero J.J. McMullin T.W. Thorsness P.E. Hedin L.O. Costanzo M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 149-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The resulting rho − strains did not grow on YP-glycerol, indicating that the petite phenotype resulted from a respiratory defect. An almost complete reduction in the accumulation of the mitochondrial potential-sensitive dye, 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6) (51Pringle J.R. Preston R.A. Adams A.E. Stearns T. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Jones E.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 31: 357-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), confirmed the disruption of mitochondrial potential in these strains (Fig. 3 A). Despite these mitochondrial defects, NBD-PC and NBD-PE uptake at low temperature (Fig. 3 A) remained essentially unaffected, indicating that fluorescent phospholipid flip is not dependent on the mitochondrial membrane potential. Thus, the inhibition of NBD-phospholipid flip by CCCP results from collapse of the electrochemical potential across the plasma membrane rather than the mitochondria. This result was confirmed by examining the intracellular localization of NBD-PC and NBD-PE in the petite strain by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3 B). As in wild-type strains (40Grant A.M. Hanson P.K. Malone L. Nichols J.W. Traffic. 2001; 2: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), both NBD-phospholipids gave a punctate staining pattern that often colocalized with DAPI staining of the mitochondrial DNA (Fig.3 B). Thus, the mitochondrial membrane potential is not required for NBD-phospholipid flip across the plasma membrane; nor is it required for mitochondrial localization. Furthermore, disruption of the mitochondrial mem"

Recently, a new subclass of type I AFPs have been found in winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus) (10Gong Z. Ewart K.V. Hu Z. Fletcher G.L. Hew C.L. J. Biol.

These type I AFPs are synthesized as mature polypeptides in the cytosol without the signal and prosequences found in the secreted forms of type I AFPs, and are referred to as skin-type AFPs as they were originally isolated and cloned from skin tissue. The secreted forms of type I AFPs were named liver-type AFPs to denote their primary site of production and to distinguish them from the intracellular skin-type AFPs. The nomenclature system presented in Low et al. (11Low W.K. Miao M. Ewart K.V. Yang D.S. Fletcher G.L. Hew C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23098-23103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) attempts to differentiate between skin-type and liver-type AFPs. The winter flounder and shorthorn sculpin skin-type AFPs were named wfsAFP and sssAFP, respectively, where the first two letters (wf and ss) denote the fish species (winter flounder and shorthorn sculpin), and the third position (s) denotes skin-type. Accordingly, the liver-type AFPs are represented by an (l) at the third position as in wflAFP-6, the major winter flounder liver-type AFP previously known as HPLC-6. The skin-type/liver-type nomenclature scheme by itself does not specify the biochemical classification, although all skin-type AFPs found to date are type I AFPs. Furthermore, the skin-type AFPs were previously only found in fish that produce type I serum (liver-type) AFPs. The longhorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus octodecemspinosus) is a closely related species to the shorthorn sculpin (12Cheng C.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It is also found off the coast of Newfoundland, but occupies relatively deeper waters as compared with the shorthorn sculpin and migrates offshore in the colder season. Because of its location in deeper waters, it is less likely to encounter environmental ice. Nonetheless, the longhorn sculpin produces the unique type IV AFP, which has not been found in any other fish species (5Deng G. Andrews D.W. Laursen R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 6Deng G. Laursen R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1388: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 7Zhao Z. Deng G. Lui Q. Laursen R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The type IV AFP is relatively Gln-rich (17%), highly helical, has a proposed four-helix bundle structure (5Deng G. Andrews D.W. Laursen R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and is found in the serum with production in the liver (7Zhao Z. Deng G. Lui Q. Laursen R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The present investigation was undertaken to determine whether the longhorn sculpin produces skin-type AFPs, and if present, to determine their biochemical classification. By using RT-PCR and RACE PCR methods, a full-length clone was isolated from the skin of longhorn sculpin that encodes for a 42-residue, Ala-rich type I AFP. The sequence lacked signal and prosequences implying an intracellular localization. A recombinant protein was produced that exhibited antifreeze activity and four individual Ala-rich polypeptides were isolated from the skin tissue that demonstrated antifreeze activity. One polypeptide, lssAFP-8, was completely sequenced by tandem MS and found to be nearly identical to the clone sequence. This study demonstrates that the longhorn sculpin produces skin-type, type I AFPs and that it shares a similar defense mechanism for cold water adaptation as the shorthorn sculpin and winter flounder. This is to our knowledge, the first fish species identified that produces two different biochemical classes of antifreeze proteins. Longhorn sculpin was collected from Conception Bay, Newfoundland, Canada. Tissues were collected on Mar. 6, 1996, and stored at −70 °C before use. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzolTM reagent (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). Ten-μg aliquots of total RNA were analyzed by standard Northern blotting procedures using HybondTM-N nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Baie d'Urfé, QC). Probe was produced by digesting s3-2 (11Low W.K. Miao M. Ewart K.V. Yang D.S. Fletcher G.L. Hew C.L. J. Biol.

The nylon membrane was prehybridized in 40% formamide, 5% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS, 4 × SSC, 7 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 × Denhart's buffer, and 100 μg/ml denatured calf thymus DNA for 3 h at 47 °C. Probe was added at 0.5 × 106 cpm/ml and hybridization was performed at 48 °C for 24 h. The membrane was washed in solutions ranging from 1 × SSC, 1% SDS to 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 48 °C to 72 °C and autoradiography was performed. One μg of total RNA from each of the specified tissues was combined with 500 ng of the LS-RT-PCR-right primer in an annealing reaction. Then reverse transcription reagents were added at final concentrations of 1 × first strand buffer (Life Technologies), 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm for each dNTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Reverse transcription was performed using 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) at 42 °C. PCR was performed using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). One-tenth of the RT reaction was combined with the LS-RT-PCR-right and -left primers at concentrations of 2.5 ng/μl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, each dNTP at 0.1 mm, 1 × Pfu polymerase buffer (Stratagene), and 2.5 units of Pfu polymerase. Cycling conditions were: initial hold at 94 °C for 5 min, then 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min 45 s, followed by 10 min hold at 72 °C. Reverse transcription and PCR were carried out in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 2400 thermocycler. Isolated RT-PCR products were ligated intoSmaI digested pBluescript II KS+/− (MBI Fermentas Inc., Flamborough, ON). 5′- and 3′-RACE reactions were performed using the SMARTTM RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). One μg of total RNA from skin tissue was used to generate 3′- and 5′-RACE-ready cDNA. Each cDNA pool was combined with the appropriate primers and touchdown PCR amplification was performed using AdvantageTM2 Polymerase Mix (CLONTECH) using a PerkinElmer 2400 thermocycler. Cycling conditions were those as described by the manufacturer (CLONTECH), and where indicated, glycerol was added at 10% (v/v). RACE reaction products were ligated into the pT7(Blue) cloning vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). Genomic DNA was isolated from liver using DNAzolTM (Life Technologies) and 10-μg aliquots were digested with restriction endonucleases in the presence of RNase A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Probe was produced by excising the RT-PCR product from the cloning vector, then labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was prehybridized for 8 h at 50 °C in a buffer of 50% formamide, 600 mm NaCl, 40 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 4 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 1% SDS, 5 × Denhart's buffer, and 100 μg/ml denatured calf thymus DNA. Hybridization was performed in a fresh buffer of 50% formamide, 600 mm NaCl, 40 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 4 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 1% SDS, and 5% dextran sulfate at 42 °C for 48 h with probe at a concentration of 1.0 × 106 cpm/ml. Membrane washing and autoradiography was performed as described for Northern analysis. The ORF was PCR amplified with two primers designed with NcoI andStyI sites using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) with 10% (v/v) glycerol. PCR products were digested with StyI (Life Technologies) and ligated into NcoI- andStyI-digested placIQpar8-wfsAFP-2 (13Lin Q. Ewart K.V. Yan Q. Wong W.K. Yang D.S. Hew C.L. Eur. J.

Protein was precipitated from the media with 100% (NH4+)SO4- and pelleted. The pellet was re-suspended in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate and desalted on a SephadexTM G-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (2.5 cm × 60 cm) column with 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5). Protein fractions were loaded onto a SP-Sephadex C-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (1.5 cm × 10.5 cm) column and eluted with 1 m NaCl in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The bound fraction was collected and final purification was achieved by reverse-phase HPLC using a Jupiter 10-μm C4300 Å (250 mm × 21.20 mm) column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). Skin tissue was homogenized in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate using a PolytronTM homogenizer (Brinkman Instruments, Rexdale, ON), then centrifuged at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant was aliquoted and lyophilized. Total protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad Protein Assay reagent (Bio-Rad) as described by the manufacturer using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Immunoblots were performed using the ECLTM Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The primary antibody used was an unpurified polyclonal antibody preparation against wflAFP-6 prepared in rabbit that was kindly provided by Dr. P. L. Davies (Queen's University, Kingston, ON). Lyophilized skin tissue protein was re-dissolved in 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) and injected onto a Mono STM HR 5/5 (5 mm × 50 mm) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and protein was eluted using a step-gradient of NaCl concentration using the FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Presence of type I AFPs were determined by immunoblotting analysis. The unbound fraction was collected and loaded onto a Mono QTM HR 5/5 (5 mm × 50 mm) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted using the same NaCl gradient. The unbound fraction was collected, dialyzed with 4 liters of 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, lyophilized, then re-dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Final purification was achieved by reverse-phase HPLC using a Bondclone 10-μm C18 (300 mm × 7.80 mm) column (Phenomenex). Peaks containing AFPs were identified by ice crystal morphology after lyophilization and re-dissolving in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate. Thermal hysteresis was assayed in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate using a Clifton Nanolitre Osmometer (Clifton Technical Physics, Hartford, NY) as previously described (15Chakrabartty A. Yang D.S. Hew C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11313-11316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concentration was determined by amino acid analysis. All values are an average of 4 to 6 measurements with thermal hysteresis of buffer alone subtracted and error bars represent ± 1 S.D. Trypsin (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Laval, QC) was re-constituted in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate and combined with AFP samples in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate in a ratio of 1:50 trypsin to protein sample. Endoproteinase Asp-N (Roche Molecular Diagnostics) was re-constituted in H2O and protein samples for Asp-N digestion were re-dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Negative controls consisted of enzyme and buffer alone. For r-lssAFP(38) the Asp-N to protein sample ratio was 1:125. For lssAFP-8, the ratio of Asp-N to protein sample used was 1:200. Digestions were carried out at 37 °C for 11 to 14 h in a PerkinElmer 2400 thermocycler. Digested samples were de-salted using ZipTipC18TM pipette tips (Millipore, Nepean, ON), then dried down in a Speed Vac concentrator (Savant Instruments, Hicksville, NY). A Q-TOF tandem mass spectrometer (Micromass Canada, Montreal, QC) was employed for all mass spectrometric measurements. All samples were dissolved in 2–10 μl of 1:1 acetonitrile:water (plus 1% (v/v) HCOOH) or 1:1 acetonitrile:water (plus 0.2% (v/v) acetic acid). Samples were deposited onto a nanoflow probe tip and analyzed in the nanoelectrospray mode. Quadrupole RF settings were between 0.5 and 1.0 for MS, and 0.25 for MS/MS. The scanning region was between 50 and 3500 with a scan time of 1 s and a dwell time of 0.1 s. The data was analyzed using MassLynx (Micromass Canada). Molecular weight determination was performed using maximum entropy based procedure (MaxEnt 1). Peptide fragmentation (MS/MS) data was first analyzed using a MaxEnt 3 procedure followed by manual sequence calling using PepSeq. All DNA sequencing was performed using the T7 SequencingTM Kit as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), or by the DNA sequencing facility of the Centre for Applied Genomics (Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON). Amino acid analysis was performed by the Advanced Protein Technology Centre (Hospital for Sick Children). Total RNA from tissues of a longhorn sculpin were probed in Northern analysis using the 3′-UTR of the shorthorn sculpin skin-type AFP (sssAFP-2) clone, s3-2 (11Low W.K. Miao M. Ewart K.V. Yang D.S.

Of the tissues examined, strong specific bands were found only in the skin, dorsal fin, and gill filaments at ∼1 kilobase in size (Fig.1 A). A much weaker signal can be detected in the stomach. Primers were designed (LS-RT-PCR-right and -left, see Fig. 2) from the sssAFP-2 ORF and RT-PCR was performed on longhorn sculpin total RNA samples. A 388-bp product was detected in skin and gill filaments, but no product was found in the liver (data not shown). One independent clone of the RT-PCR products from each of the gill filaments and skin were sequenced and found to be identical. Analysis of the RT-PCR product revealed a 129-bp ORF that encodes for a 42-residue, Ala-rich polypeptide (see Fig. 2). Due to the high Ala content, the predicted α-helix secondary structure, and the apparent 11-residue repeat structure (see below), the polypeptide encoded for by the ORF was classified as a type I AFP. The polypeptide sequence was designated as lssAFP (forlonghorn sculpin skin-typeAFP) as per the nomenclature scheme presented in Lowet al. (11Low W.K. Miao M. Ewart K.V. Yang D.S. Fletcher G.L. Hew C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23098-23103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and was classified as a skin-type AFP due to its presence in the skin tissue and the lack of a signal sequence. RACE PCR primers (see Fig. 2) were used in 3′- and 5′-RACE reactions on total RNA from skin tissue. Initially, the 5′-RACE reaction produced a smeared product, with the majority at ∼150 bp in length (data not shown). The 5′-RACE reactions were repeated with 10% glycerol (v/v) and a PCR product of 271 bp was identified (data not shown). Three independent clones of this product were sequenced and found to be identical (see Fig. 2) with no start codons (ATG) upstream of the ORF. The 3′-RACE reaction produced four products (data not shown). Upon partial sequencing of the four products, only the one with the strongest signal, 3′BAND-3 showed any relation to the RT-PCR product. Two independent clones of 3′BAND-3 where fully sequenced and found to be identical each other. However, the two clones contained a 33-bp deletion just after the LS-RACE-left primer when compared with the RT-PCR sequence (data not shown). Using the 3′-BAND-3 sequence, a third primer was designed from the sequence in front of the poly(A+) tail, LS-RACE-right-3 (see Fig. 2), and PCR was repeated using this primer paired with the LS-RACE-left primer in 10% glycerol (v/v). Under these conditions, a PCR product ∼30–40 bp larger was produced and was named 3′BAND-3-right 3. Sequencing of two independent clones of 3′BAND-3-right 3 revealed that it contained the missing 33 bp (see Fig. 2). The full-length sequence of thelssAFP (∼800 bp) gene is shown in Fig. 2(GenBankTM accession number AF306348). To confirm the results of the Northern analysis, RT-PCR was performed on a wider range of tissues (Fig. 1 B). A qualitative examination of the RT-PCR products shows three different levels of positive signals. The strongest positives can be found in the gill filament, dorsal fin, and skin. Moderate signals are found in the stomach, kidney, and intestine, with lowest signal levels found in the brain and liver. The levels found in the brain and liver are about 10-fold lower than those found in the digestive tract tissues. As well, Southern blotting analysis using the RT-PCR product as a probe, indicates that the lssAFPs are encoded for by a multigene family (Fig.3), with at least five bands that can be distinguished in the HindIII digest of genomic DNA (Fig. 3,lane 3). To assess the functionality of the isolated ORF, a recombinant protein was produced in E. coli as a secreted and mature polypeptide. The HPLC profile for the final purification step is shown in Fig.4 A. The results of amino acid analysis on the recombinant protein are shown in TableI and a molecular mass of 3452 Da was determined by nanospray ESI-MS which was less than the predicted monoisotopic mass of 3794 Da for the complete ORF. Furthermore, the amino acid analysis results, while similar, were not an exact match with the predicted amino acid composition (see Table I). Trypsin and Asp-N peptide mapping in conjunction with tandem MS sequencing covering the entire polypeptide demonstrated that the smaller size of the recombinant protein was the result of a C-terminal truncation (data not shown). The complete sequence of r-lssAFP(38) consists of the first 38 residues of the lssAFP (clone) sequence (see Fig. 6), hence the name r-lssAFP(38).Table IAmino acid analysis results for r-lssAFP(38) and lssAFP-7 to -10Key type I AFP residues are highlighted in grey.

The percent Ala composition, and the molecular mass of the major monoisotopic peak of each species as determined by nanospray ESI MS are given below. Values indicated by an asterisk (*) are predicted values from the cDNA sequence for lssAFP. The activity of r-lssAFP(38) was assayed in comparison with reverse-phase HPLC-purified recombinant wfsAFP-2 that was produced using the unmodified expression vector (13Lin Q. Ewart K.V. Yan Q. Wong W.K. Yang D.S. Hew C.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Ice crystal morphology in the presence of r-lssAFP(38) is the typical bipyramidal form observed with all AFPs (Fig. 4 A, inset). The activity curve for r-lssAFP(38) (Fig. 4 B) shows the typical hyperbolic curve that approaches a maximum and its activity is ∼13–14% higher than that of wfsAFP-2. A polyclonal antibody preparation against wflAFP-6, anti-type I AFP, was tested for cross-reactivity to longhorn sculpin skin proteins. This antibody preparation is known to cross-react with all type I AFPs found in the shorthorn sculpin and winter flounder. 2W-K. Low, Q. Lin, and C. L. Hew, unpublished observation. The anti-type I AFP polyclonal antibody preparation cross-reacted specifically with skin protein that was approximately the same size as r-lssAFP(38) (data not shown). Examination of a broad range of tissues using anti-type I AFP shows that while mRNA can be detected in all tissues, native lssAFP polypeptides are only strongly detected in the skin, dorsal fin, and gill filaments (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1, 8, and9) and weakly detected in the stomach (Fig. 1 C, lane 4). Native lssAFPs were purified from skin tissue by cation exchange, followed by anion exchange chromatography, with antifreeze activity detected in the unbound fraction in both instances (data not shown). Final purification was performed using C18 reverse-phase HPLC (Fig.5 A). The presence of active AFPs was determined by examining the ice crystal morphology. The bipyramidal ice crystal morphology was only detected in peaks 7–10 (data not shown). These four peaks were designated as lssAFP-7 to -10 for longhorn sculpin skin-typeAFP-7 to 10. The amino acid composition of each peak is shown in Table I. Aliquots of each lssAFP sample were analyzed by nanospray ESI-MS. The molecular mass for each lssAFP is given in Table I. Two polypeptides, lssAFP-7 and -8, were subjected to Q-TOF tandem MS sequencing after endoproteinase digestion with trypsin, and lssAFP-8 was further characterized by Asp-N digestion. Using the overlapping sequences obtained from trypsin and Asp-N analysis, complete sequence coverage was obtained for lssAFP-8 (Fig. 5 B). Peptide mapping followed by tandem MS analysis of lssAFP-8 revealed contaminating peptides (data not shown) that would account for the discrepancies between the determined sequence and amino acid analysis results for lssAFP-8. Nevertheless, the sequence of lssAFP-8 is identical to the clone sequence except for the lack of a C-terminal Lys residue. A residual mass of 42 Da at the N-terminal end of the MH+ of 673.34 Da indicates that the polypeptide was blocked with an acetyl group at the N terminus. The determined sequence has a predicted monoisotopic mass of 3707.96 Da, which agrees well with the major monoisotopic peak of 3708 Da observed in the undigested sample. Tryptic analysis and tandem MS of lssAFP-7 clearly shows that it is also related to the cloned lssAFP gene sequence (Fig. 5 B). However, due to lack of sample, Asp-N analysis of lssAFP-7 was not performed, thus the sequential order of the tryptic peptides could not be determined. Based on the cDNA sequence of the shorthorn sculpin skin-type AFP (sssAFP-2), the homologous skin-type AFP of the longhorn sculpin has been cloned by RT-PCR and RACE methods.

One of these proteins was a new protein that appeared in front of albumin in polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis using a 4.5−16% gel. To purify this protein, turpentine-administrated chicken serum was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation at 50% saturation, and the supernatant fraction was chromatographed on a DEAE-Toyopearl 650S column. The purified protein is a mannose-glycoprotein, and its N-terminal sequence, determined by the Edoman method, is not homologous from that of other reported acute-phase proteins. An analysis of physiological function with two different test systems, chemiluminescence measurement and electron spin resonance spectroscopy, showed that the purified protein has antioxidant activity and inhibits superoxide (O⨪2) mediated by activation of the receptor. In support of these results, the complete amino acid sequence of 18-B is homologous to the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) family of proteins that participate in the regulation of leukocyte function. 18-B is composed of four SRCR domains, which is different from the previously characterized SRCR family of proteins such as Spα, CD6, and CD163. These findings indicate that turpentine-induced 18-B, a new member of scavenger receptor cysteine-rich family, may be implicated in regulation of cell function in a manner of inhibition of the overproduction of the reactive oxygen species.

We have been searching for new marker proteins to improve the diagnosis for the acute phase of chicken. Turpentine enhances the synthesis of acute-phase proteins and has been used as an inducer of acute inflammation (8Sinha B.K. Vegad J.L. Awadhiya R.P. Res. Vet. Sci. 1987; 42: 365-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Jain N.K. Vegad J.L. Awadhiya R.P. Vet. Rec. 1982; 110: 421-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).Tohjo et al. (10Tohjo H. Miyoshi F. Uchida E. Niiyama M. Syuto B. Poult. Sci. 1995; 74: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) described two proteins, named 18-B and 18-C, that appeared in abundance after administration of turpentine. These proteins migrated in front of albumin in 4.5–16% polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis (PAGE).1 Since 18-B was not detected in the serum of healthy chickens, the protein was considered to be a new acute-phase protein. Tohjo et al. (10Tohjo H. Miyoshi F. Uchida E. Niiyama M. Syuto B. Poult. Sci. 1995; 74: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) did not further characterize 18-B.On the other hand, Urban et al. (11Urban J. Chan D. Schreiber G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10565-10568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that a new acute-phase α-1 protein in rat was induced by turpentine administration and that its molecular mass based on SDS-PAGE was 68 kDa. 18-B in chicken is similar in electrophoretic characteristics and molecular size to Urban's protein in rat, but it is not clear whether both these proteins are identical or not.In this study, we attempted to identify a new acute-phase protein in chicken serum to establish a new marker for acute-phase inflammation. Thus, we purified a turpentine-induced protein from chicken serum and compared its molecular properties with those of the rat protein. In addition, we report the physiological function, cDNA cloning, and characteristics of 18-B.DISCUSSIONIn this study, 18-B was purified by salting-out and DEAE chromatography, finally yielding 0.4 mg of 18-B from 1 ml of the chicken acute-phase serum. This protein corresponds to 18-B reported by Tohjo et al. (10Tohjo H. Miyoshi F. Uchida E. Niiyama M. Syuto B. Poult. Sci. 1995; 74: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and was first isolated in the present study. This protein is a single peptide with a molecular mass of 54 kDa.Several chicken serum proteins, such as C-reactive protein, hemopexin, fibrin, fibrinogen, transferrin, α1-acid glycoprotein, and α2-macroglobulin, are shown to increase with increasing degree of inflammation (1−7). In addition, haptoglobin (9Jain N.K. Vegad J.L. Awadhiya R.P. Vet. Rec. 1982; 110: 421-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), transferrin (10Tohjo H. Miyoshi F. Uchida E. Niiyama M. Syuto B. Poult. Sci. 1995; 74: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and α1-acid glycoprotein (6Delers F. Domingo M. Engler R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1983; 74: 619-622Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar) are shown to be elevated in chicken by administration of turpentine. However, none of these proteins had all the molecular properties of 18-B (molecular size, N-terminal sequence, carbohydrate composition, and antigenicity).Urban et al. (11Urban J. Chan D. Schreiber G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10565-10568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported a novel turpentine-induced glycoprotein with a single peptide chain in rat. This protein has a molecular mass of 56 kDa and a pI value of 4.7. These properties are similar to those of 18-B, but the N-terminal amino acid sequences of these two proteins are not homologous. These results suggest that 18-B is a new turpentine-induced protein of chicken.To further understand the function of 18-B, the complete amino acid sequence was determined by cDNA cloning. The deduced amino acid sequence of 18-B has four repeated sequences. A search of all sequences in the GenBankTM data base was carried out to identify similar sequences, which resulted in homology with members of the SRCR family of proteins, such as hensin, macrophage scavenger receptor, WC1, CRP-ductin, ebnerin, CD163, Spα, CD5, and CD6. There are two types of SRCR family: SRCR group A domains contain six cysteine residues and are encoded by two exons, which include macrophage scavenger receptor and related proteins (26Kodama T. Freeman M. Rohrer L. Zabrecky J. Matsudaira P. Krieger M. Nature. 1990; 343: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar), etc. SRCR group B domains contain eight cysteine residues and are encoded by a single exon, which include leukocyte antigens CD5, CD6, CD163 (M130), WC1, and Spα, etc. (27Jones N.H.

Each of the cysteine-rich domains of 18-B shares high degrees of sequence homology with that of SRCR group B family, in particular conserved sequence elements, including eight cysteine residues. These indicate that 18-B belongs to the SRCR group B family. The domain organization of 18-B is similar to, but different from, those of the previously reported proteins. Because 18-B is composed exclusively of SRCR domains, it can be distinguished from multidomain proteins that have both CUB (C1r/C1s Uegf Bmp 1) and ZP (zona pellucida) domains besides SRCR domain, such as hensin, CRP-ductin, and ebnerin (32Takito J.

Furthermore, 18-B has neither transmembrane nor cytoplasmic domain, which indicates that 18-B is different from membrane proteins, such as CD5, CD6, and CD163 (27Jones N.H. Clabby M.L. Dialynas D.P.

Immunol. 1993; 23: 2320-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Secreted protein, Spα, is the only protein that has such a simple domain organization, which is composed of SRCR domain only (31Gebe J.A. Kiener P.A. Ring H.Z. Li X. Francke U. Aruffo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6151-6158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, comparison of 18-B with Spα revealed two major differences: the primary structure of 18-B is longer by 123 residues than that of Spα, and 18-B has four domains, whereas Spα has three SRCR domains. On the basis of these findings, we propose that 18-B is a new member of the SRCR group B family of proteins.Leukocyte function is regulated by a discrete number of cell surface and secreted antigens that govern leukocyte activation, proliferation, survival, cell adhesion and migration, and effector function. Among the proteins that have been shown to regulate leukocyte function are members of the SRCR family (36Krieger M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 37Aruffo A. Bowen M.A. Patel D.D. Haynes B.F. Starling G.C. Gebe J.A. Bajorath J. Immunol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18187-18190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The results of the chemiluminescence measurement and ESR spectroscopy proved 18-B to be an antioxidant. The suppressive effect of 18-B on the O⨪2production of heterophils is stronger in receptor-mediated response than of PKC-mediated response. This result was consistent in both chemiluminescence and ESR analysis, which indicate that 18-B inhibits O⨪2 mostly by activation of receptor and not by direct activation of PKC.The function of members of the SRCR group B family is not defined conclusively and fully understood yet. WC1 is involved in γδT cell regulation (30Wijngaard P.L. Metzelaar M.J. MacHugh N.D. Morrison W.I. Clevers H.C. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3273-3277PubMed Google Scholar). CD5 and CD6 modulate T cell activation. Spα is thought to regulate monocyte function (31Gebe J.A. Kiener P.A. Ring H.Z. Li X. Francke U. Aruffo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6151-6158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These proteins obviously exert their functions after binding to a specific ligand: CD5 binds to CD72 (40van de Velde H. von Hoegen I. Luo W. Parnes J.R. Thielemans K.

However, our results showing that 18-B inhibits O⨪2 mostly by activation of receptor suggest that there may be a 18-B-binding protein on heterophils, and 18-B may regulate heterophil function in a manner of inhibition of the overproduction of the reactive oxygen species.In conclusion, our studies demonstrate that turpentine-induced 18-B is a new member of SRCR family of proteins, which may be implicated in regulation of cell function. Several acute-phase proteins in serum, such as C-reactive protein, hemopexin, fibrin, fibrinogen, transferrin, α1-acid glycoprotein, and α2-macroglobulin, have been reported in chicken (1Patterson L.T.

We have been searching for new marker proteins to improve the diagnosis for the acute phase of chicken. Turpentine enhances the synthesis of acute-phase proteins and has been used as an inducer of acute inflammation (8Sinha B.K. Vegad J.L. Awadhiya R.P. Res. Vet. Sci. 1987; 42: 365-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Jain N.K. Vegad J.L. Awadhiya R.P. Vet. Rec. 1982; 110: 421-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Tohjo et al. (10Tohjo H. Miyoshi F. Uchida E. Niiyama M. Syuto B. Poult. Sci. 1995; 74: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) described two proteins, named 18-B and 18-C, that appeared in abundance after administration of turpentine. These proteins migrated in front of albumin in 4.5–16% polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis (PAGE).1 Since 18-B was not detected in the serum of healthy chickens, the protein was considered to be a new acute-phase protein. Tohjo et al. (10Tohjo H. Miyoshi F. Uchida E. Niiyama M. Syuto B. Poult. Sci. 1995; 74: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) did not further characterize 18-B. On the other hand, Urban et al. (11Urban J. Chan D. Schreiber G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10565-10568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that a new acute-phase α-1 protein in rat was induced by turpentine administration and that its molecular mass based on SDS-PAGE was 68 kDa. 18-B in chicken is similar in electrophoretic characteristics and molecular size to Urban's protein in rat, but it is not clear whether both these proteins are identical or not. In this study, we attempted to identify a new acute-phase protein in chicken serum to establish a new marker for acute-phase inflammation. Thus, we purified a turpentine-induced protein from chicken serum and compared its molecular properties with those of the rat protein. In addition, we report the physiological function, cDNA cloning, and characteristics of 18-B. DISCUSSIONIn this study, 18-B was purified by salting-out and DEAE chromatography, finally yielding 0.4 mg of 18-B from 1 ml of the chicken acute-phase serum. This protein corresponds to 18-B reported by Tohjo et al. (10Tohjo H. Miyoshi F. Uchida E. Niiyama M. Syuto B. Poult. Sci. 1995; 74: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and was first isolated in the present study. This protein is a single peptide with a molecular mass of 54 kDa.Several chicken serum proteins, such as C-reactive protein, hemopexin, fibrin, fibrinogen, transferrin, α1-acid glycoprotein, and α2-macroglobulin, are shown to increase with increasing degree of inflammation (1−7). In addition, haptoglobin (9Jain N.K. Vegad J.L. Awadhiya R.P. Vet. Rec. 1982; 110: 421-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), transferrin (10Tohjo H. Miyoshi F. Uchida E. Niiyama M. Syuto B. Poult. Sci. 1995; 74: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and α1-acid glycoprotein (6Delers F. Domingo M. Engler R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1983; 74: 619-622Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar) are shown to be elevated in chicken by administration of turpentine. However, none of these proteins had all the molecular properties of 18-B (molecular size, N-terminal sequence, carbohydrate composition, and antigenicity).Urban et al. (11Urban J. Chan D. Schreiber G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10565-10568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported a novel turpentine-induced glycoprotein with a single peptide chain in rat. This protein has a molecular mass of 56 kDa and a pI value of 4.7. These properties are similar to those of 18-B, but the N-terminal amino acid sequences of these two proteins are not homologous. These results suggest that 18-B is a new turpentine-induced protein of chicken.To further understand the function of 18-B, the complete amino acid sequence was determined by cDNA cloning. The deduced amino acid sequence of 18-B has four repeated sequences. A search of all sequences in the GenBankTM data base was carried out to identify similar sequences, which resulted in homology with members of the SRCR family of proteins, such as hensin, macrophage scavenger receptor, WC1, CRP-ductin, ebnerin, CD163, Spα, CD5, and CD6. There are two types of SRCR family: SRCR group A domains contain six cysteine residues and are encoded by two exons, which include macrophage scavenger receptor and related proteins (26Kodama T. Freeman M. Rohrer L. Zabrecky J. Matsudaira P. Krieger M. Nature. 1990; 343: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar), etc. SRCR group B domains contain eight cysteine residues and are encoded by a single exon, which include leukocyte antigens CD5, CD6, CD163 (M130), WC1, and Spα, etc. (27Jones N.H.

Each of the cysteine-rich domains of 18-B shares high degrees of sequence homology with that of SRCR group B family, in particular conserved sequence elements, including eight cysteine residues. These indicate that 18-B belongs to the SRCR group B family. The domain organization of 18-B is similar to, but different from, those of the previously reported proteins. Because 18-B is composed exclusively of SRCR domains, it can be distinguished from multidomain proteins that have both CUB (C1r/C1s Uegf Bmp 1) and ZP (zona pellucida) domains besides SRCR domain, such as hensin, CRP-ductin, and ebnerin (32Takito J.

Furthermore, 18-B has neither transmembrane nor cytoplasmic domain, which indicates that 18-B is different from membrane proteins, such as CD5, CD6, and CD163 (27Jones N.H. Clabby M.L. Dialynas D.P.

Secreted protein, Spα, is the only protein that has such a simple domain organization, which is composed of SRCR domain only (31Gebe J.A. Kiener P.A. Ring H.Z. Li X. Francke U. Aruffo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6151-6158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, comparison of 18-B with Spα revealed two major differences: the primary structure of 18-B is longer by 123 residues than that of Spα, and 18-B has four domains, whereas Spα has three SRCR domains. On the basis of these findings, we propose that 18-B is a new member of the SRCR group B family of proteins.Leukocyte function is regulated by a discrete number of cell surface and secreted antigens that govern leukocyte activation, proliferation, survival, cell adhesion and migration, and effector function. Among the proteins that have been shown to regulate leukocyte function are members of the SRCR family (36Krieger M. Curr. Opin.

The results of the chemiluminescence measurement and ESR spectroscopy proved 18-B to be an antioxidant. The suppressive effect of 18-B on the O⨪2production of heterophils is stronger in receptor-mediated response than of PKC-mediated response. This result was consistent in both chemiluminescence and ESR analysis, which indicate that 18-B inhibits O⨪2 mostly by activation of receptor and not by direct activation of PKC.The function of members of the SRCR group B family is not defined conclusively and fully understood yet. WC1 is involved in γδT cell regulation (30Wijngaard P.L. Metzelaar M.J. MacHugh N.D. Morrison W.I. Clevers H.C. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3273-3277PubMed Google Scholar).

To identify potential sorting signals that mediate mAChR targeting, we examined the sorting of mAChRs in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, a widely used model system. Expression of FLAG-tagged mAChRs in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells demonstrated that the M2 subtype is sorted apically, whereas M3 is targeted basolaterally. Expression of M2/M3 receptor chimeras revealed that a 21-residue sequence, Ser271–Ser291, from the M3 third intracellular loop contains a basolateral sorting signal. Substitution of sequences containing the M3sorting signal into the homologous regions of M2 was sufficient to confer basolateral localization to this apical receptor. Sequences containing the M3 sorting signal also conferred basolateral targeting to M2 when added to either the third intracellular loop or the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. Furthermore, addition of a sequence containing the M3 basolateral sorting signal to the cytoplasmic tail of the interleukin-2 receptor α-chain caused significant basolateral targeting of this heterologous apical protein. The results indicate that the M3basolateral sorting signal is dominant over apical signals in M2 and acts in a position-independent manner. The M3 sorting signal represents a novel basolateral targeting motif for G protein-coupled receptors. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) can be differentially localized in polarized cells.

Protein sorting is particularly important in polarized cells such as neurons and epithelia, where cell-surface proteins must be specifically routed to distinct plasma membrane subdomains. The mechanisms responsible for the correct targeting of membrane proteins in polarized cells remain a fundamental question in cell biology. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK)1 epithelial cells provide a widely used and well characterized model system for studies of protein targeting (1Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin.

In contrast, basolateral sorting signals are almost always found in the cytoplasmic domain of transmembrane proteins and frequently contain a critical tyrosine residue, a dihydrophobic motif, a cluster of acidic residues, or a combination of these elements (10Matter K.

Although much has been learned about the sorting of single-pass transmembrane proteins, little is known about signals that mediate the targeting of proteins with multiple membrane-spanning domains. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) are a family of seven-transmembrane domain, G protein-coupled receptors composed of five distinct subtypes (M1–M5). The M1, M3, and M5 receptors preferentially couple to activation of phospholipase C via the Gq/11 family of G proteins, whereas the M2 and M4 receptors preferentially couple to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase via the Gi/o family (14Wess J. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1996; 10: 69-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In addition to their biochemical specificities, mAChR subtypes have unique cellular and subcellular distributions (15Caulfield M.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 58: 319-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). Muscarinic receptors are asymmetrically distributed in polarized cells such as pancreatic and lacrimal acinar cells (16Tan Y.P. Marty A. Trautmann A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11229-11233Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Toescu E.C. Lawrie A.M. Petersen O.H. Gallacher D.V.

Physiol. 1999; 277: C1220-C1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, mAChR subtypes are differentially localized in a variety of neuronal cells. For example, the M1 receptor is expressed in the cell bodies and dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal neurons and granule cells in the dentate gyrus, where it mediates postsynaptic responses to acetylcholine (22Levey A.I. Edmunds S.M. Koliatsos V. Wiley R.G. Heilman C.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4077-4092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, M2 is found mainly in the axon terminals of cholinergic and non-cholinergic septohippocampal projection neurons and hippocampal interneurons, where it modulates neurotransmitter release (23Rouse S.T. Thomas T.M. Levey A.I. Life Sci. 1997; 60: 1031-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 24Hájos N. Papp E.C.S. Acsády L. Levey A.I. Freund T.F. Neuroscience. 1998; 82: 355-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The M3 receptor is found both on cell bodies and dendrites of hippocampal granule and pyramidal neurons and on axon terminals in the hippocampal molecular layer and striatum (25Levey A.I. Edmunds S.M. Heilman C.J. Desmond T.J. Frey K.A. Neuroscience. 1994; 63: 207-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 26Rouse S.T. Gilmor M.L. Levey A.I. Neuroscience. 1998; 86: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Despite the differential localization of mAChR subtypes in a variety of polarized cells, little is known about the mechanisms by which their precise subcellular distributions are achieved. To begin to elucidate the signals and mechanisms that govern mAChR targeting, we have utilized the MDCK cell system to identify sorting determinants for mAChR subtypes. Although the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor possesses a basolateral sorting signal in its C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (27Beau I. Groyer-Picard M.-T. Le Bivic A. Vannier B. Loosfelt H. Milgrom E. Misrahi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18610-18616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and basolateral targeting information for the α2A-adrenergic receptor appears to be in a domain composed of multiple transmembrane sequences (28Saunders C. Keefer J.R. Bonner C.A. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24196-24206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), sorting information for G protein-coupled receptors in polarized cells remains largely unknown. In this report, we used chimeric receptor constructs in a gain-of-function approach to identify a basolateral sorting signal for the M3 mAChR in MDCK cells. The M3 basolateral sorting signal lies in a 21-amino acid sequence from the N-terminal portion of the third intracellular (i3) loop, is dominant over apical signals in the M2 receptor, and can act in a position-independent manner. This M3 sequence represents a novel basolateral sorting motif for G protein-coupled receptors. A modified FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDA) was added to the extracellular N termini of the M1–M5 mAChR coding sequences immediately after the initiator methionines using PCR to generate pFM1, pFM2, pFM3, pFM4, and pFM5. The mouse M1 (29Shapiro R.A. Scherer N.M. Habecker B.A. Subers E.M. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol.

For M1, M2, and M4, the forward primer encoded the FLAG epitope, and the forward and reverse primers contained unique restriction sites to facilitate subcloning into pCDPS. PCR fragments were as follows: M1,KpnI-NheI, nt 1–676 of M1 coding sequence; M2, KpnI-MscI, nt 1–689 of M2 coding sequence; and M4,SacI-NheI, nt 1–1229 of M4 coding sequence. The M3 and M5 receptors were FLAG-tagged using a sequential PCR approach as described (33Goldman P.S. Schlador M.L. Shapiro R.A. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4215-4222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), with the FLAG epitope encoded by internal primers. The M3 PCR product (NcoI-SnaBI) contained 306 nt of pCDPS vector sequence and nt 1–462 of M3 coding sequence. The M5 PCR product (NcoI-EcoRI) contained 367 base pairs of pCDPS vector sequence and nt 1–1021 of M5 coding sequence. PCR products were subcloned into the parental plasmids to generate epitope-tagged mAChRs. The ability of the FLAG-tagged receptors to bind the muscarinic antagonist [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (47 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was verified by transient expression in COS-7 or JEG-3 cells. The presence of the FLAG epitope was then verified by immunoprecipitation from transfected cell membranes using the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Studies of FLAG-M2mAChR-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, receptor desensitization, and sequestration have been reported previously (34Schlador M.L. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18882-18890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). M2/M3 chimeric mAChRs were constructed using sequential PCR as described (33Goldman P.S. Schlador M.L.

All PCR-amplified constructs were engineered with BglII and EcoRI sites at their 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, and cloned into the BglII andEcoRI sites of pCDPS. The sequences comprising the M2/M3 chimeras are as follows, with the numbers in parentheses representing the amino acid residues of M3that were substituted into M2: M2/M3-(240–590), coding nt 1–579 of M2 and nt 694–1779 of M3; M2/M3-(486–590), coding nt 1–1143 of M2 and nt 1456–1779 of M3; M2/M3-(240–485), coding nt 1–579 of M2, nt 694–1455 of M3, and nt 1144–1404 of M2; M2/M3-(384–485), coding nt 1–1014 of M2, nt 1150–1455 of M3, and nt 1144–1404 of M2; M2/M3-(240–383), coding nt 1–579 of M2, nt 694–1149 of M3, and nt 1015–1404 of M2; M2/M3-(240–309), coding nt 1–579 of M2, nt 694–927 of M3, and nt 793–1404 of M2; M2/M3-(253–296), coding nt 1–621 of M2, nt 757–888 of M3, and nt 754–1404 of M2; M2/M3-(297–309), coding nt 1–753 of M2, nt 889–927 of M3, and nt 793–1404 of M2; M2/M3-(253–269), coding nt 1–621 of M2, nt 757–807 of M3, and nt 673–1404 of M2; and M2/M3-(266–296), coding nt 1–660 of M2, nt 796–888 of M3, and nt 754–1404 of M2. Fusion proteins in which M3 sequences were added to either the i3 loop or the C terminus of M2 were generated by sequential PCR using pFM2 and either M2/M3-(266–296) or pFM3 as templates, respectively. The M2+M3-(i3:266–296) PCR product was cloned into the BglII and EcoRI sites of pCDPS, whereas the M2+M3 C-terminal fusion constructs were subcloned into the MscI and EcoRI sites of the parental pFM2 plasmid. The sequences comprising the M2+M3 fusion proteins are as follows: M2+M3-(i3:266–296), coding nt 1–660 of M2, nt 796–888 of M3, and nt 661–1404 of M2; M2+M3-(C-term:266–296), coding nt 1–1398 of M2 and nt 796–888 of M3; M2+M3-(C-term:271–296), coding nt 1–1398 of M2 and nt 811–888 of M3; M2+M3-(C-term:266–291), coding nt 1–1398 of M2 and nt 796–873 of M3; M2+M3-(C-term:271–291), coding nt 1–1398 of M2 and nt 811–873 of M3; and M2+M3-(C-term:570–590), coding nt 1–1398 of M2 and nt 1708–1779 of M3. The interleukin-2 receptor/M3 fusion protein was generated by sequential PCR using the human interleukin-2 receptor α-chain (IL-2Rα; Tac antigen) cDNA (pIL2R3; kindly provided by Dr. Warren J. Leonard, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (35Leonard W.J. Depper J.M. Crabtree G.R. Rudikoff S. Pumphrey J. Robb R.J. Krönke M. Svetlik P.B. Peffer N.J. Waldmann T.A. Greene W.C.

Both the fusion protein and wild-type IL-2Rα were cloned into the BglII andEcoRI sites of pCDPS. PCR-amplified DNA sequences were verified using an Applied Biosystems Model 373A automated sequencing system. MDCK (strain II) cells were obtained from Dr. Keith Mostov (University of California, San Francisco, CA). JEG-3 human choriocarcinoma and COS-7 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C in a humidified 10% CO2environment. To analyze the targeting of mAChR constructs, MDCK cells seeded at near-confluency (3.5 × 105cells/well) on 2-well glass chamber slides (4.2 cm2/well; Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) were transfected the following day using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with 4 μg of receptor cDNA/well. Cells were fixed at confluence (36–48 h post-transfection) with paraformaldehyde solution (4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 4% (w/v) sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.5 mmKH2PO4), pH 7.4) for 30 min at room temperature and processed for immunocytochemistry. Fixed cells were rinsed twice with PBST (PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20), permeabilized with 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100 (in PBS) for 5 min at room temperature, and blocked with 10% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBST containing 0.25% Triton X-100 for 2 h at room temperature. After blocking, cells were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 (1.2 μg/ml), anti-IL-2Rα (1:100; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), or anti-β-catenin (1:100; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) monoclonal antibody in PBST containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.25% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C in a humid chamber. Following four washes with PBST, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:250; Cappel Research Products, Durham, NC) in PBST containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.25% Triton X-100 for 2–3 h at room temperature. After four more washes with PBST, slides were coverslipped with Vectashield (Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Staining was visualized using a Nikon Optiphot 2 microscope equipped with a 60× Nikon oil immersion objective. Fluorescent images were collected in both thex-y and x-z planes using a Bio-Rad MRC600 laser scanning confocal microscope. For eachx-y image, a z-series of ∼20 optical sections was taken at 0.7-μm intervals from the apical to the basolateral regions of the cells. Images were projected and analyzed using Adobe Photoshop. Quantitation of the apical/basolateral distributions of mAChR constructs was performed using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the National Institutes of Health). The mean pixel intensity/unit area (pixel values 0–255) of staining in the apical and basolateral domains was determined by manually outlining the areas of interest in the raw (unprocessed) x-z images. Data were processed using Microsoft Excel. Muscarinic receptor-mediated changes in forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels in transiently transfected JEG-3 cells were analyzed as described previously (37Migeon J.C. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9767-9773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection mixtures contained (per well) 30 ng of receptor cDNA, 25 ng of α168-CRE-luciferase plasmid (38Mellon P.L.

The medium was changed 20–24 h after transfection; cells were treated with 0.4 μm forskolin and various concentrations of carbamylcholine (carbachol) an additional 20–24 h later as described (41Schlador M.L. Grubbs R.D. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol.

Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9767-9773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Muscarinic receptor-mediated stimulation of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis was determined in COS-7 cells as previously described (41Schlador M.L. Grubbs R.D. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol.

Cell-surface expression of mAChR constructs in transfected JEG-3 cells was determined by the binding ofN-[3H]methylscopolamine, a membrane-impermeable muscarinic antagonist, to intact cells as previously described (41Schlador M.L. Grubbs R.D. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23295-23302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Transfection mixtures contained (per 100-mm culture dish) 1.2 μg of receptor cDNA, 1.0 μg of α168 CRE-luciferase plasmid, 1.6 μg of Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase plasmid, 4.0 μg of Gαi2, and 2.2 μg of pCDPS carrier to achieve a total of 10.0 μg of DNA/dish. Cells from each dish were subcultured onto one 6-well plate 20–24 h after transfection and allowed to attach for an additional 24 h. N-[3H]Methylscopolamine binding assays were performed as described (41Schlador M.L. Grubbs R.D. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol.

Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that mAChRs are asymmetrically distributed in a variety of polarized cells (16Tan Y.P. Marty A. Trautmann A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Despite many observations of mAChR localization, little is known concerning the cellular mechanisms and molecular signals that underlie the sorting of mAChRs to specific subcellular domains. To identify sorting signals for mAChR subtypes, we examined their targeting in MDCK epithelial cells, a widely used and well characterized model system for protein sorting. For these studies, recombinant mAChRs were FLAG-tagged at their N termini to enable immunochemical detection. The FLAG-tagged M1, M2, and M3 receptors were expressed at levels similar to their non-tagged counterparts when transfected into COS-7 or JEG-3 cells, whereas the expression of FLAG-M4 and FLAG-M5 was significantly lower than that of the non-tagged receptors. 2L. S. Nadler and N. M. Nathanson, unpublished observations. For receptor targeting studies, the steady-state distributions of recombinant mAChRs were analyzed in confluent MDCK cells by immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. The M2 and M3 receptors displayed reciprocal polarized distributions. Although M2 was highly enriched on the apical membrane, M3 was localized to the basolateral domain (Fig.1, B and C). Although some basal M3 staining was evident, most M3 immunoreactivity was restricted to the lateral subdomain. In contrast, the M1, M4, and M5 receptors exhibited non-polarized distributions, with labeling apparent throughout the cells (Fig. 1, A,D, and E). MDCK cell polarity was verified by examining the distribution of the endogenous E-cadherin-associated protein β-catenin, a basolateral marker (4Hobert M.E. Kil S.J. Medof M.E. Carlin C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32901-32909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 43Yeaman C. Grindstaff K.K. Nelson W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 73-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). β-Catenin was exclusively localized to the lateral subdomain (Fig. 1 F), indicating that the cells are correctly polarized under our experimental conditions. These results demonstrate that the M2 and M3 mAChRs are targeted to opposite domains of MDCK cells at steady state and suggest that they possess sorting signals that direct them to distinct subcellular locations. The differential targeting of the M2 and M3 mAChRs allowed us to test the feasibility of using receptor chimeras to identify regions of the receptors important for either apical sorting of M2 or basolateral targeting of M3. Since basolateral sorting signals can be dominant over apical signals when present in the same molecule (4Hobert M.E. Kil S.J. Medof M.E. Carlin C.R. J. Biol.

Schematic diagrams of the initial set of chimeric constructs are presented in Fig.2. Fig. 3shows the steady-state localizations of these hybrid receptors. The first construct, M2/M3-(240–590), contains M3 Phe240–Leu590, encompassing the C-terminal half of the fifth transmembrane domain (TM5), the i3 loop, the sixth and seventh transmembrane domains (TM6 and TM7, respectively), and the C-terminal tail in the context of the M2 receptor. The M2/M3-(240–590) chimera displayed a primarily basolateral localization in MDCK cells similar to wild-type M3 (Fig. 3, B andC). This result suggests that a region of sequence in the C-terminal half of M3 is sufficient for basolateral targeting.Figure 3Localization of M2/M3chimeric receptors in MDCK cells. MDCK cells transfected with constructs encoding FLAG-tagged M2, M3, or M2/M3 receptor chimeras were fixed and stained with anti-FLAG antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” x-y (upper panels; projected z-series) and x-z(lower panels; vertical section taken at the level of thewhite line) images for each construct are shown.A, M2; B, M3;C, M2/M3-(240–590); D, M2/M3-(486–590); E, M2/M3-(240–485); F, M2/M3-(384–485); G, M2/M3-(240–383); H, M2/M3-(240–309).

M3Glu486–Leu590 did not confer basolateral targeting to M2, with the chimera having an apical distribution very similar to wild-type M2 (Fig. 3,A and D). This indicates that the M3basolateral sorting signal does not lie in TM6 or TM7 or in the C-terminal tail. M2/M3-(240–485), which contains the C-terminal half of TM5 and the i3 loop of M3in the context of M2, did exhibit a primarily basolateral distribution that was very similar to wild-type M3 (Fig. 3,B and E), suggesting that the basolateral sorting signal lies within the M3 i3 loop. Further dissection of the M3 sequence confirmed this possibility. Substitution of M3 Phe240–Leu383, containing the N-terminal half of the i3 loop, into M2 conferred a mainly basolateral localization to the receptor molecule, although minor apical staining was also apparent (Fig. 3 G). In contrast, substitution of M3 Pro384–Lys485, comprising the C-terminal half of the i3 loop, did not confer basolateral localization, and this chimera displayed an apical distribution similar to wild-type M2 (Fig. 3, Aand F). This suggests that the M3 basolateral sorting signal lies in the N-terminal half of the i3 loop. Furthermore, when M3 Phe240–Gly309 was substituted into M2, the receptor exhibited a basolateral distribution virtually indistinguishable from wild-type M3(Fig. 3, B and H). These data indicate that a 70-amino acid region from TM5 and the i3 loop of M3contains a basolateral sorting signal that is s"
