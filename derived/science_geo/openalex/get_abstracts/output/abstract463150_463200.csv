https://openalex.org/W2012043504,"NAD(+) is an important cofactor regulating metabolic homeostasis and a rate-limiting substrate for sirtuin deacylases. We show that NAD(+) levels are reduced in aged mice and Caenorhabditis elegans and that decreasing NAD(+) levels results in a further reduction in worm lifespan. Conversely, genetic or pharmacological restoration of NAD(+) prevents age-associated metabolic decline and promotes longevity in worms. These effects are dependent upon the protein deacetylase sir-2.1 and involve the induction of mitonuclear protein imbalance as well as activation of stress signaling via the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR(mt)) and the nuclear translocation and activation of FOXO transcription factor DAF-16. Our data suggest that augmenting mitochondrial stress signaling through the modulation of NAD(+) levels may be a target to improve mitochondrial function and prevent or treat age-associated decline."

The availability of well-annotated genome sequences for a variety of organisms has provided a strong foundation on which much biological knowledge has been assembled, including the generation of comprehensive genetic resources. This has been achieved in several model organisms, including E. coli, S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, A. thaliana, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster, greatly facilitating studies focused on single genes and enabling genome-wide genetic screens. Annotation of the human genome has identified over 20,000 protein-coding genes as well as many noncoding RNAs. Despite the dramatic increase in the knowledge of variation in human genomes, the normal function of many genes is still unknown or predicted from sequence analysis alone, and consequently, the disease significance of rare variants remains obscure. Furthermore, there remains a large bias toward research on a small number of the best-known genes (Edwards et al., 2011Edwards A.M. Isserlin R. Bader G.D. Frye S.V. Willson T.M. Yu F.H. Too many roads not taken.Nature. 2011; 470: 163-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Realizing the full value of the complete human genome sequence requires broadening this focus, and the availability of comprehensive biological resources will facilitate this process. The mouse is a key model organism for assessing mammalian gene function, providing access to conserved processes such as development, metabolism, and physiology. Genetic studies in mice, mostly via targeted mutagenesis in ES cells, have described a function for 7,229 genes (ftp://ftp.informatics.jax.org/pub/reports/MGI_PhenotypicAllele.rpt, February 2013). The vast majority of these studies have been directed at previously studied (known) genes, driven by previous biological knowledge. Phenotype-driven screens have also identified genes associated with specific phenotypes, although to a smaller extent. Although targeted mutagenesis has been very successful, the global distribution of the effort has resulted in significant heterogeneity in allele design, genetic background of mice used, and their phenotypic analysis. Furthermore, the biological focus of most targeted knockout experiments is constrained by the expertise of the specific research group. As a result, many phenotypes have not been detected, and consequently, the full biological function of many genes studied using knockout mice is significantly underreported. Some efforts to generate and phenotype sizeable sets of new targeted alleles of genes of interest have been reported previously (e.g., Tang et al., 2010Tang T. Li L. Tang J. Li Y. Lin W.Y. Martin F. Grant D. Solloway M. Parker L. Ye W. et al.A mouse knockout library for secreted and transmembrane proteins.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 749-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). These studies focused on specific categories of molecules such as secreted and transmembrane proteins or other “drugable” targets. Other research centers have established mouse clinics, with the aim of carrying out a comprehensive analysis of the phenotypes of mutant lines of specific interest (e.g., Fuchs et al., 2012Fuchs H. Gailus-Durner V. Neschen S. Adler T. Afonso L.C. Aguilar-Pimentel J.A. Becker L. Bohla A. Calzada-Wack J. Cohrs C. et al.Innovations in phenotyping of mouse models in the German Mouse Clinic.Mamm.

The Sanger Institute’s Mouse Genetics Project (MGP) was one of the first programs to pursue this objective, established in 2006 when the first targeted ES cells became available. The MGP later expanded to contribute to a European phenotyping effort, EUMODIC, and more recently has become a founding member of the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC). Summaries of the developing efforts and aspirations of the IMPC have been reported (e.g., Brown and Moore, 2012Brown S.D. Moore M.W.

Genome. 2012; 23: 600-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As the first established large-scale project using the KOMP/EUCOMM ES cells, the MGP has provided pilot data to inform the design of the international effort, such as the advantages of a single pipeline design, optimum numbers of mice, and details of variance for specific phenotyping tests. To date, the MGP has generated more than 900 lines of mutants using KOMP/EUCOMM resources (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/mouseportal/), and here, we describe the analysis of 489 of these for viability and fertility and 250 lines that have passed through a systematic screen for adult phenotypes, providing a glimpse into the wealth of biological insight that will emerge from these programs. Publicly available data enable the construction of new hypotheses, and the mouse mutants provide an invaluable resource for follow-up studies. Mice carrying targeted knockout first conditional-ready alleles from the KOMP/EUCOMM ES cell resources (Figures S1A and S1B available online; Skarnes et al., 2011Skarnes W.C. Rosen B. West A.P. Koutsourakis M. Bushell W. Iyer V. Mujica A.O. Thomas M. Harrow J. Cox T. et al.A conditional knockout resource for the genome-wide study of mouse gene function.Nature. 2011; 474: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar) were established on a C57BL/6 genetic background. The mutants generated are listed in Tables S1 and S2, and all are available through public repositories including EMMA (http://www.emmanet.org/) and KOMP (http://www.komp.org/). Two classes of alleles are represented: those targeted with a promoter-driven selectable marker, and those with promoterless targeting vectors. Most are expected to be null alleles based on previous experience with this design (Mitchell et al., 2001Mitchell K.J. Pinson K.I. Kelly O.G. Brennan J. Zupicich J. Scherz P. Leighton P.A.

A reliable lacZ expression reporter cassette for multipurpose, knockout-first alleles.Genesis. 2004; 38: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Data from 25 alleles showed that most (15) had <0.5% of normal transcript level detected in liver with a minority (4) showing a “leakiness” of ∼20% (column X; Table S2). The structure of each allele was confirmed when established in mice (Figure S1C). Viability was assessed at postnatal day 14 (P14) by genotyping offspring of heterozygous crosses (Figure 1A). Data from 489 targeted alleles are summarized in Figure 2A. Overall, 58% were fully viable, whereas 29% produced no homozygotes at P14 and were classed as lethal, consistent with the proportion of homozygous embryonic/perinatal lethal mutants reported by MGI (2,183 of 7,229 lines of mice [30%]; ftp://ftp.informatics.jax.org/pub/reports/MGI_PhenoGenoMP.rpt, February 2013). A further 13% produced fewer than 13% homozygotes and were considered to be subviable. Genes required for survival included alleles generated with both promoter-driven and promoterless selection cassettes, but the latter were significantly more likely to be lethal (Figure 2B; Table S3) despite a greater level of persistent gene expression (11 of 14 promotor-driven compared with 4 of 11 promotorless alleles with <0.5% expression; column X; Table S2).Figure 2Homozygous Viability and Fertility OverviewShow full caption(A) Homozygous viability at P14 was assessed in 489 EUCOMM/KOMP targeted alleles.

Of note is the strong skew toward male (blue circle) fertility issues (15 of 16 genes) compared to 4 of 15 genes that displayed female (red circle) fertility issues. See also Table S3. Alleles classed as lethal or subviable at P14 were further assessed at E14.5 (Figure 2C). From 143 alleles examined, 48% (68 genes) produced no homozygotes, indicating embryonic lethality and complete resorption by E14.5. One-third of alleles (n = 45) produced the expected number of homozygous embryos, whereas 30 (21%) produced fewer than expected homozygotes. Of the 75 mutant lines that produced homozygous embryos, 34 exhibited one or more morphological defect (Figure 2D). Some mutants (n = 23) presented with specific abnormalities including craniofacial defects and polydactyly, whereas 11 lines displayed only generalized indicators of developmental defects, edema, and/or growth retardation (Figure 2D). Examples are illustrated in Figures 2E–2G. Fertility of heterozygotes was assessed from heterozygous intercrosses. Of 489 alleles assessed, all heterozygotes were able to produce offspring. Homozygous mutants for 307 of the viable lines were then assessed. A homozygous infertility rate of 5.2% (n = 16) was observed (Figure 2H), strongly male biased with 15 of 16 genes exhibiting male infertility. A total of 11 genes affected only males, whereas just 1 was female specific (Pabpc1l). Of these 16 genes, 7 have not previously been associated with infertility. Although some were good candidates such as Usp42, expressed during mouse spermatogenesis (Kim et al., 2007Kim Y.K. Kim Y.S. Yoo K.J. Lee H.J. Lee D.R. Yeo C.Y. Baek K.H. The expression of Usp42 during embryogenesis and spermatogenesis in mouse.Gene Expr. Patterns. 2007; 7: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), others are novel genes such as 3010026O09Rik and may suggest new pathways or mechanisms influencing fertility. We report here the results of our screen of the first 250 lines to complete all primary phenotyping pipelines. In contrast to previous focused screens by Mitchell et al., 2001Mitchell K.J. Pinson K.I. Kelly O.G. Brennan J. Zupicich J. Scherz P. Leighton P.A. Goodrich L.V. Lu X.

Ye W. et al.A mouse knockout library for secreted and transmembrane proteins.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 749-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, a broad range of gene products was included. The 250 genes reported span all chromosomes except Y (Figure S1D) and include eight control lines published previously and 87 genes proposed by the research community. For 34 of the 250 genes, no functional information has been published. A comparison of this gene set with all mouse genes indicates minimal GO term enrichment spread over a variety of processes and underrepresentation only in sensory perception of smell, indicating that the gene set can be regarded as a reasonable sample of the genome. A series of tests was used (Figure 1B), designed to detect robust variations in phenotypes that were key indicators of a broad spectrum of disease categories. Of the 250 reported lines, 104 were either lethal or subviable; most of these were screened as heterozygotes (n = 90), and the remaining lines were screened as homozygotes and/or hemizygotes (n = 160). All mutant lines generated passed through all primary phenotypic screens. For most tests in the pipeline, seven males and seven females were used, tested in small batches so that the data for each genotype were gathered on different days (Figure S2A). Assays culminated in the collection of samples at 16 weeks of age (Table S4). The primary screen included a high-fat diet challenge to exacerbate any latent phenotypes. Separate pipelines included challenges with two infectious agents: Salmonella Typhimurium and Citrobacter rodentium (Table S4). Phenotypic data from the first 250 mutant alleles through the adult pipelines are summarized in Tables S1 and S2, with significant differences from the control baseline (hits) indicated by a red box. To make robust phenotypic calls, a reference range method was implemented that uses accumulated wild-type (WT) data to identify and refine the 95% reference range (Figure S2B). Mutant data were compared to the relevant reference range and variant phenotypes determined using a standardized set of rules (Figure S3). We aimed to highlight phenotypes with large effect sizes. This approach results in conservative calls and minimizes false positives. There was very little missing data (2.14% of all calls; Table S2). The maximum number of parameters collected per line was 263. Of these, 147 were categorical variables, for example normal or abnormal teeth, whereas 116, such as plasma magnesium levels, exhibited a continuous distribution from which outliers were identified. Examples of parameters with continuous variables (cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL], low-density lipoprotein [LDL], mean weights, and auditory brainstem responses [ABR]) are illustrated in Figure 3.Figure 3Data Distributions for Selected ParametersShow full caption(A–F) Distribution of mean total cholesterol (A and B), mean HDL cholesterol (C and D), and mean LDL cholesterol (E and F) at 16 weeks of age in both sexes for 250 unique alleles.

Gene expression was examined by whole-mount lacZ reporter gene expression in 41 tissues and organs of adults, typically using heterozygotes (≥6 weeks old; n = 243 lines; Table S1). Ubiquitous expression was recorded for eight lines (3.3%) and complete absence of expression in nine lines (3.7%). Of the remaining lines, 168 (69.1%) showed expression in <20 of the tissues, suggesting a relatively specific expression pattern, whereas 58 (23.9%) were more broadly expressed (≥20 tissues with detectable lacZ expression). The data and images can be viewed on the Sanger Institute’s mouse portal, accompanied by step-by-step examples of how to access the data (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/mouseportal/). Much of the raw data can be downloaded from the MGP Phenotyping Biomart (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/htgt/biomart/martview/) for further analysis. Summaries can be found by searching for each gene of interest in Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Genes_mutated_in_mice) and Mouse Genome Informatics (http://www.informatics.jax.org/). A few examples of the wide range of phenotypes we discovered are illustrated in Figure 4. Body weight and fat/lean composition were among the most common anomalies, with both overweight (n = 2) and underweight (n = 21) mutants discovered. The Kptn mutant is an example of an unexpected phenotype. Kptn is a putative actin binding protein proposed as a candidate for deafness because it is expressed in sensory hair cells (Bearer et al., 2000Bearer E.L. Chen A.F. Chen A.H. Li Z. Mark H.F. Smith R.J.H. Jackson C.L. 2E4/Kaptin (KPTN)— a candidate gene for the hearing loss locus, DFNA4.Ann. Hum. Genet. 2000; 64: 189-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, the homozygous Kptn mutant has increased body weight on a high-fat diet (Figure 4A) and increased bacterial counts following Salmonella Typhimurium challenge but normal hearing (Table S2). Additional new phenotypes were detected in genes that had been published previously, such as reduced grip strength and ankylosis of the metacarpophalangeal joints in Dnase1l2 mutants (Fischer et al., 2011Fischer H. Szabo S. Scherz J. Jaeger K. Rossiter H. Buchberger M. Ghannadan M. Hermann M. Theussl H.C. Tobin D.J. et al.Essential role of the keratinocyte-specific endonuclease DNase1L2 in the removal of nuclear DNA from hair and nails.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2011; 131: 1208-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), delayed response in the hot plate test in Git2 mutants (Schmalzigaug et al., 2009Schmalzigaug R. Rodriguiz R.M. Phillips L.E. Davidson C.E. Wetsel W.C. Premont R.T. Anxiety-like behaviors in mice lacking GIT2.Neurosci. Lett. 2009; 451: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and small sebaceous glands in Cbx7 mutants (Forzati et al., 2012Forzati F. Federico A. Pallante P. Abbate A. Esposito F. Malapelle U. Sepe R. Palma G. Troncone G. Scarfò M. et al.CBX7 is a tumor suppressor in mice and humans.J. Clin. Invest. 2012; 122: 612-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) (Figures 4B–4E, 4G, and 4H). Phenotypes were also detected in genes that had not been published previously, such as impaired hearing in Fam107b mutants and elevated plasma magnesium concentration in Rg9mtd2 mutants (Figures 4F and 4I, respectively). These examples demonstrate that many phenotypes will be missed unless they are specifically looked for and illustrate the value of carrying out a broad range of screens with all mutants going through all screens. They also reveal our collective inability to predict phenotypes based on sequence or expression pattern alone. Haploinsufficient phenotypes were detected in 38 of 90 (42%) of these lines. Thus, haploinsufficiency is relatively common, suggesting that screening heterozygotes of knockout lines can yield valuable insight into gene function and provide models for dominantly inherited human disorders. All 90 genes screened as heterozygotes had at least 1 hit (usually viability) and together gave a total of 181 hits (ranging from 1 to 14 per line), an average of 2.0 per line, or 1.0 per line if we consider that abnormal viability is a feature of the homozygote. The distributions of phenotypic hits are shown in Figures 5A and 5B. Two examples of haploinsufficiency are illustrated in Figures 4J–4N. A total of 837 phenotypic variants were detected in the 250 mutant lines, 1.27% of the total calls (Tables S1 and S2). Of the lines screened as homozygotes or hemizygotes, 35% (56 of 160) appeared completely normal in our screen. There are several possible explanations for the lack of a detected phenotype, such as incomplete inactivation of the gene, a subtle change in phenotype not detected by our screen, or the gene may be nonessential. So far, there is no overlap between the 56 mouse lines with no detected phenotype and genes homozygously inactivated in humans, but both data sets are limited in coverage to date (MacArthur et al., 2012MacArthur D.G. Balasubramanian S. Frankish A. Huang N. Morris J. Walter K. Jostins L. Habegger L. Pickrell J.K. Montgomery S.B. et al.1000 Genomes Project ConsortiumA systematic survey of loss-of-function variants in human protein-coding genes.Science. 2012; 335: 823-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). The remaining 104 homozygous/hemizygous lines gave a total of 656 hits (range 0–41 per line), an average of 6.3 hits per line. To assess the sensitivity of our screen, the phenotypes were compared with published data on alternative alleles where available. A total of 91 of 250 genes had published data reported in MGI (Table S5), and for 61 of these, our observations detected features of the published phenotypes. Importantly, for 56 genes, a new phenotype was detected by our screen (column K, Table S5). For 31 genes, features of the published phenotype were assessed but not detected by our pipeline. For example, Asxl1tm1Bc/tm1Bc mice are published as being viable (Fisher et al., 2010Fisher C.L. Pineault N. Brookes C. Helgason C.D. Ohta H. Bodner C. Hess J.L. Humphries R.K. Brock H.W. Loss-of-function Additional sex combs like 1 mutations disrupt hematopoiesis but do not cause severe myelodysplasia or leukemia.Blood. 2010; 115: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), but we found that Asxl1tm1a(EUCOMM)Wtsi homozygotes were lethal, with none detected among 276 progeny from heterozygous intercrosses (χ2 = 95.13, df = 2; p < 2.2 × 10−16). These discrepant cases may reflect differences in the allele and/or genetic background. In other cases (77 genes), the reported characteristics"

Cells that expressed Tmc2 had high calcium permeability and large single-channel currents, while cells with mutant Tmc1 had reduced calcium permeability and reduced single-channel currents. Cells that expressed Tmc1 and Tmc2 had a broad range of single-channel currents, suggesting multiple heteromeric assemblies of TMC subunits. The data demonstrate TMC1 and TMC2 are components of hair cell transduction channels and contribute to permeation properties. Gradients in TMC channel composition may also contribute to variation in sensory transduction along the tonotopic axis of the mammalian cochlea."
https://openalex.org/W2053670812,"Phagocytosis and degradation of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is fundamental to vision. Autophagy is also responsible for bulk degradation of cellular components, but its role in POS degradation is not well understood. We report that the morning burst of RPE phagocytosis coincided with the enzymatic conversion of autophagy protein LC3 to its lipidated form. LC3 associated with single-membrane phagosomes containing engulfed POS in an Atg5-dependent manner that required Beclin1, but not the autophagy preinitiation complex. The importance of this process was verified in mice with Atg5-deficient RPE cells that showed evidence of disrupted lysosomal processing. These mice also exhibited decreased photoreceptor responses to light stimuli and decreased chromophore levels that were restored with exogenous retinoid supplementation. These results establish that the interplay of phagocytosis and autophagy within the RPE is required for both POS degradation and the maintenance of retinoid levels to support vision."

However, the mechanisms that control spindle positioning to generate equal-sized daughter cells remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that two mechanisms act coordinately to center the spindle during anaphase in symmetrically dividing human cells. First, the spindle is positioned directly by the microtubule-based motor dynein, which we demonstrate is targeted to the cell cortex by two distinct pathways: a Gαi/LGN/NuMA-dependent pathway and a 4.1G/R and NuMA-dependent, anaphase-specific pathway. Second, we find that asymmetric plasma membrane elongation occurs in response to spindle mispositioning to alter the cellular boundaries relative to the spindle. Asymmetric membrane elongation is promoted by chromosome-derived Ran-GTP signals that locally reduce Anillin at the growing cell cortex. In asymmetrically elongating cells, dynein-dependent spindle anchoring at the stationary cell cortex ensures proper spindle positioning.

Our results reveal the anaphase-specific spindle centering systems that achieve equal-sized cell division. Cell division is a fundamental process that is required to increase cell number and alter cell types. During the development of multicellular organisms, cells undergo both symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions (Horvitz and Herskowitz, 1992Horvitz H.R. Herskowitz I.

Bellaïche Y. Mitotic spindle orientation in asymmetric and symmetric cell divisions during animal development.Dev. Cell. 2011; 21: 102-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Symmetric cell division generates identical daughter cells for clonal expansion, whereas asymmetric cell division creates distinct daughter cells to increase cell-type diversity. Symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions can vary in the distribution of cell-fate factors (Knoblich, 2008Knoblich J.A. Mechanisms of asymmetric stem cell division.Cell. 2008; 132: 583-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) and the size of the resulting daughter cells, with a subset of asymmetric divisions generating cells of different sizes (Gönczy, 2008Gönczy P. Mechanisms of asymmetric cell division: flies and worms pave the way.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, Siller and Doe, 2009Siller K.H. Doe C.Q. Spindle orientation during asymmetric cell division.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). For specification of these different cell-division types, the mitotic spindle must be oriented and positioned within the cell. The spindle position dictates the site at which the cytokinetic cleavage furrow is formed through signals emanating from the spindle midzone and astral microtubules during anaphase (Burgess and Chang, 2005Burgess D.R. Chang F. Site selection for the cleavage furrow at cytokinesis.Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 156-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To achieve a symmetric cell division with two equal-sized daughter cells, the mitotic spindle must be precisely positioned in the center of the dividing cell. The position of the mitotic spindle is controlled, at least in part, by dynein-dependent cortical pulling forces exerted on astral microtubules (Gönczy, 2008Gönczy P. Mechanisms of asymmetric cell division: flies and worms pave the way.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Dynein consists of a catalytic heavy chain (DHC) and noncatalytic subunits that interact with additional binding partners, such as the dynactin complex, to control the localization and function of the dynein motor (Kardon and Vale, 2009Kardon J.R. Vale R.D. Regulators of the cytoplasmic dynein motor.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 854-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). We and others have previously demonstrated that dynein and dynactin are recruited to the cell cortex by the Gαi-LGN-NuMA complex in symmetrically dividing human cells to generate pulling forces that control spindle position and orientation during metaphase (Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2012Kiyomitsu T.

Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, Kotak et al., 2012Kotak S. Busso C. Gönczy P. Cortical dynein is critical for proper spindle positioning in human cells.J.

However, although the loss of LGN randomizes spindle orientation, it does not result in unequal-sized daughter cells (Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2012Kiyomitsu T. Cheeseman I.M. Chromosome- and spindle-pole-derived signals generate an intrinsic code for spindle position and orientation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This indicates that additional mechanisms must act to center the spindle and generate equivalently sized daughter cells. Here, we analyzed the mechanisms that position the spindle within the cell during anaphase. We found that two parallel pathways involving LGN and 4.1 family proteins target dynein to the cell cortex to ensure equal-sized cell division. Unexpectedly, we found that cells also control spindle position by asymmetrically elongating their plasma membrane during anaphase to adjust the cellular boundaries and center the spindle within the cell. Thus, to achieve a symmetric cell division, cells coordinately control the movement of the spindle and the position of the cell boundaries to define a central cell-cleavage site. LGN depletion eliminates dynein heavy chain (DHC)-GFP localization to the cell cortex during metaphase and randomizes spindle orientation (Figure 1A; Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2012Kiyomitsu T. Cheeseman I.M. Chromosome- and spindle-pole-derived signals generate an intrinsic code for spindle position and orientation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). However, most LGN-depleted cells ultimately generate equal-sized daughter cells (Figure 1A; see below), suggesting that additional mechanisms act to specify the cell-cleavage site in the absence of LGN. Indeed, we found that dynein was recruited to the cell cortex during anaphase in 95% of LGN-depleted cells (Figure 1A). To dissect the requirements for cortical dynein recruitment during anaphase, we analyzed the localization of dynein, dynactin, and NuMA following the depletion of LGN, Gαi, or NuMA by RNAi in HeLa cells. Depletion of LGN or Gαi eliminated the cortical localization of dynein (DHC-GFP), the dynactin subunit p150, and NuMA during metaphase (Figure S1A available online; Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2012Kiyomitsu T. Cheeseman I.M. Chromosome- and spindle-pole-derived signals generate an intrinsic code for spindle position and orientation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), but not anaphase (Figures 1B, 1C, and S1B). In contrast, NuMA depletion reduced the localization of dynein/dynactin to both the metaphase and anaphase cell cortex (Figures 1B, 1D, S1B, and S1C). We note that the residual NuMA that remained following these depletion conditions (Figure 1D) is likely sufficient to suppress the previously defined contribution of NuMA to mitotic spindle assembly (Merdes et al., 1996Merdes A.

Because we found that NuMA was required for cortical dynein recruitment during anaphase, we next analyzed NuMA localization. NuMA and dynein/dynactin displayed increased levels at the cell cortex during anaphase relative to metaphase (Figures 1E, S1D, and S1E; Collins et al., 2012Collins E.S. Balchand S.K. Faraci J.L. Wadsworth P. Lee W.L. Cell cycle-regulated cortical dynein/dynactin promotes symmetric cell division by differential pole motion in anaphase.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23: 3380-3390Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas Gαi1 and LGN did not (Figures 1E and S1E). This suggests that an additional pool of NuMA and dynein is recruited to the cell cortex at anaphase onset. Consistent with two populations of NuMA, we found that the C-terminal globular region of NuMA (NuMA-C) localized only to the cell cortex during anaphase, but not during metaphase (Figures 1F and S1F–S1H). LGN depletion did not affect the localization of NuMA-C to the anaphase cell cortex (Figure S1I). Inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity using flavopiridol (Fla) in cells treated with the microtubule-depolymerizing drug nocodazole caused NuMA-C to accumulate at the cell cortex (Figure 1G), suggesting that this localization is negatively regulated by CDK. The C-terminal region of NuMA contains multiple CDK consensus phosphorylation sites, and a phosphodeficient mutant of full-length NuMA (“3A”; T2015A T2055A S2087A) shows increased accumulation at the cell cortex during metaphase (Compton and Luo, 1995Compton D.A. Luo C. Mutation of the predicted p34cdc2 phosphorylation sites in NuMA impair the assembly of the mitotic spindle and block mitosis.J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 621-633PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with a role for these phosphorylation sites in regulating cortical recruitment, we found that GFP-NuMA-C 3A localized prematurely to the cell cortex during metaphase (Figure 1F, lower). Taken together, these results suggest that the NuMA C-terminal region promotes the LGN-independent targeting of NuMA to the cell cortex during anaphase and is regulated by CDK-dependent phosphorylation. We hypothesized that NuMA-C 3A localizes to the metaphase cell cortex by interacting with cortical receptors that normally bind to dephosphorylated NuMA during anaphase. To identify the cellular binding partners for NuMA-C 3A, we isolated GFP-NuMA-C 3A from HeLa cells arrested in mitosis using nocodazole. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated that GFP-NuMA-C 3A copurified with 4.1G (also known as band 4.1-like 2 protein/ EPB41L2) and 4.1R (also known as band 4.1 protein/ EPB41; Figure 2A), but not with LGN. Similar purifications using an internally truncated version of NuMA lacking a large portion of the coiled-coil (NuMABonsai; Figures S1F and S1G) also isolated 4.1G (Figure 2A). GFP-tagged 4.1G and 4.1R localized to the cell cortex throughout mitosis (Figure 2B), similar to the case with endogenous 4.1G (Figure S2A). In reciprocal purifications, we found that GFP-4.1G isolated NuMA, but not LGN (Figure 2A). In our previous GFP-LGN purifications, we isolated NuMA, Gαi, dynein, and dynactin, but not 4.1 proteins (Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2012Kiyomitsu T. Cheeseman I.M. Chromosome- and spindle-pole-derived signals generate an intrinsic code for spindle position and orientation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Previous two-hybrid studies identified an interaction between NuMA and 4.1 proteins (Mattagajasingh et al., 1999Mattagajasingh S.N. Huang S.C. Hartenstein J.S. Snyder M. Marchesi V.T. Benz E.J.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10747-10756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but did not test the relationship between these proteins at the cell cortex. Importantly, codepletion of 4.1G and 4.1R, but not LGN depletion, disrupted the cortical localization of GFP-NuMA-C 3A during metaphase (Figures 2C and S2B). These results suggest that band 4.1 proteins associate with the NuMA C terminus to target it to the cell cortex.Figure S2Domain Analyses of 4.1 Proteins for Membrane Localization and Cortical Dynein Recruitment, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Fluorescent micrographs showing anti-4.1G antibody staining and DNA at metaphase and anaphase.(B) Western blot probed for anti-4.1G, anti-4.1R and anti-tubulin (loading control) antibodies showing the efficiency of 4.1G and 4.1R codepletion.(C) Western blot showing the efficiency of the RNAi-based depletions for LGN, 4.1G, and 4.1R.

Cortical NuMA localization was rescued during anaphase (right, arrow), but not in metaphase (left). Scale bars, 10 μm. Based on the results described above, we hypothesized that there are two parallel pathways for cortical NuMA/dynein/dynactin recruitment in HeLa cells: an LGN-dependent pathway and a 4.1-dependent, anaphase-specific pathway. To test this, we depleted LGN and 4.1 either individually or in combination by RNAi (Figures 2D and S2C). Individual depletion of LGN abolished cortical NuMA and dynein/dynactin localization during metaphase, but not during anaphase (Figures 2D, 2E, and S1A), whereas 4.1G/R depletion did not affect cortical NuMA or dynein/dynactin localization during either metaphase or anaphase (Figure 2D, 2E, S1A, and S2D). In contrast, codepletion of LGN and 4.1G/R abolished the cortical localization of NuMA, dynein, and dynactin during both metaphase and anaphase (Figures 2D, 2E, S1A, and S2D). In LGN and 4.1G/R codepleted cells, expression of RNAi-resistant versions of either mCherry-LGN or mCherry-4.1G restored dynein localization to the cell cortex (Figures 2F, S2E, and S2F). Together, these results suggest that an LGN-dependent pathway targets NuMA and dynein to the cell cortex during metaphase and maintains cortical dynein throughout anaphase, and that a 4.1-dependent pathway recruits a second pool of NuMA and dynein in parallel to the LGN-dependent pathway during anaphase. We next sought to define the requirements for the ability of LGN and 4.1 to target NuMA and dynein to the cell cortex. In contrast to replacement with full-length LGN, a LGN-C fragment lacking the NuMA-binding N-terminal region localized to the plasma membrane, but failed to restore cortical dynein localization in LGN and 4.1G/R codepleted cells (Figures 2F and S2E). Similarly, expression of mCherry-4.1GΔCTD lacking a ∼120 amino acid putative NuMA-binding C-terminal domain (CTD) (Figures 2G and S2G; Mattagajasingh et al., 1999Mattagajasingh S.N. Huang S.C.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10747-10756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) localized to the plasma membrane (Figure 2G and S2H), but failed to restore cortical dynein localization in LGN and 4.1G/R codepleted cells (Figures 2F, 2G, and S2F). Although the 4.1G-CTD itself does not localize to the membrane (Figure S2H), artificial targeting of the 4.1G-CTD to the membrane using a membrane-targeting signal (N terminus of neuromodulin; Mem-mCherry-4.1G-CTD) restored cortical dynein and NuMA localization during anaphase in LGN- and 4.1G/R-depleted cells (Figures 2F, 2H, S2I, and S2J). These results indicate that 4.1 proteins recruit NuMA and dynein to the anaphase cell cortex through their conserved CTD (Figure 2I). Cortical dynein is thought to define daughter-cell size by controlling the spindle position during anaphase (Gönczy, 2008Gönczy P. Mechanisms of asymmetric cell division: flies and worms pave the way.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Up to now, however, it has not been possible to analyze the specific roles of cortical dynein in vertebrate cells, because both dynein and NuMA play multiple roles in spindle structure, organization, and mitotic progression (Merdes et al., 1996Merdes A. Ramyar K. Vechio J.D. Cleveland D.W. A complex of NuMA and cytoplasmic dynein is essential for mitotic spindle assembly.Cell. 1996; 87: 447-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Here, we found that codepletion of LGN and 4.1G/R disrupted the localization of dynein to the cell cortex without affecting spindle structure, providing an ideal tool to test the contribution of cortical dynein to spindle positioning. HeLa cells normally divide to generate daughter cells of equivalent sizes (Figure 3A, left). In contrast, codepletion of LGN and 4.1G/R resulted in unequal-sized daughter cells for a subset of cell divisions (Figure 3A, right). To quantify such unequal-sized cell divisions, we measured the ratio (R) of the areas of the two daughter cells (large [L] and small [S]) in control cells, LGN or 4.1G/R individually depleted cells, or LGN and 4.1G/R codepleted cells (Figure 3B). We found that R had an average value of 1.1 in control cells (Figures 3B and S3A), corresponding to equivalently sized daughter cells. In LGN or 4.1G/R individual depletions, daughter-cell size was subtly affected (Figures 3B, 3C, and S3A). In contrast, LGN and 4.1G/R codepleted cells displayed highly unequal-sized cell divisions, with 11.9% of cell divisions having an R > 1.5, a value that was never observed in control cells (Figures 3A–C and S3A). The amount of DNA in each cell, as visualized by mCherry-histone H2B fluorescence, was similar among these unequal-sized daughters (Figure 3A), indicating that sister chromosome segregation was not affected. Importantly, this unequal-sized cell division in the LGN and 4.1 codepleted cells was rescued by artificial targeting of the 4.1G-CTD to the membrane (Figures 3B, 3C, S3A, and S3B), or by expression of small interfering RNA (siRNA)-resistant full-length 4.1G or LGN, but not 4.1GΔCTD (Figures S3C and S3D). These results suggest that cortical dynein is critical for equal-sized cell division in symmetrically dividing human cells.Figure S3Measurement of Daughter-Cell Size Ratio in LGN and 4.1G/R Codepleted Cells, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Table showing a summary of the cell size measurement statistics in control cells and indicated depletions and rescue conditions.

To analyze the effects of the unequal-sized cell divisions, we followed the behavior of the “larger” and “smaller” daughter cells in synchronized cultures (Figure 3D). Larger daughter cells (labeled as L) always entered the next mitosis earlier than smaller cells (S, n = 13; average duration = 24.5 hr) and also earlier than normal “medium”-sized daughters (M; average duration = 30.8 hr) resulting from a typical equal-sized cell division (Figure 3E). Larger cell size may reduce the G1 phase for cell growth in HeLa cells and result in earlier entry into the next mitosis, similar to what is observed in yeast (Jorgensen and Tyers, 2004Jorgensen P. Tyers M. How cells coordinate growth and division.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R1014-R1027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). All smaller-sized cells showed a cell-cycle delay and 15% of the smaller cells underwent an apoptotic-like cell death during the period observed (Figure 3D), suggesting that vertebrate cells may have a minimal cell-size threshold for survival. These results suggest that cortical dynein functions during anaphase to ensure equal-sized cell division, and that the failure to generate proper cell-size symmetry alters cell-cycle progression in daughter"
https://openalex.org/W2137802747,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) often forms stacked membrane sheets, an arrangement that is likely required to accommodate a maximum of membrane-bound polysomes for secretory protein synthesis. How sheets are stacked is unknown. Here, we used improved staining and automated ultrathin sectioning electron microscopy methods to analyze stacked ER sheets in neuronal cells and secretory salivary gland cells of mice. Our results show that stacked ER sheets form a continuous membrane system in which the sheets are connected by twisted membrane surfaces with helical edges of left- or right-handedness. The three-dimensional structure of tightly stacked ER sheets resembles a parking garage, in which the different levels are connected by helicoidal ramps. A theoretical model explains the experimental observations and indicates that the structure corresponds to a minimum of elastic energy of sheet edges and surfaces. The structure allows the dense packing of ER sheets in the restricted space of a cell."
https://openalex.org/W1991864822,"Autophagy is a process of cellular self-digestion induced by various forms of starvation. Although nitrogen deficit is a common trigger, some yeast cells induce autophagy upon switch from a rich to minimal media without nitrogen starvation. We show that the amino acid methionine is sufficient to inhibit such non-nitrogen-starvation (NNS)-induced autophagy. Methionine boosts synthesis of the methyl donor, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). SAM inhibits autophagy and promotes growth through the action of the methyltransferase Ppm1p, which modifies the catalytic subunit of PP2A in tune with SAM levels. Methylated PP2A promotes dephosphorylation of Npr2p, a component of a conserved complex that regulates NNS autophagy and other growth-related processes. Thus, methionine and SAM levels represent a critical gauge of amino acid availability that is sensed via the methylation of PP2A to reciprocally regulate cell growth and autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2115430241,"Protein translation is an energetically demanding process that must be regulated in response to changes in nutrient availability. Herein, we report that intracellular methionine and cysteine availability directly controls the thiolation status of wobble-uridine (U34) nucleotides present on lysine, glutamine, or glutamate tRNAs to regulate cellular translational capacity and metabolic homeostasis. tRNA thiolation is important for growth under nutritionally challenging environments and required for efficient translation of genes enriched in lysine, glutamine, and glutamate codons, which are enriched in proteins important for translation and growth-specific processes. tRNA thiolation is downregulated during sulfur starvation in order to decrease sulfur consumption and growth, and its absence leads to a compensatory increase in enzymes involved in methionine, cysteine, and lysine biosynthesis. Thus, tRNA thiolation enables cells to modulate translational capacity according to the availability of sulfur amino acids, establishing a functional significance for this conserved tRNA nucleotide modification in cell growth control."
https://openalex.org/W2158180844,"When fruits ripen, microbial communities start a fierce competition for the freely available fruit sugars. Three yeast lineages, including baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have independently developed the metabolic activity to convert simple sugars into ethanol even under fully aerobic conditions. This fermentation capacity, named Crabtree effect, reduces the cell-biomass production but provides in nature a tool to out-compete other microorganisms. Here, we analyzed over forty Saccharomycetaceae yeasts, covering over 200 million years of the evolutionary history, for their carbon metabolism. The experiments were done under strictly controlled and uniform conditions, which has not been done before. We show that the origin of Crabtree effect in Saccharomycetaceae predates the whole genome duplication and became a settled metabolic trait after the split of the S. cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces lineages, and coincided with the origin of modern fruit bearing plants. Our results suggest that ethanol fermentation evolved progressively, involving several successive molecular events that have gradually remodeled the yeast carbon metabolism. While some of the final evolutionary events, like gene duplications of glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes, have been deduced, the earliest molecular events initiating Crabtree effect are still to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2016148607,"The H3K4me3 mark in chromatin is closely correlated with actively transcribed genes, although the mechanisms involved in its generation and function are not fully understood. In vitro studies with recombinant chromatin and purified human factors demonstrate a robust SET1 complex (SET1C)-mediated H3K4 trimethylation that is dependent upon p53- and p300-mediated H3 acetylation, a corresponding SET1C-mediated enhancement of p53- and p300-dependent transcription that reflects a primary effect of SET1C through H3K4 trimethylation, and direct SET1C-p53 and SET1C-p300 interactions indicative of a targeted recruitment mechanism. Complementary cell-based assays demonstrate a DNA-damage-induced p53-SET1C interaction, a corresponding enrichment of SET1C and H3K4me3 on a p53 target gene (p21/WAF1), and a corresponding codependency of H3K4 trimethylation and transcription upon p300 and SET1C. These results establish a mechanism in which SET1C and p300 act cooperatively, through direct interactions and coupled histone modifications, to facilitate the function of p53."
https://openalex.org/W2149131800,"Background Whether non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are diseases of poverty or affluence in low-and-middle income countries has been vigorously debated. Most analyses of NCDs have used self-reported data, which is biased by differential access to healthcare services between groups of different socioeconomic status (SES). We sought to compare self-reported diagnoses versus standardised measures of NCD prevalence across SES groups in India. Methods We calculated age-adjusted prevalence rates of common NCDs from the Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health, a nationally representative cross-sectional survey. We compared self-reported diagnoses to standardized measures of disease for five NCDs. We calculated wealth-related and education-related disparities in NCD prevalence by calculating concentration index (C), which ranges from −1 to +1 (concentration of disease among lower and higher SES groups, respectively). Findings NCD prevalence was higher (range 5.2 to 19.1%) for standardised measures than self-reported diagnoses (range 3.1 to 9.4%). Several NCDs were particularly concentrated among higher SES groups according to self-reported diagnoses (Csrd) but were concentrated either among lower SES groups or showed no strong socioeconomic gradient using standardized measures (Csm): age-standardised wealth-related C: angina Csrd 0.02 vs. Csm −0.17; asthma and lung diseases Csrd −0.05 vs. Csm −0.04 (age-standardised education-related Csrd 0.04 vs. Csm −0.05); vision problems Csrd 0.07 vs. Csm −0.05; depression Csrd 0.07 vs. Csm −0.13. Indicating similar trends of standardized measures detecting more cases among low SES, concentration of hypertension declined among higher SES (Csrd 0.19 vs. Csm 0.03). Conclusions The socio-economic patterning of NCD prevalence differs markedly when assessed by standardized criteria versus self-reported diagnoses. NCDs in India are not necessarily diseases of affluence but also of poverty, indicating likely under-diagnosis and under-reporting of diseases among the poor. Standardized measures should be used, wherever feasible, to estimate the true prevalence of NCDs."
https://openalex.org/W2077030210,"The molecular mechanisms regulating olfactory receptor (OR) expression in the mammalian nose are not yet understood. Here, we identify the transient expression of histone demethylase LSD1 and the OR-dependent expression of adenylyl cyclase 3 (Adcy3) as requirements for initiation and stabilization of OR expression. As a transcriptional coactivator, LSD1 is necessary for desilencing and initiating OR transcription, but as a transcriptional corepressor, it is incompatible with maintenance of OR expression, and its downregulation is imperative for stable OR choice. Adcy3, a sensor of OR expression and a transmitter of an OR-elicited feedback, mediates the downregulation of LSD1 and promotes the differentiation of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). This novel, three-node signaling cascade locks the epigenetic state of the chosen OR, stabilizes its singular expression, and prevents the transcriptional activation of additional OR alleles for the life of the neuron."
https://openalex.org/W2030112765,"Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) induce positive effects in plants, such as increased growth or reduced stress susceptibility. The mechanisms behind PGPR/plant interaction are poorly understood, as most studies have described short-term responses on plants and only a few studies have analyzed plant molecular responses under PGPR colonization. Here, we studied the effects of the PGPR bacterial model Burkholderia phytofirmans PsJN on the whole life cycle of Arabidopsis thaliana plants. We reported that at different plant developmental points, strain PsJN can be found in the rhizosphere and also colonizing their internal tissues. In early ontogeny, strain PsJN increased several growth parameters and accelerated growth rate of the plants. Also, an Arabidopsis transcriptome analysis revealed that 408 genes showed differential expression in PsJN-inoculated plants; some of these genes are involved in stress response and hormone pathways. Specifically, genes implicated in auxin and gibberellin pathways were induced. Quantitative transcriptional analyses of selected genes in different developmental stages revealed that the beginning of these changes could be evidenced early in development, especially among the down-regulated genes. The inoculation with heat-killed bacteria provoked a more severe transcriptional response in plants, but was not able to induce plant growth-promotion. Later in ontogeny, the growth rates of inoculated plants decreased with respect to the non-inoculated group and, interestingly, the inoculation accelerated the flowering time and the appearance of senescence signs in plants; these modifications correlate with the early up-regulation of flowering control genes. Then, we show that a single inoculation with a PGPR could affect the whole life cycle of a plant, accelerating its growth rate and shortening its vegetative period, both effects relevant for most crops. Thus, these findings provide novel and interesting aspects of these relevant biological interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2089248474,"Error-free cell division depends on the assembly of the spindle midzone, a specialized array of overlapping microtubules that emerges between segregating chromosomes during anaphase. The molecular mechanisms by which a subset of dynamic microtubules from the metaphase spindle are selected and organized into a stable midzone array are poorly understood. Here, we show using in vitro reconstitution assays that PRC1 and kinesin-4, two microtubule-associated proteins required for midzone assembly, can tag microtubule plus ends. Remarkably, the size of these tags is proportional to filament length. We determine the crystal structure of the PRC1 homodimer and map the protein-protein interactions needed for tagging microtubule ends. Importantly, length-dependent microtubule plus-end-tagging by PRC1 is also observed in dividing cells. Our findings suggest how biochemically similar microtubules can be differentially marked, based on length, for selective regulation during the formation of specialized arrays, such as those required for cytokinesis."
https://openalex.org/W2032586069,"The microenvironment provides cues that control the behavior of epithelial stem and progenitor cells. Here, we identify matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3) as a regulator of Wnt signaling and mammary stem cell (MaSC) activity. We show that MMP3 overexpression promotes hyperplastic epithelial growth, surprisingly, in a nonproteolytic manner via its hemopexin (HPX) domain. We demonstrate that MMP3-HPX specifically binds and inactivates Wnt5b, a noncanonical Wnt ligand that inhibits canonical Wnt signaling and mammary epithelial outgrowth in vivo. Indeed, transplants overexpressing MMP3 display increased canonical Wnt signaling, demonstrating that MMP3 is an extracellular regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. MMP3-deficient mice exhibit decreased MaSC populations and diminished mammary-reconstituting activity, whereas MMP3 overexpression elevates MaSC function, indicating that MMP3 is necessary for the maintenance of MaSCs. Our study reveals a mechanism by a microenvironmental protease that regulates Wnt signaling and impacts adult epithelial stem cell function."
https://openalex.org/W2075322231,"Mucin glycoproteins are secreted in large quantities by mucosal epithelia and cell surface mucins are a prominent feature of the glycocalyx of all mucosal epithelia. Currently, studies investigating the gastrointestinal mucosal barrier use either animal experiments or non-in vivo like cell cultures. Many pathogens cause different pathology in mice compared to humans and the in vitro cell cultures used are suboptimal because they are very different from an in vivo mucosal surface, are often not polarized, lack important components of the glycocalyx, and often lack the mucus layer. Although gastrointestinal cell lines exist that produce mucins or polarize, human cell line models that reproducibly create the combination of a polarized epithelial cell layer, functional tight junctions and an adherent mucus layer have been missing until now. We trialed a range of treatments to induce polarization, 3D-organization, tight junctions, mucin production, mucus secretion, and formation of an adherent mucus layer that can be carried out using standard equipment. These treatments were tested on cell lines of intestinal (Caco-2, LS513, HT29, T84, LS174T, HT29 MTX-P8 and HT29 MTX-E12) and gastric (MKN7, MKN45, AGS, NCI-N87 and its hTERT Clone5 and Clone6) origins using Ussing chamber methodology and (immuno)histology. Semi-wet interface culture in combination with mechanical stimulation and DAPT caused HT29 MTX-P8, HT29 MTX-E12 and LS513 cells to polarize, form functional tight junctions, a three-dimensional architecture resembling colonic crypts, and produce an adherent mucus layer. Caco-2 and T84 cells also polarized, formed functional tight junctions and produced a thin adherent mucus layer after this treatment, but with less consistency. In conclusion, culture methods affect cell lines differently, and testing a matrix of methods vs. cell lines may be important to develop better in vitro models. The methods developed herein create in vitro mucosal surfaces suitable for studies of host-pathogen interactions at the mucosal surface."
https://openalex.org/W2006433225,"Interleukin-10 (IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are key anti- and pro-inflammatory mediators elicited during the host immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Understanding the opposing effects of these mediators is difficult due to the complexity of processes acting across different spatial (molecular, cellular, and tissue) and temporal (seconds to years) scales. We take an in silico approach and use multi-scale agent based modeling of the immune response to Mtb, including molecular scale details for both TNF-α and IL-10. Our model predicts that IL-10 is necessary to modulate macrophage activation levels and to prevent host-induced tissue damage in a granuloma, an aggregate of cells that forms in response to Mtb. We show that TNF-α and IL-10 parameters related to synthesis, signaling, and spatial distribution processes control concentrations of TNF-α and IL-10 in a granuloma and determine infection outcome in the long-term. We devise an overall measure of granuloma function based on three metrics - total bacterial load, macrophage activation levels, and apoptosis of resting macrophages - and use this metric to demonstrate a balance of TNF-α and IL-10 concentrations is essential to Mtb infection control, within a single granuloma, with minimal host-induced tissue damage. Our findings suggest that a balance of TNF-α and IL-10 defines a granuloma environment that may be beneficial for both host and pathogen, but perturbing the balance could be used as a novel therapeutic strategy to modulate infection outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2070286070,"Berberine (BBR), an isoquinoline derivative alkaloid isolated from Chinese herbs, has a long history of uses for the treatment of multiple diseases, including cancers. However, the precise mechanisms of actions of BBR in human lung cancer cells remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which BBR inhibits cell growth in human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Treatment with BBR promoted cell morphology change, inhibited cell migration, proliferation and colony formation, and induced cell apoptosis. Further molecular mechanism study showed that BBR simultaneously targeted multiple cell signaling pathways to inhibit NSCLC cell growth. Treatment with BBR inhibited AP-2α and AP-2β expression and abrogated their binding on hTERT promoters, thereby inhibiting hTERT expression. Knockdown of AP-2α and AP-2β by siRNA considerably augmented the BBR-mediated inhibition of cell growth. BBR also suppressed the nuclear translocation of p50/p65 NF-κB proteins and their binding to COX-2 promoter, causing inhibition of COX-2. BBR also downregulated HIF-1α and VEGF expression and inhibited Akt and ERK phosphorylation. Knockdown of HIF-1α by siRNA considerably augmented the BBR-mediated inhibition of cell growth. Moreover, BBR treatment triggered cytochrome-c release from mitochondrial inter-membrane space into cytosol, promoted cleavage of caspase and PARP, and affected expression of BAX and Bcl-2, thereby activating apoptotic pathway. Taken together, these results demonstrated that BBR inhibited NSCLC cell growth by simultaneously targeting AP-2/hTERT, NF-κB/COX-2, HIF-1α/VEGF, PI3K/AKT, Raf/MEK/ERK and cytochrome-c/caspase signaling pathways. Our findings provide new insights into understanding the anticancer mechanisms of BBR in human lung cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1971904355,"Chemokine-mediated directed tumor cell migration within a three dimensional (3D) matrix, or chemoinvasion, is an important early step in cancer metastasis. Despite its clinical importance, it is largely unknown how cytokine and growth factor gradients within the tumor microenvironment regulate chemoinvasion. We studied tumor cell chemoinvasion in well-defined and stable chemical gradients using a robust 3D microfluidic model. We used CXCL12 (also known as SDF-1α) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), two well-known extracellular signaling molecules that co-exist in the tumor microenvironment (e.g. lymph nodes or intravasation sites), and a malignant breast tumor cell line, MDA-MB-231, embedded in type I collagen. When subjected to SDF-1α gradients alone, MDA-MB-231 cells migrated up the gradient, and the measured chemosensitivity (defined as the average cell velocity along the direction of the gradient) followed the ligand - receptor (SDF-1α - CXCR4) binding kinetics. On the other hand, when subjected to EGF gradients alone, tumor cells increased their overall motility, but without statistically significant chemotactic (directed) migration, in contrast to previous reports using 2D chemotaxis assays. Interestingly, we found that the chemoinvasive behavior to SDF-1α gradients was abrogated or even reversed in the presence of uniform concentrations of EGF; however, the presence of SDF-1α and EGF together modulated tumor cell motility cooperatively. These findings demonstrate the capabilities of our microfluidic model in re-creating complex microenvironments for cells, and the importance of cooperative roles of multiple cytokine and growth factor gradients in regulating cell migration in 3D environments."
https://openalex.org/W1973357385,"Tobacco smoking is a well-known risk factor for subsequent alcohol abuse, but the neural events underlying this risk remain largely unknown. Alcohol and nicotine reinforcement involve common neural circuitry, including the mesolimbic dopamine system. We demonstrate in rodents that pre-exposure to nicotine increases alcohol self-administration and decreases alcohol-induced dopamine responses. The blunted dopamine response was due to increased inhibitory synaptic transmission onto dopamine neurons. Blocking stress hormone receptors prior to nicotine exposure prevented all interactions with alcohol that we measured, including the increased inhibition onto dopamine neurons, the decreased dopamine responses, and the increased alcohol self-administration. These results indicate that nicotine recruits neuroendocrine systems to influence neurotransmission and behavior associated with alcohol reinforcement."
https://openalex.org/W2089330719,"Soil-transmitted helminths are parasitic nematodes that inhabit the human intestine. These parasites, which include two hookworm species, Ancylostomaduodenale and Necator americanus, the whipworm Trichuristrichiura, and the large roundworm Ascarislumbricoides, infect upwards of two billion people and are a major cause of disease burden in children and pregnant women. The challenge with treating these diseases is that poverty, safety, and inefficient public health policy have marginalized drug development and distribution to control infection in humans. Anthelmintics (anti-worm drugs) have historically been developed and tested for treatment of non-human parasitic nematodes that infect livestock and companion animals. Here we systematically compare the in vitro efficacy of all major anthelmintic classes currently used in human therapy (benzimidazoles, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists, macrocyclic lactones, nitazoxanide) against species closely related to human parasitic nematodes-Ancylostoma ceylanicum, Trichurismuris, and Ascarissuum--- as well as a rodent parasitic nematode used in veterinary drug discovery, Heligmosomoidesbakeri, and the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Extensive in vitro data is complemented with single-dose in vivo data in three rodent models of parasitic diseases. We find that the effects of the drugs in vitro and in vivo can vary greatly among these nematode species, e.g., the efficacy of albendazole is strong on A. ceylanicum but weak on H. bakeri. Nonetheless, certain commonalities of the in vitro effects of the drugs can be seen, e.g., nitazoxanide consistently shows an all-or-nothing response. Our in vitro data suggest that further optimization of the clinical efficacy of some of these anthelmintics could be achieved by altering the treatment routine and/or dosing. Most importantly, our in vitro and in vivo data indicate that the hookworm A. ceylanicum is a particularly sensitive and useful model for anthelmintic studies and should be incorporated early on in drug screens for broad-spectrum human soil-transmitted helminth therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2034798418,"Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common movement disorders in human adults. It can be characterized as a progressive neurological disorder of which the most recognizable feature is a tremor of the arms or hands that is apparent during voluntary movements such as eating and writing. The pathology of ET remains unclear. Resting-state fMRI (RS-fMRI), as a non-invasive imaging technique, was employed to investigate abnormalities of functional connectivity in ET in the brain. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) was used as a metric of RS-fMRI to assess the local functional connectivity abnormality in ET with 20 ET patients and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC). The ET group showed decreased ReHo in the anterior and posterior bilateral cerebellar lobes, the bilateral thalamus and the insular lobe, and increased ReHo in the bilateral prefrontal and parietal cortices, the left primary motor cortex and left supplementary motor area. The abnormal ReHo value of ET patients in the bilateral anterior cerebellar lobes and the right posterior cerebellar lobe were negatively correlated with the tremor severity score, while positively correlated with that in the left primary motor cortex. These findings suggest that the abnormality in cerebello-thalamo-cortical motor pathway is involved in tremor generation and propagation, which may be related to motor-related symptoms in ET patients. Meanwhile, the abnormality in the prefrontal and parietal regions may be associated with non-motor symptoms in ET. These findings suggest that the ReHo could be utilized for investigations of functional-pathological mechanism of ET."
https://openalex.org/W2033966057,"Synaptic contacts are largely established during embryogenesis and are then maintained during growth. To identify molecules involved in this process, we conducted a forward genetic screen in C. elegans and identified cima-1. In cima-1 mutants, synaptic contacts are correctly established during embryogenesis, but ectopic synapses emerge during postdevelopmental growth. cima-1 encodes a solute carrier in the SLC17 family of transporters that includes sialin, a protein that when mutated in humans results in neurological disorders. cima-1 does not function in neurons but rather functions in the nearby epidermal cells to correctly position glia during postlarval growth. Our findings indicate that CIMA-1 antagonizes the FGF receptor (FGFR), and does so most likely by inhibiting FGFR’s role in epidermal-glia adhesion rather than signaling. Our data suggest that epidermal-glia crosstalk, in this case mediated by a transporter and the FGF receptor, is vital to preserve embryonically derived circuit architecture during postdevelopmental growth.PaperFlickeyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIzYWRhMTQzMzRmYTY1Zjc2YzRmMmNmODdjNmY4MDRmYSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4MTMwNDE0fQ.E2iV0S1H9KNK1dsfGuGRAND-cO-KhVjcZO-kEHU1IEb4gL8BTQInvJgp0S7kGqMxtpB2r8abrN4kSYwlq2SW-eV_LILZC4BLpbw9qa2y9FHVTr__JKgCQ_H5vPlC0uPROdeRq0JM_T1Gj1b76E02NKTltrzm_PUs3Lq-9hgdUMQqZ_gyysPHUAST1nolAQiCYb-ZlFtvq_UtMP0aF6t5zDIfG_9yKv19qgZrS8Jgv5zE8ZOHZDVoPmb0KpUtox6hp5xa3pxjcuj8JfZJ7We1HmL6oE8KhvmqSbHI_y4sLu5VR7qXi_mW2ria46Cy2KR6umBaKy-8Az2dio-iUjgcnQ(mp4, (61.95 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2050781713,"Malignant glioma is the most common type of primary brain tumor in adults, characterized by rapid tumor growth and infiltration of tumor cells throughout the brain. Alterations in the activity of the 26S proteasome have been associated with malignant glioma cells, although the specific defects have not been identified. Recently, microRNA-326 (miR-326) was shown to play an important role in glioblastoma and breast cancer, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, the human Nin one binding protein (NOB1) was identified as a direct target of miR-326 and a potential oncogene in human glioma. Similar to NOB1 silencing by shRNA, overexpression of miR-326 in human glioma cell lines (A172 and U373) caused cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase, delayed cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis. MiR-326 inhibited colony formation in soft agar and decreased growth of a xenograft tumor model, suggesting that miR-326 and NOB1 are required for tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, these processes were shown to involve the MAPK pathway. NOB1 overexpression in human glioma samples was detected by Affymetrix array analysis, and NOB1 mRNA and protein levels were shown to be increased in high-grade glioma compared to low-grade glioma and normal brain tissue. Furthermore, high levels of NOB1 were associated with unfavorable prognosis of glioma patients. Taken together, these results indicate that miR-326 and NOB1 may play an important role in the development of glioma."
https://openalex.org/W2082332913,"While the TRAIL pathway represents a promising therapeutic target in melanoma, resistance to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis remains a barrier to its successful adoption. Since the Wnt/β-catenin pathway has been implicated in facilitating melanoma cell apoptosis, we investigated the effect of Wnt/β-catenin signaling on regulating the responses of melanoma cells to TRAIL. Co-treatment of melanoma cell lines with WNT3A-conditioned media and recombinant TRAIL significantly enhanced apoptosis compared to treatment with TRAIL alone. This apoptosis correlates with increased abundance of the pro-apoptotic proteins BCL2L11 and BBC3, and with decreased abundance of the anti-apoptotic regulator Mcl1. We then confirmed the involvement of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by demonstrating that siRNA-mediated knockdown of an intracellular β-catenin antagonist, AXIN1, or treating cells with an inhibitor of GSK-3 also enhanced melanoma cell sensitivity to TRAIL. These studies describe a novel regulation of TRAIL sensitivity in melanoma by Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and suggest that strategies to enhance Wnt/β-catenin signaling in combination with TRAIL agonists warrant further investigation."

Based on the positive or negative blood culture reports they were classified as infected (n=50) and non-infected (n=50) neonates respectively. Fifty healthy neonates without any signs of sepsis were also included in the study as control group. The initial blood sample was taken on day 0 (at the time of sepsis evaluation) and two further samples were taken on days 1 and 2 for monitoring the clinical progress and response to treatment. In the control group the cord blood and 48 hours venous sample was collected. Plasma CRP (ng/ml), IL-6 (pg/ml), IL-8 (pg/ml), TNF-α (ng/ml) and sCD163 (ng/ml) were determined by double antibody method Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay in all the three blood samples.The cut of levels for CRP at >19,689 ng/ml had a sensitivity of 68%, specificity of 92%, for IL-6 at >95.32 pg/ml had a sensitivity of 54%, specificity of 96%, for IL-8 at >70.86 pg/ml had a sensitivity of 78%, specificity of 70%, for sCD163 at >896.78 ng/ml had a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 88% for the diagnosis of infection before antibiotics. TNF-α levels of >12.6 ng/ml showed 100% sensitivity and 72% specificity for the diagnosis of inflammation.The most powerful predictor to differentiate between the non-infected and infected neonates before antibiotics was sCD163. The most powerful indicator for evaluation of prognosis is IL-6. sCD163 can be used alone to screen for sepsis in neonates before the results of blood culture are received."

Here, we have functionally characterized two tandemly encoded S. meliloti Rm1021 sRNAs that are similar in sequence and structure. Homologous sRNAs (designated AbcR1 and AbcR2) have been shown to regulate several ABC transporters in the related α-proteobacteria Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Brucella abortus. In Rm1021, AbcR1 and AbcR2 exhibit divergent unlinked regulation and are stabilized by the RNA chaperone Hfq. AbcR1 is transcribed in actively dividing bacteria, either in culture, rhizosphere or within the invasion zone of mature alfalfa nodules. Conversely, AbcR2 expression is induced upon entry into stationary phase and under abiotic stress. Only deletion of AbcR1 resulted into a discrete growth delay in rich medium, but both are dispensable for symbiosis. Periplasmic proteome profiling revealed down-regulation of the branched-chain amino acid binding protein LivK by AbcR1, but not by AbcR2. A double-plasmid reporter assay confirmed the predicted specific targeting of the 5′-untranslated region of the livK mRNA by AbcR1 in vivo. Our findings provide evidences of independent regulatory functions of these sRNAs, probably to fine-tune nutrient uptake in free-living and undifferentiated symbiotic rhizobia."

We demonstrate that the classical cadherin, N-cadherin, and an atypical cadherin, Flamingo, act redundantly to instruct the targeting choices made by every photoreceptor axon.

We demonstrate that these molecules are localized to distinct subcellular domains and create a network of adhesive interactions distributed across many growth cones. Because this network comprises multiple redundant interactions, a complex wiring diagram can be constructed with extraordinary fidelity, suggesting a general principle. The directed extension of an axon toward its synaptic partner represents a critical step in establishing the complex wiring diagram of the brain. A wealth of cellular interactions, including adhesive signals between an axon and its correct target and repulsive signals from inappropriate partners, as well as interactions among afferent axons, play important roles (Luo and Flanagan, 2007Luo L. Flanagan J.G. Development of continuous and discrete neural maps.Neuron. 2007; 56: 284-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, how these interactions change growth cone morphology to direct axon extension toward specific targets remains unknown. Growth cones are the sensory structures of the advancing axon. They form motile actin-rich protrusions, filopodia and lamellipodia, which probe the environment for guidance signals (Bentley and Toroian-Raymond, 1986Bentley D. Toroian-Raymond A.

The effects of guidance and adhesive factors on growth cone shape and axon extension have been intensely studied in vitro (Vitriol and Zheng, 2012Vitriol E.A. Zheng J.Q.

Adhesion molecules propel growth cones by crosslinking the substrate with the actin cytoskeleton to increase traction, ultimately promoting formation of protrusions and growth cone advance (Bard et al., 2008Bard L.

However, little is known about how growth cones navigate the more complex environments encountered in vivo. Previous work correlated in vivo growth cone shape with axon extension, revealing that simple, highly polarized growth cones advance rapidly, whereas complex, less-polarized growth cones frequently pause (Mason and Wang, 1997Mason C.A. Wang L.C. Growth cone form is behavior-specific and, consequently, position-specific along the retinal axon pathway.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1086-1100PubMed Google Scholar). However, how adhesion molecules might regulate these polarity changes remains incompletely understood, and it is unknown whether growth cone polarity can determine target specificity. To address these issues, we studied photoreceptor (R cell) axon targeting in the Drosophila visual system (Hadjieconomou et al., 2011Hadjieconomou D. Timofeev K. Salecker I. A step-by-step guide to visual circuit assembly in Drosophila.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2011; 21: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The compound eye of the fruit fly comprises ∼800 facets, called ommatidia, each of which contains eight photoreceptors (R1–R8). Due to the curvature of the eye and the arrangement of light-sensing organs, each of the outer six R cells (R1–R6) within a single ommatidium receives light from a different point in space and must therefore connect to a different target column in the brain. At the same time, specific groups of R1–R6 cells distributed among neighboring ommatidia receive light from the same point in space and converge on the same target column (Figure 1A). This wiring principle is called neural superposition and results in the formation of a retinotopic map (Clandinin and Zipursky, 2000Clandinin T.R. Zipursky S.L. Afferent growth cone interactions control synaptic specificity in the Drosophila visual system.Neuron. 2000; 28: 427-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Ultrastructural and genetic studies have provided insight into the mechanisms that direct R1–R6 axons to their targets (Hadjieconomou et al., 2011Hadjieconomou D. Timofeev K. Salecker I.

Hanson T.E. The development of the optic lobe.in: Bate M. Martinez A.A. The Development of Drosophila melanogaster. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1993: 1363-1491Google Scholar). R cell axons from each ommatidium are bundled together in a fascicle as they extend into the brain, following the path of the R8 axon. Upon reaching the lamina, R1–R6 axons defasciculate, and each extends a lateral process that innervates a single column of five postsynaptic targets, the lamina monopolar cells (LMCs; Figure 1Ai). All R cells that “see the same point in visual space” innervate the same target column and assemble a fascicle, called a cartridge, which contains both R cell axons and LMC dendrites. Remarkably, all targeting steps occur within a highly patterned structure where every growth cone is precisely positioned with respect to its neighbors (Meinertzhagen and Hanson, 1993Meinertzhagen I.A.

Furthermore, R-cell-targeting specificity is genetically hardwired (Hiesinger et al., 2006Hiesinger P.R. Zhai R.G. Zhou Y. Koh T.W. Mehta S.Q. Schulze K.L. Cao Y. Verstreken P. Clandinin T.R.

Biol. 2006; 16: 1835-1843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and it is instructed by interactions among afferent R cell axons, whereas target-derived cues are largely permissive (Clandinin and Zipursky, 2000Clandinin T.R.

Afferent growth cone interactions control synaptic specificity in the Drosophila visual system.Neuron. 2000; 28: 427-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The classical cadherin N-cadherin (Ncad), the receptor tyrosine phosphatase LAR, and the adaptor protein Liprin-α are critically involved in the extension of R cell growth cones toward their target column (Choe et al., 2006Choe K.M.

Ncad is expressed both in R cells and LMCs and mediates interactions between these two cell types; R cells that lack Ncad, LAR, or Liprin-α frequently fail to extend. In contrast, the atypical cadherin Flamingo (Fmi), together with its partner Golden Goal, regulates target choice by mediating interactions among R cell axons (Chen and Clandinin, 2008Chen P.L.

The transmembrane protein Golden goal regulates R8 photoreceptor axon-axon and axon-target interactions.Neuron. 2008; 57: 691-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, whereas removal of fmi from all R cells results in highly penetrant targeting phenotypes, loss of fmi in single R cells has only negligible effects, suggesting that at least one redundant pathway must exist (Chen and Clandinin, 2008Chen P.L. Clandinin T.R.

Neurosci. 2003; 6: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Here, we provide insight into the mechanisms by which R1–R6 cell axons find their targets using cadherin-mediated interactions. Our results demonstrate that a network of interactions between multiple partners provides redundant cues to orient growth cones. Invertebrate nervous systems can display tremendous wiring precision. Microscopic reconstruction of the lamina of the Dipteran fly Calliphora failed to detect any targeting errors made by 650 photoreceptor axons (Horridge and Meinertzhagen, 1970Horridge G.A. Meinertzhagen I.A. The accuracy of the patterns of connexions of the first- and second-order neurons of the visual system of Calliphora.Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1970; 175: 69-82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To measure targeting fidelity in Drosophila, we stained adult brains of three wild-type strains with the synaptic marker Cysteine String Protein 2a (Csp2a), which specifically labels R cell terminals in the lamina (Zinsmaier et al., 1990Zinsmaier K.E. Hofbauer A. Heimbeck G. Pflugfelder G.O. Buchner S. Buchner E. A cysteine-string protein is expressed in retina and brain of Drosophila.J. Neurogenet. 1990; 7: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Excluding equatorial and peripheral regions, if all R cells differentiate normally and target correctly, all cartridges should contain exactly six profiles. If one R cell fails to differentiate, or dies, a single cartridge will have five terminals, whereas all of its neighbors will have six. In total, we observed 20 errors of this type in 3,945 cartridges. In addition, there are two categories of true targeting errors that can be distinguished. First, if one axon innervates an incorrect target, one cartridge will contain seven terminals, whereas a neighbor will contain five. Second, if an axon innervates two targets, one cartridge will contain seven terminals, whereas all neighbors will contain six (Figure 1B). Across the three wild-type strains, we observed only nine targeting errors in 3,945 cartridges scored, corresponding to an average error rate of only 1 in 2,630 terminals (99.96% fidelity; Figure 1Bii). Because each retina comprises ∼4,800 R1–R6 axons, this corresponds to fewer than two targeting errors per eye. Thus, the mechanisms that regulate R cell targeting must be very robust. To identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms that guide R cell targeting, we first examined the development of R cell growth cone morphology. After reaching the lamina, during late larval and early pupal development, R1–R6 growth cones expand laterally, with R cells from within a bundle forming an open “ring-like” configuration (Figure 1C). Growth cones begin to extend to their targets around 32% after puparium formation (APF) and appear to have little contact with their postsynaptic partners prior to this time (Meinertzhagen and Hanson, 1993Meinertzhagen I.A. Hanson T.E. The development of the optic lobe.in: Bate M. Martinez A.A. The Development of Drosophila melanogaster. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1993: 1363-1491Google Scholar). To examine individual R cell growth cones, we genetically labeled R4 axons using mδ-Gal4-driven expression of myristoylated tdTomato (Chen and Clandinin, 2008Chen P.L. Clandinin T.R. The cadherin Flamingo mediates level-dependent interactions that guide photoreceptor target choice in Drosophila.Neuron. 2008; 58: 26-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, we stochastically labeled single growth cones with myristoylated GFP, assigning R cell identity based on the morphology and position of the cell body within the retina (see Extended Experimental Procedures). Before they extended, R4 growth cones were closely apposed to a specific, invariant set of neighbors, both from the same ommatidium (R3 and R5), as well as from neighboring ommatidia (R1, R2, and R6; Figure 1C; Meinertzhagen and Hanson, 1993Meinertzhagen I.A. Hanson T.E. The development of the optic lobe.in: Bate M. Martinez A.A. The Development of Drosophila melanogaster. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1993: 1363-1491Google Scholar). Analogous, precise neighbor relationships were seen for all other growth cones as well (data not shown). Thus, each R cell can engage in adhesive interactions with several specific neighbors. Furthermore, we found that all R4 growth cones were of similar shape, aligned in parallel, and oriented toward the future target column (Figure S1 available online). To understand how this polarity develops, we quantified the morphology of growth cones from the time they have expanded in the lamina, at the start of pupation, until they have extended toward their targets, around 33% APF (Figure 2A). Actin protrusions, such as filopodia and lamellipodia, are central to axon guidance (Bentley and Toroian-Raymond, 1986Bentley D. Toroian-Raymond A. Disoriented pathfinding by pioneer neurone growth cones deprived of filopodia by cytochalasin treatment.Nature. 1986; 323: 712-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, Chien et al., 1993Chien C.B.

Gordon-Weeks P.R. Cytoskeletal dynamics in growth-cone steering.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 3595-3604Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Furthermore, growth cones in vivo make more filopodial contact with their targets as compared to neighboring nontargets (Raper et al., 1983Raper J.A. Bastiani M.J. Goodman C.S. Guidance of neuronal growth cones: selective fasciculation in the grasshopper embryo.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1983; 48: 587-598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because R cell growth cones form no discernable lamellipodia, we used filopodial distribution as a measure of polarity (Figure 2B). Each filopodium was represented as a vector with a defined length and angle relative to a landmark (Figure 2Bi); from these, we calculated a mean polarity vector for each growth cone and each R cell subtype (see Extended Experimental Procedures). At the start of pupation (0% APF), R1 and R6 growth cones had not expanded, and the growth cones of R2–R5 were of uniform shape and projected filopodia in all directions, producing short mean vectors that reflect a lack of polarization (Figures 2A, 2Bii, and S2). However, at 20% APF, mean polarity vectors had increased in magnitude as growth cones began to orient toward their future targets. Polarity increased progressively until 33% APF, when growth cones extended. To relate growth cone polarity to target choice, we plotted the mean polarity angles at 28% and 33% APF, as well as the angles at which growth cones have extended at 40% APF (Figures 2C and S2). For R1, R3, R4, and R6, growth cone polarity and targeting angles almost completely overlapped. For R2 and R5, there was a consistent 30° difference between the polarity at 28% and extension angles at 40% APF, which decreased to around 10° by 33% APF (Figure 2C). We also plotted the angular size and position of all target cartridges, relative to the R cell bundle, and observed extensive overlap between R cell growth cone polarization and target position (Figure 2C). In addition, we observed an inverse relationship between the angular target size and the degree of R cell polarity, creating the following ranked order of polarization: R3 > R4 > R1 = R6 > R2 = R5. These observations suggest that R cell growth cones “preselect” their postsynaptic partners prior to interacting with them, through a process of directed polarization. We next sought molecules that mediate interactions between R cells and might direct growth cone polarization. The atypical cadherin Fmi was a strong candidate because its loss in all R cells results in severe targeting defects (Lee et al., 2003Lee R.C. Clandinin T.R. Lee C.H. Chen P.L. Meinertzhagen I.A. Zipursky S.L. The protocadherin Flamingo is required for axon target selection in the Drosophila visual system.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, when single cells are made mutant for fmi, they invariably target normally (Chen and Clandinin, 2008Chen P.L. Clandinin T.R. The cadherin Flamingo mediates level-dependent interactions that guide photoreceptor target choice in Drosophila.Neuron. 2008; 58: 26-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of additional adhesive factors. We therefore examined two cadherins expressed in R cell growth cones at this stage, namely Ncad and E-cadherin (Ecad; Lee et al., 2001Lee C.H. Herman T. Clandinin T.R. Lee R. Zipursky S.L. N-cadherin regulates target specificity in the Drosophila visual system.Neuron. 2001; 30: 437-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, Prakash et al., 2005Prakash S. Caldwell J.C. Eberl D.F. Clandinin T.R. Drosophila N-cadherin mediates an attractive interaction between photoreceptor axons and their targets.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 443-450PubMed Google Scholar), and probed whether these genes interact genetically with fmi. We took advantage of our ability to quantitatively measure the fidelity of axon targeting and generated a sensitized genetic background by expression of fmi RNAi using a late R cell driver (gmrFlp actin-FRT-y(+)-FRT-Gal4). In this background, Fmi levels were only moderately reduced (Figure S3), and the error rate of targeting was not significantly increased relative to controls (Figure 3A). Although knocking down Ecad in this background had no effect, codepletion of Ncad and Fmi resulted in an ∼10-fold increase in the fraction of R cells that made targeting errors (Figure 3A). These data raise the possibility that Ncad might serve two functions in R cell growth cones, mediating both interactions between R cells and their targets, as well as among R cell growth cones, where it could act redundantly with Fmi.Figure 3Fmi and Ncad Genetically Interact to Mediate R Cell Growth Cone ExtensionShow full caption(A) Single and double RNAi against fmi, Ncad, Ecad, and LAR under the control of gmr-Flp actin-FRT-y(+)-FRT-Gal4.

R1–R6 cells were pooled. All groups were significantly different from control with p < 0.001, or p < 0.05 for control versus fmi; Fisher’s exact test, adjusted for multiple comparisons (n = 71–123). (F) Single R6 growth cones at 38% APF labeled with CD8GFP (green), counterstained with mAb24B10 (magenta) to visualize cartridges. The wild-type R6 target cartridge is marked with a dotted white line. Shown are projected stacks of 3–5.5 μm of the dorsal lamina hemisphere, oriented with the equator down. Growth cones mutant for Ncad, for Ncad and fmi, as well as growth cones with elevated cadherin levels (2×) showed reduced or no target interactions. See also Figure S3 and Tables S1 and S2. Given this synergy between Ncad and Fmi, we first tested whether manipulating Ncad altered interactions among R cells, using reverse mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM) (Lee and Luo, 1999Lee T. Luo L. Mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker for studies of gene function in neuronal morphogenesis.Neuron. 1999; 22: 451-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). This experiment generated cells mutant for Ncad that were labeled by the absence of gmr:RFPmyr, whereas their homozygous wild-type sister cells were labeled by mCD8GFP and analyzed for targeting defects (Figure 3B). All other cells were heterozygous wild-type. Because clonally related R cells could be either sorted into the same ommatidium, a separate ommatidium, or die, a wild-type mCD8GFP-positive cell can be in an ommatidium containing only wild-type cells, it can sit directly next to a mutant cell, or it can be separated from the mutant cell by two or three wild-type cells. Surprisingly, targeting defects were both very infrequent and independent of the presence or position of an Ncad mutant cell (Figure 3B). Because analogous experiments performed with Fmi did reveal targeting phenotypes (Chen and Clandinin, 2008Chen P.L. Clandinin T.R.

Weight change during radiation treatment was categorized into high weight loss (HWL) and low weight loss (LWL). The associations of HWL with overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were analyzed by Cox regression.Among underweight patients, HWL was independently associated with poor OS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.06; 95% CI 1.36-3.11) and DSS (HR, 2.27; 95% CI 1.38-3.73), as compared with LWL, after adjusting for covariates. In normal weight patients, the impact of HWL on OS (HR, 1.47; 95% CI 1.19-1.80) and DSS (HR, 1.59; 95% CI 1.24-2.03) was moderate. Among overweight/obese patients, no significant association between HWL and OS (HR, 1.22; 95% CI 0.95-1.55), or DSS (HR, 1.23; 95% CI 0.93-1.64) was found.Except for overweight/obese patients, high weight loss during radiation treatment was independently associated with poor survival in NPC. This impact was more prominent in the underweight patient group."
https://openalex.org/W2083822544,"Small cyclic nucleotide derivatives are employed as second messengers by both prokaryotes and eukaryotes to regulate diverse cellular processes responding to various signals. In bacteria, c-di-AMP has been discovered most recently, and some Gram-positive pathogens including S. pyogenes use this cyclic nucleotide derivative as a second messenger instead of c-di-GMP, a well-studied important bacterial second messenger. GdpP, c-di-AMP phosphodiesterase, is responsible for degrading c-di-AMP inside cells, and the cellular role of GdpP in S. pyogenes has not been examined yet. To test the cellular role of GdpP, we created a strain with a nonpolar inframe deletion of the gdpP gene, and examined the properties of the strain including virulence. From this study, we demonstrated that GdpP influences the biogenesis of SpeB, the major secreted cysteine protease, at a post-translational level, susceptibility to the beta lactam antibiotic ampicillin, and is necessary for full virulence in a murine subcutaneous infection model."
https://openalex.org/W2065850004,"A similar immune response is implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis and allergic disorders. We investigated the potential therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of rupatadine, a dual antagonist of histamine and platelet-activation factor (PAF), in bleomycin- (BLM-) and silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The indicated dosages of rupatadine were administered in rodents with bleomycin or silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The tissue injury, fibrosis, inflammatory cells and cytokines, and lung function were examined to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of rupatadine. The anti-fibrosis effect of rupatadine was compared with an H1 or PAF receptor antagonist, and efforts were made to reveal rupatadine's anti-fibrotic mechanism. Rupatadine promoted the resolution of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in a dose-dependent manner, as indicated by the reductions in inflammation score, collagen deposition and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation, and infiltration or expression of inflammatory cells or cytokines in the fibrotic lung tissue. Thus, rupatadine treatment improved the declined lung function and significantly decreased animal death. Moreover, rupatadine was able not only to attenuate silica-induced silicosis but also to produce a superior therapeutic efficacy compared to pirfenidone, histamine H1 antagonist loratadine, or PAF antagonist CV-3988. The anti-fibrotic action of rupatadine might relate to its attenuation of BLM- or PAF-induced premature senescence because rupatadine treatment protected against the in vivo and in vitro activation of the p53/p21-dependent senescence pathway. Our studies indicate that rupatadine promotes the resolution of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis by attenuating the PAF-mediated senescence response. Rupatadine holds promise as a novel drug to treat the devastating disease of pulmonary fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W1963878997,"Since the time of Plato, philosophers and educational policy-makers have assumed that the study of mathematics improves one's general ‘thinking skills’. Today, this argument, known as the ‘Theory of Formal Discipline’ is used in policy debates to prioritize mathematics in school curricula. But there is no strong research evidence which justifies it. We tested the Theory of Formal Discipline by tracking the development of conditional reasoning behavior in students studying post-compulsory mathematics compared to post-compulsory English literature. In line with the Theory of Formal Discipline, the mathematics students did develop their conditional reasoning to a greater extent than the literature students, despite them having received no explicit tuition in conditional logic. However, this development appeared to be towards the so-called defective conditional understanding, rather than the logically normative material conditional understanding. We conclude by arguing that Plato may have been correct to claim that studying advanced mathematics is associated with the development of logical reasoning skills, but that the nature of this development may be more complex than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2040893885,"During the last 100 years the Ethiopian upper Blue Nile Basin (BNB) has undergone major changes in land use, and is now potentially facing changes in climate. Rainfall over BNB supplies over two-thirds of the water to the Nile and supports a large local population living mainly on subsistence agriculture. Regional food security is sensitive to both the amount and timing of rain and is already an important political challenge that will be further complicated if scenarios of climate change are realized. In this study a simple spatial model of the timing and duration of summer rains (Kiremt) and dry season (Bega), and annual rain over the upper BNB was established from observed data between 1952 and 2004. The model was used to explore potential impacts of climate change on these rains, using a down-scaled ECHAM5/MP1-OM scenario between 2050 and 2100. Over the observed period the amount, onset and duration of Kiremt rains and rain-free Bega days have exhibited a consistent spatial pattern. The spatially averaged annual rainfall was 1490 mm of which 93% was Kiremt rain. The average Kiremt rain and number of rainy days was higher in the southwest (322 days) and decreased towards the north (136 days). Under the 2050-2100 scenario, the annual mean rainfall is predicted to increase by 6% and maintain the same spatial pattern as in the past. A larger change in annual rainfall is expected in the southwest (ca. +130 mm) with a gradually smaller change towards the north (ca. +70 mm). Results highlight the need to account for the characteristic spatiotemporal zonation when planning water management and climate adaptation within the upper BNB. The presented simple spatial resolved models of the presence of Kiremt and annual total rainfall could be used as a baseline for such long-term planning."

Structural neuroimaging holds promise for providing objective biomarkers for discriminating these diseases at the single subject level but all studies to date have reported incomplete separation of disease groups. In this study, we employed multi-class pattern recognition to assess the value of anatomical patterns derived from a widely available structural neuroimaging sequence for automated classification of these disorders. To achieve this, 17 patients with PSP, 14 with IPD and 19 with MSA were scanned using structural MRI along with 19 healthy controls (HCs). An advanced probabilistic pattern recognition approach was employed to evaluate the diagnostic value of several pre-defined anatomical patterns for discriminating the disorders, including: (i) a subcortical motor network; (ii) each of its component regions and (iii) the whole brain. All disease groups could be discriminated simultaneously with high accuracy using the subcortical motor network. The region providing the most accurate predictions overall was the midbrain/brainstem, which discriminated all disease groups from one another and from HCs. The subcortical network also produced more accurate predictions than the whole brain and all of its constituent regions. PSP was accurately predicted from the midbrain/brainstem, cerebellum and all basal ganglia compartments; MSA from the midbrain/brainstem and cerebellum and IPD from the midbrain/brainstem only. This study demonstrates that automated analysis of structural MRI can accurately predict diagnosis in individual patients with Parkinsonian disorders, and identifies distinct patterns of regional atrophy particularly useful for this process."
https://openalex.org/W2044143685,"HECT ubiquitin ligases are key components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is present in all eukaryotes. In this study, the patterns of emergence of HECT genes in plants are described. Phylogenetic and structural data indicate that viridiplantae have six main HECT subfamilies, which arose before the split that separated green algae from the rest of plants. It is estimated that the common ancestor of all plants contained seven HECT genes. Contrary to what happened in animals, the number of HECT genes has been kept quite constant in all lineages, both in chlorophyta and streptophyta, although evolutionary recent duplications are found in some species. Several of the genes found in plants may have originated very early in eukaryotic evolution, given that they have clear similarities, both in sequence and structure, to animal genes. Finally, in Arabidopsis thaliana, we found significant correlations in the expression patterns of HECT genes and some ancient, broadly expressed genes that belong to a different ubiquitin ligase family, called RBR. These results are discussed in the context of the evolution of the gene families required for ubiquitination in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2029901171,"The North American ecological species Daphniapulicaria and Daphniapulex are thought to have diverged from a common ancestor by adaptation to sympatric but ecologically distinct lake and pond habitats respectively. Based on mtDNA relationships, European D. pulicaria is considered a different species only distantly related to its North American counterpart, but both species share a lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh) allele F supposedly involved in lake adaptation in North America, and the same allele is also carried by the related Holarctic Daphniatenebrosa. The correct inference of the species' ancestral relationships is therefore critical for understanding the origin of their adaptive divergence. Our species tree inferred from unlinked nuclear loci for D. pulicaria and D. pulex resolved the European and North American D. pulicaria as sister clades, and we argue that the discordant mtDNA gene tree is best explained by capture of D. pulex mtDNA by D. pulicaria in North America. The Ldh gene tree shows that F-class alleles in D. pulicaria and D. tenebrosa are due to common descent (as opposed to introgression), with D. tenebrosa alleles paraphyletic with respect to D. pulicaria alleles. That D. tenebrosa still segregates the ancestral and derived amino acids at the two sites distinguishing the pond and lake alleles suggests that D. pulicaria inherited the derived states from the D. tenebrosa ancestry. Our results suggest that some adaptations restricting the gene flow between D. pulicaria and D. pulex might have evolved in response to selection in ancestral environments rather than in the species' current sympatric habitats. The Arctic (D. tenebrosa) populations are likely to provide important clues about these issues."
https://openalex.org/W2152761331,"Human genetic association studies have shown gene variants in the α5 subunit of the neuronal nicotinic receptor (nAChR) influence both ethanol and nicotine dependence. The α5 subunit is an accessory subunit that facilitates α4* nAChRs assembly in vitro. However, it is unknown whether this occurs in the brain, as there are few research tools to adequately address this question. As the α4*-containing nAChRs are highly expressed in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) we assessed the molecular, functional and pharmacological roles of α5 in α4*-containing nAChRs in the VTA. We utilized transgenic mice α5+/+(α4YFP) and α5-/-(α4YFP) that allow the direct visualization and measurement of α4-YFP expression and the effect of the presence (α5+/+) and absence of α5 (-/-) subunit, as the antibodies for detecting the α4* subunits of the nAChR are not specific. We performed voltage clamp electrophysiological experiments to study baseline nicotinic currents in VTA dopaminergic neurons. We show that in the presence of the α5 subunit, the overall expression of α4 subunit is increased significantly by 60% in the VTA. Furthermore, the α5 subunit strengthens baseline nAChR currents, suggesting the increased expression of α4* nAChRs to be likely on the cell surface. While the presence of the α5 subunit blunts the desensitization of nAChRs following nicotine exposure, it does not alter the amount of ethanol potentiation of VTA dopaminergic neurons. Our data demonstrates a major regulatory role for the α5 subunit in both the maintenance of α4*-containing nAChRs expression and in modulating nicotinic currents in VTA dopaminergic neurons. Additionally, the α5α4* nAChR in VTA dopaminergic neurons regulates the effect of nicotine but not ethanol on currents. Together, the data suggest that the α5 subunit is critical for controlling the expression and functional role of a population of α4*-containing nAChRs in the VTA."
https://openalex.org/W1979447818,"Geologic process, including tectonics and global climate change, profoundly impact the evolution of life because they have the propensity to facilitate episodes of biogeographic differentiation and influence patterns of speciation. We investigate causal links between a dramatic faunal turnover and two dominant geologic processes operating within Laurentia during the Late Ordovician: the Taconian Orogeny and GICE related global cooling. We utilize a novel approach for elucidating the relationship between biotic and geologic changes using a time-stratigraphic, species-level evolutionary framework for articulated brachiopods from North America. Phylogenetic biogeographic analyses indicate a fundamental shift in speciation mode—from a vicariance to dispersal dominated macroevolutionary regime—across the boundary between the Sandbian to Katian Stages. This boundary also corresponds to the onset of renewed intensification of tectonic activity and mountain building, the development of an upwelling zone that introduced cool, nutrient-rich waters into the epieric seas of eastern Laurentia, and the GICE isotopic excursion. The synchronicity of these dramatic geologic, oceanographic, and macroevolutionary changes supports the influence of geologic events on biological evolution. Together, the renewed tectonic activity and oceanographic changes facilitated fundamental changes in habitat structure in eastern North America that reduced opportunities for isolation and vicariance. They also facilitated regional biotic dispersal of taxa that led to the subsequent establishment of extrabasinal (=invasive) species and may have led to a suppression of speciation within Laurentian faunas. Phylogenetic biogeographic analysis further indicates that the Richmondian Invasion was a multidirectional regional invasion event that involved taxa immigrating into the Cincinnati region from basins located near the continental margins and within the continental interior."
https://openalex.org/W1990949726,"We sought to determine the prevalence of nasal colonisation with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus among cattle veterinarians in the UK. There was particular interest in examining the frequency of colonisation with MRSA harbouring mecC, as strains with this mecA homologue were originally identified in bovine milk and may represent a zoonotic risk to those in contact with dairy livestock. Three hundred and seven delegates at the British Cattle Veterinarian Association (BCVA) Congress 2011 in Southport, UK were screening for nasal colonisation with MRSA. Isolates were characterised by whole genome sequencing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Eight out of three hundred and seven delegates (2.6%) were positive for nasal colonisation with MRSA. All strains were positive for mecA and none possessed mecC. The time since a delegate’s last visit to a farm was significantly shorter in the MRSA-positive group than in MRSA-negative counterparts. BCVA delegates have an increased risk of MRSA colonisation compared to the general population but their frequency of colonisation is lower than that reported from other types of veterinarian conference, and from that seen in human healthcare workers. The results indicate that recent visitation to a farm is a risk factor for MRSA colonisation and that mecC-MRSA are rare among BCVA delegates (<1% based on sample size). Contact with livestock, including dairy cattle, may still be a risk factor for human colonisation with mecC-MRSA but occurs at a rate below the lower limit of detection available in this study."
https://openalex.org/W1964479231,"Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia is a severe respiratory disease of cattle that is caused by a bacterium of the Mycoplasma genus, namely Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides (Mmm). In the absence of classical virulence determinants, the pathogenicity of Mmm is thought to rely on intrinsic metabolic functions and specific components of the outer cell surface. One of these latter, the capsular polysaccharide galactan has been notably demonstrated to play a role in Mmm persistence and dissemination. The free exopolysaccharides (EPS), also produced by Mmm and shown to circulate in the blood stream of infected cattle, have received little attention so far. Indeed, their characterization has been hindered by the presence of polysaccharide contaminants in the complex mycoplasma culture medium. In this study, we developed a method to produce large quantities of EPS by transfer of mycoplasma cells from their complex broth to a chemically defined medium and subsequent purification. NMR analyses revealed that the purified, free EPS had an identical β(1−>6)-galactofuranosyl structure to that of capsular galactan. We then analyzed intraclonal Mmm variants that produce opaque/translucent colonies on agar. First, we demonstrated that colony opacity was related to the production of a capsule, as observed by electron microscopy. We then compared the EPS extracts and showed that the non-capsulated, translucent colony variants produced higher amounts of free EPS than the capsulated, opaque colony variants. This phenotypic variation was associated with an antigenic variation of a specific glucose phosphotransferase permease. Finally, we conducted in silico analyses of candidate polysaccharide biosynthetic pathways in order to decipher the potential link between glucose phosphotransferase permease activity and attachment/release of galactan. The co-existence of variants producing alternative forms of galactan (capsular versus free extracellular galactan) and associated with an antigenic switch constitutes a finely tuned mechanism that may be involved in virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2135986194,"Congenital hyperinsulinism of infancy (CHI) is a rare disorder characterized by severe hypoglycemia due to inappropriate insulin secretion. The genetic causes of CHI have been found in genes regulating insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells; recessive inactivating mutations in the ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes represent the most common events. Despite the advances in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of CHI, specific genetic determinants in about 50 % of the CHI patients remain unknown, suggesting additional locus heterogeneity. In order to search for novel loci contributing to the pathogenesis of CHI, we combined a family-based association study, using the transmission disequilibrium test on 17 CHI patients lacking mutations in ABCC8/KCNJ11, with a whole-exome sequencing analysis performed on 10 probands. This strategy allowed the identification of the potential causative mutations in genes implicated in the regulation of insulin secretion such as transmembrane proteins (CACNA1A, KCNH6, KCNJ10, NOTCH2, RYR3, SCN8A, TRPV3, TRPC5), cytosolic (ACACB, CAMK2D, CDKAL1, GNAS, NOS2, PDE4C, PIK3R3) and mitochondrial enzymes (PC, SLC24A6), and in four genes (CSMD1, SLC37A3, SULF1, TLL1) suggested by TDT family-based association study. Moreover, the exome-sequencing approach resulted to be an efficient diagnostic tool for CHI, allowing the identification of mutations in three causative CHI genes (ABCC8, GLUD1, and HNF1A) in four out of 10 patients. Overall, the present study should be considered as a starting point to design further investigations: our results might indeed contribute to meta-analysis studies, aimed at the identification/confirmation of novel causative or modifier genes."
https://openalex.org/W2023459567,"TNF is an important mediator of glomerulonephritis. The two TNF-receptors TNFR1 and TNFR2 contribute differently to glomerular inflammation in vivo, but specific mechanisms of TNFR-mediated inflammatory responses in glomeruli are unknown. We investigated their expression and function in murine kidneys, isolated glomeruli ex vivo, and glomerular cells in vitro. In normal kidney TNFR1 and TNFR2 were preferentially expressed in glomeruli. Expression of both TNFRs and TNF-induced upregulation of TNFR2 mRNA was confirmed in murine glomerular endothelial and mesangial cell lines. In vivo, TNF exposure rapidly induced glomerular accumulation of leukocytes. To examine TNFR-specific inflammatory responses in intrinsic glomerular cells but not infiltrating leukocytes we performed microarray gene expression profiling on intact glomeruli isolated from wildtype and Tnfr-deficient mice following exposure to soluble TNF ex vivo. Most TNF-induced effects were exclusively mediated by TNFR1, including induced glomerular expression of adhesion molecules, chemokines, complement factors and pro-apoptotic molecules. However, TNFR2 contributed to TNFR1-dependent mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators in glomeruli when exposed to low TNF concentrations. Chemokine secretion was absent in TNF-stimulated Tnfr1-deficient glomeruli, but also significantly decreased in glomeruli lacking TNFR2. In vivo, TNF-induced glomerular leukocyte infiltration was abrogated in Tnfr1-deficient mice, whereas Tnfr2-deficiency decreased mononuclear phagocytes infiltrates, but not neutrophils. These data demonstrate that activation of intrinsic glomerular cells by soluble TNF requires TNFR1, whereas TNFR2 is not essential, but augments TNFR1-dependent effects. Previously described TNFR2-dependent glomerular inflammation may therefore require TNFR2 activation by membrane-bound, but not soluble TNF."
https://openalex.org/W2043453379,"The liver has the ability to prime immune responses against neo antigens provided upon infections. However, T cell immunity in liver is uniquely modulated by the complex tolerogenic property of this organ that has to also cope with foreign agents such as endotoxins or food antigens. In this respect, the nature of intrahepatic T cell responses remains to be fully characterized. To gain deeper insight into the mechanisms that regulate the CD8+ T cell responses in the liver, we established a novel OVA_X_CreERT2 mouse model. Upon tamoxifen administration OVA antigen expression is observed in a fraction of hepatocytes, resulting in a mosaic expression pattern. To elucidate the cross-talk of CD8+ T cells with antigen-expressing hepatocytes, we adoptively transferred Kb/OVA257-264-specific OT-I T cells to OVA_X_CreERT2 mice or generated triple transgenic OVA_X CreERT2_X_OT-I mice. OT-I T cells become activated in OVA_X_CreERT2 mice and induce an acute and transient hepatitis accompanied by liver damage. In OVA_X_CreERT2_X_OT-I mice, OVA induction triggers an OT-I T cell mediated, fulminant hepatitis resulting in 50% mortality. Surviving mice manifest a long lasting hepatitis, and recover after 9 weeks. In these experimental settings, recovery from hepatitis correlates with a complete loss of OVA expression indicating efficient clearance of the antigen-expressing hepatocytes. Moreover, a relapse of hepatitis can be induced upon re-induction of cured OVA_X_CreERT2_X_OT-I mice indicating absence of tolerogenic mechanisms. This pathogen-free, conditional mouse model has the advantage of tamoxifen inducible tissue specific antigen expression that reflects the heterogeneity of viral antigen expression and enables the study of intrahepatic immune responses to both de novo and persistent antigen. It allows following the course of intrahepatic immune responses: initiation, the acute phase and antigen clearance."

However, not everyone who is successful with weight loss is able to reduce anti-diabetic medication use. In this retrospective cohort study, we assessed the predictive accuracy of baseline triglyceride (TGL)/HDL ratio, a marker of insulin resistance, to screen patients for success in reducing anti-diabetic medication use with weight loss. Methods Case records of 121 overweight and obese attendees at two outpatient weight management centers were analyzed. The weight loss intervention consisted of a calorie-restricted diet (~1000Kcal/day deficit), a behavior modification plan, and a plan for increasing physical activity. Results Mean period of follow-up was 12.5 ± 3.5 months. By study exit, mean weight loss and mean HbA1c% reduction were 15.4 ± 5.5 kgs and 0.5 ± 0.2% respectively. 81 (67%) in the study cohort achieved at least 1 dose reduction of any anti-diabetic medication. Tests for predictive accuracy of baseline TGL/HDL ratio ≤ 3 to determine success with dose reductions of anti-diabetic medications showed a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, area under the curve, likelihood ratio (LR) + and LR-of 81, 83, 90, 70, 78, 4.8 and 0.2, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1999727531,"PA energy expenditure (PAEE) is the most variable component of Total Energy Expenditure (TEE) and largely due to the balance of sedentary time (SedT) and low intensity physical activity (LIPA). There has been an emergence for seeking an understanding of factors which determine variations in SedT, LIPA, and PAEE. Sedentary behavior and physical activity are relatively resistant to change by experimental dietary treatments and significant body weight changes. Although caffeine (Caf) is by far the most heavily used nutritional agent ingested to promote a sense of vigor/alertness, it is still unknown if Caf is effective in increasing PAEE and physical activity. The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that 2 daily doses of Caf (as a capsule to blind the treatment and divided equally during breakfast and lunch) increase PAEE and TEE, and it would do so through increasing the frequent and brief bouts of physical activity (~1-5 min long) through the day as measured by accelerometry. In 21 low Caf users (<100 mg day-1), we used a double-blind crossover trial (ClinicalTrials.govID;NCT01477294) with two conditions (4-day each with a 3-day washout period) randomly ordered as 5 mg kg-1 day-1 of Caf and maltodextrin as placebo (Plc). Resting energy expenditure (REE) by indirect calorimetry, total energy expenditure (TEE) from doubly labeled water, PAEE calculated as TEE-(REE+0.1TEE), and accelerometry measurements of both LIPA and MVPA were not different between conditions. However, regardless of caffeine or placebo, there were several significant relationships between brief bouts of LIPA and MVPA with PAEE. In conclusion, this double-blind study found that low and moderate-vigorous activity as well as the total volume of PAEE in free-living conditions is resistant to dietary caffeine intake that was equivalent to 5 cups of espresso or 7 cups of tea.

https://openalex.org/W2052842048,"Within pharmacovigilance, knowledge of time-to-onset (time from start of drug administration to onset of reaction) is important in causality assessment of drugs and suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and may indicate pharmacological mechanisms involved. It has been suggested that time-to-onset from individual case reports can be used for detection of safety signals. However, some ADRs only occur during treatment, while those that do occur later are less likely to be reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of treatment duration on the reported time-to-onset. Case reports from the WHO Global ICSR database, VigiBase, up until February 5th 2010 were the basis of this study. To examine the effect of duration of treatment on reported time-to-onset, angioedema and hepatitis were selected to represent short and long latency ADRs, respectively. The reported time-to-onset for each of these ADRs was contrasted for a set of drugs expected to be used short- or long-term, respectively. The study included 2,980 unique reports for angioedema and 1,159 for hepatitis. Median reported time-to-onset for angioedema in short-term treatments ranged 0-1 days (median 0.5), for angioedema in long-term treatments 0-26 days (median 8), for hepatitis in short-term treatments 4-12 days (median 7.5) and for hepatitis in long term treatments 19-73 days (median 28). Short-term treatments presented significantly shorter reported time-to-onset than long-term treatments. Of note is that reported time-to-onset for angioedema for long-term treatments (median value of medians being 8 days) was very similar to that of hepatitis for short-term treatments (median value of medians equal 7.5 days). The expected duration of treatment needs to be considered in the interpretation of reported time-to-onset and should be accounted for in signal detection method development and case evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2073902845,"HIV-1 prevalence in Guangxi, China, has been growing since 1996, when the first case was reported. Over half of HIV-1 positive patients in Guangxi Province were injecting drug users (IDUs), possibly because of the province's location near drug-trafficking routes. Since a phase II HIV vaccine trial is ongoing there, a current characterization of the subtypes of HIV-1 among IDUs in Guangxi would provide critical information for future HIV vaccine trials, as well as further control and prevention of HIV-1 transmission. Thus, we conducted a molecular epidemiological investigation of HIV-1 samples from 2008-2010 among IDUs in multiple cities in Guangxi Province. Our results, based on the gag/pol fragment, indicated a very high proportion (78.47%) of HIV-1 CRF08_BC recombinants, some CRF01_AE (15.38%) recombinants, and a low proportion of CRF07_BC (6.15%) recombinants among the IDUs. The high proportion of CRF08 HIV-1 strains among recent IDUs matches the vaccine candidate constructs. However, future vaccine development should also incorporate CRF01-targeted vaccine candidates. Distinct Env sequence evolution patterns were observed for CRF08_BC and CRF01_AE, indicating that different local selection pressures have been exerted on these two HIV-1 subtypes. Unique drug-resistant mutations were also detected, and our data indicate that HIV treatment programs should consider pre-existing drug-resistant mutations."
