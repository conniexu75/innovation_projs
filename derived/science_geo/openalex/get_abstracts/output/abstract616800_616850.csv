https://openalex.org/W2887997888,"Although serum from patients with Parkinson’s disease contains elevated levels of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, TNF, IL-1β, and IFNγ, whether inflammation contributes to or is a consequence of neuronal loss remains unknown1. Mutations in parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and PINK1, a ubiquitin kinase, cause early onset Parkinson’s disease2,3. Both PINK1 and parkin function within the same biochemical pathway and remove damaged mitochondria from cells in culture and in animal models via mitophagy, a selective form of autophagy4. The in vivo role of mitophagy, however, is unclear, partly because mice that lack either PINK1 or parkin have no substantial Parkinson’s-disease-relevant phenotypes5–7. Mitochondrial stress can lead to the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that can activate innate immunity8–12, suggesting that mitophagy may mitigate inflammation. Here we report a strong inflammatory phenotype in both Prkn−/− and Pink1−/− mice following exhaustive exercise and in Prkn−/−;mutator mice, which accumulate mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)13,14. Inflammation resulting from either exhaustive exercise or mtDNA mutation is completely rescued by concurrent loss of STING, a central regulator of the type I interferon response to cytosolic DNA15,16. The loss of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra pars compacta and the motor defect observed in aged Prkn−/−;mutator mice are also rescued by loss of STING, suggesting that inflammation facilitates this phenotype. Humans with mono- and biallelic PRKN mutations also display elevated cytokines. These results support a role for PINK1- and parkin-mediated mitophagy in restraining innate immunity. Acute and chronic mitochondrial stress in mice require PINK1 and parkin to restrain STING-mediated innate immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2888169023,"Barrier tissue dysfunction is a fundamental feature of chronic human inflammatory diseases1. Specialized subsets of epithelial cells-including secretory and ciliated cells-differentiate from basal stem cells to collectively protect the upper airway2-4. Allergic inflammation can develop from persistent activation5 of type 2 immunity6 in the upper airway, resulting in chronic rhinosinusitis, which ranges in severity from rhinitis to severe nasal polyps7. Basal cell hyperplasia is a hallmark of severe disease7-9, but it is not known how these progenitor cells2,10,11 contribute to clinical presentation and barrier tissue dysfunction in humans. Here we profile primary human surgical chronic rhinosinusitis samples (18,036 cells, n = 12) that span the disease spectrum using Seq-Well for massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing12, report transcriptomes for human respiratory epithelial, immune and stromal cell types and subsets from a type 2 inflammatory disease, and map key mediators. By comparison with nasal scrapings (18,704 cells, n = 9), we define signatures of core, healthy, inflamed and polyp secretory cells. We reveal marked differences between the epithelial compartments of the non-polyp and polyp cellular ecosystems, identifying and validating a global reduction in cellular diversity of polyps characterized by basal cell hyperplasia, concomitant decreases in glandular cells, and phenotypic shifts in secretory cell antimicrobial expression. We detect an aberrant basal progenitor differentiation trajectory in polyps, and propose cell-intrinsic13, epigenetic14,15 and extrinsic factors11,16,17 that lock polyp basal cells into this uncommitted state. Finally, we functionally demonstrate that ex vivo cultured basal cells retain intrinsic memory of IL-4/IL-13 exposure, and test the potential for clinical blockade of the IL-4 receptor α-subunit to modify basal and secretory cell states in vivo. Overall, we find that reduced epithelial diversity stemming from functional shifts in basal cells is a key characteristic of type 2 immune-mediated barrier tissue dysfunction. Our results demonstrate that epithelial stem cells may contribute to the persistence of human disease by serving as repositories for allergic memories."
https://openalex.org/W2888537731,"Gene regulation involves activation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) that is paused and bound by the protein complexes DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF) and negative elongation factor (NELF). Here we show that formation of an activated Pol II elongation complex in vitro requires the kinase function of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) and the elongation factors PAF1 complex (PAF) and SPT6. The cryo-EM structure of an activated elongation complex of Sus scrofa Pol II and Homo sapiens DSIF, PAF and SPT6 was determined at 3.1 Å resolution and compared to the structure of the paused elongation complex formed by Pol II, DSIF and NELF. PAF displaces NELF from the Pol II funnel for pause release. P-TEFb phosphorylates the Pol II linker to the C-terminal domain. SPT6 binds to the phosphorylated C-terminal-domain linker and opens the RNA clamp formed by DSIF. These results provide the molecular basis for Pol II pause release and elongation activation."
https://openalex.org/W2888628838,"Mammalian cells are surrounded by neighbouring cells and extracellular matrix (ECM), which provide cells with structural support and mechanical cues that influence diverse biological processes1. The Hippo pathway effectors YAP (also known as YAP1) and TAZ (also known as WWTR1) are regulated by mechanical cues and mediate cellular responses to ECM stiffness2,3. Here we identified the Ras-related GTPase RAP2 as a key intracellular signal transducer that relays ECM rigidity signals to control mechanosensitive cellular activities through YAP and TAZ. RAP2 is activated by low ECM stiffness, and deletion of RAP2 blocks the regulation of YAP and TAZ by stiffness signals and promotes aberrant cell growth. Mechanistically, matrix stiffness acts through phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) to influence levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidic acid, which activates RAP2 through PDZGEF1 and PDZGEF2 (also known as RAPGEF2 and RAPGEF6). At low stiffness, active RAP2 binds to and stimulates MAP4K4, MAP4K6, MAP4K7 and ARHGAP29, resulting in activation of LATS1 and LATS2 and inhibition of YAP and TAZ. RAP2, YAP and TAZ have pivotal roles in mechanoregulated transcription, as deletion of YAP and TAZ abolishes the ECM stiffness-responsive transcriptome. Our findings show that RAP2 is a molecular switch in mechanotransduction, thereby defining a mechanosignalling pathway from ECM stiffness to the nucleus. The Ras-related GTPase RAP2 is a key intracellular signal transducer by which extracellular matrix rigidity controls mechanosensitive cellular activities through YAP and TAZ."
https://openalex.org/W2888327454,"Metazoan gene regulation often involves the pausing of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in the promoter-proximal region. Paused Pol II is stabilized by the protein complexes DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF) and negative elongation factor (NELF). Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a paused transcription elongation complex containing Sus scrofa Pol II and Homo sapiens DSIF and NELF at 3.2 Å resolution. The structure reveals a tilted DNA-RNA hybrid that impairs binding of the nucleoside triphosphate substrate. NELF binds the polymerase funnel, bridges two mobile polymerase modules, and contacts the trigger loop, thereby restraining Pol II mobility that is required for pause release. NELF prevents binding of the anti-pausing transcription elongation factor IIS (TFIIS). Additionally, NELF possesses two flexible 'tentacles' that can contact DSIF and exiting RNA. These results define the paused state of Pol II and provide the molecular basis for understanding the function of NELF during promoter-proximal gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2790700887,"The work of Berezinskii, Kosterlitz and Thouless in the 1970s1,2 revealed exotic phases of matter governed by the topological properties of low-dimensional materials such as thin films of superfluids and superconductors. A hallmark of this phenomenon is the appearance and interaction of vortices and antivortices in an angular degree of freedom-typified by the classical XY model-owing to thermal fluctuations. In the two-dimensional Ising model this angular degree of freedom is absent in the classical case, but with the addition of a transverse field it can emerge from the interplay between frustration and quantum fluctuations. Consequently, a Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition has been predicted in the quantum system-the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model-by theory and simulation3-5. Here we demonstrate a large-scale quantum simulation of this phenomenon in a network of 1,800 in situ programmable superconducting niobium flux qubits whose pairwise couplings are arranged in a fully frustrated square-octagonal lattice. Essential to the critical behaviour, we observe the emergence of a complex order parameter with continuous rotational symmetry, and the onset of quasi-long-range order as the system approaches a critical temperature. We describe and use a simple approach to statistical estimation with an annealing-based quantum processor that performs Monte Carlo sampling in a chain of reverse quantum annealing protocols. Observations are consistent with classical simulations across a range of Hamiltonian parameters. We anticipate that our approach of using a quantum processor as a programmable magnetic lattice will find widespread use in the simulation and development of exotic materials."
https://openalex.org/W2887913821,"The hallmark property of two-dimensional topological materials is the incredible robustness of the quantized Hall conductivity to disorder. That robustness arises from the fact that in the topological band gap, transport can occur only along the edges modes, which are immune to scattering. However, for sufficiently strong disorder, the band gap closes and the system becomes topologically trivial as all states become localized, such that all transport vanishes -- in accordance with Anderson localization. It therefore came as a surprise when it was suggested that, for a two-dimensional quantum spin-Hall topological system, the opposite could occur. In so-called topological Anderson insulators, the emergence of protected edge states and quantized transport is caused by the introduction of disorder. However, to date, the observation of the topological Anderson insulator phase has been elusive. In this article, we report the first experimental demonstration of a topological Anderson insulator. We do that in a photonic implementation: an array of helical, evanescently-coupled waveguides in a detuned honeycomb geometry. Under proper conditions, adding on-site disorder, in the form of random variations in the refractive index contrast defining the waveguides, drives the system from a trivial phase into a topological state."
https://openalex.org/W2888101674,"Most infections with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) manifest as a clinically asymptomatic, contained state, known as latent tuberculosis infection, that affects approximately one-quarter of the global population1. Although fewer than one in ten individuals eventually progress to active disease2, tuberculosis is a leading cause of death from infectious disease worldwide3. Despite intense efforts, immune factors that influence the infection outcomes remain poorly defined. Here we used integrated analyses of multiple cohorts to identify stage-specific host responses to Mtb infection. First, using high-dimensional mass cytometry analyses and functional assays of a cohort of South African adolescents, we show that latent tuberculosis is associated with enhanced cytotoxic responses, which are mostly mediated by CD16 (also known as FcγRIIIa) and natural killer cells, and continuous inflammation coupled with immune deviations in both T and B cell compartments. Next, using cell-type deconvolution of transcriptomic data from several cohorts of different ages, genetic backgrounds, geographical locations and infection stages, we show that although deviations in peripheral B and T cell compartments generally start at latency, they are heterogeneous across cohorts. However, an increase in the abundance of circulating natural killer cells in tuberculosis latency, with a corresponding decrease during active disease and a return to baseline levels upon clinical cure are features that are common to all cohorts. Furthermore, by analysing three longitudinal cohorts, we find that changes in peripheral levels of natural killer cells can inform disease progression and treatment responses, and inversely correlate with the inflammatory state of the lungs of patients with active tuberculosis. Together, our findings offer crucial insights into the underlying pathophysiology of tuberculosis latency, and identify factors that may influence infection outcomes. Integrated analyses of multiple cohorts are used to obtain a better understanding of the immune state of latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and factors that mediate and/or predict transitions from latent infection to active disease."

https://openalex.org/W2888303187,"In this paper we present a computer aided detection (CAD) system for automated measurement of the fetal head circumference (HC) in 2D ultrasound images for all trimesters of the pregnancy. The HC can be used to estimate the gestational age and monitor growth of the fetus. Automated HC assessment could be valuable in developing countries, where there is a severe shortage of trained sonographers. The CAD system consists of two steps: First, Haar-like features were computed from the ultrasound images to train a random forest classifier to locate the fetal skull. Secondly, the HC was extracted using Hough transform, dynamic programming and an ellipse fit. The CAD system was trained on 999 images and validated on an independent test set of 335 images from all trimesters. The test set was manually annotated by an experienced sonographer and a medical researcher. The reference gestational age (GA) was estimated using the crown-rump length measurement (CRL). The mean difference between the reference GA and the GA estimated by the experienced sonographer was 0.8 ± 2.6, −0.0 ± 4.6 and 1.9 ± 11.0 days for the first, second and third trimester, respectively. The mean difference between the reference GA and the GA estimated by the medical researcher was 1.6 ± 2.7, 2.0 ± 4.8 and 3.9 ± 13.7 days. The mean difference between the reference GA and the GA estimated by the CAD system was 0.6 ± 4.3, 0.4 ± 4.7 and 2.5 ± 12.4 days. The results show that the CAD system performs comparable to an experienced sonographer. The presented system shows similar or superior results compared to systems published in literature. This is the first automated system for HC assessment evaluated on a large test set which contained data of all trimesters of the pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2888644105,"Roots are one of the three fundamental organ systems of vascular plants1, and have roles in anchorage, symbiosis, and nutrient and water uptake2-4. However, the fragmentary nature of the fossil record obscures the origins of roots and makes it difficult to identify when the sole defining characteristic of extant roots-the presence of self-renewing structures called root meristems that are covered by a root cap at their apex1-9-evolved. Here we report the discovery of what are-to our knowledge-the oldest meristems of rooting axes, found in the earliest-preserved terrestrial ecosystem10 (the 407-million-year-old Rhynie chert). These meristems, which belonged to the lycopsid Asteroxylon mackiei11-14, lacked root caps and instead developed a continuous epidermis over the surface of the meristem. The rooting axes and meristems of A. mackiei are unique among vascular plants. These data support the hypothesis that roots, as defined in extant vascular plants by the presence of a root cap7, were a late innovation in the vascular lineage. Roots therefore acquired traits in a stepwise fashion. The relatively late origin in lycophytes of roots with caps is consistent with the hypothesis that roots evolved multiple times2 rather than having a single origin1, and the extensive similarities between lycophyte and euphyllophyte roots15-18 therefore represent examples of convergent evolution. The key phylogenetic position of A. mackiei-with its transitional rooting organ-between early diverging land plants that lacked roots and derived plants that developed roots demonstrates how roots were 'assembled' during the course of plant evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2888471712,"The initial fitness benefits of group living are considered to be the greatest hurdle to the evolution of sociality1, and evolutionary theory predicts that these benefits need to arise at very small group sizes2. Such benefits are thought to emerge partly from scaling effects that increase efficiency as group size increases3–5. In social insects and other taxa, the benefits of group living have been proposed to stem from division of labour5–8, which is characterized by between-individual variability and within-individual consistency (specialization) in task performance. However, at the onset of sociality groups were probably small and composed of similar individuals with potentially redundant—rather than complementary—function1. Self-organization theory suggests that division of labour can emerge even in relatively small, simple groups9,10. However, empirical data on the effects of group size on division of labour and on fitness remain equivocal6. Here we use long-term automated behavioural tracking in clonal ant colonies, combined with mathematical modelling, to show that increases in the size of social groups can generate division of labour among extremely similar workers, in groups as small as six individuals. These early effects on behaviour were associated with large increases in homeostasis—the maintenance of stable conditions in the colony11—and per capita fitness. Our model suggests that increases in homeostasis are primarily driven by increases in group size itself, and to a smaller extent by a higher division of labour. Our results indicate that division of labour, increased homeostasis and higher fitness can emerge naturally in social groups that are small and homogeneous, and that scaling effects associated with increasing group size can thus promote social cohesion at the incipient stages of group living. Experimental data from, and mathematical modelling of, colonies of the clonal raider ant Ooceraea biroi demonstrate that increases in group size generate division of labour among similar individuals, increased homeostasis and higher colony fitness."

https://openalex.org/W2888628027,"Emerging evidence has elucidated that microRNAs (miRNAs) transcribed from miRNA cluster at DLK-DIO3 imprinted domain are involved in various cancers. However, as one member of this cluster, the underlying mechanisms and functions of miR-381-3p in bladder cancer (BCa) still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that the hypermethylated status of upstream maternally expressed gene 3 divergent methylation region reduces the expression of miR-381-3p in BCa by bisulfite-sequencing PCR. In vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that overexpression of miR-381-3p significantly inhibits cell proliferation via inducing G1 phase arrest and migration via down-regulating MET and CCNA2 induced EMT progression. CDK6/CCNA2/MET are all identified as the direct targets of miR-381-3p by bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assay. Furthermore, inhibition of CCNA2 mediated by miR-381-3p as the crucial biregulator not only participates in the proliferation regulation with CDK6 in cell cycle but also modulates the EMT progression via ROCK/AKT/β-catenin/SNAIL pathway, which establishes an EMT circuit combined with miR-381-3p/MET/AKT/GSK-3β/SNAIL pathway, and SNAIL is the last confocal target to induce EMT progression. To conclude, we propose 2 novel regulatory circuits mediated by miR-381-3p in BCa, which may assist in the development of more effective therapies against BCa in the future.—Li, J., Ying, Y., Xie, H., Jin, K., Yan, H., Wang, S., Xu, M., Xu, X., Wang, X., Yang, K., Zheng, X., Xie, L.

The study also investigated the risk factors for contamination of dressed carcasses by Salmonella spp. at cottage poultry processor outlets where chickens are slaughtered and processed for sale.A total of 133 dressed, whole chickens and 87 chicken parts from 44 cottage poultry processors and 36 dressed, whole chickens and 194 chicken parts from 46 supermarket outlets were randomly collected throughout the country. Isolation and identification of Salmonella spp. were performed using standard bacteriological techniques. Serotyping was performed by a regional reference laboratory.The prevalence of Salmonella spp. in chicken carcasses sampled from cottage poultry processors and supermarkets was 20.5% and 8.3% respectively (p <0.001). The frequency of isolation of Salmonella spp. at cottage poultry processors was 22.4%, 23.0%, 7.1%, and 10.0% for non-chilled whole chicken, non-chilled chicken parts, chilled whole chicken and chilled chicken parts respectively. Fresh, non-chilled chicken (22.6%) yielded a higher frequency of isolation of Salmonella spp. than chilled chickens (8.3%). For supermarket samples, the frequency of isolation of Salmonella spp. was 19.0%, 8.1%, 0.0% and 7.6% for chilled whole chickens, chill chicken parts, frozen whole chicken and frozen chicken parts respectively. The swab method of sampling yielded a statistically significantly (p = 0.029) higher frequency (3.2%) of Salmonella spp. than the rinse method (1.6%). The predominant serotypes isolated were Kentucky (30.9%) and Javiana (22.7%). Use of chilled water-bath to cool carcasses was the only risk factor significantly (p = 0.044) associated with isolation of Salmonella spp.Raw chicken carcasses purchased from cottage poultry processors pose a significantly higher risk of contamination with Salmonella spp. than those sold at supermarkets."
https://openalex.org/W2888095998,"Introduction Sub-Saharan Africa is experiencing an epidemiological transition as the burden of NCDs overtake communicable diseases. However, it is unknown what capacity and gaps exist at primary care level to address the growing burden of NCDs. This study aimed to assess the Zambian health system’s capacity to address in NCDs, using an adapted WHO Essential Non Communicable Disease Interventions (WHO PEN) tool. Methodology This was a cross-sectional facility survey in the three districts conducted from September 2017 to October 2017. We defined facility readiness along five domains: basic equipment, essential services, diagnostic capacity, counseling services, and essential medicines. For each domain, we calculated an index as the mean score of items expressed as percentage. These indices were compared to an agreed cutoff at 70%, meaning that a facility index or district index below 70% off was considered as ‘not ready’ to manage NCDs at that level. All analysis were performed using Stata 15 MP. Results There appeared to be wide heterogeneity between facilities in respect of readiness to manage NCDs. Only 6 (including the three 1st level hospitals) out of the 46 facilities were deemed ready to manage NCDs. Only the first level hospitals scored a mean index higher than the 70% cut off; With regard to medications needed to manage NCDs, urban and rural health facilities were comparably equipped. However, there was evidence that calcium channel blockers (p = 0.013) and insulin (p = 0.022) were more likely to be available in urban and semi-urban health facilities compared to rural facilities. Conclusion Our study revealed gaps in primary health care capacity to manage NCDs in Zambia, with almost all health facilities failing to reach the minimum threshold. These results could be generalized to other similar districts in Zambia and the sub-region, where health systems remain focused on infectious rather than non-communicable Disease. These results should attract policy attention and potentially form the basis to review current approach to NCD care at the primary care level in Zambia and Sub-Saharan Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2888088084,"Malvaviscus arboreus Cav. is a medicinal plant belonging to family Malvaceae with both ethnomedical and culinary value; however, its phytochemical and biological profiles have been scarcely studied. Accordingly, this work was designed to explore the chemical composition and the hepatoprotective potential of M. arboreus against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatotoxicity. The total extract of the aerial parts and its derived fractions (petroleum ether, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and aqueous) were orally administered to rats for six consecutive days, followed by injection of CCl4 (1:1 v/v, in olive oil, 1.5 ml/kg, i.p.) on the next day. Results showed that the ethyl acetate and dichloromethane fractions significantly alleviated liver injury in rats as indicated by the reduced levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin (TB), and malondialdehyde (MDA), along with enhancement of the total antioxidant capacities of their livers, with the maximum effects were recorded by the ethyl acetate fraction. Moreover, the protective actions of both fractions were comparable to those of silymarin (100 mg/kg), and have been also substantiated by histopathological evaluations. On the other hand, liquid chromatography-high resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC‒HR‒ESI‒MS) metabolomic profiling of the crude extract of M. arboreus aerial parts showed the presence of a variety of phytochemicals, mostly phenolics, whereas the detailed chemical analysis of the most active fraction (i.e. ethyl acetate) resulted in the isolation and identification of six compounds for the first time in the genus, comprising four phenolic acids; β-resorcylic, caffeic, protocatechuic, and 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acids, in addition to two flavonoids; trifolin and astragalin. Such phenolic principles, together with their probable synergistic antioxidant and liver-protecting properties, seem to contribute to the observed hepatoprotective potential of M. arboreus."
https://openalex.org/W2888517310,"In 1906, Theodore Lyman discovered his eponymous series of transitions in the extreme-ultraviolet region of the atomic hydrogen spectrum1,2. The patterns in the hydrogen spectrum helped to establish the emerging theory of quantum mechanics, which we now know governs the world at the atomic scale. Since then, studies involving the Lyman-α line—the 1S–2P transition at a wavelength of 121.6 nanometres—have played an important part in physics and astronomy, as one of the most fundamental atomic transitions in the Universe. For example, this transition has long been used by astronomers studying the intergalactic medium and testing cosmological models via the so-called ‘Lyman-α forest’3 of absorption lines at different redshifts. Here we report the observation of the Lyman-α transition in the antihydrogen atom, the antimatter counterpart of hydrogen. Using narrow-line-width, nanosecond-pulsed laser radiation, the 1S–2P transition was excited in magnetically trapped antihydrogen. The transition frequency at a field of 1.033 tesla was determined to be 2,466,051.7 ± 0.12 gigahertz (1σ uncertainty) and agrees with the prediction for hydrogen to a precision of 5 × 10−8. Comparisons of the properties of antihydrogen with those of its well-studied matter equivalent allow precision tests of fundamental symmetries between matter and antimatter. Alongside the ground-state hyperfine4,5 and 1S–2S transitions6,7 recently observed in antihydrogen, the Lyman-α transition will permit laser cooling of antihydrogen8,9, thus providing a cold and dense sample of anti-atoms for precision spectroscopy and gravity measurements10. In addition to the observation of this fundamental transition, this work represents both a decisive technological step towards laser cooling of antihydrogen, and the extension of antimatter spectroscopy to quantum states possessing orbital angular momentum. The observation of the 1S–2P Lyman-α transition in the antihydrogen atom, the antimatter counterpart of hydrogen, is reported."
https://openalex.org/W2888744607,"The aim of the current study was to identify biomarkers that correlate with the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system and prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We downloaded 4 gene expression datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo), and screened for genes that were differentially expressed between HCC and normal liver tissues, using significance analysis of the microarray algorithm. We used a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify hub genes that correlate with BCLC staging, functional enrichment analysis to associate hub genes with their functions, protein-protein interaction network analysis to identify interactions among hub genes, UALCAN analysis to assess gene expression levels based on tumour stage, and survival analyses to clarify the effects of hub genes on patients' overall survival (OS). We identified 50 relevant hub genes using WGCNA; among them, 13 genes (including TIGD5, C8ORF33, NUDCD1, INSB8, and STIP1) correlated with OS and BCLC staging. Significantly enriched gene ontology biological process terms included RNA processing, non-coding RNA processing and phosphodiester bond hydrolysis, and 6 genes were found to interact with 10 or more hub genes. We identified several candidate biomarkers that correlate with BCLC staging and OS of HCC. These genes might be used for prognostic assessment and selection of HCC patients for surgery, especially those with intermediate or advanced disease."

https://openalex.org/W2888474034,"Curcumin, a natural polyphenol that contributes to the flavor and yellow pigment of the spice turmeric, is known for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties. Capable of affecting the initiation, promotion, and progression of carcinogenesis through multiple mechanisms, curcumin has potential utility for both chemoprevention and chemotherapy. Previous studies demonstrated that curcumin can inhibit ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity in human leukemia and breast cancer cells, and pretreatment with dietary curcumin blocks carcinogen-induced ODC activity in rodent models of skin, colon, and renal cancer. The current study investigated the regulation of polyamine metabolism in human gastric and colon carcinoma cell lines in response to curcumin. Curcumin treatment significantly induced spermine oxidase (SMOX) mRNA and activity, which results in the generation of hydrogen peroxide, a source of ROS. Simultaneously, curcumin down regulated spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) activity and the biosynthetic enzymes ODC and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC), thereby diminishing intracellular polyamine pools. Combination treatments using curcumin with the ODC inhibitor 2-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an agent currently in clinical chemoprevention trials, significantly enhanced inhibition of ODC activity and decreased growth of GI cancer cell lines beyond that observed with either agent alone. Similarly, combining curcumin with the polyamine analogue bis(ethyl)norspermine enhanced growth inhibition that was accompanied by enhanced accumulation of the analogue and decreased intracellular polyamine levels beyond those observed with either agent alone. Importantly, cotreatment with curcumin permitted the lowering of the effective dose of ODC inhibitor or polyamine analogue. These studies provide insight into the polyamine-related mechanisms involved in the cancer cell response to curcumin and its potential as a chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic agent in the GI tract."
https://openalex.org/W2888739523,"Background Influenza infection could be more effectively controlled if a multi-purpose vaccine with the ability to induce responses against most, or all, influenza A subtypes could be generated. Conserved viral proteins are a promising basis for the creation of a broadly protective vaccine. In the present study, the immunogenicity and protective properties of three recombinant proteins (vaccine candidates), comprising conserved viral proteins fused with bacterial flagellin, were compared. Methods Balb/c mice were immunized intranasally with recombinant proteins comprising either one viral protein (the ectodomain of the M2 protein, ‘M2e’) or two viral proteins (M2e and the hemagglutinin second subunit ‘HA2’ epitope) genetically fused with flagellin. Further, two different consensus variants of HA2 were used. Therefore, three experimental positives were used in addition to the negative control (Flg-his). The mucosal, humoral, and T-cell immune responses to these constructs were evaluated. Result We have demonstrated that insertion of the HA2 consensus polypeptide (aa 76–130), derived from either the first (HA2-1) or second (HA2-2) virus phylogenetic group, into the recombinant Flg4M2e protein significantly enhanced its immunogenicity and protective properties. Intranasal administration of the vaccine candidates (Flg-HA2-2-4M2e or Flg-HA2-1-4M2e) induced considerable mucosal and systemic responses directed at both the M2e-protein and, in general, the influenza A virus. However, the immune response elicited by the Flg-HA2-1-4M2e protein was weaker than the one generated by Flg-HA2-2-4M2e. These recombinant proteins containing both viral peptides provide complete protection from lethal challenge with various influenza viruses: A/H3N2; A/H2N2; and A/H5N1. Conclusion This study demonstrates that the intranasal administration of Flg-HA2-2-4M2e recombinant protein induces a strong immune response which provides broad protection against various influenza viruses. This construct is therefore a strong candidate for development as a universal vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W2888653780,"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are routinely used in both veterinary and human medicine. Gastrointestinal injury is a frequent adverse event associated with NSAID use and evidence suggests that NSAIDs induce gastrointestinal microbial imbalance (i.e., dysbiosis) in both animals and people. It is unknown, however, whether cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-selective NSAIDs induce dysbiosis, or if this phenomenon occurs in horses administered any class of NSAIDs. Therefore, our objectives were to determine whether the composition and diversity of the fecal microbiota of adult horses were altered by NSAID use, and whether these effects differed between non-selective and COX-2-selective NSAIDs. Twenty-five adult horses were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: control (n = 5); phenylbutazone (n = 10); or, firocoxib (n = 10). Treatments were administered for 10 days. Fecal samples were collected every 5 days for 25 days. DNA was extracted from feces and the 16S rRNA gene amplified and sequenced to determine the composition of the microbiota and the inferred metagenome. While the fecal microbiota profile of the control group remained stable over time, the phenylbutazone and firocoxib groups had decreased diversity, and alteration of their microbiota profiles was most pronounced at day 10. Similarly, there were clear alterations of the inferred metagenome at day 10 compared to all other days, indicating that use of both non-selective and selective COX inhibitors resulted in temporary alterations of the fecal microbiota and inferred metagenome. Dysbiosis associated with NSAID administration is clinically relevant because dysbiosis has been associated with several important diseases of horses including abdominal pain (colic), colitis, enteric infections, and laminitis."
https://openalex.org/W2888407421,"The present work is a reanalysis of prior work documenting postural sway in phasmids (i.e., ""stick insects"") [1]. The prior work pursued the possibility that postural sway was an evolutionary adaptation supporting motion camouflage to avoid the attention of predators. For instance, swaying along with leaves blown by the wind might reduce the likelihood of standing out to a predator. The present work addresses the alternative-but by no means conflicting and perhaps more explanatory-proposal that phasmid postural sway carries evidence of the tensegrity-like structures allowing postural stabilization under wind-like stimulation. Tensegrity structures are prestressed architectures embodying nonlinear interactions across scales of space and time that provide context-sensitive responses faster than neural tissue can support. Multifractal modeling of the postural-displacement series initially recorded in [1] offers a metric equally effective for quantifying complexity of phasmid postural sway under wind stimulation as for quantifying complexity of human postural sway [2-7]. Furthermore, multifractal modeling offers a means to demonstrate empirically the nonlinear interactions across space and time scales in body-wide coordination that tensegrity-based hypotheses predict. Specifically, multifractal modeling allows diagnosing the strength and direction of nonlinear interactions across time scale as the difference between multifractal estimates for the original postural-displacement series and for a sample of best-fitting linear models of the series. The reduction of postural sway directly following the application of wind stimulus appears as a significant decrease in the multifractal structure for original postural-displacement series as compared to best-fitting linear models of those series. This decrease indicates the capacity for nonlinear interactions across time scale to constrict variability, which is an aspect of nonlinear dynamics often overshadowed by the possibility that nonlinearity can produce more variability. This work offers the longer-range opportunity that multifractal modeling could provide a common language within which to coordinate behavioral sciences across a wide range of species."
https://openalex.org/W2950097520,"The discovery that 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) selectively destroys dopaminergic neurons and causes Parkinson’s disease (PD) symptoms in mammals has strengthened the environmental hypothesis of PD. The current model for the dopaminergic toxicity of MPP+ is centered on its uptake into dopaminergic neurons, accumulation into the mitochondria, inhibition of the complex-I leading to ATP depletion, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and apoptotic cell death. However, some aspects of this mechanism and the details of the cellular and mitochondrial accumulation of MPP+ are still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to characterize a structural and functional MPP+ mimic which is suitable to study the cellular distribution and mitochondrial uptake of MPP+ in live cells and use it to identify the molecular details of these processes to advance the understanding of the mechanism of the selective dopaminergic toxicity of MPP+. Here we report the characterization of the fluorescent MPP+ derivative, 1-methyl-4-(4'-iodophenyl)pyridinium (4'I-MPP+), as a suitable candidate for this purpose. Using this novel probe, we show that cytosolic/mitochondrial Ca2+ play a critical role through the sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) in the mitochondrial and cellular accumulation of MPP+ suggesting for the first time that MPP+ and related mitochondrial toxins may also exert their toxic effects through the perturbation of Ca2+ homeostasis in dopaminergic cells. We also found that the specific mitochondrial NCX (mNCX) inhibitors protect dopaminergic cells from the MPP+ and 4'I-MPP+ toxicity, most likely through the inhibition of the mitochondrial uptake, which could potentially be exploited for the development of pharmacological agents to protect the central nervous system (CNS) dopaminergic neurons from PD-causing environmental toxins."
https://openalex.org/W2888364570,"Tiger (Panthera tigris) populations are in danger across their entire range due to habitat loss, poaching and the demand for tiger parts. The Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) is an endangered apex predator with a population size estimated to be less than 200 in Nepal. In spite of strict wildlife protection laws, illegal trade of tiger parts is increasing; and Nepal has become one of the major sources and transit routes for poached wildlife parts. Identification of wildlife parts is often challenging for law enforcement officials due to inadequate training and lack of available tools. Here, we describe a molecular forensic approach to gain insight into illegally trafficked tiger parts seized across Nepal. We created Nepal’s first comprehensive reference genetic database of wild tigers through the Nepal Tiger Genome Project (2011–2013). This database has nuclear DNA microsatellite genotype and sex profiles, including geo-spatial information, of over 60% (n = 120) of the wild tigers of Nepal. We analyzed 15 putative cases of confiscated poached tiger parts and all were confirmed to be of tiger. Ten samples were identified as male and five were female. We determined probable geo-source location for 9 of the 14 samples with 6–8 nuclear DNA microsatellite loci using inferences from four different statistical assignment methods. Six samples were assigned to Bardia National Park and one of these was an exact match to a female tiger previously profiled in our fecal DNA reference database. Two tiger samples were assigned to Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve and one to Chitwan National Park. We are unable to definitively assign five tiger samples which could be offspring dispersers or might have come from tiger population outside of Nepal. Our study revealed that the western region, particularly Bardia National Park, is a poaching hotspot for illegal tiger trade in Nepal. We present feasibility of using molecular forensic based evidence to incriminate criminals in a court of law in the fight against wildlife crime."
https://openalex.org/W2888403142,"Elevated population levels of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman) can drastically alter forest ecosystems and negatively impact society through human interactions such as deer vehicle collisions. It is currently difficult to estimate deer populations at multiple scales ranging from stand, county, state, and regional levels. This presents a challenge as natural resource managers develop silvicultural prescriptions and forest management practices aimed at successfully regenerating tree species in the face of deer browsing. This study utilized measurements of deer browse impact from the new tree regeneration indicator developed by the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program. Seedling and sapling abundance and other plot-level characteristics were analyzed across three states (Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin) in the Great Lakes Region of the United States. Socio-environmental datasets (Lyme disease cases, deer vehicle collisions, and deer density estimates) were used in conjunction with FIA data to determine their predictive power in estimating deer browse impacts by county. Predictions from random forests models indicate that using Lyme disease case reports, the number of deer-vehicle collisions, deer density estimates, and forest inventory information correctly predicted deer browse impact 70–90% of the time. Deer-vehicle collisions per county ranked highly important in the random forests for predicting deer browse impacts in all three states. Lyme disease cases ranked high in importance for the Lake States combined and for Minnesota and Wisconsin, separately. Results show the effectiveness of predicting deer browse impacts using a suite of freely available forest inventory and other socio-environmental information."
https://openalex.org/W2888521146,"Protein glycosylation is an essential posttranslational modification that affects a myriad of physiologic processes. Humans with genetic defects in glycosylation, which result in truncated glycans, often present with significant cardiac deficits. Acquired heart diseases and their associated risk factors were also linked to aberrant glycosylation, highlighting its importance in human cardiac disease. In both cases, the link between causation and corollary remains enigmatic. The glycosyltransferase gene, mannosyl (α-1,3-)-glycoprotein β-1,2- N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (Mgat1), whose product, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (GlcNAcT1) is necessary for the formation of hybrid and complex N-glycan structures in the medial Golgi, was shown to be at reduced levels in human end-stage cardiomyopathy, thus making Mgat1 an attractive target for investigating the role of hybrid/complex N-glycosylation in cardiac pathogenesis. Here, we created a cardiomyocyte-specific Mgat1 knockout (KO) mouse to establish a model useful in exploring the relationship between hybrid/complex N-glycosylation and cardiac function and disease. Biochemical and glycomic analyses showed that Mgat1KO cardiomyocytes produce predominately truncated N-glycan structures. All Mgat1KO mice died significantly younger than control mice and demonstrated chamber dilation and systolic dysfunction resembling human dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Data also indicate that a cardiomyocyte L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (Cav) subunit (α2δ1) is a GlcNAcT1 target, and Mgat1KO Cav activity is shifted to more-depolarized membrane potentials. Consistently, Mgat1KO cardiomyocyte Ca2+ handling is altered and contraction is dyssynchronous compared with controls. The data demonstrate that reduced hybrid/complex N-glycosylation contributes to aberrant cardiac function at whole-heart and myocyte levels drawing a direct link between altered glycosylation and heart disease. Thus, the Mgat1KO provides a model for investigating the relationship between systemic reductions in glycosylation and cardiac disease, showing that clinically relevant changes in cardiomyocyte hybrid/complex N-glycosylation are sufficient to cause DCM and early death.-Ednie, A. R., Deng, W., Yip, K.-P., Bennett, E. S. Reduced myocyte complex N-glycosylation causes dilated cardiomyopathy."

Bi-directional screening for TB and diabetes mellitus (DM) is already implemented in India, a country with a dual burden of TB and NCDs. However, very limited programmatic data are available on the feasibility of adding other NCDs and their risk factors in such screening programme.To assess the yield, feasibility, and acceptability of a two-stage integrated screening for NCDs and risk factors for NCDs among patients with TB ≥20 years and treated in DOTS centres of two medical colleges in Delhi, between October 2016 and March 2017.It was a mixed-methods, triangulation study with a quantitative component (cross-sectional study using questionnaires, anthropometric measurements and records review) and a qualitative component (descriptive study using interview data).Amongst 403 patients screened, the prevalence of hypertension was 7% (n = 28) with 20 new cases detected and 8% for DM (n = 32) with 6 new cases diagnosed. The number needed to screen to find a new case was 20 and 63 for hypertension and DM respectively. The most frequent NCD-risk factors were inadequate vegetable (80%) and fruits (72%) intake, alcohol use (34%), use of smokeless tobacco (33%) and smoking (32%). Clustering of four or more risk factors was associated with increasing age and male sex (p<0.05). Both patients and health providers considered the screening relevant and acceptable. However, waiting time and costs involved in blood tests were considered as bothersome by the patients, while health providers perceived increased workload, inadequate medical supplies and inadequate skills and knowledge as key challenges in implementation of the screening.Integrating screening for NCDs and their risk factors in the existing TB programme produces high yield and it is feasible and acceptable by patients and health providers provided the challenges are overcome."
https://openalex.org/W2888573437,"mTOR kinase and the A isoform of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH-A) are key players controlling the metabolic characteristics of cancer cells. By using cultured human breast cells as a “metabolic tumor” model, we attempted to explore the correlation between these two factors. “Metabolic tumors” are defined as neoplastic conditions frequently associated with features of the metabolic syndrome, such as hyper-insulinemia and hyper-glycemia. MCF-7 cells (a well differentiated carcinoma) and MCF-10A cells (a widely used model for studying normal breast cell transformation) were used in this study. These cells were exposed to known factors triggering mTOR activation. In both treated cultures, we evaluated the link between mTOR kinase activity and the level of LDH expression / function. Furthermore, we elaborated the metabolic changes produced in cells by the mTOR-directed LDH-A up-regulation. Interestingly, we observed that in the non-neoplastic MCF-10A culture, mTOR-directed up-regulation of LDH-A was followed by a reprogramming of cell metabolism, which showed an increased dependence on glycolysis rather than on oxidative reactions. As a consequence, lactate production appeared to be enhanced and cells began to display increased self-renewal and clonogenic power: signals suggestive of neoplastic change. Enhanced clonogenicity of cells was abolished by rapamycin treatment, and furthermore heavily reduced by LDH enzymatic inhibition. These results highlighted a mechanistic link between metabolic alterations and tumorigenesis, whereby suggesting LDH inhibition as a possible chemo-preventive measure to target the metabolic alterations driving neoplastic change."

https://openalex.org/W2888420520,"Background Risk stratification of hospital patients for adverse drug events would enable targeting patients who may benefit from interventions aimed at reducing drug-related morbidity. It would support clinicians and hospital pharmacists in selecting patients to deliver a more efficient health care service. This study aimed to develop a prediction model that helps to identify patients on the day of hospital admission who are at increased risk of developing a clinically relevant, preventable adverse drug event during their stay on a surgical ward. Methods Data of the pre-intervention measurement period of the P-REVIEW study were used. This study was designed to assess the impact of a multifaceted educational intervention on clinically relevant, preventable adverse drug events in surgical patients. Thirty-nine variables were evaluated in a univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis, respectively. Model performance was expressed in the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics. Bootstrapping was used for model validation. Results 6780 admissions of patients at surgical wards were included during the pre-intervention period of the PREVIEW trial. 102 patients experienced a clinically relevant, adverse drug event during their hospital stay. The prediction model comprised five variables: age, number of biochemical tests ordered, heparin/LMWH in therapeutic dose, use of opioids, and use of cardiovascular drugs. The AUROC was 0.86 (95% CI 0.83–0.88). The model had a sensitivity of 80.4% and a specificity of 73.4%. The positive and negative predictive values were 4.5% and 99.6%, respectively. Bootstrapping generated parameters in the same boundaries. Conclusions The combined use of a limited set of easily ascertainable patient characteristics can help physicians and pharmacists to identify, at the time of admission, surgical patients who are at increased risk of developing ADEs during their hospital stay. This may serve as a basis for taking extra precautions to ensure medication safety in those patients."
https://openalex.org/W2888480554,"Microcontact printing has become a versatile soft lithography technique used to produce molecular micro- and nano-patterns consisting of a large range of different biomolecules. Despite intensive research over the last decade and numerous applications in the fields of biosensors, microarrays and biomedical applications, the large-scale implementation of microcontact printing is still an issue. It is hindered by the stamp-inking step that is critical to ensure a reproducible and uniform transfer of inked molecules over large areas. This is particularly important when addressing application such as cell microarray manufacturing, which are currently used for a wide range of analytical and pharmaceutical applications. In this paper, we present a large-scale and multiplexed microcontact printing process of extracellular matrix proteins for the fabrication of cell microarrays. We have developed a microfluidic inking approach combined with a magnetic clamping technology that can be adapted to most standard substrates used in biology. We have demonstrated a significant improvement of homogeneity of printed protein patterns on surfaces larger than 1 cm2 through the control of both the flow rate and the wetting mechanism of the stamp surface during microfluidic inking. Thanks to the reproducibility and integration capabilities provided by microfluidics, we have achieved the printing of three different adhesion proteins in one-step transfer. Selective cell adhesion and cell shape adaptation on the produced patterns were observed, showing the suitability of this approach for producing on-demand large-scale cell microarrays."

Since one of the major contributors to the nonadherence is the presence of side effects of the drugs being used, the availability of tools for assessment of adverse reactions is of great importance.The objective of the present work was to develop an Arabic language version of the Glasgow Antipsychotic Side-effect Scale (GASS).After confirming the accuracy of translation, the questionnaire was given to 100 patients in two psychiatric centers in Saudi Arabia.The Cronbach's alpha (0.793) indicated a good reliability of the survey. The mean GASS score was 19.09, indicating absent or mild side effects of antipsychotics, but 46% of patients experienced moderate, and 25% experienced severe side effects. An analysis of the correlation between patients' characteristics and side effects revealed the presence of a positive relationship between the side effects and health literacy.It is expected that the Arabic-GASS will benefit Arabic-speaking psychiatric patients by helping them to express their concerns about side effects of antipsychotics. The collected results also document the importance of patients' health literacy in achieving high-quality healthcare."

In systemic sarcoidosis, age-related differences in the clinical presentation, which reflect the therapeutic strategies, was reported. We retrospectively compared 100 consecutive patients from April 2010 to March 2016 who were initially diagnosed with ocular sarcoidosis by International Workshop on Ocular Sarcoidosis criteria. They were classified into elder (>65 years: 50 patients) and younger (≤65 years: 50 patients) groups by the age at diagnosis of uveitis associated with sarcoidosis. All patients received ophthalmic examination to assess the presence of seven intraocular signs and 4 laboratory parameters. Significantly fewer ocular signs (2.8 ± 1.5 and 3.6 ± 1.5; P = 0.0034) and abnormal laboratory results (1.5 ± 1.2 and 2.0 ± 1.2; P = 0.023) were detected in the elder group than in the younger group; statistical differences were found between the groups regarding the frequencies of mutton-fat keratic precipitates (40% and 64%; P = 0.012), vitreous opacities (60% and 78%; P = 0.0059), bilateral inflammation (64% and 80%; P = 0.012), and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy between the groups (52% and 78%; P < 0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis showed negative correlations between age and number of detected ocular signs (r = −0.36, P < 0.001) and laboratory results (r = −0.20, P = 0.023). The characteristic ocular signs and abnormal laboratory results had a lower frequency in the elder patients compared with the younger patients.

Here, severely injured patients are selected by additive physiological parameters and by the general Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS)-based assessment. However, all definitions should conform to an AIS severity coding applied by an expert. We examined the dependence of individual coding on defining injury severity in general and in identifying polytrauma according to several definitions. A precise definition of polytrauma is important for quality management.We investigated the interobserver reliability (IR) between several polytrauma definitions for identifying polytrauma using several cut-off levels (ISS ≥16, ≥18, ≥20, ≥25 points, and the Berlin Definition). One hundred and eighty-seven patients were included for analyzing IR of the polytrauma definitions. IR for polytrauma definitions was assessed by Cohen's kappa.IR for identifying polytrauma according to the relevant definitions showed moderate agreement (<0.60) in the ISS cutoff categories (ISS ≥16, ≥18, and ≥20 points), while ISS ≥25 points just reached substantial agreement (0.62) and the Berlin Definition demonstrated a correlation of 0.77 which is nearly perfect agreement (>0.80).Compared with the ISS-based definitions of polytrauma, the Berlin Definition proved less dependent on the individual rater. This underlines the need to redefine the selection of severely injured patients. Using the Berlin Definition for identifying polytrauma could improve the comparability of patient data across studies, in trauma center benchmarking, and in quality assurance."

Insect alimentary tracts secrete several enzymes that are used for detoxification, including cytochrome P450s, glutathione S-transferases, and carboxylesterases. To explore the adaptation of P. utilis to its toxic host plant, E. adenophorum at molecular level, we sequenced the transcriptome of the alimentary tract of P. utilis using Illumina sequencing. Sequencing and de novo assembly yielded 62,443 high-quality contigs with an average length of 604 bp that were further assembled into 45,985 unigenes with an average length of 674 bp and an N50 of 983 bp. Among the unigenes, 30,430 (66.17%) were annotated by alignment against the NCBI non-redundant protein (Nr) database, while 16,700 (36.32%), 16,267 (35.37%), and 11,530 (25.07%) were assigned functions using the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Gene Ontology (GO) databases, respectively. Using the comprehensive transcriptome data set, we manually identified several important gene families likely to be involved in the detoxification of toxic compounds including 21 unigenes within the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family, 22 unigenes within the cytochrome P450 (P450) family, and 16 unigenes within the carboxylesterase (CarE) family. Quantitative PCR was used to verify eight, six, and two genes of GSTs, P450s, and CarEs, respectively, in different P. utilis tissues and at different developmental stages. The detoxification enzyme genes were mainly expressed in the foregut and midgut. Moreover, the unigenes were higher expressed in the larvae, pupae, and 3-day adults, while they were expressed at lower levels in eggs.

https://openalex.org/W2888231654,"17β-estradiol (E2) has been shown to have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system. We previously demonstrated that E2 increases striatin levels and inhibits migration in vascular smooth muscle cells. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of E2 on the regulation of striatin expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We demonstrated that E2 increased striatin protein expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner in HUVECs. Pretreatment with ICI 182780 or the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, abolished E2-mediated upregulation of striatin protein expression. Treatment with E2 resulted in Akt phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, silencing striatin significantly inhibited HUVEC migration, while striatin overexpression significantly promoted HUVEC migration. Finally, E2 enhanced HUVEC migration, which was inhibited by silencing striatin. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that E2-mediated upregulation of striatin promotes cell migration in HUVECs."
https://openalex.org/W2888491513,"After peripheral nerve crush injury, the fibers of distal nerve segments gradually disintegrate, and axons regrow from the proximal nerve segment, eventually reaching the target organ. However, the axon regeneration is generally not sufficient for the recovery of neurological function, so drug therapy is necessary. In the current study, we explored the effect of Tanshinone IIA in nerve regeneration in a sciatic nerve crush injury model using Sprague Dawley rats. The rats were administered 45 mg/kg of Tanshinone IIA once daily. Motor behavior and tibialis anterior muscle mass were assessed, and histological analysis of the sciatic nerve and lumbar spinal cord were conducted. The results showed that the administration of Tanshinone IIA improved nerve growth and motor function, and resulted in a marked decrease of neuronal death. The findings of this exploratory study suggest that Tanshinone IIA alleviates injury and boosts regeneration after nerve crush injury in a rat model of sciatic nerve injury."
https://openalex.org/W2888032813,"Erythropoiesis is regulated at many levels, including control of mRNA translation. Changing environmental conditions, such as hypoxia or the availability of nutrients and growth factors, require a rapid response enacted by the enhanced or repressed translation of existing transcripts. Cold shock domain protein e1 (Csde1/Unr) is an RNA-binding protein required for erythropoiesis and strongly upregulated in erythroblasts relative to other hematopoietic progenitors. The aim of this study is to identify the Csde1-containing protein complexes and investigate their role in post-transcriptional expression control of Csde1-bound transcripts. We show that Serine/Threonine kinase receptor-associated protein (Strap/Unrip), was the protein most strongly associated with Csde1 in erythroblasts. Strap is a WD40 protein involved in signaling and RNA splicing, but its role when associated with Csde1 is unknown. Reduced expression of Strap did not alter the pool of transcripts bound by Csde1. Instead, it altered the mRNA and/or protein expression of several Csde1-bound transcripts that encode for proteins essential for translational regulation during hypoxia, such as Hmbs, eIF4g3 and Pabpc4. Also affected by Strap knockdown were Vim, a Gata-1 target crucial for erythrocyte enucleation, and Elavl1, which stabilizes Gata-1 mRNA. The major cellular processes affected by both Csde1 and Strap were ribosome function and cell cycle control."

This study aimed to determine if minodronate (MIN) treatment could prevent curve progression by increasing bone mass in a thoracic restraint (TR) mouse model, which develops causes the development of thoracic scoliosis similar to human AIS. A total of 100 young female C57BL6J mice were divided into four groups: (1) control with vehicle (CON/VEH; n = 20), (2) control with MIN (CON/MIN; n = 20), (3) TR with vehicle (TR/VEH; n = 30), or (4) TR with MIN (TR/MIN; n = 30). MIN (0.01 mg/kg/week) and vehicle were administered intraperitoneally to their respective groups. TR was performed at age 4 weeks, and the mice were sacrificed at age 9 weeks. Body weights, spine radiographs, femoral bone mineral density (BMD), serum bone marker levels, and histomorphometry of the cancellous bone of the thoracic vertebrae were analyzed. TR significantly reduced weight gain in the TR/VEH group relative to the CON/VEH group. TR also induced osteoporosis with accelerated bone resorption, as indicated by decreases in femoral BMDs and thoracic cancellous bone volume and increases in serum bone resorption marker levels and histomorphometric resorption parameters in the TR/VEH group. MIN partially improved body weight gain and improved poor bone structure relative to the TR/VEH group by suppressing high bone resorption in the TR/MIN mice. MIN significantly reduced the curve magnitudes, as indicated by a 43% lower curve magnitude in the TR/MIN mice than in the TR/VEH mice (17.9 ± 8.9° vs. 31.5 ± 13.1°; p< 0.001). The administration of MIN increased bone mass and reduced the severity of scoliosis in the TR mice. MIN was suggested as a possible inhibitor of scoliosis development."

The objective of this study was to determine the association between 9p21 genotypes and biomarkers of CVD risk in young adults from different ethnocultural groups.Subjects were 1,626 participants aged 20-29 years from the Toronto Nutrigenomics and Health Study. Fasting blood was collected to measure glucose, insulin, c-reactive protein and serum lipids, as well as to isolate DNA for genotyping subjects for five SNPs in 9p21. Analyses were conducted for the entire population and separately for women (n = 1,109), men (n = 517), Caucasians (n = 771), East Asians (n = 561) South Asians (n = 175) and Others (n = 119). ANOVA and ANCOVA were used to examine if 9p21 genotypes were associated with biomarkers of CVD risk.In the entire group, the risk alleles of rs10757278 and rs2383206 were associated with higher mean insulin (p = 0.01). Risk alleles for rs4977574, rs10757278, rs2383206, rs1333049 and rs10757274 were associated with higher serum insulin in women (p = 0.008, p = 0.008, p = 0.0003, p = 0.002, and p = 0.001, respectively), but not in men (p = 0.41, p = 0.13, p = 0.31, p = 0.34, and 0.35, respectively). The association between 9p21 and insulin remained significant among women not taking hormonal contraceptives (HC), but was not significant among women taking HCs.Our findings suggest that 9p21 genotypes may play a role in the development of insulin resistance in early adulthood among women, but not men, and the effects appear to be attenuated by HC use."
https://openalex.org/W2888629862,"To elucidate HIV-1 co-infection-induced acceleration of HCV liver disease and identify stage-specific molecular signatures, we applied a new high-resolution molecular screen, the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Transcriptome Array (HTA2.0), to HCV-mono- and HIV/HCV-co-infected liver specimens from subjects with early and advanced disease. Out of 67,528 well-annotated genes, we have analyzed the functional and statistical significance of 75 and 28 genes expressed differentially between early and advanced stages of HCV mono- and HIV/HCV co-infected patient liver samples, respectively. We also evaluated the expression of 25 and 17 genes between early stages of mono- and co-infected liver tissues and between advanced stages of mono- and co-infected patient’s samples, respectively. Based on our analysis of fold-change in gene expression as a function of disease stage (i.e., early vs. advanced), coupled with consideration of the known relevant functions of these genes, we focused on four candidate genes, ACSL4, GNMT, IFI27, and miR122, which are expressed stage-specifically in HCV mono- and HIV-1/HCV co-infective liver disease and are known to play a pivotal role in regulating HCV-mediated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our qRT-PCR analysis of the four genes in patient liver specimens supported the microarray data. Protein products of each gene were detected in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where HCV replication takes place, and the genes' expression significantly altered replicability of HCV in the subgenomic replicon harboring regulatory genes of the JFH1 strain of HCV in Huh7.5.1. With respect to three well-known transferrable HIV-1 viral elements—Env, Nef, and Tat—Nef uniquely augmented replicon expression, while Tat, but not the others, substantially modulated expression of the candidate genes in hepatocytic cells. Combinatorial expression of these cellular and viral genes in the replicon cells further altered replicon expression. Taken together, these results showed that HIV-1 viral proteins can exacerbate liver pathology in the co-infected patients by disparate molecular mechanisms—directly or indirectly dysregulating HCV replication, even if lack of association of HCV load and end-stage liver disease in hemophilic patients were reported, and modulating expression of hepatocellular genes critical for disease progression. These findings also provide major insights into development of stage-specific hepatocellular biomarkers for improved diagnosis and prognosis of HCV-mediated liver disease."
https://openalex.org/W2888190831,"Because of the importance of bone in the biomedical, forensic and archaeological contexts, new investigation techniques are constantly required to better characterize bone ultrastructure. In the present paper, we provide an extended investigation of the vibrational features of bone tissue in the 0.1-3 THz frequency range by time-domain THz spectroscopy. Their assignment is supported by a combination of X-ray diffraction and DFT-normal modes calculations. We investigate the effect of heating on bone tissue and synthetic calcium-phosphates compounds with close structure and composition to bone mineral, including stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric hydroxyapatite (HA), tricalcium phosphate, calcium pyrophosphate and tetracalcium phosphate. We thus demonstrate that the narrow vibrational mode at 2.1 THz in bone samples exposed to thermal treatment above 750 °C arises from a lattice mode of stoichiometric HA. This feature is also observed in the other synthetic compounds, although weaker or broader, but is completely smeared out in the non-stoichiometric HA, close to natural bone mineral composition, or in synthetic poorly crystalline HA powder. The THz spectral range therefore provides a clear signature of the crystalline state of the investigated bone tissue and could, therefore be used to monitor or identify structural transitions occurring in bone upon heating."
https://openalex.org/W2888117368,"In the past four decades, there has been an increase in the occurrence of zoonotic diseases. Some outbreaks have been devastating because of the inability of individuals and health workers to identify the diseases early. Generally, most zoonotic diseases are heralded by a fever. While fevers are common, they are often the symptoms of different diseases. This paper explores how a population at potential risk of zoonotic diseases identify fevers, and what treatments they seek when they develop fevers. The data are from focus group discussions and a survey of three communities in the Brong Ahafo, Volta and Greater Accra regions in Ghana. The quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics while the qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. The findings indicate that the perceived causes of fever differ from the traditional biomedical view. While orthodox treatment was the preferred choice for most participants, rural dwellers utilised traditional medicine more than their urban counterparts. Though there is no record of bat-borne zoonotic disease in Ghana, our findings could be used as a proxy to indicate how populations at risk of exposure might respond in the event of a spillover event from a zoonosis. We recommend that educational campaigns on zoonotic diseases should target rural dwellers, especially farmers, who may be most at risk of zoonoses."
https://openalex.org/W2888394088,"In general, the Attitudes toward Sexual Behaviors (ASB) or Sexual Attitudes measures have not been focused in the conjoint measurement of persons and items in the same construct, and have not reflected the new sexual behaviors neither the context where sexual behaviors take place. The purpose of this study was to provide evidence of the validity of a theoretical model for the measurement of ASB using the person-item map provided by a Rasch model. The theoretical model explicitly defines the ASB construct and makes a proposal where the items are intensity-ordered. It also considers the context in which sexual behaviors take place and their new ways of expression. ASB measurement was applied to two samples of 300 and 584 young people aged 18 to 30. Content of the ASB test administered includes the operative definition proposed. The results showed a good fit of the data to the model, and adequate measurement accuracy. The person-item maps showed that the items are distributed according to the theoretical model proposed in both samples. The easiest items for participants to endorse are those reflecting frequent dyadic sexual behaviors with a steady partner, and the hardest items for participants to endorse are those reflecting sexual behaviors via Information and Communication Technologies. The obtained results permit to conclude that there is favorable validity evidence for the theoretical model proposed for measuring ASB in heterosexual young people."
https://openalex.org/W2951195131,"A model of B cell affinity selection is proposed, and an explanation of peripheral tolerance mechanisms through antibody repertoire editing is presented. We show that affinity discrimination between B cells is driven by a competition between obtaining T cell help and removal of B cells from the light zone, either through apoptosis or by a return to the dark zone of germinal centers. We demonstrate that this mechanism also allows for the negative selection of self reactive B cells and maintenance of B cell tolerance during the Germinal Center reaction. Finally, we demonstrate that clonal expansion upon return to the Germinal Center dark zone amplifies differences in the antigen affinity of B cells that survive the light zone."
https://openalex.org/W2888221936,"We describe a methodology for assessing agreement and reliability among a set of shapes. Motivated by recent studies of the reliability of manually segmented medical images, we focus on shapes composed of rasterized, binary-valued data representing closed geometric regions of interest. The methodology naturally generalizes to N dimensions and other data types, though. We formulate the shape variance, shape correlation and shape intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) in terms of a simple distance metric, the Manhattan norm, which quantifies the absolute difference between any two shapes. We demonstrate applications of this methodology by working through example shape variance calculations in 1-D, for the analysis of overlapping line segments, and 2-D, for the analysis of overlapping regions. We also report the results of a simulated reliability analysis of manually delineated shape boundaries, and we compare the shape ICC with the more conventional and commonly used area ICC. The proposed shape-sensitive methodology captures all of the variation in the shape measurements, and it provides a more accurate estimate of the measurement reliability than an analysis of only the measured areas."
https://openalex.org/W2888244947,"Micro-crystals of calcium phosphate have been detected on the aortic valve of patients with aortic stenosis using scanning electron microscopy. It is not known whether crystalisation is specific to heart valve tissue or a general blood-derived process.To this end we modified the method to determine whether calcium phosphate micro-crystals were present in the blood of patients with aortic stenosis. The method was first validated by adding synthetic calcium phosphate hydroxyapatite micro-crystals to healthy volunteer blood samples and determining the lower limit of detection. Then the method was used to examine the blood of 63 patients with echocardiographically confirmed aortic stenosis and 69 unaffected controls undergoing echocardiography for other reasons. Serum calcium and phosphate were measured and the calcium phosphate product compared in cases and controls.In the validation study, synthetic hydroxyapatite micro-crystals were identified down to a lower concentration limit of 0.008mg/mL. In the experimental study no particles were identified in any patient, with or without aortic stenosis, even though serum calcium phosphate was higher in cases compared with controls 2.6mmol/L (2.58-2.77) versus 2.47mmol/L (2.36-2.57), p = 0.005 for the difference.The results of our study confirm a positive association between serum calcium phosphate and aortic stenosis, but indicate that the calcium phosphate particles found in valve tissue do not precipitate freely in the blood."
