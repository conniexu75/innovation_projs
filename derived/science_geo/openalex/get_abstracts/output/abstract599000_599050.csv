https://openalex.org/W2767754645,"Indocyanine green (ICG), a FDA approved near infrared (NIR) fluorescent agent, is used in the clinic for a variety of applications including lymphangiography, intra-operative lymph node identification, tumor imaging, superficial vascular imaging, and marking ischemic tissues. These applications operate in the so-called “NIR-I” window (700–900 nm). Recently, imaging in the “NIR-II” window (1000–1700 nm) has attracted attention since, at longer wavelengths, photon absorption, and scattering effects by tissue components are reduced, making it possible to image deeper into the underlying tissue. Agents for NIR-II imaging are, however, still in pre-clinical development. In this study, we investigated ICG as a NIR-II dye. The absorbance and NIR-II fluorescence emission of ICG were measured in different media (PBS, plasma and ethanol) for a range of ICG concentrations. In vitro and in vivo testing were performed using a custom-built spectral NIR assembly to facilitate simultaneous imaging in NIR-I and NIR-II window. In vitro studies using ICG were performed using capillary tubes (as a simulation of blood vessels) embedded in Intralipid solution and tissue phantoms to evaluate depth of tissue penetration in NIR-I and NIR-II window. In vivo imaging using ICG was performed in nude mice to evaluate vascular visualization in the hind limb in the NIR-I and II windows. Contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) were calculated for comparison of image quality in NIR-I and NIR-II window. ICG exhibited significant fluorescence emission in the NIR-II window and this emission (similar to the absorption profile) is substantially affected by the environment of the ICG molecules. In vivo imaging further confirmed the utility of ICG as a fluorescent dye in the NIR-II domain, with the CNR values being ~2 times those in the NIR-I window. The availability of an FDA approved imaging agent could accelerate the clinical translation of NIR-II imaging technology."
https://openalex.org/W2767744847,"Objective Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), likely prevent cardiovascular disease, however their mechanisms remain unclear. Recently, the role of DNA damage in atherogenesis has been receiving considerable attention. Here, we investigated the effects of EPA and DHA on DNA damage in vascular endothelial cells to clarify their antiatherogenic mechanisms. Methods and results We determined the effect of EPA and DHA on H2O2-induced DNA damage response in human aortic endothelial cells. Immunofluorescence staining showed that γ-H2AX foci formation, a prominent marker of DNA damage, was significantly reduced in the cells treated with EPA and DHA (by 47% and 48%, respectively). H2O2-induced activation of ATM, a major kinase orchestrating DNA damage response, was significantly reduced with EPA and DHA treatment (by 31% and 33%, respectively). These results indicated EPA and DHA attenuated DNA damage independently of the DNA damage response. Thus the effects of EPA and DHA on a source of DNA damage were examined. EPA and DHA significantly reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species under both basal condition and H2O2 stimulation. In addition, the mRNA levels of antioxidant molecules, such as heme oxygenase-1, thioredoxin reductase 1, ferritin light chain, ferritin heavy chain and manganese superoxide dismutase, were significantly increased with EPA and DHA. Silencing nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) remarkably abrogated the increases in mRNA levels of antioxidant molecules and the decrease in intracellular reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, EPA and DHA significantly reduced H2O2-induced senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity in the cells (by 31% and 22%, respectively), which was revoked by NRF2 silencing. Conclusions Our results suggested that EPA and DHA attenuate oxidative stress-induced DNA damage in vascular endothelial cells through upregulation of NRF2-mediated antioxidant response. Therefore omega-3 fatty acids likely help prevent cardiovascular disease, at least in part, by their genome protective properties."
https://openalex.org/W2767524017,"Immune evasion is a well-recognized hallmark of cancer and recent studies with immunotherapy agents have suggested that tumors with increased numbers of neoantigens elicit greater immune responses. We hypothesized that the immune system presents a common selective pressure on high mutation burden tumors and therefore immune evasion mutations would be enriched in high mutation burden tumors. The JAK family of kinases is required for the signaling of a host of immune modulators in tumor, stromal, and immune cells. Therefore, we analyzed alterations in this family for the hypothesized signature of an immune evasion mutation. Here, we searched a database of 61,704 unique solid tumors for alterations in the JAK family kinases (JAK1/2/3, TYK2). We used The Cancer Genome Atlas and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia data to confirm and extend our findings by analyzing gene expression patterns. Recurrent frameshift mutations in JAK1 were associated with high mutation burden and microsatellite instability. These mutations occurred in multiple tumor types including endometrial, colorectal, stomach, and prostate carcinomas. Analyzing gene expression signatures in endometrial and stomach adenocarcinomas revealed that tumors with a JAK1 frameshift exhibited reduced expression of interferon response signatures and multiple anti-tumor immune signatures. Importantly, endometrial cancer cell lines exhibited similar gene expression changes that were expected to be tumor cell intrinsic (e.g. interferon response) but not those expected to be tumor cell extrinsic (e.g. NK cells). From these data, we derive two primary conclusions: 1) JAK1 frameshifts are loss of function alterations that represent a potential pan-cancer adaptation to immune responses against tumors with microsatellite instability; 2) The mechanism by which JAK1 loss of function contributes to tumor immune evasion is likely associated with loss of the JAK1-mediated interferon response."
https://openalex.org/W2767914748,"Habitat suitability models are useful to understand species distribution and to guide management and conservation strategies. The grey wolf (Canis lupus) has been extirpated from most of its historic range in Pakistan primarily due to its impact on livestock and livelihoods. We used non-invasive survey data from camera traps and genetic sampling to develop a habitat suitability model for C. lupus in northern Pakistan and to explore the extent of connectivity among populations. We detected suitable habitat of grey wolf using a maximum entropy approach (Maxent ver. 3.4.0) and identified suitable movement corridors using the Circuitscape 4.0 tool. Our model showed high levels of predictive performances, as seen from the values of area under curve (0.971±0.002) and true skill statistics (0.886±0.021). The main predictors for habitat suitability for C. lupus were distances to road, mean temperature of the wettest quarter and distance to river. The model predicted ca. 23,129 km2 of suitable areas for wolf in Pakistan, with much of suitable habitat in remote and inaccessible areas that appeared to be well connected through vulnerable movement corridors. These movement corridors suggest that potentially the wolf range can expand in Pakistan's Northern Areas. However, managing protected areas with stringent restrictions is challenging in northern Pakistan, in part due to heavy dependence of people on natural resources. The habitat suitability map provided by this study can inform future management strategies by helping authorities to identify key conservation areas."
https://openalex.org/W4210411794,"Background The 1-hour (h) algorithm triages patients presenting with suspected acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to the emergency department (ED) towards “rule-out,” “rule-in,” or “observation,” depending on baseline and 1-h levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn). The economic consequences of applying the accelerated 1-h algorithm are unknown. Methods and findings We performed a post-hoc economic analysis in a large, diagnostic, multicenter study of hs-cTnT using central adjudication of the final diagnosis by two independent cardiologists. Length of stay (LoS), resource utilization (RU), and predicted diagnostic accuracy of the 1-h algorithm compared to standard of care (SoC) in the ED were estimated. The ED LoS, RU, and accuracy of the 1-h algorithm was compared to that achieved by the SoC at ED discharge. Expert opinion was sought to characterize clinical implementation of the 1-h algorithm, which required blood draws at ED presentation and 1h, after which “rule-in” patients were transferred for coronary angiography, “rule-out” patients underwent outpatient stress testing, and “observation” patients received SoC. Unit costs were for the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Germany. The sensitivity and specificity for the 1-h algorithm were 87% and 96%, respectively, compared to 69% and 98% for SoC. The mean ED LoS for the 1-h algorithm was 4.3h—it was 6.5h for SoC, which is a reduction of 33%. The 1-h algorithm was associated with reductions in RU, driven largely by the shorter LoS in the ED for patients with a diagnosis other than AMI. The estimated total costs per patient were £2,480 for the 1-h algorithm compared to £4,561 for SoC, a reduction of up to 46%. Conclusions The analysis shows that the use of 1-h algorithm is associated with reduction in overall AMI diagnostic costs, provided it is carefully implemented in clinical practice. These results need to be prospectively validated in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2767823042,"Identification of central genes and proteins in biomolecular networks provides credible candidates for pathway analysis, functional analysis, and essentiality prediction. The DiffSLC centrality measure predicts central and essential genes and proteins using a protein-protein interaction network. Network centrality measures prioritize nodes and edges based on their importance to the network topology. These measures helped identify critical genes and proteins in biomolecular networks. The proposed centrality measure, DiffSLC, combines the number of interactions of a protein and the gene coexpression values of genes from which those proteins were translated, as a weighting factor to bias the identification of essential proteins in a protein interaction network. Potentially essential proteins with low node degree are promoted through eigenvector centrality. Thus, the gene coexpression values are used in conjunction with the eigenvector of the network’s adjacency matrix and edge clustering coefficient to improve essentiality prediction. The outcome of this prediction is shown using three variations: (1) inclusion or exclusion of gene co-expression data, (2) impact of different coexpression measures, and (3) impact of different gene expression data sets. For a total of seven networks, DiffSLC is compared to other centrality measures using Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein interaction networks and gene expression data. Comparisons are also performed for the top ranked proteins against the known essential genes from the Saccharomyces Gene Deletion Project, which show that DiffSLC detects more essential proteins and has a higher area under the ROC curve than other compared methods. This makes DiffSLC a stronger alternative to other centrality methods for detecting essential genes using a protein-protein interaction network that obeys centrality-lethality principle. DiffSLC is implemented using the igraph package in R, and networkx package in Python. The python package can be obtained from git.io/diffslcpy. The R implementation and code to reproduce the analysis is available via git.io/diffslc."
https://openalex.org/W2767676582,"Motorsport has developed into a professional international competition. However, limited research is available on the perceptual and cognitive skills of racing drivers. By means of a racing simulator, we compared the driving performance of seven racing drivers with ten non-racing drivers. Participants were tasked to drive the fastest possible lap time. Additionally, both groups completed a choice reaction time task and a tracking task. Results from the simulator showed faster lap times, higher steering activity, and a more optimal racing line for the racing drivers than for the non-racing drivers. The non-racing drivers’ gaze behavior corresponded to the tangent point model, whereas racing drivers showed a more variable gaze behavior combined with larger head rotations while cornering. Results from the choice reaction time task and tracking task showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Our results are consistent with the current consensus in sports sciences in that task-specific differences exist between experts and novices while there are no major differences in general cognitive and motor abilities."
https://openalex.org/W2767701890,"Portable direct-reading instruments by light-scattering method are increasingly used in airborne fine particulate matter (PM2.5) monitoring. However, there are limited calibration studies on such instruments by applying the gravimetric method as reference method in field tests.An 8-month sampling was performed and 96 pairs of PM2.5 data by both the gravimetric method and the simultaneous light-scattering real-time monitoring (QT-50) were obtained from July, 2015 to February, 2016 in Shanghai. Temperature and relative humidity (RH) were recorded. Mann-Whitney U nonparametric test and Spearman correlation were used to investigate the differences between the two measurements. Multiple linear regression (MLR) model was applied to set up the calibration model for the light-scattering device.The average PM2.5 concentration (median) was 48.1μg/m3 (min-max 10.4-95.8μg/m3) by the gravimetric method and 58.1μg/m3 (19.2-315.9μg/m3) by the light-scattering method, respectively. By time trend analyses, they were significantly correlated with each other (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.889, P<0.01). By MLR, the calibration model for the light-scattering instrument was Y(calibrated) = 57.45 + 0.47 × X(the QT - 50 measurements) - 0.53 × RH - 0.41 × Temp with both RH and temperature adjusted. The 10-fold cross-validation R2 and the root mean squared error of the calibration model were 0.79 and 11.43 μg/m3, respectively.Light-scattering measurements of PM2.5 by QT-50 instrument overestimated the concentration levels and were affected by temperature and RH. The calibration model for QT-50 instrument was firstly set up against the gravimetric method with temperature and RH adjusted."
https://openalex.org/W2767344512,"Adverse drug events (ADEs) are unintended responses to medical treatment. They can greatly affect a patient’s quality of life and present a substantial burden on healthcare. Although Electronic health records (EHRs) document a wealth of information relating to ADEs, they are frequently stored in the unstructured or semi-structured free-text narrative requiring Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to mine the relevant information. Here we present a rule-based ADE detection and classification pipeline built and tested on a large Psychiatric corpus comprising 264k patients using the de-identified EHRs of four UK-based psychiatric hospitals. The pipeline uses characteristics specific to Psychiatric EHRs to guide the annotation process, and distinguishes: a) the temporal value associated with the ADE mention (whether it is historical or present), b) the categorical value of the ADE (whether it is assertive, hypothetical, retrospective or a general discussion) and c) the implicit contextual value where the status of the ADE is deduced from surrounding indicators, rather than explicitly stated. We manually created the rulebase in collaboration with clinicians and pharmacists by studying ADE mentions in various types of clinical notes. We evaluated the open-source Adverse Drug Event annotation Pipeline (ADEPt) using 19 ADEs specific to antipsychotics and antidepressants medication. The ADEs chosen vary in severity, regularity and persistence. The average F-measure and accuracy achieved by our tool across all tested ADEs were 0.83 and 0.83 respectively. In addition to annotation power, the ADEPT pipeline presents an improvement to the state of the art context-discerning algorithm, ConText."
https://openalex.org/W2767742670,"We investigated relations between experience driving physical automobiles and motion sickness during the driving of virtual automobiles. Middle-aged individuals drove a virtual automobile in a driving video game. Drivers were individuals who had possessed a driver's license for approximately 30 years, and who drove regularly, while non-drivers were individuals who had never held a driver's license, or who had not driven for more than 15 years. During virtual driving, we monitored movement of the head and torso. During virtual driving, drivers became motion sick more rapidly than non-drivers, but the incidence and severity of motion sickness did not differ as a function of driving experience. Patterns of movement during virtual driving differed as a function of driving experience. Separately, movement differed between participants who later became motion sick and those who did not. Most importantly, physical driving experience influenced patterns of postural activity that preceded motion sickness during virtual driving. The results are consistent with the postural instability theory of motion sickness, and help to illuminate relations between the control of physical and virtual vehicles."
https://openalex.org/W2767584895,"Background Tafenoquine is an investigational 8-aminoquinoline for the prevention of Plasmodium vivax relapse. Tafenoquine has a long half-life and the potential for more convenient dosing, compared with the currently recommended 14-day primaquine regimen. Methods This randomized, active-control, double-blind trial was conducted in Bangkok, Thailand. Seventy patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax were randomized (2:1) to tafenoquine 400 mg once daily for 3 days or 2500 mg total dose chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg chloroquine base) given over 3 days plus primaquine 15 mg daily for 14 days. Patients were followed to day 120. Results Day 28 adequate clinical response rate in the per-protocol population was 93% (40/43) (90%CI 83–98%) with tafenoquine, and 100% (22/22) (90%CI 87–100%) with chloroquine/primaquine. Day 120 relapse prevention was 100% (35/35) with tafenoquine (90%CI 92–100%), and 95% (19/20) (90%CI 78–100%) with chloroquine/primaquine. Mean (SD) parasite, gametocyte and fever clearance times with tafenoquine were 82.5 h (32.3), 49.1 h (33.0), and 41.1 h (31.4) versus 40.0 h (15.7), 22.7 h (16.4), and 24.7 h (17.7) with chloroquine/primaquine, respectively. Peak methemoglobin was 1.4–25.6% (median 7.4%, mean 9.1%) in the tafenoquine arm, and 0.5–5.9% (median 1.5%, mean 1.9%) in the chloroquine/primaquine arm. There were no clinical symptoms of methemoglobinemia in any patient. Discussion Although there was no difference in efficacy in this study, the slow rate of parasite, gametocyte and fever clearance indicates that tafenoquine should not be used as monotherapy for radical cure of P. vivax malaria. Also, monotherapy increases the potential risk of resistance developing to this long-acting agent. Clinical trials of single-dose tafenoquine 300 mg combined with standard 3-day chloroquine or artemisinin-based combination therapy are ongoing. Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01290601"
https://openalex.org/W2768082288,"Objective In order to search for metabolic biomarkers of antihypertensive drug responsiveness, we measured >600 biochemicals in plasma samples of subjects participating in the GENRES Study. Hypertensive men received in a double-blind rotational fashion amlodipine, bisoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide and losartan, each as a monotherapy for one month, with intervening one-month placebo cycles. Methods Metabolomic analysis was carried out using ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Full metabolomic signatures (the drug cycles and the mean of the 3 placebo cycles) became available in 38 to 42 patients for each drug. Blood pressure was monitored by 24-h recordings. Results Amlodipine (P values down to 0.002), bisoprolol (P values down to 2 x 10−5) and losartan (P values down to 2 x 10−4) consistently decreased the circulating levels of long-chain acylcarnitines. Bisoprolol tended to decrease (P values down to 0.002) the levels of several medium- and long-chain fatty acids. Hydrochlorothiazide administration was associated with an increase of plasma uric acid level (P = 5 x 10-4) and urea cycle metabolites. Decreases of both systolic (P = 0.06) and diastolic (P = 0.04) blood pressure after amlodipine administration tended to associate with a decrease of plasma hexadecanedioate, a dicarboxylic fatty acid recently linked to blood pressure regulation. Conclusions Although this systematic metabolomics study failed to identify circulating metabolites convincingly predicting favorable antihypertensive response to four different drug classes, it provided accumulating evidence linking fatty acid metabolism to human hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2617139078,"We study the changes of opinions about vaccination together with the evolution of a disease. In our model we consider a multiplex network consisting of two layers. One of the layers corresponds to a social network where people share their opinions and influence others opinions. The social model that rules the dynamic is the M-model, which takes into account two different processes that occurs in a society: persuasion and compromise. This two processes are related through a parameter $r$, $r<1$ describes a moderate and committed society, for $r>1$ the society tends to have extremist opinions, while $r=1$ represents a neutral society. This social network may be of real or virtual contacts. On the other hand, the second layer corresponds to a network of physical contacts where the disease spreading is described by the SIR-Model. In this model the individuals may be in one of the following four states: Susceptible ($S$), Infected($I$), Recovered ($R$) or Vaccinated ($V$). A Susceptible individual can: i) get vaccinated, if his opinion in the other layer is totally in favor of the vaccine, ii) get infected, with probability $\beta$ if he is in contact with an infected neighbor. Those $I$ individuals recover after a certain period $t_r=6$. Vaccinated individuals have an extremist positive opinion that does not change. We consider that the vaccine has a certain effectiveness $\omega$ and as a consequence vaccinated nodes can be infected with probability $\beta (1 - \omega)$ if they are in contact with an infected neighbor. In this case, if the infection process is successful, the new infected individual changes his opinion from extremist positive to totally against the vaccine. We find that depending on the trend in the opinion of the society, which depends on $r$, different behaviors in the spread of the epidemic occurs. An epidemic threshold was found."
https://openalex.org/W2767493939,"The lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are chronically colonized by a polymicrobial biofilm community, leading to difficult-to-treat infections. To combat these infections, CF patients are commonly treated with a variety of antibiotics. Understanding the dynamics of polymicrobial community composition in response to antibiotic therapy is essential in the search for novel therapies. Culture-dependent quantification of individual bacteria from defined multispecies biofilms is frequently carried out by plating on selective media. However, the influence of the selective agents in these media on quantitative recovery before or after antibiotic treatment is often unknown. In the present study we developed selective media for six bacterial species that are frequently co-isolated from the CF lung, i.e. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Rothia mucilaginosa, and Gemella haemolysans. We show that certain supplementations to selective media strongly influence quantitative recovery of (un)treated biofilms. Hence, the developed media were optimized for selectivity and quantitative recovery before or after treatment with antibiotics of four major classes, i.e. ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, colistin, or tobramycin. Finally, in a proof of concept experiment the novel selective media were applied to determine the community composition of multispecies biofilms before and after treatment with tobramycin."
https://openalex.org/W2767909144,"Motivation Human voice is generated in the larynx by the two oscillating vocal folds. Owing to the limited space and accessibility of the larynx, endoscopic investigation of the actual phonatory process in detail is challenging. Hence the biomechanics of the human phonatory process are still not yet fully understood. Therefore, we adapt a mathematical model of the vocal folds towards vocal fold oscillations to quantify gender and age related differences expressed by computed biomechanical model parameters. Methods The vocal fold dynamics are visualized by laryngeal high-speed videoendoscopy (4000 fps). A total of 33 healthy young subjects (16 females, 17 males) and 11 elderly subjects (5 females, 6 males) were recorded. A numerical two-mass model is adapted to the recorded vocal fold oscillations by varying model masses, stiffness and subglottal pressure. For adapting the model towards the recorded vocal fold dynamics, three different optimization algorithms (Nelder–Mead, Particle Swarm Optimization and Simulated Bee Colony) in combination with three cost functions were considered for applicability. Gender differences and age-related kinematic differences reflected by the model parameters were analyzed. Results and conclusion The biomechanical model in combination with numerical optimization techniques allowed phonatory behavior to be simulated and laryngeal parameters involved to be quantified. All three optimization algorithms showed promising results. However, only one cost function seems to be suitable for this optimization task. The gained model parameters reflect the phonatory biomechanics for men and women well and show quantitative age- and gender-specific differences. The model parameters for younger females and males showed lower subglottal pressures, lower stiffness and higher masses than the corresponding elderly groups. Females exhibited higher subglottal pressures, smaller oscillation masses and larger stiffness than the corresponding similar aged male groups. Optimizing numerical models towards vocal fold oscillations is useful to identify underlying laryngeal components controlling the phonatory process."
https://openalex.org/W2767800527,"Women have an increased risk of pulmonary hypertension (PH) but better survival compared to men. Few studies have explored sex-based differences in population-based cohorts with PH. We sought to determine whether sex was associated with hemodynamics and survival in US veterans with PH (mean pulmonary artery pressure [mPAP] ≥ 25 mm Hg) from the Veterans Affairs Clinical Assessment, Reporting, and Tracking database. The relationship between sex and hemodynamics was assessed with multivariable linear mixed modeling. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare survival by sex for those with PH and precapillary PH (mPAP ≥ 25 mm Hg, pulmonary artery wedge pressure [PAWP] ≤ 15 mm Hg and pulmonary vascular resistance [PVR] > 3 Wood units) respectively. The study population included 15,464 veterans with PH, 516 (3%) of whom were women; 1,942 patients (13%) had precapillary PH, of whom 120 (6%) were women. Among those with PH, women had higher PVR and pulmonary artery pulse pressure, and lower right atrial pressure and PAWP (all p <0.001) compared with men. There were no significant differences in hemodynamics according to sex in veterans with precapillary PH. Women with PH had 18% greater survival compared to men with PH (adjusted HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69–0.97, p = 0.020). Similarly, women with precapillary PH were 29% more likely to survive as compared to men with PH (adjusted HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52–0.98, p = 0.040). In conclusion, female veterans with PH have better survival than males despite higher pulmonary afterload."
https://openalex.org/W2767954098,"There are concerns that the reported association of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) with mortality might be a mixture of PM2.5 and weather conditions. We evaluated the effects of extreme weather conditions and weather types on mortality as well as their interactions with PM2.5 concentrations in a time series study. Daily non-accidental deaths, individual demographic information, daily average PM2.5 concentrations and meteorological data between 2012 and 2014 were obtained from Shanghai, China. Days with extreme weather conditions were identified. Six synoptic weather types (SWTs) were generated. The generalized additive model was set up to link the mortality with PM2.5 and weather conditions. Parameter estimation was based on Bayesian methods using both the Jeffreys' prior and an informative normal prior in a sensitivity analysis. We estimate the percent increase in non-accidental mortality per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration and constructed corresponding 95% credible interval (CrI). In total, 336,379 non-accidental deaths occurred during the study period. Average daily deaths were 307. The results indicated that per 10 μg/m3 increase in daily average PM2.5 concentration alone corresponded to 0.26-0.35% increase in daily non-accidental mortality in Shanghai. Statistically significant positive associations between PM2.5 and mortality were found for favorable SWTs when considering the interaction between PM2.5 and SWTs. The greatest effect was found in hot dry SWT (percent increase = 1.28, 95% CrI: 0.72, 1.83), followed by warm humid SWT (percent increase = 0.64, 95% CrI: 0.15, 1.13). The effect of PM2.5 on non-accidental mortality differed under specific extreme weather conditions and SWTs. Environmental policies and actions should take into account the interrelationship between the two hazardous exposures."
https://openalex.org/W2767220611,"Parrot bornaviruses (PaBVs) are the causative agents of proventricular dilatation disease, however key aspects of its pathogenesis, such as route of infection, viral spread and distribution, and target cells remain unclear. Our study aimed to track the viral spread and lesion development at 5, 10, 20, 25, 35, 40, 60, 80, 95 and 114 dpi using histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and RT-PCR. After intramuscular inoculation of parrot bornavirus 2 (PaBV-2) in the pectoral muscle of cockatiels, this virus was first detected in macrophages and lymphocytes in the inoculation site and adjacent nerves, then reached the brachial plexus, centripetally spread to the thoracic segment of the spinal cord, and subsequently invaded the other spinal segments and brain. After reaching the central nervous system (CNS), PaBV-2 centrifugally spread out the CNS to the ganglia in the gastrointestinal (GI) system, adrenal gland, heart, and kidneys. At late points of infection, PaBV-2 was not only detected in nerves and ganglia but widespread in the smooth muscle and/or scattered epithelial cells of tissues such as crop, intestines, proventriculus, kidneys, skin, and vessels. Despite the hallmark lesion of PaBVs infection being the dilation of the proventriculus, our results demonstrate PaBV-2 first targets the CNS, before migrating to peripheral tissues such as the GI system."
https://openalex.org/W2768023652,"This study focuses on the population trends of two widespread European anuran species: the common toad (Bufo bufo) and the common frog (Rana temporaria). The basis of this study is data gathered over two decades of amphibian fencing alongside roads in the Austrian state of Salzburg. Different statistical approaches were used to analyse the data. Overall average increase or decrease of each species was estimated by calculating a simple average locality index. In addition the statistical software TRIM was used to verify these trends as well as to categorize the data based on the geographic location of each migration site. The results show differing overall trends for the two species: the common toad being stable and the common frog showing a substantial decline over the last two decades. Further analyses based on geographic categorization reveal the strongest decrease in the alpine range of the species. Drainage and agricultural intensification are still ongoing problems within alpine areas, not only in Salzburg. Particularly in respect to micro-climate and the availability of spawning places these changes appear to have a greater impact on the habitats of the common frog than the common toad. Therefore we consider habitat destruction to be the main potential reason behind this dramatic decline. We also conclude that the substantial loss of biomass of a widespread species such as the common frog must have a severe, and often overlooked, ecological impact."
https://openalex.org/W2767376376,"Background and aims An intra-islet incretin system has been recently suggested to operate through modulation of the expression and activity of proconvertase 1/3 and 2 (PC1/3, PC2) in pancreatic alpha-cell accounting for local release of GLP-1. Little is known, whether this alpha-cell activity can be affected by the metabolic alterations occurring in type 2 diabetes, such as hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia or hyperglucagonemia. Materials and methods AlphaTC1/6 cells from a mice pancreatic cell line were incubated in the presence of two glucose (G) concentration (5.5 and 16.7 mM) for 16 h with or without free fatty acid, IL6 or glucagon. GLP-1 secretion was measured by ELISA and expression of PC1/3 and PC2 by RT-PCR and western blot; cell viability was determined by MTT method, Reactive Oxygen Species generation (ROS) by H2DCFDA fluorescence and apoptosis by Annexin staining and Propidium Iodine (PI) fluorescence. Results Upon 16.7G incubation, GLP-1 secretion (total and active) was significantly increased in parallel with a significant increment in PC1/3 expression, a slight increase in cell viability and ROS generation and by a decrement in PC2 expression with no change in cell apoptosis. When cells were incubated at 5.5mM glucose with FFA, also an increment in GLP-1 secretion and PC1/3 expression was observed together an increment in ROS generation, a decrement in cell viability, and a modest increment in apoptosis. When incubated with 16.7mM glucose with FFA, the increment in GLP-1 secretion was reduced to basal, accompanied by an increment in apoptosis and ROS generation. This was also observed with IL-6, but in this case, no modification in ROS generation or apoptosis was observed when compared to 16.7mM glucose. The presence of glucagon did not modify any of the parameters studied. Conclusion These data suggest that under hyperglycemic, hyperlipidemia or inflammatory conditions, alpha cells can increase expression PC1/3 and activate GLP-1 secretion, which may contribute protecting both alpha and beta-cells from glucose and lipotoxicity, while this effect seems to be lost in the presence of both pathophysiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2767500718,"Moringa oleifera (MO) and M. stenopetala (MS) are two commonly cultivated species of the Moringaceae family. Some households in southern Ethiopia (S. ETH) and Kenya (KEN) plant MS and MO, respectively. The edible parts of these species are rich in amino acids, vitamins and minerals, especially selenium. Despite their nutritional value, Moringa is sometimes considered as a ""famine food"". The aim of this study was to determine the extent of dietary utilization of these plants by Moringa Growing Households (MGHs). Moringa growing households were surveyed in 2015. Twenty-four and 56 heads of MGHs from S. ETH and KEN, respectively, were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires. Subsistence agriculture was the main source of livelihood for all MGHs in S. ETH and 71% of those in KEN. All MGHs in S. ETH cultivated MS while those in KEN cultivated MO. Of the MGH heads in S. ETH, 71% had grown MS as long as they remember; the median cultivation period of MO in KEN was 15 years. All MGHs in S. ETH and 79% in KEN used Moringa leaves as a source of food. Forms of consumption of leaves were boiled fresh leaves, and leaf powder used in tea or mixed with other dishes. Other uses of Moringa include as medicine, fodder, shade, agroforestry, and as a source of income. Although MO and MS have multiple uses, MGHs face several challenges, including a lack of reliable information on nutritional and medicinal values, inadequate access to markets for their products, and pest and disease stresses to their plants. Research and development to address these challenges and to promote the use of these species in the fight against hidden hunger are necessary."

The risk factors and mechanisms that contribute to the development of micro- and macrovascular disease in diabetes are not fully explained. In this study, we employed mass spectrometric analysis using tandem LC-MS/MS to generate a proteomic profile of protein abundance and post-translational modifications (PTM) in the aorta and kidney of diabetic rats. In addition, systems biology analyses were employed to identify key protein markers that can provide insights into molecular pathways and processes that are differentially regulated in the aorta and kidney of type 1 diabetic rats. Our results indicated that 188 (111 downregulated and 77 upregulated) proteins were significantly identified in the aorta of diabetic rats compared to normal controls. A total of 223 (109 downregulated and 114 upregulated) proteins were significantly identified in the kidney of diabetic rats compared to normal controls. When the protein profiles from the kidney and aorta of diabetic and control rats were analyzed by principal component analysis, a distinct separation of the groups was observed. In addition, diabetes resulted in a significant increase in PTM (oxidation, phosphorylation, and acetylation) of proteins in the kidney and aorta and this effect was partially reversed by insulin treatment. Ingenuity pathway analysis performed on the list of differentially expressed proteins depicted mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative phosphorylation and acute phase response signaling to be among the altered canonical pathways by diabetes in both tissues. The findings of the present study provide a global proteomics view of markers that highlight the mechanisms and putative processes that modulate renal and vascular injury in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2767232640,"Islet transplantation is a useful cell replacement therapy that can restore the glycometabolic function of severe diabetic patients. It is known that many transplanted islets failed to engraft, and thus, new approaches for overcoming graft loss that may improve the outcome of future clinical islet transplantations are necessary. Pleckstrin homology-like domain family A, member 3 (PHLDA3) is a known suppressor of neuroendocrine tumorigenicity, yet deficiency of this gene increases islet proliferation, prevents islet apoptosis, and improves their insulin-releasing function without causing tumors. In this study, we examined the potential use of PHLDA3-deficient islets in transplantation. We observed that: 1) transplanting PHLDA3-deficient islets into diabetic mice significantly improved their glycometabolic condition, 2) the improved engraftment of PHLDA3-deficient islets resulted from increased cell survival during early transplantation, and 3) Akt activity was elevated in PHLDA3-deficient islets, especially under hypoxic conditions. Thus, we determined that PHLDA3-deficient islets are more resistant against stresses induced by islet isolation and transplantation. We conclude that use of islets with suppressed PHLDA3 expression could be a novel and promising treatment for improving engraftment and consequent glycemic control in islet transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2767498002,"Prolonged air leak (PAL), defined as air leak more than 5 days after lung resection, has been associated with various adverse outcomes. However, studies on intraoperative risk factors for PAL are not sufficient. We investigated whether the intraoperative ventilatory leak (VL) can predict PAL. A retrospective study of 1060 patients with chest tubes after lung resection was conducted. Tidal volume data were retrieved from the electronic anesthesia records. Ventilatory leak (%) was calculated as [(inspiratory tidal volume—expiratory tidal volume)/ inspiratory tidal volume × 100] and was measured after restart of two-lung ventilation. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed using VL as a predictor, and PAL as the dependent outcome. The odds ratio of the VL was then adjusted by adding possible risk factors including patient characteristics, pulmonary function and surgical factors. The incidence of PAL was 18.7%. VL >9.5% was a significant predictor of PAL in univariable analysis. VL remained significant as a predictor of PAL (1.59, 95% CI, 1.37–1.85, P <0.001) after adjusting for 7 additional risk factors including male gender, age >60 years, body mass index <21.5 kg/m2, forced expiratory volume in 1 sec <80%, thoracotomy, major lung resection, and one-lung ventilation time >2.1 hours. C-statistic of the prediction model was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.77–0.82). In conclusion, VL was a quantitative measure of intraoperative air leakage and an independent predictor of postoperative PAL. Monitoring VL during lung resection may be uselful in recommending additional surgical repair or use of adjuncts and thus, help reduce postoperative PAL."
https://openalex.org/W2767686897,"Sexual segregation, or the differential use of space by males and females, is hypothesized to be a function of body size dimorphism. Sexual segregation can also manifest at small (social segregation) and large (habitat segregation) spatial scales for a variety of reasons. Furthermore, the connection between small- and large-scale sexual segregation has rarely been addressed. We studied a population of Roosevelt elk (Cervus elaphus roosevelti) across 21 years in north coastal California, USA, to assess small- and large-scale sexual segregation in winter. We hypothesized that male group size would associate with small-scale segregation and that a change in female distribution would associate with large-scale segregation. Variation in forage biomass might also be coupled to small and large-scale sexual segregation. Our findings were consistent with male group size associating with small-scale segregation and a change in female distribution associating with large-scale segregation. Females appeared to avoid large groups comprised of socially dominant males. Males appeared to occupy a habitat vacated by females because of a wider forage niche, greater tolerance to lethal risks, and, perhaps, to reduce encounters with other elk. Sexual segregation at both spatial scales was a poor predictor of forage biomass. Size dimorphism was coupled to change in sexual segregation at small and large spatial scales. Small scale segregation can seemingly manifest when all forage habitat is occupied by females and large scale segregation might happen when some forage habitat is not occupied by females."
https://openalex.org/W2767627283,"Delivery of health care services to rural and remote populations in Papua New Guinea (PNG) is problematic. This is mainly due to difficulties with transportation and communication. Hence, the children in this region of PNG are likely to be at risk of malnutrition compounded by inadequate vaccination that may predispose them to preventable diseases. This study was conducted to determine the vaccination and nutritional status of children less than 5 years old in the remote and rural Karawari area of PNG. 105 children were included in the study, of whom 55% were male and 45% female. The mean age of children included in the study was 32.6 months. Their age, height, and weight by gender was not significantly different. Overall, 85% of children had incomplete vaccination. However, children above the median age of 32 months (34%) were more likely to be fully vaccinated for their age, χ2 (1) = 23.294, p < 0.005. In addition, 25% of children were below the -1 SD (Z-scores) for weight-for—height, 33% below the -1 SD for weight-for-age, and 25.5% below the -1 SD for height-for-age compared to WHO standards. A large proportion of children had poor nutrition status and lack protection from vaccine preventable diseases. This study recommends that the government should introduce a surveillance system for detecting issues of importance to the rural majority. We also recommend that the PNG government reopen the nearby health centre, and/ or establish new facilities within the region, with adequately trained and compensated staff."
https://openalex.org/W2767439320,"Elevated renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) accompanies a variety of complex disorders, including obstructive sleep apnea, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. Understanding pathophysiologic renal mechanisms is important for determining why hypertension is both a common sequelae and a predisposing factor of these disorders. The role of the brainstem in regulating RSNA remains incompletely understood. The pedunculopontine tegmentum (PPT) is known for regulating behaviors including alertness, locomotion, and rapid eye movement sleep. Activation of PPT neurons in anesthetized rats was previously found to increase splanchnic sympathetic nerve activity and blood pressure, in addition to altering breathing. The present study is the first investigation of the PPT and its potential role in regulating RSNA. Microinjections of DL-homocysteic acid (DLH) were used to probe the PPT in 100-μm increments in Nembutal-anesthetized rats to identify effective sites, defined as locations where changes in RSNA could be evoked. A total of 239 DLH microinjections were made in 18 rats, which identified 20 effective sites (each confirmed by the ability to evoke a repeatable sympathoexcitatory response). Peak increases in RSNA occurred within 10–20 seconds of PPT activation, with RSNA increasing by 104.5 ± 68.4% (mean ± standard deviation) from baseline. Mean arterial pressure remained significantly elevated for 30 seconds, increasing from 101.6 ± 18.6 mmHg to 135.9 ± 36.4 mmHg. DLH microinjections also increased respiratory rate and minute ventilation. The effective sites were found throughout the rostal-caudal extent of the PPT with most located in the dorsal regions of the nucleus. The majority of PPT locations tested with DLH microinjections did not alter RSNA (179 sites), suggesting that the neurons that confer renal sympathoexcitatory functions comprise a small component of the PPT. The study also underscores the importance of further investigation to determine whether sympathoexcitatory PPT neurons contribute to adverse renal and cardiovascular consequences of diseases such as obstructive sleep apnea and heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2767445763,"Behavioral resistance protects insects from microbial infection. However, signals inducing insect hygiene behavior are still relatively unexplored. Our previous study demonstrated that olfactory signals from microbes enhance insect hygiene behavior, and gustatory signals even induce the behavior. In this paper, we postulated a cross-talk between behavioral resistance and innate immunity. To examine this hypothesis, we employed a previously validated behavioral test to examine the function of taste signals in inducing a grooming reflex in decapitated flies. Microbes, which activate different pattern recognition systems upstream of immune pathways, were applied to see if there was any correlation between microbial perception and grooming reflex. To narrow down candidate elicitors, the grooming induction tests were conducted with highly purified bacterial components. Lastly, the role of DAP-type peptidoglycan in grooming induction was confirmed. Our results demonstrate that cleaning behavior can be triggered through recognition of DAP-type PGN by its receptor PGRP-LC."
https://openalex.org/W2767790080,"Ligand of Numb protein X1 (LNX1) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that contains a catalytic RING (Really Interesting New Gene) domain and four PDZ (PSD-95, DlgA, ZO-1) domains. LNX1 can ubiquitinate Numb, as well as a number of other ligands. However, the physiological relevance of these interactions in vivo remain unclear. To gain functional insights into the LNX family, we have characterised the LNX1 interactome using affinity purification and mass spectrometry. This approach identified a large number of novel LNX1-interacting proteins, as well as confirming known interactions with NUMB and ERC2. Many of the novel interactions mapped to the LNX PDZ domains, particularly PDZ2, and many showed specificity for LNX1 over the closely related LNX2. We show that PPFIA1 (liprin-α1), KLHL11, KIF7 and ERC2 are substrates for ubiquitination by LNX1. LNX1 ubiquitination of liprin-α1 is dependent on a PDZ binding motif containing a carboxyl terminal cysteine that binds LNX1 PDZ2. Surprisingly, the neuronally-expressed LNX1p70 isoform, that lacks the RING domain, was found to promote ubiquitination of PPFIA1 and KLHL11, albeit to a lesser extent than the longer RING-containing LNX1p80 isoform. Of several E3-ligases identified in the LNX1 interactome we confirm interactions of LNX1 with MID2/TRIM1 and TRIM27. On this basis we propose a model whereby LNX1p70, despite lacking a catalytic RING domain, may function as a scaffold to promote ubiquitination of its ligands through recruitment of other E3-ligases. These findings provide functional insights into the LNX protein family, particularly the neuronal LNX1p70 isoform."
https://openalex.org/W2767504080,"Transmission of pathogens among animals is influenced by demographic, social, and environmental factors. Anthropogenic alteration of landscapes can impact patterns of disease dynamics in wildlife populations, increasing the potential for spillover and spread of emerging infectious diseases in wildlife, human, and domestic animal populations. We evaluated the effects of multiple ecological mechanisms on patterns of pathogen exposure in animal populations. Specifically, we evaluated how ecological factors affected the prevalence of Toxoplasma gondii (Toxoplasma), Bartonella spp. (Bartonella), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and feline calicivirus (FCV) in bobcat and puma populations across wildland-urban interface (WUI), low-density exurban development, and wildland habitat on the Western Slope (WS) and Front Range (FR) of Colorado during 2009–2011. Samples were collected from 37 bobcats and 29 pumas on the WS and FR. As predicted, age appeared to be positively related to the exposure to pathogens that are both environmentally transmitted (Toxoplasma) and directly transmitted between animals (FIV). In addition, WS bobcats appeared more likely to be exposed to Toxoplasma with increasing intraspecific space-use overlap. However, counter to our predictions, exposure to directly-transmitted pathogens (FCV and FIV) was more likely with decreasing space-use overlap (FCV: WS bobcats) and potential intraspecific contacts (FIV: FR pumas). Environmental factors, including urbanization and landscape covariates, were generally unsupported in our models. This study is an approximation of how pathogens can be evaluated in relation to demographic, social, and environmental factors to understand pathogen exposure in wild animal populations."

Despite the supply chain knowledge and expertise that ministries of health might glean from other industries, limited empirical research has examined the process of knowledge transfer from other industries into global public health. We examined a partnership designed to improve the availability of medical supplies in Tanzania by transferring knowledge from The Coca-Cola system to Tanzania's Medical Stores Department (MSD). We conducted a process evaluation including in-depth interviews with 70 participants between July 2011 and May 2014, corresponding to each phase of the partnership, with focus on challenges and strategies to address them, as well as benefits perceived by partners. Partners faced challenges in (1) identifying relevant knowledge to transfer, (2) translating operational solutions from Coca-Cola to MSD, and (3) maintaining momentum between project phases. Strategies to respond to these challenges emerged through real-time problem solving and included (1) leveraging the receptivity of MSD leadership, (2) engaging a boundary spanner to identify knowledge to transfer, (3) promoting local recognition of commonalities across industries, (4) engaging external technical experts to manage translation activities, (5) developing tools with visible benefits for MSD, (6) investing in local relationships, and (7) providing time and space for the partnership model to evolve. Benefits of the partnership perceived by MSD staff included enhanced collaboration and communication, more proactive orientations in managing operations, and greater attention to performance management. Benefits perceived by Coca-Cola staff included strengthened knowledge transfer capability and enhanced job satisfaction. Linking theoretical constructs with practical experiences from the field, we highlight the challenges, emergent strategies, and perceived benefits of a partnership across industry boundaries that may be useful to others seeking to promote the transfer of knowledge to improve global health."
https://openalex.org/W2767383793,"Background There is very little reported in the literature about the relationship between modifications of bacterial proteins and their secretion by mammalian cells that synthesize them. We previously reported that the secretion of the bacterial enzyme Chondroitinase ABC by mammalian cells requires the strategic removal of at least three N-glycosylation sites. The aim of this study was to determine if it is possible to enhance the efficacy of the enzyme as a treatment for spinal cord injury by increasing the quantity of enzyme secreted or by altering its cellular location. Methodology/Principal findings To determine if the efficiency of enzyme secretion could be further increased, cells were transfected with constructs encoding the gene for chondroitinase ABC modified for expression by mammalian cells; these contained additional modifications of strategic N-glycosylation sites or alternative signal sequences to direct secretion of the enzyme from the cells. We show that while removal of certain specific N-glycosylation sites enhances enzyme secretion, N-glycosylation of at least two other sites, N-856 and N-773, is essential for both production and secretion of active enzyme. Furthermore, we find that the signal sequence directing secretion also influences the quantity of enzyme secreted, and that this varies widely amongst the cell types tested. Last, we find that replacing the 3’UTR on the cDNA encoding Chondroitinase ABC with that of β-actin is sufficient to target the enzyme to the neuronal growth cone when transfected into neurons. This also enhances neurite outgrowth on an inhibitory substrate. Conclusion/Significance Some intracellular trafficking pathways are adversely affected by cryptic signals present in the bacterial gene sequence, whilst unexpectedly others are required for efficient secretion of the enzyme. Furthermore, targeting chondroitinase to the neuronal growth cone promotes its ability to increase neurite outgrowth on an inhibitory substrate. These findings are timely in view of the renewed prospects for gene therapy, and of direct relevance to strategies aimed at expressing foreign proteins in mammalian cells, in particular bacterial proteins."

Recently, Moon et al. presented an authentication scheme to remedy the flaws of Lu et al.’s scheme, and claimed that their improved protocol supports the required security properties. Unfortunately, we found that Moon et al.’s scheme still has weaknesses. In this paper, we show that Moon et al.’s scheme is vulnerable to insider attack, server spoofing attack, user impersonation attack and guessing attack. Furthermore, we propose a robust anonymous multi-server authentication scheme using public key encryption to remove the aforementioned problems. From the subsequent formal and informal security analysis, we demonstrate that our proposed scheme provides strong mutual authentication and satisfies the desirable security requirements. The functional and performance analysis shows that the improved scheme has the best secure functionality and is computational efficient."
https://openalex.org/W2767410717,"A warming climate increases thermal inputs to lakes with potential implications for water quality and aquatic ecosystems. In a previous study, we used a dynamic water column temperature and mixing simulation model to simulate chronic (7-day average) maximum temperatures under a range of potential future climate projections at selected sites representative of different U.S. regions. Here, to extend results to lakes where dynamic models have not been developed, we apply a novel machine learning approach that uses Gaussian Process regression to describe the model response surface as a function of simplified lake characteristics (depth, surface area, water clarity) and climate forcing (winter and summer air temperatures and potential evapotranspiration). We use this approach to extrapolate predictions from the simulation model to the statistical sample of U.S. lakes in the National Lakes Assessment (NLA) database. Results provide a national-scale scoping assessment of the potential thermal risk to lake water quality and ecosystems across the U.S. We suggest a small fraction of lakes will experience less risk of summer thermal stress events due to changes in stratification and mixing dynamics, but most will experience increases. The percentage of lakes in the NLA with simulated 7-day average maximum water temperatures in excess of 30°C is projected to increase from less than 2% to approximately 22% by the end of the 21st century, which could significantly reduce the number of lakes that can support cold water fisheries. Site-specific analysis of the full range of factors that influence thermal profiles in individual lakes is needed to develop appropriate adaptation strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2767489033,"This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic responses of lung cancer mice models with adenocarcinoma HCC827 (gefitinib sensitive) and HCC827R (gefitinib resistant) to the epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib alone and in combination with the anti-angiogenesis agent bevacizumab using dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) and diffusion-weighted MRI. In the HCC827 model, temporal changes in DCE-MRI derived parameters (Ktrans, kep, and iAUC90) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were significantly correlated with tumor size. Ktrans and iAUC90 significantly decreased at week 2 in the groups receiving erlotinib alone and in combination with bevacizumab, whereas kep decreased at week 1 and 2 in both treatment groups. In addition, there was a significant difference in iAUC90 between the treatment groups at week 1. Compared to the control group of HCC827, there was a significant reduction in microvessel density and increased tumor apoptosis in the two treatment group. ADC value increased in the erlotinib alone group at week 1 and week 2, and in the erlotinib combined with bevacizumab group at week 2. Enlarged areas of central tumor necrosis were associated with a higher ADC value. However, progressive enlargement of the tumors but no significant differences in DCE parameters or ADC were noted in the HCC827R model. These results showed that both erlotinib alone and in combination with bevacizumab could effectively inhibit tumor growth in the gefitinib-sensitive lung cancer mice model, and that this was associated with decreased vascular perfusion, increased ADC percentage, decreased microvessel density, and increased tumor apoptosis with a two-week treatment cycle."

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) enables RVEF monitoring, but its applicability is limited in clinical practice. This study aimed to examine the correlation between changes in CMRI-derived RVEF with those in echocardiographic indices in patients with precapillary PH.CMRI and echocardiographic indices of RV systolic function were evaluated at baseline and follow-up in 54 consecutive patients with precapillary PH (pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), n = 23; non-PAH, n = 31). During follow-up, medical treatment was optimized according to the guidelines for PH. Using CMRI-derived RVEF as the gold standard, we examined the accuracy of five echocardiographic indices by correlation analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and by calculating sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values.After an average period of 9.5 months, CMRI-derived RVEF improved from 30.2% ± 10.6% at baseline to 41.4% ± 11.3% at follow-up. These changes significantly correlated with those in the five echocardiographic indices, i.e., %RV fractional shortening (r = 0.27), %RV area change (r = 0.46), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) (r = 0.84), RV myocardial performance index (RVMPI) (r = -0.72), and systolic lateral tricuspid annular motion velocity (TVlat) (r = 0.66). Of these indices, %RV area change, TAPSE, and TVlat significantly correlated with those of CMRI-derived RVEF in both PAH and non-PAH subgroups. ROC analysis showed that improvement in echocardiographic indices predicted a pre-specified improvement in CMRI-derived RVEF (>2.9%), with TAPSE and TVlat showing better accuracy over the other three indices.Echocardiographic indices modestly correlate with the changes in CMRI-derived RVEF in precapillary PH patients. Comparison among the five echocardiographic indices revealed that TAPSE and TVlat provide better accuracy than %RV fractional shortening, %RV area change, and RVMPI."

In addition to describing a simple hierarchical arc-merging (HAM) algorithm that uses network topology information, we introduce rule-based arc-merging strategies for identifying community structures. Five well-studied social network datasets and eight sets of LFR benchmark networks were employed to validate the correctness of a ground-truth community, eight large-scale real-world complex networks were used to measure its efficiency, and two synthetic networks were used to determine its susceptibility to two resolution limit problems. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed HAM algorithm exhibited satisfactory performance efficiency, and that HAM-identified and ground-truth communities were comparable in terms of social and LFR benchmark networks, while mitigating resolution limit problems."

In the proposed T1 mapping sequence the optimal number of sampling points and pause cardiac cycles following an initial adiabatic inversion pulse was investigated in a phantom. Seven native control and eight mice, 3 days post myocardial infarction (MI) after administration of gadolinium were scanned. Two experienced readers graded the visual T1 map quality.In T1 phantoms, there were no significant differences (<0.4% error) between 12, 15 and 20 pause cardiac cycles (p = 0.1, 0.2 and 0.6 respectively) for 8 acquisition cardiac cycles for 600bpm in comparison to the conventional inversion recovery spin echo T1 mapping sequence for short T1's (<600 ms). Subsequently, all in-vivo scans were performed with 8 data acquisitions and 12 pause cardiac cycles to minimize scan time. The mean native T1 value of myocardium in control animal was 820.5±52 ms. The post-contrast T1 measured 3 days after MI in scar was 264±59 ms and in healthy myocardium was 512±62 ms. The Bland-Altman analysis revealed mean difference of only -1.06% of infarct size percentage between T1 maps and LGE.A multi-shot 2D MOLLI sequence has been presented that allows reliable measurement of high spatial resolution T1 maps in mice for heart rates up to 600bpm."
https://openalex.org/W2768027872,"Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) occupy sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) habitats in 11 western states and 2 Canadian provinces. In September 2015, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced the listing status for sage-grouse had changed from warranted but precluded to not warranted. The primary reason cited for this change of status was that the enactment of new regulatory mechanisms was sufficient to protect sage-grouse populations. One such plan is the 2008, Wyoming Sage Grouse Executive Order (SGEO), enacted by Governor Freudenthal. The SGEO identifies ""Core Areas"" that are to be protected by keeping them relatively free from further energy development and limiting other forms of anthropogenic disturbances near active sage-grouse leks. Using the Wyoming Game and Fish Department's sage-grouse lek count database and the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission database of oil and gas well locations, we investigated the effectiveness of Wyoming's Core Areas, specifically: 1) how well Core Areas encompass the distribution of sage-grouse in Wyoming, 2) whether Core Area leks have a reduced probability of lek collapse, and 3) what, if any, edge effects intensification of oil and gas development adjacent to Core Areas may be having on Core Area populations. Core Areas contained 77% of male sage-grouse attending leks and 64% of active leks. Using Bayesian binomial probability analysis, we found an average 10.9% probability of lek collapse in Core Areas and an average 20.4% probability of lek collapse outside Core Areas. Using linear regression, we found development density outside Core Areas was related to the probability of lek collapse inside Core Areas. Specifically, probability of collapse among leks >4.83 km from inside Core Area boundaries was significantly related to well density within 1.61 km (1-mi) and 4.83 km (3-mi) outside of Core Area boundaries. Collectively, these data suggest that the Wyoming Core Area Strategy has benefited sage-grouse and sage-grouse habitat conservation; however, additional guidelines limiting development densities adjacent to Core Areas may be necessary to effectively protect Core Area populations."

Dysregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules and cellular factors might contribute to increased hydraulic resistance to aqueous drainage. Therefore, we examined these molecules in failed AGV capsular tissue. Immunostaining for ECM molecules (collagen I, collagen III, decorin, lumican, chondroitin sulfate, aggrecan and keratan sulfate) and cellular factors (αSMA and TGFβ) was performed on excised capsules from failed AGVs and control tenon’s tissue. Staining intensity of ECM molecules was assessed using Image J. Cellular factors were assessed based on positive cell counts. Histopathologically two distinct layers were visible in capsules. The inner layer (proximal to the AGV) showed significant decrease in most ECM molecules compared to outer layer. Furthermore, collagen III (p = 0.004), decorin (p = 0.02), lumican (p = 0.01) and chondroitin sulfate (p = 0.02) was significantly less in inner layer compared to tenon’s tissue. Outer layer labelling however was similar to control tenon’s for most ECM molecules. Significantly increased cellular expression of αSMA (p = 0.02) and TGFβ (p = 0.008) was detected within capsular tissue compared to controls. Our results suggest profibrotic activity indicated by increased αSMA and TGFβ expression and decreased expression of proteoglycan (decorin and lumican) and glycosaminoglycans (chondroitin sulfate). Additionally, we observed decreased collagen III which might reflect increased myofibroblast contractility when coupled with increased TGFβ and αSMA expression. Together these events lead to tissue dysfunction potentially resulting in hydraulic resistance that may affect aqueous flow through the capsular wall."

As a result, 39 known and 12 novel miRNAs were identified in both NG and WG small RNA libraries. Seven DEMs were determined to be involved in the antiviral innate immunity in the intestines of P. clarkii. The results of the target gene predictions of the DEMs showed that the putative target genes of these 7 DEMs are related to tight junctions, vascular smooth muscle contraction regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesion, RNA transport, mRNA surveillance, viral carcinogenesis, and Salmonella infection. These results provide theoretical insights for future studies on the antiviral immunity of crustaceans."

Twenty young women with normal menstrual cycle were tested four times (5 to 7 days apart) across the menstrual cycle. The test battery included the electrophysiological measurement of auditory evoked response in brainstem and the speech performance in dichotic listening with monosyllables as stimulus pairs. The dichotic listening task was conducted under the non-forced, forced-right and forced-left attention. The central conduction time was defined by the time elapsed between two auditory elicited responses along the auditory pathway. The language lateralization in dichotic listening was expressed in ear advantage, which was the right-ear score minus the left-ear score. The results showed that the effects of test time were significant on both the central conduction time and the ear advantage under the forced-left attention. Overall, the interaural difference in the central conduction time correlates with the ear advantage (non-forced attention) at the beginning of the menstrual cycle. The change in central conduction time between two test times correlates significantly with the change in ear advantage under the non-forced and forced-left attention. Conclusively, the central conduction time depends on the time during the menstrual cycle, which in turn may affect the performance in dichotic listening."
https://openalex.org/W2767292377,"Landmarks, also known as feature points, are one of the important geometry primitives that describe the predominant characteristics of a surface. In this study we proposed a self-contained framework to generate landmarks on surfaces extracted from volumetric data. The framework is designed to be a three-fold pipeline structure. The pipeline comprises three phases which are surface construction, crest line extraction and landmark identification. With input as a volumetric data and output as landmarks, the pipeline takes in 3D raw data and produces a 0D geometry feature. In each phase we investigate existing methods, extend and tailor the methods to fit the pipeline design. The pipeline is designed to be functional as it is modularised to have a dedicated function in each phase. We extended the implicit surface polygonizer for surface construction in first phase, developed an alternative way to compute the gradient of maximal curvature for crest line extraction in second phase and finally we combine curvature information and K-means clustering method to identify the landmarks in the third phase. The implementations are firstly carried on a controlled environment, i.e. synthetic data, for proof of concept. Then the method is tested on a small scale data set and subsequently on huge data set. Issues and justifications are addressed accordingly for each phase."
https://openalex.org/W2767720677,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the leading forms of cancer related deaths in the United States. With limited treatment options and unreliable diagnostic methods, long-term survival rates following a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer remain poor. Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) are precancerous lesions that precede progression towards PDAC. PanIN occur in increasing complexity as the disease progresses and the description of PanIN plays a critical role in describing, staging and diagnosing PDAC. Inconsistencies in PanIN classifications exist even amongst leading pathologists. This has led to debate and confusion among researchers and pathologists involved in pancreatic cancer research, diagnosis and treatment. We have sought to initiate a discussion with leading pathologists with a goal of increasing consensus in the interpretation of PanIN and associated structures within the precancerous pancreas. Toward achieving this goal, we are in the process of conducting an extensive study of over 1000 male and female pancreata in varying stages of PanIN progression isolated from the Ptf1aCre/+;LSL-KrasG12D/+ transgenic mouse model of pancreatic cancer. Using this extensive database, we have established the Mouse Model of Pancreatic Cancer Atlas (MMPCA) to serve as a platform for meaningful and interactive discussion among researchers and pathologists who study pancreatic disease. We hope that the MMPCA will be an effective tool for promoting a more consistent and accurate consensus of PanIN classifications in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2768000089,"This study aimed to evaluate the major changes of the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) pathologic staging for prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy. A total of 138,176 patients diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma undergoing radical prostatectomy were selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database during 2004–2014 period. Excluded were cases with incomplete or unavailable staging, PSA and Gleason score information. Two subgroups were established: group a, T2 stage with PSA≥20ng/ml; group b, T2 stage with Gleason score grade group 5 and PSA<20ng/ml. The median follow-up time was 58 months. The median age at diagnosis for the overall group was 61 years, and the median PSA was 5.7ng/ml. Cancer-specific survival (CSS) at tenth years was 99.3% for T2a/T2b, 99.2% for T2c, respectively. The survival differences between T2a/T2b and T2c did not have statistical significance (P = .323). It was necessary for the current eighth edition to define a single pathologic T2 category, eliminating the subcategories, for all organ-confined disease.CSS at the tenth years was 98.4% for group a, 92.6% for group b, respectively. The prognosis of group a was worse than AJCC II (P = .002). The prognosis of group b was not only worse than AJCC II (P < .001), but also worse than AJCC IIIB. There was necessity to separate the disease with PSA≥20ng/ml or Gleason score grade group 5 from other organ-confined disease. The present study supported the scientificity of the eighth edition of AJCC pathologic staging for prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2768054190,"This paper presents a numerical and experimental study on the performance of a methanol steam reformer integrated with a hydrogen/air combustion reactor for hydrogen production. A CFD-based 3D model with mass and momentum transport and temperature characteristics is established. The simulation results show that better performance is achieved in the cross-U type reactor compared to either a tubular reactor or a parallel-U type reactor because of more effective heat transfer characteristics. Furthermore, Cu-based micro reformers of both cross-U and parallel-U type reactors are designed, fabricated and tested for experimental validation. Under the same condition for reforming and combustion, the results demonstrate that higher methanol conversion is achievable in cross-U type reactor. However, it is also found in cross-U type reactor that methanol reforming selectivity is the lowest due to the decreased water gas shift reaction under high temperature, thereby carbon monoxide concentration is increased. Furthermore, the reformed gas generated from the reactors is fed into a high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). In the test of discharging for 4 h, the fuel cell fed by cross-U type reactor exhibits the most stable performance."
https://openalex.org/W2767383181,"Video summarization is a process to extract objects and their activities from a video and represent them in a condensed form. Existing methods for video summarization fail to detect moving (dynamic) objects in the low color contrast area of a video frame due to the pixel intensities of objects and non-objects are almost similar. However, edges of objects are prominent in the low contrast regions. Moreover, to represent objects, geometric primitives (such as lines, arcs) are distinguishable and high level shape descriptors than edges. In this paper, a novel method is proposed for video summarization using geometric primitives such as conic parts, line segments and angles. Using these features, objects are extracted from each video frame. A cost function is applied to measure the dissimilarity of locations of geometric primitives to detect the movement of objects between consecutive frames. The total distance of object movement is calculated and each video frame is assigned a probability score. Finally, a set of key frames is selected based on the probability scores as per user provided skimming ratio or system default skimming ratio. The proposed approach is evaluated using three benchmark datasets-BL-7F, Office, and Lobby. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art method in terms of accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2767471468,"Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) constitute a subfamily of protein tyrosine phosphatases, and are intimately involved in the regulation of diverse parameters of cellular signaling and essential biological processes. DUSP28 is one of the DUSP subfamily members that is known to be implicated in the progression of hepatocellular and pancreatic cancers, and its biological functions and enzymatic characteristics are mostly unknown. Herein, we present the crystal structure of human DUSP28 determined to 2.1 Å resolution. DUSP28 adopts a typical DUSP fold, which is composed of a central β-sheet covered by α-helices on both sides and contains a well-ordered activation loop, as do other enzymatically active DUSP proteins. The catalytic pocket of DUSP28, however, appears hardly accessible to a substrate because of the presence of nonconserved bulky residues in the protein tyrosine phosphatase signature motif. Accordingly, DUSP28 showed an atypically low phosphatase activity in the biochemical assay, which was remarkably improved by mutations of two nonconserved residues in the activation loop. Overall, this work reports the structural and biochemical basis for understanding a putative oncological therapeutic target, DUSP28, and also provides a unique mechanism for the regulation of enzymatic activity in the DUSP subfamily proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2767595743,"Thymidine kinase converts 5-fluorodeoxyuridine to 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate, which causes disruption of deoxynucleotide triphosphate ratios. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe does not express endogenous thymidine kinase but 5-fluorodeoxyuridine inhibits growth when exogenous thymidine kinase is expressed. Unexpectedly, we found that 5-fluorodeoxyuridine causes S phase arrest even without thymidine kinase expression. DNA damage checkpoint proteins such as the 9-1-1 complex were required for viability in the presence of 5-fluorodeoxyuridine. We also found that strains with circular chromosomes, due to loss of pot1+, which have higher levels of replication stress, were more sensitive to loss of the 9-1-1 complex in the presence of 5-fluorodeoxyuridine. Thus, our results suggest that strains carrying circular chromosomes exhibit a greater dependence on DNA damage checkpoints to ensure viability in the presence of 5-fluorodeoxyuridine compared to stains that have linear chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2767243465,"The goal of this study is to develop a model that explains the relationship between microRNAs, transcription factors, and their co-target genes. This relationship was previously reported in gene regulatory loops associated with 24 hour (24h) and 7 day (7d) time periods following ischemia-reperfusion injury in a rat's retina. Using a model system of retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury, we propose that microRNAs first influence transcription factors, which in turn act as mediators to influence transcription of genes via triadic regulatory loops. Analysis of the relative contributions of direct and indirect regulatory influences on genes revealed that a substantial fraction of the regulatory loops (69% for 24 hours and 77% for 7 days) could be explained by causal mediation. Over 40% of the mediated loops in both time points were regulated by transcription factors only, while about 20% of the loops were regulated entirely by microRNAs. The remaining fractions of the mediated regulatory loops were cooperatively mediated by both microRNAs and transcription factors. The results from these analyses were supported by the patterns of expression of the genes, transcription factors, and microRNAs involved in the mediated loops in both post-ischemic time points. Additionally, network motif detection for the mediated loops showed a handful of time specific motifs related to ischemia-reperfusion injury in a rat's retina. In summary, the effects of microRNAs on genes are mediated, in large part, via transcription factors."
