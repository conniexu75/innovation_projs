https://openalex.org/W2076883859,"We have investigated the role of AMPA receptor desensitization during transmission at a calyceal synapse. Cyclothiazide blocked the rapid desensitization of AMPA receptors and markedly prolonged the decay time of the evoked excitatory postsynaptic current (PSC). This effect was greater than what would be expected from a simple prolongation of channel open time. Additionally, the drug reduced the depression of PSCs evoked at brief intervals. The effects of cyclothiazide on the PSC were reduced when the level of transmitter release was lowered. These data indicate that AMPA receptors are desensitized by neurotransmitter and that this desensitization depends on the number of quanta in the synaptic cleft. We propose that release of transmitter from many closely spaced sites prolongs the time of receptor-transmitter contact and thereby promotes desensitization. Desensitization may therefore contribute to synaptic depression and prevent the interaction of transmitter quanta within the synaptic cleft."
https://openalex.org/W2003904482,"All Src family non-receptor tyrosine kinases are negatively regulated by phosphorylation at a carboxy-terminal tyrosine. To analyze the significance of this regulation during development, we have generated mice deficient in Csk, a kinase that phosphorylates this tyrosine, by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells. Homozygous mutant embryos exhibit a complex phenotype that includes defects in the neural tube and die between day 9 and day 10 of gestation. Cells derived from these embryos exhibit an order of magnitude increase in activity of Src and the related Fyn kinase. Phosphorylation at the carboxy-terminal tyrosine of Src was reduced but not eliminated and was accompanied by increased phosphorylation at another key tyrosine residue. These results demonstrate that Src family kinase activity is critically dependent on phosphorylation by Csk and suggest that the regulation of kinase activity may be essential during embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2078084904,"The distribution of several glutamate receptor subunits was investigated in cultured rat hippocampal neurons by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. The AMPA/kainate-selective receptors GluR1-6 exhibited two patterns of mRNA expression: most neurons expressed GluR1, R2, and R6, whereas only about 20% expressed significant levels of GluR3, R4, and R5. By immunocytochemistry, the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR1 alpha was detectable only in a subpopulation of GABAergic interneurons. GluR1 and GluR2/3 segregated to the somatodendritic domain within the first week in culture, even in the absence of synaptogenesis. Glutamate receptor-enriched spines developed later and were present only on presumptive pyramidal cells, not on GABAergic interneurons. Clusters of GluR1 and GluR2/3 completely colocalized and were restricted to a subset of postsynaptic sites. Thus, glutamate receptor subunits exhibit both a cell type-specific expression and a selective subcellular localization."
https://openalex.org/W2039033043,"We describe the use of a human bronchial xenograft model for studying the efficiency and biology of in vivo gene transfer into human bronchial epithelia with recombinant E1 deleted adenoviruses. All cell types in the surface epithelium except basal cells efficiently expressed the adenoviral transduced recombinant genes, lacZ and CFTR, for 3-5 weeks. Stable transgene expression was associated with high level expression of the early adenoviral gene, E2a, in a subset of transgene expressing cells and virtually undetectable expression of the late adenoviral genes encoding the structural proteins, hexon and fiber. These studies begin to address important issues that relate to safety and in vivo efficacy of recombinant adenoviruses for gene delivery into the human airway."
https://openalex.org/W2117774225,"The molecular mechanisms by which overloaded cardiac myocytes increase the cell size (hypertrophy) remain unknown. We have previously shown that mechanical loading increased the protein synthesis and the expression of proto-oncogene c-fos mRNA (Komuro, I., Kaida, T., Shibazaki, Y., Kurabayashi, M., Katoh, Y. Hoh, E., Takaku, F., and Yazaki, Y. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 3595-3598; Komuro, I., Katoh, Y., Kaida, T., Shibazaki, Y., Kurabayashi, M., Hoh, E., Takaku, F., and Yazaki, Y. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 1265-1268). It has been known that both mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and S6 kinase can be activated by many kinds of growth factors. To clarify whether MAP kinase(s) and S6 kinase(s) are associated with the intracellular signaling of cardiac hypertrophy induced by mechanical loading, we cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes in deformable dishes and imposed an in vitro mechanical loading by stretching the adherent myocytes. In this study, we demonstrated that 1) myocyte stretching maximally activated a kinase activity toward myelin basic protein (MBP) at 10 min after stretching, and the kinase activity returned to the control level at 30 min after stretching; 2) kinase assays in MBP-containing gel, after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealed that stretch-induced MBP kinase activity mainly migrated at 42 kDa in the immunoprecipitated fraction of anti-MAP kinase antibody, suggesting that the stretching mainly increased the 42-kDa MAP kinase activity in cardiac myocytes; 3) phosphorylation of MAP kinase was induced after stretching cardiac myocytes; 4) when protein kinase C was depleted by preincubating myocytes with 100 nM 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate for 24 h or 2 nM staurosporine for 30 min, stretch-induced MBP kinase activity was decreased by approximately 60-70% as compared with the kinase activity in myocytes without protein kinase C depletion; 5) although the receptor tyrosine kinases were depleted by preincubating myocytes with 50 microM tyrphostin or 20 microM genistein for 30 min, there was no change in the stretch-induced MBP kinase activity; 6) stretch-induced MBP kinase activity was partially dependent on transsarcolemmal influx of Ca2+; 7) myocyte stretching also increased S6 peptide (RRLSSLRA) kinase activity in the anti-S6 kinase II antibody immunoprecipitates. From these results, we conclude that myocyte stretching increases the activities of MAP kinase and S6 peptide kinase, which may play an important role in the induction of the specific genes and the increase in the protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1559138834,"Lectin-carbohydrate recognition between the selectins and their ligands are among the earliest events in leukocyte recirculation, leukocyte recruitment into inflamed areas, and abnormal egress of leukocytes in diseases. Previously, we have described a dimeric sialoglycoprotein from myeloid cells with subunits of molecular mass = 120 kDa, which is selectively recognized by P-selectin (Moore, K.L., Stults, N.L., Diaz, S., Smith, D.F., Cummings, R.D., Varki, A., and McEver, R.P. (1992) J. Cell Biol. 188, 445-456). Here, we demonstrate that this P-selectin ligand carries alpha 2-3-linked sialic acids and the sialyl-Lewisx (SLex) tetrasaccharide motif. This glycoprotein contains < 1% of the total membrane-bound sialic acids and a very small fraction of the total SLex on neutrophil membranes. In spite of a relative resistance to sialidase digestion, the predominant form of sialic acid on the ligand is N-acetylneuraminic acid. Selective periodate oxidation of the side chain of sialic acids does not affect P-selectin binding and allows the introduction of tritium label into the truncated sialic acids. beta-Elimination with alkaline borohydride releases labeled O-linked oligosaccharides both from the labeled neutrophil ligand and from the ligand purified from HL-60 cells metabolically labeled with [3H]glucosamine. The ligand from both neutrophils and HL-60 cells is also susceptible to cleavage by the enzyme O-sialoglycoprotease from Pasteurella hemolytica. Analysis of the specificity of this enzyme suggests that the P-selectin ligand carries large numbers of closely spaced sialylated O-linked oligosaccharides. O-Sialoglycoprotease abolishes both direct binding of P-selectin to HL-60 cells and the adhesion of HL-60 cells to immobilized P-selectin, without significantly decreasing overall cell surface SLex expression. This indicates that the 120-kDa ligand may be the major determinant of P-selectin:myeloid cell interaction in vivo. Finally, based on the current and previous data, we hypothesize that the high affinity recognition site(s) of this P-selectin ligand may be derived from a ""clustered saccharide patch"" of sialylated fucosylated O-linked oligosaccharide sequences."

https://openalex.org/W1535872730,"During the host response to inflammation/tissue injury there are many changes in intermediary metabolism including a dramatic change in the concentrations of many plasma proteins. Although many of these acute phase proteins are predominantly derived from the liver and the response can be elicited from liver cells incubated in tissue culture with cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, leukemia inhibitory factor, interleukin-11 (IL-11), and oncostatin M, there is now evidence that the response can also be elicited in extrahepatic tissues and cell types. In this study, we show that many of the acute phase plasma proteins are expressed in human intestinal epithelial cell lines Caco2 and T84 and that their expression is induced or regulated by cytokines IL-6, IL-1, interferon, and tumor necrosis factor in a manner characteristic of the acute phase response. In fact, effects of IL-1 and IL-6 which are additive, synergistic, and antagonistic in liver cell lines are also observed in these intestinal epithelial cell lines. Responses to IL-6 and IL-1 are seen at all stages of differentiation of Caco2 cells from crypt-like enterocytes to villus-like enterocytes. Caco2 cells express binding sites for IL-6 at both poles, for IL-1 at the basolateral pole and, to a lesser extent, at the apical pole. T84 cells have IL-1 and IL-6 receptor binding sites only at the basolateral pole. IL-6 and IL-1 also regulate the expression of enterocyte-specific integral membrane proteins as exemplified by down-regulation of sucrase-isomaltase gene expression in response to IL-6. These data raise the possibility that enterocytes are involved in a local response to injury/inflammation at the epithelial surface and establish a model system for examining coordination of the acute phase response in a bipolar cell."
https://openalex.org/W1993641677,"The diversity of the T cell receptor repertoire is generated by rearrangement of gene elements in immature thymocytes. To identify a thymic signal that induces this rearrangement, a variety of agents were tested for their ability to induce rearrangement of the T cell receptor beta gene in suspensions of thymocytes from mouse embryos at day 14 of gestation. Of 16 agents tested, only interleukin-7 (IL-7) induced V(D)J gene rearrangement and sustained expression of the RAG-1 and RAG-2 genes, which are known to control rearrangement. These data implicate IL-7, a cytokine that is abundantly expressed in embryonic thymus, in driving gene rearrangement during early T cell development."
https://openalex.org/W1981547910,"Type I diabetes [insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM)] is an autoimmune disease associated with the destruction of pancreatic β cells. Serum from patients with IDDM increased L-type calcium channel activity of insulin-producing cells and of GH3 cells derived from a pituitary tumor. The subsequent increase in the concentration of free cytoplasmic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) was associated with DNA fragmentation typical of programmed cell death or apoptosis. These effects of the serum were prevented by adding a blocker of voltage-activated L-type Ca2+ channels. When the serum was depleted of immunoglobulin M (IgM), it no longer affected [Ca2+]i. An IgM-mediated increase in Ca2+ influx may thus be part of the autoimmune reaction associated with IDDM and contribute to the destruction of β cells in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2157449230,"Argiotoxin, a component of the spider venom from Argiope lobata, blocks AMPA receptor channels expressed in homomeric and heteromeric configuration in Xenopus oocytes. Argiotoxin acts as an open channel blocker in a voltage-dependent manner and discriminates between the functionally diverse AMPA receptors. Importantly, a transmembrane region 2 determinant for divalent cation permeability also determines argiotoxin sensitivity. Subunit-specific differences in the time courses of block and recovery demonstrate that heteromeric AMPA receptors can assemble in variable ratios. Thus, argiotoxin can be used as a tool in analyzing the subunit composition of AMPA receptors in native membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2008726042,"The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor, a Ca(2+)-permeable channel, plays a key role in intracellular Ca2+ signaling. The effects of ATP on the IP3 receptor at the single-channel level were characterized after channel incorporation into planar lipid bilayers. ATP alone was not sufficient to open the IP3-gated channel, but addition of ATP or nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs in the presence of IP3 increased the frequency of channel openings 4.8-fold and increased the average duration of channel openings 2.5-fold; channel conductance was unchanged. High concentrations of ATP (> 4 mM) decreased channel activity most probably by competing with IP3-binding site. Allosteric modulation of IP3-induced Ca2+ release by ATP may contribute to the maintenance of cell viability during periods of energy starvation."
https://openalex.org/W1546923829,"A previously unrecognized association between pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) and the proform of eosinophil major basic protein (proMBP) is demonstrated. PAPP-A isolated from pooled pregnancy serum is shown to be a disulfide-bridged complex with proMBP (PAPP-A/proMBP) in which the subunits of the constituents are present in a 1:1 molar ratio. The results are the outcome of analysis of tryptic and CNBr/tryptic peptides from PAPP-A/proMBP, sequence analysis of intact and reduced and carboxymethylated PAPP-A/proMBP, and reaction with monoclonal antibodies directed against MBP and its proform. In addition, it is shown that commercial polyclonal anti-PAPP-A is polyspecific, also reacting with MBP."

https://openalex.org/W1598632614,"NH2-terminal amino acid sequence obtained from a UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyl-transferase (GalNAc-transferase) isolated from bovine colostrum was used for the construction of synthetic oligonucleotide primers. Subsequent polymerase chain reaction and library screenings of a bovine intestine cDNA library produced seven positive clones. The largest clone had a 2294-base pair insert that contained an open reading frame coding for a protein composed of 559 amino acids with a predicted polypeptide molecular mass of 64,173 Da. The cloned molecule has no significant sequence homology to previously reported cloned glycosyltransferases, but appears to have a similar domain structure. It is a type II membrane protein with a 23-amino acid putative transmembrane region starting 8 amino acids from the NH2 terminus. The transmembrane segment of the molecule is immediately followed by a sequence rich in proline residues. The molecule contains three consensus sequences for N-linked glycosylation and five predicted sites for O-glycosylation. Northern blot analysis of poly(A+) mRNA isolated from Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells, bovine mammary tissue, and eight human tissues demonstrated the expression of two transcripts differing in size by approximately 1 kilobase. The cloned DNA was expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus vector. This resulted in an almost 100-fold increase in GalNAc-transferase activity in lysates prepared from cells infected with virus containing the GalNAc-transferase gene compared to cells infected with virus containing DNA coding for an unrelated molecule or uninfected cells. Immunoprecipitation from lysates prepared from infected cells labeled in vivo with [35S] methionine showed a large increase in the recovery of an approximately 67-kDa protein."
https://openalex.org/W2105769212,"Stimulation of glucose transport is the main physiological effect of insulin in target tissues. This effect is linked to translocation of the GLUT4 glucose transporter from an intracellular pool to the cell surface. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in this effect, we developed a simple direct sensitive method to detect GLUT4 immunologically on the cell surface. cDNA containing GLUT4 inserted by a c-myc epitope in the first ectodomain (GLUT4myc) was constructed without disrupting the functions of GLUT4 and was expressed in 3T3-L1 and Chinese hamster ovary fibroblast cells. In response to insulin, the GLUT4myc expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was translocated to the cell surface from the intracellular pool, as shown by assays of exofacial antibody binding against the myc epitope and of the uptake of 2-deoxyglucose. Insulin, guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), guanylyl imidodiphosphate, NaF, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also induced the translocation of GLUT4myc in Chinese hamster ovary cells coexpressing the human insulin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1599542750,"The proto-oncogene c-kit is allelic with the white spotting locus (W) on mouse chromosome 5 and it encodes a transmembrane protein tyrosine kinase which belongs to the platelet-derived growth factor and macrophage-colony stimulating factor (CSF-1) receptor subfamily. In an effort to study the function of the c-kit receptor, specifically the physiological mechanism of controlling the signal induced by the ligand, the effect and mechanism of down-regulation of the c-kit receptor by the kit ligand (KL) was investigated in mast cells. Following preincubation with KL, the capacity of mast cells to bind kit antibody was reduced and binding of radiolabeled KL to mast cells decreased with similar kinetics, suggesting that KL stimulates the loss of c-kit receptor from the cell surface. After binding to the c-kit receptor, KL was rapidly internalized, and degradation of the receptor was accelerated. The c-kit receptor was transmodulated by the protein kinase C activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and by the calcium ionophore ionomycin. TPA- and ionomycin-induced down-regulation of the c-kit receptor was accompanied by release of the extracellular domain of the receptor, presumably by proteolytic cleavage near the transmembrane domain. Release of the extracellular domain of the c-kit receptor occurred also in untreated cells but at a slow rate. In addition, ionomycin induced shedding of the intact c-kit receptor. In mast cells depleted of protein kinase C, the c-kit receptor remained sensitive to down-regulation induced by KL and ionomycin, but not by treatment with TPA. Therefore, the down-regulation of the c-kit receptor induced by KL, activated protein kinase C, and an increased level of intracellular calcium is mediated through independent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1480415840,The primary amino acid sequence for a highly abundant junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum glycoprotein (triadin) has been deduced from the cDNA sequence. Based on both biochemical analysis and the predicted amino acid sequence we suggest that this protein is an intrinsic membrane glycoprotein containing a single transmembrane domain that separates the protein into cytoplasmic and luminal domains. The cytoplasmic domain is proposed to contain the amino-terminal 47 amino acids. The remainder of the protein including the carboxyl terminus is proposed to be found within the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and contains an extremely high concentration of basic residues. Protease analysis of intact triads was consistent with the topological predictions. Western and Northern blots suggest that the protein is specifically expressed in skeletal muscle and not cardiac muscle or brain. The abundance and localization of this protein suggest that it plays an important regulatory or structural role in excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle.
https://openalex.org/W1486748575,"Glycoprotein 330 (gp330), a cell-surface protein that is localized in clathrin-coated pits, is structurally related to both the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and the LDLR-related protein/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor (LRP). We recently demonstrated that gp330 and LRP may be functionally related as well; both bind the 39-kDa polypeptide referred to as receptor-associated protein (Kounnas, M. Z., Argraves, W. S., and Strickland, D. K. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 21162-21166). In this report, we tested several other LRP ligands for their ability to interact with human and rat gp330 in vitro. Gp330 did not exhibit detectable binding to the LRP ligands, alpha 2-macroglobulin protease complex or Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A. However, we found that gp330 (purified from human or rat) bound the lipolytic enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL) with high affinity (Kd = 6.1 and 2.7 nM, respectively). The binding was saturable, divalent cation dependent, and inhibited by heparin or receptor-associated protein. Because LRP has also been shown to bind LPL, the present findings further extend the functional similarities between gp330 and LRP. By analogy to the postulated role of the LRP-LPL interaction in facilitating hepatic clearance of LPL-associated lipoproteins from the blood (Beisiegel, U., Weber, W., and Bengtsson-Olivercrona, G. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 8342-8346; Chappell, D. A., Fry, G. L., Waknitz, M. A., Iverius, P. H., Williams, S. E., and Strickland, D. K. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 25764-25767), we speculate that the gp330-LPL interaction described herein may contribute to the uptake of LPL-associated lipoproteins in tissues expressing gp330. Consistent with this possibility, we found that LPL promoted in vitro binding of 125I-lipoproteins to gp330."
https://openalex.org/W1524483652,"Lysosomal membrane glycoprotein (lamp)-1 and lamp-2 are the most abundant glycoproteins within the lysosomal membrane. A small amount of lamp-1 and lamp-2 molecules, however, can be present on the cell surface. We have shown previously that highly metastatic colonic carcinoma L4 cells express more lamp-1 and lamp-2 on the cell surface than low metastatic SP cells (Saitoh, O., Wang, W.-L., Lotan, R., and Fukuda, M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 5700-5711). Since lamp-1 and lamp-2 are the major carriers for poly-N-acetyllactosamines that are able to display sialyl-Le(x) termini, we sought to determine if an increased amount of lamp-1 on the cell surface would lead to increased expression of cell surface sialyl-Le(x) determinants and to the increased adhesion of those cells to E-selectin. Expression of increased amounts of lamp-1 on the cell surface was achieved either by overexpression of lamp-1 or by expressing a mutant lamp-1 molecule preferentially at the plasma membrane, rather than in lysosomes. Cells that express variable amounts of cell surface lamp-1 were tested for their adhesion to activated endothelial cells or E-selectin expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells. The results clearly show that the extent of adhesion to E-selectin and cell surface sialyl-Le(x) determinants is proportional to the amount of cell surface lamp-1. Moreover, it was demonstrated that such adhesion can be inhibited by soluble lamp-1 generated from Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing sialyl-Le(x) structures. These results indicate that lamp-1 can efficiently present ligands for E-selectin and at the same time can be a useful reagent for inhibition of E-selectin (and possibly P-selectin)-mediated interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1680099832,"The hormonal regulation of transcription of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (4.1.1.32) (PEPCK) gene during diabetes was studied using transgenic mice containing a chimeric gene consisting of segments of the PEPCK promoter (-2000/+73, -460/+73, -355/+73) linked to bovine growth hormone (bGH) reporter gene. The effect of diabetes and insulin on transgenic mice containing a mutation in cAMP regulatory sequences at -90/-82 and -250/-234 was also studied. In addition, we analyzed the transcriptional response of the PEPCK gene to adrenalectomy, the administration of glucocorticoids, and alterations in dietary protein and carbohydrate. Our results indicate that deletion of the insulin regulatory sequence of the PEPCK promoter did not affect dietary control of PEPCK gene expression. However, glucocorticoids and the glucocorticoid regulatory unit appear to be essential for induction of PEPCK gene transcription by diabetes. By contrast, mutation of cAMP regulatory elements of the PEPCK promoter did not limit induction of PEPCK transcription by diabetes, nor did it affect negative regulation of transcription by insulin. These results provide evidence for the interaction of insulin and glucocorticoid regulatory elements in the control of PEPCK gene transcription and suggest an important role of glucocorticoids as a gluconeogenic activator during diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1517089997,"Calpain is distributed ubiquitously in virtually every tissue (Croall, D. E., and DeMartino, G. N. (1991) Physiol. Rev. 71, 813-846), but its physiological role remains to be determined. The identification of its natural endogenous substrates would be of great interest. Since pp60src, a major tyrosine kinase in platelets, is known to be easily cleaved during purification from cells (Feder, D., and Bishop, J. M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 8205-8211), we examined the possibility that it is an endogenous substrate of calpain. In the whole cell lysate from resting platelets, which was analyzed by Western blotting with monoclonal antibody 327, we found pp60src almost exclusively in a 60-kDa form, with a trace of 52-kDa form. Addition of A23187 (a calcium ionophore) or dibucaine, which are known to be activators of platelet calpain (Croall and DeMartino, 1991; Fox, J. E., Reynolds, C., Morrow, J. S., and Phillips, D. R. (1987) Blood 76, 2510-2519; Fox, J. E., Austin, C. D., Boyles, J. K., and Steffen, P. K. (1990b) J. Cell Biol. 111, 483-493), caused dose- and time-dependent cleavage of actin-binding protein and p235 protein (talin). At the same time, loss of the 60-kDa species of pp60src and generation of the 52-kDa (occasionally seen as doublets) and 47-kDa species were detected by the Western blotting. In platelets aggregated by 1 unit/ml thrombin, apparently identical cleavage products were found. The cleavage of pp60src was inhibited by calpeptin (20 microM), an inhibitor of calpain (Tsujinaka, T., Kajiwara, Y., Kambayashi, J., Sakon, M., Higuchi, N., Tanaka, T., and Mori, T. (1988) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 153, 1201-1208; Tsujinaka, T., Ariyoshi, H., Uemura, Y., Sakon, M., Kambayashi, J., and Mori, T. (1990) Life Sci. 46, 1059-1066; Fox, J. E., Clifford, C. C., and Austin, C. D.

Biol. Chem. 266, 13289-13295). Addition of EGTA (3 mM) to the extracellular media completely inhibited the cleavage of actin-binding protein, talin, and pp60src in response to A23187 (1 microM). Intact pp60src was distributed in both cytosolic and particulate (membrane) fractions. Cleaved species were found exclusively in the cytosolic fraction. pp60src-associated enolase kinase activity was reduced. Thus, pp60src is an endogenous substrate for calpain, the cleavage of which may have regulatory effects on the kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1596468411,"A region containing sites for ligand binding was localized in the 4525-amino acid residue alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (alpha 2MR/LRP) by ligand- and immunoblotting of proteinase and CNBr digests of the purified human placental protein. 125I-Labeled rat alpha 1-macroglobulin light chain, urokinase-plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 complex, and alpha 2MR-associated protein all bound to a 75-kDa CNBr-generated fragment (68 kDa after deglycosylation). In addition to the three ligands, the fragment bound a novel monoclonal antibody reacting in the region defined by amino acid residues 1165-1246 as determined by binding to recombinant fragments of alpha 2MR/LRP. The positions of methionine residues in alpha 2MR/LRP suggested that the ligand-binding CNBr fragment contained three disulfide-linked peptides comprising the residues 776-1399. This origin was confirmed by partial amino acid sequencing of the electroblotted fragment and polypeptides generated by reduction of the fragment. The identified region represents 13.6% of the molecular mass (nonglycosylated) of alpha 2MR/LRP and contains one of three large clusters of complement-type repeats."
https://openalex.org/W1497473690,"Kinetic studies are presented which show that native human vitronectin, but not urea-treated vitronectin, accelerates the inactivation of human alpha-thrombin by human plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). We demonstrate that although urea-treated vitronectin binds PAI-1 with an affinity greater than that of native vitronectin, it does not accelerate the rate of inactivation of alpha-thrombin by PAI-1. We present evidence to suggest that the inability of urea-treated vitronectin to accelerate the reaction between alpha-thrombin and PAI-1 results at least in part from the inability of urea-treated vitronectin to bind to alpha-thrombin. The accelerated reaction between PAI-1 and alpha-thrombin can be accounted for by the formation of a tight complex between native vitronectin and PAI-1 that reacts in a saturable manner (Kd = 75 nM) with alpha-thrombin. The second-order rate constant (kI/Kd) for the reaction of the native vitronectin-PAI-1 complex with alpha-thrombin (1.64 x 10(5) M(-)-1 s-1) is 270-fold greater than the second-order rate constant for the reaction in the absence of vitronectin (610 m-1 s-1). The increase in the second-order rate constant is largely due to an increase in the affinity of alpha-thrombin for the native vitronectin-PAI-1 complex, as reflected by a greater than 25-fold reduction in the dissociation constant (Kd) observed for the vitronectin-PAI-1 complex relative to that of uncomplexed PAI-1."
https://openalex.org/W1480202189,"Monoclonal antibodies RNL-2 and RNL-3 were previously shown to react with four 35-45-kDa proteins, expressed only in small cell lung carcinoma NCI-H82 cells, but to stain a subset of neuroendocrine tissues and neoplasms (Broers, J. L. V., Mijnheere, E. P., Klein Rot, M., Schaart, G., Sijlmans, A., Boerman, O. C., and Ramaekers, F. C. S. (1991) Cancer 67, 619-633). We used RNL-2 and RNL-3 to isolate cDNA sequences that code for proteins containing the two corresponding epitopes and utilized such cDNAs to develop second generation antibodies. Using these antibodies, we identified a novel 135-kDa protein. The corresponding cDNAs were found to belong to a previously unknown gene with a neuroendocrine-specific expression pattern, tentatively designated NSP gene. NSP transcription appeared to result in mRNAs of 3.4 and 1.8 kilobases (kb). In the NCI-H82 cells only, an apparently aberrant transcript of 2.3 kb was found. cDNAs containing coding sequences of the 3.4-, 2.3-, and 1.8-kb transcripts were isolated, and nucleotide sequence analysis revealed extensive sequence overlap and open reading frames for proteins of 776, 356, and 208 amino acids, respectively. The three deduced proteins all have a common carboxyl-terminal part with two large hydrophobic regions. Transfection of the complete coding sequences of the 3.4-kb transcript resulted in the production of a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 135 kDa. This protein is predicted to be highly negatively charged (calculated pI of 4.35), to be rich in proline and serine, and to contain multiple potential phosphorylation sites."
https://openalex.org/W1647506547,"Human adrenal steroid 21-hydroxylase (P450c21) is encoded by the CYP21A1 (21B) gene located in the class III region of the HLA locus. A tandemly duplicated gene designated CYP21A1P (21A), which lies 30 kilobases upstream, contains several point mutations and an 8-base pair deletion so that it cannot encode P450c21 protein; as a result, it is generally considered to be a pseudogene. We previously showed that two additional genes, XA and XB, lie on the opposite strand of DNA overlapping the 3'-ends of the 21A and 21B genes. We have now identified a third pair of duplicated overlapping genes in this locus, termed YA and YB, whose transcriptional orientation is the same as 21A and 21B and opposite to XA and XB. YA transcripts use the 21A promoter, have 5'-ends that are similar to 21B mRNA, and have approximately 10-20% of the abundance of 21B transcripts, but have unique 3'-ends. The YA gene encodes a 7.5-kilobase RNA that overlaps XA completely and a 3.0-kilobase RNA that excludes most of XA. The YB gene appears to be similar in size and organization to YA. The YA and YB genes extend beyond the limit of the duplication in this locus; hence, their cDNAs are distinguishable by differences in their 3'-sequences. YA and YB transcripts are expressed only in the fetal and adult adrenal glands, but their cDNAs do not contain a long open reading frame. Although the function of these genes is not yet clear, the complex genetic organization of three overlapping genes (21/X/Y) appears to be unique among higher eukaryotes. As YA transcription is initiated by the 21A 5'-flanking DNA and includes 21A sequences, the designation of 21A as a pseudogene merits reconsideration."
https://openalex.org/W1597223624,"The Fc-region of immunoglobulin E (IgE) comprising C epsilon 2, C epsilon 3, and C epsilon 4 domains is sufficient for binding to the alpha chain of the high affinity IgE-Fc receptor (Fc epsilon RI alpha). In order to identify the smallest Fc fragment capable of binding to the Fc epsilon RI alpha with high affinity, various regions of the IgE-Fc molecule were expressed in COS cells and investigated for their ability to bind Fc epsilon RI alpha. The smallest fragment that showed Fc epsilon RI alpha binding activity spans amino acids 329-547 and lacks the entire C epsilon 2 domain. Two active fragments, viz. Fc epsilon(315-547) (containing Cys328 which is responsible for interchain S-S bonding) and Fc epsilon(329-547), have been overexpressed in CHO cells and purified to homogeneity. The purified proteins bind to the Fc epsilon RI alpha with high affinity, similar to native IgE. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses indicate that Fc epsilon(315-547) is an S-S-linked dimer of apparent molecular mass of 68 kDa. Fc epsilon(329-547) appears on SDS-gel as three distinct bands at approximately 32 kDa, both under reducing and nonreducing conditions. However, size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation studies suggest that Fc epsilon(329-547) also remains associated as a dimer. The presence of N-linked glycosylation was detected in both proteins. The deglycosylated form of Fc epsilon(315-547) was isolated after Endo F/N-glycosidase F digestion and demonstrated to have binding activity comparable to that of the mock-digested protein. These results suggest that the presence of N-linked sugars is not necessary for Fc epsilon RI alpha binding. Both proteins blocked the release of histamine from RBL cells expressing human Fc epsilon RI alpha in a dose-dependent manner. The availability of these recombinant IgE-Fc proteins will be helpful in elucidating the key epitopes essential for the binding of IgE to its high affinity receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2080472599,"The efficacy of the synapses between the sensory and motor cells of Aplysia, as well as the number of presynaptic sensory cell varicosities in vitro, can undergo long-term increases and decreases, respectively, following application of the facilitatory modulator serotonin or the inhibitory modulator FMRFamide. We here report that cAMP and arachidonic acid, two second messenger systems mediating some of the short-term actions of serotonin and FMRFamide on sensory cells, reproduce some of the long-term changes in the structure of the sensory cells, and these structural changes in turn parallel the long-term changes in the functional effectiveness of the synapses. cAMP enhances the strength of the connections between the sensory and motor cells and increases the number of sensory varicosities. Conversely, arachidonic acid decreases the strength of the connections and decreases the number of sensory varicosities. Thus, each of the modulatory neurotransmitters may activate the same intracellular second messenger system to establish both short and long lasting functional changes in synaptic efficacy, as well as to produce enduring structural changes in neuron connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W127156176,"Vascular injury induced by angioplasty is often followed by smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, migration, and accumulation of extracellular matrix. Since plasminogen activators and their receptors may be important both in cell migration and the clearance of plasminogen activators, we studied the binding, internalization, and degradation of radiolabeled tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) by explant cultures of human vascular SMC. Binding of t-PA to SMC at 4 degrees C was rapid, specific, saturable, and inhibitable by antibodies to plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1). At 37 degrees C, labeled t-PA was internalized and degraded by SMC but not by human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Internalization and degradation was mediated by the low density lipoprotein receptor related protein/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor (LRP) in that these processes were inhibited by an anti-LRP antibody, recombinant LRP-associated protein, urokinase-type plasminogen activator-PAI-1 complexes, and lactoferrin. The portion of t-PA most important for internalization after complexing with PAI-1 is likely to be in the finger and/or epidermal growth factor domains or in the carbohydrate at amino acid 117, in that the internalization of preformed t-PA.PAI-1 complexes or complexes formed on the cell surface was inhibited by an excess of active site-blocked wild type t-PA, but not by an active site blocked t-PA variant missing these domains. These studies are consistent with a model in which t-PA binds initially to SMC-associated PAI-1 with subsequent t-PA.PAI-1 internalization via LRP. SMC may play an important role in clearing t-PA-PAI-1 complexes from within the vessel wall."
https://openalex.org/W1557416929,"Calcineurin (CaN), a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase, has been shown to be inhibited by the complex of the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA) and its receptor, cyclophilin (CyP), but not by either alone. In the current study, the topological relationship between cyclophilin and the subunits of CaN has been explored using chemical cross-linking agents. In the presence of cyclosporin, 125I-CyP, shown to bind to CsA, is extensively cross-linked to the B subunit of CaN but not the catalytic A subunit. However, the A subunit is required for binding of the CyP.CsA complex, since cross-linking to recombinant B subunit alone does not occur. The kinetics of association indicate a saturable reaction with a Kd of less than 70 nM. Cross-linking to the B subunit occurs with cross-linkers that span from 0 to 16 A and employ different cross-linking chemistry, indicating direct contact between the B subunit and CyP. Similar cross-linking to the B subunit has been observed with the complex of 125I-labeled FK506 binding protein (FKBP) and FK506 but not with the FKBP-rapamycin complex. CyP.CsA cross-linking to CaN is Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent with intact CaN, but Ca2+/calmodulin-independent after digestion to remove the calmodulin binding and autoinhibitory domain."
https://openalex.org/W1533192825,"Abstract Previous studies indicate that the transformation of cardiac endothelium into mesenchyme is dependent upon a developmentally regulated signal expressed by its associated myocardium. This process can be mimicked in culture by substituting a non-cytolytic EDTA extract of embryonic heart tissue for the presence of myocardium. Polyclonal antibodies (ES1) generated against the EDTA-extractable proteins both localized to the cardiac extracellular matrix preceding the transformation of endothelium and blocked this process in culture. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that ES1 antigens participate in the formation of cardiac mesenchyme. The present study was undertaken to prepare cDNA and antibody probes for individual ES1 antigens to better characterize their involvement in this important morphogenetic event. An expression library was constructed in Uni-ZAP using poly(A+) RNA from embryonic cardiocyte cultures that had been shown previously to secrete proteins that engender the formation of cardiac mesenchyme. Screening of this expression library with ES1 antibodies resulted in several clones, one of which (ES1-2.1a) is described in this report. ES1-2.1a has a 2.6-kilobase pair insert, the sequence of which exhibits no apparent homology to those in data banks. A fragment (852 base pairs) from the 5' region of ES1-2.1a cDNA was subcloned into the expression vector pGEX-2T, and a 20-kDa fragment of the resulting protein used to prepare affinity-purified antibodies. Immunoblotting detected a 130-kDa protein (ES/130) in two preparations that elicit mesenchyme formation, i.e. EDTA extracts of embryonic hearts and conditioned medium of cardiocyte cultures. Functional studies showed that antibodies to ES/130 inhibited the epithelial-mesenchymal transformation of cardiac endothelium in culture. Immunohistochemistry of cardiocyte cultures localized ES/130 protein to the vacuolar system and secretory granules. By polymerase chain reaction analysis, the message for ES/130 was detected in the developing heart just prior to and during mesenchyme formation. These results are consistent with ES/130 being involved at a critical step in the initiation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transformation of cardiac endothelium."
https://openalex.org/W1607072958,"In earlier studies (Chen, S. R. W., Zhang, L., and MacLennan, D. H. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 23318-23326), an amino acid sequence, designated 13c2, lying between amino acid residues 4478 and 4512 in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor was shown, through the use of a polyclonal antibody, to be involved in Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release. In the present study, an immobilized synthetic peptide, PEPEPEPEPE, corresponding to part of the predicted high affinity Ca2+ binding site between residues 4489 and 4499, was used to purify specific antibodies from an anti-13c2 rabbit antiserum. The effect of this affinity-purified, anti-peptide (anti-13cp1) antibody on Ca2+ release channel function was then characterized using single channel recordings across planar lipid bilayers. The anti-peptide antibody inhibited Ca(2+)- or caffeine-activated channel activities without closing the channel but did not diminish ATP-activated channel activity. The addition of ATP reversed the inhibition of the Ca(2+)- or caffeine-activated channel by the antibody, and the antibody-bound, ATP-activated channel was further modulated by Mg2+, ryanodine, and ruthenium red. The major epitopes in the anti-13c2 antibody, previously shown to activate the Ca2+ release channel by increasing the Ca2+ sensitivity of the channel, did not lie in the PE repeat. These results suggest that the PE repeat sequence forms a site involved in the Ca2+ activation pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1608190360,"We have investigated the regulation of the intestinal mucin gene MUC2 in HT29 cells. Surprisingly, sodium butyrate, an effective inducer of aspects of colonic cell differentiation in HT29 cells, fails to induce MUC2 during short-term exposure, despite the fact that it has been used to select stably differentiated clones of HT29 that resemble goblet cells and produce mucin. However, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and forskolin, which trigger the protein kinase C- and A-dependent signal transduction pathways, respectively, are potent inducers of MUC2 gene expression. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and forskolin operate through distinct mechanisms, with the former requiring de novo protein synthesis and the latter not. Experiments using specific protein kinase inhibitors suggest that both inducers operate by triggering their respective signal transduction pathways. Nuclear runoff analyses suggest that post-transcriptional (rather than transcriptional) mechanisms are important in the accumulation of MUC2 mRNA. Finally, we show that in several cell lines from human mucinous tumors, characterized by elevated levels of mucin production, MUC2 expression is very high and constitutive compared to forskolin-treated HT29 cells. Thus, the different regulation of MUC2 in HT29 cells and in mucinous tumor cell lines may reflect molecular pathways that characterize colon carcinomas of different histology and pathology."
https://openalex.org/W1605273997,"U2AF is a protein that is essential for the formation of the prespliceosome complex during pre-mRNA splicing. It contains two subunits, 65 and 35 kDa, although only the 65-kDa subunit has been shown to be essential for its splicing activity. Here, we show that the 65-kDa subunit mediates the annealing of complementary single-stranded RNAs or single-stranded DNAs. This activity was shown to reverse the action of RNA helicase A, an enzyme that catalyzes the displacement of duplex RNAs. The NH2-terminal region of the 65-kDa subunit of U2AF, containing arginine-serine (RS) dipeptides and basic amino acid sequences, was shown to be essential for the annealing of complementary sequences, RNA binding, and the inhibition of RNA helicase A activity. Thus, through the combined action of U2AF and RNA helicases, duplex RNA regions can be reversibly formed and displaced. Such reactions appear to be critical for pre-mRNA splicing, translation, and transcription."

In addition to heterodimeric RT (p66/p51), ribonucleoprotein complexes containing either the p66 or p51 subunit were analyzed. Footprinting experiments employed both structure- and sequence-specific nucleases. Our results indicate a similar mode of interaction for the three RT preparations tested, suggesting contact with each loop of the tRNA primer (D, anticodon, and T psi C), as well as minor perturbation of the anticodon stem. Although there is little evidence for extensive disruption of the 3'-acceptor stem. RNase A footprinting data with natural and synthetic tRNA suggests that potential base pairing between the T psi C and D loops is disrupted in the presence of RT."
https://openalex.org/W1485752635,"Abstract Testicular androgens suppress the synthesis and secretion of the pituitary gonadotropins, in particular, luteinizing hormone. This suppressive effect includes transcription of both the common alpha subunit gene and the unique beta subunit genes. Herein, we demonstrate that 1500 base pairs (bp) of proximal 5'-flanking region derived from the human alpha subunit gene and a shorter 315-bp segment of the bovine alpha subunit gene confer negative regulation by androgen to the gene encoding bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase in transgenic mice. Cotransfection assays with human androgen receptor indicated that the 1500-bp promoter region of the human alpha subunit gene also confers androgen regulation (transcriptional suppression) to reporter genes in both pituitary and placental cell lines. This raises the possibility of a role for DNA binding in suppression of alpha subunit transcription by activated androgen receptor. Consistent with this possibility, we have used a gel-mobility shift assay to detect several high affinity binding sites for androgen receptor located in the proximal promoter of the human alpha subunit gene. The strongest androgen receptor binding site is located at approximately -101 in the proximal 5'-flanking region. This steroid receptor binding site overlaps another binding site that defines one of several contiguous cis-acting regulatory elements required for basal transcriptional activity. Thus, binding of activated androgen receptor to this region may block the binding of a requisite trans-acting factor and lead to an attenuation in transcription. We conclude that this interaction, which occurs directly at the level of the pituitary, represents one of several physiological avenues through which androgens regulate gonadotropin gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1583310787,"The cDNA encoding human dCMP deaminase was isolated from a lambda ZAPII expression library using an antibody generated against highly purified HeLa cell dCMP deaminase. The cloned cDNA consists of 1856 base pairs and encodes a protein of 178 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 19,985 daltons. The sequence of several cyanogen bromide-cleaved peptides derived from HeLa cell dCMP deaminase are all contained within the deduced amino acid sequence. A zinc binding region is present in the enzyme, similar to that reported for cytidine deaminase (Yang, E. C., Carlow, D., Wolfenden, R., and Short, S. A. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 4168-4174). Northern blot analysis revealed a predominant messenger RNA species of 1.9 kilobases. Expression of the active protein to about 10% of Escherichia coli's total protein was achieved by subcloning the open reading frame into a high expression system using the polymerase chain reaction. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a prominent protein band which comigrated with affinity purified HeLa dCMP deaminase, while Western blot analysis yielded an immunoreactive band which comigrated with the single immunoreactive affinity column purified dCMP deaminase band. The enzyme which possesses a kcat of 1.02 x 10(3) s-1 was purified to homogeneity in over 60% yield. The overexpression of dCMP deaminase should permit more exacting studies on the regulation of this important allosteric enzyme which provides substrate for DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1570300904,"Strain SPB-1 is a temperature-sensitive Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant defective in sphingoid base biosynthesis. To examine the effects of sphingolipid deficiency on a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored protein, we constructed transfectants expressing mouse CD14 from the SPB-1 and the wild type cells. When the cells were precultured in a sphingolipid-deficient medium at 39 degrees C, CD14 expressed in the SPB-1 cells was hypersensitive to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), compared with that in the wild type cells. Moreover, after exposure of the cells to fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of ceramide synthase, CD14, even in the wild type cells, became hypersensitive to PI-PLC. The PI-PLC hypersensitivity in the SPB-1 cells was almost completely suppressed when the cells were cultured in the presence of exogenous sphingosine or sphingomyelin. On the other hand, the hypersensitivity induced by fumonisin B1 was suppressed by exogenous sphingomyelin but not by sphingosine. The suppression by exogenous glucosylceramide was partial under both conditions. Likewise, CD14 molecules in membranes prepared from the sphingolipid-deficient cells were more sensitive to PI-PLC than those from the control cells. These results indicated that a deficiency in cellular complex sphingolipids caused the PI-PLC hypersensitivity of CD14, suggesting the interaction of CD14 with sphingolipids in membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1592689922,"Mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) store and release serotonin whose synthesis is initiated by tryptophan 5-monooxygenase. (6R)-H4biopterin serves as the natural cofactor for this reaction. GTP cyclohydrolase I catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of its synthesis. In this study we demonstrate that among a panel of growth-promoting cytokines including kit ligand (KL), interleukin 3 (IL-3), IL-4, IL-9, and nerve growth factor, KL selectively enhances the synthesis of H4biopterin through up-regulation of GTP cyclohydrolase I activity to 6.2-fold levels. The activities of the subsequent enzymes 6-pyruvoyl-H4pterin synthase and sepiapterin reductase remain unaffected. The activity of tryptophan 5-monooxygenase was selectively enhanced 4.5-fold by the combination of IL-3 with KL. All other factors could not substitute for KL. The constitutive high activity of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase is not different in cells cultured in IL-3 and/or KL. In consequence, the concerted action of IL-3 and KL on the GTP cyclohydrolase I and the tryptophan 5-monooxygenase reaction enhances the production of serotonin to about 20-fold levels. Additionally, KL specifically causes the release of about half of total serotonin produced. Hence, our data demonstrate a novel role of these cytokines for the function of mouse BMMC and provide a coherent view of the regulation of serotonin synthesis in this cell type."
https://openalex.org/W1562758634,"Expression of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in epithelial cells is known to be down-regulated by the action of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). We show here that in addition to suppressing the rate of transcription of the CFTR gene, PMA treatment stimulates degradation of the CFTR protein. HT-29 colon epithelial cells and the CFTR-transfected pancreatic cells PLJ-4.7 lost 55-80% of their CFTR protein after 3-6 h of treatment with 100 nM PMA, as analyzed by quantitative Western blotting. In contrast to PMA, actinomycin D and cycloheximide reduced the CFTR protein content by 19 and 9% in HT-29 cells and by 22 and 40% in PLJ-4.7 cells, respectively, while inhibiting total cellular RNA and protein synthesis by over 80%. The PMA-induced loss of CFTR was partially reversed by the protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X. The PMA-induced degradation of CFTR may represent a regulatory pathway for terminating CFTR-mediated chloride and mucin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1558885214,"By means of selective extraction in a Ca(2+)-chelating medium and immunoblotting, four annexins (I, II, V, and VI) were identified in both isolated rat renal glomeruli and rat glomerular mesangial cells. Upon 32P labeling of these cells in culture, annexin I was immunoprecipitated using a specific polyclonal antibody and was found to incorporate radioactivity in a constitutive manner. However, as with epidermal growth factor (200 ng/ml), addition of angiotensin II (10(-7) M), arginine-vasopressin (10(-7) M), or endothelin I (10(-7) M) resulted in a 2-3-fold stimulation of annexin I phosphorylation. The basal phosphorylation as well as the stimulating effect of angiotensin II were also detected by immunoblotting annexin extracts using an antiphosphotyrosine antibody. In addition, among various phosphotyrosyl proteins isolated from EGTA extracts by adsorption onto an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, annexin I was specifically recognized by Western blotting using a monoclonal anti-annexin I antibody, and displayed the same increase upon cell stimulation with angiotensin II. Moreover, thin layer chromatographic analysis of phosphoamino acids present in immunoprecipitated [32P]annexin I showed an exclusive labeling of phosphotyrosine residue(s). Finally, the effect of angiotensin II was detectable after 10 min, maximal at 6 h, and present until 12 h of incubation. Using 12-h stimulation, tyrosine phosphorylation of annexin I displayed a maximum at 10(-7) to 10(-6) M angiotensin II. These data report for the first time the stimulation of annexin I tyrosine phosphorylation by biologically active peptides acting via receptors belonging to the superfamily of seven hydrophobic domain, G-protein-linked receptors, which lack an intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase. This suggests a possible role of annexin I in the mitogenic effect of angiotensin II, arginine-vasopressin, and endothelin I, which was previously observed on rat glomerular mesangial cells as well as on other cells."
https://openalex.org/W1528583344,"Abstract The rpsU-dnaG-rpoD operon messenger RNA that encodes S21, primase, and sigma-70 is cleaved under normal physiological conditions. The dnaG coding portion of the mRNA is then rapidly degraded. An endonuclease activity has been isolated from wild type Escherichia coli cells that cleaves dnaG mRNA. This activity has been identified as RNase E, and the identity confirmed by the accumulation of the unprocessed operon polycistronic mRNA in RNase E mutants, rne-3071 and ams-1, when incubated at nonpermissive temperatures. Extracts prepared from RNase E mutant strains failed to cleave dnaG mRNA in vitro. The dnaG mRNA RNase E cleavage site (5'-AAGUGAUUUA-3') is only 50% homologous to the ribosomal RNA RNase E cleavage site. By using computer programs predicting secondary structure, the dnaG RNase E cleavage site appears to be in a single stranded RNA loop."
https://openalex.org/W9767703,"A stable subunit of Maackia amurensis leukoagglutinin (MMAL) was prepared by the selective reduction of disulfide bridges between the subunits followed by alkylation with 4-vinylpyridine. MMAL failed to precipitate fetuin, whereas it retained its ability to bind to the same glycoprotein coated on a plastic plate, indicating the monovalency of this derivative. This binding to immobilized fetuin was inhibited by a haptenic sugar, Neu5Ac alpha 2-3lactose, with the same inhibitory potency as against the native M. amurensis leukoagglutinin. Microscopic observation as well as flow cytometric analyses showed that Chinese hamster ovary cells were clearly stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled MMAL without any detectable agglutination. This staining was inhibited by the addition of fetuin or by the sugar chains of fetuin. Differences in the types of sialylated glycoconjugates on the cell surface of several cell lines were detected by the combined use of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled MMAL and the monomeric derivative of elderberry bark lectin (specific for the Neu5Ac alpha 2-6Gal/GalNAc sequence) by flow cytometry. These results demonstrate the usefulness of these monovalent derivatives of sialylated oligosaccharide-specific lectins as probes for the analysis of cell surface glycoconjugates containing sialic acid by the technique of flow cytometry."
https://openalex.org/W1486995212,"Prekallikrein, a glycoprotein involved in contact phase activation, circulates in plasma in the form of a binary complex with high molecular weight kininogen (H-kininogen). The binding to H-kininogen is mediated by the prekallikrein heavy chain consisting of four repetitive domains, A1-A4. To define more precisely the region(s) involved in kininogen binding, we have employed an affinity cross-linking strategy with a synthetic peptide of 31 residues which mimics the prekallikrein binding site of H-kininogen. Cross-linking of the radiolabeled peptide to (pre)kallikrein revealed a binding segment in the NH2-terminal portion of the prekallikrein heavy chain; another binding segment was located in the COOH-terminal part of the heavy chain. The latter binding segment is harbored by a previously identified fragment of the kallikrein heavy chain involved in H-kininogen binding (Page, J.D., and Colman, R.W. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 8143-8148). Chemical cleavage of the heavy chain cross-linked with the radiolabeled peptide mapped the NH2-terminal binding segment to 60 residues (positions 53-112) of A1. Synthesis of a peptide (positions 56-86) and development of specific antibodies to this peptide narrowed down the kininogen binding segment to 31 residues of the center portion of A1. This NH2-terminal segment is equivalent to a kininogen binding site previously identified in factor XI (Baglia, F.A., Jameson, B.A., and Walsh, P.N. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 4247-4252). We conclude that prekallikrein exposes at least two segments on its heavy chain portion which form a continuous surface thereby facilitating the intimate binding of the zymogen to its nonenzymatic cofactor, H-kininogen."
https://openalex.org/W1522862396,"By computer analysis of the amino acid sequence of human interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and of the human type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1RI), we have identified two hydropathically complementary peptides (Fassina, G., Roller, P. P., Olson, A. D., Thorgeirsson, S. S., and Omichinski, J. G. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 11252-11257) capable of binding to each other. The sequence of the IL-1 beta peptide corresponds to that of residues 88-99 (loop 7 of the crystal structure of mature IL-1 beta) of mature IL-1 beta, one of the exposed and highly charged regions of the molecule. The substitution of this loop with an amino acid sequence of the same length but different hydropathic profile generates a mutant with drastically reduced binding activity to IL-1RI. In contrast, the binding affinity to the type II IL-1R (IL-1RII) is the same as that of wild type IL-1 beta. The results show that 1) loop 7 is part of the binding site of IL-1 beta to IL-1RI, but not to IL-1RII. 2) The structure of the mutant protein is not grossly altered except locally at the position of the substituted loop. 3) The substitution of amino acids by site-directed mutagenesis of the loop 7 region generates mutants with binding affinity constants slightly lower than that of wild type IL-1 beta and not comparable to that of the loop substitution analogue. 4. All mutants analyzed, including the loop substitutions, are biologically active, confirming the structural integrity of the proteins. We propose a binding site in which the cooperation of several low energy bonds extended over a wide area results in a high affinity complex between IL-1 and the type I receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1569129009,"Solution x-ray scattering using synchrotron radiation as an x-ray source has been used to study the solution structure of calmodulin complexed with substance P, a undecapeptide neurotransmitter. The x-ray data indicate that the complex has a compact globular structure, the formation of which is dependent upon the binding of Ca2+ to calmodulin. In the Ca(2+)-saturated condition, the radius of gyration of complexed calmodulin was 4.2 A smaller than that of uncomplexed calmodulin. The Ca(2+)-dependent change in radius of gyration of calmodulin with substance P is complete by the third and fourth Ca2+ binding. The behavior of the Guinier plot at small-to-moderate angles for uncomplexed calmodulin corresponds to a dumbbell shape. The Guinier plot for complexed calmodulin, however, corresponds to a non-dumbbell shape. The susceptibility of calmodulin to proteolytic attack with trypsin was used to examine the nature of the calmodulin complexed with substance P. In the presence of equimolar substance P, the first and second Ca2+ binding to calmodulin was enough to form a trypsin-resistant complex. These biochemical and x-ray data suggest that the binding of substance P to calmodulin is completed when the C-terminal half of calmodulin is occupied by Ca2+, while a significant structural change of calmodulin in the complex is still induced by successive Ca2+ occupancy on the N-terminal half of this molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1508994775,"Antigen presentation to helper T cells involves the formation of a trimolecular complex consisting of a class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen combined with an antigenic peptide on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell and a T cell receptor (TCR) on the T cell. The fate of the MHC class II, peptide, or TCR moieties of the ternary complex following antigen presentation is unknown. Using radiolabeled complexes of affinity-purified murine MHC class II molecules and peptides corresponding to T cell epitopes of myelin basic protein (MBP), this report presents evidence that the binding of preformed relevant MHC class II-peptide complexes to cloned T cells in vitro results in internalization of the peptide moiety. Neither the restricting MHC class II molecule nor the TCR moiety of the trimolecular complex was internalized by T cells. The specificity of peptide internalization was demonstrated using complexes of syngeneic MHC class II with an irrelevant MBP peptide analog and by cloned T cells restricted for a different epitope of the same MBP antigen. Furthermore, the peptide translocation mediated by MHC class II and TCR was demonstrated by antibody-blocking experiments using anti-class and anti-TCR monoclonal antibodies. The peptide internalization by T cells was markedly reduced when binding was performed at 4 degrees C as compared with 37 degrees C. In addition, a significant inhibition of peptide translocation was observed in the presence of a metabolic inhibitor (sodium azide) but not in the presence of cytochalasin B. These results together demonstrate that the in vitro interaction of soluble MHC II-peptide complexes with cloned T cells is an active process associated with uptake of the antigenic peptide."

https://openalex.org/W1515940369,"Activation of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase is thought to initiate a chain of phosphorylation changes which regulate various metabolic and growth processes. Insulin has been shown to regulate some kinases by affecting their phosphorylation states; however, direct connections between activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase and subsequent altered phosphorylations of these kinases have yet to be established. To define the constituents of these regulated phosphorylation cascade systems, the time course of insulin-induced phosphorylation changes has been examined. 32P-Labeled H4IIE hepatoma cells were treated with insulin for 5-300 s, and then cell extracts were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Computer analysis of autoradiograms was employed to quantify insulin-induced phosphorylation changes. Phosphotyrosine was assessed by KOH digestion, by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation, and by phenylarsine oxide treatment. Insulin induced a hierarchy of phosphorylation changes over the 300-s time course, with most increases being detectable within 10 s. Of these, only four did not undergo enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation. Eight proteins were found to undergo transient phosphorylation changes. Phenylarsine oxide elicited the appearance of novel low molecular weight phosphoproteins. These results support the concept of insulin-directed phosphorylation cascades, but indicate the magnitude of potential targets of the insulin receptor has been underestimated."
https://openalex.org/W172027048,"Seven monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were raised against a rabbit renal brush-border glycoprotein (molecular mass, 63-66 kDa), presumably involved in Na+/Pi cotransport, which we had previously purified and reconstituted in active form in proteoliposomes (Debiec, H., Lorenc, R., and Ronco, P. M. (1992) Biochem. J. 286, 97-102). Antibody specificity for the 63-66-kDa protein was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed by Western blotting and immunoaffinity chromatography of solubilized brush-border membranes (BBM), which both yielded a single 63-66-kDa band. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting of renal cortical cell subfractions localized the immunoreactive protein to the brush-border membrane. This location was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence of kidney cortex sections. Binding of two of the seven mAbs (63A20 and 206A126) to native BBM only occurred when the related epitope was exposed in the presence or absence of Na+, respectively; the other mAbs did not react with native BBM probably because of intramembranous orientation of the epitopes. mAb 63A20 inhibited dose-dependently Na+/Pi cotransport when preincubation of BBM was carried out in the presence of Na+ but did not affect Na+/D-glucose cotransport. Proteoliposomes formed from BBM proteins depleted of the 63-66-kDa protein by affinity chromatography with mAb 63A20 showed an 85% reduction in Na+/Pi cotransport, whereas Na+/D-glucose cotransport was not modified. These results thus establish that the 63-66-kDa BBM protein is the essential component of the Na+/Pi cotransport system. The present study also provides the first immunologic tools available for immunohistochemical localization of the Na+/Pi cotransporter. Finally, the identification of a functional epitope by mAb 63A20 opens up new ways to explore the molecular aspects of Pi uptake."
