https://openalex.org/W2157254946,"A highly ordered metal nanohole array (platinum and gold) was fabricated by a two-step replication of the honeycomb structure of anodic porous alumina. Preparation of the negative porous structure of porous alumina followed by the formation of the positive structure with metal resulted in a honeycomb metallic structure. The metal hole array of the film has a uniform, closely packed honeycomb structure approximately 70 nanometers in diameter and from 1 to 3 micrometers thick. Because of its textured surface, the metal hole array of gold showed a notable color change compared with bulk gold."
https://openalex.org/W2080153486,"The cell cycle of Prochlorococcus, a prokaryote that accounts for a sizable fraction of the photosynthetic biomass in the eastern equatorial Pacific, progressed in phase with the daily light cycle. DNA replication occurred in the afternoon and cell division occurred at night. Growth rates were maximal (about one doubling per day) at 30 meters and decreased toward the surface and the bottom of the ocean. Estimated Prochlorococcus production varied between 174 and 498 milligrams of carbon per square meter per day and accounted for 5 to 19 percent of total gross primary production at the equator. Because Prochlorococcus multiplies close to its maximum possible rate, it is probably not severely nutrient-limited in this region of the oceans."
https://openalex.org/W2165490846,"Long-period surface-wave (R(1), G(1)), body-wave (S, SS, SSS), and ScS-reverberation data have been inverted to obtain anisotropic structures along seismic corridors that sample Australia and the western Pacific. These models support the proposal that the Lehmann discontinuity beneath stable continents represents a transition from an anisotropic lithosphere to a more isotropic material in the lower part of the continental tectosphere."

https://openalex.org/W2019975667,"Determining the detailed photoreactivity of radicals that are of importance in atmospheric processes requires information from both laboratory and field measurements and theoretical calculations. Laboratory experiments and quantum calculations have been used to develop a comprehensive understanding of the photoreactivity of chlorine dioxide (OCIO). The photoreactivity is strongly dependent on the medium (gas phase, liquid solution, or cryogenic matrix). These data reveal details of the complex chemistry of OCIO. The potential role of this radical in stratospheric ozone depletion is discussed in accord with these laboratory measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2048913148,A general methodology is presented for the dispersion of an inorganic compound within an organic polymer host through the use of solubilizing and polymerizable ligands. The dispersion of metal cluster cations 10 angstroms in diameter within a polymer host is achieved by free-radical polymerization of the hexafunctional metal cluster [Mo(6)Cl(8)(NVI)(6)](triflate)(4) with bound polymerizable ligands in N-vinylimidazole (NVI) solutions. Copolymerization of the activated cluster-bound ligands with the surrounding medium probably plays a key role in preventing aggregation and produces near monodisperse molecular clusters within the polymer matrix.

https://openalex.org/W1976059994,Individual pentacene-d(14) molecules doped into a p-terphenyl-d(14) host crystal have been studied by optically detected electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The magnetic resonance transitions between the triplet sublevels of the pentacene molecule and the splitting of the resonance lines for a molecule that contains a carbon-13 nucleus have been observed in an external magnetic field. This splitting is caused by the hyperfine interaction of the triplet electron spin with the single carbon-13 nuclear spin.
