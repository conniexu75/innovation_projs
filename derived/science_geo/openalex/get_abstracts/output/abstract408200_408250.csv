Here, we demonstrate that preformed fibrils generated from full-length and truncated recombinant α-syn enter primary neurons, probably by adsorptive-mediated endocytosis, and promote recruitment of soluble endogenous α-syn into insoluble PD-like LBs and LNs. Remarkably, endogenous α-syn was sufficient for formation of these aggregates, and overexpression of wild-type or mutant α-syn was not required. LN-like pathology first developed in axons and propagated to form LB-like inclusions in perikarya. Accumulation of pathologic α-syn led to selective decreases in synaptic proteins, progressive impairments in neuronal excitability and connectivity, and, eventually, neuron death. Thus, our data contribute important insights into the etiology and pathogenesis of PD-like α-syn inclusions and their impact on neuronal functions, and they provide a model for discovering therapeutics targeting pathologic α-syn-mediated neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2041663579,"In vivo silencing in specific cell types remains the main obstacle for therapeutic applications of siRNAs. Leuschner et al. now show that an optimized lipid nanoparticle delivers siRNA to inflammatory monocytes in mice and, when transporting CCR2 siRNA, has therapeutic effects in cardiovascular disease, cancer and transplant rejection. Excessive and prolonged activity of inflammatory monocytes is a hallmark of many diseases with an inflammatory component. In such conditions, precise targeting of these cells could be therapeutically beneficial while sparing many essential functions of the innate immune system, thus limiting unwanted effects. Inflammatory monocytes—but not the noninflammatory subset—depend on the chemokine receptor CCR2 for localization to injured tissue. Here we present an optimized lipid nanoparticle and a CCR2-silencing short interfering RNA that, when administered systemically in mice, show rapid blood clearance, accumulate in spleen and bone marrow, and localize to monocytes. Efficient degradation of CCR2 mRNA in monocytes prevents their accumulation in sites of inflammation. Specifically, the treatment attenuates their number in atherosclerotic plaques, reduces infarct size after coronary artery occlusion, prolongs normoglycemia in diabetic mice after pancreatic islet transplantation, and results in reduced tumor volumes and lower numbers of tumor-associated macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2097804771,"Mark Daly, Manuel Rivas and colleagues used next-generation sequencing to study the coding exons of 56 genes from regions previously associated with Crohn's disease. Follow-up analyses in independent case-control series confirmed association of many newly discovered rare variants with disease risk. More than 1,000 susceptibility loci have been identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of common variants; however, the specific genes and full allelic spectrum of causal variants underlying these findings have not yet been defined. Here we used pooled next-generation sequencing to study 56 genes from regions associated with Crohn's disease in 350 cases and 350 controls. Through follow-up genotyping of 70 rare and low-frequency protein-altering variants in nine independent case-control series (16,054 Crohn's disease cases, 12,153 ulcerative colitis cases and 17,575 healthy controls), we identified four additional independent risk factors in NOD2, two additional protective variants in IL23R, a highly significant association with a protective splice variant in CARD9 (P < 1 × 10−16, odds ratio ≈ 0.29) and additional associations with coding variants in IL18RAP, CUL2, C1orf106, PTPN22 and MUC19. We extend the results of successful GWAS by identifying new, rare and probably functional variants that could aid functional experiments and predictive models."

Whether Sox2 continues to play a role in adult tissues remains largely unknown. We show here that Sox2 marks adult cells in several epithelial tissues where its expression has not previously been characterized, including the stomach, cervix, anus, testes, lens, and multiple glands. Genetic lineage tracing and transplantation experiments demonstrate that Sox2-expressing cells continuously give rise to mature cell types within these tissues, documenting their self-renewal and differentiation potentials. Consistent with these findings, ablation of Sox2+ cells in mice results in a disruption of epithelial tissue homeostasis and lethality. Developmental fate mapping reveals that Sox2+ adult stem cells originate from fetal Sox2+ tissue progenitors. Thus, our results identify Sox2 expression in numerous adult endodermal and ectodermal stem cell compartments, which are critical for normal tissue regeneration and survival.

While these observations indicate molecular commonalities among different somatic stem cells, these regulators are mostly absent in pluripotent stem cells. Another previous study documented that depletion of the zinc finger transcription factor Zfx1 (Galan-Caridad et al., 2007Galan-Caridad J.M. Harel S. Arenzana T.L. Hou Z.E. Doetsch F.K. Mirny L.A. Reizis B. Zfx controls the self-renewal of embryonic and hematopoietic stem cells.Cell. 2007; 129: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) affects the self-renewal of both embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and hematopoietic stem cells, suggesting common mechanisms between pluripotent stem cells and this mesodermal stem cell type. However, Zfx1 is also expressed in differentiated cells and its role in endodermal and ectodermal stem cell compartments has not yet been described. Lastly, several reports have claimed that the pluripotency genes Oct4 and Nanog are expressed in adult stem cells, but analyses of reporter animals and genetic knockout studies failed to confirm these findings (Lengner et al., 2007Lengner C.J. Camargo F.D. Hochedlinger K. Welstead G.G. Zaidi S. Gokhale S. Scholer H.R. Tomilin A. Jaenisch R. Oct4 expression is not required for mouse somatic stem cell self-renewal.Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 403-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In contrast, accumulating evidence suggests that Sox2, which maintains pluripotency in concert with Oct4 and Nanog, may play additional roles in fetal and adult progenitors. Sox2 belongs to a large family of SRY-related HMG box transcription factors that are important during development and cellular differentiation (Lefebvre et al., 2007Lefebvre V. Dumitriu B. Penzo-Méndez A. Han Y. Pallavi B. Control of cell fate and differentiation by Sry-related high-mobility-group box (Sox) transcription factors.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 39: 2195-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Sox2 is initially expressed in the inner cell mass (ICM) and extraembryonic ectoderm of blastocysts (Avilion et al., 2003Avilion A.A. Nicolis S.K. Pevny L.H. Perez L. Vivian N. Lovell-Badge R. Multipotent cell lineages in early mouse development depend on SOX2 function.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). Embryos deficient for Sox2 lack a pluripotent ICM and fail early in development, while deletion of Sox2 in ESCs results in their inappropriate differentiation into trophectoderm-like cells (Masui et al., 2007Masui S. Nakatake Y. Toyooka Y. Shimosato D. Yagi R. Takahashi K. Okochi H. Okuda A. Matoba R. Sharov A.A. et al.Pluripotency governed by Sox2 via regulation of Oct3/4 expression in mouse embryonic stem cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Forced expression of Sox2, in combination with Oct4, Klf4, and c-Myc, endows somatic cells with pluripotency, giving rise to induced pluripotent stem cells (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors.Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18861) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results underline the importance of Sox2 in both the establishment and maintenance of pluripotent stem cells. Upon exit from pluripotency, Sox2 signaling is critical for the formation of several endodermal and ectodermal tissues during fetal development, including the nervous system (Bylund et al., 2003Bylund M.

More recently, Sox2 expression has also been reported in some adult tissues, such as progenitors of the brain (Brazel et al., 2005Brazel C.Y. Limke T.L. Osborne J.K. Miura T. Cai J. Pevny L. Rao M.S.

Rizzoti K. Dattani M. Lovell-Badge R. Robinson I.C. SOX2-expressing progenitor cells generate all of the major cell types in the adult mouse pituitary gland.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 2907-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Importantly, a systematic survey of Sox2 expression in adult tissues has not yet been performed. Furthermore, except for neural stem cells (Suh et al., 2007Suh H. Consiglio A. Ray J. Sawai T. D'Amour K.A. Gage F.H. In vivo fate analysis reveals the multipotent and self-renewal capacities of Sox2+ neural stem cells in the adult hippocampus.Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 515-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), genetic fate mapping data to assess the lineage relationship between fetal and adult Sox2+ cells, as well as that of Sox2+ adult cells and their putative progeny, are missing. In this study, we have developed mouse models to (1) systematically evaluate the Sox2 expression pattern, (2) determine the lineage relationship of Sox2+ cells, and (3) assess the functional importance of Sox2-expressing cells in adult tissues. In order to systematically evaluate the expression patterns of Sox2 in adult tissues, we generated Sox2-GFP indicator mice from ESCs targeted with a previously characterized knockin construct (Ellis et al., 2004Ellis P. Fagan B.M. Magness S.T. Hutton S. Taranova O. Hayashi S. McMahon A. Rao M. Pevny L. SOX2, a persistent marker for multipotential neural stem cells derived from embryonic stem cells, the embryo or the adult.Dev. Neurosci. 2004; 26: 148-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A ). Consistent with other reports (Avilion et al., 2003Avilion A.A. Nicolis S.K. Pevny L.H. Perez L. Vivian N. Lovell-Badge R. Multipotent cell lineages in early mouse development depend on SOX2 function.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar, Ellis et al., 2004Ellis P. Fagan B.M. Magness S.T. Hutton S. Taranova O. Hayashi S. McMahon A. Rao M. Pevny L. SOX2, a persistent marker for multipotential neural stem cells derived from embryonic stem cells, the embryo or the adult.Dev. Neurosci. 2004; 26: 148-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), we detected strong GFP expression in blastocysts, neural progenitor cells (NPCs), and ESC cultures (Figure 1B), indicating that the knockin allele faithfully reports Sox2 expression in previously documented Sox2+ cell types. We next assessed GFP expression in adult tissues of Sox2-GFP mice by performing immunohistochemistry (IHC) on isolated, paraffin-embedded tissues. In agreement with previous observations, Sox2-GFP signal was detected in the subventricular zone of the brain, neural retina, trachea, bronchiolar epithelium of the lungs, tongue, and dermal papillae of the hair follicles (Figure S1 available online and data not shown). In addition, we identified Sox2-GFP expression in the seminiferous and lens epithelium and glandular stomach, as well as in squamous epithelia lining the esophagus, forestomach, anus, and cervix (Figure 1C and Figures S1 and S3D). In accordance with the observation that Sox2-GFP expression is enriched within phenotypically immature basal cells in adult squamous epithelia, its expression patterns resemble those of the basal progenitor cell marker p63 in these tissues (Yang et al., 1998Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dötsch V. Andrews N.C. Caput D. McKeon F. p63, a p53 homolog at 3q27-29, encodes multiple products with transactivating, death-inducing, and dominant-negative activities.Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1840) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C and Figures S1 and S3D). Sox2-GFP signal in the testes was confined to individual and rare cells adjacent to the basement membrane, consistent with the previously defined location of stem cells (Yoshida, 2010Yoshida S. Stem cells in mammalian spermatogenesis.Dev. Growth Differ. 2010; 52: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C). Single Sox2+ cells were also detected in gastric units of the glandular stomach, composed of the so-called corpus and pylorus compartments that have been suggested to contain stem cells (Bjerknes and Cheng, 2002Bjerknes M. Cheng H. Multipotential stem cells in adult mouse gastric epithelium.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2002; 283: G767-G777PubMed Google Scholar, Karam and Leblond, 1993Karam S.M. Leblond C.P. Dynamics of epithelial cells in the corpus of the mouse stomach. I. Identification of proliferative cell types and pinpointing of the stem cell.Anat. Rec. 1993; 236: 259-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C). Moreover, we identified rare Sox2+ cells within the mitotically active epithelial layer of the lens (Figure S1), which constitutes a stem cell niche (Graw, 2010Graw J. Eye development.Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2010; 90: 343-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar); in ganglion cells adjacent to kidney, prostate, uterus, and oral cavity; and in salivary, tracheal, and cervix-associated glands where it may mark stem or progenitor cells (Figures S2A and S2B). No GFP signal was seen in liver, kidney, heart, small intestine, colon, pancreas, or bone marrow (data not shown). The specificity of the Sox2-GFP IHC staining was confirmed by FACS analysis (Figure S2C) and IHC with a Sox2-specific antibody (Figure 1C and Figure S1). While FACS analysis showed GFP+ cells in all analyzed Sox2-GFP+ tissues, IHC for Sox2 failed to yield a signal in testes. This may indicate that Sox2 protein levels are lower in testes compared with those in other tissues or, alternatively, that Sox2 mRNA is not translated into protein. In support of the latter possibility, explanted germline stem cells have recently been shown to produce Sox2 mRNA, but no protein (Imamura et al., 2006Imamura M. Miura K. Iwabuchi K. Ichisaka T. Nakagawa M. Lee J. Kanatsu-Shinohara M. Shinohara T. Yamanaka S. Transcriptional repression and DNA hypermethylation of a small set of ES cell marker genes in male germline stem cells.BMC Dev. Biol. 2006; 6: 34Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The expanded expression domain of Sox2-GFP signal compared with Sox2 signal across squamous epithelia (Figure 1C) is likely caused by the long half-life of GFP. Together, our results show that Sox2 exhibits widespread expression in immature-appearing cells of multiple self-renewing epithelial tissues where it has not been previously detected in the adult. To test whether Sox2-expressing cells do in fact contain adult stem cells, we devised a genetic lineage tracing approach. In brief, we engineered ESCs to harbor a tamoxifen (TAM)-inducible Cre allele (CreER-T2) in the endogenous Sox2 locus (Figures 2A and 2B ). Additional targeting of a ROSA26-lox-STOP-lox (lsl)-EYFP reporter allele (Srinivas et al., 2001Srinivas S. Watanabe T. Lin C.S. William C.M. Tanabe Y. Jessell T.M. Costantini F. Cre reporter strains produced by targeted insertion of EYFP and ECFP into the ROSA26 locus.BMC Dev. Biol. 2001; 1: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (2305) Google Scholar) into these cells and subsequent exposure to the TAM analog 4-OHT gave rise to around 20% EYFP+ cells in treated, but not in untreated, ESC populations, thus validating the inducibility and specificity of the system (Figure 2C). Mice were generated from these ESCs to establish a stable colony of Sox2-CreER; ROSA26-lsl-EYFP animals for further analysis. Untreated Sox2-CreER; ROSA26-lsl-EYFP animals and mice treated with solvent (corn oil) alone showed extremely rare and thus negligible spontaneous labeling events in lung, stomach, and brain (data not shown). In order to permanently label Sox2-expressing cells and their progeny in vivo, we initially injected TAM intraperitoneally on 4 consecutive days into a cohort of 3- to 6-week-old Sox2-CreER; ROSA26-lsl-EYFP animals (Figure 2D). Tissues were isolated immediately after the treatment (“pulse”) or at different time points thereafter (“chase”). If Sox2 expression marks stem cells, we would expect to find permanent labeling of both the putative Sox2+ stem cells and differentiated progeny (Figure 2E). However, if Sox2+ cells are short-lived progenitors, we would expect to see transient labeling of cells, which should disappear over time due to their replenishment by unlabeled stem cells. We first followed the fate of Sox2-expressing cells in testes because the differentiation structure of the seminiferous epithelium is relatively simple, with single spermatogonia (As), located at the basement membrane, continuously giving rise to more committed chained spermatogonia and ultimately mature sperm inside the tubules (Yoshida, 2010Yoshida S. Stem cells in mammalian spermatogenesis.Dev. Growth Differ. 2010; 52: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Immediately after the pulse, individual cells were labeled adjacent to the basement membrane, consistent with the observed Sox2-GFP expression pattern (Figure 2F, top row). After 1 month of chase, small chains of spermatogonia were EYFP+, and after 3 months of chase, entire sectors spanning from spermatogonia to mature sperm were labeled. These results demonstrate that individual Sox2+ cells give rise to more cells of their own, defined as immature spermatogonia lining the seminiferous epithelium, as well as differentiated progeny that continuously produce sperm cells, thus identifying Sox2+ cells as bona fide stem cells in testes. We noted that the labeling efficiency in testes was very low with, on average, only few labeled tubules detected per testis section. We speculate that this is a consequence of the observed low transcriptional activity of Sox2 in testes (Figure S2C). We next focused on the glandular stomach to follow the fate of Sox2+ cells. Analysis of Sox2-CreER; ROSA26-lsl-EYFP lineage tracing mice immediately after the 4 day administration of TAM showed the appearance of individual dispersed EYFP+ cells as well as small patches of EYFP+ cells, consistent with the notion that some rare Sox2+ cells had expanded over the 4 day pulse period (Figure 2F, middle rows). Importantly, 15–22 months after the pulse, entire glands were fully labeled in both the corpus and pylorus, suggesting that Sox2-expressing cells can self-renew and give rise to the mature cell types of the glandular stomach (Figure 2F and Figure S3A). It is worth mentioning that fully labeled corpus glands were observed less frequently than fully labeled pyloric glands at all time points and especially soon after the pulse (1–3 months), in agreement with a reported slower turnover rate of corpus cells (3–194 days) compared with pyloric cells (1–60 days) (Barker et al., 2010aBarker N. Bartfeld S. Clevers H. Tissue-resident adult stem cell populations of rapidly self-renewing organs.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 656-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Similar to the labeling patterns in glandular stomach and testes, individual EYFP+ cells were detected in the lens epithelium after the TAM pulse (Figure 2F, bottom row). Following the chase, basal cells remained labeled and also gave rise to mature lens fibers inside the lens body, consistent with their identity as stem cells. Next, we followed the fate of Sox2+ cells in squamous epithelia of the tongue, esophagus, forestomach, anus, and cervix. Analysis of these tissues immediately after the 4 day pulse identified individual EYFP+ cells or patches of labeled cells in the basal and suprabasal layers of the epithelia, but not in the differentiated layers, which is in agreement with the observed expression patterns of Sox2 (Figures S3B and S3D). However, when analyzing mice 1–3 months after the pulse, we observed clonal areas of EYFP+ cells stretching from the basal layer to the keratinized layer. This clonal pattern remained stable at 15–22 months of chase, suggesting that basal Sox2+ cells contain long-term stem cells that maintain these tissues. Of note, bronchiolar epithelial cells maintained stable EYFP+ clones over several months as well. EYFP+ cells were never found in the alveoli of the lungs, indicating that Sox2+ cells do not contain the precursors for alveolar cells under steady state conditions (Figure S3C, bottom panels). Moreover, we detected EYFP+ cells within the acini and ducts of sublingual glands after the pulse, which remained labeled over the long term, suggestive of putative stem cells (Lombaert and Hoffman, 2010Lombaert I.M. Hoffman M.P. Epithelial stem/progenitor cells in the embryonic mouse submandibular gland.Front. Oral. Biol. 2010; 14: 90-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (Figure S3C, top panels). To exclude the possibility that the observed labeling patterns were due to marking of transient postnatal progenitor cells, we repeated pulse-chase experiments on 6-month-old animals and analyzed tissue sections 12 months later. Consistent with the prior results, we detected fully labeled EYFP+ tissue clones in the testes, glandular stomach, and squamous epithelia, including tongue, esophagus, forestomach, and cervix (Figure S3E). However, we noticed a lower frequency of labeling in older mice compared with that in young animals, due to a decrease in Sox2+ stem cells, reduced efficiency of the lineage tracing system with age, or both. In contrast to Sox2+ squamous epithelia, lens, and testes, which harbor unipotent stem cells, gastric glands of the stomach are thought to contain multipotent stem cells that can, depending on the region, produce three or four common cell types throughout life (Barker et al., 2010aBarker N. Bartfeld S. Clevers H. Tissue-resident adult stem cell populations of rapidly self-renewing organs.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 656-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). These are the so-called mucus cells, parietal cells, enteroendocrine cells, and chief cells, with the latter cell type only found in the corpus. To further characterize Sox2+ stomach cells and their differentiated progeny, we first performed double labeling experiments with antibodies recognizing the major differentiated cell types of the stomach. This analysis revealed that Sox2-GFP+ cells were negative for all tested differentiation markers in pylorus and corpus (Figure 3A and Figure S4A), supporting the notion that they are uncommitted stem cells. In contrast, analysis of EYFP+ glands descending from lineage-traced Sox2+ cells 14 months after the pulse showed costaining of EYFP+ cells with markers of enteroendocrine cells, mucus cells, parietal cells, and chief cells (Figure 3B and Figure S4B). These data corroborate the conclusion that Sox2+ cells are multipotent stem cells in both the pylorus and corpus of the glandular stomach. Our observation that entirely labeled glands were still detectable up to 460 days after the pulse indicates that Sox2+ stem cells have self-renewal potential (Figures S3A and S3E). A previous study has shown that Lgr5+ cells function as multipotent stem cells of the pylorus (Barker et al., 2010bBarker N. Huch M. Kujala P. van de Wetering M. Snippert H.J. van Es J.H. Sato T. Stange D.E.

Lgr5-GFP+ cells were confirmed to be present at a frequency of three or four cells at the base of each gland, while we observed either one or two Sox2-GFP+ cells above the base of each gland (Figure 1C and Figure 3C). Interestingly, IHC for both Sox2 and GFP on pyloric sections of Lgr5-GFP-ires-CreER mice showed no apparent overlap in the expression of these two markers, suggesting that Lgr5 and Sox2 mark different types of stem cells in the pylorus (Figure 3C). However, we cannot exclude the existence of double-positive cells expressing low levels of the respective other marker that was beyond the threshold for IHC detection. Colabeling experiments of Sox2-GFP pyloric sections for GFP and the proliferation marker Ki67 further showed that roughly 50% of the Sox2+ cells are actively cycling (n = 45 Sox2-GFP nuclei), indicating that half of the Sox2+ cells may be quiescent under homeostatic conditions (Figure 3D). Analysis of Sox2-CreER; ROSA26-lsl-EYFP mice receiving only a single dose of TAM after 1 day and 1 week confirmed our observations that some Sox2+ cells are cycling and give rise to EYFP+ patches of cells after 1 week while some Sox2+ cells appear to be slow cycling and remain as singly labeled EYFP+ cells, respectively (Figure S4C). To confirm that Sox2 expression marks stem cells with an independent assay, we tested whether Sox2+ testis cells could reconstitute spermatogenesis in mice carrying a mutation in the c-kit gene (designated c-kitW/Wv) that ablates spermatogonial stem cells, thus rendering animals infertile (Brinster and Zimmermann, 1994Brinster R.L."
https://openalex.org/W2039909349,"This study reports that people are worse at incorporating negative information when updating their beliefs. Correspondingly, neural activity encodes desirable information updates, but there is weaker encoding of unexpectedly undesirable information. Unrealistic optimism is a pervasive human trait that influences domains ranging from personal relationships to politics and finance. How people maintain unrealistic optimism, despite frequently encountering information that challenges those biased beliefs, is unknown. We examined this question and found a marked asymmetry in belief updating. Participants updated their beliefs more in response to information that was better than expected than to information that was worse. This selectivity was mediated by a relative failure to code for errors that should reduce optimism. Distinct regions of the prefrontal cortex tracked estimation errors when those called for positive update, both in individuals who scored high and low on trait optimism. However, highly optimistic individuals exhibited reduced tracking of estimation errors that called for negative update in right inferior prefrontal gyrus. These findings indicate that optimism is tied to a selective update failure and diminished neural coding of undesirable information regarding the future."
https://openalex.org/W1988220777,"Network oscillations support transient communication across brain structures. We show here, in rats, that task-related neuronal activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), the hippocampus, and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), regions critical for working memory, is coordinated by a 4 Hz oscillation. A prominent increase of power and coherence of the 4 Hz oscillation in the PFC and the VTA and its phase modulation of gamma power in both structures was present in the working memory part of the task. Subsets of both PFC and hippocampal neurons predicted the turn choices of the rat. The goal-predicting PFC pyramidal neurons were more strongly phase locked to both 4 Hz and hippocampal theta oscillations than nonpredicting cells. The 4 Hz and theta oscillations were phase coupled and jointly modulated both gamma waves and neuronal spikes in the PFC, the VTA, and the hippocampus. Thus, multiplexed timing mechanisms in the PFC-VTA-hippocampus axis may support processing of information, including working memory."
https://openalex.org/W1999615421,"In the rodent vibrissal system, active sensation and sensorimotor integration are mediated in part by connections between barrel cortex and vibrissal motor cortex. Little is known about how these structures interact at the level of neurons. We used Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) expression, combined with anterograde and retrograde labeling, to map connections between barrel cortex and pyramidal neurons in mouse motor cortex. Barrel cortex axons preferentially targeted upper layer (L2/3, L5A) neurons in motor cortex; input to neurons projecting back to barrel cortex was particularly strong. Barrel cortex input to deeper layers (L5B, L6) of motor cortex, including neurons projecting to the brainstem, was weak, despite pronounced geometric overlap of dendrites with axons from barrel cortex. Neurons in different layers received barrel cortex input within stereotyped dendritic domains. The cortico-cortical neurons in superficial layers of motor cortex thus couple motor and sensory signals and might mediate sensorimotor integration and motor learning."
https://openalex.org/W2052591459,"Peptidic natural products are theoretically amenable to characterization by mass spectrometry, but proteomics programs are not trained to discover these compounds. A new strategy uses mass spectrometry and bioinformatics iteratively to rapidly identify both ribosomal and nonribosomal sequences, yielding multiple new compounds. Peptide natural products show broad biological properties and are commonly produced by orthogonal ribosomal and nonribosomal pathways in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. To harvest this large and diverse resource of bioactive molecules, we introduce here natural product peptidogenomics (NPP), a new MS–guided genome-mining method that connects the chemotypes of peptide natural products to their biosynthetic gene clusters by iteratively matching de novo tandem MS (MSn) structures to genomics-based structures following biosynthetic logic. In this study, we show that NPP enabled the rapid characterization of over ten chemically diverse ribosomal and nonribosomal peptide natural products of previously unidentified composition from Streptomycete bacteria as a proof of concept to begin automating the genome-mining process. We show the identification of lantipeptides, lasso peptides, linardins, formylated peptides and lipopeptides, many of which are from well-characterized model Streptomycetes, highlighting the power of NPP in the discovery of new peptide natural products from even intensely studied organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2006579769,"Canonical Wnt signaling has been implicated in the regulation of hematopoiesis. By employing a Wnt-reporter mouse, we observed that Wnt signaling is differentially activated during hematopoiesis, suggesting an important regulatory role for specific Wnt signaling levels.

By combining different targeted hypomorphic alleles and a conditional deletion allele of Apc, a gradient of five different Wnt signaling levels was obtained in vivo. We here show that different, lineage-specific Wnt dosages regulate hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), myeloid precursors, and T lymphoid precursors during hematopoiesis.

Canonical Wnt signaling is differentially regulated during hematopoiesis Mild levels of Wnt activation increase HSC whereas high Wnt dosage is detrimental Intermediate levels of Wnt signaling increase clonogenicity and myeloid development Early T cell development is enhanced by intermediate-high levels of Wnt signaling Hematopoiesis, i.e., the production of blood cells, is fully dependent on a rare population of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that have the capacity to self-renew and differentiate into all blood cell lineages. This process is strictly regulated by signals provided by the surrounding microenvironment of the different organs where hematopoiesis occurs (Wilson and Trumpp, 2006Wilson A. Trumpp A. Bone-marrow haematopoietic-stem-cell niches.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Although canonical Wnt signaling is recognized as one of the signaling cascades implicated in the regulation of HSC function as well as in other stages during hematopoiesis, its specific functional role has not been completely understood and is to date a matter of controversy (Blank et al., 2008Blank U. Karlsson G. Karlsson S. Signaling pathways governing stem-cell fate.Blood. 2008; 111: 492-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, Staal et al., 2008Staal F.J. Luis T.C. Tiemessen M.M. WNT signalling in the immune system: WNT is spreading its wings.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Activation of the Wnt pathway occurs upon binding of a soluble Wnt protein to a membrane-associated receptor and leads to the disruption and inhibition of a protein complex responsible for the phosphorylation and breakdown of β-catenin. Inhibition of this so-called destruction complex, composed of the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc), the Ser-Thr kinases glycogen synthase kinase 3β (Gsk-3β) and casein kinase I (CK-I), and the scaffold and tumor suppresor protein Axin, results in stabilization and accumulation of β-catenin. Upon its intracellular stabilization, β-catenin subsequently translocates to the nucleus where, together with the Tcf-Lef family of transcription factors, it activates a Wnt-controlled gene expression program. Besides the canonical Wnt pathway, which is mediated via β-catenin, other noncanonical Wnt signaling routes have been described, for instance those mediated by calcium signaling or c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) (Staal et al., 2008Staal F.J. Luis T.C. Tiemessen M.M. WNT signalling in the immune system: WNT is spreading its wings.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, Reya and Clevers, 2005Reya T. Clevers H. Wnt signalling in stem cells and cancer.Nature. 2005; 434: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (2858) Google Scholar). Canonical Wnt signaling has been implicated in the self-renewal of various stem cell compartments in the gut, mammary gland, skin, and embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Notably, Wnt signaling influences the capacity of ESCs to differentiate into the three main germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and definitive endoderm) in a dosage-dependent fashion (Kielman et al., 2002Kielman M.F. Rindapää M. Gaspar C. van Poppel N. Breukel C. van Leeuwen S. Taketo M.M. Roberts S. Smits R. Fodde R. Apc modulates embryonic stem-cell differentiation by controlling the dosage of beta-catenin signaling.Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 594-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In addition, different levels of activation of the pathway confer different degrees of tumor susceptibility in different tissues (Fodde et al., 2001Fodde R. Smits R. Clevers H.

These Wnt dosage-dependent effects also seem to hold true for adult self-renewing tissues such as gut and skin, although the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms still remain poorly understood (Gaspar and Fodde, 2004Gaspar C.

Cell. 2005; 9: 121-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In the hematopoietic system, a role for Wnt signaling was first demonstrated during T cell development in the thymus where it provides proliferation signals to immature thymocytes (reviewed in Rothenberg et al., 2008Rothenberg E.V. Moore J.E. Yui M.A. Launching the T-cell-lineage developmental programme.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, Staal et al., 2008Staal F.J. Luis T.C.

Indeed, Tcf1 deficiency affects the highly proliferative stages double-negative 2 (DN2) and DN4 (Schilham et al., 1998Schilham M.W. Wilson A. Moerer P. Benaissa-Trouw B.J. Cumano A. Clevers H.C.

Banerjee D. Huelsken J. Birchmeier W. Sen J.M. Deletion of beta-catenin impairs T cell development.Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 1177-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of the pathway by in vivo stabilization of β-catenin resulted in thymocyte development without the requirement of pre-TCR signaling and impaired transition from double-negative (DN) to double-positive (DP) stages of T cell development (Gounari et al., 2001Gounari F. Aifantis I. Khazaie K. Hoeflinger S. Harada N. Taketo M.M. von Boehmer H. Somatic activation of beta-catenin bypasses pre-TCR signaling and TCR selection in thymocyte development.Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 863-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Besides regulating T cell development in the thymus, Wnt signaling was also shown to play a role in the regulation of HSC function. We and others recently showed that Wnt is necessary for normal HSC function by employing either Wnt3a-deficient mice (Luis et al., 2009Luis T.C. Weerkamp F. Naber B.A. Baert M.R. de Haas E.F. Nikolic T. Heuvelmans S. De Krijger R.R. van Dongen J.J. Staal F.J. Wnt3a deficiency irreversibly impairs hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and leads to defects in progenitor cell differentiation.Blood. 2009; 113: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), by overexpressing the Wnt-negative regulator DKK1 in osteoblastic stem cell niche (Fleming et al., 2008Fleming H.E.

However Mx-Cre-mediated deletion of β-catenin (Cobas et al., 2004Cobas M. Wilson A. Ernst B. Mancini S.J. MacDonald H.R. Kemler R. Radtke F.

Simultaneous loss of beta- and gamma-catenin does not perturb hematopoiesis or lymphopoiesis.Blood. 2008; 111: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) did not affect hematopoiesis, probably because of the fact that Wnt signaling was not completely abolished in these models (Jeannet et al., 2008Jeannet G.

Besides these approaches to inhibit Wnt signaling, gain-of-function approaches to activate the pathway in HSCs were perfomed with conflicting results. Stabilized forms of β-catenin resulted in either enhancement of HSC function and maintenance of an immature phenotype (Baba et al., 2005Baba Y. Garrett K.P. Kincade P.W.

These differences may be explained by the different levels of Wnt pathway activation (Suda and Arai, 2008Suda T. Arai F.

Here, we studied the effect of different dosages of Wnt signaling activation on HSC self-renewal and differentiation capacity. To this aim, we used mouse models carrying specific hypomorphic mutations at the Apc gene resulting in specific Wnt signaling dosages (Fodde and Smits, 2001Fodde R. Smits R.

A new conditional Apc-mutant mouse model for colorectal cancer.Carcinogenesis. 2010; 31: 946-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The Apc gene encodes for a multifunctional protein that is most known for binding and downregulating β-catenin. By employing this in vivo approach, we show that differential, lineage-specific, optimal Wnt dosages regulate HSC, myeloid precursors, and T lymphoid precursors during hematopoiesis. In order to determine the activation status of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway during hematopoiesis, we employed the well-established Axin2LacZ Wnt reporter mice (Jeannet et al., 2008Jeannet G. Scheller M. Scarpellino L. Duboux S. Gardiol N. Back J. Kuttler F. Malanchi I. Birchmeier W.

Biol. 2002; 22: 1184-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). In these mice, a LacZ cassette is inserted in-frame with the start codon of the ubiquitous Wnt target gene Axin2/Conductin, allowing analysis of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by measuring β-galactosidase (LacZ) activity in vivo. Incubation of Axin2LacZ/+ bone-marrow (BM) cells with increasing concentrations of the Wnt signaling activator LiCl resulted in differential LacZ activity, showing that the reporter is sensitive to different levels of Wnt activation (see Figures S1A and S1B available online). Because Axin2 is also a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway, we also verified whether Axin2 haploinsufficiency would affect the hematopoietic system. In line with data from other developmental systems, the hematopoietic system of the Axin2+/LacZ mice was found to be overall normal when compared to mice not carrying the reporter transgene (Axin2+/+) (Figures S1C–S1H). Canonical Wnt signaling was active in most of the subsets analyzed (Figures 1, S2, and S3). A remarkable difference was observed in the different subsets in BM (Figures 1A and S2) compared to thymus (Figures 1B and S3). Thymocytes displayed higher levels of Wnt activation than cells in BM. Despite the absence or much reduced Wnt signaling levels in more mature myeloid and B cell subsets, the most immature progenitors from both these lineages undergo Wnt signaling activation, which is particularly high in the Pre/Pro-B subset. In the thymus, besides the generally higher activation levels, immature single-positive (ISP), DP, and SP stages showed a further signaling increase, in comparison to the double-negative (DN) subsets. Of notice, early thymic progenitors (ETP) showed a significantly lower Wnt activity, suggesting that only after entering the thymus do the T cell progenitors receive stronger Wnt signals. This is in agreement with the reported high expression of several Wnt genes in thymic stromal cells (Pongracz et al., 2003Pongracz J. Hare K. Harman B. Anderson G. Jenkinson E.J.

Wnt signaling in the thymus is regulated by differential expression of intracellular signaling molecules.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 3322-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Notably, the higher Wnt activity in the thymus was also reflected in a higher frequency of cells undergoing Wnt signaling, compared to the hematopoietic subsets in the BM (Figures 1C, 1D, S2, and S3). Analysis of Axin2 expression at molecular level by qRT-PCR similarly showed a higher expression in DN and DP thymocytes, in comparison to LSK cells in BM (Figure S3C). The differential Wnt signaling activity in distinct hematopoietic lineages suggested that specific levels of pathway activation could differentially affect hematopoiesis. To investigate whether Wnt signaling regulates HSC self-renewal and differentiation in a dosage-dependent fashion, we analyzed the effects of different targeted mutations in the Apc gene. With combinations of two different hypomorphic alleles and a conditional deletion allele of Apc, a gradient of five different levels of Wnt signaling in vivo was obtained. Apc1572T and Apc1638N alleles were previously generated by targeting amino acid residues 1572 and 1638 on exon 15, which encodes nearly all Wnt regulatory sequences in the Apc gene (Fodde et al., 1994Fodde R. Edelmann W. Yang K. van Leeuwen C. Carlson C. Renault B. Breukel C. Alt E. Lipkin M. Khan P.M. et al.A targeted chain-termination mutation in the mouse Apc gene results in multiple intestinal tumors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The Apc1572T allele encodes for a truncated protein encompassing all β-catenin binding domains, three of the seven β-catenin degradation repeats, but none of the Axin/conductin binding (SAMP) motifs. The Apc1638N allele encodes for a slightly longer protein (encompassing only one SAMP motif). This mutation results in an unstable mRNA, leading to the very low expression of a truncated Apc protein (approximately 2% of the wild-type protein level) (schematically depicted in Figure 2A ). Hence, these targeted mutations result in different levels and lengths of truncated Apc proteins, consequently leading to different levels of Wnt pathway activation (Fodde and Smits, 2001Fodde R.

Because homozygosity for these Apc mutations leads to early embryonic lethality (Fodde et al., 1994Fodde R. Edelmann W. Yang K. van Leeuwen C. Carlson C. Renault B. Breukel C. Alt E. Lipkin M.

A targeted constitutive mutation in the APC tumor suppressor gene underlies mammary but not intestinal tumorigenesis.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000547Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we combined them with a conditional Apc mutant allele (Apc15lox) where Apc exon 15 is flanked by LoxP sequences which, upon Cre-mediated recombination, lead to an Apc-null allele (Robanus-Maandag et al., 2010Robanus-Maandag E.C.

The two hypomorphic alleles, the conditional deletion allele, and the wild-type Apc allele were then bred in order to obtain different compound heterozygous mouse lines providing a gradient of Wnt signaling activation above normal. Deletion of Apc exon 15 within the Apc15lox allele was performed ex vivo by using the retroviral Cre gene transduction system (Figure 2B; Loonstra et al., 2001Loonstra A. Vooijs M. Beverloo H.B.

De novo DNA methyltransferase is essential for self-renewal, but not for differentiation, in hematopoietic stem cells.J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Lin−Sca1+c-Kit+ (LSK) cells, which are highly enriched for HSCs, were isolated from the BM of mice carrying different Apc allele combinations and transduced with pMSCV-Cre-IRES-GFP retrovirus (Figure S4A). LSK cells from wild-type mice (Apc+/+) transduced with the same viral construct were employed as control for all experiments. Three days after transduction, deletion was virtually complete in GFP-positive cells, as shown both at the DNA (Figure 2C) and mRNA (Figure 2D) levels. To test whether the different combinations of Apc alleles lead to different levels of Wnt signaling activation in HSCs, Axin2 expression was determined by qRT-PCR on GFP+ cells. The Apc15lox allele in heterozygosity (Apc15lox/+) or in combination with the Apc1572T allele (Apc15lox/1572T) leads to a mild (2-fold) or intermediate (4-fold) increase of activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, respectively, when compared to wild-type levels (Figure 2E). The combination of Apc15lox and Apc1638N alleles (Apc15lox/1638N) results in a high activation level of the pathway (22-fold), which is in the same range of activation obtained with conditional deletion of β-catenin exon-3 (Ctnb1Δex3; 20-fold), leading to its constitutive stabilization (Figures 2E and 2F; Harada et al., 1999Harada N. Tamai Y. Ishikawa T. Sauer B. Takaku K. Oshima M. Taketo M.M.

Finally, the Apc15lox allele when bred to homozygozity (Apc15lox/15lox) results in an extremely high (72-fold) activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. In agreement, the increased expression of Axin2 correlated with increased accumulation of β-catenin (Figures S4B and S4C). No evidence of significantly altered proliferation or survival was observed after 3 days of culture (Figure S4D). Hence, by combining three different targeted Apc mutant alleles, a gradient of five different levels of Wnt activation was obtained, enabling us to study Wnt dosage-dependent effects. To this aim, deleted GFP+ LSKs from mice carrying the above genotypes were employed for in vivo and in vitro assays. We used methylcellulose colony-forming assays to determine clonogenic and differentiation potential of LSK cells from the different Apc mouse lines. Apc15lox/+ and Apc15lox/1572T GFP+ LSKs caused an increase of approximately 2-fold in the number of colonies, in comparison to Apc+/+ GFP+ LSKs (p < 0.05). This was mainly due to an increase in granulocytic-monocytic (GM) and monocytic (M) colony-forming units (CFU), suggesting that mild to intermediate levels of Wnt signaling activation results in increased clonogenicity and myeloid differentiation potential. Notably, a strong reduction in the number of colonies was observed with the higher levels of Wnt activation (Figure 3A ). Importantly, analysis of c-Kit expression in the colonies revealed that increasing Wnt signaling activity results in increased frequency of c-Kit+ cells and, therefore, leads to the maintenance of an immature phenotype (Figure 3B). PCR analysis on genomic DNA from day 9 colonies revealed efficient deletion of the floxed exon 15 (Figure S6A). Moreover, the gradient of Wnt signaling activation was maintained during culture as determined by Axin2 expression (data not shown). To quantitatively determine the effects of increasing levels of Wnt signaling on HSC function, we performed competitive limiting-dilution transplantation assays via the CD45.1/CD45.2 system. Mildly increased activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, corresponding to the haploinsufficient Apc15lox/+ genotype, resulted in a 6-fold increase in the frequency of repopulating cells, in comparison to the wild-type condition (Apc+/+ GFP+ LSKs) (Figure 4A ). The frequency of competitive repopulating units (CRU) increased from 1/40371 (Apc+/+) to 1/6717 (Apc15lox/+), 12 weeks after transplantation (p = 0.009). In contrast, intermediate (Apc15lox/1572T) and higher (Apc15lox/1638N and Apc15lox/15lox) levels of Wnt signaling activation resulted in a total impairment in repopulation capacity (Figures 4A and 4B). The increased repopulation capacity conferred by mildly increased Wnt levels was also observed by an approximately 3-fold increase in the level of chimerism in mice transplanted with Apc15lox/+ cells, when compared to Apc+/+ cells, 12 weeks after transplantation (p = 0.011) (Figures 4C and 4D). Analysis of the HSC compartment in the BM of the recipient mice also showed an increase in the number of GFP+ LSKs (p = 0.06, Figures 4E and 4F). Furthermore, secondary transplantation of these cells showed efficient repopulation of lethally irradiated CD45.1 recipients. Twelve weeks after transplantation in secondary recipients, the advantage showed by the Apc15lox/+ cells could still be observed in total BM"
https://openalex.org/W1992885630,"In mammalian cells, long-range vesicular transport is thought to occur via microtubule tracks. However, Schuh reports the existence of an actin-based pathway for long-range trafficking in mouse oocytes by showing that Rab11a-positive vesicles are decorated with actin-nucleating formin proteins. She finds that these proteins assemble actin networks that guide vesicles to the cell surface. Intracellular transport is vital for the function, survival and architecture of every eukaryotic cell. Long-range transport in animal cells is thought to depend exclusively on microtubule tracks. This study reveals an unexpected actin-dependent but microtubule-independent mechanism for long-range transport of vesicles. Vesicles organize their own actin tracks by recruiting the actin nucleation factors Spire1, Spire2 and Formin-2, which assemble an extensive actin network from the vesicles’ surfaces. The network connects the vesicles with one another and with the plasma membrane. Vesicles move directionally along these connections in a myosin-Vb-dependent manner to converge and to reach the cell surface. The overall outward-directed movement of the vesicle-actin network is driven by recruitment of vesicles to the plasma membrane in the periphery of the oocyte. Being organized in a dynamic vesicle-actin network allows vesicles to move in a local random manner and a global directed manner at the same time: they can reach any position in the cytoplasm, but also move directionally to the cell surface as a collective. Thus, collective movement within a network is a powerful and flexible mode of vesicle transport."
https://openalex.org/W2019492932,"Autism spectrum disorders such as Rett syndrome (RTT) have been hypothesized to arise from defects in experience-dependent synapse maturation. RTT is caused by mutations in MECP2, a nuclear protein that becomes phosphorylated at S421 in response to neuronal activation. We show here that disruption of MeCP2 S421 phosphorylation in vivo results in defects in synapse development and behavior, implicating activity-dependent regulation of MeCP2 in brain development and RTT. We investigated the mechanism by which S421 phosphorylation regulates MeCP2 function and show by chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing that this modification occurs on MeCP2 bound across the genome. The phosphorylation of MeCP2 S421 appears not to regulate the expression of specific genes; rather, MeCP2 functions as a histone-like factor whose phosphorylation may facilitate a genome-wide response of chromatin to neuronal activity during nervous system development. We propose that RTT results in part from a loss of this experience-dependent chromatin remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2043772256,"Human colon cancer harbors a small subfraction of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) that is assumed to be a functionally homogeneous stem-cell-like population driving tumor maintenance and metastasis formation. We found unexpected cellular heterogeneity within the TIC compartment, which contains three types of TICs. Extensively self-renewing long-term TICs (LT-TICs) maintained tumor formation in serial xenotransplants. Tumor transient amplifying cells (T-TACs) with limited or no self-renewal capacity contributed to tumor formation only in primary mice. Rare delayed contributing TICs (DC-TICs) were exclusively active in secondary or tertiary mice. Bone marrow was identified as an important reservoir of LT-TICs. Metastasis formation was almost exclusively driven by self-renewing LT-TICs. Our results demonstrate that tumor initiation, self-renewal, and metastasis formation are limited to particular subpopulations of TICs in primary human colon cancer. We identify LT-TICs as a quantifiable target for therapies aimed toward eradication of self-renewing tumorigenic and metastatic colon cancer cells."

Our analysis replicated previously known melanoma susceptibility loci. Seven new regions with at least one SNP with P < 10−5 and further local imputed or genotyped support were selected for replication using two other genome-wide studies (from Australia and Texas, USA). Additional replication came from case-control series from the UK and The Netherlands. Variants at three of the seven loci replicated at P < 10−3: an SNP in ATM (rs1801516, overall P = 3.4 × 10−9), an SNP in MX2 (rs45430, P = 2.9 × 10−9) and an SNP adjacent to CASP8 (rs13016963, P = 8.6 × 10−10).

https://openalex.org/W2078173575,"Fanni Gergely, Geoffrey Woods and colleagues identify a disease-associated CEP63 mutation in a family with primary microcephaly. They further show that CEP63 and CEP152 interact and form a discrete ring around the proximal end of the parental centriole, implicating this complex in the regulation of centrosome number. Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) is characterized by a substantial reduction in prenatal human brain growth without alteration of the cerebral architecture and is caused by biallelic mutations in genes coding for a subset of centrosomal proteins1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Although at least three of these proteins have been implicated in centrosome duplication11, the nature of the centrosome dysfunction that underlies the neurodevelopmental defect in MCPH is unclear. Here we report a homozygous MCPH-causing mutation in human CEP63. CEP63 forms a complex with another MCPH protein, CEP152, a conserved centrosome duplication factor12,13,14,15. Together, these two proteins are essential for maintaining normal centrosome numbers in cells. Using super-resolution microscopy, we found that CEP63 and CEP152 co-localize in a discrete ring around the proximal end of the parental centriole, a pattern specifically disrupted in CEP63-deficient cells derived from patients with MCPH. This work suggests that the CEP152-CEP63 ring-like structure ensures normal neurodevelopment and that its impairment particularly affects human cerebral cortex growth."
https://openalex.org/W2167840036,"In the piriform cortex, individual odorants activate a unique ensemble of neurons that are distributed without discernable spatial order. Piriform neurons receive convergent excitatory inputs from random collections of olfactory bulb glomeruli. Pyramidal cells also make extensive recurrent connections with other excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We introduced channelrhodopsin into the piriform cortex to characterize these intrinsic circuits and to examine their contribution to activity driven by afferent bulbar inputs. We demonstrated that individual pyramidal cells are sparsely interconnected by thousands of excitatory synaptic connections that extend, largely undiminished, across the piriform cortex, forming a large excitatory network that can dominate the bulbar input. Pyramidal cells also activate inhibitory interneurons that mediate strong, local feedback inhibition that scales with excitation. This recurrent network can enhance or suppress bulbar input, depending on whether the input arrives before or after the cortex is activated. This circuitry may shape the ensembles of piriform cells that encode odorant identity."

A conventional approach to understanding the corresponding neural substrates focuses on the basal ganglia and its dopaminergic projections.

Humans played either matching-pennies or rock-paper-scissors games against computerized opponents while being scanned using fMRI. Multivoxel pattern analysis was used to decode previous choices and their outcomes, and to predict upcoming choices. Whereas choices were decodable from a confined set of brain structures, their outcomes were decodable from nearly all cortical and subcortical structures. In addition, signals related to both reinforcements and punishments were recovered reliably in many areas and displayed patterns not consistent with salience-based explanations. Thus, reinforcement and punishment might play global modulatory roles in the entire brain."
https://openalex.org/W2069090018,"A hallmark of polarized cells is the segregation of the PAR polarity regulators into asymmetric domains at the cell cortex. Antagonistic interactions involving two conserved kinases, atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and PAR-1, have been implicated in polarity maintenance, but the mechanisms that initiate the formation of asymmetric PAR domains are not understood. Here, we describe one pathway used by the sperm-donated centrosome to polarize the PAR proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans zygotes. Before polarization, cortical aPKC excludes PAR-1 kinase and its binding partner PAR-2 by phosphorylation. During symmetry breaking, microtubules nucleated by the centrosome locally protect PAR-2 from phosphorylation by aPKC, allowing PAR-2 and PAR-1 to access the cortex nearest the centrosome. Cortical PAR-1 phosphorylates PAR-3, causing the PAR-3-aPKC complex to leave the cortex. Our findings illustrate how microtubules, independently of actin dynamics, stimulate the self-organization of PAR proteins by providing local protection against a global barrier imposed by aPKC."
https://openalex.org/W2102802508,"Complex polysaccharides are generally thought not to have a defined carbohydrate sequence because their synthesis is not template-directed. Detailed mass spectrometry of bikunin now counters this dogma, showing that each molecular weight species consists of only a single sequence. Proteoglycans are complex glycoconjugates that regulate critical biological pathways in all higher organisms. Bikunin, the simplest proteoglycan, with a single glycosaminoglycan chain, is a serine protease inhibitor used to treat acute pancreatitis. Unlike nucleic acids and proteins, whose synthesis is template driven, Golgi-synthesized glycosaminoglycans are not believed to have predictable or deterministic sequences. Bikunin peptidoglycosaminoglycans were prepared and fractionated to obtain a collection of size-similar and charge-similar chains. Fourier transform mass spectral analysis identified a small number of parent molecular ions corresponding to monocompositional peptidoglycosaminoglycans. Fragmentation using collision-induced dissociation unexpectedly afforded a single sequence for each monocompositional parent ion, unequivocally demonstrating the presence of a defined sequence. The biosynthetic pathway common to all proteoglycans suggests that even more structurally complex proteoglycans, such as heparan sulfate, may have defined sequences, requiring a readjustment in the understanding of information storage in complex glycans."
https://openalex.org/W2105705311,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are maintained in hypoxic niches in endosteal regions of bones. Here we demonstrate that Cripto and its receptor GRP78 are important regulators of HSCs in the niche. Flow cytometry analyses revealed two distinct subpopulations of CD34(-)KSL cells based on the expression of GRP78, and these populations showed different reconstitution potential in transplantation assays. GRP78(+)HSCs mainly reside in the endosteal area, are more hypoxic, and exhibit a lower mitochondrial potential, and their HSC capacity was maintained in vitro by Cripto through induction of higher glycolytic activity. Additionally, HIF-1α KO mice have decreased numbers of GRP78(+)HSCs and reduced expression of Cripto in the endosteal niche. Furthermore, blocking GRP78 induced a movement of HSCs from the endosteal to the central marrow area. These data suggest that Cripto/GRP78 signaling is an important pathway that regulates HSC quiescence and maintains HSCs in hypoxia as an intermediary of HIF-1α."

Given that odor objects are routinely experienced within a highly odiferous background (Gottfried, 2010Gottfried J.A. Central mechanisms of odour object perception.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 628-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, Stevenson and Wilson, 2007Stevenson R.J. Wilson D.A. Odour perception: An object-recognition approach.Perception. 2007; 36: 1821-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), it follows that mechanisms to steer selective attention toward an odor of interest, and away from an odor of no interest, would be essential for overcoming sensory noise in the olfactory environment. In an early model of olfactory perception (Freeman, 1981Freeman W.J. A physiological hypothesis of perception.Perspect. Biol. Med. 1981; 24: 561-592PubMed Google Scholar), Walter Freeman postulated that spatiotemporally distributed “search images” in the rabbit olfactory bulb provide an active filter that selectively enhances perceptual sensitivity to expected odors, without impairing responsiveness to unattended odors (Freeman, 1983Freeman W.J. The physiological basis of mental images.Biol. Psychiatry. 1983; 18: 1107-1125PubMed Google Scholar). He concluded that “rabbits smell what they expect, not what they sniff.” More recent electrophysiological recordings in rodents have identified prestimulus anticipatory events not only in the bulb, but also in piriform cortex and orbitofrontal cortex (Kay and Freeman, 1998Kay L.M.

Single-neuron activity in orbitofrontal cortex compared with that in pyriform cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 74: 733-750PubMed Google Scholar), implying that well before an odor arrives, much of the olfactory system generates a prediction about the upcoming stimulus. Finally, in human piriform cortex, attention to olfactory content evokes baseline deviations in fMRI activity (Zelano et al., 2005Zelano C. Bensafi M. Porter J. Mainland J. Johnson B. Bremner E. Telles C. Khan R. Sobel N. Attentional modulation in human primary olfactory cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), although it is unclear whether these changes merely reflect a general attentional gain or reflect feature-based predictive codes about specific odors. Olfactory studies in humans and other animals increasingly show that cortical representations of odor in piriform cortex are encoded as spatially distributed ensembles (Freeman, 1979Freeman W.J.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 1534-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Therefore, on the basis of these observations, we combined an olfactory attentional search task with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques and pattern-based multivariate analyses to test three hypotheses following from the predictive coding model: (1) odor-specific predictive codes in the human olfactory brain are established prior to stimulus onset and take the form of spatially distributed templates or “search images”; (2) ensemble activity patterns should evolve in space and time over the course of a trial, such that predictive coding gives way to stimulus coding from pre- to postodor onset; and (3) a legitimate prestimulus predictive template should be able to predict olfactory behavioral performance in the post-stimulus period. Subjects participated in a simple olfactory fMRI task in which they decided whether a particular predetermined target smell was present on each trial. In target A runs, subjects determined whether odor A was present, and in target B runs, subjects determined whether odor B was present. Stimuli consisted of odor A alone (A), odor B alone (B), or a binary mixture of odors A and B (AB), resulting in six conditions: target A with stimulus A, B, or AB (A|A, A|B, A|AB), and target B with stimulus A, B, or AB (B|A, B|B, B|AB) (Figure 1). Importantly, the physical characteristics of the stimuli were identical across runs, ensuring that the only differing aspect between target A and target B runs was the attentional focus of the subject. By comparing conditions with the “target” held constant, to conditions with the “stimulus” held constant, we were able to look for target-related and stimulus-related activity patterns and observe how those patterns evolved from pre- to poststimulus. Principal regions of interest (ROIs) included anterior piriform cortex (APC), posterior piriform cortex (PPC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and mediodorsal thalamus (MDT), areas that have been previously implicated in human imaging studies of odor quality coding (Gottfried et al., 2006Gottfried J.A.

During a given target run (either A or B), subjects were cued to sniff and to indicate as accurately and quickly as possible whether the odor stimulus (A, B, or AB) contained the target note. Behavioral data were analyzed with a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA, with factors “target” (two levels) and “stimulus” (three levels). There was no main effect of target on performance accuracy: subjects identified the target equally well on both A and B runs (F1,11 = 0.54; p = 0.478) (Figure 2A ). In contrast, a significant main effect of odor stimulus was observed (F1.83,20.11 = 10.08; p = 0.001), whereby subjects were less accurate on stimulus AB trials than on stimulus A and B trials (A versus AB: T11 = 4.39, p = 0.001; B versus AB: T11 = 3.96, p < 0.002). Interestingly, although mean accuracy was comparable for A and B odor stimuli (T11 = 0.46, p = 0.6), there was a significant stimulus-by-target interaction (F1.88,20.67 = 8.951; p = 0.002), such that accuracy on target A runs was higher (at trend) for stimulus A than for stimulus B (T11 = 2.0, p < 0.07), and accuracy on target B runs was higher for stimulus B than for stimulus A (T11 = 4.0, p < 0.002) (Figure 2A). In other words, subjects made fewer errors on congruent trials in which the target was present in the stimulus (i.e., A|A and B|B), compared to incongruent trials in which the target was not present (i.e., A|B and B|A). This effect is summarized in Figure 2B (congruent versus incongruent: T11 = 3.35, p < 0.006). Moreover, reaction times were significantly faster on congruent trials when the target note was present in the stimulus compared to incongruent trials when it was not (T11 = 3.01, p < 0.01) (Figure 2C), highlighting the effect of our attentional manipulation on behavior. Although several studies have found evidence for a general effect of attending to olfactory versus nonolfactory sensory modalities (Plailly et al., 2008Plailly J. Howard J.D. Gitelman D.R.

Neurosci. 2005; 8: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), our results imply that selective attention within the olfactory modality also exists, which has been previously debated (Laing and Glemarec, 1992Laing D.G. Glemarec A. Selective attention and the perceptual analysis of odor mixtures.Physiol. Behav. 1992; 52: 1047-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, Takiguchi et al., 2008Takiguchi N. Okuhara K. Kuroda A. Kato J. Ohtake H. Performance of mice in discrimination of liquor odors: Behavioral evidence for olfactory attention.Chem. Senses. 2008; 33: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Because of the known influence of sniffing on olfactory activation patterns in humans (Mainland and Sobel, 2006Mainland J. Sobel N. The sniff is part of the olfactory percept.Chem. Senses. 2006; 31: 181-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), we also examined condition-specific respiratory patterns across subjects and confirmed that there was no effect of attended target (F1,11 = 1.007, p = 0.159), odor stimulus (F1,11.01 = 0.73, p = 0.411), or target-by-stimulus interaction (F1,11 = 0.914, p = 0.36) on inspiratory sniff volume (data not shown). Thus, the only salient cognitive difference between target A and target B runs was the attentional focus of the subject. We first examined whether odor-specific ensemble patterns were formed prior to the arrival of the stimulus. The central hypothesis was that prior to odor onset, spatial activity patterns would be more correlated between same-target conditions than between different-target conditions in brain regions encoding the odor target. Thus for example, if a given ROI reflected the targeted note, the prestimulus pattern in response to condition A|A would correlate more strongly to A|B (same target but different stimulus) than to B|A (different target but same stimulus). Conversely, in a region encoding the actual odor stimulus, the pattern in response to condition A|A would correlate more strongly to B|A (same stimulus but different target) than to A|B (different stimulus but same target). In this manner, one could test a distinct contrast (same target/different stimulus correlations versus same stimulus/different target correlations) to look for both target-related and stimulus-related effects, both before and after odor onset (Figure 3A ). These analyses were computed for target A runs and for target B runs in the pre-and poststimulus time bins and entered into a three-way repeated-measures ANOVA with the factors “target run” (A or B), “pattern type” (target-related or stimulus-related pattern), and “time” (pre- or poststimulus onset). Because no region exhibited a significant effect of target run (all p's > 0.2), data are shown collapsed across A and B runs (for non-collapsed data, see Figure S1). In line with the idea that prestimulus, odor-specific patterns exist in the olfactory system, fMRI ensemble correlations between same-target conditions were significantly higher than correlations between different-target conditions (Figure 3B). In APC and OFC, there was a significant effect of pattern type (APC: F1,11 = 30.933, p < 0.0001; OFC: F1,11 = 13.437, p < 0.004) in the target direction, whereby same-target conditions were more correlated than different-target conditions (APC: T11 = 5.6, p < 0.0001; OFC: T11 = 3.67, p < 0.003). In APC, there was also a significant pattern type-by-time interaction (F1,11 = 5.79, p < 0.035) in which the same-target (compared to different-target) correlations were larger in the prestimulus bin than in the poststimulus bin (pre: T11 = 6.3, p < 0.0001; post: T11 = 1.99, p < 0.07). There was no such interaction in OFC (p = 0.3). Neither MDT nor PPC exhibited a significant main effect of pattern type or time (p's > 0.1). Although PPC exhibited no main effect of pattern type (either in the target direction or the stimulus direction), there was a significant pattern type-by-time interaction (F1,11 = 22.702, p < 0.001). Follow-up t tests revealed a double dissociation, such that same-target conditions were more correlated than different-target conditions before stimulus onset (T11 = 2.6, p < 0.02), but same-stimulus conditions were more correlated than different-stimulus conditions after stimulus onset (T11 = −5.45, p < 0.001) (Figure 3B). To directly visualize how the informational content of the fMRI signal changes over time and across different regions, we plotted the mean correlations between same-target conditions (e.g., A|A to A|B) and between same-stimulus conditions (e.g., A|A to B|A) separately for each time point in the trial (Figure 4). Within APC and OFC, target-specific patterns emerged early in the prestimulus period, and in the case of APC, this effect significantly persisted for several seconds into the poststimulus period. In contrast, target-specific patterns in PPC were identified prior to odor onset, but these gave way to stimulus-specific patterns later in the trial. Although the above data provide robust evidence for olfactory predictive patterns, direct confirmation that these codes are perceptual templates or “search images” of the actual odor requires that the search pattern for a given odor (prior to stimulus onset) correlates with the actual evoked pattern for that odor (following stimulus onset). To test this idea, we hypothesized that if the observed search pattern did in fact resemble the actual pattern in response to that specific odor, then the prestimulus and poststimulus activity patterns in PPC would be more correlated in trials in which the stimulus matched the target than when the stimulus did not match the target. In agreement with this hypothesis, we found higher correlations between pre- and poststimulus patterns in PPC for target/stimulus matching (versus nonmatching) trials (Figure 5) (T11 = 1.8, p < 0.04; binomial test, p < 0.003). Thus the prestimulus pattern observed in PPC does in fact appear to be quite literally an odor template, that is, a stimulus-specific perceptual signature of the anticipated odor in the absence of any stimulus. We next reasoned that if prestimulus odor templates exist, they should help augment olfactory perception. To this end, we regressed the strength of template formation (as indexed by the magnitude of the pre-odor correlation between same-target conditions) against performance accuracy on the olfactory search task, on a subject-wise basis. Put differently, we tested the hypothesis that subjects who generated more robust odor-target templates would be able to identify the target odor more accurately. In agreement with this prediction, the magnitude of the prestimulus effect in PPC was significantly correlated with task accuracy (Figure 6) (R = 0.64, p = 0.02). Furthermore, the degree to which same-target correlations exceeded different-target correlations also correlated with task accuracy (R = 0.66, p = 0.01). By comparison, prestimulus ensemble patterns in APC and OFC had no demonstrable relationship to behavior (p's > 0.07), indicating that the availability of predictive codes for guiding olfactory perceptual decisions specifically resides in PPC. Recent theoretical models of sensory perception (Friston, 2005bFriston K.J. Models of brain function in neuroimaging.Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2005; 56: 57-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, Rao and Ballard, 1999Rao R.P. Ballard D.H. Predictive coding in the visual cortex: A functional interpretation of some extra-classical receptive-field effects.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (2411) Google Scholar) place high importance on hierarchical processing and prediction error: predictions reflect the top-down flow in the cortical hierarchy while prediction error reflects the bottom-up flow of afferent sensory information. Interestingly, findings from univariate fMRI analyses commonly show that an expected (versus unexpected) percept elicits lower mean activity in sensory-related regions, a differential effect that has been attributed to prediction error signaling (Summerfield and Egner, 2009Summerfield C. Egner T. Expectation (and attention) in visual cognition.Trends Cogn. Sci. (Regul. Ed.). 2009; 13: 403-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conducted a complementary univariate imaging analysis to look for evidence of error signaling in our data (Figure 7). fMRI activation in MDT was significantly reduced in response to expected trials compared to unexpected trials (T11 = 2.41, p < 0.03), suggesting this region may participate in generating a prediction error signal. By comparison, there were no significant differences in APC, PPC, or OFC (p's > 0.2). The vast majority of natural, real-world odors are encountered in the presence of other competing smells. Thus, on any given inhalation, the olfactory system faces the challenge of disambiguating salient odor objects from other odors present in the background (Linster et al., 2007Linster C. Henry L. Kadohisa M. Wilson D.A. Synaptic adaptation and odor-background segmentation.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2007; 87: 352-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). On top of this challenge, human olfactory perception is both temporally and spatially impoverished (Sela and Sobel, 2010Sela L. Sobel N. Human olfaction: A constant state of change-blindness.Exp. Brain Res. 2010; 205: 13-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), implying that attentional capture may be insoluble for the olfactory system (Laing and Glemarec, 1992Laing D.G. Glemarec A.

In this discovery phase, we confirm several previously characterized melanoma-associated loci at MC1R, ASIP and MTAP–CDKN2A. We selected variants at nine loci for replication in three independent case-control studies (Europe: 2,804 subjects with melanoma, 7,618 control subjects; United States 1: 1,804 subjects with melanoma, 1,026 control subjects; United States 2: 585 subjects with melanoma, 6,500 control subjects).

We also show evidence suggesting that melanoma associates with 1q42.12 (rs3219090, P = 9.3 × 10−8). The associated variants at the 1q21.3 locus span a region with ten genes, and plausible candidate genes for melanoma susceptibility include ARNT and SETDB1. Variants at the 1q21.3 locus do not seem to be associated with human pigmentation or measures of nevus density."

We demonstrate that IgH locus conformation involves two levels of chromosomal compaction. At the first level, the locus folds into several multilooped domains. One such domain at the 3' end of the locus requires an enhancer, Eμ; two other domains at the 5' end are Eμ independent. At the second level, these domains are brought into spatial proximity by Eμ-dependent interactions with specific sites within the V(H) region. Eμ is also required for radial repositioning of IgH alleles, indicating its essential role in large-scale chromosomal movements in developing lymphocytes. Our observations provide a comprehensive view of the conformation of IgH alleles in pro-B cells and the mechanisms by which it is established."

Failure to eliminate these polypeptides is associated with numerous aggregation diseases. Several protein quality control mechanisms degrade non-native proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Here, we use quantitative mass spectrometry to demonstrate that heat-shock triggers a large increase in the level of ubiquitylation associated with misfolding of cytosolic proteins. We discover that the Hul5 HECT ubiquitin ligase participates in this heat-shock stress response. Hul5 is required to maintain cell fitness after heat-shock and to degrade short-lived misfolded proteins. In addition, localization of Hul5 in the cytoplasm is important for its quality control function. We identify potential Hul5 substrates in heat-shock and physiological conditions to reveal that Hul5 is required for ubiquitylation of low-solubility cytosolic proteins including the Pin3 prion-like protein. These findings indicate that Hul5 is involved in a cytosolic protein quality control pathway that targets misfolded proteins for degradation."

The genetically modified Bt toxins Cry1AbMod and Cry1AcMod were designed to counter insect resistance to native Bt toxins Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac. Previous results suggested that the modified toxins would be effective only if resistance was linked with mutations in genes encoding toxin-binding cadherin proteins. Here we report evidence from five major crop pests refuting this hypothesis. Relative to native toxins, the potency of modified toxins was >350-fold higher against resistant strains of Plutella xylostella and Ostrinia nubilalis in which resistance was not linked with cadherin mutations. Conversely, the modified toxins provided little or no advantage against some resistant strains of three other pests with altered cadherin. Independent of the presence of cadherin mutations, the relative potency of the modified toxins was generally higher against the most resistant strains."
https://openalex.org/W2029725340,"In primary sensory cortices, there are two main sources of excitation: afferent sensory input relayed from the periphery and recurrent intracortical input. Untangling the functional roles of these two excitatory pathways is fundamental for understanding how cortical neurons process sensory stimuli. Odor representations in the primary olfactory (piriform) cortex depend on excitatory sensory afferents from the olfactory bulb. However, piriform cortex pyramidal cells also receive dense intracortical excitatory connections, and the relative contribution of these two pathways to odor responses is unclear. Using a combination of in vivo whole-cell voltage-clamp recording and selective synaptic silencing, we show that the recruitment of intracortical input, rather than olfactory bulb input, largely determines the strength of odor-evoked excitatory synaptic transmission in rat piriform cortical neurons. Furthermore, we find that intracortical synapses dominate odor-evoked excitatory transmission in broadly tuned neurons, whereas bulbar synapses dominate excitatory synaptic responses in more narrowly tuned neurons.

M/T cell axons project via the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) to the piriform cortex, a three-layered cortical region where bulbar inputs are integrated to form odor percepts (Haberly, 2001Haberly L.B.

The mechanisms governing this transformation from a spatially segregated representation in the olfactory bulb to one that is highly distributed and nonstereotyped in the cortex are not well understood.

Although it is tempting to account for cortical odor responses entirely by the convergence and divergence of direct olfactory bulb inputs, the dendrites of the piriform cortex pyramidal cells also receive extensive intracortical associational (ASSN) connections from excitatory neurons within the piriform cortex and other cortical regions (Haberly, 2001Haberly L.B.

New features of connectivity in piriform cortex visualized by intracellular injection of pyramidal cells suggest that “primary” olfactory cortex functions like “association” cortex in other sensory systems.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6974-6982PubMed Google Scholar). Although much effort has focused on elucidating how olfactory bulb afferent sensory inputs shape cortical odor representations, the contribution of intracortical excitatory circuits to odor responses has been largely unexplored. In this study, we examine the relative contributions of sensory afferent input and intracortical connections to odor-driven excitatory synaptic transmission in the anterior piriform cortex (APC). We take advantage of the differential expression of presynaptic GABAB receptors in APC to selectively silence intracortical synapses while leaving afferent sensory fibers unaffected. We show that intracortical connections in APC underlie the strength of odor-evoked excitatory synaptic transmission and expand the range of odors over which pyramidal cells can respond. Our results indicate that intracortical ASSN circuits make a major contribution to odor-evoked excitation, suggesting that odor representations in the piriform cortex cannot simply be accounted for by the convergence and divergence of M/T cell inputs. GABAB receptors are expressed on nerve terminals, and activation of presynaptic GABAB receptors causes a potent inhibition of neurotransmitter release from both pyramidal cells and local interneurons throughout the cortex (Bowery, 1993Bowery N.G. GABAB receptor pharmacology.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1993; 33: 109-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). However, brain slice studies have shown that although the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen abolishes ASSN-evoked excitatory transmission in APC, LOT-evoked excitatory responses are completely unaffected (Franks and Isaacson, 2005Franks K.M.

Hasselmo M.E. Selective suppression of intrinsic but not afferent fiber synaptic transmission by baclofen in the piriform (olfactory) cortex.Brain Res. 1994; 659: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The absence of functional GABAB receptors on M/T cell nerve terminals suggests that baclofen could be a useful pharmacological tool to selectively silence intracortical excitatory synaptic input in vivo. In addition, local cortical application of baclofen should directly hyperpolarize APC pyramidal cells via postsynaptic GABAB receptors that are coupled to K+ channels and should further reduce the likelihood of recurrent excitation (Bowery, 1993Bowery N.G. GABAB receptor pharmacology.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1993; 33: 109-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, Doi et al., 1990Doi N. Carpenter D.O. Hori N.

We therefore examined whether local cortical application of baclofen could be used to selectively silence intracortical excitation in vivo. We recorded field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in layer 1 of APC that were alternately evoked via stimulating electrodes placed in the LOT (afferent sensory pathway) and layer 2/3 (ASSN pathway; Figure 1A1). Consistent with previous studies distinguishing the two pathways (Bower and Haberly, 1986Bower J.M. Haberly L.B.

Isaacson J.S. An early critical period for long-term plasticity and structural modification of sensory synapses in olfactory cortex.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7553-7558Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), responses to paired-pulse stimulation (50 ms interval) were strongly facilitating for the LOT pathway (paired-pulse ratio [PPR] = 1.72 ± 0.18), but not the ASSN pathway (Figure 1A2; PPR = 0.94 ± 0.07). In vivo cortical baclofen application (500 μM) rapidly abolished fEPSPs evoked by electrical stimulation of ASSN inputs (ASSN fEPSP slope 10 min post-baclofen 5% ± 10% of control; t test p < 0.01), whereas simultaneously recorded fEPSPs evoked by LOT stimulation were unaffected (Figures 1A2 and 1A3; LOT fEPSP slope 111% ± 14%; t test p = 0.48; n = 4 rats). Thus, activation of GABAB receptors in vivo selectively blocks intracortical excitatory synaptic transmission in APC. We next studied the effects of baclofen in vivo using whole-cell voltage-clamp recording from layer 2/3 pyramidal cells (Poo and Isaacson, 2009Poo C. Isaacson J.S. Odor representations in olfactory cortex: “sparse” coding, global inhibition, and oscillations.Neuron. 2009; 62: 850-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). A cesium-based internal solution (5 mM Cl−) was used to block K+ channels and thus any direct action of baclofen in the recorded cell. A strong single pulse of LOT stimulation evoked short-latency, monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs; Vm = −80 mV) and long-latency, polysynaptic EPSCs, reflecting the recruitment of intracortical excitation onto L2/3 pyramidal cells (Figure 1B2). Interleaved trials at the reversal potential for EPSCs (Vm = +10 mV) revealed LOT-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs; Figure 1B2) that arise from local feedforward and feedback inhibitory circuits (Stokes and Isaacson, 2010Stokes C.C. Isaacson J.S. From dendrite to soma: dynamic routing of inhibition by complementary interneuron microcircuits in olfactory cortex.Neuron. 2010; 67: 452-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Baclofen abolished both polysynaptic EPSCs and IPSCs (Figure 1B2), consistent with the expression of presynaptic GABAB receptors on intracortical excitatory and inhibitory synapses (Bowery, 1993Bowery N.G. GABAB receptor pharmacology.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1993; 33: 109-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). However, monosynaptic LOT-evoked EPSCs simultaneously recorded onto the same cell were unaffected (Figures 1B2 and 1B3; n = 3 cells). Taken together, our experiments show that baclofen can be used in vivo to distinguish LOT- versus ASSN-mediated excitatory input onto an individual APC neuron, whereas the suppression of all IPSCs reports the effectiveness of baclofen at our recording site. We next sought to determine the relative contribution of direct sensory and intracortical inputs to odor-evoked excitation in APC. To address this question, we used in vivo voltage-clamp recording to measure synaptic responses to a panel of eight structurally diverse monomolecular odorants in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons (Figures 1C1–1C5; Experimental Procedures; Poo and Isaacson, 2009Poo C. Isaacson J.S. Odor representations in olfactory cortex: “sparse” coding, global inhibition, and oscillations.Neuron. 2009; 62: 850-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). All cells included in this study were filled with biocytin for post hoc histological processing and were identified to be pyramidal in morphology (i.e., somata within deep layer 2 or layer 3, spiny apical dendrites extending to layer 1a, basal dendrites branching within layer 3; Suzuki and Bekkers, 2006Suzuki N. Bekkers J.M. Neural coding by two classes of principal cells in the mouse piriform cortex.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11938-11947Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For each cell, we alternately monitored odor-evoked EPSCs and IPSCs before and after local cortical superfusion of baclofen (500 μM), and each odor-evoked response in a cell was considered an “odor-cell pair.” Cortical baclofen application strongly blocked odor-evoked IPSCs (Figures 1C2 and 1C3; mean fraction IPSC charge blocked = 0.93 ± 0.002; n = 27 odor-cell pairs), indicating the effectiveness of the drug at our recording site. On average, baclofen also suppressed odor-evoked EPSCs (Figures 1C2 and 1C3; mean fraction blocked = 0.49 ± 0.01). However, in contrast to the uniform suppression of odor-evoked IPSCs across all odor-cell pairs, baclofen had variable actions on odor-evoked excitation. For some odor-cell pairs, almost all excitation was blocked by baclofen, whereas for others excitation was largely unaffected (Figure 1C3). From these results, we conclude that, although the relative contribution of ASSN and LOT inputs could vary widely, both pathways participate in odor-evoked excitation. Furthermore, subsequent application of the GABAB receptor antagonist CGP55845 (CGP, 10 μM) to a subset of cells reversed the suppression of both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents, indicating the selective action of baclofen (Figures 1C4 and 1C5: n = 8 odor-cell pairs; n = 3 cells). We quantified the intracortical ASSN contribution to odor-evoked EPSCs as the fraction of charge blocked by baclofen, while the fraction of charge remaining reflects the contribution of LOT inputs. Across all odor-cell pairs, we found that the strength of odor-evoked EPSCs was strongly correlated with the contribution of ASSN input (baclofen-sensitive EPSC; Figures 2A1 and 2A2). In other words, the most strongly driven responses were those reflecting the greatest amount of intracortical input, in terms of both absolute strength (Figure 2A1) and the fractional contribution to total excitation (Figure 2A2). In contrast, there was no significant correlation between the strength of odor-evoked EPSCs and the contribution of LOT sensory afferent input (Figure 2B). This lack of correlation between strength of LOT input and total excitation highlights the fact that odor-evoked responses of APC neurons do not simply reflect activity from converging M/T cell inputs. Specifically, our results indicate that intracortical rather than sensory afferent synapses underlie the most strongly driven odor-evoked synaptic excitation in APC. In the sensory neocortex, intracortical and thalamocortical inputs onto individual neurons have been found to have similar preferences for sensory stimuli (Chung and Ferster, 1998Chung S. Ferster D. Strength and orientation tuning of the thalamic input to simple cells revealed by electrically evoked cortical suppression.Neuron. 1998; 20: 1177-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, Liu et al., 2007Liu B.H. Wu G.K. Arbuckle R. Tao H.W. Zhang L.I. Defining cortical frequency tuning with recurrent excitatory circuitry.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This implies that cortical circuitry, in which neurons receiving thalamocortical inputs with similar stimulus preferences excite each other, ultimately allows intracortical inputs to selectively amplify thalamocortical signals (Liu et al., 2007Liu B.H. Wu G.K. Arbuckle R. Tao H.W. Zhang L.I. Defining cortical frequency tuning with recurrent excitatory circuitry.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We next considered whether there was evidence for this “cotuning” in APC based on the relationship between odor-evoked LOT- and ASSN-mediated excitation in individual cells. If intracortical circuits in APC selectively amplify afferent sensory input, the strength of ASSN-mediated excitation should be greatest for odor-cell pairs that receive the largest amount of LOT-mediated excitation. However, within individual cells responsive to multiple odors, the strength of LOT sensory input did not correlate with intracortical ASSN excitation (Figure 2C; n = 4 cells responsive to ≥4 out of 8 odors; Pearson's correlation p > 0.1). This lack of correlation held true when the strengths of ASSN and LOT inputs were rank ordered within each cell (Spearman's correlation p > 0.05). Thus, for individual cells, the relative contribution of ASSN and LOT inputs to responses to different odors varied widely. Similarly, there was no obvious relationship between the strength of ASSN and LOT input for responses to particular odorants across cells (see Figure S1 available online). Taken together, these results suggest that, unlike thalamorecipient neurons in the neocortex, intracortical excitation in APC does not arise from cotuned subcircuits of cortical neurons driven by common sensory input. How do intracortical and direct sensory inputs shape the excitatory responses of an individual APC pyramidal cell to different odors? In other words, how do intracortical and direct sensory inputs contribute to the “tuning” of excitatory responses (EPSC tuning)? Odor-evoked excitation onto most pyramidal cells is relatively selective (responses to one or two out of eight test odors), but some neurons are broadly tuned to multiple odors (Poo and Isaacson, 2009Poo C. Isaacson J.S. Odor representations in olfactory cortex: “sparse” coding, global inhibition, and oscillations.Neuron. 2009; 62: 850-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, Zhan and Luo, 2010Zhan C. Luo M. Diverse patterns of odor representation by neurons in the anterior piriform cortex of awake mice.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 16662-16672Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). EPSC tuning was determined by categorizing excitation as “responsive” versus “nonresponsive” (Poo and Isaacson, 2009Poo C. Isaacson J.S. Odor representations in olfactory cortex: “sparse” coding, global inhibition, and oscillations.Neuron. 2009; 62: 850-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), as measured from the increase in charge transfer during odor presentation (see Experimental Procedures). We observed marked differences in the actions of baclofen on odor-evoked excitation that was related to the EPSC tuning of individual cells. In pyramidal cells that were selectively excited, odor-evoked EPSCs were only moderately suppressed in the presence of baclofen (Figures 3A1 and 3A2). In contrast, odor-evoked EPSCs were strongly blocked in cells that responded broadly to multiple odors (Figures 3B1 and 3B2). Reconstruction of the pyramidal cells receiving selective or broadly tuned excitation revealed similar anatomical features, such as somatic location and dendritic arborization (Figures 3A1 and 3B1). Odor-evoked inhibition is broadly tuned in APC pyramidal cells, irrespective of the tuning of excitation in the same cells (Poo and Isaacson, 2009Poo C. Isaacson J.S. Odor representations in olfactory cortex: “sparse” coding, global inhibition, and oscillations.Neuron. 2009; 62: 850-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Baclofen uniformly abolished odor-evoked IPSCs in cells that received either selective or broadly tuned excitation (Figures 3A2 and 3B2), ruling out the possibility that its different actions on excitation reflected differences in access of the drug to the local circuit. These results suggest that intracortical inputs might dominate odor-evoked excitation in broadly tuned neurons yet contribute relatively weakly to excitation in selectively responsive cells. We further quantified the relationship between EPSC tuning observed under control conditions and the contribution of ASSN and LOT input assessed following baclofen application. Cells tested with baclofen (n = 7) encompassed a wide range of EPSC tuning properties, from selective (responses to 1/8 tested odors, i.e., Figure 3A2) to broad (responses to 7/8 odors, i.e., Figure 3B2). We found that the strength and fractional contribution of baclofen-sensitive intracortical excitation for each odor response was positively correlated with the EPSC tuning properties of the cell (Figures 4A1 and 4A2). This suggests that broadly tuned cells received greater amounts of ASSN-mediated excitation than selective cells. In contrast, both selective and broadly tuned cells received similar amounts of excitation from LOT afferents (Figure 4B). Averaging the ASSN and LOT components across odor-evoked responses within each cell yielded similar results (data not shown). Furthermore, broadly tuned neurons received greater amounts of total excitatory synaptic input (Figure 4C), consistent with the fact that the strength of odor-evoked excitatory responses is correlated with ASSN input (i.e., Figure 2A1). Comparing the responsiveness of the cell population to odors before and after baclofen application revealed the importance of ASSN inputs to EPSC tuning. In cells responding to multiple odors, baclofen reduced the number of odors eliciting excitation (Figure 4D), indicating an increase in odor selectivity. We also determined the effect of baclofen on selectivity using lifetime sparseness (SL, ranging from 0 = nonselective to 1 = highly selective), a measure of how an individual cell responds to multiple stimuli that does not rely on binary categorization of responses (Willmore and Tolhurst, 2001Willmore B. Tolhurst D.J. Characterizing the sparseness of neural codes.Network. 2001; 12: 255-270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Across the cell population, this analysis of EPSC charge also revealed that silencing ASSN inputs caused a significant increase in odor selectivity (control SL = 0.33 ± 0.16, baclofen SL = 0.59 ± 0.16, p = 0.02). Thus, the net effect of removing intracortical inputs is to make broadly tuned pyramidal cells more selective. In this study, we used in vivo whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings to show that intracortical excitatory inputs play an important role in shaping odor-evoked synaptic excitation in the piriform cortex. We took advantage of the distinct properties of synaptic circuits in the olfactory cortex and selectively silenced intracortical synapses via GABAB receptor activation. We found that strongly driven odor-evoked excitatory synaptic responses largely reflect the contribution of intracortical ASSN inputs. Furthermore, the relative contribution of direct sensory LOT input and intracortical input to odor-evoked excitation varies with the tuning properties of individual pyramidal cells. Specifically, broadly tuned cells receive stronger intracortical excitation, whereas cells that respond selectively to odors receive mainly afferent sensory input. LOT afferent fibers target the distal portion of pyramidal cell apical dendrites in layer 1a, whereas associational synapses contact more proximal apical dendrites in layer 1b, as well as basal dendrites of pyramidal cells in layers 2/3 (Neville and Haberly, 2004). How valid are our somatic recordings of EPSC charge for determining the relative impact of LOT and ASSN inputs to pyramidal cell excitability? LOT-mediated EPSCs might be more heavily attenuated than proximal ASSN EPSCs at our somatic recording location due to dendritic filtering. However, the dendrites of piriform cortex pyramidal cells are relatively electrotonically compact, with only a 50% maximal somatic current loss for synaptic inputs arriving at the most distal dendritic regions (Bathellier et al., 2009Bathellier B. Margrie T.W. Larkum M.E. Properties of piriform cortex pyramidal cell dendrites: implications for olfactory circuit design.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 12641-12652Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, piriform pyramidal cell dendrites are only weakly active, and spike output has been shown to reflect the nearly linear summation of synaptic inputs at the soma of these cells (Bathellier et al., 2009Bathellier B. Margrie T.W. Larkum M.E. Properties of piriform cortex pyramidal cell dendrites: implications for olfactory circuit design.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 12641-12652Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest that our somatic charge measurements are a good indicator of the excitation that triggers spike output of piriform pyramidal cells. Recent studies have shown how the convergence and integration of M/T cell inputs from different glomeruli onto piriform cortical neurons can shape odor representations in the piriform cortex (Apicella et al., 2010Apicella A. Yuan Q. Scanziani M. Isaacson J.S. Pyramidal cells in piriform cortex receive convergent input from distinct olfactory bulb glomeruli.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 14255-14260Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, Davison and Ehlers, 2011Davison I.G.

He Z. et al.Cortical representations of olfactory input by trans-synaptic tracing.Nature. 2011; 472: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). However, in addition to olfactory bulb afferent input patterns, excitatory intracortical input has also been suggested to shape response properties of piriform cortical neurons. Indeed, experiments in APC slices revealed extensive long-range recurrent connections and suggest that individual pyramidal cells receive far larger numbers of recurrent inputs than afferent inputs (Franks et al., 2011Franks K.M. Russo M.J. Sosulski D.L. Mulligan A.A. Siegelbaum S.A. Axel A. Recurrent circuitry dynamically shapes the activation of piriform cortex.Neuron. 2011; 72 (this issue): 49-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar [this issue of Neuron]). Furthermore, in vivo intracellular recordings from APC neurons found that excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) could be evoked in cells by costimulation of multiple glomeruli, even when activation of the individual glomeruli alone did not produce detectable EPSPs (Davison and Ehlers, 2011Davison I.G. Ehlers M.D. Neural circuit mechanisms for pattern detection and feature combination in olfactory cortex.Neuron. 2011; 70: 82-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This supralinear recruitment of excitation implies an indirect source of synaptic input consistent with intracortical circuits. Our results provide evidence for an extensive functional contribution of intracortical excitatory inputs to odor-evoked excitation in the piriform cortex. Similarly, intracellular recordings from thalamorecipient neurons in the primary visual and auditory cortex have shown that intracortical inputs can underlie a substantial component of sensory-evoked excitation (Chung and Ferster, 1998Chung S. Ferster D. Strength and orientation tuning of the thalamic input to simple cells revealed by electrically evoked cortical suppression.Neuron. 1998; 20: 1177-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, Liu et al., 2007Liu B.H. Wu G.K. Arbuckle R. Tao H.W. Zhang L.I. Defining cortical frequency tuning with recurrent excitatory circuitry.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, unlike neurons in the sensory neocortex (Liu et al., 2007Liu B.H. Wu G.K. Arbuckle R. Tao H.W. Zhang L.I. Defining cortical frequency tuning with recurrent excitatory circuitry.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we found that the strength of intracortical excitation was not related to the amount of afferent sensory input recruited by the same stimulus in individual cells. Thus, strong intracortical excitation could be produced in APC neurons by stimuli that evoked only very weak direct sensory input. This apparent lack of cotuning suggests that intracortical circuits in APC have a different organization than those that selectively amplify thalamocortical inputs in the neocortex. We also found that the contribution of intracortical connections and sensory inputs to excitation differed based on the tuning properties of individual cells. Recent slice studies have suggested that layer 2 principal APC cells fall into two classes in terms of their excitatory inputs: semilunar cells in layer 2a that lack basal dendrites and are proposed to receive strong LOT input and weak ASSN input and pyramidal cells in layer 2b that receive weaker LOT input but strong ASSN input (Suzuki and Bekkers, 2006Suzuki N. Bekkers J.M. Neural coding by two classes of principal cells in the mouse piriform cortex.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11938-11947Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, Suzuki and Bekkers, 2011Suzuki N. Bekkers J.M. Two layers of synaptic processing by principal neurons in piriform cortex.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 2156-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Semilunar and pyramidal cells might thus differentially process afferent and associational inputs and possess different tuning properties (selective and broad, respectively). One possibility is that the differences we find for the contribution of intracortical inputs to odor responses reflect these two cell classes. However, none of the cells we recorded were located in superficial layer 2a, and all had basal dendrites, suggesting that all of the cells we studied were layer 2/3 pyramidal cells. Furthermore, a recent in vivo extracellular recording study also found that the response properties of identified layer 2/3 pyramidal cells could be classified as selective or broadly tuned for a large panel of odors (Zhan and Luo, 2010Zhan C. Luo M. Diverse patterns of odor representation by neurons in the anterior piriform cortex of awake mice.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 16662-16672Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In summary, we provide direct evidence for a significant role of intracortical inputs to odor-evoked excitation in the olfactory cortex. Our results illustrate that intracortical connections in APC expand the range of odors over which pyramidal cells can respond and that odor tuning does not simply reflect varying degrees of M/T cell convergence onto individual cells. Intracortical connections are likely to underlie the distributed and dynamic nature of cortical odor representations and are poised to play a role in associative processes such as pattern completion and olfactory learning (Barnes et al., 2008Barnes D.C.

All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health and the University of California Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Sprague Dawley rats (16–21 days old) were anesthetized with urethane (1.5 g/kg) and maintained at 35°C–37°C. A small (∼1 mm2) craniotomy was made lateral to the rhinal sulcus and dorsal to the top edge of the LOT to expose the APC, and the cortical surface was constantly superfused with warmed (34°C) artificial cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF) containing 119 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.3 mM MgSO4, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 26.2 mM NaHCO3, and 22 mM glucose, equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Odors (cineole, amyl acetate, (R)-limonene, phenylethyl alcohol, eugenol, dimethyl pyrzadine, citral, and ethyl butyrate) were delivered at a concentration of 5% saturated vapor via a computer-controlled olfactometer in pseudorandomized order for 2 s, with 60 s between presentations of odors. In vivo whole-cell recordings were made using pipettes (5–7 MΩ) containing 130 mM cesium gluconate, 5 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 0.2 mM EGTA, 12 mM phosphocreatine, 3 mM Mg-ATP, 0.2 mM Na-GTP, and biocytin (0.2% mM). EPSCs were recorded at −80 mV, the reversal potential (Erev) for inhibition set by our internal solution. Similarly, IPSCs were recorded at Erev for excitation (∼+10 mV). We determined the adequacy of voltage-clamp recordings by ensuring that inward EPSCs recorded at −80 mV were abolished at a holding potential of +10 mV (cf. LOT-evoked monosynaptic EPSC in Figures 1B1–1B3). This was consistently achieved when series resistance (Rs) was ≤30 MΩ. Rs was continuously monitored during each recording to rule out the possibility that changes in synaptic responses reflected gradual increases in Rs. Cells in which Rs changed by >15% were excluded (Rs control: 24.3 ± 2.3 MΩ; Rs baclofen: 26.0 ± 3.2 MΩ; paired t test, p = 0.09; n = 7). Furthermore, there was no correlation between Rs and EPSC tuning (r = 0, p = 0.98) or strength of odor-evoked synaptic excitation (r = 0.2, p = 0.6). fEPSPs were recorded with an aCSF-filled pipette (1 MΩ) placed ∼100 μm below the pial surface. Recordings were made with a MultiClamp 700A (Molecular Devices) and AxoGraph X. Data were analyzed using custom routines in MATLAB (Mathworks). Cells were analyzed only if >4 odor presentation trials for control and drug conditions were obtained. Odor-evoked synaptic activity was aligned to the onset of the first inspiration in the presence of odor and was quantified by calculating charge transfer (QOdor) during the 2 s odor period. Baseline response (QBaseline) was calculated from a 2 s period preceding odor onset. The criteria for a “positive” odor-evoked synaptic response was defined as response index = (QOdor/QBaseline) ≥ 1.6. This threshold was derived from receiver-operating characteristic analysis to obtain the optimal threshold that produced a true-positive to false-positive ratio of >90% (Poo and Isaacson, 2009Poo C. Isaacson J.S. Odor representations in olfactory cortex: “sparse” coding, global inhibition, and oscillations.Neuron. 2009; 62: 850-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Lifetime sparseness (SL), which is independent of detection threshold, was calculated as (1 – {[SNj rj/N]2/{SNj [rj2/N]})/(1 – 1/N), where rj was the response of the neuron to odorant j (charge transfer) and N was the total number of odors (Willmore and Tolhurst, 2001Willmore B.

One Figure Recurrent Circuitry Dynamically Shapes the Activation of Piriform CortexFranks et al.NeuronOctober 06, 2011In BriefIn the piriform cortex, individual odorants activate a unique ensemble of neurons that are distributed without discernable spatial order. Piriform neurons receive convergent excitatory inputs from random collections of olfactory bulb glomeruli. Pyramidal cells also make extensive recurrent connections with other excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We introduced channelrhodopsin into the piriform cortex to characterize these intrinsic circuits and to examine their contribution to activity driven by afferent bulbar inputs.

https://openalex.org/W1963856990,"High-frequency hippocampal network oscillations, or ""ripples,"" are thought to be involved in episodic memory. According to current theories, memory traces are represented by assemblies of principal neurons that are activated during ripple-associated network states. Here we performed in vivo and in vitro experiments to investigate the synaptic mechanisms during ripples. We discovered postsynaptic currents that are phase-locked to ripples and coherent among even distant CA1 pyramidal neurons. These fast currents are consistent with excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) as they are observed at the equilibrium potential of Cl(-), and they display kinetics characteristic of EPSCs. Furthermore, they survived after intracellular blockade of GABAergic transmission and are effective to regulate the timing of action potentials. In addition, our data show a progressive synchronization of phasic excitation and inhibition during the course of ripples. Together, our results demonstrate the presence of phasic excitation during ripples reflecting an exquisite temporal coordination of assemblies of active pyramidal cells."

Recent microarray studies have shown that human iPSCs carry elevated levels of DNA copy number variation compared with those in embryonic stem cells, suggesting that these and other classes of genomic structural variation (SV), including inversions, smaller duplications and deletions, complex rearrangements, and retroelement transpositions, may frequently arise as a consequence of reprogramming.

These results show that genome stability can persist throughout reprogramming, and argue that it is possible to generate iPSCs lacking gene-disrupting mutations using current reprogramming methods. Reprogramming can produce iPSCs with few (one or two) de novo structural variants Structural variants arise in donor somatic cells and during iPSC generation iPSCs harboring de novo mutations contribute to tissues of iPSC-derived mice Endogenous retroelements remain inactive during reprogramming The process of direct reprogramming transforms differentiated somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines that possess the capacity to generate all cell types in an organism. Although iPSCs are functionally similar to embryonic stem cells (ESCs), several aspects of iPSC production suggest that these cells may harbor increased numbers of mutations relative to those in ESCs. First, reprogramming involves expression of known oncogenes such as c-Myc and Klf4, and is enhanced by downregulating genes that promote genome stability such as p53 (reviewed in Deng and Xu, 2009Deng W. Xu Y. Genome integrity: linking pluripotency and tumorgenicity.Trends Genet. 2009; 25: 425-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Second, reprogramming involves global epigenetic remodeling, including histone alteration, genome-wide demethylation, and de novo DNA methylation, which may be mutagenic or lead to activation of endogenous retroelements (Koche et al., 2011Koche R.P. Smith Z.D. Adli M. Gu H. Ku M. Gnirke A. Bernstein B.E. Meissner A.

Klugman S. et al.Hotspots of aberrant epigenomic reprogramming in human induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2011; 471: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). Third, ESCs employ less error-prone DNA repair mechanisms than do somatic cells, and failure to reset these during reprogramming could contribute mutations to iPSCs (Fan et al., 2011Fan J. Robert C. Jang Y.Y. Liu H. Sharkis S. Baylin S.B. Rassool F.V.

Cell Differ. 2011; 53: 415-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Finally, iPSCs are derived from differentiated cell types instead of early embryos, suggesting that somatic mutations in donor cells may contribute genetic diversity to these cell lines, which could be deleterious. A mutational class of particular concern is genomic structural variation (SV). SVs include duplications, deletions, insertions, inversions, translocations, and complex rearrangements. Because SVs can affect gene copy number and/or structure and arise at high rates in unstable genomic regions (Zhang et al., 2009Zhang F. Gu W. Hurles M.E. Lupski J.R. Copy number variation in human health, disease, and evolution.Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2009; 10: 451-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar), they are most likely to have a functional impact on iPSCs or their derivatives. Moreover, a highly mutagenic source of SV is transposition of endogenous retroelements, such as LINEs, which have recently been shown to cause unexpectedly high levels of genome diversity in germ line cells (Akagi et al., 2008Akagi K.

Whether retroelements become active during or after reprogramming is not known. Recent genome-wide surveys have reported that human iPSC lines harbor high levels of de novo SV. One study (Mayshar et al., 2010Mayshar Y. Ben-David U. Lavon N. Biancotti J.C. Yakir B. Clark A.T. Plath K. Lowry W.E. Benvenisty N.

Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) used array-based methods to map smaller CNVs. All report a highly significant excess of CNVs in iPSCs relative to ESCs and fibroblasts. However, these studies were blind to smaller (<10 kb) variants that comprise the vast majority of CNVs (Mills et al., 2011Mills R.E. Walter K. Stewart C. Handsaker R.E. Chen K. Alkan C. Abyzov A. Yoon S.C. Ye K. Cheetham R.K. et al.1000 Genomes ProjectMapping copy number variation by population-scale genome sequencing.Nature. 2011; 470: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), and could not detect balanced rearrangements or transposon insertions, both of which are common in mammalian genomes (Zhang et al., 2009Zhang F. Gu W. Hurles M.E. Lupski J.R. Copy number variation in human health, disease, and evolution.Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2009; 10: 451-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). In this context the high mutational burden reported by these studies is alarming, and raises the question of whether the reprogramming process is inherently mutagenic. This study aims to determine whether reprogramming to pluripotency involves inherently mutagenic steps independent of the effects of somatic development, extensive passaging, and incomplete reprogramming. Therefore, we sought to measure levels of de novo SV in early-passage iPSCs derived from low-passage mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), using methods that distinguish between mutations inherited from donor cells and those acquired during reprogramming. We also controlled for incomplete reprogramming by profiling iPSC lines that generate viable mice derived entirely from the iPSCs (termed fully pluripotent iPSCs) (Boland et al., 2009Boland M.J. Hazen J.L. Nazor K.L. Rodriguez A.R. Gifford W. Martin G. Kupriyanov S. Baldwin K.K. Adult mice generated from induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2009; 461: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). We analyzed the genomes of three iPSC lines using whole-genome paired-end DNA sequencing and highly sensitive SV detection algorithms, yet we observed strikingly few mutations (one or two per line) and found no evidence for retroelement activation. These results argue that it is possible to identify iPSCs lacking deleterious genomic changes using current reprogramming methods. The most common methods for identifying CNVs are array comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) and SNP genotyping arrays, which have limited resolution and cannot detect balanced rearrangements or transposon insertions. To overcome these limitations we examined iPSC genomes using Illumina DNA sequencing and improved SV detection algorithms (Figure 1A ). We obtained 170–210 million paired-end sequence reads (readpairs) from three iPSC lines and their parent fibroblasts, representing 10×–12× physical coverage (Figure 1E), and used two complementary approaches to identify SVs: paired-end mapping (PEM) and read depth of coverage analysis (DOC) (Figures 1B and 1C). PEM involves clustering readpairs that span SV breakpoints and can, in principle, identify all forms of SV. We used an improved version of HYDRA, an algorithm we developed previously (Quinlan et al., 2010Quinlan A.R. Clark R.A. Sokolova S. Leibowitz M.L. Zhang Y. Hurles M.E. Mell J.C. Hall I.M. Genome-wide mapping and assembly of structural variant breakpoints in the mouse genome.Genome Res. 2010; 20: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Importantly, HYDRA incorporates alternate mappings for readpairs derived from repetitive elements (Figure 1B), which allows for identification of breakpoints involving transposons and segmental duplications, which are among the most mutable genomic elements. Our iPSC lines were derived from a mixed strain mouse, and are thus expected to differ from the C57BL/6J reference genome by thousands of inherited SVs (Quinlan et al., 2010Quinlan A.R. Clark R.A. Sokolova S. Leibowitz M.L. Zhang Y. Hurles M.E. Mell J.C. Hall I.M. Genome-wide mapping and assembly of structural variant breakpoints in the mouse genome.Genome Res. 2010; 20: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Distinguishing de novo SV from inherited SV in this context is a difficult and unsolved technical problem. We therefore developed a method to identify breakpoints from pooled multisample data (Figure 1D; http://code.google.com/p/hydra-sv/) that greatly increases the accuracy of determining whether a given SV is a true de novo variant. Here we achieved ∼300 bp resolution, which is at least 30-fold greater than the highest-resolution iPSC genome surveys to date (Hussein et al., 2011Hussein S.M. Batada N.N. Vuoristo S. Ching R.W. Autio R. Närvä E. Ng S. Sourour M. Hämäläinen R. Olsson C. et al.Copy number variation and selection during reprogramming to pluripotency.Nature. 2011; 471: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, Laurent et al., 2011Laurent L.C.

DOC analysis relies on the observation that the local read depth is directly related to DNA copy number, and is conceptually similar to array-CGH, yet more sensitive. We performed DOC analysis with a custom algorithm (Quinlan et al., 2010Quinlan A.R. Clark R.A. Sokolova S. Leibowitz M.L. Zhang Y. Hurles M.E. Mell J.C. Hall I.M. Genome-wide mapping and assembly of structural variant breakpoints in the mouse genome.Genome Res. 2010; 20: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) that provides ∼15 kb resolution (Figure 1C). To assess the inherent mutagenicity of reprogramming, we wished to examine fully reprogrammed iPSCs that had not been subjected to extensive passaging or clonal selection. Here, we sequenced DNA from low-passage iPSC lines that generate viable mice in tetraploid embryo complementation (TEC) assays, demonstrating that they have completed reprogramming (Boland et al., 2009Boland M.J. Hazen J.L. Nazor K.L. Rodriguez A.R. Gifford W. Martin G. Kupriyanov S. Baldwin K.K. Adult mice generated from induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2009; 461: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). We produced these lines by transducing MEFs with lentiviruses containing Oct4, Klf4, Sox2, and c-Myc under the control of a doxycycline (dox)-inducible promoter. Following viral transduction, the MEFs were allowed to divide one or two times before reprogramming was initiated by the addition of dox. This protocol allows us to identify pairs of “sister” iPSC lines that arise from the same donor cell (Figure 2A ). Sister colonies arising at separate locations will have identical patterns of proviral insertions but will have undergone distinct reprogramming events. Mutations common to both sister lines, yet absent from other iPSCs, are likely to be SVs inherited from a donor cell, whereas mutations unique to a single sister line must have arisen during or after reprogramming. In this study we sequenced a pair of sister iPSCs (iMZ-9 and 21) and a line that arose from a different donor cell (iMZ-11) (Boland et al., 2009Boland M.J. Hazen J.L. Nazor K.L. Rodriguez A.R. Gifford W. Martin G. Kupriyanov S. Baldwin K.K. Adult mice generated from induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2009; 461: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). To confirm the lineage of sister iPSC lines and establish the sensitivity of HYDRA, we mapped proviral insertion sites. We aligned readpairs to both the reference genome and the lentiviral gene sequences and identified HYDRA breakpoint calls consistent with proviral integration events. This confirmed the clonal origin of the iPSCs and accurately identified 21 proviral insertions (Figure 2B), which is 3 more than could be clearly distinguished in Southern blots (Boland et al., 2009Boland M.J. Hazen J.L. Nazor K.L. Rodriguez A.R. Gifford W. Martin G. Kupriyanov S. Baldwin K.K. Adult mice generated from induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2009; 461: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). We also detected the intronless reprogramming genes in the lentiviral vectors, as expected (Figure 2C). These data provide an initial estimate of the validity and sensitivity of our methods. We applied DOC and PEM analyses to identify candidate de novo SVs that are present in one or more iPSC lines but not in the parental MEFs. Surprisingly, DOC analysis identified only one de novo CNV (SV3), an ∼358 kb duplication in Plxna4 that was also detected by PEM and was present only in iMZ-21 (Figure 1C, Figures 3A and 3B ). More sensitive PEM analyses using the HYDRA algorithm identified 16,579 high-confidence SV breakpoints. Of these, 13,099 (79%) were detected in the parental MEF sample and are thus, by definition, inherited variants. The remaining 3,480 breakpoints are candidate de novo mutations. This number of candidates is expected to occur by chance given the abundance of SV between mouse strains (Quinlan et al., 2010Quinlan A.R. Clark R.A. Sokolova S. Leibowitz M.L. Zhang Y. Hurles M.E. Mell J.C. Hall I.M. Genome-wide mapping and assembly of structural variant breakpoints in the mouse genome.Genome Res. 2010; 20: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and the moderate physical coverage of our data sets. While HYDRA achieves presence/absence breakpoint “genotyping” at ∼89%–94% accuracy in the four cell lines, the large number of inherited SVs produces false mutation calls at breakpoints that, by chance, lack sequence coverage in one or more samples. We addressed this by using multinomial sampling to prioritize candidate mutations whose readpair distribution among the iPSC lines was unlikely to occur by chance. We used PCR to validate 182 candidates (Figure S1, Table S1, available online). Of these, 101 were present in all samples and thus represent germline variants; 18 candidates failed two independent PCR attempts, either because they were false positive calls or due to primer failure; and 64 breakpoints were validated as de novo mutations (Table S3). These represent 45 distinct SVs (Table S2). SVs include multiple mutational classes. Of the 45 de novo SVs we identified, only four fell into the “canonical” class defined as deletions, duplications, and inversions (Figures 3A–3C). The remaining 41 were insertions of an exogenous retroelement, which we discuss later. The sister lines (iMZ-9 and 21) shared one mutation (SV2) not found in iMZ-11 or the MEFs, suggesting that SV2 originated as a somatic mutation in the donor MEF. SV2 is a complex rearrangement on chromosome 11 marked by two large (31.3 kb and 43.7 kb) overlapping inversion breakpoint calls (Figure 3B). The simplest explanation for this breakpoint pattern is an ∼12 kb inverted duplication in which the duplicated segments are separated by ∼31 kb of nonduplicated sequence. DOC analysis supports this interpretation. The duplicated segment lies between two alternatively spliced first exons of Kcnj12, an inwardly rectifying potassium channel expressed in the brain, the heart, and other tissues (Oyamada et al., 2005Oyamada Y. Yamaguchi K. Murai M. Hakuno H. Ishizaka A. Role of Kir2.2 in hypercapnic ventilatory response during postnatal development of mouse.Respir. Physiol. Neurobiol. 2005; 145: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Each line also contained one additional line-specific SV. The iMZ-21 line carried SV3, a 358 kb multiexon duplication in Plxna4 which is a cell surface signaling protein expressed in multiple tissues including the brain, blood, and heart (Suto et al., 2003Suto F. Murakami Y. Nakamura F. Goshima Y. Fujisawa H. Identification and characterization of a novel mouse plexin, plexin-A4.Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Line iMZ-9 carried SV1, an ∼3.5 kb deletion that removes three exons of Cspp1, a widely expressed gene involved in cytokinesis and cell cycle (Asiedu et al., 2009Asiedu M. Wu D. Matsumura F. Wei Q. Centrosome/spindle pole-associated protein regulates cytokinesis via promoting the recruitment of MyoGEF to the central spindle.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 1428-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Strikingly, line iMZ-11 carried only a single 400 bp deletion in a nongenic region (SV4). To infer the origin of each putative de novo SV, we generated 95 subclones of each iPSC line and performed PCR (Figure 3D). This showed that SV2, as expected, is present in all subclones, whereas SV1 and SV3 are mosaic (65% and 97%, respectively), consistent with their arising early in reprogramming or providing a selective advantage to the iPSCs. SV4 was present in all subclones, consistent with a somatic donor origin. However, SV4 is located only 524 bp from a proviral integration site, suggesting an alternative scenario in which it arose concomitantly with viral insertion (Figure 3B). The mechanism for such an event is unclear, but we note that adjacent deletions are associated with a subset of SINE retroelement insertions in the human genome (Xing et al., 2009Xing J. Zhang Y. Han K. Salem A.H. Sen S.K. Huff C.D. Zhou Q. Kirkness E.F. Levy S. Batzer M.A. Jorde L.B. Mobile elements create structural variation: analysis of a complete human genome.Genome Res. 2009; 19: 1516-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the mechanisms responsible for these rearrangements, we sequenced each SV breakpoint (Figure S2). None exhibit more than 5 bp of homology and SV3 contains a 12 bp insertion. This indicates that the SVs did not arise through nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) but instead through nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) or microhomology-mediated break-induced replication (MMBIR) (Hastings et al., 2009Hastings P.J. Ira G. Lupski J.R. A microhomology-mediated break-induced replication model for the origin of human copy number variation.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000327Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The complex multibreakpoint structure of SV2 and the insertion in SV3 are more characteristic of MMBIR. To address the functional relevance of these variants, we analyzed tissues from iPSC mice and from chimeric mice with iPSC contribution. Previous studies indicate that mice generated by these methods derive from at most three pluripotent cells (Wang and Jaenisch, 2004Wang Z. Jaenisch R. At most three ES cells contribute to the somatic lineages of chimeric mice and of mice produced by ES-tetraploid complementation.Dev. Biol. 2004; 275: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, selection against SV1 in the early embryo (65% of iMZ-9 cells) could result in its absence from tissues of iPSC mice, while selection against SV2 (100% of iMZ-9 cells) could exclude this SV from tissues in chimeric mice. However, genomic PCR showed that SVs could be detected in tissues of chimeric or iPSC mice (Figure 3E, iMZ-11 data not shown). In addition, RT-qPCR analyses of the genes affected by SV1, SV2, and SV3 indicate that their expression is reduced in iPSCs and/or relevant tissues (Figure S2). The mouse genome contains numerous endogenous retroelements that are repressed in somatic cells but active in germ cells, early embryonic lineages, and cells with epigenetic perturbations (Maksakova et al., 2008Maksakova I.A. Mager D.L. Reiss D. Keeping active endogenous retroviral-like elements in check: the epigenetic perspective.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 3329-3347Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The epigenetic remodeling that occurs during reprogramming could activate these normally repressed retroelements, which would be highly deleterious. HYDRA allows us to address this important unanswered question at the whole-genome level. We identified 41 retroelement insertion events among the three iPSC lines. Strikingly, all 41 were endogenous retrovirus elements from the mouse leukemia virus (MLV) family. Each iPSC line displayed a distinct insertional pattern, indicating that transposition occurred during or after reprogramming (Figure 4A ). However, closer inspection of the MLV sequence showed that it was not an endogenous element because it contained 58 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were not present in the most similar MLV sequence in the donor MEFs (Figure S4). SNP genotyping confirmed that the mutagenic MLV element matched an MLV found in CF-1 MEFs that were used as feeder cells, suggesting that these feeders transmitted an activated MLV to the iPSCs (Figure 4B). This effect seems to be batch specific because other similarly derived fully pluripotent iPSC lines that were expanded on a different batch of CF-1 feeders lack insertions (Figure 4C and K.K.B., unpublished data). This underscores the precautions that must be taken when working with feeder cells. Importantly, we did not detect a single de novo endogenous retroelement transposition among the iPSC lines, despite the demonstrated sensitivity of our detection methods. This suggests that reprogramming using the canonical “Yamanaka” factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) can preserve retroelement silencing throughout the dramatic epigenetic changes required to produce fully pluripotent iPSC lines. Given the paucity of new mutations discovered in this study, a key question is how many we may have missed. To address this we used two independent methods to estimate the false negative rate (FNR) for SV detection. First, we evaluated HYDRA's ability to detect the lentiviral insertions used for reprogramming. Using a combination of Southern blots (Boland et al., 2009Boland M.J. Hazen J.L. Nazor K.L. Rodriguez A.R. Gifford W. Martin G. Kupriyanov S. Baldwin K.K. Adult mice generated from induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2009; 461: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), PEM, manual inspection of raw sequence data, and PCR validation, we identified 24 proviral insertions representing 48 breakpoints. This is three more insertions than were detected by HYDRA (Figure 2) and six more than detected by Southern blots. We then measured the fraction of breakpoints that were detected by HYDRA at sufficient confidence to be selected as candidate mutations for experimental validation. This resulted in a per variant FNR of 4%–47%, depending on the iPSC line and SV class (i.e., one or two breakpoint SVs). Second, we assessed detection of 2,284 inherited SVs caused by segregating variation among mouse strains (Quinlan et al., 2010Quinlan A.R. Clark R.A. Sokolova S. Leibowitz M.L. Zhang Y. Hurles M.E. Mell J.C. Hall I.M. Genome-wide mapping and assembly of structural variant breakpoints in the mouse genome.Genome Res. 2010; 20: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This predicted a per variant FNR of 22%–53%. Therefore, in the worst case we have missed roughly half of the SVs that exist in these genomes, which means that the iPSCs harbor two to four total mutations. These calculations strongly support our conclusion that very few de novo SVs exist in these iPSC lines. One caveat is that PEM cannot detect breakpoints formed by NAHR between large repeats, but this should be a minor source of false negatives. NAHR mutations are detectable by DOC analysis, and NAHR is less frequent in somatic cells than in the germline (Hampton et al., 2009Hampton O.A. Den Hollander P. Miller C.A. Delgado D.A. Li J.

https://openalex.org/W1967036516,"Mitral/tufted cells of the olfactory bulb receive odorant information from receptor neurons and transmit this information to the cortex. Studies in awake behaving animals have found that sustained responses of mitral cells to odorants are rare, suggesting sparse combinatorial representation of the odorants. Careful alignment of mitral cell firing with the phase of the respiration cycle revealed brief transient activity in the larger population of mitral cells, which respond to odorants during a small fraction of the respiration cycle. Responses of these cells are therefore temporally sparse. Here, we propose a mathematical model for the olfactory bulb network that can reproduce both combinatorially and temporally sparse mitral cell codes. We argue that sparse codes emerge as a result of the balance between mitral cells' excitatory inputs and inhibition provided by the granule cells. Our model suggests functional significance for the dendrodendritic synapses mediating interactions between mitral and granule cells."

Group 1 mGluRs regulate CP-AMPARs via a pathway that requires intracellular Ca2+, PI3 kinase, PICK-1 and JNK. Purinergic receptor activation decreases CP-AMPAR expression. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), a major glial cell type that gives rise to myelinating oligodendrocytes in the CNS, express calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs). Although CP-AMPARs are important for OPC proliferation and neuron-glia signaling, they render OPCs susceptible to ischemic damage in early development. We identified factors controlling the dynamic regulation of AMPAR subtypes in OPCs from rat optic nerve and mouse cerebellar cortex. We found that activation of group 1 mGluRs drove an increase in the proportion of CP-AMPARs, reflected by an increase in single-channel conductance and inward rectification. This plasticity required the elevation of intracellular calcium and used PI3K, PICK-1 and the JNK pathway. In white matter, neurons and astrocytes release both ATP and glutamate. Unexpectedly, activation of purinergic receptors in OPCs decreased CP-AMPAR expression, suggesting a capacity for homeostatic regulation. Finally, we found that stargazin-related transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins, which are critical for AMPAR surface expression in neurons, regulate CP-AMPAR plasticity in OPCs."

Here we report a mechanism that controls the light sensitivity and operational range of rod-driven bipolar cells that mediate dim-light vision. Our data indicate that the light responses of these cells are enhanced by sustained chloride currents via GABA(C) receptor channels. This sensitizing GABAergic input is controlled by dopamine D1 receptors, with horizontal cells serving as a plausible source of GABA release. Our findings expand the role of dopamine in vision from its well-established function of suppressing rod-driven signals in bright light to enhancing the same signals under dim illumination. They further reveal a role for GABA in sensitizing the circuitry for dim-light vision, thereby complementing GABA's traditional role in providing dynamic feedforward and feedback inhibition in the retina."
https://openalex.org/W2034114163,"The distribution of postsynaptic glutamate receptors has been shown to be regulated by proimmunocytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) signaling. The role of TNF-α receptor subtypes in mediating glutamate receptor expression, trafficking, and function still remains unclear. Here, we report that TNF receptor subtypes (TNFR1 and TNFR2) differentially modulate α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor (AMPAR) clustering and function in cultured cortical neurons. We find that genetic deletion of TNFR1 decreases surface expression and synaptic localization of the AMPAR GluA1 subunit, reduces the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC), and reduces AMPA-induced maximal whole-cell current. In addition, these results are not observed in TNFR2-deleted neurons. The decreased AMPAR expression and function in TNFR1-deleted cells are not significantly restored by short (2 h) or long (24 h) term exposure to TNF-α. In TNFR2-deleted cells, TNF-α promotes AMPAR trafficking to the synapse and increases mEPSC frequency. In the present study, we find no significant change in the GluN1 subunit of NMDAR clusters, location, and mEPSC. This includes applying or withholding the TNF-α treatment in both TNFR1- and TNFR2-deleted neurons. Our results indicate that TNF receptor subtype 1 but not 2 plays a critical role in modulating AMPAR clustering, suggesting that targeting TNFR1 gene might be a novel approach to preventing neuronal AMPAR-mediated excitotoxicity.—He, P., Liu, Q., Wu, J., Shen, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2081759767,"Pruning that selectively removes unnecessary axons/dendrites is crucial for sculpting neural circuits during development. During Drosophila metamorphosis, dendritic arborization sensory neurons, ddaCs, selectively prune their larval dendrites in response to the steroid hormone ecdysone. However, it is unknown whether epigenetic factors are involved in dendrite pruning. Here, we analyzed 81 epigenetic factors, from which a Brahma (Brm)-containing chromatin remodeler and a histone acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein (CBP) were identified for their critical roles in initiating dendrite pruning. Brm and CBP specifically activate a key ecdysone response gene, sox14, but not EcR-B1. Furthermore, the HAT activity of CBP is important for sox14 expression and dendrite pruning. EcR-B1 associates with CBP in the presence of ecdysone, which is facilitated by Brm, resulting in local enrichment of an active chromatin mark H3K27Ac at the sox14 locus. Thus, specific intrinsic epigenetic factors cooperate with steroid hormones to activate selective transcriptional programs, thereby initiating neuronal remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2072543390,"Single Particle Tracking (SPT) is a powerful technique for the analysis of the lateral diffusion of the lipid and protein components of biological membranes. In neurons, SPT allows the study of the real-time dynamics of receptors for neurotransmitters that diffuse continuously in and out synapses. In the simplest case where the membrane is flat and is parallel to the focal plane of the microscope the analysis of diffusion from SPT data is relatively straightforward. However, in most biological samples the membranes are curved, which complicates analysis and may lead to erroneous conclusions as for the mode of lateral diffusion. Here we considered the case of lateral diffusion in tubular membranes, such as axons, dendrites or the neck of dendritic spines. Monte Carlo simulations allowed us to evaluate the error in diffusion coefficient (D) calculation if the curvature is not taken into account. The underestimation is determined by the diameter of the tubular surface, the frequency of image acquisition and the degree of mobility itself. We found that projected trajectories give estimates that are 25 to 50% lower than the real D in case of 2D-SPT over the tubular surface. The use of 3D-SPT improved the measurements if the frequency of image acquisition was fast enough in relation to the mobility of the molecules and the diameter of the tube. Nevertheless, the calculation of D from the components of displacements in the axis of the tubular structure gave accurate estimate of D, free of geometrical artefacts. We show the application of this approach to analyze the diffusion of a lipid on model tubular membranes and of a membrane-bound GFP on neurites from cultured rat hippocampal neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2154389415,"H9N2 influenza A viruses have become endemic in different types of terrestrial poultry and wild birds in Asia, and are occasionally transmitted to humans and pigs. To evaluate the role of black-billed magpies (Pica pica) in the evolution of influenza A virus, we conducted two epidemic surveys on avian influenza viruses in wild black-billed magpies in Guangxi, China in 2005 and characterized three isolated black-billed magpie H9N2 viruses (BbM viruses). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that three BbM viruses were almost identical with 99.7 to 100% nucleotide homology in their whole genomes, and were reassortants containing BJ94-like (Ck/BJ/1/94) HA, NA, M, and NS genes, SH/F/98-like (Ck/SH/F/98) PB2, PA, and NP genes, and H5N1-like (Ck/YN/1252/03, clade 1) PB1 genes. Genetic analysis showed that BbM viruses were most likely the result of multiple reassortments between co-circulating H9N2-like and H5N1-like viruses, and were genetically different from other H9N2 viruses because of the existence of H5N1-like PB1 genes. Genotypical analysis revealed that BbM viruses evolved from diverse sources and belonged to a novel genotype (B46) discovered in our recent study. Molecular analysis suggested that BbM viruses were likely low pathogenic reassortants. However, results of our pathogenicity study demonstrated that BbM viruses replicated efficiently in chickens and a mammalian mouse model but were not lethal for infected chickens and mice. Antigenic analysis showed that BbM viruses were antigenic heterologous with the H9N2 vaccine strain. Our study is probably the first report to document and characterize H9N2 influenza viruses isolated from black-billed magpies in southern China. Our results suggest that black-billed magpies were susceptible to H9N2 influenza viruses, which raise concerns over possible transmissions of reassortant H9N2 viruses among poultry and wild birds."
https://openalex.org/W1983175973,"The cognitive signature of unconscious processes is hotly debated recently. Generally, consciousness is thought to mediate flexible, adaptive and goal-directed behavior, but in the last decade unconscious processing has rapidly gained ground on traditional conscious territory. In this study we demonstrate that the scope and impact of unconscious information on behavior and brain activity can be modulated dynamically on a trial-by-trial basis. Participants performed a Go/No-Go experiment in which an unconscious (masked) stimulus preceding a conscious target could be associated with either a Go or No-Go response. Importantly, the mapping of stimuli onto these actions varied on a trial-by-trial basis, preventing the formation of stable associations and hence the possibility that unconscious stimuli automatically activate these control actions. By eliminating stimulus-response associations established through practice we demonstrate that unconscious information can be processed in a flexible and adaptive manner. In this experiment we show that the same unconscious stimulus can have a substantially different effect on behavior and (prefrontal) brain activity depending on the rapidly changing task context in which it is presented. This work suggests that unconscious information processing shares many sophisticated characteristics (including flexibility and context-specificity) with its conscious counterpart."

We aimed to characterize PCDH1 mRNA transcripts and protein expression in primary bronchial epithelial cells and to determine regulation of PCDH1 during mucociliary differentiation. Total RNA and protein were isolated from human primary bronchial epithelial cells. PCDH1 transcripts were characterized by rapid amplification of cDNA ends in bronchial epithelial cells of 4 subjects. PCDH1 expression was quantified by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting in bronchial epithelial cells directly ex vivo and after air liquid interface (ALI) or submerged culture. We identified 5 novel exons on the 5‘ end and 1 exon on the 3‘ end of PCDH1. Novel transcripts showed major variation in expression of intracellular conserved motifs. Expression levels of PCDH1 transcripts encoding exon 1-2 were 4-fold higher, and transcripts encoding exon 3-4 were 15-fold higher in freshly isolated bronchial epithelial cells than in submerged cultures. PCDH1 mRNA β-to 8-fold) and protein levels (2- to 3-fold) were strongly up-regulated during mucociliary differentiation of primary bronchial epithelial cells in ALI cultures.

Cytogenotoxicity was induced by exposing the cells to selected concentrations (10 and 50 µg/ml) of either of TiO2-NPs or MWCNTs for 24 h. Anti-cytogenotoxicity effects of DMTU and NAC were studied in two groups, i.e., treatment of 30 minutes prior to toxic insult (short term exposure), while the other group received DMTU and NAC treatment during nanoparticles exposure, i.e., 24 h (long term exposure). Investigations were carried out for cell viability, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), micronuclei (MN), and expression of markers of oxidative stress (HSP27, CYP2E1), genotoxicity (P53) and CYP2E1 dependent n- nitrosodimethylamine-demethylase (NDMA-d) activity. In general, the treatment of both DMTU and NAC was found to be effective significantly against TiO2-NPs and MWCNTs induced cytogenotoxicity in A549 cells. Long-term treatment of DMTU and NAC during toxic insults has shown better prevention than short-term pretreatment. Although, cells responded significantly to both DMTU and NAC, but responses were chemical specific. In part, TiO2-NPs induced toxic responses were mediated through OH• radicals generation and reduction in the antioxidant defense system. While in the case of MWCNTs, adverse effects were primarily due to altering/hampering the enzymatic antioxidant system.

https://openalex.org/W2095111544,"Background Arylamine N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) is an important catalytic enzyme that metabolizes the carcinogenic arylamines, hydrazine drugs and chemicals. This enzyme is highly polymorphic in different human populations. Several polymorphisms of NAT2, including the single amino acid substitutions R64Q, I114T, D122N, L137F, Q145P, R197Q, and G286E, are classified as slow acetylators, whereas the wild-type NAT2 is classified as a fast acetylator. The slow acetylators are often associated with drug toxicity and efficacy as well as cancer susceptibility. The biological functions of these 7 mutations have previously been characterized, but the structural basis behind the reduced catalytic activity and reduced protein level is not clear. Methodology/Principal Findings We performed multiple molecular dynamics simulations of these mutants as well as NAT2 to investigate the structural and dynamical effects throughout the protein structure, specifically the catalytic triad, cofactor binding site, and the substrate binding pocket. None of these mutations induced unfolding; instead, their effects were confined to the inter-domain, domain 3 and 17-residue insert region, where the flexibility was significantly reduced relative to the wild-type. Structural effects of these mutations propagate through space and cause a change in catalytic triad conformation, cofactor binding site, substrate binding pocket size/shape and electrostatic potential. Conclusions/Significance Our results showed that the dynamical properties of all the mutant structures, especially in inter-domain, domain 3 and 17-residue insert region were affected in the same manner. Similarly, the electrostatic potential of all the mutants were altered and also the functionally important regions such as catalytic triad, cofactor binding site, and substrate binding pocket adopted different orientation and/or conformation relative to the wild-type that may affect the functions of the mutants. Overall, our study may provide the structural basis for reduced catalytic activity and protein level, as was experimentally observed for these polymorphisms."
https://openalex.org/W2148494431,"Background To date, there is little information that reflects the true extent of spread of the pH1N1/2009v influenza pandemic at the community level as infection often results in mild or no clinical symptoms. This study aimed at assessing through a prospective study, the attack rate of pH1N1/2009 virus in Reunion Island and risk factors of infection, during the 2009 season. Methodology/Principal Findings A serosurvey was conducted during the 2009 austral winter, in the frame of a prospective population study. Pairs of sera were collected from 1687 individuals belonging to 772 households, during and after passage of the pandemic wave. Antibodies to pH1N1/2009v were titered using the hemagglutination inhibition assay (HIA) with titers ≥1/40 being considered positive. Seroprevalence during the first two weeks of detection of pH1N1/2009v in Reunion Island was 29.8% in people under 20 years of age, 35.6% in adults (20–59 years) and 73.3% in the elderly (≥60 years) (P<0.0001). Baseline corrected cumulative incidence rates, were 42.9%, 13.9% and 0% in these age groups respectively (P<0.0001). A significant decline in antibody titers occurred soon after the passage of the epidemic wave. Seroconversion rates to pH1N1/2009 correlated negatively with age: 63.2%, 39.4% and 16.7%, in each age group respectively (P<0.0001). Seroconversion occurred in 65.2% of individuals who were seronegative at inclusion compared to 6.8% in those who were initially seropositive. Conclusions Seroincidence of pH1N1/2009v infection was three times that estimated from clinical surveillance, indicating that almost two thirds of infections occurring at the community level have escaped medical detection. People under 20 years of age were the most affected group. Pre-epidemic titers ≥1/40 prevented seroconversion and are likely protective against infection. A concern was raised about the long term stability of the antibody responses."
https://openalex.org/W1989502888,"Intermediate filaments (IFs) in cardiomyocytes consist primarily of desmin, surround myofibrils at Z disks, and transmit forces from the contracting myofilaments to the cell surface through costameres at the sarcolemma and desmosomes at intercalated disks. Synemin is a type IV IF protein that forms filaments with desmin and also binds α-actinin and vinculin. Here we examine the roles and expression of the α and β forms of synemin in developing rat cardiomyocytes. Quantitative PCR showed low levels of expression for both synemin mRNAs, which peaked at postnatal day 7. Synemin was concentrated at sites of cell-cell adhesion and at Z disks in neonatal cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of the individual isoforms showed that α-synemin preferentially localized to cell-cell junctions, whereas β-synemin was primarily at the level of Z disks. An siRNA targeted to both synemin isoforms reduced protein expression in cardiomyocytes by 70% and resulted in a failure of desmin to align with Z disks and disrupted cell-cell junctions, with no effect on sarcomeric organization. Solubility assays showed that β-synemin was soluble and interacted with sarcomeric α-actinin by coimmunoprecipitation, while α-synemin and desmin were insoluble. We conclude that β-synemin mediates the association of desmin IFs with Z disks, whereas α-synemin stabilizes junctional complexes between cardiomyocytes."

This hybrid zone involves complex interactions between 2 morphologically and ecologically divergent subspecies, 3 chromosomal groups, and 4 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) clades. The spatial patterns of divergence between morphology, chromosomes and mtDNA are discordant, and determining which of these character types (if any) reflects the underlying population-level lineages that are of interest has remained impeded by character conflict. The focus of this study is to estimate the number of populations interacting in the hybrid zone using multi-locus nuclear data, and to then estimate the migration rates and divergence time between the inferred populations. Multi-locus estimates of population structure and gene flow were obtained from 12 anonymous nuclear loci sequenced for 93 specimens of Sceloporus. Population structure estimates support two populations, and this result is robust to changes to the prior probability distribution used in the Bayesian analysis and the use of spatially-explicit or non-spatial models. A coalescent analysis of population divergence suggests that gene flow is high between the two populations, and that the timing of divergence is restricted to the Pleistocene. The hybrid zone is more accurately described as involving two populations belonging to S. tristichus, and the presence of S. cowlesi mtDNA haplotypes in the hybrid zone is an anomaly resulting from mitochondrial introgression."

The androgen receptor (AR) is a nuclear receptor that plays a pivotal role in normal and cancerous prostate tissue. AR interacts with a number of proteins modulating its stability, localization, and activity. To test the hypothesis that an increased expression of AR partners might foster tumor development, we immunopurified AR partners in human tumors xenografted into mice. One of the identified AR partners was the multifunctional enzyme carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase II, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase (CAD), which catalyzes the 3 initial steps of pyrimidine biosynthesis. We combined experiments in C4-2, LNCaP, 22RV1, and PC3 human prostate cell lines and analysis of frozen radical prostatectomy samples to study the CAD-AR interaction. We show here that in prostate tumor cells, CAD fosters AR translocation into the nucleus and stimulates its transcriptional activity. Notably, in radical prostatectomy specimens, CAD expression was not correlated with proliferation markers, but a higher CAD mRNA level was associated with local tumor extension (P= 0.049) and cancer relapse (P=0.017).

https://openalex.org/W2039212859,"The use of cyclosporine A (CsA) is limited by its severe nephrotoxicity that includes reversible vasoconstrictor effects and proximal tubule cell injury, the latter associated whith chronic kidney disease progression. The mechanisms of CsA-induced tubular injury, mainly on the S3 segment, have not been completely elucidated. Kidney androgen-regulated protein (KAP) is exclusively expressed in kidney proximal tubule cells, interacts with the CsA-binding protein cyclophilin B and its expression diminishes in kidneys of CsA-treated mice. Since we reported that KAP protects against CsA toxicity in cultured proximal tubule cells, we hypothesized that low KAP levels found in kidneys of CsA-treated mice might correlate with proximal tubule cell injury. To test this hypothesis, we used KAP Tg mice developed in our laboratory and showed that these mice are more resistant to CsA-induced tubular injury than control littermates. Furthermore, we found that calpain, which was activated by CsA in cell cultures and kidney, is involved in KAP degradation and observed that phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues found in KAP PEST sequences by protein kinase CK2 enhances KAP degradation by calpain. Moreover, we also observed that CK2 inhibition protected against CsA-induced cytotoxicity. These findings point to a novel mechanism for CsA-induced kidney toxicity that might be useful in developing therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing tubular cell damage while maintaining the immunosuppressive effects of CsA."

Inward rectifier K(+) (Kir) channels possess a unique extramembrane cytoplasmic domain that extends this pathway. However, the relevance and contribution of this domain to ion permeation remain unclear. By qualitative x-ray crystallographic analysis, we found that the pore in the cytoplasmic domain of Kir3.2 binds cations in a valency-dependent manner and does not allow the displacement of Mg(2+) by monovalent cations or spermine. Electrophysiological analyses revealed that the cytoplasmic pore of Kir3.2 selectively binds positively charged molecules and has a higher affinity for Mg(2+) when it has a low probability of being open. The selective blocking of chemical modification of the side chain of pore-facing residues by Mg(2+) indicates that the mode of binding of Mg(2+) is likely to be similar to that observed in the crystal structure. These results indicate that the Kir3.2 crystal structure has a closed conformation with a negative electrostatic field potential at the cytoplasmic pore, the potential of which may be controlled by conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domain to regulate ion diffusion along the pore."
https://openalex.org/W2050446154,"Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) plays important roles in neuronal cell development and function. Rem2 is a member of the RGK (Rad, Rem, Rem2, Gem/Kir) subfamily of small GTPases that confers potent inhibition upon VGCCs. The physiologic roles of RGK proteins, particularly in the brain, are poorly understood. Rem2 was implicated in synaptogenesis through an RNAi screen and proposed to regulate Ca2+ homeostasis in neurons. To test this hypothesis and uncover physiological roles for Rem2 in the brain, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which Rem2 knockdown affected synaptogenesis and Ca2+ homeostasis in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Expression of a cocktail of shRNAs targeting rat Rem2 (rRem2) reduced the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) measured 10 d after transfection (14 d in vitro), but did not affect mEPSC amplitude. VGCC current amplitude after rRem2-targeted knockdown was not different from that in control cells, however, at either 4 or 10 d post transfection. Co-expression of a human Rem2 that was insensitive to the shRNAs targeting rRem2 was unable to prevent the reduction in mEPSC frequency after rRem2-targeted knockdown. Over-expression of rRem2 resulted in 50% reduction in VGCC current, but neither the mEPSC frequency nor amplitude was affected. Taken together, the observed effects upon synaptogenesis after shRNA treatment are more likely due to mechanisms other than modulation of VGCCs and Ca2+ homeostasis, and may be independent of Rem2. In addition, our results reveal a surprising lack of contribution of VGCCs to synaptogenesis during early development in cultured hippocampal neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2086582466,"Although a large body of literature exists for the environmental risk factors for La Crosse virus (LACV) transmission, the demographic and socioeconomic risk factors for developing LACV infection have not been investigated. Therefore, this study investigated the demographic and socioeconomic risk factors for LACV infection in West Virginia from 2003 to 2007, using two forward stepwise discriminant analyses. The discriminant analyses were used to evaluate a number of demographic and socioeconomic factors for their ability to predict: 1) those census tracts with at least one reported case of LACV infection versus those census tracts with no reported cases of LACV infection and 2) to evaluate significantly high-risk clusters for LACV infection versus significantly low-risk clusters for LACV infection. In the first model, a high school education diploma or a general education diploma or less and a lower housing density were found to be predictive of those census tracts with at least one case of LACV infection. A high school or a general education diploma or less, lower housing density, and housing built in 1969 and earlier were all found to be predictive of those census tracts displaying high-risk clusters versus census tracts displaying low-risk clusters in the second model. The cluster discriminant analysis was found to be more predictive than the census tract discriminant analysis as indicated by the Eigenvalues, canonical correlation, and grouping accuracy. The results of this study indicate that socioeconomically disadvantaged populations are at the highest risk for LACV infection and should be a focus of LACV infection prevention efforts."
