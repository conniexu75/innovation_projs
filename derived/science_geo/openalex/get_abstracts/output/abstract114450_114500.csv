https://openalex.org/W2085972597,"A genetic system was devised that positively selects for bacterial genes that are specifically induced when bacteria infect their host. With the pathogen Salmonella typhimurium, the genes identified by this selection show a marked induction in bacteria recovered from mouse spleen. Mutations in all ivi (in vivo-induced) genes that were tested conferred a defect in virulence. This genetic system was designed to be of general use in a wide variety of bacterial-host systems and has several applications in both vaccine and antimicrobial drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2063023858,"During gastrulation, the three germ layers of the embryo are formed and organized along the anterior-posterior body axis. In the mouse, gastrulation involves the delamination of ectodermal cells through the primitive streak and their differentiation into mesoderm. These processes do not occur in embryos homozygous for a retrovirally induced recessive prenatal lethal mutation, the strain 413-d insertional mutation. Instead of giving rise to mesoderm, embryonic ectoderm in 413-d mutants overproliferates and then rapidly degenerates, although extraembryonic lineages remain viable. Here we isolate a candidate for the mutated gene which encodes a new member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily. Expression is first detected in primitive streak-stage embryos at about the time of mesoderm formation. It then becomes highly localized in the node at the anterior of the primitive streak. This region is analogous to chick Hensen's node and Xenopus dorsal lip (Spemann's organizer), which can induce secondary body axes when grafted into host embryos (reviewed in refs 5 and 6). Our findings suggest that this gene, named nodal, encodes a signalling molecule essential for mesoderm formation and subsequent organization of axial structures in early mouse development."
https://openalex.org/W2064121506,"The eyes absent (eya) gene is required at an early stage in development of the D. melanogaster compound eye. In eya mutants, progenitor cells in the eye disc undergo programmed cell death anterior to the morphogenetic furrow, rather than proceeding into the pathway of retinal differentiation. A low level of cell death normally occurs at this stage, suggesting that eya activity influences the distribution of cells between differentiation and death. Molecular analysis identifies a nuclear protein expressed in progenitor cells prior to differentiation. Transformation with the cDNA prevents progenitor cell death and allows the events that generate the eye to proceed. eya activity is required for the survival of eye progenitor cells at a critical stage in morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2052438035,"In transgenic mice, self-reactive B lymphocytes are eliminated if they encounter membrane-bound self antigens during their development within the bone marrow. We show here that two separate and sequential events, arrested development and cell death, bring about B cell elimination. Developmental arrest is an early outcome of antigen binding in immature B cells, blocks acquisition of adhesion molecules and receptors important for B cell migration and activation, and is rapidly reversible by removal of antigen. Death of the arrested B cells occurs within 1 to 3 days and can be delayed by expression of a bcl-2 transgene, which results in escape of large numbers of self-reactive B cells from the bone marrow but fails to override the developmental arrest. These findings define a novel pathway for B cell elimination, involving an initial stage vulnerable to breakdown in autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W2004219852,"A proportion of developing oligodendrocytes undergo natural cell death by apoptosis, and mature oligodendrocytes die, either by apoptosis or necrosis, in response to injurious signals such as cytotoxic cytokines and complement. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), a trophic factor found in astrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS), promoted the survival and maturation of cultured oligodendrocytes. This trophic factor also protected oligodendrocytes from death induced by tumor necrosis factors (apoptosis) but not against complement (necrosis). These results suggest that CNTF functions in the survival of oligodendrocytes during development and may lead to therapeutic approaches for degenerative diseases of the CNS that involve oligodendrocyte destruction."
https://openalex.org/W2090951806,"We have generated temperature-sensitive lethal point mutations in the small nucleolar RNA-associated protein fibrillarin (encoded by the NOP1 gene in yeast) and analyzed their effects on ribosome synthesis. The five alleles tested all prevent synthesis of normal ribosomes, but in dramatically different ways. At the non-permissive temperature, the nop1.2 and nop1.5 alleles prevent synthesis of both 18S and 25S rRNA and all pre-rRNA species except the 35S primary transcript. In contrast, the nop1.3, nop1.4, and nop1.7 alleles do not strongly impair processing. In nop1.3 strains, nucleolar methylation of pre-rRNA is strongly inhibited; late, cytoplasmic methylation of 18S rRNA and tRNA methylation continue. The nop1.4 and nop1.7 alleles result in the synthesis of cytoplasmic 60S ribosomal subunits with strongly aberrant mobilities on sucrose gradients even at the permissive temperature, owing to the impairment of a late step in ribosome assembly. Thus, all major posttranscriptional activities in ribosome synthesis, pre-rRNA processing, pre-rRNA modification, and ribosome assembly are dependent on fibrillarin."
https://openalex.org/W2056571800,"Nonsense mutations create a premature signal for the termination of translation of messenger RNA. Such mutations have been observed to cause a severe reduction in the amount of mutant allele transcript or to generate a peptide truncated at the carboxyl end. Analysis of fibrillin transcript from a patient with Marfan syndrome revealed the skipping of a constitutive exon containing a nonsense mutation. Similar results were observed for two nonsense mutations in the gene encoding ornithine delta-aminotransferase from patients with gyrate atrophy. All genomic DNA sequences flanking these exons that are known to influence RNA splicing were unaltered, which suggests that nonsense mutations can alter splice site selection in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2025336339,"Introduction of TCR alpha transgene, TCR beta transgene, or both into RAG-2-/-mice differentially rescues T cell development. RAG-2-/- mice have small numbers of TCR-CD4-CD8-(double negative, DN) thymocytes that express CD3 gamma delta epsilon and zeta proteins intracellularly. Introduction of a TCR beta transgene, but not a TCR alpha transgene, into the RAG-2-/- background restored normal numbers of thymocytes. These cells were CD4+CD8+ (double positive, DP) and expressed small amounts of surface TCR beta chain dimers in association with CD3 gamma delta epsilon but not zeta. RAG-2-/- mice that expressed alpha and beta TCR transgenes developed both DP and single positive thymocytes. Thus, the TCR beta subunit, possibly in association with a novel CD3 complex, participates in the DN to the DP transition."
https://openalex.org/W2079439973,"Geographic expansions are caused by successful innovations, biological or cultural, that favor local growth and movement. They have had a powerful effect in determining the present patterns of human genetic geography. Modern human populations expanded rapidly across the Earth in the last 100,000 years. At the end of the Paleolithic (10,000 years ago) only a few islands and other areas were unoccupied. The number of inhabitants was then about one thousand times smaller than it is now. Population densities were low throughout the Paleolithic, and random genetic drift was therefore especially effective. Major genetic differences between living human groups must have evolved at that time. Population growths that began afterward, especially with the spread of agriculture, progressively reduced the drift in population and the resulting genetic differentiation. Genetic traces of the expansions that these growths determined are still recognizable."

https://openalex.org/W2068372836,"The phosphocarrier protein IIIGlc is an integral component of the bacterial phosphotransferase (PTS) system. Unphosphorylated IIIGlc inhibits non-PTS carbohydrate transport systems by binding to diverse target proteins. The crystal structure at 2.6 A resolution of one of the targets, glycerol kinase (GK), in complex with unphosphorylated IIIGlc, glycerol, and adenosine diphosphate was determined. GK contains a region that is topologically identical to the adenosine triphosphate binding domains of hexokinase, the 70-kD heat shock cognate, and actin. IIIGlc binds far from the catalytic site of GK, indicating that long-range conformational changes mediate the inhibition of GK by IIIGlc. GK and IIIGlc are bound by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, with only one hydrogen bond involving an uncharged group. The phosphorylation site of IIIGlc, His90, is buried in a hydrophobic environment formed by the active site region of IIIGlc and a 3(10) helix of GK, suggesting that phosphorylation prevents IIIGlc binding to GK by directly disrupting protein-protein interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2017033865,"Recoverin, a calcium ion (Ca2+)-binding protein of vertebrate photoreceptors, binds to photoreceptor membranes when the Ca2+ concentration is greater than 1 micromolar. This interaction requires a fatty acyl residue covalently linked to the recoverin amino (NH2)-terminus. Removal of the acyl residue, either by proteolytic cleavage of the NH2-terminus or by production of nonacylated recoverin, prevented recoverin from binding to membranes. The acylated recoverin NH2-terminus could be cleaved by trypsin only when Ca2+ was bound to recoverin. These results suggest that the hydrophobic NH2-terminus is constrained in Ca(2+)-free recoverin and liberated by Ca2+ binding. The hydrophobic acyl moiety of recoverin may interact with the membrane only when recoverin binds Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W2063821036,"A high-temperature superconducting-receiver system for use in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) microscopy is described. The scaling behavior of sources of sample and receiver-coil noise is analyzed, and it is demonstrated that Johnson, or thermal, noise in the receiver coil is the factor that limits resolution. The behavior of superconductors in the environment of an NMR experiment is examined, and a prototypical system for imaging biological specimens is discussed. Preliminary spin-echo images are shown, and the ultimate limits of the signal-to-noise ratio of the probe are investigated."

https://openalex.org/W1523162832,"The macrolide rapamycin (RAP) is a potent inhibitor of interleukin-2 (IL-2)-induced T-cell proliferation. Current models suggest that RAP, when complexed to its intracellular receptor, FK506-binding protein, interferes with an IL-2 receptor-coupled signaling pathway required for cell-cycle progression from G1- to S-phase. Here we show that RAP treatment inhibits the growth of an IL-2-dependent cytotoxic T-cell line, CTLL-2, in late G1-phase, just prior to entry of the cells into S-phase. In contrast, RAP-treated CTLL-2 cells retained the ability to respond to IL-2 with enhanced cytolytic activity, indicating that RAP was not a general suppressant of cellular responsiveness to IL-2. Subsequent studies revealed that IL-2 stimulation triggered a delayed activation of the p34cdc2 kinase, the timing of which correlated with the G1- to S-phase transition. The IL-2-dependent increase in p34cdc2 kinase activity was blocked by RAP. The RAP sensitivity of the p34cdc2 activation mechanism implicates this signaling pathway in the control of S-phase commitment in IL-2-stimulated T-cells."

https://openalex.org/W1502744256,"The 150-kDa phospholipase C (PLC)-beta 1 and three immunologically related proteins with molecular sizes of 140, 100, and 45 kDa were purified from bovine brain extracts. Determination of the amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the 45-kDa protein and immunoblots of the purified proteins with sequence-specific antibodies to peptides corresponding to three different regions of PLC-beta 1 suggest that a single cleavage at the linkage between amino acid residues 880 and 881 of PLC-beta 1 generates the 100- and 45-kDa proteins, which correspond to the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal portions, respectively, of PLC-beta 1. The Ca(2+)-dependent protease calpain appears to be responsible for the cleavage of PLC-beta 1; the PLC-beta 1 amino acid sequence contains PEST sequences which are common to proteins susceptible to calpain, and limited proteolysis of purified PLC-beta 1 by calpain generated a 100-kDa protein and a 40-kDa protein that contains the same amino-terminal sequence as the 45-kDa protein. The 140-kDa protein lacks the carboxyl-terminal-most region of PLC-beta 1, but there is no evidence it is derived from PLC-beta 1 by proteolysis. Cleavage of PLC-beta 1 by calpain had no significant effect on catalytic activity measured in the absence of the alpha subunit of the G alpha q but completely abrogated the stimulatory effect of G alpha q. On the other hand, G alpha q activated the 140-kDa enzyme. These results suggest that the region between residue 881 and the most carboxyl-terminal 10 kDa of PLC-beta 1 contains the G alpha q interaction site."

https://openalex.org/W2039837364,"Ras proteins undergo a series of posttranslational modifications that are critical for their cellular function. These modifications are necessary to anchor Ras proteins to the membrane. Yeast Ras2 proteins were purified with various degrees of modification and examined for their ability to activate their effector, adenylyl cyclase. The farnesylated intermediate form of Ras2 had more than 100 times higher affinity for adenylyl cyclase than for the unprocessed form. The subsequent palmitoylation reaction had little effect. In contrast, palmitoylation was required for efficient membrane localization of the Ras2 protein. These results indicate the importance of farnesylation in the interaction of Ras2 with its effector."

https://openalex.org/W2088000250,"Mutations in Ras protein at positions Gly12 and Gly13 (phosphate-binding loop L1) and at positions Ala59, Gly60, and Gln61 (loop L4) are commonly associated with oncogenic activation. The structural and catalytic roles of these residues were probed with a series of unnatural amino acids that have unusual main chain conformations, hydrogen bonding abilities, and steric features. The properties of wild-type and transforming Ras proteins previously thought to be uniquely associated with the structure of a single amino acid at these positions were retained by mutants that contained a variety of unnatural amino acids. This expanded set of functional mutants provides new insight into the role of loop L4 residues in switch function and suggests that loop L1 may participate in the activation of Ras protein by effector molecules."

https://openalex.org/W2009208130,"Neural crest cell interactions with extracellular matrix molecules were analyzed with the use of antisense oligonucleotides to block synthesis of integrin subunits. When added to the culture medium of quail neural crest cells, selected antisense phosphorothiol oligonucleotides reduced the amounts of cell surface alpha 1 or beta 1 integrin subunits by up to 95 percent and inhibited neural crest cell attachment to laminin or fibronectin substrata. Differential effects on specific alpha integrins were noted after treatment with alpha-specific oligonucleotides. Cells recovered the ability to bind to substrata 8 to 16 hours after treatment with inhibitory oligonucleotides. The operation of at least three distinct alpha integrin subunits is indicated by substratum-selective inhibition of cell attachment."

https://openalex.org/W1980394440,"Melanoma formation in the teleost Xiphophorus is caused by a dominant genetic locus, Tu. This locus includes the Xmrk oncogene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase. Tumor induction is suppressed in wild-type fish by a tumor suppressor locus, R. Molecular genetic analyses revealed that the Tu locus emerged by nonhomologous recombination of the Xmrk proto-oncogene with a previously uncharacterized sequence, D. This event generated an additional copy of Xmrk with a new promoter. Suppression of the new Xmrk promoter by R in parental fish and its deregulation in hybrids explain the genetics of melanoma formation in Xiphophorus."
https://openalex.org/W2078359063,"Crystals of bovine trypsin were acylated at the reactive residue, serine 195, to form the transiently stable p-guanidinobenzoate. Hydrolysis of this species was triggered in the crystals by a jump in pH. The hydrolysis was monitored by three-dimensional Laue crystallography, resulting in three x-ray diffraction structures, all from the same crystal and each representing approximately 5 seconds of x-ray exposure. The structures were analyzed at a nominal resolution of 1.8 angstroms and were of sufficient quality to reproduce subtle features in the electron-density maps for each of the structures. Comparison of the structures before and after the pH jump reveals that a water molecule has positioned itself to attack the acyl group in the initial step of the hydrolysis of this transient intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1600891448,"The clotting protease thrombin might contribute to cell damage following brain injury by its ability to retract processes on neurons and astrocytes. Protease nexin-1 (PN-1), a potent inhibitor of thrombin, is localized around cerebral blood vessels where it may protect these cells from extravasated thrombin during injury or alteration of the blood-brain barrier. Here we examined the effects of several injury-related factors on the regulation of PN-1 in cultured brain cells. Interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and transforming growth factor-beta stimulated the secretion of PN-1 by the neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH. This cell line comprises both neuronal and glial cells. Analyses using cloned derivatives of these two cell types showed that PN-1 was secreted by the glial cells; PN-1 secretion was stimulated 90-fold by interleukin-1, 15-fold by tumor necrosis factor-alpha, 10-fold by tumor growth factor-beta, and 4-fold by platelet-derived growth factor. Measurements of newly synthesised PN-1 demonstrated that these factors produced an equivalent stimulation of PN-1 synthesis. The neuronal cells secreted two thrombin-binding proteins distinct from PN-1. Interactions between these two cell types regulated the secretion of PN-1 and the two thrombin-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2164687691,"Myc and other basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (b-HLH-ZIP) proteins bind the sequence CACGTG. Exhaustive mutagenesis in the basic domain identified four amino acids critical for DNA binding with spacing suggestive of an alpha-helical face. Surprisingly, two highly conserved amino acids were nonessential for DNA binding. Circular dichroism demonstrated a DNA-induced alpha-helical transition. A series of analogs were constructed with multiple simultaneous alanine substitutions at nonessential positions and a critical lysine for arginine substitution. In this way 35-fold higher specific affinity for CACGTG was obtained as compared with the basic domain of c-Myc. These b-HLH-ZIP proteins appear to bind the same palindromic sequence and may compete for common sites in vivo. Additionally, a C-terminal basic region clamp motif was identified that was also identifiable in crystal structures from several different families of DNA-binding factors."
https://openalex.org/W1552150952,"Hepatocytes were established in tissue culture in order to study the effects of pertussis toxin (PT) on epidermal growth factor (EGF)-mediated cellular responses under in vitro conditions. EGF caused a 3-fold increase of myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3) mass and a 50% increase of diacylglycerol mass within the first minute, with the change of diacylglycerol content being 100-fold greater than that of Ins-1,4,5-P3. Diacylglycerol, but not Ins-1,4,5-P3, continued to accumulate over several hours, indicating that EGF increased the hydrolysis of lipids other than phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). EGF increased phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma) tyrosine phosphorylation within 1 min, but no effect was observed with vasopressin, insulin, or glucagon after 5 min. EGF also caused a rapid, tyrosine kinase-dependent association of G(i) alpha with PLC-gamma, which was maximal within 10 min. In contrast to our previous data on fresh hepatocytes, PT had no effect on the EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma, although Ins-1,4,5-P3 and diacylglycerol production were inhibited. The role of G-proteins in EGF signaling was investigated further by microinjection of G alpha antibodies into single fura-2-loaded hepatocytes. Anti-G(i) alpha (common) antibodies prevented EGF-induced but not vasopressin-induced Ca2+ transients. These results strengthen previous observations that a PT-sensitive G-protein is involved in EGF-mediated phospholipid metabolism in hepatocytes and show that tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma is an insufficient signal for activation of PIP2 hydrolysis."

https://openalex.org/W1992103948,"sdc-3 is an early-acting regulatory gene that controls both sex determination and X chromosome dosage compensation in C. elegans. It is unique among sdc genes in that its sex determination and dosage compensation functions act independently. The molecular analysis reported here demonstrates that separate domains of the Sdc-3 protein control these two developmental processes. Sequence analysis of 16 sdc-3 alleles reveals that the dosage compensation mutations specifically eliminate a pair of zinc finger motifs at the carboxyl terminus of Sdc-3, while the sex determination mutations alter a region with limited homology to the ATP-binding domain of myosin. Null mutations, which disrupt both processes, abort translation of Sdc-3 prior to both domains. Analysis of site-directed changes confirms the functional significance of the two separate regions in sex determination and dosage compensation and reveals that an additional region, undetected by genetic analysis, is also required for proper dosage compensation."

https://openalex.org/W1586203765,"Brefeldin A (BFA) inhibits protein secretion, collapses the Golgi complex into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), causes redistribution of processing enzymes normally resident in the Golgi to the ER, and uncouples the proximal and distal regions of the secretory pathway. We used BFA to determine where intracellular degradation of newly synthesized collagen degradation occurs. In normal human fetal lung fibroblasts, BFA (50 ng/ml) completely blocked collagen secretion and reduced collagen production by two-thirds. In cells synthesizing collagen under normal conditions, intracellular degradation was about 16%; BFA (50 ng/ml) reduced degradation to less than 5%. In cells induced to synthesize structurally abnormal collagen (by incubation with the proline analog cis-hydroxyproline), degradation was approximately 33%; BFA reduced this level to less than 10%. When the y axes were scaled appropriately, the dose-response curves for collagen degradation +/- cis-hydroxyproline versus BFA concentration coincided. A pulse-chase experiment demonstrated that BFA did not inhibit hydroxylation of prolyl residues, a major posttranslational modification of collagen that occurs in the ER, and that inhibition of degradation was independent of inhibition of collagen synthesis. Immunofluorescence examination revealed that BFA redistributed Golgi glycoproteins to the ER. At the ultrastructural level, Golgi complex could not be found in fibroblasts exposed to BFA for 1 h; however, clusters of small vesicles were observed. A different structure, comprising one or two lamellae and resembling a partial Golgi complex, was observed in cells incubated with BFA for 6 h. This structure was adjacent to ER but far from the nucleus. In addition, the ER was devoid of ribosomes. The inhibition of intracellular collagen degradation by BFA indicates that collagen degradation does not occur in the ER. Rather, it suggests that collagen degradation occurs beyond the BFA block, perhaps in the trans-Golgi network."
https://openalex.org/W1579144998,"Certain isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC) require both Ca2+ and phospholipid for optimum activity. However, little is known about the nature of the interaction between PKC and Ca2+. The present study demonstrates that the isolated regulatory domain of PKC beta 1, when synthesized as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli, binds 45Ca2+ with high affinity, but only in the presence of phosphatidylserine or 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate. This binding is highly selective for Ca2+ since it is preferentially inhibited by excess non-radioactive Ca2+ when compared with the cations Mg2+, Mn2+, Na+, or K+. It appears, therefore, that the binding of Ca2+ to PKC requires a complex tertiary structure in the regulatory domain."
https://openalex.org/W1572727169,"The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of low density lipoprotein (LDL) on Ca2+ transients of isolated rabbit cardiomyocytes. Incubation of cardiomyocytes with > or = 1 mg of LDL cholesterol/ml of perfusion medium induced a slow (> or = 30 min) but significant increase (2-fold) in the cellular Ca2+ transient. The time course for the effect was similar to that observed for the accumulation of cholesterol in the cells. Using Dil- labeled LDL as a fluorescent marker for LDL interaction with the cardiomyocytes, it was concluded that LDL interacted via a receptor-mediated event, but probably this was not the primary mechanism whereby the lipid entered the cell. LDL-treated cells were resistant to the depressant actions for ryanodine, nicardipine, and dichlorobenzamil on the cellular Ca2+ transient. Lowering the extracellular Ca2+ concentration removed the stimulatory effect of LDL on the Ca2+ transient. It is concluded that LDL can induce an increase in the magnitude of the Ca2+ transient in isolated cardiomyocytes. This is a relatively slow process. The mechanism appears to involve a stimulation of a transsarcolemmal Ca2+ transport pathway. These findings have important implications for cardiac contractile function in hypercholesterolemic and drug-treated hypercholesterolemic subjects."
