From psychophysical evidence that covert attention affects early vision-it enhances contrast sensitivity and spatial resolution-and from neurophysiological evidence that attention increases the neuronal contrast sensitivity (contrast gain), one could infer that attention changes stimulus appearance. Surprisingly, few studies have directly investigated this issue. Here we developed a psychophysical method to directly assess the phenomenological correlates of attention in humans. We show that attention alters appearance; it boosts the apparent stimulus contrast. These behavioral results are consistent with neurophysiological findings suggesting that attention changes the strength of a stimulus by increasing its 'effective contrast' or salience."

https://openalex.org/W2074013605,"We report atomic-scale characterization of the pseudogap state in a high- T c superconductor, Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+δ . The electronic states at low energies within the pseudogap exhibit spatial modulations having an energy-independent incommensurate periodicity. These patterns, which are oriented along the copper-oxygen bond directions, appear to be a consequence of an electronic ordering phenomenon, the observation of which correlates with the pseudogap in the density of electronic states. Our results provide a stringent test for various ordering scenarios in the cuprates, which have been central in the debate on the nature of the pseudogap and the complex electronic phase diagram of these compounds."

Previously, we reported that TLR4 activation is reciprocally modulated by saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids in macrophages. However, it is not known whether fatty acids can modulate the activation of TLR2 or other TLRs for which respective ligands do not require acylated fatty acids. A saturated fatty acid, lauric acid, induced NFκB activation when TLR2 was co-transfected with TLR1 or TLR6 in 293T cells, but not when TLR1, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 9 was transfected individually. An n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) suppressed NFκB activation and cyclooxygenase-2 expression induced by the agonist for TLR2, 3, 4, 5, or 9 in a macrophage cell line (RAW264.7). Because dimerization is considered one of the potential mechanisms for the activation of TLR2 and TLR4, we determined whether the fatty acids modulate the dimerization. However, neither lauric acid nor DHA affected the heterodimerization of TLR2 with TLR6 as well as the homodimerization of TLR4 as determined by co-immunoprecipitation assays in 293T cells in which these TLRs were transiently overexpressed. Together, these results demonstrate that lauric acid activates TLR2 dimers as well as TLR4 for which respective bacterial agonists require acylated fatty acids, whereas DHA inhibits the activation of all TLRs tested. Thus, responsiveness of different cell types and tissues to saturated fatty acids would depend on the expression of TLR4 or TLR2 with either TLR1 or TLR6. These results also suggest that inflammatory responses induced by the activation of TLRs can be differentially modulated by types of dietary fatty acids.

The activation of TLRs by agonists recruits an adaptor molecule, MyD88, and initiates the activation of downstream signaling cascades leading to the activation of NFκB and mitogen-activated protein kinase and the expression of inflammatory gene products, including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), cytokines, and chemokines (2Barton G.M.

The activation of diacylated mycoplasmal lipopeptides, macrophage-activating lipopeptide 2-kDa (MALP-2), requires TLR2 dimerized with TLR6 to induce cytokine production, whereas the activation of TLR2 by triacylated bacterial lipopeptides requires the dimerization with TLR1 (15Takeuchi O.

The saturated fatty acid moieties acylated in LPS and lipopeptides are critical for ligand recognition and receptor activation for TLR4 and TLR2. Deacylated LPS loses its endotoxic activity (17Munford R.S. Hall C.L. Science. 1986; 234: 203-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 18Kitchens R.L. Ulevitch R.J. Munford R.S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and the deacylated bacterial lipoproteins are unable to activate TLR2 and to induce cytokine expression in monocytes (19Brightbill H.D.

Furthermore, LPS-containing unsaturated fatty acids is also inactive and acts as an antagonist against native LPS (20Krauss J.H. Seydel U. Weckesser J. Mayer H. Eur. J.

Broadly, TLR agonists can activate two different downstream signaling pathways that are MyD88-dependent and -independent, leading to differential target gene expression and cellular responses. TLR2 and TLR9 induce NFκB activation and cytokine production through MyD88-dependent signaling pathways (22Takeuchi O. Kaufmann A. Grote K. Kawai T. Hoshino K. Morr M. Muhlradt P.F. Akira S. J.

The stimulation of TLR4 triggers the activation of both MyD88-dependent and -independent signaling pathways. The activation of TLR3 is known to stimulate primarily MyD88-independent signaling pathway. Toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF)/TIR-domain-containing adaptor molecule (TI-CAM)-1 is an adaptor molecule responsible for activation of MyD88-independent pathways leading to the activation of IRF3 and the expression of IFNβ (25Fitzgerald K.A.

Recently, it was reported that a new adaptor, TRIF-related adaptor molecule, interacts specifically with TRIF in an MyD88-independent pathway derived from the activation of TLR4, but not TLR3 (28Fitzgerald K.A. Rowe D.C. Barnes B.J. Caffrey D.R. Visintin A. Latz E. Monks B. Pitha P.M. Golenbock D.T. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1043-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 29Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H.

Results from our previous studies demonstrated that saturated and unsaturated fatty acids reciprocally modulate MyD88-dependent signaling pathways and target gene expression, including COX-2 derived from TLR4 activation (12Lee J.Y.

However, it is not known whether fatty acids also modulated MyD88-independent signaling pathways. The results from our previous studies showed that unsaturated fatty acids also suppressed NFκB activation and COX-2 expression induced by TLR2 agonist, a synthetic lipopeptide (PamCAG), in macrophages (30Lee J.Y. Plakidas A. Lee W.H. Heikkinen A. Chanmugam P. Bray G. Hwang D.H. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 479-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In addition, saturated fatty acid potentiated TLR2 agonist-induced NFκB activation and COX-2 expression in macrophages (30Lee J.Y. Plakidas A. Lee W.H. Heikkinen A. Chanmugam P. Bray G. Hwang D.H. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 479-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). However, it remained to be determined whether the potentiation by the saturated fatty acid was mediated through the direct activation of TLR2. Moreover, it is not known whether fatty acids modulate the activation of other TLRs for which cognate ligands are not acylated by fatty acids. TLR4 homodimerizes whereas TLR2 heterodimerizes with TLR6 or TLR1 (14Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Fontenot J.D. Hajjar A.M. Smith K.D. Wilson C.B. Schroeder L. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Forced dimerization of TLR4 or TLR2 can lead to the activation of the downstream signaling pathways and target gene expression (1Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway Jr., C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4416) Google Scholar, 14Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Fontenot J.D. Hajjar A.M. Smith K.D. Wilson C.B. Schroeder L. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

These results suggest that the dimerization may be one of the initial steps for the activation of TLR2 or TLR4. Therefore, in this study, we investigated whether the activation of TLRs other than TLR4 and MyD88-independent signaling pathways are modulated by fatty acids and whether the dimerization of TLR4 or TLR2 is affected by different types of fatty acids.

Plasmids—pDisplay-FLAG-tagged TLR6 was prepared as follows: First, pDisplay-FLAG-tagged vector was obtained by the modification of pDisplay-HA-tagged vector (Invitrogen). A HindIII/BglII fragment in pDisplay-HA-tagged vector was replaced with a PCR product containing the coding sequence for FLAG peptide (KDDDDKYD), generated by the primers as follows: forward primer, 5′-CTATAGGGAGACCCAAGCTTGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GCGAGATCTCTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATCGTCACCAGTGGAACCTGGAAC-3′.

Preparation of Bone Marrow-derived Macrophages and Measurement of Prostaglandin E2 Production—Wild type (C3H/HeOUJ) and TLR4-mutant (C3H/HeJ) mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Bone marrow cells isolated from femur were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm Na+ pyruvate, 10 mm Hepes buffer, and 20% L929 cell-conditioned medium for 6 days, and adherent cells were used as macrophages. After treatment with lauric acid or docosahexaenoic acid in the absence or presence of LPS to bone marrow-derived macrophages, the levels of PGE2 in the culture medium were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Real-time RT-PCR Analysis of COX-2 Expression in Mouse Bone Marrow-derived Macrophages—Bone marrow-derived macrophages from wild type (C3H/HeOUJ) and TLR4-mutant (C3H/HeJ) mice were treated with lauric acid, docosahexaenoic acid, or LPS for 4 h. Total RNAs were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Five micrograms of total RNAs were used for cDNA synthesis with the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with a LightCycler (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using the LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit. The primers used to detect mouse COX-2 are as follows: forward primer, 5′-ACACTCTATCACTGGCACCC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GAAGGGACACCCCTTCACAT-3′ generating the amplified PCR product of 585 bp in length. The primers for mouse β-actin (used as an internal control) are as follows: forward primer, 5′-TCATGAAGTGTGACGTTGACATCCGT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CCTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGCACGATG-3′ generating the PCR product of 285 bp in length. The following program was used: denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min and 40 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 s, annealing at 60 °C for 5 s, and extension at 72 °C for 25 s. The quality and specificity of the amplified PCR products were assessed by performing a melting curve analysis and a conventional RT-PCR followed by agarose gel analysis. Samples were compared using the relative crossing-point value (Cp) method. The Cp value, which is inversely proportional to the initial template copy number, was determined by the LightCycler software program provided by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The -fold induction of COX-2 expression by real-time PCR was measured three times in duplicate relative to vehicle control and calculated after adjusting for β-actin using 2ΔΔCp, where ΔCp = Cpβ-actin – CpCOX-2, and ΔΔCp =ΔCp treatment – ΔCp control.

Briefly, RAW264.7 or 293T cells were co-transfected with a luciferase plasmid containing NFκB(2×)-binding site, murine COX-2 promoter (–3.2 kb), or inducible nitric-oxide synthase promoter, and HSP70-β-galactosidase plasmid as an internal control using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SW620 cells were transfected with an IL-8 promoter-luciferase plasmid. Various expression plasmids or corresponding empty vector plasmids for signaling components were co-transfected. The total amount of transfected plasmids was equalized by supplementing with the corresponding empty vector to eliminate the experimental error from transfection itself. Luciferase and β-galactosidase enzyme activities were determined using the Luciferase Assay System and β-galactosidase Enzyme System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was normalized by β-galactosidase activity to correct the transfection efficiency. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—These were performed essentially the same as previously described (8Rhee S.H. Hwang D. J. Biol.

After 24 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5) and lysed for 30 min on ice in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium metabisulfite, 1 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g, 4 °C for 15 min. Supernatants were incubated with 1 μg of HA antibody (12CA5) for 4 h and further incubated with 70 μl of 50% (v/v) protein A-agarose (Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL) for overnight at 4 °C with rocking. Immune complexes were solubilized with Laemmli sample buffer after five times of washing with lysis buffer. The samples were fractionated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk and were blotted with the indicated antibodies. The reactive bands were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences).

Reciprocal Modulation of COX-2 Expression by Saturated and Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid in Bone Marrow-derived Macrophages Isolated from Wild-type and TLR4-mutant Mice—Results from our previous studies demonstrate that saturated fatty acid induces the activation of both endogenous and ectopically expressed TLR4 in macrophages (RAW264.7) and 293T cells, respectively, leading to NFκB activation and COX-2 expression (12Lee J.Y.

https://openalex.org/W2169847792,"Engendering cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses is likely to be an important goal of HIV vaccines. However, CTLs select for viral variants that escape immune detection. Maintenance of such escape variants in human populations could pose an obstacle to HIV vaccine development. We first observed that escape mutations in a heterogeneous simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) isolate were lost upon passage to new animals. We therefore infected macaques with a cloned SIV bearing escape mutations in three immunodominant CTL epitopes, and followed viral evolution after infection. Here we show that each mutant epitope sequence continued to evolve in vivo, often re-establishing the original, CTL-susceptible sequence. We conclude that escape from CTL responses may exact a cost to viral fitness. In the absence of selective pressure upon transmission to new hosts, these original escape mutations can be lost. This suggests that some HIV CTL epitopes will be maintained in human populations."

In vitro study suggests that this noncollagen acidic phosphoprotein plays a role in mineralization. However, deletion of the Dmp-1 gene has little effect on tooth development during embryogenesis. To address the role of DMP-1 in tooth during postnatal development, we analyzed changes of dentinogenesis in Dmp-1 null mice from 3 days after birth to 1 year. Here we show that Dmp-1 null mice postnatally develop a profound tooth phenotype characterized by a partial failure of maturation of predentin into dentin, enlarged pulp chambers, increased width of predentin zone with reduced dentin wall, and hypomineralization. The tooth phenotype of these mice is strikingly similar to that in dentin sialophosphoprotein (Dspp) null mice and shares some features of the human disease dentinogenesis imperfecta III. We have also demonstrated that DSPP levels are reduced in Dmp-1 null mice, suggesting that DSPP is probably regulated by DMP-1 during dentinogenesis. Finally, we show the absence or delayed development of the third molar in Dmp-1 null mice, which is probably secondary to defects in Dmp-1 null bone.

Taken together, these studies suggest that DMP-1 is essential for later dentinogenesis during postnatal development. Dentin is a mineralized tissue that closely resembles bone in composition and mechanism of formation. The mechanisms for mineralization are largely unclear, although two hypotheses are proposed to explain initiating mineralization: matrix vesicles in mantle dentin and collagen-phosphophoryn complexes in circumpulpal dentin (1Garant P.R. Dickson A. Oral Cells and Tissues. Quintessence Publishing, Chicago, IL2003: 25-52Google Scholar). The in vitro studies also suggest that phosphorylated extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; DMP, dentin matrix protein; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; RT, reverse transcriptase; micro-CT, micro-computed tomography. 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; DMP, dentin matrix protein; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; RT, reverse transcriptase; micro-CT, micro-computed tomography. proteins localized within collagen gap zones can bind calcium and phosphate ions in an appropriate conformation to nucleate the formation of apatite crystals (2Hunter G.K.

One of the noncollagenous proteins that appears to play an important role in dentin ECM formation and mineralization is dentin matrix protein-1 (DMP-1). DMP-1, an acidic phosphorylated extracellular matrix protein (4George A. Sabsay B. Simonian P.A. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-12630Google Scholar), is expressed in odontoblasts that secrete matrix proteins to form dentin. Using protein chemistry approaches, some progress has been made in identifying the normally processed forms of DMP-1 in mineralized tissues (5Qin C. Brunn J.C. Cook R.G. Orkiszewski R.S. Malone J.P. Veis A. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34700-34708Google Scholar). Although full-length DMP-1 has been cloned and sequenced, the corresponding intact protein has not been isolated from mineralized tissues. However, two proteolytic fragments, a 37-kDa N-terminal fragment and a 57-kDa C-terminal fragment, have been isolated from bone and dentin extracts (5Qin C. Brunn J.C. Cook R.G. Orkiszewski R.S. Malone J.P. Veis A. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34700-34708Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that DMP-1 can be cleaved by bone morphogenetic protein-1/tolloid-like proteinases (6Steiglitz B.M. Ayala M. Narayanan K. George A. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 980-986Google Scholar). In vitro studies suggest that overexpression of Dmp-1 induces differentiation of mesenchymal cells to odontoblast-like cells and enhances mineralization (7Narayanan K. Srinivas R. Ramachandran A. Hao J. Quinn B. George A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4516-4521Google Scholar) and that DMP-1 can bind to Ca2+ and initiate mineral deposition in vitro (8He G. Dahl T. Veis A. George A. Nat. Mater. 2003; 2: 552-558Google Scholar). However, effects of recombinant DMP-1 on in vitro mineralization are controversial and depend on the phosphorylation status of DMP-1. 2Tartaix, P. H., Doulaverakis, M., George, A., Fisher, L. W., Butler, W. T., Qin, C., Salih, E., Tan, M., Fujimoto, Y., Spevak, L., and Boskey, A. L. (February 9, 2004) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M314114200. 2Tartaix, P. H., Doulaverakis, M., George, A., Fisher, L. W., Butler, W. T., Qin, C., Salih, E., Tan, M., Fujimoto, Y., Spevak, L., and Boskey, A. L. (February 9, 2004) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M314114200. In addition, ectopic application of the recombinant DMP-1 showed no apparent effect on mineralization (9Hassan A.H. Evans C.A. Zaki A.M. George A. Connect. Tissue Res. 2003; 44: 30-41Google Scholar). To determine the in vivo role of DMP-1 in dentinogenesis and mineralization, we have cloned and sequenced the Dmp-1 gene (GenBank™ accession number AJ242625) and have generated Dmp-1 null mice, in which exon 6 of Dmp-1 was replaced by a lacZ reporter gene and a neo-cassette (10Feng J.Q. Huang H. Lu Y. Ye L. Xie Y. Tsutsui T.W. Kunieda T. Castranio T. Scott G. Bonewald L.B. Mishina Y. J. Dent. Res. 2003; 82: 776-780Google Scholar). The expression of Dmp-1, reflected by X-gal staining, is not only identified in odontoblasts but also in pulpal cells, precursor cells of odontoblasts during embryonic development. However, there is no apparent early tooth phenotype observed in the Dmp-1 null embryos and newborns, suggesting that DMP-1 may be redundant or nonessential for early dentinogenesis and mineralization (10Feng J.Q. Huang H. Lu Y. Ye L. Xie Y. Tsutsui T.W. Kunieda T. Castranio T. Scott G. Bonewald L.B. Mishina Y. J. Dent. Res. 2003; 82: 776-780Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to determine whether DMP-1 is required for dentinogenesis and mineralization during postnatal development by characterization of the Dmp-1 lacZ knock-in mice from day 3 to 1 year old. Here we show that Dmp-1 null mice postnatally develop a profound tooth phenotype characterized by enlarged pulp chambers, increased width of predentin zone with reduced dentin thickness, and hypomineralization. The tooth phenotype of these mice is strikingly similar to dentin sialophosphoprotein (Dspp) null mice (11Sreenath T. Thyagarajan T. Hall B. Longenecker G. D'Souza R. Hong S. Wright J.T. MacDougall M. Sauk J. Kulkarni A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24874-24880Google Scholar) and shares some features of the human dentin disease dentinogenesis imperfecta III. In addition, we demonstrate that DSPP is reduced in Dmp-1 null mice, suggesting that DSPP could be directly or indirectly controlled by DMP-1 during dentinogenesis. Generation of Dmp-1 Null Mice—Mice deficient in Dmp-1 were generated by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells as described previously (10Feng J.Q. Huang H. Lu Y. Ye L. Xie Y. Tsutsui T.W. Kunieda T. Castranio T. Scott G. Bonewald L.B. Mishina Y. J. Dent. Res. 2003; 82: 776-780Google Scholar). To obtain Dmp-1-deficient teeth, heterozygous Dmp-1 null mice were interbred to generate homozygotes in the C57BL/6 background (>95%) or CD-1 outbred background in the expected Mendelian ratio. Males and females were both fertile. All experiments were performed using a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of University of Missouri-Kansas City and NIEHS, National Institutes of Health, laboratory animal facilities. Tail PCR Genotyping—Genotyping of Dmp-1 null mice was determined by PCR analysis of genomic DNA extracted from tail with primers p01 (5′-CTTGACTTCAGGCAAATAGTGACC-3′) and p02 (5′-GCGGAATTCGATAGCTTGGCTG-3′) to detect the targeted allele (280 bp) and primers p01 (5′-CTTGACTTCAGGCAAATAGTGACC-3′) and 5′-CTGTTCCTCACTCTCACTGTGC-3′ to detect the wild-type allele (410 bp). β-Galactosidase (lacZ) Expression Assay—β-Galactosidase staining was assessed from 5-week-old heterozygous jaw using the method described previously (12Zhang J. Tan X. Contag C.H. Lu Y. Guo D. Harris S.E. Feng J.Q. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 1412-1419Google Scholar). Briefly, mandibles were fixed by immersion in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min each. The specimens were then stained overnight in freshly prepared X-gal solution (1 mg/ml) at 32 °C, followed by refixation, decalcification, paraffin-embedding, sectioning, and counterstaining. In Situ Hybridization—The digoxigenin-labeled Dmp-1 cRNA probe from exon 6 was prepared by using an RNA Labeling Kit (Roche Applied Science). Preparation of a 0.6-kb mouse Dmp-1 RNA probe and in situ hybridization on paraffin sections were carried out essentially as described previously (13Feng J.Q. Zhang J. Dallas S.L. Lu Y. Chen S. Tan X. Owen M. Harris S.E. MacDougall M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1822-1831Google Scholar). Digoxigenin-labeled Dmp-1 probe was detected in an enzyme-linked immunoassay with a specific anti-digoxigenin-AP antibody conjugate and the color substrates nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate according to the manufacturer's instructions (14Thompson D.L. Sabbagh Y. Tenenhouse H.S. Roche P.C. Drezner M.K. Salisbury J.L. Grande J.P. Poeschla E.M. Kumar R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 311-320Google Scholar). Tooth Isolation and High Resolution Radiography—For better imaging of the teeth on radiographs, fresh mandibles dissected from wild-type and Dmp-1 null mice were incubated in lysis buffer (2× SSC, 0.2% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mg/ml Proteinase K) for 1-2 days, depending on the age of the mouse. After muscles surrounding teeth were digested, the mandibles were washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and molars were extracted using a dissection scope. Mandibles and isolated first molars were then examined on a Faxitron model MX-20 Specimen Radiography System with a digital camera attached (Faxitron x-ray Corp., Buffalo Grove, IL). Micro-computed Tomography (Micro-CT)—Three-dimensional images of 12-month molars from wild-type and Dmp-1 null mice were scanned with a compact fan beam-type tomograph, also referred to as micro-CT (Micro-CT 40; Scanco Medical AG, Bassersdorf, Switzerland). Images were reconstructed with EVS Beam software using a global threshold at 1400 Hounsfield units. Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy and Backscattered Scanning Electron Microscopy—Mandibles from control and Dmp-1 null mice were dissected and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer solution (pH 7.4) at room temperature for 4 h and then transferred to 0.1 m cacodylate buffer solution. After dehydration in ascending concentrations of ethanol, the first molars were fractured under a dissecting microscope and mounted on aluminum stubs with the fractured surface upward facing, sputter-coated with Au-Pd, and examined with field emission environmental scanning electron microscopy (Philips XL30; FEI Co.). Preparation of Histological Sections—Mandibles from control and Dmp-1 null mice were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight, followed by demineralization in 10% EDTA solution (Sigma) over 3 weeks and then dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 6-μm thickness. Immunohistochemistry—Immunostaining of DSPP (LF-153) and biglycan (LF-159) (15Fisher L.W. Stubbs III, J.T. Young M.F. Acta Orthop. Scand. Suppl. 1995; 266: 61-65Google Scholar) (both polyclonal antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Larry Fisher from NIDCR, National Institutes of Health) was performed on paraffin sections. After deparaffinization and rehydration, the sections were immersed in 3% H2O2 to quench endogenous peroxidase and further digested with 1 mg/ml trypsin for 30 min at 37 °C. Sections were then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin containing 1% goat serum at room temperature for 2 h. The rabbit anti-mouse DSPP or biglycan polyclonal antibody was added at a dilution of 1:1000 or 1:2000, respectively, in phosphate-buffered saline, and the sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing, sections were coated with biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at a dilution of 1:200 and then incubated at room temperature for 60 min. The sections were washed again and incubated with the ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories) at room temperature for 60 min. The 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate was used to visualize immunoreaction sites. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted on glass slides. Negative controls were obtained by substituting the primary antibody with rabbit serum. RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—Molars from 1-week-old wild-type and Dmp-1 null mice were collected under the dissecting microscope. RNA was extracted by using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen), and 30 cycles of RT-PCR were performed using SuperScript™ II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The oligonucleotide primers used in the study are the following: Dmp-1 forward (5′-CAGCCGTTCTGAGGAAGACAGTG-3′) and reverse (5′-CCTGCCCCTGGTTCTCCTTCTGA-3′); Dspp forward (5′-GGCATAATCAAAACACCGCTGC-3′) and reverse (5′-GGGGAAATAGGGAAATGACAAAGG-3′); and Gapdh forward (5′-ATGGAGAAGGCTGGGGCTC-3′) and reverse (5′-ACGGATACATTGGGGGTAG-3′). Expression Pattern of Dmp-1 in Odontoblast Layer during Development—To set the foundation for studies of DMP-1 function in dentinogenesis, the expression patterns of Dmp-1 in embryonic teeth were examined. With in situ hybridization, a Dmp-1 signal was observed in the odontoblast layer at E17.5 (Fig. 1A). In addition, a low level of Dmp-1 was noted in pulpal precursor cells of odontoblasts, as well as a transient Dmp-1 expression in the preameloblasts (Fig. 1A). Next we investigated whether Dmp-1 is expressed postnatally in teeth using the Dmp-1 lacZ knock-in mice where a lacZ neo-cassette was used to replace exon 6 of the Dmp-1 gene (10Feng J.Q. Huang H. Lu Y. Ye L. Xie Y. Tsutsui T.W. Kunieda T. Castranio T. Scott G. Bonewald L.B. Mishina Y. J. Dent. Res. 2003; 82: 776-780Google Scholar). The advantage of this approach is that lacZ expression reflects endogenous Dmp-1 activity, since this reporter gene is under the control of the endogenous Dmp-1 promoter (10Feng J.Q. Huang H. Lu Y. Ye L. Xie Y. Tsutsui T.W. Kunieda T. Castranio T. Scott G. Bonewald L.B. Mishina Y. J. Dent. Res. 2003; 82: 776-780Google Scholar). The homozygous mice carrying two copies of this transgene will be null for the Dmp-1 gene, which was used for studies of tooth phenotype in mice that lack the Dmp-1 gene (see below). The first molar of 5-week-old Dmp-1-lacZ heterozygous mouse was selected for tracking Dmp-1 expression. A strong Dmp-1 lacZ signal is detected in both odontoblast layer and odontoblast processes (Fig. 1, B-D). Dmp-1 Null Pups Display an Early Defect in Both Dentin and Enamel—Previously, we showed that Dmp-1 null embryos or newborns appeared grossly normal and could not be distinguished from control littermates by radiographs and histology (10Feng J.Q. Huang H. Lu Y. Ye L. Xie Y. Tsutsui T.W. Kunieda T. Castranio T. Scott G. Bonewald L.B. Mishina Y. J. Dent. Res. 2003; 82: 776-780Google Scholar). To determine the role of DMP-1 in postnatal tooth development, we examined the mineralization and morphogenesis of the Dmp-1 null teeth from birth to 1 year of age. To follow changes over time noninvasively, x-ray analysis and micro-CT were used. No differences were observed between wild-type and heterozygous mice, suggesting that loss of a single copy of the Dmp-1 gene or gain of a truncated DMP-1 protein has no effect on tooth development. However, qualitative differences between 3-day-old Dmp-1 null pups and their littermates were documented by radiographs and hematoxylin/eosin staining (Fig. 2). Mineral contents in Dmp-1 null teeth are decreased (Fig. 2A). The layers of predentin (newly formed unmineralized dentin matrix), dentin (mature mineralized dentin matrix), and enamel (the hardest of all mineralized tissues, formed by ameloblasts) were reduced in Dmp-1 null pups (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the mineral content in surrounding alveolar bone appears increased in the Dmp-1 null pup when compared with controls (Fig. 2B). Impaired Mineralization and Dentin Structure in Dmp-1 Null Mice during Postnatal Dentinogenesis—To address the in vivo roles of DMP-1 in mineralization of dentinogenesis, the first molars from the wild-type and Dmp-1 null mice were removed from the maxilla for radiograph examinations from 3 weeks to 12 months in age (Fig. 3). Overall, there is no apparent change in tooth shape and size between the wild-type and the Dmp-1 null mice, suggesting that DMP-1 has no effect on tooth pattern formation. The earliest change in mineralization was revealed by a reduction in thickness of the wall of tooth roots (Fig. 3A). By 1 month of age, the Dmp-1 null mice showed an increase in both the pulp chamber and the root canal (Fig. 3B). A similar change was also documented in Dmp-1 null molars at the ages of 3, 5, and 12 months (Fig. 3, C-E) and further confirmed by the micro-CT data (Fig. 3F). Next, we analyzed changes in mineralization and dentin structure using scanning electron microscopy and backscattered scanning electron microscopy that allows differentiated visualization of mineralized tissues. Normal dentin is characterized by the presence of numerous dentin tubules surrounded by a ring of hypermineralized peritubular dentin (Fig. 4, A and left panels of B and C). In contrast, little mineral was seen in the Dmp-1 null dentin (Fig. 4, B and C, right panels), suggesting that DMP-1 is required for mineralization during postnatal dentinogenesis. In addition, the dentin peritubular ultrastructure is poorly organized with an increased space. The normal smooth surface of the peritubular wall is replaced by a coarse and irregular dentin surface in Dmp-1 null mice (Fig. 4, B-D, right panels). It is not clear that the impaired matrix structure is the consequence or the cause of a defect in mineralization during dentinogenesis. Impaired Maturation of Predentin into Dentin in Dmp-1 Null Mice—During dentinogenesis, the first formed odontoblastic ECM is called predentin (a nonmineralized tissue), where mineral is later deposited and matured to dentin, a mature mineralized tissue. To better understand why increased pulp chambers and reduced dentin walls occurred in Dmp-1 null mice (Fig. 3), we did a series of histological analysis in both molar and incisors at different ages (Fig. 5). Hematoxylin/eosin-stained sections from 1-month first molars (Fig. 5A), 12-month first molars (Fig. 5B), and 3-month incisors (Fig. 5C) clearly show that the predentin zone is expanded, whereas the dentin zone is decreased in the Dmp-1 null mice compared with the controls. This may explain, in part, the increased volume of the pulp chamber and the root canal, as well as the reduced thickness of the dentin walls observed by radiographs (Fig. 3). In addition, we have also examined the enamel layer in Dmp-1 null mice, which is thinner compared with that in the control mice (Fig. 5C). Note that a low level of Dmp-1 is expressed by preameloblasts (Fig. 1A) that secret enamel ECM. The Level of DSPP, a Critical Molecule in Dentin, Is Reduced in Dmp-1 Null Mice—In addition to DMP-1, there is another important noncollagenous protein in dentin, DSPP (16MacDougall M. Simmons D. Luan X. Nydegger J. Feng J. Gu T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 835-842Google Scholar, 17Feng J.Q. Luan X. Wallace J. Jing D. Ohshima T. Kulkarni A.B. D'Souza R.N. Kozak C.A. MacDougall M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9457-9464Google Scholar). Both DMP-1 and DSPP are members of the SIBLING (small integrin-binding ligand N-linked glycoprotein) family of acidic, phosphorylated glycoproteins (18Fisher L.W. Torchia D.A. Fohr B. Young M.F. Fedarko N.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 460-465Google Scholar, 19Fedarko N.S. Fohr B. Robey P.G. Young M.F. Fisher L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16666-16672Google Scholar). They share a similar genomic structure and are located in the same region on the chromosome. Their amino acid properties are very similar, and both need to be processed further into N-terminal and C-terminal fragments (5Qin C. Brunn J.C. Cook R.G. Orkiszewski R.S. Malone J.P. Veis A. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34700-34708Google Scholar, 6Steiglitz B.M. Ayala M. Narayanan K. George A. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 980-986Google Scholar). Particularly, Dspp null mice display a strikingly similar phenotype in teeth as observed in our Dmp-1 null mice: reduced thickness of dentin, increased thickness of predentin, enlarged pulp chamber, and hypomineralization. Thus, we investigated whether there was a potential linkage between DMP-1 and DSPP during postnatal dentinogenesis. First, we examined DSPP protein level in Dmp-1 null first molars from 1 month to 12 months in age with a polyclonal antibody against the mouse DSPP. In the wild-type molar, a strong DSPP signal is detected in both the dentin and the odontoblast (Fig. 6, A-D, upper panels), whereas a reduction of DSPP signal is observed in Dmp-1 null molar (Fig. 6, A-D, lower panels). Next, we asked whether this change was caused by a reduction of DSPP expression or an increase in degradation of DSPP in mice lacking Dmp-1. With the RT-PCR method at 30 cycles, we measured the Dspp mRNA level in 1-week-old Dmp-1 null teeth compared with that in the control. As shown in Fig. 6E, Dspp transcripts are reduced in Dmp-1 null teeth, suggesting a reduction of Dspp expression. This is further confirmed by real time RT-PCR data, which showed a 25% reduction of Dspp in Dmp-1 null molars compared with the control. We therefore propose that DSPP can be regulated directly or indirectly by Dmp-1 and that some of dentinogenesis defects in Dmp-1 null mice are probably caused by a reduction of DSPP (Fig. 6F). An Increased Biglycan May Be Associated with the Dentin Defects in Dmp-1 Null Mice—Biglycan, one of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan family members, is secreted by odontoblasts. A high concentration of biglycan inhibits the growth and proliferation of mineral crystals in vitro (20Boskey A.L. J. Dent. Res. 1997; 76: 1433-1436Google Scholar). Interestingly, biglycan null mice display growth retardation and decreased bone mass (21Xu T. Bianco P. Fisher L.W. Longenecker G. Smith E. Goldstein S. Bonadio J. Boskey A. Heegaard A.M. Sommer B. Satomura K. Dominguez P. Zhao C. Kulkarni A.B. Robey P.G. Young M.F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 78-82Google Scholar), whereas ectopic ossification is observed in biglycan and fibromodulin double null mice (22Ameye L. Aria D. Jepsen K. Oldberg A. Xu T. Young M.F. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 673-680Google Scholar). To address whether there is a change in biglycan expression in Dmp-1 null mice, a polyclonal antibody to mouse biglycan was used for immunostaining of the first molars from 3-week, 3-month, and 12-month-old mice (Fig. 7, WT, upper panels; KO, lower panels). A dramatic increase of biglycan in the predentin of Dmp-1 null mice was observed in the expanded predentin, which has been reported in Dspp null mice (11Sreenath T. Thyagarajan T. Hall B. Longenecker G. D'Souza R. Hong S. Wright J.T. MacDougall M. Sauk J. Kulkarni A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24874-24880Google Scholar). However, there was no change in biglycan mRNA level (data not shown), suggesting that there is no increase in biglycan production in Dmp-1 null mice. The Third Molar Is Retarded in Dmp-1 Null Mice—Dmp-1 null phenotype appears postnatally (see above), and formation of the third molar is mainly during the first 2 weeks after birth. We therefore examined a potential effect of the absence of Dmp-1 on development of the third molar from 2 weeks to 1 year in age. As shown in Fig. 8 (right panels, arrows), the third molar is either absent or delayed in development in Dmp-1 null mice. Based on analysis over 200 Dmp-1 null mice with C57/B6 background, ∼10% of Dmp-1 null mice display this defect. In contrast, the other defects described above exhibit a 100% penetrance. The detailed mechanism is unknown and is currently under investigation. During dentinogenesis, odontoblasts secrete unmineralized, collagen-rich extracellular matrices termed predentin. As a precursor of dentin (a bone-like mineralized tissue), predentin lies between the mineralization front and the odontoblast layer. Later, the predentin is transformed to the mineralized tissue when apatite crystals are deposited within and around collagen fibrils (1Garant P.R. Dickson A. Oral Cells and Tissues. Quintessence Publishing, Chicago, IL2003: 25-52Google Scholar, 23Butler W.T. Ritchie H. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 169-179Google Scholar, 24Ten Cate A. Oral Histology: Development, Structure, and Function. Mosby, St. Louis, MO1998: 128-149Google Scholar). This process requires mechanisms that control the site and rate of apatite formation. In other words, the rate of formation of the unmineralized precursor layer should be the same as that of mineralization. Imbalances of these dynamic processes would lead to pathological conditions such as expansion of the predentin layer and reduction in the dentin layer as observed in some in some human dentin diseases (25Levin L.S. Leaf S.H. Jelmini R.J. Rose J.J. Rosenbaum K.N. Oral Surg. 1983; 56: 267-274Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms for controlling this process are largely unknown, noncollagenous proteins in dentin have been proposed to be critical for this process during dentinogenesis (23Butler W.T. Ritchie H. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 169-179Google Scholar). In this study, we provide strong in vivo evidence to support DMP-1 roles in late stages of dentinogenesis with a Dmp-1 lacZ knock-in null animal model as described below. First, Dmp-1 is continuously expressed in dentin after birth (Fig. 1, B and C), and Dmp-1 null pups display defects starting with hypomineralization and reduction of dentin thickness at day 3 after birth (Fig. 2). Second, enlarged pulp chambers, expanded root canals, and decreased thickness in the dentin walls exist throughout the Dmp-1 null mouse life span, although data are shown only up to 1 year (Figs. 3 and 5), suggesting that a defect (instead of a simple delaying) exists in later stages of dentinogenesis. Third, a defect in maturation of predentin to dentin, as reflected by an expanded predentin zone and reduced thickness of dentin, is documented in both incisors and molars in the mutants (Figs. 5, 6, 7). Fourth, the dentin ultrastructure is rough and disorganized, with little mineral deposited in mutant peritubular areas (Fig. 4), suggesting that DMP-1 is required for both the organic and inorganic components in dentin. All of the above phenotype is 100% penetrance, suggesting that none of the existing genes can compensate for the role of DMP-1 in later stages of dentinogenesis and mineralization. Paradoxically, there is no apparent phenotype observed in Dmp-1 null embryos or newborns, although Dmp-1 is active in the odontoblastic layer during this developmental stage (10Feng J.Q. Huang H. Lu Y. Ye L. Xie Y. Tsutsui T.W. Kunieda T. Castranio T. Scott G. Bonewald L.B. Mishina Y. J. Dent. Res. 2003; 82: 776-780Google Scholar). It is of note that mineralization in dentin, where DMP-1 plays a critical role, occurs mainly after birth. This difference of mineralization in dentin before and after birth may explain partially for defects observed in later stages of dentinogenesis. To determine and identify what other molecules are involved in dentinogenesis could be perturbed in the Dmp-1 null mice, we have screened over 10 factors and matrix proteins (bone morphogenic proteins 2 and 4, PTHrP, Cbfa1, type 1 collagen, alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein, osteopontin, DSPP, and biglycan) by both RT-PCR and immunostaining. Of this group, there is little change seen in Dmp-1 null mice (data not shown) except for a reduction in DSPP (Fig. 6) and the accumulation of biglycan in dentin matrix (Fig. 7). The significance of these findings is described as below. DSPP, like DMP-1, is a member of the SIBLING family and highly expressed in odontoblasts during dentinogenesis (26D'Souza R.N. Cavender A. Sunavala G. Alvarez J. Ohshima T. Kulkarni A.B. MacDougall M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 2040-2049Google Scholar). Both genes are located on the same chromosome location and share similar biochemical and genomic DNA features (17Feng J.Q. Luan X. Wallace J. Jing D. Ohshima T. Kulkarni A.B. D'Souza R.N. Kozak C.A. MacDougall M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9457-9464Google Scholar, 18Fisher L.W. Torchia D.A. Fohr B. Young M.F. Fedarko N.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 460-465Google Scholar, 19Fedarko N.S. Fohr B. Robey P.G. Young M.F. Fisher L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16666-16672Google Scholar). In vitro studies have shown that dentin phosphoprotein, a cleaved product of DSPP, is actively involved in mineralization in vitro (27Boskey A.L. Maresca M. Doty S. Sabsay B. Veis A. Bone Miner. 1990; 11: 55-65Google Scholar, 28Linde A. Lussi A. Crenshaw M.A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1989; 44: 286-295Google Scholar). Mutations in the human DSPP gene are associated with the disease dentinogenesis imperfecta (29Zhang X. Zhao J. Li C. Gao S. Qiu C. Liu P. Wu G. Qiang B. Lo W.H. Shen Y. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 151-152Google Scholar, 30Xiao S. Yu C. Chou X. Yuan W. Wang Y. Bu L. Fu G. Qian M. Yang J. Shi Y. Hu L. Han B. Wang Z. Huang W. Liu J. Chen Z. Zhao G. Kong X. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 201-204Google Scholar). Finally, both Dmp-1 null mice (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) and Dspp null mice (11Sreenath T. Thyagarajan T. Hall B. Longenecker G. D'Souza R. Hong S. Wright J.T. MacDougall M. Sauk J. Kulkarni A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24874-24880Google Scholar) display a very similar defect in later stages of dentinogenesis, suggesting a strong connection between these two genes. Here we show that DSPP is reduced in Dmp-1 null mice at both the mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 7). This finding is in agreement with an in vitro study by Narayanan et al. (7Narayanan K. Srinivas R. Ramachandran A. Hao J. Quinn B. George A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4516-4521Google Scholar), in which overexpression of Dmp-1 induced Dspp expression. These authors also reported DMP-1 in the nucleus (31Narayanan K. Ramachandran A. Hao J. He G. Park K.W. Cho M. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17500-17508Google Scholar). Taken together, DSPP is probably one of the targeted molecules by DMP-1, and changes in DSPP may explain, in part, some of the defects observed in Dmp-1 null mice (see Fig. 6E for support of our hypothesis). However, Dspp null mice did not show tooth phenotype until 2-3 months of age (11Sreenath T. Thyagarajan T. Hall B. Longenecker G. D'Souza R. Hong S. Wright J.T. MacDougall M. Sauk J. Kulkarni A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24874-24880Google Scholar). Furthermore, Dspp null mice display a high incidence of pulp exposures, a feature not found in Dmp-1 null teeth. This suggests that the absence of DMP-1 itself or changes of other factors due to loss of DMP-1 may play a critical role in the development of defects in Dmp-1 null dentinogenesis. Changes in the biglycan level in Dmp-1 null predentin matrix are probably one example. As stated earlier, maintenance of normal biglycan levels in mineralized tissues is critical, since a high concentration of biglycan inhibits the growth and proliferation of mineral crystals in vitro (20Boskey A.L. J. Dent. Res. 1997; 76: 1433-1436Google Scholar). Deletion of biglycan leads to growth retardation and bone mass reduction (21Xu T. Bianco P. Fisher L.W. Longenecker G. Smith E. Goldstein S. Bonadio J. Boskey A. Heegaard A.M. Sommer B. Satomura K. Dominguez P. Zhao C. Kulkarni A.B. Robey P.G. Young M.F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 78-82Google Scholar) or to ectopic ossification when deleted with fibromodulin together (22Ameye L. Aria D. Jepsen K. Oldberg A. Xu T. Young M.F. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 673-680Google Scholar). In Dspp null mice, both biglycan mRNA (as shown by RT-PCR) and protein (as shown by immunostaining) levels were increased (11Sreenath T. Thyagarajan T. Hall B. Longenecker G. D'Souza R. Hong S. Wright J.T. MacDougall M. Sauk J. Kulkarni A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24874-24880Google Scholar). Similarly, Sreenath et al. (11Sreenath T. Thyagarajan T. Hall B. Longenecker G. D'Souza R. Hong S. Wright J.T. MacDougall M. Sauk J. Kulkarni A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24874-24880Google Scholar) demonstrated the increased production and accumulation of decorin, another small leucine-rich proteoglycan secreted by odontoblast, in Dspp null mice. In contrast, there is no alteration in the level of biglycan mRNA (data not shown) despite the increase of biglycan protein in Dmp-1 null predentin (Fig. 7). This suggests that the presence of DMP-1 is required for removing of biglycan in predentin matrix either directly or indirectly. In addition, there is no change in either mRNA or protein levels of decorin in Dmp-1 null mice (data not shown), indicating that DMP-1 and DSPP may have distinct roles in dentinogenesis. One of the most surprising findings in this study is that the third molar is either missing or retarded in some of Dmp-1 null mice (Fig. 8). Tooth agenesis is a common inherited condition and has been linked in some cases to mutations in Msx-1 or Pax-9 (32Vastardis H. Karimbux N. Guthua S.W. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 417-421Google Scholar, 33Stockton D.W. Das P. Goldenberg M. D'Souza R.N. Patel P.I. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 18-19Google Scholar, 34van den Boogaard M.J. Dorland M. Beemer F.A. van Amstel H.K. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 342-343Google Scholar, 35Frazier-Bowers S.A. Guo D.C. Cavender A. Xue L. Evans B. King T. Milewicz D. D'Souza R.N. J. Dent. Res. 2002; 81: 129-133Google Scholar, 36Vieira A.R. J. Dent. Res. 2003; 82: 162-165Google Scholar). Deletion of Msx-1 or Pax-9 leads to tooth agenesis in mice (37Satokata I. Maas R. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 348-356Google Scholar, 38Peters H. Neubuser A. Kratochwil K. Balling R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2735-2747Google Scholar), suggesting that these early transcription factors are required for tooth formation and patterning. In contrast, Dmp-1 is mainly active in the odontoblasts, a terminated cell, and deletion of Dmp-1 has no effect on general tooth shape and size (Figs. 3 and 8). Additionally, tooth agenesis only accounts for ∼10% of Dmp-1 null mice in which severe alveolar bone defects coexist, suggesting that this defect is probably secondary to that of the bone defects. In summary, by characterizing Dmp-1 null mice, our studies clearly demonstrated that DMP-1 is required for mineralization and maturation of predentin into dentin during later stages of dentinogenesis. The Dmp-1 tooth phenotype is identical, and 100% penetrance in both inbred C57/B6 background and outbred CD-1 background (data not shown). This indicates that tooth defects observed in Dmp-1 null mice are most likely independent of genetic background. In this study, we have also excluded a potential effect of the neo-cassette on the Dmp-1 null tooth phenotype, since the tooth phenotype is identical in Dmp-1 null mice after removal of the floxed neo-cassette by breeding with CMV-Cre transgenic mice (data not shown). The above defects could not be rescued by a high calcium diet (data not shown), suggesting that the effect of DMP-1 on mineralization is local. Last, our initial mechanism studies show that DSPP can be directly or indirectly controlled by DMP-1. However, reduction of DSPP can only explain in part the defects displayed in Dmp-1 null mice.

https://openalex.org/W2035447755,"SLC5A8, a tumor suppressor gene down-regulated in human colon cancer, codes for a transporter in the Na+/glucose cotransporter gene family, but the definitive functional identity of the transporter protein is not known. Since this gene is expressed abundantly in the colon where short-chain fatty acids are generated by bacterial fermentation, we tested the hypothesis that it codes for a Na+-coupled transporter for these fatty acids. The coding region of SLC5A8 mRNA was amplified from human intestine and expressed heterologously in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Transport function was monitored by uptake of radiolabeled substrates and by substrate-induced currents under voltage-clamp conditions. Uptake of short-chain fatty acids (lactate, pyruvate, acetate, propionate, and butyrate) in oocytes expressing SLC5A8 was severalfold higher than in uninjected oocytes. Exposure of SLC5A8-expressing oocytes to these fatty acids induced inward currents under voltage-clamp conditions in a Na+-dependent manner. These currents were saturable and the substrate concentrations needed for half-maximal induction of the current were in the range of 0.08–2.5 mm. The substrate-induced currents decreased as the carbon chain length of the substrates increased. The Na+-activation kinetics indicated involvement of more than one Na+ ion in the activation process. Direct measurements of substrate (propionate) and charge transfer showed that three positive charges are transferred into oocytes per substrate molecule. These studies establish the functional identity of SLC5A8 as a Na+-coupled transporter for short-chain fatty acids.

Direct measurements of substrate (propionate) and charge transfer showed that three positive charges are transferred into oocytes per substrate molecule. These studies establish the functional identity of SLC5A8 as a Na+-coupled transporter for short-chain fatty acids. SLC5A8 was recently identified as a candidate tumor suppressor gene in humans that is silenced by methylation in colon cancer (1Li H. Myeroff L. Smiraglia D. Romero M.F. Pretlow T.P. Kasturi L. Lutterbaugh J. Rerko R.M. Casey G. Issa J.P. Willis J. Willson J.K. Plass C. Markowitz S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8412-8417Google Scholar). The protein encoded by SLC5A8 is a putative transporter belonging to the Na+/glucose cotransporter gene family (2Wright E.M. Turk E. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2003; (Epub ahead of print, May 14, 2003)Google Scholar). SLC5A8 has been shown to transport Na+ when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (1Li H. Myeroff L. Smiraglia D. Romero M.F. Pretlow T.P. Kasturi L. Lutterbaugh J. Rerko R.M. Casey G. Issa J.P. Willis J. Willson J.K. Plass C. Markowitz S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8412-8417Google Scholar), but the cotransported organic/inorganic substrate has not been identified. Interestingly, the cloning of an identical cDNA has been reported independently by Rodriguez et al. (3Rodriguez A.M. Perron B. Lacroix L. Caillou B. Leblanc G. Schlumberger M. Bidart J.M. Pourcher T. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 3500-3503Google Scholar) who claimed that the cDNA codes for an uncoupled passive transporter for iodide. This reported functional feature of SLC5A8 as a passive iodide transporter has apparently led to the labeling of this transporter as SLC5A11 in a recent review by Wright and Turk (2Wright E.M. Turk E. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2003; (Epub ahead of print, May 14, 2003)Google Scholar). The findings by Li et al. (1Li H. Myeroff L. Smiraglia D. Romero M.F. Pretlow T.P. Kasturi L. Lutterbaugh J. Rerko R.M. Casey G. Issa J.P. Willis J. Willson J.K. Plass C. Markowitz S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8412-8417Google Scholar) that SLC5A8 is a Na+ transporter are in contradiction with those by Rodriguez et al. (3Rodriguez A.M. Perron B. Lacroix L. Caillou B. Leblanc G. Schlumberger M. Bidart J.M. Pourcher T. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 3500-3503Google Scholar) that the same protein functions as an uncoupled (i.e. no Na+ involvement in the transport process) iodide transporter.Since all members of the SLC5 gene family, with the exception of SLC5A3 which is a glucose-sensitive Na+ channel and SLC5A9 whose transport function has not yet been established (2Wright E.M. Turk E. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2003; (Epub ahead of print, May 14, 2003)Google Scholar), are Na+-coupled cotransporters for organic or inorganic solutes, we hypothesized that SLC5A8 is most likely a Na+-coupled transporter for an hitherto unidentified organic or inorganic solute. The abundant expression of SLC5A8 in the colon and its suggested role as a tumor suppressor (1Li H. Myeroff L. Smiraglia D. Romero M.F. Pretlow T.P. Kasturi L. Lutterbaugh J. Rerko R.M. Casey G. Issa J.P. Willis J. Willson J.K. Plass C. Markowitz S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8412-8417Google Scholar) led us to question its purported role as a passive iodide transporter. Based on the tissue expression pattern, we hypothesized that SLC5A8 is likely to be a Na+-coupled transporter as suggested by Li et al. (1Li H. Myeroff L. Smiraglia D. Romero M.F. Pretlow T.P. Kasturi L. Lutterbaugh J. Rerko R.M. Casey G. Issa J.P. Willis J. Willson J.K. Plass C. Markowitz S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8412-8417Google Scholar) and that short-chain fatty acids may be the cotransported substrates. Short-chain fatty acids such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate are generated at high levels in the colon by bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber and unabsorbed carbohydrates (4Mortensen P.B. Clausen M.R. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1996; 216: 132-148Google Scholar, 5Velazquez O.C. Lederer H.M. Rombeau J.L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 427: 123-134Google Scholar, 6Topping D.L. Clifton P.M. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1031-1064Google Scholar) and these fatty acids are the preferred metabolic fuel in colonic epithelial cells (4Mortensen P.B. Clausen M.R. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1996; 216: 132-148Google Scholar, 5Velazquez O.C. Lederer H.M. Rombeau J.L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 427: 123-134Google Scholar, 6Topping D.L. Clifton P.M. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1031-1064Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that short-chain fatty acids prevent colonic cell proliferation and reduce the incidence of colon cancer (7Wachtershauser A. Stein J. Eur. J. Nutr. 2000; 39: 164-171Google Scholar, 8Blottiere H.M. Buecher B. Galmiche J.P. Cherbut C. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 2003; 62: 101-106Google Scholar, 9Chen J.S. Faller D.V. Spanjaard R.A. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2003; 3: 219-236Google Scholar). It is conceivable that methylation-dependent silencing of the gene expression in the colon will decrease the availability of short-chain fatty acids to colonic epithelial cells and thus influence the metabolic profile and proliferation of these cells. These findings provided the rationale for our hypothesis that SLC5A8 may be a Na+-coupled transporter for short-chain fatty acids. Here we provide evidence that human SLC5A8 does indeed function as a Na+-coupled transporter for short-chain fatty acids.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The following radiolabeled substrates were obtained from commercial sources: [14C]-l-lactate, [14C]-d-lactate, [14C]acetate, and [3H]propionate from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO) and [14C]pyruvate and [14C]butyrate from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA).Amplification of the Coding Region of Human SCL5A8 —To amplify the coding region of human SLC5A8 mRNA by RT 1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcriptase; MCT, monocarboxylate transporter; SMCT, sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter; SLC, solute-linked carrier; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. -PCR, we designed primers based on the published sequence (1Li H.

The sense primer, containing the initiation codon (shown in bold), was 5′-GATATATAGCCATGGACACGCCACGGGGCAT-3′, and the antisense primer, located downstream of the stop codon, was 5′-CGCGAAGCTTCACAAACGAGTCCCATTGCT-3′. The underlined sequence in the antisense primer is an HindIII site, added to the 5′-end of the primer for cloning purpose. RT-PCR with these primers and human intestinal mRNA as the template yielded a ∼1.9-kb product as expected from the positions of the primers in the published sequence (sense, 361–383; antisense, 2176–2204). This product was subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector. The insert was then released from the plasmid by digestion with EcoRI and HindIII and subcloned into the vector pGH19 at the EcoRI/HindIII site. The pGH19 vector (kindly provided by Dr. Peter S. Aronson, Yale University School of Medicine) contains the 3′-untranslated region of the Xenopus β-globin gene downstream of the cloning site. The cDNA were sequenced by the Taq DyeDeoxy terminator cycle method using an automated PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems 377 Prism DNA sequencer.Functional Analysis of SLC5A8 in Xenopus Oocytes—The amplified human SLC5A8 cDNA was expressed heterologously in Xenopus oocytes by cRNA injection. Capped cRNA from SLC5A8 cDNA was synthesized using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Mature oocytes (stage IV or V) from Xenopus laevis were injected with 50 ng cRNA. Uninjected oocytes served as controls. The oocytes were used for uptake and electrophysiological studies 3–6 days after cRNA injection. Uptake of radiolabeled substrates in uninjected and cRNA-injected oocytes was determined as described previously (10Fei Y.J. Prasad P.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8744-8751Google Scholar). Eight oocytes were used for each uptake measurement. Electrophysiological studies were performed by the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp method (11Wang H. Fei Y.J. Kekuda R. Yang-Feng T.L. Devoe L.D. Leibach F.H. Prasad P.D. Ganapathy V. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C1019-C1030Google Scholar, 12Inoue K. Fei Y.J. Zhuang L. Gopal E. Miyauchi S. Ganapathy V. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 949-957Google Scholar). Oocytes were perfused with a NaCl-containing buffer (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1mm CaCl2, 3mm Hepes, 3 mm Mes, and 3 mm Tris, pH 7.5), followed by the same buffer containing different fatty acids. The membrane potential was clamped at –50 mV. The differences between the steady-state currents measured in the presence and absence of substrates were considered as the substrate-induced currents. To investigate the current-membrane potential (I-V) relationship, step changes in membrane potential were applied, each for a duration of 100 ms in 20-mV increments. The kinetic parameter K0.5 (i.e. the substrate concentration necessary for the induction of half-maximal current) was calculated by fitting the values of the substrate-induced currents to Michaelis-Menten equation. The Na+-activation kinetics was analyzed by measuring the substrate-specific currents in the presence of increasing concentrations of Na+. The data were analyzed by the Hill equation to determine the Hill coefficient (h; the number of Na+ ions involved in the activation process). The kinetic parameters were determined using the computer program Sigma Plot, version 6.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). Electrophysiological measurements of substrate-induced currents were repeated at least four times with separate oocytes. The data are presented as means ± S.E. of these replicates.Determination of Charge/Substrate Transfer Ratio—The charge-to-substrate transfer ratio was determined for propionate in four different oocytes as described previously (11Wang H. Fei Y.J. Kekuda R. Yang-Feng T.L. Devoe L.D. Leibach F.H. Prasad P.D. Ganapathy V. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C1019-C1030Google Scholar, 12Inoue K. Fei Y.J. Zhuang L. Gopal E. Miyauchi S. Ganapathy V. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 949-957Google Scholar). The oocytes were perfused with 25 μm propionate (unlabeled plus radiolabeled propionate), and inward currents were monitored over a period of 8–10 min. At the end of the experiment, the amount of propionate transported into the oocytes was calculated by measuring the radioactivity associated with the oocytes. The area within the curve describing the relationship between the time and inward current was integrated to calculate the charge transferred into the oocyte during incubation with propionate. The values for substrate transfer and charge transfer were used to determine the charge-to-substrate transfer ratio.RESULTSAmplification of the Coding Region of Human SLC5A8 mRNA for Functional Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—We amplified the coding region of SLC5A8 mRNA by RT-PCR using human intestinal mRNA as the template. The amino acid sequence of the amplified product was identical to the published sequences (1Li H. Myeroff L. Smiraglia D. Romero M.F. Pretlow T.P. Kasturi L. Lutterbaugh J. Rerko R.M. Casey G.

The uptake of all fatty acids tested (l-lactate, d-lactate, pyruvate, acetate, propionate, and butyrate) was higher in cRNA-injected oocytes than in uninjected oocytes. The cRNA-induced increase in uptake varied in the range of 2–45-fold depending on the fatty acid. This increase was not observed when the uptake was measured in the absence of Na+ (data not shown).Table IUptake of short-chain fatty acids in uninjected oocytes and in oocytes injected with SLC5A8 cRNASubstrateUptake-Fold increaseUninjected oocytescRNA-injected oocytesnmol/h/oocytel-Lactate (50 μm)0.009 ± 0.0010.402 ± 0.02644.7d-Lactate (150 μm)0.028 ± 0.0021.090 ± 0.04138.9Pyruvate (500 μm)0.151 ± 0.0172.622 ± 0.07517.4Acetate (150 μm)0.032 ± 0.0010.059 ± 0.0031.8Propionate (50 μm)0.016 ± 0.0010.255 ± 0.01415.9Butyrate (150 μm)0.029 ± 0.0010.116 ± 0.0074.0 Open table in a new tab Electrophysiological Studies of SLC5A8 —We then examined the transport function of SLC5A8 by electrophysiological methods. Exposure of cRNA-injected oocytes to various short-chain fatty acids induced marked inward currents under voltage-clamp conditions and the magnitude of these currents increased as the testing membrane potential was changed from positive values to negative values (Fig. 1A). Exposure of uninjected oocytes to these fatty acids did not induce detectable currents (data not shown). We then compared the substrate-induced currents in cRNA-injected oocytes among several fatty acids (5 mm). The currents, measured at –50 mV, were maximal for l-lactate, pyruvate, and propionate, intermediate for d-lactate, acetate, butyrate, and pentanoate and lowest for hexanoate, heptanoate, and octanoate (Fig. 1B). With propionate as the substrate, we analyzed the saturation kinetics and Na+-activation kinetics. Results from a representative oocyte are given in Fig. 2 and similar results were obtained in three different additional oocytes. Propionate-induced currents were saturable with a K0.5 value of 127 ± 14 μm (Fig. 2A). The relationship between propionate-induced currents and Na+ concentration was sigmoidal and the value for Hill coefficient (h) was 2.0 ± 0.1 (Fig. 2B). The K0.5 value was not influenced significantly by the testing membrane potential between –30 mV and –150 mV (Fig. 3A). But, the value increased dramatically when the testing membrane potential became more positive. The Imax value (i.e. the current induced by the substrate at maximal concentrations) was however influenced by the testing membrane potential profoundly, the values being higher at hyperpolarized membrane potentials than at depolarized membrane potentials (Fig. 3B).Fig. 2A, saturation kinetics for propionate in SLC5A8-expressing oocytes at a Na+ concentration of 100 mm.

Similar results were obtained in three other oocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Influence of membrane potential on K0.5 (i.e. concentration of propionate needed for the induction of half-maximal current) and Imax (i.e. current induced by maximal concentrations of propionate) in SLC5A8-expressing oocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Comparative Affinities of Short-chain Fatty Acids for SLC5A8 —We determined the K0.5 values for l-lactate, d-lactate, pyruvate, acetate, propionate, and butyrate to compare the affinities of these fatty acids for interaction with SLC5A8. The affinities were found to be in the following order: butyrate (81 ± 17 μm) > propionate (127 ± 14 μm) > l-lactate (235 ± 24 μm) > d-lactate (742 ± 330 μm) > acetate (2.46 ± 0.89 mm). These data were from four different oocytes.Charge-to-Substrate Transfer Ratio—The Na+-activation kinetics with propionate suggested that at least two Na+ are involved in the activation process. Propionate exists as a monovalent anion at pH 7.5 and cotransport of two Na+ with one propionate molecule would predict the transport process to be electrogenic and explain the observed propionate-induced inward currents under voltage-clamp conditions. However, the Hill coefficient is only an estimate and does not always predict the exact number of coupled ions involved in the transport process. Therefore, we directly measured the transfer of propionate and charge simultaneously in the same oocytes to determine the exact value for the charge-to-substrate ratio (Fig. 4A). The value for this ratio determined with four different oocytes for propionate was 3.1 ± 0.1. To determine whether any other anions such as Cl– or OH– are involved in the transport process, we examined the ionic dependence of propionate-induced currents (Fig. 4B). The substrate-induced currents were obligatorily dependent on the presence of Na+, but there appeared to be no involvement of Cl– as there was no significant change in the magnitude of the currents when Cl– was replaced by gluconate in the perfusion medium. We also investigated whether the currents were influenced by external pH. The propionate-induced currents remained the same over the pH range 6–8, suggesting that anions such as OH– are not likely to be involved in the transport process (data not shown).Fig. 4A, relationship between substrate transfer and charge transfer in four different SLC5A8-expressing oocytes. Propionate (25 μm) was used as the substrate. B, Na+ and Cl– dependence of propionate (5 mm)-induced current in SLC5A8-expressing oocytes.

(3Rodriguez A.M. Perron B. Lacroix L. Caillou B. Leblanc G. Schlumberger M. Bidart J.M. Pourcher T. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 3500-3503Google Scholar) have shown that SLC5A8 functions as a passive transporter for iodide, we examined the potential interaction of this inorganic anion with SLC5A8 in cRNA-injected oocytes. The presence of 5 mm NaI did not induce any detectable current (inward or outward) in these oocytes (data not shown).DISCUSSIONThe present studies have established the functional identity of human SLC5A8 as a Na+-coupled transporter for short-chain fatty acids with a Na+:substrate stoichiometry of 4:1. This is evident from the uptake of radiolabeled substrates as well as from substrate-induced inward currents. The inward currents induced by short-chain fatty acids are obligatorily dependent on Na+. Neither Cl– nor OH– is involved in the transport process. The magnitude of the substrate-induced currents is maximal for fatty acids containing 2–5 carbon atoms and the currents decrease as the carbon chain length increases. Under the experimental conditions employed in our studies, we could not detect any interaction of iodide with SLC5A8. The reasons for the differences between our studies and those of Rodriguez et al. (3Rodriguez A.M. Perron B. Lacroix L. Caillou B. Leblanc G. Schlumberger M. Bidart J.M. Pourcher T. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 3500-3503Google Scholar) are not known. Li et al. (1Li H. Myeroff L. Smiraglia D. Romero M.F. Pretlow T.P. Kasturi L. Lutterbaugh J. Rerko R.M. Casey G. Issa J.P. Willis J. Willson J.K. Plass C. Markowitz S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8412-8417Google Scholar) have shown that SLC5A8-expressing oocytes had higher levels of Na+, leading to the conclusion that SLC5A8 is a Na+ transporter even though their studies did not establish the identity of the cotransported ion. Sodium pyruvate is normally added to the medium used in the maintenance of oocytes following cRNA injection, and incubation of SLC5A8-expressing oocytes in pyruvate-containing medium during the maintenance of the oocytes is expected to increase intracellular Na+ based on the functional identity of the transporter established in the present studies. However, it was not readily apparent whether or not the oocytes were maintained in the presence of pyruvate in the studies reported by Li et al. (1Li H. Myeroff L. Smiraglia D. Romero M.F. Pretlow T.P. Kasturi L. Lutterbaugh J. Rerko R.M. Casey G. Issa J.P. Willis J. Willson J.K. Plass C. Markowitz S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8412-8417Google Scholar). Our studies show unequivocally that SLC5A8 is a Na+-coupled transporter for short-chain fatty acids.The substrate specificity of SLC5A8 is similar to that of H+-coupled monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) (13Halestrap A.P. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 281-299Google Scholar). Therefore, based on the functional identity of SLC5A8 as the Na+-coupled transporter for monocarboxylates, we refer to this transporter as SMCT (for sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter). However, there is no sequence similarity between SMCT and MCTs. The functional identity of SMCT as a Na+-coupled transporter for short-chain fatty acids is very important with regard to the abundant expression of the transporter in colon (1Li H. Myeroff L. Smiraglia D. Romero M.F. Pretlow T.P. Kasturi L. Lutterbaugh J. Rerko R.M. Casey G. Issa J.P. Willis J. Willson J.K. Plass C. Markowitz S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8412-8417Google Scholar) where these fatty acids are generated at high levels by bacterial fermentation. In the past, several studies have focused on the transport routes available for the absorption of short-chain fatty acids in the colon (14Rajendran V.M. Binder H.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 915: 15-29Google Scholar, 15Sellin J.H. News Physiol. Sci. 1999; 14: 58-64Google Scholar), but surprisingly none of these studies has identified the presence of a Na+-coupled absorptive mechanism for these fatty acids. However, a Na+-coupled lactate transport system has been demonstrated in renal brush border membrane vesicles (16Barac-Nieto M. Murer H. Kinne R. Am. J. Physiol. 1980; 239: F496-F506Google Scholar, 17Barbarat B. Podevin R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12190-12193Google Scholar), but the molecular identity of the transport system has not yet been established. Since SLC5A8 transcripts are expressed in kidney (1Li H. Myeroff L. Smiraglia D. Romero M.F. Pretlow T.P. Kasturi L. Lutterbaugh J. Rerko R.M. Casey G. Issa J.P. Willis J. Willson J.K. Plass C. Markowitz S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8412-8417Google Scholar), we suggest that this transporter is likely to be responsible for Na+/lactate cotransport in kidney. The ability of SMCT to transport d-lactate is of physiological relevance, because while mammalian metabolism generates exclusively l-lactate, bacterial metabolism generates not only l-lactate but also d-lactate (18Bongaerts G.P. Tolboom J.J. Naber A.H. Sperl W.J. Severijnen R.S. Bakkeren J.A. Willems J.L. Microb. Pathog. 1997; 22: 285-293Google Scholar). Therefore, SMCT is most likely responsible for the absorption of d-lactate from the intestinal tract. d-Lactate is found in human blood and elevated levels of d-lactate in blood (d-lactic acidosis) result from bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine under various clinical and pathological conditions (19Uribarri J. Oh M.S. Carroll H.J. Medicine (Baltimore). 1998; 77: 73-82Google Scholar).The functional identification of SMCT as a Na+-coupled transporter for short-chain fatty acids is also relevant to recent studies by Li et al. (1Li H. Myeroff L. Smiraglia D. Romero M.F. Pretlow T.P. Kasturi L. Lutterbaugh J. Rerko R.M. Casey G. Issa J.P. Willis J. Willson J.K. Plass C. Markowitz S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8412-8417Google Scholar). Their studies suggested that this transporter may function as a tumor suppressor because its expression is silenced in colon cancer. This suggests that the absorption of short-chain fatty acids may be impaired in colonocytes at the site of cancer. Several studies have shown that short-chain fatty acids in the colon are effective in reducing the incidence of colon cancer (7Wachtershauser A. Stein J. Eur. J. Nutr. 2000; 39: 164-171Google Scholar, 8Blottiere H.M. Buecher B. Galmiche J.P. Cherbut C. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 2003; 62: 101-106Google Scholar, 9Chen J.S. Faller D.V. Spanjaard R.A. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2003; 3: 219-236Google Scholar). The potential mechanisms of tumor suppression by these fatty acids include inhibition of histone deacetylases (20Hinnebusch B.F. Meng S. Wu J.T. Archer S.Y. Hodin R.A. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 1012-1017Google Scholar), induction of apoptosis (21Jan G. Belzacq A.S. Haouzi D. Rouault A. Metivier D. Kroemer G. Brenner C. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 179-188Google Scholar, 22Augenlicht L.H. Anthony G.M. Church T.L. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Yang K. Lipkin M. Heerdt B.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6005-6009Google Scholar), modulation of gene expression (23Basson M.D. Liu Y.W. Hanly A.M. Emenaker N.J. Shenoy S.G. Gould M. Rothberg B.E. J. Gastrointest. Surg. 2000; 4: 501-512Google Scholar), and induction of cell cycle arrest (24Wang J. Friedman E.A. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 940-946Google Scholar). These fatty acids may also be involved in the prevention of colon cancer metastasis (25Emenaker N.J. Calaf G.M. Cox D. Basson M.D. Qureshi N. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 3041S-3046SGoogle Scholar). SLC5A8 was recently identified as a candidate tumor suppressor gene in humans that is silenced by methylation in colon cancer (1Li H. Myeroff L. Smiraglia D. Romero M.F. Pretlow T.P. Kasturi L. Lutterbaugh J. Rerko R.M. Casey G. Issa J.P. Willis J. Willson J.K. Plass C. Markowitz S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8412-8417Google Scholar). The protein encoded by SLC5A8 is a putative transporter belonging to the Na+/glucose cotransporter gene family (2Wright E.M. Turk E. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2003; (Epub ahead of print, May 14, 2003)Google Scholar). SLC5A8 has been shown to transport Na+ when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (1Li H. Myeroff L. Smiraglia D. Romero M.F. Pretlow T.P.

While APOBEC3G orthologues from several species are active against a broad range of retroviruses, given Vif proteins have a narrow spectrum of activity. For instance, HIV-1 Vif efficiently blocks APOBEC3G from human but not African green monkey (AGM), whereas the reverse is observed with SIVAGM Vif. Here, we demonstrate that a single amino acid at position 128 of human and AGM APOBEC3G governs the virus-specific sensitivity of these proteins to Vif-mediated inhibition. Furthermore, we show that this phenotype correlates with the ability of Vif to bind APOBEC3G and interfere with its incorporation into virions.

Neuberger M.S. Malim M.H. Cell. 2003; 113: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar), and of the hepadnavirus hepatitis B virus (13Turelli P. Mangeat B. Jost S. Vianin S. Trono D. Science. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). APOBEC3G orthologues are also effective against several of these viruses. Vif-defective HIV-1, for instance, is blocked by APOBEC3G from human, rhesus macaque, African green monkey, and mouse (5Mariani R. Chen D. Schrofelbauer B. Navarro F. Konig R. Bollman B. Munk C. Nymark-McMahon H. Landau N.R. Cell. 2003; 114: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). In contrast, a far greater degree of specificity is noted in the Vif sensitivity of these antiviral factors. As an example, the Vif protein of HIV-1 can only counter human and chimpanzee APOBEC3G, but is ineffective against the rhesus macaque, AGM, and mouse orthologues of the enzyme. Conversely, Vif from SIVAGM is active against AGM but not human APOBEC3G (5Mariani R. Chen D. Schrofelbauer B. Navarro F. Konig R. Bollman B. Munk C. Nymark-McMahon H. Landau N.R. Cell. 2003; 114: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Here, we took advantage of these species-specific differences to explore further the mechanism of Vif action. Expression Vectors—Wild type and vif-defective HIV-1 proviral clones were described previously (14von Schwedler U. Song J. Aiken C. Trono D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4945-4955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To permit its trans-expression, a His-tagged form of HIV-1 Vif was inserted into the pEF1/Myc-His plasmid (Invitrogen), yielding the pEF1-VifHis plasmid. The plasmids expressing the HA-tagged form of huAPOBEC3G (3Sheehy A.M. Gaddis N.C. Choi J.D. Malim M.H. Nature. 2002; 418: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar) and the SIVAGM.TAN Vif (pgVif/SIVAGM/TAN) (2Simon J.H. Miller D.L. Fouchier R.A. Soares M.A. Peden K.W. Malim M.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1259-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) were kind gifts from M. Malim (King's College, London, UK). The AGM version of APOBEC3G (5Mariani R. Chen D. Schrofelbauer B. Navarro F. Konig R. Bollman B. Munk C. Nymark-McMahon H. Landau N.R. Cell. 2003; 114: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar) (a kind gift of N. Landau, The Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) was inserted into the same expression vector as its human counterpart. Chimeras and individual point mutants were constructed using standard subcloning procedures with the help of the QuikChange Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) when required. Viral Production and Infectivity Assay—HIV-1 particles were produced by transient transfection of 293T cells with FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) (see www.tronolab.unige.ch for details). For these experiments, APOBEC3G and Vif plasmids were used at a 5- and 2-fold ratio, respectively, compared with proviral construct. Virion release was scored by monitoring the Reverse Transcriptase enzymatic activity in the producer cells supernatant (15Aiken C. Trono D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5048-5056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In single-round infectivity assays, viral titer was determined by applying filtered supernatant from producer cells on HeLa-CD4-LTRLacZ indicator cells (16Charneau P. Mirambeau G. Roux P. Paulous S. Buc H. Clavel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Virion infectivity was derived by dividing the infectious titer by the amount of physical particles. Immunofluorescence—After the co-transfection of relevant APOBEC3G-HA plasmid with or without equimolar amounts of HIV-1 Vif-expression vector, 293T cells were cultured on poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated coverslips. Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked with PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin. APOBEC3G-HA-specific indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (17Turelli P. Doucas V. Craig E. Mangeat B. Klages N. Evans R. Kalpana G. Trono D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1245-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), using the monoclonal HA.11 antibody (Covance Research Products, Denver, PA). Low magnification images were taken with a LSM510 confocal microscope (Zeiss). The percentage of APOBEC3G-positive cells was determined by monitoring cells with a fluorescent intensity higher than a threshold set with Photoshop 8 (Adobe). For each condition, two independent transfections were performed, and five whole fields were counted per transfection. Protein Analysis, Immunoprecipitations, and Virion Purification— The virus producer cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Lysates were precleared (13,000 rpm tabletop spin) and subjected to standard SDS-PAGE. For HA-specific Western blot analyses, the mouse monoclonal 3F10-peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Roche Applied Science) was used. HIV-1 Vif and PCNA were detected with the rabbit anti-Vif 2221 antibody (obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, from D. Gabuzda) and monoclonal anti-PCNA antibody (Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA), respectively. APOBEC3G-HA was immunoprecipitated overnight from aliquots of the precleared lysates, using anti-HA affinity matrix (clone 3F10, Roche Applied Science) in PBS. The resulting immunoprecipitates were washed twice with PBS, once with PBS, 0.025% Triton X-100, once with PBS, 0.25% Triton X-100, and finally once with PBS, 0.25% Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl final. They were then resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, followed by standard Western blot analysis. Virions were isolated by ultracentrifugation (200,000 × g, 45 min) through a PBS, 20% sucrose cushion and resuspended in a small volume of TNE (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8), 1% Triton X-100. Amounts of these lysed virions normalized for reverse transcriptase activity were subjected to standard SDS-PAGE. The same purification procedure was applied to supernatant of cells transfected with APOBEC3G-HA in the absence of a viral plasmid, excluding contamination by nonspecific microvesicles. Despite their contrasting sensitivities to HIV-1 and SIVAGM Vif, human and AGM APOBEC3G present a high degree of sequence homology (Fig. 1). This facilitated the generation of chimeras between these two molecules (Fig. 2A, left). Using a single-round assay, these chimeric derivatives were tested for their ability to inhibit the infectivity of vif-defective HIV-1 and for their susceptibility to HIV-1 Vif-mediated blockade (Fig. 2A, right). Human APOBEC3G (huAPOBEC3G) decreased the transduction efficiency of an HIV-1-derived lentiviral vector approximately 100-fold, while its AGM orthologue (agmAPOBEC3G) exerted an about 10-fold inhibition. As described previously, HIV-1 Vif prevented the action of huAPOBEC3G but was without effect on its AGM counterpart. However, a region encompassing residues 128–133 of huAPOBEC3G was sufficient to confer HIV-1 Vif sensitivity to agmAPOBEC3G. In this region, the two orthologues differ by only two amino acids, at positions 128 and 133 (Fig. 1). Single point mutations were thus introduced in huAPOBEC3G by substituting the corresponding agmAPOBEC3G residue at these two positions. The mutant altered at position 133 exhibited a wild type phenotype (not illustrated). In contrast, huAPOBEC3GD128K exhibited the same Vif-sensitivity pattern as agmAPOBEC3G, as it became resistant to HIV-1 Vif, but was effectively blocked by SIVAGM Vif (Fig. 2B). To confirm the crucial role of this particular residue, we engineered the reverse mutant, in which lysine 128 of agmAPOBEC3G was replaced by an aspartic acid as found in huAPOBEC3G. The resulting protein, agmAPOBEC3GK128D, acquired the HIV-1 Vif susceptibility of huAPOBEC3G (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Functional testing of APOBEC3G (APO3G) chimeras and point mutants. A, chimeras depicted on left were tested in a single-round infectivity assay for their ability to interfere with the infectivity of vif-defective HIV-1 and for their sensitivity to inhibition by HIV1-Vif. Results are representative of at least two experiments. B, indicated wild type and point-mutated APOBEC3G molecules (x axis) were tested for their activity against vif-defective HIV-1 (ΔVif HIV-1) and for their sensitivity to HIV-1 or SIVAGM Vif proteins. Infectivity of virions produced in the absence of Vif and APOBEC3G was given the arbitrary score of 100%. Results are representative of at least two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A series of additional analyses provided the molecular correlates of these functional data. First, in transiently transfected cells, the immunofluorescence-based detection of wild type huAPOBEC3G, but not of its D128K mutant, was decreased if HIV-1 Vif was co-expressed (Fig. 3A), consistent with a differential susceptibility to Vif-mediated degradation. Moreover, HIV-1 Vif could be immunoprecipitated with and decreased the virion incorporation of wild type huAPOBEC3G and agmAPOBEC3GK128D but not wild type agmAPOBEC3G or huAPOBEC3GD128K (Fig. 3B). Noteworthy, some huAPOBEC3G and agmAPOBEC3GK128D were detected in HIV-1 virions even in the presence of Vif. However, in these experiments where the antiviral was overexpressed, some inhibition of the wild type virus was observed, albeit far lower than measured with ΔVif virus. Remarkably, there was a good inverse correlation between virus infectivity and the residual amounts of virion-associated APOBEC3G. Together, these results demonstrate that a single amino acid difference between human and AGM APOBEC3G explains the virus-specific sensitivity of these proteins to Vif action. This residue thereby constitutes a crucial determinant of HIV and SIV host ranges and a barrier against the cross-species transmission of these viruses. Another important implication of these data is that the interaction between Vif and APOBEC3G must be direct. While our experiments do not formally define the Vif-binding site of APOBEC3G, our results warrant approaches aimed at identifying drugs that block this interaction, hence the ability of HIV to escape APOBEC3G-mediated innate immunity.

In this study the ability of hexose transporters to facilitate arsenic trioxide uptake in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was examined. In the absence of glucose, strains with disruption of the arsenite efflux gene ACR3 accumulated high levels of 73As(OH)3. The addition of glucose inhibited uptake by ∼80%. Disruption of FPS1, the aquaglyceroporin gene, reduced glucose-independent uptake by only about 25%, and the residual uptake was nearly completely inhibited by hexoses, including glucose, galactose, mannose, and fructose but not pentoses or disaccharides. A strain lacking FPS1, ACR3, and all genes for hexose permeases except for HXT3, HXT6, HXT7, and GAL2 exhibited hexose-inhibitable 73As(OH)3 uptake, whereas a strain lacking all 18 hexose transport-related genes (HXT1 to HXT17 and GAL2), FPS1 and ACR3, exhibited <10% of wild type 73As(OH)3 transport. When HXT1, HXT3, HXT4, HXT5, HXT7, or HXT9 was individually expressed in that strain, hexose-inhibitable 73As(OH)3 uptake was restored. In addition, the transport of [14C]glucose was inhibited by As(OH)3. These results clearly demonstrate that hexose permeases catalyze the majority of the transport of the trivalent metalloid arsenic trioxide.

In addition, the transport of [14C]glucose was inhibited by As(OH)3. These results clearly demonstrate that hexose permeases catalyze the majority of the transport of the trivalent metalloid arsenic trioxide. Arsenic trioxide is a carcinogen (1Abernathy C.O. Liu Y.P. Longfellow D. Aposhian H.V. Beck B. Fowler B. Goyer R. Menzer R. Rossman T. Thompson C. Waalkes M. Environ. Health Perspect. 1999; 107: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) and is also the active ingredient in the chemotherapeutic drug Trisenox, which is used for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (2Soignet S.L. Maslak P. Wang Z.G. Jhanwar S. Calleja E. Dardashti L.J. Corso D. DeBlasio A. Gabrilove J. Scheinberg D.A. Pandolfi P.P. Warrell Jr., R.P.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 1341-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). For trivalent arsenic to be a carcinogen or for Trisenox to be a useful drug, they must first be taken up into cells. Because it is unlikely that transport systems evolved for the uptake of arsenic trioxide, it is most likely taken up by transporters for biological molecules. To predict the routes of uptake, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the species present in solution at neutral pH. Arsenic trioxide is in equilibrium with the oxyanion arsenite, but, with a pKa of 9.2, it should be fully protonated and uncharged at neutral pH. We have shown by extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy that in solution at neutral pH, the predominate species is As(OH)3. 1A. Ramírez-Solís, R. Mukopadhyay, B. P. Rosen, and T. L. Stemmler, unpublished data. Thus, physiologically, As(III) appears to be a polyhydroxylated molecule; therefore, polyol transporters would be reasonable candidates for uptake systems. One class of polyol transporters are the aquaglyceroporins, which are channels for small uncharged solutes, such as glycerol (3Agre P. King L.S. Yasui M. Guggino W.B. Ottersen O.P. Fujiyoshi Y. Engel A. Nielsen S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 542: 3-16Crossref Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Members of the aquaglyceroporin family from bacteria (GlpF), yeast (Fps1p), and mammals (Aqp9) are As(OH)3 channels (4Liu Z. Shen J. Carbrey J.M. Mukhopadhyay R. Agre P. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6053-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 5Sanders O.I. Rensing C. Kuroda M. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. J.

Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1391-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Disruption of the yeast FPS1 gene resulted in substantial loss of uptake of As(OH)3 when glucose was present in the assay medium (4Liu Z. Shen J. Carbrey J.M. Mukhopadhyay R. Agre P. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6053-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that hexose permeases are responsible for the majority of As(OH)3 accumulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In glucose-free medium, the fps1Δ strain exhibits only a 25% reduction in 73As(OH)3 uptake compared with its parent. The residual uptake was almost completely inhibited by glucose, with half-maximal inhibition at ∼5 mm glucose. Other hexoses, including mannose, fructose, and galactose also inhibited As(OH)3 uptake, whereas neither sucrose nor glycerol had an effect. A strain in which all glucose transporters were disrupted exhibited a low level of 73As(OH)3 uptake comparable with that of its parent in the presence of glucose, and transport in that multiply disrupted strain was insensitive to glucose. A similar construct, with HXT3, HXT6, HXT7, and GAL2 remaining, still exhibited glucose-inhibitable 73As(OH)3 transport. HXT1, HXT3, HXT4, HXT5, HXT7, and HXT9 were individually expressed from plasmids and shown to restore 73As(OH)3 transport. In addition, As(OH)3 inhibited uptake of [14C]glucose in cells expressing all glucose permeases or just HXT7. These results clearly demonstrated that glucose carrier proteins catalyze the transport of trivalent arsenic. We propose that hexose permeases may have a role in uptake and toxicity of arsenic trioxide in other eukaryotes, including humans.

Disruption of ACR3 and FPS1—Yeast strain HD100 was constructed from CEN.PK2-1C by a stepwise replacement of 0.8 kbp of FPS1 with a LEU2 gene (4Liu Z. Shen J. Carbrey J.M. Mukhopadhyay R. Agre P. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6053-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) and 1.15 kbp of ACR3 with a HIS3 gene (11Ghosh M. Shen J. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5001-5006Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). HD200 and HD300 were constructed similarly from strains EBY.VW367+ and EBY.VW1000, respectively. Gene disruptions were verified by polymerase chain reaction. Assays of 73As(OH)3 and [14C]Glucose Transport—For the transport assays, most strains were grown to exponential phase at 30 °C in SD medium with 2% galactose. HD300, which cannot grow in hexoses, was grown in 2% maltose. HD300 carrying plasmids with HXT genes were grown in 2% glucose. The cells were harvested, washed, and suspended to a density of 5 × 108 cells/ml. In vivo assays of 73As(OH)3 (Los Alamos National Laboratories) were performed as described by Ghosh et al. (11Ghosh M. Shen J. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5001-5006Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Uptake of 5 mm d-[1-14C]glucose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was assayed as described by Wieczorke et al. (12Wieczorke R. Dlugai S. Krampe S. Boles E. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2003; 13: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Hexose Permeases Transport 73As(OH)3 in S. cerevisiae—The cells of wild type yeast accumulate little arsenic trioxide, but when the ACR3 gene encoding the arsenite efflux permease is disrupted, they accumulate the metalloid to high levels (11Ghosh M. Shen J. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5001-5006Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The combination of the ACR3 disruption with subsequent disruption of FPS1, the gene for the yeast aquaglyceroporin, was shown previously to result in the loss of almost all As(OH)3 uptake (4Liu Z. Shen J. Carbrey J.M. Mukhopadhyay R. Agre P. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6053-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). However, those transport measurements were performed in the presence of glucose. In the absence of glucose, both MG102 (acr3Δ) and HD9 (acr3Δ fps1Δ) accumulated 73As(OH)3 to high levels (Fig. 1). Disruption of FPS1 reduced uptake by only about 25%, but the addition of glucose inhibited MG102 by ∼70-80%, and addition of glucose to HD9 resulted in the loss of nearly all uptake. Thus, in the absence of glucose, Fps1p is responsible for, at most, 20-25% of the uptake of arsenic trioxide. The inhibition by glucose suggested that the majority of 73As(OH)3 uptake might be catalyzed by glucose permeases. To examine this possibility, FPS1 and ACR3 were disrupted in a strain lacking all known hexose permeases (13Wieczorke R. Krampe S. Weierstall T. Freidel K. Hollenberg C.P. Boles E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The resulting strain, HD300, exhibited only residual arsenic trioxide uptake that was insensitive to the presence of glucose (Fig. 1). Thus, inhibition must be the result of competitive uptake of As(OH)3 and glucose by one or more hexose permeases. The effect of glucose concentration on 73As(OH)3 was examined in strain HD100 (acr3Δ fps1Δ), which is isogenic with HD300 but has all of the hexose permeases (Fig. 2A). Half-maximal inhibition was observed with ∼5 mm glucose. Inhibition was greatest with hexoses, including glucose, galactose, fructose, and mannose (Fig. 2B). Neither the disaccharide sucrose nor the triose glycerol inhibited As(OH)3 uptake, although glycerol was shown to inhibit arsenic trioxide movement through Fps1p (4Liu Z. Shen J. Carbrey J.M. Mukhopadhyay R. Agre P. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6053-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). A small amount of inhibition was observed with the pentose xylose, but xylose can also be transported by some hexose permeases (8Hamacher T. Becker J. Gardonyi M. Hahn-Hagerdal B. Boles E. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2783-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Hxt1p, Hxt3p, Hxt4p, Hxt5p, Hxt7p, and Hxt9p Are Arsenic Trioxide Transporters—To deduce which hexose permeases are responsible for glucose-inhibitable arsenite trioxide accumulation, strain HD200 was constructed. HD200 is isogenic with HD100 but has only four hexose permeases: HXT3, HXT6, HXT7, and GAL2. When grown on galactose as a carbon source, only HXT6, HXT7, and GAL2 are expressed (14Boles E. Hollenberg C.P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 85-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The arsenic trioxide transport properties of HD200 were similar to those of HD100 (data not shown). Half-maximal inhibition by glucose was observed at ∼5 mm glucose. The hexoses (glucose, galactose, fructose, and mannose) inhibited As(OH)3 uptake but glycerol did not. Under these growth conditions, HXT3 is not expressed. Hxt6p and Hxt7p differ in only one residue (14Boles E. Hollenberg C.P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 85-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, it is likely that they have similar transport properties. These results suggest that Hxt6p, Hxt7p, and/or Gal2p transport arsenic trioxide. The ability of specific hexose transporters to catalyze the uptake of 73As(OH)3 was determined by the expression of HXT1, HXT3, HXT4, HXT5, HXT7, HXT9, and HXT10 genes under the control of constitutive promoters in strain HD300, which lacks all hexose transporters. Because HD300 is unable to grow on glucose as a carbon source, the ability of cells bearing plasmids with HXT genes to grow on glucose shows that the transporters were all functionally expressed. Expression of HXT10 in HD300 had no effect on 73As(OH)3 transport, suggesting it does not catalyze arsenic trioxide transport (data not shown). In contrast, when HXT1, HXT3, HXT4, HXT5, HXT7, or HXT9 was individually expressed in HD300, 73As(OH)3 transport was restored (data not shown). The arsenic trioxide transport properties of two of these, Hxt7p and Hxt9p, were examined in more detail. When grown in media containing 2% maltose, cultures of HD300 were able to grow at substantially higher concentrations of sodium arsenite than either HD300 YEpHXT7 or HD300 pTHHXT9, indicating that the uptake of arsenic trioxide by those two permeases confers arsenic sensitivity. Transport of 73As(OH)3 by Hxt7p was inhibited by glucose (Fig. 3A). Of the hexoses, glucose was the most effective inhibitor, suggesting that Hxt7p is more specific as a glucose permease (Fig. 3B). Because Hxt7p catalyzes arsenic trioxide transport, most likely the highly related Hxt6p does as well. Hxt9p and Hxt11p are closely related membrane proteins in which sequences differ at only two positions and are about 70% identical to Hxt7p (15Nourani A. Wesolowski-Louvel M. Delaveau T. Jacq C. Delahodde A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5453-5460Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These two proteins may be multidrug uptake systems, because disruption of either HXT9 or HXT11 confers resistance to cycloheximide and other drugs, and expression of either from a plasmid increased sensitivity. Although they transport glucose with low affinity, they are not induced by glucose but rather by their drug substrates through the Pdr1p and Pdr3p pleiotropic drug resistance transcription factors. To test whether these drug transporters could also transport the anticancer drug arsenic trioxide, HXT9 was expressed in HD300. Whereas the cells exhibited glucose-sensitive uptake, inhibition required considerably more glucose than either wild type yeast or HD300 YEpHXT7 (compare Fig. 4A with Figs. 2A and 3A). Glucose was a more effective inhibitor than galactose, mannose, or fructose (Fig. 4B). Thus, Hxt9p and (by extension) Hxt11p are arsenic trioxide transporters.Fig. 4Hxt9p catalyzes 73As(OH)3 transport. Transport was assayed in HD300 pTHHXT9.

Hxt9p is a multidrug transporter with only a low affinity for glucose and, physiologically, is probably not involved in glucose utilization (15Nourani A. Wesolowski-Louvel M. Delaveau T. Jacq C. Delahodde A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5453-5460Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 16Reifenberger E. Boles E. Ciriacy M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Their relative affinities for glucose are reflected in their affinity for arsenic trioxide. Hxt7p is a high affinity, low capacity As(OH)3 uptake system with a Km of ∼2mm and Vmax of ∼20 nmol/min/109 cells (Fig. 5A). Hxt9p has a lower affinity but higher capacity, with a Km of ∼10 mm and Vmax of ∼40 nmol/min/109 cells (Fig. 5B). The differences in relative affinities for glucose and arsenic trioxide explain why glucose appears to be a more effective inhibitor of arsenic trioxide uptake in HD300 YEpHXT7 than in HD300 pTH-HXT9. Consistent with these transport properties, cells expressing HXT7 were more sensitive to growth in the presence of sodium arsenite than those expressing HXT9 (data not shown). Glucose Uptake Is Inhibited by As(OH)3—The results above demonstrate that arsenic is transported by hexose permeases. If arsenic trioxide and glucose share a common translocation pathway, glucose uptake should also be inhibited by arsenic trioxide. When uptake of [14C]glucose was assayed in strain HD100, inhibition by arsenic trioxide was observed (Fig. 6). Inhibition was even more pronounced in the cells of HD300 YEpHXT7 (Fig. 6) or HD300 pTHHXT9 (data not shown). Because arsenic trioxide is paradoxically both an environmental toxin and a chemotherapeutic drug, knowledge of the pathways by which the metalloid is brought into cells could be useful both in preventing toxicity and in enhancing drug action. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, aquaglyceroporin channels facilitate downhill arsenite trioxide movement into cells (4Liu Z. Shen J. Carbrey J.M. Mukhopadhyay R. Agre P. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6053-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 5Sanders O.I. Rensing C. Kuroda M. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. J.

Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1391-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Here we report that glucose permeases represent the major pathways for arsenic trioxide uptake in S. cerevisiae. Under the growth conditions used for this study (basal salts medium with either galactose or maltose as a carbon source), wild type yeast cells use hexose permeases for ∼70% of the arsenic trioxide uptake and the aquaglyceroporin Fps1p for ∼20%. What catalyzes the residual uptake is not known. Which hexose permeases catalyze arsenic trioxide uptake? The family of hexose permeases in S. cerevisiae is surprisingly large, with 18 hexose transporters (Hxt1p to Hxt17p), Gal2p, as well as two glucose sensors, Snf3p and Rgt2p (14Boles E. Hollenberg C.P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 85-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These secondary carrier proteins, each of which has 12 putative transmembrane segments, belong to the major facilitator superfamily (17Marger M.D. Saier Jr., M.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 13-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Hexose transporters can be divided into two categories: low affinity transporters such as Hxt1p, Hxt3p, Hxt9p, and Hxt11p and high affinity transporters, such as Hxt6p, Hxt7p, and Gal2p, where the Km for glucose is about 1 mm (14Boles E. Hollenberg C.P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 85-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a strain lacking FPS1 and the genes for all 18 hexose permeases, there was only residual uptake of arsenic trioxide. The expression of HXT1, HXT3, HXT4, HXT5, HXT7, and HXT9 restored transport. Hxt6p is nearly identical to Hxt7p, and Hxt9p is nearly identical to Hxt11p; therefore, these are likely to catalyze arsenic trioxide uptake as well. Only HXT10 did not restore transport. Thus, it is possible that most if not all of the hexose permeases are also arsenic trioxide transporters. Moreover, the affinity of Hxt7p and Hxt9p for glucose was reflected in their affinity for arsenic trioxide; Hxt7p has a higher affinity for both glucose and As(OH)3 than does Hxt9p. This indicates that these proteins use the same catalytic mechanism for As(OH)3 as for sugars. That hexose permeases are capable of transporting arsenic trioxide is surprising. The fact that pentoses and disaccharides do not inhibit uptake indicates specificity. The neutral polyhydroxylated metalloid must have sufficient molecular similarity to substrates of aquaglyceroporins to go through the Fps1p channel, but in some way, As(OH)3 must also mimic a hexose but not other sugars. A search of the Cambridge Structural Data Base identified 109 oxo-bridged As-O-As compounds, including 10 with six-membered (As-O)3 rings. The crystal structure of arsenious oxide, As4O6, is also a six-membered (As-O)3 ring with the fourth As(III) coordinated to the three axial oxygens (18Hamson G.C. Stosick A.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1938; 60: 1814-1822Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). By extrapolation, we predict that arsenic trioxide can form a similar six-membered ring that would have molecular similarity to hexoses but not to pentoses or disaccharides (Fig. 7). What is the relevance of these findings to human health and disease? Arsenic exposure is associated with increased incidence of diabetes in many countries (19Tseng C.H. Tseng C.P. Chiou H.Y. Hsueh Y.M. Chong C.K. Chen C.J. Toxicol. Lett. 2002; 133: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this diabetogenic effect of arsenic is unknown, but it is conceivable that it is related to inhibition of glucose uptake by arsenic in drinking water. The related organic trivalent arsenical phenylarsine oxide has been shown to bind to and inhibit glucose transport in canine kidney cell lines (20Liebl B. Muckter H. Doklea E. Reichl F.X. Fichtl B. Forth W. Arch. Toxicol. 1995; 69: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 21Liebl B. Muckter H. Doklea E. Fichtl B. Forth W. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 1995; 27: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phenylarsine oxide has a more cytotoxic effect at low glucose concentrations, which has led to the suggestion that glucose can modulate the effects of arsenic (21Liebl B. Muckter H. Doklea E. Fichtl B. Forth W. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 1995; 27: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phenylarsine oxide specifically binds to and inhibits GLUT4 (the major insulin-dependent human glucose permease) from murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes (22Hoffman R.D. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14005-14011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Frost S.C. Schwalbe M.S. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Mouse GLUT4 is 95% identical to human GLUT4, both of which have a conserved Cys-Gly-Cys sequence, and vicinal cysteine pairs are known to react nearly irreversibly with trivalent arsenicals (22Hoffman R.D. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14005-14011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although Hxt7p is a homologue of GLUT4, the yeast protein does not have the conserved cysteine motif and requires high concentrations of arsenic trioxide to inhibit glucose uptake. Thus, arsenic trioxide is a competitive inhibitor of yeast glucose transport but an irreversible inhibitor of the mammalian permeases. The irreversible inactivation of glucose uptake could produce the diabetogenic effects of arsenic trioxide in countries such as Taiwan and Bangladesh (19Tseng C.H. Tseng C.P. Chiou H.Y. Hsueh Y.M. Chong C.K. Chen C.J. Toxicol. Lett. 2002; 133: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This suggests that the incidence of diabetes in those countries could be related to poor nutritional status and might be ameliorated by higher amounts of dietary hexoses."
https://openalex.org/W2007672298,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 is involved in causing cervical cancer. The E6 and E7 proteins of HPV 16 immortalize human keratinocytes and this is due, at least in part, to inactivation of the tumor suppressor proteins p53 and pRB. These tumor suppressor proteins also regulate the expression of pro- and antiangiogenic factors by cells. For this reason, experiments were conducted to determine whether the expression of E6 and E7 in primary keratinocytes alters the phenotype of these cells such that they express diminished levels of antiangiogenic factors and/or increased levels of proangiogenic factors. To avoid variances in experimental observations, pools of human foreskin keratinocytes from multiple sources were infected with recombinant retrovirus expressing HPV 16 E6 and E7 or control retrovirus. Gene array analysis, RT-PCR, ELISAs and Western blotting showed that in cells expressing HPV 16 E6 and E7, expression levels of two potent angiogenesis inhibitors, thrombospondin-1 and maspin, were lower compared to controls. Additionally, major angiogenesis inducers, interleukin-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), were increased relative to controls. VEGF can be produced as multiple splice variants, all of which are required for the formation of patent blood vessels. The expression of HPV 16 E6 and E7 in keratinocytes augmented expression of VEGF 121, 145, 165 and 189. These observations show that HPV 16 E6 and E7 alter the phenotype of primary keratinocytes, diminishing expression of inhibitors and increasing expression of inducers of angiogenesis. This altered phenotype may permit keratinocytes infected by HPV 16 to play a role in the progression of cancer by permitting tumors to acquire a blood supply permissive of growth and spread."
https://openalex.org/W2091713806,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the phosphate signal transduction pathway (PHO pathway) is known to regulate the expression of several phosphate-responsive genes, such as PHO5 and PHO84. However, the fundamental issue of whether cells sense intracellular or extracellular phosphate remains unresolved. To address this issue, we have directly measured intracellular phosphate concentrations by 31P NMR spectroscopy. We find that PHO5 expression is strongly correlated with the levels of both intracellular orthophosphate and intracellular polyphosphate and that the signaling defect in the Δpho84 strain is likely to result from insufficient intracellular phosphate caused by a defect in phosphate uptake. Furthermore, the Δphm1Δphm2, Δphm3, and Δphm4 strains, which lack intracellular polyphosphate, have higher intracellular orthophosphate levels and lower expression of PHO5 than the wild-type strain. By contrast, the Δphm5 strain, which has lower intracellular orthophosphate and higher polyphosphate levels than the wild-type strain, shows repressed expression of PHO5, similar to the wild-type strain. These observations suggest that PHO5 expression is under the regulation of intracellular orthophosphate, although orthophosphate is not the sole signaling molecule. Moreover, the disruption of PHM3, PHM4, or of both PHM1 and PHM2 in the Δpho84 strain suppresses, although not completely, the PHO5 constitutive phenotype by increasing intracellular orthophosphate, suggesting that Pho84p affects phosphate signaling largely by functioning as a transporter.

Inorganic phosphate is an essential nutrient needed in large amounts for nucleic acid and phospholipid biosynthesis, as well as for energy metabolism. It is therefore essential that organisms have appropriate regulatory mechanisms to respond and adapt rapidly to changes in phosphate availability (1Torriani-Gorini A. Silver S. Yagil E. Phosphate in Microorganisms: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington D. C.1994Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the phosphate signal transduction pathway (PHO pathway) regulates the expression of several phosphate-responsive genes that are involved in the scavenging and specific uptake of phosphate from extracellular sources, including PHO5, which encodes repressible acid phosphatase (rAPase), 1The abbreviations used are: rAPase, repressible acid phosphatase; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: rAPase, repressible acid phosphatase; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase. and PHO84, which encodes a high affinity phosphate transporter that acts in response to phosphate levels (2Oshima Y.

Under high phosphate conditions, the transcription factor Pho4p is phosphorylated by the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complex Pho80p-Pho85p (5Kaffman A. Herskowitz I. Tjian R. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1153-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (6Kaffman A. Rank N.M. O'Neill E.M. Huang L.S. O'Shea E.K. Nature. 1998; 396: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), thereby turning off expression of the PHO5 and PHO84 genes. When yeast cells are starved of phosphate, the CDK inhibitor Pho81p inactivates Pho80p-Pho85p (7Schneider K.R. Smith R.L. O'Shea E.K.

Biol. 1995; 15: 997-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, Pho4p is unphosphorylated and active (9Komeili A. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1999; 284: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), leading to the induction of PHO5 and PHO84 expression to scavenge phosphate from the environment (2Oshima Y. Genes Genet. Syst. 1997; 72: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 3Lenburg M.E. O'Shea E.K. Trends Biochem.

Although many components and the molecular mechanism of the PHO pathway have been extensively studied, fundamental questions, such as whether cells sense intracellular or extracellular phosphate and what phosphate metabolites function as signals for regulating this pathway, remain unanswered. A previous study demonstrated that disruption of PHO84 results in constitutive expression of PHO5 (10Bun-Ya M. Nishimura M. Harashima S. Oshima Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3229-3238Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), suggesting that a defect in phosphate uptake in the Δpho84 strain may lead to a lower level of intracellular phosphate (or another metabolite) that could serve as a regulation signal for the PHO pathway, which in turn would mimic the effects of phosphate starvation. A recent study has shown that the overexpression of other phosphate transporter genes, such as PHO87, PHO90, and PHO91, increases phosphate uptake ability and suppresses constitutive expression of PHO5 in the Δpho84 strain (11Wykoff D.D. O'Shea E.K. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1491-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because Pho87p, Pho90p, and Pho91p share no significant amino acid similarity with Pho84p, it seems unlikely that these transporters contain common signal-responsive domains similar to those of PHO84. It is therefore likely that the signaling defect of Δpho84 cells is suppressed by the increase in the intracellular phosphate level, suggesting that there is a sensing system for intracellular phosphate rather than for extracellular phosphate. There is, however, no experimental evidence showing that phosphate uptake ability accurately reflects the intracellular phosphate level; in addition, the possibility remains that each phosphate transporter possesses different signaling domains and thus has a role not only in phosphate transport but also in phosphate sensing and possibly in extracellular phosphate sensing. An example of a transporter that also functions as a sensor is Mep2p, an ammonium transporter that generates a signal to regulate filamentous growth in response to ammonium starvation, in addition to its role in ammonium uptake (12Lorenz M.C. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1236-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is known that several transporter-like transmembrane proteins that do not participate in nutrient uptake have nutrient-sensing activities (13Van Belle D. Andre B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Examples of such transporter-like homologues include Snf3p and Rgt2p, which share significant identity with hexose transporters but instead function as glucose sensors (14Ozcan S. Dover J.

Dominant gain-of-function mutations in SNF3 and RGT2 cause constitutive glucose-independent expression of HXT (14Ozcan S. Dover J. Rosenwald A.G. Wolfl S. Johnston M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12428-12432Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of hexose transporters cannot restore the signaling defect in Δsnf3 and Δrgt2 strains (17Coons D.M. Vagnoli P. Bisson L.F. Yeast. 1997; 13: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Ozcan S. Johnston M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 554-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and neither Snf3p nor Rgt2p can function as a glucose transporter (15Ozcan S. Dover J. Johnston M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2566-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 19Liang H. Gaber R.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1953-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), indicating that Snf3p and Rgt2p function solely as glucose sensors. In this report, we present evidence that the levels of intracellular orthophosphate and polyphosphate strongly correlate with the expression of PHO5 and that this expression is under the regulation of intracellular orthophosphate levels, although orthophosphate is not the only signal of phosphate availability. On the basis of our observations, we propose that the high affinity phosphate transporter Pho84p affects phosphate signaling mainly by functioning as a transporter.

This stationary phase culture was inoculated into a specified medium to give an A600 of 0.1 and cultivated with shaking at 30 °C until an A600 of 1.0 was reached. The rAPase activity was then measured as described previously (24Toh-e A. Ueda Y. Kakimoto S.I. Oshima Y. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 113: 727-738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 31P NMR Spectroscopy—Yeast strains grown to log phase in synthetic high phosphate medium were inoculated into 100 ml of a specified medium to give an A600 of 0.1 and cultivated at 30 °C until an A600 of 1.0 was reached. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation, and excess medium was removed to obtain a cell suspension volume of 0.5 ml. 31P NMR spectra were obtained at 202.496 MHz using a Bruker DRX-500 NMR spectrometer at 25 °C. The spectral width was 10 KHz. All spectra comprised a total of 512 scans, each with a 0.8-s acquisition time and a 1-s delay. Methylene diphosphonate was used as an internal reference with no apparent distortion of yeast metabolism. Intracellular phosphate concentration was estimated on the basis of the integrated area of the resonance relative to that of methylene diphosphonate. A haploid cell volume of 70 μm3 (25Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar) and a cell density of 1.85 × 107 cells/ml at an A600 of 1 were assumed. Polyphosphate concentration is given in terms of Pi residues. PHO5 Expression Is Strongly Correlated with the Levels of Intracellular Orthophosphate and Polyphosphate—To investigate whether the PHO pathway responds to the intracellular or extracellular phosphate level, we directly measured the intracellular phosphate concentration by 31P NMR spectroscopy, a noninvasive method for the analysis of in vivo intracellular phosphorus-containing metabolites, which has been extensively used in studies of phosphate metabolism in yeast (26Campbell-Burk S.L. Shulman R.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 595-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 27Navon G. Shulman R.G. Yamane T. Eccleshall T.R. Lam K.B. Baronofsky J.J. Marmur J.

Microbiol. 1983; 134: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We first focused on the Δpho84 strain, which is defective in phosphate signaling and therefore exhibits a phenotype of constitutive PHO5 expression even under high phosphate conditions (Fig. 1A). We found that in the Δpho84 strain grown in a phosphate-rich medium, both orthophosphate and polyphosphate, the major forms of intracellular phosphate in yeast (30Kulaev I.S. The Biochemistry of Inorganic Polyphosphates. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1979Google Scholar), were reduced to approximately one-half (14 and 98 mm, respectively) of the levels in the wild-type strain (23 and 230 mm, respectively) (Fig. 1B). It should be noted that the polyphosphate concentrations in this study are given in terms of phosphate residues, not polymer molecules, which are the relevant indicator of polyphosphate availability. To explore further the relationship between intracellular phosphate and PHO5 expression, we measured intracellular phosphate and rAPase activity in the wild-type strain grown in medium containing an initial phosphate concentration of 11 (high phosphate condition), 2.2, 0.88, 0.44, 0.22, 0.11, or 0.044 mm. At initial extracellular phosphate concentrations above 0.44 mm, intracellular orthophosphate and polyphosphate levels in the wild-type strain were constant at ∼25 and 210 mm, respectively (Fig. 2A), and no rAPase activity was detected (Fig. 2B). By contrast, when the initial extracellular phosphate concentrations were lower than 0.22 mm, the intracellular orthophosphate and polyphosphate levels markedly declined (Fig. 2A) and rAPase activity inversely increased in proportion to the intracellular phosphate concentration (Fig. 2B). These observations indicate that PHO5 expression is tightly coupled to both intracellular orthophosphate and intracellular polyphosphate over a range of extracellular phosphate levels and that PHO5 expression is derepressed when the intracellular phosphate levels are lower than a certain threshold (orthophosphate and polyphosphate concentrations of ∼25 and 210 mm, respectively). PHO5 Expression Is Under the Regulation of Intracellular Orthophosphate—To distinguish between the role of intracellular orthophosphate and that of intracellular polyphosphate in phosphate signaling, we measured intracellular orthophosphate and rAPase activity in the Δphm1Δphm2, Δphm3, and Δphm4 strains, which are defective in vacuolar polyphosphate accumulation (31Ogawa N. DeRisi J. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4309-4321Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Phm1p/Vtc2p, Phm2p/Vtc3p, Phm3p/Vtc4p, and Phm4p/Vtc1p are vacuolar membrane proteins that are involved in vacuolar polyphosphate accumulation (31Ogawa N. DeRisi J. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4309-4321Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) and function as regulators of vacuolar H+-ATPase activity and vacuolar transporter chaperones (32Cohen A. Perzov N. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26885-26893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In agreement with results from polyphosphate PAGE analysis (31Ogawa N. DeRisi J. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4309-4321Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), intracellular polyphosphate in the Δphm1Δphm2, Δphm3, and Δphm4 strains was undetectable by NMR analysis (data not shown). Interestingly, under both high phosphate (11 mm) and low phosphate (0.22 mm) conditions, intracellular orthophosphate levels were higher in these disruptants than in the wild-type strain (Fig. 3A). Next, we measured intracellular orthophosphate levels in the Δphm3 strain grown in an initial extracellular phosphate concentration of 11, 2.2, 0.88, 0.44, 0.22, 0.11, or 0.044 mm, as in Fig. 2. Under all of the phosphate conditions examined, the intracellular orthophosphate levels were higher in the Δphm3 strain than in the wild-type strain (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the defect in polyphosphate synthesis in the Δphm1Δphm2, Δphm3, and Δphm4 strains leads to an excess accumulation of intracellular orthophosphate. Despite the lack of polyphosphate, the disruptants exhibited repressible PHO5 expression, similar to the wild-type strain (Fig. 3C). Consistent with the increase in intracellular orthophosphate, the Δphm1Δphm2, Δphm3, and Δphm4 strains showed lower PHO5 expression than the wild-type strain grown under low phosphate conditions (Fig. 3C). When PHO5 expression was examined in more detail in the Δphm3 strain grown in phosphate concentrations lower than 0.22 mm, we found that PHO5 expression was lower in the Δphm3 strain than in the wild-type strain (Fig. 3D). These findings suggest that polyphosphate is not essential for PHO5 repression, at least under conditions of modestly elevated orthophosphate, and that orthophosphate is a more efficacious signaling molecule, further strengthening the idea that PHO5 expression is under the regulation of intracellular orthophosphate. Intracellular Orthophosphate Is Not the Only Signal of Phosphate Availability—To distinguish further between the role of intracellular orthophosphate and that of intracellular polyphosphate in phosphate signaling, we next examined intracellular orthophosphate and polyphosphate levels and rAPase activity in the Δphm5 strain, a disruptant of a gene encoding vacuolar endopolyphosphatase (33Sethuraman A. Rao N.N. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8542-8547Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), which has been shown to cause a significant increase in polyphosphate chain length (31Ogawa N. DeRisi J. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4309-4321Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). We anticipated that the Δphm5 strain may show an increase not only in polyphosphate chain length but also in polyphosphate quantities. If this is the case, it is possible that the intracellular orthophosphate level may decrease because most of the phosphate that has been taken up into the cells is stored as excess polyphosphate in the vacuole. In fact, when we measured intracellular orthophosphate and polyphosphate levels in this disruptant, we found that the Δphm5 strain grown in high phosphate medium had an intracellular polyphosphate level of ∼280 mm, which was 1.3-fold higher than that of the wild-type strain (Fig. 4). By contrast, the intracellular orthophosphate level of the Δphm5 strain was 12 mm: that is, one-half of the level of the wild-type strain (23 mm) (Fig. 4) and similar to that of the Δpho84 strain (14 mm) (Fig. 1B). If intracellular orthophosphate is the only signal for regulating the PHO pathway, PHO5 expression in the Δphm5 strain should be derepressed under high phosphate conditions. Under these conditions, however, PHO5 expression in the Δphm5 strain was repressed, similar to that in the wild-type strain (Fig. 4). These observations suggest that intracellular orthophosphate is not the only signal of phosphate availability and that another phosphate signal could be polyphosphate itself, although orthophosphate seems to be more efficient at repressing PHO5 expression. Alternatively, the authentic phosphate signal may be an as yet unidentified phosphate compound that in the Δphm5 strain is elevated to a level that is sufficient to compensate for the decrease in intracellular orthophosphate. Pho84p Affects Phosphate Signaling Mainly as a Transporter—The above results indicate that the Δpho84 strain, which exhibited constitutive PHO5 expression even under high phosphate conditions, has reduced levels of both intracellular orthophosphate and intracellular polyphosphate. To investigate whether Pho84p acts as a phosphate sensor in addition to its transporter function, we examined intracellular phosphate and PHO5 expression in the Δpho84Δphm1Δphm2, Δpho84Δphm3, and Δpho84Δphm4 strains. We assumed that deletion of PHM3, PHM4, or both PHM1 and PHM2 may suppress the constitutive expression of PHO5 in the Δpho84 strain by increasing intracellular orthophosphate. As expected, we found that the intracellular orthophosphate levels in the Δpho84Δphm1Δphm2, Δpho84Δphm3, and Δpho84Δphm4 strains (33, 25, and 30 mm, respectively) are 2-fold higher than in the Δpho84 strain (Fig. 5A) and that these strains do not accumulate polyphosphate (data not shown), similar to the Δphm1Δphm2, Δphm3, and Δphm4 strains. Interestingly, rAPase activity data revealed that the constitutive expression of PHO5 observed in the Δpho84 strain is suppressed in the Δpho84Δphm1Δphm2, Δpho84Δphm3, and Δpho84Δphm4 strains (Fig. 5B). The suppression of PHO5 expression in these disruptants is not complete, however, as these disruptants exhibit weak PHO5 expression under high phosphate conditions, although they contain higher intracellular phosphate levels than the wild-type strain. These results suggest that the signaling defect in the Δpho84 strain is a consequence of insufficient intracellular phosphate levels and that Pho84p functions mainly as a transporter in the PHO pathway, although a role as a sensor in phosphate signaling cannot be completely ruled out. The downstream events in the PHO pathway and the transcription control mechanisms of phosphate-responsive genes, such as PHO5, have been extensively studied; however, the initial events that take place in sensing phosphate availability are poorly understood. In this study, by using 31P NMR spectroscopy, we have shown that the expression of PHO5 is tightly correlated with the intracellular concentration of inorganic phosphate. We have also found that PHO5 expression is under the regulation of intracellular orthophosphate and that polyphosphate is dispensable for phosphate signaling, at least under conditions of modest orthophosphate elevation (Fig. 3). Intracellular orthophosphate is not the only signal of phosphate availability, however, because the Δphm5 strain, which has slightly elevated polyphosphate, but a reduced level of intracellular orthophosphate similar to that in the Δpho84 strain, shows normal repression of PHO5 (Fig. 4). Polyphosphate does not seem to be a direct signaling molecule of the PHO pathway because it is relatively ineffective as a repressing signal in comparison with orthophosphate. So what other candidates are there for a phosphate signaling molecule? If Phm5p, the vacuolar endopolyphosphatase, could also dephosphorylate other phosphate compounds, including one that is an authentic signaling molecule other than polyphosphate, then it is possible that a lack of PHM5 would also lead to an increase in the phosphorylation of this authentic signaling molecule. If this is the case, such an authentic signal could compensate for the reduced intracellular orthophosphate level observed in the Δphm5 strain. At present, however, polyphosphate is the only known substrate of Phm5p (33Sethuraman A. Rao N.N. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8542-8547Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In yeast, several examples of transporter-like nutrient sensors are known. Mep2p has been suggested to act as an ammonium sensor in addition to its role in ammonium uptake (12Lorenz M.C. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1236-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). By contrast, Snf3p and Rgt2p, which are glucose carrier homologues that do not directly support glucose transport, act as receptors for sensing glucose (14Ozcan S. Dover J. Rosenwald A.G. Wolfl S. Johnston M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12428-12432Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 15Ozcan S. Dover J. Johnston M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2566-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Our results show that deletion of PHM3, PHM4, or both PHM1 and PHM2 can suppress constitutive expression of PHO5 in the Δpho84 strain by increasing intracellular orthophosphate, suggesting that PHO84 affects phosphate signaling largely by its transporter function (Fig. 5). However, the suppression of PHO5 is incomplete in these disruptants, although they contain higher levels of intracellular orthophosphate than the wild-type strain (Fig. 5). Although this observation suggests that Pho84p may have activity for sensing extracellular phosphate availability, the intracellular phosphate sensing system would seem to be more effective than the extracellular system because increasing the intracellular orthophosphate level in the Δpho84 strain by deleting PHM3, PHM4, or both PHM1 and PHM2 suppressed the derepression of PHO5 almost completely. What, then, is the intracellular phosphate sensor? A possible candidate is the CDK inhibitor Pho81p. If this is the case, Pho81p would have to localize to the nuclear membrane to sense phosphate in the cytoplasm because it has been shown to localize to the nucleus under both high phosphate and low phosphate conditions (34Huang S. Jeffery D.A. Anthony M.D. O'Shea E.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6695-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). If Pho81p localizes to the nuclear lumen, but not to the nuclear membrane, the quantitative alteration of phosphate in nucleus should directly reflect that in the cytoplasm. On the other hand, a minimum domain of Pho81p containing 80 amino acids has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient to inhibit Pho80p-Pho85p CDK activity (34Huang S. Jeffery D.A. Anthony M.D. O'Shea E.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6695-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It seems unlikely, however, that such a small region of Pho81p is responsible not only for inhibiting Pho80p-Pho85p activity but also for sensing phosphate directly, by binding to phosphate itself. Taking these observations together, we do not favor the idea that Pho81p is a phosphate sensor. Further studies are necessary to identify the intracellular phosphate sensor(s). We thank Nobuo Ogawa for providing strains and Yukio Mukai for helpful suggestions."
https://openalex.org/W1996063901,"Little is known about the specific signaling roles of Rap2, a Ras family small GTP-binding protein. In a search for novel Rap2-interacting proteins by the yeast two-hybrid system, we isolated isoform 3 of the human mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP4K4), a previously described but uncharacterized isoform. Other isoforms of MAP4K4 in humans and mice are known as hematopoietic progenitor kinase (HPK)/germinal center kinase (GCK)-like kinase and Nck-interacting kinase, respectively. MAP4K4 belongs to the STE20 group of protein kinases and regulates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). MAP4K4 interacted with Rap2 through its C-terminal citron homology domain but did not interact with Rap1 or Ras. Interaction with Rap2 required the intact effector region of Rap2. MAP4K4 interacted preferentially with GTP-bound Rap2 over GDP-bound Rap2 in vitro. In cultured cells, MAP4K4 colocalized with Rap2, while a mutant MAP4K4 lacking the citron homology domain failed to do so. Furthermore, Rap2 enhanced MAP4K4-induced activation of JNK. These results suggest that MAP4K4 is a putative effector of Rap2 mediating the activation of JNK by Rap2."
https://openalex.org/W2064883199,"Oncogenic virus proteins often target to tumor suppressor p53 during virus life cycle. In the case of hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein, it has been shown to affect p53-dependent transcription. Here, we further characterized the in vitro and in vivo interactions between HCV core protein and p53 and showed that these two proteins colocalized in subnuclear granular structures and the perinuclear area. By use of a reporter assay, we observed that while low level of HCV core protein enhanced the transactivational activity of p53, high level of HCV core protein inhibited this activity. In both cases, however, HCV core protein increased the p53 DNA-binding affinity in gel retardation analyses, likely due to the hyperacetylation of p53 Lys(373) and Lys(382) residues. Additionally, HCV core protein, depending on its expression level, had differential effects on the Ser(15) phosphorylation of p53. Moreover, HCV core protein could rescue p53-mediated suppressive effects on both RNA polymerase I and III transcriptions. Collectively, our results indicate that HCV core protein targets to p53 pathway via at least three means: physical interaction, modulation of p53 gene regulatory activity and post-translational modification. This feature of HCV core protein, may potentially contribute to the HCV-associated pathogenesis."

Maemura K. Kanbara K. Tamayama T. Hayasaki H. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 213: 1-47Google Scholar). The ionotropic receptors GABAA and GABAC produce fast inhibitory synaptic transmission via an intrinsic chloride channel. GABAA receptors are pentamers composed of combinations of various subunits, with the most prevalent combination in the mammalian brain containing two α1 subunits, two β2 subunits, and one γ2 subunit (2Rudolph U. Crestani F. Mohler H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 188-194Google Scholar). GABAB receptors, in contrast, are metabotropic G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that mediate the slow inhibitory neurotransmission of GABA via the regulation of several effectors. GABAB receptors are believed to be heterodimeric combinations of two GPCRs, GABABR1 and GABABR2 (3Marshall F.H. Jones K.A. Kaupmann K. Bettler B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 396-399Google Scholar, 4Bowery N.G. Bettler B. Froestl W. Gallagher J.P. Marshall F. Raiteri M Bonner T.I. Enna S.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 247-264Google Scholar, 5Couve A. Moss S.J. Pangalos M.N. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 296-312Google Scholar). GABABR1, the first receptor to be cloned, was found to bind GABA with low affinity and couple much less efficiently to effectors than native GABAB receptors (6Kaupmann K. Huggel K. Heid J. Flor P.J. Bischoff S. Michael S.J. McMaster G. Angst C. Bittiger H. Froestl W. Bettler B. Nature. 1997; 386: 239-246Google Scholar). It was soon established that GABABR1, when expressed alone in heterologous systems, could not traffic efficiently to the cell surface but was rather retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) due to the presence of an ER retention motif on its intracellular C terminus (7Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 97-106Google Scholar, 8Pagano A. Rovelli G. Mosbacher J. Lohmann T. Duthey B. Stauffer D. Ristig D. Schuler V. Meigel I. Lampert C. Stein T. Prezeau L. Blahos J.

A second receptor, GABABR2, was subsequently cloned and found to be capable of trafficking to the cell surface by itself yet incapable of binding ligand or coupling to G proteins. When GABABR1 and GABABR2 were co-expressed in heterologous cells, they were found to form functional surface-expressed receptors with properties similar to those of some native GABAB receptors (9Jones K.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13362-13369Google Scholar), whereas GABABR2 is believed to be the primary G protein contact site (13Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Yan L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Despite the recent advances in the understanding of GABAB receptors at the molecular level, several puzzling facts remain. First, despite the apparent functional requirement for heterodimerization, GABABR1 is distributed in many regions of the brain (for example, the anterior pituitary and interneurons of the hippocampus) and periphery (uterus, spleen) that show no GABABR2 expression but have demonstrable GABA binding and responses (16Bianchi M.

Finally, numerous reports suggest that GABAB receptors participate in physiological cross-talk with other receptors through unknown mechanisms. Of particular note are functional interactions between GABAA and GABAB receptors in regulating each other's binding properties (23Kardos J. Kovacs I. Neuroreport. 1991; 2: 541-543Google Scholar, 24Kardos J. Elster L. Damgaard I. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. Schousboe A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 39: 646-655Google Scholar, 25Kardos J. Neurochem.

In recent years, heterodimerization of receptors has helped to explain some examples of pharmacological heterogeneity and cross-talk between other neurotransmitter receptors (30Devi L.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 10: 532-537Google Scholar, 31Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 409-435Google Scholar). For example, heterodimerization of κ and δ opioid receptors results in a new receptor with distinct pharmacological properties (32Jordan B.A. Devi L.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 697-700Google Scholar). Furthermore, physiologically important heterodimerization has been demonstrated not only between GPCRs, but also between GPCRs and ionotropic receptors. For example, GABAA receptors have been shown to physically interact with dopamine receptor 5 (33Liu F. Wan Q. Pristupa Z.B. Yu X.M. Wang Y.T. Niznik H.B. Nature. 2000; 403: 274-280Google Scholar), whereas NMDA-type glutamate receptors have been found to associate with dopamine receptor 1 (34Lee F.J. Xue S. Pei L. Vukusic B. Chery N. Wang Y. Wang Y.T. Niznik H.B. Yu X.M. Liu F. Cell. 2002; 111: 219-230Google Scholar, 35Fiorentini C. Gardoni F. Spano P. Di Luca M. Missale C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20196-20202Google Scholar), leading to mutual regulation of receptor function. We hypothesized that GABABR1 might potentially associate with other receptors and that this might account in part for certain aspects of GABAB receptor function that are not presently understood. This idea led us to screen a library of different receptors as possible trafficking partners for GABABR1. Surprisingly, these screens revealed that co-expression with the γ2S subunit of the GABAA receptor produced robust cell surface expression of GABABR1 in the absence of GABABR2. Furthermore, we found that there is a physical interaction between discrete regions of GABABR1 and the GABAA receptor γ2S subunit, and that this association has significant functional consequences for GABAB receptor trafficking and endocytosis.

HEK-293 cells were maintained in complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. For heterologous expression of receptors, 2–4 μg of cDNA was mixed with LipofectAMINE (15 μl), and Plus reagent (10 μl) (Invitrogen) and added to 5 ml of serum-free medium in 10-cm tissue cultures plates containing cells at 60–80% confluency. Following a 4-h incubation, 6 ml of fresh complete medium was added. After another 12–16 h incubation, the medium was changed again, and the cells were harvested 24 h later. Western Blotting—Samples (5 μg per lane) were run on 4–20% SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 180 V and then transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were blocked in “blot buffer” (2% non-fat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) for at least 30 min and then incubated with an appropriate primary antibody in blot buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed three times with 10 ml of blot buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences and Chemicon) in blot buffer. Finally, the blots were washed three more times with 10 ml of blot buffer and visualized via enzyme-linked chemiluminescence using the ECL kit from Amersham Biosciences or Pierce. Antibodies—The primary antibodies utilized were 12CA5 monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science), M2 monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), monoclonal anti-c-Myc 9E10 antibody (Sigma), anti-GABABR1 antibody, anti-GABABR2 antibody (Chemicon), anti-GABAAα1 antibody, anti-GABAAβ2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), and anti-GABAAγ2 antibody (Alpha Diagnostic International). Surface Expression Assay—HA-GABABR1 cDNA was transfected either alone or with other receptor cDNAs. Transfected HEK-293 cells were plated in 35-mm tissue culture plates at 80% confluency. 24 h later, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS/Ca2+ for 30 min and then blocked with “cell blocking buffer” (2% non-fat dry milk in PBS/Ca2+) for 30 min at room temperature. They were then incubated with a monoclonal 12CA5 anti-HA antibody for 1 h to detect the HA-GABABR1 on the cell surface. Following three washes (5 min) with cell blocking buffer, the cells were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. The cells were washed three times for 5 min with cell blocking buffer, twice with PBS, and then developed with 2 ml of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay SuperSignal Pico ECL from Pierce for exactly 15 s. Chemiluminescence of the whole 35-mm plate was quantified in a TD20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). For each data point, 3–5 dishes were averaged per experiment. The results were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Dunnett's post hoc tests where applicable (GraphPad Prism). For each transfection condition in each surface expression experiment, matching dishes of transfected cells were harvested and examined via Western blot to confirm the expression of the various receptors involved. Double Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with HA-GABABR1 alone, HA-GABABR1/FLAG-GABABR2, or HA-GABABR1/Myc-GABAAγ2S. Transfected cells were plated in slides, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with “saponin buffer” containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.04% saponin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with M2 monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), monoclonal anti-c-Myc 9E10 antibody (Sigma), and anti-GABABR1 antibody (Chemicon) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes (1 min) with saponin buffer, the cells were incubated with a rhodamine red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG at 1:200 dilution and FITC-conjugated anti-guinea pig IgG at 1:200 dilution (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes (1 min) with saponin buffer and one wash with PBS, coverslips were mounted, and rhodamine red-labeled FLAG-GABABR2 or Myc-GABAAγ2S and FITC-labeled HA-GABABR1 were visualized with a Zeiss LSM-510 laser confocal microscope. Multiple control experiments, utilizing either transfected cells in the absence of primary antibody or untransfected cells in the presence of primary antibody, revealed a very low level of background staining, indicating that the primary antibody-dependent immunostaining observed in the transfected cells was specific. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were harvested and lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and the protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Applied Science). The lysate was solubilized via end-over-end rotation at 4 °C for 30 min and clarified via centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. A small fraction of the supernatant was taken at this point and incubated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer in order to examine expression of proteins in the whole cell extract. The remaining supernatant was incubated with 4–8 μg of respective antibody and 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Oncogene) or 50 μl of beads covalently linked to anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma) or anti-HA antibodies (Covance) for 2 h with end-over-end rotation at 4 °C. After five washes with 1 ml of lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from the beads with 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blot analyses. GST Pull-down Assay—GABABR1 C terminus and truncations were prepared with a hexahistidine C-terminal tag via PCR amplification of full-length rat GABABR1 and subcloned into the pGEX-4T1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) using EcoRI and XhoI restriction enzymes. GST α1 ICL and GST β2 ICL were generous gifts from Cynthia Czajkowski (University of Wisconsin, Madison). GST γ2S ICL containing 86 amino acids was PCR-amplified from full-length γ2S construct and subcloned into pGEX-4T1 vector using EcoRI and XhoI restriction enzymes. Fusion proteins grown in E. coli were isolated and purified on glutathione-agarose beads. Aliquots of the fusion protein on beads were blocked 30 min with 1 ml of “BSA buffer” (3% BSA, 10 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) at 4 °C. Solubilized brain lysates or lysates from transfected HEK-293 cells were then incubated with the beads end-over-end at 4 °C overnight. Following three washes with 1 ml of BSA buffer, the proteins were eluted off the beads with sample buffer, resolved on SDS-PAGE gels, and analyzed via Western blot using appropriate antibodies. ERK Activation Assay—HEK-293 cells were transfected with HA-GABABR1 alone, HA-GABABR1/FLAG-GABABR2, HA-GABABR1/Myc-GABAAγ2S, or HA-GABABR1/GABAAα1β2γ2S. Transfected HEK-293 cells were plated in 35-mm tissue culture plates at 80% confluency and serum-starved overnight the day before the assay. The cells were stimulated with 100 μm baclofen, rinsed with ice-cold PBS/Ca2+, and lysed in 150 μl of sample buffer. The cell lysates were run on SDS-PAGE gels and then analyzed via Western blotting with anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK and anti-p44/42 MAPK antibodies (Cell Signaling). Electrophysiology—Stage V–VI oocytes were harvested from Xenopus laevis and prepared for injection. Single oocytes were injected within 24 h with 5 nl of cRNA prepared from cDNA using RNA Express kit (Ambion) (1 ng to 1 μg/μl per subunit) and were assayed functionally at least 2 days after cRNA injection. GABAA receptor-mediated currents were measured from oocytes perfused with “ND96/Ca2+” (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) in a recording chamber. Recordings were made using 2-electrode voltage clamp while holding the oocytes at -80 mV with borosilicate electrodes filled with 300 mm KCl. GABAA receptor currents were measured by perfusing GABA (Tocris) or GABA plus diazepam (Sigma) directly onto oocytes under clamp conditions. GIRK current measurement was made in an identical set up, but the recordings were made in “40K solution” (60 mm NaCl, 40 mm KCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 6 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and oocytes were clamped at a voltage of -100 mV. GABA (Tocris) or baclofen (Sigma) was dissolved in 40K solution and applied by bath superfusion. Electrophysiology Analysis—The current peaks were measured using mini-analysis (Synaptosoft) and analyzed with GraphPad Prism. All concentration-response data were fit by Equation 1, I=Imax×[L]n/[L]n×[EC50]n(Eq. 1) where I is the current response; Imax is the maximal current response; [L] is the drug concentration; EC50 is the drug concentration that evokes half-maximal current response; and n is the Hill coefficient. The diazepam potentiation of IGABA was defined as shown in Equation 2, P=[IGABA+diazepam/IGABA]-1(Eq. 2) where IGABA+diazepam is the current response in the presence of GABA and diazepam, and IGABA is the current evoked solely by GABA. Diazepam potentiation was measured at a low concentration (10 μm) of GABA (EC2–EC10). The results were statistically compared using unpaired t tests as required. Internalization Assay—HEK-293 cells were transfected with HA-GABABR1/FLAG-GABABR2 or HA-GABABR1/FLAG-GABABR2 + Myc-GABAAγ2S. Transfected cells were plated in 35-mm tissue culture plates at 80% confluency. On the day of the assay, the cells were stabilized at room temperature for 2 h and stimulated with 100 μm GABA for 30 min at room temperature, and the amount of GABABR1 on the cell surface was assayed in a manner identical to the surface expression assay described above. The GABAA Receptor γ2S Subunit Promotes GABABR1 Cell Surface Expression—To screen for potential interacting partners that might aid in trafficking GABABR1 to the plasma membrane, we used a cell surface expression assay that has been used previously to study GABABR1 plasma membrane expression (7Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 97-106Google Scholar). HA-tagged GABABR1 was sequentially co-expressed with various GPCRs and ionotropic receptors in HEK-293 cells, and the cell surface expression of GABABR1 was analyzed using a luminometer-based assay. In this assay, GABABR1 expressed alone showed barely detectable cell surface expression, whereas co-expression with GABABR2 yielded a nearly 40-fold increase in GABABR1 cell surface expression, as reported previously (3Marshall F.H. Jones K.A. Kaupmann K. Bettler B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 396-399Google Scholar, 7Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 97-106Google Scholar). GABABR1 was also co-expressed in these screens with 34 other GPCRs. In contrast to GABABR2, none of these receptors significantly facilitated GABABR1 surface expression. It has been reported previously that co-expression with the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR4 may (36Sullivan R. Chateauneuf A. Coulombe N. Kolakowski L.F.J. Johnson M.P. Hebert T.E. Ethier N. Belley M. Metters K. Abramovitz M. O'Neill G.P. Ng G.Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 460-467Google Scholar) or may not (8Pagano A. Rovelli G. Mosbacher J. Lohmann T. Duthey B. Stauffer D. Ristig D. Schuler V. Meigel I. Lampert C. Stein T. Prezeau L. Blahos J. Pin J.P. Froestl W. Kuhn R. Heid J. Kaupmann K. Bettler B. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1189-1202Google Scholar) have a modest effect on GABABR1 surface expression, but our studies consistently revealed no effect of any of the mGluR subtypes on trafficking of GABABR1 to the cell surface. Similarly, co-expression with the NMDA-type glutamate receptor subunits NR1 and -2A also failed to enhance the surface expression of GABABR1. Strikingly, however, co-expression with either the γ2S subunit of the GABAA receptor or the entire GABAA receptor complex composed of α1, β2, and γ2S subunits increased the surface expression of GABABR1 by ∼15–20-fold (Fig. 1). Because co-expression with the α1 and β2 subunits alone had no effect on GABABR1 surface expression, these results revealed that the γ2S subunit is capable of trafficking GABABR1 to the cell surface in the absence of GABABR2. The surprising effect of γ2S subunit co-expression on GABABR1 plasma membrane trafficking was confirmed via immunocytochemistry. HEK-293 cells were transfected with either (i) GABABR1 alone, (ii) differentially tagged GABABR1 and GABABR2, or (iii) differentially tagged GABABR1 and GABAA receptor γ2S subunit. The receptors were labeled with specific fluorescent antibodies and visualized via confocal microscopy. These co-localization studies revealed that GABABR1 was diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm when expressed alone (Fig. 2, A–C) but found predominantly at the plasma membrane when co-expressed with GABABR2 (Fig. 2, D–F). Remarkably, a similar localization of GABABR1 to the plasma membrane was observed following co-expression with the γ2S subunit (Fig. 2, G–I). These data confirm that the GABAA receptor γ2S subunit can mimic GABABR2 in its ability to promote the trafficking of GABABR1 to the cell surface and furthermore show that the γ2S subunit and GABABR1 are co-localized in the plasma membrane when co-expressed in HEK-293 cells. GABAB Receptors and GABAA Receptor Subunits Physically Associate in Transfected Cells and Native Brain Tissue—The profound enhancement of GABABR1 surface expression induced by co-expression with the GABAA receptor γ2S subunit suggested that there might be a physical interaction between these two proteins. This possibility was examined via co-immunoprecipitation experiments. As shown in Fig. 3A, GABABR1 was robustly co-immunoprecipitated with the γ2S subunit from transfected HEK-293 cell lysates, revealing that the two proteins can indeed associate in a cellular context. The potential interactions of other GABAA receptor subunits with GABABR1 were also examined. It was found that GABABR1 could be co-immunoprecipitated from transfected HEK-293 cell lysates with α1 subunits (Fig. 3B) but not with β2 subunits (Fig. 3C). Moreover, GABABR1 was still found to associate with γ2S and α1 subunits even in the presence of GABABR2. Similarly, GABABR2 could be co-immunoprecipitated with γ2S and α1 subunits but not with β2 subunits (Fig. 3, A–C, bottom panels) both in the presence and absence of GABABR1. We also conducted reverse experiments to see whether GABAA receptors were co-immunoprecipitated with GABABR1. As shown in Fig. 3D, immunoprecipitation of FLAG-GABABR1 from cells transfected with α1β2γ2S resulted in robust co-immunoprecipitation of all of the GABAA receptor subunits. The extent of α1 subunit co-immunoprecipitation with GABABR1 was similar for α1 alone (10th lane) versus α1β2 (9th lane) versus α1β2γ2S (8th lane). These data suggest that both GABABR1 and GABABR2 can associate with functional GABAA receptor pentamers as well as with the individual subunits α1 and γ2S. Finally, we examined the potential association of endogenous GABAB receptors and GABAA receptor γ2 subunits in native brain tissue. As shown in Fig. 3E, GABAB receptors were strongly co-immunoprecipitated with γ2 subunits from solubilized rat brain lysates, demonstrating that GABAB receptors and GABAA receptor γ2 subunits form complexes not only in transfected cells but also in native brain tissue. GABABR1 Surface Expression Is Promoted by γ2S but Not α1β2 or γ2L Subunits—The co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that both α1 and γ2S subunits can associate with GABABR1. These findings were somewhat surprising, because our initial screens had indicated that the α1 subunit was unable to promote GABABR1 trafficking to the plasma membrane. One potential explanation for this result could be that the α1 subunit cannot traffic GABABR1 to the cell surface because it cannot access the cell surface by itself. It"

Proteins that interact with ALK tyrosine kinase play important roles in mediating downstream cellular signals, and are potential targets for novel therapies. Using a functional proteomic approach, we determined the identity of proteins that interact with the ALK tyrosine kinase by co-immunoprecipitation with anti-ALK antibody, followed by electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). A total of 46 proteins were identified as unique to the ALK immunocomplex using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, while 11 proteins were identified in the NPM immunocomplex. Previously reported proteins in the ALK signal pathway were identified including PI3-K, Jak2, Jak3, Stat3, Grb2, IRS, and PLCγ1. More importantly, many proteins previously not recognized to be associated with NPM-ALK, but with potential NPM-ALK interacting protein domains, were identified. These include adaptor molecules (SOCS, Rho-GTPase activating protein, RAB35), kinases (MEK kinase 1 and 4, PKC, MLCK, cyclin G-associated kinase, EphA1, JNK kinase, MAP kinase 1), phosphatases (meprin, PTPK, protein phosphatase 2 subunit), and heat shock proteins (Hsp60 precursor). Proteins identified by MS were confirmed by Western blotting and reciprocal immunoprecipitation. This study demonstrates the utility of antibody immunoprecipitation and subsequent peptide identification by tandem mass spectrometry for the elucidation of ALK-binding proteins, and its potential signal transduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2079796780,"Agonist-induced translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes is mediated by receptors for the activated form of the kinase, shuttling it from one intracellular site to another and enhancing its catalytic activity. It is however unknown whether the receptors themselves are anchored to certain intracellular structures prior to their engagement with PKC. We show here sequestering of receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) to the cytoskeleton through the cytoskeletal linker protein plectin during the initial stages of cell adhesion. We found that upon PKC activation, RACK1 was released from the cytoskeleton and transferred to the detergentsoluble cell compartment, where it formed an inducible triple complex with one of the PKC isozymes, PKCδ, and with plectin. In plectin-deficient cells the cytoskeleton-associated RACK1 fraction was reduced, and the protein was found predominantly at sites to which it normally translocated upon PKC activation. Concomitantly, dislocation of PKCδ and elevated enzymatic activity were observed in these cells. PKCδ was also more rapidly degraded, likely due to its overactivation. We propose a previously unrecognized function of plectin as cytoskeletal regulator of PKC signaling, and possibly other signaling events, through sequestration of the scaffolding protein RACK1. Agonist-induced translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes is mediated by receptors for the activated form of the kinase, shuttling it from one intracellular site to another and enhancing its catalytic activity.

We propose a previously unrecognized function of plectin as cytoskeletal regulator of PKC signaling, and possibly other signaling events, through sequestration of the scaffolding protein RACK1. Plectin is a versatile high molecular weight (>500,000) cytolinker protein. It can bind to all major cytoskeletal filament networks and it plays an important role as mechanical linker and anchoring protein of intermediate filaments (IFs). 1The abbreviations used are: IF, intermediate filaments; PKC, protein kinase C; RACK1, receptor for activated C kinase; EBS-MD, epidermolysis bullosa simplex with muscular dystrophy; FACs, focal adhesion contacts; mAb, monoclonal antibody; co-IP, co-immunoprecipitation; EGF, epidermal growth factor; IGF-IR, insulin-like growth factor I receptor; PMA, 4-phorbol-12-β-myristate-13-acetate; H1, histone 1; MyBP, myelin basic protein; PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis-(ethanesulfonic acid); DTT, dithiothreitol. Several of a series of specific binding partners of plectin identified are constituents of the subplasma membrane protein skeleton or of junctional membrane complexes, such as integrin β4, spectrin/fodrin, and desmoplakin, suggesting that the protein provides a linkage between the cytoskeleton and the cell periphery (1Wiche G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2477-2486Google Scholar). The crucial role of plectin as a stabilizing element of cells became clearly evident when plectin deficiency due to genetic disorders was found to be the cause for EBS-MD, an autosomal recessive skin blistering disease combined with muscular dystrophy (2Rouan F. Pulkkinen L. Meneguzzi G. Laforgia S. Hyde P. Kim D.U. Richard G. Uitto J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2000; 114: 381-387Google Scholar), and when a corresponding phenotype was described in plectin knockout mice (3Andra K. Lassmann H. Bittner R. Shorny S. Fassler R. Propst F. Wiche G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3143-3156Google Scholar). A new and at first sight paradoxical aspect of plectin function was revealed when dermal fibroblasts isolated from plectindeficient mice were examined. After short term adhesion these cells developed increased numbers of focal adhesion contacts (FACs) and of actin stress fibers, and failed to show the characteristic rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton in response to extracellular stimuli (4Andra K. Nikolic B. Stocher M. Drenckhahn D. Wiche G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3442-3451Google Scholar). Thus instead of favoring the formation of stable adhesion complexes, as one could have expected based on its stabilizing effect on hemidesmosomal junctions (3Andra K. Lassmann H. Bittner R. Shorny S. Fassler R. Propst F. Wiche G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3143-3156Google Scholar), plectin appeared to destabilize actin filaments. These data indicated that plectin does not just serve as a mechanical linker of different structural elements, but plays also a role in their dynamic rearrangements. One possible mechanism how plectin may perform such a diversity of functions could be through the scaffolding of different signaling molecules. Its enormous surface area and multidomain structure would facilitate such a task (5Janda L. Damborsky J. Rezniczek G.A. Wiche G. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 1064-1069Google Scholar). In fact, we recently found an association of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Fer with plectin's N-terminal globular domain and an elevation of Fer kinase activity in the absence of plectin (6Lunter P.C. Wiche G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 904-910Google Scholar). Furthermore, the finding of a high affinity interaction between an N-terminal plectin peptide (residues 95–117) to Siah, an ubiquitin E3 ligase, opened up a potentially new regulatory role of plectin in the selective degradation of proteins (7House C.M. Frew I.J. Huang H.L. Wiche G. Traficante N. Nice E. Catimel B. Bowtell D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3101-3106Google Scholar). To test more rigorously the idea of plectin functioning as a platform for the assembly of signaling proteins we screened a cDNA library in the yeast two-hybrid system for new interaction partners of plectin and selected for further analysis those with well-established roles in signaling. One of them was RACK1, the receptor for activated C kinase. RACK1, originally described as a 36-kDa homologue of the G protein β-subunit, has been identified as an anchoring protein for protein kinase C (PKC) (8Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Defects in the PKC anchoring system due to alterations in RACK1 have been implicated in the process of aging (9Battaini F. Pascale A. Paoletti R. Govoni S. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 410-415Google Scholar), in the development of heart hypertrophy (10Pass J.M. Gao J. Jones W.K. Wead W.B. Wu X. Zhang J. Baines C.P. Bolli R. Zheng Y.T. Joshua I.G. Ping P. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 281: H2500-2510Google Scholar), and in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (11Battaini F. Pascale A. Lucchi L. Pasinetti G.M. Govoni S. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 159: 559-564Google Scholar). As a plectin-binding protein RACK1 would be an ideal candidate for linking constituents of various signaling pathways to the cytoskeleton, ensuring efficient transmission of signals to cytoskeleton remodeling machineries. Comprising seven WD motif repeats RACK1 has been proposed to form a seven-bladed propeller structure providing multiple protein docking sites (12McCahill A. Warwicker J. Bolger G.B. Houslay M.D. Yarwood S.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1261-1273Google Scholar). Indeed, a variety of interacting proteins has been identified, among them Src kinase (13Chang B.Y. Chiang M. Cartwright C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20346-20356Google Scholar), and integrins (14Liliental J. Chang D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2379-2383Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of RACK1 in fibroblasts led to a pheno-type very similar to that of plectin-deficient cells, namely enhanced cell spreading, increased numbers of stress fibers and FACs, and decreased cell migration (Ref. 15Cox E.A. Bennin D. Doan A.T. O'Toole T. Huttenlocher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 658-669Google Scholar and references therein). We report here that plectin forms an EGF-inducible complex with RACK1 and PKC in the soluble compartment of cells. Examining plectin-null cells, we show that the activity and degradation of PKCδ is increased in the absence of plectin and that there is a significant decrease in the level of cytoskeleton-associated RACK1. On the other hand, we observed a dramatic accumulation of RACK1 at the periphery of plectin-deficient cells, similar to the phenotype observed in wild-type cells upon activation with EGF, adhesion on fibronectin, or overexpression of RACK1. Based on this we propose a model where plectin acts as a cytoskeletal platform for PKC and other signaling proteins through sequestration of the scaffold protein RACK1. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The LexA-based yeast two-hybrid system was used according to the user manual (Clontech). A genomic intron-less DNA fragment corresponding to mouse plectin C-terminal amino acids 4235–4560 was generated by restriction enzyme digestion of a lambda clone isolated from a mouse genomic library. This fragment was cloned in frame to the LexA coding sequence to obtain the bait plasmid, pLexA-ple R5–6. The plasmid was sequenced and correct expression confirmed by immunoblotting analysis of yeast cell lysates using anti-pLexA antiserum (data not shown). pLexA-ple R5–6, showing no autonomous activation, and a 19-day-old embryo cDNA library in yeast expression vector pJG4–5 was introduced into yeast strain EGY48. Transformants were amplified, and positive clones selected following the protocol recommended in the user manual. Out of 16 positively identified clones, one showed 99% identity to a mouse cDNA sequence corresponding to its C-terminal part (amino acids 173–317) of RACK1. Cell Cultures and Antibodies—Human adenocarcinoma SW13(-/-) cells, a cell line lacking vimentin filaments, were a kind gift of Dr. Robert Evans (University of Colorado, Boulder). Mouse dermal fibroblasts were derived from plectin wild type(+/+)/p53(-/-) and plectin knockout(-/-)/p53(-/-) mice, as previously described (16Andra K. Kornacker I. Jorgl A. Zorer M. Spazierer D. Fuchs P. Fischer I. Wiche G. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 189-197Google Scholar), and used at passage numbers 10–15. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were seeded at 8 × 104 cells/cm2 except for low density cultures (3 × 104 cells/cm2). For immunoblotting the following primary and secondary antibodies were used: mouse mAb to RACK1 (Transduction Laboratories; 1:2500), mouse mAb to PKCs (Sigma; 1:500), mouse mAb to PKCδ (Transduction Laboratories; 1:500), phospho-PKC kit 9921 (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.; all 1:1000), anti-plectin antiserum 9 (1:6000) (16Andra K. Kornacker I. Jorgl A. Zorer M. Spazierer D. Fuchs P. Fischer I. Wiche G. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 189-197Google Scholar), mouse antiplectin mAb 10F6 (1:5) (3Andra K. Lassmann H. Bittner R. Shorny S. Fassler R. Propst F. Wiche G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3143-3156Google Scholar), goat anti-rabbit IgG (Promega; 1:3000), goat anti-mouse IgG (Promega; 1:3000), and donkey anti-mouse IgM (Jackson; 1:15000), all conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, or goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson; 1:5000), goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson; 1:20000), and donkey anti-mouse IgM (Jackson; 1:3000), all conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. For immunofluorescence microscopy anti-plectin antiserum 46 (1:400) (16Andra K. Kornacker I. Jorgl A. Zorer M. Spazierer D. Fuchs P. Fischer I. Wiche G. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 189-197Google Scholar), and mAb to RACK1 (1:150) were used as primary antibodies, and goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes; 1:750), goat anti-mouse IgG Texas Red (Jackson; 1:200), and donkey anti-mouse IgM Texas Red (Jackson; 1:50) as secondary antibodies. Preparation and Analysis of Cell Lysates and Cell Fractions—After 2 or 24 h of adhesion, cells were incubated (see text for specifications) with or without EGF (Sigma), or PMA (LC Laboratories), and then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed directly with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm DTT, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol (sample buffer). For comparative quantitation of proteins and phosphoepitopes, aliquots of cell lysates containing equal amounts of total proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and, after immunoblotting using peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies, protein bands were visualized by exposure to x-ray film. Several exposures for different time periods were carried out. The bands were then scanned and quantified using Quantiscan software. Values obtained were plotted against corresponding exposure times to establish the range of signal linearity. For quantitative comparisons only band intensities falling into these linear ranges were used. For cellular fractionation a digitonin-based extraction protocol (17Ramsby M.L. Makowski G.S. Khairallah E.A. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 265-277Google Scholar) was used with some modifications. Cells were scraped into phosphate-buffered saline, collected by centrifugation at 1000 rpm at 4 °C (Mega-fuge), gently resuspended in 300 μl of ice-cold 0.01% digitonin, 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 300 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm Na3VO4, and incubated with end-over-end agitation for 10 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation (15,800 × g, 1 min) the cytosolic supernatant fraction was collected, the pellet resuspended in 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 300 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DTT, and protease inhibitor mixture (as above). After 20 min of end-over-end agitation, the suspension was centrifuged at 15,800 × g for 1 min to obtain membrane (supernatant), and cytoskeleton (pellet) fractions. Aliquots of fractions were dissolved in sample buffer. Caveolin was used as a membrane marker for fractionation (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Confluent cultures of SW13 (-/-) cells were treated with 1 ng/ml EGF for 30 min or left untreated. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were scraped into 50 mm HEPES/HCl, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.5 mg/ml DNase I (Roche Applied Science), 0.2 mg/ml RNase A (Serva), and protease inhibitor mixture (as above). Lysed cell suspensions were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with agitation, and subsequently the concentration of Triton X-100 was increased to 1% and SDS added to 0.1%, with further incubation for 5 min at room temperature to solubilize proteins. Lysates were centrifuged (15,800 × g, 20 min) and supernatants pre-cleared by incubation (1 h) with 60 μl of 10% protein A (Amersham Biosciences), or protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma). Prior to addition of antibodies, protein concentrations were measured in all supernatants (Bradford) and set to similar values. Either 5 μl of mAb to PKCs, 150 μl of hybridoma supernatant containing mAbs to plectin 10F6, 3 μl of anti-plectin antiserum 9, or the corresponding preimmune serum were added and incubations carried out for 3 h. Antibody-antigen complexes were recovered by incubation with 60 μl of 10% protein A or protein G-Sepharose beads for 3 h, extensively washed, and dissolved in sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and visualized by immunoblotting as described (16Andra K. Kornacker I. Jorgl A. Zorer M. Spazierer D. Fuchs P. Fischer I. Wiche G. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 189-197Google Scholar). A similar protocol was followed for immunoprecipitation of plectin from cytosolic and membrane fractions of mouse p53(-/-)/ple(+/+) or ple(-/-) fibroblast cells. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Mouse p53(-/-)/ple(+/+) or ple(-/-) fibroblasts were seeded at low density, grown overnight in plastic dishes, harvested in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate (Na4O7P2), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, protease inhibitor mixture (as above), and Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitor mixture mix (Sigma)(solution A), and passed several times through a 27-gauge needle. After centrifugation (15,800 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined and set to similar values. 2.0 μg of mAb to PKCδ were added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 60 μl of 10% protein G-Sepharose beads and further incubation for 2 h. After washing extensively with solution A, followed by 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture mix (solution B), the immune complexes were resuspended in 30 μl of solution B supplemented with 1 mm DTT, 100 μm ATP, 5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP, 140 μm phosphatidylserine, 3.8 μm diacylglycerol, and either 1 μg histone 1 (H1), or 0.8 μg myelin basic protein (MyBP). Reactions carried out for 20 min at 30 °C were stopped by the addition of sample buffer. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were subjected to immunoblotting using mAb to PKC. Incorporated radioactivity was visualized by autoradiography. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown on plastic surfaces, fixed via methanol at -20 °C, and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy as described (18Wiche G. Gromov D. Donovan A. Castanon M.J. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 607-619Google Scholar). Bound antibodies were visualized using a LSM 510 laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss). Identification of RACK1 as a Plectin-interacting Protein— The yeast two-hybrid screening of a 19-day-old embryo cDNA library, using a C-terminal domain of plectin (Ple-R5–6, see Fig. 1) as bait, revealed 16 positive clones. All of them were sequenced and compared with GenBank™ sequences using a BLAST search. One of the cDNA clones showed 99% sequence homology at the nucleotide level to RACK1, the receptor for activated C kinase. RACK1 has been shown to consist of seven WD repeats, which are structurally similar to the G protein β-subunit. The isolated clone encoded WD repeats 3–7 of RACK1. Another plectin-binding partner identified in the yeast two hybrid screening was extra-embryonic endodermal cytokeratin type II (19Nozaki M. Murata K. Morita T. Matsushiro A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 890-894Google Scholar), which was not unexpected considering that the bait protein used included plectin's C-terminal IF-binding site (1Wiche G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2477-2486Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). EGF-dependent Association of Endogenous RACK1 and PKCδ with Plectin—To confirm plectin-RACK1 binding using an alternative assay and to assess the functional significance of this interaction in mammalian cells, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments were performed from SW13 vim(-/-) cell lysates. This type of cells was chosen, because due to its lack of IF expression plectin was expected to be relatively soluble. Furthermore, since the association of RACK1 with some of its binding partners has been reported to be inducible by activators of PKC, the experiments were performed using cells untreated or treated with the (indirect) PKC activator EGF. As shown by immunoblotting, plectin could be pulled down from cell lysates in a specific manner using either an antiserum or anti-plectin mAb 10F6 in combination with A or G Sepharose beads (Fig. 2A, lanes 1, 2, and 5). RACK1 was found associated with plectin immunocomplexes when cells had been pretreated with EGF, whereas with untreated cells no co-precipitation was observed (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 2 and 6 with 1 and 5). Since RACK1 had previously been shown to bind activated C kinase, we also analyzed co-sedimentation of PKC using a mAb immunoreactive with all three of the classical (Ca2+-dependent) PKC isozymes, α, β, and γ. Similar to RACK1, PKC was found associated with the plectin-RACK1 complex upon EGF treatment of cells, but not in untreated cells (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 2 and 6 with 1 and 5). The PKC band detected in plectin immunoprecipitates was of similar size as the one observed in anti-PKC immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 2 and 6 with lane 9). No detectable PKC and negligible amounts of RACK1 were precipitated in controls with corresponding preimmune serum in combination with Sepharose A or G beads alone (Fig. 2, B and C, lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8). Thus EGF caused the selective association of a RACK1/PKC complex with plectin. This scenario resembled RACK1 interactions with different integrin β-chains (14Liliental J. Chang D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2379-2383Google Scholar) and insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) (20Hermanto U. Zong C.S. Li W. Wang L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2345-2365Google Scholar), both of which were initially discovered in yeast and then shown to be inducible in mammalian cells by PKC activation (with growth factors or PMA). Plectin Deficiency Leads to Increased Degradation of PKCδ in Mouse Fibroblasts—RACK1 has been shown to enhance the activity of PKC presumably by stabilizing its active conformation (8Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 21Ron D. Jiang Z. Yao L. Vagts A. Diamond I. Gordon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27039-27046Google Scholar). Having found that plectin associates with the PKC/RACK1 complex upon activation, next we examined whether plectin deficiency had any effects on PKC activity. For this, we used plectin (ple)-deficient (-/-) mouse fibroblasts, derived from plectin-null mice, and plectin-positive (+/+) control cells (3Andra K. Lassmann H. Bittner R. Shorny S. Fassler R. Propst F. Wiche G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3143-3156Google Scholar, 4Andra K. Nikolic B. Stocher M. Drenckhahn D. Wiche G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3442-3451Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of PKC isozymes β (22Edwards A.S. Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6461-6468Google Scholar) and δ (23Li W. Zhang J. Bottaro D.P. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24550-24555Google Scholar) has been shown to be a prerequisite for their full catalytic activity or, in the case of PKCα, to be important for the duration of the activation (24Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Google Scholar). Therefore, we first compared the autophosphorylation levels of PKCα and PKCδ, two of the major PKC isozymes expressed in fibroblasts (25Borner C. Nichols Guadagno S. Fabbro D. Weinstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12892-12899Google Scholar), that both have been reported to be associated with RACK1 (12McCahill A. Warwicker J. Bolger G.B. Houslay M.D. Yarwood S.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1261-1273Google Scholar, 20Hermanto U. Zong C.S. Li W. Wang L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2345-2365Google Scholar). In these experiments cell extracts prepared from ple(+/+) and ple(-/-) mouse fibroblasts were subjected to immunoblotting using PKCα/βII (p-Thr638/641) and PKCδ (p-Ser643) autophosphorylation site-specific antibodies. Interestingly, we found that without any treatment of cells, autophosphorylation of PKCδ at Ser643 was higher in ple(+/+) compared with ple(-/-) cells, especially at low cell density (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2), whereas PKCα/βII autophosphorylation was unaltered (data not shown). A lower PKCδ-specific signal in ple(-/-) compared with (+/+) cells was also observed using PKCδ-specific mAbs that did not distinguish between the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of the kinase (Fig. 3A, PKCδ), suggesting that the protein level of PKCδ was reduced in plectin-deficient cells. This reduction was particularly prominent in lysates from low-density cultures and after short term (2 h) adhesion, as revealed after normalization of the measured PKC signal intensities to tubulin levels (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 1, 2 and 3, 4 with 5, 6, respectively). After EGF activation a decrease of PKCδ protein levels (compared with no treatment) was observed in both plectin (+/+) and (-/-) cells (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 5–8, 11, 12). However, while after prolonged (30 min) EGF induction wild type cells exhibited only a marginal decrease in PKCδ levels, ple(-/-) cells showed a dramatic reduction (Fig. 3, A and B; lanes 7, 8, 11, 12). A 10 min-treatment with 2 μm of the more specific PKC activator PMA caused a similarly dramatic reduction of PKCδ in both ple (+/+) and (-/-) cells (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 9, 10). At a lower dosage (0.1 μm), PMA acted like EGF, leading to higher degradation of PKC in ple(-/-) compared with (+/+) cells (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 13, 14). On the other hand, as revealed by the ratio of autophosphorylated PKCδ to total PKCδ, the increases in specific autophosphorylation of PKCδ upon activation with either EGF or PMA was more prominent in lysates from ple(-/-) cells than in those from (+/+) cells (Fig. 3C, lanes 7, 8, 11–14). Although PKCδ levels revealed by PKCδ-specific antibodies were very low after chronic PMA stimulation (signals becoming detectable only after prolonged exposure times) (Fig. 3B, lanes 9, 10), strong bands were detected with anti-phospho-Ser643 antibodies, indicating a much higher level of specific autophosphorylation under these compared with other conditions (Fig. 3A, lanes 9, 10). Comparable results were obtained when in a similar series of experiments antibodies specific to phospho-Thr505 (another phosphoepitope indicative of the PKCδ activated state) were used instead of anti-Ser643 antibodies (data not shown). Both, ple(+/+) and (-/-) cells exhibited similar RACK1 protein levels, which were not significantly altered upon treatments of cells with different stimuli, or at distinct states of cell confluency (Fig. 3A, RACK1). Together, these results suggested increased degradation of PKCδ in ple(-/-) cells, especially in subconfluent cultures and upon short time of adhesion. The notion that reduced PKCδ protein levels in untreated ple(-/-) cells were a consequence of increased degradation of the enzyme was supported by the observation that the degradation process, which normally occurs upon exposure to activating stimuli like EGF or PMA (26Olivier A.R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2758-2763Google Scholar), was speeded up in these cells in an uncontrolled way, leading to dramatically reduced levels of the enzyme after prolonged exposure. The observed increase in specific autophosphorylation of the kinase correlated well with its increased degradation after EGF and PMA activation. Interestingly, PKCϵ, another major isozyme found in fibroblasts, and, like PKCδ, a known interaction partner of RACK1 (25Borner C. Nichols Guadagno S. Fabbro D. Weinstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12892-12899Google Scholar, 27Liedtke C.M. Yun C.H. Kyle N. Wang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22925-22933Google Scholar), did not show increased degradation after EGF or PMA activation, nor were its protein levels decreased in ple(-/-) compared with (+/+) cells (data not shown). Enhanced PKCδ Activity in Plectin(-/-) Mouse Fibroblasts—Previous studies have demonstrated that activation of PKC triggers its ubiquitination and degradation (28Lu Z. Liu D. Hornia A. Devonish W. Pagano M. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 839-845Google Scholar). It was therefore conceivable that increased degradation of PKC observed in ple(-/-) cells was a consequence of elevated enzymatic activity. To examine this we performed in vitro kinase assays. PKCδ was immunoprecipitated from ple(+/+) and ple(-/-) fibroblast cells, using isozyme-specific antibodies and solubilized immunoprecipitates were then incubated with radioactive ATP and histone 1 (H1), or MyBP, as exogenous PKC-specific substrates. Lysates used for IP were prepared from low-density cultures, because at that stage the difference in PKC levels between ple(+/+) and ple(-/-) cells was relatively high (see Fig. 3B). As monitored by autoradiography, PKCδ derived from ple(-/-) cells, showed significantly higher activity toward both substrates (∼60 and ∼35% for MyBP and H1, respectively) compared with ple(+/+) cell PKCδ (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 2–5). The amount of background H1-phosphorylation observed in the absence of anti-PKCδ antibody was negligible (Fig. 4, A and B, lane 1), confirming the specificity of the assay. Regulation of RACK1 and PKCδ Compartmentalization by Plectin—To investigate the cytoplasmic localization of RACK1 in relation to plectin, mixed 24 h-cultures of ple(+/+) and (-/-) cells were subjected to double immunofluorescence microscopy using mouse mAb to RACK1 and rabbit antiserum to plectin. As shown in Fig. 5, A–C, both RACK1 and plectin were found spread all over the cytoplasm under these conditions. However, while plectin showed its typical filamentous staining pattern (in ple(+/+) cells only), RACK1 staining was confined to structures of granular appearance without any significant difference detectable between ple(+/+) and ple(-/-) cells. Upon EGF activation, plectin partially translocated to discrete areas at the cell periphery, most noticeably cellular extensions resembling filopodia (Fig. 5, E and F, white arrows). At the same time, EGF stimulation caused a dispersion of RACK1 granules, resulting in a more intense and diffuse cy"

In this study, we investigated the upstream mechanism of cytochrome c release induced by ethyl 2-amino-6-bromo-4-(1-cyano-2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)-4H-chromene-3-carboxylate (HA14-1), a recently discovered small molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2. HA14-1 was found to induce cytochrome c release from the mitochondria of intact cells but not from isolated mitochondria. Cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria requires the presence of both HA14-1 and exogenous Ca2+. This suggests that both mitochondrial and extramitochondrial signals are important. In intact cells, treatment with HA14-1 caused Ca2+ spike, change in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) transition, Bax translocation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation prior to cytochrome c release. Pretreatment with either EGTA acetoxymethyl ester or vitamin E resulted in a significant decrease in cytochrome c release and cell death induced by HA14-1. Furthermore pretreatment with RU-360, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter, or with EGTA acetoxymethyl ester, but not with vitamin E, prevented the HA14-1-induced Δψm transition and Bax translocation. This suggests that ROS generation is an event that occurs after the Δψm transition and Bax translocation. Together these data demonstrate that the Ca2+ spike, mitochondrial Bcl-2 presensitization, and subsequent Δψm transition, Bax translocation, and ROS generation are important upstream signals for cytochrome c release upon HA14-1 stimulation. The involvement of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial signals suggests both organelles are crucial for HA14-1-induced apoptosis.

Bcl-2 is overexpressed in many types of tumors, especially relapsed or chemoresistant malignancies (1Reed J.C. Miyashita T. Krajewski S. Takayama S. Aime-Sempe C. Kitada S. Sato T. Wang H.G.

Elbertova A. Neoplasma. 2002; 49: 141-144Google Scholar). It is an important target for anticancer drug development because Bcl-2 plays an essential antiapoptotic role against cell death induced by chemotherapeutic agents, radiation, growth factor withdrawal, or hypoxia (6Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3225-3236Google Scholar). By interrupting the function of Bcl-2, agents such as peptidic and organic molecules discovered recently have been shown to induce a potent direct and selective killing effect on target cells (7Wang J.L.

Like most apoptotic stimuli, these peptidic and organic inhibitors of Bcl-2 induce cytochrome c release, caspase-9/-3 activation, and DNA fragmentation. However, the precise molecular mechanism for cytochrome c release triggered by Bcl-2-targeting agents remains obscure. Cytochrome c release is a central step in the initiation of caspase-dependent apoptosis (10Vander Heiden M.G. Thompson C.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E209-E216Google Scholar, 11Tsujimoto Y. Shimizu S.

It has been demonstrated that overexpression of either mitochondria- or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HA14-1, ethyl 2-amino-6-bromo-4-(1-cyano-2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)-4H-chromene-3-carboxylate; PTP, potential transient pore; ROS, reactive oxygen species; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; JC-1, 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolcarbocyanine iodide; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone; Δψm, change in mitochondrial membrane potential; BH3, Bcl-2 homology 3; H2DCFDA, succinimidyl ester of dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; MTS-tetrazolium, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium; Z-VAD-fmk, carbobenzoxyl-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-(O-methyl)-fluoromethylketone; carbobenzoxylvalyl-alanyl- Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HA14-1, ethyl 2-amino-6-bromo-4-(1-cyano-2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)-4H-chromene-3-carboxylate; PTP, potential transient pore; ROS, reactive oxygen species; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; JC-1, 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolcarbocyanine iodide; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone; Δψm, change in mitochondrial membrane potential; BH3, Bcl-2 homology 3; H2DCFDA, succinimidyl ester of dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; MTS-tetrazolium, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium; Z-VAD-fmk, carbobenzoxyl-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-(O-methyl)-fluoromethylketone; carbobenzoxylvalyl-alanyl- Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis.-specific Bcl-2 prevents the induction of apoptosis by inhibiting the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c (13Annis M.G.

Schulze-Osthoff K. Belka C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4161-4172Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism governing the cytochrome c release regulated by Bcl-2 has yet to be fully characterized, what does appear to be important is the heterodimerization of Bcl-2 with proapoptotic proteins. Such heterodimerization directly or indirectly inhibits the apoptotic function, especially the homo-oligomerization of multidomain proapoptotic Bax or Bak that corresponds with the release of cytochrome c (15Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 395-419Google Scholar, 16Antonsson B. Conti F. Ciavatta A. Montessuit S. Lewis S. Martinou I. Bernasconi L. Bernard A. Mermod J.J. Mazzei G. Maundrell K.

Lindsten T. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Google Scholar). Heterodimerization of Bcl-2 with proapoptotic proteins or BH3 domain-derived peptides from proapoptotic members such as Bax, Bak, or Bad has been demonstrated by NMR, cell-free protein-protein binding, and yeast two-hybrid studies (19Petros A.M. Medek A. Nettesheim D.G. Kim D.H. Yoon H.S. Swift K. Matayoshi E.D. Oltersdorf T. Fesik S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3012-3017Google Scholar, 20Reed J.C. Zha H. Aime-Sempe C.

The anti-cytochrome c releasing effect of Bcl-2 can be suppressed by the overexpression of proapoptotic proteins such as Bax (22Mikhailov V. Mikhailova M. Pulkrabek D.J. Dong Z. Venkatachalam M.A. Saikumar P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18361-18374Google Scholar). Conversely the cytochrome c releasing activity of proapoptotic proteins can be limited by the overexpression of Bcl-2 (16Antonsson B. Conti F. Ciavatta A. Montessuit S. Lewis S. Martinou I. Bernasconi L. Bernard A. Mermod J.J. Mazzei G. Maundrell K. Gambale F. Sadoul R. Martinou J.C. Science. 1997; 277: 370-372Google Scholar). The ratio rather than the amount of antiapoptotic versus proapoptotic proteins determines whether apoptotic signaling can proceed (15Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 395-419Google Scholar, 17Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Google Scholar, 23Korsmeyer S.J. Shutter J.R. Veis D.J. Merry D.E. Oltvai Z.N. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1993; 4: 327-332Google Scholar). Normally Bax exists as a soluble monomer in cytosol or is loosely associated with mitochondria. However, upon apoptotic stimulation, Bax translocates to mitochondria where it forms oligomers that are inserted into the outer mitochondrial membrane (24Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Sanchez B. Martinou J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11615-11623Google Scholar, 25Valentijn A.J. Metcalfe A.D. Kott J. Streuli C.H. Gilmore A.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 599-612Google Scholar). The signals that trigger the translocation of Bax to mitochondria remain largely unknown. In synthetic membranes, Bcl-2 has been shown to directly inhibit the channel or pore forming activity of Bax (16Antonsson B. Conti F. Ciavatta A. Montessuit S. Lewis S. Martinou I. Bernasconi L. Bernard A. Mermod J.J. Mazzei G. Maundrell K. Gambale F. Sadoul R. Martinou J.C. Science. 1997; 277: 370-372Google Scholar), which is consistent with the ability of Bcl-2 in preventing Bax oligomerization in outer mitochondrial membranes (22Mikhailov V. Mikhailova M. Pulkrabek D.J. Dong Z. Venkatachalam M.A. Saikumar P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18361-18374Google Scholar, 26Saito M. Korsmeyer S.J. Schlesinger P.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 553-555Google Scholar). The antiapoptotic function of Bcl-2 is thought to be primarily derived from Bcl-2 presented in the mitochondria (10Vander Heiden M.G. Thompson C.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E209-E216Google Scholar, 27Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Google Scholar). However, growing evidence has indicated that Bcl-2 expressed on ER plays an important role in the inhibition of cytochrome c release and apoptosis (28Rudner J. Jendrossek V. Belka C. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 441-447Google Scholar). An exclusive ER-targeted form of Bcl-2, Bcl-2/cb5 has been shown to prevent apoptosis in many types of cells induced by c-Myc, tunicamycin, brefeldin A, radiation, or Bax overexpression (13Annis M.G. Zamzami N. Zhu W. Penn L.Z. Kroemer G. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1939-1952Google Scholar, 14Rudner J. Lepple-Wienhues A. Budach W. Berschauer J. Friedrich B. Wesselborg S.

Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44117-44128Google Scholar). The protective effect of Bcl-2/cb5 in cells suggests the presence of cross-talk between ER and mitochondria. However, the mediators that connect ER Bcl-2 and mitochondrial cytochrome c release remain to be identified. What does appear to be important is intracellular Ca2+ signaling (32Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Opferman J.T. Cheng E.H. Sorcinelli M.D. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 135-139Google Scholar, 33Demaurex N. Distelhorst C. Science. 2003; 300: 65-67Google Scholar). It has been shown that Bcl-2 overexpression blocks Ca2+ entry into or release from ER in response to many apoptotic stimuli. For example, overexpression of Bcl-2 decreases the ER Ca2+ load (34Pinton P. Ferrari D. Magalhaes P. Schulze-Osthoff K. Di Virgilio F. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 857-862Google Scholar, 35Lam M. Dubyak G. Chen L. Nunez G. Miesfeld R.L. Distelhorst C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6569-6573Google Scholar) and prevents or delays the depletion of Ca2+ from ER after cells have received a treatment with apoptosis inducers such as thapsigargin, 2,5-di-(tert-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone, cyclopiazonic acid, or ceramide (36He H. Lam M. McCormick T.S. Distelhorst C.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1219-1228Google Scholar, 37Bian X. Hughes Jr., F.M. Huang Y. Cidlowski J.A. Putney Jr., J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1241-C1249Google Scholar, 38Pinton P. Ferrari D. Rapizzi E. Di Virgilio F.D. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2690-2701Google Scholar). The involvement of Ca2+ signaling in apoptosis has been suggested by a number of recent studies (39Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E255-E263Google Scholar, 40Pinton P. Ferrari D. Rapizzi E. Di Virgilio F. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 195-201Google Scholar). With transient increases in cytosolic Ca2+, many intracellular enzymes including phospholipases, proteases, and endonucleases can be activated, while prolonged or unregulated cytosolic Ca2+ elevation can further lead to apoptosis or cell death (41Orrenius S. McCabe Jr., M.J. Nicotera P. Toxicol. Lett. 1992; 64: 357-364Google Scholar, 42Pacher P. Hajnoczky G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4107-4121Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism underlying apoptosis mediated by Ca2+ in vivo remains to be fully defined, accumulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ or activation of caspase-12 or other Ca2+-dependent intracellular enzymes may be the possible mechanisms (39Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E255-E263Google Scholar, 43Ermak G. Davies K.J. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 38: 713-721Google Scholar). ER and mitochondria are two crucial organelles in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in cells. They are physiologically connected (44Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Google Scholar, 45Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Fogarty K.E. Lifshitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Pozzan T. Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Google Scholar). After certain stimulations, rapid Ca2+ accumulation in mitochondria always occurs immediately after ER Ca2+ release (46Rapizzi E. Pinton P. Szabadkai G. Wieckowski M.R. Vandecasteele G. Baird G. Tuft R.A. Fogarty K.E. Rizzuto R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 613-624Google Scholar, 47Pacher P. Thomas A.P. Hajnoczky G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2380-2385Google Scholar). Such a rapid influx of Ca2+ into mitochondria causes mitochondrial PTP to open and subsequent mitochondrial membrane permeability, mitochondrial metabolic alteration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and cytochrome c release. ROS is another potent promoter of cytochrome c release. In addition to regulating the cytochrome c-mediated caspase-dependent apoptosis, both Ca2+ and ROS are important mediators of caspase-independent apoptosis or necrosis (39Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E255-E263Google Scholar, 43Ermak G. Davies K.J. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 38: 713-721Google Scholar). Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a very important phenomenon in cytotoxicity induced by anticancer treatment. However, chemoresistance occurs when antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 is overexpressed (48Reed J.C. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. N. Am. 1995; 9: 451-473Google Scholar, 49Inoue S. Salah-Eldin A.E. Omoteyama K. Hum. Cell. 2001; 14: 211-221Google Scholar). Therefore, directly targeting Bcl-2 might overcome such chemoresistance. Based on the evidence that the heterodimerization of Bcl-2 and proapoptotic proteins is mediated by the BH3 domain of the proapoptotic proteins, we recently discovered a novel organic molecule, ethyl 2-amino-6-bromo-4-(1-cyano-2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)-4H-chromene-3-carboxylate (HA14-1) (C17H17BrN2O5,), that binds to the proapoptotic protein BH3 domain binding sites on the surface pocket of Bcl-2 (8Wang J.L. Liu D. Zhang Z.J. Shan S. Han X. Srinivasula S.M. Croce C.M. Alnemri E.S. Huang Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7124-7129Google Scholar). HA14-1 is a synthetic cell-permeable small molecule with a molecular weight of 409. It specifically competes with Bak BH3 domain-derived peptide in binding Bcl-2 with an IC50 of 9 μm (8Wang J.L. Liu D. Zhang Z.J. Shan S. Han X. Srinivasula S.M. Croce C.M. Alnemri E.S. Huang Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7124-7129Google Scholar). HA14-1 alone or in combination with other anticancer agents has been shown to induce apoptosis effectively in many types of cancer cells including Ara-C-resistant HL-60 cells (8Wang J.L. Liu D. Zhang Z.J. Shan S. Han X. Srinivasula S.M. Croce C.M. Alnemri E.S. Huang Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7124-7129Google Scholar, 50Yamaguchi H. Paranawithana S.R. Lee M.W. Huang Z.

Cytochrome c release, caspase-9/-3 activation, and DNA fragmentation are evident in HA14-1-induced apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanism upstream of cytochrome c release upon HA14-1 treatment remains unclear. In this study, we investigated and identified several upstream signals in both ER and mitochondria that are critical for cytochrome c release in response to HA14-1. Reagents—HA14-1 was synthesized and purified by our laboratory following our previously published method (53Yu N. Aramini J.M. Germann M.W. Huang Z. Tetrahedron Lett. 2000; 41: 6993-6996Google Scholar). The detailed description of the routes of syntheses and structure has been published previously (8Wang J.L. Liu D. Zhang Z.J. Shan S. Han X. Srinivasula S.M. Croce C.M. Alnemri E.S. Huang Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7124-7129Google Scholar). HA14-1 was prepared freshly by dissolving HA14-1 in Me2SO. It was diluted to appropriate concentrations in culture media before use in each experiment. EGTA acetoxymethyl ester, 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1), Calcium Green, and H2DCFDA (Molecular Probes) were dissolved in Me2SO, and aliquots were stored at -20 °C. RU-360 (Calbiochem), carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), and vitamin E (Sigma) were dissolved in ethanol, and aliquots were stored at -20 °C. Cell Culture—The HL-60/Bcl-2 and HL-60/neo cell lines were obtained from Dr. Kapil N. Bhalla (University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL). Each cell line (HL-60/Bcl-2 or HL-60/neo) had been stably transfected with either pZip-Bcl-2 or pZip-neo (control), respectively. The Bax-/-/Bak-/- knock-out and wild type MEF cell lines were obtained from Dr. Stanley J. Korsmeyer (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). All cells were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 800 μg/ml Geneticin (G418, Invitrogen). The concentrations of HA14-1 and other agents used and the treatment intervals are indicated in the following “Experimental Procedures” and under “Results.” Cells were maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Measurement of Cell Viability—To measure the cytotoxic effects of HA14-1 on cell survival, cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well in 96-well plates. Cells were treated with either a vehicle control or various concentrations of HA14-1 or HA14-1 plus other agents as indicated under “Results.” At the end of each treatment, cell viability was measured by using a CellTiter 96® AQueous assay kit (Promega). This kit contains MTS-tetrazolium in which viable cells convert MTS-tetrazolium into a formazan colored product with an A of 490 nm. According to the manufacturer's instructions, 20 μl of MTS-tetrazolium solution were added to 100 μl of culture media and incubated for 3-4 h at 37 °C. Afterward the absorbance at 490 nm was measured using a Wallac Victor2 multilabel counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Assays were performed in triplicate for each experiment; mean cell viability was compared with vehicle-treated controls. Each experimental data point was generated from at least three independent experiments. Measurement of Caspase Activity—A CaspGLOW green caspase staining kit (Biovision) was used to measure the caspase-9 activity according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly cells (106/ml), after different treatments, were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated caspase-9 inhibitor LEHD-fmk, which specifically interacts with activated caspase-9. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the fluorescence intensity was determined using the Wallac Victor2 multilabel counter. Increase in the fluorescence intensity was determined by comparing the level of the treated cells to that of vehicle controls. Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP) Cleavage and DNA Fragmentation Assay—After appropriate treatments, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and placed in 1) lysis buffer containing 0.02 m Tris, 1% Triton X-100, 0.14 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μmol/ml protease inhibitor (Sigma), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and dithiothreitol for PARP cleavage assay and 2) lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% sodium chloride, and 100 μg/ml proteinase K for 3 h at 56 °C and for 1 h with 0.5 mg/ml RNase A at 37 °C for DNA fragmentation assay. The PARP cleavage was determined on Western blot using rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1,000) (Cell Signaling Technology). Signals were detected in the same way as that described for cytochrome c. For the DNA fragmentation assay, DNA was precipitated with isopropanol and analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. After ethidium bromide staining, the presence of DNA in the gels was visualized under UV light. Measurement of Cytochrome c Release—Mitochondrial versus cytosol fractions of cells were prepared using a mitochondrial/cytosol fractionation kit (Biovision). Cells at 1 × 107 with or without different treatments were harvested by centrifugation at 700 × g for 5 min and washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Afterward the cells were resuspended in a 250 μl of extraction buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture and dithiothreitol (Biovision). After incubation on ice for 30 min, the cells were homogenized using a Kontes Dounce tissue grinder (Fisher) on ice. Homogenizations were centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. Then the collected supernatant was centrifuged again at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were harvested and designated as cytosolic fractions, and the pellets were resuspended in an appropriate buffer and designated as mitochondrial fractions. Protein content was determined using a Coomassie Blue assay (Bio-Rad). Similarly mitochondrial versus media fractions were obtained after treatments of purified mitochondria with HA14-1. For all experiments, fresh mitochondria were prepared and used within 4 h. The isolated mitochondria were incubated in a buffer containing 150 mm KCl, 3 mm KH2PO4,5mm succinate, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 μm rotenone, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 and treated with 20 μm HA14-1 alone, with 0.1 μm Ca2+ alone, or with HA14-1 plus 0.1 μm Ca2+ for 30 min at 37 °C, respectively. Cytochrome c release in isolated mitochondria was monitored after treatment with HA14-1 in the presence or absence of CaCl2. The cytochrome c distributed in either fraction, the cytosol/media or the mitochondria, in each experiment was analyzed using Western blotting with anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (1:1,000) (BD Pharmingen) or control antibody against β-actin (1:5,000) (Oncogene). Signals were detected using the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:1,000) and enhanced chemiluminescence substrate kit (Amersham Biosciences). Measurement of Intracellular Calcium Concentration—Cells at 1 × 106/ml were incubated with the calcium indicator dye Calcium Green at 5 μm (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2 followed by a 10-min wash in phosphate-buffered saline. Previous studies have demonstrated that the vast majority of Calcium Green fluorescence is associated with ER as determined by using confocal microscopy with ER-Tracker- or MitoTracker-counterstained cells (54Nutt L.K. Chandra J. Pataer A. Fang B. Roth J.A. Swisher S.G. O'Neil R.G. McConkey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20301-20308Google Scholar). The fluorescence intensity of each indicator was measured using a FluoroMax-2 fluorescence spectrofluorometer (JoBin Yvon-Spex Instruments S.A., Inc.). Fluorescence was excited at 485 nm (F485), and emitted fluorescence was recorded at 550 nm. To obtain the fluorescence maximum and minimum, cells were subsequently incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 or 10 mm EGTA in the presence of saturating concentrations of extracellular Ca2+. Experiments were performed at 37 °C with constant stirring. The Ca2+ concentrations were calculated by the formula: [Ca2+] = (F - Fmin/Fmax - F) × Kd. Determination of Changes in Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (Δψm)—Quantitative changes in Δψm in cells at the early stage of apoptosis were measured using JC-1. This dye exists as a monomer with emission at 530 nm (green fluorescence) at low concentrations but forms J-aggregates with emission at 590 nm (red fluorescence) at high concentrations. Therefore, the fluorescence of JC-1 can be considered as an indicator of the relative mitochondrial membrane polarization state. Briefly cells were seeded at 1 × 106/ml. After different treatments, the cells were incubated with 10 μm JC-1 at 37 °C for 8 min, washed twice, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Relative fluorescence intensities were monitored using the FluoroMax-2 fluorescence spectrofluorometer with 490 nm excitation/535 nm emission and 570 nm excitation/610 nm emission. The Δψm was expressed as the ratio of the fluorescence of J-aggregate (570 nm excitation/610 nm emission) to monomer (490 nm excitation/535 nm emission) forms of JC-1. Confocal Microscopic Analysis of Bax Translocation—Cells (5 × 105) were transfected with pEGFP-C3/Bax (obtained from Dr. Richard J. Youle, NINDS, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) using the cationic lipid LipofectAMINE™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Each well contained 2 μg of plasmid DNA and 8 μg of LipofectAMINE 2000. After 3 h in a serum-free medium, an equal volume of culture medium was added. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were washed once and cultured in regular media for an additional 24 h. Afterward cells were stained with MitoTracker Red at 20 ng/ml for 30 min, and then the cells were resuspended in fresh medium containing 20 μm HA14-1 and transferred to a sealed mounting chamber. Images were collected using a confocal microscope (Olympus). The fluorescence excitation of GFP and MitoTracker Red were 488 and 568 nm, respectively. Measurement of ROS Generation—The generation of ROS was measured in HL-60 cells at the end of different treatments according to the methods published by others (55Brubacher J.L. Bols N.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 251: 81-91Google Scholar). Briefly, at the end of each treatment, the culture medium was removed and replaced with 100 μl of fresh culture medium containing 100 μm H2DCFDA, which was intracellularly de-esterified to dichlorodihydrofluorescein the substrate that ROS oxidizes to fluorescent dichlorofluorescein. After a 15-min incubation at 37 °C, the fluorescence intensity was measured using the Wallac Victor2 multilabel counter. Fluorescence was excited at 485 nm, and emitted fluorescence was recorded at 538 nm. Statistical Analysis—The statistical analysis was performed using the Student's paired t test. Two-sided p values of <0.05 were c"

Whole-cell lysates were separated by two-dimensional PAGE, and HPLC-MS/MS was used to identify androgen-regulated proteins. Prohibitin, a protein with cell-cycle regulatory activity, was shown to be downregulated by 50% following androgen stimulation. Western blot and reverse transcription-PCR experiments confirmed the result and showed that regulation occurs at the level of transcription. To determine the importance of prohibitin in androgen-stimulated growth, we used transient transfection to overexpress the protein and RNA interference to knock down the protein. Subsequent FACS analysis showed that cells with reduced levels of prohibitin showed a slight but reproducible increase in the percentage of population in cell cycle, while cells with increased prohibitin levels showed a clear reduction in the percentage entering cell cycle, following dihydrotestosterone stimulation, when compared to untransfected controls. Confocal microscopy showed localization of prohibitin in the nucleus as well as the mitochondria of LNCaP cells. It therefore seems that the regulation of prohibitin is a vital part of the cellular growth response to androgen stimulation in LNCaPs and prohibitin may have a nuclear regulatory role in cell-cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W2168427863,"HmuO, a heme oxygenase of Corynebacterium diphtheriae, catalyzes degradation of heme using the same mechanism as the mammalian enzyme. The oxy form of HmuO, the precursor of the catalytically active ferric hydroperoxo species, has been characterized by ligand binding kinetics, resonance Raman spectroscopy, and x-ray crystallography. The oxygen association and dissociation rate constants are 5 μm-1 s-1 and 0.22 s-1, respectively, yielding an O2 affinity of 21 μm-1, which is ∼20 times greater than that of mammalian myoglobins. However, the affinity of HmuO for CO is only 3–4-fold greater than that for mammalian myoglobins, implying the presence of strong hydrogen bonding interactions in the distal pocket of HmuO that preferentially favor O2 binding. Resonance Raman spectra show that the Fe–O2 vibrations are tightly coupled to porphyrin vibrations, indicating the highly bent Fe–O–O geometry that is characteristic of the oxy forms of heme oxygenases. In the crystal structure of the oxy form the Fe–O–O angle is 110°, the O–O bond is pointed toward the heme α-meso-carbon by direct steric interactions with Gly-135 and Gly-139, and hydrogen bonds occur between the bound O2 and the amide nitrogen of Gly-139 and a distal pocket water molecule, which is a part of an extended hydrogen bonding network that provides the solvent protons required for oxygen activation. In addition, the O–O bond is orthogonal to the plane of the proximal imidazole side chain, which facilitates hydroxylation of the porphyrin α-meso-carbon by preventing premature O–O bond cleavage.

Heme oxygenase, HO, 1The abbreviations used are: HO, heme oxygenase; Mb, myoglobin; Hb, hemoglobin; Wat, water molecule. catalyzes regioselective oxidative conversion of iron protoporphyrin IX (heme) to biliverdin IX, iron, and CO (1Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). HO is not a hemeprotein by itself but utilizes heme as both a prosthetic group and a substrate. In mammalian systems, where electrons are supplied by NADPH through NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (2Schacter B.A. Nelson E.B. Marver H.S. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3601-3607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), HO is the enzyme responsible for excess heme degradation (1Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Hepatology. 2000; 31: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although most of the structural and functional studies have been conducted on the soluble, truncated form of isoform-1 of mammalian heme oxygenase, HO-1 (6Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Two HO proteins from pathogenic bacteria have been characterized in some detail, namely HmuO from Corynebacterium diphtheriae and HemO from Neisseria meningitidis (12Chu G.C. Katakura K. Zhang X.

Instead, they are soluble and have smaller molecular masses, i.e. 24 kDa for HmuO and 26 kDa for HemO. HmuO has 33% sequence identity to the first 221 amino acids of human HO-1. Despite their differences in size, the two bacterial HO proteins have overall protein folds, heme environments, and catalytic mechanisms very similar to those for mammalian HO-1 (12Chu G.C.

The first electron donated from the reducing substrate converts the heme iron to the ferrous state. Then O2 binds to reduced 5-coordinate heme to form a meta-stable oxy complex. A one-electron reduction of the oxy form generates a ferric hydroperoxo complex, which self-hydroxylates the α-meso-carbon of the porphyrin ring (6Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 17Davydov R.M. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 10656-10657Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The latter reaction is different from what occurs in P450 enzymes, in which the O–O bond of the hydroperoxo complex is heterolytically cleaved to generate an actively hydroxylating, ferryl (Fe4+=O) intermediate (18Sono M. Roach M.P. Coulter E.D. Dawson J.H. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2841-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar). Ferric α-meso-hydroxyheme is then converted to biliverdin by multiple oxidoreductive steps involving a verdoheme intermediate (6Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Curr. Opin. Chem.

The oxy form of the heme complex of heme oxygenase has several unique features relevant to HO catalytic function (20Takahashi S. Ishikawa K. Takeuchi N. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. Rousseau D.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 6002-6006Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 21Migita C.T. Mansfield Matera K. Ikeda-Saito M. Olson J.S. Fujii H. Yoshimura T. Zhou H. Yoshida T. J. Biol.

Soc. 1998; 120: 8251-8252Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). O2 binds to the complex with high oxygen affinity due to a very small oxygen dissociation rate constant (21Migita C.T.

This is one of the reasons why HO catalysis is not severely inhibited by its product, CO, in air-saturated buffer. The cause for the small O2 dissociation rate is assumed to involve hydrogen bonding between the bound ligand and its adjacent protein environment; but, until this report, this assumption has not been confirmed by direct structure determination (21Migita C.T.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7293-7300Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Analysis of the Fe–O2 vibration modes predicts that the Fe–O–O unit is highly bent by steric interactions between the bound O2 and the residues in the distal pocket (20Takahashi S. Ishikawa K. Takeuchi N. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. Rousseau D.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 6002-6006Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These results, which indicated both steric restriction and hydrogen bonding, led to the proposal that the terminal oxygen is “held” in a position adjacent to the α-meso-carbon of the porphyrin ring, facilitating a highly regiospecific oxygenation (14Hirotsu S. Chu G.C. Unno M. Lee D.-S. Yoshida T. Park S.-Y. Shiro Y. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11937-11947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 20Takahashi S.

Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar); but, again, this orientation has not been confirmed directly by x-ray crystallography. A hydrogen bond with an adjacent exchangeable proton from a distal pocket water molecule has also been proposed (13Chu G.C. Tomita T. Sonnichsen F.D. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24490-24496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22Fujii H. Dou Y. Zhou H. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 8251-8252Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and this proton is thought to become the hydroperoxo proton after a one-electron reduction of the oxy form (17Davydov R.M. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 10656-10657Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 25Davydov R.M. Kofman V. Fujii H. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem.

This hydrogen bonding proposal was based on electron paramagnetic resonance studies with HmuO and HO containing oxy cobalt porphyrin and also requires direct structural confirmation. Until this report, a crystal structure of the oxy form of heme oxygenase had not been reported because of the meta-stable nature of the Fe–O2 intermediate. The ferrous NO complex has been used as a mimic of the oxy form in recent structural studies and has provided useful information about the active site of HO (23Sugishima M. Sakamoto H. Kakuta Y. Omata Y. Hayashi S. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7293-7300Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 26Lad L. Wang J. Li H. Friedman J. Bhaskar B. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, the structure of the oxy complex is needed to more accurately delineate the mode of oxygen binding. The heme oxygenase from C. diphtheriae (HmuO) has been thoroughly characterized structurally and enzymatically (12Chu G.C. Katakura K. Zhang X. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21319-21325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13Chu G.C. Tomita T. Sonnichsen F.D. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 11937-11947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and we have now been able to obtain crystals of the oxy form of this enzyme. Oxygenated crystals were obtained by using strictly anaerobic conditions for reduction of ferric crystals, carefully removing excess reducing agent, exposing the one-electron reduced sample to mother liquor equilibrated with 1 atm of O2 for 10 min, and then flash freezing the final oxygenated samples. These crystals were used to determine the structure of oxy HmuO to 1.85 Å resolution. We have also examined O2 and CO binding to the ferrous heme-HmuO complex and characterized the resonance Raman spectrum of the oxy complex. The crystal structure shows that bound oxygen is tightly confined by two Gly residues, which direct the O–O axis toward the heme α-meso-carbon atom. Bound O2 also forms a hydrogen bond with a solvent-accessible distal pocket water molecule that both slows oxygen dissociation and provides protons for the formation of the hydroperoxo intermediate, which hydroxylates the porphyrin ring. Expression, purification, and reconstitution of the recombinant HmuO with heme were carried out as described previously (12Chu G.C. Katakura K. Zhang X. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21319-21325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Ligand binding reactions were measured using stopped flow and flash photolysis techniques as described previously (27Rohlfs R.J. Mathews A.J. Carver T.E. Olson J.S. Springer B.A. Egeberg K.D. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3168-3176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CO form of the heme-HmuO complex was prepared by diluting the ferrous forms of the complex into the anaerobic buffer solutions containing known CO concentrations. The oxygenated form was made as follows. First, the ferric heme-HmuO complex was reduced by sodium dithionite in deoxygenated buffer. Then, the reduced form of the complex was loaded on to a column of Sephadex G-25 and eluted with buffer containing the known oxygen concentrations. Formation of the complex and sample integrity were confirmed by the optical absorption spectra recorded before and after the flash photolysis measurements. All measurements were carried out in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7, at 20 °C. Resonance Raman spectra of the oxy form were obtained by the use of a continuous flow rapid mixing apparatus as described previously (28Takahashi S. Yeh S.-R. Das T.K. Chan C.-K. Gottfried D.S. Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 29Couture M. Stuehr D.J. Rousseau D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3201-3205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Continuous laser illumination caused oxidation of the oxy form of the heme-HmuO complex, so only the flow method yielded usable Raman spectra of the oxy form of HmuO. The deoxy form of the heme-HmuO complex was mixed with either 16O2 - or 18O2-saturated buffer (0.1 m phosphate, pH 7, containing 1 mm EDTA) with a flow rate of 1.2 μs/μm. The Raman data were taken at 25 ms after mixing at 4 °C with excitation by the 413.1-nm line of a krypton laser (40 milliwatts). The Raman shifts were calibrated by using indene as standard. Optical absorption spectra of the collected sample were taken after Raman measurements to confirm formation of the O2-bound heme-HmuO. The crystals of the oxy form of the heme-HmuO complex were prepared as follows. The crystals of the ferric heme-HmuO complex were obtained by a hanging drop vapor diffusion method as described previously (14Hirotsu S. Chu G.C. Unno M. Lee D.-S. Yoshida T. Park S.-Y. Shiro Y. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11937-11947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The ferric HmuO crystals were transferred into an N2-bubbled reservoir solution containing 50 mm MES, pH 6.1, 2.2 m ammonium sulfate, and 5% (w/v) sucrose. The crystals were brought into a nitrogen glove box, where they were transferred into the reservoir solution containing 50 mm sodium dithionite and 5% sucrose. The crystals were soaked for 10 min to ensure complete conversion to the ferrous form. To remove dithionite and its oxidized products, the ferrous crystals were then transferred into another reservoir solution containing 15% sucrose without dithionite and washed by repeated pumping with a micropipette. The crystals were further transferred into another reservoir solution that contained 20% sucrose without dithionite and washed as before. After washing, the crystals were taken out of the globe box and transferred into the reservoir solution containing 25% sucrose, which had been equilibrated thoroughly with 1 atm of pure O2 prior to soaking the crystals. After soaking for 10 min, the crystals were picked up by nylon loops and flash frozen with liquid N2. Formation of the oxy complex was confirmed by recording light absorption spectra of the crystals by a microspectrophotometer (4DX Systems AB, Uppsala, Sweden) in the visible region. During the absorption measurements, the crystals were kept at 100 K by an Oxford liquid nitrogen flow cryostat. The crystals used for the x-ray diffraction experiments were mostly in the oxy form, with the remainder being the ferric form (∼5 to 10%). X-ray diffraction data sets were collected with a Rigaku R-Axis V imaging plate using 1 Å synchrotron radiation at BL41XU of SPring-8. The temperature around the crystals was maintained at 100 K throughout data collection. The oscillation angle, camera length, and exposure time were 1°, 200 mm, and 5 s, respectively. The incident x-ray intensity was attenuated by use of a 0.6-mm thick aluminum film to reduce radiation damage to the crystals. Data were integrated, merged, and processed with HKL-2000 (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Diffraction data with 100% completeness was obtained from 180 frames. The crystals belonged to the space group P21 with unit-cell parameters of a = 54.0 Å, b = 63.0 Å, c = 107.5 Å, and β = 101° and contained three HmuO molecules per one asymmetric unit.

The phases were extended to 1.85 Å by density modifications, including solvent flattening, non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) averaging between three molecules, and histogram matching with program DM from the CCP4 suites (32CCP4: Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The structure was refined to fit to the observed structure factors using simulated annealing (T = 4000 K) for the 40–1.85 Å resolution data by CNS. The crystallographic refinements with simulated annealing and individual B-factor refinement with CNS were performed to calculate an unbiased model. At this stage, the non-crystallographic symmetry restraint was removed because each of the three molecules in the asymmetric unit had slightly different conformations, as was the case for the ferric and ferrous heme-complexes of HmuO (14Hirotsu S.

After several refinement cycles, water molecules were added to the model by CNS and moved and/or removed by manual inspection in the σA-weighted 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc maps with the program O (33Jones T.A.

After the introduction of alternative conformations for several residues and the translation-liberation-screw refinement (35Schomaker V. Trueblood K.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Crystallogr. Cryst. Chem. 1968; 24: 63-76Crossref Google Scholar), the final R and Rfree factors dropped to 0.153 and 0.192, respectively. The final refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. Throughout the model building and refinement process, 10% of the reflections were excluded to monitor the Rfree value. Several residues located in N- and C-terminal regions were not visible in the electron density map, probably due to their disorder. Drawings were made by MOLSCRIPT (36Kraulis P.J. J. Appl.

Association and dissociation rate constants for O2 binding to the ferrous form of the heme-HmuO complex are compared with those of rat HO-1 and wild-type and V68N pig Mb in Table II. Bimolecular rebinding of O2 to the heme-HmuO complex after flash photolysis is monophasic, and the observed rate depends linearly on the O2 concentration. The association rate constant for O2 binding to the heme-HmuO complex, k′O2 = 5 μm-1 s-1, is 3-fold smaller than that of mammalian Mbs (Table II) (38Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 699-714Crossref Scopus (728) Google Scholar). However, the O2 dissociation rate constant (kO2) for the oxy heme-HmuO complex is ∼0.22 s-1, which is ∼70 times smaller than that of Mb (∼15 s-1). The oxygen equilibrium constant (KO2) of HmuO is 21 μm-1, which is ∼20 times greater than that of MbTable IIParameters for O2 binding to the HmuO and rat HO-1 heme complexes, pig Mb, and Ascaris Hb in 0.1 m phosphate, pH 7, 20 °C The rate constants for rat HO-1 are taken from Migita et al.

Errors for HO-1 were obtained from three different independent experimental determinations (different samples and different days) and indicate that there are no significant differences between the ligand binding parameters for HmuO and HO-1.

Both heme oxygenases have O2 association equilibrium constants that are 20–30-fold greater than those for mammalian Mbs, but the HO-1 and HmuO affinities for CO are only 2.5–4-fold greater than those for Mbs. As result, the heme oxygenases show very low M values (KCO/KO2 ≈ 5).

https://openalex.org/W2162035907,"The supplementation of the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway with exogenously supplied N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) analogs has many potential biomedical and biotechnological applications. In this work, we explore the structure-activity relationship of Man-NAc analogs on cell viability and metabolic flux into the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway to gain a better understanding of the fundamental biology underlying “glycosylation engineering” technology. A panel of ManNAc analogs bearing various modifications on the hydroxyl groups as well as substitutions at the N-acyl position was investigated. Increasing the carbon chain length of ester derivatives attached to the hydroxyl groups increased the metabolic efficiency of sialic acid production, whereas similar modification to the N-acyl group decreased efficiency. In both cases, increases in chain length decreased cell viability; DNA ladder formation, Annexin V-FITC two-dimensional flow cytometry assays, caspase-3 activation, and down-regulation of sialoglycoconjugate-processing enzymes established that the observed growth inhibition and toxicity resulted from apoptosis. Two of the panel of 12 analogs tested, specifically Ac4ManNLev and Ac4 ManNHomoLev, were highly toxic. Interestingly, both of these analogs maintained a ketone functionality in the same position relative to the core monosaccharide structure, and both also inhibited flux through the sialic acid pathway (the remainder of the less toxic analogs either increased or had no measurable impact on flux). These results provide fundamental insights into the role of sialic acid metabolism in apoptosis by demonstrating that ManNAc analogs can modulate apoptosis both indirectly via hydroxylgroup effects and directly through N-acyl-group effects.

The term “sialic acid engineering” refers to a technique where non-natural N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) 1The abbreviations used are: ManNAc, N-acetylmannosamine; Gal-NAc, N-acetylgalactosamine; PI, propidium iodide; PS, phosphatidylserine; GNE, UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc 6-kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: ManNAc, N-acetylmannosamine; Gal-NAc, N-acetylgalactosamine; PI, propidium iodide; PS, phosphatidylserine; GNE, UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc 6-kinase. analogs intercept the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway and are incorporated into cellular sialoglycoconjugates in the place of sialic acid residues (Fig. 1) (1Kayser H. Zeitler R. Kannicht C. Grunow D. Nuck R. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16934-16938Google Scholar, 2Mahal L.K. Yarema K.J. Bertozzi C.R. Science. 1997; 276: 1125-1128Google Scholar). The impetus behind this strategy is to mimic nature, which uses >50 different forms of sialic acid to modulate the structure and function of sialic acid-bearing glycoproteins and lipids (3Angata T. Varki A. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 439-469Google Scholar). By using synthetic N-acyl-modified ManNAc analogs, the surfaces of living cells can be endowed with novel properties not found in nature (4Yarema K.J. BioTechniques. 2001; 31: 384-393Google Scholar) that, depending on the exact analog used to perform this “submolecular microsurgery” (5Keppler O.T. Horstkorte R. Pawlita M. Schmidt C. Reutter W. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 11R-18RGoogle Scholar), have the potential to elicit a variety of changes in the behavior of the host cell.Theoretically, the ability to modify the cell surface and recombinant sialoglycoconjugates with molecular precision has the potential to regulate any biological process governed by sialic acid, such as cell growth and differentiation, communication among different cells, recognition of soluble factors, and attachment to, or disengagement from, the extracellular matrix (6Chen H.Y. Varki A. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1529-1533Google Scholar). In practice, sialic acid engineering methods have already been demonstrated to regulate cellular responses ranging from adhesion to proliferation (7Wieser J.R. Heisner A. Stehling P. Oesch R.

ManNAc analogs can also modify the expression of polysialic acid (12Mahal L.K. Charter N.W. Angata K. Fukuda M. Koshland Jr., D.E. Bertozzi C.R. Science. 2001; 294: 380-382Google Scholar, 13Charter N.W. Mahal L.K. Koshland Jr., D.E. Bertozzi C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9255-9261Google Scholar), a linear polysaccharide composed of entirely of α-2,8-linked sialic acid, which is implicated in the complex neural processes (14Rutishauser U. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 70: 304-312Google Scholar), synaptic plasticity (15Szele F.G. Dowling J.J. Gonzales C. Theveniau M. Rougon G. Chesselet M.F. Neuroscience. 1994; 60: 133-144Google Scholar, 16Ong E. Nakayama J. Angata K. Reyes L. Katsuyama T. Arai Y. Fukuda M. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 415-424Google Scholar), and tumor metastasis (17Sillanaukee P. Ponnio M. Jaaskelainen I.P. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 29: 413-425Google Scholar). In addition to research and medical applications, ManNAc analogs also hold potential for biotechnological applications, such as increasing the product quality of recombinant sialoglycoconjugates (18Viswanathan K. Lawrence S. Hinderlich S. Yarema K.J. Lee Y.C. Betenbaugh M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 15215-15225Google Scholar). In addition to sialic acid biosynthesis, other glycosylation pathways have been targeted with exogenous sugar analogs; for example, acetylated N-acetyllactosamine derivatives have been used to modulate sialyl Lewis X expression toward inhibiting the metastatic potential of cancer cells (19Fuster M.M. Brown J.R. Wang L. Esko J.D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2775-2781Google Scholar, 20Mong T.K.-K. Lee L.V. Brown J.R. Esko J.D. Wong C.-H. Chem. Biol. Chem. 2003; 4: 835-840Google Scholar), and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) analogs have been used to replace GalNAc residues within cellular glycoconjugates (21Hang H.C. Bertozzi C.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 1242-1243Google Scholar).Despite the many exciting potential applications of glycosylation-targeting metabolic engineering strategies, several challenges must be overcome before large-scale adoption of this technology to “real-world” applications becomes commonplace. A major challenge, the inefficient metabolic utilization of sugar analogs by cells, has been addressed by the development of acetylated monosaccharides (22Collins B.E. Fralich T.J. Itonori S. Ichikawa Y. Schnaar R.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 11-20Google Scholar, 23Jacobs C.L. Goon S. Yarema K.J. Hinderlich S. Hang H.C. Chai D.H. Bertozzi C.R.

Science. 2000; 287: 2007-2010Google Scholar). In a previous study, we demonstrated that various acetylated ManNAc analogs are used with up to 900-fold increased efficiency compared with their free monosaccharide counterparts (26Jones M.B. Teng H. Rhee J.K. Baskaran G. Lahar N. Yarema K.J. Biotech. Bioeng. 2004; 85: 394-405Google Scholar); a comparable increase in efficiency has been reported for acetylated disaccharides (24Sarkar A.K. Fritz T.A. Taylor W.H. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3323-3327Google Scholar, 27Sarkar A.K. Rostand K.S. Jain R.K. Matta K.L. Esko J.D. J. Biol.

The increase in uptake efficiency when the hydroxyl groups of a sugar are masked by acetyl esters led us to now investigate whether further elongation of the ester groups, resulting in even more hydrophobic compounds, would further increase the metabolic efficiency of analog utilization.A downside to the increased metabolic efficiency of hydroxylderivatized analogs is that they inhibit growth and decrease cell viability under certain conditions; these factors threaten to diminish the widespread use of monosaccharide analogs bearing hydrophobic modifications on their hydroxyl groups. To devise general strategies to increase the safety of these efficiently used sugar analogs, the molecular and cellular bases of the growth inhibition and toxicity caused by these compounds require detailed investigation. In this study, we focused on sugars used in “sialic acid engineering” methods by probing the structure-activity relationship of ManNAc analogs that feed into the sialic acid pathway by investigating a panel of compounds bearing various modifications on the hydroxyl groups as well as different substitutions at the N-acyl position. These studies lay the groundwork for better understanding the molecular basis of this toxicity and for exploring a safe strategy to deliver potentially toxic sugar analogs into the glycosylation pathways.Another aspect of this work is the discovery of new insights into the role of sialic acid in apoptosis. Results of this work show that non-natural ManNAc analogs behave as typical chemical toxicants that initiate and execute apoptosis in human cells. But, as a confounding factor, an ever-growing body of evidence shows that sialic acid itself plays key roles in apoptosis (6Chen H.Y. Varki A. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1529-1533Google Scholar, 29Eda S. Yamanaka M. Beppu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5967-5974Google Scholar, 30Suzuki O. Nozawa Y. Abe M. Int. J.

Gerontol. 2002; 37: 1273-1282Google Scholar); ManNAc analogs, therefore, by modulating metabolic flux into the sialic acid pathway, have the potential to evoke synergistic or antagonistic effects that either amplify or diminish that apoptotic response. To illustrate this point, 2 of the 12 analogs tested (Ac4ManNLev and Ac4ManNHomoLev) were highly toxic; interestingly, these two analogs were the only compounds to inhibit metabolic flux into the pathway. These results, discussed in more detail later in this report, demonstrate that ManNAc analogs, in addition to the glycosylation engineering applications discussed previously can also be exploited as research tools to gain new insights into the underlying biological basis of the connection of sialic acid metabolism to apoptosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Cell culture reagents, including RPMI 1640, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and penicillin/streptomycin solution, were purchased from Sigma. Fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT). Mannosamine hydrochloride and ManNAc were obtained from Pfanstiehl (Waukegan, IL); chemical reagents used in the synthesis of ManNAc analogs were purchased from Aldrich; organic solvents as well as copper sulfate, resorcinol, and periodic acid were from EM Sciences (Gibbstown, NJ). Annexin V-FITC assay kit for apoptosis detection and Caspase-3/CPP32 Colorimetric Assay kit for caspase-3 activity assay were purchased from MBL Co., Ltd. (Watertown, MA).Synthesis of ManNAc Analogs—The synthesis, purification, and characterization of several of the ManNAc analogs used in this work followed procedures published previously. Specifically, Ac4ManNAc, Ac4ManNProp, Ac4ManNBut, Ac4ManNPent, Ac4ManNHex, Ac4-ManNLev, Ac4ManNOxoHex, Ac4ManNOxoHept, and Ac4ManNOxoOct were synthesized by the methods of Jacobs and co-workers (23Jacobs C.L.

Ac4ManHomoLev, Prop4ManNAc, and But4ManNAc are compounds that are previously unreported and are synthesized as described below.General Procedure for the Preparation of Prop4ManNAc and But4ManNAc—To a stirred solution of ManNAc monohydrate (0.53 g, 2.2 mmol) in pyridine (2.0 ml) at 21 °C was added the corresponding anhydride (15.6 mmol) and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (cat.). After 24 h, the mixture was concentrated under vacuum and co-concentrated with toluene (25 ml). The residue was dissolved in methylene chloride (100 ml), washed with cold aqueous HCl (0.5 n, 100 ml), water (100 ml), and saturated NaHCO3 (100 ml). The organic layer was filtered and concentrated. Column chromatography of the residue (hexanes/ethyl acetate) on silica gel provided the corresponding per-acyl compounds in the form of syrups that crystallized upon standing.2-Acetamido-2-deoxy-1,3,4,6-tetra-O-propanoyl-α,β-d-mannopyranose (Prop4ManNAc)—(1.0 g, 99%); Rf 0.3 (hexanes:ethyl acetate, 1:1); NMR (CDCl3) (400 MHz) 1H-NMR: δ (mixture of anomers, α/β ∼10/90) 6.03 (d, 0.1H, J = 1.6), 5.87 (d, 0.9H, J = 2.0), 5.78 (d, 1H, J = 9.1), 5.34 (dd, 0.1H, J = 10.2, J = 4.6), 5.18 (t, 0.1H, J = 10.0), 5.13 (t, 0.9H, J = 9.6), 5.07 (dd, 0.9H, J = 9.8, J = 3.8), 4.75 (ddd, 0.9H, J = 9.2, J = 3.8, J = 1.8), 4.62 (ddd, 0.1H, J = 9.3, J = 4.4, J = 1.8), 4.29 (dd, 0.9H, J = 12.4, J = 5.4), 4.26 (dd, 0.1H, J = 11.3, J = 5.2), 4.11- 4.07 (m, 1H), 4.03 (m, 0.1H), 3.81 (ddd, 0.9H, J = 9.2, J = 5.3, J = 2.4), 2.43- 2.20 (m, 8H), 2.06 (s, 2.7H), 2.05 (s, 0.3H), 1.20- 1.05 (m, 12H); 13C-NMR (100 MHz): δ 173.9, 173.3, 173.2, 171.8, 171.1, 170.4, 169.9, 91.6, 90.6 (1JC1-H1 = 166), 73.5, 71.1, 68.7, 65.2, 65.1, 61.7, 60.4, 49.6, 49.4, 27.4, 27.3, 27.2, 23.3, 21.0, 14.2, 9.0, 8.9, 8.7, 8.5; FAB-MS m/z 468 [(M + Na)+]; anal. calcd. for C20H31NO10: C, 53.92; H, 7.01.

The reaction was stirred for 15 min at room temperature under a N2 atmosphere, after which 2.4 ml (19 mmol) of isobutyl chloroformate was added dropwise by a syringe. The reaction was stirred for 3.0 h, during which time a white precipitate formed. The 4-oxo-hexanoic acid carbonic anhydride was used in the next step without further purification.

Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified air atmosphere with 5% CO2.Measurement of Cell Counts and Viability—Cell counts were measured using a hemocytometer and a Coulter model Z2 cell counter. Depending on the experiment, the viable cells were detected by using either the trypan blue exclusion test, where dead cells, which absorb trypan blue, can be identified under an optical microscope, or through propidium iodide (PI) staining coupled with analysis by flow cytometry (32Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Google Scholar). Cell viability was defined by the ratio of the viable cell number to the total cell number. Lethal dose values for the panel of analogs evaluated in Fig. 9 were determined as described previously (26Jones M.B. Teng H. Rhee J.K. Baskaran G. Lahar N. Yarema K.J. Biotech. Bioeng. 2004; 85: 394-405Google Scholar).Fig. 9The toxicity of Ac4ManNR1analogs is determined by cell density and the exact N-acyl modification. Lethal dose values for Jurkat cells incubated with the panel of ManNAc analogs shown were determined by the method described by Jones and co-workers (26Jones M.B. Teng H. Rhee J.K. Baskaran G. Lahar N. Yarema K.J. Biotech. Bioeng. 2004; 85: 394-405Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Measurement of Sialic Acid Production—The production of sialic acid in cells incubated in the presence of ManNAc analogs was determined by adaptation of the periodate resorcinol assay (23Jacobs C.L.

Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 553-558Google Scholar) originally described by Jourdian and co-workers (34Jourdian G.W. Dean L. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 430-435Google Scholar). For the experiments monitoring a time-scale change of production of sialic acid in cells, cells were seeded at the same density of 1.0 × 106 cells/ml into a six-well plate. ManNAc analogs were added at the same concentration of 500 μm, and the culture was incubated for defined time periods. During incubation, aliquots of cells were collected and resuspended in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline on a daily basis (up to 4 days) for the data shown in Figs. 2 and 3, at the end of 5 days for the data shown in Fig. 10B, and after 18 h for the experiment shown in Fig. 10C. In all cases, cells were counted immediately after harvesting, and lysates were made by subjecting the cells to freeze-thaw cycles followed by periodic acid oxidation, treatment with hydrochloric acid and copper sulfate resorcinol, and quantitation by A630 readings, as described (34Jourdian G.W. Dean L. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 430-435Google Scholar) to obtain values for total sialic acid. When sialic acid content is given on a single cell basis, the number of cells used for this determination is always the final number of cells, determined immediately before lysis (and not the seeding density at the start of the experiment).Fig. 2The effect of N-acyl (R1) and hydroxyl (R2) substitutions of ManNAc analogs on sialic acid production. Total levels of cellular sialic acid were determined 48 h after the addition of 150 μm (A) or 500 μm (B) of hydroxyl-modified (R2) analog to the culture medium of Jurkat cells; corresponding data for 500 μm N-acetylated R1-modified analogs are shown in C. Data shown represent three to five replicate runs, and error bars represent standard deviation of the mean.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3The effect of a panel of unnatural ManNAc analogs on cell growth, viability, and sialic acid production. Jurkat cells were seeded at a density of 106 cells/ml and incubated in culture medium containing 500 μm of the indicated ManNAc analogs; in all cases, cells incubated without sugar analog were used as the control. The effects of hydroxyl modifications on growth, viability, and sialic acid production are shown in A–C, respectively; corresponding data are given for N-acyl modifications in D–F.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 10Inhibition of cell growth and metabolic flux through the sialic acid pathway depends on the exact position of the ketone group of the N-acyl group of Ac4ManNAc analog. Growth inhibition (A) and sialic acid production (B) after 5 days of incubation with the indicated concentrations of each ManNAc analog (delivered in the per-acetylated form) for a subline of Jurkat cells with the “sialuria” metabolic defect. C, sialic acid production for wild-type Jurkat cells incubated with 100 μm Ac4ManNAc and the indicated concentrations (x axis) of each per-acetylated analogs is given after 18 h of incubation. D, The same data as indicated in C are given, but with a focus on structurally similar analogs, and with error bars (S.D.) provided to denote statistical significance (note that the error is of similar magnitude for each dataset shown in C but is omitted for clarity of the graph).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Apoptosis AssaysCulture Conditions for Treatment of Cells with Analogs—In this study, unless otherwise specified, toxicity experiments were performed by using sugar analog concentrations of 500 μm and initial cell densities of 1.00 ×106 cells/ml. These conditions were selected because they were shown previously to support maximal levels of metabolic flux through the sialic acid pathway for Ac4ManNAc while largely avoiding toxic and growth inhibitory effects to cells (26Jones M.B. Teng H. Rhee J.K. Baskaran G. Lahar N. Yarema K.J. Biotech. Bioeng. 2004; 85: 394-405Google Scholar). These conditions, however, were close to the boundary where growth inhibition began to be manifest; therefore, all other analogs, which proved to be more toxic than Ac4ManNAc, showed enhanced toxicity and Ac4ManNAc could be considered to provide the “negative control” in these experiments.DNA Ladder Assays—For DNA ladder assays, 1.0 ×106 cells were collected by centrifugation after ManNAc analog incubation and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 24 mm EDTA, and 0.5% SDS) containing 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K and then incubated at 55 °C overnight. DNA was cleared from the lysates by centrifugation and then extracted by using an equal volume of phenol/chloroform and precipitated by adding absolute ethanol and 0.3 m ammonium acetate at –20 °C overnight. The DNA was resuspended in sterilized water, treated with RNase A at 37 °C for 1.0 h, and then analyzed by gel electrophoresis on 2.0% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml).Phosphatidylserine Membrane Asymmetry Assays—For detection of apoptosis by Annexin V, 1.0 × 106 cells were incubated with analogs, collected by centrifugation, washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and then suspended in binding buffer. The cells were then stained with FITC-labeled Annexin V and PI and analyzed by flow cytometry (32Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Google Scholar).Assay of Caspase-3 Activity—After incubation with analog, 2.0 × 106 cells were collected and washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in lysis buffer, and then incubated on ice for 10 min, after which cell debris was removed by centrifugation and supernatants were used to determine protein content and enzyme activity. Total protein concentration was measured by total assay kit (Sigma) based on the modified Lowry's method. Samples were normalized for protein concentration and then added to a reaction buffer with 400 μm DEVD-ρNA and incubated for 1.0 h at 37 °C. The ρNA light emission was quantified using a spectrophotometer (Beckman) to determine absorbance values at 405 nm.Analysis of the Expression of Sialoglycoconjugate-processing Enzymes—Total RNA was isolated from Jurkat cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA concentration was quantified spectrophotometrically, and equal amounts from each sample were used as templates for reverse-transcription PCR for first-strand DNA using Superscript RT II (Invitrogen). RNA integrity was confirmed using 18 S rRNA primers, and samples were standardized for equal levels of β-actin cDNA. PCR was performed for 30 cycles by the following program for each cycle: denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min.

(2001) Embo J. 20, 1774–1784) have demonstrated that trans-acting factors that bind to these sequences, TDP43 and Ser/Arg-rich proteins, respectively, mediate splicing inhibition. Here, we report the identification of two polypyrimidine-binding proteins, TIA-1 and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), as novel players in the regulation of CFTR exon 9 splicing. In hybrid minigene experiments, TIA-1 induced exon inclusion, whereas PTB induced exon skipping. TIA-1 bound specifically to a polypyrimidine-rich controlling element (PCE) located between the weak 5′-splice site (ss) and the intronic splicing silencer. Mutants of the PCE polypyrimidine motifs did not bind TIA-1 and, in a splicing assay, did not respond to TIA-1 splicing enhancement. PTB antagonized in vitro TIA-1 binding to the PCE, but its splicing inhibition was independent of its binding to the PCE. Recruitment of U1 small nuclear RNA to the weak 5′-ss by complementarity also induced exon 9 inclusion, consistent with the facilitating role of TIA-1 in weak 5′-ss recognition by U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein. Interestingly, in the presence of a high number of TG repeats and a low number of T repeats in the TGmTn locus, TIA-1 activated a cryptic exonic 3′-ss. This effect was independent of both TIA-1 binding to the PCE and U1 small nuclear RNA recruitment to the 5′-ss. Moreover, it was abolished by deletion of either the TG or T sequence. These data indicate that, in CFTR exon 9, TIA-1 binding to the PCE recruits U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein to the weak 5′-ss and induces exon inclusion. The TIA-1-mediated alternative usage of the 3′-splice sites, which depends on the composition of the unusual TGmTn element, represents a new mechanism of splicing regulation by TIA-1.

Tsui L.-C. Boat T. Beaudet A. Hill M.G. The Metabolic Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw Hill, New York1995: 3799-3876Google Scholar). CFTR mutations can also be associated with non-classical forms of CF in which the disease shows a tissue-specific variability such as congenital bilateral absence of vas deference and idiopathic pancreatitis (2Cohn J.A.

Extensive studies on CFTR exon 9 alternative splicing have provided a paradigmatic example of the complexity of its regulation and, in this case, the possibility of aberrant exon skipping that leads to pathological consequences. Several cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors have been identified to modulate CFTR exon 9 alternative splicing. The cis-acting elements described so far are the (TG)m(T)n polymorphic locus at 3′-end of IVS8 (3Chu C.S. Trapnell B.C. Curristin S. Cutting G.R. Crystal R.G. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), the juxtaposed enhancer and silencer exonic elements (8Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Baralle F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26580-26588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and the intronic splicing silencer (ISS). Several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that a high number of TG repeats and a low number of T tracts in the TGmTn locus induce exon skipping. In intron 9, the ISS element is located 75 bp downstream of the weak 5′-splice site (9Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Romano M. Zuccato E. Niksic M. Giglio L. Faraguna D. Baralle F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21041-21047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we identified TDP43 and members of the Ser/Arg-rich (SR) protein family as inhibitors of CFTR exon 9 alternative splicing via their interaction with the TG tract and the ISS, respectively (9Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Romano M. Zuccato E. Niksic M. Giglio L. Faraguna D. Baralle F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21041-21047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 10Buratti E. Dork T. Zuccato E. Pagani F. Romano M. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar); interestingly, the expression level of these proteins is higher in the mostly affected CF tissues (10Buratti E. Dork T. Zuccato E. Pagani F. Romano M. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). No enhancing splicing factor has been identified so far to activate CFTR exon 9 inclusion. Its role could be important to counteract splicing inhibition and to modulate the tissue-specific phenotypic expression in non-classical CF forms. TIA-1 and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) are two splicing factors involved in the regulation of alternative splicing. Both recognize intronic polypyrimidine-rich sequences, mainly located in introns, and promote exon inclusion or skipping, respectively. TIA-1 binding to polypyrimidine-rich sequences downstream of the 5′-splice site (ss) is involved in the recognition of exons that contain weak 5′-splice sites. Sequence analysis of TIA-1, initially identified as an apoptotic protein (11Tian Q. Streuli M. Saito H. Schlossman S.F. Anderson P. Cell. 1991; 67: 629-639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), revealed that it contains three RNA recognition motifs, and its amino acid sequence shows close homology to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nam8p protein, a U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex component (12Gottschalk A. Tang J. Puig O. Salgado J. Neubauer G. Colot H.V. Mann M. Seraphin B. Rosbash M. Luhrmann R. Fabrizio P. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 374-393PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro selection/amplification assays have shown a preference for TIA-1 binding to RNAs containing short stretches of uridines, although a core binding sequence has not been recognized (13Dember L.M. Kim N.D. Liu K.Q. Anderson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2783-2788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Acting on weak 5′-splice sites followed by U-rich stretches, TIA-1 modulates the alternative splicing of Drosophila msl-2 and human fas receptor pre-mRNAs (14Forch P. Puig O. Kedersha N. Martinez C. Granneman S. Seraphin B. Anderson P. Valcarcel J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1089-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The TIA-1 effect may be critical for U1 snRNP recruitment and stabilization to these weak 5′-splice sites. Interaction between TIA-1 and U1-C, one of the three U1-specific polypeptides (15Forch P. Puig O. Martinez C. Seraphin B. Valcarcel J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6882-6892Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), stabilizes the association of both proteins and consequently of U1 snRNP with the adjacent 5′-ss followed by the U-rich stretch. In one case, TIA-1 in vivo depletion resulted in a different choice of a wild type normal 3′-ss partner, but the mechanism involved is not known (14Forch P. Puig O. Kedersha N. Martinez C. Granneman S. Seraphin B. Anderson P. Valcarcel J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1089-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). U-rich polypyrimidine tracts can also interact with PTB. PTB is a well characterized splicing factor involved in repression of the cell-specific splicing pattern in inappropriate cell types (16Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3281-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Multiple intronic PTB-binding sites distributed on the entire length of pre-mRNAs have been found to mediate splicing repression in several alternatively spliced mRNAs (17Carstens R.P. McKeehan W.L. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2205-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18Gooding C. Roberts G.C. Smith C.W. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 85-100PubMed Google Scholar, 19Southby J.

The ability of PTB to multimerize led to the suggestion that it establishes a “zone of silencing” within a pre-mRNA, preventing splice site usage and that, in this manner, it mediates exon silencing (16Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3281-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 23Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 943-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the region between the weak 5′-ss of CFTR exon 9 and the ISS has an important regulatory role in alternative splicing. This polypyrimidine-rich controlling element (PCE) contains a peculiar arrangement of three polypyrimidine-rich (PY) motifs. TIA-1 binding to the PCE increased exon 9 inclusion, possibly stabilizing U1 snRNP interaction with pre-mRNA. In contrast, PTB showed an opposite effect and caused an increase in exon 9 skipping. In addition, we also report that TIA-1 induced the selection of a cryptic exonic 3′-ss independently of its facilitating role in 5′-ss recognition mediated by U1 snRNP. Taken together, these data increase the number of factors involved in the complex regulation of CFTR exon 9 alternative splicing and for the first time show the involvement of a splicing factor with enhancing activity in CFTR exon 9 recognition. Plasmid Construction—The wild-type constructs carrying variable combinations of (TG)m(T)n repeats at the polymorphic locus and hCF-Δint2 have been described previously (9Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Romano M. Zuccato E. Niksic M. Giglio L. Faraguna D. Baralle F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21041-21047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The mutations introduced in the PY motifs were obtained by PCR with different oligonucleotide sets using templates with different mutations inserted. The resulting products were digested with BamHI/KpnI and cloned into the CFTR intron 9 sequence contained in the NdeI insert of the modified pBluescript plasmid (pBSCFNde) described previously (24Niksic M. Romano M. Buratti E. Pagani F. Baralle F.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2339-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The mutagenized NdeI fragment was then subcloned in the NdeI-digested TG11T5 minigene. The BamHI/KpnI cassettes were created by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis using different primers for each cassette: M1, CF9junAdir (5′-ctggatccactggagcaggcaaggtagttcatttg-3′); M2, CFA/3-2bsdir (5′-ctggatccactggagcaggcaaggtagttcttttgttcatc-3′); M1,2, the same primer as M1, but on the M2 template; M2A, CF9/2bsmut (5′-ctggatccactggagcaggcaaggtagttcttttgtaaatc-3′); and M1,2A, CF9/1,2bsmut (5′-ctggatccactggagcaggcaaggtagtgaatttgtaaatc-3′). For all amplifications, the reverse primer used was UNI REV (5′-ggaaacagctatgaccatg-3′). For M3, a two-step overlap extension method was used. For the first amplification, the two sets of primers used were as follows: hCFex9/in9dir (5′-ctggatccactggagcaggcaaggtagttcttttg-3′) and ΔYrev (5′-caaactgcaggacaccaaattaagttcttaat-3′); and ΔYdir (5′-gtgtcctgcagtttgtagtgctggaaggtat-5′) and UNI REV. For the second amplification, the hCFex9/in9dir and UNI REV set was used. For M1,2,3, CF9/1,2bsmut (5′-ctggatccactggagcaggcaaggtagtgaatttgtaaatc-3′) and UNI REV on the ΔM3 template were used. A derivative of pHU1 (25Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Bendix R. Dork T. Baralle F.E. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) was used to prepare EX9U1-5′-ss. This variant was created as described (25Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Bendix R. Dork T. Baralle F.E. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) using oligonucleotides EX9U1-5′-ssDIR (5′-gatctcagaactacctggcaggggagataccat-3′) and EX9U1-5′-ssREV (5′-gatcatggtatctcccctgccaggtagttctga-3′). Analysis of Hybrid Minigene Expression—Transient transfection of Hep3B cells, RNA extraction, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, and quantitation of PCR products were done as described previously (9Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Romano M. Zuccato E. Niksic M. Giglio L. Faraguna D. Baralle F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21041-21047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The α2 and B2 primers have been described previously (9Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Romano M. Zuccato E. Niksic M. Giglio L. Faraguna D. Baralle F.E. J. Biol.

The pHI plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. M. G. Romanelli. The pTIA-1 expression plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. R. Breathnach. If not specified otherwise, 1 μg of pHI or pTIA-1 plasmid was used in cotransfection experiments. UV Cross-linking Assay—The T7SW Eco competitor was prepared by cutting and religating the pBSCFNde construct with EcoRI and KpnI enzymes. The 3′-h3′int competitor was prepared by cutting and religating the pBSCFNde construct with SacI and BamHI enzymes. The pBIND competitor was prepared by cloning the EcoRI/BamHI fragment of exon 9 into pBSSK. The competitors in intron 9 that span the first 77 nucleotides were prepared directly by cloning the PCR product (direct primer, hCFex9/in9dir; and reverse primer, IN9Hind/Kpn (5′-ggaagcttccaaaagcttccagcac-3′)) digested with BamHI/HindIII into pBSSK. The pEND competitor was prepared digesting the ΔM3 PCR product with PstI/KpnI and cloning the insert into pBSSK. Each competitor was linearized and used for in vitro transcription and UV cross-linking assays as described previously (9Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Romano M. Zuccato E. Niksic M. Giglio L.

Immunoprecipitation Experiments—Polyclonal antiserum against PTB was obtained by immunizing a New Zealand White 3-month-old rabbit according to standard protocols. PTB immunoprecipitation experiments were done as described previously (10Buratti E. Dork T. Zuccato E. Pagani F. Romano M. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). TIA-1 immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described (26Del Gatto-Konczak F. Bourgeois C.F. Le Guiner C. Kister L. Gesnel M.C. Stevenin J. Breathnach R. Mol. Cell.

Pull-down Assay—The unlabeled RNA probes were prepared as described previously (9Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Romano M. Zuccato E. Niksic M. Giglio L. Faraguna D. Baralle F.E. J. Biol.

Reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h in the dark at room temperature. The RNA was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 100 μl of 0.1 m NaOAc (pH 5.0). Then, 300 μl of a 50% adipic acid dihydrazideagarose bead slurry (Sigma) were washed four times with 10 ml of 0.1 m NaOAc (pH 5.0) and pelleted after each wash at 3000 rpm for 3 min. After the final wash, 300 μl of 0.1 m NaOAc (pH 5.0) were added to the beads. The slurry was then mixed with the periodate-treated RNA and incubated for 12 h at 4 °C on a rotator. The beads with the bound RNA were pelleted and washed three times with 2 ml of 2 m NaCl and three times with 3 ml of buffer A (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7), 6.5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). They were incubated with 0.6 mg of HeLa cell nuclear extract for 20 min at 30 °C in a final volume of 650 μl, pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 3 min, and washed five times with 5 ml of buffer A containing 4 mm MgCl2. After the final centrifugation, 60 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer were added to the beads and heated for 5 min at 90 °C before loading onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. PY Motifs near the CFTR Exon 9 5′-ss Are Intronic Splicing Enhancers—The intronic region between the 5′-ss of CFTR exon 9 and the previously reported ISS contains three distinct pyrimidine-rich elements, PY1, PY2, and PY3 (Fig. 1B). PY1 and PY2 are separated only by a purine residue and together span 13 nucleotides close to the exon/intron junction. The PY3 element is located 30 nucleotides downstream of PY2 and is composed of 15 contiguous pyrimidine residues (Fig. 1B). We prepared CFTR exon 9 hybrid minigenes containing mutations in the pyrimidine-rich elements as shown in Fig. 1B. Hybrid minigenes were transfected in Hep3B cells, and the pattern of splicing was analyzed by RT-PCR amplification using specific primers. Fig. 1C shows the effects of single and multiple mutations on the efficiency of splicing. The control wild-type hCFTG11T5 construct (lane 1) resulted in 65 ± 5% exon 9 inclusion, as previously reported (9Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Romano M. Zuccato E. Niksic M. Giglio L. Faraguna D. Baralle F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21041-21047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Using the M1 and M3 constructs, with mutations in PY1 and PY3, the level of exon 9 inclusion was ∼60%, i.e. not significantly different from TG11T5 (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 7). Disruption of the PY2 motif in M2 (TCTT motif in PY2 changed to TCAT) and M2A (TCTT motif changed to AAAT) produced 35 ± 3 and 37 ± 4% exon inclusion, respectively (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 5). Significantly lower levels of exon 9 inclusion were observed in the double mutants M1,2 and M1,2A, corresponding to 22 ± 4 and 23 ± 2%, respectively (Fig. 1C, lanes 4 and 6), indicating that mutations in PY1 contribute to splicing regulation when associated with mutations in PY2 (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 3 and 4). The disruption of all three PY motifs (M1,2,3) resulted in the lowest level of exon 9 inclusion (13 ± 2%) (Fig. 1C, lane 8), which was also significantly different compared with the M1,2 and M1,2A mutants, suggesting a combined effect of the three PY motifs. Our previous work also showed that an exon 9 cryptic band originated from the recognition of a cryptic 3′-ss in exon 9 (10Buratti E. Dork T. Zuccato E. Pagani F. Romano M. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Using the same construct (hcFTG11T5), the percentage of this cryptic band was very low and did not change significantly upon comparison of the wild-type and mutant constructs. These results indicate that the intronic sequence between the 5′-ss and the ISS, which we have named PCE for polypyrimidine-rich controlling element, constitutes a new intronic splicing regulatory element involved in the modulation of CFTR exon 9 alternative splicing. Functional Relationship between the (TG)m(T)n Locus, ISS, and PCE—Previous studies have shown that exon 9 inclusion is modulated by the polymorphic (TG)m(T)n locus near the 3′-ss and by the ISS in intron 9 (3Chu C.S. Trapnell B.C. Curristin S. Cutting G.R. Crystal R.G. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 9Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Romano M. Zuccato E. Niksic M. Giglio L. Faraguna D. Baralle F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21041-21047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). An increase in the length of the TG tract or a reduction of the U-rich stretch induces exon 9 skipping. In addition, a high number of TG repeats (>13) and a low number of T repeats (<5) induces a significant activation of a cryptic 3′-ss in exon 9. We have now evaluated the enhancing effect of the PCE in relation to the ISS and to the composition of the polymorphic (TG)m(T)n locus. Mutations in the three PY motifs in the PCE were evaluated in the context of the TG11T7 and TG13T5 variants of intron 8 or in combination with deletion of the ISS. The levels of exon 9 inclusion in the wild-type TG11T7 and TG13T5 minigenes were 90 and 40%, respectively (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 3). In comparison with these constructs, the TG11T7/M1,2,3 and TG13T5/M1,2,3 minigenes resulted in reduced exon 9 inclusion (80 and 7%, respectively) (Fig. 1D, lanes 2 and 4). The TG13T5 minigenes showed, as expected, usage of the cryptic 3′-ss, but the percentage of inclusion was not significantly affected in the PCE mutants (see additional experiments in Fig. 5). Deletion of the ISS from the wild-type minigene (hCFΔISS) resulted in 95% exon inclusion (Fig. 1D, lane 5) because of the absence of the ISS inhibitory element, as previously reported (9Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Romano M. Zuccato E. Niksic M. Giglio L. Faraguna D. Baralle F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21041-21047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In comparison with hCFΔISS, mutations in all of the PY motifs (M1,2,3ΔISS) reduced the level of exon inclusion to 55% (Fig. 1D, lane 8). Mutation in PY1 (M1ΔISS) or in both PY1 and PY2 (M1,2ΔISS) produced 90 and 75% exon inclusion, respectively (Fig. 1D, lanes 6 and 7). These results indicate that the enhancing effect of the PCE is modulated by differences in the (TG)m(T)n locus and by the ISS element. Thus, the PCE represents a new intronic element that, along with the ISS in intron 9 and the (TG)m(T)n element in intron 8, modulates CFTR exon 9 alternative splicing. This new intronic element could affect the efficiency of recognition of the upstream weak 5′-ss through binding of a specific splicing factor to the PY motifs. Role of the Polypyrimidine-binding Proteins TIA-1 and PTB in CFTR Exon 9 Alternative Splicing—To study the influence of TIA-1 and PTB on CFTR exon 9 alternative splicing, we performed transient cotransfection experiments. Hep3B cells were transfected with the TG11T5 minigene alone or with increasing amounts of TIA-1 or PTB expression vector. TIA-1 expression induced a dose-dependent increase in exon 9 inclusion (Fig. 2A). In fact, in comparison with the basal level of exon 9 inclusion obtained using the TG11T5 minigene (65%), TIA-1 overexpression increased inclusion to ∼90% at the highest vector concentrations (Fig. 2A). In contrast, cotransfection with increasing amounts of the PTB expression vector (pHI) resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of exon 9 splicing. It is interesting to note that TIA-1 is the only splicing factor identified so far that stimulates CFTR exon 9 inclusion. In fact, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1, TDP43, PTB, and several other SR proteins induce CFTR exon 9 skipping (9Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Romano M. Zuccato E. Niksic M. Giglio L. Faraguna D. Baralle F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21041-21047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 10Buratti E. Dork T. Zuccato E. Pagani F. Romano M. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of the multiple PY motifs, we studied the effect of TIA-1 and PTB overexpression using several mutant PCE minigenes (Fig. 2C). The enhancing effect of TIA-1 was observed in the case of the M1, M2, and M2A mutants and the double mutants M1,2 and M1,2A, whereas a lower response was observed with the M3 mutant (Fig. 2C). In contrast, TIA-1 overexpression did not induce exon 9 inclusion with the M1,2,3 minigene, in which all of the PY motifs of the PCE had been mutated (Fig. 2C). This indicates that the effect of TIA-1 on CFTR exon 9 splicing requires mainly the contribution of PY3. However, the complete absence of any response to TIA-1 overexpression in the M1,2,3 minigene suggests the possible additional contribution of the other polypyrimidine-rich sequences of PCE. These results also establish that TIA-1 increases CFTR exon 9 inclusion in a PCE-dependent manner. In contrast, overexpression of PTB reduced exon 9 inclusion with all of the minigenes (Fig. 2D). The percentage of exon 9 inclusion was ∼33–35% with the wild-type, M1, and M3 minigenes and was almost 10–12% with the other mutants. Interestingly, the M1,2,3 minigene was sensitive to PTB overexpression, and the level of exon 9 inclusion was reduced to ∼4% (Fig. 2D). These results are in agreement with the general splicing inhibitory role of PTB, mediated by binding to multiple exonic and intronic sequences (18Gooding C. Roberts G.C. Smith C.W. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 85-100PubMed Google Scholar, 19Southby J. Gooding C. Smith C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2699-2711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Chou M.Y. Underwood J.G. Nikolic J. Luu M.H.

TIA-1 and PTB Binding to the PCE—To investigate the ability of TIA-1 and PTB to bind to the PCE in intron 9, different in vitro transcribed, [32P]UTP-labeled RNA probes (Fig. 3A) were incubated with HeLa nuclear extracts, followed by UV cross-linking. The samples were then immunoprecipitated with specific anti-TIA-1 or anti-PTB polyclonal antibodies. The RNAs used correspond to the last 10 bases of exon 9 and extend down to the ISS element in intron 9. The anti-TIA-1 antibody immunoprecipitated a double band at 40–44 kDa when the wild-type PCE RNA was used (Fig. 3B, lane 2). This doublet corresponds to the previously reported isoforms of this splicing factor (28Kawakami A. Tian Q. Duan X. Streuli M. Schlossman S.F. Anderson P. Proc. Natl"

Short chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) 1The abbreviations used are: SDR, short chain dehydrogenase/reductase; 17β-HSD, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; E1, estrone; E2, 17β-estradiol; A-dione, androstanedione; 4-dione, androstenedione; DHT, dihydrotestosterone; NMN, nicotinamide mononucleotide; PEG, polyethylene glycol; RMSD, root mean-squared deviation. form a large, functionally heterogeneous protein family presently with about 3000 primary sequences deposited in databases and the corresponding genomes represent all forms of life (1Oppermann U. Filling C. Hult M. Shafqat N. Wu X. Lindh M. Shafqat J. Nordling E. Kallberg Y. Persson B. Jornvall H. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2003; 143-144: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). The enzymes in the SDR family span several EC classes, from oxidoreductases and lyases to isomerases, with oxidoreductases as the majority (1Oppermann U. Filling C. Hult M. Shafqat N. Wu X. Lindh M. Shafqat J. Nordling E. Kallberg Y. Persson B. Jornvall H. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2003; 143-144: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). As a member of the SDR family (2Jornvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar), human estrogenic 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD1, EC.1.1.1.62) catalyzes the conversion of an inactive estrogen, estrone (E1), to the biologically active estrogen, 17β-estradiol (E2) (3Luu-The V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies in women worldwide, and estrogens play an important role in the development of hormone-dependent breast cancer (4Vihko R. Apter D. CRC Crit. Rev. Oncol./Hematol. 1989; 9: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This enzyme has been demonstrated to be involved in maintaining high E2 levels in breast tumors of postmenopausal women (5Poutanen M. Isomaa V. Peltoketo H. Vihko R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 55: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 6Miyoshi Y. Ando A. Shiba E. Taguchi T. Tamaki Y. Noguchi S. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 94: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Because E2 has a stimulatory effect on the proliferation of breast cancer cells (7Bonney R.C. Reed M.J. Beranek P.A. Ghilchik M.W. James V.H. J. Steroid Biochem. 1986; 24: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), blocking its formation by specific inhibition of 17β-HSD1 should be of paramount importance for the control of breast tumor growth. To develop new compounds capable to inhibit 17β-HSD1, a series of structure/function studies were conducted in several laboratories focusing on the understanding of steroid binding to the enzyme. The mechanism for estrogen (C18-steroid) recognition by 17β-HSD1 was previously studied using the crystallographic structure of the enzyme with estradiol (8Azzi A. Rehse P.H. Zhu D.W. Campbell R.L. Labrie F. Lin S.X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 9Breton R. Housset D. Mazza C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Structure. 1996; 4: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Despite the similar hydrophobicity existing between estrogens (C18-steorid) and androgens (C19-steroid), however, 17β-HSD1 exhibits a high substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency toward estrogens such as estrone (E1) but insignificant ability to catalyze the conversion of androgens (10Mendoza-Hernandez G. Calcagno M. Sanchez-Nuncio H.R. Diaz-Zagoya J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 119: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 11Gangloff A. Garneau A. Huang Y.W. Yang F. Lin S.X. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 269-276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent investigation showed that androgens (C19-steroid) can bind in an alternative mode to the protein through a combined study of enzyme kinetics and x-ray crystallography (12Gangloff A. Shi R. Nahoum V. Lin S.X. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The original aim of our investigation is to further study the mechanism of steroid recognition and discrimination adopted by 17β-HSD1. Here we report the crystal structures of two ternary complexes: 17β-HSD1-androstanedione (A-dione)-NADP and 17β-HSD1-androstenedione (4-dione)-NADP, as well as the binary complex of 17β-HSD1-NADP. Surprisingly, these NADP complexes, combined with all available crystal structures of SDR family enzymes, reveal a critical interaction between the enzyme and the cofactor, which is highly conserved among SDR family enzymes. Purification and Crystallization Procedures—17β-HSD1 was purified from fresh human placenta according to a previously described rapid purification procedure (13Lin S.X. Yang F. Jin J.Z. Breton R. Zhu D.W. Luu-The V. Labrie F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16182-16187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Yang F. Zhu D.W. Wang J.Y. Lin S.X. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 582: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Protein concentration for the homogeneous 17β-HSD1 was determined using the Bradford assay. The protein sample was concentrated to 15∼17 mg/ml in a buffer containing 40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, and 0.06% (w/v) β-OG. The optimized crystallization conditions were derived from previous results (15Zhu D.W. Lee X. Breton R. Ghosh D. Pangborn W. Daux W.L. Lin S.X. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For the A-dione ternary complex, the reservoir solution contained 30% PEG-4K, 0.16 m MgCl2, 60 mm Hepes, pH 7.5 and 20% glycerol. For the 4-dione complex, the reservoir solution contained 30% PEG-4K, 0.16 m MgCl2, 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 20% glycerol. For the NADP binary complex, the reservoir solution contained 29% PEG-4K, 0.16 m MgCl2, 60 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 20% glycerol. 17β-HSD1 apoenzyme was crystallized at 27 °C using the vapor-diffusion technique in hanging drops. Crystals appeared within 1 week and then the ligand stock solutions were introduced to the drops by several small additions. The final concentration of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or testosterone was 1 mm. NADP was added to reach the final concentration of 2 mm and 3 mm in the binary and ternary complex, respectively. The soaking procedure lasted around 2 weeks before data collection. X-ray Data Collection and Processing—Diffraction data were collected from one cryo-cooled crystal for each complex using synchrotron radiation (beam line X8C, National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory; λ = 0.9795 Å, 100 K) while the crystal was oscillated through 1 or 1.5° steps. Complete data sets were collected at 1.63, 1.89, and 1.81 Å for the A-dione ternary complex, the 4-dione ternary complex and the NADP binary complex, respectively. The diffraction data were processed using the HKL program suite (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Structure Determination—Because the three crystals are isomorphous with that of the 1.54 Å resolution testosterone complex structure previously determined (PDB accession code: 1JTV), structure determinations were carried out starting with phases calculated from the testosterone complex structure, omitting the testosterone and solvent molecules. The models were updated until completion using Refmac (17Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) for refinement and O (18Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) for model rebuilding. In a second step of the modeling, coordinates for steroids and cofactors were added into the model and refined. In the last cycles, water was automatically built by using the program ARP (19Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 269-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and checked manually. The occupancy of a few disordered side chains was assumed to be 0.01. The residues situated in the loop and the C-terminal chain were not modeled because no electron density could be located. The stereochemistry of the final models was verified with the program PROCHECK (20Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Final statistics for all the refined structures are summarized in Table I.

Overall Structure and Model Quality—Crystals employed in this investigation belonged to space group C2 and contained one subunit per asymmetric unit. Two C19-steroid ternary complexes, 17β-HSD1-A-dione-NADP, and 17β-HSD1-4-dione-NADP, were refined at 1.63 and 1.89 Å, respectively. The 17β-HSD1-NADP binary complex was refined at 1.81 Å. All three models show good stereochemistry (22Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1395-1400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) and the quality of the refined models can be assessed from the statistics in Table I. As observed in previous models (8Azzi A. Rehse P.H. Zhu D.W. Campbell R.L. Labrie F. Lin S.X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 9Breton R. Housset D.

The protein parts of these three complexes are very similar to the previously published structures, with root mean-square deviations (RMSD) between these complexes and the E2 complex (8Azzi A. Rehse P.H. Zhu D.W. Campbell R.L. Labrie F. Lin S.X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) at 0.55, 0.52, and 0.53 Å, respectively, for the α-carbon of 276 amino acids excluding the above-mentioned flexible parts. 17β-HSD1-NADP Binary Complex—The NADP molecule is well defined in the electron density maps (Fig. 1), and the location and overall conformation of NADP are very similar to that of previously determined 17β-HSD1(H221L)-E2-NADP complex (25Mazza C. Breton R. Housset D. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8145-8152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It binds to the enzyme in an extended conformation with the adenine ring in an anti conformation and the nicotinamide ring in a syn conformation. Most interactions between NADP and the nicotinamide dinucleotide binding pocket of 17β-HSD1 have been described earlier (24Sawicki M.W. Erman M. Puranen T. Vihko P. Ghosh D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 840-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 25Mazza C. Breton R. Housset D. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8145-8152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Stabilization of the nicotinamide ring is achieved through hydrophilic interactions and hydrophobic contacts. The nicotinamide ring packs against the side chains of Val188 and Cys185 and its carboxamide group forms hydrogen bonds with the Val188 peptidic amide group and the side chain of Thr190. In addition, the intramolecular hydrogen bond between the carboxamide group and the pyrophosphate moiety also contributes to the stabilization of the glycosidic bond in the syn conformation, burying the A face of the ring against the protein and exposing the B face to the active site. 17β-HSD1-A-dione-NADP Complex—The electron density for the steroid was clearly visible from the initial Fourier difference map. The model of dihydrotestosterone molecule retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (Ref. 21Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27935) Google Scholar, accession code: 1D2S) was fitted to the (mFo-dFc) electron density map. As observed in the testosterone complex, this C19-steroid also adopts the reverse orientation, which differs from the binding mode of estradiol. However, the atoms in the D-ring of dihydrotestosterone cannot fit well into the density although all other atoms fit very well. The density map strongly suggests that the atoms O17, C17, C13, and C16 are located on the same plane, which is characteristic of a ketone group. This phenomenon demonstrates that DHT has been oxidized into A-dione in the presence of NADP during the soaking procedure. The previous kinetic studies have pointed out that the 17β-hydroxyl group of DHT can be oxidized to a 17-keto group by 17β-HSD1 in the presence of NADP (10Mendoza-Hernandez G. Calcagno M. Sanchez-Nuncio H.R. Diaz-Zagoya J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 119: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 11Gangloff A. Garneau A. Huang Y.W. Yang F. Lin S.X. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 269-276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When DHT was introduced to the hanging drop, it would preferentially bind to the enzyme in a reverse way, however, this does not exclude the possibility that a very small percentage of DHT molecules can bind to the enzyme in the normal binding mode and subsequently be oxidized because of the presence of NADP in the enzyme molecule. Although the catalytic efficiency is rather low compared with that for estrone reduction, the long soaking time (around 2 weeks) guarantees that all the DHT molecules can be oxidized into A-dione in the presence of excess NADP in the drop. After the reaction, the oxidized product A-dione can leave the active site, and then rebind to the enzyme in a reverse orientation, which is energetically more favorable. Consequently, the A-dione molecule was constructed based on the coordinates of the DHT molecule and then refined with the rest of the model. Similar to testosterone and estradiol, A-dione binds snugly in the narrow hydrophobic tunnel of 17β-HSD1 with its D-ring approaching the substrate recognition end of the protein (Fig. 2). The hydrophilic ends of A-dione are maintained by three hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bonding interaction at the O3 end is the same as that of the testosterone complex, that is to say, O3 makes a water-mediated hydrogen bond (W51, 2.58 Å) with the main chain nitrogen of Val188 (Fig. 2). Similar to the testosterone complex, the hydrogen bonding interaction between O17 and His221 is also maintained. However, the 17-keto group cannot make a direct hydrogen bond with the carboxylate group of Glu282 because of the lack of a hydrogen donor. As a consequence of the potential repulsion between them, the side chain of Glu282 rotates away to provide space for a bridging water molecule (Fig. 2, W149), which is within the hydrogen bonding distance of the following atoms: O17 of A-dione (3.30 Å), OE1 of Glu282 (2.74 Å), NE2 of His221 (2.87 Å) and thus eliminates the potential polar repulsion between O17 and the carboxylate group of Glu282. Superposition of the residues in the binding pockets of A-dione, testosterone, and estradiol complexes reveals little change on the conformations for these residues. Except for the two residues (His221 and Glu282), the steroid binding pocket of A-dione and testosterone complexes are essentially the same. A-dione and testosterone are also located in very similar positions. The residues in the cofactor binding site do not show any significant conformational change compared with the above NADP binary complex. In the density map, there is clear electron density for the adenine and the adenine ribose of the NADP molecule. However, the electron density corresponding to the nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) moiety of NADP molecule is poorly defined in the density maps (Fig. 3). The presence of only a few disconnected density peaks in this region led to the conclusion that the nicotinamide and its attached ribose are disordered in the crystal. Thus, these atoms were omitted from further refinement cycles. One water molecule (W51), occupying the position of the carboxamide oxygen of the NADP molecule in the above cofactor binary complex, is well defined because of its strong spherical density that persisted during cycles of refinement. Unlike the previously described NADP binary complex, the electron density for the 2′-phosphate group attached to the adenine ribose is remarkably poor. This is not difficult to understand considering the fact that the side chain of Arg37 has moved to the protein surface and is out of the hydrogen bonding distance of the 2′-phosphate group. The loss of the stabilization interaction by Arg37 releases the phosphate group, which is thus distributed more randomly in the cavity. To obtain comparable temperature factors for the adenine nucleotide moiety, the occupancy of these atoms is set to 0.75 and that of the phosphate group to 0.01 because of its invisibility in the electron density maps. Refined B factors for the well defined portion of NADP with occupancy fixed at 0.75 range from 29 to 49 Å2. The average B factor for these atoms is 37 Å2, compatible with that of all protein atoms (32 Å2). 17β-HSD1-4-dione-NADP Complex—The structure of the 17β-HSD1-4-dione-NADP ternary complex displays high similarity to that of the A-dione complex and the C19-steroid molecule adopts the same orientation as A-dione. The clearly interpretable electron density for the steroid indicates that 17β-hydroxyl has been oxidized to 17-ketone, that is, testosterone has been converted into 4-dione under crystallization conditions. Similar to the oxidation of DHT, a very small percentage of testosterone molecules can bind to the enzyme with its 17β-hydroxyl group approaching the catalytic residues and subsequently be oxidized into 4-dione, which is also supported by the previous kinetic studies (10Mendoza-Hernandez G. Calcagno M. Sanchez-Nuncio H.R. Diaz-Zagoya J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 119: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). After 4-dione leaves the active site, it will rebind to the enzyme in a reverse orientation as shown in the present ternary complex. Although the previous high-resolution 17β-HSD1-testosterone binary complex structure unambiguously showed that testosterone binds in a reverse orientation within the cavity, this is not contradictory to the kinetic results, because a very small percentage of substrate bound in a different orientation may be undetectable in the x-ray structure while it could contribute significantly to the enzymatic activity observed under catalytic conditions. The 4-dione molecule basically stays at the same position as testosterone in the testosterone complex with only a very small rotation around the long axis (O3-O17). For example, the shifted distances of the relative oxygen atoms are less than 0.4 Å. The 3-keto group (O3) of the 4-dione molecule, identical to those of testosterone and A-dione, is anchored to the main chain of Val188 by a bridging solvent molecule (W57) (Fig. 4). In the other hydrophilic end, unlike the A-dione complex, the present 4-dione complex does not show the existence of a bridging water molecule between the O17 and the Glu282 side chain. To avoid the polar repulsion from the O17 of 4-dione, the OE1 of Glu282 moved about 1.2 Å compared with that of the testosterone complex. Thus, the hydrogen bonding interaction made by the O17 of 4-dione only involves His221 (2.65 Å). Without the hydrogen bonding interaction, the Glu282 side chain might become more flexible, as indicated by its increased B factors (∼61 Å2) compared with that of the A-dione complex (∼47 Å2) although the overall B factors are quite similar (37 Å2 for the 4-dione complex versus 33 Å2 for the A-dione complex). Similarly, the relatively high B factors of the 4-dione molecule (62 Å2), compared with that of A-dione and testosterone, could also be partly explained by the absence of hydrogen bonding interaction with Glu282 because both testosterone and A-dione make hydrogen bonds to Glu282 either directly or via a bridging solvent molecule. No apparent difference can be observed for the cofactor binding site between the 4-dione complex and the A-dione complex. Similarly, we are unable to see the NMN moiety of the NADP molecule in the electron density maps. Thus, no attempt was made to refine the positions of the NMN group. The apparent existence of two ordered solvent molecules (W57, W112) in this cavity suggests that, in the crystal, the NMN moiety spends little or no time in that site. Nicotinamide Ring Binding Site of the SDR Family—As of September 2003, crystal structures have been determined and coordinates deposited in the Protein Data Bank for 35 members of SDR family (two of them are structural neighbors of the SDR family and the same enzyme in different species is just counted once), among which 33 are of complexes with the cofactor NAD(P)(H) (21Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27935) Google Scholar). The corresponding PDB accession codes for these 33 NAD(P)(H) complexes are listed as follows: 1AHH, 1AE1, 1B14, 1BDB, 1G1A, 1BVR, 1CYD, 1DHR, 1DOH, 1E3W, 1EDO, 1EQ2, 1E7W, 1GCO, 1GEG, 1GZ6, 1H5Q, 1JA9, 1N5D, 1N7H, 1N2S, 1NFF, 1OAA, 1QRR, 1QYV, 1K6X, 1HDO, 2HSD, 2AE2, 1BSV, 1EK5, 1FK8, and 1IY8. Investigation of these 33 structures reveals that at least as many as 29 proteins (all of the above list except the last four) share the common binding interaction with the carboxamide group of the nicotinamide ring. All these 29 cofactors are bound in the classical “Rossmann fold” of SDR family proteins and demonstrate high similarity in their orientation and conformation regardless of their redox states. The carboxamide group of NAD(P)(H) plays an important role in the specific orientation of the nicotinamide ring relative to enzyme catalytic groups. As observed for the 17β-HSD1-NADP binary complex in which the peptidic amide group of Val188 forms a hydrogen bond with the carboxamide group of NADP, a main chain amide group, found in all of these 29 proteins and which is located at the binding site of the nicotinamide ring, functions as a hydrogen donor to anchor the carboxamide group, thus stabilizing the binding of the cofactor. Nevertheless, this main chain amide does not belong to one specific residue type. In fact, the corresponding residues are quite variable, ranging from as small as serine to as bulky as phenylalanine. Among them, 9 of 29 are valine and another 9 are isoleucine. The residues in the other 11 enzymes consist of asparagine, leucine, threonine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, histidine, serine, and alanine. Other than this interaction, the second next residue (Thr190 in the case of 17β-HSD1) downstream from the previous residue is also conserved in 21 of 35 proteins. These 21 proteins share a common residue threonine at this position, which is found, in 12 of 19 cofactor containing crystal structures, to form a bifurcated hydrogen bond with the carboxamide group and one phosphoryl oxygen of the cofactor. To understand the recognition and discrimination of sex steroids by 17β-HSD1, great efforts have been made via different approaches including enzyme kinetics, mutagenesis, and x-ray crystallography. Consistent with all the other available 17β-HSD1-steroid complexes, our present models demonstrate that hydrophobic interactions between the steroid and the substrate-binding pocket are required to mai"
https://openalex.org/W1980426959,"Acyl-CoA:monoacylglycerol acyltransferase-2 (MGAT2) catalyzes the synthesis of diacylglycerol and differs from the MGAT1 and MGAT3 in tissue distribution at the mRNA level. In addition to the small intestine, MGAT2 mRNA is also expressed at high levels in human liver, the lower gastrointestinal tract, and the mouse kidney, but the physiological significance of such expression has not yet been studied. Using an affinity-purified antibody, the present study investigated the expression of murine MGAT2 protein along the intestinal tract, determined its subcellular localization, and studied its regulation by diet and in db/db mouse. Results demonstrate a high level of MGAT2 expression in the small intestine in a proximal-to-distal gradient that correlated well with both MGAT enzyme activity and fat absorption pattern. In contrast, MGAT2 protein was not detectable in other sections of the digestive tract, including stomach, cecum, colon, and rectum, or other mouse tissues such as kidney, liver, and adipocytes. Immunohistological studies provided direct evidence that the enzyme is expressed not only in the villi, but also in the crypt regions of the small intestine, which suggests that MGAT2 expression occurs prior to the maturation of enterocytes. MGAT2 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in both MGAT2-transfected COS-7 and Caco-2 cells, indicating that the ER is the primary site for dietary fat re-synthesis. MGAT2 expression appeared not to be affected by diabetes in the db/db mouse, however, the total intestinal MGAT activity was significantly enhanced. Finally, an up-regulation of both MGAT2 protein expression and MGAT activity was observed in mice fed a high fat diet, implicating a role of MGAT2 in diet-induced obesity. Taken together, our data suggest a predominant role of MGAT2 in dietary fat absorption.

Taken together, our data suggest a predominant role of MGAT2 in dietary fat absorption. In mammals, the small intestine plays a predominant role in the absorption of dietary lipids (mainly triacylglycerol). The absorption of triacylglycerols by the intestinal tract is a complex process that requires several steps, including the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols by pancreatic lipase in the intestinal lumen, the uptake of released 2-monoacylglycerol and fatty acids into enterocytes, and the reconstitution of triacylglycerol in the enterocytes by the monoacylglycerol pathway where 2-monoacylglycerol and fatty acids are utilized to sequentially re-synthesize diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol by acyl-CoA: monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (MGAT) 1The abbreviations used are: MGAT, acyl-CoA:monoacylglycerol acyltransferase; DGAT, acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; OLEFT, Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rate; PPARα, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α. and acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT), respectively. Another pathway involved in the triacylglycerol synthesis is the glycerol 3-phosphate pathway, a de novo pathway that is present in most tissues, including small intestine. The pathway begins with acylation of glycerol 3-phosphate with fatty acyl-CoA producing lysophosphatidic acid, followed sequentially by further acylation and dephosphorylation to yield diacylglycerol (1Lehner R. Kuksis A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1996; 35: 169-201Google Scholar). Both pathways share the final step converting diacylglycerol to triacylglycerol by DGAT. In the small intestinal mucosa the monoacylglycerol pathway contributes to ∼80% of triacylglycerol because of the large amount of 2-monoacylglycerol released from dietary lipids (2Tso P. Crissinger K. Stipanuk M.H. Biochemical and Physiological Aspects of Human Nutrition. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia2000: 125-141Google Scholar, 3Phan C.T. Tso P. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D299-D319Google Scholar). The newly formed triacylglycerol is then packaged with other lipids such as cholesterol ester, phospholipids, and protein to form chylomicrons, which are quickly transported to other tissues through the lymphatic system and blood stream (3Phan C.T. Tso P. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D299-D319Google Scholar, 4Mansbach 2nd, C.M. Nevin P. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 963-968Google Scholar, 5Westergaard H. Dietschy J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 58: 97-108Google Scholar). The enzymatic reaction catalyzed by MGAT is an essential step for fat absorption in the small intestine, because triacylglycerol biosynthesis is believed to take place mainly through the monoacylglycerol pathway. High levels of MGAT activity were also found in mammalian white adipose tissue where MGAT is believed to play a role in the storage of triacylglycerol in adipocytes (6Jamdar S.C. Cao W.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 419-425Google Scholar), where excess storage of triacylglycerol results in obesity. In addition, unlike DGAT, MGAT is not involved in the glycerol 3-phosphate pathway that is present in most tissues. These differential features suggest that MGAT may present a better target for intervening the dietary absorption as a means of treating obesity. Because of the importance of MGAT in fat absorption, considerable studies have been conducted to elucidate its molecular and enzymatic features (7Manganaro F. Kuksis A. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1985; 63: 341-347Google Scholar, 8Lehner R. Kuksis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13630-13636Google Scholar, 9Bhat B.G. Bardes E.S. Coleman R.A. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 663-669Google Scholar). Facilitated by the recent advances in genomics and bioinformatics, three mammalian MGAT enzymes, designated MGAT1, MGAT2, and MGAT3, have been identified recently (10Cao J. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13860-13866Google Scholar, 11Cheng D. Nelson T.C. Chen J. Walker S.G. Wardwell-Swanson J. Meegalla R. Taub R. Billheimer J.T. Ramaker M. Feder J.N. J. Biol.

Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Google Scholar). MGAT1 transcripts were detected mainly in the stomach and kidney and at lower levels in adipose tissue and liver, but were absent in the small intestine where the highest level of MGAT activity was detected (13Yen C.L. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Google Scholar). The subsequently identified MGAT2 and MGAT3 are abundantly expressed in small intestine and could account for the high MGAT activity in this tissue (10Cao J. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13860-13866Google Scholar, 11Cheng D. Nelson T.C. Chen J. Walker S.G. Wardwell-Swanson J. Meegalla R. Taub R. Billheimer J.T. Ramaker M. Feder J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13611-13614Google Scholar). Properties of mouse MGAT2 expressed in mammalian cell lines and bacterial system were further characterized with respect to substrate specificity, requirement for lipid cofactors, intrinsic DGAT activity, activators, and inhibitors (14Lockwood J.F. Cao J. Burn P. Shi Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E927-E937Google Scholar, 15Cao J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25657-25663Google Scholar). Although the biochemical properties of MGAT in small intestine were previously intensively investigated (7Manganaro F. Kuksis A. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1985; 63: 341-347Google Scholar, 16Johnston J.M. Paultauf F. Schiller C.M. Schultz L.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 218: 124-133Google Scholar, 17Paltauf F. Johnston J.M. Biochim.

Chem. 1993; 268: 8781-8786Google Scholar), the in vivo characterization of the intestinal MGAT per se has not been described because of the lack of identified genes, decoded peptide sequences, or antibodies. MGAT activity has been reported to be regulated by a number of environmental and physiological factors, including lactation, starvation, and diabetes (19Coleman R.A. Haynes E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8934-8938Google Scholar, 20Mostafa N. Bhat B.G. Coleman R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1169: 189-195Google Scholar, 21Mostafa N. Everett D.C. Chou S.C. Kong P.A. Florant G.L. Coleman R.A. J. Comp. Physiol. [B]. 1993; 163: 463-469Google Scholar, 22Luan Y. Hirashima T. Man Z.W. Wang M.W. Kawano K. Sumida T. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 2002; 57: 75-82Google Scholar). Specifically, diabetes was shown to increase MGAT activity in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLEFT) rats (22Luan Y. Hirashima T. Man Z.W. Wang M.W. Kawano K. Sumida T. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 2002; 57: 75-82Google Scholar). However, due to the lack of a cloned MGAT gene at the time of those studies, it remains unknown whether the observed changes in MGAT activities were due to alterations in both mRNA and protein levels. In the present studies, we examined the expression and localization patterns of the mouse MGAT2 in the intestinal tract and other tissues by using an affinity-purified peptide antibody specific to mMGAT2. The data indicated that both MGAT2 mRNA and protein were expressed along the entire length of the small intestine with the highest levels in jejunum and lowest levels in the distal region of ileum (ileo-cecal valve), which correlated well with the MGAT enzyme activity. Immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical analysis showed a MGAT2-specific staining surrounds the villus and crypts of the small intestine, and the enzyme was localized in the ER in both COS-7 cells and Caco-2 cells transiently transfected with MGAT2. We further investigated MGAT expression and enzyme activities in normal mice fed a high fat diet and in db/db mouse, a genetic model of diabetes caused by mutation of leptin receptor gene, and compared those with the wild-type mice. Materials—Phosphatidylcholine, sn-2-monooleoylglycerol, sn-1,2-dioleoylglycerol, rac-1,2-dioleoylglycerol, sn-1,3-dioleoylglycerol, 1,2,3-trioleoylglycerol, oleic acid, and oleoyl-CoA were purchased from Doosan Serdary Research Laboratories (Toronto, Canada). [14C]Oleoyl-CoA (50 mCi/mmol) was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO). All other chemicals and solvents used in this study were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibody against a peptide corresponding to position 293–311 of mouse MGAT2 (C-TPQPSREEVDRLHQRYIKE) was raised commercially (ProSci Inc., Poway, CA). A terminal cysteine was added to the peptide to aid in coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as a carrier protein. An affinity purification of immune serum containing anti-MGAT2 IgG was further undertaken using an immunoaffinity column prepared by cross-linking the above peptide to CNBr activated Sepharose 4B. Aliquots of the purified antibody were stored at -80 °C, or kept at 4 °C for short-term storage. Animals and Specimen Collection—Normal or db/db diabetic male C57BL/6 mice, 6–8 weeks, were purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN). All animals were maintained in an environmentally controlled facility with diurnal light cycle and free access to food and water for at least 1 week before use. Ten normal male C57BL/6 mice were divided into two groups (5 each): one group (Control) was fed standard chow food (PMI 5001, protein 28.4%, fat 12.3%, and carbohydrate 59.4%), and the other (High fat) was given high fat diet (TD95217, protein 18.7%, fat 40%, and carbohydrate 41.3%). The mice were fed the different diets for 4 weeks. Animals were sacrificed with CO2, then immediately perfused with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS via transcardiac puncture. The whole small intestine was rinsed with ice-cold PBS, divided into five equal segments (6–7 cm each), weighed, immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80 °C for later use for RNA isolation or total protein homogenate preparation. The most proximal segment, starting from the pylorus, was designated as the number 1, whereas the most distal segment close to the ileocecal valve was assigned number 5. Sections approximately represent the following parts of the small intestine: 1, duodenum and proximal jejunum; 2, jejunum; 3, distal jejunum and proximal ileum; 4 and 5, ileum. Cecum, colon, rectum, liver, kidney, and epididymal and inguinal adipose were also isolated for detection of MGAT2. All animals used in this study were in compliance with approved institutional animal care and use protocols according to National Institutes of Health guidelines (56National Institutes of Health, 1985, NIH publication No. 86-23, Washington, D. C.Google Scholar). Tissue Homogenate Preparation—Frozen mouse tissues were homogenized in 10 vol. of PBS (w/v) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) on ice with a motor-driven Dounce homogenizer (Heidolph, Germany). Aliquots of the crude homogenate were stored in liquid nitrogen or immediately processed for Western analysis or enzymatic assay. The protein concentrations in homogenates were determined by a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of MGAT2 in Mammalian Cells—A mammalian expression plasmid coding a full-length mouse MGAT2 was engineered as described previously (10Cao J. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13860-13866Google Scholar, 15Cao J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25657-25663Google Scholar). For subcellular colocalization study, human MGAT2 was tagged with a C-terminal FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK). COS-7 and Caco-2 cells were maintained under the conditions recommended by American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and transiently transfected with vectors with or without an MGAT2 cDNA as described previously (10Cao J. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13860-13866Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for immunocytohistochemical studies or harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pelleted by centrifugation, homogenized, and immediately proceeded to Western analysis and enzymatic assays, or frozen in liquid N2 for later use. In Vitro Assays for MGAT Activity—MGAT activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of [14C]oleoyl moiety into diacylglycerol with [14C]oleoyl-CoA and monooleoylglycerols as previously described (10Cao J. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13860-13866Google Scholar, 15Cao J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25657-25663Google Scholar). Unless indicated elsewhere, the reaction mixture consisted of 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (fatty acids-free), 200 mm sucrose, 25 μm [14C]Oleoyl-CoA, 200 μm of monooleoylglycerol in liposomes prepared using phosphatidylcholine, and 50 μg protein from small intestine crude homogenate. The reaction was conducted at room temperature for 10 min in a total volume of 100 μl. Lipids were extracted, separated, and quantitated essentially as described (10Cao J. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13860-13866Google Scholar, 15Cao J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25657-25663Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from frozen tissues by using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Twenty micrograms of total RNA was separated in a 1% agarose-formaldehyde 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid gel and transferred to a Nylon membrane blot. The membrane was hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, ICN Radiochemicals) labeled probes prepared from full-length cDNA of mouse MGAT2 using a Random Primers DNA Labeling System (Invitrogen). Hybridization was carried out in ULTRAhyb (Ambion, Austin, TX) at 50 °C overnight, followed by three washes at 55 °C in 2 × SSC buffer containing 0.1% SDS and 1 mm EDTA. Blots were stripped with boiling 1% SDS to remove radiolabeled probe and re-probed with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA as an internal control. The blots were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen to visualize the signals using a Molecular Dynamics STORM 860 scanner (Sunnyvale, CA), which were quantitated using ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics Inc.). Western Blot Analysis—For Western analysis, the freshly made crude homogenate from tissues or COS-7 cells was immediately denatured by boiling in SDS-loading buffer containing 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol. 20–25 μg of the denatured protein was resolved on 8–16% or 4–20% Novex Tris-glycerine gels by denaturing SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated for 2 h at room temperature in washing buffer (0.9% NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat milk to block nonspecific binding. The blots were then incubated with peptide-specific primary antibody (affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-mMGAT2 antibody, 0.5 μg/ml) dissolved in the same buffer at 4 °C overnight. After four washes (5 min each), the membrane was incubated with anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:4000, Amersham Biosciences UK Limited, Little Chalfont, Buchinghamshire, UK) for 1 h at room temperature. After another four 5-min washes, the blots were visualized using ECL+Plus (Amersham Biosciences UK Limited) for 5 min and exposed to Kodak BioMax MR film for 10 s to 5 min, or scanned using a Molecular Dynamics STORM 860 scanner for quantification using ImageQuaNT software. Immunohistochemistry—Sacrificed mice were immediately fixed by cardiac perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After fixation, the small intestine was removed, and segments corresponding approximately to duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were kept overnight at 4 °C in the above fixation buffer containing 30% sucrose. Tissue sections (10 μm) were prepared with a microtome (Leica CM3050 S, Dearfield, IL), incubated again with the above fixation buffer for 10 min, washed with PBS, air-dried, and stored at -20 °C until use. Prior to immunostaining, the sections were treated with 0.01 m sodium citrate (pH 6.0) with boiling for 10 min to facilitate the exposure of the antigen domain. The sections were also treated with 1% hydrogen peroxide diluted in methanol for 5 min to quench the endogenous peroxidase activity. The in situ immunodetection of mMGAT2 was performed using an ImmunoCruz staining system (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). After being rinsed with PBS twice for 5 min each, the sections were incubated with 1.5% goat serum in PBS for 2 h to block nonspecific sites. Sections were incubated with the primary antibody (affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-mMGAT2 IgG, 5 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. After being washed with PBS twice for 5 min each, the sections were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody for 1 h, washed three times with PBS as above, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin for another 30 min. After another three extensive washes with PBS, sections were stained with a horseradish peroxidase mixture containing 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and hydrogen peroxide for 30 s to 10 min until the desired stain intensity (brown) develops. The sections were then rinsed with water, dehydrated sequentially by using 95% ethanol, 100% ethanol, and xylenes, immediately mounted in a permanent mounting medium, and observed by light microscopy. A negative control staining was conducted essentially as described above except for substitution of primary antibody with normal rabbit IgG. To further distinguish the specific staining against MGAT2 from nonspecific staining, a peptide neutralization control was performed by incubating the affinity-purified rabbit anti-MGAT2 antibody with the blocking peptide used to raise the antibody (1:1, w/w) prior to proceeding to the staining. Immunocytohistochemistry—Cells were grown and transfected on a 6-well plate (Costar 3506). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were first incubated in the growth medium with 100 nm MitoTracker Red CMXRos for 30 min at 37 °C to achieve the specific staining on mitochondria. Then, cells were fixed with freshly prepared, prewarmed growth medium containing 4.0% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. After being rinsed with PBS twice for 5 min each, the samples were incubated with 5% normal donkey serum in PBS for 1 h to block nonspecific sites. Samples were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (5.0 μg/ml, Sigma) or rabbit anti-calnexin amino-terminal polyclonal antibody (1.0 μg/ml, StressGen Biotechnologies Corp., Victoria, Canada) for 2 h at room temperature. After being washed with PBS three times for 5 min each, the plates were incubated with Cy2-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA) for 1 h, washed four times with PBS, and analyzed in a fluorescence microscope using the appropriate filter combinations for excitation of the secondary antibodies. The cells were also counterstained with DAPI (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to visualize nuclei. Statistical Analysis—Data are given as mean ± S.E. The differences between two groups were analyzed by Student's t test. Expression of MGAT2 mRNA Along the Intestinal Tract in Mouse—The intestinal distribution of mouse MGAT2 mRNA was analyzed by Northern blot with GAPDH as internal control (Fig. 1). As shown in a representative Northern blot from one mouse (Fig. 1A) and the quantitative analysis derived from 3 mice (Fig. 1B), MGAT2 mRNA was expressed in all segments of the small intestine. The expression in section 1 (approximately equivalent to duodenum) was lower than that in sections 2 and 3 (equivalent to Jejunum), whereas the lowest level of expression was found in the distal region of ileum (Fig. 1). Thus, a clear proximal-to-distal gradient starting from proximal jejunum was detected in MGAT2 mRNA expression along the small intestine (Fig. 1). It appears that the expression of MGAT2 mRNA was restricted only to the small intestine within the intestinal tract, because the transcripts were barely detected in cecum, colon, and rectum (Fig. 1). Tissue Distribution Pattern of MGAT2 Protein in Mouse—To further characterize the expression and localization of MGAT2 in vivo, we selected several peptides present in mMGAT2 to raise specific rabbit antibodies against the enzyme. Immunization with one peptide (TPQPSREEVDRLHQRYIKE) that corresponds to the region of 293–311 of mMGAT2 protein generated a high titer mMGAT2-specific antibody. The peptide antibody was verified for mMGAT2 specificity by immunoblot analysis of recombinant mMGAT2 in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with MGAT2 cDNA. Cells transfected with empty vector served as a negative control. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE under denatured conditions and analyzed by Western blot. The antibody exclusively recognized a band migrating at apparent molecular mass of 38 kDa from mMGAT2-transfected cells, which was absent in vector-transfected cells and was not detected by pre-immune serum from the same rabbit (Fig. 2A). The 38-kDa peptide detected by the antibody also agreed well with the molecular mass of 38.6 kDa predicted from the open reading frame of the mouse MGAT2 gene, as well as the recombinant mMGAT2 protein previously produced in Escherichia coli (15Cao J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25657-25663Google Scholar), suggesting a lack of major post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation. These features validated the specificity of the antibody, which was further purified by an immunoaffinity column (see “Experimental Procedure”) and used throughout the studies. The expression of mMGAT2 along the small intestinal tract was examined by Western blot using the above affinity-purified specific peptide antibody against mMGAT2. As shown in Fig. 2B, a representative immunoblot, the antibody recognized a peptide band with a molecular size of 38 kDa, which is consistent with what was observed in MGAT2-transfected COS-7 cells and is believed to be the MGAT2 enzyme in the small intestine. A quantitative analysis of MGAT2 protein levels in different segments from three mice is shown in Fig. 2C. As was the case in the mRNA expression pattern, MGAT2 protein was expressed throughout the small intestine. A gradient from the proximal regions to the distal regions was clearly observed, with the highest levels in section 2 (jejunum). The expression levels of MGAT2 in the most distal region of the small intestine were at least 50% lower than proximal jejunum (Fig. 2C). Further study was undertaken to examine the protein expression of MGAT2 in other digestive tissues or in tissues where MGAT2 transcripts were detected (10Cao J. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13860-13866Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2D (upper panel), the protein expression of MGAT2 in liver, kidney, stomach, epididymal fat, inguinal fat, cecum, colon, and rectum was not detected under our experimental conditions in comparison with high expression of MGAT2 in small intestine and MGAT2-transfected COS-7 cells. As a control, β-actin was detected in all tissues tested (Fig. 2D, lower panel). This finding implied that MGAT2 protein levels in these tissues were dramatically lower than that detected in the small intestine, even though high levels of MGAT2 transcripts were observed in some of these tissues such as kidney and adipose (10Cao J. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13860-13866Google Scholar). Correlative Analysis of mRNA, Protein, and Enzyme Activity Levels of MGAT2 Along the Small Intestine—To establish a correlation between MGAT2 expression and MGAT activity along the small intestine, we next measured MGAT activity in homogenates from intestinal segments of wild-type mice. As shown in Fig. 3A, a representative image of TLC plate displaying the formation of products from a single mouse, and Fig. 3B, the quantitative TLC data collected from three different mice, the highest MGAT activity was observed in jejunum (segment 2). From jejunum to the distal ileum, the activity was progressively lower, which showed a clear proximal to distal gradient. Such a distribution of MGAT activity along the small intestine is consistent with the expression pattern of both MGAT2 mRNA and protein as demonstrated in Figs. 1 and 2. A combined analysis of the levels of mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity extrapolated a close correlation among the three indicators for MGAT2 along the small intestinal tract as shown in Fig. 3C, suggesting a pivotal role for MGAT2 in dietary fat absorption. In Situ Localization of MGAT2 by Immunohistochemistry— Immunohistochemical analyses were carried out to investigate the tissue distribution patterns of MGAT2 in the small intestine. Immunohistochemical studies were performed on slices prepared from different segments of wild-type mouse small intestine by using an immunoperoxidase staining system, which generates a brown-colored deposit upon specific immunoreactivity with mMGAT2. An intense brown staining was clearly detected in a layer surrounding the upper villi and vilus tips (Fig. 4, A and B, arrows) where the mature, absorptive enterocytes are located. A striking mMGAT2 staining was also found in the lower crypt regions (Fig. 4, A and B, arrowheads) where younger and secretory epithelial cells are believed to populate. The staining patterns were preserved in different segments of the small intestine. The staining in segments corresponding to jejunum (Fig. 4A) and proximal ileum (Fig. 4B) is shown. Intense brown staining was found inside the villi, rather than at an external site or on the surface, indicating MGAT2 resided inside of the enterocytes. As a negative control of the immunostaining process, normal rabbit IgG did not pose any noticeable staining (Fig. 4C). The specificity of the staining toward mMGAT2"
https://openalex.org/W2025685948,"Mitosis in human cells is initiated at the end of G2 by activation of the Cdc2/cyclin B complex. Activation occurs by dephosphorylation of the inhibitory residues, threonine 14 (T14) and tyrosine 15 (Y15), on Cdc2 by the Cdc25C phosphatase. Entry into mitosis is regulated by the subcellular relocalization of Cdc2/cyclin B, which is rapidly imported into the nucleus at the end of G2. Here, we show that polo-like kinase 3 (Plk3) is able to phosphorylate Cdc25C primarily on S191, and to a lesser extent on S198 in vitro, both of which are within a nuclear exclusion motif. Following transfection, the S191D Cdc25C mutant leads to an enhanced accumulation of Cdc25C in the nucleus, while the S191A mutant facilitated the Cdc25C nuclear exclusion. Furthermore, translocation of Cdc25C to the nucleus was accompanied by a decrease in Cdc2 phosphorylation on Y15. Plk3-WT overexpression led to a sharp increase in Cdc25C nuclear accumulation, while Plk3-KD overexpression failed to do so. The effect of Plk3 overexpression on Cdc25C was reversed by coexpression of a Plk3 siRNA. These results support a role for the polo kinases in coordinating the translocation and perhaps the timing of both Cdc25C and its target Cdc2/cyclin B to the nucleus upon entry into mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2062420674,"The reaction cycle of HECT domain ubiquitin ligases consists of three steps: 1) binding of an E2 protein, 2) transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to the HECT domain, and 3) transfer of ubiquitin to the substrate. We report the identification of a determinant that is specifically required for the last step of this cycle, a phenylalanine residue located four amino acids from the C terminus of most HECT domains, referred to here as the -4F. Alteration of this residue in human E6AP and Saccharomyces cerevisae Rsp5p did not affect ubiquitin-thioester formation, but effectively blocked substrate ubiquitination. Alteration of the -4F to alanine with concomitant substitution of a nearby residue to phenylalanine only partially restored Rsp5p activity, indicating that precise spatial placement of this residue is important. C-terminally extended E6AP and Rsp5p proteins were also defective for substrate ubiquitination, providing a likely biochemical understanding of a previously isolated Angelman syndrome-associated mutation of E6AP that alters the stop codon of an otherwise wild-type gene. We propose that the -4F may play a role in orienting ubiquitin when it is tethered to the HECT active site cysteine. This may be necessary to allow for approach of the incoming lysine ϵ-amino group of the substrate. The reaction cycle of HECT domain ubiquitin ligases consists of three steps: 1) binding of an E2 protein, 2) transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to the HECT domain, and 3) transfer of ubiquitin to the substrate.

We propose that the -4F may play a role in orienting ubiquitin when it is tethered to the HECT active site cysteine. This may be necessary to allow for approach of the incoming lysine ϵ-amino group of the substrate. The best characterized function of protein ubiquitination is as a recognition signal for the 26 S proteasome (1Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is covalently linked to substrate proteins via isopeptide bond linkages formed between the terminal carboxyl group of ubiquitin and ϵ-amino groups of lysine side chains of the substrate, or in some cases to the N-terminal α-amino group. Additional ubiquitin molecules can be conjugated sequentially at specific lysine residues of ubiquitin to form multi-ubiquitinated proteins, which are the principal substrate of the 26 S proteasome. Three groups of proteins cooperate in catalyzing ubiquitination: the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating proteins (Ubc 1The abbreviations used are: Ubc, ubiquitin-conjugating proteins; HPV, human papillomavirus; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; AS, Angelman syndrome. 1The abbreviations used are: Ubc, ubiquitin-conjugating proteins; HPV, human papillomavirus; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; AS, Angelman syndrome. proteins), and the E3 ubiquitin ligases (1Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Google Scholar). The E1 enzyme uses ATP to form a ubiquitin-adenylate intermediate at the terminal carboxyl group of ubiquitin. A ubiquitin-thioester is then formed at the active site cysteine of the E1 enzyme, with release of AMP. The E1 enzyme transfers ubiquitin to the active site cysteine of the highly conserved family of E2 proteins, maintaining a ubiquitin-thioester linkage. The E3 ubiquitin-ligases interact with both the E2 proteins as well as with substrate proteins. Whereas several classes of E3 enzymes are now recognized (SCF, APC, CBC, RING, CHIP, and HECT E3s), they fall into two groups with respect to overall mechanism. The first group, which includes all classes except for the HECT E3s, are thought to function essentially as docking proteins, orienting the E2 and substrate so that ϵ-amino groups of substrate lysines can attack the E2-ubiquitin thioester, forming a ubiquitin-isopeptide bond. HECT E3s participate more directly in catalysis and are defined by a conserved C-terminal domain of ∼350 amino acids (the HECT domain, Ref. 2Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Google Scholar). Like the E1 and E2 proteins, HECT E3s also have an active site cysteine that forms a ubiquitin-thioester intermediate, accepting ubiquitin from an activated E2 enzyme (3Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Google Scholar). Substrates are then ubiquitinated by transfer from the E3 to the substrate, rather than from the E2 to the substrate. The HECT domain can be re-charged with ubiquitin while the substrate remains bound, and therefore multiple ubiquitins can be ligated to the substrate. Human E6AP was the first HECT E3 to be identified and characterized (4Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 237-245Google Scholar, 5Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Google Scholar). The human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 protein of the cancer-associated HPV types (e.g. types HPV16 and 18) binds to and redirects the activity of E6AP toward a set of cellular proteins that are not normally targeted by E6AP (5Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Google Scholar). The most notable of these substrates is the p53 tumor suppressor, although several cellular proteins have been reported to be ubiquitinated by the E6/E6AP complex (reviewed in Ref. 6Munger K. Howley P.M. Virus Res. 2002; 89: 213-228Google Scholar.) Whereas few of the normal physiologic (E6-independent) functions or substrates of E6AP have been identified (7Kumar S. Talis A.L. Howley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18785-18792Google Scholar, 8Oda H. Kumar S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9557-9562Google Scholar, 9Kuhne C. Banks L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34302-34309Google Scholar), it is now clear that mutations in the gene or alteration in expression of human E6AP (gene designation UBE3A) is the cause of Angelman syndrome (AS), a severe neurological disorder (10Matsuura T. Sutcliffe J.S. Fang P. Galjaard R.J. Jiang Y.H. Benton C.S. Rommens J.M. Beaudet A.L. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 74-77Google Scholar, 11Kishino T. Lalande M. Wagstaff J. Nat. Genetics. 1997; 15: 70-73Google Scholar). In a remarkable case of tissue specific imprinting, only the maternal allele of E6AP/UBE3A is expressed in subregions of the brain, including the hippocampal and Purkinje neurons (12Vu T.H. Hoffman A.R. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 12-13Google Scholar, 13Albrecht U. Sutcliffe J.S. Cattanach B.M. Beechey C.V. Armstrong D. Eichele G. Beaudet A.L. Nat. Genetics. 1997; 17: 75-78Google Scholar). AS patients lack a functional maternal allele of E6AP, and therefore lack E6AP protein in these regions of the brain. The AS phenotype is therefore hypothesized to reflect the lack of E6AP-mediated ubiquitination of one or more proteins in the brain. The identification of these substrates and an understanding of the biochemistry of E6AP and HECT E3s, in general, are critical to understanding the molecular basis of this devastating disease. HECT E3s are found in all eukaryotic organisms, and the human genome encodes ∼50 HECT E3s (2Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Google Scholar). HECT E3 proteins range in size from 90 to over 500 kDa, with the ∼350 amino acid HECT domain being the only defining element. The HECT domain is always located at the C terminus, with the active site cysteine located 32-34 amino acids from the end of the protein. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome encodes five HECT E3s. The best characterized is Rsp5p, which contains three WW domains in the central portion of the protein. WW domains are protein-protein interaction motifs with affinity for polyproline containing ligands (14Macias M.J. Wiesner S. Sudol M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 30-37Google Scholar), and in some cases the WW domains mediate direct substrate binding (15Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Google Scholar, 16Huibregtse J.M. Yang J.C. Beaudenon S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3656-3661Google Scholar). In other cases, as in the targeting of Spt23p by Rsp5p, enzyme-substrate recognition may be mediated by additional factors because an obvious WW domain recognition element does not exist in Spt23p. Yet the WW domains are required for Spt23p targeting (17Hoppe T. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. Cell. 2000; 102: 577-586Google Scholar). The isolated 350 amino acid HECT domain of E6AP and Rsp5p can form a thioester-linked ubiquitin adduct when supplied with E1, an appropriate E2 protein, ATP, and ubiquitin, indicating that all information necessary to interact with the upstream components of the ubiquitin system resides within the HECT domain (18Wang G. Yang J. Huibregtse J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 342-352Google Scholar). At least three separable biochemical activities of the HECT domain can be defined: 1) binding to a specific E2, 2) transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 active site cysteine to the HECT active site cysteine (transthiolation), and 3) transfer of ubiquitin from the HECT active site to lysine side chains on the substrate (catalysis of isopeptide bond formation). The x-ray crystal structure of the E6AP HECT domain bound to UbcH7 directly demonstrated the basis of the E2-HECT domain interaction (19Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 286: 1321-1326Google Scholar). The overall structure of this HECT-E2 complex is “U” shaped, where the HECT domain represents the base and one arm of the U, and the E2 the second arm. A common conserved feature of the E2s that function with HECT E3s is a phenylalanine (Phe63 of UbcH7) on the tip of loop L1 of the E2. The Phe63 side chain of UbcH7 fits into a deep hydrophobic groove of the HECT domain. The E6AP HECT-UbcH7 x-ray crystal structure did not reveal an obvious mechanism for transfer of ubiquitin from either the E2 to the HECT domain, or from the HECT domain to the substrate. A striking feature of this complex was that the active site cysteines of the E2 and HECT domain were separated by ∼41 Å (19Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 286: 1321-1326Google Scholar). Clearly, a dramatic structural change would be required to bring the thiol groups into proximity during transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to E3. The most likely source of flexibility is the unstructured loop that connects the HECT domain N lobe (the base of the U) with the C lobe (one arm of the U) that contains the active site cysteine. Indeed, this is strongly supported by a more recent x-ray crystal structure of a second HECT domain, that of the WWP1 protein (20Verdecia M.A. Joazeiro C.A. Wells N.J. Ferrer J.L. Bowman M.E. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 249-259Google Scholar). In this structure, the N and C lobes of WWP1 are individually very similar to those of E6AP; however, the relative orientation of the N and C lobes is different from that seen in the E6AP structure. Modeling an E2 into the WWP1 structure based on the E6AP-UbcH7 structure, the active site cysteines would be substantially closer than in the E6AP structure (∼16 compared with 41 Å), but clearly additional conformational changes would still be necessary to bring them into proximity for the transthiolation reaction. The orientation of the N and C lobes seen in the WWP1 structure is more likely to be representative of the relative position of these lobes during transthiolation than the orientation seen in the E6AP structure. It is possible that the orientation of the N and C lobes seen in the E6AP structure may represent the structure at the last phase of the reaction, during the transfer of ubiquitin from the E3 to the substrate. Whereas understanding the basis of ubiquitin transfer from the E2 to the HECT domain remains unresolved, the final phase of the ubiquitination reaction, the transfer of ubiquitin from the HECT active site to the substrate protein, can nevertheless be studied independently. We reported previously that E6AP deleted of the C-terminal six amino acids was unable to catalyze substrate ubiquitination, even though the protein was competent for formation of the ubiquitin-thioester intermediate (2Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Google Scholar). These amino acids of E6AP are partially disordered in the E6AP structure and follow a 13-amino acid α-helix (19Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 286: 1321-1326Google Scholar). Perhaps related to the disordered nature of the C terminus, crystals of the WWP1 HECT domain could not be obtained until the last five amino acids were deleted (20Verdecia M.A. Joazeiro C.A. Wells N.J. Ferrer J.L. Bowman M.E. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 249-259Google Scholar). The last six amino acids of E6AP (residues 847-852; KGFGML) contain only two residues that are conserved among most HECT E3s, Gly848, and Phe849 (see Fig. 1A). For purposes of comparison between different HECT E3s we will often refer to these residues by their position relative to the C terminus (e.g. Phe849, the fourth from last amino acid of E6AP, will be -4F). Whereas the -4F residue is conserved among almost all HECT E3s, in some cases it is found at either the -2 or -5 position. The only exceptions to this are a small number of HECT E3s that have an extended and divergent C-terminal sequence (e.g. human Herc1, Herc2; see Fig. 1A). This subgroup of HECT E3s is not a subject of the current study, primarily because functional assays for these proteins have not been established. Four of five S. cerevisiae HECT E3s (Rsp5p, Ufd4p, Hul5p, and Tom1p) possess the conserved -4F, while Hul4p has a tyrosine at the -4 position that, as suggested by results presented below, is likely to functionally substitute. We show here that -4F is the only determinant within the last six amino acids that is specifically required for the final step in catalysis of substrate ubiquitination by both human E6AP and yeast Rsp5p, that its precise positioning is critical to function, and that C-terminal extensions to the HECT domain result in a similar biochemical defect as alterations of the -4F. We present a model for the possible function of the -4F in promoting substrate ubiquitination. Plasmids and Mutagenesis—The WBP2 open reading frame was amplified by PCR from a human cDNA clone (gift of M. Sudol, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York) using a 5′-primer that also encoded the FLAG epitope (MDTKDDDDK). The PCR product was cloned into vector pGEX-6p (Amersham Biosciences) for GST fusion protein expression in Escherichia coli and into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) for in vitro translation using rabbit reticulocyte or wheat germ extract translation kits from Promega (Madison, WI). In both cases the insert was cloned using BamHI to NotI restriction sites. Mutagenesis of the RSP5 and E6AP genes was performed by PCR (Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase, Invitrogen) using specific primers encoding the indicated codon alterations, deletions, or extensions. The RSP5 constructs were cloned in pGEX-6p for bacterial expression, and E6AP mutants were cloned into pVL1393-GST for creation of recombinant baculovirus expressing GSTE6AP fusion proteins. Recombinant baculoviruses were created with the BaculoGold system (BD Pharmingen). Protein Expression and Purification—GST-Rsp5p fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli by standard methods and affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Rsp5p proteins were cleaved from GST using PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) under the manufacturer's recommended conditions. GST-E6AP proteins were expressed in High5 insect cells (Invitrogen) using recombinant baculoviruses. Cell lysates were made 36-h post-infection in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT), affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose, and cleaved from GST with PreScission protease. GST-ubiquitin was purified from E. coli lysate on glutathione-Sepharose and eluted with PBS containing 25 mm reduced glutathione. Human E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme was expressed in insect cells infected with recombinant E1-expressing baculovirus. The protein was partially purified by DEAE batch chromatography, eluting with buffer containing 400 mm NaCl. Arabidopsis thaliana Ubc8 protein was prepared as described previously (5Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Google Scholar). HPV-33E6 protein was expressed as a GST fusion protein in the baculovirus/insect cells system, purified on glutathione-Sepharose, and cleaved from GST with PreScission protease. In vitro translation reactions were carried out in coupled transcription-translation reactions using either rabbit reticulocyte lysate or wheat germ systems (Promega) and 35S-labeled methionine. In Vitro Ubiquitin-Thioester and Ubiquitination Assays—For thioester assays, E6AP or Rsp5p proteins (1 μg) were incubated in 50-μl reactions containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 μm DTT, 4 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP. Reactions contained E1 and A. thaliana Ubc8 enzymes (250 ng each), with or without 2 μg of GST-ubiquitin. The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 10 min, then divided into two portions, and stopped with SDS-PAGE loading buffer, with or without 100 mm DTT. Samples were electrophoresed on 8% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted with either anti-RSP5 mouse antibody or anti-E6AP rabbit antibody. Secondary antibodies were HRP-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG and visualized with the SuperSignal chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce). Ubiquitination assays are carried out under the same conditions as the ubiquitin-thioester assays but for 30 min, and in presence of unmodified bovine ubiquitin (Sigma). 5 μl of in vitro translated WBP2 (rabbit reticulocyte lysate) or p53 (wheat germ extract) was used as source of substrates. 500 ng of purified bacterially expressed and purified FLAG-WBP2 was used for Rsp5p ubiquitination assays, where indicated. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography or immunoblotting using an anti-FLAG antibody (F3165 Sigma). In Vivo Complementation Assays—As described previously (18Wang G. Yang J. Huibregtse J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 342-352Google Scholar), the rsp5-1 strain, FW1808 (MATα, his4-912ΔR5, lys2-128Δ, ura3-52, rsp5-1), was used to assay for the ability of plasmid-expressed RSP5 variants to complement the growth arrest of this strain at 36 °C. All of the variants shown in Fig. 2 were subcloned into the pYES2 vector (Invitrogen) under control of the GAL1 promoter, and all contained an N-terminal hemagglutinin epitope. pYES2 plasmids were transformed into FW1808 or the closely related RSP5 strain FY56 (MATα, his4-912Δ, lys2-128Δ, ura3-52), with selection on uracil drop-out plates. Growth at 36 °C was scored on uracil drop-out plates with 2% galactose as the carbon source. Protein expression for all variants was assayed by preparing total cell extracts from cultures grown at 30 °C in 2% galactose containing uracil drop-out liquid medium, as described previously (18Wang G. Yang J. Huibregtse J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 342-352Google Scholar). Extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-HA and anti-Rsp5p antibodies. Conservation of the -4F and Its Position in the Predicted E6AP-UbcH7-ubiquitin Structure—Fig. 1A shows the C-terminal amino acid sequence of E6AP, beginning at Thr819, immediately preceding the active site cysteine (Cys820), and continuing to the end of the protein at Leu825 (numbering according to protein isoform 1 of E6AP, Ref. 21Yamamoto Y. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Genomics. 1997; 41: 263-266Google Scholar). This is aligned with several other human HECT E3s and all five of the S. cerevisiae HECT E3s. Excluding Herc1 and -2, the most C-terminal of the highly conserved residues is a phenylalanine located either two, four, or five amino acids from the end of the protein. There are a small number of HECT E3s that have a tyrosine at the -4 position (KIAA1320 and Hul4p in Fig. 1A). The amino acid preceding the phenylalanine is generally a glycine, but 20-30% of HECT E3s have various substitutions at this position (e.g. Ufd4p, Hul5p in Fig. 1A). Herc1 and Herc2 diverge from other family members over the last ten amino acids relative to E6AP, and continue with longer C-terminal extensions. Herc1 and Herc2 (the homolog of mouse runty-jerky-sterile; rjs) are closely related proteins, containing multiple RCC repeats, and to our knowledge, all HECT E3s that contain such divergent C-terminal sequences also contain RCC repeats. However, some RRC-HECT E3s have the more conventional C-terminal sequence containing the -4F (e.g. Herc3, cyclin E-binding protein, KIAA1593). The 2.7 Å structure of the human E6AP HECT domain (amino acids 493-852) in complex with the UbcH7 E2 enzyme was reported previously (19Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 286: 1321-1326Google Scholar). Ubiquitin was not present in this complex, so its position when bound to either the E2 or HECT E3 was unknown. A model of the S. cerevisiae Ubc1p E2 enzyme in complex with ubiquitin has been reported more recently (22Hamilton K.S. Ellison M.J. Barber K.R. Williams R.S. Huzil J.T. McKenna S. Ptak C. Glover M. Shaw G.S. Structure (Cambridge). 2001; 9: 897-904Google Scholar). The structures of UbcH7 and Ubc1p are very similar and both belong to the subgroup of E2 enzymes known to function with HECT E3s. By aligning the E2 structures from the HECT-E2 and E2-ubiquitin structures it is possible to predict the position of ubiquitin within the HECT-UbcH7 structure when bound to UbcH7 (22Hamilton K.S. Ellison M.J. Barber K.R. Williams R.S. Huzil J.T. McKenna S. Ptak C. Glover M. Shaw G.S. Structure (Cambridge). 2001; 9: 897-904Google Scholar). In this predicted ternary complex, ubiquitin lies to the side of the U-shaped structure formed by the HECT-E2 complex and does not cross the line-of-sight between the active site cysteines of the E2 and E3 (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1B also highlights the position of the -4F within the predicted HECT-E2-ubiquitin structure. Analysis of C-terminal Mutations in E6AP and Rsp5p—To explore the function of the HECT C terminus in ubiquitination, a set of mutations was created in the context of both full-length human E6AP and yeast Rsp5p (Fig. 2). The set of mutants included single amino acid alterations within the last five amino acids, small deletions from the C terminus, or extensions to the C terminus. E6AP and Rsp5p proteins were expressed as GST fusion proteins, either in a baculovirus insect cell system for E6AP, or in bacteria for Rsp5p. These expression systems were determined to be optimal for obtaining biochemically active protein for the respective wild-type proteins. After purification of the proteins on glutathione-Sepharose the E3 proteins were cleaved from GST by site-specific proteolysis. Fig. 3 shows a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel of purified E6AP and Rsp5p, both of the wild-type and the active site cysteine to alanine (C-A) mutated protein. All of the E6AP and Rsp5p proteins included in our analyses expressed similar amounts of protein relative to the wild-type control and no differences were observed in solubility of the altered proteins. Purified E6AP proteins were assayed in vitro for ubiquitin thioester formation. The negative control in these experiments was the C820A mutant, which disrupts the active site cysteine and therefore eliminates the ability to form the ubiquitin-thioester intermediate (3Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows ubiquitin-thioester formation for most of the E6AP mutants shown in Fig. 2, utilizing GST-ubiquitin as the source of ubiquitin to clearly distinguish the 100 kDa E6AP protein from the thioester-linked ubiquitinated intermediate. In control experiments not shown, we showed that the GST moiety did not affect efficiency of ubiquitin thioester formation. Assays were performed by incubating purified E6AP proteins with ATP, partially purified baculovirus-expressed human E1 protein, E2 protein expressed in bacteria (A. thaliana UBC8, Ref. 23Girod P.A. Carpenter T.B. van Nocker S. Sullivan M.L. Vierstra R.D. Plant J. 1993; 3: 545-552Google Scholar), and GST-ubiquitin purified from E. coli. The reactions were stopped with SDS-PAGE loading buffer without or with DTT, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-E6AP antibody. Approximately 20% of the input wild-type E6AP was incorporated into a thioester-linked complex with GST-ubiquitin under these assay conditions, with the adduct only being detected in the absence of reducing agent (DTT). No adduct was seen when GST-ubiquitin was omitted from the reaction, and as expected no E3-ubiquitin adduct was seen with the C820A active site mutant. All of the C-terminal variants of E6AP shown in Fig. 2 were still able to form the thioester intermediate to a similar degree as wild-type E6AP. These results were consistent with our earlier observation that E6AP deleted of the last six amino acids was still able to form the ubiquitin-thioester intermediate (2Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Google Scholar). The same proteins were assayed for their ability to ubiquitinate p53 in the presence of the cancer-associated HPV33 E6 protein (closely related to HPV16 E6). HPV33 E6 was expressed as a GST protein using recombinant baculovirus and was cleaved from the purified GST by site-specific proteolysis. 35S-labeled p53 was synthesized in vitro in a wheat germ extract system, which lacks endogenous E6AP. Purified E6 and E6AP proteins were added to the complete p53 translation reaction, along with supplemental E1 and E2 enzymes. As shown in Fig. 4B, no ubiquitinated p53 was seen when E6 was omitted from the reaction, whereas over 70% of the input p53 was ubiquitinated in the presence of both E6 and wild-type E6AP. GST-ubiquitin functioned similarly in this assay (not shown). The active site cysteine mutant (C820A) did not multi-ubiquitinate p53, as expected, although a small amount of mono- or di-ubiquitinated species were detected. This was seen with all mutants that were negative for p53 multi-ubiquitination and may be a result of a small amount of ubiquitination being catalyzed by the E2 in the context of the [E6AP-E6-p53]E2 complex. Deletion of one, two, or three amino acids from the C terminus of E6AP (851stop, 850stop, 849stop) did not block the ability of E6AP to multi-ubiquitinate p53, whereas deletion of six amino acids (not shown; see Ref. 2Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Google Scholar) effectively blocked ubiquitination. Alteration of the -4F to either tyrosine (F849Y) or alanine (F849A; not shown) blocked p53 ubiquitination as effectively as the active site cysteine mutant (C820A), whereas mutation of the -5G to alanine (G848A) had no affect on the ability to ubiquitinate p53. To determine whether the identity of the last one or two amino acids affected substrate ubiquitination, the terminal leucine residue was altered to either alanine or proline, or the last two amino acids (ML) were altered to QE. The latter alteration results in the last four amino acids of E6AP being identical to those of Rsp5p. These altered proteins ubiquitinated p53 as effectively as wild-type E6AP. Together, these results indicate that the -4F of E6AP is the single major determinant within the last six amino acids necessary for substrate ubiquitination by E6AP (see Fig. 2 for a tabulation of these results). Most Angelman syndrome mutations that result in single amino acid changes within the E6AP open reading frames are found within the region encoding the HECT domain, and all mutations tested so far disrupt to some degree the catalytic activity of E6AP in vitro (Ref. 19Huang L.

One Angelman syndrome mutation has been identified that affects the stop codon of E6AP, resulting in a terminally extended protein (24Fang P. Lev-Lehman E. Tsai T.F. Matsuura T. Benton C.S.

As a co-receptor for hepatitis C virus, and a requirement for hepatocytes for infectivity of human Plasmodium falciparum and rodent P. yoelii sporozoite infectivity, CD81 may also play a vital role in pathology. Despite the importance of CD81 in multiple cellular functions, the molecular mechanism of action of CD81 in these processes has remained elusive. Here we report an association between CD81 and the epsilon isoform of 14-3-3, a serine/threonine-binding intracellular signaling protein. Furthermore, we provide evidence that in human, this association is influenced by the palmitoylation state of the CD81 cytoplasmic tails. We have generated a series of CD81 cysteine mutants to identify palmitoylated intracellular motifs of CD81, and reveal palmitoylation on the N- and C-terminal tails as well as the intracellular loop between transmembrane domains 2 and 3. One of these mutants lacks all five of its intracellular cysteines and therefore cannot be palmitoylated. This unpalmitoylated version of CD81 shows constitutive association with 14-3-3. Interestingly, we find that under oxidative conditions, CD81 palmitoylation is inhibited and that condition correlates with the association of CD81 and 14-3-3. These finding suggest that CD81 signaling events could be mediated by 14-3-3 adapter proteins, and these signals may be dependent on cellular redox.

CD81 is a member of the tetraspanin family of integral membrane proteins. CD81 was first discovered in 1990 as the target of an antibody with reversible antiproliferative effects on a human B cell lymphoma line (1Wright M.D. Henkle K.J. Mitchell G.F. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3195-3200PubMed Google Scholar, 2Oren R. Takahashi S. Doss C. Levy R. Levy S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4007-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 3Hotta H. Ross A.H.

Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). There are currently 26 membrane proteins classified as members of the tetraspanin family. Members must meet the following criteria: four highly conserved hydrophobic transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops, short intracellular amino and carboxyl tails, and three motifs, CCG, PXSC, and EGC, that contain conserved cysteine residues in the major extracellular domain (5Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1103-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The smaller extracellular loop is between transmembrane 1 and 2, and the larger extracellular loop, which is likely to mediate interactions with other cell surface proteins, lies between transmembrane 3 and 4. Many of the initial discoveries of CD81 function were focused in the immune system. On the surface of B cells, CD81 is associated with the CD19·CD21·Leu13 protein complex (6Bradbury L.E. Kansas G.S. Levy S. Evans R.L. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2841-2850PubMed Google Scholar, 7Takahashi K. Nakamura T. Koyanagi M. Kato K. Hashimoto Y. Yagita H. Okumura K. J.

This complex is involved in regulation of B cell receptor signal transduction through recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The CD21·CD19·CD81 complex functions by bringing together required signaling molecules to lower the B cell threshold of activation (9Matsumoto A.K. Martin D.R. Carter R.H. Klickstein L.B. Ahearn J.M.

Today. 1994; 15: 437-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Similarly, on T cells, CD81 associates with the T cell co-receptors CD4 and CD8 and provides a costimulatory signal with the CD3 subunit of the T cell receptor (11Levy S. Todd S.C. Maecker H.T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 89-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). CD81 may play a role in early T cell development in the thymus (12Boismenu R. Rhein M. Fischer W.H. Havran W.L. Science. 1996; 271: 198-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The roles for CD81 in immune function were evidenced in 1997 when targeted deletion of CD81 in mice resulted in impaired B-cell proliferation after B-cell antigen-receptor (BCR) cross-linking and hyperproliferation of T cells (13Maecker H.T.

In addition, CD81–/– mice are also less sensitive to allergen-induced airway hyperreactivity, a mouse model of asthma (16Deng J. Yeung V.P. Tsitoura D. DeKruyff R.H. Umetsu D.T. Levy S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5054-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Another large area of CD81 investigation focuses on its role in pathology. CD81 is required on hepatocytes for human Plasmodium falciparum and rodent P. yoelii sporozoite infectivity (17Silvie O. Rubinstein E. Franetich J.F. Prenant M. Belnoue E. Renia L. Hannoun L. Eling W. Levy S. Boucheix C. Mazier D. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Antibodies to CD81 inhibit syncytium formation by human T cell leukemia virus-1 (18Imai T.

Of great interest, CD81 is a receptor for the E2 envelope protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV). 1The abbreviations used are: HCV, hepatitis C virus; pS, phosphoserine; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; IL, interleukin; LFA-1, lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1; VLA, very late antigen; l-BSO, l-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine; NAC, N-acetyl-l-cysteine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; PKC, protein kinase C. 1The abbreviations used are: HCV, hepatitis C virus; pS, phosphoserine; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; IL, interleukin; LFA-1, lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1; VLA, very late antigen; l-BSO, l-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine; NAC, N-acetyl-l-cysteine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; PKC, protein kinase C.

Antibodies that neutralize HCV infection in vivo were able to block HCV binding to CD81 in vitro (21Pileri P. Uematsu Y. Campagnoli S. Galli G. Falugi F. Petracca R. Weiner A.J. Houghton M. Rosa D. Grandi G. Abrignani S. Science. 1998; 282: 938-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). Binding of the viral protein to CD81 may provide the virus with the ability to regulate the immune system. On T cells, CD81 cross-linking is co-stimulatory and has activating effects, whereas on natural killer cells, E2 binding to CD81 is inhibitory to their activation and function (24Wack A. Soldaini E. Tseng C. Nuti S. Klimpel G. Abrignani S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 25Tseng C.T. Klimpel G.R. J. Exp.

These results suggest a mechanism whereby HCV binding to CD81 may alter host defenses and enable evasion of the immune response during HCV infection. Despite the role of CD81 in multiple important cellular functions, the molecular mechanism of action of CD81 in these processes has eluded us. One popular working hypothesis for CD81 function suggests that it is an adapter protein, with the extracellular domain interacting with cell surface proteins and the cytoplasmic tails recruiting intracellular signaling molecules. Potential interactions of the extracellular domain, specifically the large extracellular loop, of CD81 with cell surface molecules are many. CD81 co-immunoprecipitates with a wide variety of cell surface proteins, including members of the integrin family of cell adhesion molecules, growth factors, and a novel member of the Ig superfamily of protein called PGRL (27Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1189-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 28Lagaudriere-Gesbert C. Le Naour F. Lebel-Binay S. Billard M. Lemichez E. Boquet P. Boucheix C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 40545-40554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Which domains in CD81 directly interact with other cell surface proteins remain to be determined. It is known that HCV E2 binds in the helix D region of the large loop of CD81 (31Drummer H.E. Wilson K.A. Poumbourios P. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11143-11147Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 32VanCompernolle S.E. Wiznycia A.V. Rush J.R. Dhanasekaran M. Baures P.W. Todd S.C. Virology. 2003; 314: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Engagement of CD81 by antibody triggers a variety of functional responses. On thymocytes, anti-CD81 generates signals which influence adhesion and proliferation, whereas on mature T cells, CD81 engagement promotes lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1)-dependent T cell activation, IL-2 production, and proliferation (33VanCompernolle S.E. Levy S. Todd S.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of PKC but not protein tyrosine kinases prevent CD81-induced activation of LFA-1 on T cells. CD81 can also regulate very late antigen (VLA)-4 and VLA-5 adhesion strengthening in monocytes and primary murine B cells (34Feigelson S.W. Grabovsky V. Shamri R. Levy S. Alon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51203-51212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In B cells, antibodies to CD81 cause a rapid increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Interestingly, tyrosine kinase activity seems to be regulated by the intracellular redox state, but the mechanism of that effect has not been determined (35Schick M.R. Levy S. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4090-4097PubMed Google Scholar). Two previous reports (36Zhang X.A. Bontrager A.L. Hemler M.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2595-2598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) demonstrate association of CD81 with PKC and PI3K, but the nature of that interaction is still unknown. Because tetraspanins have limited intracellular presence, with tails of less than 12 amino acids, their direct role in signaling is frequently overlooked. Signaling through tetraspanin proteins is often attributed to interactions with other membrane proteins. Recent investigations suggest that tetraspanin tails have more functionality than initially thought. The first indication of a functional role for the cytoplasmic tails came in 1996 when Shaw and coworkers (38Seehafer J.G. Slupsky J.R. Tang S.C. Shaw A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 952: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 39Seehafer J.G. Tang S.C. Slupsky J.R. Shaw A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 957: 399-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) showed that CD9 undergoes posttranslational modification by acylation of the amino tail of CD9, though the nature of that acylation was unclear at that time. Attention was again drawn to the intracellular tails when discovery and comparison of six new members of the tetraspanin family revealed conservation of cysteines on the intracellular juxtamembrane portions of the cytoplasmic tails. It was noted that of the 16 tetraspanins known at that time, 15 possessed at least one cysteine in the amino tail, 13 had at least one cysteine in the short intracellular loop between transmembrane 2 and 3, and 14 had cysteines in the carboxyl tail (40Todd S.C. Doctor V.S. Levy S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1399: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The importance of these cysteines went uninvestigated until recently. While examining another member of the tetraspanin family, CD151, investigators discovered that these conserved cysteines were modified by palmitic acid. Palmitoylation is an acylation modification whereby palmitic acid residues are attached to juxtamembrane intracellular cysteines. Multiple members of the tetraspanin family including CD9, CD81, CD151, and CD63 were examined, and all were modified with palmitic acid (41Yang X. Claas C. Kraeft S.K. Chen L.B. Wang Z. Kreidberg J.A. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 767-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 42Berditchevski F. Gilbert E. Griffiths M.R. Fitter S. Ashman L. Jenner S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41165-41174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a CD151 mutant lacking all intracellular palmitoylation sites showed decreased association with interacting proteins, including CD81, and interfered with proper cellular adhesion and aggregate formation in 293-HEK cells (41Yang X. Claas C. Kraeft S.K. Chen L.B. Wang Z. Kreidberg J.A. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 767-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 43Berditchevski F. Odintsova E. Sawada S. Gilbert E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36991-37000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This evidence has relevance for the cytoplasmic tails in CD81 function. We have employed matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) and postsource-decay analysis to identify an intracellular protein that associates with CD81. Here we report an association between CD81 and the epsilon isoform of 14-3-3, a serine/threonine-binding intracellular signaling protein. We provide evidence that this association is influenced by the palmitoylation state of the CD81 cytoplasmic tails. Furthermore, we find that palmitoylation of CD81 can be regulated by the oxidation state of the cell. These data suggest that 14-3-3 may provide a direct link between CD81 and the range of signaling events resulting from CD81 engagement. The effect of oxidative stress on CD81 palmitoylation and 14-3-3 association may also provide a molecular basis to explain earlier findings that show CD81 signaling to be sensitive to cellular redox (44Schick M.R. Nguyen V.Q. Levy S. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1918-1925PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Lines—The human T cell line Jurkat was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). COS-7 and 3T3 were also maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker). The mouse T cell line MBL was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker). Splenocytes were isolated from B6 mice of various ages. Antibodies—Antibodies used include EAT1 (anti-CD81), 5A6 (anti-CD81), H-8 (anti-14-3-3β) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-14-3-3 (rabbit polyclonal IgG) (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Protein Purification—8 × 108 C6VL cells were lysed in 1% Brij-97. Lysate was run over a column of EAT1 (anti-CD81) antibody covalently crosslinked to protein-A agarose beads (Pierce Endogen, Rockford, IL). Bound protein was eluted in 100 mm glycine, pH 2.8, dialyzed, concentrated, and resolved on 8–16% Tris-glycine gradient gel (Invitrogen). Proteins were visualized with Coomassie Blue, and p30 was excised and subjected to trypsinolysis. MALDI-TOF MS followed by postsource-decay analysis was used to determine the identity of p30 (John Leszyk, University of Massachusetts Medical Center at Worchester, MA). Palmitoylation—Where indicated, 2 × 107 Jurkat cells were treated with 1 mm H2O2 at 37 °C for 5 min, unless another time is indicated. Diamide (Sigma) was also used at 1 mm for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were treated overnight with 1 μm l-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine (l-BSO) or 2 mm N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) (Sigma) at 37 °C. After treatment, cells were serum-starved for 2 h in the presence of treating agent. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 2 ml RPMI 1640 medium + 5% bovine serum albumin. Cells were radiolabeled using palmitic acid [9,10-3H(N)] (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 300 μCi/ml for 3 h at 37 °C. Labeled cells were then washed 3× in 5 ml of ice cold PBS, lysed in TBSE buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) with 1% TX-100 (Sigma) supplemented with 10 units/ml aprotinin (Cal-Biochem, San Diego, CA), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A for 1 h on ice and immunoprecipitated as indicated below. Biotinylation—Two days after transfection, COS-7 cells transiently transfected with indicated CD81 constructs were washed twice in cold PBS and resuspended in 5 ml of PBS supplemented with 2 mm Mg2+ and 2 mm Ca2+. EZ-Link™ sulfo-NHS-LC Biotin (Pierce Endogen) was added at 1 mg/ml PBS and incubated at room temperature 45 min. Cells were washed 4× in cold PBS and lysed as described for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation—Jurkat cells were treated as indicated above or left untreated. Mouse splenocytes were untreated. All cells were lysed at a concentration of 5 × 107 cells/ml in 1 ml of TBSE buffer with 1% Brij-99 (Sigma) supplemented with 10 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A for 1 h on ice. Confluent 100-mm dishes of transfected COS-7 cells were lysed in the same 1% Brij 99 solution as above also for 1 h at 4 °C. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 rpm prior to use. Lysate was precleared for 1 h at 4 °C against 50 μl of goat-anti-mouse (Sigma) or protein-A agarose beads. Anti-14-3-3β and 5A6 were captured on goat-anti-mouse agarose, and EAT1 and 14-3-3ϵ at 5 μg of antibody/20 μl of slurry. Antibody was pre-incubated with the indicated beads prior to the addition of 2 × 107 Jurkat or mouse splenocyte cell equivalents, or 500 μl of transfected COS-7 lysate. Samples were rotated overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated material was washed 4× in lysis buffer, separated on SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF. Western Blot—Biotinylated material was blotted with streptavidin-HRP (1:20,000) (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL). 5A6 was used at 1 μg/ml Tris-buffered saline with 1% Tween and 2% bovine serum albumin, anti-14-3-3β antibody was used at 1:100, and both were followed by goat-anti-mouse-HRP (1:20,000) (Southern Biotechnology). Anti-CD81 (EAT1) was used at 1:1000 followed by goat-anti-hamster-HRP (1:40,000) (Southern Biotechnology), and all were visualized using SuperSignal™ West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce Endogen). Autoradiography—[3H]Palmitic acid-labeled CD81 immunoprecipitations were also run on SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to PVDF as indicated above. Membranes were dried and exposed on Kodak BioMax MS film using a BioMax Transcreen low energy intensifying screen (Kodak, Rochester, NY) for 1 month at –80 °C. Cloning and Construction of CD81 and 14-3-3ϵ Constructs—Total RNA was isolated from Jurkat cell line using RNeasy™ mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and was reverse-transcribed using a reverse transcription system (Promega, Madison, WI). The full-length wild-type CD81 was amplified from this Jurkat cDNA using primers for CD81 (forward, 5′-ATGGGAGTGGAGGGCTGCAC, and reverse, 5′-AGTACACGGAGCTGTTCCGG). The N-terminal CD81 cysteine mutant (NT mut CD81) was made using mutational forward primer 5′-ATGGGAGTGGAGGGTGCCACCAAAGCCATCAAGTACCTG and reverse primer 5′-GTACACGGAGCTGTTCCGG that mutate the two cysteines at amino acids 6 and 9 to alanine. C-terminal CD81 cysteine mutant (CT mut CD81) was generated with wild-type forward primer and mutational reverse primer 5′-GTACACGGAGCTGTTACGGATGCCAGCAGCCAGCACCATGCT that mutate the cysteines at positions 227 and 228 to alanine. The double CD81 cysteine mutant (double mut CD81) was PCR-amplified from Jurkat cDNA using the forward and reverse mutational primers from above, which convert the cysteines in both the N- and C-terminal tails to alanines. Purified PCR products from each of these reactions were cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5His TOPO™ TA (Invitrogen). The triple CD81 cysteine mutant (triple mut CD81) lacking all intracellular cysteines was generated with QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX), according to the manufacturer's specifications. The CD81 double cysteine mutant in pcDNA3.1/V5His TOPO™ TA was used as a template, with overlapping mutant primer 5′-CATCCAGGAATCCCAGTCCCTGCTGGGGACGTTC and reverse primer 5′-GAACGTCCCCAGCAGGGACTGGGATTCCTGGATG. This final mutagenesis converts the cysteine at position 89 in the intracellular loop between transmembranes 2 and 3 to alanine. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Although the pcDNA3.1/V5His TOPO™ TA vector does provide for an epitope tag, the V5-His tag is not transcribed because of the endogenous CD81 stop codon. Transfection—24 hours prior to transfection, COS-7 cells were trypsinized and plated at 70–80% confluency in a 100-mm tissue culture dish. LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) was used for transfections according to the manufacturer's protocol. COS-7 was transfected with 20 μg of the indicated CD81 mutant plasmid. Cells were cultured 48 h at 37 °C prior to lysis in 1 ml of 1% Brij-99 lysis solution. Immunoprecipitation, radiolabeling, and Western blotting were carried out as stated above. CD81 Association with 14-3-3ϵ—The next step in understanding the mechanism of CD81 function is elucidating the signal transduction pathway utilized by CD81. In our previous investigation, we identified surface proteins associated with CD81 through biotinylation patterns of CD81 immunoprecipitations. This method does not allow for the identification of intracellular CD81-associated proteins. We began looking for CD81-associated intracellular proteins by analyzing proteins visualized by Coomassie Blue but which are not labeled by biotinylation of the cell surface. CD81-associated proteins were isolated from 1% Brij-97 lysate of the mouse T cell line MBL. The lysate was run over a column of anti-CD81 antibody (EAT1) antibody and were eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.8. The eluate was dialyzed, concentrated, and resolved on 8–16% Tris-glycine gradient gel. The associated proteins were visualized with Coomassie Blue, and proteins that were unique to the Coomassie-stained gel, yet not seen by Western blotting with avidin-HRP, were targeted for identification (Fig. 1A). To preserve the majority of tetraspanin interactions, it was necessary to use a less stringent detergent, such as Brij-97. Because of the highly interactive nature of tetraspanin proteins, these complexes often contain multiple proteins. These protein complexes do have a discrete size and have been shown to have functional relevance. From the Coomassie-stained gel of the anti-CD81 immunoprecipitation shown in Fig. 1A, we selected the most prominent protein at ∼30 kDa for identification. p30 was excised and subjected to trypsinolysis. MALDI-TOF MS followed by postsource-decay analysis was used to determine the identity of p30. The six peptide sequences derived from fragments of p30, KDSTLIMQLLR, RYLAEFATGNDRK, KVAGMDVELTVEERN, MDDREDLVYQKL, KAASDIAMTELPPTHPIRL, and KLAEQAERYDEMVESMKK, are shown in table format in Fig. 1B. Each of these peptide sequences is a 100% match for 14-3-3ϵ, and together these peptides cover 34.5% (88/255 amino acids) of the whole 14-3-3ϵ protein. These peptide fragments have been highlighted within the complete protein sequence of 14-3-3ϵ shown in Fig. 1C. The consensus binding sequence of 14-3-3 is a phosphoserine (pS) flanked by an arginine, e.g. RSXpSXP and RX(Y/F)XpSXP or RXSX(S/T)XP. CD81 has a sequence of RNSSVY in its amino-terminal tail, which bears a striking similarity to the 14-3-3 consensus sequence. The terminal proline in known 14-3-3 binding sites aligns with the carboxyl terminus of CD81, and if the role of the proline is to bend subsequent polypeptide away from the docking site, then this may not be necessary at the terminus of CD81. To confirm the physiologic association of 14-3-3ϵ with CD81, we conducted co-immunoprecipitation experiments in primary mouse splenocytes. As seen in Fig. 1D, CD81 does indeed coprecipitate with 14-3-3 from Brij-99 lysate of primary mouse splenocytes. Regulation of CD81 Palmitoylation—We also examined the association of CD81 with 14-3-3ϵ in human cell lines. For these experiments, we used an antibody to 14-3-3 that recognizes a structural region common to all seven isoforms. Our initial attempts to co-immunoprecipitate these two proteins from human cell lines were unsuccessful. We theorized that the association of CD81 with 14-3-3 might be constitutive in mouse but inducible in human cell lines. As we considered events that might regulate the interaction of 14-3-3 with the tail of CD81, two papers were published showing that multiple members of the tetraspanin family, including CD9, CD81, CD151 and CD63, are posttranslationally modified with palmitic acid on the juxtamembrane cysteines of their intracellular tails (41Yang X.

The tails of CD81 are short, with only 11 amino acids in the N-terminal tail and 12 amino acids in the C-terminal tails. CD81 has two cysteines on its N-terminal tail, two in its C-terminal tail, and one on the intracellular loop between its two large extracellular loops. These cysteines provide a potential for the covalent linking of up to five palmitic acids. We hypothesize that the presence of lipid moieties on these relatively short intracellular tails may block access of 14-3-3 to its potential binding site within those same tails. If a cellular mechanism for regulation of the presence of these palmitic acid residues exists, it would in turn provide a method of controlling 14-3-3 access to the potential binding domain on the intracellular tail of CD81. With this idea in mind, we began to search for cellular treatments that might manipulate the palmitoylation state of CD81. A study examining the effects of cellular redox on endothelial cells demonstrates that exposure of endothelial cells to oxidative"

Recent studies have shed new light on the possible biological function of Rh proteins as members of a conserved family of proteins involved in ammonium transport. The erythrocyte Rh-associated glycoprotein (RhAG) mediates uptake of ammonium when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, and functional studies indicate that RhAG might function as an NH4+-H+-exchanger. To further delineate the functional properties of RhAG, in this study we have expressed RhAG in both a Saccharomyces cerevisiae ammonium-transport mutant (mep1Δ mep2Δ mep3Δ) and a wild-type strain. RhAG was able to complement the transport mutant, with complementation strictly pH-dependent, requiring pH 6.2–6.5. RhAG also conferred resistance to methylamine (MA), a toxic analog of ammonium, and expression in wild-type cells revealed that resistance was correlated with efflux of MA. RhAG-mediated resistance was pH-dependent, being optimal at acid pH. The opposite pH dependence of ammonium complementation (uptake) and MA resistance (efflux) is consistent with bidirectional movement of substrate counter to the direction of the proton gradient. This report clarifies and expands previous observations of RhAG-mediated transport in yeast and supports the hypothesis that ammonium transport is coupled to the H+ gradient and that RhAG functions as a NH4+/H+ exchanger.

The erythrocyte Rh proteins are well known in clinical medicine as the cause of hemolytic disease of the newborn and blood transfusion incompatibilities (1Race R.R. Sanger R. Blood Groups in Man.6 ed. Blackwell, Oxford, England1975Google Scholar), but knowledge of their biochemical structure and possible function has only recently become available. In human erythrocytes, RhCE and RhD, which are responsible for the Rh blood group antigens, associate in the membrane with a related protein termed Rh-associated glycoprotein (RhAG) 1The abbreviations used are: RhAG, Rh-associated glycoprotein; MA, methylamine; WT, wild type; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: RhAG, Rh-associated glycoprotein; MA, methylamine; WT, wild type; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. (2Eyers S.A.C. Ridgwell K. Mawby W.J. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6417-6423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RhAG shares 37% identity with RhCE and RhD and is critical for their trafficking to the plasma membrane. In addition to the erythrocyte proteins (RhAG, RhCE, and RhD), nonerythroid homologs, designated RhCG and RhBG, are present in the kidney, liver, brain, skin, and testis (3Liu Z. Peng J. Mo R.

All have a predicted 12-transmembrane structure with intracellular N and C termini, and they lack consensus ATP binding sites. Rh homologs are also present in invertebrates from the sponge to the fly and in vertebrates from frogs to primates, suggesting that Rh blood group proteins are members of an ancient family of proteins with an important conserved function. Protein sequences with similarities to Rh and RhAG were first found in Caenorhabditis elegans; these homologs, in turn, showed a distant similarity with ammonium transporters from bacteria (SNYN, AMT), yeast (MEP), and plants (AMT). In these organisms, transport of ammonia (NH3)/ammonium (NH4+) is critical for acquisition of nitrogen. Whereas uptake in these organisms is thought to occur primarily by diffusion of NH3 into the cells when the concentration of NH4+ in the medium is optimal, expression of the specific transporter proteins is induced when NH4+ is limiting. Neither the mechanism(s) of transport nor the substrate(s) transported (protonated NH4+ or unprotonated NH3) by these ammonium transport proteins have been definitively determined, although it is an active area of investigation and debate (8von Wiren N. Gazzarrini S. Gojon A. Frommer W.B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 9Soupene E. Ramirez R.M. Kustu S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5733-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We reported recently that erythroid RhAG expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes mediates uptake of ammonium, providing direct evidence for a transport function (10Westhoff C.M. Ferreri-Jacobia M. Mak D.-O.D. Foskett J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12499-12502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Characterization in oocytes revealed that uptake was independent of the membrane potential and the Na+ gradient but that raising extracellular pH or lowering intracellular pH dramatically stimulated uptake. These results suggested that uptake was coupled to an outwardly directed H+ gradient and led us to hypothesize that RhAG might function by an H+-coupled, counter-transport mechanism. Here we have attempted to gain further insights into the function of RhAG by heterologous expression in either mutant yeast that were deficient in ammonium uptake from the medium or in wild-type (WT) yeast. Expression of RhAG complemented the ammonium transport mutant in a strictly pH-dependent manner (pH 6.2–6.5). Furthermore, RhAG expression also conferred resistance to methylamine (MA), an ammonium analog that is toxic when present at high concentrations in yeast medium, with RhAG-mediated efflux of MA correlating with resistance. RhAG conferred both uptake and efflux of ammonium in yeast, depending on the pH of the medium. Complementation (uptake) occurred at pH ≥6.1, whereas resistance (efflux) was favored at the acid pH values common in yeast cultures. The opposing pH dependences of uptake and efflux suggest that transport is coupled to the H+ gradient and is consistent with the hypothesis that RhAG functions by NH+/H4+ exchange. This report clarifies and expands previous observations and provides a hypothesis for the mechanism of RhAG-mediated transport. Yeast Strains and Media—S. cerevisiae strains MLY131, deficient in the MEP genes (mep1Δ mep2Δ mep3Δ or mep 1–3Δ), and the MLY61 wild-type (WT) parental strain, were a kind gift from Joseph Heitman (Duke University, Durham, NC) (11Lorenz M.C. Heitman J. Genetics. 1998; 150: 1443-1457PubMed Google Scholar). Standard yeast media without amino acids and ammonium sulfate (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) with limiting nitrogen at concentrations of 1–10 mm (NH4)2SO4 and alternative nitrogen media (0.1% proline) were prepared with 2% glucose or 2% galactose as carbon sources and 2% Noble agar. Where indicated, media were buffered with 20 mm Tris-HCl or MES, and pH was adjusted with NaOH or acetic acid. The MEP genes are repressed when cultured with a good nitrogen source (glutamine or ammonium) and induced on a poor nitrogen source such as proline. Induction medium consisted of 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without ammonium sulfate or amino acids supplemented with 0.1% proline and 2% galactose. Galactose was required for induction of RhAG expression. Plasmids—Control plasmids containing MEP1 (pML100), MEP2 (pML151), and MEP3 (pML113) were also from J. Heitman (11Lorenz M.C. Heitman J. Genetics. 1998; 150: 1443-1457PubMed Google Scholar). These plasmids contain ∼500 bp of 5′-endogenous promoter DNA and carry the URA3 selectable marker. Full-length RhAG cDNA was cloned downstream of the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter in pYES2-URA3 and was verified by sequencing. A MEP1/RHAG co-expression vector was created by insertion of MEP1 as a ClaI/SpeI fragment into the vector pYES2-RhAG at the ClaI/NheI site located outside the polylinker. Cloning and propagation of plasmids followed standard procedures in Escherichia coli XL-Blue. Yeast strains were transformed with the pYES2-RhAG construct, the individual MEP control plasmids, or the empty vector using lithium acetate, and transformants were plated on minimal medium lacking uracil. [14C]MA Uptake and Efflux—Radiolabeled [14C]MA (CH3NH3+) (ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) uptake was performed with RhAG-expressing cells and control cells transformed with the empty pYES2 vector or MEP1-, MEP2-, or MEP3-encoding vectors. Cells were grown overnight in ura-DO/0.67% yeast nitrogen base/2% glucose. Mid-log phase cells were washed with ice-cold water, diluted to A600 0.8–1.0, and induced for either 5 h or overnight at 30 °C in minimal medium, pH 6.1–6.5, containing proline as the sole nitrogen source and 2% galactose. The time course of [14C]MA (specific activity, 5 × 105 cpm/μmol) uptake was determined with a final concentration of 0.5 mm MA, as described previously (12Roon R.J. Even H.L. Dunlop P. Larimore F.L. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 122: 502-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 μl of 5 mm methylammonium containing 0.5 μCi of [14C]MA was added to 4.5 ml of the culture. Uptake was determined by removing samples (500 μl) at timed intervals to 25-mm diameter membrane filters (0.45 μm; Millipore) on a suction apparatus. Cells on the filter were washed by suction with 10 ml of cold water, and the filters were then placed in vials containing 5 ml of scintillation counting fluid, and counted. The time course of [14C]MA efflux was determined by addition of 10 mm cold MA to cells loaded 4–5 h or overnight with [14C]MA, followed by removal of cell aliquots to filters, washing, and counting of residual cellular [14C]MA, as above. All uptake and efflux measurements were standardized to a concentration of 1 OD (∼5 × 107 cells/ml) and were expressed as nanomoles per optical density of cells. Western Analysis—Yeast cultures were induced overnight and harvested in 5 OD aliquots. Membrane extracts were prepared by glass bead agitation in 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.2 mm), pepstatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, and chymostatin (2 μg/ml each) at 4 °C. The cells were lysed by vortex mixing for 3 min, diluted 2–3-fold with lysis buffer, and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 3 min. The supernatant was removed and centrifuged for 45 min at 13,000 rpm to obtain a pellet. The pellet was resuspended in sample loading buffer containing 8 m urea, heated at 37 °C for 15 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. RhAG protein expression was detected with monoclonal antibody 2D10 (13Mallinson G. Anstee D.J. Avent N.D. Ridgwell K. Tanner M.J. Daniels G.L. Tippett P. von dem Borne A.E. Transfusion. 1990; 30: 222-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), or with anti-HA when expressing a RhAG-HA tagged construct, and visualized with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG followed by ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Data Analysis—Experimental data were analyzed with IGOR software (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Uptake rates were determined from slopes of linear fits measured over 30 min. Efflux rates were determined by calculation of Aexp (-t/c). Statistical significance was evaluated by two-tailed paired t test. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant. Arithmetic means are given as mean ± S.E. Three genes, MEP1, MEP2, and MEP3, mediate ammonium transport in S. cerevisiae. They are all subject to nitrogen catabolite repression and encode proteins that differ in their affinities for ammonium. Any one is sufficient for cell growth on low concentrations of ammonium, but deletion of all three, mep1–3Δ (mep1Δ mep2Δ mep3), renders cells non-viable on medium containing 1–5 mm ammonium sulfate as the sole nitrogen source (14Marini A.M. Soussi-Boudekou S. Vissers S. Andre B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4282-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if RhAG were to function as an ammonium transporter, its expression in yeast might complement the transport defect in the mep1–3Δ cells. To determine whether RhAG can functionally substitute for the Mep proteins, we expressed RhAG in the mep1–3Δ ammonium transport mutant. Furthermore, we expressed RhAG in WT yeast to evaluate its effects on endogenous ammonium transport and accumulation. Western Blot Analysis of RhAG Expression in S. cerevisiae— Membrane-enriched fractions of cell extracts from WT and the mep1–3Δ transport mutant transformed with the pYES-RHAG construct were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and probed with a RhAG antibody to confirm that erythroid RhAG protein could be expressed in yeast (Fig 1A). Expression was confirmed in the WT cells, but RhAG expression in the mep1–3Δ mutant was not observed when probed with this 2D10 antibody. Because this antibody probably recognizes a carbohydrate epitope on the extracellular side of RhAG (13Mallinson G. Anstee D.J. Avent N.D. Ridgwell K. Tanner M.J. Daniels G.L. Tippett P. von dem Borne A.E. Transfusion. 1990; 30: 222-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we suspected that processing was different in the mep1–3Δ cells. When we expressed an HA-epitope-tagged RhAG construct in the mutant mep1–3Δ cells, RhAG-HA expression could be detected with a HA antibody and migrated at a lower molecular weight (∼40 kDa; data not shown) than RhAG expressed in the WT strain. This result is consistent with the observed size of RhAG expressed in a yeast ammonium transport mutant by Marini et al. (18Marini A.M. Matassi G. Raynal V. Andre B. Cartron J.P. Cherif-Zahar B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and it suggests that RhAG transits through the ER differently when expressed in the mep1–3Δ mutant compare with WT. RhAG Complements the mep1–3Δ Ammonium Transport Mutant at pH 6.1–6.5—To determine whether RhAG expression can complement the transport defect in the mep1–3Δ cells, the mutant cells were transformed with RhAG and plated on nitrogen-free medium supplemented with 1–5 mm ammonium sulfate. In addition, either 2% galactose was added to induce RhAG expression or 2% glucose was added as the uninduced control. Additional controls included the mutant cells transformed with either the empty vector or with the endogenous ammonium transport genes MEP1, MEP2, or MEP3. The plates were then incubated at 30 °C and observed for 2 weeks. Expression of RhAG failed to restore growth of the mutant cells under these conditions. These initial experiments were performed using yeast medium that is acidic with approximate pH 4.9. Yeast can grow well at this pH because they are capable of extruding acid even in medium with pH 3.0 (16Serrano R. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1991Google Scholar). Because the optimal pH in some transport studies in yeast was reported to be ∼5.5 (16Serrano R. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1991Google Scholar), we repeated the complementation experiments using buffered media with pH ranging from 4.2 to 7.2 (Fig 1B). At pH 7.2, the growth disadvantage of the mep1–3Δ mutant on low ammonium disappears, as observed previously (9Soupene E. Ramirez R.M. Kustu S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5733-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and growth of all cells was equivalent. After extended incubation (∼5 days at 30 °C), growth of the RhAG-transformed mutant cells plated on galactose at pH 6.2 was enhanced compared with uninduced cells plated on glucose. Although the complementation was relatively weak compared with that seen with the native yeast MEP genes, the enhanced growth was consistently observed in repeated experiments using media adjusted from pH 6.2 to 6.5. In contrast, no complementation was observed at more acidic pH values. Methylamine (MA+,CH3NH3+), the methyl analog of ammonium, has been used previously in studies of ammonium transport in S. cerevisiae (17Kleiner D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 639: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that MA+ and NH4+ have similar affinities for the RhAG transport pathway when expressed in oocytes (10Westhoff C.M. Ferreri-Jacobia M. Mak D.-O.D. Foskett J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12499-12502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar); therefore, we measured the time course of radiolabeled [14C]MA uptake in RhAG-transfected and control mutant yeast cells (Fig 2A). The control mutant mep1–3Δ cells transformed with either MEP1 or MEP2 demonstrated significantly enhanced [14C]MA uptake, with MEP3 accumulating less, consistent with previous reported affinities (14Marini A.M. Soussi-Boudekou S. Vissers S. Andre B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4282-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). However, there was no measurable enhancement of accumulation of the radioactive substrate in RhAG-transformed cells relative to those with empty vector (Fig. 2A), consistent with results from a previous report (18Marini A.M. Matassi G. Raynal V. Andre B. Cartron J.P. Cherif-Zahar B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The inability to observe enhanced initial uptake rates or accumulation of tracer MA in the mep1–3Δ/RhAG cells measured over minutes to an hour was not inconsistent with the observation that an extend incubation time (∼5 days) on solid medium was required to observe the weak growth complementation. These results suggested that RhAG does transport MA as efficiently as native Mep proteins. It is noteworthy that the yeast Mep proteins function not only in ammonium uptake but also are important for substrate retention (11Lorenz M.C. Heitman J. Genetics. 1998; 150: 1443-1457PubMed Google Scholar, 14Marini A.M. Soussi-Boudekou S. Vissers S. Andre B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4282-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). We therefore considered an alternative approach to investigate the mechanism of RhAG-mediated transport in yeast by expressing RhAG in WT cells to evaluate its effects on endogenous ammonium transport and accumulation. RhAG Confers Resistance to Toxic Concentrations of MA— MA is transported by the Mep proteins in yeast, but because it is not metabolized, it can accumulate 1000-fold and become toxic (14Marini A.M. Soussi-Boudekou S. Vissers S. Andre B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4282-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). WT cells are sensitive when medium MA concentration is in the range from 10 to 200 mm, whereas the mutant mep1–3Δ cells are resistant to these concentrations (9Soupene E. Ramirez R.M. Kustu S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5733-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14Marini A.M. Soussi-Boudekou S. Vissers S. Andre B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4282-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). To determine whether RhAG expression could influence either of these phenotypes, WT and mep1–3Δ cells expressing RhAG were plated on media supplemented with 50 mm MA. Expression of RhAG had no effect on mep1–3Δ cell resistance to 50 mm MA, whereas it conferred a dramatic resistance to MA in the WT cells (Fig. 3A). To confirm that RhAG expression specifically affects mep-mediated MA transport rather than stimulating some other compensatory cellular process, MEP1 was cloned downstream from RHAG, and the bi-cistronic vector was transformed into the mutant mep1–3Δ null background. Expression of Mep1 results in significant [14C]MA uptake; importantly, however, co-expression of RhAG (MEP1/RHAG) significantly decreased accumulation of [14C]MA compared with expression of Mep 1 alone (Fig. 2B). Similarly, co-expression of RhAG with either Mep 2 or Mep 3 in the mep1–3Δ null background dramatically decreased mep-mediated MA accumulation (not shown). These data suggest that RhAG was specifically antagonizing the Mep-mediated transport process by inhibiting MA uptake or by stimulating MA efflux. To determine the mechanism by which expression of RhAG confers resistance to toxic concentrations of MA in WT cells, we measured and compared [14C]MA uptake and accumulation in WT/empty vector and WT/RhAG cells (Fig. 3B). The rate of accumulation, as well as the total MA accumulated, was significantly less in the WT/RhAG-expressing cells. Resistance to toxic compounds can result from sequestration of the compound into the vacuole (16Serrano R. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1991Google Scholar). If expression of RhAG conferred resistance to MA toxicity by stimulating MA accumulation into the vacuole, the total accumulation of [14C]MA in the RhAG-expressing cells would be expected to be either similar to or greater than that observed in WT cells, but this was not observed. RhAG expression in WT cells resulted in more than a 50% reduction (∼64% at 1 h) in MA accumulation. To clarify that RhAG expression was not inhibiting MA uptake, we measured initial uptake in WT and WT/RhAG cells (Fig. 3B, inset). Measurable accumulation in the first 60 s was equivalent, suggesting that inhibition of the endogenous Mep proteins was not the mechanism of rescue. To test the hypothesis that RhAG-mediated resistance involved efflux of MA, WT/empty vector and WT/RhAG cells were loaded with [14C]MA, and the efflux rate was determined by measuring the amount of [14C]MA in the cells after the addition of 10 mm unlabeled MA. Cell aliquots were removed to filters at timed intervals, washed, and the remaining cellular radioactivity was counted. The rate of MA efflux from WT/RhAG cells was ∼60% greater (p < 0.001) than that measured for WT/empty vector cells (Fig. 4A). This result suggests that RhAG confers resistance to MA toxicity in WT cells by stimulating MA efflux. Evidence that RhAG mediates efflux of ammonium as well as MA was obtained when growth of WT/empty vector and WT/RhAG cells were compared on low (1 mm) ammonium medium (Fig. 4B). Growth of WT/RhAG was consistently reduced, suggesting that expression of RhAG results in reduced availability of ammonia/ammonium under these culture conditions. In summary, the measurable efflux of MA from WT/RhAG cells, along with the compromised growth on low ammonium, support a hypothesis that RhAG mediates MA/ammonium export in yeast. RhAG-mediated MA Resistance Is pH-dependent—To determine whether the pH of the medium was important for RhAG-mediated resistance of WT cells to MA toxicity, as established for complementation of ammonium uptake in mep1–3Δ mutant cells (above), as well as to determine the maximum MA concentration above which RhAG could no longer mediate resistance, cells were plated on media buffered from pH 4.5 to 7.5 and supplemented with 50 mm–1 m MA. WT cells did not grow when the medium contained 50 mm MA, consistent with previous results (9Soupene E. Ramirez R.M. Kustu S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5733-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). RhAG expression conferred resistance to varying concentrations of MA, depending on the pH of the medium (Fig. 5A). At pH 4.5, RhAG conferred resistance to 1 m MA, but RhAG-mediated resistance declined as pH increased, until no resistance was observed at pH 7.5. The mep1–3Δ mutant is resistant to MA but is nevertheless sensitive to very high MA concentrations (Fig. 5B). Sensitivity of the mep1–3Δ mutant probably results from passive membrane permeation of unprotonated MA, which probably diminishes the membrane proton gradient and neutralizes acidic compartments (9Soupene E. Ramirez R.M. Kustu S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5733-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To determine whether expression of RhAG could confer resistance to these high MA concentrations in the mep1–3Δ mutant cells, we plated mep1–3Δ/empty vector- and mep1–3Δ/RhAG-transformed cells on medium with various concentrations of MA with pH buffered from 4.5 to 7.5, as was done for WT cells. RhAG expression conferred resistance to the mep1–3Δ mutant in a pH-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). Resistance extended to equivalent MA concentration levels in both WT and mep1–3Δmutant cells expressing RhAG. In summary, expression of RhAG conferred resistance in both WT and mep1–3Δ mutant yeast strains to approximately equivalent concentrations of MA. These results suggest that the mechanism of RhAG-mediated resistance was the same in both WT cells and in the ammonium transport mutant cells. Thus, RhAG function in yeast is independent of the presence or absence of the endogenous transporters and does not involve inhibition of endogenous ammonium uptake mechanisms. In contrast, RhAG expression stimulated MA efflux rates, which suggests that enhanced MA extrusion is responsible for resistance conferred by its expression. In addition, RhAG-mediated resistance to MA toxicity was influenced by medium pH, being greatest at pH 4.5, with no resistance conferred at pH 7.5. This suggests that RhAG-mediated MA efflux is pH-dependent, promoted by the H+ gradient. Ammonium transport in bacteria, yeast, and plants is important for nitrogen acquisition. The mechanisms of transport and the chemical nature of the substrate transported (protonated NH4+ or unprotonated NH3) by ammonium transport proteins are active areas of investigation and debate (8von Wiren N. Gazzarrini S. Gojon A. Frommer W.B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 9Soupene E. Ramirez R.M. Kustu S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5733-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We recently reported that human erythrocyte RhAG mediates transport of ammonium when it is expressed in X. laevis oocytes, providing the first unequivocal evidence for solute transport by RhAG and establishing the Rh family as the first mammalian transport proteins with ammonium as a principal substrate (10Westhoff C.M. Ferreri-Jacobia M. Mak D.-O.D. Foskett J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12499-12502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Functional characterization of the RhAG-mediated ammonium-transport process in oocytes revealed that uptake was strongly stimulated either by raising extracellular pH or by lowering intracellular pH. Those results led us to hypothesize that RhAG functions by electroneutral H+-coupled counter-transport, with transport driven in part by the proton gradient across the plasma membrane. To further delineate the functional properties of RhAG, we expressed RhAG in both an S. cerevisiae ammonium-transport mutant (mep1–3Δ) and the parental wild-type (WT) strain. When expressed in the mep1–3Δ transport mutant, RhAG complemented the growth defect observed in media with low ammonium concentrations. Whereas this result is consistent with a previous report (18Marini A.M. Matassi G. Raynal V. Andre B. Cartron J.P. Cherif-Zahar B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), we found that complementation was highly pH-dependent. The growth enhancement conferred by RhAG expression was only observed after extended incubation in medium buffered above pH 6.1, whereas it did not occur at the acid pH values common in yeast culture media. This pH requirement for RhAG-mediated complementation correlates with the predicted plasma membrane proton gradient (Table I). The intracellular pH (pHi) in yeast is correlated with the pH of the medium (pHo) (19Cimprich P. Slavik J. Kotyk A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 130: 245-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At acidic pHo 4.3–5.3, the pHi is relatively alkaline, so the direction of the proton gradient is inward. However, at pHo 6.2–6.9, pHi is lower, so the proton gradient is directed outward. This reversal in the proton gradient at pH 6.2 correlates with the pH requirement (>6.1) we observed for RhAG-mediated complementation of ammonium uptake in the mep1–3Δ mutant yeast. These results therefore suggest that RhAG-mediated ammonium uptake requires an outwardly directed proton gradient (Fig 6A).Table IThe intracellular pH in yeast cells (pHi) and the resulting proton gradient is a function of medium pH (pHo) (19Cimprich P. Slavik J. Kotyk A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 130: 245-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)External pH (pHo)Intracellular pH (pHi)Proton gradient4.35.2Inward5.35.6-5.7Inward6.26.0Outward6.96.5Outward Open table in a new tab Enhanced uptake of the analog [14C]MA in the mep1–3Δ cells that expressed RhAG could not be measured, which is consistent with results from another group (18Marini A.M. Matassi G. Raynal V. Andre B. Cartron J.P. Cherif-Zahar B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), but differs from our observations in X. laevis oocytes in which enhanced uptake was observed with RhAG expression (10Westhoff C.M. Ferreri-Jacobia M. Mak D.-O.D. Foskett J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12499-12502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The inability to detect [14C]MA accumulation in RhAG-expressing mep1–3Δ mutant yeast cells over a 1–2-h time period is perhaps not inconsistent with the extended incubation (∼5 days) required to observe complementation. The different observation in yeast and oocytes probably reflects their distinct physiology. Indeed, in yeast, the membrane potential is maintained via the H+-ATPase, and metabolic extrusion of protons causes acidification of the medium (16Serrano R. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1991Google Scholar). Consequently, an inwardly directed proton gradient develops in yeast culture, which would diminish the proton gradient required for ammonium uptake. The small magnitude of the outward proton gradient at pHo 6.2 (∼0.2 pH units) in yeast cells probably accounts for the weak complementation and the failure to measure flux uptake. When expressed in either WT cells or in the mep1–3Δ mutant cells, RhAG expression conferred resistance to toxic concentrations of MA. The mechanism of resistance was investigated in detail in the WT cells, because they accumulated measurable amounts of [14C]MA that enabled measurements of RhAG-mediated fluxes of MA. We found that resistance was associated with MA efflux. The rate of efflux from WT/RhAG cells was ∼60% greater than that measured from WT cells. This was consistent with the 50–64% reduction in accumulation of MA in WT/RhAG-expressing cells compared with WT cells. In contrast to ammonium uptake complementation, the enhanced MA efflux conferred by RhAG expression was potentiated at acid pHo, where the direction of the proton gradient is inward. These results taken together suggest that RhAG can function bi-directionally in yeast, mediating either uptake or efflux of substrate (Fig. 6A). The opposing pH dependences of complementation and resistance suggests that MA/ammonium movement is influenced by the pH gradient across the plasma membrane, supporting the hypothesis that RhAG-mediated transport is driven by the proton gradient. The observation that RhAG was more effective at mediating efflux of MA/ammonium (resistance to MA toxicity) than at mediating influx of MA/ammonium (complementation of mep deficiency) when expressed in yeast is consistent with the magnitude of the pH gradient across the yeast plasma membrane under the two assay conditions. Taken together, the results we have obtained in yeast are in good agreement with those obtained in frog oocytes (10Westhoff C.M. Ferreri-Jacobia M. Mak D.-O.D. Foskett J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12499-12502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and they support a model in which RhAG-mediated ammonium transport is coupled to H+ transport in the opposite direction. The actual substrate transported by RhAG, unprotonated NH3, and/or protonated NH4+, or both, has not been unequivocally determined. Investigation of ammonium/MA transport is complicated because unprotonated forms can diffuse across biological membranes. MA is a weak base, and because the uncharged species is lipid-soluble, it has been used to estimate the pH gradient across membranes. At a given concentration of MA (pKa 10.6), the unprotonated species increases ∼10-fold with each pH unit (Fig. 5B). At high concentrations of MA, membrane permeation of the unprotonated species will diminish the proton gradients across the yeast plasma and vacuolar membranes. The resulting loss of driving force for nutrient uptake and the neutralization of acidic compartments are detrimental to growth (9Soupene E. Ramirez R.M. Kustu S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5733-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The ability of unprotonated-MA permeation to disrupt intracellular pH gradients will depend on the activities of other mechanisms to defend them, particularly the H+-ATPase. The MA sensitivity of the untransformed mep1–3Δ mutant cells that lack the Mep transporters reflects these effects of membrane permeation of unprotonated MA. As shown in Fig. 5B, the untransformed mep1–3Δ mutant cells are sensitive to MA at pH 4.5 at unprotonated MA concentrations between approximately 0.5–0.6 μm, but the cells are much less sensitive at pH 6.5, requiring MA concentrations nearly 20 times greater to induce toxicity. The activity of the yeast H+-ATPase is optimum at pH 6.0–6.5 (16Serrano R. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1991Google Scholar) with markedly less activity (62–30% of the maximum level) at pH 4.0–2.4 (20Carmelo V. Bogaerts P. Sa-Correia I. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, the proton pump is able to defend cellular proton gradients against MA-induced disruption well at pH 6.5 but weakly at pH 4.5. As further evidence that yeast sensitivity to high concentrations of MA is related to diminishing the proton gradient, we observed that untransformed control WT and mep1–3Δ cells were more resistant to MA at pH 4.5–5.5 when glucose, rather than galactose, was provided as the carbon source (data not shown). Glucose metabolism causes intracellular acidification, and both the yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase and the vacuolar V-ATPase, which is responsible for organelle acidification, are activated by glucose (21Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations are consistent with diminished proton gradients as the mechanism for MA toxicity, and they raise the interesting possibility that the RhAG-mediated resistance to high concentrations of MA (>1 m at pH 4.5) not only reduces the MA load but also provides protons (illustrated in Fig. 6B). A model that can account for the marked resistance to MA conferred in yeast by the expression of RhAG is one in which RhAG mediates exchange of cationic MA+ with H+. Thus, we suggest that the influx of protons may be critical to the mechanism of RhAG-mediated resistance to MA toxicity in yeast and is consistent with our hypothesis that RhAG functions by H+/NH4+ exchange.

We examined whether PU.1, a myeloid-specific Ets family transcription factor, is involved. Sequence analysis revealed two potential c-Ets binding sites in the COX-2 promoter (COX-2p) which bind to immunoreactive PU.1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis shows inducible PU.1 binding to these sites in response to lipopolysaccharide, and COX-2 protein production is augmented by ectopic expression of PU.1 but not by PU.1<sup>S148A</sup>, indicating that PU.1 phosphorylation is likely involved. Interestingly, expression of PU.1 results in acetylation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (C/EBP-β) and increased production of COX-2 protein. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments suggest a role for p300 in C/EBP-β acetylation and COX-2 expression. In contrast, E1A inhibits acetylation of C/EBP-β and is correlated with decreased COX-2 expression. Together, these data suggest that PU.1 is activated by phosphorylation of Ser<sup>148</sup> in response to lipopolysaccharide treatment and subsequently binds to sequences in the endogenous COX-2p in a time-dependent manner. Concomitantly, C/EBP-β becomes acetylated, and expression of the COX-2 gene increases.

Harkrader R.J. Tattersall M.H.N. Fox R.M. Nucleosides and Cancer Treatment. Academic Press, Sydney1981: 18-31Google Scholar), and 2) both proteins are folate-dependent enzymes that can utilize the same cellular folate transport systems that facilitate entry of natural folates into the cell. ATIC is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the final two steps of the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway (3Beardsley G.P. Rayl E.A. Gunn K. Moroson B.A. Seow H. Anderson K.S. Vergis J. Fleming K.

The AICAR transformylase domain (residues 199-592) catalyzes the transfer of the one-carbon formyl group from the co-factor N10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate (10-f-THF) to the substrate AICAR to produce 5-formyl-AICAR and tetrahydrofolate (see Fig. 1A). The cyclohydrolase domain (residues 1-198) then enhances the intramolecular cyclization of 5-formyl-AICAR to the final product of the pathway, IMP, via elimination of a water molecule. The individual AICAR transformylase and IMP cyclohydrolase domains can be expressed separately and are active (4Rayl E.A. Moroson B.A. Beardsley G.P. J. Biol.

From these structures, His267 was proposed to increase the nucleophilicity of the 5-amino group of AICAR and then act as a catalytic base to deprotonate the AICAR amino group concomitant with nucleophilic attack of the substrate formyl group on 10-f-THF (6Wolan D.W.

However, Burroughs Wellcome (Research Triangle Park, NC) has designed and synthesized two antifolates that are specific (nm) for human ATIC, as compared with other folate-dependent enzymes, GAR Tfase, dihydrofolate reductase, and thymidylate synthase. These compounds are both sulfamido-bridged 5,8-dideazafolate analogs identified as BW2315U89UC (BW2315) and BW1540U88UD (BW1540) (see Fig. 1A) that differ only in the disposition of the imido and sulfonyl groups within the bridge region (see Fig. 1A). BW1540 and BW2315 have approximate Ki values against human ATIC of 8 and 6 nm, respectively, whereas the Ki values against GAR Tfase, dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthase are within the micromolar range, except for BW1540, which showed low nanomolar inhibition against dihydrofolate reductase. 2R. Ferrone, personal communication. Cytotoxicity assays against human colon cell lines yielded an approximate IC50 of 0.7-3 μm for BW1540 and 1-5 μm for BW2315. To elucidate their mechanism of inhibition, BW1540 and BW2315 were co-crystallized with human ATIC in the presence of substrate AICAR. These first human ATIC ternary complexes with independently bound substrate and folate moieties not only advance the ATIC mechanistic studies but provide insights into the future design of antifolates selective against ATIC. Materials—Luria broth and agar were obtained from Invitrogen. All common buffers and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The folate-based inhibitors BW1540U88UD and BW2315U89UC were kind gifts from Dr. Robert Ferrone (Burroughs Wellcome). Protein Preparation and Purification—Human ATIC was prepared as previously reported (22Wolan D.W. Cheong C.G. Greasley S.E. Wilson I.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1171-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Inhibitors BW1540 and BW2315 and substrate AICAR were added in a 10-fold molar excess to human ATIC protein (0.1-0.4 mg/ml), heated in a 37 °C water bath for 30 min to prevent precipitation, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C. The protein solution was concentrated to 10 mg/ml using Millipore Ultrafree-15 filters (molecular mass of 10,000 Da) and stored at 4 °C for crystallization experiments. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of human ATIC in complex with AICAR and BW1540 were grown at 4 °C by sitting drop vapor diffusion by mixing equal volumes of human ATIC (10 mg/ml) and a reservoir solution consisting of 17% polyethylene glycol 3000, 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 6 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 m NaCl.

The data were collected to 2.55 Å resolution on a single, flash-cooled crystal at 83 K in a cryoprotectant consisting of mother liquor and 20% glycerol on Beamline 11.1 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (Menlo Park, CA). The data were processed to 2.55 Å with HKL2000 (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

For the BW1540 complex, the rotation and translation search, using all data from 15.0-3.5 Å, identified two monomers in the asymmetric unit with a final correlation co-efficient and Rcryst of 55.5 and 44.3%, respectively (note that for the first noise peak, correlation coefficient = 26.4 and Rcryst = 56.2%). The two monomers form the biologically relevant homodimer as observed in previous avian ATIC structures (5Greasley S.E. Horton P. Ramcharan J. Beardsley G.P. Benkovic S.J. Wilson I.A. Nat. Struct.

For the BW2315 complex, the rotation search (15.0-4.0 Å) identified four major solutions with correlation co-efficients of 13.9-12.1 (noise peak = 8.8); the subsequent translational search yielded a final correlation co-efficient of 60.8 and a Rcryst of 39.4%.

Approximate 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were applied during the initial round of refinements and then released later to accommodate differences within the individual monomers. Water molecules were automatically positioned by CNS using a 3 σ cut-off in Fo-Fc maps and manually inspected. For the BW1540 structure, the final Rcryst and Rfree are 18.9 and 25.7%, respectively.

The refined human ATIC BW1540 structure consists of residues 4-592 in monomer A and residues 5-592 in monomer B with 399 water molecules, two potassium ions, two BW1540 inhibitors within the AICAR Tfase domains, but only one XMP in the IMP cyclohydrolase active site of monomer A (Fig. 1B). XMP is carried through protein purification and crystallization and also selectively binds to only one of the two IMP cyclohydrolase active sites in the homodimer in apo avian and human ATIC structures (5Greasley S.E.

No main chain density was observed between residues 482 and 485 (B), 481-485 (C), and 477-486 (D). Each monomer has a bound potassium ion within the AICAR Tfase domain with only one XMP per dimer (monomers A and C). Interpretable density for the substrate AICAR was found only in monomers B, C, and D, whereas interpretable BW2315 density was found only in monomers B and D.

Despite resolution of the crystal structure of Stat3 homodimer bound to DNA, the structural basis for the unique specificity of Stat3 SH2 for YXXQ-containing phosphopeptides remains unresolved. We tested three models of this interaction based on computational analysis of available structures and sequence alignments, two of which assumed an extended peptide configuration and one in which the peptide had a β-turn. By using peptide immunoblot affinity assays and mirror resonance affinity analysis, we demonstrated that only phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) peptides containing +3 Gln (not Leu, Met, Glu, or Arg) bound to wild type Stat3. Examination of a series of wild type and mutant Stat3 proteins demonstrated loss of binding to pYXXQ-containing peptides only in Stat3 mutated at Lys-591 or Arg-609, whose side chains interact with the Tyr(P) residue, and Stat3 mutated at Glu-638, whose amide hydrogen bonds with oxygen within the +3 Gln side chain when the peptide ligand assumes a β-turn.

Coussens L. Hayflick J.S. Dull T.J. Gray A. Tam A.W. Lee J. Yarden Y. Libermann T.A. Schlessinger J. et al.Nature. 1984; 309: 418-425Google Scholar). Ligand-induced dimerization of EGFR allows reciprocal transphosphorylation of residues within the catalytic domain of the kinase leading to its enzymatic activation and autophosphorylation of C-terminal cytoplasmic tyrosine residues. Five autophosphorylation sites have been identified in EGFR as follows: Tyr-992, Tyr-1068, Tyr-1086, Tyr-1148, and Tyr-1173 (11Downward J. Parker P.

These phosphorylated tyrosine residues serve as docking sites for signal proteins containing Src homology (SH2) domains, including phospholipase C-γ (13Rotin D. Margolis B. Mohammadi M. Daly R.J.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3923-3930Google Scholar), which was shown by us to bind to EGFR at Tyr(P) sites located at Tyr-1068 and Tyr-1086. Both of these tyrosine residues are followed at the Tyr(P) +3 position by Gln thereby conforming to the consensus Stat3 SH2-binding motif, YXXQ (20Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Google Scholar, 21Weber-Nordt R.M. Riley J.K. Greenlund A.C. Moore K.W. Darnell J.E. Schreiber R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27954-27961Google Scholar). The preference of Stat3 SH2 for Tyr(P) peptide ligands containing Gln (or the polar residues Thr or Cys) at the +3 position is unique among SH2 domains. The structural basis for this is unknown but could be exploited to specifically target Stat3 activation in cancers such as squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in which Stat3 activation occurs downstream of activated EGFR.Although the structure of Stat3 SH2 bound to Tyr(P) ligand has not been solved, the structure of Stat3β bound to DNA has been encompassing the domains of Stat3β from residues 127 to 722 including the SH2 domain (22Becker S. Groner B. Muller C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 145-151Google Scholar). The authors concluded that Stat3 SH2 shares structural features of other SH2 domains having a central, three-stranded anti-parallel β-pleated sheet (strands B-D) flanked by helix αA and strands βA and βG. However, since the electron density was not well defined for the SH2 domain and the Tyr(P)705-containing phosphopeptide region, the structure obtained did not clarify the preference of Stat3 SH2 for binding to phosphopeptide ligands with Tyr(P) +3 Gln (or +3 Thr because Thr-708 is located at the +3 position downstream of Tyr(P)-705). Two models have been proposed to explain this preference (23Hemmann U. Gerhartz C. Heesel B. Sasse J. Kurapkat G. Grotzinger J. Wollmer A. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Graeve L. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12999-13007Google Scholar, 24Chakraborty A. Dyer K.F. Cascio M. Mietzner T.A. Tweardy D.J. Blood. 1999; 93: 15-24Google Scholar); both assume an extended configuration for the Tyr(P) peptide ligand and two pockets as follows: one, a positively charged pocket that interacts with the Tyr(P) residue; and the other, a hydrophilic pocket that interacts with the +3 Gln; but neither model has been tested and verified.By using wild type and mutated EGFR Tyr-1068 PDPs in peptide immunoblot and mirror resonance affinity analyses, we demonstrated the following. 1) Tyr(P) binding requires interaction of the phosphate group with the side chains of Lys-591 and Arg-609 within the Stat3 SH2. 2) The +3 Gln is required for binding of Stat3 to pYXXQ-containing peptides. 3) Binding of Stat3 SH2 to pYXXQ-containing peptides does not require the side chains of Glu-638, Tyr-640, and Tyr-657 or Tyr-657, Cys-687, Ser-691, and Glu-692 proposed to form pocket 2 in the Chakraborty et al.

Rather, our affinity analysis coupled with computer modeling supports a model in which the Tyr(P) ligand has a β-turn and the oxygen on the side chain of the +3 Gln forms a bond with the amide hydrogen within the peptide backbone of Stat3 at Glu-638. These findings have important implications for design of peptidomimetics to specifically target Stat3 recruitment and activation in cancer cells.EXPERIMENT PROCEDURESSite-directed Mutagenesis of Stat3 and EGFR—Human Stat3α cDNA was a gift from Dr. Rolf Van de Groot (25Caldenhoven E. van Dijk T.B. Solari R. Armstrong J. Raaijmakers J.A.M. Lammers J.W.J. Koenderman L. de Groot R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13221-13227Google Scholar). A HindIII/XhoI DNA fragment containing Stat3α was cloned into the baculovirus expression vector, pFastBac1 (Invitrogen), with a 6-histidine tag engineered onto the N terminus of human Stat3. Single or combination mutations were generated by using Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to target amino acid residues within the Stat3 SH2 domain implicated in models of Stat3 SH2-phosphotyrosine binding (K591L, R609L, E638P, E638L, Y640F, Y657F, C687A, S691A, and Q692L; Fig. 1). The sequence of each constructs was verified by sequencing analysis.Expression and Purification of Stat3 Proteins—The wild type and mutated Stat3 plasmid was used to transform DH10Bac-competent cells, which contain a bacmid with a mini-attTn7 target site and helper plasmid. Recombinant bacmids were prepared and used to infect Sf9 cells. Sf9 cells (3 × 106 cells per ml) were infected with Stat3 recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.05 and harvested after a 3-day culture. Cells (6 × 108) were suspended in 12 ml of pre-cooled lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm imidazole) and lysed by ultrasonication on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) at 4 °C for 1 h. The Ni-NTA resin was washed twice with 4 volumes of wash buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 mm imidazole) to remove unbound proteins. Stat3 was eluted from the Ni-NTA resin with elution buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 250 mm imidazole). The purified proteins were dialyzed against 10 mm PBS at 4 °C and stored at -80 °C.Peptide Synthesis—The peptides listed in Table I were synthesized in the Baylor College of Medicine Protein Core Facility on an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) model 433A peptide synthesizer using standard 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl amino acid chemistry. Seventy percent of the peptide reaction mix was biotinylated at the N terminus while the peptide remained on the resin using d-Biotin-LC (AnaSpec, Inc.). All peptides were purified using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and were ≥95% pure.Table ITyrosine-phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides synthesized based upon the EGFR sequencePeptideSequenceTyr(P)-992TDSNF(pY)RALMDETyr(P)-1068LPVPE(pY)INQSVPpY1068RLPVPE(pY)INRSVPpY1068ELPVPE(pY)INESVPpY1068MLPVPE(pY)INMSVPpY1068LLPVPE(pY)INLSVPTyr-1068LPVPEYINQSVPTyr(P)-1086VQNPV(pY)HNQPLNTyr-1086VQNPVYHNQPLNTyr(P)-1148VGNPE(pY)LNTVQPTyr(P)-1173LDNPD(pY)QQDFFP Open table in a new tab Phosphopeptide Affinity Immunoblot Analysis—NeutrAvidin-agarose (40 μl; Pierce) was incubated with 10 μg of biotinylated peptide in 300 μl of Buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm NaCl) at 4 °C for 2 h and washed with Buffer A three times. The NeutrAvidin-peptide complex was then mixed with His-tagged Stat3 protein (5 μg) in 1 ml of Buffer A (without NaCl and Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for 2 h and washed thoroughly. Bound proteins were separated and immunoblotted using Stat3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) as described (19Shao H. Cheng H.Y. Cook R.G. Tweardy D.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3923-3930Google Scholar).Mirror Resonance Affinity Assay—Kinetics experiments were performed using an Iasys Auto+ resonant mirror biosensor (Affinity Sensor, Paramus, NJ) as described (26Schuenke K.W. Cook R.G. Rich R.R. Hum. Immunol. 1998; 59: 783-793Google Scholar). Briefly, two-welled cuvettes coated on the bottom of each well with biotin were purchased from Affinity Sensor and prepared for immobilization of biotinylated peptides by coating each surface with 0.04 mg/ml NeutrAvidin (Pierce) and washing with PBS-T (20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.05% Tween 20). Biotinylated peptide (5 μg) was added into each well, experimental peptide to one well and control peptide to the other, and change in arc seconds was monitored simultaneously in both wells by using the biosensor until stable followed by washing with PBS-T. Real time binding of Stat3 was conducted at 25 °C at a stir speed of 70 for 10 min starting at the lowest concentration of Stat3. The wells were washed out with three changes of 60 μl of PBS-T, and dissociation was allowed to proceed for 5 min. Each well bottom was regenerated by washing with 50 μl of 100 mm formic acid for 2 min and equilibrated with PBS-T for the next round of association assay. Data were collected automatically and analyzed with the FASTplot and GraFit software (27Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines1998Google Scholar).CD—CD spectra of the wild type and E638P mutants of Stat3 were recorded between the 280 and 190 nm range in 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline on an Olis DSM 1000 CD spectrophotometer. Measurements were performed at a protein concentration of 1.8 and 1.6 μm for the wild type and mutant Stat3, respectively, using a 1-mm cuvette. Spectra were acquired at 10 °C with a 2-s integration time and repeated three times for each sample.RESULTSRequirement for +3 Glu within the Tyr-1068 Phosphopeptide Ligand for Stat3 Binding—Our previous studies indicated that sites of autophosphorylation within the C terminus of EGFR at Tyr-1068 and Tyr-1086, which are each followed at the Tyr(P) +3 position by Gln, mediated the recruitment of Stat3 leading to its activation (19Shao H. Cheng H.Y. Cook R.G. Tweardy D.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3923-3930Google Scholar). Peptide affinity immunoblot analysis and mirror resonance imaging studies using phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated dodecapeptides based on the amino acid sequence within the region of the EGFR containing Tyr-1068 and Tyr-1086 demonstrated the requirement for their phosphorylation on tyrosine to achieve measurable binding of native and recombinant Stat3. These studies also revealed that Tyr-1068 phosphododecapeptide bound with 2-fold higher affinity than Tyr-1086 PDP.To determine whether or not the polar residue Gln at the +3 position of Tyr(P)-1068 peptide is essential for Stat3 SH2 binding, we synthesized a panel of tyrosine-phosphorylated dodecapeptides based on Tyr-1068 in which +3 Gln was left unchanged or replaced by a residue with a non-polar side chain Leu or Met, an acidic side chain Glu, or a basic side chain Arg (Table I). Each peptide was incubated with equal amounts of purified wild type Stat3 protein in peptide pull-down assays (Fig. 1). Immunoblotting for Stat3 demonstrated a prominent Stat3 band in pull-down assays using wild type Tyr-1068 PDP. In contrast, little to no Stat3 was detected in pull-down assays using PDPs in which the Gln was mutated to Leu, Met, Glu, or Arg similar to results using unphosphorylated Tyr-1068 dodecapeptide. Thus, Gln at the +3 position of Tyr-1068 phosphopeptide is required for Stat3 binding and appears to be as important for Stat3 binding as phosphorylation on tyrosine. Real time resonance mirror affinity assays using Tyr-1068 Gln to Arg PDP, which was the only PDP to demonstrate any detectable binding of Stat3 in peptide immunoblot studies, demonstrated that mutation of Gln to Arg decreased Stat3 binding to undetectable levels (data not shown).The Side Chains of Lys-591 and Arg-609 within Pocket 1 of Stat3, but Not the Side Chains of Amino Acid Residues within Pocket 2, Are Essential for Stat3 Binding to YXXQ-containing Phosphopeptides—Hemmann et al. (23Hemmann U. Gerhartz C. Heesel B. Sasse J. Kurapkat G. Grotzinger J. Wollmer A. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Graeve L. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12999-13007Google Scholar) and we (24Chakraborty A. Dyer K.F. Cascio M. Mietzner T.A. Tweardy D.J. Blood. 1999; 93: 15-24Google Scholar) proposed previously two distinct but overlapping two-pocket models for the binding of YXXQ-containing PDP ligands by the Stat3 SH2 domain; both models assumed the peptide ligand was in an extended configuration (Fig. 2, A and B). In our model, the phosphotyrosine residue interacts with a positively charged pocket (pocket 1) within the SH2 domain formed primarily by the side chains of Lys-591 and Arg-609 and secondarily by the side chains of Ser-611, Glu-612, and Ser-613. The Tyr(P) +3 Gln was predicted to interact with a hydrophilic pocket (pocket 2) formed by the side chains of Glu-638, Tyr-640, and Tyr-657. In the Hemmann model, the phosphotyrosine was predicted to interact with the side chain of Arg-609 (pocket 1) and the +3 Gln with the side chains of Tyr-657, Cys-687, Ser-691, and Glu-692 (pocket 2).Fig. 2Models of Stat3 SH2-phosphotyrosine binding and Stat3 proteins generated to test them. Schematic representation of the two models of Stat3 SH2 binding to pYXXQ peptide proposed by Chakraborty (A) and Hemmann (B) each involving two pockets. The phosphotyrosine (pY) interacts with a positively charged pocket formed by the side chains of Lys-591, Arg-609, Ser-611, Glu-612, and Ser-613 (A) or by Arg-609 (B), whereas Tyr(P) +3 Gln interacts with a hydrophilic pocket within the SH2 domain formed by the side chains of Glu-638, Tyr-640 and Tyr-657 (A) or Tyr-657, Cys-687, Ser-691, and Glu-692 (B). C, mutations were introduced at the amino acid residues indicated (+) to generate a panel of wild type and mutant Stat3 proteins. D, wild type and mutant Stat3 proteins, each with an N-terminal His tag, were expressed in Sf9 insect cells and affinity-purified using Ni-NTA-agarose. The eluates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue (top panel) or immunoblotted using Stat3 mAb (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In order to test each of the two models proposed, we generated Stat3 mutants in which mutations were introduced to change charged or polar side chains to non-polar within amino acid residues predicted in each model to be critical for Stat3 binding (Fig. 2C). His tags were added at the N terminus of each protein to aid in purification; we demonstrated previously that this modification did not interfere with binding of wild type Stat3 to native full-length, activated EGFR, or to PDPs Tyr-1068 and Tyr-1086. The recombinant Stat3 proteins were expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified to equivalent levels using Ni-NTA resin (Fig. 2D).Peptide affinity immunoblot studies using Stat3-3M to test the pocket 2 component of the Chakraborty model demonstrated levels of Stat3-3M bound to Tyr-1068 and Tyr-1086 PDPs similar to wild type Stat3 (Fig. 3A). Peptide affinity immunoblot studies using Stat3-4M to test the pocket 2 component of the Hemmann model demonstrated levels of binding of Stat3-4M bound to Tyr-1068 and Tyr-1086 phosphopeptides equal to or greater than wild type Stat3 (Fig. 3A). Stat3-6M, in which all six amino acid residues predicted by both models to form pocket 2 were mutated, also bound both PDPs at levels similar to wild type Stat3 as did Stat3-2M and Stat3-3M+C687A. These results do not support either model for Stat3 SH2 binding to +3 Glu within phosphopeptide ligands.Fig. 3Requirement for Arg-609 and Lys-591, but not any of the proposed pocket 2 residues, for Stat3 SH2 binding to Tyr-1068 and Tyr-1086 PDP. A, NeutrAvidin-agarose was incubated with the indicated biotinylated peptides (see Table I for sequence) or no peptide (CON) as control, washed thoroughly, and mixed with identical amounts of wild type or mutant Stat3 proteins as indicated. Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using Stat3 mAb. Lane ST represents purified wild type Stat3 (0.6 μg) loaded directly onto the gel as positive control. B and C, mirror resonance affinity assay. Two cells of a biotin-coated cuvette pretreated with saturating amounts of NeutrAvidin. One well of the cuvette was pretreated with biotinylated phosphopeptide based on Tyr-1068 (pY1068, left panel), whereas the other well was pretreated with biotinylated non-phosphorylated peptide Tyr-1068 (Y1068, right panel) as a control for nonspecific binding. Wild type or mutated Stat3 protein was added in the concentrations indicated to each of the two cells, and mirror resonance measurements were recorded continuously for 10 min as shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To test the pocket 1 component of the two models and to ensure that our peptide pull-down system was sufficiently sensitive to detect reduced binding of Stat3 containing mutations in pocket 2, we added either K591L or R609L to the 3M mutant to generate Stat3-3M+K591L and Stat3-3M+R609L. Addition of either mutation resulted in elimination of binding to both Tyr-1068 and Tyr-1086 PDPs indicating that each of the side chains of Lys-591 and Arg-609 make important contributions to binding of the phosphotyrosine.To confirm these findings and to determine whether introduction of the pocket 2 mutations resulted in subtle alterations in kinetics of binding undetectable using phosphopeptide affinity immunoblot analysis, we performed mirror resonance affinity assays using phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated Tyr-1068 dodecapeptide (Fig. 3, B and C, and Table II). Review of the real time mirror resonance affinity curves (Fig. 3, B and C) and kinetic analysis (Table II) revealed undetectable binding of Stat3-3M+Lys-591 and Stat3-3M+Arg-609 to phosphorylated Tyr-1068 dodecapeptide confirming the results of peptide immunoblot analysis. Furthermore, each of the pocket 2 mutant Stat3 proteins examined (3M, 4M, and 6M) demonstrated ka, kd, and KD values for binding to Tyr-1068 PDPs indistinguishable from wild type Stat3, confirming the peptide immunoblot analysis and indicating that Stat3 SH2 binding to the +3 Gln within Tyr-1068 does not require any of the side chains predicted in either of the proposed models.Table IIKinetics of wild type and mutant Stat3 binding to Tyr-1068 PDP determined by mirror resonance biosensor analysisStat3kaaAssociation rate constant determined from slope of line from plot of ka versus [ligand].kdbDissociation rate constant determined from y intercept of plot of ka versus [ligand].KDcDissociation equilibrium constant determined from ratio of kd/ka.m−1 s−1ms−1nmWT30730.72233M33710.61774M2673 ± 481dMean ± S.E. of two separate experiments.0.8 ± 0.3271 ± 486M2619 ± 674dMean ± S.E. of two separate experiments.0.7 ± 0.3249 ± 22a Association rate constant determined from slope of line from plot of ka versus [ligand].b Dissociation rate constant determined from y intercept of plot of ka versus [ligand].c Dissociation equilibrium constant determined from ratio of kd/ka.d Mean ± S.E. of two separate experiments. Open table in a new tab Computational Modeling of Stat3 SH2 Binding to +3 Glu within YXXQ-containing Phosphopeptides—To generate a new and more accurate model for Stat3 SH2 binding to +3 Gln, we used the structure of Tyr-1068 phosphopeptide (EpYINQ), available from its crystal structure bound by Grb2 (28Rahuel J. Garcia-Echeverria C. Furet P. Strauss A. Caravatti G. Fretz H. Schoepfer J. Gay B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 1013-1022Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1ZFP), and the structure of Stat3 from Trp-580 to Leu-670, obtained from the crystal structure of Stat3β bound to DNA (22Becker S. Groner B. Muller C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 145-151Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1BG1), to computationally model the interaction with the lowest energy. All energy minimization calculations were carried out under AMBER force field by using the DISCOVER/Insight II program. A total of 300 steps of conjugate gradient energy minimization was performed following rigid hand-docking to fit the Tyr(P) of the EpYINQ peptide into the binding pocket composed of residues Lys-591 and Arg-609 by taking into consideration Van der Waals and Coulomb forces. The interaction between Stat3-SH2 and EpYINQ with the complex lowest energy (Fig. 4A) had a total binding energy of -478.8 kcal/mol. This computational result predicted that the major binding energy for this binding configuration comes from a hydrogen bond interaction involving oxygen within the Tyr(P) +3 Gln side chain and the peptide amide hydrogen at Glu-638 located within a loop region of Stat3 SH2.Fig. 4Revised model of Stat3 SH2 binding to +3 Gln within YXXQ-containing phosphopeptide ligands. A, computational modeling using the Biopolymer program in the Insight II environment was used to perform local energy optimization of the interaction of Stat3 SH2 (shown as a gray ribbon) with phosphopeptide ligand (EpYINQ shown as a green ribbon) based upon the known structures of each. As indicated, the oxygen on the side chain of the Tyr(P) +3 Gln within the EpYINQ peptide is predicted to form a hydrogen (H-bond) bond with the amide hydrogen at Glu-638 and to make a major contribution to the binding energy. The positions are shown for the side chains of Lys-591 and Arg-609 proposed to be major contributors to pocket 1, Glu-638, Tyr-640, and Tyr-657 proposed by Chakraborty to form pocket 2, and for the side chain of Trp-623 proposed to force a β-turn in the peptide ligand. The +3 Gln and Glu-638 are shown as ball-and-stick models, the remaining side chains as stick models; oxygen atoms are shown in red, carbon in gray, nitrogen in blue, and phosphorus in orange.

Shortening of the polymorphic N-terminal polyglutamine (poly(Q)) tract of the AR gene leads to transcriptional hyperactivity and has been correlated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. The underlying mechanisms for these effects are poorly understood. We show here that androgen-dependent cellular proliferation and transcription in prostate cancer cells is inversely correlated to the length of the AR poly(Q) region. We further show that AR proteins containing a shortened poly(Q) region functionally respond to lower concentrations of androgens than wild type AR. Whereas DNA binding activity is relatively unaffected by AR poly(Q) variation, we found that ligand binding affinity and the ligand-induced NH2- to COOH-terminal intramolecular interaction is enhanced when the poly(Q) region is shortened. Importantly, we show that AR proteins containing a shortened poly(Q) region associate in vivo with higher levels of specific p160 coactivators and components of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex as compared with the wild type AR. Collectively, our findings suggest that the AR transcriptional hyperactivity associated with shortened poly(Q) length stems from altered ligand-induced conformational changes that enhance coactivator recruitment.

The AR is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor (NR) superfamily that mediates the action of lipophilic ligands including steroids, retinoids, vitamin D3 and thyroid hormone (5Mangelsdorf D.J.

NRs share common structure and functional domains including a variable N-terminal domain (NTD), a centrally located and highly conserved DNA binding domain, a hinge region, and a C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD) (5Mangelsdorf D.J.

Transcriptional activation by NRs is mediated by both a poorly conserved constitutive activation function 1 (AF-1) in the NTD (8Chamberlain N.L. Whitacre D.C. Miesfeld R.L. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation by AR involves a ligand-induced intramolecular interaction between its NTD and its LBD (12Ikonen T. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. J. Biol.

It was recently found that FXXLF and WXXLF motifs in the AR NTD facilitate direct interactions with the AF-2 domain in the LBD (14He B. Kemppainen J.A. Voegel J.J. Gronemeyer H. Wilson E.M. J. Biol.

Importantly, the NTD/LBD interaction is essential for AR transactivation and is believed to generate a composite binding site for the recruitment of transcriptional coregulatory factors (17Saitoh M. Takayanagi R. Goto K. Fukamizu A. Tomura A. Yanase T. Nawata H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 694-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). AR can regulate transcription by modifying the chromatin structure near AR target genes and by facilitating the recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. Specific transcriptional coregulatory factors termed coactivators and corepressors are indispensable for these activities (reviewed in Ref. 18Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 175-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). The p160 family of proteins are among the best characterized NR coactivaors (19Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

For most NRs, the p160 proteins directly contact the AF-2 region in the NR-LBD through consensus LXXLL motifs (also termed NR boxes) (11Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 19Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, AR is unique among other NRs in that its ligand-induced intramolecular NTD/LBD interaction appears to be essential for p160 binding and that, in contrast to other NRs, specific motifs in the AR NTD may provide part of the p160 binding surface (26Alen P.

SWI/SNF-like complexes can actively mobilize nucleosomes in the vicinity of target genes in an ATP-dependent manner and are believed to generate a chromatin structure that promotes transcriptional initiation (29Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Whereas the mechanisms by which SWI/SNF complexes are recruited to AR remain unclear, recent studies found that the core SWI/SNF ATPases Brg1 and hBRM are differentially required for AR-mediated transcription at different AR target promoters (30Marshall T.W. Link K.A. Petre-Draviam C.E. Knudsen K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30605-30613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition to the p160 and SWI/SNF complexes, a host of other AR-interacting coregulatory factors and complexes have been identified and proposed to play additional coregulatory roles including the multiprotein TRAP-Mediator complex (31Huang Z.Q. Li J. Sachs L.M. Cole P.A. Wong J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2146-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 36Wang Q. Sharma D. Ren Y. Fondell J.D. J. Biol.

Chang C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 175-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). The AR-NTD contains an inherited polymorphic glutamine repeat region (termed poly(Q)) that begins at amino acid 58 and can typically range in size from 5 to 33 Gln residues with an average length of 20 repeats (37Clark P.E. Irvine R.A. Coetzee G.A. Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 255-266PubMed Google Scholar, 38Choong C.S. Wilson E.M. J. Mol.

Short poly(Q) repeats (≤19) have been clinically correlated with a higher risk of prostate cancer, an earlier age of onset, and a higher grade and more advanced stage of prostate cancer at the time of diagnosis (37Clark P.E.

Several studies have demonstrated an inverse correlation between the length of the poly(Q) region and AR transcriptional activity (45Chamberlain N.L. Driver E.D. Miesfeld R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3181-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar, 46Jenster G. de Ruiter P.E. van der Korput H.A. Kuiper G.G. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O.

Metab. 1997; 82: 3777-3782Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Interestingly, truncation or complete deletion of the poly(Q) region can enhance AR-mediated transactivation in the presence of overexpressed p160 proteins (49Irvine R.A. Ma H. Yu M.C. Ross R.K. Stallcup M.R. Coetzee G.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 50Callewaert L. Christiaens V. Haelens A. Verrijdt G. Verhoeven G. Claessens F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), consistent with the idea that a shortened poly(Q) region can promote coactivator recruitment. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms responsible for the hyperactive transcriptional activity in AR proteins containing shortened poly(Q) regions remain poorly defined. In this study, we investigated the molecular and functional consequences of shortening the poly(Q) region in AR proteins expressed in primary malignant and metastatic prostate cancer cells. In agreement with previous studies, we found that androgen-dependent AR transactivation activity increases as the number of Gln repeats decreases. Interestingly, we show here an inverse correlation between androgen-dependent cellular proliferation and poly(Q) length. Furthermore, we found that AR proteins containing a shortened poly(Q) region functionally respond to lower levels of ligand than the wild type AR. Whereas DNA-binding activity appears to be unaffected by shortening the poly(Q) region, we found that AR ligand binding affinity and its ligand-induced NTD/LBD intramolecular interaction is enhanced when the poly(Q) region is shortened. Importantly, we show that AR proteins containing a shortened poly(Q) region are associated in vivo with higher levels of specific p160 coactivators and components of the SWI/SNF complex. Taken together, our findings suggest that several molecular mechanisms contribute to the AR functional hyperactivity inversely correlated with poly(Q) length. Plasmid Construction—The pcDNA-AR-Q9, pcDNA-AR-Q20 (wild type), and pcDNA-AR-Q44 constructs were provided by G. A. Coetzee (University of Southern California) (49Irvine R.A. Ma H. Yu M.C. Ross R.K. Stallcup M.R. Coetzee G.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and were further confirmed by sequencing. The pMMTV-Luc reporter gene was described previously (51Wang Q. Fondell J.D. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 289: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The pGL3-PSA-Luc reporter gene was a gift from T. A. Libermann (Harvard Medical School) (52Oettgen P. Finger E. Sun Z. Akbarali Y. Thamrongsak U. Boltax J. Grall F. Dube A. Weiss A. Brown L. Quinn G. Kas K. Endress G. Kunsch C. Libermann T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1216-1225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To construct pBabe Hyg-f:AR-Q9, a XmaI/AflII fragment from pcDNA-AR-Q9 was first subcloned into the XmaI/AflII sites of pT7-FLAG-AR (51Wang Q. Fondell J.D. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 289: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), generating pT7-FLAG-AR-Q9. An NdeI/BamHI fragment from pT7-FLAG-AR-Q9 was then subcloned into the NdeI/BamHI sites of pTetCMV-F0(S)-AR (51Wang Q. Fondell J.D. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 289: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), thus generating pTetCMV-F0(S)-AR-Q9. A BglII/BamHI fragment from pTetCMV-F0(S)-AR-Q9 was inserted into BamHI-digested pBabe Hyg vector from C.-M. Chiang (Case Western Reserve University), generating pBabe Hyg-f: AR-Q9. The pBabe Hyg-f:AR-Q20 (wild type) construct was generated by subcloning the BglII/BamHI fragment from pTetCMV-F0(S)-AR into the BamHI site of pBabe Hyg vector. To generate pcDNA-AR-NTD-Q44 (amino acids 1–521), a point mutation of pcDNA-AR-Q44 was introduced at amino acid residue 522 to generate a stop codon (TGA) using the GeneEditor Mutagenesis system (Promega) and the mutagenic oligonucleotide 5′-CCT GAT GTG TGA TAC CCT GGC-3′. Briefly, the DNA template was alkaline-denatured and then hybridized with the appropriate selection and mutagenic oligonucleotide. After the annealing reaction, mutant strand synthesis and ligation were obtained by adding T4 DNA polymerase and T4 DNA ligase. The mutant was verified by sequencing. To construct pcDNA-AR-NTD-Q9 (amino acids 1–488) and pcDNA-AR-NTD-Q20 (amino acids 1–499), the AflII/EcoRI fragments (containing a stop codon at amino acid 522) from pcDNA-AR-Q44 (amino acids 1–521) were subcloned into AflII/EcoRI sites of pcDNA-AR-Q9 and pcDNA-AR-Q20. The pcDNA-AR-LBD (amino acids 506–919) was generated by first creating a NheI site at residue 1662, a Kozak sequence (from residue 1670–1678), and a BamHI site at residue 2996 by PCR amplification using the 5′ primer 5′-GAT GTG TGC TAG CCT GCC GCC ATG GTG A-3′ and the 3′ primer 5′-GCA CTC AGA GGA TCC GTG CAG AG-3′. The PCR fragment was then digested with NheI and BamHI and subsequently subcloned into the NheI/BamHI sites of pcDNA 3.1(+) vector (Promega). Cell Culture—PC-3 and DU145 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA) and were grown in DMEM/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. 1532T cells (malignant human primary prostate epithelial cells immortalized with human papilloma virus) from S. Topalian (NCI, National Institutes of Health) (53Bright R.K. Vocke C.D. Emmert-Buck M.R. Duray P.H. Solomon D. Fetsch P. Rhim J.S. Linehan W.M. Topalian S.L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 995-1002PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in keratinocyte-SFM (KSFM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract, 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin, 2.5 μg/ml fungizone, and 10 mm HEPES. CV-1 cells (obtained from the ATCC) were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin, and 10 mm HEPES. Establishment of Stable Cell Lines—To generate 1532T cell lines stably expressing FLAG-tagged AR-Q20 or FLAG-tagged AR-Q9, the amphotrophic retroviral packing cell line ϕNX-A from G. Nolan (Stanford University) was grown in DMEM plus 10% FBS and transfected with 15 μg of pBabe Hyg-f:AR-Q20 or pBabe Hyg-f:AR-Q9 construct in a 10-cm plate using a modified calcium phosphate transfection method (54Parker B.A. Stark G.R. J. Virol. 1979; 31: 360-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cultured supernatant containing viral particles was collected 48 h post-transfection and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. 10–20 μl of filtered supernatant was added to 2 ml of KSFM medium containing polybrene (Sigma) (final concentration 5 μg/ml) and used to infect 1532T cells. Cells were incubated for 26 h before being split 1:3 for hygromycin selection (50 μg/ml). After 5 weeks of selection, individual hygromycin-resistant colonies were clonally expanded into cell lines and further characterized. Western Blot—For detection of f:AR expression in 1532T cells stably transfected with f:AR-Q20 or f:AR-Q9, equal numbers of cells were lysed with 150 μl of lysis buffer containing 1× Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μl/ml 100 mm sodium orthovanadate). Cell lysate was prepared and transferred to cold microcentrifuge tubes and incubated on ice for 20 min. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 20 s, and the lysate was transferred to a new tubes. Equivalent amounts of lysate were added to sample loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, and then fractionated by 8% SDS-PAGE. The PAGE-fractionated protein extracts were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with anti-AR monoclonal antibodies (anti-AR441; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblot signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL system; Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For examination of AR-NTD-Qn or AR-LBD expression in transient transfected CV-1 cells, protein extract was made using 1× lysis buffer (Promega) and was probed with either anti-AR441 or anti-AR C-19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Transient Transfections—Transient co-transfections of AR-Qn (AR-Q9,-Q20, and -Q44) constructs and reporter genes in prostate cancer cells (PC-3, DU 145, or 1532T cells) were carried out using LipofectAMINE PLUS™ reagent (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. The cells were plated in 12-well plates (1.5 × 105 cells/well) in DMEM/F-12 medium containing 10% charcoal/dextran-stripped FBS (for PC-3 and DU 145 cells) or KSFM medium containing 5% charcoal/dextran-stripped FBS (for 1532T cells) 24 h prior to transfection. A DNA mixture containing 0.4 μg of AR plasmid (pcDNA-AR-Q9, pcDNA-AR-Q20, or pcDNA-AR-Q44) or empty pcDNA-3.1(+) plasmid, 0.2 μg of reporter plasmid (pMMTV-Luc, or pPSA-Luc) and 0.2 μg of the internal control plasmid pSV-β-gal was combined with LipofectAMINE reagent and added to each well. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 3 h before replacing the media with fresh DMEM, 10% charcoal, dextran-stripped FBS lacking or containing different concentrations of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (10-12, 10-11, 10-10, and 10-7m final). The cells were further incubated for 24 h and then harvested with a lysis buffer supplied in a luciferase kit (Promega). Luciferase activity was then measured in a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (EG&G Wallac, Inc.) The β-galactosidase activity of the lysed transfected cells was determined using a kit (β-galactosidase enzyme assay system; Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Saturation Ligand Binding Assay—To determine the relative kinetics of androgen binding to f:AR-Q9 and f:AR-Q20, 1532T/f:AR-Q9 and 1532T/f:AR-Q20(b) cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates in steroid-free medium (KSFM supplemented with 5% charcoal/dextran-stripped FBS, 50 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract, 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor) and allowed to attach overnight. The following day, the medium was aspirated and replaced with steroid-free, serum-free Iscove's modified Eagle's medium containing [17α-methyl-3H]R1881 (specific activity 70–87 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (0.06–3.6 nm) in the presence or absence of a 500-fold excess of cold DHT to determine nonspecific binding and 1 μm R5020 (a synthetic progesterone) to saturate progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors. After an incubation period of 2 h at 37 °C, cells were washed twice with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% SDS and 20% glycerol. Extracts were removed, and cell-associated radioactivity was counted with a scintillation counter. The data were analyzed and kDa and Bmax were determined by nonlinear regression using Graphpad Prism software. Mammalian Two-hybrid Assay—Transient co-transfections of AR-NTD-Qn (AR-NTD-Q9, -Q20, and -Q44), AR-LBD constructs, and MMTV reporter gene in CV-1 cells were carried out using LipofectAMINE PLUS™ reagent (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. The cells were plated in 12-well plates (1.5 × 105 cells/well) in DMEM containing 10% charcoal/dextran-stripped FBS 24 h prior to transfection. A DNA mixture containing 0.2 μg of AR-LBD plasmid (pcDNA-AR-LBD (amino acids 506–919)) with 0.2 μg of AR-NTD-Qn plasmid (pcDNA-AR-NTD-Q9 (amino acids 1–488), PC DNA-AR-NTD-Q20 (amino acids 1–499), or pcDNA-AR-NTD-Q44 (amino acids 1–521)) or 0.2 μg of empty pcDNA-3.1(+) plasmid, 0.1 μg of reporter plasmid (pMMTV-Luc) and 0.2 μg of the internal control plasmid pSV-β-gal was combined with LipofectAMINE reagent and added to each well. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 3 h before replacing the media with fresh DMEM plus 10% charcoal/dextran-stripped FBS lacking or containing different concentrations of DHT (10-10 and 10-7m final). The cells were further incubated for 24 h and then harvested with a lysis buffer supplied in a kit as described above. Luciferase activity was then measured as described above. Electromobility Shift Assay—The AR response element (ARE) located in the MMTV long terminal repeat promoter (5′-AGC TTT ATG GTT ACA AAC TGT TCT TAA AGT CGA-3′) (55Claessens F. Alen P. Devos A.

The double-stranded ARE was then labeled by filling in with [α-32P]dATP (50 μCi; Amersham Biosciences) and Klenow enzyme. For f:AR protein used in EMSA, f:AR was immunopurified from 1532T/f: AR-Q9 and 1532T/f:AR-Q20 cell lines using anti-FLAG antibodies coupled to agarose beads (Sigma) and subsequently eluted using a FLAG peptide as described previously (51Wang Q. Fondell J.D. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 289: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). f:AR was incubated for 15 min at room temperature in a binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris·Cl (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 with 2 ng of labeled double-stranded ARE probe. The reactions were electrophoresed in a prerun 5% polyacrylamide gel, 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA at 100V for 3–4 h. Gel was dried and autoradiographed. Cellular Proliferation Assay—To determine the effects of R1881 on the growth of 1532T/f:AR-Q20(b) and 1532T/f:AR-Q9 cells in vitro, 1532 T cells were grown as mentioned under “Cell Culture.” Cells were plated at 1.2 × 104 cells/well in KSFM medium containing 5% charcoal/dextran-treated FBS for 24 h. Then R1881 (10-7 and 10-10m) was added to the culture medium and the cells were incubated for 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. The cells then were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde and stained with 0.5% crystal violet. Plates were rinsed and air-dried, and the dye was eluted with Sorensen's solution. Absorbance at 590 nm was measured by a precision microplate reader (Fisher). Limited Proteolytic Digestion Assay—[35S]Methionine-labeled pcDNA-AR-Q9 and pcDNA-AR-Q20 (wild type) were translated in vitro using a TNT T7 quick coupled transcription/translation kit (Promega Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions in the presence of 25 μm ZnCl2. 5 μl of labeled translation product was incubated for 10 min in the presence or absence of 100 nm R1881 at 30 °C.

Both CD47 and IgV-GPI were found in cholesterol-rich rafts prepared in the absence of detergent, but only CD47 could recruit αvβ3 and its associated signaling molecules to these domains. Thus CD47-αvβ3 complexes in cholesterol-rich raft domains appear to engage in Gi-dependent signaling whereas CD47-αvβ3 interactions that lead to integrin clustering are also detergent resistant, but are insensitive to cholesterol depletion and do not require the transmembrane region of CD47.

Integrins form complexes with other transmembrane proteins that can modulate their functions. Lateral integrin partners include growth factor receptors, tetraspanins, and CD47, an Ig family protein also known as integrin-associated protein (IAP) (1Brown E.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).

Investig. 2001; 107: 1499-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). CD47 is both physically and functionally associated with β3 and β1 integrins (4Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Dimitry J.M. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 5Wang X.Q. Frazier W.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and mediates a range of adhesion-related processes. Ligation of CD47 with thrombospondin (TSP), or a peptide, 4N1K, derived from its C-terminal domain, augments cell spreading and migration on αvβ3 substrates and αIIbβ3- and α2β1-mediated platelet aggregation (6Chung J. Gao A.G. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14740-14746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 7Chung J. Wang X.Q. Lindberg F.P. Frazier W.A. Blood. 1999; 94: 642-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These actions are inhibited by pertussis toxin treatment, indicating a role for heterotrimeric Gi in CD47 signaling (8Frazier W.A. Gao A.G.

In fact, detergent-stable complexes of CD47 and Giα with both αvβ3 and αIIbβ3 have been isolated, suggesting that CD47 and the integrin may combine to form a functional 7-TM complex that functions like a G protein coupled receptor (4Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Dimitry J.M. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 6Chung J. Gao A.G. Frazier W.A. J. Biol.

The αvβ3-CD47-Gi complex has also been found in Triton X-100-resistant membrane domains, or rafts, which are thought to act as organizing platforms for diverse signaling pathways, including those involving growth factors, G protein-coupled receptors, and T cell activation (9Green J.M. Zheleznyak A. Chung J. Lindberg F.P. Sarfati M. Frazier W.A. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 10Rebres R.A. Green J.M. Reinhold M.I. Ticchioni M. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 278: 7672-7680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Depletion of membrane cholesterol was shown to destabilize the αvβ3-CD47-Gi complex in C32 melanoma and ovarian carcinoma cells, suggesting that intramembrane contacts controlling its localization to rafts may promote or even be required for complex assembly and Gi-coupled signaling (9Green J.M. Zheleznyak A. Chung J. Lindberg F.P. Sarfati M. Frazier W.A. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). CD47-mediated signaling also occurs in Jurkat T cells, where treatment with certain anti-CD47 antibodies promotes apoptosis via a Gi-mediated pathway involving cyclic AMP regulation of cAMP-dependent kinase (11Manna P.P. Frazier W.A. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3544-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Ligation of CD47 with other antibodies has been shown to have a synergistic effect on T cell activation that required the MMS domain of CD47 for both the T cell response and for raft localization (10Rebres R.A. Green J.M. Reinhold M.I. Ticchioni M. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 278: 7672-7680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus raft localization may play a role in organizing CD47 signaling complexes in a number of systems. Recently, effects of CD47 on β3 integrin functions have been reported that appear to be independent of downstream signaling. αIIbβ3-mediated platelet aggregation was stimulated by TSP peptide in energy-depleted cells shown to be deficient in signaling (12Fujimoto T. Katsutani S. Shimomura T. Fujimura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26655-26665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 4N1K peptide-induced activation of αIIbβ3, as measured by binding of PAC-1 antibody to transfected cells, required only the presence of the extracellular IgV domain of CD47, added either as a soluble protein or expressed with a generic membrane anchor (12Fujimoto T. Katsutani S. Shimomura T. Fujimura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26655-26665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, a previous study had shown that expression of the CD47 extracellular IgV domain in ovarian carcinoma cells was required for αvβ3-mediated binding of vitronectin-coated beads (13Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Reinhold M.I. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the physical association of only the IgV domain of CD47 can affect β3 integrin function. Thus CD47 may influence β3 functions through interactions that involve different regions of the molecule. While it seems that signaling-dependent actions of CD47 may require cholesterol-rich domains, the possible role of membrane domains in more direct effects on the conformation of its associated integrin is unknown. In this study, we have examined the ability of CD47 association to promote activated states of αvβ3, and addressed the role of detergent resistant membrane domains in CD47 modulation of integrin function. CD47 interactions with αvβ3 were found to promote both integrin activation induced by RGD peptide, and αvβ3 avidity in binding immobilized substrates by enhancing integrin clustering. These effects resulted from CD47-αvβ3 complexes that were resistant to cholesterol depletion, although they still resided in Triton-insoluble membrane domains. These CD47-αvβ3 complexes were distinct from those localized in cholesterol-rich domains, which were disrupted by cyclodextrin treatment, and required the MMS segment of CD47 for integrin and G protein association. Thus, both the physical nature of CD47-αvβ3 complexes and their effect on integrin functions can be influenced by their location in different membrane microdomains. Reagents and Cell Lines—The human ovarian carcinoma cells, known as OV10, were maintained as previously described (4Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Dimitry J.M. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The stable transfections of αvβ3, CD47, and IgV-GPI have been previously reported by Lindberg et al. (13Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Reinhold M.I. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and the cells used in this study were derived from the same lines. For all experiments, OV10 cells were previously treated with serum-free media for 16-18 h. Cell manipulations were carried out in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution containing 20 mm HEPES pH 7.5 (HBSS) with additional reagents for each application. Anti-β3 mAbs AP3 (14Newman P.J. Allen R.W. Kahn R.A. Kunicki T.J. Blood. 1985; 65: 227-232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 7G2 (15Brown E.J. Goodwin J.L. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 777-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and anti-CD47 2D3 and B6H12 (16Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Schwarz E. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 485-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) have been previously described. The anti-αvβ3 mAb LM609 and anti-αvβ5 mAbs P1F6 were generous gifts of Dr. David Cheresh (Scripps Research Institute), and the two ligand-induced binding sites (LIBS) antibodies, LIBS1 and LIBS6, were generously provided by Dr. Mark Ginsberg (Scripps Research Institute). Polyclonal antibodies for Western blots of integrin β5 subunit, Giα, Gβ, Src, Lyn, and FAK were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and the mAb for SHP-2 was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. FITC-anti-mouse IgG (Sigma Chemical Co.) was employed as the secondary antibody for flow cytometry experiments, and horseradish peroxidase conjugates of antirabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Laboratories) were used for Western blots. The peptides 4N1K (KRFYVVMWKK), 4NGG (KRFYGGMWKK), and GRGDSP were synthesized as previously described (17Kosfeld M.D. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16230-16236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BCECF-AM was purchased from Molecular Probes, and BS3 was from Pierce Chemical Co. Optiprep™ was obtained from Axis-Shield (Oslo, Norway). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company unless otherwise stated. Cholesterol Depletion of OV10 Cells—5 × 106 cells were brought up at 1.25 × 106/ml in serum-free Iscoves media containing 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA with or without 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (Aldrich Chemicals) and incubated on a rocker at 37 °C for 20 min. This procedure has been shown to reduce total cellular cholesterol by 40% in OV10 cells (9Green J.M. Zheleznyak A. Chung J. Lindberg F.P. Sarfati M. Frazier W.A. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). After washing, cells were resuspended in appropriate media or buffers for cell adhesion, lysis, or FACS staining. Flow Cytometry—Expression of CD47, β3, αvβ3, and LIBS epitopes in OV10 cells was measured by flow cytometry. 2 × 104 cells were resuspended in 50 μl of FACS buffer (1% BSA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2 in HBSS) with 10 μg/ml of primary antibody and incubated on ice for 30 min. For detection of LIBS binding, GRGDSP was included at 0.1-2mm, and the incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 15 min followed by 15 min on ice. Cells were washed and incubated in 50 ml of the same buffer containing goat anti-mouse IgG-FITC (Fc-specific) at a 1:50 dilution for an additional 30 min. After washing, the cells were diluted to 0.4 ml and analyzed on a flow cytometer using the Cell Quest software program. Cell Adhesion—A rapid, non-washing, fluorescence-based assay (18Weetall M. Hugo R. Friedman C. Maida S. West S. Wattanasiu S. Bouhel R. Weitz-Schmidt G. Lake P. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was employed to measure cell adhesion at an early time point before cell spreading occurred. OV10 cells were resuspended at 1.25 × 106/ml in 5 ml of HBSS containing BCECF, and incubated on a rocker at 37 °C for 20 min. Cells were washed, resuspended in 4 ml of binding buffer (1.5% BSA, 2 mm MgCl2,1mm CaCl2 in HBSS) at 0.2 × 106/ml, and dispensed into V-well plate at 100 μl/well. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and immediately centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 C. Unbound cells were detected from triplicate fluorescence measurements (fluorescein parameters) of cells at the bottom of wells as measured with an FLX800 plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.). Total cell fluorescence was determined from measurements of cells in uncoated wells. Percent cell binding was calculated based on the total cell fluorescence for each cell type and the unbound cell fluorescence for individual samples. Isolation of Detergent-stable Complexes—Monoclonal antibodies AP3 and B6H12 were coupled to sheep anti-mouse 4.5-μm magnetic beads, and vitronectin was coupled to 4.5-μm tosyl-activated magnetic beads (Dynal) according to the manufacturer's protocols. 5 × 106 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of HBSS with 0.1 mm MnCl2, and bound to substrate-coated magnetic beads (2 × 107) by mixing at room temperature for 20 min. Unbound cells were removed in the supernatant after placing the sample in a magnet, and the beads were washed 1× in the same way. Bead-bound cells were taken up in 1 ml of lysis buffer (HBSS containing 10 mm CHAPS, 250 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm MnCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture), and mixed for 10 min at room temperature. Beads were resuspended in 20 μl of HBSS with 2.5 units of DNase I and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Complexes were extracted with 2× sample buffer at 65 °C for 15 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Cross-linking of β3 Aggregates—Cells were bound to AP3 or vitronectin-coated magnetic beads as described above. After washing, bead-bound cells were resuspended in 1 ml of HBSS containing 0.5-5 mm BS3, and mixed at 4 °C for 90 min. The beads were resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 m glycine and 1% BSA, and mixed at room temperature for 15 min. The isolated beads were then treated with lysis buffer and DNase I as described above, followed by analysis of β3 integrin by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Detergent-free Isolation of Rafts—The preparation was carried out according to the method of Smart et al. (19Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Approximately 100 × 106 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of ice cold buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA) and lysed with 20 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer, followed by extrusion through a 20-gauge needle 20×. The lysate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. The pellet was subjected to the same homogenization procedure just described, and the supernatants were combined and brought up to 2 ml with buffer A. The sample was layered over 8 ml of 30% Percoll in buffer A, and centrifuged in a 75 Ti rotor on a Beckman L8-80 M Ultracentrifuge at 84,000 × g. The plasma membrane fractions normally migrated near the middle of the gradient as detected by Western blotting for transferrin receptor (not shown), and could be visually distinguished as a discrete band. This region was collected by pipette and brought up to 2 ml with buffer A. To this sample was added 1.84 ml of buffer C (50% Optiprep in 120 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 0.25 m sucrose, 6 mm EDTA) + 0.164 ml buffer A, over which was layered an 8-ml Optiprep gradient of 10-20% (made from dilutions of buffer C in buffer A). The sample was centrifuged in an SW41 rotor at 52,000 × g for 90 min. The top 5 ml containing the light membranes were collected and mixed with 4 ml of buffer C. The lower 4 ml were pooled and taken as the raft-depleted membranes. The light membrane mixture was placed in an ultracentrifuge tube, over, which was layered 3 ml of a 4% Optiprep solution (made by diluting buffer C with buffer A). The sample was centrifuged in the SW41 rotor as before to produce a membrane band clearly visualized at the gradient interface. This material was collected by pipette and taken as the purified raft fraction. Separation of Triton-soluble from Triton-insoluble Cell Fractions— This procedure was similar to the method described by Maile et al. (20Maile L.A. Inai Y. Clarke J.B. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1800-1805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and is based on the association of detergent-resistant domains with the cytoskeletal pellet (21Oliferenko S. Paika K. Harder T. Gerke V. Schwarzler C. Schwarz H. Beug H. Gunthert V. Huber L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). 5 × 106 cells were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (0.2% Triton X-100 in HBSS containing 2 mm MgCl2,1mm CaCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture) and clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and taken as the Triton-soluble fraction. The pellet was resuspended at room temperature in 1 ml of HBSS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm MgCl2,1mm CaCl2, and protease inhibitors, followed by centrifugation as before. This supernatant was collected and taken to be the Triton-insoluble fraction, with the remaining pellet containing the insoluble cytoskeleton. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were carried out on 50-μl aliquots of the Triton-soluble and Triton-insoluble fractions for each condition. Binding of LIBS Antibodies to αvβ3 Is Enhanced by CD47 Expression—To determine if CD47 expression can have a direct influence on αvβ3 activation, binding of antibodies recognizing LIBS was measured for OV10 cells co-transfected with CD47 and β3 integrin. The transfection and selection of clones for the cell lines employed in this study have been previously reported (13Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Reinhold M.I. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Transfection of these cells with only β3 chain results in expression of αvβ3 as a result of assembly with endogenous αv. This does not result in overexpression because the level of αvβ3 expression is limited by the level of αv and is near the level of αvβ5 expressed in wild-type OV10 cells (9Green J.M. Zheleznyak A. Chung J. Lindberg F.P. Sarfati M. Frazier W.A. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). CD47 was expressed in these cells in its wild-type form and as a fusion protein containing the IgV domain linked to a glycophosphatidylinositol anchor (IgV-GPI) (13Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Reinhold M.I. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). As compared with wild-type CD47, the IgV-GPI species has been shown to be deficient in downstream T cell signaling induced by CD47 ligation (22Rebres R.A. Vaz L.E. Green J.M. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 2762001Google Scholar) (10Rebres R.A. Green J.M. Reinhold M.I. Ticchioni M. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 278: 7672-7680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (45) Google Scholar). On the other hand, as discussed above, IgV-GPI supported vitronectin-coated bead binding when co-expressed with αvβ3, and so may serve as an indicator of signaling-independent effects of CD47 (13Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Reinhold M.I. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). As measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 1, A and B), expression levels of wild-type CD47 and IgV-GPI were within 5% of each other, and levels of αvβ3 were also comparable among the cell lines employed, with a general order of IgV-GPI > CD47-> CD47+ (Fig. 1B). To correct for the small differences in integrin expression, anti-LIBS mAb binding was normalized to the binding of non-LIBS antibody LM609. Based on the LIBS1/LM609 binding ratio, neither wild-type CD47 nor IgV-GPI activated αvβ3 in the absence of RGD or Mn2+ (not shown). However, RGD-induced binding of LIBS-1 was enhanced with expression of either CD47 species (Fig. 1, A and C), with IgV-GPI producing the largest effect. Binding of LIBS6 was also increased with CD47 expression, and again IgV-GPI produced a larger increase in the maximal level of RGD-induced binding compared with wild-type CD47 (Fig. 1D). The enhanced binding appeared to result from an increase in the maximal binding at saturating RGD concentrations (Fig. 1E). Thus surface expression of the IgV domain of CD47 resulted in an increase in the number of “activable” integrin molecules, or the fraction of αvβ3 susceptible to stimulation by RGD peptide. The thrombospondin C-terminal peptide 4N1K was also tested for an ability to induce LIBS binding, but at concentrations up to 100 μm, no effect was observed either in the presence or absence of RGD for any cell line (not shown). Because cholesterol has been shown to be a component of the CD47-integrin complex (9Green J.M. Zheleznyak A. Chung J. Lindberg F.P. Sarfati M. Frazier W.A. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), the effects of cholesterol depletion on activation of LIBS epitopes was examined. Rather than reducing anti-LIBS binding to CD47-expressing cells, cholesterol treatment had only small effects on binding of LIBS1 or LIBS6 for any of the cell lines, and differences in relative levels of anti-LIBS binding with CD47 or IgV-GPI expression was unchanged by cyclodextrin treatment (Fig. 1, C and D). Thus membrane cholesterol depletion did not disrupt the CD47-mediated changes in αvβ3 that are responsible for anti-LIBS binding. That IgV-GPI induced a larger change in binding of LIBS antibodies than wild-type CD47 may indicate that transmembrane contacts might even constrain the ability of the extracellular domain of CD47 to induce conformational changes in αvβ3. In any case, the stimulation of RGD-induced binding of LIBS1 and LIBS6 indicated that IgV-integrin interactions promoted a conformational change in αvβ3 that is associated with its activation. CD47 Enhances αvβ3-mediated Adhesion through Cyclodextrin-resistant Effects—To evaluate the effects of CD47 on αvβ3- mediated cell adhesion, a rapid binding assay was used to measure OV10 cell attachment to V-well plates coated with vitronectin at high (5 μg/ml) and low (1 μg/ml) densities. At the high density, a high percentage of cells (65-80%) were bound irrespective of CD47 expression, and for all cell lines, treatment with RGD peptide reduced the binding to low levels (3-7%). Thus the assay was specific for RGD-containing substrates. Because the OV10 cells can bind to vitronectin through both αvβ3- and αvβ5-mediated adhesion, the αvβ5-blocking antibody P1F6 (4Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Dimitry J.M. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) was employed to determine αvβ3-specific effects. Cell attachment at the high ligand density showed no effect of either wild-type CD47 or IgV-GPI expression, and no major reduction was observed in cells treated with P1F6 (Fig. 2A). Thus, at this level of vitronectin, αvβ3-mediated adhesion supported nearly maximal cell attachment that was not reliant on CD47 expression. However, with cyclodextrin treatment, binding of CD47-deficient cells was reduced to about 20%, but cells expressing wild-type CD47 or IgV-GPI bound at levels of about 40 and 60%, respectively (Fig. 2A). While it is not known precisely how cholesterol depletion disrupted cell adhesion, alteration of the membrane environment could in theory influence either the ligand binding conformation of both αvβ3 and αvβ5, or the clustering of integrin molecules, as has been reported for α5β1 and LFA-1 (23Gopalakrishna P. Chaubey S.K. Manogaran P.S. Pande G. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, expression of either CD47 or IgV-GPI partially protected against this effect (Fig. 2A). Co-treatment with P1F6 and cyclodextrin did not further reduce the binding of the cells compared with cyclodextrin alone (Fig. 2A), indicating that αvβ3-mediated adhesion predominated in the cholesterol-depleted cells, and the influence of CD47 was exerted on that integrin. Treatment with LM609 to block αvβ3-mediated adhesion did not reduce cell binding (Fig. 2A), indicating that αvβ5 alone also supported adhesion at a high vitronectin density. However, blocking αvβ3 in cyclodextrin-treated cells reduced binding to a low level irrespective of CD47 expression (Fig. 2A), indicating that αvβ5-mediated adhesion was not rescued from the disruptive effects of cholesterol depletion. Thus expression of either wild-type CD47 or IgV-GPI protected the cells against the disruption of cell binding caused by cholesterol depletion by enhancing αvβ3-mediated adhesion, but not adhesion conferred by αvβ5. At the low ligand density, cell binding was reduced to about one-fourth of the high vitronectin density level for all three cell lines, and was blocked in all cases with RGD peptide (Fig. 2B). Whereas no effect of wild-type CD47 or IgV-GPI expression was detected in untreated cells, with P1F6 treatment, cell binding to vitronectin was reduced to a low level in CD47-deficient cells (Fig. 2B). Thus, at low substrate conditions, αvβ3-mediated binding was not supported, and αvβ5-mediated adhesion predominated. However, for cells expressing wild-type CD47 or IgV-GPI, only moderate or no reduction of binding was observed with P1F6 treatment (Fig. 2B), indicating that when αvβ5-mediated binding was blocked at low substrate conditions, the remaining αvβ3-mediated adhesion was CD47-dependent. For cyclodextrin-treated cells at the low vitronectin density, binding of CD47-deficient cells was reduced to a low level, and wild-type CD47 conferred only minor protection (Fig. 2B). However, binding of IgV-GPI-expressing cells was resistant to cholesterol depletion, and co-treatment with P1F6 and cyclodextrin did not result in a further significant disruption of cell adhesion (Fig. 2B), indicating the residual adhesion was because ofαvβ3. Thus IgV-GPI exhibited an even greater protective effect against the cyclodextrin-induced disruption of cell binding than wild-type CD47. Blocking αvβ3-mediated binding with LM609 treatment reduced binding to a lower level in all the cell lines. However, this amount of αvβ5-mediated binding was eliminated with cholesterol depletion with no effect of CD47 expression (Fig. 2B), indicating that a CD47-independent effect of cholesterol depletion on αvβ5-mediated binding was displayed at the low ligand density. In summary, expression of either wild-type CD47 or IgV-GPI was shown to enhance αvβ3-mediated adhesion, as detected both by an increase in binding of cells at low ligand density (Fig. 2B) and by protection against cyclodextrin-induced disruption of cell binding conferred at both high and low substrate conditions (Fig. 2A). CD47 Enhances αvβ3 Avidity for Binding Immobilized Substrate—The effect of CD47 or IgV-GPI expression to increase the fraction of integrins activated upon treatment with saturating RGD peptide (Fig. 1E) suggests that their interactions with αvβ3 can shift the integrin conformational equilibrium toward the activated state. However, enhanced cell adhesion could also be derived from an increase in avidity because of changes in the aggregation state of αvβ3 that resu"

NAD(P)H-dependent alkenal/one oxidoreductase (AOR) 1The abbreviations used are: AOR, NADPH-dependent alkenal/one oxidoreductase; 4HNE, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal; MDR, medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase; LTB4, leukotriene B4; LADH, liver alcohol dehydrogenase; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect NMR spectroscopy. is an enzyme that reduces the carbon-carbon double bond of a variety of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones (1Dick R.A. Kwak M.K. Sutter T.R. Kensler T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40803-40810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It is coregulated in the rat with a variety of phase 2/antioxidative enzymes, including NAD(P)H:quinone reductase, glutathione S-transferases, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, through the Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathway (2Primiano T. Gastel J.A. Kensler T.W. Sutter T.R. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2297-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). α,β-Unsaturated aldehydes and ketones are electrophilic and capable of reacting, via a Michael addition mechanism, with important cellular nucleophiles, which in turn leads to macromolecular (protein, DNA) dysfunction and cell death. Because saturated carbonyls lack this reactive moiety, they are often far less toxic. Thus, hydrogenation of the α,β-double bond by AOR conceptually results in detoxication (1Dick R.A. Kwak M.K. Sutter T.R. Kensler T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40803-40810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 3Haynes R.L. Szweda L. Pickin K. Welker M.E. Townsend A.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Of the AOR substrates identified, several are common environmental pollutants (methyl vinyl ketone and acrolein) or products of lipid peroxidation (4Eder E. Hoffman C. Deininger C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1991; 4: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 5Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar). The latter process involves reaction of oxygen free radicals with polyunsaturated fatty acids to form aliphatic α,β-unsaturated aldehydes such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE), 2-hexenal, and 2,4-decadienal (5Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar). These reactive molecules probably mediate many of the detrimental effects of oxidative stress. 4HNE is extremely cytotoxic, an abundant product of lipid peroxidation, and an excellent substrate of AOR (1Dick R.A. Kwak M.K. Sutter T.R. Kensler T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40803-40810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Cells engineered to overexpress AOR are resistant to 4HNE-mediated cell death and protein adduct formation (1Dick R.A. Kwak M.K. Sutter T.R. Kensler T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40803-40810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, the physiological antioxidative role of the NADPH-dependent activity of AOR was elucidated. Several additional endogenous substrates for this activity have been identified including the 15-oxoprostaglandins (6Ensor C.M. Zhang H. Tai H.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), 15-oxolipoxin A4 (7Clish C.B. Levy B.D. Chiang N. Tai H.H. Serhan C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25372-25380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and members of the prostaglandin J2 family. 2R. A. Dick and T. W. Kensler, unpublished results. Whereas the former two classes of compounds are inactive metabolites, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 is thought to be an endogenous activator of the Nrf2 transcription factor (8Uchida K. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2000; 116: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Recently, AOR was also found to reduce the 8,9-double bond of the mycotoxins illudins S and M (9Dick R.A. Yu X. Kensler T.W. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 1492-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Irofulven, an illudin S derivative and promising anti-cancer alkylating agent, was also found to be a substrate. Paradoxically, the metabolism of irofulven by AOR was found to activate its cytotoxic nature by unmasking an electrophilic cyclopropyl group. Interestingly, AOR was first isolated because of its NADP+-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase activity (10Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Takahashi T. Kasama T. Kobayashi Y. Sato F. Taketani Y. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18128-18135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Via oxidation of the 12-hydroxyl group, AOR is capable of inactivating the potent neutrophil chemoattractant leukotriene B4 (LTB4). This is not simply the reverse of NADPH-driven hydrogenation but rather a distinct catalytic activity that may occur due to a reverse substrate orientation. LTB4 is the only known substrate for this activity. Rates of NADPH-dependent α,β-double bond reduction are commonly several orders of magnitude greater than that measured for the NADP+-dependent oxidation of LTB4. Little is known of the structure of AOR. It bears similar characteristics and sequence homology to members of the medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (MDR) superfamily, which includes liver alcohol dehydrogenase (LADH), ζ-crystallin, and Escherichia coli quinone reductase, and has been classified as such (11Nordling E. Jornvall H. Persson B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4267-4276Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It is closely related to a MDR subfamily of oxidoreductases that include several putative microbial enzymes (12Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M.

This group is designated COG2130 in the clusters of orthologous groups data base (available on the World Wide Web at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG). P1-ζ-crystallin is capable of catalyzing one-electron reductions of quinones and two-electron reductions of azocarbonyls and α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones, including 4HNE (15Mano J. Babiychuk E. Belles-Boix E. Hiratake J. Kimura A. Inze D. Kushnir S. Asada K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3661-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16Mano J. Torii Y. Hayashi S.

It is also up-regulated under conditions of oxidative stress and thus, like AOR, has been termed an antioxidative enzyme. AOR may have arisen from a primitive alcohol dehydrogenase. The ability to hydrogenate electrophilic and cytotoxic α,β-unsaturated carbonyls would undoubtedly provide a selective advantage to organisms challenged with these molecules, especially in persistent cases of oxidative stress. In order to begin to determine the relationship between AOR and other MDR members, we investigated the catalytic mechanism of its robust NADPH-dependent activity. Steady-state kinetic experiments were completed to identify the kinetic mechanism. Solvent isotope effects and pH rate profiles were performed. Deuterium-labeled NADPH was used to determine kinetic isotope effects and stereospecificity of hydride transfer. Finally, chelation agents and atomic absorption spectroscopy were used to probe for the presence of catalytic or structural Zn2+. Materials—trans-3-Nonen-2-one, trans-2-nonenal, and 2-nonanone were purchased from Aldrich. D2O (“100%”), ethanol-d6, methanol-d4, and d-glucose-1-d were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. The Developmental Therapeutics Program of the NCI, National Institutes of Health, supplied illudin M. All other chemicals and enzymes including glucose dehydrogenase from Cryptococcus uniguttulatus and alcohol dehydrogenase from Thermoanaerobium brockii were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant rat AOR was produced as described previously (1Dick R.A. Kwak M.K. Sutter T.R. Kensler T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40803-40810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Steady-state Kinetic and Product Inhibition Studies—Initial velocities of NADPH oxidation were measured at 25 °C using a Beckman DU70 spectrophotometer set to monitor absorbance at 340 nm. The assay buffer was optimized to contain 100 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 150 mm NaCl. 3-Nonen-2-one reduction was determined using 580 ng of AOR, 30–150 μm substrate dissolved in acetonitrile, and 24–48 μm NADPH in 1 ml of assay buffer. 2-Nonenal reduction was determined using 50–225 μm substrate and 4.5–6 μm NADPH. Data were fit to either of the following equations using GraFit 5.0, v=Vmax[A][B]KiaKB+KA[B]+KB[A]+[A][B](Eq. 1) v=Vmax[A][B]KA[B]+KB[A]+[A][B](Eq. 2) where KA and KB are the Michaelis constants for A and B and Kia is the dissociation constant for A. Equation 1 is for a sequential mechanism with ternary complex formation, whereas Equation 2 is for a ping-pong bi bi kinetic mechanism. The F-test was used to evaluate best fits of the data. Product inhibition studies using 3-nonen-2-one were carried out with similar assay conditions. When NADPH concentrations were varied, a constant, subsaturating 3-nonen-2-one concentration of 22.5 μm was used. Similarly, a NADPH concentration of 60 μm was employed when 3-nonen-2-one concentration was varied. In the 3-nonen-2-one versus 2-nonanone experiment, inhibitor concentrations of 0, 375, 645, and 750 μm were used, whereas the 3-nonen-2-one versus NADP+ experiment employed inhibitor concentrations of 0, 50, 150, 250, and 400 μm. Similarly, in the NADPH versus 2-nonanone experiment, inhibitor concentrations of 0, 375, 750, and 1500 μm were used, whereas the NADPH versus NADP+ experiment employed inhibitor concentrations of 0, 100, 150, and 250 μm. Progesterone, a competitive (versus α,β-unsaturated ketone) dead-end inhibitor of AOR was used at concentrations of 0, 50, 125, and 250 μm to determine its mode of inhibition versus NADPH. Data were fit to one the following equations using GraFit 5.0. v=Vmax⋅[S]Km(1+[I]/Ki)+[S](Eq. 3) v=Vmax⋅[S]Km(1+[I]/Kis)+(1+[I]/Kii[S])(Eq. 4) v=Vmax⋅[S]Km+[S](1+[I]/Ki)(Eq. 5) Equation 3 is for competitive inhibition, whereas Equations 4 and 5 are for noncompetitive and uncompetitive inhibition, respectively. Equilibrium Binding Studies—Quenching of the native tryptophan fluorescence of AOR upon substrate binding was used to measure dissociation constants (Kd) of binding. Changes in tryptophan fluorescence were monitored using a using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 50B luminescence spectrometer set at an excitation wavelength of 290 nm and an emission wavelength of 340 nm (slit widths: 5 and 10 nm, respectively). Measurements were conducted on 1.14 μg of AOR dissolved in 2 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) with 150 mm NaCl. Cofactors were dissolved in water, whereas 3-nonen-2-one and 2-nonanone were dissolved in acetonitrile. Changes in fluorescence were recorded after small additive additions of substrate. Acetonitrile-only control readings were measured to adjust for effects of the solvent. To measure dissociation constants, data were fit to a modified Stern-Volmer equation using SigmaPlot 8.0. ΔF=Fmax⋅[S]Kd+[S](Eq. 6) Fmax represents the maximal change in fluorescence when all protein is bound by the ligand; S is the ligand concentration. pH Profile—Reaction buffers were composed of the following: 100 mm buffer, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl. Bis-Tris (pH 6–7), Tris-HCl (pH 7–9), and 3-(cyclohexylamino)-2-hydroxyl-1-propanesulfonic acid (pH 9–10) were used to determine initial velocities at every 0.4 pH units. Assay pH did not change significantly with the addition of enzyme or reagents. Values of V and V/Knonenone were calculated using a saturating NADPH concentration of 180 μm and varied concentrations of 3-nonen-2-one ranging from 22.5 to 112.5 μm. V/KNADPH was calculated using a saturating 3-nonen-2-one concentration of 450 μm and varied concentrations of NADPH ranging from 24 to 192 μm. pKa values were calculated using GraFit 5.0 by fitting data to the following equation, y=C⋅10(pH-pKa)10(pH-pKa)+1(Eq. 7) where C represents the pH-independent value of y. Preparation of 4S- and 4R-2H NADPH—[4S-2H]NADPH was prepared as previously described from NADP+ using glucose dehydrogenase from C. uniguttulatus and d-glucose-1-d (17Fillgrove K.L. Anderson V.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12412-12421Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, 110 units of glucose dehydrogenase were dissolved in 30 ml of potassium phosphate buffer (100 mm, 100 μm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 8 mm glucose-1-d and 4.4 mm NADP+. The reaction was monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm until no further increase in absorbance could be detected. [4R-2H]NADPH was prepared as described previously (18Zheng R. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. 7.5 mm NADP+, 585 μl of ethanol-d6, and 100 units of T. brockii alcohol dehydrogenase in 20 ml of 100 mm Tris, pH 9.0, were used. Reduced nucleotides were purified as described using a Mono Q column attached to Waters high pressure liquid chromatography pumps (19Orr G.A. Blanchard J.S. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 232-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Fractions were collected, and those that displayed absorbance ratios A260/A340 ≤ 2.3 were pooled, lyophilized, and stored at –80 °C. Measurement of Kinetic and Solvent Isotope Effects—Effects of deuterium-labeled NADPH on V and V/K were measured using varied concentrations of cofactors with a saturating (450 μm) concentration of 3-nonen-2-one. Deuterated assay buffer was prepared by dissolving 100 mm Tris, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 150 mm NaCl in D2O and exchanging the solvent with fresh D2O following evaporation with a SpeedVac. A pD of 7.2 was obtained using NaOD. Solvent isotope effects were measured using a similar assay with 3-nonen-2-one concentrations ranging from 3.75 to 112.5 μm. Regio- and Stereochemistry of Hydride Transfer—[4R-2H]NADPH and undeuterated NADPH were used in separate incubations to produce sufficient quantities of illudin M metabolite for 1H NMR. Briefly, 515 μg of AOR, 10 mg of illudin M, and 66.7 mg of cofactor were added to 50 ml of chloride-free 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). These samples were incubated in the dark at 37 °C overnight. They were then extracted three times with 50 ml of ethyl acetate, which was subsequently evaporated under vacuum. Thin layer chromatography was used to verify that reactions had gone to completion. The labeled and unlabeled metabolites were then purified using preparative thin layer chromatography, dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, and dissolved in methanol-d4 with tetramethylsilane for 1H-NMR. NMR analyses were completed on a Varian UNITY Plus 500-MHz NMR spectrometer. Spectral assignments for the illudin M metabolite were determined previously (20Tanaka K. Inoue T. Kadota S. Kikuchi T. Xenobiotica. 1990; 20: 671-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A two-dimensional NOESY 1H NMR spectrum of the unlabeled metabolite was obtained using a 1-s mixing time. Detection of Zn2+ in Enzyme Preparations—The His6 tag of recombinant AOR is an effective chelator of Zn2+ and thus required removal. This sequence was proteolytically cleaved from the protein using the EKMax protease (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. AOR lacking the His6 tag was then purified by ion exchange chromatography using SP-fast flow resin (Amersham Biosciences) followed by affinity chromatography using a High-Trap Blue column (Amersham Biosciences). SDS-PAGE was used to assay fractions for purity. No His6-tagged protein was detectable in the final preparation. Two protein samples were then dialyzed extensively (3 × 1 liter) in separate plastic beakers against 0.5× phosphate-buffered saline, made from 10× phosphate-buffered saline and distilled water (both supplied in plastic bottles by Invitrogen). These samples were then assayed for activity and protein content. They were then analyzed using an AAnalyst 600 atomic absorption spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), which was equipped with a Zn2+-specific lamp and calibrated with a solution of ZnCl2; concentrations as low as 10 pg of Zn2+/liter were used. Steady-state Kinetic Studies—Initial velocity patterns were obtained when trans-3-nonen-2-one and trans-2-nonenal concentrations were varied at different fixed levels of NADPH. Double-reciprocal plots for both substrates are shown in Fig. 1 (A and B, respectively). When either substrate was used, lines intersected to the left of the ordinate, suggesting a sequential kinetic mechanism with ternary complex formation. Data were globally fit to Equation 2. Table I shows values measured for kinetic constants Ka, Kb, and Vmax using 2-nonenal and 3-nonen-2-one as substrates. Due to sensitivity limitations of the spectrophotometric assay at low NADPH concentrations, the Km for 2-nonenal had to be obtained and verified through direct measurement. The Km for NADPH using 3-nonen-2-one as a substrate is ∼10-fold higher than that calculated for 2-nonenal. The Km for NADPH using another α,β-unsaturated ketone, chalcone, was similar to that of 3-nonen-2-one and determined to be 31.8 ± 5.1 μm. Conversely, NADH was a poor cofactor; kinetic constants could not be measured, because enzymatic rates were extremely low (20-fold less) and linear at NADH concentrations up to 5.25 mm (data not shown). Clearly, NADPH is preferred over NADH. The reverse of 3-nonen-2-one reduction could not be detected when AOR was incubated with high concentrations of 2-nonanone and NADP+.Table IKinetic constants for rat AOR determined from initial velocity studiesSubstrateKmVmaxV/Kμmmin-1m-1 min-1trans-3-Nonen-2-one28.2 ± 5.19.4 ± 0.53.3 × 105NADPHaKm for NADPH when trans-3-nonen-2-one was used as substrate.32.0 ± 3.52.9 × 105trans-2-Nonenal77.6 ± 12.1bValue calculated directly.11.8 ± 1.01.5 × 105NADPHcKm for NADPH when trans-2-nonenal was used as substrate.4.0 ± 0.729 × 105a Km for NADPH when trans-3-nonen-2-one was used as substrate.b Value calculated directly.c Km for NADPH when trans-2-nonenal was used as substrate. Open table in a new tab Poor solubility of the 2-nonenal metabolite, nonanal, precluded its use in product inhibition studies; rather, 3-nonen-2-one and 2-nonanone were utilized (Table II). NADP+ was found to exhibit competitive inhibition versus NADPH (Kis = 79.9 ± 7.2 μm) and noncompetitive inhibition versus 3-nonen-2-one (Kis = 140 ± 16 μm; Kii = 421 ± 82 μm); these data were fit to Equations 3 and 4, respectively. 2-Nonanone was found to exhibit competitive inhibition versus 3-nonen-2-one (Kis = 759 ± 71 μm) and noncompetitive inhibition versus NADPH (Kis = 3510 ± 570 μm); these data were also fit to Equations 3 and 4, respectively. These data are consistent with either a rapid equilibrium random mechanism with two ternary abortive complexes formed or a Theorell-Chance ordered mechanism (21Rudolph F.B. Purich D.L. Contemporary Enzyme Kinetics and Mechanism. Academic Press, Inc., New York1983: 207-232Google Scholar). Progesterone, a dead-end competitive inhibitor versus α,β-unsaturated ketones (1Dick R.A. Kwak M.K. Sutter T.R. Kensler T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40803-40810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), was used to distinguish between the two. Progesterone demonstrated uncompetitive inhibition versus NADPH (Fig. 2; Equation 5), and thus, the ordered Theorell-Chance mechanism is strongly favored with NADPH binding first and NADP+ leaving last (22Fromm H.J. Purich D.L. Contemporary Enzyme Kinetics and Mechanism.

Open table in a new tab Equilibrium Binding—Recombinant AOR contains five tryptophan residues, at least one of which is highly fluorescent. Quenching of this native fluorescence was utilized to measure the dissociation constants of NADPH and NADP+ binding (Fig. 3). Nearly complete quenching (∼88%) was observed with high concentrations of NADPH, whereas a more modest effect (∼22%) was observed when using NADP+. Data from titrations of the appropriate cofactors were fit to Equation 6 to calculate Kd values of 8.8 ± 0.8 μm for NADP+ and 23.3 ± 0.5 μm for NADPH. Similar experiments were attempted using 3-nonen-2-one and 2-nonanone; however, solubility issues prevented measurement of dissociation constants. No change in AOR fluorescence was observed with 2-nonanone concentrations up to 1 mm. Whereas 3-nonen-2-one additions did slightly quench AOR fluorescence, saturation could not be reached at concentrations up to 1 mm. pH Profiles—The dependence of kinetic parameters of the NADPH-dependent activity of AOR on pH were determined over a range of 6–10 (Fig. 4). The maximal velocity of 3-nonen-2-one reduction decreases at high pH as a functional group with a pKa of 9.2 ± 0.07 is deprotonated. Similar pH dependence was exhibited for V/Knonenone (pKa = 9.1 ± 0.07) and V/KNADPH (pKa of 9.3 ± 0.04). This functional group is probably acting as a general acid. No significant decrease in activity was detected at pH levels as low as 6.0. Deuterium and Solvent Kinetic Isotope Effects—Both [4S-2H] and [4R-2H]NADPH were synthesized, purified as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and used to determine stereospecificity of hydride transfer. Initial velocities of cofactor oxidation were measured (Fig. 5). A saturating concentration (450 μm) of 3-nonen-2-one was used, whereas cofactor concentrations were varied from 15 to 200 μm. Rates were most diminished when [4R-2H]NADPH was used; thus, transfer of the 4R-H is probably catalyzed by AOR. Primary kinetic isotope effects of 1.16 ± 0.06 and 1.73 ± 0.22 were measured for V and V/K, respectively, using [4R-2H]NADPH. Solvent isotope effects of 4.30 ± 0.20 and 0.98 ± 0.8 were measured for V and V/K, respectively (Fig. 6). Concomitant with the decrease in V, there was an approximate 4-fold decrease in Km. This change is probably due to a conformational change in the enzyme active site caused by the replacement of a structural water with deuterium oxide. Thus, whereas the solvent isotope effects are large, they may not accurately represent the kinetics of chemical events. Regio- and Stereoselectivity of Hydride Transfer—Illudin M was used to determine the stereospecificity of hydride transfer both from NADPH and to an α,β-unsaturated ketone (Fig. 7). Upon reduction of the 8,9-double bond of illudin M, the ketone undergoes a tautomeric rearrangement to form an unstable cyclohexadiene intermediate. The cyclopropyl group of this intermediate is very susceptible to attack by nucleophiles, particularly hydroxide and chloride ions (20Tanaka K. Inoue T. Kadota S. Kikuchi T. Xenobiotica. 1990; 20: 671-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). After the opening of the cyclopropyl ring and expulsion of water, an aromatic product is formed (Fig. 7A). Presumably, because the α,β-double bond of illudin M is situated on a cyclopentyl ring that contains methyl and hydroxyl substituents, protons of the 8-carbon of the metabolite (the two doublets at δ 2.49–2.53 and 2.74–2.78) are not equivalent and resolve discretely in 1H NMR spectra (Fig. 7B). [4R-2H]NADPH and [4R-1H]NADPH were added to separate incubations of AOR and illudin M in chloride-free potassium phosphate buffer. Metabolites were then purified and subjected to 1H NMR spectroscopic analyses. Nonstereospecific proton assignments were completed previously (20Tanaka K. Inoue T. Kadota S. Kikuchi T. Xenobiotica. 1990; 20: 671-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Upon comparison of the spectra, it is apparent that the doublet at δ 2.74–2.78 is lost when [4R-2H]NADPH cofactor is used (Fig. 7C). Additionally, consistent with the inability of deuterium to couple with neighboring protons, the doublet at δ 2.49–2.53 becomes a singlet. Two-dimensional NOESY was employed to stereospecifically assign the nonequivalent 8-protons, labeled H1 and H2 in Fig. 8. The proton of the 6-carbon (δ 4.47) interacts strongly with protons of the 13- and 14-methyl groups and weakly with those at the 15-position. The 14-methyl protons in turn interact with the 8-carbon proton at δ 2.49–2.53. The protons of the 15-methyl group interact with the 8-carbon proton at δ 2.74–2.78. A schematic of these interactions is drawn in Fig. 8. One would expect a different two-dimensional spectra if the cyclopentyl group were in the opposite “pucker” position. It is clear from the above interpretation that protons H1 and H2 can be assigned to the δ 2.49–2.53 and 2.74–2.78 doublets, respectively. These data demonstrate that AOR catalyzes the transfer of the pro-R hydride from NADPH to the β-carbon of the α,β-double bond. Further, if the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl is situated with the oxygen to the right of the carbonyl carbon, the hydride is transferred from underneath and will become the pro-R proton.

https://openalex.org/W2107005606,"Although gentamicin (GM) has been used widely as an antibiotic, the specific binding protein of the drug has not yet been understood sufficiently. Here we show that GM specifically associates with the 73-kDa molecular chaperone HSP73 and reduces its chaperone activity in vitro. In the present study, we investigated GM-specific binding proteins using a GM-affinity column and porcine kidney cytosol. After washing the column, only the 73-kDa protein was eluted from the column by the addition of 10 mm GM. None of the other proteins were found in the eluant. Upon immunoblotting, the protein was identical to HSP73. Upon CD spectrum analysis, the binding of GM to HSP73 resulted in a conformational change in the protein. Although HSP73 prevents aggregation of unfolded rhodanese in vitro, the chaperone activity of HSP73 was suppressed in the presence of GM. Using limited proteolysis of HSP73 by TPCK-trypsin, the GM binding site is a COOH-terminal for one third of the protein known to be a peptide-binding domain. During immunohistochemistry, HSP73 and GM were co-localized in enlarged lysosomes of rat kidneys with GM-induced acute tubular injury in vivo. Our results suggest that the specific association between HSP73 and GM may reduce the chaperone activity of HSP73 in vitro and/or in vivo, and this may have an interaction with GM toxicity in kidneys with GM-induced acute tubular injury.

Until about 10 years ago, it had been assumed that the folding of newly synthesized polypeptides in vivo occurs spontaneously without assisting any other proteins or metabolic energy, because unfolded proteins can reach their native conformation (their specific tertiary structure) spontaneously in vitro (1Anfincen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5064) Google Scholar). Now it is thought that the folding of many newly synthesized polypeptides in the cell are assisted by a class of proteins (molecular chaperones) which function mainly in preventing off-pathway folding reactions that lead to aggregation. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) 1The abbreviations used are: HSP, heat shock protein; HSP73 and HSP72, heat shock proteins with subunit molecular masses of 73 and 72 kDa, respectively; GM, gentamicin; NAG, N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase; CD, circular dichroism; TPCK-trypsin, treated with tosylphenylalanylchloromethane trypsin. 1The abbreviations used are: HSP, heat shock protein; HSP73 and HSP72, heat shock proteins with subunit molecular masses of 73 and 72 kDa, respectively; GM, gentamicin; NAG, N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase; CD, circular dichroism; TPCK-trypsin, treated with tosylphenylalanylchloromethane trypsin., also called molecular chaperones, are highly conserved proteins and are rapidly induced in cells in response to abrupt and adverse changes in their environment (2Lindquist S. Dev. Biol. 1980; 77: 463-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 3Itoh H. Tashima Y. Int. J. Biochem. 1991; 23: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 4Freeman B.C. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2969-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). These HSPs are constitutively expressed and fulfill functions as “molecular chaperones” under normal cellular conditions. Mammalian HSPs are classified into four families according to their approximate molecular masses and the degree of homology (2Lindquist S. Dev. Biol. 1980; 77: 463-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 3Itoh H. Tashima Y. Int. J. Biochem. 1991; 23: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar).The cytosolic 70-kDa molecular chaperones (HSP70s) are present in cells as two different gene products but are closely related to each other: a stress-inducible form, HSP72 (known as HSP70), and a constitutively expressed form, HSP73 (known as 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein, HSC70) (3Itoh H. Tashima Y. Int. J. Biochem. 1991; 23: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). HSP73 consists of two domains, a highly conserved NH2-terminal ATPase domain, with a molecular mass of 45 kDa and a COOH-terminal domain of 25 kDa (5Chappell T.G. Konforti B.B. Schmid S.L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 746-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKey D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). An 18-kDa protein of the COOH-terminal adjacent to the ATPase domain contains the polypeptide-binding site (7Wang T.-F.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6261-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The ATP-bound form of HSP70 binds and releases peptide rapidly, whereas the ADP form binds peptide slowly but more stably (9Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2967-2973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Binding ATP to the ATP-binding domain causes a conformational change, which in turn results in structural alterations in the COOH-terminal domain, thus leading to substrate release (11Palleros D.R.

HSP70s and their partner proteins can stabilize newly synthesized polypeptides until all segments of the chain necessary for folding are available.We have reported previously that the induction of HSP73 in injured tubular epithelial rat kidneys with gentamicin (GM)-induced acute renal failure (14Komatsuda A. Wakui H. Satoh K. Yasuda T. Imai H. Nakamoto Y. Miura A.B. Itoh H. Tashima Y. Lab. Invest. 1993; 68: 687-695PubMed Google Scholar). GM is widely used as a bacte-ricidal agent for the treatment of severe Gram-negative infections; however, its clinical use is partially limited because of its nephrotoxicity. Recent evidence suggests a role of reactive oxygen metabolites in GM nephropathy (15Walker P.D. Barri Y. Shah S.V. Ren. Fail. 1999; 21: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). There are many reports about the clinical effects of GM, but no reports have been made for GM-specific binding proteins. In the present study, we investigated binding proteins to GM using GM-affinity column chromatography and identified a protein with a molecular mass of 73 kDa. We will discuss its physiological meanings and its possible functions, especially in kidneys with GM-induced acute tubular injury.MATERIALS AND METHODSGM-affinity Column Chromatography—GM-Sepharose was prepared using GM (Sigma) and CH-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bovine HSP73 (ATP- or ADP-bound form) was prepared from brain using ATP-Sepharose, as described previously; an anti-HSP73 antibody against bovine brain HSP73 was produced as described previously (16Itoh H. Tashima Y. Int. J. Biochem. 1991; 23: 69-77Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). An antibody against bovine HSP72 was produced as described previously (16Itoh H. Tashima Y. Int. J. Biochem. 1991; 23: 69-77Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Bovine HSP73 (ATP-free form) was purified from brain using an ammonium-sulfate fractionation, DEAE-Sepharose, and hydroxyapatite column chromatography. At each step, HSP73 was detected with immunoblotting by using an anti-HSP73. Porcine kidney cytosols in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) were applied to the column equilibrated with the same buffer and washed with 20 column volumes of the buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl. After washing the column extensively, binding proteins were eluted with 10 mm GM in the same buffer or with a linear gradient of GM (0-10 mm). The eluants were analyzed on SDS/9% PAGE (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205954) Google Scholar) or by immunoblotting (18Towbin H. Staephlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44702) Google Scholar) using an anti-HSP73 or -HSP72 antibody. The eluants and purified HSP73 were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (19O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed in the first-dimension on an isoelectric focusing gel with a pH gradient of 5-7. Electrophoresis for the second dimension was performed on a 7% acrylamide slab gel with SDS. After electrophoresis, gels were stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in a mixture of 25% isopropyl alcohol and 10% acetic acid; they were destained with 10% isopropyl alcohol and 10% acetic acid or by immunoblotting (18Towbin H. Staephlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44702) Google Scholar) using an anti-HSP73 or -HSP72 antibody and alkaline phosphatase anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Sigma). In this study, we used CH-activated Sepharose 4B as a control. TPCK-trypsin digested HSP73 (see below) was applied to the column, washed with the buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl, and eluted with a linear gradient of GM (0-5 mm in the buffer). The eluants were electrophoresed on SDS/9% PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.Far-UV Circular Dichroism (CD)—CD measurements were performed on a J-720 spectropolarimeter (Jusco) as described previously (20Itoh H. Ogura M. Komatsuda A. Wakui H. Miura A.B. Tashima Y. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 697-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 21Itoh H. Tashima Y. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) in the presence or absence of GM (1 mm) was used as a blank. Purified HSP73 (1.5 mm) in 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) in the presence or absence of GM (1 mm) was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter, and scans were carried out at 25 °C in the 240- and 200-nm regions in a cuvette with a 0.5-mm path length. The observed specific ellipticity (difference between sample and blank) was converted to the mean residue ellipticity θ (degrees/cm2/dmol).Measurement of Protein Aggregation—The influence of GM on the chaperone activity of HSP73 was monitored by using rhodanese. Rhodanese (Sigma) was denatured at a concentration of 100 μm in buffer containing 6 m guanidinium chloride (GdmCl), 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5. Denatured rhodanese was rapidly diluted to 0.5 μm in buffer containing 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, in the presence or absence of HSP73 (250 μm) and GM (500 μm). Aggregation of rhodanese was monitored over 10 min at A320 in an Amersham Biosciences Ultrospec 3000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer, and the data were normalized using the aggregation in buffer alone as the standard.GM-binding Sites of HSP73—Purified HSP73 (ATP-free form, 5 mg/ml) was mildly digested by 0.5 μg/ml TPCK-trypsin (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 60 min. The TPCK-trypsin digests were applied to a GM-Sepharose column and were eluted as described above. After detection of the eluants on SDS/12.5% PAGE, the 45-, 32-, and 29-kDa peptide bands were excised and digested using lysyl endopeptidase (Wako) as described previously (22Itoh H. Kobayashi R. wakui H. Komatsuda A. Ohtani H. Miura A.B. Otaka M. Masamune O. Andoh H. Koyama Y. Sato Y. Tashima Y. J. Biol.

The peptides were purified by the reverse-phase column (Wakosil 5C18), which was connected to an high performance liquid chromatography apparatus (Jasco PU-1580 pump and Amersham Biosciences 2158 Uvicord S.D. UV detector). Peptides were purified from the column with a linear gradient of 0-60% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected as described previously (22Itoh H. Kobayashi R. wakui H. Komatsuda A. Ohtani H. Miura A.B. Otaka M. Masamune O. Andoh H. Koyama Y. Sato Y. Tashima Y. J. Biol.

The amino acid sequence of the purified peptides was determined with a 491 Procise protein sequence system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Animal Model for Acute Gentamicin Nephropathy—The protocols for animal experimentation described here were approved by the Animal Research Committee, Akita University School of Medicine. All subsequent animal experiments adhered to the “Guidelines for Animal Experimentation” of the University. Essential protocols for gentamicin-induced acute renal failure have been described previously (14Komatsuda A. Wakui H. Satoh K. Yasuda T. Imai H. Nakamoto Y. Miura A.B. Itoh H. Tashima Y. Lab. Invest. 1993; 68: 687-695PubMed Google Scholar). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered intramuscular injections of gentamicin (80 mg/kg of body weight), and control rats were injected physiological saline once a day for 14 days. Kidneys from these rats were obtained at 0, 24, and 36 h, and days 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, and 27. Urine was collected from each rat at the above time points, and urinary volume and N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (NAG) levels were measured. Blood was also taken from the subclavian vein of each rat immediately after a urine collection at the above time points. Blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were measured.Renal immunohistochemical localization of HSP73 was serially examined. In addition, kidneys were homogenized with isotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were used as soluble fractions. The precipitates were washed with the same buffer for three times and the precipitates were resuspended with 8 m urea, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and used as insoluble fractions. HSP73 in both soluble and insoluble fractions was measured by immunoblot analysis (18Towbin H. Staephlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44702) Google Scholar).Electron Microscopic Immunohistochemistry—Electron microscopic immunohistochemistry of rat kidneys was performed as described previously (22Itoh H. Kobayashi R. wakui H. Komatsuda A. Ohtani H. Miura A.B. Otaka M. Masamune O. Andoh H. Koyama Y. Sato Y. Tashima Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13429-13435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, ultrathin sections of rat kidneys were cut with a diamond knife and mounted on gold grids. The sections were stained by the immunogold silver-staining method for electron microscopy, using a silver enhancing kit (BioCell Research Laboratories). These sections were incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody against GM (O.E.M. Concepts, Inc.) or rabbit polyclonal antibodies against HSP73 (200-fold dilution in buffer E: 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2% NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 18 h at room temperature. The sections were washed with buffer E and incubated with gold-labeled anti-rabbit IgG or gold-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Nanoprobes; 400-fold dilution in buffer E) for 1 h at room temperature. After further washing with distilled water, the sections were incubated with the silver developer of the enhancing kit for ∼10 min at room temperature. Sections were counter-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.RESULTSGM Affinity-column Chromatography—To avoid nonspecific binding proteins, GM-affinity columns were thoroughly washed with a buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl. Proteins were eluted with 10 mm GM from those affinity columns and the eluants were detected on SDS/PAGE or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). Although no protein bands were detected in the eluants from the control column (data not shown), protein bands with molecular masses of ∼70 kDa were detected in the eluant (Fig. 1A).In the present study, we used two different antibodies against HSP73 or HSP72. The purified bovine HSP73 was separated into two spots (73 and 72 kDa) on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1B, left). The amount of HSP73 was much greater than that of HSP72. The isoelectric points of HSP73 and HSP72 were 5.7 and 5.8, respectively. An antibody against HSP72 or HSP73 was cross-reacted to the purified HSP72 and HSP73, respectively (Fig. 1B, middle and right panels). These antibodies can recognize HSP72 and HSP73 with great sensitivity. Only one spot was detected in the eluants from GM-affinity column on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1C, left). No protein spots were detected in the eluants by immunoblotting with an anti-HSP72 antibody (Fig. 1C, middle). On the contrary, we did detect one spot in the eluants by immunoblotting with an anti-HSP73 antibody (Fig. 1C, right). The protein was identical to HSP73 by immunoblotting with an anti-HSP73 antibody (Fig. 1D). To confirm the results, we analyzed the elution pattern of HSP73 from the affinity column with a linear gradient of GM (Fig. 1E). With SDS/PAGE, we could find no other proteins except for HSP73 in the eluants at the given conditions. These results suggest that HSP73 is a direct target of the antibiotic gentamicin.Conformational Change in HSP73 upon Binding with GM—It has been reported that HSP73 has an average composition of 40% α-helix and 20% periodic structure within HSP73 and between 16-41% β-sheet and 21-0% β-turn (24Sadis S. Raghavendra K. Hightower L.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8199-8206Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Based on the available information, we analyzed whether GM may give rise to a conformational change (secondary structure) in HSP73 using a far-UV CD spectrum. As shown in Fig. 2A, our data (HSP73 alone) were in good agreement with the CD spectrum data of HSP73 (24Sadis S. Raghavendra K. Hightower L.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8199-8206Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The binding of GM to HSP73 resulted in the conformational changes in HSP73. By binding GM to HSP73, decreasing the mean residue ellipticity θ at or near 208 nm and increasing θ at or near 218 nm indicated the decreasing α-helix and increasing β-strand structure of HSP73, respectively, in the CD spectrum (Fig. 2A). These results indicate that the binding of GM to HSP73 is not a transient association and may cause a conformational change in the protein with a significant meaning.Fig. 2Effect of GM on the conformational changes and chaperone activity of HSP73. A, the CD spectrum of HSP73 was measured in the absence (○) or presence (•) of GM as described under “Materials and Methods.” θ denotes the mean residue ellipticity. B, time course of 0.5 μm rhodanese aggregation in buffer (▵), buffer containing 500 μm GM (○), buffer containing 250 μm HSP73 (□), and buffer containing 250 μm HSP73 and 500 μm GM (▪).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Measurement of Protein Aggregation—The chaperone activity of HSP73 can be detected by the ability of purified HSP73 to prevent aggregation of unfolded polypeptide substrate such as rhodanese (25Minami Y. Hohfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.-U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The protein has a pronounced tendency toward aggregation upon dilution of the denaturant GdmCl into the physiological buffer solution. In the present study, we analyzed the chaperone activity of HSP73 by using this system. HSP73 was capable of preventing the aggregation of rhodanese (Fig. 2B). The chaperone activity of HSP73 was reduced almost completely in the presence of a molar ratio of GM:HSP73 of 2:1. GM alone did not have an effect upon the aggregation of unfolded rhodanese. The results suggest that HSP73 has chaperone activity against unfolded polypeptide, but the ability is reduced by GM.GM-binding Sites of HSP73—If the GM-binding site is the same as the ATP-binding domain of HSP73, GM will be unable to bind to the ATP-bound form of HSP73. For these reasons, we used the ATP-free form of HSP73 in this study. As shown in Fig. 3A, HSP73 was mildly digested by TPCK-trypsin. Digests with molecular masses of 45-, 32-, and 29-kDa were applied to the GM-affinity column and eluted with a linear gradient of GM (0-5 mm). Interestingly, the 45-kDa fragment was unable to bind to the column, and the 29-kDa peptide was detected in the eluant at the end of the linear gradient of GM (5 mm) to some extent. In these peptides, the 29-kDa peptide had the highest affinity to GM compared with the others. To analyze the amino acid sequence of the TPCK-trypsin digests, the 45-, 32-, and 29-kDa peptides were excised from gel and digested by lysyl endopeptidase. Three peptides of the 45-kDa fragment were separated and sequenced. As shown in Fig. 3B, the 45-kDa fragment was NH2-terminal of HSP73, which is known to be an ATP-binding domain. One peptide of the 32-kDa fragment and two peptides of the 29-kDa fragment were located in the COOH-terminal of HSP73. As mentioned above, the 29-kDa fragment, rather than the other two fragments, was eluted later in a linear gradient of GM. These results suggest that GM binds to the COOH-terminal one-third of HSP73. The linear structure of rat HSP73 is shown in Fig. 3C.Fig. 3GM binding sites of HSP73. A, HSP73 was digested by TPCK-trypsin, and the digests were applied to the GM-affinity column and eluted with a linear gradient of GM (0-5 mm). The eluants were electrophoresed on SDS/12% PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. In panel A, S, P, and M denote applied sample, pass-through fraction, and molecular standard proteins, respectively. The 45-, 32-, and 29-kDa fragment bands were excised from the gel and digested with lysyl endopeptidase; digested peptides were separated by reverse-phase column chromatography, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The purified peptides were sequenced by a peptide sequencer. B, the three fragments (45, 32, and 29 kDa) were sequenced and compared with human HSP73 (31Dworniczak B. Mirault M.E.

The urinary volume in GM-treated rats began to increase on day 6, reached a peak level on day 15, and decreased on day 21. Urinary NAG levels also increased on day 6, reached a peak level on day 12, and decreased on day 15.

HSP73 in soluble fraction slightly increased at day 9 (Fig. 5B). On the contrary, significantly increased HSP73 was detected in insoluble fractions from the diseased kidneys from 36 h to day 15 (Fig. 5B). We have reported previously that the proximal tubular HSP73-containing granules appeared at the same times (from 36 h to day 15) (14Komatsuda A. Wakui H. Satoh K. Yasuda T. Imai H. Nakamoto Y.

Electron microscopic immunohistochemistry showed that HSP73 was more expressed in the cytoplasm and nucleus in normal rat kidney (Fig. 6E), as shown previously (26Komatsuda A. Wakui H. Ohtani H. Miura A.B. Itoh H. Tashima Y. Nephrology. 1997; 3: 413-419Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In GM-treated rat kidneys, the nuclear expression of HSP73 was not observed, and GM and HSP73 both accumulated in the swollen lysosomes of the injured proximal tubular epithelial cells on day 3 (Fig. 6, B and F). The number and size of these accumulated granules increased on day 6 (Fig. 6, C and G). On day 18, the number and size of these granules decreased (Fig. 6, D and H). HSP73 was essentially localized in enlarged lysosomes of GM-treated rat kidneys and could not be detected in the nucleus and cytoplasm. The localization of HSP73 coincided with GM in the GM-treated rat kidneys. These results suggest that GM binds to HSP73 not only in vitro but also in vivo.Fig. 6Alterations of immunohistochemical localizations of GM and HSP73 in proximal tubular epithelial cells in gentamicin-treated rat kidneys on electron microscopy.

Protozoal parasites such as Cryptosporidium hominis, Plasmodium falciparum, Toxoplasma gondii, and Leishmania major are unusual in that their thymidylate synthase (TS) 1The abbreviations used are: TS, thymidine synthase; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; dTMP, 2′-deoxythymidylate; CH2H folate, methylene tetrahydrofolate; H2 folate, dihydrofolate; H4 folate, tetrahydrofolate; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PDDF, 10-propargyl 1-5,8-dideazafolate. 1The abbreviations used are: TS, thymidine synthase; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; dTMP, 2′-deoxythymidylate; CH2H folate, methylene tetrahydrofolate; H2 folate, dihydrofolate; H4 folate, tetrahydrofolate; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PDDF, 10-propargyl 1-5,8-dideazafolate. and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) enzymes exist on the same polypeptide as part of a single bifunctional TS-DHFR enzyme. 2TS-DHFR is a functional designation as dihydrofolate is produced at TS and used at DHFR. Elsewhere the bifunctional enzyme is referred to as DHFR-TS because DHFR resides at the N-terminal portion of the bifunctional enzyme. 2TS-DHFR is a functional designation as dihydrofolate is produced at TS and used at DHFR. Elsewhere the bifunctional enzyme is referred to as DHFR-TS because DHFR resides at the N-terminal portion of the bifunctional enzyme. TS and DHFR are critical enzymes and established drug targets. TS represents the only means of de novo synthesis of 2′-deoxythymidylate (dTMP) for DNA synthesis, via reductive methylation of 2-deoxyuridate (dUMP) with methylene tetrahydrofolate (CH2H4folate), producing dihydrofolate (H2folate) in the process. DHFR catalyzes the reduction of H2folate by NADPH to generate tetrahydrofolate (H4folate), used for one carbon unit transfer reactions in several biochemical processes, including thymidylate, purine, and amino acid biosynthesis.Almost a decade of research on bifunctional TS-DHFR from protozoal parasites has relied on the only available TS-DHFR crystal structure, that from the kinetoplastid protozoa L. major (1Knighton D.R. Kan C.C. Howland E. Janson C.A. Hostomska Z. Welsh K.M. Matthews D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 186-194Google Scholar). The recent solution of the crystal structures of TS-DHFR enzymes from two clinically relevant apicomplexan protozoa, P. falciparum and C. hominis, however, has revealed unanticipated deviations from the kinetoplastid model (2Yuvaniyama J. Chitnumsub P. Kamchonwongpaisan S. Vanichtanankul J. Sirawaraporn W. Taylor P. Walkinshaw M.D. Yuthavong Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 357-365Google Scholar, 3O'Neil R.H. Lilien R.H. Donald B.R. Stroud R.M. Anderson A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52980-52987Google Scholar). An obvious next question is whether these significant structural differences translate as significant mechanistic differences between parasite classes. We sought to address this question through a detailed kinetic characterization of TS-DHFR from C. hominis, again yielding surprising results.A major conclusion of the recent solution of the apicomplexan TS-DHFR structures is that there exist two families of bifunctional TS-DHFR structures: a short linker family with an N-terminal tail, as in the kinetoplastids (a class that includes Leishmania and the trypanosomes); and a long linker family with a donated or crossover helix, as in the apicomplexan parasites (which include P. falciparum, C. hominis, and T. gondii) (3O'Neil R.H. Lilien R.H. Donald B.R. Stroud R.M. Anderson A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52980-52987Google Scholar). Leishmania major TS-DHFR contains only 2 junctional amino acids between the TS and DHFR domains (short linker) and has a 22-amino acid N-terminal tail that extends from DHFR and wraps the TS domain. By contrast, the apicomplexan protozoa have extensive linker regions but lack an N-terminal tail that contacts TS. The junctional region between the TS and DHFR domains is 89 amino acids in P. falciparum, 58 amino acids in C. hominis, and 72 amino acids in T. gondii. TS exists as a dimeric enzyme: in the apicomplexan protozoa the junctional region makes extensive contacts with the DHFR domain of the opposite half of the TS-DHFR dimer, bringing the two DHFR domains closer together.Are these large structural differences correlated with mechanistic or functional differences? To address this question we have applied a transient kinetic approach to the study of TS-DHFR from C. hominis. Transient kinetic analysis is invaluable for mechanistic studies because this technique enables direct monitoring of chemical catalysis at each active site and measurement of individual steps in a kinetic pathway. Transient kinetics also allows one to define the reaction kinetics of intermediate formation as well as to monitor transit of an intermediate from one active site to the other. We focused our efforts in three areas: determination of the C. hominis TS-DHFR kinetic mechanism, substrate channeling, and communication between the TS and DHFR domains.TS is more highly conserved than DHFR. When the C. hominis TS-DHFR nucleic acid sequence was ascertained, it was noted that there exist unique residues in the DHFR domain analogous to mutations conferring resistance to anti-folate therapies in other species. It was postulated that these intrinsic differences may explain why C. hominis is refractory to the anti-folate drugs that are standard therapy for other apicomplexan infections. In the case of the TS domain, a change in a single conserved residue of unknown significance was mentioned (4Vasquez J.R. Gooze L. Kim K. Gut J. Petersen C. Nelson R.G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 153-165Google Scholar). The C. hominis crystal structure revealed a 9-stranded rather than the usual 8-stranded β sheet in the DHFR domain, and a TS domain strongly resembling that from most eukaryotes (3O'Neil R.H. Lilien R.H. Donald B.R. Stroud R.M. Anderson A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52980-52987Google Scholar). These findings, combined with the fact that we had previously observed mechanistic differences between T. gondii and L. major DHFR but not TS (5Johnson E.F. Hinz W. Atreya C.E. Maley F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43126-43136Google Scholar), led us to speculate that unique features in the C. hominis mechanism would most likely involve the DHFR domain.Our second objective was to explore the possibility of substrate channeling. An attractive hypothesis to explain the advantage of a having a bifunctional TS-DHFR enzyme is that H2folate produced at TS is directly channeled to the DHFR active site, without equilibration in bulk solution (1Knighton D.R. Kan C.C. Howland E. Janson C.A. Hostomska Z. Welsh K.M. Matthews D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 186-194Google Scholar, 6Stroud R.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 131-134Google Scholar). Indeed, there is evidence for substrate channeling with both L. major and T. gondii TS-DHFR. In the case of these bifunctional enzymes, unlike with the combination of monofunctional TS + DHFR, H2folate produced at the TS active site does not substantially accumulate in solution and there is no lag in product formation at DHFR, suggesting that the TS product does not leave the protein and enter bulk solution before binding at DHFR (5Johnson E.F. Hinz W. Atreya C.E. Maley F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43126-43136Google Scholar, 7Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12195-12205Google Scholar, 8Atreya C.E. Johnson E.F. Williamson J. Chang S-Y. Liang P-H. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 28901-28911Google Scholar). Steady-state spectroscopic analysis, used to detect the presence or absence of a lag in NADP+ production via the DHFR-catalyzed reduction of H2folate formed at TS, also supports substrate channeling by both L. major and T. gondii TS-DHFR (9Meek T.D. Garvey E.P. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 678-686Google Scholar, 10Trujillo M. Donald R.G. Roos D.S. Greene P.J. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6366-6374Google Scholar).In the case of L. major TS-DHFR, the crystal structure lends itself to the possibility of substrate channeling: there is a path of solvent-exposed basic residues between the TS and DHFR active sites. It was proposed that these residues compose a 40-Å “electrostatic highway” for directional substrate channeling of negatively charged H2folate (1Knighton D.R. Kan C.C. Howland E. Janson C.A. Hostomska Z. Welsh K.M. Matthews D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 186-194Google Scholar, 6Stroud R.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 131-134Google Scholar). Conversely, basic residues are relatively scattered over the P. falciparum and C. hominis TS-DHFR protein surfaces making electrostatic channeling improbable. Furthermore, the TS active site of one-half of the apicomplexa dimer is orthogonal to the DHFR active site of the same peptide chain, making an alternate, dynamic channeling hypothesis, whereby a conformational change brings the active sites in closer proximity (6Stroud R.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 131-134Google Scholar), less feasible. We sought to determine whether or not there was mechanistic evidence for substrate channeling by C. hominis TS-DHFR.Finally, the most striking differences between the L. major and apicomplexa structures exist in non-active site regions: the N-terminal tail in the case of L. major, and the long-linker region in the case of the new structures. Do these structural differences in non-active site regions result in differences in domain-domain communication, or conformational changes induced by ligand binding at one active site that affect activity at the other active site of the bifunctional enzyme? There is evidence with L. major TS-DHFR for domain-domain communication: unlike T. gondii DHFR where activity is maximal even when TS is in an unliganded state (5Johnson E.F. Hinz W. Atreya C.E. Maley F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43126-43136Google Scholar), with L. major, formation of a dUMP-CH2H4folate-enzyme ternary complex at TS accelerates the DHFR rate 20-fold (7Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12195-12205Google Scholar). There is further evidence of reciprocal communication in L. major in that an additional conformational change at TS occurs in the presence of the DHFR ligand, NADPH. Moreover, addition of the DHFR folate inhibitor, methotrexate, results in a 4-fold slower L. major TS single enzyme turnover rate (7Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12195-12205Google Scholar). Complementary ligand-binding studies, reported here, have been conducted with C. hominis and T. gondii TS-DHFR to probe communication between domains.Morbidity and mortality because of apicomplexan protozoa is of increasing significance. In the United States, C. hominis and T. gondii have become particularly problematic in the era of AIDS, anticancer chemotherapy, and organ transplantation (11Luft B.J. Remington J.S. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1992; 15: 211-222Google Scholar, 12Ferreira M.S. Borges A.S. Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz. 2002; 97: 443-457Google Scholar). No effective treatments currently exist for cryptosporidiosis, caused by C. hominis infection and producing chronic diarrhea (often lasting >4 months) and the wasting disease of AIDS (13Tzipori S. Adv. Parasitol. 1998; 40: 187-221Google Scholar, 14Guerrant R. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 1997; 3: 51-57Google Scholar, 15Current W. Reese N. Ernst J. Bailey W. Heyman M. Weinstein W. New Engl. J. Med. 1983; : 1252-1257Google Scholar). Thus there is an urgent need for new drugs to treat apicomplexan infections, as well as for the identification of new chemotherapeutic targets. Detailed mechanistic and structure-function analysis represent an important step toward the rational design of novel therapies.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals and Reagents—All buffers and other reagents employed were of the highest chemical purity. Millipore ultrapure water was used for all solutions. CH2H4folate and H2folate were purchased from Schircks Laboratories (Switzerland). H4folate was synthesized by reduction of folic acid with sodium borohydride. Tritium-labeled H2folate and CH2H4folate were synthesized as previously described using tritiated folic acid as a starting material (5Johnson E.F. Hinz W. Atreya C.E. Maley F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43126-43136Google Scholar, 16Blakley R.L. Nature. 1960; 188: 231-232Google Scholar). The [3′,5′,7,9-3H]folic acid, as well as 14C-labeled dUMP and FdUMP (5-fluorodeoxyuridine-5′-monophosphate, [2-14C]), were obtained from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). NADPH, dUMP, methotrexate, and trimethoprim were purchased from Sigma; the concentration of NADPH was determined by using a molar extinction coefficient of 6220 m–1 cm–1 at 340 nm.Protein Expression and Purification—C. hominis TS-DHFR was purified from a single colony of pTrc99A-rHCp (the “genotype 1” TS-DHFR gene derived from a human parasite isolate) in Escherichia coli strain PA414 (dhfr–) on an LB ampicillin/kanamycin Petri plate kindly provided by Dr. Richard G. Nelson and Dr. Amy C. Anderson. The T. gondii TS-DHFR coding sequence in a PET15b expression vector was a generous gift of Dr. David S. Roos. These clones were used to obtain protein of high purity by previously described methods for purification (7Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12195-12205Google Scholar, 17Grumont R. Sirawaraporn W. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3776-3784Google Scholar). The protein was further purified using an Amersham Biosciences Superdex 75 Highload (26/60) gel filtration column to remove residual H2folate. The purified C. hominis enzyme contains negligible H2folate and ∼5% of DHFR active sites have NADPH bound.Determination of Enzyme Concentration and Activity Assays—The TS-DHFR protein concentration was estimated spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 78,800 m–1 cm–1 for T. gondii and 80,722 m–1 cm–1 for C. hominis. The DHFR activity was determined by following the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm that accompanies the conversion of substrates NADPH and H2folate to products NADP+ and H4folate as described previously. The TS activity was monitored by following the increase in absorbance at 340 nm that accompanies the conversion of substrates dUMP and CH2H4folate to dTMP and H2folate (18Schlichting I. Yang X-J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 26591-26593Google Scholar).Rapid Chemical Quench Experiments—The rapid quench experiments were performed using a Kintek RFQ-3 Rapid Chemical Quench Apparatus (Kintek Instruments, Austin, TX). The single enzyme turnover reaction was initiated by mixing the 15 μl of enzyme solution (enzyme + 2× reaction buffer: 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8) with the tritiated substrates (15 μl, approximately 20,000 dpm); in all cases, concentrations of enzyme and substrates cited in the text are those after mixing. The TS-DHFR single enzyme turnover reaction was monitored by addition of tritiated CH2H4folate to enzyme + NADPH and dUMP. The DHFR reaction was monitored by addition of tritiated H2folate to enzyme + NADPH. The TS reaction was also monitored under burst conditions: 7.5 μm enzyme + 250 μm CH2H4folate mixed with 90 μm [14C]dUMP. The enzymatic reactions were terminated by quenching with 67 μl of 0.78 n KOH to give a final concentration of 0.54 n KOH (7Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12195-12205Google Scholar). TS reactions utilizing radiolabeled dUMP were quenched with 67 μl of 0.4 n HCl. The rate constants for individual single-turnover rapid chemical or burst quench experiments were estimated by fitting the data to a single exponential or burst curve using the curve fitting program, Kaleidagraph.High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Analysis—Tritiated products of the rapid quench experiments were quantified by HPLC in combination with a radioactivity flow detector as detailed previously (8Atreya C.E. Johnson E.F. Williamson J. Chang S-Y. Liang P-H. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 28901-28911Google Scholar). The HPLC separation was performed using a BDS-Hypersil C18 reverse phase column (250 × 4.6 mm, Keystone Scientific, Bellefonte, PA) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. An isocratic separation using a solvent system of 10% methanol in 180 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate at pH 8.0 was employed. The elution times were as follows: H4folate, 9 min; H2folate, 18 min; CH2H4folate, 20 min. For separation of dUMP and dTMP, an isocratic separation using a solvent system of 200 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate was used. The elution times were as follows: dUMP, 11 min; dTMP 21.5 min.Stopped-flow Absorbance/Fluorescence Measurements—Stopped-flow measurements were performed using a Kintek SF-2001 apparatus (Kintek Instruments, Austin, TX) as detailed previously (7Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12195-12205Google Scholar). In the absorbance experiments designed to measure the burst in CH2H4folate consumption in the TS reaction, absorbance at 340 nm was monitored when 25 μm enzyme was preincubated with 1 mm dUMP and buffer (1 mm EDTA, 50 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris, at pH 7.8) and then mixed with 500 μm CH2H4folate. For TS, the protein conformational change upon substrate binding was followed by setting the monochrometer to 287 nm on the input and monitoring the change in intrinsic enzyme fluorescence with an output filter at 340 nm (7.5 μm enzyme was preincubated with 100 μm FdUMP and buffer and then mixed with 50 μm CH2H4folate). For DHFR, coenzyme fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments were carried out with 290 nm excitation and an output filter at 450 nm. In DHFR burst experiments, 7.5 μm enzyme was preincubated with 50 μm H2folate and buffer and then mixed with 500 μm NADPH. In single enzyme turnover experiments, 50 μm enzyme was preincubated with 500 μm NADPH and buffer and then mixed with 10 μm H2folate. The data were collected over a given time interval using a PC and software provided by Kintek Instruments. An average of 4–7 runs was used for data analysis: rate constants were obtained by fitting the data to a single or double exponential by nonlinear regression analysis.In the fluorescence experiments designed to measure dissociation rate constants, the trapping ligand (L2) was used at a concentration of ≥5-fold excess over that of L1 to allow for analysis as a pseudo-first order rate constant. Fluorescence changes were monitored following excitation at 287 nm and emission at 340 nm. In experiments involving enzyme and PDDF, however, the monochromator was set at 287 nm on the input and the fluorescence resonance energy transfer was monitored with an interference filter at 380 nm to determine kon, and a 340 nm cut-off filter to measure koff. The data were collected over a given time interval using a PC and software provided by Kintek Instruments. In most cases an average of four runs were used for data analysis: rate constants were obtained by fitting the data to a single or double exponential by nonlinear regression analysis.Kinetic Simulation—The KinTekSim kinetic simulation program (version 3.0.3) was used to model kinetic data presented here (7Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12195-12205Google Scholar, 19Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Google Scholar). As a starting point, C. hominis rate constants measured in this study were substituted into the minimal kinetic mechanism derived for T. gondii TS-DHFR (5Johnson E.F. Hinz W. Atreya C.E. Maley F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43126-43136Google Scholar). The resulting model and estimated rate constants are delineated in Chart 1.Steady-State Spectroscopic Channeling Assays—The steady-state TS-DHFR reaction was monitored spectroscopically for a lag in NADP+ formation at DHFR using a procedure detailed previously (8Atreya C.E. Johnson E.F. Williamson J. Chang S-Y. Liang P-H. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 28901-28911Google Scholar, 9Meek T.D. Garvey E.P. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 678-686Google Scholar). The predicted change in absorbance is very small, therefore a 10-cm path length quartz observation cell was used to enhance sensitivity. The assay mixture (25 ml) containing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm formaldehyde, 75 mm β-mercaptoethanol), 10.8 nm C. hominis TS-DHFR, and 28 μm CH2H4folate was incubated with 20 μm NADPH until the A340 stabilized, indicating enzymatic consumption of endogenous traces of H2folate. The reaction was then initiated with 100 μm dUMP (final concentration), and the decrease in NADPH absorbance at 340 nm was monitored in the absence of added H2folate. Experiments were performed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda 2 UV-visible Spectrophotometer and running PECSS (PerkinElmer Computerized Spectroscopy Software), version 4.0.RESULTSTransient Kinetic Analysis to Assess TS, DHFR, and TS-DHFR ActivityThe C. hominis TS and DHFR steady-state rates were found to be 2.4 and 2.3 s–1, respectively, in a spectroscopic activity assay (340 nm). Because the specific activity of DHFR is typically significantly higher than that of TS, steady-state kinetics provided the first clue that C. hominis TS-DHFR is unusual. We followed up this initial steady-state experiment with a thorough transient kinetic analysis, including both single enzyme turnover and pre-steady-state burst conditions.Single enzyme turnover experiments, which measure the rate of chemical conversion of substrate to product at the active site under conditions where enzyme concentration is sufficiently high that substrate binding is not rate-limiting, were performed using a rapid chemical quench apparatus. To monitor the TS reaction, the bifunctional enzyme (78 μm) was preincubated with a saturating concentration of dUMP (500 μm) and then mixed with a limiting amount of radiolabeled CH2H4folate (11 μm). All reported concentrations are final, after mixing. C. hominis TS was found to be remarkably fast: 45 s–1 (data not shown). The TS single enzyme turnover rate is typically significantly slower than that of DHFR, so the TS rate limits and is equivalent to that of TS-DHFR: it was confirmed that the rate of CH2H4folate consumption in the TS-DHFR reaction is also 45 s–1 (Fig. 1A).Fig. 1C. hominis TS-DHFR single turnover reaction time courses. C. hominis TS-DHFR reaction: CH2H folate, ▪; H2 folate + intermediate, ▴; H4folate, •. A, when 78 μm bifunctional enzyme is reacted with 13 μm tritiated CH2H4folate, the rate of CH2H4 consumption is 45 H folate s–1 and maximum accumulation of H2folate is 65% of tritiated product. B, magnification of early time points from A reveals that H2 folate + intermediate accumulates before there is significant conversion to H2 folate. H4folate production is fit to two curves: top curve is the single exponential fit from A, but points fit better to a slow followed by a fast phase (heavy line). C, KinTekSim model of the C. hominis TS-DHFR single enzyme turnover reaction superimposed on Rapid Chemical Quench data. H2folate and the TS intermediate are plotted together to simulate the experimental data, but are modeled separately in the inset (same axis labels implied).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The C. hominis DHFR reaction was monitored by stopped-flow fluorescence and rapid chemical quench under similar conditions. Like with T. gondii but not L. major, DHFR appears to be in an “activated” state even in the absence of TS ligands: the DHFR rate for C. hominis was found to be 130 s–1 (Supplemental Materials Fig. 1A).To monitor the TS-DHFR reaction, the bifunctional enzyme (45–78 μm) was preincubated with saturating concentrations of dUMP (500 μm) and NADPH (500 μm) and then mixed with a limiting amount of radiolabeled CH2H4folate (11–13.5 μm). As mentioned above, the rate of CH2H4folate consumption was found to be 45 s–1 (Fig. 1A). The TS-DHFR reaction also provided HPLC evidence for a TS intermediate and a large accumulation of H2folate, further discussed in subsequent sections. Even at 1 min, 13% of radioactivity was contained in a peak corresponding to H2folate. In a side-by-side experiment, using the same CH2H4folate substrate, 0–4% of radiolabel corresponded to H2folate after a 1-min TS-DHFR reaction using the T. gondii enzyme. No H2folate was present in the no enzyme control.Stopped-flow and rapid chemical quench experiments were also performed under pre-steady-state burst conditions (substrate in slight excess over enzyme). Similar to the other bifunctional enzymes studied, a DHFR burst was visualized by stopped-flow fluorescence (Supplemental Materials Fig. 1B). Results of burst experiments aimed at elucidating the C. hominis TS mechanism are reported in the next section.Further Analysis of C. hominis TS ActivityDetermination of the Rate-limiting Step in the TS Reaction— Under pre-steady-state burst conditions, where C. hominis TS-DHFR (45 μm) was preincubated with excess [14C]dUMP (200 μm) prior to mixing with a large excess of CH2H4folate (1 mm), no burst was observed (Fig. 2A). The absence of a burst in dTMP formation is consistent with chemistry being overall rate-limiting at TS.Fig. 2TS pre-steady-state burst experiments: no burst in dTMP formation or CH2H4 folate consumption was observed. A, rapid chemical quench TS burst experiment where C. hominis TS-DHFR (25 μm) is preincubated with excess [14C]dUMP (90 μm) prior to mixing with a large excess of CH2H4 folate (250 μm). B, stopped-flow absorbance at 340 nm monitored when C. hominis TS-DHFR (25 μm) is preincubated with a large excess of dUMP (1 mm) and then mixed with CH2H4folate (500 μm). Representative traces for several conditions were tested.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Presence of a TS Intermediate—C. hominis TS-DHFR is surprising in that the TS activity is very fast and there is a large accumulation of H2folate (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, HPLC analysis of TS and TS-DHFR rapid chemical quench samples yielded clear evidence of a TS intermediate (Fig. 3). The intermediate is present at very early time points; peaks at 22 ms, where it is fully separable from H2folate and represents 18% of radioactive material; and is no longer observable at 40 ms. H2folate is also present at very early time points, but peaks at 40–50 ms, where it represents 65% of tritiated material; leveling out by 200 ms (Fig. 1A). The intermediate peak, seen previously in T. gondii TS and TS-DHFR reactions (5Johnson E.F. Hinz W. Atreya C.E. Maley F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43126-43136Google Scholar) but not observed with L. major, was hypothesized to represent a breakdown product of the TS iminium ion intermediate, perhaps hydroxymethylene tetrahydrofolate (30Perry K.M. Carreras C.W. Chang L.C. Santi D.V. Stroud R.M. Biochem. 1993; 32: 7116-7125Google Scholar).Fig. 3HPLC analysis of C. hominis TS single enzyme turnover reaction: evidence for a TS intermediate. Radioactivity trace reveals the presence of a TS intermediate in a 22-ms rapid chemical quench time point (top). A H2folate standard was added to the sample and is visualized at 13 min in the UV trace (282 nm, middle). The lower panel shows a representative UV trace in the absence of added H2folate standard (buffer + quench solution only).

https://openalex.org/W1987510697,"The molecular basis of cone photoreceptor-specific gene expression is largely unknown. In this study, we define cis-acting DNA sequences that control the cell type-specific expression of the zebrafish UV cone pigment gene by transient expression of green fluorescent protein transgenes following their injection into zebrafish embryos. These experiments show that 4.8 kb of 5′-flanking sequences from the zebrafish UV pigment gene direct expression specifically to UV cones and that this activity requires both distal and proximal sequences. In addition, we demonstrate that a proximal region located between -215 and -110 bp (with respect to the initiator methionine codon) can function in the context of a zebrafish rhodopsin promotor to convert its specificity from rod-only expression to rod and UV cone expression. These experiments demonstrate the power of transient transgenesis in zebrafish to efficiently define cis-acting regulatory sequences in an intact vertebrate. The molecular basis of cone photoreceptor-specific gene expression is largely unknown. In this study, we define cis-acting DNA sequences that control the cell type-specific expression of the zebrafish UV cone pigment gene by transient expression of green fluorescent protein transgenes following their injection into zebrafish embryos. These experiments show that 4.8 kb of 5′-flanking sequences from the zebrafish UV pigment gene direct expression specifically to UV cones and that this activity requires both distal and proximal sequences. In addition, we demonstrate that a proximal region located between -215 and -110 bp (with respect to the initiator methionine codon) can function in the context of a zebrafish rhodopsin promotor to convert its specificity from rod-only expression to rod and UV cone expression. These experiments demonstrate the power of transient transgenesis in zebrafish to efficiently define cis-acting regulatory sequences in an intact vertebrate. The existence of separate rod and cone photoreceptors is a nearly universal feature of vertebrate retinas. Most present day vertebrates have multiple classes of cone photoreceptors, with peak sensitivities that can range from ∼350 to ∼600 nm. Comparison of excitation levels among the various cone classes provides the basis for color vision. A fundamental step in the evolution of color vision was the generation of distinct cone cell types that differentially express the corresponding cone pigment genes. The present work addresses the mechanism of this differential gene expression in the zebrafish Danio rerio. In zebrafish, the four cone types are morphologically distinct, and each expresses a single type of visual pigment (1Nawrocki L. BreMiller R. Streisinger G. Kaplan M. Vision Res. 1985; 25: 1569-1576Google Scholar, 2Raymond P.A. Barthel L.K. Rounsifer M.E. Sullivan S.A. Knight J.K. Neuron. 1993; 10: 1161-1174Google Scholar, 3Vihtelic T.S. Doro C.J. Hyde D.R. Visual Neurosci. 1999; 16: 571-585Google Scholar). Short single cones express UV pigment; long single cones express blue pigment; short double cones express green pigment; and long double cones express red pigment. In zebrafish, as in other teleosts, the cone and rod photoreceptors are arranged in a crystalline lattice in the plane of the retina (4Branchek T. Bremiller R. J. Comp. Neurol. 1984; 224: 107-115Google Scholar, 5Larison K.D. Bremiller R. Development. 1990; 109: 567-576Google Scholar, 6Raymond P.A. Barthel L.K. Curran G.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 359: 537-550Google Scholar, 7Fadool J.M. Dev. Biol. 2003; 258: 277-290Google Scholar). Zebrafish have become widely used in genetic research largely on the basis of the advantages they afford over mammals for embryological investigations. In particular, the combination of rapid development and near transparency facilitates analyses of organogenesis and patterning (8Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book: a Guide for the Laboratory Use of Zebrafish (Danio rerio).4th Ed. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR2000Google Scholar). A second experimental advantage of zebrafish is the ease with which embryos can be genetically manipulated by injection of DNA, RNA, or morpholino oligonucleotides (9Amsterdam A. Lin S. Hopkins N. Dev. Biol. 1995; 171: 123-129Google Scholar, 10Higashijima S. Okamoto H. Ueno N. Hotta Y. Eguchi G. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 289-299Google Scholar, 11Nasevicius A. Ekker S.C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 216-220Google Scholar, 12Wang X. Wan H. Korzh V. Gong Z. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 814-820Google Scholar). In the present work, we report an in vivo analysis of cis-acting DNA sequences that control expression of the zebrafish UV pigment in the appropriate photoreceptor type. These experiments take advantage of (a) the efficiency with which transiently transgenic fish can be generated by microinjection of plasmid DNA and (b) the rapid development of the zebrafish retina, in which all terminal cell fate decisions are complete within ∼3 days postfertilization (dpf 1The abbreviations used are: dpf, days postfertilization; hpf, hours postfertilization; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PFA, paraformaldehyde; PBS, phosphate buffered saline; MBP, maltose-binding protein. 1The abbreviations used are: dpf, days postfertilization; hpf, hours postfertilization; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PFA, paraformaldehyde; PBS, phosphate buffered saline; MBP, maltose-binding protein.; (13Schmitt E.A. Dowling J.E. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 404: 515-536Google Scholar)). The data reveal a requirement for both proximal and distal sequences 5′ of the UV pigment gene, and they further show that a small proximal sequence can mediate UV cone-specific expression in the context of the rhodopsin promotor. Zebrafish Genomic Clones—A commercial zebrafish genomic lambda phage library (Clontech) and a second lambda phage library prepared by partial digestion of zebrafish genomic DNA with Sau3AI were screened using probes derived from the cloned zebrafish visual pigment cDNAs (a kind gift of Drs. Thomas Vihtelic and David Hyde; (3Vihtelic T.S. Doro C.J. Hyde D.R. Visual Neurosci. 1999; 16: 571-585Google Scholar)). Multiple independent clones corresponding to SWS1, SWS2, LWS-1, and the RH2 gene cluster were isolated, restriction-mapped, and partially sequenced. One clone, encompassing ∼4.8 kb of 5′-flanking DNA from the UV pigment gene, was fully sequenced (GenBank™ accession number AY512505). A bacterial artificial chromosome clone encompassing the four RH2 genes was isolated and subject to shotgun sequencing (GenBank™ accession number AC133391). These analyses are in good agreement with those of Chinen et al. (14Chinen A. Hamoka T. Yamada Y. Kawamura S. Genetics. 2003; 163: 663-675Google Scholar) and Takechi et al. (15Takechi M. Hamaoka T. Kawamura S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 533: 90-94Google Scholar). Production of Anti-visual Pigment Antibodies—Based on sequence comparisons and the work of Vihtelic et al. (3Vihtelic T.S. Doro C.J. Hyde D.R. Visual Neurosci. 1999; 16: 571-585Google Scholar), the following regions from the indicated zebrafish visual pigment cDNA clones were chosen as immunogens for generating specific antibodies: amino acids 1-27 and 303-326 from the UV pigment; amino acids 1-41 and 307-347 from the blue pigment; amino acids 1-34 and 232-345 from the red (LWS-1) pigment; amino acids 310-337 from the green (RH2-1) pigment; and amino acids 310-348 from rhodopsin. Each region was amplified by PCR, expressed in Escherichia coli as a C-terminal fusion to glutathione S-transferase, purified by glutathione affinity chromatography, and used for immunization of rabbits. Antisera were tested for specificity by (a) immunoblotting at 1:10,000 dilution to a set of fusion proteins containing the same visual pigment segments joined to the E. coli maltose-binding protein (MBP) and (b) by immunostaining of adult zebrafish retinas. The anti-UV pigment N- and C-terminal and anti-blue pigment N-terminal antibodies were found to be specific for the corresponding pigment types. Monoclonal antibody 1D1, which recognizes a rhodopsin epitope was used to visualize rods (a kind gift of Dr. James Fadool (7Fadool J.M. Dev. Biol. 2003; 258: 277-290Google Scholar)). Construction of GFP Expression Vectors—The pBLuescript II (SK-) plasmid vector (Stratagene) was used as the backbone for all constructs. An enhanced GFP open reading frame and an SV40 3′-untranslated region were subcloned between EcoRI and Acc65I sites, and the UV pigment or rhodopsin 5′ regions were inserted immediately 5′ of the GFP initiator methionine codon. Serial deletions of the UV pigment 5′ region were made by digesting the expression plasmid at the unique NotI site 5′ of the insert and at the restriction enzyme sites indicated in Fig. 2. The ends were made blunt with Klenow or T4 DNA polymerase, and the DNA was cyclized. Deletion constructs in the -4615 to -4216 region were made either by (a) digesting the 4796 bp 5′ UV-GFP plasmid to completion with NotI and partially with BspHI and then reintroducing various deleted fragments generated by PCR or (b) by in vivo site-specific recombination as described by Yu et al. (16Yu D. Ellis H. Lee E. Jenkins N. Copeland N. Court D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5978-5983Google Scholar). The deletion constructs in the -450 to -100 region were made by digesting the 4796-bp 5′ UV pigment promotor-GFP plasmid with AatII and SalI and then reintroducing various deleted fragments generated by PCR. All regions manipulated by PCR or in vivo recombination were sequenced to rule out spurious mutations. Generation of Transgenic Zebrafish—Adult wild type zebrafish were purchased from Scientific Hatcheries and maintained at 28.5 °C in a 14-h light/10-h dark cycle. Embryos were collected and maintained under the same conditions. Covalently closed circular plasmid DNA was used to produce all transient transgenic zebrafish. The 10.5-kb UV pigment promoter construct was linearized with NotI and used to produce the stable transgenic line. For injection, plasmids were suspended in 0.1 m KCl at a final concentration of 50-100 ng/μl with 0.2% phenol red as a tracer. The DNA was injected into the cytoplasm of 1-2 cell embryos. The injected embryos were screened and transferred to water containing 0.003% 1-phenyl-2-thiourea (Sigma) 24 h postfertilization (hpf) to inhibit melanin production. The eyes of injected embryos were examined at 3-5 dpf for GFP fluorescence. Immunohistochemistry—To immunostain intact eyes, embryos showing GFP fluorescence were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 1-2 h; this and all subsequent incubations were performed at room temperature. The eyes were carefully removed under a dissecting microscope, treated with 20 μg/ml proteinase K for 10 min, post-fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min, and washed three times with PBS. The eyes were blocked for 1 h in PBS with 5% normal goat serum, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% Tween 20. Rabbit anti-UV opsin N-terminal antibody (1:10,000 final dilution) and mouse anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (monoclonal antibody; 1:200 final dilution, Molecular Probes) were added to the blocking buffer and incubated for 24 h. The eyes were washed 3 × 60 min in PBS, 1% Tween 20 (buffer A), incubated in buffer A with secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) for 24 h, washed in buffer A 3 × 60 min, and infiltrated sequentially with 50 and 75% glycerol. For viewing, the eyes were mounted with the lens facing away from the exciting light. To immunostain retina sections, adult zebrafish were anesthetized with 0.4% tricaine during the light cycle, and their eyes were dissected and fixed in 4% PFA for 2 h; this and all subsequent incubations were performed at room temperature unless otherwise noted. Eye cups were prepared by removing the cornea and lens, fixed in 4% PFA for an additional 1-2 h, embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound, frozen, and cut at a thickness of 10-20 μm. The sections were washed in PBS for 3 × 5 min, blocked for 1 h in PBS with 5% normal goat serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 (buffer B), and incubated in buffer B with primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. The sections were washed in PBS for 4 × 15 min, incubated with secondary antibody in PBS for 1 h, washed in PBS for 4 × 15 min, and mounted. Whole mount embryo eyes were analyzed by confocal microscopy (LSM510, Zeiss). Adult fish retinas were analyzed with an Axiophot microscope (Zeiss), and images were captured using Openlab 3.1.2 software (Zeiss). The full complement of zebrafish cone pigment sequences has been defined by analysis of retinal cDNAs and their corresponding genes (Refs. 3Vihtelic T.S. Doro C.J. Hyde D.R. Visual Neurosci. 1999; 16: 571-585Google Scholar and 14Chinen A. Hamoka T. Yamada Y. Kawamura S. Genetics. 2003; 163: 663-675Google Scholar and see also this study). As an initial step in identifying and analyzing zebrafish cone pigment promotors, we isolated multiple overlapping lambda and bacterial artificial chromosome genomic clones encompassing the zebrafish UV, blue, green, and red pigment genes. In agreement with the report of Chinen et al. (14Chinen A. Hamoka T. Yamada Y. Kawamura S. Genetics. 2003; 163: 663-675Google Scholar), we identified a single copy each of the UV pigment gene (SWS1) and the blue pigment gene (SWS2), one of the two highly homologous copies of the red pigment gene (LWS1-1), and four highly homologous copies of the green pigment gene (RH2-1, RH2-2, RH2-3, and RH2-4). To visualize different classes of retinal photoreceptors, rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against bacterial fusion proteins derived from the N terminus and/or from the C-terminal region of each of the major classes of zebrafish visual pigments. Among the resulting antisera, only those directed against the N termini of the UV and blue pigments appear to specifically recognize the pigment used for immunization, as determined by immunoblotting against visual pigment fusion proteins and by immunostaining of adult zebrafish retinas (Fig. 1A). In an initial survey to identify cis-acting regulatory sequences 5′ of the zebrafish cone pigment genes, transgenic fish were generated by injection with GFP reporter plasmids under the control of 10.5 or 4.8 kb 5′ of the UV pigment gene (SWS1), 5.2 kb 5′ of the blue pigment gene (SWS2), 10.5 kb 5′ of one of the green pigment genes (RH2-1), 8 kb 5′ of a second green pigment gene (RH2-3), or 4.5 kb 5′ of the red pigment gene (LWS-1). Among this group, only the two UV pigment promotor-GFP plasmids produced detectable GFP expression in the retina (see below). Expression of the UV pigment promotor-GFP transgenes was first observed at 3 dpf and reached a maximal level at 5 dpf. Expression was not observed outside the retina, and within the retina, expression was confined to photoreceptor cells. The analyses described in this study have therefore focused on the UV pigment gene 5′-flanking region. Fig. 1B shows the structure of the UV pigment gene as deduced from the analysis of four overlapping lambda phage clones, and Fig. 1C shows a partial sequence of the 5′-flanking DNA. Requirement for Distal Sequences 5′ of the UV Pigment Gene—The experiments described in this study involve the analysis of GFP expression between 5 and 7 dpf following injection of covalently closed circular DNA at the one or two cell stage. We will refer to this procedure as “transient transgenesis” by analogy with transient transfection of cultured cells and to distinguish it from the classic transgenesis approach, which requires screening for germline transmission of a stably integrated transgene. When live fish were examined under a dissecting microscope equipped with UV excitation and a GFP filter set, individual GFP-expressing photoreceptors were readily observed at 5 dpf. A simple rating system was devised to assess the number and intensity of the expressing cells (Fig. 2A). Eyes with greater than ∼50 fluorescent cells were rated +++, eyes with ∼5-50 fluorescent cells were rated ++, eyes with one or a few fluorescent cells were rated +, and eyes with no fluorescence were rated -. In general, those fish with larger numbers of fluorescent cells per eye also showed greater fluorescence intensity per cell. In the analyses that follow, expression efficiency for each construct has been quantitated by scoring multiple injected embryos and plotting the resulting data as a histogram. In interpreting these data, we have confined our attention to differences of ∼2-fold or greater, a value in excess of the random experimental variation observed for the sample sizes used here. As an initial step in defining sequence elements required for UV pigment expression, we constructed and analyzed a nested deletion series within the 5′-flanking region of the UV pigment gene. Fig. 2B shows the GFP expression level associated with each of nine constructs that form a deletion series from the 5′ end of the UV pigment gene 5′-flanking DNA. Constructs with 10.5, 4.796, or 4.620 kb of 5′-flanking sequence (numbered with respect to the initiator methionine codon) conferred high levels of GFP expression with ∼70% of surviving fish showing detectable photoreceptor expression. Further deletion of 5′ sequences between -4.620 and -3.835 kb dramatically reduced the number of GFP-expressing cells, and even further deletion to -2.692 kb led to expression in only a few photoreceptors in a small minority of the injected fish. 5′ sequences of 2.285 kb or less produced no detectable GFP expression. We will refer hereafter to the essential sequences located ∼4.5 kb upstream of the UV pigment coding region as the “distal region.” As noted above, these experiments involved injecting covalently closed circular DNA, and therefore, the decreased expression seen with progressively smaller 5′-flanking regions cannot be due to exonucleolytic degradation of sequences adjacent to a free DNA end. For each construct that conferred detectable photoreceptor expression, retinas from multiple fish were double-immunostained for GFP and the UV pigment. These analyses were generally conducted on whole mount retinas and viewed by confocal microscopy, a format that permits an assessment of colocalization across the entire retina. For each of the constructs described above, we observed GFP expression only in cells that were also stained with the anti-UV pigment antibody, as shown at low magnification for two retinas in Fig. 2, C and E. Higher magnification views of whole mount retinas and conventional frozen sections confirmed this conclusion and showed that GFP is predominantly in the cell body and the UV pigment is exclusively in the outer segment (Fig. 2D and data not shown). The same UV cone specificity and subcellular localization were also observed in two lines of zebrafish carrying a stably integrated transgene in which GFP is controlled by a 10.5-kb 5′ segment of the UV pigment gene (Fig. 2, F-H). Takechi et al. (15Takechi M. Hamaoka T. Kawamura S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 533: 90-94Google Scholar) have recently reported similar observations for a stably integrated transgene with a 5.5-kb 5′ segment from the zebrafish UV pigment gene. In transiently transgenic fish, GFP is observed in only a subset of UV cones, typically ∼55% of UV cones for those constructs with the highest expression levels. As compared with transiently transgenic fish, the stable fish lines exhibited a larger fraction of GFP-expressing UV cones: ∼100% of UV cones in the line shown in Fig. 2, F-H, and ∼70% of UV cones in a second stably transgenic line (data not shown). This variegation in transient transgene expression most likely reflects a combination of mosaicism for the plasmid DNA and epigenetic effects that repress expression in a subset of cells. Variegated expression is also commonly observed in mice carrying visual pigment transgenes (17Zack D.J. Bennett J. Wang Y. Davenport C. Klaunberg B. Gearhart J. Nathans J. Neuron. 1991; 6: 187-199Google Scholar, 18Chiu M.I. Nathans J. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3426-3436Google Scholar, 19Chiu M.I. Nathans J. Vis. Neurosci. 1994; 11: 773-780Google Scholar). To further define the role of the distal region, we tested additional 5′ deletions as well as a set of internal deletions within the -4.615- to -4.216-kb region (Fig. 3). The most interesting result of this analysis is the apparent redundancy of the distal element with sequences between -4.769 and -10.5 kb. Deleting 5′ sequences between -4.615 and -4.216 kb in the context of the 10.5-kb 5′ region had little or no effect on GFP expression, whereas the same deletion in the context of the -4.769-kb 5′ region dramatically decreased GFP expression. Although deletion of distal region sequences resulted in a marked decrease in the number of transgene-expressing cells per retina, UV cone specificity was unaffected (Fig. 3B). The experiments in Fig. 3A further indicate that the full activity of the distal region requires the presence of sequences distributed throughout the -4.615- to -4.216-kb interval since deletion of either half of this interval markedly impairs function. Requirement for Proximal Sequences 5′ of the UV Pigment Gene—The sequence of the promotor proximal region of the UV pigment gene reveals a presumptive TATA box 92 bp 5′ of the initiator methionine codon (Fig. 1C). To define transcriptional regulatory elements within this region, we tested deletions of sequences between -450 and -224, -201, -179, -155, or -101 bp (Fig. 4A). Deletions up to and including position -201 had little or no effect on GFP expression, but further deletion led to a progressive decrease in the efficiency GFP expression with a complete loss of GFP expression upon deletion of sequences between -450 and -101 bp. Consistent with this result, deletion of sequences between -201 and -109 bp completely eliminated GFP expression. Interestingly, deletion of sequences between -450 and either -179 or -155 produced a relaxation of photoreceptor specificity, with expression in both UV cones and at least one other photoreceptor type (Fig. 4C). By contrast, deletions that extend only to -224 or -201 retained UV cone specificity (Fig. 4B). To further explore the sequences relevant to UV cone-specific expression, the region from -100 to -1, which includes the TATA box, was replaced with the corresponding region from the blue pigment gene (Fig. 4A, fourth construct from bottom). This construct directed UV cone-specific expression, arguing against a cone subtype-specific function for sequences within this region. In examining the UV pigment 5′ proximal region between bp -201 and -101 for potential transcription factor binding sites, we were struck by the presence of two copies of the sequence CCTTTTCA between bp -135 and -110. Insertion of unique restriction sites at positions -135 and -110, flanking the two CCTTTTCA sequences, did not alter the efficiency or UV cone specificity of transgene expression (Fig. 4A, bottom construct). However, replacing the -135 to -110 region with a sequence of identical length but composed of the inserted restriction sites and a central region of irrelevant DNA significantly decreased the average number of GFP-expressing cells per retina, although it did not alter UV cone specificity (Fig. 4A, second from bottom construct). Taken together, the analyses of the proximal region suggest that sequences involved in both expression efficiency and UV cone specificity are located within the interval -201 to -109. UV Pigment Proximal Promotor Sequences Can Redirect the Specificity of the Rhodopsin Promotor—The experiments described above largely involve inferring function based on the effect of DNA deletions. However, the possibility that sequences responsible for high expression efficiency and for UV cone specificity might be intermingled, redundant, or overlapping complicates the interpretation of deletion analyses. To partially circumvent this problem and to specifically look for sequences that confer cell type specificity of expression, we asked whether sequences from the proximal region of the UV pigment gene could alter the specificity of a heterologous promotor. For this experiment, we have used a 1.8-kb segment from the zebrafish rhodopsin 5′ region as the heterologous promotor (Fig. 5, A and B). This segment directs rod-specific expression of a GFP reporter (Fig. 5, B and C) (see also Refs. 20Kennedy B.N. Vihtelic T.S. Checkley L. Vaughan K.T. Hyde D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14037-14043Google Scholar and 21Asaoka Y. Mano H. Kojima D. Fukada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15456-15461Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 5, C-E, and as described by Fadool (7Fadool J.M. Dev. Biol. 2003; 258: 277-290Google Scholar), at 5 dpf, the development of the rod mosaic is incomplete and still spatially heterogeneous. Fig. 5, B and D, shows that insertion in either orientation of the segment -215 to -110 of the UV pigment proximal region at position -139 in the zebrafish rhodopsin promotor alters the specificity of expression. Quantitation of photoreceptor specificity by double staining with antibodies directed against GFP and either rhodopsin or the UV pigment showed that expression is found at roughly equal frequency in rods and UV cones, although with wide variation among different retinas (Fig. 5B, right). Double staining with anti-blue pigment antibodies showed that transgene expression in blue cones is extremely rare. To determine the extent to which rods and UV cones together account for the GFP-expressing cells, retinas transgenic for the rhodopsin promotor carrying the -215- to -110-bp segment from the UV pigment promotor in reverse orientation were subject to double immunostaining for rods and UV cones while simultaneously monitoring intrinsic GFP fluorescence (Fig. 5, B and E). This analysis demonstrated that nearly 100% of transgene-expressing cells are either rods or UV cones. To control for the possibility that disruption of the rhodopsin promotor at position -139 might be the cause of transgene expression in UV cones, a 110-bp segment of the blue pigment gene promotor was inserted at the same location (Fig. 5A, bottom construct). Transgenic fish carrying the blue pigment promotor insertion expressed the transgene efficiently but showed little or no expression in UV cones, implying that insertion per se in the rhodopsin promotor at position -139 is not responsible for UV cone expression. The experiments reported here represent a first step in dissecting cone-specific transcriptional controlling elements in zebrafish. Using transient transgenesis, we have shown that 5′-flanking sequences from the zebrafish UV pigment gene direct expression specifically to UV cones, that this activity requires both distal and proximal sequences, and that at least one proximal element located within the interval -215 to -110 bp can function in the context of a rhodopsin promotor to convert its specificity from rod-only expression to rod and UV cone expression. The distal sequences characterized here are located within a several hundred bp region ∼4.5 kb 5′ of the UV pigment coding region, and they appear to be largely redundant with as yet uncharacterized sequences between -10.5 and -4.8 kb. The function of the distal sequences could be limited to the production of a promotor configuration that is generally permissive for transcription in a manner that is not cell type-specific since progressive deletion of the distal sequences leads to a progressive decrease in the efficiency of UV cone expression without a concomitant change in cell type specificity. However, we cannot rule out more complex models in which the distal sequences also carry cell type-specific information. By contrast, the partial loss of UV cone specificity attendant with deletion of sequences between -450 and -155 bp, together with the chimeric UV pigment/rhodopsin promotor experiments, clearly establish a small proximal region as a carrier of UV cone-specific information. In the chimeric UV/rhodopsin promotor experiments, the absence of expression in other cone types argues that the proximal region from the UV pigment gene carries information that specifically directs UV cone expression. Whether other sequences in the UV pigment promotor function to direct expression generically to cones remains an open question. The failure to observe transgene expression with large 5′-flanking segments derived from the zebrafish red, green, and blue pigment genes suggests that additional enhancer or enhancer-like sequences reside within introns or at a greater distance 5′ or 3′ of the coding regions of these genes. These observations are in contrast to those obtained with transgenes derived from the human red and blue pigment genes and the mouse UV pigment gene, in which cases the sequences required for cone-specific expression reside within a region several kb 5′ of the start site of transcription (18Chiu M.I. Nathans J. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3426-3436Google Scholar, 19Chiu M.I. Nathans J. Vis. Neurosci. 1994; 11: 773-780Google Scholar, 22Wang Y. Macke J.P. Merbs S.L. Zack D.J. Klaunberg B. Bennett J. Gearhart J. Nathans J. Neuron. 1992; 9: 429-440Google Scholar). Like the zebrafish UV pigment gene, the human red pigment gene requires both proximal and distal elements. At present, the most extensively studied vertebrate visual pigment promotor is that for rhodopsin. Multiple transcription factors (and their binding sites) have been defined, including the transcription factors Crx and NRL, both of which have been shown to be essential for normal photoreceptor development in mammals (23Chen S.

In Drosophila, multiple transcription factors and cis-acting controlling sequences have been defined for several visual pigment genes, and these have been shown in vivo to control the differential activation of visual pigment genes in the appropriate photoreceptor types (31Fortini M.E. Rubin G.M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 444-463Google Scholar, 32Tahayato A. Sonneville R. Pichaud F. Wernet M.F. Papatsenko D. Beaufils P. Cook T. Desplan C. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 391-402Google Scholar). Transient transgenesis in zebrafish has the potential to enormously accelerate the experimental analysis of vertebrate transcriptional regulatory sequences, as has recently been demonstrated for a pineal-specific transcriptional control element (21Asaoka Y. Mano H. Kojima D. Fukada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15456-15461Google Scholar). The ease and efficiency of plasmid injection into zebrafish embryos and the rapidity of zebrafish development allow expression analyses to be conducted with dozens of independent transgenic fish on a time scale of 1-2 weeks. Similarly rapid methods exist for creating both stably and transiently transgenic Xenopus tadpoles (33Kroll K.K. Amaya E. Development. 1996; 122: 3173-3183Google Scholar). The imminent completion of the zebrafish genome sequence together with this transgenesis methodology will greatly facilitate the definition of both cis-acting sequences and trans-acting factors for cone pigment gene expression in this organism.

https://openalex.org/W2003095660,"Abstract The endothelium is required for maintenance of vascular integrity and homeostasis during vascular development and in adulthood. However, little is known about the coordinated interplay between transcription factors and signaling molecules that regulate endothelial cell-dependent transcriptional events. Vascular endothelial zinc finger-1 (Vezf1) is a zinc finger-containing transcription factor that is specifically expressed within the endothelium during vascular development. We have previously shown that Vezf1 potently activates transcription of the endothelin-1 promoter. We now report the identification of p68RacGAP, a novel Vezf1-interacting 68-kDa RhoGAP domain-containing protein. p68RacGAP mRNA is highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells by Northern blot analysis, and immunohistochemical staining of adult mouse tissues identified p68RacGAP in endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and epithelial cells in vivo. Rac1 and Vezf1 both bind avidly to p68RacGAP, suggesting that p68RacGAP is not only a GTPase-activating protein for Rac1 but that p68RacGAP may also be part of the protein complex that binds to and modulates Vezf1 transcriptional activity. Functionally p68RacGAP specifically activates the GTPase activity of Rac1 in vivo but not Cdc42 or RhoA. In addition, p68RacGAP potently inhibits Vezf1/DB1-mediated transcriptional activation of the human endothelin-1 promoter and modulates endothelial cell capillary tube formation. Taken together, these data suggest that p68RacGAP is a multifunctional regulatory protein that has a Rac1-specific GTPase-activating activity, regulates transcriptional activity of the endothelin-1 promoter, and is involved in the signal transduction pathway that regulates endothelial cell capillary tube formation during angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2168886257,"Hyaluronan (HA) is a large linear polymer of repeating disaccharides of glucuronic acid and GlcNAc. Although HA is widely distributed in vertebrate animals, it has not been found in invertebrates, including insect species. Insects utilize chitin, a repeating β-1,4-linked homopolymer of GlcNAc, as a major component of their exoskeleton. Recent studies illustrate the similarities in the biosynthetic mechanisms of HA and chitin and suggest that HA synthase (HAS) and chitin synthase have evolved from a common ancestral molecule. Although the biochemical properties and in vivo functions of HAS proteins have been extensively studied, the molecular basis for HA biosynthesis is not completely understood. For example, it is currently not clear if proper chain elongation and secretion of HA require other components in addition to HAS. Here, we demonstrate that a non-HA-synthesizing animal, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, can produce HA in vivo when a single HAS protein is introduced. Expression of the mouse HAS2 gene in Drosophila tissues by the Gal4/UAS (upstream activating sequence) system resulted in massive HA accumulation in the extracellular space and caused various morphological defects. These morphological abnormalities were ascribed to disordered cell-cell communications due to accumulation of HA rather than disruption of heparan sulfate synthesis. We also show that adult wings with HA can hold a high level of water. These findings demonstrate that organisms synthesizing chitin (but not HA) are capable of producing HA that is structurally and functionally relevant to that in mammals. The ability of insect cells to produce HA supports the idea that in vivo HA biosynthesis does not require molecules other than the HAS protein. An alternative model is that Drosophila cells use endogenous components of the chitin biosynthetic machinery to produce and secrete HA.

An alternative model is that Drosophila cells use endogenous components of the chitin biosynthetic machinery to produce and secrete HA. Polysaccharides are used as major structural components of animal and plant bodies. In higher vertebrates, hyaluronan (HA), 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronan; GlcUA, glucuronic acid; HAS, hyaluronan synthase; UAS, upstream activating sequence; b-HABP, biotinylated HA-binding protein. 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronan; GlcUA, glucuronic acid; HAS, hyaluronan synthase; UAS, upstream activating sequence; b-HABP, biotinylated HA-binding protein. a high molecular mass glycosaminoglycan composed of repeating β-1,4-linked disaccharides of glucuronic acid (GlcUA) and β-1,3-linked GlcNAc, is found in the extracellular matrix in many tissues, including cartilage, synovial joint, and the vitreous of the eye (1Toole B.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 839-844Google Scholar). Despite wide distribution of HA in vertebrate animals, HA has not been found in invertebrates such as arthropod species. Instead of HA, crustaceans and arthropods produce chitin, a repeating β-1,4-linked homopolymer of GlcNAc, and deposit it in their exoskeleton. In addition, the plant cell wall is composed mainly of cellulose, β-1,4-glucan. These distinct types of polysaccharides share common important functions to determine and maintain the basic architecture of organisms, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role of the polysaccharides as major structural constituents of multicellular organisms. Consistent with this idea, the biosynthetic mechanisms of these molecules show some intriguing similarities. All enzymes that synthesize HA, chitin, and cellulose are integral plasma membrane proteins and have the invariant amino acid residues QXXRW in their catalytic domains (2Yoshida M. Itano N. Yamada Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 497-506Google Scholar). Interestingly, one of the HA synthases (HASs), mouse HAS1, is indeed capable of synthesizing chito-oligosaccharides in vitro when only UDP-GlcNAc is supplied as substrate in the system (2Yoshida M. Itano N. Yamada Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 497-506Google Scholar). Based on these similarities, it has been proposed that three classes of glycosyltransferases (HASs, chitin synthases, and cellulose synthases) diverged from a common ancestral molecule. HA is a multifunctional player in the vertebrate extracellular matrix. One of the important features of the HA network is its ability to hold a large amount of water, exhibiting viscoelastic properties. HA also directly affects cell behavior through its cell-surface receptors: CD44 (for review, see Ref. 3Isacke C.M. Yarwood H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 718-721Google Scholar), RHAMM (receptor for HA-mediated motility) (4Turley E.A. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1992; 11: 21-30Google Scholar, 5Turley E.A. Noble P.W. Bourguignon L.Y. J.

A. 2002; 99: 3609-3614Google Scholar), illustrate the biological importance of HA. However, little is known about the mechanism of HA synthesis. Membrane extracts prepared from yeast cells expressing the Xenopus HAS (DG42) gene showed HA synthesizing activity in vitro solely in the presence of exogenously supplied substrates and magnesium ions (21DeAngelis P.L. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23657-23660Google Scholar). Furthermore, a purified single HAS1 protein or a HAS1 gene product of an in vitro transcription/translation system has been shown to have HAS activity (2Yoshida M. Itano N. Yamada Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 497-506Google Scholar). These results indicate that the HAS protein alone can synthesize HA in vitro without any other protein factors. However, it is not clear whether other components are required for in vivo HA biosynthesis for proper chain elongation, termination, and secretion. In this study, we demonstrate that a single mammalian HAS protein (HAS2) can efficiently synthesize and secrete HA in Drosophila, which is a chitin-synthesizing organism and which does not naturally produce HA. This implies that conversion of the biosynthetic machinery of chitin to that of HA can happen by a single molecule exchange: substitution of chitin synthase with HAS. HAS2 expression caused various morphological defects due to disruption of cell-cell communication. HA synthesized in fly tissues was able to retain a high level of water, which is the characteristic biophysical feature of this macromolecule. The ability of Drosophila cells to produce functional HA supports the idea that HAS is the only critical factor required for normal HA biosynthesis. Another interesting possibility is that HA is produced by HAS together with endogenous components involved in chitin biosynthesis. Upstream Activating Sequence (UAS) Constructs and Ectopic Expression—The UAS-HAS2 transgene was constructed by cloning the full-length mouse HAS2 cDNA into the pUAST vector. Transgenic flies were obtained by P-element-mediated germ line transformation (22Rubin G.M. Spradling A.C. Science. 1982; 218: 348-353Google Scholar). In this study, we used two independent HAS2 transgenic strains (UAS-HAS2-1 and UAS-HAS2-2) that bear transgenic insertions at different chromosomal locations. The HAS2 gene was misexpressed in the Gal4/UAS system (23Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Google Scholar) using the following Gal4 drivers. 29BD-GAL4 is an enhancer trap line of P{GawB} and ubiquitously expresses a high level of Gal4 protein (24Toba G. Ohsako T. Miyata N. Ohtsuka T. Seong K.H. Aigaki T. Genetics. 1999; 151: 725-737Google Scholar). engrailed-GAL4 and apterous-GAL4 were used to express HAS2 in the posterior and dorsal compartments of the wing disc, respectively. GMR-GAL4 and A9-GAL4 drive target gene expression in developing eyes and wings, respectively. To overexpress sugarless (sgl), we used the transgenic strain bearing the sgl gene under the control of the ubiquitin promoter (ubi-sgl) (25Haerry T.E. Heslip T.R. Marsh J.L. O'Connor M.B. Development. 1997; 124: 3055-3064Google Scholar). Preparation and Quantification of Glycosaminoglycans—To quantify HA and chondroitin sulfate, crude glycosaminoglycans from 25 mg of lyophilized Drosophila third instar larvae were prepared as described previously (26Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2269-2275Google Scholar) and dissolved in 100 μl of H2O. A 20-μl portion of the crude glycosaminoglycans was digested with 2 turbidity reducing unit of Streptomyces hyaluronidase in 100 μl of 50 mm acetate buffer (pH 6.0) at 60 °C for 1 h. The resulting hyaluronic acid tera- and hexasaccharides were then filtered with Ultrafree-MC (5000 nominal molecular weight limit). HA contained in the filtrates and the recovered glycosaminoglycans retained on the filter were digested separately with chondroitinases ABC and ACII and 5 μg of bovine serum albumin in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) at 37 °C for 2 h. The digests were filtered with Ultrafree-MC (5000 nominal molecular weight limit), and unsaturated disaccharides contained in the filtrates were determined by reversed-phase ion pair chromatography using a Senshu-Pak Docosil column equipped with a post-column fluorescence detector according to the method of Toyoda et al. (26Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2269-2275Google Scholar) except for a slight modification of the elution conditions. For preparation and quantification of heparan sulfate, a 10-μl portion of the crude glycosaminoglycans was digested with a mixture of 10 milliunits of heparitinase I, 5 milliunits of heparitinase II, and 10 milliunits of heparitinase III in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 1 mm CaCl2, and 4 μg of bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 16 h. The digests were analyzed as described above. Preparation and Quantification of Chitin—For the quantitative measurement of chitin, the amount of GlcNAc released by chitinase was measured by a colorimetric method. Lyophilized Drosophila larvae (25 mg, dry weight) were homogenized with 1.0 ml of acetone. The homogenate was washed with acetone and dried. The pellet was suspended in 1.0 ml of 0.1 n NaOH for 16 h at room temperature. After alkali treatment, 25 μl of 4 n acetic acid were added; actinase E was then added and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Insoluble material was isolated by centrifugation, washed twice with water, and resuspended in 400 μl of 200 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.0). Chitinase (2.0 mg) from Bacillus sp. dissolved in the same buffer (200 mm) was added, and the mixed solution was incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. After centrifugation, an 80-μl aliquot of each sample was assayed for GlcNAc by measuring the absorbance at 585 nm (27Reissig J.L. Storminger J.L. Leloir L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 959-966Google Scholar). Agarose Gel Electrophoresis of HA—A 20-μl portion of the crude glycosaminoglycans prepared as described above was fractionated by 0.5% agarose gel electrophoresis (28Lee H.G. Cowman M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 278-287Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, HA was blotted onto nylon membrane and detected by the ECL detection system with biotinylated HA-binding protein (b-HABP) (Seikagaku Co.) as a probe as described previously (17Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M. Yoshida Y. Ohnuki Y. Miyauchi S. Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25085-25092Google Scholar). HA with average masses of 21.3, 14.1, 9.9, 6.4, 4.6, and 1.0 × 105 Da was used as a standard. To test the sensitivity of detected bands to chitinase and hyaluronidase, the crude glycosaminoglycan fractions were treated with these enzymes before gel electrophoresis. The samples were incubated with 0.5 mg of chitinase from Bacillus sp. at 37 °C for 90 min (29Zhang M. Haga A. Sekiguchi H. Hirano S. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2000; 27: 99-105Google Scholar). After inactivation of chitinase by heating at 95 °C for 5 min, glycosaminoglycans were recovered by ethanol precipitation. Subsequently, the samples were incubated with or without 0.1 turbidity reducing unit of Streptomyces hyaluronidase at 55 °C for 1 h. Histochemical Staining—To detect HA in situ in Drosophila tissues, histochemical staining was performed using b-HABP as a probe (17Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M. Yoshida Y. Ohnuki Y. Miyauchi S. Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25085-25092Google Scholar). Wing imaginal discs were dissected from third instar larvae and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 50 min. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol. After washing with 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, nonspecific binding was blocked with 10% goat serum in 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. The discs were incubated with 2.5 μg/ml b-HABP in 10% goat serum overnight at 4 °C. After unbound probe was washed off, the discs were incubated with Avidin-Biotin Complex regent (Vector Labs, Inc.) for 1 h, and b-HABP was detected by staining with 0.5 mg/ml 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and 0.03% H2O2 diluted in phosphate-buffered saline. For subcellular localization of HA, the signal was amplified and detected using a tyramide signal amplification fluorescence system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and imaged using an LSM410 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Cobalt sulfide staining was performed to visualize the apical surface of pupal retina as described previously (30Wolff T. Ready D.F. Development. 1991; 113: 825-839Google Scholar). Quantification of the H2O Content of Drosophila Adult Wings—Adult wings were collected from wild-type or 29BD-GAL4/UAS-HAS2-2 males at 3–5 days after eclosion. To prevent evaporation of water from the tissue, wings were rapidly removed from the thorax at the base using forceps. Approximately 25–50 wings (0.1–0.2 mg) were used as a sample to measure the H2O content by the coulometric Karl-Fischer method (31Fischer K.A. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1935; 48: 394-396Google Scholar, 32Thiex N.J. Van Erem T. J. Assoc. Off. Anal. Chem. Int. 2002; 85: 318-327Google Scholar) using an AQ-6 water content analyzer (Hiranuma Sangyo Co.). Immediately after the fresh weight of each sample was determined using an S4 Ultramicro balance (Sartorius Corp.), water was extracted from the wings and titrated with Hydranal Aqualyte RS (Riedel-deHaen Co.) as a titrant. Aqualyte CN (Kanto Kagaku Co.) was used as a solvent. Sets of four and six samples were prepared for wild-type and 29BD-GAL4/UAS-HAS2-2 wings, respectively, and measurements were performed independently. HA Synthesis upon HAS2 Expression in Drosophila—A previous biochemical study on glycosaminoglycans from Drosophila showed that no detectable HA exists in this organism (26Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2269-2275Google Scholar). We first asked whether Drosophila cells have the ability to synthesize HA when a HAS protein is introduced. We used the Gal4/UAS system (23Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Google Scholar) to drive expression of the mouse HAS2 gene in vivo. The HAS2 cDNA was ligated downstream of the UAS, and the resultant plasmid construct was integrated into the genomic DNA by P-element-mediated transformation. The established Drosophila strains bearing the UAS-HAS2 transgene were crossed with various Gal4 strains to express HAS genes ubiquitously or in a tissue-specific manner. To determine whether HA is synthesized in the HAS gene-expressing animals, we prepared crude glycosaminoglycan fractions from third instar larvae according to the method described previously (26Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2269-2275Google Scholar) and quantified HA. A large amount of HA was detected in larvae obtained from crosses between the 29BD-GAL4 driver and two independent UAS-HAS2 transgenic strains, whereas no detectable HA was observed in the wild-type control animals (Table I).Table IDetermination of the amounts of glycosaminoglycans and chitin from HAS2-transgenic Drosophila Crude glycosaminoglycans were prepared from wild-type and 29BD〉HAS2 third instar larvae. The amounts of HA, chondroitin sulfate (CS), and heparan sulfate (HS) were determined by fluorescence disaccharide analysis. Chitin was also quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Two independent transgenic strains for UAS-HAS2 (UAS-HAS2-1 and UAS-HAS2-2) were used for this analysis.

HAS2 expression was induced by engrailed-GAL4, which drives Gal4 expression in the posterior compartment of imaginal discs (Fig. 1A). Histochemical staining showed specific binding of the b-HABP probe to the posterior half of the wing (Fig. 1B). This result confirmed that HA is synthesized in Drosophila tissues and accumulates at the sites of HAS2 expression. We also used this probe in a fluorescence detection system to determine the subcellular localization of HA. As shown in Fig. 1C, signals were detected mainly on the cell surface, suggesting that synthesized HA is secreted and deposited on the cell surface or in the extracellular matrix. We next analyzed the size distribution of HA synthesized in the HAS2 transgenic animals. Crude glycosaminoglycan fractions prepared from wild-type and 29BD-GAL4/UAS-HAS2 larvae were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. HA was blotted onto nylon membrane and detected using b-HABP as a probe. In the crude glycosaminoglycan preparation from HAS2-expressing animals, we detected HA, which migrated as broad peaks with large molecular masses ranging from 1 × 105 to 2 × 106 Da (Fig. 1D, lane 2). The size distribution of HA prepared from 29BD-GAL4/UAS-HAS2 animals was smaller than that synthesized by the same enzyme in rat 3Y1 fibroblasts (molecular masses of >2 × 106 Da), but was comparable with that produced in vitro by membrane preparation of HAS2 transfectant (molecular masses of 2 × 105 to 2 × 106 Da) (17Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M. Yoshida Y. Ohnuki Y. Miyauchi S. Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25085-25092Google Scholar). On the other hand, a weak background signal was observed at a low molecular mass range in the wild-type control lane (Fig. 1D, lane 1). To determine whether this low molecular mass smear band reflects the existence of HA or other related molecules in the wild-type fraction, we tested its sensitivity to chitinase (Bacillus) and hyaluronidase (Streptomyces). As shown in lanes 3 and 5, the low molecular mass signals were not eliminated by incubation with chitinase or hyaluronidase, indicating that these signals do not represent either HA or chitin. In contrast, HA produced in HAS2-expressing animals was not affected by chitinase treatment (lane 4), but was completely degraded by adding hyaluronidase (lane 6). Although the nature of the low molecular mass band is unknown, it seems to be a background signal detectable only in blotting experiments because the b-HABP probe specifically recognized regions of the wing discs where HAS2 was expressed in situ (Fig. 1B) and did not stain wild-type discs (data not shown). HAS2 Gene Expression Disrupts Morphogenesis in Drosophila Tissues—Overexpression of HAS2 using several different Gal4 drivers caused lethality and a variety of morphological defects in adult tissues (Fig. 2). Eye-specific expression of the HAS2 gene by GMR-GAL4 induced a so-called “rough eye” phenotype, characterized by reduced numbers of ommatidia and disordered ommatidial arrays of the compound eye (Fig. 2B). To further analyze this eye defect, we observed pupal retina stained with cobalt sulfide (Fig. 2, C and D). In contrast to wild-type retina, which showed precise and ordered patterns of differentiation of ommatidial components, HAS2-expressing eyes exhibited several distinct defects. These abnormalities included decreased numbers of cone cells, abnormal sizes and shapes of primary pigment cells, and ectopic interommatidial bristles. Overexpression of HAS2 in the developing wing using A9-GAL4 led to thickened and disarranged wing veins (Fig. 2, E and F). When HAS2 expression was induced in the dorsal part of wing imaginal discs by apterous-GAL4, the wings failed to extend. In addition, the patterns and formation of notal bristles were disrupted; most large mechanosensory bristles (macrochaetae) were lost or shortened with abruptly ended tips (Fig. 2, G and H). In this study, we used two independent HAS2 transgenic strains, UAS-HAS2-1 and UAS-HAS2-2. The phenotypes associated with HAS2 expression by these two transgenes were fundamentally similar, but different in severity (Table II). Expression of UAS-HAS2-1, which produces higher levels of HA, resulted in more severe expressivity and higher penetrance compared with that of UAS-HAS2-2.Table IIPhenotypes produced by expression of the HAS2 gene in Drosophila The phenotypes induced by HAS2 expression by two independent transgenic strains (UAS-HAS2-1 and UAS-HAS2-2) with each GAL4 driver are shown. Expression of UAS-HAS2-1, which produces higher levels of HA, resulted in much more severe phenotypes compared with that of UAS-HAS2-2.

For example, during eye development, differentiation of cone and pigment cells requires activation of the Drosophila epidermal growth factor receptor (DER), and compromising DER signaling leads to reduced numbers of cone cells and pigment cells (33Freeman M. Cell. 1996; 87: 651-660Google Scholar). On the other hand, an enlarged wing vein is a common phenotype observed upon reduction of Notch signaling (34de Celis J.F. Bray S. Garcia-Bellido A. Development. 1997; 124: 1919-1928Google Scholar, 35Huppert S.S. Jacobsen T.L. Muskavitch M.A. Development. 1997; 124: 3283-3291Google Scholar). In addition, the bristle phenotypes of UAS-HAS2/+;apterous-GAL4/+ flies resemble those of warthog (wrt) mutants (36Purcell K. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 731-740Google Scholar). The wrt gene encodes a Drosophila homolog of Rab6, which regulates trafficking from the Golgi to the trans-Golgi network, and is required for proper secretion and cell-surface presentation of extracellular or transmembrane proteins. One of the signaling cascades affected by wrt mutations is the Notch pathway (37Verheyen E.M. Purcell K.J. Fortini M.E. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1127-1141Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that some of HAS2 overexpression phenotypes are a result of altered DER and/or Notch pathways. This observation suggests that HAS2 expression interferes with cell-cell communications required for normal cell growth and differentiation during Drosophila tissue assembly. HAS2 Expression Does Not Affect the Levels of Other Glycosaminoglycans and Chitin—Are the morphological defects of the HAS2-expressing animals caused by HA deposition? Alternatively, does HAS2 expression affect the levels of other polysaccharides and therefore indirectly produce the phenotypes? In particular, because the biosynthesis of HA and heparan sulfate, a different class of glycosaminoglycans, requires the common substrates UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc, a possible explanation for these phenotypes could be interference with heparan sulfate synthesis; high levels of HAS protein may compete for the substrates with the endogenous heparan sulfate biosynthetic machinery. Indeed, a number of studies have demonstrated that heparan sulfate plays a critical role in Drosophila morphogenesis (for reviews, see Refs. 38Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Google Scholar, 39Lander A.D. Selleck S.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 227-232Google Scholar, 40Selleck S.B. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 206-212Google Scholar, 41Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Google Scholar). Similarly, synthesis of chondroitin sulfate and chitin, which need UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc, respectively, may also be affected. To determine the effects of HAS2 expression on the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate, and chitin, we measured the levels of these polysaccharides in the HAS2-expressing animals. As shown in Table I, we did not detect a significant change in the levels of these molecules upon expression of HAS2, although UAS-HAS2-1/+;29BD-GAL4/+ showed a moderately reduced level of heparan sulfate. Overexpression of UDP-glucose Dehydrogenase Enhances the Phenotype of HAS2-expressing Animals—Several lines of information suggest that the moderate reduction of heparan sulfate in UAS-HAS2-1/+;29BD-GAL4/+ animals is unlikely to cause the morphological defects in the HAS2-expressing animals. First, reduced levels of heparan sulfate cannot explain the various phenotypes of 29BD-GAL4/UAS-HAS2-2, which showed a normal level of heparan sulfate (Table I). Second, we have several other transgenic strains that produce higher levels of HA and also show wild-type levels of heparan sulfate (data not shown); thus, HA production and heparan sulfate reduction do not seem to be directly correlated. To further examine whether the phenotypes associated with HAS2 expression depend"
https://openalex.org/W2045935602,"Nitric-oxide synthases (NOSs) are flavo-heme enzymes whose electron transfer reactions are controlled by calmodulin (CaM). The NOS flavoprotein domain includes a ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR)-like module that contains NADPH- and FAD-binding sites. FNR-like modules in related flavoproteins have three conserved residues that regulate electron transfer between bound NAD(P)H and FAD. To investigate the function of one of these residues in neuronal NOS (nNOS), we generated and characterized mutants that had Val, Glu, or Asn substituted for the conserved Asp-1393. All three mutants exhibited normal composition, spectral properties, and binding of cofactors, substrates, and CaM. All had slower NADPH-dependent cytochrome c and ferricyanide reductase activities, which were associated with proportionally slower rates of NADPH-dependent flavin reduction in the CaM-free and CaM-bound states. Rates of NO synthesis were also proportionally slower in the mutants and were associated with slower rates of CaM-dependent ferric heme reduction. However, a D1393V mutant whose flavins had been prereduced with NADPH had a normal rate of heme reduction. This indicated that the kinetic defect was restricted to flavin reduction step(s) in the mutants and suggested that this limited their catalytic activities. Together, our results show the following. 1) The presence and positioning of the Asp-1393 carboxylate side chain are critical to enable NADPH-dependent reduction of the nNOS flavoprotein. 2) Control of flavin reduction is important because it ensures that the rate of heme reduction is sufficiently fast to enable NO synthesis by nNOS.

Animals generate NO by virtue of the nitric-oxide synthases (NOSs), which catalyze a stepwise, NADPH-dependent oxidation of l-Arg to NO and l-citrulline, with Nω-hydroxy-l-arginine (NOHA) being formed as an intermediate. Each NOS is composed of an N-terminal oxygenase domain that binds iron protoporphyrin IX (heme), (6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B), and substrate, l-Arg, and a C-terminal flavoprotein domain that binds FAD, FMN, and NADPH. A calmodulin (CaM)-binding sequence connects the oxygenase and flavoprotein domains. During catalysis, electrons from NADPH transfer into the FAD and FMN groups of the NOS flavoprotein domain, and then transfer one at a time from the FMN hydroquinone (FMNH2) to the ferric heme (4Marletta M.A. Hurshman A.R.

In all NOSs studied so far, the rates of NADPH-dependent flavin reduction are fast relative to the rates of electron transfer from FMNH2 to the ferric heme in the CaM-bound enzymes (11Miller R.T.

This makes heme reduction rate-limiting for NO synthesis and implies that the NOS flavins predominantly exist in their reduced forms during steady-state NO synthesis. NOSs are part of a small enzyme family whose members have covalently linked flavoprotein and heme domains. The attached heme domain makes NOSs particularly useful for studying how electron transfer is regulated both into and out of the flavoprotein domain. NOS electron transfer reactions appear to be regulated at multiple levels by CaM. For example, CaM has been reported to increase the rates of NADPH-dependent flavin reduction and inter-flavin electron transfer, to increase the rate of electron transfer from the NOS flavoprotein to external acceptors like ferricyanide or cytochrome c, and to trigger NOS ferric heme reduction (14Roman L.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 29163-29170Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons and crystallographic studies have identified some common structural motifs that participate in dinucleotide cofactor binding or impact electron transfer in the FNR-like enzymes. For example, there typically are three conserved residues positioned near the NAD(P)H-FAD interface in these enzymes. These residues are represented in rat nNOS by Asp-1393, Ser-1176, and Cys-1349 (27Zhang J. Martasek P. Paschke R. Shea T. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37506-37513Google Scholar). Mutagenic substitution studies on the analogously positioned residues in FNR enzymes, cytochrome P450 reductase, and other related enzymes have established that each of the three residues helps to enhance the rate of hydride transfer between NAD(P)H and FAD (32Hubbard P.A.

Given the structural and regulatory properties of the NOSs, we sought to examine how one of these conserved residues (Asp-1393, Fig. 1) functions in rat nNOS regarding NADPH reduction of the flavoprotein domain and its export of electrons. Crystal structures of some related flavoproteins have revealed that the carboxylate side chain of this conserved Asp makes hydrogen bonds with adjacent protein residues and with the nicotinamide moiety of NAD(P)H (20Roman L.J. Martasek P. Masters B.S. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 1179-1190Google Scholar, 32Hubbard P.A. Shen A.L. Paschke R. Kasper C.B. Kim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29163-29170Google Scholar, 40Deng Z.

Kubota M. Nishizaki T. Masai E. Fukuda M. Mitsuidagger Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 397-410Google Scholar). We therefore utilized site-directed mutagenesis to substitute Val, Asn, or Glu for Asp-1393 in nNOS. These either remove the side chain carboxylate, neutralize its charge, or alter its positioning, respectively. Characterization of these mutants reveals how Asp-1393 influences electron transfer into the nNOS flavoprotein domain, and how this in turn impacts electron transfer to the nNOS heme as well as the various catalytic activities. Materials—All reagents and materials were obtained from Sigma or sources previously reported (16Adak S. Santolini J. Tikunova S. Wang Q. Johnson J.D. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1244-1252Google Scholar, 42Adak S. Ghosh S. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22313-22320Google Scholar, 43Adak S. Aulak K.S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23246-23252Google Scholar). Molecular Biology—Restriction digestions, cloning, bacterial growth, and transformation and isolation of DNA fragments were performed using standard procedures. Originally, rat nNOS DNA was inserted into the 5′ NdeI and 3′ XbaI site into the pCWori vector (16Adak S. Santolini J. Tikunova S. Wang Q. Johnson J.D. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1244-1252Google Scholar). The D1393V, D1393E, and D1393N mutation sites in the nNOS cDNA were constructed by subcloning a PCR-generated fragment from pCWori/nNOS using a 5′-oligonucleotide containing a newly engineered mutational site. The nNOS cDNA fragment coding from the KpnI unique restriction site at 4176 to the XbaI restriction site at 4441 was amplified using primers as follows: D1393V forward primer, AACGGTACCACGAGGTCATCTTTGGAGTCACCCTCAGAA, and D1393V reverse primer, AAATCTAGAAGGACCAGGACACAGCAACAGGACAAG; D1393E forward primer, AACGGTACCACGAGGAAATCTTTGGAGTCACCCTCAGAA, and D1393E reverse primer, AAATCTAGAAGGACCAGGACACAGCAACAGGACAAG; and D1393N forward primer, AACGGTACCACGAGAACATCTTTGGAGTCACCCTCAGAA, and D1393N reverse primer, AAATCTAGAAGGACCAGGACACAGCAACAGGACAAG. The silent restriction sites and mutation sites are denoted by underlines and boldface, respectively. The PCR product and wild-type pCWori vector containing nNOS DNA were digested by both KpnI/XbaI restriction enzymes. The double digested fragment of wild-type NOS pCWori plasmid was replaced by the double digested PCR fragment and transformed into JM109 cells to generate recombinant plasmid. Sequences of mutations were confirmed at the Cleveland Clinic DNA Sequencing Facility. Plasmids containing D1393V, D1393E, or D1393N mutant DNA were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) for protein expression. Expression and Purification of Wild-type and Mutant Proteins— Wild-type rat nNOS and all three mutant proteins had a His6 tag attached to their N termini to aid purification. They were overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified by sequential chromatography on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid and 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose resins in the absence of CaM as described earlier (16Adak S. Santolini J. Tikunova S. Wang Q. Johnson J.D. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1244-1252Google Scholar, 42Adak S. Ghosh S. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22313-22320Google Scholar). Determination of Bound FAD and FMN—Bound FAD and FMN were released from nNOS or mutants by heat denaturation (95 °C for 5 min in the dark) and measured using a fluorometric high pressure liquid chromatography method as described previously (16Adak S. Santolini J. Tikunova S. Wang Q. Johnson J.D. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1244-1252Google Scholar). NO Synthesis, NADPH Oxidation, Cytochrome c Reduction, and Ferricyanide Reduction—Steady-state activities of wild-type and mutant proteins were determined separately at 25 °C using spectrophotometric assays that were described previously in detail (16Adak S. Santolini J. Tikunova S. Wang Q. Johnson J.D. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1244-1252Google Scholar, 42Adak S. Ghosh S. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22313-22320Google Scholar, 43Adak S. Aulak K.S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23246-23252Google Scholar). Measurement of Apparent Km for NADPH—Apparent Km and Vmax values were determined by double-reciprocal analysis of the NADPH-dependent cytochrome c reductase activity versus initial NADPH concentration with reactions run in the presence or absence of Ca2+/CaM. Steady-state NADPH Oxidation—Wild-type and mutant nNOS enzymes were diluted to 4 μm in a cuvette that contained buffer, H4B, Ca2+, CaM, and other additives as used for the NO synthesis assay (42Adak S. Ghosh S. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22313-22320Google Scholar), except that here oxyhemoglobin, l-Arg, and NADPH were omitted. A spectrum was collected, and NADPH solution was then added to give 100 μm, and a second spectrum was collected during NADPH consumption. Flavin and Heme Reduction Kinetics—Kinetics of flavin and heme reduction were analyzed at 10 °C as described previously (16Adak S. Santolini J. Tikunova S. Wang Q. Johnson J.D. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1244-1252Google Scholar, 42Adak S. Ghosh S. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22313-22320Google Scholar, 43Adak S. Aulak K.S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23246-23252Google Scholar) using a stopped-flow apparatus (with a dead time of 1.5 ms) from Hi-Tech Ltd. (models SF-61 and 51-MX) connected to diode array or single wavelength detectors and equipped for anaerobic work. Flavin reduction kinetics was determined from the absorbance change at 485 nm and in some cases at 600 nm. In the case of D1393V nNOS, the enzyme preparation to be used in flavin reduction experiments was first treated with FeCN6 followed by size exclusion chromatography to oxidize the air-stable FMN semiquinone that is normally present in the enzyme after purification. The NOS heme reduction inhibitor N-nitro-l-arginine (44Abu-Soud H.M. Feldman P.L. Clark P. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32318-32326Google Scholar) was also added in order to prevent concurrent electron transfer from FMNH2 to the ferric heme during measures of flavin reduction kinetics. In cases where the rate of heme reduction was to be determined, we omitted N-nitro-l-arginine. Heme reduction was monitored by formation of the ferrous-CO complex and the kinetics determined by fitting traces of absorbance change versus time at 444 nm. Unless stated otherwise, reactions were initiated by rapid mixing an anaerobic CO-saturated solution containing 100 μm NADPH with an anaerobic CO-saturated solution containing wild-type or mutant nNOS (2 μm), 40 mm EPPS buffer, pH 7.6, 10 μm H4B, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 1mml-Arg, 4 μm CaM, and 1 mm Ca2+. In one case, the heme reduction kinetics in D1393V nNOS was studied differently. The enzyme was preincubated at room temperature with excess NADPH in an anaerobic cuvette and in the absence of CaM and added Ca2+, in order to prereduce the flavoprotein domain. NADPH reduction of enzyme flavins was confirmed by monitoring the loss of absorbance between 380 and 500 nm versus time of preincubation, and took about 1 h. The prereduced enzyme was then transferred into the stopped-flow device and mixed under anaerobic conditions with a CO-saturated solution containing 1 mm Ca2+ and 4 μm CaM to trigger heme reduction. In all stopped-flow studies, the signal-to-noise ratios were improved by averaging 7–10 individual mixing experiments. The time course of absorbance change was fit to single or multiple exponential equations using a nonlinear least squares method provided by the instrument manufacturer. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Flavin fluorescence measurements were done using a Hitachi model F-2000 spectrofluorometer as described previously (42Adak S. Ghosh S. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22313-22320Google Scholar, 45Gachhui R. Presta A. Bentley D.F. Abu-Soud H.M. McArthur R. Brudvig G. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20594-20602Google Scholar). A 1-ml quartz cuvette with a path length of 1 cm was used for the experiments. The nNOS proteins were diluted to 2 μm in 40 mm EPPS, pH 7.6, containing 0.6 mm EDTA, 1 mm DDT, and 3 μm CaM. Proteins were irradiated with 460 nm light using an in-line 8% filter, and the emission at 530 nm was monitored versus time before and after consecutive addition of 1 mm Ca2+ and 3 mm EDTA. Spectral and Physical Properties—The Asp-1393 mutant nNOS proteins expressed well in E. coli and displayed normal spectral properties in their purified forms. For example, the mutants exhibited a Soret peak at 393 nm and visible peaks at 460 and 485 nm in the presence of 1 mml-Arg and 10 μm H4B (data not shown). Dithionite reduction of each mutant in the presence of l-Arg, H4B, and CO produced the expected 444 nm absorbance peak for the six coordinate ferrous-CO complex in all cases (data not shown). Flavin analysis showed that the mutants contained normal quantities of FAD and FMN (∼1 each per nNOS heme) (data not shown). Their ability to bind and elute from the 2′,5′-ADP resin during purification showed that they still could reversibly bind NADPH. These properties indicate that substitution of Asp-1393 by Val, Glu, or Asn did not grossly alter the physical properties of nNOS. Steady-state Catalytic Activities—Tables I and II list values for four steady-state catalytic activities of the wild-type and mutant nNOS enzymes that were measured at 23 (room temperature) and 10 °C. The D1393V mutant had markedly lower ferricyanide and cytochrome c reductase activities compared with wild type in either the CaM-bound or CaM-free state. CaM binding only marginally increased the cytochrome c or ferricyanide reductase activities of D1393V nNOS. In contrast, the D1393E and D1393N mutants had basal ferricyanide and cytochrome c reductase activities that ranged from one-fourth to one-half of the wild-type enzyme reductase activities. CaM increased the reductase activities of the D1393E and D1393N mutants in a manner similar to wild type, although the absolute values achieved for the mutants remained lower and ranged from one-fourth to one-third those of wild-type nNOS plus CaM.Table ISteady-state catalytic activities of wild-type and mutant nNOSnNos enzymeFerricyanide reductionCytochrome c reductionNO synthesisNADPH oxidation+CaM-Cam+CaM-CaM+CaM-CaM+CaM-CaMmin-1min-1min-1min-1Wild typeaData from Ref. 65.5182 ± 300955 ± 325742 ± 116462 ± 1165 ± 1ND128 ± 45.6 ± 1D1393E1600 ± 104500 ± 231082 ± 51104 ± 521 ± 1ND54 ± 22.4 ± 0.1D1393N1701 ± 47673 ± 161193 ± 28127 ± 128 ± 2ND68 ± 32.8 ± 0.03D1393V12 ± 111 ± 110 ± 110 ± 1NDND0.5 ± 0.11 ± 0.1a Data from Ref. 65Panda K.

In contrast, D1393V nNOS had no detectable NO synthesis when l-Arg was the substrate, but did show a low, detectable activity (1.3 ± 0.4 NO per min at room temperature) when the reaction intermediate NOHA was used as substrate in place of l-Arg. Rates of NADPH oxidation were also measured during the NO synthesis assays or in the absence of CaM (Tables I and II). For the D1393E and D1393N mutants, the NADPH oxidation rates were proportionally lower than that of wild-type nNOS. Thus, NADPH oxidation in these mutants remained relatively well coupled to their NO synthesis. Rates of NADPH oxidation for D1393V nNOS were much lower than those of wild-type nNOS, consistent with its poor NO synthesis. Together, the results indicate that the carboxyl side chain of Asp-1393 has a crucial role in the catalysis of these four steady-state activities in the presence or absence of CaM. Apparent Km for NADPH and Enzyme CaM Response—The apparent Km values for NADPH in the nNOS mutant proteins did not differ significantly from wild type (Table III). Apparent Km values were increased 1.5–2-fold by CaM binding, consistent with a previous report (46Matsuda H. Iyanagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 345-355Google Scholar). These data suggest that the Asp-1393 mutations did not significantly alter NADPH binding interaction with nNOS.Table IIIApparent Km value of NADPH for wild type and mutant nNOS enzymesnNOS enzymeKm of NADPH-CaM+CaMμmWild type2.5 ± 0.54.8 ± 0.2D1393E1.0 ± 0.22.4 ± 0.4D1393N1.3 ± 0.12.6 ± 0.3D1393V2.9 ± 0.44.5 ± 0.7 Open table in a new tab CaM binding to nNOS increases its flavin fluorescence in a partially reversible manner (42Adak S.

As shown in Fig. 2, CaM binding to either the D1393V or D1393E mutants caused fluorescence increases that were similar to those observed with wild-type nNOS. These results suggest that CaM binds to the Asp-1393 mutants and induces normal protein conformational changes within the flavoprotein domain. Kinetics of Flavin and Ferric Heme Reduction—To determine how the Asp-1393 mutations impact electron transfer in nNOS, we compared rates of NADPH-dependent flavin and ferric heme reduction in the enzymes. The reactions were initiated in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer at 10 °C by rapid-mixing enzymes with excess NADPH under anaerobic conditions, and the absorbance change was followed using either a diode array or single wavelength detector. Rates of flavin reduction were determined by monitoring the absorbance decrease at 485 nm, whereas rates of heme reduction were determined from the absorbance increase at 444 nm, which monitors formation of a ferrous heme-CO complex (42Adak S. Ghosh S. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22313-22320Google Scholar, 43Adak S. Aulak K.S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23246-23252Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Averaged absorbance traces representing flavin and heme reduction in D1393E and D1393N nNOS are shown in Fig. 3, A–C and D–F, respectively. Like wild-type nNOS (15Guan Z.W. Iyanagi T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 412: 65-76Google Scholar, 42Adak S. Ghosh S. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22313-22320Google Scholar), the absorbance change at 485 nm indicating flavin reduction was sufficiently described as biphasic for either mutant (Table IV), although less of their total absorbance change could be attributed to the fast phase as compared with wild-type enzyme. CaM increased the fast phase rates of flavin reduction for either mutant in a manner similar to wild-type enzyme. The averaged kinetic traces obtained at 444 nm for the D1393E and D1393N mutants are displayed in Fig. 3, C and F. The initial decrease in absorbance that appears in both traces was due to the initial NADPH-dependent flavin reduction step that must take place prior to electron transfer to the ferric heme. The subsequent absorbance gain at 444 nm represents ferric heme reduction, and this phase was sufficiently described as a monophasic transition for both mutants. The data indicate that the rates of ferric heme reduction are similar for the D1393E and D1393N nNOS mutants and are about four times slower than in wild-type nNOS (Table IV).

https://openalex.org/W2102303504,"S100B is a small, dimeric EF-hand calcium-binding protein abundant in vertebrates. Upon calcium binding, S100B undergoes a conformational change allowing it to interact with a variety of target proteins, including the cytoskeletal proteins tubulin and glial fibrillary acidic protein. In both cases, S100B promotes the in vitro disassembly of these proteins in a calcium-sensitive manner. Despite this, there is little in vivo evidence for the interaction of proteins such as tubulin with S100B. To probe these interactions, we studied the expression of human S100B in Escherichia coli and its interaction with the prokaryotic ancestor of tubulin, FtsZ, the major protein involved in bacterial division. Expression of S100B protein in E. coli results in little change in FtsZ protein levels, causes a filamenting bacterial phenotype characteristic of FtsZ inhibition, and leads to missed rounds of cell division. Further, S100B localizes to positions similar to those of FtsZ in bacterial filaments: the small foci at the poles, the mid-cell positions, and between the nucleoids at regular intervals. Calcium-dependent physical interaction between S100B and FtsZ was demonstrated in vitro by affinity chromatography, and this interaction was severely inhibited by the competitor peptide TRTK-12. Together these results indicate that S100B interacts with the tubulin homologue FtsZ in vivo, modulating its activity in bacterial cell division. This approach will present an important step for the study of S100 protein interactions in vivo. S100B is a small, dimeric EF-hand calcium-binding protein abundant in vertebrates.

S100B is one of more than 20 known members of the small (9–12 kDa), acidic S100 family of EF-hand calcium-binding proteins, which are expressed in vertebrates, generally in a tissue-specific manner (reviewed in Ref. 1Donato R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 637-668Google Scholar). Most of these proteins form homo- and heterodimers that respond to signal-induced increases in intracellular calcium levels. Upon binding calcium, these proteins undergo conformational changes that allow them to bind to target proteins and modulate their activity. S100B is abundantly expressed in glial cells, where its best characterized roles involve modulating protein-protein interactions of all three classes of cytoskeletal structures. The assembly/disassembly of microtubules can be controlled by S100B through its interactions with tubulin (2Reeves R.H. Yao J. Crowley M.R. Buck S. Zhang X. Yarowsky P. Gearhart J.D. Hilt D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5359-5363Google Scholar, 3Sorci G. Agneletti A.L. Bianchi R. Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1448: 277-289Google Scholar, 4Sorci G. Agneletti A.L. Donato R. Neuroscience. 2000; 99: 773-783Google Scholar) and the microtubule-associated protein, tau (5Baudier J. Cole R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5876-5883Google Scholar). In addition, S100B can regulate the dynamics of intermediate filaments through its interactions with the glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin (3Sorci G. Agneletti A.L. Bianchi R. Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1448: 277-289Google Scholar, 6Ziegler D.R. Innocente C.E. Leal R.B. Rodnight R. Goncalves C.A. Neurochem. Res. 1998; 23: 1259-1263Google Scholar), and annexin VI (7Garbuglia M. Verzini M. Donato R. Cell Calcium. 1998; 24: 177-191Google Scholar, 8Garbuglia M. Verzini M. Hofmann A. Huber R. Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 192-206Google Scholar). The S100B-mediated regulation of microfilaments has been suggested based on calcium-dependent in vitro interactions with the actin capping protein, CapZα (9Kilby P.M. Van Eldik L.J. Roberts G.C. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2494-2503Google Scholar), and by disruption of the interactions of F-actin with caldesmon (10Fujii T. Machino K. Andoh H. Satoh T. Kondo Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 107: 133-137Google Scholar) and calponin (11Fujii T. Oomatsuzawa A. Kuzumaki N. Kondo Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 121-127Google Scholar). S100B has been implicated in the calcium-dependent binding of at least 20 target proteins in mammals (1Donato R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 637-668Google Scholar). However, because many of these target proteins have been identified only by in vitro methods, they require identification in vivo and a rationale for physiological relevance. In many cases, the S100B recognition site on putative targets has been characterized by the peptide chemical pattern +OXO*XOO (+ = basic, O = hydrophobic, * = hydrophilic, X = variable) which is found in the strong competitor peptide TRTKIDWNKILS (TRTK-12) (12Ivanenkov V.V. Jamieson Jr., G.A. Gruenstein E. Dimlich R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14651-14658Google Scholar, 13McClintock K.A. Shaw G.S. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2043-2046Google Scholar). During our study of the mechanism(s) by which S100B recognizes its target proteins, we observed that human S100B expressed in bacteria causes a filamentation phenotype, which is likely the result of a specific interaction with one or more bacterial proteins. Our initial candidate was the protein FtsZ, the evolutionary precursor to tubulin. FtsZ is required for the division of bacteria, archaea, chloroplasts, and the mitochondria of some algae (14Beech P.L. Nheu T. Schultz T. Herbert S. Lithgow T. Gilson P.R. McFadden G.I.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 111-119Google Scholar). When FtsZ is nonfunctional or under-expressed, bacteria form long filaments lacking signs of invagination at the division sites (24Begg K.J. Donachie W.D. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 615-622Google Scholar, 25Dai K. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3500-3506Google Scholar, 26Ma X. Ehrhardt D.W. Margolin W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12998-13003Google Scholar). Multinuclear filaments can also be formed when FtsZ is over-expressed (27Ward Jr., J.E. Lutkenhaus J. Cell. 1985; 42: 941-949Google Scholar) or misdirected to secondary division sites by defects in the proteins of the minB locus (28de Boer P.A.J. Crossley R.E. Rothfield L.I. Cell. 1989; 56: 641-649Google Scholar). However, this phenotype is characterized by the additional presence of anucleate mini-cells, which are not observed when FtsZ is dysfunctional or under-expressed. Evidence that FtsZ is the evolutionary precursor to tubulin (reviewed in Ref. 29Addinall S.G. Holland B. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 219-236Google Scholar) includes their similar GTPase sequence motifs, enzymatic activities (30de Boer P. Crossley R. Rothfield L. Nature. 1992; 359: 254-256Google Scholar, 31Raychaudhuri D. Park J.T. Nature. 1992; 359: 251-254Google Scholar, 32Nogales E. Downing K.H. Amos L.A. Lowe J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 451-458Google Scholar), and three-dimensional structures (32Nogales E. Downing K.H. Amos L.A. Lowe J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 451-458Google Scholar, 33Lowe J. Amos L.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 203-206Google Scholar, 34Lowe J. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 124: 235-243Google Scholar). As well, bacterial FtsZ in vitro can form structures resembling protofilaments, rings, and tubes, similar to those formed by tubulin (35Lowe J. Amos L.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2364-2371Google Scholar, 36Lowe J. Amos L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 993-999Google Scholar, 37Lu C. Reedy M. Erickson H.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 164-170Google Scholar, 38Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2754-2758Google Scholar). One structure is a bundle of 6–7 FtsZ protofilaments that forms the septal ring as the first step in bacterial septation (39Lu C. Stricker J. Erickson H.P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40: 71-86Google Scholar, 40Lu C. Erickson H.P. Methods Enymol. 1998; 298: 305-313Google Scholar). This FtsZ ring provides the scaffold upon which at least nine proteins (FtsA, ZipA, FtsK, FtsQ, FtsL, YgbQ, FtsW, FtsI, and FtsN) sequentially assemble to form the division apparatus (41Chen J.C. Beckwith J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 395-413Google Scholar, 42Hale C.A. de Boer P.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2552-2556Google Scholar, 43Buddelmeijer N. Judson N. Boyd D. Mekalanos J.J. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6316-6321Google Scholar, 44Pichoff S. Lutkenhaus J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 685-693Google Scholar). FtsZ then provides either the mechanical force that causes constriction and eventual pinching off of the daughter cells, or it forms the rigid framework against which the force will be applied (37Lu C. Reedy M. Erickson H.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 164-170Google Scholar). The proteins FtsA and ZipA, which bind to FtsZ independently of each other, are not required for assembly of the FtsZ ring, but they stabilize the bundle and recruit other proteins to the division site (44Pichoff S. Lutkenhaus J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 685-693Google Scholar, 45Hale C.A. Rhee A.C. de Boer P.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5153-5166Google Scholar). In a further analogy to tubulin function, ZipA is the bacterial homologue of the microtubule-associated protein, tau, (45Hale C.A. Rhee A.C. de Boer P.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5153-5166Google Scholar, 46RayChaudhuri D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2372-2383Google Scholar, 47Erickson H.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 55-60Google Scholar), whereas FtsA (along with the cell-shaped regulator protein MreB) is a homologue of actin (22van den Ent F. Amos L.A. Lowe J. Nature. 2001; 413: 39-44Google Scholar, 48van den Ent F. Lowe J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5300-5307Google Scholar, 49Llorca O. Martín-Benito J. Gómez-Puertas P. Ritco-Vonsovici M. Willison K.R. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 205-218Google Scholar). Thus, the similarities between the bacterial cytoskeletal proteins to those of eukaryotes have become even more compelling since the original discovery of FtsZ. The identification of in vivo protein interactions with the calcium-binding protein S100B, and indeed many of the other S100 proteins, has proven difficult. Because the interactions are transient, and modulated by calcium, traditional methods such as yeast two-hybrid experiments have failed to identify interacting target proteins (50Deloulme J.C. Gentil B.J. Baudier J. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2003; 60: 560-568Google Scholar). The single exception is S100A10, which does not bind calcium and undergoes a calcium-insensitive interaction with the phospholipid-binding protein annexin AII (51Koltzscher M. Gerke V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9533-9539Google Scholar). Further, the high sequence similarity of the S100s limits studies using monoclonal antibodies. In addition, several of the S100 proteins, including S100B, S100A6, and S100A11, have the ability to form heterodimeric S100 species in vivo, thus complicating protein interaction analyses because interactions can in principle occur with either homo- or heterodimeric S100 species. Because the S100 proteins are restricted to vertebrates, one method of addressing protein interactions and biological function of these proteins is through the use of a lower non-vertebrate species. In this regard, Escherichia coli is particularly attractive because the bacterium contains homologues of many of the proposed S100B interacting proteins, especially those involved in cytoskeletal assembly, but lacks all S100 protein homologues. Thus, protein interactions and their effect on function in E. coli can be studied for S100B without interference from other S100 proteins. In this study, we present in vivo and in vitro evidence demonstrating the physical interaction between the calcium-binding protein S100B and the cytoskeletal tubulin homologue FtsZ found in E. coli. This interaction interferes with bacterial division, causing a filamentous phenotype as a result of missed rounds of cell division. Plasmids and Bacteria—S100B, S100B-EGFP, 1The abbreviations used are: EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside; TRTK-12, TRTKIDWNKILS; DIC, differential interference contrast; S100B-EGFP, S100B protein with a C-terminal EGFP fusion. and FtsZ proteins were expressed in E. coli strain N99, a galK derivative of K-12 (52Mizusawa H. Lee C.-H. Kakefuda T. Mutat. Res. 1981; 82: 47-57Google Scholar). S100B bearing a C-terminal fusion of EGFP (Clontech) was made by inserting the BamHI-NotI segment of EGFP-N1 (Clontech) site into a version of expression plasmid pSS2 (53Smith S.P. Barber K.R. Dunn S.D. Shaw G.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8805-8814Google Scholar) modified to have a BglII restriction site replace the S100B stop codon. The S100B-EGFP protein has a hexapeptide linker (DPPVAT) between the S100B and EGFP moieties. A soluble EGFP-protein (sol-EGFP) was constructed by digesting the pS100B-EGFP plasmid with NcoI and re-ligating the plasmid. Most of the S100B protein is removed except for the first 6 residues of helix I (SELEKA) fused in-frame to the last 13 residues of helix IV (MVTTACHEFFEHE), followed by the DPPVAT linker. The E. coli FtsZ gene was amplified by PCR using strain N99 DNA as template. PCR primers based on the FtsZ sequence in strain K-12 (54Blattner F.R. Plunkett G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. A. G.M. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Google Scholar) were designed to introduce BamHI (forward, 5′-GGTGGTGGTGGATCCGGAGAGAAACTATGTTTGAACCAATGGAACTTACC-3′) and HindIII (reverse, 5′-AAATTCCAGTCAAAGCTTAATCAGCTTGCTTACGCAGG-3′) restriction sites for cloning into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) for sequencing. This was also done to obtain an EcoRI restriction site upstream of the BamHI site for construction of the FtsZ expression plasmid pFtsZ-Nex by replacement of the S100B gene in pSS2 with the FtsZ gene. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All proteins were confirmed by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Protein Purification—S100B was purified as described previously (53Smith S.P. Barber K.R. Dunn S.D. Shaw G.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8805-8814Google Scholar, 55Ferguson P.L. Shaw G.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3637-3646Google Scholar). S100B-EGFP required a modification in the purification protocol in which a 30% cut of ammonium sulfate was selected for further purification. FtsZ was purified essentially as described by Mukherjee and Lutkenhaus (56Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 296-305Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli strain N99 cells bearing pFtsZ-Nex were grown in 1 liter of LB medium with 40 μg/ml carbenicillin to an A600 reading of 0.5 and were then induced with 1 mm IPTG for 5 h. Bacteria were pelleted and stored at -80 °C. Bacteria were lysed by French press, and the FtsZ protein was suspended in TKC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) during purification and storage. FtsZ protein purity was 80–90% based on SDS-PAGE. Inclusion Body Assay—The presence of inclusions was tested by a modification of a well established method (57Davis G.D. Harrison R.G. Vaillancourt P.E. E. coli Gene Expression Protocols. Vol. 205. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2003: 141-154Google Scholar). N99 cells bearing S100B, S100B-EGFP, or FtsZ expression plasmids were grown in 20 ml of LB medium with 40 μg/ml carbenicillin to an A600 reading of 0.6. Cultures were induced with 1 mm IPTG for 4 h, then pelleted, resuspended in 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, and stored at -80 °C. Bacteria were thawed in the presence of 20 mg phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and ruptured by French press. The lysates were split into 5-ml fractions. One was retained as a total cell fraction. The other fraction was centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 13,000 × g, and 3 ml of the supernatant was carefully transferred to a new tube; the remainder was poured off, and the pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of the above buffer. A 100-μl portion of each fraction was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid for SDS-PAGE analysis. Fluorescence Microscopy—Bacteria expressing the S100B constructs were grown overnight in LB medium containing 40 μg/ml carbenicillin. Following this, bacteria were diluted 50- to 100-fold and grown to an A600 = 0.1. Protein expression was induced by IPTG added to final concentrations of 1 μm, 10 μm, 20 μm, 100 μm, 400 μm, and 1 mm. In cases of extended induction periods, bacteria were diluted at intervals (“pseudochemostat”) to maintain cells in mid-log phase. Induced bacteria were harvested at intervals and stored at 4 °C for microscopy later that day or for use up to 1 week later, with no apparent change in viability or phenotype. Bacteria were also fixed by 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and stored overnight at 4 °C. The fixed bacteria were pelleted, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated several hours at 4 °C with 2.5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 to stain the bacterial DNA. Bacteria (10 μl) were mounted on slides coated with a dried film of 2% agarose. Co-localization experiments using polyclonal anti-S100B (ICN) were performed on poly-l-lysine-coated slides as described by Mukherjee and Lutkenhaus (56Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 296-305Google Scholar). Using goat anti-rabbit Alexa594 (Molecular Probes) as the fluorescent secondary antibody, images were captured using a 100× Neoplan oil immersion objective on a Zeiss Axioskop 2 MOT microscope equipped with a QImaging Retiga 1300™ cooled charge-coupled device (Mississauga, Canada). Images were processed using Northern Eclipse, version 6.0 (Empix Imaging, Inc., Mississauga, Canada) and Adobe Photoshop™ LE (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). Affinity Chromatography—Human S100B (10 mg) was cross-linked to a 1-ml HiTrap™ N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated HP column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's directions. The column was equilibrated with TKC buffer prior to loading the FtsZ protein. After overnight washing with 70–80 ml of the TKC buffer (0.15 ml/min), in which 2-ml fractions of flow-through were collected for analysis, bound protein was eluted with TKE buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm EDTA). For the peptide binding competition assay, peptide TRTK-12 was prepared at 2 mg/ml in TKC buffer, and 2 ml were loaded onto the column and washed extensively with TKC buffer prior to loading FtsZ. Western Blotting—Bacterial proteins eluted from the S100B affinity column were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and prepared for SDS-PAGE and transblotting as described previously (58Ferguson P.L. Coombs D.H. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2880-2892Google Scholar). To correlate FtsZ expression levels to induced production of S100B-EGFP, 0.2-ml portions of bacterial cultures were pelleted in a microcentrifuge and resuspended in 30 μl of 1.5× Laemmli buffer for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The proteins were probed with 1:2000 diluted rabbit anti-FtsZ (kindly provided by W. Margolin) and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Filamenting Phenotype—The N99 strain of E. coli used in this study is typical of the species in terms of its morphology. When grown in rich medium, the bacteria have a diameter of 0.6 μm and range in length between 2 and 3 μm, depending on their stage in the division cycle. Wild-type human S100B expression induced by 1 mm IPTG causes a filamenting phenotype in the bacteria (Fig. 1A), which is also observed at lower induction levels (20 μm IPTG) over longer periods of time for expression of S100B and S100B-EGFP (Fig. 1, B and C). The control protein, sol-EGFP, which contains two short segments of S100B fused in-frame to EGFP (see “Experimental Procedures”), does not cause the filamenting phenotype (Fig. 1D), even at 1 mm IPTG induction (not shown), and the fluorescence is uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm (not shown), indicating the EGFP moiety is a passive marker. This result is consistent with previous reports of uniform EGFP localization throughout the bacterial cytoplasm (26Ma X. Ehrhardt D.W. Margolin W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12998-13003Google Scholar). Many of the elongated cells show no signs of constriction associated with septation. However, within the population, there are bacteria of the normal size distribution, indicating either that some proper septation does occur or some bacteria have been cured of the plasmid because of its deleterious effects. The filamentation caused by S100B and S100B-EGFP is similar to that observed when FtsZ is dysfunctional or under-expressed (24Begg K.J. Donachie W.D. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 615-622Google Scholar, 25Dai K. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3500-3506Google Scholar, 26Ma X. Ehrhardt D.W. Margolin W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12998-13003Google Scholar), including the presence of some normal-length bacteria. This suggests that S100B may recognize the tubulin ancestor, FtsZ, and interfere with its normal function. Co-localization Studies—To test the in vivo interaction between S100B and FtsZ, the intracellular localization of S100B was monitored by using the S100B-EGFP fusion protein. Previous studies showed the ability of FtsZ-GFP fusions to monitor septum assembly is strongly dependent upon the expression level of the fusion protein (59Sun Q. Margolin W. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2050-2056Google Scholar). With this in mind, and because we wanted to test the tunability of S100B-EGFP expression, N99 cells bearing the S100B-EGFP plasmid were induced for 4 h with various concentrations of IPTG. Between 0–100 μm IPTG, there is a positive correlation between S100B-EGFP expression levels and the severity of the filamenting phenotype (not shown). Induction with 10 μm IPTG yielded a population of cells with a distribution of lengths from normal size to 4-, 8-, and 16-times longer than normal. In the filaments, the fluorescent foci of S100B-EGFP localization occur at the poles and along the cell, with a spacing of 2–3 μm and interspersed daughter nucleoids (Fig. 2A). The fluorescence from the S100B-EGFP protein forms foci close to the membrane and broad bands that span the cell diameter. This banded pattern within elongated filaments is similar to that observed by immunofluorescence studies of FtsZ dynamics and localization (59Sun Q. Margolin W. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2050-2056Google Scholar, 60Addinall S.G. Cao C. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4277-4284Google Scholar, 61Sun Q. Margolin W. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1413-1422Google Scholar, 62Levin P.A. Schwartz R.L. Grossman A.D. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5449-5452Google Scholar) and is, in fact, indistinguishable from the FtsZ-EGFP fusion protein distribution (see Figure 3 in Ref. 26Ma X. Ehrhardt D.W. Margolin W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12998-13003Google Scholar). The polar localization of S100B-EGFP is consistent with FtsZ mislocalization to bacterial poles under certain conditions (26Ma X. Ehrhardt D.W. Margolin W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12998-13003Google Scholar, 27Ward Jr., J.E. Lutkenhaus J. Cell. 1985; 42: 941-949Google Scholar). The pattern of S100B-EGFP expression at increasing IPTG concentrations argues against an inclusion body explanation (see below), because in a small fraction of the uninduced bacteria, low level (“leaky”) expression of the S100B-EGFP fusion protein from the plasmid's strong tac promoter results in very small, distinct fluorescent foci at one or both poles of the normal-length cells, with occasional mid-cell positioning in cells that are long enough to be dividing (not shown). Polar localization of S100B-EGFP occurs at all levels of IPTG induction, but between 1–100 μm, the polar foci do not become larger; rather, foci become more numerous and spaced along the bacterial filaments. Further, protein structures within bacteria can be observed under visible light by careful manipulation of light intensity, gain, and offset parameters during digital DIC microscopy. The fluorescent foci of S100B-EGFP within the filament in Fig. 2A are visible by light microscopy (Fig. 2B), and the pattern is indistinguishable from that formed by unlabeled FtsZ over-expressed in the N99 cells (Fig. 2C).Fig. 3Low-level expression of cloned S100B (3 h with 20 μm IPTG) results in mostly normal-size bacteria with sharp mid-cell bands detected by anti-S100B.

These structures are similar to those containing FtsZ polymers that are formed in E. coli (26Ma X. Ehrhardt D.W. Margolin W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2002; 109: 257-266Google Scholar), indicating S100B and FtsZ occupy similar locations in the cell. Finally, S100B localization in the bacteria was detected by immunolabeling permeabilized bacteria with anti-S100B and a fluorescent secondary antibody. The bacteria were induced by low levels of IPTG to allow for normal bacterial division to occur and to have a normal distribution of bacterial lengths. The helical structures observed in bacteria expressing S100B-EGFP are not the result of the EGFP fusion, because similar helices are detected by the anti-S100B immunolabeling of bacteria expressing S100B (Fig. 2, G–I). More importantly, a number of bacteria exhibit a single bright, sharp mid-cell band consistent with S100B co-localization at the septum (Fig. 3). In some cases of advanced cell division, fluorescent immunolabeling is observed in the elongated constriction between the dividing cells (Fig. 3, Inset). Intracellular Levels of FtsZ—The levels of FtsZ in E. coli have been estimated to be between 5000 (67Pla J. Sanchez M. Palacios P. Vicente M. Aldea M. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1681-1686Google Scholar) and 15,000 copies per bacterium (40Lu C. Erickson H.P. Methods Enymol. 1998; 298: 305-313Google Scholar), with little apparent fluctuation during the division cycle (29Addinall S.G. Holland B. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 219-236Google Scholar, 68Aldea M. Garrido T. Pla J. Vicente M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3787-3794Google Scholar, 69Garrido T. Sanchez M. Palacios P. Aldea M. Vicente M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3957-3965Google Scholar). Over-expression of FtsZ causes either toxic effects (56Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 296-305Google Scholar) or the phenotype of mini-cells and filamentation (27Ward Jr., J.E. Lutkenhaus J. Cell. 1985; 42: 941-949Google Scholar), whereas under-expression of FtsZ results in filamentation only (25Dai K. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3500-3506Google Scholar). Although the above experiments are consistent with an interaction of S100B with FtsZ, it is possible that expression of S100B (or S100B-EGFP) might alter FtsZ protein levels. This was tested by inducing S100B-EGFP expression with IPTG and comparing the levels of FtsZ and S100B-EGFP at intervals after the induction (Fig. 4). S100B-EGFP expression increase"
https://openalex.org/W2127875900,"A locus control region (LCR) is a cis-acting gene-regulatory element capable of transferring the expression characteristics of its gene locus of origin to a linked transgene. Furthermore, it can do this independently of the site of integration in the genome of transgenic mice. Although most LCRs contain subelements with classical transcriptional enhancer function, key aspects of LCR activity are supported by cis-acting sequences devoid of the ability to act as direct transcriptional enhancers. Very few of these ""non-enhancer"" LCR components have been characterized. Consequently, the sequence requirements and molecular bases for their functions, as well as their roles in LCR activity, are poorly understood. We have investigated these questions using the LCR from the mouse T cell receptor (<i>TCR)</i> α/<i>Dad1</i> gene locus. Here we focus on DNase hypersensitive site (HS) 6 of the TCRα LCR. HS6 does not support classical enhancer activity, yet has gene regulatory activity in an <i>in vivo</i> chromatin context. We have identified three <i>in vivo</i> occupied factor-binding sites within HS6, two of which interact with Runx1 and Elf-1 factors. Deletion of these sites from the LCR impairs its activity <i>in vivo</i>. This mutation renders the transgene locus abnormally inaccessible in chromatin, preventing the normal function of other LCR subelements and reducing transgene mRNA levels. These data show these factor-binding sites are required for preventing heterochromatin formation and indicate that they function to maintain an active TCRα LCR assembly <i>in vivo</i>."

In the enzymatically active form aerobic Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase is a complex of homodimeric R1 and R2 proteins. We use electrochemical studies of the dinuclear center to clarify the interplay of subunit interaction, the binding of allosteric effectors and substrate selectivity. Our studies show for the first time that electrochemical reduction of active R2 generates a distinct Met form of the diiron cluster, with a midpoint potential (-163 ± 3 mV) different from that of R2Met produced by hydroxyurea (-115 ± 2 mV). The redox potentials of both Met forms experience negative shifts when measured in the presence of R1, becoming -223 ± 6 and -226 ± 3 mV, respectively, demonstrating that R1-triggered conformational changes favor one configuration of the diiron cluster. We show that the association of a substrate analog and specificity effector (dGDP/dTTP or GMP/dTTP) with R1 regulates the redox properties of the diiron centers in R2. Their midpoint potential in the complex shifts to -192 ± 2 mV for dGDP/dTTP and to -203 ± 3 mV for GMP/dTTP. In contrast, reduction potential measurements show that the diiron cluster is not affected by ATP (0.35–1.45 mm) and dATP (0.3–0.6 mm) binding to R1.

Allosteric regulation ensures a balanced dNTP pool needed for DNA replication and repair. At present, three major classes of RNRs have been identified that differ in their protein structure and in the cofactors essential for catalysis (1Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 171-198Google Scholar). Despite these differences, all RNRs catalyze the reduction of ribonucleotides by similar radical-based mechanisms, including formation of a transient thiyl radical at the active site that in turn produces a transient 3′-substrate radical (2Stubbe J. van der Donk W.A. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 705-762Google Scholar). In class I enzymes, it is proposed that the thiyl radical within the R1 subunit is formed during each catalytic cycle via long range electron/proton transfer from a stable tyrosyl radical located in the R2 subunit (1Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 171-198Google Scholar, 2Stubbe J. van der Donk W.A. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 705-762Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of aerobic Escherichia coli RNR, which belongs to the class I RNR like the mammalian enzyme, depends on the formation of the complex between the two different proteins, R1 (α2) and R2 (β2), and is regulated by the binding of dNTPs and ATP, which act as allosteric effectors. The R1 homodimer carries two types of regulatory sites in addition to the catalytic binding site. Overall activity is stimulated by ATP and inhibited by dATP through the binding of these effectors to the activity site (3Brown N.C. Reichard P. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 39-55Google Scholar). The regulation of substrate specificity involves a second type of positive regulatory site, called the specificity site, which binds dTTP, dGTP, dATP, and ATP. Binding of effectors to this site modulates either substrate selectivity or rate of reduction. With ATP or dATP bound, the enzyme catalyzes the reduction of pyrimidine nucleotides (CDP and UDP). With dTTP bound to the specificity site GDP is the preferred substrate, whereas binding of dGTP favors ADP reduction (4Eriksson S. Sjöberg B.-M. Herve G. Allosteric Enzymes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 189-215Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structures of R1 complexed with an ATP analog, the specificity effector dTTP, and the substrate GDP in combination with dTTP have identified the two allosteric sites and the catalytic site (5Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Ramasswamy S. Ekberg M. Regnström K. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1077-1092Google Scholar). Crystallographic data suggest that during catalysis R1 undergoes significant conformational changes that dictate the redox cycling of the catalytic redox-active cysteines and the adjustment of the catalytic site for the selected substrate (5Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Ramasswamy S. Ekberg M. Regnström K. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1077-1092Google Scholar, 6Eklund H. Uhlin U. Färnegardh M. Logan D.T. Nordlund P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 177-268Google Scholar). In addition, substrate binding is shown to occur only to the reduced form of R1. The E. coli R2 protein harbors in each of its two polypeptide chains an essential free radical at Tyr-122 and a non-heme diferric center. The function of the metal site appears to be the generation and stabilization of the radical (7Bollinger Jr., J.M. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Filley J. Norton J.R. Stubbe J. Science. 1991; 253: 292-298Google Scholar, 8Bollinger Jr., J.M. Tonge W.H. Ravi N. Huynh B.H. Edmondson D.E. Stubbe J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 8015-8023Google Scholar, 9Bollinger Jr., J.M.

Soc. 1994; 116: 8007-8014Google Scholar). Protein R2 having the tyrosyl radical reduced to normal tyrosine is called Met-R2 (R2Met) and is enzymatically inactive. Reduction of the cluster and subsequent oxidation by molecular oxygen are required for the generation of the radical from Met-R2. In E. coli, a flavin reductase supplies the electrons needed for the reduction of the Met cluster (11Fontecave M. Eliasson R. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12325-12331Google Scholar). Many different R2 structures are available, including different states of the wild type protein (i.e. apo-, Met-, red-R2) and various mutant forms, but there is no crystal structure of R2 containing the radical (6Eklund H. Uhlin U. Färnegardh M. Logan D.T. Nordlund P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 177-268Google Scholar, 12Nordlund P. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 123-164Google Scholar, 13Logan T. Su X.D. Aberg A. Rengström K. Hajdu J. Eklund H. Nordlund P. Structure. 1996; 4: 1053-1064Google Scholar, 14Nordlund P. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Nature. 1990; 345: 593-598Google Scholar). Formation of the R1-R2 complex allows the controlled delivery of the radical function from Tyr-122 in R2 to Cys-439 in R1 via the proposed hydrogen-bonded path (12Nordlund P. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 123-164Google Scholar, 14Nordlund P. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Nature. 1990; 345: 593-598Google Scholar). The process of radical transfer to the active site occurs only when substrate and effectors are present, to prevent uncontrolled redox processes and loss of the radical. The R1-R2 complex has not yet been structurally characterized. Kinetic studies of truncated R2 and R2 C-terminal peptides have determined that R1 and R2 interact primarily via the C-terminal 30 amino acids in R2 (15Climent I. Sjöberg B.-M. Huang C.Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4801-4807Google Scholar). A model of the complex was developed on the basis of docking studies, and the crystal structure of R1 co-crystallized with synthetic 20-residue peptide corresponding to the C terminus of R2 (16Uhlin U. Eklund H. Nature. 1994; 370: 533-539Google Scholar). According to this model the C terminus of R2 binds into a cleft in R1, thus completing the specific electron transfer path between the two subunits required for radical shuttling. Unfortunately, no significant spectroscopic changes are observed upon complex formation between R1 and R2 (17Backes G. Sahlin M. Sjoberg B.-M. Loher T.M. Sanders-Loher J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 28: 1923-1929Google Scholar, 18Sahlin M. Petersson L. Gräslund A. Ehrenberg A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5541-5548Google Scholar). Moreover, in wild type RNR reactions the tyrosyl radical is always present, and no change in the radical spectroscopic properties is detected with naturally occurring substrates. Nevertheless, the redox potential of the diiron site shifts to a considerably more negative value upon complex formation between R2Met and R1, and the hydrogen bonding pathway proposed to operate during catalysis may involve at least one of the ferric ions (12Nordlund P. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 123-164Google Scholar, 16Uhlin U. Eklund H. Nature. 1994; 370: 533-539Google Scholar, 19Sjöberg B.-M. Struct. Bonding. 1997; 88: 139-173Google Scholar, 20Silva K.E. Elgren T.E. Que Jr., L. Stankovich M.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14093-14103Google Scholar). This shift in the redox potential is the only evidence to date of a conformational change at the metal/radical site induced by R1 binding. In this work we test the hypothesis that the activity of the R1-R2 complex can be modulated by conformational changes at the dinuclear center induced by binding of substrate and allosteric regulators to R1. By studying the conformational transitions of the diiron centers in different regulatory states of the enzyme, we can gain insight into the interactions that promote long range electron transfer in RNR. The redox properties of the active radical-containing R2 and its complex with R1 are determined and then compared with those obtained in the presence of ATP, dATP, dGDP/dTTP, and GMP/dTTP. These observations are discussed in terms of the factors known to affect electron/proton transfer during turnover and enzyme regulation. Materials—ATP-, dATP-, dTTP-, dGDP-, and GMP-magnesium or sodium salt were purchased from Sigma. All nucleotides have purity higher than 97%. Dyes used for electrochemical studies are as follows: methyl viologen (BDH); riboflavin (Sigma); 8-Cl riboflavin (the generous gift from J. P. Lambooy, University of Maryland); lumiflavin 3-acetate was a generous gift from Sandro Ghisla, University of Konstanz, Germany. DTT, HU, and HEPES (free acid), both ultra-grade, were purchased from Sigma. Protein Preparation—R2 was isolated from E. coli N6405/pSPS2, an overproducing strain kindly provided by Prof. JoAnne Stubbe, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. R1 was isolated from E. coli overproducing strain C600/pLSH1 and was kindly provided by Dr. B.-M. Sjöberg, from the Department of Molecular Biology and Functional Genetics, Stockholm University, Sweden. Purification of R1 and R2 was as described elsewhere (21Sjöberg B.-M. Hahne S. Karlsson M. Jornvall H. Goranssen M. Uhlin B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 56658-56662Google Scholar, 22Larsson A. Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17780-17784Google Scholar) except for the final ultradialysis buffer, which was HEPES, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol. Protein R1 was kept reduced during the purification by addition of 2 mm DTT to all buffers. The concentration was increased to 10 mm DTT for samples to be stored at -80 °C. Purification was monitored by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining. Protein concentrations for R1 and R2 were determined using the absorbance at 280 nm minus the absorbance at 310 nm and the extinction coefficients (ϵ280–310) 180,000 m-1 cm-1 for R1 and 120,000 m-1 cm-1 for R2. The concentration of iron bound to the protein was determined based on the absorbance at 370 nm and the extinction coefficient ϵ370 = 8750 m-1 cm-1. The radical content was quantitated by the method of Bollinger et al. (7Bollinger Jr., J.M. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Filley J. Norton J.R. Stubbe J. Science. 1991; 253: 292-298Google Scholar). The iron content in isolated R2 was determined to be 3.4–3.6 Fe/R2 and the tyrosyl free radical corresponded to 1.3 radical equivalents per R2 dimer. Spectroelectrochemistry for Reduction Potential Measurements—Potentiometric redox experiments were performed using an anaerobic 3-electrode spectroelectrochemical cell described previously (20Silva K.E. Elgren T.E. Que Jr., L. Stankovich M.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14093-14103Google Scholar, 23Stankovich M.T. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 109: 295-308Google Scholar). All experiments were conducted at pH 7.4 and 4 °C in 25 mm HEPES buffer containing 5% glycerol and 0.09 mm methyl viologen, added to mediate electron transfer. 8-Cl riboflavin (-107 ± 3 mV), riboflavin (-166 ± 3 mV), and lumiflavin 3-acetate (-197 ± 3 mV) were used to facilitate equilibration between the protein and working electrode. Solutions were made anaerobic through several cycles of argon and vacuum over a total period of 2 h. These experimental conditions were the same as those applied in our previous redox measurements of R2Met and its complex with R1 (20Silva K.E. Elgren T.E. Que Jr., L. Stankovich M.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14093-14103Google Scholar). The protein concentrations used in all present studies were about 18–22 μm radical containing R2 and 24–28 μm R1, a 1.1–1.3 m excess of R1 was used to ensure complete complex formation based on studies showing that R1 and R2 components form a 1:1 complex of active enzyme with dissociation constant of 0.09–0.18 μm (15Climent I. Sjöberg B.-M. Huang C.Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4801-4807Google Scholar). Concentrations of 2–4 μm were used for indicator dyes, selected to cover the experimental potential range of protein titration, with a starting volume of 5 ml. The reaction mixture for typical R1-R2 experiments contained a final concentration of 0.35 mm DTT. At pH 7.4 DTT does not affect the properties of the diiron centers (24Fontecave M. Gerez C. Mansuy D. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10919-10924Google Scholar). The effect of substrate analogs and allosteric effector binding on the redox potential of the active R1-R2 complex was determined in the presence of saturating amounts of the physiological ligands (25Ormö M. Sjöberg B.-M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 138-141Google Scholar). R1 in solution was present as an effector or effector/substrate analog-saturated complex prior to the addition of R2. The standard incubation mixture was used with the activity effector ATP added at variable concentrations (0.35, 0.6, 0.7, and 1.45 mm) or with the negative effector dATP at concentrations 0.3, 0.4, and 0.6 mm. Reductive titrations of R1-R2ox with substrate analogs dGDP (2.6–3.0 mm) or GMP (3.0–3.4 mm) were performed in the presence of 45 μm dTTP (a specificity effector). Mg2+ ions are required for complex formation between R1 and R2 and for enzyme activity. In our experiments Mg2+ concentration used was 0.35 or 0.7 mm in experiments with ATP and dATP and 0.35 mm in experiments with substrate analog/specificity effector. The equilibrium potential was determined to be stabilized when the measured potential changed by less than ±1 mV per 30 min. All potential values reported herein are referred to as the standard hydrogen electrode at 25 °C. 4 mV were added to the final values for temperature correction (20Silva K.E. Elgren T.E. Que Jr., L. Stankovich M.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14093-14103Google Scholar). The Nernst equation (Equation 1) was applied to calculate the midpoint potential (Em) of the diiron cluster in R2 from the plot of E versus log([Enzox]/([Enzred]). Em is obtained from the intercept. In this equation, E is the measured equilibrium potential at each point in the titration; [Enzox] and [Enzred] represent the concentration of oxidized and reduced enzyme species, determined at 370 nm by UV-visible spectroscopy, at each point in the titration; and n = 2 is the number of electrons required to interconvert the diiron center between oxidized and reduced states. E=Em+(0.054/n)log([Enzox]/[Enzred])(Eq. 1) UV-visible measurements were made on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda 12 Spectrophotometer with a thermostated cell compartment and PerkinElmer Life Sciences Computerized Spectroscopy Software (PECSS), version 4.31, was used for spectral acquisition and manipulation The bioanalytical system BAS-100 electrochemical analyzer was used for potentiometric titrations. All collected UV-visible spectra were corrected for turbidity and dye contributions. All the potential data reported here are believed to be accurate, because the Nernst plots obtained are close to the ideal, and this is the most rigorous criterion for achievement of equilibrium. The observed shifts in the potential are thought to be representative of the expected complexes as almost no turbidity was observed during redox experiments. Miscellanea—Structural diagrams were constructed using the program WebLab from crystallographic coordinate files deposited in the Protein Data Bank. The files 1R1B (diferric R2), 1MXR (diferric R2), 1X1K (diferrous R2), and 1AV8 (Tyr-122 → Phe R2) were used. R2 can exist in one of three stable redox states, the fully oxidized active R2ox form [Fe(III)Fe(III)... TyrO·], the one-electron reduced R2Met form [Fe(III)Fe(III)... TyrOH], and the fully reduced R2red form [Fe(II)Fe(II)]. The midpoint potential of the inactive Met form of R2 produced by reduction of R2ox with the radical scavenger HU was measured in our previous work for both free R2Met and its complex with R1 (20Silva K.E. Elgren T.E. Que Jr., L. Stankovich M.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14093-14103Google Scholar). In this work we extend those studies to the enzymatically active radical containing R2ox and to the Met form obtained from the electrochemical reduction of R2ox. We designate as R2Met,c the form of R2Met produced by reduction of R2ox with HU and as R2Met,e the form produced during the reductive titration of R2ox. The electrochemical reductive titration of R2ox occurs as two distinct processes. The first one corresponds to the one-electron reduction of the tyrosyl radical, at a potential of 1.0 ± 0.1 V (20Silva K.E. Elgren T.E. Que Jr., L. Stankovich M.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14093-14103Google Scholar) to generate R2Met,e (Fig. 1). R2Met,e is subsequently reduced to R2red at a potential Em = -163 ± 3 mV (Table I) in a single two-electron process, as indicated by a slope of 35 mV in the corresponding Nernst plot (Fig. 1, inset). This value is about 50 mV more negative than the one previously recorded for the R2Met,c/R2red couple (-115 mV) (20Silva K.E. Elgren T.E. Que Jr., L. Stankovich M.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14093-14103Google Scholar). Exposure of the protein thus reduced to air leads to oxidation by O2 and regeneration of R2ox. A second titration carried out on the same sample generates an identical titration curve with the same potential (Em = -166 ± 3 mV). Under the equilibrium conditions utilized for potentiometric experiments, the heterogeneity of metal sites previously seen in kinetic experiments is not observed (26Miller M.A. Gobena F.T.

Similarly to the free R2ox, the R1-R2 complex is reduced in two stages. The first stage corresponds to the one-electron reduction of the tyrosyl radical to generate R2Met,e. The potential of this reduction step is approximately ∼1.0 V, as in the case of free R2ox. It is important to note that this value is an estimate, with limited accuracy (26Miller M.A. Gobena F.T. Kauffmann K. Munck E. Que Jr., L. Stankovich M.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 1096-1097Google Scholar), and changes of the order of 10s of mV induced by R1 binding would go undetected. The second stage corresponds to the two-electron reduction of R1-R2Met,e to R1-R2red. The midpoint potential for this step was determined to be -223 ± 6 mV (Table I), corresponding to a shift of 60 mV relative to the uncomplexed protein. By comparison, reductive titration of the R1-R2Met,c complex, involving the chemically generated Met form, provides a reduction potential of -226 ± 3 mV, virtually identical to the value measured for R1-R2Met,e. The redox properties of the diiron centers in the R1-R2ox complex were investigated in the presence of the allosteric effectors ATP (general activator) and dATP (general inhibitor). As for the R1-R2 complex in the absence of effectors, reduction of the radical is observed first, at ∼1.0 V, to generate the Met protein, followed by bielectronic reduction to the diferrous form. The midpoint potential values for the Met form in the R1-R2 complex associated with ATP (at concentrations 0.35, 0.6, 0.7, and 1.45 mm) or dATP (at concentrations 0.3, 0.4, and 0.6 mm) were determined to be -215 ± 5 and -216 ± 3 mV, respectively (Table I). A slope of 30–34 mV was obtained in the Nernst plots, which compares reasonably with the theoretical slope of 27 mV for a two-electron transfer process. Overall, the potentiometric titration of both R1-R2/ATP and R1-R2/dATP gives redox potentials that are nearly identical to the ones exhibited by the R1-R2ox complex in the absence of effectors. Exposure of the reduced complex to air at the end of the titration resulted in generation of the characteristic spectrum of R2ox, showing 60% recovered radical for the dATP complex and 40–50% for the ATP complex. The midpoint potential of the diiron cluster in the R1-R2Met,e complex examined in the presence of dGDP/dTTP or GMP/dTTP was determined to be -192 ± 2 and -203 ± 3 mV, respectively (Table I), appreciably lower than the value obtained in the absence of nucleotides (Fig. 2, dGDP/dTTP-complex is shown). As in the other measurements reported in this work, the potential traces show a Nernstian behavior, corresponding to a bielectronic reduction (28–31 mV slope for the Nernst plot; Fig. 2, inset). Addition of air to the reduced complex at the end of the titration regenerated R2ox with 60% recovery. As a reference, Table II (Supplemental Material) lists the different redox forms of R2 discussed in this work and their preparation. Effect of Tyrosine Reduction Mode on the Redox Properties of the Diiron Centers in R2Met—In our previous work we studied R2Met obtained from the reduction of R2ox with HU (now called R2Met,c). In contrast, in the current set of experiments we generate R2Met by electrochemical reduction of R2ox (now called R2Met,e). A difference in redox potentials of about 50 mV is reported, indicating that the Met form obtained via electrochemical reduction of R2ox is different from the form obtained via chemical reduction. To our knowledge this is the first time that the properties of the dinuclear center in R2Met are explicitly related to the mode of tyrosine reduction. Nonetheless, analysis of past published work is consistent with this observation. Studies of R2ox inhibition by several reducing agents have shown that different classes of reactants followed different kinetics, suggesting that different reduction mechanisms were at play (24Fontecave M.

Sykes G.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2206-2212Google Scholar). It is believed that the use of organic radicals (for example derived from methyl viologen, riboflavin, and phenosafranin) reproduces the conditions for reduction in vivo via long range outer-sphere electron transfer (30Dobbing A.M. Borman C.D. Twitchett M.B. Leese D.N. Salmon G.A. Sykes G.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2206-2212Google Scholar). This is also the condition realized in the electrochemical cell, where methyl viologen/flavins are employed to favor electron transfer from the electrode surface to the protein. In contrast, the involvement of a different mechanism of radical reduction has been proposed for HU on the basis of differences observed in reduction kinetics (12Nordlund P. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 123-164Google Scholar). A different reduction mechanism can account for the formation of R2Met forms with different metal clusters. R2Met,e and R2Met,c are likely to be distinguished by changes in water coordination, hydrogen bonding, and/or reorientation of the amino acid side chains coordinated to iron. Comparison of the published structures of R2Met reveals differences among different structures in first and outer sphere geometry of the dinuclear site (Fig. 3, a and b). The most obvious variations are observed in H-bonding between the radical bearing Tyr-122 and the iron ligand Asp-84 and in the coordination geometry of Asp-84 around the iron center (12Nordlund P. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 123-164Google Scholar, 14Nordlund P. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Nature. 1990; 345: 593-598Google Scholar, 31Högbom M. Galander M. Andersson M. Kolberg M. Fofbauer W.

Galander M. Andersson M. Kolberg M. Fofbauer W. Lassmann G. Nordlund P. Lendzian F. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Different protocols were used to generate the different Met forms reported above, neither of which included HU or electrochemical reduction. 2Pär Nordlund, personal communication. Nonetheless, the variations indicate that this region of the dinuclear cluster is particularly sensitive to the way an electron is delivered to the radical. In this respect, it is interesting to compare the redox potential of R2Met,e and R2Met,c with the previously determined values for the R2 mutant Tyr-122 → Phe (20Silva K.E. Elgren T.E. Que Jr., L.

https://openalex.org/W2084787149,"The chicken c-mil/raf-1 gene (formerly also known as c-mht) was originally identified in the search for the cellular counterpart to the v-mil oncogene of the Mill Hill 2 retrovirus and was among the first cellular proto-oncogenes discovered. Although the c-mil/raf-1 promotor, as well as the exons transduced into v-mil, were characterized in detail, an entire map of this locus has never been published. Here, we now report the location of five previously unmapped exons. In addition, we have noticed inconsistent numbering of the c-mil/raf-1 exons in the literature and the GenBank database. Thus, we provide here a complete map of the c-mil/raf-1 gene and a revision of the exon numbers. Comparison of the chicken c-mil/raf-1 gene with those of other vertebrates suggests that the numbers and lengths of the translated exons of the raf-1 locus were established early in the vertebrate lineage and have been conserved during the divergent evolution of teleosts and tetrapods."
