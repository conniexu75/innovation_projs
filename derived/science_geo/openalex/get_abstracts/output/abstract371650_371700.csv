https://openalex.org/W2022495743,"Obesity and its associated comorbidities, termed metabolic syndrome, are increasingly prevalent, and they pose a serious threat to the health of individuals and populations. Gene-environment interactions have been scrutinized since the kinetics of the increased prevalence of obesity would argue against a purely genetic etiology. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), widely expressed and highly conserved transmembrane receptors, are at the intersection of diet and metabolism, and may therefore be important determinants of weight gain and its sequellae. We sought specifically to determine the role of Tlr2 in the development of obesity and metabolic syndrome utilizing two dietary models that approximate contemporary diet compositions. Using C57BL/6 Hsd mice (wild type, WT) and mice with a targeted mutation in Tlr2 (Tlr2(-/-)), we showed that mice lacking TLR2 are substantially protected from diet-induced adiposity, insulin resistance, hypercholesterolemia, and hepatic steatosis. In adipose tissue, Tlr2 deletion was associated with attenuation of adipocyte hypertrophy, as well as diminished macrophage infiltration and inflammatory cytokine expression.-Himes, R. W., Smith, C. W. Tlr2 is critical for diet-induced metabolic syndrome in a murine model."

Although nicotine is generally thought to have limited ability to initiate cancer, it can induce cell proliferation and angiogenesis in a variety of systems. These properties might enable nicotine to facilitate the growth of tumors already initiated. Here we show that nicotine significantly promotes the progression and metastasis of tumors in mouse models of lung cancer. This effect was observed when nicotine was administered through intraperitoneal injections, or through over-the-counter transdermal patches.In the present study, Line1 mouse adenocarcinoma cells were implanted subcutaneously into syngenic BALB/c mice. Nicotine administration either by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection or transdermal patches caused a remarkable increase in the size of implanted Line1 tumors. Once the tumors were surgically removed, nicotine treated mice had a markedly higher tumor recurrence (59.7%) as compared to the vehicle treated mice (19.5%). Nicotine also increased metastasis of dorsally implanted Line1 tumors to the lungs by 9 folds. These studies on transplanted tumors were extended to a mouse model where the tumors were induced by the tobacco carcinogen, NNK. Lung tumors were initiated in A/J mice by i.p. injection of NNK; administration of 1 mg/kg nicotine three times a week led to an increase in the size and the number of tumors formed in the lungs. In addition, nicotine significantly reduced the expression of epithelial markers, E-Cadherin and beta-Catenin as well as the tight junction protein ZO-1; these tumors also showed an increased expression of the alpha(7) nAChR subunit. We believe that exposure to nicotine either by tobacco smoke or nicotine supplements might facilitate increased tumor growth and metastasis.Our earlier results indicated that nicotine could induce invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cultured lung, breast and pancreatic cancer cells. This study demonstrates for the first time that administration of nicotine either by i.p. injection or through over-the-counter dermal patches can promote tumor growth and metastasis in immunocompetent mice. These results suggest that while nicotine has only limited capacity to initiate tumor formation, it can facilitate the progression and metastasis of tumors pre-initiated by tobacco carcinogens."

Integrin adhesiveness for the extracellular matrix is activated by the cytoskeletal protein talin via direct binding of its phosphotyrosine-binding-like F3 domain to the cytoplasmic tail of the β integrin subunit. The phosphotyrosine-binding domain of the signaling protein Dok1, on the other hand, has an inactivating effect on integrins, a phenomenon that is modulated by integrin tyrosine phosphorylation. Using full-length tyrosine-phosphorylated 15N-labeled β3, β1A, and β7 integrin tails and an NMR-based protein-protein interaction assay, we show that talin1 binds to the NPXY motif and the membrane-proximal portion of β3, β1A, and β7 tails, and that the affinity of this interaction is decreased by integrin tyrosine phosphorylation. Dok1 only interacts weakly with unphosphorylated tails, but its affinity is greatly increased by integrin tyrosine phosphorylation. The Dok1 interaction remains restricted to the integrin NPXY region, thus phosphorylation inhibits integrin activation by increasing the affinity of β integrin tails for a talin competitor that does not form activating membrane-proximal interactions with the integrin. Key residues governing these specificities were identified by detailed structural analysis, and talin1 was engineered to bind preferentially to phosphorylated integrins by introducing the mutation D372R. As predicted, this mutation affects talin1 localization in live cells in an integrin phosphorylation-specific manner. Together, these results indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation is a common mechanism for regulating integrin activation, despite subtle differences in how these integrins interact with their binding proteins.

https://openalex.org/W1982193071,"Background and Aims microRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate cognate mRNAs post-transcriptionally. miRNAs have been implicated in regulating gene expression in embryonic developmental processes, including proliferation and differentiation. The liver is a multifunctional organ, which undergoes rapid changes during the developmental period and relies on tightly-regulated gene expression. Little is known regarding the complex expression patterns of both mRNAs and miRNAs during the early stages of human liver development, and the role of miRNAs in the regulation of this process has not been studied. The aim of this work was to study the impact of miRNAs on gene expression during early human liver development. Methods Global gene and miRNA expression were profiled in adult and in 9–12w human embryonic livers, using high-density microarrays and quantitative RT-PCR. Results Embryonic liver samples exhibited a gene expression profile that differentiated upon progression in the developmental process, and revealed multiple regulated genes. miRNA expression profiling revealed four major expression patterns that correlated with the known function of regulated miRNAs. Comparison of the expression of the most regulated miRNAs to that of their putative targets using a novel algorithm revealed a significant anti-correlation for several miRNAs, and identified the most active miRNAs in embryonic and in adult liver. Furthermore, our algorithm facilitated the identification of TGFβ-R1 as a novel target gene of let-7. Conclusions Our results uncover multiple regulated miRNAs and genes throughout human liver development, and our algorithm assists in identification of novel miRNA targets with potential roles in liver development."

https://openalex.org/W2098879441,"Pmel17 is a transmembrane protein that mediates the early steps in the formation of melanosomes, the subcellular organelles of melanocytes in which melanin pigments are synthesized and stored. In melanosome precursor organelles, proteolytic fragments of Pmel17 form insoluble, amyloid-like fibrils upon which melanins are deposited during melanosome maturation. The mechanism(s) by which Pmel17 becomes competent to form amyloid are not fully understood. To better understand how amyloid formation is regulated, we have defined the domains within Pmel17 that promote fibril formation <i>in vitro</i>. Using purified recombinant fragments of Pmel17, we show that two regions, an N-terminal domain of unknown structure and a downstream domain with homology to a polycystic kidney disease-1 repeat, efficiently form amyloid <i>in vitro</i>. Analyses of fibrils formed in melanocytes confirm that the polycystic kidney disease-1 domain forms at least part of the physiological amyloid core. Interestingly, this same domain is also required for the intracellular trafficking of Pmel17 to multivesicular compartments within which fibrils begin to form. Although a domain of imperfect repeats (RPT) is required for fibril formation <i>in vivo</i> and is a component of fibrils in melanosomes, RPT is not necessary for fibril formation <i>in vitro</i> and in isolation is unable to adopt an amyloid fold in a physiologically relevant time frame. These data define the structural core of Pmel17 amyloid, imply that the RPT domain plays a regulatory role in timing amyloid conversion, and suggest that fibril formation might be physically linked with multivesicular body sorting."
https://openalex.org/W1973984431,"Nascent mRNAs produced by transcription in the nucleus are subsequently processed and packaged into mRNA ribonucleoprotein particles (messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs)) before export to the cytoplasm. Here, we have used the poly(A)-binding protein Nab2 to isolate mRNPs from yeast under conditions that preserve mRNA integrity. Upon Nab2-tandem affinity purification, several mRNA export factors were co-enriched (Yra1, Mex67, THO-TREX) that were present in mRNPs of different size and mRNA length. High-throughput sequencing of the co-precipitated RNAs indicated that Nab2 is associated with the bulk of yeast transcripts with no specificity for different mRNA classes. Electron microscopy revealed that many of the mRNPs have a characteristic elongated structure. Our data suggest that mRNPs, although associated with different mRNAs, have a unifying core structure."
https://openalex.org/W2008416870,"Natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in the antitumoral responses through cytolytic function and cytokine production. Expression of HLA-G at the surface of tumoral cells confers a protection against NK-cell cytolysis through its interaction with the ILT2 inhibitory receptor. Even though the role of this interaction on the inhibition of NK-cell cytotoxicity is well established, its effect on the molecular events occurring at the NK/target-cell synapse is not well characterized. We found that the interaction of the inhibitory receptor ILT2 with HLA-G inhibited the polarization of NK-cell lytic granules and the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) as well as the accumulation of filamentous actin (F-actin) at the area of contact. However, it did not affect the recruitment of the activatory receptor CD2 at the NK/target-cell interface. Even though CD2 was accumulated to the NK-cell synapse, the interaction of ILT2 with HLA-G efficiently inhibited intracellular calcium mobilization and IFN-gamma polarized production of NK cells. These results indicate that while the ILT2/HLA-G interaction leads to the inhibition of NK-cell functions, it displays differential effects on cytoskeleton reorganization and CD2 localization at the NK-cell synapse.-Favier, B., LeMaoult, J., Lesport, E., Carosella, E. D. ILT2/HLA-G interaction impairs NK-cell functions through the inhibition of the late but not the early events of the NK-cell-activating synapse."
https://openalex.org/W2038081912,"Exposure to exercise or to environmental enrichment increases the generation of new neurons in the adult hippocampus and promotes certain kinds of learning and memory. While the precise role of neurogenesis in cognition has been debated intensely, comparatively few studies have addressed the mechanisms linking environmental exposures to cellular and behavioral outcomes. Here we show that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling mediates the effects of exercise on neurogenesis and cognition in the adult hippocampus. Elective exercise reduces levels of hippocampal BMP signaling before and during its promotion of neurogenesis and learning. Transgenic mice with decreased BMP signaling or wild type mice infused with a BMP inhibitor both exhibit remarkable gains in hippocampal cognitive performance and neurogenesis, mirroring the effects of exercise. Conversely, transgenic mice with increased BMP signaling have diminished hippocampal neurogenesis and impaired cognition. Exercise exposure does not rescue these deficits, suggesting that reduced BMP signaling is required for environmental effects on neurogenesis and learning. Together, these observations show that BMP signaling is a fundamental mechanism linking environmental exposure with changes in cognitive function and cellular properties in the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2108607349,"SMARCAL1 (also known as HARP) is a SWI/SNF family protein with an ATPase activity stimulated by DNA containing both single-stranded and double-stranded regions. Mutations in SMARCAL1 are associated with the disease Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia, a multisystem autosomal recessive disorder characterized by T cell immunodeficiency, growth inhibition, and renal dysfunction. The cellular function of SMARCAL1, however, is unknown. Here, using Xenopus egg extracts and mass spectrometry, we identify SMARCAL1 as a protein recruited to double-stranded DNA breaks. SMARCAL1 binds to double-stranded breaks and stalled replication forks in both egg extract and human cells, specifically colocalizing with the single-stranded DNA binding factor RPA. In addition, SMARCAL1 interacts physically with RPA independently of DNA. SMARCAL1 is phosphorylated in a caffeine-sensitive manner in response to double-stranded breaks and stalled replication forks. It has been suggested that stalled forks can be stabilized by a mechanism involving caffeine-sensitive kinases, or they collapse and subsequently recruit Rad51 to promote homologous recombination repair. We show that depletion of SMARCAL1 from U2OS cells leads to increased frequency of RAD51 foci upon generation of stalled replication forks, indicating that fork breakdown is more prevalent in the absence of SMARCAL1. We propose that SMARCAL1 is a novel DNA damage-binding protein involved in replication fork stabilization.

IntroductionThe cellular response to DNA damage is a complicated meshwork of pathways that have evolved to halt the progression of the cell cycle and process and repair the damaged DNA (1.Hoeijmakers J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (3114) Google Scholar). A critical component in a number of these DNA damage response pathways, including the response to double-stranded breaks (DSBs) 4The abbreviations used are: DSBdouble-stranded breakSIODSchimke immuno-osseous dysplasiassDNAsingle-stranded DNARPAreplication protein AhRPAhuman RPAMSmass spectrometrydsDNAdouble-stranded DNAMS/MStandem MSSB-DNAsingle biotin DNADB-DNAdouble biotin DNASH-DNAsingle hairpin DNAHUhydroxyureaPCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenGygraysATRATM and Rad3-related kinasesiRNAsmall interfering RNAGFPgreen fluorescent protein. and stalled replication forks, is single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) coated with the ssDNA binding factor replication protein A (RPA), a heterotrimer consisting of 70-, 32-, and 14-kDa subunits (2.Fanning E. Klimovich V. Nager A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4126-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). ssDNA accumulates following DSB formation due to resection by nucleases and helicases and is quickly coated in RPA filaments (3.Mimitou E.P. Symington L.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2009; 34: 264-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). RPA is replaced subsequently with RAD51, which initiates strand exchange in the homologous recombination pathway. In addition to its role in DNA repair, RPA-coated ssDNA is believed to provide a binding site for the ATM and Rad3-related kinase (ATR) and the ATR-interacting protein (ATRIP), allowing the activation of ATR and initiation of damage checkpoint and repair pathways (4.Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar).Long tracts of ssDNA also form at stalled replication forks by the dissociation of replicative helicases from stalled DNA polymerases (5.Byun T.S. Pacek M. Yee M.C. Walter J.C. Cimprich K.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1040-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 6.Pacek M. Walter J.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). RPA-coated ssDNA helps to activate the ATR-dependent replication checkpoint, which stabilizes stalled forks (7.Paulsen R.D. Cimprich K.A. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 953-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In the absence of the replication checkpoint in yeast, stalled forks convert to aberrant structures detectable by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis (8.Lopes M. Cotta-Ramusino C. Pellicioli A. Liberi G. Plevani P. Muzi-Falconi M. Newlon C.S. Foiani M. Nature. 2001; 412: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). At least some of these structures, as observed by electron microscopy, are four-way junctions resulting from annealing the complementary daughter strands, called reversed forks or chickenfoot structures (9.Sogo J.M. Lopes M. Foiani M. Science. 2002; 297: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). A chickenfoot can be resolved by a Holliday junction endonuclease to create a DSB, which must then be repaired, following recruitment of RAD51, by homologous recombination. However, the exact mechanisms that control replication fork stabilization and the steps of fork collapse remain unclear.To better understand the proteins and dynamics involved in the DNA damage response, we used extract from the eggs of the frog Xenopus laevis to identify proteins bound to DSBs (10.Postow L. Ghenoiu C. Woo E.M. Krutchinsky A.N. Chait B.T. Funabiki H. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). By incubating linearized plasmid bound to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads in egg extract, we were able to isolate DNA damage response complexes. These complexes could then be analyzed using mass spectrometry (MS) and other biochemical tools. Using this approach, we have identified SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily A-like 1 (SMARCAL1) as a novel DSB-binding protein.SMARCAL1, also known as HepA-related protein (HARP) and DNA-dependent ATPase A, was originally identified as an ATPase activity biochemically isolated from calf thymus (11.Hockensmith J.W. Wahl A.F. Kowalski S. Bambara R.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7812-7821Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The SMARCAL1 ATPase is stimulated by DNA containing both ssDNA and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) regions (12.Coleman M.A. Eisen J.A. Mohrenweiser H.W. Genomics. 2000; 65: 274-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13.Muthuswami R. Truman P.A. Mesner L.D. Hockensmith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7648-7655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). SMARCAL1 exists in species ranging from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans, but there is no yeast homologue. It contains a C-terminal SWI/SNF helicase domain as well as HARP homology domains. The SMARCAL1 SWI/SNF subfamily is most closely related to the prokaryotic HepA/RapA SWI/SNF subfamily (12.Coleman M.A. Eisen J.A. Mohrenweiser H.W. Genomics. 2000; 65: 274-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). HepA/RapA is an RNA polymerase-associated protein suggested to be involved in recycling transcription complexes (14.Shaw G. Gan J. Zhou Y.N. Zhi H. Subburaman P. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Jin D.J. Ji X. Structure. 2008; 16: 1417-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Recently, it has been shown that purified SMARCAL1 is able to catalyze the reannealing of single-stranded regions of a plasmid that are held apart by RPA (15.Yusufzai T. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 2008; 322: 748-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This led to the proposal that SMARCAL1 is an “annealing helicase,” because it has not been observed to have strand separation activity. SMARCAL1 has also been identified as the gene responsible for the autosomal-recessive multisystem disorder Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD) (16.Boerkoel C.F. Takashima H. John J. Yan J. Stankiewicz P. Rosenbarker L. André J.L. Bogdanovic R. Burguet A. Cockfield S. Cordeiro I. Fründ S. Illies F. Joseph M. Kaitila I. Lama G. Loirat C. McLeod D.R. Milford D.V. Petty E.M. Rodrigo F. Saraiva J.M. Schmidt B. Smith G.C. Spranger J. Stein A. Thiele H. Tizard J. Weksberg R. Lupski J.R. Stockton D.W. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). SIOD is characterized by T-cell immunodeficiency, renal dysfunction, and growth failure, among other phenotypes (17.Spranger J. Hinkel G.K. Stöss H. Thoenes W. Wargowski D. Zepp F. J. Pediatr. 1991; 119: 64-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The cellular function of SMARCAL1, however, remains unknown.We show here that SMARCAL1 is a component of the DNA damage response. We demonstrate that it interacts with damaged DNA and stalled replication forks in both Xenopus egg extract and human nuclei and that it specifically colocalizes and interacts with RPA. SMARCAL1 contains at its N terminus a motif known to interact with the C-terminal domain of RPA32, and this sequence is required for SMARCAL1 to bind to DSBs. In addition, SMARCAL1 becomes phosphorylated in response to DNA damage checkpoints. Finally, collapse of stalled replication forks appears to be more frequent in the absence of SMARCAL1. We propose that SMARCAL1 is a novel DNA damage-binding protein and that it plays a role in the stabilization of stalled replication forks. A possible role for this function in the phenotype of SIOD is discussed.DISCUSSIONThe cell-free system of X. laevis egg extract allows the purification and MS/MS analysis of DNA repair complexes, an important tool for the discovery of novel damage-binding proteins and post-translational modifications on damage-bound proteins. Here we described the use of this method to identify SMARCAL1 as a component of the DNA damage response. Our evidence for this is as follows. First, SMARCAL1 binds to DSBs and stalled replication forks in vivo; second, it is phosphorylated as a result of the DNA damage checkpoint response following generation of DSBs and stalled forks; third, like many DNA damage response proteins, it interacts physically with the ssDNA binding factor RPA; and finally, the absence of SMARCAL1 enhances RAD51 association with stalled replication forks in mammalian cells, indicating that a greater number of broken forks are entering the homologous recombination pathway.Recently, it has been shown that purified SMARCAL1 is capable of catalyzing the reannealing of separated strands of a plasmid held apart by RPA molecules (15.Yusufzai T. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 2008; 322: 748-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The authors proposed that the enzyme acts directly on the DNA in the reverse reaction to that of a helicase, thus forcing off the RPA. Alternatively, SMARCAL1 may remove RPA from the DNA, allowing the complementary strands to anneal. Evidence against this model includes the observations that SMARCAL1 ATPase activity is not stimulated by RPA and that SMARCAL1 only removes RPA when the action is linked to annealing of complementary strands (15.Yusufzai T. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 2008; 322: 748-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).Our evidence suggests that SMARCAL1 is involved in replication fork stabilization, and the observed in vitro activity could play a role in this. An annealing helicase activity might help to stabilize stalled forks by maintaining daughter-parent strand pairing and preventing alternative DNA structures, such as reversed forks (Fig. 7). Loss of this activity would lead to increased fork breakdown, the generation of DSBs, and, consequently, RAD51 loading. Another possibility, however, is that SMARCAL1 acts after replication forks have collapsed. In this scenario, SMARCAL1 might be acting as an antagonist to RAD51 binding and homologous recombination. Further studies will be required to distinguish between these two possibilities.Interestingly, we have found that SMARCAL1 contains an N-terminal motif known to interact with the 32-kDa subunit of RPA. Although SMARCAL1 interacted with RPA in the absence of DNA, this motif was not required for this interaction. This observation is not necessarily surprising, because many proteins that interact with RPA do so with more than one subunit. More striking, however, was the fact that this N-terminal region was absolutely required for SMARCAL1 to bind to DSBs in both Xenopus egg extracts and U2OS cells. This observation is particularly surprising, because the N-terminal region of SMARCAL1 is not required for DNA-stimulated ATPase activity in vitro (13.Muthuswami R. Truman P.A. Mesner L.D. Hockensmith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7648-7655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It seems likely, therefore, that an interaction with the RPA32 C-terminal domain is important for association of SMARCAL1 with damage in vivo, perhaps because RPA obscures ssDNA binding sites. RPA-coated DNA is not, however, sufficient for SMARCAL1-DNA interactions, because SMARCAL1 does not interact with single-stranded DNA beads, although RPA does (data not shown).Many SWI/SNF family proteins are involved in the DNA damage response, including Rad54 (37.San Filippo J. Sung P. Klein H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 229-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar), Ino80 (38.Morrison A.J. Highland J. Krogan N.J. Arbel-Eden A. Greenblatt J.F. Haber J.E. Shen X. Cell. 2004; 119: 767-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), and the mammalian SWI/SNF complex (39.Park J.H. Park E.J. Lee H.S. Kim S.J. Hur S.K. Imbalzano A.N. Kwon J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3986-3997Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, our observations of SMARCAL1 suggest that it is functionally more closely related to members of the RecQ helicase family. The RecQ helicases BLM and WRN show a localization pattern similar to that of SMARCAL1 and also physically interact with RPA (40.Bachrati C.Z. Hickson I.D. Chromosoma. 2008; 117: 219-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The sole RecQ family member in yeast, Sgs1, helps to prevent the formation of aberrant Rad51-dependent DNA structures at stalled replication forks (41.Liberi G. Maffioletti G. Lucca C. Chiolo I. Baryshnikova A. Cotta-Ramusino C. Lopes M. Pellicioli A. Haber J.E. Foiani M. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). How RecQ helicases function to stabilize and/or repair stalled forks is still largely unknown (40.Bachrati C.Z. Hickson I.D. Chromosoma. 2008; 117: 219-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that BLM is involved in the formation or removal of chickenfoot structures (42.Ralf C. Hickson I.D. Wu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22839-22846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and both BLM and WRN can catalyze chickenfoot formation in vitro (42.Ralf C. Hickson I.D. Wu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22839-22846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 43.Machwe A. Xiao L. Groden J. Orren D.K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 5729-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition to helicase activity, RecQ proteins have intrinsic ATP-dependent strand annealing activity (45.Cheok C.F. Wu L. Garcia P.L. Janscak P. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3932-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 46.Garcia P.L. Liu Y. Jiricny J. West S.C. Janscak P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2882-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), which may be similar to the activity that Yusufzai and Kadonaga observed for SMARCAL1 (15.Yusufzai T. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 2008; 322: 748-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Alternatively, SMARCAL1 may function similarly to the yeast anti-recombinase Srs2, a helicase that inhibits the accumulation of recombination proteins at replication forks (47.Burgess R.C. Lisby M. Altmannova V. Krejci L. Sung P. Rothstein R. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 969-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Srs2 acts by removing Rad51 from DNA (48.Krejci L. Van Komen S. Li Y. Villemain J. Reddy M.S. Klein H. Ellenberger T. Sung P. Nature. 2003; 423: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 49.Veaute X. Jeusset J. Soustelle C. Kowalczykowski S.C. Le Cam E. Fabre F. Nature. 2003; 423: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar); further studies are required to determine if SMARCAL1 can perform this function.It is unclear whether loss of the DSB- and fork-binding activities of SMARCAL1 or an as yet unknown cellular function of the protein is responsible for the symptoms of SIOD. There is apparently no cancer predisposition in patients with the disease and no obviously detectable defects in DNA repair (50.Boerkoel C.F. O'Neill S. André J.L. Benke P.J. Bogdanovíć R. Bulla M. Burguet A. Cockfield S. Cordeiro I. Ehrich J.H. Fründ S. Geary D.F. Ieshima A. Illies F. Joseph M.W. Kaitila I. Lama G. Leheup B. Ludman M.D. McLeod D.R. Medeira A. Milford D.V. Ormälä T.

Pediatr. 2000; 159: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), which is consistent with our inability to detect significant sensitivity to γ or UV irradiation in SMARCAL1-depleted U2OS cells.5 It seems likely that if SMARCAL1 is functional at DSBs, it is largely redundant with another protein or proteins. Interestingly, short stature is a feature of SIOD, indicating that the complicated disease phenotype may be caused by defective cell proliferation in select tissues (51.Clewing J.M. Antalfy B.C. Lücke T. Najafian B. Marwedel K.M. Hori A. Powel R.M. Do A.F. Najera L. SantaCruz K. Hicks M.J. Armstrong D.L. Boerkoel C.F. J. Med. Genet. 2007; 44: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that these cell proliferation defects could be a consequence of the collapse of replication forks in SMARCAL1-deficient cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, short stature is also present in Bloom syndrome, and Werner syndrome patients display slow growth (52.Bohr V.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 609-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Further study will be required to definitively determine whether destabilized replication forks contribute to this or other aspects of the SIOD phenotype.Note Added in ProofRecent work by Yusufzai et al.

IntroductionThe cellular response to DNA damage is a complicated meshwork of pathways that have evolved to halt the progression of the cell cycle and process and repair the damaged DNA (1.Hoeijmakers J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (3114) Google Scholar). A critical component in a number of these DNA damage response pathways, including the response to double-stranded breaks (DSBs) 4The abbreviations used are: DSBdouble-stranded breakSIODSchimke immuno-osseous dysplasiassDNAsingle-stranded DNARPAreplication protein AhRPAhuman RPAMSmass spectrometrydsDNAdouble-stranded DNAMS/MStandem MSSB-DNAsingle biotin DNADB-DNAdouble biotin DNASH-DNAsingle hairpin DNAHUhydroxyureaPCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenGygraysATRATM and Rad3-related kinasesiRNAsmall interfering RNAGFPgreen fluorescent protein. and stalled replication forks, is single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) coated with the ssDNA binding factor replication protein A (RPA), a heterotrimer consisting of 70-, 32-, and 14-kDa subunits (2.Fanning E. Klimovich V. Nager A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4126-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). ssDNA accumulates following DSB formation due to resection by nucleases and helicases and is quickly coated in RPA filaments (3.Mimitou E.P. Symington L.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2009; 34: 264-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). RPA is replaced subsequently with RAD51, which initiates strand exchange in the homologous recombination pathway. In addition to its role in DNA repair, RPA-coated ssDNA is believed to provide a binding site for the ATM and Rad3-related kinase (ATR) and the ATR-interacting protein (ATRIP), allowing the activation of ATR and initiation of damage checkpoint and repair pathways (4.Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar).Long tracts of ssDNA also form at stalled replication forks by the dissociation of replicative helicases from stalled DNA polymerases (5.Byun T.S. Pacek M. Yee M.C. Walter J.C. Cimprich K.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1040-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 6.Pacek M. Walter J.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). RPA-coated ssDNA helps to activate the ATR-dependent replication checkpoint, which stabilizes stalled forks (7.Paulsen R.D. Cimprich K.A. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 953-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In the absence of the replication checkpoint in yeast, stalled forks convert to aberrant structures detectable by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis (8.Lopes M. Cotta-Ramusino C. Pellicioli A. Liberi G. Plevani P. Muzi-Falconi M. Newlon C.S. Foiani M. Nature. 2001; 412: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). At least some of these structures, as observed by electron microscopy, are four-way junctions resulting from annealing the complementary daughter strands, called reversed forks or chickenfoot structures (9.Sogo J.M. Lopes M. Foiani M. Science. 2002; 297: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). A chickenfoot can be resolved by a Holliday junction endonuclease to create a DSB, which must then be repaired, following recruitment of RAD51, by homologous recombination. However, the exact mechanisms that control replication fork stabilization and the steps of fork collapse remain unclear.To better understand the proteins and dynamics involved in the DNA damage response, we used extract from the eggs of the frog Xenopus laevis to identify proteins bound to DSBs (10.Postow L. Ghenoiu C. Woo E.M. Krutchinsky A.N. Chait B.T. Funabiki H. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). By incubating linearized plasmid bound to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads in egg extract, we were able to isolate DNA damage response complexes. These complexes could then be analyzed using mass spectrometry (MS) and other biochemical tools. Using this approach, we have identified SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily A-like 1 (SMARCAL1) as a novel DSB-binding protein.SMARCAL1, also known as HepA-related protein (HARP) and DNA-dependent ATPase A, was originally identified as an ATPase activity biochemically isolated from calf thymus (11.Hockensmith J.W. Wahl A.F. Kowalski S. Bambara R.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7812-7821Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The SMARCAL1 ATPase is stimulated by DNA containing both ssDNA and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) regions (12.Coleman M.A. Eisen J.A. Mohrenweiser H.W. Genomics. 2000; 65: 274-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13.Muthuswami R. Truman P.A. Mesner L.D. Hockensmith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7648-7655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). SMARCAL1 exists in species ranging from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans, but there is no yeast homologue. It contains a C-terminal SWI/SNF helicase domain as well as HARP homology domains. The SMARCAL1 SWI/SNF subfamily is most closely related to the prokaryotic HepA/RapA SWI/SNF subfamily (12.Coleman M.A. Eisen J.A. Mohrenweiser H.W. Genomics. 2000; 65: 274-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). HepA/RapA is an RNA polymerase-associated protein suggested to be involved in recycling transcription complexes (14.Shaw G. Gan J. Zhou Y.N. Zhi H. Subburaman P. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Jin D.J. Ji X. Structure. 2008; 16: 1417-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Recently, it has been shown that purified SMARCAL1 is able to catalyze the reannealing of single-stranded regions of a plasmid that are held apart by RPA (15.Yusufzai T. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 2008; 322: 748-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This led to the proposal that SMARCAL1 is an “annealing helicase,” because it has not been observed to have strand separation activity. SMARCAL1 has also been identified as the gene responsible for the autosomal-recessive multisystem disorder Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD) (16.Boerkoel C.F. Takashima H. John J. Yan J. Stankiewicz P. Rosenbarker L. André J.L. Bogdanovic R. Burguet A. Cockfield S. Cordeiro I. Fründ S. Illies F. Joseph M. Kaitila I. Lama G. Loirat C. McLeod D.R. Milford D.V. Petty E.M. Rodrigo F. Saraiva J.M. Schmidt B. Smith G.C. Spranger J. Stein A. Thiele H. Tizard J. Weksberg R. Lupski J.R. Stockton D.W. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). SIOD is characterized by T-cell immunodeficiency, renal dysfunction, and growth failure, among other phenotypes (17.Spranger J. Hinkel G.K. Stöss H. Thoenes W. Wargowski D. Zepp F. J. Pediatr. 1991; 119: 64-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The cellular function of SMARCAL1, however, remains unknown.We show here that SMARCAL1 is a component of the DNA damage response. We demonstrate that it interacts with damaged DNA and stalled replication forks in both Xenopus egg extract and human nuclei and that it specifically colocalizes and interacts with RPA. SMARCAL1 contains at its N terminus a motif known to interact with the C-terminal domain of RPA32, and this sequence is required for SMARCAL1 to bind to DSBs. In addition, SMARCAL1 becomes phosphorylated in response to DNA damage checkpoints. Finally, collapse of stalled replication forks appears to be more frequent in the absence of SMARCAL1. We propose that SMARCAL1 is a novel DNA damage-binding protein and that it plays a role in the stabilization of stalled replication forks. A possible role for this function in the phenotype of SIOD is discussed. The cellular response to DNA damage is a complicated meshwork of pathways that have evolved to halt the progression of the cell cycle and process and repair the damaged DNA (1.Hoeijmakers J.H.

https://openalex.org/W2036545702,"Following exposure to various stresses (arsenite, UV, hyperthermia, and hypoxia), mRNAs are assembled into large cytoplasmic bodies known as ""stress granules,"" in which mRNAs and associated proteins may be processed by specific enzymes for different purposes like transient storing, sorting, silencing, or other still unknown processes. To limit mRNA damage during stress, the assembly of micrometric granules has to be rapid, and, indeed, it takes only approximately 10-20 min in living cells. However, such a rapid assembly breaks the rules of hindered diffusion in the cytoplasm, which states that large cytoplasmic bodies are almost immobile. In the present work, using HeLa cells and YB-1 protein as a stress granule marker, we studied three hypotheses to understand how cells overcome the limitation of hindered diffusion: shuttling of small messenger ribonucleoprotein particles from small to large stress granules, sliding of messenger ribonucleoprotein particles along microtubules, microtubule-mediated stirring of large stress granules. Our data favor the two last hypotheses and underline that microtubule dynamic instability favors the formation of micrometric stress granules."
https://openalex.org/W2073233675,"Pdx-1 (pancreatic-duodenal homeobox-1), a MODY4 homeodomain transcription factor, serves as a master regulator in the pancreas because of its importance during organogenesis and in adult islet insulin-producing beta cell activity. Here, we show that KLF11, an SP/Krüppel-like (SP/KLF) transcription factor, mutated in French maturity onset diabetes of the young patients (MODY7), regulates Pdx-1 transcription in beta cells through two evolutionarily conserved GC-rich motifs in conserved Area II, a control region essential to islet beta cell-enriched expression. These regulatory elements, termed GC1 (human base pair -2061/-2055) and GC2 (-2036/-2027), are also nearly identical to the consensus KLF11 binding sequence defined here by random oligonucleotide binding analysis. KLF11 specifically associates with Area II in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, while preventing binding to GC1- and/or GC2-compromised Pdx1-driven reporter activity in beta cell lines. Mechanistically, we find that KLF11 interacts with the coactivator p300 via its zinc finger domain in vivo to mediate Pdx-1 activation. Together, our data identified a hierarchical regulatory cascade for these two MODY genes, suggesting that gene regulation in MODY is more complex than anticipated previously. Furthermore, because KLF11 like most MODY-associated transcription factors uses p300, these data further support a role for this coactivator as a critical chromatin link in forms of type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2013888834,"Stick balancing at the fingertip is a powerful paradigm for the study of the control of human balance. Here we show that the mean stick balancing time is increased by about two-fold when a subject stands on a vibrating platform that produces vertical vibrations at the fingertip (0.001 m, 15-50 Hz). High speed motion capture measurements in three dimensions demonstrate that vibration does not shorten the neural latency for stick balancing or change the distribution of the changes in speed made by the fingertip during stick balancing, but does decrease the amplitude of the fluctuations in the relative positions of the fingertip and the tip of the stick in the horizontal plane, A(x,y). The findings are interpreted in terms of a time-delayed ""drift and act"" control mechanism in which controlling movements are made only when controlled variables exceed a threshold, i.e. the stick survival time measures the time to cross a threshold. The amplitude of the oscillations produced by this mechanism can be decreased by parametric excitation. It is shown that a plot of the logarithm of the vibration-induced increase in stick balancing skill, a measure of the mean first passage time, versus the standard deviation of the A(x,y) fluctuations, a measure of the distance to the threshold, is linear as expected for the times to cross a threshold in a stochastic dynamical system. These observations suggest that the balanced state represents a complex time-dependent state which is situated in a basin of attraction that is of the same order of size. The fact that vibration amplitude can benefit balance control raises the possibility of minimizing risk of falling through appropriate changes in the design of footwear and roughness of the walking surfaces."

IntroductionPlexins are single transmembrane receptors for guidance cues, called semaphorins, which regulate the motility and positional maintenance of certain cells. With this function, the receptors play critical roles in many developmental processes, including axon guidance, angiogenesis, and bone formation (1.Tamagnone L. Comoglio P.M.

Moreover, plexins and their ligands are also involved in the regulation of the immune response, in cancer progression, and are thought to restrain tissue regeneration after injury (3.Neufeld G.

An intracellular region that has high homology to Ras GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) 7The abbreviations used are: GAPGTPase-activating proteinRBDRho GTPase binding domain. facilitates the hydrolysis of R-Ras-bound GTP. This deactivation of R-Ras leads to functional inhibition of integrins and to a loss of cell adhesion in response to semaphorins (5.Oinuma I. Ishikawa Y. Katoh H. Negishi M.

Katoh H. Negishi M. Science. 2004; 305: 862-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), suggesting greater substrate specificity compared with the GAP protein p120GAP (9.Ohba Y. Mochizuki N.

How the plexin receptor is activated and specifically how the GAP function is regulated have been questions of considerable interest (10.Rohm B. Rahim B. Kleiber B. Hovatta I. Püschel A.W.

A number of studies have pointed to a sequence segment that interrupts the GAP-homologous region and is capable of binding small Rho family GTPases. In the case of plexin-B1, this Rho GTPase binding domain (RBD) can associate with Rnd1, Rac1, and RhoD, which are thought to regulate plexin function. Specifically, in vitro studies in a number of laboratories have used the intracellular region of plexins expressed as two fragments, named C1 (containing the RBD and an N-terminal GAP-homologous segment) and C2 (C-terminal GAP segment). The studies suggest that such fragments are loosely associated. Moreover, the interaction between the RBD and Rnd1 or Rac1 appears to separate the two fragments (5.Oinuma I. Ishikawa Y. Katoh H.

Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). Representative structures for all of the major families of small GTPase-activating proteins are known, and also by using mutagenesis, the catalytic residues involved have been identified (15.Bos J.L. Rehmann H. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 2007; 129: 865-877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). However, the GAP domain is often surrounded by other protein segments that are known to participate in cell signaling events, such as an SH2 domain in chimerins (16.Canagarajah B. Leskow F.C. Ho J.Y. Mischak H. Saidi L.F. Kazanietz M.G. Hurley J.H. Cell. 2004; 119: 407-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), C2 in SynGAP (17.Pena V. Hothorn M. Eberth A. Kaschau N.

Our understanding of how GAP activity is controlled is still limited, because not many structures that include regulatory domains have been determined to date.Characterizing the structure of the intracellular region of human plexin-B1 promises to elucidate the mechanism by which the RBD can control receptor signaling and the function of the GAP domain. The NMR solution conformation (19.Tong Y. Hughes D. Placanica L. Buck M. Structure. 2005; 13: 7-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 20.Tong Y. Hota P.K. Hamaneh M.B.

Chugha P. Hota P.K. Alviani R.S. Li M. Tempel W. Shen L. Park H.W. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37215-37224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). GTPase association with the RBD domain occurs at a common interface that is adjacent to the dimerization region. These observations combined with biophysical studies suggest that Rho GTPase binding can destabilize a dimeric form of the intracellular region of plexins. On the extracellular side, it has been proposed from the dimeric crystal structure of semaphorin-3A that ligand binding to the semaphorin-homologous region of plexin would cause a conformational rearrangement in the dimeric form of the receptor (22.Antipenko A. Himanen J.P. van Leyen K. Nardi-Dei V. Lesniak J. Barton W.A. Rajashankar K.R. Lu M. Hoemme C. Püschel A.W. Nikolov D.B.

It is also known that Rac1 binding to the cytoplasmic plexin-B1 RBD increases ligand binding on the cell surface (23.Vikis H.G. Li W. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Together, these studies led to the refinement of a model for plexin activation that involves the destabilization of a RBD-mediated intracellular region dimer and explained the observed synergy between ligand binding and GTPase-dependent regulation of these receptors (21.Tong Y. Chugha P. Hota P.K. Alviani R.S. Li M. Tempel W. Shen L. Park H.W. Buck M. J. Biol.

The role of the different domains is investigated by a combination of biophysical, computational, and functional studies. The protein is monomeric and has a single GAP domain fold with the RBD placed on its side. A detailed comparison also with the structure of the isolated dimeric RBD region and with the RBD bound to Rnd1 suggests that intradomain conformational changes induced by Rho GTPase binding are small in this system. Furthermore, the structures of the RBD dimers provide a model for a dimeric intracellular structure. This model is incompatible with Rho GTPase binding, thus supporting the role of these interactions for interdomain changes. Functional studies in cells confirm the importance of a newly discovered protein segment (the “coupling loop”) that is designed to oppose dimerization of the RBD region as part of the receptor activation mechanism. The plexin GAP fold has high structural similarity to that of p120GAP. Our data suggest that the intracellular domain of plexin-B1, when in the monomeric state, is primed for GAP function even in the absence of Rho GTPases, leading to a critical extension of the current model for plexin activation.AddendumWhile this paper was under review (and following the release of the plexin-B1 coordinates in late May 2009), the structure of the plexin-A3 intracellular region also became available. It should be noted that the structures are very similar (Cα root mean square deviation of 0.95 Å for 430 matching residues). However, the interpretation of the structures, drawn in terms of possible molecular mechanisms by He et al. (48.He H. Taehong Y. Terman J.R. Zhang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 15610-15615Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) is substantially different from that presented here. IntroductionPlexins are single transmembrane receptors for guidance cues, called semaphorins, which regulate the motility and positional maintenance of certain cells. With this function, the receptors play critical roles in many developmental processes, including axon guidance, angiogenesis, and bone formation (1.Tamagnone L. Comoglio P.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 377-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 2.Kruger R.P. Aurandt J. Guan K.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Moreover, plexins and their ligands are also involved in the regulation of the immune response, in cancer progression, and are thought to restrain tissue regeneration after injury (3.Neufeld G. Shraga-Heled N. Lange T. Guttmann-Raviv N. Herzog Y. Kessler O. Front. Biosci. 2005; 10: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 4.Pasterkamp R.J. Verhaagen J. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2001; 35: 36-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).Plexins are unusual receptors in that they interact directly with Rho and Ras family small GTPases (5.Oinuma I. Ishikawa Y. Katoh H. Negishi M. Science. 2004; 305: 862-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 6.Toyofuku T. Yoshida J. Sugimoto T. Zhang H. Kumanogoh A. Hori M. Kikutani H. Nat.

An intracellular region that has high homology to Ras GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) 7The abbreviations used are: GAPGTPase-activating proteinRBDRho GTPase binding domain. facilitates the hydrolysis of R-Ras-bound GTP. This deactivation of R-Ras leads to functional inhibition of integrins and to a loss of cell adhesion in response to semaphorins (5.Oinuma I. Ishikawa Y. Katoh H. Negishi M. Science. 2004; 305: 862-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 6.Toyofuku T. Yoshida J. Sugimoto T. Zhang H. Kumanogoh A. Hori M. Kikutani H. Nat.

Katoh H. Negishi M. Science. 2004; 305: 862-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), suggesting greater substrate specificity compared with the GAP protein p120GAP (9.Ohba Y. Mochizuki N.

How the plexin receptor is activated and specifically how the GAP function is regulated have been questions of considerable interest (10.Rohm B. Rahim B. Kleiber B. Hovatta I. Püschel A.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 11.Pasterkamp R.J.

A number of studies have pointed to a sequence segment that interrupts the GAP-homologous region and is capable of binding small Rho family GTPases. In the case of plexin-B1, this Rho GTPase binding domain (RBD) can associate with Rnd1, Rac1, and RhoD, which are thought to regulate plexin function. Specifically, in vitro studies in a number of laboratories have used the intracellular region of plexins expressed as two fragments, named C1 (containing the RBD and an N-terminal GAP-homologous segment) and C2 (C-terminal GAP segment). The studies suggest that such fragments are loosely associated. Moreover, the interaction between the RBD and Rnd1 or Rac1 appears to separate the two fragments (5.Oinuma I. Ishikawa Y. Katoh H. Negishi M. Science. 2004; 305: 862-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 6.Toyofuku T. Yoshida J. Sugimoto T. Zhang H. Kumanogoh A. Hori M. Kikutani H. Nat.

Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar).

However, the GAP domain is often surrounded by other protein segments that are known to participate in cell signaling events, such as an SH2 domain in chimerins (16.Canagarajah B. Leskow F.C. Ho J.Y.

Our understanding of how GAP activity is controlled is still limited, because not many structures that include regulatory domains have been determined to date.Characterizing the structure of the intracellular region of human plexin-B1 promises to elucidate the mechanism by which the RBD can control receptor signaling and the function of the GAP domain.

https://openalex.org/W1989605800,"There is an urgent need for new drugs against influenza type A and B viruses due to incomplete protection by vaccines and the emergence of resistance to current antivirals. The influenza virus polymerase complex, consisting of the PB1, PB2 and PA subunits, represents a promising target for the development of new drugs. We have previously demonstrated the feasibility of targeting the protein-protein interaction domain between the PB1 and PA subunits of the polymerase complex of influenza A virus using a small peptide derived from the PA-binding domain of PB1. However, this influenza A virus-derived peptide did not affect influenza B virus polymerase activity. Here we report that the PA-binding domain of the polymerase subunit PB1 of influenza A and B viruses is highly conserved and that mutual amino acid exchange shows that they cannot be functionally exchanged with each other. Based on phylogenetic analysis and a novel biochemical ELISA-based screening approach, we were able to identify an influenza A-derived peptide with a single influenza B-specific amino acid substitution which efficiently binds to PA of both virus types. This dual-binding peptide blocked the viral polymerase activity and growth of both virus types. Our findings provide proof of principle that protein-protein interaction inhibitors can be generated against influenza A and B viruses.

In cells expressing single AQP4 isoforms, we found previously that OAP formation by AQP4-M23 requires N terminus interactions just downstream of Met-23 and that the inability of AQP4-M1 to form OAPs involves blocking by residues upstream of Met-23. Here, we studied M1/M23 interactions and regulated OAP assembly by nanometer-resolution tracking of quantum dot-labeled AQP4 in live cells expressing differentially tagged AQP4 isoforms and in primary glial cell cultures in which native AQP4 was labeled with a monoclonal recombinant neuromyelitis optica autoantibody. OAP assembly was assessed independently by Blue Native gel electrophoresis. We found that OAPs in native glial cells could be reproduced in transfected cells expressing equal amounts of AQP4-M1 and -M23. Mutants of M23 that do not themselves form OAPs, including M23-F26Q and M23-G28P, were able to fully co-associate with native M23 to form large immobile OAPs. Analysis of a palmitoylation-null M1 mutant (C13A/C17A) indicated palmitoylation-dependent OAP assembly only in the presence of M23, with increased M1 palmitoylation causing progressive OAP disruption. Differential regulation of OAP assembly by palmitoylation, calcium elevation, and protein kinase C activation was found in primary glial cell cultures. We conclude that M1 and M23 co-assemble in AQP4 OAPs and that specific signaling events can regulate OAP assembly in glial cells.

https://openalex.org/W2162877239,The serine/threonine kinase PIM2 is highly expressed in human leukemia and lymphomas and has been shown to positively regulate survival and proliferation of tumor cells. Its diverse ATP site makes PIM2 a promising target for the development of anticancer agents. To date our knowledge of catalytic domain structures of the PIM kinase family is limited to PIM1 which has been extensively studied and which shares about 50% sequence identity with PIM2.Here we determined the crystal structure of PIM2 in complex with an organoruthenium complex (inhibition in sub-nanomolar level). Due to its extraordinary shape complementarity this stable organometallic compound is a highly potent inhibitor of PIM kinases.The structure of PIM2 revealed several differences to PIM1 which may be explored further to generate isoform selective inhibitors. It has also demonstrated how an organometallic inhibitor can be adapted to the binding site of protein kinases to generate highly potent inhibitors.This article can also be viewed as an enhanced version in which the text of the article is integrated with interactive 3D representations and animated transitions.

https://openalex.org/W2061207486,"Triadin is a multiple proteins family, some isoforms being involved in muscle excitation-contraction coupling, and some having still unknown functions. To obtain clues on triadin functions, we engineered a triadin knock-out mouse line and characterized the physiological effect of triadin ablation on skeletal muscle function. These mice presented a reduced muscle strength, which seemed not to alter their survival and has been characterized in the present work. We first checked in these mice the expression level of the different proteins involved in calcium homeostasis and observed in fast muscles an increase in expression of dihydropyridine receptor, with a large reduction in calsequestrin expression. Electron microscopy analysis of KO muscles morphology demonstrated the presence of triads in abnormal orientation and a reduction in the sarcoplasmic reticulum terminal cisternae volume. Using calcium imaging on cultured myotubes, we observed a reduction in the total amount of calcium stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Physiological studies have been performed to evaluate the influence of triadin deletion on skeletal muscle function. Muscle strength has been measured both on the whole animal model, using hang test or electrical stimulation combined with NMR analysis and strength measurement, or on isolated muscle using electrical stimulation. All the results obtained demonstrate an important reduction in muscle strength, indicating that triadin plays an essential role in skeletal muscle function and in skeletal muscle structure. These results indicate that triadin alteration leads to the development of a myopathy, which could be studied using this new animal model."
https://openalex.org/W1977146608,"Coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) is a dual functional coregulator that facilitates transcription initiation by methylation of Arg(17) and Arg(26) of histone H3 and also dictates the subsequent coactivator complex disassembly by methylation of the steroid receptor coactivator family coactivators and p300/cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein. However, the regulation of CARM1 enzymatic activity and substrate specificity remains largely unknown. In this study, we report that CARM1 function is regulated by phosphorylation at Ser(217), a residue completely conserved in the type I protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) family of enzymes. Comparative analysis of the published CARM1 crystal structures reveals that the hydroxyl group of Ser(217) forms a strong hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen atom of Tyr(154) to lock the cofactor S-adenosylmethionine inside the binding cavity. Phosphorylation of Ser(217) disrupts this hydrogen bond and subsequently abolishes S-adenosylmethionine binding and its methyltransferase activity. Importantly, Tyr(154) is also conserved in the type I PRMT family of enzymes, suggesting a general role of this hydrogen bond in maintaining the holo structure of the type I PRMT catalytic domain. Moreover, we found that phosphorylation at Ser(217) also promoted CARM1 cytoplasmic localization and that this translocation occurred mainly during mitosis. We propose that phosphorylation at Ser(217) serves as a molecular switch for controlling CARM1 enzymatic activity during the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1965816291,"One of the major mechanisms that could produce resistance to antineoplastic drugs in cancer cells is the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters. The ABC transporters can significantly decrease the intracellular concentration of antineoplastic drugs by increasing their efflux, thereby lowering the cytotoxic activity of antineoplastic drugs. One of these transporters, the multiple resistant protein 7 (MRP7, ABCC10), has recently been shown to produce resistance to antineoplastic drugs by increasing the efflux of paclitaxel. In this study, we examined the effects of BCR-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib on the activity and expression of MRP7 in HEK293 cells transfected with MRP7, designated HEK-MRP7-2.We report for the first time that imatinib and nilotinib reversed MRP7-mediated multidrug resistance. Our MTT assay results indicated that MRP7 expression in HEK-MRP7-2 cells was not significantly altered by incubation with 5 microM of imatinib or nilotinib for up to 72 hours. In addition, imatinib and nilotinib (1-5 microM) produced a significant concentration-dependent reversal of MRP7-mediated multidrug resistance by enhancing the sensitivity of HEK-MRP7-2 cells to paclitaxel and vincristine. Imatinib and nilotinib, at 5 microM, significantly increased the accumulation of [(3)H]-paclitaxel in HEK-MRP7-2 cells. The incubation of the HEK-MRP7-2 cells with imatinib or nilotinib (5 microM) also significantly inhibited the efflux of paclitaxel.Imatinib and nilotinib reverse MRP7-mediated paclitaxel resistance, most likely due to their inhibition of the efflux of paclitaxel via MRP7. These findings suggest that imatinib or nilotinib, in combination with other antineoplastic drugs, may be useful in the treatment of certain resistant cancers."

This nucleotide sugar is the established or presumed donor substrate of specific galactofuranosyltransferases (GlfTs) comprising characterized bacterial β-GlfTs (14.Richards M.R. Lowary T.L. Chembiochem. 2009; 10: 1920-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and a family of putative β-GlfTs identified in the protozoan parasite L. major (17.Zhang K. Barron T. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 136: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18.Späth G.F. Epstein L. Leader B. Singer S.M. Avila H.A. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 9258-9263Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In addition, many eukaryotic and prokaryotic GlfTs such as the mycobacterial α-GlfTs are still unidentified. One of the putative eukaryotic transferases, known as LPG1, is involved in the biosynthesis of the lipophosphoglycan (LPG) of L. major and is localized in the Golgi apparatus (19.Ha D.S. Schwarz J.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Similarly, enzymes involved in addition of the terminal Galf to N-glycans, O-glycans, or glycolipids are assumed to be localized in this organelle. UDP-Galf biosynthesis, however, occurs in the cytosol (12.Kleczka B. Lamerz A.C. van Zandbergen G. Wenzel A. Gerardy-Schahn R. Wiese M. Routier F.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10498-10505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which makes translocation of UDP-Galf across the Golgi membrane necessary (Fig. 1). Nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) are multitransmembrane proteins present in all kinds of eukaryotic organisms. They consist typically of 8–10 transmembrane α-helices linked by short loops. Further structural information is very limited because efforts to obtain crystals for x-ray structure determination have been hindered by the high hydrophobicity of NSTs. Many NSTs have been functionally characterized in biochemical assays measuring incorporation of radioactive nucleotide sugars into membrane vesicles. These experiments led to the development of a mechanistic model, in which NSTs work as antiporters that export a nucleotide sugar molecule in exchange for an equally charged nucleoside monophosphate molecule (20.Gerardy-Schahn R. Oelmann S. Bakker H. Biochimie. 2001; 83: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because of their structural conservation, putative NSTs can be readily found by data base mining. In humans, they belong to the SLC35 (solute carrier 35) family (21.Ishida N. Kawakita M. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), which comprise 10 characterized members and 13 proteins whose function is currently unknown. Phylogenetic classification identified subfamilies that contain all of the characterized SLC35 proteins, but do not allow classification of most of the SLC35 proteins with unknown function (22.Jack D.L. Yang N.M. Saier Jr., M.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3620-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Furthermore, substrate specificity is hardly conserved within NST subfamilies, thus it is generally not possible to infer substrate specificity from the level of sequence identity or phylogeny. NSTs are closely related to plastidic phosphate translocators that include translocators for triose phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, glucose 6-phosphate, and xylulose phosphate. Additionally, a variety of uncharacterized phosphate translocator-homologous proteins are found in plant and other organisms, including human (23.Knappe S. Flügge U.I. Fischer K. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1178-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe the characterization of an A. fumigatus phosphate translocator-homologous protein with NST function and demonstrate its specificity for UDP-Galf. The importance for in vivo galactofuranosylation is shown by a targeted gene deletion approach. Radiolabeled nucleotide sugars were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (UDP-[3H]Gal, UDP-[3H]GlcNAc, and UDP-[14C]GlcA), American Radiolabeled Chemicals (UDP-[3H]GalNAc and [3H]UMP), and GE Healthcare (UDP-[3H]Glc). UDP-Galf was chemically synthesized (24.Peltier P. Guégan J.P. Daniellou R. Nugier-Chauvin C. Ferrières V. Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2008; : 5988-5994Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For protein expression, Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BY4741 in which the gene for the endoplasmic reticulum UDP-GlcNAc transporter, YEA4, had been deleted (MATa; his3D1; leu2D0; met15D0; ura3D0; YEL004w::kanMX4; EUROSCARF, Frankfurt, Germany) was cultivated in SC minimal media (2% glucose, 1.7 g/liter DifcoTM Yeast Nitrogen Base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate (BD Biosciences), 5 g/liter of ammonium sulfate) supplemented with l-histidine (50 mg/liter), l-methionine (50 mg/liter), and l-leucine (100 mg/liter). A. fumigatus clinical isolate D141 was used in this study. For gene deletion purposes, a D141 strain deficient in non-homologous end-joining (AfS35) was used (25.Krappmann S. Sasse C. Braus G.H. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 212-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Strains were grown at 37 °C on Aspergillus minimal medium containing 1% d-glucose as carbon source and 70 mm NaNO3 as nitrogen source. Phleomycin was added for selection purposes at 30 mg/liter. Transmembrane helix prediction was carried out using the ConPred II program (26.Arai M. Mitsuke H. Ikeda M. Xia J.X. Kikuchi T. Satake M. Shimizu T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W390-W393Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). For plant proteins, predicted transmembrane domains were obtained from the ARAMEMNON data base (27.Schwacke R.

BLAST searches were performed using default parameter values with the low complexity filter switched off. Total RNA was isolated from A. fumigatus mycelium and glfB mRNA was reverse transcribed into single-stranded cDNA using the JE28 primer. All primer sequences are provided in supplemental Table S1. The glfB coding sequence was then amplified by PCR (JE26/JE28) and cloned via BamHI/XbaI into plasmid vector pYEScupFLAGK (28.Ashikov A. Routier F. Fuhlrott J. Helmus Y. Wild M. Gerardy-Schahn R.

Cassettes constructed for targeted gene replacement are described in the supplementary data. Mutants were generated by polyethylene glycol-mediated fusion of protoplasts as described in Ref. 29.Punt P.J. van den Hondel C.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar. Transformants were grown on Aspergillus minimal medium plates containing 1.2 m sorbitol as osmotic stabilizer under appropriate selection conditions and singled out twice before further analysis. Accurate gene deletion and reconstitution were confirmed by Southern hybridization. The glfB cDNA as well as the human UDP-Gal transporter cDNA (SLC35A2, isoform a) (30.Kabuss R. Ashikov A. Oelmann S. Gerardy-Schahn R. Bakker H. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 905-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were cloned into the plasmid vector pYEScupFLAGK (complementing uracil auxotrophy) for copper-inducible expression of N-terminal FLAG-tagged proteins in yeast. S. cerevisiae spheroplasts were transformed using the lithium-acetate method described by Invitrogen. Transformants were selected on SC minimal media without uracil. For protein expression, transformants were grown in 1-liter cultures until A600 reached 0.8–0.9, expression was then induced by addition of 0.5 mm CuSO4 (final concentration) and culture was continued for 2 h at 30 °C. Subcellular fractionation of yeast cells and in vitro transport assay were performed as previously described (28.Ashikov A. Routier F. Fuhlrott J. Helmus Y. Wild M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Bakker H. J.

Briefly, 50 μl of Golgi vesicle preparations (containing typically 80 μg of total protein) and 50 μl of 2 μm 3H-labeled nucleotide sugar or [3H]UMP (0.37 kBq/μl) in assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.8 m sorbitol, 2 mm MgCl2) were incubated for 30 s at 30 °C. For competition assays, the assay buffer contained in addition 100 μm unlabeled nucleotide sugar (31.Muraoka M. Miki T. Ishida N. Hara T. Kawakita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24615-24622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by dilution with 1 ml of ice-cold assay buffer. The vesicle suspension was then filtered through a mixed cellulose ester membrane (MFTM membrane filters, 0.45 μm, Millipore, Bedford, MA). Vesicles adhering to the filters were washed three times with 2 ml of ice-cold assay buffer and the radioactivity retained on the membrane was measured by liquid scintillation. Subcellular fractionation of A. fumigatus largely followed a protocol described for Aspergillus oryzae (32.Record E. Asther M. Moukha S. Marion D. Burlat V. Ruel K. Asther M. Can. J. Microbiol. 1998; 44: 945-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mycelium (approximately 30 g, squeeze-dried) from 1 liter of an A. fumigatus FLAG-glfB overnight culture (inoculum 106 ml−1 conidia) was ground in a mortar with 1–1.5 volumes of sterile sand and 50 ml of lysis buffer (15% (w/w) sucrose, 10 mm HEPES/Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, supplemented with Complete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitors (Roche)). Debris was removed by filtration through Miracloth (Calbiochem) and rinsed further in 45 ml of lysis buffer. Large particles (whole cells, nuclei, and mitochondria) were removed by two sequential centrifugation steps (30 min at 10,000 × g and 20 min at 27,000 × g) and microsomes were pelleted at 110,000 × g (45 min) at 4 °C. The microsomal pellet was suspended in 800 μl of lysis buffer, applied on a multistep sucrose gradient (1 ml of each 60, 50, 40, 38, 36, 34, 32, 30, 28, 26, 24, 20, 18, and 15% (w/w) sucrose in 10 mm HEPES/Tris, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA) and centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C. Fractions (approximately 0.5 ml) were collected from the bottom of the tube and kept at 4 °C until analyzed. Density was calculated from the sucrose concentration determined by a standard optical refractometer and the protein concentration was determined with the Protein BCA Assay (Pierce). Cytochrome c oxidoreductase was used as endoplasmic reticulum marker (33.Lord J.M. Kagawa T. Moore T.S. Beevers H. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 57: 659-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and assayed by adding 20 μl of each fraction to 80 μl of a solution containing 80 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 μm cytochrome c (oxidized, Sigma), 1.5 mm β-NADH, and 7.2 mm NaCN. A550 was recorded over 5 min in a microplate reader, and substrate turnover was calculated from the slope according to Lambert-Beer's law (path length, 0.30 cm; molar absorptivity, 21 mm−1 cm−1). Three days after fractionation, the Golgi marker inosine diphosphatase was assayed as described (34.Green J.R. Isolation of Membranes and Organelles from Plant Cells.in: Hall J.L. Moore A.L.

The monoclonal antibody EB-A2 (39.Bakker H. Routier F. Oelmann S. Jordi W. Lommen A. Gerardy-Schahn R. Bosch D.

Horseradish peroxidase activity was visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce). For sucrose gradient analysis, 7.5 μl of each fraction were incubated for 10 min at 50 °C with 7.5 μl of sample buffer. Both sample buffer and the polyacrylamide gel contained 4 m urea. For FLAG tag detection, mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M5 (Sigma) was used in a 1:1000 dilution. IRDye 800CW-coupled secondary antibody enabled band visualization and intensity measurement by infrared scanning on an Odyssey system (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE).

N-Glycan preparation and separation were carried out as described previously (36.Laroy W. Contreras R. Callewaert N. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Glycoproteins from 12 ml (40 × 300 μl) of A. fumigatus culture supernatant were transferred to Immobilon P Multiwell plates (Millipore).

Nature. 2005; 438: 1151-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) with various characterized NST protein sequences identified 16 putative NST genes (supplemental Table S2). One of them (AFUA_3G12700) is adjacent to the recently identified glfA gene (AFUA_3G12690) encoding the UDP-Galf biosynthetic enzyme UGM, and was thus considered a reasonable candidate because clustering of functionally related genes is sometimes observed in A. fumigatus (e.g. the siderophore genes sidF, sidD, and mirB) (38.Schrettl M. Bignell E. Kragl C. Sabiha Y. Loss O. Eisendle M. Wallner A. Arst Jr., H.N. Haynes K. Haas H. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). This gene will be referred to as glfB because of its implication in galactofuranosylation, as demonstrated below. Interestingly, all fungi from the subphylum Pezizomycotina whose genome has been fully sequenced display a clear homolog of glfB clustered with glfA. When present in basiodiomycota (e.g. Cryptococcus neoformans), these two genes are more distant and may be found on different chromosomes. In A. fumigatus, the predicted GlfB protein comprises 400 amino acids and shares up to 40% amino acid identity with uncharacterized Arabidopsis phosphate translocator homologs. The most similar protein with known function is the plant UDP-Gal transporter AtUDP-GalT1 (At1g77610) (39.Bakker H. Routier F. Oelmann S. Jordi W. Lommen A. Gerardy-Schahn R. Bosch D. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) that displays 21% identity with GlfB. The UDP-Gal transporters AtUDP-GalT2 (At1g76670) and AtNST-KT1 (At4g39390) (39.Bakker H. Routier F. Oelmann S. Jordi W. Lommen A. Gerardy-Schahn R. Bosch D. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 40.Rollwitz I. Santaella M. Hille D. Flügge U.I. Fischer K. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 4246-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the uncharacterized SLC35C2 and SLC35E3 are more distantly related and show 14 to 19% identity with GlfB. Finally, the human GDP-Fuc transporter is the closest characterized transporter of the SLC35 family (12% identity). An alignment of GlfB with these sequences is presented in Fig. 2. This multiple sequence alignment underlines the conservation of two lysine residues (GlfB Lys-59 and Lys-294) that have been proposed to be involved in substrate binding (23.Knappe S. Flügge U.I. Fischer K. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1178-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 41.Gao X.D. Nishikawa A. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4424-4432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). GlfB was predicted to contain 11 transmembrane helices of which the first 10 aligned well with the predicted transmembrane helices of its homologs and other NSTs (fig. 2). We thus hypothesized that glfB encoded a NST and in line with its location in the genome speculated about a specificity for UDP-Galf. Uptake of radioactive nucleotide sugars by Golgi-enriched vesicles isolated from yeast expressing a putative NST is a method of choice to determine substrate specificity. Synthesis of radioactive UDP-Galf has been reported (42.Mariño K. Marino C. Lima C. Baldoni L. de Lederkremer R.M. Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2005; : 2958-2964Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) but is not commercially available and could thus not be directly tested in this in vitro assay system. Nevertheless, the transport of UDP-Gal, UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-GalNAc, or UDP-GlcA could be excluded. Indeed, the uptake of these nucleotide sugars by Golgi vesicles isolated from yeast cells expressing GlfB or mock transformed was virtually absent (background levels of 1.0 to 1.7 pmol mg−1 min−1), whereas an endogenous UDP-Glc transport of ∼7 pmol mg−1 min−1 verified the quality of the Golgi vesicle preparation. Additionally, transfection of CHO-Lec8 cells with GlfB resulted in Golgi expression of the protein but did not restore galactosylation of the surface glycoconjugates confirming absence of the UDP-Gal transport (data not shown). NSTs are likely simple carrier proteins with a binding site alternating between both sides of the membrane (43.Tiralongo J. Ashikov A. Routier F. Eckhardt M. Bakker H. Gerardy-Schahn R. von Itzstein M. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Presence of the antiport molecule (in this case UMP) at the trans (inside) or cis (outside) side of the membrane thus leads to stimulation or inhibition of the nucleotide sugar transport, respectively (43.Tiralongo J. Ashikov A. Routier F. Eckhardt M. Bakker H. Gerardy-Schahn R. von Itzstein M. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 44.Capasso J.M. Hirschberg C.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 777: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To assess UDP-Galf binding, we thus evaluated the ability of unlabeled UDP-Galf (45.Peltier P. Daniellou R. Nugier-Chauvin C. Ferrières V. Organic Lett. 2007; 9: 5227-5230Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) to inhibit the uptake of radioactive UMP, the postulated counter substrate of GlfB (Fig. 3A). For this purpose, Golgi vesicles obtained from cells expressing either GlfB or the human UDP-Gal transporter were incubated with 1 μm [3H]UMP and 100 μm unlabeled UMP, UDP-Galf, UDP-Gal, or UDP-GlcNAc. In GlfB containing vesicles, the addition of UDP-Galf resulted in an 80% inhibition of the [3H]UMP transport and was thus comparable with addition of unlabeled UMP (88% inhibition). In contrast, UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-Gal slightly affected the UMP uptake indicating a limited binding of these nucleotide sugars to GlfB. Unfortunately, because UDP-Galf is rather unstable, contamination of a UDP-Galf solution by UMP is difficult to avoid (46.Marlow A.L. Kiessling L.L. Organic Lett. 2001; 3: 2517-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and was in this case estimated to 6–7% by high pressure liquid chromatography (47.Lee R. Monsey D. Weston A. Duncan K. Rithner C. McNeil M. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 242: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). This contaminating UMP explains the 50% decrease of [3H]UMP uptake observed with vesicles expressing the UDP-Gal transporter because a comparable inhibition is observed with 8 μm unlabeled UMP (Fig. 3B). In contrast, inhibition of GlfB-mediated [3H]UMP uptake by the contaminated UDP-Galf solution was significantly higher than observed with 8 μm UMP (p = 0.011, t test), indicating that part of the inhibition observed is actually due to UDP-Galf binding. To prove UDP-Galf transport activity in vivo, evaluation of the effect of glfB loss on galactofuranosylation of glycoconjugates in A. fumigatus was undertaken. For this purpose a glfB deletion cassette was constructed by double-joint PCR (48.Yu J.H. Hamari"

Inhibition of downstream inflammatory mediators of sepsis, e.g., TNF-alpha, has failed in clinical trials. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of inhibiting CD14, a key upstream innate immunity molecule, on the early inflammatory and hemostatic responses in a pig model of gram-negative sepsis. The study comprised two arms, whole live Escherichia coli bacteria and E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (n=25 and n=9 animals, respectively). The animals were allocated into treatment (anti-CD14) and control (IgG isotype or saline) groups. Inflammatory, hemostatic, physiological, and microbiological parameters were measured. The proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8, but not the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, were efficiently inhibited by anti-CD14. Furthermore, anti-CD14 preserved the leukocyte count and significantly reduced granulocyte enzyme matrix metalloproteinase-9 release and expression of the granulocyte membrane activation molecule wCD11R3 (pig CD11b). The hemostatic markers thrombin-antithrombin III complexes and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were significantly attenuated. Anti-CD14 did not affect LPS or E. coli DNA levels. This study documents that CD14 inhibition efficiently attenuates the proinflammatory cytokine response and granulocyte activation and reverses the procoagulant state but does not interfere with LPS levels or bacterial counts in E. coli-induced sepsis.-Thorgersen, E.

https://openalex.org/W2021298631,"The 300-kDa cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR), which contains multiple mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) binding sites that map to domains 3, 5, and 9 within its 15-domain extracytoplasmic region, functions as an efficient carrier of Man-6-P-containing lysosomal enzymes. To determine the types of phosphorylated N-glycans recognized by each of the three carbohydrate binding sites of the CI-MPR, a phosphorylated glycan microarray was probed with truncated forms of the CI-MPR. Surface plasmon resonance analyses using lysosomal enzymes with defined N-glycans were performed to evaluate whether multiple domains are needed to form a stable, high affinity carbohydrate binding pocket. Like domain 3, adjacent domains increase the affinity of domain 5 for phosphomannosyl residues, with domain 5 exhibiting ∼60-fold higher affinity for lysosomal enzymes containing the phosphodiester Man-P-GlcNAc when in the context of a construct encoding domains 5–9. In contrast, domain 9 does not require additional domains for high affinity binding. The three sites differ in their glycan specificity, with only domain 5 being capable of recognizing Man-P-GlcNAc. In addition, domain 9, unlike domains 1–3, interacts with Man8GlcNAc2 and Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides containing a single phosphomonoester. Together, these data indicate that the assembly of three unique carbohydrate binding sites allows the CI-MPR to interact with the structurally diverse phosphorylated N-glycans it encounters on newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2062531735,"Temporal-difference (TD) algorithms have been proposed as models of reinforcement learning (RL). We examine two issues of distributed representation in these TD algorithms: distributed representations of belief and distributed discounting factors. Distributed representation of belief allows the believed state of the world to distribute across sets of equivalent states. Distributed exponential discounting factors produce hyperbolic discounting in the behavior of the agent itself. We examine these issues in the context of a TD RL model in which state-belief is distributed over a set of exponentially-discounting ""micro-Agents"", each of which has a separate discounting factor (gamma). Each microAgent maintains an independent hypothesis about the state of the world, and a separate value-estimate of taking actions within that hypothesized state. The overall agent thus instantiates a flexible representation of an evolving world-state. As with other TD models, the value-error (delta) signal within the model matches dopamine signals recorded from animals in standard conditioning reward-paradigms. The distributed representation of belief provides an explanation for the decrease in dopamine at the conditioned stimulus seen in overtrained animals, for the differences between trace and delay conditioning, and for transient bursts of dopamine seen at movement initiation. Because each microAgent also includes its own exponential discounting factor, the overall agent shows hyperbolic discounting, consistent with behavioral experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2085820610,"The phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P(2)) metabolizing enzymes, the kinase PIKfyve and the phosphatase Sac3, constitute a single multiprotein complex organized by the PIKfyve regulator ArPIKfyve and its ability to homodimerize. We previously established that PIKfyve is activated within the triple PIKfyve-ArPIKfyve-Sac3 (PAS) core. These data assign an atypical function for the phosphatase in PtdIns(3,5)P(2) biosynthesis, thus raising the question of whether Sac3 retains its PtdIns(3,5)P(2) hydrolyzing activity within the PAS complex. Herein, we address the issue of Sac3 functionality by a combination of biochemical and morphological assays in triple-transfected COS cells using a battery of truncated or point mutants of the three proteins. We identified the Cpn60_TCP1 domain of PIKfyve as a major determinant for associating the ArPIKfyve-Sac3 subcomplex. Neither Sac3 nor PIKfyve enzymatic activities affected the PAS complex formation or stability. Using the well established formation of aberrant cell vacuoles as a sensitive functional measure of localized PtdIns(3,5)P(2) reduction, we observed a mitigated vacuolar phenotype by kinase-deficient PIKfyve(K1831E) if its ArPIKfyve-Sac3 binding region was deleted, suggesting reduced Sac3 access to, and turnover of PtdIns(3,5)P(2). In contrast, PIKfyve(K1831E), which displays intact ArPIKfyve-Sac3 binding, triggered a more severe vacuolar phenotype if coexpressed with ArPIKfyve(WT)-Sac3(WT) but minimal defects when coexpressed with ArPIKfyve(WT) and phosphatase-deficient Sac3(D488A). These data indicate that Sac3 assembled in the PAS regulatory core complex is an active PtdIns(3,5)P(2) phosphatase. Based on these and other data, presented herein, we propose a model of domain interactions within the PAS core and their role in regulating the enzymatic activities."
https://openalex.org/W1991004420,"Carbonyl reduction constitutes a phase I reaction for many xenobiotics and is carried out in mammals mainly by members of two protein families, namely aldo-keto reductases and short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases. In addition to their capacity to reduce xenobiotics, several of the enzymes act on endogenous compounds such as steroids or eicosanoids. One of the major carbonyl reducing enzymes found in humans is carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) with a very broad substrate spectrum. A paralog, carbonyl reductase 3 (CBR3) has about 70% sequence identity and has not been sufficiently characterized to date. Screening of a focused xenobiotic compound library revealed that CBR3 has narrower substrate specificity and acts on several orthoquinones, as well as isatin or the anticancer drug oracin. To further investigate structure-activity relationships between these enzymes we crystallized CBR3, performed substrate docking, site-directed mutagenesis and compared its kinetic features to CBR1. Despite high sequence similarities, the active sites differ in shape and surface properties. The data reveal that the differences in substrate specificity are largely due to a short segment of a substrate binding loop comprising critical residues Trp229/Pro230, Ala235/Asp236 as well as part of the active site formed by Met141/Gln142 in CBR1 and CBR3, respectively. The data suggest a minor role in xenobiotic metabolism for CBR3.This article can also be viewed as an enhanced version in which the text of the article is integrated with interactive 3D representations and animated transitions.

https://openalex.org/W2019857421,"Chlorophyll b is one of the major photosynthetic pigments of plants. The regulation of chlorophyll b biosynthesis is important for plants in order to acclimate to changing environmental conditions. In the chloroplast, chlorophyll b is synthesized from chlorophyll a by chlorophyllide a oxygenase (CAO), a Rieske-type monooxygenase. The activity of this enzyme is regulated at the level of protein stability via a feedback mechanism through chlorophyll b. The Clp protease and the N-terminal domain (designated the A domain) of CAO are essential for the regulatory mechanism. In this study, we aimed to identify the specific amino acid residue or the sequence within the A domain that is essential for this regulation. To accomplish this goal, we randomly introduced base substitutions into the A domain and searched for potentially important residues by analyzing 1,000 transformants of Arabidopsis thaliana. However, none of the single amino acid substitutions significantly stabilized CAO. Therefore, we generated serial deletions in the A domain and expressed these deletions in the background of CAO-deficient Arabidopsis mutant. We found that the amino acid sequence (97)QDLLTIMILH(106) is essential for the regulation of the protein stability. We furthermore determined that this sequence induces the destabilization of green fluorescent protein. These results suggest that this sequence serves as a degradation signal that is recognized by proteases functioning in the chloroplast."

The respective members function as large protein complexes involved in establishment and maintenance of transcriptional repression of developmental control genes.

MBTD1 contains four MBT repeats.We have determined the crystal structure of MBTD1 (residues 130-566aa covering the 4 MBT repeats) at 2.5 A resolution by X-ray crystallography. The crystal structure of MBTD1 reveals its similarity to another four-MBT-repeat protein L3MBTL2, which binds lower methylated lysine histones. Fluorescence polarization experiments confirmed that MBTD1 preferentially binds mono- and di-methyllysine histone peptides, like L3MBTL1 and L3MBTL2. All known MBT-peptide complex structures characterized to date do not exhibit strong histone peptide sequence selectivity, and use a ""cavity insertion recognition mode"" to recognize the methylated lysine with the deeply buried methyl-lysine forming extensive interactions with the protein while the peptide residues flanking methyl-lysine forming very few contacts [1]. Nevertheless, our mutagenesis data based on L3MBTL1 suggested that the histone peptides could not bind to MBT repeats in any orientation.The four MBT repeats in MBTD1 exhibits an asymmetric rhomboid architecture. Like other MBT repeat proteins characterized so far, MBTD1 binds mono- or dimethylated lysine histones through one of its four MBT repeats utilizing a semi-aromatic cage.This article can also be viewed as an enhanced version in which the text of the article is integrated with interactive 3D representations and animated transitions.

https://openalex.org/W2077976097,"The vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT) is a synaptic vesicle protein responsible for the vesicular storage of gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) and glycine which plays an essential role in GABAergic and glycinergic neurotransmission. The transport mechanism of VIAAT remains largely unknown. Here, we show that proteoliposomes containing purified VIAAT actively took up GABA upon formation of membrane potential (Deltapsi) (positive inside) but not DeltapH. VIAAT-mediated GABA uptake had an absolute requirement for Cl(-) and actually accompanied Cl(-) movement. Kinetic analysis indicated that one GABA molecule and two Cl(-) equivalents were transported during one transport cycle. VIAAT in which Glu(213) was specifically mutated to alanine completely lost the ability to take up both GABA and Cl(-). Essentially the same results were obtained with glycine, another substrate of VIAAT. These results demonstrated that VIAAT is a vesicular Cl(-) transporter that co-transports Cl(-) with GABA or glycine in a Deltapsi dependent manner. It is concluded that Cl(-) plays an essential role in vesicular storage of GABA and glycine."

In this study, we investigated the function of TLR/NF-κB signaling in C. jejuni induced pathogenesis using gnotobiotic IL-10−/−; NF-κBEGFP mice. In vitro analysis showed that C. jejuni induced IκB phosphorylation, followed by enhanced NF-κB transcriptional activity and increased IL-6, MIP-2α and NOD2 mRNA accumulation in infected-mouse colonic epithelial cells CMT93. Importantly, these events were blocked by molecular delivery of an IκB inhibitor (Ad5IκBAA). NF-κB signalling was also important for C.jejuni-induced cytokine gene expression in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Importantly, C. jejuni associated IL-10−/−; NF-κBEGFP mice developed mild (day 5) and severe (day 14) ulcerating colonic inflammation and bloody diarrhea as assessed by colonoscopy and histological analysis. Macroscopic analysis showed elevated EGFP expression indicating NF-κB activation throughout the colon of C. jejuni associated IL-10−/−; NF-κBEGFP mice, while fluorescence microscopy revealed EGFP positive cells to be exclusively located in lamina propria mononuclear cells. Pharmacological NF-κB inhibition using Bay 11-7085 did not ameliorate C. jejuni induced colonic inflammation.

https://openalex.org/W2056219025,"Macrophage-derived foam cells play important roles in the progression of atherosclerosis. We reported previously that ERK1/2-dependent granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) expression, leading to p38 MAPK/ Akt signaling, is important for oxidized low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL)-induced macrophage proliferation. Here, we investigated whether activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) could suppress macrophage proliferation. Ox-LDL-induced proliferation of mouse peritoneal macrophages was assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation and cell counting assays. The proliferation was significantly inhibited by the AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) and restored by dominant-negative AMPKα1, suggesting that AMPK activation suppressed macrophage proliferation. AICAR partially suppressed Ox-LDL-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and GM-CSF expression, suggesting that another mechanism is also involved in the AICAR-mediated suppression of macrophage proliferation. AICAR suppressed GM-CSF-induced macrophage proliferation without suppressing p38 MAPK/Akt signaling. GM-CSF suppressed p53 phosphorylation and expression and induced Rb phosphorylation. Overexpression of p53 or p27kip suppressed GM-CSF-induced macrophage proliferation. AICAR induced cell cycle arrest, increased p53 phosphorylation and expression, and suppressed GM-CSF-induced Rb phosphorylation via AMPK activation. Moreover, AICAR induced p21cip and p27kip expression via AMPK activation, and small interfering RNA (siRNA) of p21cip and p27kip restored AICAR-mediated suppression of macrophage proliferation. In conclusion, AMPK activation suppressed Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation by suppressing GM-CSF expression and inducing cell cycle arrest.

Ox-LDL-induced proliferation of mouse peritoneal macrophages was assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation and cell counting assays. The proliferation was significantly inhibited by the AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) and restored by dominant-negative AMPKα1, suggesting that AMPK activation suppressed macrophage proliferation. AICAR partially suppressed Ox-LDL-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and GM-CSF expression, suggesting that another mechanism is also involved in the AICAR-mediated suppression of macrophage proliferation. AICAR suppressed GM-CSF-induced macrophage proliferation without suppressing p38 MAPK/Akt signaling. GM-CSF suppressed p53 phosphorylation and expression and induced Rb phosphorylation. Overexpression of p53 or p27kip suppressed GM-CSF-induced macrophage proliferation. AICAR induced cell cycle arrest, increased p53 phosphorylation and expression, and suppressed GM-CSF-induced Rb phosphorylation via AMPK activation. Moreover, AICAR induced p21cip and p27kip expression via AMPK activation, and small interfering RNA (siRNA) of p21cip and p27kip restored AICAR-mediated suppression of macrophage proliferation. In conclusion, AMPK activation suppressed Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation by suppressing GM-CSF expression and inducing cell cycle arrest. These effects of AMPK activation may represent therapeutic targets for atherosclerosis. Macrophages are well known to be present in all stages of atherosclerosis and are considered to be fundamental to atherogenesis and the behavior of established plaques (1.Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19370) Google Scholar).

Foam cells produce various bioactive molecules, such as cytokines and growth factors, which are believed to play important roles in the development and progression of atherosclerosis (1.Ross R. N.

One of the characteristic events in atherosclerotic lesions is the proliferation of cells, including vascular smooth muscle cells and macrophages, within arterial walls. Indeed, previous in vivo studies have reported that macrophages and macrophage-derived foam cells proliferate in atherosclerotic lesions (3.Gordon D. Reidy M.A. Benditt E.P. Schwartz S.M. Proc. Natl.

Therefore, it is possible that macrophage proliferation may promote the progression of atherosclerosis. We previously reported that Ox-LDL-induced production of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factors (GM-CSFs) plays an important role in the growth signaling pathway for Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation (11.Biwa T.

Moreover, we recently reported that the p38 MAPK/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway is involved, at least in part, in the downstream signaling pathways after GM-CSF expression (8.Senokuchi T.

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) belongs to a protein kinase family that has been highly conserved throughout evolution in animals, plants, and yeast and plays major roles in cell responses to metabolic stress (14.Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar, 15.Kemp B.E. Mitchelhill K.I. Stapleton D. Michell B.J. Chen Z.P. Witters L.A. Trends.

Metab. 2005; 1: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar). AMPK is a heterotrimeric protein consisting of a catalytic α subunit and regulatory β and γ subunits (17.Long Y.C. Zierath J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1776-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Each α and β subunit is encoded by two genes (α1 and α2 or β1 and β2), whereas the γ subunit is encoded by three genes (γ1, γ2, and γ3). The protein is activated in response to increased ratios of AMP to ATP within the cell and therefore acts as an efficient sensor for the cellular energy state. AMP activates AMPK by direct allosteric activation and by protecting dephosphorylation of threonine residue (Thr-172) within the activation domain of the α subunit by inhibiting protein phosphatase 2Cα (17.Long Y.C. Zierath J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1776-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 18.Sanders M.J. Grondin P.O. Hegarty B.D. Snowden M.A. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). One of the downstream targets of AMPK is the regulation of lipid metabolism. It is well known that AMPK directly phosphorylates and inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), thereby suppressing malonyl-CoA production. The reduction in malonyl-CoA accelerates the entry of long-chain acyl-CoA into mitochondria for β-oxidation to restore the energy balance (17.Long Y.C. Zierath J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1776-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) is a well known activator of AMPK. AICAR is transported into cells through adenosine transporters and phosphorylated by adenosine kinase (19.Young M.E. Radda G.K. Leighton B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) to form 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-d-ribofuranosyl-5′-monophosphate, which mimics the stimulatory action of AMP on AMPK (20.Merrill G.F. Kurth E.J. Hardie D.G. Winder W.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E1107-E1112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we (21.Igata M. Motoshima H. Tsuruzoe K. Kojima K. Matsumura T. Kondo T. Taguchi T. Nakamaru K. Yano M. Kukidome D. Matsumoto K. Toyonaga T. Asano T. Nishikawa T. Araki E. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and others (22.Nagata D. Takeda R. Sata M. Satonaka H. Suzuki E. Nagano T. Hirata Y. Circulation. 2004; 110: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) reported that the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is suppressed by activation of AMPK. On the other hand, Jhun et al. (23.Jhun B.S. Jin Q. Oh Y.T. Kim S.S. Kong Y. Cho Y.H. Ha J. Baik H.H. Kang I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 318: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) reported that AICAR suppresses lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-α expression in RAW264.7 murine macrophages. Therefore, AMPK activation may protect against the acceleration of atherosclerosis by suppressing SMC proliferation and inactivating macrophages. However, there is no further evidence regarding the issue of whether AMPK activation can suppress atherosclerotic events in macrophages, such as their proliferation. In the present study, we investigated the effects of AMPK activation on Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation. We found that AICAR-mediated AMPK activation suppressed Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation by suppressing GM-CSF expression and inducing cell cycle arrest. AICAR was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, Ontario, Canada). Antibodies against the total proteins of AMPKα, Rb, p53, and p21cip and phosphospecific antibodies against ACC (Ser-79), AMPKα1 (Thr-172), p53 (Ser-15), Rb (Ser-807/811), ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and Akt were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibodies against the total proteins of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, Akt, p27kip, and β-actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All other chemicals were of the best grade available from commercial sources. Human LDL (d = 1.019–1.063 g/ml) was isolated by ultracentrifugation from plasma samples obtained from consenting normolipidemic subjects after an overnight fast (7.Matsumura T. Sakai M. Kobori S.

LDL was dialyzed against 0.15 m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4). Ox-LDL was prepared by incubation of LDL with 5 μm CuSO4 for 20 h at 37 °C, followed by the addition of 1 mm EDTA and cooling (7.Matsumura T. Sakai M. Kobori S. Biwa T. Takemura T. Matsuda H. Hakamata H. Horiuchi S. Shichiri M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3013-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). The endotoxin level in the prepared Ox-LDL was <1 pg/μg protein, as measured using a Toxicolor System (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) (7.Matsumura T. Sakai M. Kobori S. Biwa T. Takemura T. Matsuda H.

The experimental protocol was approved by the Ethics Review Committee for Animal Experimentation of Kumamoto University. Peritoneal macrophages were collected from anesthetized male C3H/He mice (25–30 g) by peritoneal lavage with 8 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min, resuspended in medium A (RPMI 1640 medium (Nissui Seiyaku Co., Tokyo, Japan)) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin) and incubated in appropriate tissue culture plates for 90 min (7.Matsumura T.

More than 98% of the adherent cells were considered to be macrophages based on four criteria, as described previously (24.Chodakewitz J.A. Kupper T.S. Coleman D.L. J.

Adenoviruses expressing wild-type (WT)-AMPKα1 (Ad-AMPKα1) and dominant-negative (DN)-AMPKα1 (Ad-DN-AMPKα1), which serves as a nonphosphorylatable T172A mutant of the AMPKα1-subunit (26.Ouchi N.

An adenovirus vector that expresses WT p53 (Ad-p53) was kindly gifted from Dr. Shinji Ishikawa (Department of Gatroenterological Surgery, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan). Mouse peritoneal macrophages were infected with the indicated adenoviral vectors at a multiplicity of infection of ∼100, as described previously (28.Senokuchi T. Matsumura T. Sakai M. Yano M.

These conditions conferred expression of LacZ using adenoviruses expressing LacZ (Ad-LacZ) as a marker gene in nearly 100% of the transfected cells. An expression plasmid of human p27kip (pcDNA3FLAG-hp27) was kindly gifted from Dr. Masaki Matsumoto (Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan). Mouse peritoneal macrophages (2 × 106 cells/well) were transfected with pcDNA3FLAG-hp27 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Japan, K.K. Tokyo, Japan) and incubated for 4 h. Then, the medium was removed, and cells were resuspended with medium A (29.Taketa K. Matsumura T. Yano M. Ishii N. Senokuchi T. Motoshima H. Murata Y. Kim-Mitsuyama S. Kawada T. Itabe H. Takeya M.

After a 24-h incubation, cells were treated with recombinant GM-CSF, and Western blot assay and tritiated thymidine incorporation assay were performed as described below. The siRNAs against p21cip and p27kip and an irrelevant 21-nucleotide siRNA duplex as a control were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse peritoneal macrophages (2 × 106 cells/well) were transfected with the siRNA of p21cip, p27kip, or control using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described above. Macrophage monolayers (2 × 106 cells/well) were cultured in 24-well tissue culture plates (15.5 mm in diameter; Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY) in the presence of various effectors for 6 days. For thymidine incorporation assays, the cells were incubated with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for 18 h before the termination of the experiments. Tritiated thymidine incorporation assays were performed as described previously (7.Matsumura T. Sakai M. Kobori S. Biwa T. Takemura T. Matsuda H. Hakamata H. Horiuchi S. Shichiri M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3013-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For cell counting assays, cultured cells were lysed in 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and naphthol blue-black-stained nuclei were counted in a hemocytometer as described previously (11.Biwa T. Hakamata H.

Macrophages (2 × 106 cells/well) were incubated with various effectors, and whole cell lysates were purified as described previously (8.Senokuchi T. Matsumura T. Sakai M. Matsuo T. Yano M. Kiritoshi S. Sonoda K. Kukidome D. Nishikawa T. Araki E. Atherosclerosis. 2004; 176: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations were determined using the Micro BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Samples were separated by electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were incubated with appropriate primary antibodies at a dilution of 1:1,000 for 2 h. After washing, the membranes were stained with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (8.Senokuchi T. Matsumura T. Sakai M. Matsuo T.

Immunoreactive bands were quantified using National Institutes of Health Image analysis software (8.Senokuchi T. Matsumura T. Sakai M. Matsuo T. Yano M. Kiritoshi S. Sonoda K. Kukidome D.

Macrophages (5 × 106 cells/plate) were cultured with various effectors, followed by the addition of 20 μg/ml Ox-LDL. After 4 h of incubation, the media were collected, and the GM-CSF protein concentrations were determined as described previously (10.Hamilton J.A. Myers D. Jessup W. Cochrane F. Byrne R. Whitty G. Moss S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Macrophages (1 × 106 cells/well) were incubated with various effectors for 48 h (apoptosis assays) or 96 h (cell cycle analyses). The cells were then fixed with 70% ethanol, treated with RNase A (0.25 mg/ml), and stained with propidium iodide (0.02 mg/ml). The fractions of cells present in the different cell cycle phases (G0/G1, S, and G2/M) were determined by flow cytometry using a FACStar flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and the ModiFit software (Verity House, Topsham, ME) (21.Igata M. Motoshima H. Tsuruzoe K. Kojima K. Matsumura T. Kondo T. Taguchi T. Nakamaru K. Yano M. Kukidome D. Matsumoto K. Toyonaga T. Asano T. Nishikawa T. Araki E. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Macrophages (1 × 105 cells/well) were incubated with various effectors for 48 h and then subjected to quantification of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments using a cell death detection ELISA kit (Roche Applied Science). In addition, the percentages of sub-G0/G1 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry as described above. All data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were examined for statistical significance by one-factor analysis of variance. Values of p < 0.01 were considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. It has been reported that mouse peritoneal macrophages express high levels of AMPKα1 but express low levels of AMPKα2 (23.Jhun B.S. Jin Q. Oh Y.T. Kim S.S. Kong Y. Cho Y.H. Ha J. Baik H.H. Kang I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 318: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, we focused on AMPKα1 and investigated whether AICAR could induce AMPKα1 activation in mouse peritoneal macrophages. AICAR phosphorylated AMPKα1 and ACC, one of the target molecules of AMPK, in dose-dependent manners (Fig. 1A). Moreover, our time course experiments revealed that AICAR-induced phosphorylation of AMPKα1 and ACC was observed as early as 1 h, which sustained until 7 days (Fig. 1, B and C). These results confirmed that AICAR activated AMPKα1 and its downstream signals in macrophages. Next, we examined the effects of AICAR on OX-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation. Ox-LDL (20 μg/ml) significantly increased [3H]thymidine incorporation into macrophages (Fig. 1D), as previously reported (6.Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Hakamata H. Sasaki T. Yui S. Yamazaki M. Shichiri M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37665-37672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with AICAR at concentrations of 50 μm or higher suppressed the Ox-LDL-induced increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). Cell counting assays confirmed that the Ox-LDL-induced increase in cell number was suppressed by AICAR (Fig. 1E). To clarify the involvement of AMPK activation in AICAR-mediated suppression of macrophage proliferation, we examined the effects of WT-AMPKα1 and DN-AMPKα1 on macrophage proliferation. Expression of WT-AMPKα1 by an adenovirus vector caused ∼2-fold increases in total AMPK expression and AMPKα1 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A) and suppressed Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation (Fig. 2B). Moreover, overexpression of DN-AMPKα1 suppressed the phosphorylation of AMPKα1 and ACC (Fig. 2C) and restored AICAR-mediated suppression of macrophage proliferation (Fig. 2D), suggesting that AICAR-mediated suppression of macrophage proliferation was caused by activation of AMPK. It has been reported that activation of AMPK induces apoptosis in human B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (30.Campàs C. Lopez J.M. Santidrián A.F. Barragán M. Bellosillo B. Colomer D. Gil J. Blood. 2003; 101: 3674-3680Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and human neuroblastoma cells (31.Garcia-Gil M. Pesi R. Perna S. Allegrini S. Giannecchini M. Camici M. Tozzi M.G. Neuroscience. 2003; 117: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effects of AICAR on macrophage apoptosis. At 1,000 μm, AICAR induced macrophage apoptosis (Fig. 3A). However, AICAR at concentrations of 500 μm or lower, which can suppress macrophage proliferation, did not induce macrophage apoptosis (Fig. 3A). To obtain further evidence, the percentages of sub-G0/G1 cells were quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis using propidium iodide staining (Fig. 3, B and C). Neither 10 μm nor 100 μm AICAR increased the percentage of sub-G0/G1 cells in both 48 h and 7 days incubation, whereas 1,000 μm AICAR markedly increased the percentage of sub-G0/G1 cells (Fig. 3, B and C). Therefore, mechanisms other than apoptosis are involved in the suppression of macrophage proliferation by low concentrations of AICAR. We previously reported that ERK1/2-dependent GM-CSF expression is mainly involved in Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation (8.Senokuchi T. Matsumura T. Sakai M. Matsuo T. Yano M. Kiritoshi S. Sonoda K. Kukidome D. Nishikawa T. Araki E. Atherosclerosis. 2004; 176: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 11.Biwa T. Hakamata H. Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Suzuki H. Kodama T. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28305-28313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effects of AICAR on Ox-LDL-induced GM-CSF expression and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. AICAR at 100 μm, which can suppress macrophage proliferation by 85% based on the cell counting assay, slightly but significantly suppressed Ox-LDL-induced GM-CSF protein (Fig. 4A) and mRNA (Fig. 4B) expressions by 29 and 25%, respectively. Moreover, 100 μm AICAR also suppressed Ox-LDL-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation by 22% (Fig. 4C). These results suggested that suppression of ERK1/2-dependent GM-CSF expression was partially, but not mainly, involved in the AICAR-mediated suppression of macrophage proliferation. To clarify possible mechanisms other than GM-CSF production for the AICAR-mediated suppression of macrophage proliferation, we examined the effects of AICAR on GM-CSF-induced macrophage proliferation. At 10 pm, GM-CSF significantly increased [3H]thymidine incorporation into macrophages (Fig. 5A), as previously reported (8.Senokuchi T. Matsumura T. Sakai M. Matsuo T. Yano M. Kiritoshi S. Sonoda K. Kukidome D. Nishikawa T. Araki E. Atherosclerosis. 2004; 176: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with AICAR at concentrations of 50 μm or higher dose-dependently suppressed the GM-CSF-induced increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 5A). Cell counting assays confirmed that the GM-CSF-induced increase in cell number was suppressed by AICAR (Fig. 5B). Overexpression of WT-AMPKα1 suppressed GM-CSF-induced macrophage proliferation (Fig. 5C). Moreover, overexpression of DN-AMPKα1 restored AICAR-mediated suppression of macrophage proliferation (Fig. 5D). These results suggested that AICAR-mediated AMPK activation suppressed GM-CSF-induced macrophage proliferation. We previously reported that GM-CSF expression is involved in Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation (8.Senokuchi T. Matsumura T. Sakai M. Matsuo T. Yano M. Kiritoshi S. Sonoda K. Kukidome D. Nishikawa T. Araki E. Atherosclerosis. 2004; 176: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 11.Biwa T. Hakamata H. Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Suzuki H. Kodama T. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28305-28313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Moreover, among the downstream signals of GM-CSF release, p38 MAPK and its subsequent signaling molecules phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt are mainly involved in Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation. Therefore, we investigated the effects of AICAR on GM-CSF-induced activation of p38 MAPK and Akt. GM-CSF increased the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and Akt (Fig. 6A), as reported previously (8.Senokuchi T. Matsumura T. Sakai M. Matsuo T. Yano M. Kiritoshi S. Sonoda K. Kukidome D. Nishikawa T. Araki E. Atherosclerosis. 2004; 176: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, treatment with AICAR alone also induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and Akt, and AICAR enhanced the GM-CSF-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and Akt (Fig. 6A), suggesting that p38 MAPK/Akt signaling was not the main target for AICAR-mediated suppression of macrophage proliferation. Next, we investigated the effects of AICAR on GM-CSF-induced cell cycle progression by flow cytometry. Compared with control cells treated with GM-CSF, AICAR significantly increased the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase (from 80.3 ± 1.5% to 93.4 ± 1.8%) and decreased the percentages in S phase (from 13.2 ± 0.9% to 6.1 ± 0.5%) and G2/M phase (from 7.2 ± 0.7% to 2.5 ± 0.3%) (Fig. 6B), suggesting that ACAR induced G1 arrest in the proliferating macrophages. Based on the above findings, we investigated the effects of AICAR on the phosphorylation and expression of p53, which is a suppressor of cell cycle progression. Treatment with GM-CSF suppressed the phosphorylation and expression of p53 (Fig. 6, C and D). Pretreatment with AICAR restored the GM-CSF-induced suppression of phosphorylation and expression of p53, and these effects by AICAR were abrogated by the treatment with DN-AMPKα1 (Fig. 6, C and D). Interestingly, treatment with AICAR alone increased the phosphorylation and expression of p53 (Fig. 6, C and D). Moreover, treatment with GM-CSF increased the phosphorylation of Rb (Fig. 6, C and E), which is a regulator of cell cycle progression, and pretreatment with AICAR suppressed this effect (C and E). We further investigated the effects of AICAR on the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) p21cip and p27kip. Treatment with GM-CSF decreased p21cip expression (Fig. 6, C and D). Pretreatment with AICAR rescued the GM-CSF-mediated suppression of p21cip expression, and these effects by AICAR was abrogated by the treatment with DN-AMPKα1 (Fig. 6, C and D). On the other hand, treatment with GM-CSF did not affect p27kip expression (Fig. 6, C and E), whereas pretreatment with AICAR increased p27kip expression (C and E). Moreover, treatment with DN-AMPKα1 attenuated these effects by AICAR (Fig. 6, C and E). Interestingly, treatment with AICAR alone increased the expression of p21cip and p27kip (Fig. 6, C–E). We next investigated the effects of overexpression of p21cip and p27kip on GM-CSF-induced macrophage proliferation. Introduction of Ad-p53 increased the expression and phosphorylation of p53, increased the expression of p21cip, and suppressed GM-CSF-induced increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation into macrophages (Fig. 7, A and B). Moreover, introduction of pcDNA3FLAG-hp27 increased the expression of p27kip and suppressed GM-CSF-induced increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 7, C and D). Finally, we investigated the effects of siRNA for p21cip and/or p27kip on GM-CSF-induced macrophage proliferation. In comparison with the control siRNA, siRNA for p21cip and p27kip suppressed the AICAR-induced expression of p21cip and p27kip, respectively (Fig. 7, E and F). Moreover, treatment with p21cip siRNA and p27kip siRNA restored AICAR-mediated suppression of macrophage proliferation, and additive effect of the siRNAs was observed (Fig. 7G), suggesting that AICAR-mediated increase in the expression of p21cip and p27kip is involved in AICAR-mediated suppression of macrophage proliferation. AMPK is a serine/threonine protein kinase that serves as an energy sensor in all eukaryotic cells (14.Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). Several studies have indicated that AMPK activation by AICAR strongly suppresses cell proliferation in hepatoma HepG2 cells (32.Imamura K. Ogura T. Kishimoto A. Kaminishi M. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 562-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (33.Jones R.G. Plas D.R. Kubek S. Buzzai M. Mu J. Xu Y. Birnbaum M.J. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 283-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). Moreover, we recently reported that AMPK activation suppresses proliferation in human aortic SMCs and rabbit aortic strips (21.Igata M. Motoshima H. Tsuruzoe K. Kojima K. Matsumura T. Kondo T. Taguchi T. Nakamaru K. Yano M. Kukidome D. Matsumoto K. Toyonaga T. Asano T. Nishikawa T. Araki E. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have demonstrated that AICAR-mediated AMPK activation also suppresses Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation. Activation of AMPK induces apoptosis in human B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (30.Campàs C. Lopez J.M. Santidrián A.F. Barragán M. Bellosillo B. Colomer D. Gil J. Blood. 2003; 101: 3674-3680Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and human neuroblastoma cells (31.Garcia-Gil M. Pesi R. Perna S. Allegrini S. Giannecchini M. Camici M. Tozzi M.G. Neuroscience. 2003; 117: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Consequently, we speculated that the inhibitory effects of AMPK activation would be mediated by macrophage apoptosis. In fact, we found for the first time that 1 mm AICAR induced macrophage apoptosis. However, suppression of macrophage proliferation was still observed at low concentrations of AICAR (<1 mm). Therefore, mechanisms other than apoptosis are involved in the suppression of macrophage proliferation. Our previous studies indicated that Ox-LDL-induced GM-CSF production is mainly involved in macrophage proliferation (8.Senokuchi T. Matsumura T. Sakai M. Matsuo T. Yano M. Kiritoshi S. Sonoda K. Kukidome D. Nishikawa T. Araki E. Atherosclerosis. 2004; 176: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 11.Biwa T. Hakamata H. Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Suzuki H. Kodama T. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28305-28313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mechanisms of Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation can be divided into two parts: (i) intracellular signaling pathway before GM-CSF release, and (ii) proliferation signaling pathway through GM-CSF receptors. We demonstrated previously that Ox-LDL induces ERK1/2 activation and subsequently leads to GM-CSF expression in macrophages (8.Senokuchi T. Matsumura T. Sakai M. Matsuo T. Yano M. Kiritoshi S. Sonoda K. Kukidome D. Nishikawa T. Araki E. Atherosclerosis. 2004; 176: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 11.Biwa T. Hakamata H. Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Suzuki H. Kodama T. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28305-28313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Hence, ERK1/2-dependent GM-CSF expression is one of the key phenomena for Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation. AMPK activation suppresses angiotensin II-induced ERK1/2 activation in SMCs (22.Nagata D. Takeda R. Sata M. Satonaka H. Suzuki E. Nagano T. Hirata Y. Circulation. 2004; 110: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). On the other hand, AMPK activation does not suppress lipopolysaccharide-induced ERK1/2 activation in RAW264.7 cells (23.Jhun B.S. Jin Q. Oh Y.T. Kim S.S. Kong Y. Cho Y.H. Ha J. Baik H.H. Kang I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 318: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effects of AMPK activation on ERK1/2 activation may depend on the cell types involved or its inducers. In the present study, we found that AMPK activation suppressed Ox-LDL-induced ERK1/2 activation by 22% and GM-CSF protein and mRNA expressions by 29 and 25%, respectively, in mouse peritoneal macrophages. These results suggest that suppression of the GM-CSF expression pathway is only partially involved and that other mechanisms, such as modification of the downstream signaling pathway of GM-CSF release, are involved in AMPK-mediated suppression of macrophage proliferation. As expected, we found that AMPK activation suppressed the macrophage proliferation induced by GM-CSF, suggesting that AMPK activation inhibits Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation by suppressing the subsequent signaling of GM-CSF release. We further found that AMPK activation did not suppress p38 MAPK/Akt signaling, which is involved in GM-CSF-induced macrophage proliferation. Therefore, we speculated that the suppressive effects of AMPK on Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation depended on cell cycle arrest, and subsequently found that AICAR significantly increased the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase and decreased the percentages in S phase and G2/M phase. Therefore, AMPK-induced cell cycle arrest should be the main cause of the AMPK-mediated suppression of macrophage proliferation. Mammalian cell proliferation is controlled by the cell cycle machinery. Cell cycle progression is managed positively by CDKs and their cyclin-regulatory subunits (34.Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4986) Google Scholar) and managed negatively by CDKIs and tumor suppressor genes (35.Graña X. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 211-219PubMed Google Scholar). Mitogenic factors bind to their receptors and initiate a series of events resulting in the activation of CDKs, which in turn regulate cell cycle progression, DNA synthesis, DNA replication, and mitosis. The final common pathway leading to the G0/G1/S transition is the CDK-induced hyperphosphorylation of Rb, which functions as a molecular switch that commits a cell to DNA replication. We found that GM-CSF phosphorylated Rb protein in macrophages and that this effect was suppressed by AICAR. Therefore, AMPK activation induces cell cycle arrest via inactivation of Rb. CDKIs, such as p21cip and p27kip, negatively regulate the cell cycle by inhibiting cyclin/CDK activities and Rb phosphorylation, resulting in G1 arrest (36.Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1994; 79: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the expression and functions of the tumor suppressor p53 are tightly regulated by its phosphorylation state. Cellular stresses, such as γ-irradiation and glucose deprivation, induce phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 (37.Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar, 33.Jones R.G. Plas D.R. Kubek S. Buzzai M. Mu J. Xu Y. Birnbaum M.J. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 283-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated p53 induces cell-growth arrest and/or apoptosis through transcriptional regulation of p53 response genes such as p21cip and p53AIP1 (39.Bode A.M. Dong Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 4: 793-805Crossref Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). It has been reported that AMPK activation by AICAR inhibits the proliferation of various cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo by increasing p21cip, p27kip, and p53 (38.Rattan R. Giri S. Singh A.K. Singh I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39582-39593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Our group previously reported that AMPK activation suppresses the proliferation of vascular SMCs by increasing the phosphorylation of p53 and subsequent expression of p21cip (21.Igata M. Motoshima H. Tsuruzoe K. Kojima K. Matsumura T. Kondo T. Taguchi T. Nakamaru K. Yano M. Kukidome D. Matsumoto K. Toyonaga T. Asano T. Nishikawa T. Araki E. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In macrophages, we newly found that GM-CSF suppressed the phosphorylation of p53 and expression of p21cip and that AICAR restored these effects. Interestingly, expression of p27kip was not abundant in unstimulated macrophages and remained unaffected by GM-CSF. However, AICAR drastically increased the expression of p27kip. Moreover, we found that AICAR alone increased the phosphorylation and expression of p53 and the expression of p21cip and p27kip. Furthermore, the overexpression of p53-p21cip and p27kip suppressed GM-CSF-induced macrophage proliferation, and the knockdown of p21cip and p27kip attenuated AICAR-mediated suppression of macrophage proliferation. These results suggest that the suppressive effects of AMPK activation on macrophage proliferation were mediated not by the interruption of GM-CSF-mediated intracellular signal pathway but by direct cell cycle arrest through the induction of p53 phosphorylation, p21cip expression, and p27kip expression. In conclusion, we have revealed for the first time that activation of AMPK suppresses Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation by inhibiting the expression of GM-CSF and inducing cell cycle arrest. Because the proliferation of vascular cells including macrophages is a key event in the development and progression of atherosclerosis (1.Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19370) Google Scholar, 3.Gordon D. Reidy M.A. Benditt E.P. Schwartz S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

https://openalex.org/W2040219737,"The common approach to electronic publishing three-dimensional biological data in peer-reviewed journals or for disseminating such data within the scientific community has historically required the writing of a two dimensional flat and non-interactive document. The frequent limit on the number of two dimensional color figures permitted in journals further reduces the opportunities for the provision of visualizations. Often the targeted readers of these documents are not expert in the gathering and manipulation of the fundamental data from which the document was provided. For example, three-dimensional protein structures and complexes require the downloading of coordinates from the PDB [1] and then the knowledge and skill to operate a standalone program to simply reproduce the view corresponding to the figure in question and to further interpret it. Further data, such as protein sequences, parts of the electron density [2], etc., may also need to be obtained from remote databases and manipulated to interpret the results and conclusions of the underlying publication. This approach is clearly sub-optimal for scientists who have no experience in protein structure and its visualization.

A breakthrough in the ability to collate and integrate pertinent data types and annotations relating to such data into one file that is compact and platform-independent was the iSee platform [3]. In this approach, arbitrary numbers of three-dimensional structural visualizations are possible and the renditions are embedded via hyperlinks in a textual annotation akin to a standard scientific publication. Previously these so-called iSee ‘datapacks’ could be read and viewed using freely-available browser software. A number of other approaches to visualize three-dimensional structures within the context of text have been made since iSee was developed (e.g. [4]–[6]). However, neither these nor iSee have been able to provide full integration within the requirements of peer-reviewed publications and to support both the web delivery of an electronic publication and the local file delivery in a consistent manner. We have recognized that there is a clear requirement to improve the integration and delivery for publication and general dissemination of this type of work.

In this overview we provide details of our activeICM approach for the peer-reviewed publishing and sharing of integrated and interactive iSee datapacks, or 3D documents, which is the core technology of the PLoS ONE Collection of which this overview paper is part of."
https://openalex.org/W2168520556,"Telomerase is essential for telomere maintenance, and its activation is thought to be a critical step in cellular immortalization and tumorigenesis. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is a major component of telomerase activity. We show here that hTERT is expressed soon after lymphocyte activation and that its expression is inhibited by rapamycin, wortmannin, and FK506, which was the most potent inhibitor. These results suggest a potential role for the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) in the regulation of hTERT expression. Five putative NFAT-binding sites were identified in the hTERT promoter. In luciferase assays, the hTERT promoter was activated by overexpressed NFAT1. Moreover, serial deletions revealed that the promoter activation was mainly due to a −40 NFAT1-binding site flanked by two SP1-binding sites. Mutation of the −40 NFAT-binding site caused a 53% reduction in the transcriptional activity of hTERT promoter. Simultaneous mutations of the −40 NFAT-responsive element together with one or both SP1-binding sites led to a more dramatic decrease in luciferase activity than single mutations, suggesting a functional synergy between NFAT1 and SP1 in hTERT transcriptional regulation. NFAT1 overexpression in MCF7 and Jurkat cell lines induced an increase in endogenous hTERT mRNA expression. Inversely, its down-regulation was induced by NFAT1 silencing. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that NFAT1 directly binds to two sites (−40 and −775) in the endogenous hTERT promoter. Thus, we show for the first time the direct involvement of NFAT1 in the transcriptional regulation of hTERT.

https://openalex.org/W2078174444,"The 26 S proteasome complex that comprises the 20 S core and 19 S regulatory (with six ATPases) particles is engaged in an ATP-dependent degradation of a variety of key regulatory proteins and, thus, controls important cellular processes. Interestingly, several recent studies have implicated the 19 S regulatory particle in controlling eukaryotic transcriptional initiation or activation independently of the 20 S core particle. However, the mechanism of action of the 19 S proteasome subcomplex in regulation of eukaryotic transcriptional activation is not clearly understood in vivo. Here, using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay in conjunction with mutational and transcriptional analyses in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we show that the 19 S proteasomal subcomplex establishes a specific protein interaction network at the upstream activating sequence of the promoter. Such an interaction network is essential for formation of the preinitiation complex at the core promoter to initiate transcription. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the formation of the transcription complex assembly at the promoter is dependent on 19 S ATPase activity. Intriguingly, 19 S ATPases appear to cross-talk for stimulation of the assembly of transcription factors at the promoter. Together, these results provide significant insights as to how the 19 S proteasome subcomplex regulates the formation of the active transcription complex assembly (and, hence, transcriptional initiation) at the promoter in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2069294862,"Replication initiation is a crucial step in genome duplication and homohexameric DnaB helicase plays a central role in the replication initiation process by unwinding the duplex DNA and interacting with several other proteins during the process of replication. N-terminal domain of DnaB is critical for helicase activity and for DnaG primase interactions. We present here the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of H. pylori DnaB (HpDnaB) helicase at 2.2 Å resolution and compare the structural differences among helicases and correlate with the functional differences. The structural details of NTD suggest that the linker region between NTD and C-terminal helicase domain plays a vital role in accurate assembly of NTD dimers. The sequence analysis of the linker regions from several helicases reveals that they should form four helix bundles. We also report the characterization of H. pylori DnaG primase and study the helicase-primase interactions, where HpDnaG primase stimulates DNA unwinding activity of HpDnaB suggesting presence of helicase-primase cohort at the replication fork. The protein-protein interaction study of C-terminal domain of primase and different deletion constructs of helicase suggests that linker is essential for proper conformation of NTD to interact strongly with HpDnaG. The surface charge distribution on the primase binding surface of NTDs of various helicases suggests that DnaB-DnaG interaction and stability of the complex is most probably charge dependent. Structure of the linker and helicase-primase interactions indicate that HpDnaB differs greatly from E.coli DnaB despite both belong to gram negative bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2067947674,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae NTE1 gene encodes an evolutionarily conserved phospholipase B localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that degrades phosphatidylcholine (PC) generating glycerophosphocholine and free fatty acids. We show here that the activity of NTE1-encoded phospholipase B (Nte1p) prevents the attenuation of transcription of genes encoding enzymes involved in phospholipid synthesis in response to increased rates of PC synthesis by affecting the nuclear localization of the transcriptional repressor Opi1p. Nte1p activity becomes necessary for cells growing in inositol-free media under conditions of high rates of PC synthesis elicited by the presence of choline at 37 degrees C. The specific choline transporter encoded by the HNM1 gene is necessary for the burst of PC synthesis observed at 37 degrees C as follows: (i) Nte1p is dispensable in an hnm1Delta strain under these conditions, and (ii) there is a 3-fold increase in the rate of choline transport via the Hnm1p choline transporter upon a shift to 37 degrees C. Overexpression of NTE1 alleviated the inositol auxotrophy of a plethora of mutants, including scs2Delta, scs3Delta, ire1Delta, and hac1Delta among others. Overexpression of NTE1 sustained phospholipid synthesis gene transcription under conditions that normally repress transcription. This effect was also observed in a strain defective in the activation of free fatty acids for phosphatidic acid synthesis. No changes in the levels of phosphatidic acid were detected under conditions of altered expression of NTE1. Consistent with a synthetic impairment between challenged ER function and inositol deprivation, increased expression of NTE1 improved the growth of cells exposed to tunicamycin in the absence of inositol. We describe a new role for Nte1p toward membrane homeostasis regulating phospholipid synthesis gene transcription. We propose that Nte1p activity, by controlling PC abundance at the ER, affects lateral membrane packing and that this parameter, in turn, impacts the repressing transcriptional activity of Opi1p, the main regulator of phospholipid synthesis gene transcription."

In this article the effect of the loss of myosin VI no insert isoform (NoI) on endocytosis in nonpolarized cells was examined. The absence of myosin VI in fibroblasts derived from the Snell's waltzer mouse (myosin VI knock-out) gives rise to defective clathrin-mediated endocytosis with shallow clathrin-coated pits and a strong reduction in the internalization of clathrin-coated vesicles.

Moreover, it was recently observed that the transferrin receptor (TfR), a nonsignaling receptor that is internalized canonically by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, can also be endocytosed by a clathrin/dynamin-independent, cholesterol-dependent pathway (8.Horonchik L.

Caveolae were first observed more than 50 years ago on the surface of endothelial cells; caveola-mediated endocytosis is the best described clathrin-independent uptake route. Caveolae, flask-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane, are specialized lipid raft domains that are rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids, with shape and structural organization maintained by the integral membrane protein caveolin. Although not all mammalian cells express caveolin, caveolae are very abundant at the plasma membrane of fibroblasts, adipocytes, and endothelial and smooth muscle cells; however, the precise uptake mechanism involved and how it is triggered and regulated are thus far rather poorly understood. Motor proteins such as myosin VI have been shown to be involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (9.Buss F. Arden S.D. Lindsay M. Luzio J.P. Kendrick-Jones J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3676-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 10.Morris S.M. Arden S.D. Roberts R.C. Kendrick-Jones J. Cooper J.A. Luzio J.P. Buss F.

Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 282: F785-F794Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Myosin VI is a unique actin-based motor protein that moves toward the minus end of actin filaments, in the opposite direction to all other myosins characterized thus far (14.Wells A.L. Lin A.W. Chen L.Q. Safer D. Cain S.M. Hasson T. Carragher B.O. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, four alternatively spliced myosin VI isoforms have been identified that contain, in the tail region, no insert (NoI), a small insert (SI; 9 amino acids), a large insert (LI; 21–31 amino acids), or both the small and large inserts (S+L). The large insert isoform is expressed in polarized cells at the apical domain, whereas the NoI and the SI are expressed either in basolateral or apical domains (15.Au J.S. Puri C. Ihrke G. Kendrick-Jones J. Buss F. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Moreover, the NoI isoform is expressed in almost all unpolarized cell (9.Buss F. Arden S.D. Lindsay M. Luzio J.P. Kendrick-Jones J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3676-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 16.Dance A.L. Miller M. Seragaki S. Aryal P. White B. Aschenbrenner L. Hasson T. Traffic. 2004; 5: 798-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The endogenous myosin VI LI isoform in polarized Caco2 cells is associated with clathrin-coated structures at the apical domain (9.Buss F. Arden S.D. Lindsay M. Luzio J.P. Kendrick-Jones J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3676-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), but in other cell lines expressing the LI isoform, such as ARPE-19 cells, myosin VI does not co-localize with clathrin (17.Aschenbrenner L. Lee T. Hasson T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2728-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) or the clathrin adaptor protein, AP-2 (16.Dance A.L. Miller M. Seragaki S. Aryal P. White B. Aschenbrenner L. Hasson T. Traffic. 2004; 5: 798-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). When the LI isoform tail, which works as a myosin VI dominant negative inhibitor, is expressed in nonpolarized cells, it is able to localize to clathrin-coated structures but gives rise to a defect in transferrin receptor endocytosis (9.Buss F. Arden S.D. Lindsay M. Luzio J.P. Kendrick-Jones J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3676-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Overexpressing the myosin VI tail in ARPE-19 cells affects the TfR endocytic route (17.Aschenbrenner L. Lee T. Hasson T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2728-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The full-length myosin VI NoI splice isoform shows reduced targeting to clathrin-coated structures in nonpolarized rat fibroblast (NRK) cells and in the ARPE-19 cell line and a reduced ability to bring the uncoated vesicles out of the plasma membrane actin-rich region (17.Aschenbrenner L. Lee T. Hasson T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2728-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Both myosin VI LI and NoI isoforms are, however, able to bind the endocytic protein Disabled-2 (Dab2) (10.Morris S.M. Arden S.D. Roberts R.C. Kendrick-Jones J. Cooper J.A. Luzio J.P. Buss F. Traffic. 2002; 3: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Dab2 is considered an endocytic adaptor protein because it displays two DPF amino acid motifs, which are able to bind to the clathrin adaptor protein, AP-2 (10.Morris S.M. Arden S.D. Roberts R.C. Kendrick-Jones J. Cooper J.A. Luzio J.P. Buss F. Traffic. 2002; 3: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 18.Inoue A. Sato O. Homma K. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). All myosin VI isoforms are recruited to clathrin-coated structures in cells that overexpress Dab2 (16.Dance A.L. Miller M. Seragaki S. Aryal P. White B. Aschenbrenner L. Hasson T. Traffic. 2004; 5: 798-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The recruitment and targeting of myosin VI to clathrin-coated structures at the plasma membrane require that Dab2 binds to the WWY sequence motif, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) binds to the WKSKNKKR region in the C-terminal cargo-binding domain of myosin VI (12.Spudich G. Chibalina M.V. Au J.S. Arden S.D. Buss F. Kendrick-Jones J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These binding sites are conserved in all myosin VI isoforms. In fact when the myosin VI NoI or LI isoform tails are transfected into NRK cells, both isoforms are targeted to clathrin-coated structures (16.Dance A.L. Miller M. Seragaki S. Aryal P. White B. Aschenbrenner L. Hasson T. Traffic. 2004; 5: 798-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). PIP2 is also able to bind Dab2 and clathrin adaptor protein AP-2 directly (19.Yun M. Keshvara L.

Myosin VI has a number of different functions in membrane trafficking, such as the sorting and delivering of AP-1B-dependent cargo to the basolateral domain in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (15.Au J.S. Puri C. Ihrke G. Kendrick-Jones J. Buss F. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and the transport of transferrin receptor to the endocytic recycling compartment (21.Inoue T. Kon T. Ohkura R. Yamakawa H.

Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 4278-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the Snell's waltzer mouse (sv/sv; the myosin knock-out) an intragenic deletion of the Myo6 gene results in a complete lack of myosin VI expression (23.Avraham K.B. Hasson T. Steel K.P. Kingsley D.M. Russell L.B. Mooseker M.S. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The most obvious phenotype in the sv/sv mouse is an inner ear defect resulting in circling, head tossing, deafness, and hyperactivity (24.Deol M.S. Green M.C. Genet. Res. 1966; 8: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Lack of myosin VI in the sv/sv mouse gives rise to degeneration and fusion of the stereocilia in cochlea hair cells (25.Self T. Sobe T. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Avraham K.B. Steel K.P. Dev. Biol. 1999; 214: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), whereas in hippocampal neurons there are defects in AMPA receptor endocytosis that result in altered synapse structure and astrogliosis (26.Osterweil E. Wells D.G. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In addition in the apical domain of enterocyte brush border cells, there is a defect in the endocytosis of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (27.Ameen N. Apodaca G. Traffic. 2007; 8: 998-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In humans a missense mutation in the myosin VI gene was recently identified in an Italian family with a nonsyndromic dominant form of deafness (28.Melchionda S. Ahituv N. Bisceglia L. Sobe T. Glaser F. Rabionet R. Arbones M.L. Notarangelo A. Di Iorio E. Carella M. Zelante L. Estivill X. Avraham K.B. Gasparini P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 635-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This C442Y mutation in the motor domain is close to the ATP binding pocket and dramatically increases the rate of ADP dissociation (29.Sato O. White H.D. Inoue A. Belknap B. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28844-28854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Several different mutations in the myosin VI gene have also been identified in three Pakistani families suffering from recessive deafness (30.Ahmed Z.M. Morell R.J. Riazuddin S. Gropman A. Shaukat S. Ahmad M.M. Mohiddin S.A. Fananapazir L. Caruso R.C. Husnain T. Khan S.N. Riazuddin S. Griffith A.J. Friedman T.B. Wilcox E.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 72: 1315-1322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The relatively mild phenotypes observed in the sv/sv mouse are in sharp contrast to the apparently essential roles that myosin VI appears to play in many intracellular processes, especially its crucial role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Therefore, to determine how the sv/sv mouse is able to compensate for the lack of myosin VI, the endocytic pathway followed by the TfR (the prototype receptor internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis) was studied in sv/sv fibroblasts. In these fibroblasts a significant defect in clathrin-coated vesicle formation and a relocalization of the TfR from clathrin-coated structures (CCS) to caveolae were observed. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis was rescued in these sv/sv fibroblasts by expressing a full-length myosin VI NoI isoform construct. Recruitment of the TfR into caveolae was also observed in siRNA myosin VI knockdown (KD) HeLa cells, in cells overexpressing the dominant negative myosin VI tail, and in human fibroblasts expressing a myosin VI mutant with altered motor properties. In HeLa cells depleted of both myosin VI and caveolin-1, transferrin internalization was inhibited. These results suggest that loss of myosin VI gives rise to a severe defect in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and to compensate for this defect, alternative endocytic pathways are up-regulated to allow plasma membrane receptors such as the transferrin receptor to be internalized and follow their normal endocytic route. In this scenario, the clathrin adaptor protein, AP-2, necessary for transferrin receptor internalization, is also relocalized to caveolae. The antibodies used were as follows: rabbit anti-myosin VI (Sigma), rabbit anti-myosin VI (C-terminal), and rabbit anti-myosin VI (tail) (gifts from Folma Buss); rabbit anti-caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); rabbit anti-caveolin-1 (BD Biosciences); mouse anti-AP-2 (Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO); rabbit anti-GFP (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR); mouse anti-TfR (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA); mouse anti-TfR 5E9C11 (ATCC, Manassas, VA); rabbit anti-mouse (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark); mouse anti-clathrin (Abcam); human Tf-Alexa-555 (Invitrogen); human Tf-HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch); and protein A-gold (Cell Microscopy Centre, Utrecht, The Netherland). Filipin, Dynasore, water-soluble cholesterol, and fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin were from Sigma. d-Lactosyl-β1–1′-N-octanoyl-d-erythro-sphingosine (C8-LacCer) was from Avanti Polar Lipids. Secondary fluorochrome-labeled antibodies were from Molecular Probes. The HeLa cell line stably expressing myosin VI NoI tail and clathrin-GFP light chain were gifts from Folma Buss. Snell's waltzer (sv/sv) and wild type (wt/wt) mouse fibroblasts were obtained from adult mice using the following procedure. 1 cm of mouse tail was disinfected with ethanol, cut, and placed in a mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (1000 units/ml)/streptomycin (1 mg/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mm). The derma was scraped, homogenized with a 25-gauge needle, and cultured in a 5-cm Petri dish in the same medium described above. Primary fibroblasts were subcultured at low density with medium supplemented with 20% serum to obtain stable clones. The same procedure was performed for wt/wt and myosin VI C442Y mutant human fibroblasts to obtain stable cell lines. Mouse and human fibroblasts or HeLa cells were fixed for immunoelectron microscopy with a mixture of 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were then prepared for ultrathin cryosectioning and immunogold-labeled according to the protocol described previously (4.Sigismund S. Woelk T. Puri C. Maspero E. Tacchetti C. Transidico P. Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 2760-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). The sections were observed in a Philips CM100 transmission electron microscope. Following the normal Epon embedding technique, mouse fibroblasts were fixed in growing condition. The cells were fixed and embedded following the procedure described previously (31.Puri C. Tosoni D. Comai R. Rabellino A. Segat D. Caneva F. Luzzi P. Di Fiore P.P. Tacchetti C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2704-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Ruthenium red fixation was performed using a method described previously (31.Puri C. Tosoni D. Comai R. Rabellino A. Segat D. Caneva F. Luzzi P. Di Fiore P.P. Tacchetti C. Mol. Biol.

Morphometric analysis of immunogold labeling was performed at a magnification of ×10,500 on randomly selected cells profiles with the nucleus for each experiment. Ten random cell profiles were counted for each condition. Clathrin-coated structures were identified directly by the dark shadow of the clathrin coating, whereas caveolae were identified by caveolin-1 labeling. Quantitation of the amount of clathrin-coated structures or caveolae was normalized for a 1000-μm length of cell perimeter. The cell profiles were calculated on low magnification pictures by the “intersection method” (33.Rabouille C. Misteli T. Watson R. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The histograms show the percentage of TfR (calculated from the number of gold particles) present on labeled caveolae or clathrin-coated structures (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8). Further details of each experiment are given in the figure legends (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8). HRP and Tf-HRP uptake was performed as described previously (34.Damke H. Baba T. van der Bliek A.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 35.Parton R.G. Joggerst B. Simons K. J.

Briefly, the cells were grown on 35-mm dishes, serum-starved for 1 h, washed twice in PBS/Ca2+Mg2+, and incubated with 4 mg/ml HRP or 30 μg/ml Tf-HRP for different time periods (5–20 min) at 37 °C in a continuous uptake assay. After the 37 °C uptake, all of the dishes were placed on ice, treated for 10 min with PBS/0.1% Pronase as the stripping/detaching agent, and solubilized in PBS/0.5% Triton X-100. The cell lysates were incubated in the dark for 20 min with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine. The reaction was stopped with 1 m H2SO4, and absorbances were read at 450 nm. The Tf-HRP data were expressed as percentage of the amount of plasma membrane (34.Damke H. Baba T. van der Bliek A.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The HRP data were normalized for protein concentrations using the BCA protein assay and expressed as arbitrary units. All experiments were performed in duplicate. Dynasore, filipin, filipin/cholesterol, and c8-LacCer treatments were performed using methods described previously (4.Sigismund S. Woelk T. Puri C. Maspero E. Tacchetti C. Transidico P. Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 2760-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 38.Imelli N. Meier O. Boucke K. Hemmi S.

Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, wt/wt and sv/sv fibroblasts were starved for 1 h in serum-free medium and incubated for 1 h with filipin (1.2 μg/ml), filipin/cholesterol (1.2 μg/ml-1 mm), Dynasore (120 mm), and c8-LacCer (10 μm) followed by incubation with Tf-HRP in continuous uptake for 5 min. The cells were then treated as described above. HeLa cells were transfected twice with human myosin VI or/and caveolin-1 ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNAs (Dharmacon) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) as described previously (41.Arden S.D. Puri C. Au J.S. Kendrick-Jones J. Buss F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 4750-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The mock cells were transfected either with a control siRNA such as a scrambled oligo or with Oligofectamine only. Western blot analysis was used to check the level of myosin VI/caveolin-1 in these cells. HeLa stable cell lines that down-regulate myosin VI were obtained with SureSilencingTM myosin VI small hairpin RNA plasmids (SuperArray-Bioscience Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The GFP-tagged full-length myosin VI NoI isoform was cloned into the PIRESneo vector (Invitrogen) and transfected into sv/sv mouse fibroblasts using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science). Stable sv/sv mouse fibroblasts cell lines were selected with 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). A plug of individual clones for each construct was grown in selective medium, and the population of highly expressing cells was enriched by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. To assess the expression of myosin VI in HeLa cells and in human and in mouse fibroblasts, the Purescript® RNA isolation kit was used (Gentra Systems). The resulting RNAs were used in reverse transcription-PCR reactions using primers flanking the myosin VI tail region. The expression levels of the different myosin VI isoforms were visualized by running the PCR products on agarose gels. HeLa cells, mock or expressing GFP-myosin NoI isoform or GFP-myosin VI NoI tail, were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and processed for indirect immunofluorescence using rabbit anti-myosin VI or rabbit anti-GFP and mouse anti-AP-2 followed by secondary antibodies coupled with Alexa-488 or Alexa-555. Snell's waltzer and wt/wt fibroblasts were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with Tf-Alexa-555 (25 μg/ml). The cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and labeled with anti-AP-2 antibody, clathrin, and caveolin-1. The cells were visualized with a Zeiss Axioplan epifluorescence microscope, a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal microscope, or a Zeiss TIRF 3 microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Inc.). wt/wt and sv/sv fibroblasts were transfected with clathrin-GFP light chain and analyzed by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (TIRF 3, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Inc.). 500 fields of 150 × 150 pixels were analyzed by Volocity software, version 5 (Improvision-PerkinElmer). wt/wt and sv/sv fibroblasts or HeLa cells in steady state conditions were lysated directly in SDS-sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Blots were developed using ECL detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). To investigate the role of myosin VI in clathrin-mediated endocytosis at the ultrastructural level, skin fibroblasts were isolated from wild type and Snell's waltzer mice that lack myosin VI. Primary fibroblasts were cultured for several weeks to generate spontaneous immortalized cell lines. Using a PCR-based strategy, we established that in nonpolarized human fibroblasts and HeLa cells, only the myosin VI NoI isoform was expressed, whereas in mouse fibroblasts we detected both NoI and myosin VI SI isoforms (Fig. 1A). Previous studies had shown that in NRK cells the myosin VI LI isoform is recruited with high affinity to CCS at the plasma membrane, whereas the endogenous myosin VI NoI isoform shows only partial co-localization with clathrin (9.Buss F. Arden S.D. Lindsay M. Luzio J.P. Kendrick-Jones J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3676-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In a HeLa cell line overexpressing either full-length GFP-myosin VI NoI or GFP-myosin VI NoI tail, a significant increase in the number of AP-2 positive structures containing full-length myosin VI NoI or only the NoI tail were observed compared with the endogenous myosin VI (Fig. 1C). The NoI tail domain is targeted to clathrin-coated structures, but without a functional motor domain it cannot be released again, which results in the increased co-localization of the NoI tail with AP-2 (Fig. 1C, i–l). Similar results were obtained in wild type (wt/wt) mouse fibroblasts for the endogenous myosin VI and overexpressing full-length myosin VI NoI or the NoI tail (supplemental Fig. 1). In HeLa and mouse fibroblasts there is only a small amount of co-localization of the endogenous myosin VI with AP-2, but it is specific, as demonstrated in the experiments shown in supplemental Fig. 2. Endogenous myosin VI was detected at the ultrastructural level in clathrin-coated pits and vesicles in HeLa cells and in human and mouse fibroblasts using a range of different polyclonal antibodies against myosin VI (Fig. 1, B and D, a–e), whereas in the HeLa cell line expressing full-length GFP-myosin VI NoI, its localization was detected using a polyclonal antibody to GFP (Fig. 1D, f). The specificities of the myosin VI antibodies used are shown in a Western blot (Fig. 1B). These results demonstrate that the myosin VI NoI isoform, which is the isoform expressed in nonpolarized cells, can be recruited to clathrin-coated structures at the plasma membrane. Previous studies on sv/sv mice have shown that the absence of myosin VI leads to a reduction in AMPA receptor endocytosis in hippocampal neurons (26.Osterweil E. Wells D.G. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and a defect in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator internalization in enterocytes (27.Ameen N. Apodaca G. Traffic. 2007; 8: 998-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However it is not known whether other ubiquitous plasma membrane receptors such as TfR are internalized normally in the absence of myosin VI. So to compare clathrin-coated pit and vesicle formation at the ultrastructural level in sv/sv and wt/wt fibroblasts, they were fixed and embedded in Epon, and sections were cut and analyzed by EM. sv/sv fibroblasts showed mostly flat, shallow, clathrin-coated pit profiles at the plasma membrane and few clathrin-coated vesicle profiles (clathrin-coated structures with no connection with the plasma membrane). Representative micrographs of wt/wt and sv/sv fibroblasts are shown in Fig. 2A. To quantify this observation, a morphometric analysis from four independent experiments was performed. Cross-sections of CCS were divided into shallow clathrin-coated pits (panel I), invaginated clathrin-coated pits (panel II), and clathrin-coated structures without an obvious connection with the plasma membrane, which can be either a pit or"
https://openalex.org/W1981635214,"Background UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc 6-kinase, GNE, is a bi-functional enzyme that plays a key role in sialic acid biosynthesis. Mutations of the GNE protein cause sialurea or autosomal recessive inclusion body myopathy/Nonaka myopathy. GNE is the only human protein that contains a kinase domain belonging to the ROK (repressor, ORF, kinase) family. Principal Findings We solved the structure of the GNE kinase domain in the ligand-free state. The protein exists predominantly as a dimer in solution, with small populations of monomer and higher-order oligomer in equilibrium with the dimer. Crystal packing analysis reveals the existence of a crystallographic hexamer, and that the kinase domain dimerizes through the C-lobe subdomain. Mapping of disease-related missense mutations onto the kinase domain structure revealed that the mutation sites could be classified into four different groups based on the location – dimer interface, interlobar helices, protein surface, or within other secondary structural elements. Conclusions The crystal structure of the kinase domain of GNE provides a structural basis for understanding disease-causing mutations and a model of hexameric wild type full length enzyme.

As a result of these changes, the target gene spectrum v-Myb differs from that of c-Myb. We recently showed that the chicken mim-1 gene, a c-Myb target gene that is not activated by v-Myb harbors a powerful cell type-specific and Myb-inducible enhancer in addition to a Myb-responsive promoter. We now show that Myb-dependent activation of the mim-1 gene is accompanied by extensive remodeling of the nucleosomal architecture at the enhancer. We found that the mim-1 enhancer region also harbors a promoter whose activity is stimulated by Myb and which directs the transcription of an apparently non-coding RNA. Furthermore, our data show that the oncogenic mutations of AMV have disrupted the ability of v-Myb to induce remodeling of chromatin structure at the mim-1 enhancer. Together, our results demonstrate for the first time directly that Myb induces alterations of the nucleosomal organization at a relevant target site and provide new insight into the functional consequences of the oncogenic amino acid substitutions.

https://openalex.org/W2012132407,"Protein kinase A (PKA) is targeted to distinct subcellular localizations by specific protein kinase A anchoring proteins (AKAPs). AKAPs are divided into subclasses based on their ability to bind type I or type II PKA or both. Dual-specificity AKAPs were recently reported to have an additional PKA binding determinant called the RI specifier region. A bioinformatic search with the consensus RI specifier region identified a novel AKAP, the splicing factor arginine/serine-rich 17A (SFRS17A). Here, we show by a variety of protein interaction assays that SFRS17A binds both type I and type II PKA in vitro and inside cells, demonstrating that SFRS17A is a dual-specific AKAP. Moreover, immunofluorescence experiments show that SFRS17A colocalizes with the catalytic subunit of PKA as well as the splicing factor SC35 in splicing factor compartments. Using the E1A minigene splicing assay, we found that expression of wild type SFRS17A conferred regulation of E1A alternative splicing, whereas the mutant SFRS17A, which is unable to bind PKA, did not. Our data suggest that SFRS17A is an AKAP involved in regulation of pre-mRNA splicing possibly by docking a pool of PKA in splicing factor compartments."
https://openalex.org/W2051277066,"Background The distribution pattern of the earthworm gut microbiota at the host population level is of fundamental importance to understand host-microbiota interactions. Our current understanding of these interactions is very limited. Since feeding represents a main perturbation of the gut microbiota, we determined the effect of a single dose of feed on the microbiota associated with an earthworm population in a simulated microenvironment. Methodology Earthworms were sampled 0, 1 and 7 days after feeding. We determined the overall composition of the earthworm-associated microbiota by 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing. Based on the 16S rRNA gene data we constructed quantitative PCR's (Q-PCR) for the seven most dominating bacterial groups. Principal Findings Q-PCR revealed low density and highly variable microbiota among the earthworms before feeding, while a high-density homologous microbiota resulted from feeding. We found that the microbiota 1 day after feeding was more equal to the microbiota after 7 days than before feeding. Furthermore, we found that the gut microbiota was very distinct from that of the bedding and the feed. Significance The homogenous population response represents fundamental new knowledge about earthworm gut associated bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1990493481,"The recurrence of influenza A epidemics has originally been explained by a ""continuous antigenic drift"" scenario. Recently, it has been shown that if genetic drift is gradual, the evolution of influenza A main antigen, the haemagglutinin, is punctuated. As a consequence, it has been suggested that influenza A dynamics at the population level should be approximated by a serial model. Here, simple models are used to test whether a serial model requires gradual antigenic drift within groups of strains with the same antigenic properties (antigenic clusters). We compare the effect of status based and history based frameworks and the influence of reduced susceptibility and infectivity assumptions on the transient dynamics of antigenic clusters. Our results reveal that the replacement of a resident antigenic cluster by a mutant cluster, as observed in data, is reproduced only by the status based model integrating the reduced infectivity assumption. This combination of assumptions is useful to overcome the otherwise extremely high model dimensionality of models incorporating many strains, but relies on a biological hypothesis not obviously satisfied. Our findings finally suggest the dynamical importance of gradual antigenic drift even in the presence of punctuated immune escape. A more regular renewal of susceptible pool than the one implemented in a serial model should be part of a minimal theory for influenza at the population level."

However, mitochondrial protein synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can initiate with nonformylated Met-tRNAfMet, as demonstrated in yeast mutants in which the nuclear gene encoding mitochondrial methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase (FMT1) has been deleted. The role of formylation of the initiator tRNA is not known, but in vitro formylation increases binding of Met-tRNAfMet to translation initiation factor 2 (IF2). We hypothesize the existence of an accessory factor that assists mitochondrial IF2 (mIF2) in utilizing unformylated Met-tRNAfMet. This accessory factor might be unnecessary when formylated Met-tRNAfMet is present but becomes essential when only the unformylated species are available. Using a synthetic petite genetic screen in yeast, we identified a mutation in the AEP3 gene that caused a synthetic respiratory-defective phenotype together with Δfmt1. The same aep3 mutation also caused a synthetic respiratory defect in cells lacking formylated Met-tRNAfMet due to loss of the MIS1 gene that encodes the mitochondrial C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase. The AEP3 gene encodes a peripheral mitochondrial inner membrane protein that stabilizes mitochondrially encoded ATP6/8 mRNA.

The antibody was created by a genetic fusion of the antigen-binding regions of the microcystin-specific single-chain antibody, 3A8, with constant regions from the murine IgG1kappa, Guy's 13. IgG transgenes were controlled by a leader peptide that targets the transgene products to the secretory pathway and also allows for rhizosecretion. The antibody, extracted from the leaves or rhizosecreted into hydroponic medium by transgenic plants, was shown to have functional binding to MC-LR. Antibody yields in transgenic plant leaves reached a maximum of 64 microg/g leaf fresh weight (0.6% total soluble protein), and the rate of antibody rhizosecretion reached a maximum of 5 microg/g root dry weight/24 h. Rhizosecreted antibody bound to MC-LR in hydroponic medium, and transgenic plants grew more efficiently on medium containing MC-LR compared to wild-type controls. This proof of concept paves the way for applications to produce diagnostic antibodies to microcystin-LR, remove it from the environment by phytoremediation, or enhance yields in crops exposed to MC-LR.-Drake, P.

In an in vitro motility assay, both modifications significantly decreased the gliding velocity on myosin II-heavy meromyosin due to a weaker generated force but increased it on myosin V. On the other hand, single molecules of myosin V “walked” with the same velocity on both the wild-type and modified actins; however, the run lengths decreased sharply, correlating with a lower affinity of myosin for actin due to the D-loop modifications. The difference between the single-molecule and the ensemble measurements with myosin V indicates that in an in vitro motility assay the non-coordinated multiple myosin V molecules impose internal friction on each other via binding to the same actin filament, which is reduced by the weaker binding to the modified actins. These results show that the D-loop strongly modulates the force generation by myosin II and the processivity of myosin V, presumably affecting actin-myosin interaction in the actomyosin-ADP·Pi state of both myosins.

This study examined the roles of ATP binding and its hydrolysis in the regulation of the S. aureus DnaA activity. In vitro, S. aureus DnaA melted S. aureus oriC in the presence of ATP but not ADP by a mechanism independent of ATP hydrolysis. Unlike E. coli DnaA, binding of ADP to S. aureus DnaA was unstable. As a result, at physiological concentrations of ATP, ADP bound to S. aureus DnaA was rapidly exchanged for ATP, thereby regenerating the ability of DnaA to form the open complex in vitro. Therefore, we examined whether formation of ADP-DnaA participates in suppression of replication initiation in vivo. Induction of the R318H mutant of the AAA+ sensor 2 protein, which has decreased intrinsic ATPase activity, caused over-initiation of chromosome replication in S. aureus, suggesting that formation of ADP-DnaA suppresses the initiation step in S. aureus.

The initiation step of chromosome replication is an important set point for coordinating cell growth and chromosomal replication, and it is tightly regulated so that it takes place only once per cell cycle. DNA replication in bacteria starts when the cell mass reaches an appropriate size and at the appropriate time, which is controlled in part by the quantity and activity of initiator DnaA protein (1.Skarstad K.

In Escherichia coli, DnaA binds to 9-mer DnaA boxes in oriC, the origin of chromosome replication, and melts the duplex at AT-rich 13-mers adjacent to oriC. DnaA then directs loading of the DnaB replicative helicase, which depends on the DnaC helicase loader and priming by the DnaG primase. This is followed by the synthesis of DNA by the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (4.Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. Second Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992Google Scholar). DnaA is composed of four domains: N-terminal domains I and II are involved in DnaA oligomerization and DnaA-DnaB interaction, and they show a diversity of sequence among bacteria. Domain III contains AAA+ motifs, and the C-terminal domain IV mediates DNA binding (3.Messer W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 355-374PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Kaguni J.M. Annu. Rev.

Instead, these Gram-positive bacteria contain YabA, which negatively regulates the initiation step of DNA replication by binding to DnaA and DnaN (41.Noirot-Gros M.F. Dervyn E. Wu L.J. Mervelet P.

Steindorf A. Noirot P. Graumann P.L. Dev. Cell. 2008; 15: 935-941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although DnaA is widely conserved in prokaryotes and is essential in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, DnaA of B. subtilis and S. aureus is not interchangeable with E. coli DnaA (3.Messer W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 355-374PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Murai N. Kurokawa K. Ichihashi N. Matsuo M. Sekimizu K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2006; 254: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Therefore, DnaA differs in its function to control the replication initiation in each bacterium, but DnaA must function as an initiator in both. However, there is little information on how DnaA is regulated in bacteria other than E. coli. The present study showed that ADP dissociates much faster from purified S. aureus DnaA than from E. coli DnaA, so that ADP-bound S. aureus DnaA was rapidly converted to the ATP-bound form in vitro. This raises a question whether DnaA is really inactivated by ADP binding in S. aureus. To explore this question further, we examined the similarities and differences in initiation control of chromosome replication by S. aureus DnaA. In vitro, S. aureus DnaA mediated open complex formation at oriC in an ATP-dependent manner, although hydrolysis of ATP was not required. In S. aureus cells, induced expression of an S. aureus DnaA R318H mutant protein, which has greatly reduced intrinsic ATPase activity, caused excessive initiation. These results suggest that, as in E. coli, ADP-DnaA negatively regulates the initiation step of chromosome replication and DnaA concentration alone is not the only factor determining the timing of the initiation in S. aureus. The results also imply that S. aureus possesses a system for maintaining the ADP-bound form of DnaA. E. coli and S. aureus cells were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (1% Tryptone (Difco), 0.5% yeast extract (Difco), and 1% NaCl) with 25 μg/ml thymine, 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 25 μg/ml kanamycin, 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol, or 10 μg/ml erythromycin as required. S. aureus strains RN4220, NI8 (thyA19::pSF151kan as RN4220), and NM1003 (Ω[sa0009-sa0010::pMutinT3erm] as NI8) were described previously (44.Murai N. Kurokawa K. Ichihashi N. Matsuo M. Sekimizu K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2006; 254: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). E. coli strain KA450 (ΔoriC1071::Tn10, dnaA17(Am), rnhA199(Am)) or KP7364 (ΔdnaA::spec rnhA::kan) was used for construction of oriC plasmids or plasmids containing DnaA from S. aureus, B. subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and E. coli. E. coli JM109 (recA1) was used as a host during construction of other plasmids and to prepare a monomer form of pCK206 (oriC) DNA. The shuttle vectors between E. coli and S. aureus were pND50 (45.Yamagishi J. Kojima T. Oyamada Y. Fujimoto K. Hattori H. Nakamura S. Inoue M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 1157-1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pKE515 (37.Li Y. Kurokawa K. Matsuo M. Fukuhara N. Murakami K. Sekimizu K. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2004; 271: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and their derivatives. To construct the pCK206 oriC plasmid, the dnaA-coding region with the proximal upstream and downstream region (3.5 kbp), which included rnpA, rpmH, dnaA, and the 5′-region of dnaN, was amplified by PCR with primers 5′-GGAATTCCCCCTACCCTATCCTTACTTAATCTT-3′ and 5′-TTGTATAAGCCAGTTCACACCAGTTA-3′ and using an RN4220 genomic DNA as a template. The amplified fragment was cloned into the SmaI site of the E. coli pUC-derived plasmid pCK20 (46.Ichihashi N. Kurokawa K. Matsuo M. Kaito C. Sekimizu K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28778-28786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The plasmid obtained was digested with EcoRV and PstI, blunt-ended, and self-ligated to truncate dnaA and delete its upstream region. The resulting plasmid was named pCK206, and it contained the 3′-region of dnaA to the 5′-region of dnaN as oriC. A wild-type S. aureus DnaA-overproducing plasmid, pBAD-dnaA, was generated as follows. The coding region of the S. aureus dnaA gene (1.4 kbp) was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-GGGAATTCACCATGTCGGAAAAAGAAATTTGGG-3′ (EcoRI site underlined) and 5′-GGCTGCAGTTATACATTTCTTATTTCTTTTTC-3′ (PstI site underlined) and pHYdnaA (44.Murai N. Kurokawa K. Ichihashi N. Matsuo M. Sekimizu K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2006; 254: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) as a template. The resulting fragment was subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega), excised with EcoRI and PstI, and cloned into the EcoRI and PstI site of pBAD24, which contains the arabinose promoter and operator (47.Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3939) Google Scholar), resulting in pBAD-dnaA. To construct pBAD-R318H, the entire region of pBAD-dnaA was amplified by PCR with primers 5′-CATGAATTAGAAGGTGCATTAACACG-3′ and 5′-AATATTAGATTGAATTTGATTTGC-3′ (altered nucleotide underlined), which introduces an Arg to His substitution at residue 318 of S. aureus DnaA. After self-ligation, the resulting plasmid was introduced into and amplified in E. coli strain KA450, resulting in pBAD-R318H. Sequence analysis confirmed that the open reading frame (ORF) of DnaA in this plasmid lacked secondary mutations. The DNA region (0.8 kbp) from pWH353 (48.Geissendörfer M. Hillen W. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1990; 33: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), which includes the tetR gene and a synthetic xyl-tet promoter-operator fusion, was amplified by PCR using primers 5′- GCCCAAGCTTTAAAATCGATAACTCGACAT-3′ and 5′-AGATCTGATATCAAGCTTATTTTAA-3′ (HindIII sites underlined). The amplified DNA fragment was digested with HindIII and ligated into HindIII-digested pND50, resulting in pNDX1. Next, the DNA fragment, including the S. aureus dnaA ORF along with the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (1.5 kbp), was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-CCGGAATTCGTGTATAACTTAAAAATTTAA-3′ (EcoRI site underlined) and 5′- GCCGGATCCAAAGTTTCCTACTTATACATT-3′ (BamHI site underlined). The amplified DNA fragment was ligated into SmaI site of the pNDX1, resulting in pNDX1-dnaA. Although pNDX1-dnaA contained a single tet regulatory element, we replaced it with double tet operators derived from pWH354, which enabled tighter repression (48.Geissendörfer M. Hillen W. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1990; 33: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The synthetic xyl-tet-tet promoter-operator-operator region of pWH354 was excised with XhoI and PstI and then cloned into the XhoI and PstI site of pNDX1-dnaA. The resulting plasmid, pNDX2-dnaA, was used for Atc-inducible expression of DnaA in S. aureus. To construct pNDX2-R318H, the EcoRV fragment (0.4 kbp) of pBAD-R318H, which includes the internal DnaA protein region carrying the R318H mutation, was inserted into EcoRV-digested pNDX2-dnaA. The pNDX2 vector was prepared from pNDX2-dnaA by EcoRI digestion followed by self-ligation, which removed the cloned dnaA region. The multicopy dnaN plasmid, pSE-dnaN, was constructed as follows. The DNA region, including the S. aureus dnaN ORF along with the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (1.2 kbp), was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-AAGGTACCTATATAATTATATATAAACGACT-3′ (KpnI site underlined) and 5′-GTGCGGCCGCAATACTGTCATTTTCAATTTTT-3′ (NotI site underlined) and chromosomal DNA from S. aureus strain RN4220 as a template. The amplified product was digested with KpnI and NotI and then cloned into the KpnI and NotI sites of pSRP21, resulting in pSRP-dnaN. The pSRP21 plasmid was a pKE515-derived plasmid carrying the upstream region of the S. aureus hisS gene (0.3 kbp; amplified with primers 5′-GCCTCTAGAACATTGAACACAAGAAGAGGT-3′ and 5′-GCCGAATTCTCGGCAAACTATTTTATTTAA-3′) inserted into the SmaI site. Plasmid pSRP-dnaN was digested with BamHI and NotI, and then a 1.6-kbp fragment containing the hisS upstream region and the dnaN-coding region was cloned into BamHI/NotI-digested pKE516, resulting in pSE-dnaN. Plasmid pKE516 was a derivative of pKE515, wherein the chloramphenicol resistance gene of pKE515 was replaced with the erythromycin resistance gene. 7M. Matsuo, K. Kurokawa, and K. Sekimizu, unpublished observations. S. aureus DnaA was purified as described previously (46.Ichihashi N. Kurokawa K. Matsuo M. Kaito C. Sekimizu K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28778-28786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, lysates from E. coli strain KA450 harboring pBAD-dnaA were prepared and purified by Mono S column chromatography as described previously (46.Ichihashi N. Kurokawa K. Matsuo M. Kaito C. Sekimizu K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28778-28786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). DnaA-containing fractions were identified by ATP binding, pooled, diluted with an equal volume of buffer D (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 20% glycerol, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 0.2 m potassium sulfate) containing 7 m guanidine hydrochloride and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a Superose 12 10/30 fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer D, and DnaA protein was eluted with buffer D. Fractions showing ATP binding were pooled and used as purified S. aureus DnaA. S. aureus DnaAR318H protein was purified form E. coli KA450 harboring pBAD-R318H in the same way. In both cases, SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 revealed a single band (see Fig. 3A). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. B. subtilis DnaA protein ORF was amplified with PCR using primers 5′-ACGTGCCGGACCATGGAAAATA-3′ (NcoI site underlined) 5′-CCCCCATGGATCCCCGGTCCTGCTATT-3′ (NcoI site underlined) and B. subtilis 168 genomic DNA as a template and cloned into the NcoI site of pBAD24 (41.Noirot-Gros M.F. Dervyn E. Wu L.J. Mervelet P. Errington J. Ehrlich S.D. Noirot P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 8342-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pBAD-BdnaA, was introduced into an E. coli strain KP7364, which lacks the E. coli dnaA gene (11.Ozaki S. Kawakami H. Nakamura K. Fujikawa N. Kagawa W. Park S.Y. Yokoyama S. Kurumizaka H. Katayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8351-8362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). S. pyogenes DnaA protein ORF was amplified with PCR using primers 5′-TCCACAAGAAGGAATTCAGTATGACTGAA-3′ (EcoRI site underlined) 5′-ACGAGAGAATTCAAGACTAAATGG-3′ (EcoRI site underlined) and S. pyogenes SSI-9 genomic DNA as a template and cloned into the EcoRI site of pBAD24. The resulting plasmid, pBAD-SpydnaA, was introduced into an E. coli strain KA450. Induction of B. subtilis DnaA and S. pyogenes DnaA proteins was carried out at 16 °C, and purifications of these proteins was followed by the procedure for S. aureus DnaA as descried above. DNA sequences of dnaA ORFs in overexpressing plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. S. aureus HU protein consists of a homodimer. The S. aureus HU protein ORF was amplified with PCR using primers 5′-AGGAGGTGAATGTCTCATGAACAAA-3′ (BspHI site underlined) 5′-TTTTGAAAGCTTAAACAATGAATGTTCC-3′ (HindIII site underlined) and cloned into the NcoI and HindIII sites of pBAD24. The resulting plasmid, pBAD-HU, was introduced into E. coli strain RI-07, which lacks the hupA and hupB genes (49.Ogata Y. Inoue R. Mizushima T. Kano Y. Miki T. Sekimizu K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1353: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). RI-07 harboring pBAD-HU was cultured in 1 liter of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.2, after which the culture was adjusted to 0.2% (w/v) l-(+)arabinose. After a 2-h induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 0.9% NaCl, suspended in 1 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and 50 mm NaCl) per milliliter of wet cell weight, and frozen in liquid N2. The frozen cell paste was thawed on ice and adjusted to 0.4 mg/ml lysozyme and 30 mm spermidine. After 30-min incubation on ice for cell lysis, samples were again frozen, thawed on ice, and then sonicated four times for 10 s using a Branson Sonifier 450 with an ultramicrotip at an output setting of 3. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 35 krpm for 30 min at 4 °C using a Beckman 80Ti rotor, and the cleared lysates obtained were loaded onto a DNA-cellulose column pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was then washed, and proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 50 mm to 2 m NaCl in buffer A. The presence of HU protein was determined by SDS-PAGE, and a fraction of peak, which represented a single band stained with Coomassie Blue, was used as purified HU protein. The purified HU protein also had the ability to cause constrained supercoiling of pUC119 form I DNA in the presence of calf thymus DNA topoisomerase I (50.Broyles S.S. Pettijohn D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method using BSA as a standard. Proteins were stored at −80 °C. A filter binding assay was used to measure ATP binding by DnaA as described previously (46.Ichihashi N. Kurokawa K. Matsuo M. Kaito C. Sekimizu K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28778-28786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), except that the magnesium concentration was increased to 10 mm. The same conditions were applied for all DnaA proteins form S. aureus, B. subtilis, S. pyogenes, and E. coli. Typical reactions were performed on ice in a 50-μl solution of 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml BSA, 10% sucrose, 1 μm [α-32P]ATP (40,000 cpm/pmol), or [3H]ADP (11,400 cpm/pmol), and purified S. aureus DnaA proteins (50–250 ng). DTT was added just before initiating the reaction. Kd values were determined by incubating 5 pmol of purified S. aureus DnaA proteins for 3 h on ice with ATP or ADP and in a volume of 0.5 ml or 5 ml, respectively. ATP and ADP binding in dissociation and exchange reactions were also detected by the filter binding assay. DnaA protein (20 pmol) was preincubated on ice for 30 min with pCK206 (100 ng) and 1 μm [α-32P]ATP (40,000 cpm/pmol) in 20 μl of a reaction buffer containing 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm potassium glutamate, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml BSA, and 10% sucrose and then incubated at 37 °C. A portion (2 μl) of samples was placed on ice to stop the reaction, after which 1 μl was spotted onto a silica-gel TLC plate. The plate was developed with 1 m formic acid containing 0.6 m lithium chloride and then exposed to a BAS MS2025 imaging plate (Fuji). The plates were analyzed with a BAS-1800II bioimaging analyzer (Fuji). S. aureus DnaA was preincubated at 37 °C for 20 min in a reaction buffer (10 μl) containing 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml BSA, 10% sucrose, and 5 mm ATP or ADP. In another tube, pCK206 oriC DNA (100 fmol) was also preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min in the same reaction buffer (40 μl) containing 100 ng of S. aureus HU protein. Next, DnaA was added to the pCK206 DNA, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 10 min at 37 °C. P1 nuclease (Roche Applied Science, 0.3 unit; or MP Biochemicals, 10 units) was then added, and the mixture was incubated for 25 s at 37 °C. The nuclease reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of SDS-EDTA (0.2% SDS and 40 mm EDTA), and the proteins were removed by phenol/chloroform extraction. DNA in the samples was recovered by ethanol precipitation, separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and stained with ethidium bromide. To estimate the level of DnaA induction in vivo, S. aureus NM1003 cells harboring an empty pNDX2 vector, pNDX2-dnaA, or pNDX2-R318H were grown at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.1. The cells were then treated for 1 h with 0, 1, or 10 ng/ml Atc. Proteins were extracted from the cells, determined by the Lowry method with BSA as a standard, and then analyzed by Western blotting for S. aureus DnaA as described previously (44.Murai N.

https://openalex.org/W2084186563,"A recent scan of the human genome (1) identified approximately 11 million hairpins. Some have been linked to known sequences, such as viruses, transposable elements, and, more recently, regulating or microRNAs, but the significance, if any, of most sequences that can be predicted to form hairpins remains unknown. Here we show that hairpins that are cleaved by RNase III- like nucleases can induce termination, even with normally polyadenylated transcripts, and that a cleaved hairpin downstream of a normal termination signal can induce fail-safe termination. Because such cleavage sites appear common to intergenic regions, the results raise the possibility that similar fail-safe termination elements are widely distributed in the eukaryotic genome to prevent read-through transcription from disrupting downstream promoter elements or opposing transcription.-Nabavi, S., Nazar, R. N. Fail-safe termination elements: a common feature of the eukaryotic genome?"
