https://openalex.org/W2059533740,"A regional pigment retrieval algorithm for the Nimbus-7 Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) has been tested for the Southern Ocean. The pigment concentrations estimated with this algorithm agree to within 5 percent with in situ values and are more than twice as high as those previously reported. The CZCS data also revealed an asymmetric distribution of enhanced pigments in the waters surrounding Antarctica; in contrast, most surface geophysical properties are symmetrically distributed. The asymmetry is coherent with circumpolar current patterns and the availability of silicic acid in surface waters. Intense blooms (>1 milligram of pigment per cubic meter) that occur downcurrent from continental masses result from dissolved trace elements such as iron derived from shelf sediments and glacial melt."
https://openalex.org/W2031426773,The transition state region of the F + H(2) reaction has been studied by photoelectron spectroscopy of FH(2)(-). New para and normal FH(2)(-)photoelectron spectra have been measured in refined experiments and are compared here with exact three-dimensional quantum reactive scattering simulations that use an accurate new ab initio potential energy surface for F + H(2). The detailed agreement that is obtained between this fully ab initio theory and experiment is unprecedented for the F + H(2) reaction and suggests that the transition state region of the F + H(2) potential energy surface has finally been understood quantitatively.
https://openalex.org/W2092947447,"The global budget of N(2)O shows a significant imbalance between the known rate of destruction in the stratosphere and the estimated rates of natural and anthropogenic production in soils and the ocean. Measurements of the (15)N/(14)N and (18)O/(16)O ratios in two major tropospheric sources of N(2)O, tropical rain forest soils and fertilized soils, show that soil N(2)O from a tropical rain forest in Costa Rica and from sugar-cane fields in Maui is strongly depleted in both (15)N and (18)O relative to mean tropospheric N(2)O. A major source of heavy N(2)O, enriched in both (15)N and (18)O, must therefore be present to balance the light N(2)O from soils. One such source is the back-mixing flux of N(2)O from the stratosphere, which is enriched in (15)N and (18)O by photolysis and chemistry. However these return fluxes of (15)N and (18)O are so great that a large oceanic flux of N(2)O is required to balance the heavy isotope-enriched stratospheric flux. All these effects will be reflected in climatically related isotopic variations in trapped N(2)O in polar ice cores."

The sense of change of the partition coefficients with temperature resembles the extrapolation of Murthy and may partially contribute to, but by no means provide a complete resolution of, the ""excess"" siderophile problem in the Earth's mantle. Sulfur and perhaps carbon successfully compete with oxygen for sites in the metallic liquid at these temperatures and pressures. This observation casts doubt upon the hypothesis that oxygen is the light element in the Earth's core."
https://openalex.org/W2061234725,"An artificial cuprate compound belonging to the BiSrCaCuO family with eight adjacent sequetially imposed layer epitaxy. This compound undergoes a five order of magnitude resistivity drop with an onset near 280 kelvin and an offset at 250 kelvin. It exhibits a diamagnetic variation of susceptibility and magnetization below 290 kelvin. Additional observed features, such as strongly nonlinear conductivity, suggests superconductivity as a plausible explanation of the properties of this compound."
https://openalex.org/W2041391482,"We have built an activity-recording device based on the principle of detecting slight changes in the heat conductance of an aquatic environment by means of a thermistor. A major advantage of the device is that it can be used with a simple event recorder, thus combining high sensitivity with low cost. The equipment has been tested with automatic mechanical stimulation, and has been used for long-term recording of the swimming of small marine crustaceans. Problems of stability and reliability have been solved, and potential applications of the device seem widespread."

The process is presumed to be biochemical. No evidence of the reaction was found in the water of the Peru current, which is low in oxygen but high in nitrite."
https://openalex.org/W2003653295,"The 87Sr/86Sr ratios in some bulk abyssal and alpine peridotites are too high to be binary mixtures of depleted mantle and seawater components. The apparent excess, or ""orphan,"" 87Sr appears to be separated from its radioactive parent. Such observations were widely held to be analytical artifacts. Study of several occurrences of orphan 87Sr shows that the orphan component in abyssal peridotite is located in the alteration products of olivine and enstatite in the peridotite. The orphan 87Sr is most likely introduced by infiltration of low-temperature (<200°C) seawater bearing suspended detrital particulates. These particulates include grains of detrital clay that are partly derived from continental (that is, granitic) sources and thus are highly radiogenic. Orphan 87Sr and other radiogenic isotopes may provide a tracer for low-temperature seawater penetrating into the oceanic crust."

Shattuckite contains silicate chains similar to pyroxene in a complex association with copper atoms, while the closely related planchéite contains silicate chains similar to amphibole."
https://openalex.org/W2029854666,"The Interuniversity Communications Council has been formed to provide collaboration among institutions of higher learning in their efforts to utilize the emerging communication sciences. Given a W. K. Kellogg Foundation grant for administration, eight charter members announced the nonprofit organization in June 1965. There now are 50 institutional members, representing 167 separate campuses. Interuniversity task forces have been assigned to the study of computerized regional and national educational information processing networks, educational systems and technology, computer-based systems for clinical activities, the copyright problems inherent in the new media, the use of the new information technologies in continuing education, and the use of computers in academic management. Other task forces will also be established. All information-processing activities in higher education are of concern to EDUCOM, including computational use of computers, computerized programmed instruction, library automation, educational radio and television, computerized cognitive aids, and the use of computers in clinical operations and university administration. Its primary purposes are to organize interuniversity cooperation in these fields, to disseminate reports on the state of educational information technologies, to investigate areas of critical development, and to facilitate useful applications."

https://openalex.org/W1978392909,"Social scientists and a growing num ber of people in Congress and the Ad ministration are beginning to give hard thought to the place of the social sci ences in the scheme of social science government relations. Thus far there seems to be no consensus as to what new institutional arrangements should be created, but the feeling is strong that something should be done. The catalog of problems which intrude upon rela tions between the social scientists and government is still being compiled. Problems which must appear obvious to many social scientists, however, are those having to do with money, pro fessional independence, and influence and visibility. The mounting interest of members of Congress in the social sciences is undoubtedly a reflection of the in creasing seriousness of such problems as the upheavals in the Negro ghettos, the overwhelming demands on big-city school systems, and the near-chaos in public transportation. The rapid growth of federal support for the social sci ences, and of the involvement of social scientists in the work of government, is evident from NSF figures showing that the total federal contribution to research in these fields increased from $35 million in fiscal 1960 to $188 mil lion in fiscal 1966.** Nothing has done more to alert social scientists and government to the problems inherent in their deepening involvement with one another than the Camelot incident. Project Camelot, the long-since canceled U.S. Army sponsored study of political instability"

Although well-funded, scientifically challenging, and important to both civilian energy and weapons research, the ICF program has suffered the stultifying effects of its classified status: rare publications in the open literature, few university collaborations, no graduate students, and no shop-talk at meetings."

https://openalex.org/W4233930148,"The ScienceScope item ""NIH shakeup continues"" (29 Oct., p. 643) incorrectly described the position of Francis Collins, director of the National Center for Human Genome Research, on the National Institutes of Health's (NIH's) decision 2 years ago to file for patents on gene fragments of unknown function. Collins does not believe it was appropriate for NIH to file for the patents in the first place, but since the applications have been filed, he now believes they should be pursued to a conclusion in order to clarify whether such gene fragments are patentable."
