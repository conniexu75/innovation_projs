It is not known whether adult-born OLs ensheath previously unmyelinated axons or remodel existing myelin. We quantified OP division and OL production in different regions of the adult mouse CNS including the 4-month-old optic nerve, in which practically all axons are already myelinated. Even there, all OPs were dividing and generating new OLs and myelin at a rate higher than can be explained by first-time myelination of naked axons. We conclude that adult-born OLs in the optic nerve are engaged in myelin remodeling, either replacing OLs that die in service or intercalating among existing myelin sheaths. The latter would predict that average internode length should decrease with age. Consistent with that, we found that adult-born OLs elaborated much shorter but many more internodes than OLs generated during early postnatal life."

To assess the cell-autonomous and species-selective properties of human glia, we engrafted human glial progenitor cells (GPCs) into neonatal immunodeficient mice. Upon maturation, the recipient brains exhibited large numbers and high proportions of both human glial progenitors and astrocytes. The engrafted human glia were gap-junction-coupled to host astroglia, yet retained the size and pleomorphism of hominid astroglia, and propagated Ca2+ signals 3-fold faster than their hosts. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was sharply enhanced in the human glial chimeric mice, as was their learning, as assessed by Barnes maze navigation, object-location memory, and both contextual and tone fear conditioning. Mice allografted with murine GPCs showed no enhancement of either LTP or learning. These findings indicate that human glia differentially enhance both activity-dependent plasticity and learning in mice."

To better understand the link between mutant LRRK2 and PD pathology, we derived induced pluripotent stem cells from PD patients harboring LRRK2 G2019S and then specifically corrected the mutant LRRK2 allele. We demonstrate that gene correction resulted in phenotypic rescue in differentiated neurons and uncovered expression changes associated with LRRK2 G2019S. We found that LRRK2 G2019S induced dysregulation of CPNE8, MAP7, UHRF2, ANXA1, and CADPS2. Knockdown experiments demonstrated that four of these genes contribute to dopaminergic neurodegeneration. LRRK2 G2019S induced increased extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK) phosphorylation. Transcriptional dysregulation of CADPS2, CPNE8, and UHRF2 was dependent on ERK activity. We show that multiple PD-associated phenotypes were ameliorated by inhibition of ERK. Therefore, our results provide mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis induced by mutant LRRK2 and pointers for the development of potential new therapeutics.

Parkinson’s disease Fact Sheet. http://www.europeanbraincouncil.org/pdfs/Documents/Parkinson%27s%20fact%20sheet%20July%202011.pdf.Google Scholar). Although most cases of PD are sporadic, about 5%–10% of patients have familial PD (fPD) following an autosomal-recessive or -dominant inheritance pattern (Schiesling et al., 2008Schiesling C. Kieper N. Seidel K. Krüger R. Review: Familial Parkinson’s disease—genetics, clinical phenotype and neuropathology in relation to the common sporadic form of the disease.Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 2008; 34: 255-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These two inheritance forms appear to have different pathologies (Schiesling et al., 2008Schiesling C. Kieper N. Seidel K. Krüger R. Review: Familial Parkinson’s disease—genetics, clinical phenotype and neuropathology in relation to the common sporadic form of the disease.Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 2008; 34: 255-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Unlike patients with autosomal-recessive fPD, patients with autosomal-dominant fPD typically show extensive formation of Lewy bodies in different parts of the brain. Alpha-synuclein (αSYN), the protein encoded by the gene SNCA, is the major component of Lewy bodies, indicating that αSYN plays a central role in the pathogenesis of PD (Spillantini et al., 1997Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Alpha-synuclein in Lewy bodies.Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (6163) Google Scholar). SNCA was the first gene identified as being mutated in patients with fPD (Polymeropoulos et al., 1997Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Dutra A. Pike B. Root H. Rubenstein J. Boyer R. et al.Mutation in the alpha-synuclein gene identified in families with Parkinson’s disease.Science. 1997; 276: 2045-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (6651) Google Scholar). In 2004, two research groups simultaneously discovered mutations in the Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene in patients with fPD (Paisán-Ruíz et al., 2004Paisán-Ruíz C. Jain S. Evans E.W.

Like SNCA mutations, LRRK2 mutations result in autosomal-dominant fPD. Mutations in LRRK2 have been found in about 2% of patients with sporadic PD (Berg et al., 2005Berg D. Schweitzer K.J. Leitner P. Zimprich A. Lichtner P. Belcredi P. Brüssel T. Schulte C. Maass S. Nägele T. et al.Type and frequency of mutations in the LRRK2 gene in familial and sporadic Parkinson’s disease∗.Brain. 2005; 128: 3000-3011PubMed Google Scholar), with much higher prevalence rates in some populations, e.g., Ashkenazi Jews (Ozelius et al., 2006Ozelius L.J. Senthil G. Saunders-Pullman R. Ohmann E. Deligtisch A. Tagliati M. Hunt A.L. Klein C. Henick B. Hailpern S.M. et al.LRRK2 G2019S as a cause of Parkinson’s disease in Ashkenazi Jews.N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 354: 424-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Patients with PD with LRRK2 mutations most often exhibit Lewy body pathology, and experiments in the mouse model have suggested a link between LRRK2 and SNCA (Lin et al., 2009Lin X. Parisiadou L. Gu X.L. Wang L. Shim H. Sun L. Xie C. Long C.X. Yang W.J.

Neurol. 2006; 59: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). G2019S is the most common mutation of LRRK2, and mutations in LRRK2, including G2019S, have been suggested to lead to increased expression of SNCA (Carballo-Carbajal et al., 2010Carballo-Carbajal I. Weber-Endress S. Rovelli G. Chan D. Wolozin B. Klein C.L. Patenge N. Gasser T. Kahle P.J.

Langston W. et al.LRRK2 mutant iPSC-derived DA neurons demonstrate increased susceptibility to oxidative stress.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 267-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Therefore, LRRK2 mutations are thought to confer susceptibility to PD through SNCA (Cookson, 2010Cookson M.R. The role of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) in Parkinson’s disease.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that although most patients with PD harboring LRRK2 mutations manifest alpha-synucleinopathy, patients with nigral degeneration without αSYN aggregation have been reported (Cookson et al., 2008Cookson M.R. Hardy J. Lewis P.A. Genetic neuropathology of Parkinson’s disease.Int. J. Clin. Exp. Pathol. 2008; 1: 217-231PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest a role for TAU in PD pathology. Genome-wide association studies have demonstrated that polymorphisms at the Microtubule-associated protein TAU (MAPT) locus, which encodes TAU, are associated with PD. In addition, it has been shown that the MAPT haplotype influences age at onset in LRRK2 mutation carriers (Golub et al., 2009Golub Y. Berg D. Calne D.B. Pfeiffer R.F. Uitti R.J. Stoessl A.J. Wszolek Z.K. Farrer M.J. Mueller J.C. Gasser T. Fuchs J. Genetic factors influencing age at onset in LRRK2-linked Parkinson disease.Parkinsonism Relat. Disord. 2009; 15: 539-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and there has been at least one documented case of a LRRK2 G2019S carrier having TAU pathology (Rajput et al., 2006Rajput A. Dickson D.W. Robinson C.A. Ross O.A. Dächsel J.C. Lincoln S.J. Cobb S.A. Rajput M.L. Farrer M.J. Parkinsonism, Lrrk2 G2019S, and tau neuropathology.Neurology. 2006; 67: 1506-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been suggested that TAU may colocalize with αSYN in a subset of Lewy bodies (Ishizawa et al., 2003Ishizawa T. Mattila P. Davies P. Wang D. Dickson D.W. Colocalization of tau and alpha-synuclein epitopes in Lewy bodies.J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2003; 62: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology offers a unique opportunity to study the mechanism of PD pathogenesis induced by LRRK2 G2019S, which could enable the development of new therapies. In 2006, Shinya Yamanaka demonstrated that expression of four genes in fibroblasts induced the formation of pluripotent stem cells, with the same self-renewal and differentiation potential as embryonic stem cells (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S.

It was reported that differentiated midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons, which are preferentially lost in patients with PD, were more susceptible to oxidative stress and had increased levels of αSYN. Subsequently, Sánchez-Danés et al., 2012Sánchez-Danés A. Richaud-Patin Y. Carballo-Carbajal I. Jiménez-Delgado S. Caig C. Mora S. Di Guglielmo C. Ezquerra M. Patel B. Giralt A. et al.Disease-specific phenotypes in dopamine neurons from human iPS-based models of genetic and sporadic Parkinson’s disease.EMBO Mol. Med. 2012; 4: 380-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar showed increased αSYN and aberrant autophagy in mDA neurons differentiated from iPSC lines of PD patients with and without LRRK2 G2019S. However, PD phenotypes are affected by polymorphisms at multiple loci. For example, patients with LRRK2 mutations will exhibit variable phenotypes when additional polymorphisms are present in either SNCA or MAPT (Botta-Orfila et al., 2012Botta-Orfila T. Ezquerra M. Pastor P. Fernández-Santiago R. Pont-Sunyer C. Compta Y. Lorenzo-Betancor O. Samaranch L. Martí M.J. Valldeoriola F. et al.Age at onset in LRRK2-associated PD is modified by SNCA variants.J. Mol.

Disord. 2009; 15: 539-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As a result, it is unclear whether these observed phenotypes in iPSC-derived neurons were specifically due to LRRK2 G2019S. Because of the large variability in the genetic background between individuals, it is very difficult to detect and study molecular changes resulting from a specific allele such as LRRK2 G2019S. Gene correction of iPSCs from patients with known genetic mutations is a powerful tool for overcoming this limitation of the use of iPSCs. Here, we report mechanistic insights for mDA neurodegeneration induced by LRRK2 G2019S by using cultures of mDA neurons differentiated from isogenic iPSC lines. We show that targeted correction of LRRK2 G2019S ameliorated a deficit in neurite outgrowth and a defect in basal autophagy and increased αSYN, TAU, and susceptibility to oxidative stress. In addition, we demonstrate that targeted insertion of LRRK2 G2019S into iPSCs from a healthy donor was sufficient to recapitulate the disease phenotypes. With isogenic cultures, we were able to detect dysregulation of Copine VIII (CPNE8), Annexin A1 (ANXA1), Microtubule-associated protein 7 (MAP7), Calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion 2 (CADPS2), and Ubiquitin-like with PHD and ring finger domains 2 (UHRF2), which are involved in other neurodegenerative pathologies but have not previously been associated with PD. Pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity corrected these gene expression changes and rescued PD-associated phenotypes. Knockdown experiments demonstrated that dysregulation of four of these genes significantly contributed to mDA neurodegeneration under oxidative stress. Finally, we demonstrate that LRRK2 G2019S was associated with increased activation of ERK and that inhibition of ERK ameliorated mDA neurodegeneration, neurite outgrowth, and the dysregulation of CADPS2, CPNE8, and UHRF2. Therefore, these results reveal molecular details for the pathogenesis of mutant LRRK2 and possible new targets for the development of new therapeutics for patients with PD. We derived iPSCs from two patients harboring the LRRK2 mutation G2019S (Table S1 available online). The samples used in this study were derived from two female patients with PD born in 1958 and 1931 (designated L1 and L2, respectively). As nonisogenic healthy controls, we used iPSC lines derived from four healthy women born in 1959, 1931, 1943, and 1932 (designated C1, C2, C3, and C4, respectively) (Table S1). Dermal fibroblasts from skin punch biopsies of patients with PD or healthy controls were expanded and infected with retroviral expression vectors containing the genes indicated and iPSCs were generated (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from adult human fibroblasts by defined factors.Cell. 2007; 131: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15051) Google Scholar). Individual clonal iPSC lines derived from L1 and L2 were designated L1-1 and L2-1, respectively (Table S1). Multiple assays were used to confirm the reprogramming of fibroblasts into all the iPSC lines used in this study. Immunostaining demonstrated that the iPSC lines expressed the pluripotent markers NANOG, OCT4, SSEA4, and TRA1-81 (Figures 1A and S1A). Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that iPSCs expressed pluripotency markers at levels comparable with human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) (Figures 1B and S1B) and silencing of the retroviral vectors, which is a hallmark of bona fide iPSCs (Figure S1C; Hotta and Ellis, 2008Hotta A. Ellis J. Retroviral vector silencing during iPS cell induction: an epigenetic beacon that signals distinct pluripotent states.J. Cell. Biochem. 2008; 105: 940-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Pluripotent differentiation potential of each iPSC line was tested in vitro via embryoid body (EB)-mediated differentiation and in vivo via teratoma formation (Figures 1C, 1D, S2A, and S2B). Each line was verified to be euploid via microarray profiling of single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Genome-wide association studies have revealed that multiple genetic variants are associated with PD (Simón-Sánchez et al., 2009Simón-Sánchez J. Schulte C. Bras J.M. Sharma M. Gibbs J.R. Berg D. Paisan-Ruiz C. Lichtner P. Scholz S.W. Hernandez D.G. et al.Genome-wide association study reveals genetic risk underlying Parkinson’s disease.Nat. Genet. 2009; 41: 1308-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar). Therefore, given the variable phenotypes associated with specific LRRK2 mutations, it is very likely that variants in other genetic loci modify the phenotype induced by LRRK2 G2019S. To account for this, we gene-corrected iPSC lines from both patients to obtain three isogenic lines per patient that differed only in this mutation. A correction vector was inserted site specifically by cotransfecting it with zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) designed to introduce a double-strand break adjacent to the G2019S mutation of the LRRK2 gene. Because LRRK2 mutations are inherited dominantly, our patients with PD are heterozygous for the G2019S mutation. As such, only half of the targeted cell lines would be expected to target the correct allele. We used DNA sequencing of iPSCs and differentiated neurons to confirm correction of the G2019S mutation (Figures S2C and S2D). As an additional experimental control, the ZFNs were used to introduce the G2019S mutation into one of the LRRK2 loci of the control iPSC line C4, which was derived from a healthy individual. Appropriate expression of the artificially mutated allele was confirmed through quantification by pyro-sequencing with cDNA (Figure S2E). Therefore, through both patient selection and gene targeting, we have a complete set of iPSC lines to study the mechanisms of PD pathogenesis induced by mutant LRRK2 (Table S1). All gene-targeted subclones were fully characterized and confirmed to be euploid and pluripotent in vitro and in vivo (Figures S1 and S2). Because PD is characterized by the degeneration of mDA neurons, we directed the differentiation of iPSCs into this neuronal subtype. After 10 days of differentiation, we observed efficient formation of OTX2 and FOXA2 double-positive cells, which are markers of mDA neural progenitors (Figures S3A and S3B). Additional developmental markers associated with the specification of mDA neurons were detected by qRT-PCR after 13, 30, and 60 days of differentiation, including TH, FOXA2, AADC, MSX1, LMX1A, PITX3, and NURR1 (Figures 1F, S3C, and S3D). Immunostaining demonstrated frequent formation of FOXA2 and TH as well as TH and LRRK2 double-positive cells (Figures 1E and S4). The efficiency of mDA neuron formation was approximately 20% of the total cells and 50% of all neurons after plating them as single cells on day 30 of differentiation (Figure 1G). Cultures of differentiated mDA neurons stained positively for NURR1, which is a marker of mDA neurons, as well as NeuN, MAP2, and SYNAPTOPHYSIN, which are markers of mature neurons (Figures 1E, S5A, and S5B). Analysis of electrophysiology and dopamine release upon chemical stimulation confirmed that the differentiated neurons were functionally mature after 30–35 days of differentiation (Figures 1H, 1I, and S5C–S5G). Next, we sought to determine whether the gene correction of LRRK2 G2019S resulted in functional phenotypic correction. Neurite shortening and sensitivity to neurotoxins are phenotypes associated with LRRK2 G2019S (MacLeod et al., 2006MacLeod D. Dowman J. Hammond R. Leete T. Inoue K. Abeliovich A.

Med. 2012; 4: 380-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). We observed a statistically significant (p < 0.001) reduction in the velocity of outgrowing neurites harboring LRRK2 G2019S compared to wild-type controls (Figures 2A–2C). Targeted gene correction of LRRK2 G2019S rescued this phenotype to a level equal to the wild-type controls (Figures 2A and 2B). Immunostaining showed that about 20% of outgrowing neurites were TH positive, suggesting that this is a general neuronal phenotype and not specific to mDA neurons (Figure 2D). Previously, Sánchez-Danés et al., 2012Sánchez-Danés A. Richaud-Patin Y. Carballo-Carbajal I. Jiménez-Delgado S. Caig C. Mora S. Di Guglielmo C. Ezquerra M. Patel B. Giralt A. et al.Disease-specific phenotypes in dopamine neurons from human iPS-based models of genetic and sporadic Parkinson’s disease.EMBO Mol. Med. 2012; 4: 380-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, reported that LRRK2 G2019S was associated with aberrant autophagy in neurons differentiated from iPSCs. Consistent with this report, we found that basal autophagy was significantly reduced by about 20% (Figures S6A and S6B) and increased numbers of autophagosomes were observed in cultures harboring LRRK2 G2019S (Figures S6C). Similarly, cultures of differentiated mDA neurons were significantly more sensitive to oxidative stress when cultured in N2 medium without the supplement B27 (Figures 3 and 4A), which contains antioxidant proteins such as Catalase and Superoxide Dismutase (Brewer et al., 1993Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. Optimized survival of hippocampal neurons in B27-supplemented Neurobasal, a new serum-free medium combination.J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1907) Google Scholar). Addition of the neurotoxins rotenone or 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) resulted in a small increase in the number of TH and cleaved CASPASE3 double-positive cells in differentiated cultures harboring LRRK2 G2019S compared to gene-corrected isogenic controls (Figures 3, 4A, 4B, S6D, and S6E). Immunostaining showed that more than 80% of the cells positive for cleaved CASPASE3 also expressed TH (Figure 4C). To further assess the specificity of neurodegeneration, we differentiated iPSCs into peripheral sensory neurons (Greber et al., 2011Greber B. Coulon P. Zhang M. Moritz S. Frank S. Müller-Molina A.J. Araúzo-Bravo M.J. Han D.W. Pape H.C. Schöler H.R. FGF signalling inhibits neural induction in human embryonic stem cells.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 4874-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), cultured them under conditions of oxidative stress, and immunostained for cleaved CASPASE3 and BRN3A, which mark apoptotic sensory neurons. Compared to mDA neurons, fewer sensory neurons were positive for cleaved CASPASE3, and there was no increase associated with LRRK2 G2019S (Figure S6F). These results demonstrate that apoptosis was preferentially induced in mDA neurons. In another experiment, we tested whether LRRK2 G2019S is sufficient to increase sensitivity of mDA neurons to B27 withdrawal and to 6-OHDA- and rotenone-induced toxicity. To do this, we repeated the above assays with neurons derived from the iPSC lines C4 and C4+G2019S, in which we had inserted the G2019S mutation into the LRRK2 locus of an iPSC line derived from a healthy control. The increase in cytotoxicity was comparable in magnitude with the decrease in cytotoxicity observed after gene correction for mutant LRRK2 iPSC lines (Figures 3A and 4A). We conclude that mutant LRRK2 is sufficient to induce increased sensitivity of human mDA neurons to oxidative stress.Figure 4Gene Correction of LRRK2 G2019S Ameliorates Sensitivity of Human mDA Neurons to RotenoneShow full caption(A) Relative frequency of cleaved CASPASE3 and TH double-positive cells after treating the mDA neurons of the indicated lines with the indicated concentration of rotenone in N2 medium (n = 2).

Data are normalized to the LRRK2 WT isogenic line treated with N2 medium alone. mDA neurons harboring LRRK2 G2019S were more susceptible to apoptosis compared to wild-type when cultured in only N2 medium. The magnitude of the difference increased when rotenone was added. (B) LRRK2 G2019S causes a higher sensitivity to cytotoxic stress when compared with the wild-type isogenic line caused by rotenone. Error bars show the standard deviation. These are combined data for isogenic lines L1-1, L1-2, L2-2, L2-3, and C4 at all concentrations used. (C) Cleaved CASPASE3 was preferentially in cells expressing TH after treatment with the indicated conditions. Error bars indicate variation. (D and E) 1.5 μM LRRK2-IN1, which inhibits LRRK2 kinase activity, rescued mDA neurons from apoptosis. Cultures were differentiated in triplicate from L1-1Mut and C4+G2019S, stressed with 50 nM rotenone, and immunostaining for cleaved CASPASE3 and TH double-positive cells (D) and LDH release (E) compared to DMSO-treated controls. Error bars indicate SEM. ∗∗p < 0.01 and ∗∗∗p < 0.001 according to t test. See also Figure S6. To address the question of whether the G2019S mutation results in a gain or loss of function, we repeated the cytotoxicity experiments in the presence of LRRK2-IN1, which is a small molecule inhibitor of LRRK2 kinase activity. We observed a statistically significant increase in mDA neuron survival as measured by cleaved CASPASE3 and TH in the presence of the inhibitor compared to controls (Figures 4D and S6G). A similar trend was observed when cell death was quantified by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release (Figures 4E and S6H). These data suggest that LRRK2 G2019S results in a gain of kinase function, which is consistent with previous reports (Gloeckner et al., 2006Gloeckner C.J. Kinkl N. Schumacher A. Braun R.J. O’Neill E. Meitinger T. Kolch W. Prokisch H. Ueffing M. The Parkinson disease causing LRRK2 mutation I2020T is associated with increased kinase activity.Hum. Mol.

Therefore, multiple phenotypic assays confirm that gene correction of LRRK2 G2019S resulted in functional phenotypic correction. Because multiple lines of evidence suggest a role for TAU in PD pathogenesis, we characterized MAPT transcription and TAU protein levels. qRT-PCR analysis on triplicate samples on day 30 of differentiation demonstrated that MAPT was significantly downregulated by 39% in cultures of mDA neurons containing wild-type LRRK2 compared with isogenic cultures with G2019S LRRK2 (Figure 5A). Western blotting confirmed that TAU protein and phospho-Thr181 TAU were significantly lower in cultures of mDA neurons harboring gene-corrected LRRK2 compared to isogenic cultures with LRRK2 G2019S (Figures 5B, 5C, and S7A). Immunostaining confirmed that neurons expressing TH were also positive for TAU and phospho-TAU (Figure S7B). These data are consistent with previously published data showing a link between patients with PD, MAPT, and LRRK2. Interestingly, it has been shown that TAU enhances αSYN aggregation and toxicity (Badiola et al., 2011Badiola N. de Oliveira R.M. Herrera F. Guardia-Laguarta C. Gonçalves S.A. Pera M.

https://openalex.org/W2063206709,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is a common cause of peripheral neuropathy. Much effort has been devoted to examining the role played by neuronal/axonal mitochondria, but how mitochondrial deficits in peripheral nerve glia (Schwann cells [SCs]) contribute to peripheral nerve diseases remains unclear. Here, we investigate a mouse model of peripheral neuropathy secondary to SC mitochondrial dysfunction (Tfam-SCKOs). We show that disruption of SC mitochondria activates a maladaptive integrated stress response (ISR) through the actions of heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) kinase, and causes a shift in lipid metabolism away from fatty acid synthesis toward oxidation. These alterations in SC lipid metabolism result in depletion of important myelin lipid components as well as in accumulation of acylcarnitines (ACs), an intermediate of fatty acid β-oxidation. Importantly, we show that ACs are released from SCs and induce axonal degeneration. A maladaptive ISR as well as altered SC lipid metabolism are thus underlying pathological mechanisms in mitochondria-related peripheral neuropathies."
https://openalex.org/W1996364982,"Cocaine addiction is characterized by long-lasting vulnerability to relapse arising because neutral environmental stimuli become associated with drug use and then act as cues that induce relapse. It is not known how cues elicit cocaine seeking, and why cocaine seeking is more difficult to regulate than seeking a natural reward. We found that cocaine-associated cues initiate cocaine seeking by inducing a rapid, transient increase in dendritic spine size and synaptic strength in the nucleus accumbens. These changes required neural activity in the prefrontal cortex. This is not the case when identical cues were associated with obtaining sucrose, which did not elicit changes in spine size or synaptic strength. The marked cue-induced synaptic changes in the accumbens were correlated with the intensity of cocaine, but not sucrose seeking, and may explain the difficulty addicts experience in managing relapse to cocaine use."
https://openalex.org/W2007788183,"Sox2 regulates the self-renewal of multiple types of stem cells. Recent studies suggest it also plays oncogenic roles in the formation of squamous carcinoma in several organs, including the esophagus where Sox2 is predominantly expressed in the basal progenitor cells of the stratified epithelium. Here, we use mouse genetic models to reveal a mechanism by which Sox2 cooperates with microenvironmental signals to malignantly transform epithelial progenitor cells. Conditional overexpression of Sox2 in basal cells expands the progenitor population in both the esophagus and forestomach. Significantly, carcinoma only develops in the forestomach, where pathological progression correlates with inflammation and nuclear localization of Stat3 in progenitor cells. Importantly, co-overexpression of Sox2 and activated Stat3 (Stat3C) also transforms esophageal basal cells but not the differentiated suprabasal cells. These findings indicate that basal stem/progenitor cells are the cells of origin of squamous carcinoma and that cooperation between Sox2 and microenvironment-activated Stat3 is required for Sox2-driven tumorigenesis."

One of the fundamental questions posed by these rhythms is how individual neurons or groups of neurons are recruited into different network oscillations. We modeled competing fast and slow oscillators connected to a hub neuron with electrical and inhibitory synapses. We explore the patterns of coordination shown in the network as a function of the electrical coupling and inhibitory synapse strengths with the help of a novel visualization method that we call the ""parameterscape."" The hub neuron can be switched between the fast and slow oscillators by multiple network mechanisms, indicating that a given change in network state can be achieved by degenerate cellular mechanisms.

https://openalex.org/W2154646032,"Molecular determinants of threshold sensitivity of mammalian mechanoreceptors are unknown. Here, we identify a mechanosensitive (MS) K(+) current (IKmech) that governs mechanical threshold and adaptation of distinct populations of mechanoreceptors. Toxin profiling and transgenic mouse studies indicate that IKmech is carried by Kv1.1-Kv1.2 heteromers. Mechanosensitivity is attributed to Kv1.1 subunits, through facilitation of voltage-dependent open probability. IKmech is expressed in high-threshold C-mechano-nociceptors (C-HTMRs) and Aβ-mechanoreceptors, but not in low-threshold C-mechanoreceptors. IKmech opposes depolarization induced by slow/ultraslow MS cation currents in C-HTMRs, thereby shifting mechanical threshold for firing to higher values. However, due to kinetics mismatch with rapidly-adapting MS cation currents, IKmech tunes firing adaptation but not mechanical threshold in Aβ-mechanoreceptors. Expression of Kv1.1 dominant negative or inhibition of Kv1.1/IKmech caused severe mechanical allodynia but not heat hyperalgesia. By balancing the activity of excitatory mechanotransducers, Kv1.1 acts as a mechanosensitive brake that regulates mechanical sensitivity of fibers associated with mechanical perception."
https://openalex.org/W1979755858,"Experience rearranges anatomical connectivity in the brain, but such plasticity is suppressed in adulthood. We examined the turnover of dendritic spines and axonal varicosities in the somatosensory cortex of mice lacking Nogo Receptor 1 (NgR1). Through adolescence, the anatomy and plasticity of ngr1 null mice are indistinguishable from control, but suppression of turnover after age 26 days fails to occur in ngr1-/- mice. Adolescent anatomical plasticity can be restored to 1-year-old mice by conditional deletion of ngr1. Suppression of anatomical dynamics by NgR1 is cell autonomous and is phenocopied by deletion of Nogo-A ligand. Whisker removal deprives the somatosensory cortex of experience-dependent input and reduces dendritic spine turnover in adult ngr1-/- mice to control levels, while an acutely enriched environment increases dendritic spine dynamics in control mice to the level of ngr1-/- mice in a standard environment. Thus, NgR1 determines the low set point for synaptic turnover in adult cerebral cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2061724345,"Background Conventional ways of making bio-electrodes are generally complicated, expensive and unconformable. Here we describe for the first time the method of applying Ga-based liquid metal ink as drawable electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes. Such material owns unique merits in both liquid phase conformability and high electrical conductivity, which provides flexible ways for making electrical circuits on skin surface and a prospective substitution of conventional rigid printed circuit boards (PCBs). Methods Fundamental measurements of impedance and polarization voltage of the liquid metal ink were carried out to evaluate its basic electrical properties. Conceptual experiments were performed to draw the alloy as bio-electrodes to acquire ECG signals from both rabbit and human via a wireless module developed on the mobile phone. Further, a typical electrical circuit was drawn in the palm with the ink to demonstrate its potential of implementing more sophisticated skin circuits. Results With an oxide concentration of 0.34%, the resistivity of the liquid metal ink was measured as 44.1 µΩ·cm with quite low reactance in the form of straight line. Its peak polarization voltage with the physiological saline was detected as −0.73 V. The quality of ECG wave detected from the liquid metal electrodes was found as good as that of conventional electrodes, from both rabbit and human experiments. In addition, the circuit drawn with the liquid metal ink in the palm also runs efficiently. When the loop was switched on, all the light emitting diodes (LEDs) were lit and emitted colorful lights. Conclusions The liquid metal ink promises unique printable electrical properties as both bio-electrodes and electrical wires. The implemented ECG measurement on biological surface and the successfully run skin circuit demonstrated the conformability and attachment of the liquid metal. The present method is expected to innovate future physiological measurement and biological circuit manufacturing technique in a large extent."
https://openalex.org/W2044182690,"Motor lateralization in humans has primarily been characterized as “handedness”, resulting in the view that one arm-hemisphere system is specialized for all aspects of movement while the other is simply a weaker analogue. We have proposed an alternative view that motor lateralization reflects proficiency of each arm for complementary functions that arises from a specialization of each hemisphere for distinct movement control mechanisms. However, before this idea of hemispheric specialization can be accepted, it is necessary to precisely identify these distinct, lateralized mechanisms. Here we show in right-handers that dominant arm movements rely on predictive mechanisms that anticipate and account for the dynamic properties of the arm, while the non-dominant arm optimizes positional stability by specifying impedance around equilibrium positions. In a targeted-reaching paradigm, we covertly and occasionally shifted the hand starting location either orthogonal to or collinear with a particular direction of movement. On trials on which the start positions were shifted orthogonally, we did not notice any strong interlimb differences. However, on trials on which start positions were shifted orthogonally, the dominant arm largely maintained the direction and straightness of its trajectory, while the non-dominant arm deviated towards the previously learned goal position, consistent with the hypothesized control specialization of each arm-hemisphere system. These results bring together two competing theories about mechanisms of movement control, and suggest that they coexist in the brain in different hemispheres. These findings also question the traditional view of handedness, because specialized mechanisms for each arm-hemisphere system were identified within a group of right-handers. It is likely that such hemispheric specialization emerged to accommodate increasing motor complexity during evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2088544056,"Malate, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolite, increased lifespan and thermotolerance in the nematode C. elegans. Malate can be synthesized from fumarate by the enzyme fumarase and further oxidized to oxaloacetate by malate dehydrogenase with the accompanying reduction of NAD. Addition of fumarate also extended lifespan, but succinate addition did not, although all three intermediates activated nuclear translocation of the cytoprotective DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor and protected from paraquat-induced oxidative stress. The glyoxylate shunt, an anabolic pathway linked to lifespan extension in C. elegans, reversibly converts isocitrate and acetyl-CoA to succinate, malate, and CoA. The increased longevity provided by malate addition did not occur in fumarase (fum-1), glyoxylate shunt (gei-7), succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein (sdha-2), or soluble fumarate reductase F48E8.3 RNAi knockdown worms. Therefore, to increase lifespan, malate must be first converted to fumarate, then fumarate must be reduced to succinate by soluble fumarate reductase and the mitochondrial electron transport chain complex II. Reduction of fumarate to succinate is coupled with the oxidation of FADH2 to FAD. Lifespan extension induced by malate depended upon the longevity regulators DAF-16 and SIR-2.1. Malate supplementation did not extend the lifespan of long-lived eat-2 mutant worms, a model of dietary restriction. Malate and fumarate addition increased oxygen consumption, but decreased ATP levels and mitochondrial membrane potential suggesting a mild uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Malate also increased NADPH, NAD, and the NAD/NADH ratio. Fumarate reduction, glyoxylate shunt activity, and mild mitochondrial uncoupling likely contribute to the lifespan extension induced by malate and fumarate by increasing the amount of oxidized NAD and FAD cofactors."
https://openalex.org/W2055294046,"Previous studies of serial cloning in animals showed a decrease in efficiency over repeated iterations and a failure in all species after a few generations. This limitation led to the suggestion that repeated recloning might be inherently impossible because of the accumulation of lethal genetic or epigenetic abnormalities. However, we have now succeeded in carrying out repeated recloning in the mouse through a somatic cell nuclear transfer method that includes a histone deacetylase inhibitor. The cloning efficiency did not decrease over 25 generations, and, to date, we have obtained more than 500 viable offspring from a single original donor mouse. The reprogramming efficiency also did not increase over repeated rounds of nuclear transfer, and we did not see the accumulation of reprogramming errors or clone-specific abnormalities. Therefore, our results show that repeated iterative recloning is possible and suggest that, with adequately efficient techniques, it may be possible to reclone animals indefinitely."

In contrast, IL-5, IFN gamma, IL-4 and IL-2 showed slightly (1.4-fold to 5.9-fold) lower levels in the NEC samples. However, these cytokines showed a very low absolute concentration in infants with NEC and in controls. The sum of the serum concentrations of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 was able to clearly separate infants with NEC from control samples. IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha showed no statistically different levels. The serum levels of TNF-beta and IL-12p70 were below the detection limit in more than 50% of all samples per group.In spite of strong local inflammation only three out of eleven cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10) showed strongly increased serum levels indicating an important role of them in the pathogenesis of NEC. At least two of these three cytokines were elevated in every single NEC patient. Thus, longitudinal monitoring of combined IL-8, IL-6, and IL-10 levels could reveal their potency in being clinical relevant markers in NEC."

https://openalex.org/W1998845066,"We disrupted the gene encoding lysophosphatidylinositol-acyltransferase-1 (LPIAT1) in the mouse with the aim of understanding its role in determining cellular phosphoinositide content. LPIAT1(-/-) mice were born at lower than Mendelian ratios and exhibited a severe developmental brain defect. We compared the phospholipid content of livers and brains from LPIAT1(-/-) and LPIAT1(+/+) littermates by LC-ESI/MS. In accord with previous studies, the most abundant molecular species of each phosphoinositide class (PtdIns, PtdInsP, PtdInsP2 and PtdInsP3) possessed a C38∶4 complement of fatty-acyl esters (C18∶0 and C20∶4 are usually assigned to the sn-1 and sn-2 positions, respectively). LPIAT1(-/-) liver and brain contained relatively less of the C38∶4 species of PtdIns, PtdInsP and PtdInsP2 (dropping from 95-97% to 75-85% of the total species measured for each lipid class) and relatively more of the less abundant species (PtdInsP3 less abundant species were below our quantification levels). The increases in the less abundant PtdIns and PtdInsP2 species did not compensate for the loss in C38∶4 species, resulting in a 26-44% reduction in total PtdIns and PtdInsP2 levels in both brain and liver. LPIAT1(-/-) brain and liver also contained increased levels of C18∶0 lyso-PtdIns (300% and 525% respectively) indicating a defect in the reacylation of this molecule. LPIAT1(-/-) brain additionally contained significantly reduced C38∶4 PC and PE levels (by 47% and 55% respectively), possibly contributing to the phenotype in this organ. The levels of all other molecular species of PC, PE, PS and PA measured in the brain and liver were very similar between LPIAT1(-/-) and LPIAT1(+/+) samples. These results suggest LPIAT1 activity plays a non-redundant role in maintaining physiological levels of PtdIns within an active deacylation/reacylation cycle in mouse tissues. They also suggest that this pathway must act in concert with other, as yet unidentified, mechanisms to achieve the enrichment observed in C38∶4 molecular species of phosphoinositides."
https://openalex.org/W1987628030,"In this study, we evaluated the possible role of Ligia italica as a bioindicator for the monitoring of heavy metals pollution in the suppralittoral zone of marine rocky coasts. Between 2004 and 2011 specimens of L. italica were collected along the Eastern Sicilian coasts from sites known for their high pollution levels as they are near to an area where in September 2001 a refinery plant discharged into the sea some waste containing Hg. Other specimens were collected from the Vendicari Natural Reserve located about 30 miles from the polluted sites and used as control area. On a consistent number of animals, the concentration in toto of As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Ni, Pb, V, was determined by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. On other animals, investigations were carried out in order to check for ultrastructural alterations of the hepatopancreas, that is the main metals storage organ in isopods. Results revealed the presence, in the animals collected in 2004 from the polluted sites, of considerable concentrations of Hg and of lower concentrations of other metals such as As, Pb and V. The Hg bioaccumulation resulted in remarkable ultrastructural alterations of the two cellular types (B and S cells) in the epithelium of the hepatopancreas. Surprisingly, a moderate amount of Hg was also found in specimens collected in 2004 from the Vendicari Natural Reserve, proving that the Hg pollution can also spread many miles away. Animals collected from the polluted sites in the following years showed a progressively decreasing Hg content, reaching very low levels in those from the last sampling. Also, the ultrastructural alterations found in the hepatopancreas of the animals from the last sample were quite irrelevant. In conclusion, Ligia italica can represent a good bioindicator and the ultrastructure of the hepatopancreas could be used as ultrastructural biomarker of heavy metals pollution in the supralittoral zones."
https://openalex.org/W2008626006,"Multisensory integration is a common feature of the mammalian brain that allows it to deal more efficiently with the ambiguity of sensory input by combining complementary signals from several sensory sources. Growing evidence suggests that multisensory interactions can occur as early as primary sensory cortices. Here we present incompatible visual signals (orthogonal gratings) to each eye to create visual competition between monocular inputs in primary visual cortex where binocular combination would normally take place. The incompatibility prevents binocular fusion and triggers an ambiguous perceptual response in which the two images are perceived one at a time in an irregular alternation. One key function of multisensory integration is to minimize perceptual ambiguity by exploiting cross-sensory congruence. We show that a haptic signal matching one of the visual alternatives helps disambiguate visual perception during binocular rivalry by both prolonging the dominance period of the congruent visual stimulus and by shortening its suppression period. Importantly, this interaction is strictly tuned for orientation, with a mismatch as small as 7.5° between visual and haptic orientations sufficient to annul the interaction. These results indicate important conclusions: first, that vision and touch interact at early levels of visual processing where interocular conflicts are first detected and orientation tunings are narrow, and second, that haptic input can influence visual signals outside of visual awareness, bringing a stimulus made invisible by binocular rivalry suppression back to awareness sooner than would occur without congruent haptic input."

The results showed that the corresponding mutations (synonymous codons) according to the codon bias in Pichia pastoris were successfully introduced into keratinase gene. The highest keratinase activity produced by P. pastoris pPICZαA-kerAwt, pPICZαA-kerAopti1 and pPICZαA-kerAopti2 was 195 U/ml, 324 U/ml and 293 U/ml respectively. In addition, there was no significant difference in biomass concentration, target gene copy numbers and relative mRNA expression levels of every positive strain. The molecular weight of keratinase secreted by recombinant P. pastori was approx. 39 kDa. It was optimally active at pH 7.5 and 50°C. The recombinant keratinase could efficiently degrade both α-keratin (keratin azure) and β-keratin (chicken feather meal). These properties make the P. pastoris pPICZαA-kerAopti1 a suitable candidate for industrial production of keratinases."
https://openalex.org/W2119757880,"The presence of oligoclonal bands (OCB) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a typical finding in multiple sclerosis (MS). We applied data from Norwegian, Swedish and Danish (i.e. Scandinavian) MS patients from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to search for genetic differences in MS relating to OCB status. GWAS data was compared in 1367 OCB positive and 161 OCB negative Scandinavian MS patients, and nine of the most associated SNPs were genotyped for replication in 3403 Scandinavian MS patients. HLA-DRB1 genotypes were analyzed in a subset of the OCB positive (n = 2781) and OCB negative (n = 292) MS patients and compared to 890 healthy controls. Results from the genome-wide analyses showed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the HLA complex and six other loci were associated to OCB status. In SNPs selected for replication, combined analyses showed genome-wide significant association for two SNPs in the HLA complex; rs3129871 (p = 5.7×10−15) and rs3817963 (p = 5.7×10−10) correlating with the HLA-DRB1*15 and the HLA-DRB1*04 alleles, respectively. We also found suggestive association to one SNP in the Calsyntenin-2 gene (p = 8.83×10−7). In HLA-DRB1 analyses HLA-DRB1*15∶01 was a stronger risk factor for OCB positive than OCB negative MS, whereas HLA-DRB1*04∶04 was associated with increased risk of OCB negative MS and reduced risk of OCB positive MS. Protective effects of HLA-DRB1*01∶01 and HLA-DRB1*07∶01 were detected in both groups. The groups were different with regard to age at onset (AAO), MS outcome measures and gender. This study confirms both shared and distinct genetic risk for MS subtypes in the Scandinavian population defined by OCB status and indicates different clinical characteristics between the groups. This suggests differences in disease mechanisms between OCB negative and OCB positive MS with implications for patient management, which need to be further studied."
https://openalex.org/W2003251187,"PTEN induced kinase 1 (PINK1) is a serine/threonine kinase in the outer membrane of mitochondria (OMM), and known as a responsible gene of Parkinson's disease (PD).

However, a large part of PINK1 import mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we examined using cell-free system the mechanism by which PINK1 is targeted to and assembled into mitochondria. Surprisingly, the main component of the import channel, Tom40 was not necessary for PINK1 import. Furthermore, we revealed that the import receptor Tom70 is essential for PINK1 import. In addition, we observed that although PINK1 has predicted mitochondrial targeting signal, it was not processed by the mitochondrial processing peptidase. Thus, our results suggest that PINK1 is imported into mitochondria by a unique pathway that is independent of the TOM core complex but crucially depends on the import receptor Tom70."
https://openalex.org/W2059191883,"One of the most common visual adaptations seen in the mesopelagic zone (200-1000 m), where the amount of light diminishes exponentially with depth and where bioluminescent organisms predominate, is the enlargement of the eye and pupil area. However, it remains unclear how eye size is influenced by depth, other environmental conditions and phylogeny. In this study, we determine the factors influencing variability in eye size and assess whether this variability is explained by ecological differences in habitat and lifestyle within a family of mesopelagic fishes characterized by broad intra- and interspecific variance in depth range and luminous patterns. We focus our study on the lanternfish family (Myctophidae) and hypothesise that lanternfishes with a deeper distribution and/or a reduction of bioluminescent emissions have smaller eyes and that ecological factors rather than phylogenetic relationships will drive the evolution of the visual system. Eye diameter and standard length were measured in 237 individuals from 61 species of lanternfishes representing all the recognised tribes within the family in addition to compiling an ecological dataset including depth distribution during night and day and the location and sexual dimorphism of luminous organs. Hypotheses were tested by investigating the relationship between the relative size of the eye (corrected for body size) and variations in depth and/or patterns of luminous-organs using phylogenetic comparative analyses. Results show a great variability in relative eye size within the Myctophidae at all taxonomic levels (from subfamily to genus), suggesting that this character may have evolved several times. However, variability in eye size within the family could not be explained by any of our ecological variables (bioluminescence and depth patterns), and appears to be driven solely by phylogenetic relationships."

Polymorphisms mapping to microRNA (miRNA) binding sites have been shown to disrupt the ability of miRNAs to target genes resulting in differential mRNA and protein expression. Skin tumor susceptibility 5 (Skts5) was identified as a locus conferring susceptibility to chemically-induced skin cancer in NIH/Ola by SPRET/Outbred F1 backcrosses. To determine if polymorphisms between the strains which mapped to putative miRNA binding sites in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of genes at Skts5 influenced expression, we conducted a systematic evaluation of 3'UTRs of candidate genes across this locus. Nine genes had polymorphisms in their 3'UTRs which fit the linkage data and eight of these contained polymorphisms suspected to interfere with or introduce miRNA binding. 3'UTRs of six genes, Bcap29, Dgkb, Hbp1, Pik3cg, Twistnb, and Tspan13 differentially affected luciferase expression, but did not appear to be differentially regulated by the evaluated miRNAs predicted to bind to only one of the two isoforms. 3'UTRs from four additional genes chosen from the locus that fit less stringent criteria were evaluated. Ifrd1 and Etv1 showed differences and contained polymorphisms predicted to disrupt or create miRNA binding sites but showed no difference in regulation by the miRNAs tested. In summary, multiple 3'UTRs with putative functional variants between susceptible and resistant strains of mice influenced differential expression independent of predicted miRNA binding."

Identifying the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating sensory hair cell death is critical towards developing effective treatments for preventing hair cell damage. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to participate in the regulatory mechanisms of inner ear development and homeostasis. However, their involvement in cochlear sensory cell degeneration following acoustic trauma is unknown. Here, we profiled the expression pattern of miRNAs in the cochlear sensory epithelium, defined miRNA responses to acoustic overstimulation, and explored potential mRNA targets of miRNAs that may be responsible for the stress responses of the cochlea. Expression analysis of miRNAs in the cochlear sensory epithelium revealed constitutive expression of 176 miRNAs, many of which have not been previously reported in cochlear tissue. Exposure to intense noise caused significant threshold shift and apoptotic activity in the cochleae. Gene expression analysis of noise-traumatized cochleae revealed time-dependent transcriptional changes in the expression of miRNAs. Target prediction analysis revealed potential target genes of the significantly downregulated miRNAs, many of which had cell death- and apoptosis-related functions. Verification of the predicted targets revealed a significant upregulation of Taok1, a target of miRNA-183. Moreover, inhibition of miR-183 with morpholino antisense oligos in cochlear organotypic cultures revealed a negative correlation between the expression levels of miR-183 and Taok1, suggesting the presence of a miR-183/Taok1 target pair. Together, miRNA profiling as well as the target analysis and validation suggest the involvement of miRNAs in the regulation of the degenerative process of the cochlea following acoustic overstimulation. The miR-183/Taok1 target pair is likely to play a role in this regulatory process."

In this study, however, we show that the Mtb-susceptible CBA/J mouse strain accumulates large numbers of CD8(+) T cells in the lung as infection progresses, and that these cells display a dysfunctional and immunosuppressive phenotype (PD-1(+), Tim-3(+), CD122(+)). CD8(+) T cell expansions from the lungs of Mtb-infected CBA/J mice were also capable of secreting the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10), although in vivo CD8(+) T cell depletion did not significantly alter Mtb burden. Further analysis revealed that pulmonary CD8(+) T cells from Mtb-infected CBA/J mice were clonally expanded, preferentially expressing T cell receptor (TcR) Vβ chain 8 (8.2, 8.3) or Vβ 14. Although Vβ8(+) CD8(+) T cells were responsible for the majority of IL-10 production, in vivo depletion of Vβ8(+) did not significantly change the outcome of Mtb infection, which we hypothesize was a consequence of their dual IL-10/IFN-γ secreting profiles. Our data demonstrate that IL-10-secreting CD8(+) T cells can arise during chronic Mtb infection, although the significance of this T cell population in tuberculosis pathogenesis remains unclear."
https://openalex.org/W2121845272,"The neuropathogenesis of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may manifest as various neurocognitive impairments (NCI). HIV-positive individuals also have significantly shorter telomere length (TL) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and CD8+ T cells compared to HIV-negative individuals. Additionally, reduced TL has been found to be associated with chronic psychological stress. This study focused on the effects of HIV-infection and chronic stress associated with childhood trauma on telomere length, and investigated whether leukocyte TL (LTL), in particular, represents a risk factor for NCI. Eighty-three HIV-positive and 45 HIV-negative women were assessed for childhood trauma and were subjected to detailed neurocognitive testing. Blood from each participant was used to extract Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Relative LTL were determined by performing real time quantitative PCR reactions as described by Cawthon et al. (2002). As expected, relative LTL in the HIV-positive individuals was significantly shorter than that of HIV-negative individuals (F = 51.56, p = <0.01). Notably, a significant positive correlation was evident between relative LTL and learning performance in the HIV-positive group. In addition, a significant negative correlation was observed between relative LTL and verbal fluency, but this association was only evident in HIV-positive individuals who had experienced trauma. Our results suggest that reduced LTL is associated with worse learning performance in HIV-positive individuals, indicating that TL could act as a susceptibility factor in increasing neurocognitive decline in HIV-infected individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2014419331,"Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is a highly damaging begomovirus native to the Middle East. TYLCV has recently spread worldwide, recombining with other begomoviruses. Recent analysis of mixed infections between TYLCV and Tomato leaf curl Comoros begomovirus (ToLCKMV) has shown that, although natural selection preserves certain co-evolved intra-genomic interactions, numerous and diverse recombinants are produced at 120 days post-inoculation (dpi), and recombinant populations from different tomato plants are very divergent. Here, we investigate the population dynamics that lead to such patterns in tomato plants co-infected with TYLCV and ToLCKMV either by agro-inoculation or using the natural whitefly vector Bemisia tabaci. We monitored the frequency of parental and recombinant genotypes independently in 35 plants between 18 and 330 dpi and identified 177 recombinants isolated at different times. Recombinants were detected from 18 dpi and their frequency increased over time to reach about 50% at 150 dpi regardless of the inoculation method. The distribution of breakpoints detected on 96 fully sequenced recombinants was consistent with a continuous generation of new recombinants as well as random and deterministic effects in their maintenance. A severe population bottleneck of around 10 genomes was estimated during early systemic infection-a phenomenon that could account partially for the heterogeneity in recombinant patterns observed among plants. The detection of the same recombinant genome in six of the thirteen plants analysed beyond 30 dpi supported the influence of selection on observed recombination patterns. Moreover, a highly virulent recombinant genotype dominating virus populations within one plant has, apparently, the potential to be maintained in the natural population according to its infectivity, within-host accumulation, and transmission efficiency - all of which were similar or intermediate to those of the parent genotypes. Our results anticipate the outcomes of natural encounters between TYLCV and ToLCKMV."
https://openalex.org/W2014636111,"Gene MAGEA1 belongs to a group of human germline-specific genes that rely on DNA methylation for repression in somatic tissues. Many of these genes, termed cancer-germline (CG) genes, become demethylated and activated in a wide variety of tumors, where they encode tumor-specific antigens. The process leading to DNA demethylation of CG genes in tumors remains unclear. Previous data suggested that histone acetylation might be involved. Here, we investigated the relative contribution of DNA methylation and histone acetylation in the epigenetic regulation of gene MAGEA1. We show that MAGEA1 DNA hypomethylation in expressing melanoma cells is indeed correlated with local increases in histone H3 acetylation (H3ac). However, when MAGEA1-negative cells were exposed to a histone deacetylase inhibitor (TSA), we observed only short-term activation of the gene and detected no demethylation of its promoter. As a more sensitive assay, we used a cell clone harboring a methylated MAGEA1/hph construct, which confers resistance to hygromycin upon stable re-activation. TSA induced only transient de-repression of the transgene, and did not lead to the emergence of hygromycin-resistant cells. In striking contrast, transient depletion of DNA-methyltransferase-1 in the reporter cell clone gave rise to a hygromycin-resistant population, in which the re-activated MAGEA1/hph transgene displayed not only marked DNA hypomethylation, but also significant reversal of histone marks, including gains in H3ac and H3K4me2, and losses of H3K9me2. Collectively, our results indicate that DNA methylation has a dominant role in the epigenetic hierarchy governing MAGEA1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2146229756,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily, have been shown to play important roles in the nervous system, including neuronal survival and synaptogenesis. However, the physiological functions of BMP signaling in the mammalian neuromuscular system are not well understood. In this study, we found that proteins of the type II bone morphogenetic receptors (BMPRII) were detected at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), and one of its ligands, BMP4, was expressed by Schwann cells and skeletal muscle fibers. In double-ligated nerves, BMP4 proteins accumulated at the proximal and distal portions of the axons, suggesting that Schwann cell- and muscle fiber-derived BMP4 proteins were anterogradely and retrogradely transported by motor neurons. Furthermore, BMP4 mRNA was down-regulated in nerves but up-regulated in skeletal muscles following nerve ligation. The motor neuron-muscle interactions were also demonstrated using differentiated C2C12 muscle cells and NG108-15 neurons in vitro. BMP4 mRNA and immunoreactivity were significantly up-regulated in differentiated C2C12 muscle cells when the motor neuron-derived factor, agrin, was present in the culture. Peripherally-derived BMP4, on the other hand, promotes embryonic motor neuron survival and protects NG108-15 neurons from glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Together, these data suggest that BMP4 is a peripherally-derived factor that may regulate the survival of motor neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2035528923,"Purpose Protein kinase plays an essential role in controlling cardiac growth and hypertrophic remodeling. The cardiac troponin I-interacting kinase (TNNI3K), a novel cardiac specific kinase, is associated with cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. However, the precise function of TNNI3K in regulating cardiac remodeling has remained controversial. Methods and Results In a rat model of cardiac hypertrophy generated by transverse aortic constriction, myocardial TNNI3K expression was significantly increased by 1.62 folds (P<0.05) after constriction for 15 days. To investigate the role of TNNI3K in cardiac hypertrophy, we generated transgenic mouse lines with overexpression of human TNNI3K specifically in the heart. At the age of 3 months, the high-copy-number TNNI3K transgenic mice demonstrated a phenotype of concentric hypertrophy with increased heart weight normalized to body weight (1.31 fold, P<0.01). Echocardiography and non-invasive hemodynamic assessments showed enhanced cardiac function. No necrosis or myocyte disarray was observed in the heart of TNNI3K transgenic mice. This concentric hypertrophy maintained up to 12 months of age without cardiac dysfunction. The phospho amino acid analysis revealed that TNNI3K is a protein-tyrosine kinase. The yeast two-hybrid screen and co-immunoprecipitation assay identified cTnI as a target for TNNI3K. Moreover, TNNI3K overexpression induced cTnI phosphorylation at Ser22/Ser23 in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that TNNI3K is a novel upstream regulator for cTnI phosphorylation. Conclusion TNNI3K promotes a concentric hypertrophy with enhancement of cardiac function via regulating the phosphorylation of cTnI. TNNI3K could be a potential therapeutic target for preventing from heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W1993070648,"The Influence of trehalose-based glycolipids in the virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is recognised; however, the actual role of these cell-wall glycolipids in latent infection is unknown. As an initial approach, we determined by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography the sulfolipid (SL) and diacyltrehalose/polyacyltrehalose (DAT/PAT) profile of the cell wall of hypoxic Mtb. Then, qRT-PCR was extensively conducted to determine the transcription profile of genes involved in the biosynthesis of these glycolipids in non-replicating persistent 1 (NRP1) and anaerobiosis (NRP2) models of hypoxia (Wayne model), and murine models of chronic and progressive pulmonary tuberculosis. A diminished content of SL and increased amounts of glycolipids with chromatographic profile similar to DAT were detected in Mtb grown in the NRP2 stage. A striking decrease in the transcription of mmpL8 and mmpL10 transporter genes and increased transcription of the pks (polyketidesynthase) genes involved in SL and DAT biosynthesis were detected in both the NRP2 stage and the murine model of chronic infection. All genes were found to be up-regulated in the progressive disease. These results suggest that SL production is diminished during latent infection and the DAT/PAT precursors can be accumulated inside tubercle bacilli and are possibly used in reactivation processes."
https://openalex.org/W2017468039,"The detection of small amounts (nanomoles) of inorganic phosphate has a great interest in biochemistry. In particular, phosphate detection is useful to evaluate the rate of hydrolysis of phosphatases, that are enzymes able to remove phosphate from their substrate by hydrolytic cleavage. The hydrolysis rate is correlated to enzyme activity, an extremely important functional parameter. Among phosphatases there are the cation transporting adenosinetriphosphatases (ATPases), that produce inorganic phosphate by cleavage of the γ-phosphate of ATP. These membrane transporters have many fundamental physiological roles and are emerging as potential drug targets. ATPase hydrolytic activity is measured to test enzyme functionality, but it also provides useful information on possible inhibitory effects of molecules that interfere with the hydrolytic process. We have optimized a molybdenum-based protocol that makes use of potassium antimony (III) oxide tartrate (originally employed for phosphate detection in environmental analysis) to allow its use with phosphatase enzymes. In particular, the method was successfully applied to native and recombinant ATPases to demonstrate its reliability, validity, sensitivity and versatility. Our method introduces significant improvements to well-established experimental assays, which are currently employed for ATPase activity measurements. Therefore, it may be valuable in biochemical and biomedical investigations of ATPase enzymes, in combination with more specific tests, as well as in high throughput drug screening."
https://openalex.org/W2164361322,"Background Plastic root-foraging responses have been widely recognized as an important strategy for plants to explore heterogeneously distributed resources. However, the benefits and costs of root foraging have received little attention. Methodology/Principal Findings In a greenhouse experiment, we grew pairs of connected ramets of 22 genotypes of the stoloniferous plant Potentilla reptans in paired pots, between which the contrast in nutrient availability was set as null, medium and high, but with the total nutrient amount kept the same. We calculated root-foraging intensity of each individual ramet pair as the difference in root mass between paired ramets divided by the total root mass. For each genotype, we then calculated root-foraging ability as the slope of the regression of root-foraging intensity against patch contrast. For all genotypes, root-foraging intensity increased with patch contrast and the total biomass and number of offspring ramets were lowest at high patch contrast. Among genotypes, root-foraging intensity was positively related to production of offspring ramets and biomass in the high patch-contrast treatment, which indicates an evolutionary benefit of root foraging in heterogeneous environments. However, we found no significant evidence that the ability of plastic foraging imposes costs under homogeneous conditions (i.e. when foraging is not needed). Conclusions/Significance Our results show that plants of P. reptans adjust their root-foraging intensity according to patch contrast. Moreover, the results show that the root foraging has an evolutionary advantage in heterogeneous environments, while costs of having the ability of plastic root foraging were absent or very small."
https://openalex.org/W2057174250,"The representation of actions within the action-observation network is thought to rely on a distributed functional organization. Furthermore, recent findings indicate that the action-observation network encodes not merely the observed motor act, but rather a representation that is independent from a specific sensory modality or sensory experience. In the present study, we wished to determine to what extent this distributed and ‘more abstract’ representation of action is truly supramodal, i.e. shares a common coding across sensory modalities. To this aim, a pattern recognition approach was employed to analyze neural responses in sighted and congenitally blind subjects during visual and/or auditory presentation of hand-made actions. Multivoxel pattern analyses-based classifiers discriminated action from non-action stimuli across sensory conditions (visual and auditory) and experimental groups (blind and sighted). Moreover, these classifiers labeled as ‘action’ the pattern of neural responses evoked during actual motor execution. Interestingly, discriminative information for the action/non action classification was located in a bilateral, but left-prevalent, network that strongly overlaps with brain regions known to form the action-observation network and the human mirror system. The ability to identify action features with a multivoxel pattern analyses-based classifier in both sighted and blind individuals and independently from the sensory modality conveying the stimuli clearly supports the hypothesis of a supramodal, distributed functional representation of actions, mainly within the action-observation network."
https://openalex.org/W2071301053,"Noroviruses (NoVs) cause epidemic acute gastroenteritis, in which histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) may play an important role in the host susceptibility. To further explore this issue, two outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis caused by a GII.4 and a GII.3 NoV, respectively, in China in 2009 were studied. Stool and saliva samples from symptomatic patients and water samples from the outbreak facilities were collected. RT-PCR showed that 23 out of 33 (GII.4 outbreak) and 12 out of 13 (GII.3outbreak) stool samples were NoV positive. For the GII.4 outbreak the NoV sequences of stool and water samples were from an identical GII.4 strain, while the same GII.3 NoV sequences were found in five stool samples from the GII.3 outbreak. The HBGA phenotypes (A, B, Le(a), Le(b), Le(x), and Le(y)) of all saliva samples were determined, which revealed both secretors and nonsecretors in the symptomatic groups of the two outbreaks. In the GII.3 outbreak, type O individuals appeared less susceptible, while the type A may be more at risk of infection. However, No preference of HBGAs was observed in the GII.4 outbreak. The observation that nonsecretors were infected in both outbreaks differed from the previous results that nonsecretors are resistant to these two GII NoVs."

One active field of research is the manipulation of DCs as pharmacological targets to screen novel biological modifiers for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Acetylcorynoline is the major alkaloid component derived from Corydalis bungeana herbs. We assessed the capability of acetylcorynoline to regulate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated activation of mouse bone marrow-derived DCs.Our experimental data showed that treatment with up to 20 µM acetylcorynoline does not cause cytotoxicity in cells. Acetylcorynoline significantly inhibited the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interleukin-12p70 by LPS-stimulated DCs. The expression of LPS-induced major histocompatibility complex class II, CD40, and CD86 on DCs was also decreased by acetylcorynoline, and the endocytic capacity of LPS-stimulated DCs was restored by acetylcorynoline. In addition, LPS-stimulated DC-elicited allogeneic T-cell proliferation was blocked by acetylcorynoline, and the migratory ability of LPS-stimulated DCs was reduced by acetylcorynoline. Moreover, acetylcorynoline significantly inhibits LPS-induced activation of IκB kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase. Importantly, administration of acetylcorynoline significantly attenuates 2,4-dinitro-1-fluorobenzene-induced delayed-type hypersensitivity.Acetylcorynoline may be one of the potent immunosuppressive agents through the blockage of DC maturation and function."
https://openalex.org/W2068521920,"We have previously identified Usp46, which encodes for ubiquitin-specific peptidase 46, as a quantitative trait gene affecting the immobility time of mice in the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test. The mutation that we identified was a 3-bp deletion coding for lysine (Lys 92), and mice with this mutation (MT mice), as well as Usp46 KO mice exhibited shorter TST immobility times. Behavioral pharmacology suggests that the gamma aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor is involved in regulating TST immobility time. In order to understand how far Usp46 controls behavioral phenotypes, which could be related to mental disorders in humans, we subjected Usp46 MT and KO mice to multiple behavioral tests, including the open field test, ethanol preference test, ethanol-induced loss of righting reflex test, sucrose preference test, novelty-suppressed feeding test, marble burying test, and novel object recognition test. Although behavioral phenotypes of the Usp46 MT and KO mice were not always identical, deficiency of Usp46 significantly affected performance in all these tests. In the open field test, activity levels were lower in Usp46 KO mice than wild type (WT) or MT mice. Both MT and KO mice showed lower ethanol preference and shorter recovery times after ethanol administration. Compared to WT mice, Usp46 MT and KO mice exhibited decreased sucrose preference, took longer latency periods to bite pellets, and buried more marbles in the sucrose preference test, novelty-suppressed feeding test, and marble burying test, respectively. In the novel object recognition test, neither MT nor KO mice showed an increase in exploration of a new object 24 hours after training. These findings indicate that Usp46 regulates a wide range of behavioral phenotypes that might be related to human mental disorders and provides insight into the function of USP46 deubiquitinating enzyme in the neural system."

We evaluated its effects in a model of rat laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) using a transscleral approach. We used variable concentrations of vasohibin-1 in the devices, and used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting to measure the released vasohibin-1 (0.31 nM/day when using the 10 μM vasohibin-1 delivery device [10VDD]). The released vasohibin-1 showed suppression activity comparable to native effects when evaluated using endothelial tube formation. We also used pelletized vasohibin-1 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled 40 kDa dextran as controls. Strong fluorescein staining was observed on the sclera when the device was used for drug delivery, whereas pellet use produced strong staining in the conjunctiva and surrounding tissue, but not on the sclera. Vasohibin-1 was found in the sclera, choroid, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and neural retina after device implantation. Stronger immunoreactivity at the RPE and ganglion cell layers was observed than in other retinal regions. Significantly lower fluorescein angiography (FA) scores and smaller CNV areas in the flat mounts of RPE-choroid-sclera were observed for the 10VDD, VDD (1 μM vasohibin-1 delivery device), and vasohibin-1 intravitreal direct injection (0.24 μM) groups when compared to the pellet, non-vasohibin-1 delivery device, and intravitreal vehicle injection groups. Choroidal neovascularization can be treated with transscleral sustained protein delivery using our novel device. We offer a safer sustained protein release for treatment of retinal disease using the transscleral approach."
https://openalex.org/W2024759720,"The dengue envelope glycoprotein (E) is the major component of virion surface and its ectodomain is composed of domains I, II and III. This protein is the main target for the development of a dengue vaccine with induction of neutralizing antibodies. In the present work, we tested two different vaccination strategies, with combined immunizations in a prime/booster regimen or simultaneous inoculation with a DNA vaccine (pE1D2) and a chimeric yellow fever/dengue 2 virus (YF17D-D2). The pE1D2 DNA vaccine encodes the ectodomain of the envelope DENV2 protein fused to t-PA signal peptide, while the YF17D-D2 was constructed by replacing the prM and E genes from the 17D yellow fever vaccine virus by those from DENV2. Balb/c mice were inoculated with these two vaccines by different prime/booster or simultaneous immunization protocols and most of them induced a synergistic effect on the elicited immune response, mainly in neutralizing antibody production. Furthermore, combined immunization remarkably increased protection against a lethal dose of DENV2, when compared to each vaccine administered alone. Results also revealed that immunization with the DNA vaccine, regardless of the combination with the chimeric virus, induced a robust cell immune response, with production of IFN-γ by CD8+ T lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2094813899,"The type I interferon (IFN) family comprises 15 cytokines (in human 13α, 1β, 1ω), which exert several cellular functions through binding to a common receptor. Despite initial activation of the same Jak/Stat signalling pathway, the cellular response may differ depending on type I IFN subtype. We investigated the activity of six type I IFN subtypes - IFNα1, α2, α8, α21, ω and β- to promote the differentiation of dendritic cells (DC). Transcriptome analyses identified two distinct groups, the IFNα/ω-DC and the IFNβ-DC. In addition, the expression level of seven chemokines and several cell surface markers characteristic of DC distinguished IFNα-DC and IFNβ-DC. These differences are unlikely to impact the efficacy of T cell functional response since IFNα2-DC and IFNβ-DC were equipotent in inducing the proliferation and the polarization of allogenic naïve CD4 T cells into Th1 cells and in stimulating autologous antigen specific CD4 or CD8 T cells. Of the functional parameters analysed, the only one that showed a modest differential was the phagocytic uptake of dead cells which was higher for IFNα2-DC."
https://openalex.org/W2089797986,"ASPP2 is a key protein in regulating apoptosis both in p53-dependent and-independent pathways. The C-terminal part of ASPP2 contains four ankyrin repeats and an SH3 domain (Ank-SH3) that mediate the interactions of ASPP2 with apoptosis related proteins such as p53, Bcl-2 and the p65 subunit of NFκB. p53 core domain (p53CD) binds the n-src loop and the RT loop of ASPP2 SH3. ASPP2 contains a disordered proline rich domain (ASPP2 Pro) that forms an intramolecular autoinhibitory interaction with the Ank-SH3 domains. Here we show how this intramolecular interaction affects the intermolecular interactions of ASPP2 with p53, Bcl-2 and NFkB. We used biophysical methods to obtain better understanding of the relationship between ASPP2 and its partners for getting a comprehensive view on ASPP2 pathways. Fluorescence anisotropy competition experiments revealed that both ASPP2 Pro and p53CD competed for binding the n-src loop of the ASPP2 SH3, indicating regulation of p53CD binding to this loop by ASPP2 Pro. Peptides derived from the ASPP2-binding interface of Bcl-2 did not compete with p53CD or NFkB peptides for binding the ASPP2 n-src loop. However, p53CD displaced the NFκB peptide (residues 303-332) from its complex with ASPP2 Ank-SH3, indicating that NFκB 303-332 and p53CD bind a partly overlapping site in ASPP2 SH3, mostly in the RT loop. These results are in agreement with previous docking studies, which showed that ASPP2 Ank-SH3 binds Bcl-2 and NFκB mostly via distinct sites from p53. However they show some overlap between the binding sites of p53CD and NFkB in ASPP2 Ank-SH3. Our results provide experimental evidence that the intramolecular interaction in ASPP2 regulates its binding to p53CD and that ASPP2 Ank-SH3 binds Bcl-2 and NFκB via distinct sites."
https://openalex.org/W2013858971,"Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus are the vectors of dengue, the most important arboviral disease of humans. To date, Aedes ecology studies have assumed that the vectors are truly absent from sites where they are not detected; since no perfect detection method exists, this assumption is questionable. Imperfect detection may bias estimates of key vector surveillance/control parameters, including site-occupancy (infestation) rates and control intervention effects. We used a modeling approach that explicitly accounts for imperfect detection and a 38-month, 55-site detection/non-detection dataset to quantify the effects of municipality/state control interventions on Aedes site-occupancy dynamics, considering meteorological and dwelling-level covariates. Ae. aegypti site-occupancy estimates (mean 0.91; range 0.79–0.97) were much higher than reported by routine surveillance based on ‘rapid larval surveys’ (0.03; 0.02–0.11) and moderately higher than directly ascertained with oviposition traps (0.68; 0.50–0.91). Regular control campaigns based on breeding-site elimination had no measurable effects on the probabilities of dwelling infestation by dengue vectors. Site-occupancy fluctuated seasonally, mainly due to the negative effects of high maximum (Ae. aegypti) and minimum (Ae. albopictus) summer temperatures (June-September). Rainfall and dwelling-level covariates were poor predictors of occupancy. The marked contrast between our estimates of adult vector presence and the results from ‘rapid larval surveys’ suggests, together with the lack of effect of local control campaigns on infestation, that many Aedes breeding sites were overlooked by vector control agents in our study setting. Better sampling strategies are urgently needed, particularly for the reliable assessment of infestation rates in the context of control program management. The approach we present here, combining oviposition traps and site-occupancy models, could greatly contribute to that crucial aim."
https://openalex.org/W2024380645,"Causes of phenotypic variation are fundamental to evolutionary ecology because they influence the traits acted upon by natural selection. One such cause of phenotypic variation is a maternal effect, which is the influence of the environment experienced by a female (and her corresponding phenotype) on the phenotype of her offspring (independent of the offspring’s genotype). While maternal effects are well documented, the longevity and fitness impact of these effects remains unclear because it is difficult to follow free-living individuals through their reproductive lifetimes. For long-lived species, it has been suggested that maternal effects are masked by environmental variables acting on offspring in years following the period of dependence. Our objective was to use indirect measures of maternal condition to determine if maternal effects have long-lasting influences on male offspring in two species of cervid. Because antlers are sexually selected, we used measures of antler size at time of death, 1.5–21.5 years after gestation to investigate maternal effects. We quantified antler size of 11,000 male elk and mule deer born throughout the intermountain western US (6 states) over nearly 30 years. Maternal condition during development was estimated indirectly using a suite of abiotic variables known to influence condition of cervids (i.e., winter severity, spring and summer temperature, and spring and summer precipitation). Antler size of male cervids was significantly associated with our indirect measure of maternal condition during gestation and lactation. Assuming the correctness of our indirect measure, our findings demonstrate that antler size is a sexually selected trait that is influenced–into adulthood–by maternal condition. This link emphasizes the importance of considering inherited environmental effects when interpreting population dynamics or examining reproductive success of long-lived organisms."

Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9) a receptor for CpG DNA is involved in activation of immune cells in renal disease and may contribute to chronic inflammatory disease progression through an interleukin-6 (IL-6) dependent pathway. Previous studies indicate that -1237T/C confers regulatory effects on TLR-9 transcription. To date the effect of TLR-9 polymorphisms on ESRD remains unknown. We performed a case-control study and genotyped 630 ESRD patients and 415 controls for -1237T/C, -1486T/C and 1635G/A by real-time PCR assays and assessed plasma concentration of IL-6 by ELISA. Haplotype association analysis was performed using the Haploview package. A luciferase reporter assay and real-time PCR were used to test the function of the -1237T/C promoter polymorphism. A significant association between -1237T/C in TLR-9 and ESRD was identified. The TCA, TTA and CCA haplotype of TLR-9 were associated with ESRD. ESRD patients carrying -1237TC had a higher mean plasma IL-6 level when compared with -1237TT. The TLR-9 transcriptional activity of the variant -1237CC allele is higher than the -1237TT allele. The results indicate that in a Han Chinese population the presence of the C allele of -1237T/C in the TLR-9 gene increases susceptibility towards development of ESRD. In vitro studies demonstrate that -1237T/C may be involved in the development of ESRD through transcriptional modulation of TLR-9."
https://openalex.org/W2053307284,"We have previously proven that the interspecies incompatibility of CD47 is responsible for in vitro phagocytosis of xenogeneic cells by host macrophages. Utilizing an in vivo model in the present study, we investigated whether genetically engineered expression of mouse CD47 in rat insulinoma cells (INS-1E) could inhibit macrophage-mediated xenograft rejection. INS-1E cells transfected with the pRc/CMV-mouse CD47 vector (mCD47-INS-1E) induced SIRPα-tyrosine phosphorylation in mouse macrophages in vitro, whereas cells transfected with the control vector (cont-INS-1E) did not. When these cells were injected into the peritoneal cavity of streptozotocin-induced diabetic Rag2−/−γ chain −/− mice, which lack T, B, and NK cells, the expression of mouse CD47 on the INS-1E cells markedly reduced the susceptibility of these cells to phagocytosis by macrophages. Moreover, these mice became normoglycemic after receiving mCD47-INS-1E, whereas the mice that received cont-INS-1E failed to achieve normoglycemia. Furthermore, injection of an anti-mouse SIRPα blocking monoclonal antibody into the mouse recipients of mCD47-INS-1E cells prevented achievement of normoglycemia. These results demonstrate that interspecies incompatibility of CD47 significantly contributes to in vivo rejection of xenogeneic cells by macrophages. Thus, genetic induction of the expression of recipient CD47 on xenogeneic donor cells could provide inhibitory signals to recipient macrophages via SIPRα; this constitutes a novel approach for preventing macrophage-mediated xenograft rejection."

Contributors to the risk of anemia in HF include hemodilution, renal dysfunction and inflammation. Hemoglobin levels may also be negatively affected by alterations in stress regulatory systems. Therefore, psychological distress characterized by such alterations may adversely affect hemoglobin in HF.

Aim To examine the relationship between Type D personality and affective symptomatology with hemoglobin levels at inclusion and 12-month follow-up, controlling for relevant clinical factors. Methods Plasma levels of hemoglobin and creatinine were assessed in 264 HF patients at inclusion and at 12-month follow-up. Type D personality and affective symptomatology were assessed at inclusion. Results At inclusion, hemoglobin levels were similar for Type D and non-Type D HF patients (p = .23), and were moderately associated with affective symptomatology (r = –.14, p = .02). Multivariable regression showed that Type D personality (β = –.15; p = .02), was independently associated with future hemoglobin levels, while controlling for renal dysfunction, gender, NYHA class, time since diagnosis, BMI, the use of angiotensin-related medication, and levels of affective symptomatology. Change in renal function was associated with Type D personality (β = .20) and hemoglobin at 12 months (β = –.25). Sobel mediation analysis showed significant partial mediation of the Type D – hemoglobin association by renal function deterioration (p = .01). Anemia prevalence increased over time, especially in Type D patients. Female gender, poorer baseline renal function, deterioration of renal function and a longer HF history predicted the observed increase in anemia prevalence over time, while higher baseline hemoglobin was protective. Conclusion Type D personality, but not affective symptomatology, was associated with reduced future hemoglobin levels, independent of clinical factors. The relation between Type D personality and future hemoglobin levels was mediated by renal function deterioration."

All but the 100-mg bid dosage significantly increased total lymphocytes and naive B cells, memory B cells, and T cells in peripheral blood compared with placebo, and the dose-response relationship was shown to be linear. Marked increases were also observed in natural killer cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells, but only with the 500-mg bid and 1000-mg bid dosages. There were no significant changes in monocytes. The number of samples for regulator and inflammatory T cells was too small to draw any definitive conclusions.CDP323 at daily doses of 1000 or 2000 mg induced significant increases in total lymphocyte count and suppressed VCAM-1 binding by reducing unbound very late antigen-4 expression on lymphocytes.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00726648."

This position paper lays out the arguments for, and discusses the arrangements in which, a modest payment might be ethically justifiable. The nature of compensation for women who donate eggs (oocytes) for research remains a contentious issue internationally. This position paper lays out the arguments for, and discusses the arrangements in which, a modest payment might be ethically justifiable. In 2006, the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) published Guidelines for the Conduct of Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research. The task force grappled with the issue of financial consideration for eggs (oocytes) used in such research, finally recommending that local stem cell research and ethics review committees, where allowed by law, might determine the nature of compensation, ensuring that it does not constitute an undue inducement (Daley et al., 2007Daley G.Q. Ahrlund Richter L. Auerbach J.M. Benvenisty N. Charo R.A. Chen G. Deng H.-K. Goldstein L.S. Hudson K.L. Hyun I. et al.Science. 2007; 315: 603-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). At the 2009 ISSCR Annual Meeting in Barcelona, the Ethics and Public Policy Committee of the ISSCR hosted a debate on the ethics of payments (in cash or kind) to egg providers. This Position Paper is the culmination of the Committee’s discussions over the subsequent 36 months. In this document, the Committee formulates a view on the ethical acceptability, under certain specified and regulated conditions, of payments (in cash or in kind) to women providing eggs for stem cell research. The Committee’s view is that stem cell researchers should act to ensure that human eggs for research are sourced ethically. There is an escalation in demand and a worldwide market for human eggs. Eggs are procured and provided in a number of combinations of circumstances: the purpose might be for research and/or for treatment, the providers might be IVF patients or women in the community (“non-IVF patients”), or there might be varied arrangements of exchange (for cash or for payment in kind or for no tangible return). Each of these circumstances raises major conceptual, ethical, and socioeconomic questions, many of which have been extensively debated elsewhere. We do not engage directly or in detail with those debates, though we acknowledge their importance in providing a springboard for our discussions. Instead we lay out the progression of our argument through consideration of various stages of the debate. The stages we cover are as follows: (1) current arrangements for providing eggs for research in exchange for payment; (2) arguments identifying the scientific need for human eggs for research; (3) whether there are ways of avoiding the use of human eggs in research; (4) the need to recognize the contributions made by women providing eggs for research; (5) a consideration of the arguments against giving payments to those providing eggs; (6) systematic responses to those concerns; (7) our conclusions. Such a style, while affording brevity and clarity, does not allow for a nuanced discussion; however, the details of each position can be found in the literature cited and in the other publications of the authors listed here. Clearly the terminology in this field is highly contestable and any particular choice of terms shifts the grounds of the debate in certain directions. Therefore, in Section 1 we clarify our use of key terms, to ensure consistency with the position that we advocate here, rather than attempt to provide an uncontested lexicon. There are three broad sets of arrangements under which women currently provide eggs for stem cell research in exchange for payment, in cash or kind, beyond reimbursement for actual expenses incurred:1.The first is where women who are undergoing fertility treatment can provide a proportion of their eggs for research in exchange for reduced IVF fees; a scheme established in the UK refers to this as “egg sharing” (Choudhary et al., 2012Choudhary M. Nesbitt M. Burgess L. Hyslop L. Herbert M. Murdoch A. Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 239-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar; Haimes et al., 2012Haimes E. Taylor K. Turkmendag I. Sociol. Health Illn. 2012; 34: 1199-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).2.The second arrangement is where women who are not undergoing fertility treatment are encouraged to provide eggs for research. Women are compensated for the time and inconvenience associated with donation, their willingness to accept some risk, and out-of-pocket expenses. In other words, the compensation is not for the eggs, but rather for undergoing the processes involved in providing those eggs. This is legally permitted in some parts of the USA (though state laws are variable and in some cases unclear). In 2009, New York State’s stem cell board voted to permit its funded researchers to give compensation, beyond direct expenses, to women who provide their eggs directly and solely to research. The board argued that compensation of amounts up to $5,000 was reasonable, amounts between $5,000 and $10,000 required sufficient justification, and amounts over $10,000 were prohibited. The deliberations behind this decision, and the procedural mechanisms required by the State to protect the rights and welfare of egg providers, are laid out in Roxland, 2012Roxland B.E. Regen. Med. 2012; 7: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar. In the UK in 2011 the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority (HFEA) conducted a review of their gamete donation policies and raised the existing one-off payment from £250 to £750, to both cover expenses and loss of earnings to women providing eggs for treatment or research and to continue the egg sharing scheme (http://www.hfea.gov.uk/6700.html). One month before the HFEA announcement the UK-based Nuffield Council on Bioethics had suggested introducing a pilot scheme offering payment to women providing eggs for research (Nuffield Council on Bioethics, 2011Nuffield Council on BioethicsHuman Bodies: Donation for Medicine and Research. Nuffield Council on Bioethics, London2011Google Scholar). Compensation beyond out-of-pocket expenses is not permitted in many other countries, such as Australia and most European countries.3.The third arrangement might be called “egg selling,” wherein a specific price is paid for each egg or batch of eggs. This paper does not cover these arrangements because we regard them as ethically distinguishable from egg sharing and from compensation for the donation process. Commercial transactions involving a substantial payment or reward for eggs are ethically highly controversial. In the UK, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, 2011Nuffield Council on BioethicsHuman Bodies: Donation for Medicine and Research. Nuffield Council on Bioethics, London2011Google Scholar rejected arrangements involving the sale and purchase of eggs while advocating the pilot scheme mentioned in point 2 above; this suggests that they also distinguish between compensation for providing eggs and egg selling. The focus of this paper is to discuss those arrangements in which a modest payment, where efforts are made to avoid undue inducements (in cash or kind), might be ethically justifiable. For example, the HFEA payment of £750 was set at a level to avoid “attracting those who are merely financially motivated.” It is argued that human eggs are needed for stem cell research in a number of areas to improve somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) techniques, to thereby advance SCNT applications, to better understand early human development, and to assist stem cell research more widely. There is also competition for eggs for research on preventing mitochondrial diseases, improving fertility treatment, and assisting recognition of, and thereby avoiding, fetal abnormalities. The use of eggs in stem cell research involves either direct research on and with eggs or the creation of embryos; those embryos might then be used to derive stem cell lines. As early as 2005 stem cell researchers identified the need for fresh, healthy eggs rather than eggs that had failed to fertilize (Stojkovic et al., 2005Stojkovic M. Stojkovic P. Leary C. Hall V.J. Armstrong L. Herbert M. Nesbitt M. Lako M. Murdoch A. Reprod. Biomed. Online. 2005; 11: 226-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are, therefore, various circumstances where scientific objectives rely on the creation of human embryos from eggs provided for research. However, stem cell researchers continue to note the shortage of human eggs for research (Noggle et al., 2011Noggle S. Fung H.-L. Gore A. Martinez H. Satriani K.C. Prosser R. Oum K. Paull D. Druckenmiller S. Freeby M. et al.Nature. 2011; 478: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Assuming that human embryonic stem cell research, and research into infertility and mitochondrial disease, is thought desirable, it is clear that there is a shortage of human eggs for use in research and that many more eggs will be needed. It might be argued that other routes can be followed to achieve the same knowledge and therapeutic potentials identified above, obviating the need for research on eggs and thus for women to provide their eggs for stem cell research. However, a brief review of the main arguments suggests that this is not the case.1.The derivation of human embryonic stem cell lines can be achieved using human embryos in excess of reproductive need from fertility programs. However, this does not provide the genetic compatibility offered by using SCNT embryos; also there are considerable ethical challenges in using excess embryos from reproductive programs (Haimes and Taylor, 2009Haimes E. Taylor K. Hum. Reprod. 2009; 24: 2142-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, Haimes and Taylor, 2011aHaimes E. Taylor K. Bioethics. 2011; 25: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).2.The need for SCNT and embryo-derived human pluripotent stem cells has been questioned in light of the development of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), especially for the purpose of disease modeling or cell replacement. However, studies are highlighting the epigenetic differences between SCNT-derived embryonic stem cells and iPSCs, as well as genetic changes in iPSC lines, leading to concerns about the generation of abnormalities in iPSCs (Gore et al., 2011Gore A. Li Z. Fung H.-L. Young J.E. Agarwal S. Antosiewicz-Bourget J. Canto I. Giorgetti A. Israel M.A. Kiskinis E. et al.Nature. 2011; 471: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar; Hussein et al., 2011Hussein S.M. Batada N.N. Vuoristo S. Ching R.W. Autio R. Närvä E. Ng S. Sourour M. Hämäläinen R. Olsson C. et al.Nature. 2011; 471: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar; Kim et al., 2010Kim K. Doi A. Wen B. Ng K. Zhao R. Cahan P. Kim J. Aryee M.J. Ji H. Ehrlich L.I.R. et al.Nature. 2010; 467: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). While these findings are unlikely to detract from the critical role of iPSCs in disease modeling, caution will be needed in their application to cellular replacement approaches. A strong consensus exists in the scientific community that research on SCNT-derived stem cells should continue while the full potential and safety implications of iPSCs and direct reprogramming are being explored.3.In the UK it was argued during parliamentary debates on the 2008 Human Fertilization and Embryology Act that creating admixed human embryos (human-animal embryos) using eggs from cows would avoid the need to ask women to provide human eggs for research. However, no research of that kind has been published so this does not appear to be a viable alternative to using human eggs, despite the regulation being in place to allow it.4.Immune “matched” stem cells for research might be gained by forming an embryo from human gamete(s) derived only from one person (without using SCNT). However, this procedure has so far only been successfully carried out by parthenogenesis using human eggs, thus not obviating the need for eggs to be provided (Kim et al., 2007Kim K. Ng K. Rugg-Gunn P.J. Shieh J.-H. Kirak O. Jaenisch R. Wakayama T. Moore M.A. Pedersen R.A. Daley G.Q. Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 346-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar; Revazova et al., 2007Revazova E.S. Turovets N.A. Kochetkova O.D. Kindarova L.B. Kuzmichev L.N. Janus J.D. Pryzhkova M.V. Cloning Stem Cells. 2007; 9: 432-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The in vitro creation of human gametes for use in fertilization, SCNT, or other ways to derive human embryonic stem cell lines raises its own ethical issues and for some might be more contentious than SCNT; even people who accept SCNT might object to the formation of embryos in this way. This suggests that stem cell research using human eggs is scientifically justified, despite or alongside other research being conducted on other techniques. It has been argued that women’s labor in providing eggs for research, and the risks that this might entail, have gone unrecognized (Waldby, 2008Waldby C. New Genet. Soc. 2008; 27: 19-31Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The process of providing eggs is arduous, potentially physically risky, and time consuming. Women have to undergo a precise, self-administered drug regime to stimulate their ovaries; this process is risky because hyperstimulation can occur, the long term effects of ovarian stimulation are unknown, and the process of egg retrieval can be very painful. Throughout the process women have to organize their daily lives to ensure that the medication is administered at the correct intervals and they have to attend a series of hospital appointments to monitor their progress. This section identifies additional burdens for different groups of women who might provide eggs for research. It has been argued that women undergoing IVF do not encounter additional dangers when providing eggs for research because their treatment necessarily entails all the above labor and risks. However, findings from a UK study of the donation of fresh embryos for human embryonic stem cell research revealed useful insights into IVF patients’ views about the use of their eggs in research. These patients regarded their eggs as a key resource for achieving a pregnancy so success in producing a good number of eggs during treatment was regarded as the first step toward getting pregnant. Therefore, while the use of eggs in research is less morally contentious than embryos, eggs are seen as being extremely precious. Giving away any of those eggs to research is seen as putting their chances of pregnancy at risk; this might explain why a scheme asking women to provide two eggs to research, without compensation, if 12 or more eggs were produced was not very successful and was replaced by an egg sharing scheme (see Section 1(1)). Most of the IVF women interviewed would prefer not to provide eggs to SCNT research until they had achieved a pregnancy, even though the research itself was regarded as important (Haimes and Taylor, 2009Haimes E. Taylor K. Hum. Reprod. 2009; 24: 2142-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This suggests that even women not encountering additional physical risks (to those faced in routine IVF treatment) to give their eggs should still be compensated for the potential risks to their chances of pregnancy. A study of the egg providers’ experiences of the UK egg sharing scheme, in which IVF patients provide 50% of their eggs in one cycle (if six or more eggs are produced) suggests that these women are prepared to risk their chances of pregnancy in one cycle only because the compensation provided means that they can afford an additional cycle of IVF, thereby giving them an additional chance of success (Haimes et al., 2012Haimes E. Taylor K. Turkmendag I. Sociol. Health Illn. 2012; 34: 1199-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Women not undergoing IVF treatment will lose time from work or other responsibilities and will experience major disruption of their daily lives. These alone are enough to justify some sort of compensation; the physical risks encountered reinforce this claim (Nuffield Council on Bioethics, 2011Nuffield Council on BioethicsHuman Bodies: Donation for Medicine and Research. Nuffield Council on Bioethics, London2011Google Scholar). The Chair of the UK’s HFEA argued that the increase in 2011 in compensation for egg donors (see Section 1) was a “fair reflection of the effort, the time, and the pain” involved in providing eggs (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15356148). Anecdotal evidence indicates that many women not undergoing IVF treatment are willing to provide eggs for research, but most do not proceed when they are told more about the time involved and the invasiveness of egg collection (Skene, 2010Skene L. Indiana Journal of Global Studies. 2010; 17: 211-244Crossref Google Scholar), a view confirmed by Egli et al., 2011Egli D. Chen A.E. Saphier G. Powers D. Alper M. Katz K. Berger B. Goland R. Leibel R.L. Melton D.A. Eggan K. Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 9: 293-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar. We now briefly outline the ethical concerns commonly raised about compensating women for providing eggs for stem cell research. In the next section, we proffer counterarguments to these concerns. 1.It is argued that offering a reward for providing eggs might compromise women’s autonomy, especially if recruitment starts early in the fertility treatment process. This is thought to inhibit women’s ability to make a free choice (give informed consent) because they may discount or overlook the potential risks and burdens through their desire to have a child and therefore access more affordable treatment (Hyun, 2006Hyun I. Nature. 2006; 442: 629-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar; Skene, 2009Skene L. Monash Bioethics Review. 2009; 28: 28.1-28.8Google Scholar).2.It is also argued that poorer women might be vulnerable to exploitation because they might give up much-wanted eggs in order to access treatment they cannot otherwise afford.3.There might be a conflict of interest for IVF practitioners if they advocate compensation for patients providing eggs because this could be seen as encouraging provision and therefore promoting the practitioner’s broader research interests over the interests of their patients (particularly if points 1 and 2 above are thought to hold sway).4.It has been argued that resources that are available for fertility treatment should not be allocated to nonfertility research. Under the principle of “just participant selection” (Ballantyne and de Lacey, 2008Ballantyne A. de Lacey S. Int. J. Fem. Approaches Bioeth. 2008; 1: 145-164Crossref Google Scholar), eggs obtained for research into fertility should be obtained only from women in fertility programs and their eggs should be used only for such research. Eggs for other types of research, such as drug development, should be obtained only from volunteers with a family interest in the medical condition for which the drug is being developed. Therefore it might be argued that compensation for providing eggs might encourage this “diversion” of eggs from fertility research toward nonfertility research. 1.Where women are not undertaking fertility treatment, it is argued, on the same grounds of autonomy and informed consent, that it is inappropriate to encourage them (through the offer of reward) to take significant risks (such as the possibility of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and the long-term effects of any form of stimulation) solely for the purpose of research. 1.There might be exploitation of impoverished women if there are economic inequalities either within a country or across national borders (Widdows, 2009Widdows H. Int. J. Fem. Approaches Bioeth. 2009; 2: 5-24Crossref Google Scholar). Such exploitation might occur either through the “cross-border trade” in eggs or through the movement of scientists to exploit regulatory conditions more favorable to their research (Haimes and Taylor, 2011bHaimes E. Taylor K. Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 613-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). There is a concern that practices in egg provision and procurement might affect broader values in other areas of research.1.One concern is that eggs might be commodified by this practice and that this might set a precedent for the commodification of other body parts. It is argued that the best scheme for the provision of eggs and other bodily material for research is an altruistic system of donation.2.Another concern is that compensating women for providing eggs could create an unfortunate precedent in countries where payment for blood, tissues, and organs is the exception (Isasi and Knoppers, 2007Isasi R.M. Knoppers B.M. Stem Cell Res. (Amst.). 2007; 1: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar; Nuffield Council on Bioethics, 2011Nuffield Council on BioethicsHuman Bodies: Donation for Medicine and Research. Nuffield Council on Bioethics, London2011Google Scholar), thereby undermining long-established and widely accepted systems of nonremunerative donation practices.3.Rewarding women who provide eggs for research diminishes the moral value of altruistic donation. It might deter women who would donate their eggs altruistically but not provide eggs for reward. We acknowledge the importance of these concerns and make the following responses. 1.Offering women in fertility treatment programs a reward for providing some of their eggs for research is ethically justifiable to compensate them for their willingness to accept added anxiety and some risk of reduced chances of pregnancy (see Section 4(1)).2.This is not a payment for the eggs themselves; women will be entitled to the compensation even if no eggs are collected or the eggs collected are not suitable for the research. (However, IVF patients would not be entitled to compensation if they changed their minds about providing eggs for research and decide to keep all their eggs for their own treatment, since this means that their chances of success in achieving a pregnancy will not, after all, have been compromised by the research [see point 1 above]. This is the agreement in the HFEA-licensed egg sharing scheme in the UK).3.Women’s autonomy will not be compromised if researchers take proper care to ensure that women are fully informed. Consent processes are not always ideal but every effort should be made to ensure the consent process is optimized for the local community and that the entire egg donation process, including the risks, is adequately considered. Competent adult women can decide for themselves whether to provide their eggs for research, as long as they are properly informed (Haimes et al., 2012Haimes E. Taylor K. Turkmendag I. Sociol. Health Illn. 2012; 34: 1199-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recruitment systems can also be designed to avoid pressure on women to provide their eggs for research, such as a scheme that is based on women taking the initiative to come forward to provide eggs (as in the UK egg sharing scheme), rather than being put in the position of having to respond to direct requests for eggs from clinicians supervising their IVF treatment.4.With regard to other equity issues, it is true that reward may be more attractive for women of limited means than for wealthy women. However, the objection that this makes the reward inequitable, and may lead poorer women to take more risks, may be met by noting that some of these women will not be able to get fertility treatment without a scheme of this kind. As long as their choice is free and informed, and as long as the terms are fair, compensation schemes can actually increase access to such treatment for women whose economic conditions would otherwise disallow it (Haimes et al., 2012Haimes E. Taylor K. Turkmendag I. Sociol. Health Illn. 2012; 34: 1199-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It is unrealistic and unfair to require them to wait for state funding schemes for fertility treatment to be changed. Nonetheless, policy debates on how to facilitate wider access to fertility treatment should continue.5.Potential conflicts of interest for practitioners in fertility treatment (who might want to treat women successfully but also participate in research) could be minimized by applying the “principle of separation.” This is an arrangement in which those who recruit tissue providers, and/or inform them of the research risks and benefits, are separate from the personnel who have the role of caring for women in treatment programs.6.The question of “just participant selection” in the area of egg provision for research (whether or not for reward) raises the wider question of who makes, or should make, the decision about the appropriate use of eggs. Ongoing studies are investigating egg providers’ preferences for the possible research uses of their eggs and we regard these studies as a vital component in this debate. If most women who provide eggs for research want those eggs to be used only in research on infertility, those wishes should inform the development of future policies on the provision of eggs for research. 1.Women who are not receiving IVF treatment are being compensated for undergoing the procedures involved, rather than for the eggs themselves. As with women undergoing IVF, they will receive strong ethical protection against exposure to reduced autonomy, undue risks, and exploitation by robust procedures ensuring voluntary participation, fully informed consent, and rigorous ethical oversight. Competent adult women will be able to decide for themselves if they wish to provide eggs under such conditions.2.Other healthy people who participate in medical research, including sperm donors, commonly receive some payment and it is inconsistent to exclude egg provision from this established compensation system. 1.It is presumptuous to assume that poorer women are not able to make their own decisions about whether they wish to take health risks in exchange for reward. Some women may have limited life opportunities available to them because of background injustices affecting their lives, but that does not preclude them from making a rational and informed decision about which opportunities are preferable.2.However, it is the proper role of ethics and law to protect groups and individuals in situations in which they might become vulnerable. The suggestions, in points 3–6 below and in the Conclusions, for monitoring the effective functioning of protective measures must be taken seriously by all parties concerned and be subject to regular review and investigation (Isasi and Knoppers, 2007Isasi R.M. Knoppers B.M. Stem Cell Res. (Amst.). 2007; 1: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).3.Possible exploitation of other vulnerable women can be addressed by the requirement of oversight of all research involving the use of human eggs by independent ethics committees. This should include, as a minimum requirement, periodic monitoring to identify any disparate level of contribution by women who are vulnerable for any reasons within areas of traditional concern about voluntariness, such as poverty, race, or mental condition.4.Concerns about research tourism and the welfare of women in impoverished countries can be met by requiring researchers and ethics committees to follow robust and internationally accepted principles of ethics in the receipt and brokerage of tissue to be used in research. Again, ongoing monitoring should alert both researchers and ethics committees to possible abuse.5.Researchers who import human eggs for use in research should be required, as part of the procedure for obtaining ethical approval for their project in their own country, to ensure that imported eggs are obtained by a process that would meet the ethical requirements within their own country.6.To reduce the risk that some countries might have lower ethical requirements in dealings with their own citizens, international ethics bodies could be encouraged to stimulate discussion in other countries about the issues identified here. 1.Unlike the practice of “egg selling,” the compensations envisioned in this report do not constitute a “commodification” of eggs (Caulfield and Ogbogu, 2012Caulfield T. Ogbogu U. EMBO Rep. 2012; 13: 12-16Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar); they are not a payment for the eggs themselves (for example, the UK egg sharing scheme is not based on a price per egg). The suggestion is that compensation should be paid for participating in the whole process, so that women will be entitled to receive the reward whether or not eggs are produced or suitable for research.2.Compensation for providing eggs need not be a precedent for procurement of blood, tissue, and organs for research. Peripheral blood may be donated for research but this is a minor procedure with few risks, so it is appropriate that it should be uncompensated, if that is the norm in any particular country. The same is arguably true of other tissue that may be donated by a living person for research. However, solid organs like kidneys cannot lawfully be removed from a living person for research (only for treatment), so there is no question of anyone being paid for providing a solid organ for research.3.The moral value of altruistic donation need not be undermined by compensating some women who provide eggs for research. Altruistic donation could be maintained for women who do not wish to receive anything for donating eggs or other tissue (Isasi and Knoppers, 2007Isasi R.M. Knoppers B.M. Stem Cell Res. (Amst.). 2007; 1: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar; Nuffield Council on Bioethics, 2011Nuffield Council on BioethicsHuman Bodies: Donation for Medicine and Research. Nuffield Council on Bioethics, London2011Google Scholar). It is evident from the above that the research demand for eggs is part of a larger global market for human tissue. Anything that is said about eggs therefore has the potential to impact on wider debates about the provision and procurement of other tissue and organs for research and also on debates about the therapeutic uses of human tissue. However, those debates, while overlapping, also have their distinctive considerations and it would be irresponsible to make too glib a crossover from one area to another. Therefore, while acknowledging that potential for overlap, we confine our comments here to reiterating our views on the role of payments in egg provision for stem cell research."
https://openalex.org/W2160228479,"Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have the potential to differentiate into germ cells (GCs) in vivo and in vitro. Interestingly, XY ESCs can give rise to both male and female GCs in culture, irrespective of the genetic sex. Recent studies showed that ESC-derived primordial GCs contributed to functional gametogenesis in vivo; however, in vitro differentiation techniques have never succeeded in generating mature oocytes from ESCs due to cryptogenic growth arrest during the preantral follicle stages of development. To address this issue, a mouse ESC line, capable of producing follicle-like structures (FLSs) efficiently, was established to investigate their properties using conventional molecular biological methods. The results revealed that the ESC-derived FLSs were morphologically similar to ovarian primary-to-secondary follicles but never formed an antrum; instead, the FLSs eventually underwent abnormal development or cell death in culture, or formed teratomas when transplanted under the kidney capsule in mice. Gene expression analyses demonstrated that the FLSs lacked transcripts for genes essential to late folliculogenesis, including gonadotropin receptors and steroidogenic enzymes, whereas some other genes were overexpressed in FLSs compared to the adult ovary. The E-Cadherin protein, which is involved in cell-to-cell interactions, was also expressed ectopically. Remarkably, it was seen that oocyte-like cells in the FLSs exhibited androgenetic genomic imprinting, which is ordinarily indicative of male GCs. Although the FLSs did not express male GC marker genes, the DNA methyltransferase, Dnmt3L, was expressed at an abnormally high level. Furthermore, the expression of sex determination factors was ambiguous in FLSs as both male and female determinants were expressed weakly. These data suggest that the developmental dysfunction of the ESC-derived FLSs may be attributable to aberrant gene expression and genomic imprinting, possibly associated with uncertain sex determination in culture."
