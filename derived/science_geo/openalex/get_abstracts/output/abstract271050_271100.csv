https://openalex.org/W1980177068,A comparison of western Aleutian Islands with and without sea otter populations shows that this species is important in determining littoral and sublittoral community structure. Sea otters control herbivorous invertebrate populations. Removal of sea otters causes increased herbivory and ultimately results in the destruction of macrophyte associations. The observations suggest that sea otter reestablishment indirectly affects island fauna associated with macrophyte primary productivity.

Either annual cacao productivity or area in cultivation of the crop predicts the number of associated insect pest species, when the world's cacao-producing regions are compared. Analysis of covariance does not discriminate different species-area regressions for native as opposed to nonnative cacao-producing regions; the numbers of insect pest species per unit area of cacao in regions of long-standing cultivation do not exceed the numbers in regions of recent introduction. This demonstrates that the number of cacao insect pest species rises rapidly to an asymptote set by the area in cultivation in each region."

Acid solutions of synthetic or biologic origin remove octahedral ions, leaving a fragile matrix of amorphous material."
https://openalex.org/W2047475610,"A preliminary evaluation of the thermal history of the upper mantle as determined by petrologic techniques indicates a general correspondence with theoretically derived models. The petrologic data supply direct information which may be used as an independent calibration of calculated models, serve as a base for evaluating the assumptions of the theoretical approach, and allow more careful selection of the variables describing mantle thermal properties and processes."
https://openalex.org/W1649873100,"Diphenamid, a herbicide, is metabolized to N-methyl 2,2-diphenylacetamide and 2,2-diphenylacetamide by the common soil fungi Trichoderma viride and Aspergillus candidus within 48 hours. The two metabolites are more toxic than diphenamid to both tomato and barnyard-grass seedlings under sterile conditions. This finding indicates that the phytotoxic moiety is not diphenamid but one of its metabolitesâ€”probably the N-methyl derivative."
https://openalex.org/W1997887612,Analyses of the stable isotopes of the organic carbon and microscopic examination of the sediment particles suggest that up to 90 percent of the organic matter in Ross Sea sediments is derived from the igneous and ancient metamorphic and sedimentary rocks that are being glacially eroded on the Antarctic continent and transported seaward.
https://openalex.org/W1997029098,"Aggregates of fine, curved fibrils extend from the rhizoplane of soil-grown wheat roots into the rhizosphere. The fibril diameter is usually between 3 and 10 nanometers. The fibrils arise as extracellular products of the root, and some aggregates are intimately associated with microbial cells and soil particles."
https://openalex.org/W2049077887,"Optical spectroscopy of stellar molecules trapped at 4 degrees K is particularly valuable when the data can be used to complement the corresponding gas data. The ground state is then directly established by measurement of the absorption spectrum at the low temperature, since all transitions beginning from excited states are eliminated. Isotopic substitution establishes the (0,0) bands of transitions to excited electronic states, and when these data are combined with infrared and fluorescence measurements at 4 degrees K, most of the vibrational properties of the ground and excited states can be obtained. Of the many examples cited and discussed here, C(3) is perhaps the most outstanding. Because the various molecules trapped in matrices are usually identified through prior mass spectrometric work, the optical observations often lead to the discovery of band systems of molecules whose spectra have not previously been observed-for example, those of Si(2)C(3), TaO(2), and WO(2). In these cases the location of the spectral regions in which molecular transitions appear may also serve to encourage the gas spectroscopist to further exploration with high-dispersion spectrographs. I share Ramsay's view (4, p. 204) that further investigation of f-number determinations from matrix spectra should be encouraged, particularly because of the lack of such data for molecules in stars. The principal source of error probably lies in the estimation of the number of molecules per square centimeter in the matrix, but no real test of this has been made. The only existing f values from matrix spectra are those for the C(3) (43, 44) and C(2) (51) molecules, and these are not ideal for test purposes. Because of the anomalous nature of the matrix results discussed above, the rather good agreement between f values for the solid and gas phases of C(2) (51) cannot be considered as support for the matrix determinations. What is needed is a matrix determination of several f(v'v"") values (that is, determinations for specific bands) for molecules such as CN and NO or, preferably, for a gas vaporized at high temperature, for which these f values are relatively well established in the gas phase. In this connection the possibility of determining other molecular properties in matrices comes to mind. However, it has been clearly shown that the shape of the potential energy function in the electronic states of molecules can be affected when molecules are trapped in matrices. Brewer, Brabson, and Meyer, in work on S(2) (55), and Schnepp and Dressler, in work on O(2) (56), have examined the anharmonicity in matrices over many vibrational levels. Distortion of the gas potential energy curves occurs in the heavier matrices and sometimes at high vibrational levels in the light ones. Recently work has been begun on comparing the Franck-Condon factors connecting the ground state and two excited states of ScF trapped in a neon matrix (57) with factors calculated from the gas-spectrum data of R. F. Barrow et al. (58) (Deltar(e), the change in interatomic distance upon excitation, has a relatively large value of ~ 0.1 A in these systems). As is well known, such factors are particularly sensitive to the value of Deltar(e), but differences in anharmonicity do not, however, have as significant an effect upon the Franck-Condon factors. Hence a comparison of the matrix and gas factors will lead to further information about matrix effects and will indicate whether Franck-Condon factors can be obtained from matrix spectra. One of the important problems in the study of stellar molecules is the determination of the low-lying electronically excited states, similar to the (1)Delta <--> X(3)Delta difference (~ 580 cm(-1)) in TiO measured by Phillips. Most of the transition-metal oxides have such low-lying levels, and they must be taken into consideration in any calculation of thermodynamic effects at high temperature. It appears that the study of emission spectra in the infrared at 4 degrees K may be one approach to this problem, and an attempt is now being made to confirm the TiO value in order to test the method. Perhaps the greatest advantage of matrix-isolation is the fact that it allows study of these molecules-or of any molecules difficult to produce in a microwave cavity-by electron-paramagnetic-resonance spectroscopy. Study of molecules by this means can provide information about ground state wave functions that is not obtainable by optical spectroscopy, as illustrated by the investigation of ScO, YO, and LaO. Also, it seems likely that the preferential orientation of molecules in matrices, which is probably achievable in most cases, will be a valuable asset in the study of the magnetic properties of molecules by electron-paramagneticresonance spectroscopy, regardless of whether the molecules are ""hot"" or ""cold"" (60)."
https://openalex.org/W2090847947,Acetic-acid (0.01 molar) extracts of wheat flour contain fibrils of alpha-gliadin which are about 80 angstroms thick and up to several thousand angstroms long. These fibrils dissociate to globular protein subunits at very low ionic strength and low pH. The fibrils can be reformed by increasing the pH to 5.1 and the ionic strength to about 0.005.
https://openalex.org/W1979876586,The various isotope effects on the superconducting transition temperature of Mo(2)B and W(2)B have been measured. Together with resistivity data they indicate that the d-shell forms a highly stable electron configuration for molybdenum and tungsten. This leads to an understanding of high superconducting transition temperatures.
https://openalex.org/W2040629971,"Cosmic ray nuclei have been observed with the use of plastic trackdetecting solids in satellites and high-altitude balloon flights. Nuclear emulsions in the stacks of plastic sheets allowed the positive identification of cosmic raynuclei as light as nitrogen. The most striking new information was the failure to observe relativistic iron nuclei, a result which has led to an advance in the understanding of track registration criteria."
https://openalex.org/W2029487743,"A piston core taken off of the coast of Oregon in 358 meters of water contained an indurated calcareous layer composed partly of dolomite with a composition Ca(58.7)Mg(41.3). Dolomites of this chemical composition are typical of the supratidal environment. However, the dolomite has isotopic composition delta0(18) = 5.8 per mille, deltaC(13) = 35.1 per mille relative to the Chicago PDB-I standard. The unusual carbon isotope ratio is similar to that of calcites produced as a byproduct of bacterial breakdown of hydrocarbons."

https://openalex.org/W2041182652,"P-wave velocities in the region near the source of a tremor of magnitude 3(3/4) were constant to within 2 percent for 41 days before the event; no evidence of a precursive change in velocity was found. Observations of S-wave velocities and the ratio of P-wave to S-wave velocities also showed no precursive changes. In recent studies, premonitory changes in body-wave velocities of about 10 percent and having a duration of 2 to 3 weeks have been reported for crustal earthquakes of this size."
https://openalex.org/W2084168031,"The ratios of fluxes of heavy cosmic-ray nuclei [(30 </= Z </= 40)/(20 < Z </= 28), where Z is the atomic number], based on studies of meteorites and lunar samples, show little variation with time, distance in the solar system (1 to 3 astronomical units), or kinetic energy (30 to 2000 megaelectron volts per nucleon). Samples exposed for time intervals of 10(3) to 10(8) years show that the variations in the flux of 30 </= Z </= 40 nuclei relative to that of the iron group nuclei (20 < Z </= 28) have remained within the range of (1.3 +/- 0.6) x 10(-3) during the last billions of years, thus indicating a remarkable similarity in the elemental composition of sources responsible for these nuclei in the cosmic radiation."

https://openalex.org/W2075801046,"Plants modified by recombinant DNA (rDNA) have been known since 1983 when three research teams independently reported the first stable integration of foreign DNA into plant cells and the regeneration of genetically modified plants. By 1987 rDNA-modified crop species were available that warranted field evaluation of traits conferred by the new genes. By the end of 1992 more than 40 species of rDNA-modified food and fiber crops will have been described and almost 600 field tests of rDNA-modified plants will be completed or in progress in more than 20 countries around the world. Many of these tests will involve plants of potential commercial value since they represent genetic improvements in disease or pest resistance, hybridization technologies, or value-added food traits such as nutritional or processing enhancements. The field tests evidence the substantial public and private commitments that have been made to agricultural biotechnology. They also provide tangible proof of very successful technology transfer from basic plant molecular biology laboratories to problem-solving research programs that should help ensure agricultural sufficiency into the next century."
