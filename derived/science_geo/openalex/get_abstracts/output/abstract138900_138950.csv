https://openalex.org/W2048490262,"Long-range, directed migration is particularly dramatic in the cerebral cortex, where postmitotic neurons generated deep in the brain migrate to form layers with distinct form and function. In the X-linked dominant human disorder periventricular heterotopia (PH), many neurons fail to migrate and persist as nodules lining the ventricular surface. Females with PH present with epilepsy and other signs, including patent ductus arteriosus and coagulopathy, while hemizygous males die embryonically. We have identified the PH gene as filamin 1 (FLN1), which encodes an actin-cross-linking phosphoprotein that transduces ligand–receptor binding into actin reorganization, and which is required for locomotion of many cell types. FLN1 shows previously unrecognized, high-level expression in the developing cortex, is required for neuronal migration to the cortex, and is essential for embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1985528328,"The adipocyte-derived hormone leptin decreases body weight in part by activating the sympathetic nervous system, resulting in increased thermogenesis and energy expenditure. We investigated hypothalamic pathways underlying leptin’s effects on stimulating the sympathetic nervous system. We found that leptin activates neurons in the retrochiasmatic area (RCA) and lateral arcuate nucleus (Arc) that innervate the thoracic spinal cord and also contain cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART). We also found that most CART-containing neurons in the RCA and Arc of the hypothalamus also contain proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA. The finding that leptin activates CART/POMC neurons innervating sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the thoracic spinal cord suggests that this pathway may contribute to the increased thermogenesis and energy expenditure and decreased body weight observed following leptin administration."
https://openalex.org/W2156374963,"We used high-field (3T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to label cortical activity due to visual spatial attention, relative to flattened cortical maps of the retinotopy and visual areas from the same human subjects. In the main task, the visual stimulus remained constant, but covert visual spatial attention was varied in both location and load. In each of the extrastriate retinotopic areas, we found MR increases at the representations of the attended target. Similar but smaller increases were found in V1. Decreased MR levels were found in the same cortical locations when attention was directed at retinotopically different locations. In and surrounding area MT+, MR increases were lateralized but not otherwise retinotopic. At the representation of eccentricities central to that of the attended targets, prominent MR decreases occurred during spatial attention."
https://openalex.org/W2023285758,"The glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) ligands (GDNF, Neurturin [NTN], and Persephin [PSP]) signal through a multicomponent receptor system composed of a high-affinity binding component (GFRalpha1-GFRalpha4) and a common signaling component (RET). Here, we report the identification of Artemin, a novel member of the GDNF family, and demonstrate that it is the ligand for the former orphan receptor GFRalpha3-RET. Artemin is a survival factor for sensory and sympathetic neurons in culture, and its expression pattern suggests that it also influences these neurons in vivo. Artemin can also activate the GFRalpha1-RET complex and supports the survival of dopaminergic midbrain neurons in culture, indicating that like GDNF (GFRalpha1-RET) and NTN (GFRalpha2-RET), Artemin has a preferred receptor (GFRalpha3-RET) but that alternative receptor interactions also occur."
https://openalex.org/W1993129834,"The prefrontal (PF) cortex has been implicated in the remarkable ability of primates to form and rearrange arbitrary associations rapidly. This ability was studied in two monkeys, using a task that required them to learn to make specific saccades in response to particular cues and then repeatedly reverse these responses. We found that the activity of individual PF neurons represented both the cues and the associated responses, perhaps providing a neural substrate for their association. Furthermore, during learning, neural activity conveyed the direction of the animals' impending responses progressively earlier within each successive trial. The final level of activity just before the response, however, was unaffected by learning. These results suggest a role for the PF cortex in learning arbitrary cue-response associations, an ability critical for complex behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2045860277,"The Abl and Arg tyrosine kinases play fundamental roles in the development and function of the central nervous system. Arg is most abundant in adult mouse brain, especially in synapse-rich regions. arg−/− mice develop normally but exhibit multiple behavioral abnormalities, suggesting that arg−/− brains suffer from defects in neuronal function. Embryos deficient in both Abl and Arg suffer from defects in neurulation and die before 11 days postcoitum (dpc). Although they divide normally, abl−/−arg−/− neuroepithelial cells display gross alterations in their actin cytoskeleton. We find that Abl and Arg colocalize with each other and with actin microfilaments at the apical surface of the developing neuroepithelium. Thus, Abl and Arg play essential roles in neurulation and can regulate the structure of the actin cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W1999170657,"Hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are the most widely studied forms of synaptic plasticity thought to underlie spatial learning and memory. We report here that RARbeta deficiency in mice virtually eliminates hippocampal CA1 LTP and LTD. It also results in substantial performance deficits in spatial learning and memory tasks. Surprisingly, RXRgamma null mice exhibit a distinct phenotype in which LTD is lost whereas LTP is normal. Thus, while retinoid receptors contribute to both LTP and LTD, they do so in different ways. These findings not only genetically uncouple LTP and LTD but also reveal a novel and unexpected role for vitamin A in higher cognitive functions."
https://openalex.org/W2052065200,"Olfactory sensory neurons expressing a given odorant receptor project to two topographically fixed glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. We have examined the contribution of different cell types in the olfactory bulb to the establishment of this topographic map. Mice with a homozygous deficiency in Tbr-1 lack most projection neurons, whereas mice with a homozygous deficiency in Dlx-1 and Dlx-2 lack most GABAergic interneurons. Mice bearing a P2-IRES-tau-lacZ allele and deficient in either Tbr-1 or Dlx-1/Dlx-2 reveal the convergence of axons to one medial and one lateral site at positions analogous to those observed in wild-type mice. These observations suggest that the establishment of a topographic map is not dependent upon cues provided by, or synapse formation with, the major neuronal cell types in the olfactory bulb."
https://openalex.org/W1977614131,"Familial prion diseases are caused by mutations in the gene encoding the prion protein (PrP). We have produced transgenic mice that express the mouse homolog of a mutant human PrP containing a nine octapeptide insertion associated with prion dementia. These mice exhibit a slowly progressive neurological disorder characterized clinically by ataxia and neuropathologically by cerebellar atrophy and granule cell loss, gliosis, and PrP deposition that is most prominent in the cerebellum and hippocampus. Mutant PrP molecules expressed in the brains of these mice are resistant to digestion by low concentrations of proteinase K and display several other biochemical properties reminiscent of PrPSc, the pathogenic isoform of PrP. These results establish a new transgenic animal model of an inherited human prion disorder."
https://openalex.org/W1997937844,"Neuropilin-1 and neuropilin-2 show specificity in binding to different class III semaphorins, including Sema III, Sema E, and Sema IV, suggesting that the specificity of action of these semaphorins is dictated by the complement of neuropilins expressed by responsive neurons. In support of this, we show that sympathetic axons coexpress neuropilin-1 and -2, that their responses to Sema III, Sema E, and Sema IV are affected in predicted ways by antibodies to neuropilin-1, and that neuropilin-1 and -2 can form homo- and heterooligomers through an interaction involving at least partly the neuropilin MAM (meprin, A5, mu) domain. These results support the idea that in sympathetic axons, the Sema III signal is mediated predominantly by neuropilin-1 oligomers, the Sema IV signal by neuropilin-2 oligomers, and the Sema E signal by neuropilin-1 and -2, either as homo- or heterooligomers."

https://openalex.org/W1977413405,"Visual connections to the mammalian forebrain are known to be patterned by neural activity, but it remains unknown whether the map topography of such higher sensory projections depends on axon guidance labels. Here, we show complementary expression and binding for the receptor EphA5 in mouse retina and its ligands ephrin-A2 and ephrin-A5 in multiple retinal targets, including the major forebrain target, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). These ligands can act in vitro as topographically specific repellents for mammalian retinal axons and are necessary for normal dLGN mapping in vivo. The results suggest a general and economic modular mechanism for brain mapping whereby a projecting field is mapped onto multiple targets by repeated use of the same labels. They also indicate the nature of a coordinate system for the mapping of sensory connections to the forebrain."
https://openalex.org/W1992024544,"The use of antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit the expression of targeted mRNA sequences is becoming increasingly commonplace. Although effective, the most widely used oligonucleotide modification (phosphorothioate) has some limitations. In previous studies we have described a 20-mer phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide inhibitor of human protein kinase C-α expression. In an effort to identify improved antisense inhibitors of protein kinase C expression, a series of 2′ modifications have been incorporated into the protein kinase C-α targeting oligonucleotide, and the effects on oligonucleotide biophysical characteristics and pharmacology evaluated. The incorporation of 2′-O-(2-methoxy)ethyl chemistry resulted in a number of significant improvements in oligonucleotide characteristics. These include an increase in hybridization affinity toward a complementary RNA (1.5° C per modification) and an increase in resistance toward both 3′-exonuclease and intracellular nucleases. These improvements result in a substantial increase in oligonucleotide potency (>20-fold after 72 h). The most active compound identified was used to examine the role played by protein kinase C-α in mediating the phorbol ester-induced changes in c-fos,c-jun, and junB expression in A549 lung epithelial cells. Depletion of protein kinase C-α protein expression by this oligonucleotide lead to a reduction in c-jun expression but not c-fos orjunB. These results demonstrate that 2′-O-(2-methoxy)ethyl-modified antisense oligonucleotides are 1) effective inhibitors of protein kinase C-α expression, and 2) represent a class of antisense oligonucleotide which are much more effective inhibitors of gene expression than the widely used phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotides.

These can be subdivided on the basis of structural and biochemical similarities into three groups, the conventional (α,βI, βII, and γ), the novel (δ, ε, η, θ and μ), and the atypical (ζ and ι) (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4207) Google Scholar, 2Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 3Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). The classic PKCs and the novel PKCs are activated by 1,2-diacylglycerol, which is generated by phospholipase cleavage of membrane phospholipids. These phospholipases are regulated by many growth factors and hormones, and it is therefore widely thought that PKC isozymes play an important role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as short-term cellular responses, such as secretion and ion flux (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4207) Google Scholar). The identification of multiple members of the PKC family has lead to speculation that individual isozymes play different roles in regulating different cell functions (4Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). Much evidence is available to support this hypothesis. For example, expression profiles of the individual family members is extremely heterogeneous, both at the tissue and the subcellular levels (4Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar, 5Buchner K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In addition, the substrate specificities of purified proteins are very different, and the responses of isozymes to stimuli differ not just between isotypes, but also between the same isotype stimulated in different cell types. Considerable effort has been made over the last 10 years to develop isozyme-specific inhibitors of PKC to allow the dissection of the PKC-dependent signaling pathways (6Hofmann J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 649-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). These efforts are hampered by the similarities in protein structure of the many isozymes of PKC, which make the identification of specific, small molecule enzyme inhibitors difficult. To overcome this difficulty, we have used antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit the expression of individual isozymes of PKC (7Dean N.M. McKay R. Condon T.P. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16416-16424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Dean N.M. McKay R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11762-11766Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Antisense oligonucleotides can be targeted to mRNA sequences which are unique to a given PKC isozyme, leading to the selective inhibition in expression of that isozyme (9Dean N.M. McKay R. Miraglia L. Geiger T. Muller M. Fabbro D. Bennett C.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 10McGraw K. McKay R. Miraglia L. Boggs R. Pribble J.P. Muller M. Geiger T. Fabbro D. Dean N.M. Anti-Cancer Drug Design. 1997; 12: 315-326PubMed Google Scholar). The long half-lives of some PKC proteins (and other proteins which have been targeted with antisense oligonucleotides) have proven problematic, as we have found that the most widely used oligonucleotide modification available, the phosphorothioate (P=S) oligodeoxynucleotide, is metabolized in cells over time. This leads to a loss of activity over a 48–72-h period, which can make inhibition of some PKC isozymes difficult (7Dean N.M. McKay R. Condon T.P. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16416-16424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Dean N.M. McKay R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The factors which govern oligonucleotide activity are complex. Two important parameters are the affinity with which an oligonucleotide hybridizes to a target mRNA, and the ability of the oligonucleotide to withstand degradation by intracellular nucleases (12Lamond A.I. Sproat B.S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 13Wagner R.W. Matteucci M.D. Lewis J.G. Gutierrez A.J. Moulds C. Froehler B.C.

We have therefore sought to improve these characteristics, with the anticipation that this would lead to the identification of antisense oligonucleotides with improved pharmacological activity compared with those presently available. This should allow for the development not just of improved antisense inhibitors of PKC, but of a more generalized class of antisense effective against any mRNA target which encodes a protein with a long half-life. In the present study, the biophysical and pharmacological activity of oligonucleotides containing the recently described 2′-O-(2-methoxy)ethyl (2′-MOE) modification (20Altmann K.-H. Dean N.M. Fabbro D. Freier S.M. Geiger T. Haner R. Hüsken D. Martin P. Monia B.P. Muller M. Natt F. Nicklin P. Phillips J. Pieles U. Sasmor H. Moser H.E. Chimia. 1996; 50: 168-176Google Scholar), with both 2-O-methyl (2′-M) and 2′-deoxy containing oligonucleotides are contrasted. Antisense oligonucleotides can inhibit the expression of proteins by a number of potential mechanisms (21Dolnick B.J. Cancer Invest. 1991; 9: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Crooke S.T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1992; 32: 329-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 23Wagner R.W.

One of the most effective oligonucleotide-dependent mechanisms for reducing protein expression is to cause an RNase H-mediated cleavage in the hybridized target mRNA (7Dean N.M. McKay R. Condon T.P. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16416-16424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Walder R.Y. Walder J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Unfortunately, however, 2′-alkyl modifications (such as 2′-MOE) do not support RNase H-mediated mRNA cleavage (12Lamond A.I. Sproat B.S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 18Altmann K.-H. Fabbro D. Dean N.M. Geiger T. Monia B.P. Muller M. Nicklin P. Biochem. Soc.

This can be overcome by the inclusion of 2′-deoxy residues into an antisense oligonucleotide, in combination with 2′-alkyl modifications, in a motif that will support RNase H cleavage (chimeric oligonucleotides) (11McKay R.M.

In our studies reported here, an oligonucleotide containing 2-MOE modification in such a configuration was found to be at least 20-fold more active than conventional P=S oligodeoxynucleotides at reducing the expression of PKC-α mRNA in A549 lung carcinoma cells. This inhibition resulted in a time dependent and oligonucleotide-specific reduction in expression of PKC-α protein. This has allowed us to examine the role played by PKC-α in regulating the expression of members of the AP-1 family of transcription factors in A549 lung carcinoma cells. Activation of PKC by phorbol esters leads to an increase in expression of the fos and junfamily members, by both increased transcription and increases in mRNA stability. The PKC isoform responsible for this increase is not clear, as A549 cells express multiple phorbol ester binding PKC isozymes, including PKC-α, δ, ε, and η. Depletion of PKC-α from A549 cells had a dramatic effect on the increase in c-jun mRNA expression, reducing the up-regulation to levels seen in control cells. In contrast, the phorbol ester dependent increase in c-fos and junB mRNA expression was not inhibited. Human A549 lung carcinoma cells were obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection (ATCC). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 g of glucose/liter and 10% fetal calf serum and routinely passaged when 90–95% confluent. Phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized as described previously (7Dean N.M. McKay R. Condon T.P. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16416-16424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2′-O-Methyl and 2′-MOE oligonucleotides were synthesized as described (32Baker B.F. Lot S.S. Condon T.P. Cheng-Flournoy S.

Absorbanceversus temperature profiles were performed as described previously (33Chiang M.Y. Chan H. Zounes M.A. Freier S.M. Lima W.F. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18162-18171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, antisense oligonucleotides were hybridized to complementary RNA strands and T m values and free energies of duplex formation were obtained. Values are the averages of three experiments. A549 cells were grown to 60–70% confluence in T-75 flasks. The cells were then washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 μg/ml N-[1-(2, 3-dioleyloxy)propyl]-n, n,n-trimethylammonium chloride/dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOTMA/DOPE) (Lipofectin®)(Life Technologies, Inc.) solution was added to the flasks. Oligonucleotides were added to the required concentration from a 10 μm stock solution and the flask swirled to mix the solutions. The cells were then incubated at 37° C for 4 h and then the DOTMA/DOPE/oligonucleotide solution was aspirated off and replaced with medium for the indicated time. Oligonucleotide resistance to snake venom 3′-phosphodiesterase was determined as described previously (11McKay R.M. Cummins L.L. Graham M.J. Lesnick E.A. Owens S.R. Winniman M. Dean N.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, the oligonucleotides were gel purified and 5′-end-labeled with high performance liquid chromatography-purified [γ-32P]ATP (ICN). The oligonucleotides (100 nm) were then incubated with snake venom phosphodiesterase (U. S. Biochemical Corp./Amersham) (5 × 10−3units/ml) for the indicated times. The oligonucleotide metabolites were then resolved on a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel followed by quantitation by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) analysis. A549 cells were treated with 500 nm oligonucleotides as described above and allowed to recover for 72 h. At this time, metabolites were recovered and analyzed by capillary gel electrophoresis as described previously (11McKay R.M. Cummins L.L. Graham M.J. Lesnick E.A. Owens S.R. Winniman M. Dean N.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). After digestion with proteinase K, oligonucleotide metabolites were recovered by sequential passages through an anion exchange column and a reverse phase column. Analysis of the samples by capillary gel electrophoresis was performed on a Beckman 5010 P/ACE capillary electrophoresis unit. Total mRNA was extracted from cells and resolved on agarose gels as described previously (7Dean N.M. McKay R. Condon T.P. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16416-16424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These were transferred to nylon membrane (Bio-Rad) and probed with 32P-radiolabeled cDNA probes for different PKC isozymes (7Dean N.M. McKay R. Condon T.P. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16416-16424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, gels were probed with [32P]cDNA probes for c-fos, c-jun, junB (ATCC). Gels were routinely stripped and reprobed with radiolabeled human glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probe to confirm equal loading. Radioactive bands were quantitated using a PhosphorImager, and typically we measure only the upper of the two PKC-α transcripts, although both are reduced with identical kinetics upon oligonucleotide treatment of cells. 2R.

PKC-α, UBI; PKC-δ, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; PKC-ε, a gift from Dr. Doriano Fabbro, Novartis Pharmaceuticals; PKC-η, BioMol; PKC-μ, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; and PKC-ζ (UBI). A549 cells were treated with oligonucleotides for 3 days. Cells were then washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and pelleted into a sample preparation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 50 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm benzamidine). A cytosolic fraction was prepared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4° C. PKC enzyme activity was determined by measuring the ability of the cytosolic protein extract to phosphorylate a synthetic peptide substrate in the absence or presence of phosphatidylserine in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent-based assay according to the manufacturers instructions (MBL Co. Ltd., Nagoya, Japan). The final concentrations of the reaction mixture used were 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, ±50 μg/ml phosphatidylserine. PKC activity is defined as phosphatidylserine-dependent kinase activity. The inhibition of PKC-α mRNA expression by the uniform phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide sequence used here is believed to be mediated by RNase H (7Dean N.M. McKay R. Condon T.P. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16416-16424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 2′-modifications examined in the present study do not form substrates for RNase H, and therefore need to be incorporated into the oligonucleotide in combination with oligodeoxynucleotide residues to effect this mechanism of mRNA degradation (18Altmann K.-H.

To determine the requirements for this oligonucleotide sequence, we have initially incorporated 4, 6, or 8 contiguous oligodeoxynucleotide residues (deoxy gap) into the center of a full phosphorothioated 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotide, and determined the ability of these oligonucleotides to reduce PKC-α mRNA expression in human lung A549 cells at 500 nm concentration. As shown previously, a fully 2′-O-methyl modified compound was unable to reduce PKC-α mRNA expression (Fig. 1, Aand B). However, increasing the number of oligodeoxynucleotide residues (deoxy gap) present in the oligonucleotide resulted in a progressive increase in the ability of the sequence to reduce PKC-α mRNA expression. A contiguous stretch of 8 oligodeoxy residues gave a greater than 90% reduction in expression of PKC-α mRNA (Fig. 1, A andB). A series of oligonucleotides were subsequently synthesized with 8 contiguous central oligodeoxynucleotide residues flanked with either 2′-O-methyl or 2′-MOE-modified sugar residues. The 3′ end base of each oligonucleotide was left oligodeoxynucleotide for synthetic reasons. P=S backbone linkages were always retained in the central oligodeoxynucleotide sequence of the oligonucleotide to maintain resistance to endonucleases in this part of the molecule (15Monia B.P. Lesnik E.A. Gonzalez C. Lima W.F. McGee D. Guinosso C.J. Kawasaki A.M. Cook P.D. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14514-14522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The flanking sequences were also prepared with either phosphorothioate and phosphodiester backbones (TableI). The incorporation of a total of 11 2′-O-methyl residues increased oligonucleotide affinity toward a complementary mRNA from 52.1 to 61.9° C and 62.6° C as either P=S or P=O backbone linkages. The 2′-MOE incorporations gave a greater increase in T m, to 64.8 and 69.6° C, respectively.Table ISequence, chemistry, structure, and hybridizing affinity of the oligonucleotides used in the present studyThe 20-mer antisense oligonucleotide targeted to 3′-untranslated sequences in the human PKC-α mRNA were synthesized with the indicated 2′-sugar modifications (underlined sequences).

The 2′-modified regions were synthesized with either phosphorothioate (lowercase s between bases) or phosphodiester (lower case o between bases) backbone linkages.

The nuclease resistance of the chimeric oligonucleotides shown in Table I was determined using a number of different strategies. An in vitro nuclease assay was used to examine the ability to withstand digestion by a snake venom phosphodiesterase (a 3′-exonuclease). Under conditions which resulted in 50% digestion of the full-length P=S oligodeoxynucleotide (ISIS 3521) (60 min incubation time with the nuclease), approximately 75% of a chimeric 2′-O-methyl/P=O compound (ISIS 8329) was degraded (Fig. 2). In contrast, only approximately 40% of the 2′-MOE/P=O oligonucleotide (ISIS 9605) was degraded, demonstrating that even combined with a P=O backbone, this latter modification provides greater nuclease resistance than that obtained by a P=S oligodeoxynucleotide substituent. When the two 2′-O-modified sugar residues were evaluated in the context of a P=S backbone they provided considerable enhancement of stability (Fig. 2). The 2′-MOE was superior, demonstrating no digestion for the duration of the experiment. Experiments were also performed to evaluate the effects of incorporating the 2′-O-methyl and 2′-MOE modifications as P=S on oligonucleotide stability in tissue culture cells. A549 cells were treated with oligonucleotides (500 nm in the presence of cationic liposomes) and the oligonucleotide metabolites extracted from cells 72 h later and resolved by capillary gel electrophoresis. At this time, extensive metabolism of ISIS 3521 had occurred consistent with the successive removal of 3′-bases by 3′-exonucleases resulting in the appearance of n-1, -2 etc. metabolites (Fig. 3). Some metabolism of the 2′-O-methyl containing oligonucleotide (ISIS 5357) was also apparent (results not shown). In contrast, no metabolism of ISIS 9606 (the 2′-MOE modified oligonucleotide) was found (Fig. 3). Transfection of the P=S oligodeoxynucleotide (ISIS 3521) into A549 cells results in a concentration-dependent reduction in PKC-α mRNA expression after 24 h (7Dean N.M. McKay R. Condon T.P. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16416-16424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The IC50 for this reduction was approximately 100 nm. In the context of a P=S backbone, the 2′-O-methyl (ISIS 5357) and 2′-MOE (ISIS 9606) containing oligonucleotides demonstrate approximately a 2- and 5-fold increase in potency, respectively (Fig.4,A and B) as a consequence of the enhanced hybridizing affinity of these two compounds. In the context of a P=O backbone, the 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotide (ISIS 8329) is inactive, even though this molecule has a substantially higher T m than the parent P=S oligodeoxynucleotide (ISIS 3521). In contrast, the phosphodiester containing 2′-MOE compound (ISIS 9605) is about 4-fold more active than ISIS 3521 (Fig. 4, A and B). PKC-α protein has a very long half-life (approximately 24 h) (40Borner C. Eppenberger U. Wyss R. Fabbro D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2110-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and therefore to substantially reduce expression of this protein (by >80%) should require oligonucleotide activity for at least three half-lives of the protein. The ability of the 2′-MOE modification to withstand nuclease digestion prompted us to determine whether oligonucleotides containing these modifications could reduce expression of PKC-α mRNA for extended periods of time. Oligonucleotides ISIS 3521, ISIS 9605, and ISIS 9606 (as well as two scrambled control oligonucleotides) were transfected into A549 cells and PKC-α mRNA expression determined 72 h later. At this time ISIS 3521 is inacti"

We tested the hypothesis that members of the DEG/ENaC family of cation channels, which are responsible for touch sensation in Caenorhabditis elegans, may be components of the baroreceptor mechanosensor. We found the gamma subunit of ENaC localized to the site of mechanotransduction in baroreceptor nerve terminals innervating the aortic arch and carotid sinus. A functional role for DEG/ENaC members was suggested by blockade of baroreceptor nerve activity and baroreflex control of blood pressure by an amiloride analog that inhibits DEG/ENaC channels. These data suggest that ENaC subunits may be components of the baroreceptor mechanotransducer and pave the way to a better definition of mechanisms responsible for blood pressure regulation and hypertension."

We discovered that the tuning functions of LMN HD cells become narrower during contraversive head turns, but not ipsiversive head turns, compared to when the head is not turning. This narrowing effect does not occur for ATN HD cells. We also found that the HD signal in LMN leads that in ATN by about 15-20 ms. When LMN was lesioned bilaterally, HD cells in ATN immediately lost their directional firing properties and never recovered them. Based on these findings, we argue that LMN may be an essential component of an attractor-integrator network that participates in generating the HD signal."

(EC 2.3.2.13) is a widely distributed intra- and extracellular calcium-dependent enzyme, which catalyzes the formation of high molecular mass complexes of its substrate proteins by creating isopeptide cross-links from glutamine and lysine residues and releasing ammonia (1Greenberg C.S.

TG is closely related to wound healing which suggests a role for it in tissue remodeling and repair (3Upchurch H.F. Conway E. Patterson Jr., M.K. Maxwell M. J. Cell.

It is also synthesized in other types of tissues and found in,e.g. inner ear, brain, kidney (7Butler W.T. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 23: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), and atherosclerotic plaques (13Fitzpatrick L.A. Severson A. Edwards W.D. Ingram R.T. J. Clin.

Its production is also related to immunity, infection, and cancer (8Denhardt D.T. Guo X. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Osteoblasts express OPN at an early developmental stage of bone formation (16Mark M.P. Prince C.W. Oosawa T. Gay S. Bronckers A.L.J.J. Butler W.T. J. Histochem.

Differentation. 1988; 37: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In bone, OPN is deposited into unmineralized matrix prior to calcification and thereon localized at various tissue interfaces, e.g. cement lines, lamina limitans, and between collagen fibrils of fully matured hard tissues (18McKee M.D. Nanci A. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1996; 33: 141-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Recent knock-out mice experiments by Liaw et al. (19Liaw L. Birk D.E. Ballas C.B. Whitsitt J.S. Davidson J.M. Hogan B.L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1468-1478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that OPN, more specifically, functions in tissue repair, matrix organization, and collagen fibrillogenesis.The role of polymeric OPN, resulting from cross-linking by TG, is unknown. We have previously demonstrated that osteocalcin inhibits TG activity in vitro as measured by cross-linking of osteopontin (20Kaartinen M.T. Pirhonen A. Linnala-Kankkunen A. Mäenpää P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22736-22741Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Since recent gene knock-out experiments have demonstrated that osteocalcin is an inhibitor of bone formation (21Ducy P. Desbois C. Boyce B. Pinero G. Story B. Dunstan C. Smith E. Bonadio J. Goldstein S. Gundberg C. Bradley A. Karsenty G. Nature. 1996; 382: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar), our results suggest that TG activity and the OPN aggregates may be involved in enhancement of biomineralization or matrix maturation that precedes it. In this study the collagen binding properties of polymeric and monomeric OPN were investigated since this feature could be pivotal for the maturation and organization of the bone matrix as well as for the mineralization event. The collagen types examined were the fiber forming collagens, types I and II, III and V, which are synthesized in,e.g. bone, cartilage, and vascular smooth muscle cells (22Liu S.H. Yang R.-S. Al-shaikh R. Lane J.M. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 1995; 318: 265-278PubMed Google Scholar), and type IV, which is a basement membrane collagen (23Yurchenco P.D. O′Rear J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 489-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We provide evidence that OPN, as a high molecular weight complex form, exhibits significantly increased binding ability to all tested collagens. This may result from an altered conformation of the OPN after polymerization as observed by circular dichroism measurements. A more stabile structure and amplified collagen binding property, after treating OPN with an enzyme that is intimately involved in tissue repair, brings further support to OPN′s role as a tissue remodeling protein and gives an insight into the functions of the polymeric OPN.DISCUSSIONWe have previously reported that the TG-catalyzed cross-linking of OPN is inhibited in vitro by osteocalcin (20Kaartinen M.T. Pirhonen A. Linnala-Kankkunen A. Mäenpää P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22736-22741Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In light of the finding that osteocalcin apparently functions as a mineralization inhibitor in the mouse model (21Ducy P. Desbois C. Boyce B. Pinero G. Story B. Dunstan C. Smith E. Bonadio J. Goldstein S. Gundberg C. Bradley A. Karsenty G. Nature. 1996; 382: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar), the TG-mediated protein aggregation event might have an advantageous effect on mineralization or matrix maturation that precedes it. The results of this study demonstrated that OPN aggregates exhibited a property of increased binding to collagen as compared with the monomeric form. Another acidic phosphorylated TG-substrate, casein, did not posses this property, indicating the specificity of collagen binding of TG-treated OPN. TG treatment appeared to introduce a 5-fold amount of OPN onto collagens, but predominantly when OPN and its polymer were in solution. This might indicate that a specific conformation, achieved in solution, might be required for binding. This elevated collagen binding property of polymeric OPN can result from: 1) its increased affinity for and association with collagen fibrils, therefore resulting in more rapid coating of collagen during the incubation; 2) or the polymer may have more binding sites on collagen resulting in a more efficient coating. Both could be explained by a conformational change observed in the CD experiments. Alteration in the OPN conformation of the monomer unit and/or several OPN molecules packed together could expose or create motives relevant to its interactive properties with collagen. Most interestingly, in comparison with other types of collagens, collagen type V appeared to have a very distinctive and different behavior. It seemed to bind the polymeric OPN even in the absence of calcium, but only when the polymer was in solution. Soluble collagen type V also seemed to have the greatest affinity for immobilized monomeric OPN. This might not only reflect a special function of collagen type V in extracellular matrix maturation (or bone formation) sequence, but also demonstrates the difference between the two forms of OPN.OPN′s in vitro behavior with TG clearly shows that OPN is a substrate of this enzyme. OPN functioning also as an in vivosubstrate is supported by several studies. The transglutaminase reactive acceptor glutamines are well conserved in all known OPN sequences, indicating the significance of the motif to its functions (27Sørensen E.S. Petersen T.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 760: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). OPN polymers have been found in different physiological sources such as bone (10Sørensen E.S. Rasmussen L.K. Møller L. Jensen P.H. Højrup P. Petersen T.E. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), secreted by smooth muscle cells (28Giachelli C.M. Liaw L. Murry C.E. Schwartz S.M. Almeida M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 760: 109-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and in milk as shown by our study. The observation that TG has been found to be active in bone in areas undergoing mineralization (5Aeschlimann D. Wetterwald A. Fleisch H. Paulsson M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1461-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 6Aeschlimann D. Kaupp O. Paulsson M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) where also OPN has been localized in high concentrations (29McKee M.D. Glimcher M.J. Nanci A. Anat. Rec. 1992; 234: 479-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), gives us a reason to believe that TG and OPN are able to interact in these areas. Indeed, Sørensen et al. (10Sørensen E.S.

J. 1994; 304: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) have shown with Western blotting that EDTA extracts of bovine bone contain high-molecular mass OPN complexes. Functional or basic biochemical studies of OPN aggregates have not been performed earlier and the functions of these complexes have only been speculative.Based on the results of this study, we suggest that the TG-mediated cross-linking of OPN may be directed to enhance the “glue-like” adhesion properties required in the processes that need collagen binding, e.g. in the adherence of different tissue interfacial structures (new and old bone), collagen fibrillogenesis, and wound healing. The enhanced adhesive property would be highly important for a protein postulated to function as a “mortar between bricks” (18McKee M.D. Nanci A. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1996; 33: 141-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Although OPN is predominantly localized between collagen fibrils in fully matured hard tissue (29McKee M.D. Glimcher M.J. Nanci A. Anat. Rec. 1992; 234: 479-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the reports on its affinity for collagens have shown evidence of no or only moderate attachment (7Butler W.T. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 23: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 30Chen Y. Bal B.S. Gorski J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24871-24878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results of our study suggest that OPN has a significant affinity for collagens, but predominantly as a polymeric form. TG has been recently characterized as a biological glue for cartilage-cartilage interfaces (31Jürgensen K. Aeschlimann D. Cavin V. Genge M. Hunziker E.B. J. Bone Joint Surg. 1997; 79: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, OPN as a TG substrate could be an essential component of the “glue” and the polymerization indeed a prerequisite for its functioning as an adhesive protein.Since isopeptide bonds produced by TG are resistant to normal proteolysis (1Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 2Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), the polymeric OPN may substantially contribute to the overall integrity and strength of the extracellular matrix where it is present. This kind of strenghtening might be required, for example, in wound healing. In bone, it is also possible that the binding of OPN to collagen could be further stabilized by additional cross-linking by TG since covalent collagen-phosphoprotein complexes have been foundin vivo in bone (32Curley-Joseph J. Veis A. J. Dent. Res. 1979; 58: 1625-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and several collagens have been identified as substrates of TG (2Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 33Kleman J.-P. Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. van der Rest M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13768-13775Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Osteonectin (6Aeschlimann D. Kaupp O. Paulsson M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and fibronectin (11Beninati S. Senger D.R. Cordella-Miele E. Mukherjee A.B. Chackalaparampil I. Shanmugam V. Singh K. Mukherjee B.B. J. Biochem. 1994; 115: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) are also TG substrates indicating the presence of non-collagenous protein-protein cross-links in the extracellular matrix.In addition to the plausable adhesive and matrix-stabilizing (or matrix organizing) properties of the polymeric OPN/TG activity, a collagen-bound acidic cross-link network could also provide suitable bedding for mineral growth in bone (34Boskey A.L. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 1992; 281: 244-274PubMed Google Scholar, 35Glimcher M.J. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1984; 304: 479-508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Glimcher M.J. Anat. Rec. 1989; 224: 139-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Calcification of the matrix follows matrix deposition and maturation in the bone formation sequence, distinguishing it from other types of extracellular matrices. It has been shown that collagen per se is not able to calcify (37Endo A. Glimcher M. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 21: 179-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To accumulate and crystallize calcium and phosphate into hydroxyapatite, collagens seem to require other charged molecules on their surface (37Endo A. Glimcher M. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 21: 179-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Bone phosphoproteins have been postulated to function as such molecules (34Boskey A.L. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 1992; 281: 244-274PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, phosphoproteins have been observed to initiate in vitro mineral formation when bound to collagen (37Endo A. Glimcher M. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 21: 179-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and to inhibit crystal growth in vitro when in solution (38Romberg R.W. Werness P.G. Riggs B.L. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1176-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 39Boskey A.L. Maresca M. Ullrich W. Doty S.B. Butler W.T. Prince C.W.

J. 1994; 300: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). OPN, as a phosphoprotein, could function as an initiator when bound to collagen as a polymeric form or provide a protein scaffold together with collagen for other bone matrix macromolecules, such as bone sialoprotein, to bind and initiate calcification. The calcium binding properties of OPN were not specifically altered after polymerization (data not shown). However, OPN is known as a high capacity calcium binder (30Chen Y. Bal B.S. Gorski J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24871-24878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).A protein aggregation event may have an important role in bone formation, maturation, and calcification in general. Gorski et al. (41Gorski J.P. Kremer E.A. Chen Y. Ryan S. Fullenkamp C. Delviscio J. Jensen K. McKee M.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 547-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 42Gorski J.P. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1992; 50: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) have reported that bone acidic glycoprotein-75 (BAG-75) undergoes a spontaneous Ca2+-induced polymerization, which increases its collagen binding activity. The aggregated forms of BAG-75 are resistant to reducing and denaturing conditions indicating their covalent nature, which suggests that intramolecular cross-links could be present. High molecular weight complexes of BAG-75 were detected in extracts of mineralizing calvarial explant cultures (41Gorski J.P. Kremer E.A. Chen Y. Ryan S. Fullenkamp C. Delviscio J. Jensen K. McKee M.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 547-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). More interestingly, newly synthesized BAG-75 from these cultures was present entirely in large macromolecular complexes, whereas non-mineralizing ROS 17/2.8 cultures produced only monomeric BAG-75 (41Gorski J.P. Kremer E.A. Chen Y. Ryan S. Fullenkamp C. Delviscio J. Jensen K. McKee M.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 547-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Other kinds of enzymatic modulation have also recently been reported to have an effect on bone matrix protein interaction property. Sasaki et al. (43Sasaki T. Göhring W. Mann K. Maurer P. Hohenester E. Knäuper V. Murphy G. Timpl R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9237-9243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) demonstrated,e.g. that cleavage of osteonectin by metalloproteinases results in a 7–20-fold increase in its binding to collagens.Those results together with ours suggest that biological functions of bone matrix proteins may largely depend on their post-translational modifications, conformational alterations, and surrounding ion concentrations, and that especially a covalent aggregation event may have a pivotal role for tissue maturation and development. In light of our findings, we suggest that TG activity could result in an altered function of OPN resulting from altered conformation accompanied with amplified collagen binding property. Instead of monomeric OPN, the complex form of OPN might be the OPN that is involved in collagen fibrillogenesis, matrix maturation, and possibly mineralization. Importantly, the function of OPN could therefore be regulated by TG expression and tissue distribution during different stages of tissue remodeling or bone formation.

(EC 2.3.2.13) is a widely distributed intra- and extracellular calcium-dependent enzyme, which catalyzes the formation of high molecular mass complexes of its substrate proteins by creating isopeptide cross-links from glutamine and lysine residues and releasing ammonia (1Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 2Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). TG is suggested to be involved in matrix maturation and stabilize the tissue with cross-links that are resistant to normal proteolysis (1Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 2Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). TG is closely related to wound healing which suggests a role for it in tissue remodeling and repair (3Upchurch H.F. Conway E. Patterson Jr., M.K. Maxwell M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 4Bowness J.M. Tarr A.H. Wong T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 967: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical data have also demonstrated the presence of TG in mineralizing cartilage and bone (5Aeschlimann D. Wetterwald A. Fleisch H. Paulsson M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1461-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 6Aeschlimann D. Kaupp O. Paulsson M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and the enzyme is thought to participate in matrix cross-linking before the tissue undergoes calcification (5Aeschlimann D. Wetterwald A. Fleisch H. Paulsson M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1461-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 6Aeschlimann D. Kaupp O. Paulsson M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The number of proteins serving as glutaminyl substrates for TG is restricted indicating the physiological importance of its functions (1Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). The roles of TG and the actions of its enzymatic products, meaning high molecular weight proteins, are still unclear. Osteopontin (OPN), a prominent and potentially multifunctional acidic phosphoglycoprotein (7Butler W.T. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 23: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 8Denhardt D.T. Guo X. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar), is a substrate of TG (9Prince C.W. Dickie D. Krumdieck C.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 10Sørensen E.S. Rasmussen L.K. Møller L. Jensen P.H. Højrup P. Petersen T.E. Biochem.

Biochem. 1994; 115: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). OPN is a major product of bone forming cells, osteoblasts, but is not specific to bone. It is also synthesized in other types of tissues and found in,e.g. inner ear, brain, kidney (7Butler W.T. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 23: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), and atherosclerotic plaques (13Fitzpatrick L.A. Severson A. Edwards W.D. Ingram R.T. J. Clin.

Dairy Res. 1993; 60: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and urine (15Shiraga H. Min W. VanDusen W.J. Clayman M.D. Miner D. Terrell C.H. Sherbotie J.R. Foreman J.W. Przysiecki C. Neilson E.G. Hoyer J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Its production is also related to immunity, infection, and cancer (8Denhardt D.T. Guo X. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Osteoblasts express OPN at an early developmental stage of bone formation (16Mark M.P. Prince C.W. Oosawa T. Gay S. Bronckers A.L.J.J. Butler W.T. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1987; 35: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 17Mark M.P. Butler W.T. Prince C.W. Finkelman R.D. Ruch J.-V. Differentation. 1988; 37: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In bone, OPN is deposited into unmineralized matrix prior to calcification and thereon localized at various tissue interfaces, e.g. cement lines, lamina limitans, and between collagen fibrils of fully matured hard tissues (18McKee M.D. Nanci A. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1996; 33: 141-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Recent knock-out mice experiments by Liaw et al. (19Liaw L. Birk D.E. Ballas C.B. Whitsitt J.S. Davidson J.M. Hogan B.L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1468-1478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that OPN, more specifically, functions in tissue repair, matrix organization, and collagen fibrillogenesis. The role of polymeric OPN, resulting from cross-linking by TG, is unknown. We have previously demonstrated that osteocalcin inhibits TG activity in vitro as measured by cross-linking of osteopontin (20Kaartinen M.T. Pirhonen A. Linnala-Kankkunen A. Mäenpää P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22736-22741Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Since recent gene knock-out experiments have demonstrated that osteocalcin is an inhibitor of bone formation (21Ducy P.

https://openalex.org/W2115316299,"We have used the synapses that isolated hippocampal cells in culture form onto themselves (autapses) to determine if some synapses lack functional AMPA receptors (AMPARs). A comparison of the synaptic variability of the AMPAR- and NMDAR-mediated evoked responses, as well as of miniature synaptic responses, indicates that a population of events exists that only contains an NMDAR component. Spillover of glutamate from adjacent synapses cannot explain these results because in single cell cultures all synaptic events mediated by AMPARs should be detected. Immunocytochemical analysis of these cultures clearly reveals a population of synapses with puncta for NR1 (NMDAR) but not for GluR1 (AMPAR). These results provide strong anatomical and physiological evidence for the existence of postsynaptically silent synapses."
https://openalex.org/W1979412265,"The cAMP signaling cascade has been implicated in several stages of memory formation. We have examined activation of this cascade by serotonin (5-HT) in the sensory neurons of Aplysia. We find that different patterns of 5-HT exposure induce three distinct modes of PKA activation. First, a single 5 min pulse induces transient (5 min) PKA activation that requires neither transcription nor translation. Second, 4-5 pulses induce intermediate-term persistent activation (3 hr duration) that requires translation but not transcription. Third, 5 pulses of 5-HT, as well as continuous (90 min) exposure, induce long-term persistent activation 20 hr later, which requires both transcription and translation. Thus, in the sensory neurons, different patterns of 5-HT give rise to three independent phases of PKA activation that differ in their induction requirements, their temporal profiles, and their molecular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2043027439,"We have previously demonstrated that interleukin-6 (IL-6) increases the levels of the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp-90) and activates the Hsp-90β promoter via the IL-6-activated transcription factors NF-IL6 and signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3). Here, we show that interferon-γ (IFN-γ) treatment increases the levels of Hsp-70 and Hsp-90 and also enhances the activity of the Hsp-70 and Hsp-90β promoters with these effects being dependent on activation of the STAT-1 transcription factor by IFN-γ. These effects were not seen in a STAT-1-deficient cell line, indicating that IFN-γ modulates Hsp induction via a STAT-1-dependent pathway. The effect of IFN-γ/STAT-1 was mediated via a short region of the Hsp-70/Hsp-90 promoters, which also mediates the effects of NF-IL6 and STAT-3 and can bind STAT-1. This region also contains a binding site for the stress-activated transcription factor HSF-1. We show that STAT-1 and HSF-1 interact with one another via a protein-protein interaction and produce a strong activation of transcription, which is in contrast to our previous finding that STAT-3 and HSF-1 antagonize one another. To our knowledge this is the first report of HSF-1 interacting directly via a protein-protein interaction with another transcription factor. Such protein-protein interactions and the binding of a number of different stress and cytokine-activated transcription factors to a short region of the Hsp-90 and Hsp-70 gene promoters are likely to play a very important role in Hsp gene activation by non-stressful stimuli and the integration of these responses with the stress response of these genes. We have previously demonstrated that interleukin-6 (IL-6) increases the levels of the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp-90) and activates the Hsp-90β promoter via the IL-6-activated transcription factors NF-IL6 and signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3).

The heat shock proteins (Hsps) are a group of proteins that were originally identified on the basis of their increased synthesis in cells exposed to elevated temperatures and subsequently were shown to be similarly induced by exposure of cells to a variety of stresses (1Yellon D.M. Latchman D.S. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1992; 24: 113-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar,2Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4419) Google Scholar). The induction of Hsps in response to various stresses is dependent on the activation of a specific transcription factor, the heat shock factor (HSF-1), 1The abbreviations used are: HSF, heat shock factor; IL, interleukin; IFN, interferon; HSE, heat shock element; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription. which binds to the heat shock element (HSE) in the promoters of Hsp genes (3Morimoto R. Science. 1993; 259: 1409-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). In addition, many Hsps are also expressed in unstressed cells, and their levels are regulated in response to a wide variety of biological processes such as T lymphocyte activation (4Haire R.N. Peterson M.S. O'Leary J.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and monocyte to macrophage differentiation (5Twomey B.M. McCallum S. Isenberg D.A. Latchman D.S. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1993; 93: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In general, however, the stimuli that induce such alteration in Hsp gene expression under non-stress conditions have been poorly characterized, and the mechanisms by which they act are unclear. We have recently shown, however, that treatment of human peripheral blood lymphocytes with interleukin-6 (IL-6) results in enhanced expression of the Hsp-90β gene (6Stephanou A. Amin V. Isenberg D.A. Akira S. Kishimoto T. Latchman D.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine with pleiotropic activities on a variety of cell types (7Akira S. Kishimoto T. Immunol. Rev. 1992; 127: 25-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). This property of IL-6 is dependent on the IL-6 receptor, which includes the glycoprotein 130 subunit that is shared among the other cytokine receptors belonging to the IL-6 receptor superfamily (leukemia inhibitory factor, IL-11, oncostatin M, and cardiotrophin-1) as well as a receptor chain, which is unique to the IL-6 receptor (8Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of IL-6 to its receptor is known to stimulate two distinct signaling pathways, resulting in the activation of two distinct transcription factors NF-IL6 (C/EBPβ) and STAT-3 (9Akira S. Nishio Y. Inoue M. Wang X.-J. Wei S. Matsusaka S. Yoshida K. Sudo T. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1994; 77: 63-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Both these factors have been shown to activate the Hsp-90β promoter and have a strong synergistic effect on its transcription resulting in its observed activation by IL-6. Interestingly, activation of the Hsp promoters by these factors is mediated via NF-IL6 and STAT-like binding sites that are located close to the HSE (10Stephanou A. Isenberg D.A. Akira S. Kishimoto T. Latchman D.S. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Moreover, the two transcription factors interact differently with HSF-1 and heat shock stress (10Stephanou A. Isenberg D.A. Akira S. Kishimoto T. Latchman D.S. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus activation of STAT-3 reduced the stimulatory effect of HSF-1 or heat stress, whereas activation of NF-IL6 enhanced it. These results are of interest because they demonstrate that a specific stimulus such as IL-6 can enhance the expression of the Hsp in non-heat-stressed cells in an HSF-1-independent manner and also indicate that others can functionally interact with HSF-1 and play a role in Hsp gene regulation. In view of the effect of the STAT-3 transcription factor on the Hsp-90β promoter, we wished to investigate whether the closely related STAT-1 factor would also have an effect. To do this we tested the effect of IFN-γ on Hsp gene expression. Like IL-6, IFN-γ is also a multifunctional cytokine that is known to have antiviral and antitumor properties by inducing specific IFN-γ-responsive genes (11Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1414-1417Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar,12Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). In contrast to IL-6, however, IFN-γ specifically activates the STAT-1 signaling pathway. In the present study, we report that IFN-γ treatment induced the expression of Hsp-70 and Hsp-90 in a STAT-1-dependent manner. In addition, overexpression of STAT-1 enhanced the activities of the Hsp-70 and Hsp-90β promoters. Interestingly, STAT-1 and HSF-1 were shown to have an additive effect in activating the Hsp-70 and Hsp-90β promoters and to directly interact via a protein-protein interaction. These studies have identified a composite response element that integrates the HSF-mediated heat shock response with IL-6 and IFN-γ signaling to mediate the differential regulation of Hsps. HepG2 hepatoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and maintained in 10% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. U3A and U3A-ST1 cells were kindly provided by Ian Kerr (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK). Recombinant IFN-γ was purchased from Autogen Bioclear, Wiltshire, UK. Antibodies to STAT-1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, and antibodies for Hsp-70, Hsp-90, and HSF-1 were purchased from StessGen (Victoria, BC, Canada). The 5′ Hsp-90β CAT reporter constructs A (−1044 to +36) and C (−299 to +36) were kindly provided by Neil Rebbe (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). The Hsp-70 CAT reporter constructs LSN (−188 to +1) and LSNP (−100 to +1) were kindly provided by Richard Morimoto (Northwestern University, Evanston, IL). The HSE/STAT-90 CAT was constructed by ligating the −643 to −623 fragment (5′-GCCTGGAAACTGCTGGAAAT-3′) of the Hsp-90β promoter into the heterologous reporter construct pBLCAT2, and the HSE/STAT-70 CAT was also constructed by ligating the −122 to −90 fragment of the Hsp-70 promoter (−122GATCCGGCGAAACCCCTGGAATATTCCCCGACCT−90) into the heterologous reporter construct pBLCAT2. The expression vector for HSF-1 was kindly provided by Carl Wu (NIH, Bethesda, MD). The expression plasmid-encoding STAT-1 was in pCAGGSneo-HAStat1. Transfection of reporter constructs was performed by the calcium phosphate method by using 10 μg of the reporter plasmid and 5 μg of the STAT-1 or the HSF-1 expression vectors. To assess and normalize for transfection efficiency, a β-galactosidase expression vector was also co-transfected. Protein concentration from cell lysates was also determined to equalize for protein content. HepG2 cells were treated with 10 ng/ml IFN-γ for 15 min or heat shocked for 30 min and harvested in cold phosphate-buffered saline. Nuclear extracts were prepared and examined for band shift as described previously (13Dent C.L. Latchman D.S. Latchman D.S. Transcription Factors, A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 1-26Google Scholar) with HSE-70 (−122GATCCGGCGAAACCCCTGGAATATTCCCCGACCT−90), HSE-90 (−643GCCTGGAAACTGCTGGAAAT−623), and a mutant HSE-90M (−643GCCcaGAAACTGCcaGAAAT−623, where underlining indicates bases that have been changed from wild-type to mutant-type) DNA probe. A 23-base pair high affinity SIEm67 (5′-GATCTGATTACGGGAAATG-3′) DNA probe that serves as a binding site for STAT-1 was used in competition studies. For supershift assays, nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-STAT-1 for 30 min prior to incubation with the DNA probe. Complexes were separated by 4% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and exposed to autoradiography. HepG2 cells (5 × 106) were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) and incubated with either anti-STAT-1 or anti-HSF-1 for 1 h at 4 °C on a shaking platform. Protein A-Sepharose was added to each tube and incubated further for 1 h. Complexes were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer, and 20 μl of sample buffer were added and boiled at 95 °C for 3 min. Samples were then electrophoresed on a 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred onto nitrocellulose filters, and subjected to Western blotting with either anti-STAT-1 or anti-HSF-1 antibodies. To test whether IFN-γ could stimulate the levels of Hsp in the IFN-γ-responsive HepG2 cell line, we treated these cells with IFN-γ and measured the Hsp-70 and Hsp-90 levels by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1, both Hsp-70 and Hsp-90 levels were increased by IFN-γ in a dose-dependent manner. 50 ng/ml IFN-γ resulted in an 8- and 6-fold induction in the levels of Hsp-70 and Hsp-90, respectively. To test whether this effect was mediated via a direct effect on the Hsp gene promoters, we transfected HepG2 cells with Hsp-70 and Hsp-90β promoter reporter constructs and treated the cells again with IFN-γ. As indicated in Fig. 2, IFN-γ stimulated the activities of the Hsp-70 and Hsp-90β promoters. These results suggest that IFN-γ is acting directly to increase Hsp-70 and Hsp-90 levels by activating the corresponding gene promoters. In other IFN-γ-responsive cell types, the effects of IFN-γ are mediated by the activation and phosphorylation of the STAT-1 pathway. We therefore determined whether overexpression of STAT-1 in HepG2 cells could also activate the Hsp-70 and Hsp-90β promoters. As illustrated in Fig. 2, co-transfection of an expression vector for STAT-1 resulted in enhanced stimulation of both Hsp-70 and Hsp-90β promoters upon addition of IFN-γ. In contrast, overexpression of STAT-1 alone caused only a modest stimulation of either promoter, suggesting that STAT-1 requires Janus kinase-STAT-1 activation and phosphorylation via IFN-γ for maximal Hsp promoter activation. To confirm that the effect of IFN-γ on the Hsp genes was mediated via STAT-1, we repeated the above experiments in the STAT-1-deficient cell line U3A. As shown in Fig. 3, INF-γ was unable to significantly enhance the levels of Hsp-70 and Hsp-90 in U3A cells. However, when STAT-1 was re-introduced into the STAT-1-deficient cells (U3AST1), INF-γ treatment enhanced the levels of both Hsp-70 and Hsp-90 (Fig. 3). Similar results were also obtained by transfection studies with the Hsp-70 and Hsp-90β promoters positively responding to IFN-γ in U3AST1 cells but not in the U3A cells (data not shown). Hence, the induction of Hsp-70 and Hsp-90 expression by IFN-γ is dependent upon STAT-1. As described previously, STAT-3-like binding sites are present on the Hsp-90β promoter in close proximity to the HSE (−643 to −623 base pairs) (10Stephanou A. Isenberg D.A. Akira S. Kishimoto T. Latchman D.S. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, analysis of the Hsp-70 promoter also indicated a similar STAT-3-like binding site close to the HSE (−110 to −90 base pairs) (Fig. 4). Because STAT-1 and -3 proteins recognize very similar binding sites, we investigated whether the IFN-γ signaling effect observed above is mediated by this same element by analyzing various Hsp-70 and Hsp-90β reporter constructs. As illustrated in Fig. 5 and Table I, by deleting the region of the Hsp-90β promoter from −1044 (construct A) down to −299 base pairs (construct C) we abolished the activation of the promoter by IFN-γ and STAT-1. In addition, a Hsp-70 construct that was deleted from −188 (construct LSN) to −100 (construct LSNP), resulting in the loss of the HSE-containing region, was unresponsive to IFN-γ and STAT-1 (Fig. 5and Table I). Hence, in both promoters, stimulation by IFN-γ is eliminated by deletions that remove the region of the promoter containing the HSE/STAT-like element, suggesting that this element is necessary in both the Hsp-90β and Hsp-70 gene promoters for them to respond to activated STAT-1 produced by IFN-γ.Figure 5Functional CAT activity of the full-length and truncated Hsp-70 and Hsp-90 reporter constructs, respectively, containing or lacking the STAT/HSE region in response to either IFN-γ or STAT-1 overexpression in HepG2 cells.

Open table in a new tab CAT activity is shown of the different length Hsp-70 and Hsp-90 reporter constructs and also the heterologous 70-HSE/STAT and 90-HSE/STAT reporter construct linked to the thymidine kinase promoter vector pBLCAT2 either untreated (−) or treated with 50 ng/ml IFN-γ (+) in HepG2 cells. CAT activity was assessed from a total of three experiments (mean + S.D.). To address this point further, oligonucleotides containing the HSE/STAT site in the Hsp-70 and Hsp-90β promoters were coupled to the heterologous thymidine kinase promoter and assessed for responsiveness to IFN-γ and STAT-1 activation. As shown in Table I, both HSE/STAT-Hsp-70 and HSE/STAT-Hsp-90β constructs conferred responsiveness to STAT-1 activation by IFN-γ to the heterologous promoter with similar induction being observed to that seen with the intact Hsp promoters. Hence this short region of either promoter can render a heterologous promoter inducible by IFN-γ and STAT-1. To demonstrate that the effect of STAT-1 on gene transcription via the HSE/STAT region was mediated via binding of STAT-1 to this region of both the Hsp-90β and Hsp-70 promoter, we examined the ability of IFN-γ to induce DNA binding of STAT-1 to the labeled 70- and 90-HSE/STAT oligonucleotides in band shift assays. The IFN-γ-activated site (GAS) m67SIE oligoprobe containing STAT-1 binding sites was used as a positive control. As shown in Fig.6, a low mobility-retarded band was obtained with both the 70- and 90- HSE/STAT probe, and the intensity of this band was enhanced in response to IFN-γ or heat shock. The binding observed was sequence-specific because it was competed with excess unlabeled probe but not with a nonspecific probe. In addition the retarded band was also competed with the unlabeled m67SIE oligonucleotide containing a consensus STAT-1 binding site, suggesting that the band was likely to contain STAT-1. This was confirmed by showing that the band was abolished by an addition of anti-STAT-1 antibody but not by an anti-STAT-3 antibody. Moreover, this band was also abolished by the addition of an antibody to HSF-1, indicating that it also contains HSF-1. Hence exposure to IFN-γ and/or heat shock results in the detection of a complex containing both STAT-1 and HSF-1, which binds to the HSE/STAT element in the Hsp-70 and Hsp-90 gene promoters. This complex was virtually abolished by mutation of the STAT site in the 90-HSE/STAT element (Fig. 6 C), indicating that the DNA binding of the complex containing the two transcription factors is strongly reduced by mutating the binding site for one of the two factors. In view of the finding that the response to IFN-γ/STAT-1 was mediated via binding sites adjacent to the HSF-1 region and formation of a DNA binding complex containing both STAT-1 and HSF-1, we wished to investigate whether the STAT-1 and HSF-1 pathways interacted with one another. To do this, we performed co-transfection studies in the U3A cell line (lacking endogenous STAT-1) with the Hsp reporter constructs together with expression vectors for STAT-1 or HSF-1 alone or together. Interestingly, STAT-1 and HSF-1 had an additive effect in activating both the Hsp-70 and Hsp-90β constructs compared with the effect of either factor alone (Fig. 7, Aand B). We also investigated whether a similar effect could be observed by exposing the cells to a heat shock stress, which activates HSF-1, alone or in combination with IFN-γ, which activates STAT-1. As shown in Fig. 8, Aand B, an additive effect was observed on both the Hsp-70 and Hsp-90 promoters when both HSF-1- and STAT-1-activating stimuli were given together compared with the effect with either stimulus alone. This suggests that although both factors are bound to the promoter following exposure to either stimulus alone, maximal activation is only observed when both stimuli are present, presumably resulting in the post-translational activation of both factors, for example by phosphorylation.Figure 8Functional CAT activity of the Hsp-70 (A) and Hsp-90β (B) reporter constructs in response to either heat shock (HS) at 42 °C alone or HS plus IFN-γ in U3A-ST1 cells. CAT activity assessed from a total of three experiments (mean ± S.D.) is shown. C, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The finding that the binding sites for HSF-1 and STAT-1 are close together and the formation of a DNA binding complex containing both factors suggest the possibility of a direct physical protein-protein interaction between HSF-1 and STAT-1. We therefore performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments by immunoprecipitating with anti-STAT-1 and then immunoblotting the precipitate with a specific antibody to HSF-1. As illustrated in Fig.9, a visible HSF-1-specific band was observed when cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with an anti-STAT-1 antibody, and the immunoprecipitate was then probed by Western blotting with anti-HSF-1. No HSF-1 band was observed by Western blotting after immunoprecipitating with an anti-STAT-3 antibody, although STAT-3 itself was readily detectable in the immunoprecipitate. Hence HSF-1 interacts specifically with STAT-1 but not with STAT-3. Although the mechanisms mediating the induction of Hsp genes by heat stress have been intensively studied (3Morimoto R.

Our previous reports (6Stephanou A. Amin V. Isenberg D.A. Akira S. Kishimoto T. Latchman D.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 10Stephanou A. Isenberg D.A. Akira S. Kishimoto T. Latchman D.S. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) together with our present study have analyzed the molecular mechanisms regulating Hsp gene expression by the cytokines IL-6 and IFN-γ. Thus, IL-6 has been demonstrated to induce the expression of Hsp-90 via signaling pathways activating the transcription factors STAT-3 and NF-IL6 (10Stephanou A. Isenberg D.A. Akira S. Kishimoto T. Latchman D.S. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that IFN-γ is also able to activate the promoters for Hsp-70 and Hsp-90β via the STAT-1 signaling pathway. Furthermore, a short sequence in both the Hsp-70 and Hsp-90β promoter containing the HSE and also incorporating a STAT-like binding site is important for mediating IL-6 and IFN-γ signaling. Regulatory sequences of eukaryotic genes commonly contain binding sites for multiple transcription factors and provide a basis for combinatorial interactions between different factors. These regions are usually referred to as composite response elements that mediate the integration of multiple regulatory signals. Our study provides another example of such a composite response element on both the Hsp-70 and Hsp-90β promoters and identifies this element as critical for the responses to cytokines such as IL-6 and IFN-γ as well as to stressful stimuli such as heat shock. Our previous work demonstrated that the Hsp-90β promoter appears to have a novel pattern of inducibility, which is dependent upon STAT-3 and NF-IL6 (10Stephanou A. Isenberg D.A. Akira S. Kishimoto T. Latchman D.S. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This finding renders the promoter distinct from those of the liver acute phase protein genes that appear to fall into two separate classes and are regulated either by the MAPK/NF-IL6 signaling pathways (7Akira S. Kishimoto T. Immunol. Rev. 1992; 127: 25-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) or by the Janus kinase/STAT-3 pathway (12Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar, 15Ganter U. Arcone R. Toniatti C. Morrone G. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3773-3779Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). It is possible that this difference may reflect the tissue-specific expression of acute phase protein genes in the liver compared with constitutive expression of Hsp-90 in all cell types. The complexity of the composite response elements in both the Hsp-70 and Hsp-90β promoter is illustrated further by the observation that both STAT-1 and -3 (10Stephanou A. Isenberg D.A. Akira S. Kishimoto T. Latchman D.S. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) cooperate with NF-IL6 to induce the activity of the promoters. Moreover, STAT-1 and HSF-1 have an additive effect on Hsp-70 and Hsp-90β promoters, and protein binding studies have shown that HSF-1 and STAT-1 interact and form a DNA binding complex, which binds to the HSE/STAT element in both promoters. HSFs (HSF-1 to -4) have been cloned from a number of organisms and their roles have been characterized. Only HSF-1 has been shown to be involved in regulating Hsp in response to heat stress, whereas HSF-2, -3, and -4 may be involved in Hsp gene regulation under non-heat stress conditions, for example during cellular differentiation (16Morimoto R.I. Jurivich D.A. Kroeger P.E. Mathur S.K. Murphy S.P. Nakai A. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. Sistonen L.T. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). HSF-1 is present in the cytoplasm as a monomer and is maintained in a non-DNA binding state in unstressed cells. In response to heat shock, HSF-1 undergoes conformational changes and forms a trimer that is able to bind to the HSEs on Hsp promoters. HSF-1 has also been recently demonstrated to regulate the IL-1 promoter under non-heat stress conditions (18Cahil C.M. Waterman W.R. Xie Y. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24874-24879PubMed Google Scholar). Our present results have also shown that HSF-1 interacts with other transcription factors to modulate Hsp promoter activity under non-heat stress conditions. These studies suggest that HSF-1 is able to modulate promoter activity in the absence of physiological stress. A number of studies have demonstrated that transcriptional activity is attained by protein-protein interaction of transcription factors on DNA response elements. Recently HSF-3 and c-Myb have been reported to interact physically, and such interaction may be important in the regulation of Hsp gene expression during cellular proliferation (19Kanie-Ishii C. Tanikawa J. Nakai A. Morimoto R.I. Ishii S. Science. 1997; 277: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our results are the first demonstration of HSF-1 forming a direct protein-protein interaction with another transcription factor, STAT-1, and suggest that the effect of HSF-1 and STAT-1 on the Hsp promoters may require such physical interaction. Thus, in contrast to the additive effect of STAT-1 and HSF-1, STAT-3 and HSF-1 appear to have a mutually antagonistic effect. Although STAT-3 and HSF-1 can individually activate the Hsp-90β promoter, such activation is greatly reduced in the presence of both factors together (10Stephanou A. Isenberg D.A. Akira S. Kishimoto T. Latchman D.S. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interestingly, unlike STAT-1 and HSF-1, STAT-3 and HSF-1 do not interact with one another in the same conditions where a STAT-1/HSF-1 interaction can be demonstrated (Fig. 8). It is possible therefore that HSF-1 and STAT-3 compete for binding to the short Hsp promoter region that contains both of these binding sites resulting in an antagonistic effect. In contrast, the protein-protein interaction between STAT-1 and HSF-1 may facilitate binding of both factors to the promoter leading to enhanced activation of transcription. Although the sequence of the STAT-like binding site located around the HSE region of both the Hsp-70 and Hsp-90β promoter does not fully match the previously characterized STAT-1 binding site ATTNNNNAAT (12Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar), there is evidence that the consensus STAT binding site on other genes characterized recently may not match fully, for example CTGGNAA, which is found in the promoter of the CD14 binding protein gene (20Schumann R.R. Kirschning C.J. Unbehaun A. Aberle H. Knopf H.-P. Lamping H.-P. Ulevitch R.J. Herrmann F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3490-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The ability of STAT-1 to bind to the sequence in the Hsp-70 and Hsp-90 promoters has been directly confirmed in our experiments where the protein binding to this element in IFN-γ-treated cells was identified as STAT-1 on the basis of its reactivity with anti-STAT-1 antibody and its removal with competitor oligonucleotide containing a consensus STAT-1 binding site. From our previous and present data, it is clear therefore that the Hsp-70 and Hsp-90β promoters contain a composite response element that is able to integrate multiple regulatory signals and allow different transcription factors to interact with each other to have either a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on transcriptional activation. Preliminary analysis of other Hsp promoters in different species shows similar sequences with potential binding sites for STATs and NF-IL6 around the HSE and suggests that such a region has been conserved during evolution. This conserved element may thus be of critical importance in regulating the activation of Hsp genes by non-stressful stimuli and integrate the responses with their responses to stressful stimuli.

The MCL1 member of the BCL2 family is up-regulated during the induction of monocytic differentiation (∼10-fold with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA)). MCL1 has effects similar to those ofBCL2, up-regulation promoting viability, but differs fromBCL2 in its rapid inducibility and its pattern of expression. Nuclear factors that regulate MCL1transcription have now been identified, extending the previous demonstration of signal transduction through mitogen-activated protein kinase.

This finding provides a parallel to early response genes (e.g. c-FOSand EGR1) that affect maturation commitment in these cells and therefore suggests a means through which enhancement of cell viability may be linked to the induction of differentiation.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In sum, a rapid, transient increase in the expression MCL1, but notBCL2, occurs during the early stages of TPA-induced ML-1 cell differentiation.The increase in MCL1 seen in the early stages of TPA-induced ML-1 cell differentiation is representative of the high levels of expression seen at early stages of myeloid differentiation in a variety of systems, including cell lines as well as differentiating cells in the intact animal. In ML-1 cells, MCL1 expression increases in response to other inducers of monocyte differentiation, but not an inducer of granulocyte differentiation (6Yang T. Buchan H.L. Townsend K.J. Craig R.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). MCL1 expression can also be induced in other cell lines of myeloid origin, such as HL-60, THP-1, U-937, and K-562, and has recently been shown to increase in response to the myelomonocytic growth factor, granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (9Chao J.-R.

The high levels of expression seen in induced cell lines has a counterpart in the bone marrow in vivo, where MCL1 expression is high in myeloid cells at early stages of differentiation (10Krajewski S.

Overall,MCL1 is a readily inducible gene in a variety of myeloid systems, prominently expressed at immature stages of differentiation.Gene transfer experiments have demonstrated that MCL1 has viability-enhancing effects. Thus, MCL1 was transfected into a murine myeloid progenitor cell line, FDC-P1, as the ML-1 human myeloid cell line from which the gene was isolated cannot be transfected in a stable fashion. Here, MCL1 was found to prolong the survival of cells exposed to a variety of apoptosis-inducing stimuli (4Zhou P. Qian L. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. Blood. 1997; 89: 630-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar effects were seen in Chinese hamster ovary cells (2Reynolds J.E. Yang T. Qian L. Jenkinson J.D. Zhou P. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6348-6352PubMed Google Scholar, 3Reynolds J.E. Li J. Craig R.W. Eastman A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these effects were of short duration, cells expressing the transfected MCL1 gene product living about twice as long as controls but not as long as cells transfected with BCL2 (2Reynolds J.E. Yang T. Qian L. Jenkinson J.D. Zhou P. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6348-6352PubMed Google Scholar). Short term viability-enhancing effects, very similar to those seen in transfected cell lines, have also recently been observed in lymphoid cells from MCL1 transgenic mice (11Zhou P. Qian L. Bieszczad C.K. Noelle R. Binder M. Levy N.B. Craig R.W. Blood. 1998; 92: 3226-3239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In other experiments, MCL1 was found to be a rapidly turned over PEST protein (half-life of <3 h), providing another contrast to the more stable BCL2 protein (Ref. 5Yang T. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar and references therein). Taken together, these findings led us to hypothesize that MCL1 may serve as a mediator of cell viability that can be rapidly induced, albeit in some cases for short term effects, at specific stages in the cell life cycle, as exemplified by the increase seen in early monocytic differentiation.MCL1 exhibits a differentiation stage-specific pattern of expression in lymphoid as well as myeloid cells. For example, in B cells at early stages of immortalization with an Epstein-Barr virus gene product, MCL1 expression increases rapidly and transiently (12Wang S. Rowe M. Lundgren E. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4610-4613PubMed Google Scholar). This increase precedes a stable increase inBCL2 and thus has again been postulated to mediate short-term protection of viability. MCL1 expression also increases in response to a variety of B cell growth, differentiation, and activation factors (13Li L. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Choi Y.S. Cell. Immunol. 1997; 178: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 14Lomo J. Blomhoff H.K. Jacobsen S.E. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Smeland E.B. Blood. 1997; 89: 4415-4424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, MCL1expression is selectively increased during interleukin-6-induced differentiation of Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized cells and is subsequently decreased as differentiated cells undergo apoptosis (15Altmeyer A. Simmons R.C. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Bornkamm G.W. Chen-Kiang S. Immunity. 1997; 7: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Likewise, in peripheral blood lymphocytes placed in tissue culture,MCL1 (but not BCL2) expression correlates with survival and loss of MCL1 expression with apoptosis (16Lomo J. Smeland E.B. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Blomhoff H.K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 40-43PubMed Google Scholar). In lymphoid tissues in the intact animal, MCL1 expression is abundant in the germinal center, where cells proliferate and undergo affinity maturation, but is scant in the small, resting cells in the mantle zone (10Krajewski S. Bodrug S. Krajewska M. Shabaik A. Gascoyne R. Berean K. Reed J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1309-1319PubMed Google Scholar). BCL2 demonstrates the opposite pattern, expression being low in germinal centers and abundant in the mantle zone. Overall, MCL1 exhibits a highly regulated pattern of expression, different from that of BCL2, in a variety of hematopoietic cells. Opposing patterns of expression of MCL1and BCL2 can also be seen in non-hematopoietic tissues, as in a variety of epithelial tissues where BCL2 is expressed at immature and MCL1 at mature stages of differentiation (10Krajewski S. Bodrug S. Krajewska M. Shabaik A. Gascoyne R. Berean K. Reed J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1309-1319PubMed Google Scholar).We have been studying the mechanisms that underlie the rapid inducibility and highly regulated pattern of expression ofMCL1, using human hematopoietic cell lines that can be induced to differentiate with TPA as a model. Our previous studies showed that the increase in MCL1 expression involves an increase in transcription but does not require new protein synthesis (6Yang T. Buchan H.L. Townsend K.J. Craig R.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Recent studies further showed that the signal for increasedMCL1 expression is transduced through the ERK branch of the MAP kinase family (17Townsend K.J. Trusty J.L. Traupman M.A. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This signaling pathway is involved both in maintaining basal MCL1 expression and in bringing about the increased expression seen in response to TPA. Thus, cells treated with a specific, non-toxic inhibitor of this pathway (PD 98059 (18Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar)) exhibit a decrease from the already low base-line MCL1 levels, and cells treated with PD 98059 plus TPA exhibit MCL1 levels in the range of those seen in untreated control cells.Two lines of evidence indicate that, while the base-line levels of MCL1 in ML-1 and other immature hematopoietic cell lines are below the threshold necessary for effects, the increased levels seen in cells exposed to TPA contribute to viability enhancement. First, gene transfer experiments showed that low levels of MCL1, in the range of the base-line level in the cell lines, had marginal if any effects; in contrast, higher levels, in the range of those seen after TPA treatment, promoted cell viability (4Zhou P. Qian L. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. Blood. 1997; 89: 630-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, use of PD 98059 to inhibit MCL1 expression yielded the following results (17Townsend K.J. Trusty J.L. Traupman M.A. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). When the inhibitor was applied alone, a further decrease from the already low basal MCL1 level occurred but was not accompanied by cell death, indicating that this low level does not contribute to the maintenance of viability. When the inhibitor was applied in conjunction with TPA, MCL1 was expressed at a level equivalent to the low basal level in untreated control cells (instead of an ∼10-fold higher level), and cells died by apoptosis rather than undergoing differentiation. These observations bolstered the hypothesis that, in immature myeloid cells, up-regulation of MCL1 serves to enhance cell viability during the initiation of differentiation (17Townsend K.J. Trusty J.L. Traupman M.A. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).The research described here was aimed at building on previous work on the signal transduction pathway (17Townsend K.J. Trusty J.L. Traupman M.A. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), by identifying transcription factors involved in regulating MCL1. Of particular interest were factors meaningful in terms of regulation for anti-apoptotic effects, such as those that contribute to the TPA-induced 7–10-fold increase from a subthreshold basal level to a level capable of promoting viability. Initially, a 162-bp segment of the humanMCL1 5′-flank was found to mimic, in transient reporter assays, the behavior of the endogenous gene (i.e. activity was increased 10-fold by TPA, and this increase was inhibited by PD 98059). The transcription factors SRF and Elk-1 bound to cognate sites within this segment (in the vicinity of bp −107), and Sp1 bound to a site between the other two. Inactivation of the SRF and Ets sites resulted in reporter activity in the presence of TPA that was 7–11-fold lower than that of the wild-type plasmid (i.e. it was in the range of wild-type activity in the absence of TPA). This was analogous to the previous finding that inhibition of the ERK pathway resulted in endogenous MCL1 expression in the presence of TPA being maintained at untreated control levels, which were below the threshold for anti-apoptotic effects (17Townsend K.J. Trusty J.L. Traupman M.A. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The present and previous (6Yang T. Buchan H.L. Townsend K.J. Craig R.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar,9Chao J.-R. Wang J.-M. Lee S.-F. Peng H.-W. Lin Y.-H. Chou C.-H. Li J.-C. Huang H.-M. Chou C.-K. Kuo M.-L. Yen J.J.-Y. Yang-Yen H.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4883-4898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) findings indicate that MCL1 expression is increased by various agents that promote the viability and proliferation/differentiation of cells at immature stages of myelomonocytic differentiation. The mechanism of MCL1up-regulation by one of these agents, TPA, involves signal transduction through ERKs and transcriptional activation by SRF and Elk-1. This finding provides a parallel to early response genes such as c-FOS and EGR1, which influence the commitment of immature myelomonocytic cells to maturation (20Krishnaraju K. Nguyen H.Q. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5499-5507Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 21Lord K.A. Abdollahi A. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 841-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 22Nguyen T.T. Scimeca J.C. Filloux C. Peraldi P. Carpentier J.L. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol.

Regulation ofMCL1 through a similar mechanism therefore suggests a means through which enhancement of viability may be linked to the induction of differentiation.DISCUSSIONOur interest in the mechanisms that control expression ofMCL1 stemmed from its highly regulated pattern of expression and from the fact that expression level is a major determinant of the ability of this gene to promote cell viability (4Zhou P. Qian L. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. Blood. 1997; 89: 630-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Townsend K.J. Trusty J.L. Traupman M.A. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). MCL1can be rapidly up-regulated and subsequently down-regulated, is expressed at specific stages of differentiation, and differs fromBCL2 in its expression pattern (1Kozopas K.M. Yang T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P. Craig R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 5Yang T. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. J.

Pathol. 1995; 146: 1309-1319PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases, early induction of MCL1 precedes more long term changes inBCL2 (5Yang T. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 12Wang S. Rowe M. Lundgren E. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4610-4613PubMed Google Scholar), and the viability-enhancing effects ofMCL1 appear short-lived compared with those ofBCL2 (2Reynolds J.E. Yang T. Qian L. Jenkinson J.D. Zhou P. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6348-6352PubMed Google Scholar, 3Reynolds J.E. Li J. Craig R.W. Eastman A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 4Zhou P. Qian L. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. Blood. 1997; 89: 630-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that the unique physiologic role of MCL1 within the BCL2family may relate to its ability to provide rapidly inducible, albeit somewhat short term, enhancement of cell viability at specific stages of the cell life cycle.We have used cultured human hematopoietic cell lines, such as ML-1 and K-562, to study the pathway(s) involved in MCL1regulation. The low levels of endogenous MCL1 in these cells are up-regulated ∼7–10-fold in the presence of TPA, which causes subthreshold expression to increase into the range capable of promoting viability. Previous studies demonstrated that the signal for this increase was transduced through the ERK pathway. Upon inhibition of this pathway, MCL1 expression did not increase above the basal level, and cells exposed to TPA died instead of remaining viable and undergoing differentiation (17Townsend K.J. Trusty J.L. Traupman M.A. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).The present work was aimed at identifying transcription factors that play a role in the regulation of MCL1, to extend the signal transduction studies. We identified a 162-bp segment of the humanMCL1 5′-flank that could mimic the above-described pattern of endogenous MCL1 expression in that it allowed an ∼10-fold increase in reporter activity in response to TPA which was suppressed by an inhibitor of ERK activation. A region within this segment (centered on bp −107) appeared particularly important for both basal and TPA-induced activity. This region contained sites that bound the transcription factors SRF and Elk-1, with an Sp1 site lying between these two. Mutation of these sites revealed that the coordinate actions of SRF and Ets accounted for a substantial proportion (about two-thirds) of both basal activity and induction by TPA, whereas Sp1 affected basal activity only. Loss of about two-thirds of the inducibility by TPA (i.e. a decrease from ∼10- to ∼3- to 4-fold induction) was a common theme, as it was also seen upon truncation to bp −107 or upon the addition of PD 98059 prior to TPA induction of wild-type plasmids. As a result of this loss of both basal activity and TPA inducibility, the activity of a ΔSRE/ΔEts mutant plasmid in the presence of TPA was equivalent to wild-type activity in the absence of TPA. This paralleled the previous observation that, upon inhibition of the ERK pathway, endogenous MCL1 levels in the presence of TPA were equivalent to those seen in untreated control cells, levels that were below the threshold necessary for anti-apoptotic effects (17Townsend K.J. Trusty J.L. Traupman M.A. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The simplest model to account for these findings is thatMCL1 can be regulated through a mechanism similar to that utilized by early response genes, where signal transduction is through MAP kinase and transcriptional activation is through an SRF·Ets complex (19Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 37Zinck R. Hipskind R.A. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2377-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).The mechanism of SRF/Ets-mediated transcriptional activation has been studied extensively in the case of c-FOS. From a series of experiments, a model has emerged suggesting that SRF and Ets constitutively associate with the cognate binding sites in DNA (19Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 37Zinck R. Hipskind R.A. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2377-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar,43Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). MAP kinase-induced phosphorylation of the Ets component of the bound SRF·Ets complex is thought to produce increased transcription (Refs. 19Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 37Zinck R. Hipskind R.A. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2377-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 38Herrera R.E.

Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Since both the unphosphorylated and the phosphorylated complex can bind DNA, identical EMSA complexes are frequently seen with nuclear extracts from unstimulated and stimulated cells (37Zinck R. Hipskind R.A. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2377-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 41Fisch T.M. Prywes R. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell.

Nordheim A. Baccarini M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1803-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This is what we observed in the case ofMCL1, using nuclear extracts from untreated and TPA-treated cells. The finding of equivalent EMSA complexes also relates to the fact that, because of the high molecular weight of the SRF·Ets complex, phosphorylation of the bound complex generally does not result in a detectable alteration in mobility. A phosphorylation dependent mobility shift can be detected in systems utilizing an artificially truncated “core” SRF of lower molecular weight (37Zinck R. Hipskind R.A. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2377-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), systems that were beyond the scope of the present studies. In the case ofMCL1, untreated and TPA-treated cells exhibited not only equivalent EMSA complexes but also equivalent DNase I-hypersensitive sites in the MCL1 5′-flank (carried out using the methods described in Ref. 26Lowrey C.H. Bodine D.M. Nienhuis A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1143-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, MCL1 may exist in a “competent” or “pre-activated” state (62Blackwood E.M. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1998; 281: 60-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), which would agree with the fact that MCL1 is expressed, albeit at low levels, in unstimulated cells. Overall, although our studies of MCL1are not as extensive as those of c-FOS, they are consistent with the model developed for c-FOS in which SRF and Ets can bind constitutively to the cognate sites in DNA and be activated through MAP kinase.What is the significance of the finding that MCL1 can be regulated by an ERK-mediated signal transduction pathway (17Townsend K.J. Trusty J.L. Traupman M.A. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and SRF/Elk-1-mediated transcriptional activation? Early response genes regulated through MAP kinases and SRF/Ets proteins are expressed during the induction of differentiation and/or the stimulation of proliferation. These genes appear important to these processes as, for example, c-FOS can increase the probability of differentiation in myelomonocytic cell lines, whereas EGR1is critical for differentiation along the monocyte lineage (20Krishnaraju K. Nguyen H.Q. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5499-5507Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 21Lord K.A. Abdollahi A. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Mol. Cell.

Regulation of MCL1 through an SRF/Elk-1-mediated mechanism might then be speculated to serve as a means of linking control of viability to critical steps within the differentiation continuum. For example, some early response genes have apoptosis-inducing effects in immature myeloid cells (see Refs. 20Krishnaraju K. Nguyen H.Q. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Mol. Cell.

We identified the mutated gene as the putative transcriptional activator and ATPase/DNA helicase previously described as Smbp2, Rip1, Gf1, or Catf1. Mutations were found in two alleles-a single amino acid deletion in nmdJ and a splice donor mutation in nmd2J. The selective vulnerability of motor neurons is striking in view of the widespread expression of this gene, although the pattern of degeneration may reflect a specific threshold since neither allele is null. In addition, the severity of the nmd phenotype is attenuated in a semidominant fashion by a major genetic locus on chromosome (Chr) 13. The identification of the nmd gene and mapping of a major suppressor provide new opportunities for understanding mechanisms of motor neuron degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2154757918,"The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a proteinaceous structure formed between pairs of homologous chromosomes during prophase I of meiosis. The proper assembly of axial elements (AEs), lateral components of the SC, during meiosis in the yeast,Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is essential for wild-type levels of recombination and for the accurate segregation of chromosomes at the first meiotic division. Genetic experiments have indicated that the stoichiometry between two meiosis-specific components of AEs inS. cerevisiae, HOP1 and RED1, is critical for proper assembly and function of the SC. A third meiosis-specific gene, MEK1, which encodes a putative serine/threonine protein kinase, is also important for proper AE function, suggesting that AE formation is regulated by phosphorylation. In this paper, we demonstrate that Mek1p is a functional kinasein vitro and that catalytic activity is an essential part of the meiotic function of Mek1 in vivo. Immunoblot analysis revealed that Red1p is aMEK1-dependent phosphoprotein. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the interaction between Hop1p and Red1p is enhanced by the presence ofMEK1. Thus, MEK1-dependent phosphorylation of Red1p facilitates the formation of Hop1p/Red1p hetero-oligomers, thereby enabling the formation of functional AEs.

Sexual reproduction requires the formation of haploid gametes so that fertilization can reconstitute the diploid chromosome number of the organism. The chromosome number of the cell is divided precisely in half by meiosis, a highly conserved and specialized type of cell division. Specifically, the reduction in chromosome number is accomplished by the segregation of homologous chromosomes to opposite poles at the first meiotic division. Proper disjunction requires crossovers (typically manifested cytologically as chiasmata) that provide the physical connections between homologs necessary for proper orientation on the Meiosis I spindle (1Bascom-Slack C.A.

Mutants that interfere with the formation of crossovers produce chromosomally imbalanced gametes that are either inviable themselves or fuse to create inviable zygotes (2Roeder G.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2600-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). In most organisms, two requirements must be met for wild-type levels of crossovers to occur during meiosis. First, there must be recombination machinery to physically exchange the DNA from non-sister chromatids. Second, a tripartite proteinaceous structure called the synaptonemal complex (SC) 1The abbreviations used are: SC, synaptonemal complex; AE, axial element; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase(s); PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 1The abbreviations used are: SC, synaptonemal complex; AE, axial element; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase(s); PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. must form between homologous chromosomes (3Von Wettstein D. Rasmussen S.W. Holm P.B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1984; 18: 331-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 4Heyting C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). SC formation is initiated by the condensation of sister chromatids along a protein core called an axial element (AE). Synapsis occurs when AEs are held together by the introduction of central region components to make mature SCs. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, deletion of RED1, a gene encoding a component of AEs, eliminates AE formation and thereforered1 mutant phenotypes may indicate functions for AEs (5Rockmill B. Roeder G.S. Genetics. 1990; 126: 563-574PubMed Google Scholar). In red1 diploids, spore viability is drastically reduced, despite only a 4-fold reduction in crossing over, suggesting a role for AEs in packaging crossovers in such a way that the chiasmata can be used for directing Meiosis I chromosome segregation (5Rockmill B. Roeder G.S. Genetics. 1990; 126: 563-574PubMed Google Scholar, 6Mao-Draayer Y. Galbraith A.M. Pittman D.L. Cool M. Malone R.E. Genetics. 1996; 144: 71-86PubMed Google Scholar).RED1 also plays a role in a checkpoint that monitors whether recombination is progressing correctly or not. For example, mutations in the meiosis-specific recA homolog DMC1 cause arrest prior to the first meiotic division, presumably as a result of the formation of aberrant recombination intermediates (7Bishop D.K. Park D. Xu L. Kleckner N. Cell. 1992; 69: 439-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). In the absence ofRED1, this arrest is abolished despite the fact that the aberrant recombination intermediates are still being generated. It appears, therefore, that the packaging of recombination intermediates into some sort of RED1-dependent chromosomal structure is necessary for the recombination-monitoring checkpoint to work (8Xu L. Weiner B.M. Kleckner N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 106-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Understanding AE assembly is clearly a key to understanding axial element function. Genetic and cytological experiments have identified two other meiosis-specific genes, HOP1 and MEK1(also known as MRE4), that are important for formation of functional AEs in yeast. Evidence that the stoichiometry of Red1p to Hop1p is important in axial element formation comes from genetic experiments in which overexpression of RED1 in the presence of limiting amounts of Hop1p created a dominant negative phenotype (9Friedman D.B. Hollingsworth N.M. Byers B. Genetics. 1994; 136: 449-464PubMed Google Scholar). This dominant negative phenotype can also be produced by overexpressingRED1 in the presence of wild-type levels of HOP1but with limiting amounts of functional Mek1p (10Hollingsworth N.M. Ponte L. Genetics. 1997; 147: 33-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mek1p therefore appears to influence the Hop1p:Red1p stoichiometry. This paper presents biochemical data supporting the model that the interaction of Hop1p and Red1p with each other is promoted by phosphorylation of Red1p by Mek1p (10Hollingsworth N.M. Ponte L. Genetics. 1997; 147: 33-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genotypes of the strains used in this study are shown in Table I. All the strains are isogenic derivatives of the SK1-related diploid NH144 (11Hollingsworth N.M. Ponte L. Halsey C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1728-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Diploid strains mutated for RED1 or MEK1were created by first transforming S2683 and RKY1145, the two haploid parents of NH144, with the appropriate DNA fragments (12Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar) followed by mating. For the red1::LEU2 mutation, a 4.9-kbBglII/PstI fragment was purified from pNH119 (13Hollingsworth N.M. Johnson A.D. Genetics. 1993; 133: 785-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and used for transformation. This insertion allele exhibits a null phenotype with respect to spore viability (other phenotypes have not been tested). A 3.6-kb XbaI/BamHI fragment from pTS1 carries the mek1Δ::LEU2 allele, and a 2.9-kb BamHI fragment from pTS21 was used to introducemek1Δ::URA3. These deletions remove 75 base pairs upstream of the ATG as well as approximately 75% of theMEK1 coding sequence. The presence of thered1::LEU2,mek1Δ::LEU2, andmek1Δ::URA3 alleles was confirmed both genetically and by Southern blot analysis. The ade2-Bglmutation was introduced by two-step gene replacement (12Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar) using pR943 (generously supplied by B. Rockmill, Yale University) cut withSpeI. Haploids containing the ade2-Bgl mutation and appropriate other markers were obtained by crosses. These haploids were then mated to give homozygous diploids. The mek1–974mutation was introduced into two differentmek1Δ::LEU2 haploids by two-step gene replacement using pNH235 digested with BssHI to target integration to the mek1Δ::LEU2 locus. Leu− 5FoaR colonies were then mated to create the mek1–974 diploid NH211. The red1::LEU2 mek1Δ::LEU2 homozygous diploid NH177 was constructed by crossing a MATa mek1Δ::LEU2 haploid with MATα red1::LEU2 haploid and dissecting tetrads from the resulting heterozygous diploid. Leu+ spore colonies that exhibited a non-parental di-type pattern for LEU2 were then mated to produce the double homozygote. To make theRED1–3HA homozygous diploid YTS3::pTS23, S2683red1 and RKY1145red1 were transformed with pTS23 digested withStuI to target integration of the plasmid toURA3. The resulting transformants were mated to create the diploid. For YTS1:pLP36 and YTS1::pLP37, the plasmids pLP36 and pLP37 were digested with StuI to target integration toURA3 and transformed into YTS1. Standard yeast genetic methods were used (14Rose M.D. Winston F. Heiter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A laboratory course manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Solid media have been described (15Vershon A.K. Hollingsworth N.M. Johnson A.D. Mol. Cell.

Sporulation was performed using 2% potassium acetate.Table ISaccharomyces cerevisiae SK1 strainsNameGenotypeRKY1145MAT a leu2Δ::hisG his4-x lys2 ura3 hoΔ::LYS2S2683MATα leu2-K lys2 ura3 hoΔ::LYS2 arg4-NspNH144MATa leu2Δ:: hisG his4-x lys2ura3hoΔ::LYS2 ARG4MATα leu2-K HIS4 lys2 ura3 hoΔ::LYS2 arg4-NspYTS1same as NH144 exceptmek1Δ:: LEU2mek1Δ::LEU2YTS1::pLP36same as YTS1 exceptura3::mek1-K199R::URA3YTS1::pLP37same as YTS1 exceptura3::MEK1::URA3YTS3same as NH144 except red1:: LEU2red1::LEU2YTS3::pTS23same as YTS3 exceptura3:: RED1–3HA::URA3ura3::RED1–3HA::URA3YTS4same as NH144 exceptmek1Δ:: URA3mek1Δ::URA3NH177same as NH144 exceptred1:: LEU2mek1Δ::LEU2red1::LEU2 mek1Δ::LEU2NH211same as NH144 exceptmek1–974ade2-Bglmek1–974 ade2-BglDW10same as NH144 excepthop1:: LEU2 RED1–3HAhop1::LEU2 RED1–3HA Open table in a new tab Plasmids for this study were made by standard procedures (16Maniatis T.

To construct themek1Δ::URA3 andmek1Δ::LEU2 deletion alleles, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to generate fragments ofURA3 or LEU2 with SacI andPvuII ends.

Open table in a new tab To fuse the MEK1 gene to GST (glutathioneS-transferase) (18Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar), PCR was employed to generate a fragment containing the entire MEK1 gene. The resulting fragment was digested with BglII and ligated into theBamHI site of pRD56 to create pNH168. The mek1-K199R mutation was introduced into theGST-MEK1 fusion gene by oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis (19Smith M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1985; 19: 423-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The 2.9-kb NotI/SalI fragment from pNH168 containing GAL1p-GST-MEK1 was cloned intoNotI/SalI-digested pVZ1 to generate pNH205. The presence of the mutation creates an FspI restriction site that was used for screening plasmids with the desired mutation. The plasmid containing the mek1-K199R allele was designated pNH206. To place the GST-MEK1 and GST-mek1-K199R alleles under control of the MEK1 promoter, the MEK1promoter was first cloned into the 2μ vector, YEplac181. A 924-bp fragment starting at position −896 relative to the MEK1 ATG and ending at +28 was amplified by PCR. The oligonucleotide was engineered to put an NdeI site at the ATG of MEK1with a SalI site downstream. The fragment was digested withBamHI and SalI and ligated intoBamHI/SalI-digested YEplac181 to make pDW14. The 2.9-kb NdeI/SalI fragments containing eitherGST-MEK1 (pNH168) or GST-mek1-K199R (pNH206) were then cloned into pDW14 cut with NdeI and SalI to make pDW15 and pDW16, respectively. The MEK1 andmek1-K199R alleles were completely sequenced to confirm that no unknown mutations were introduced by either the PCR or site-directed mutagenesis. Sequencing was performed using the ABI Amplitaq sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer) followed by electrophoresis on an ABI model 373A automated sequencer. To assay for complementation of the mek1Δ bymek1-K199R, both the MEK1 andmek1-K199R alleles were put under control of theMEK1 promoter without the GST fusion. To accomplish this, a 5.5-kb EcoRI fragment from pR4C4 (10Hollingsworth N.M. Ponte L. Genetics. 1997; 147: 33-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was first cloned intoEcoRI-digested pVZ1 to generate pLP31. After digestion of pLP31 with SpeI and SalI, the vector backbone was ligated with the 1.2-kb SpeI/SalI fragment from either pNH206 or pNH168, resulting in the substitution of approximately 80% of the MEK1 coding sequence. The resulting plasmids, pLP34 (mek1-K199R) and pLP35 (MEK1) were then digested with NotI and SalI, and the 2.6-kb fragments were ligated into pRS306 to make pLP36 and pLP37, respectively. The mek1–974 mutation was rescued onto a plasmid by gap repair (20Orr-Weaver T.L. Szostak J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The MEK1 plasmid, pB131, was cut withSacI and HpaI and transformed into themek1–974 diploid NH104 (10Hollingsworth N.M. Ponte L. Genetics. 1997; 147: 33-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pLP41, was used in sequencing reactions with primers located at staggered intervals along the MEK1 gene. To make themek1–974 integrating plasmid, pNH235, a 3.2-kbEcoRI/SalI fragment from pLP41 was ligated into the URA3 vector, pRS306, digested with EcoRI andSalI. The first step in the construction of the RED1–3HA allele was the introduction of an EcoRI site in place of theRED1 stop codon by PCR. A 1.3-kb fragment containing the 3′-half of RED1 was amplified, digested withBglII and EcoRI, and ligated intoBglII/EcoRI-digested pNH124 (10Hollingsworth N.M. Ponte L. Genetics. 1997; 147: 33-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) creating pNH208. A 3.4-kb SalI/EcoRI fragment from pNH208 carrying the entire RED1 gene with ∼1.1 kb of upstream sequences was cloned into SalI/EcoRI SK-HA3 (21Neiman A.M. Mhaiskar V. Manus V. Galibert F. Dean N. Genetics. 1997; 145: 637-645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This ligation fuses the full-length RED1 gene in-frame at the 3′-end with three copies of the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope in pNH209. The tagged allele was moved either to a high copy 2μ plasmid (pNH212) or to a URA3-integrating plasmid (pTS23) by ligating the 3.5-kb SalI/SacI fragment from pNH209 into YEp352 and pRS306, respectively. The mouse monoclonal α-HA antibody is contained in the 12CA5 ascites fluid that was purchased from Babco. Affinity-purified α-Gstp antibodies were generously provided by D. Kellogg (University of California Santa Cruz). Antibodies directed against the full-length native Hop1 protein were generated as follows. The Hop1 protein was overexpressed in vegetative yeast cells and purified to >95% homogeneity (22Kironmai K.M. Muniyappa K. Friedman D.B. Hollingsworth N.M. Byers B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1424-1435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 0.5 mg of purified Hop1 protein was injected into two rabbits followed by a boost of 0.25 mg three weeks later (performed by Babco). The resulting sera were found to cross-react with a band of ∼67 kDa, the predicted molecular mass of Hop1p, when cells carrying the galactose-inducibleGAL10p-HOP1 gene (22Kironmai K.M. Muniyappa K. Friedman D.B. Hollingsworth N.M. Byers B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1424-1435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in galactose. This band was absent when the cells were grown on glucose. The 67-kDa band was also not observed using the preimmune sera from these rabbits. Further evidence that these antibodies are specific for Hop1p is that the 67-kDa protein is only observed in sporulating cultures whenHOP1 is present. 2N. Hollingsworth, unpublished observations. 2-ml Yeast extract-peptone-dextrose cultures were inoculated with single colonies of the appropriate diploid and grown to saturation at 30 oC with aeration. Strains containing plasmids were inoculated with colonies grown on selective medium. Plasmid stability was monitored immediately prior to transfer to sporulation medium and >80% of the cells were typically found to contain plasmid. The yeast extract-peptone-dextrose cultures were diluted 1:1000–1:3000 into yeast peptone acetate medium and grown for approximately 16 h with aeration at 30 oC. When cultures reached an OD660 = 1–2, the cells were pelleted, washed with water, and resuspended in 2% potassium acetate to a final concentration of 3 × 107 cells/ml. The cells were shaken at 30 oC for 3 h and then harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 5000 rpm in a GSA rotor. Prior to centrifugation, a 1-ml aliquot was removed to the 30 oC roller, and the percent sporulation was assessed by light microscopy the following day. Sporulation typically reached levels of >90%. After 3 h in sporulation medium, 20-ml aliquots of cells were washed with water, and the cell pellets were quick frozen at −70 oC. Kinase assays were performed as described (23Neiman A.M. Herskowitz I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3398-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Sporulating cells were harvested, washed one time with water, and resuspended in 0.3 ml of lysis buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) per 20 ml of cells. To reproducibly detect Red1–3HAp, it was necessary to prepare extracts the same day as the cells were sporulated,i.e. the cells could not be frozen first. The reason for this phenomenon is not understood but is probably not because of degradation of the Red1–3HA protein. After extracts were prepared, the proteins could be frozen at −70 oC and thawed with no loss in the ability to detect Red1–3HAp by immunoblot analysis. Protease inhibitors (1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 1 mmNa3VO4) were present throughout the lysis and wash steps. One gram of glass beads was added, and the tubes were vortexed three times for 30 s with 2-min intervals on ice. The lysate was removed to a clean tube, and detergents were added to final concentrations of 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS. The lysate was rocked for 15 min at 4 oC and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was divided into two tubes to which either 1–2 μl of α-Hop1p or α-HA antibodies was added, followed by rocking for 2 h at 4 oC. To precipitate the immune complexes, 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) slurry (equilibrated 1:1 with lysis buffer) were added. The tubes were then rocked again for an additional hour at 4 oC. The Sepharose beads were washed four times with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer and resuspended in 30 μl of 2× SDS protein sample buffer. The beads were heated at 95 oC for 5 min and loaded in duplicate onto a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After fractionation, the proteins were blotted to nitrocellulose and probed for Hop1p and Red1–3HAp using α-Hop1p and α-HA antibodies, respectively. The presence of the antibodies was determined using the ECL kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The amount of Hop1p and Red1–3HAp present in the immunoprecipitates was quantitated as described in the instructions for the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A series of dilutions from the soluble extracts used in the experiment was fractionated on the same gel and probed simultaneously with the appropriate antibodies. After the ECL reaction, the films were scanned using a Bio-Rad imaging densitometer. A standard curve of protein concentration was generated for Hop1p and Red1–3HAp using the Molecular Analyst, Version 1.1 software (Bio-Rad). The amount of Hop1p and Red1–3HAp present in the immunocomplexes was then determined using the standard curves. To compare the efficiency of the co-immunoprecipitation in MEK1 and mek1Δ extracts, the following formula was used. (Co­IP proteinMEK1/IP proteinMEK1)/Equation 1 (Co­IP proteinmek1Δ/IP proteinmek1Δ) For each sample, 20 ml of sporulating YTS3/pNH212 cells were used for immunoprecipitation of Red1–3HAp. The immunoprecipitates were treated with λ protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs) as described (24Altman R. Kellogg D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Genetic interactions between MEK1,HOP1, and RED1 in the A364A strain background led to the proposal that phosphorylation of either Hop1p or Red1p by Mek1p facilitates the formation of Hop1p/Red1p hetero-oligomers, thereby ensuring the proper balance between the proteins in the assembly of axial elements during meiosis (10Hollingsworth N.M. Ponte L. Genetics. 1997; 147: 33-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test this model biochemically, it was desirable to use the SK1 strain background in which sporulation proceeds rapidly, relatively synchronously, and with high efficiency (25Padmore R. Cao L. Kleckner N.R. Cell. 1991; 66: 1239-1256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). To ensure that the genetic dosage effects of HOP1 andRED1 overexpression in the presence of the leakymek1–974 mutant occur in SK1 as well as A364A, it was necessary to repeat the dosage experiments in SK1. Themek1–974 mutation was cloned by gap repair using the diploid NH104 (10Hollingsworth N.M. Ponte L. Genetics. 1997; 147: 33-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the entire gene was sequenced. A single transition mutation of Gly to Ala at nucleotide 502 was found. This mutation creates a valine to methionine substitution at amino acid 168, which is located immediately before the GXG motif in the first conserved kinase domain (26Hunter T. Hunter T. Sefton B.M. Methods in Enzymology. 200. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1991: 3-81Google Scholar). The mek1–974 allele was introduced into the SK1 background by two-step gene replacement, thereby creating the homozygous diploid, NH211. This diploid was transformed with the same plasmids used in the previous analysis (10Hollingsworth N.M. Ponte L. Genetics. 1997; 147: 33-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the transformants were sporulated, and tetrads were dissected to assess spore viability. As in the A364A background, the mek1–974 mutant is partially functional in SK1, producing 33.2% viable spores compared with ∼1% for the deletion (Ref. 27Leem S.-H. Ogawa H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar and TableIII). The spore viability defect is complemented by MEK1 on a CEN plasmid (Table III, NH211). The presence of excess HOP1 greatly improved the mutant phenotype, resulting in 74% viable spores. In contrast, overexpression of RED1 decreased the number of viable spores from 33.2 to 16.8% (Table III, NH211). Both the HOP1suppression and the RED1 exacerbation of themek1–974 spore inviability phenotype are statistically significant by χ2 analysis (p < 0.001). The one difference observed between SK1 and A364A was the result obtained when both HOP1 and RED1 were co-overexpressed on the same plasmid. In A364A,HOP1/RED1 co-overexpression restored the spore viability observed for vector alone.

The RED1gene was fused in frame at the 3′-end to three copies of the hemagglutinin epitope. The fusion gene was then integrated atURA3 in two different isogenic SK1red1::LEU2 haploids. This insertion allele ofRED1 exhibits a null phenotype with regard to spore viability (13Hollingsworth N.M. Johnson A.D. Genetics. 1993; 133: 785-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The haploids were mated to create ared1::LEU2 diploid that is homozygous for theRED1–3HA allele (YTS3::pTS23). Alternatively, theRED1–3HA gene on a high copy number 2μ vector was transformed into YTS3 (YTS3/pNH212). After 3 h in sporulation medium, a time point when Red1–3HAp and Hop1p concentrations are maximal,3 protein extracts were made from YTS3/YEp352, YTS3::pTS23, and YTS3/pNH212. No protein of the appropriate molecular weight for Red1–3HAp was detected with the α-HA antibodies in YTS3 containing the vector alone (Fig.1 A). These cells were proceeding through meiosis, as evidenced by there being a wild-type amount of Hop1p in the YTS3/YEp352 extract (Fig. 1 B). ARED1–3HA-dependent α-HA cross-reacting band was observed in YTS3::pTS23. This protein represents Red1–3HAp as this band is absent from extracts of NH144, an isogenic diploid homozygous for the untagged RED1 gene, as well as from vegetative cultures of YTS3::pTS23.3Interestingly, in YTS3/pNH212, where the RED1–3HA allele is present in high copy number, several Red1–3HAp bands are apparent (Fig. 1 A).

In this study, we further characterize the detergent sensitivity of this association on rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 mast cells, and we compare the capacity of structural variants of FcεRI and other receptors to undergo this association. We show that this interaction is not mediated by the β subunit of the receptor or the cytoplasmic tail of the γ subunit, both of which are involved in signaling. Using chimeric receptor constructs, we found that the extracellular segment of the FcεRI α subunit was not sufficient to mediate this association, implicating FcεRI α and/or γ transmembrane segments. To determine the specificity of this interaction, we compared the association of several other receptors. Interleukin-1 type I receptors on Chinese hamster ovary cells and α4 integrins on rat basophilic leukemia cells showed little or no association with isolated membrane domains, both before and after aggregation on the cells. In contrast, interleukin-2 receptor α (Tac) on Chinese hamster ovary cells exhibited aggregation-dependent membrane domain association similar to FcεRI. These results provide insights into the structural basis and selectivity of lipid-mediated interactions between certain transmembrane receptors and detergent-resistant membranes.

Multichain immune recognition receptors present on hematopoietic cells interact with Src family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) 1The abbreviations used are: PTK, protein tyrosine kinase; ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif; RBL, rat basophilic leukemia; DRM, detergent-resistant membrane; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; IL, interleukin; TX-100, Triton X-100. 1The abbreviations used are: PTK, protein tyrosine kinase; ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif; RBL, rat basophilic leukemia; DRM, detergent-resistant membrane; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; IL, interleukin; TX-100, Triton X-100. as an early signaling step (1Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3281-3285PubMed Google Scholar). Aggregation of the high affinity receptor for IgE, FcεRI, results in phosphorylation of the β and γ2 subunits of this receptor by the Src family PTK, Lyn (2Scharenberg A.M. Lin S. Cuenod B. Yamamura H. Kinet J.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3385-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 3Zhang J. Berenstein E.H. Evans R.L. Siraganian R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Lyn phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) within FcεRI γ subunits allows the ZAP-70-related PTK, Syk, to associate with the receptor via its two Src homology 2 domains (1Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3281-3285PubMed Google Scholar, 2Scharenberg A.M. Lin S. Cuenod B. Yamamura H. Kinet J.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3385-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This recruitment and consequent activation of Syk leads to further downstream signaling, including phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase Cγ, mobilization of intracellular calcium, and activation of protein kinase C (4Beaven M.A. Baumgartner R.A Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In mast cells and basophils, which both express FcεRI, these cascades result in the exocytosis of preformed granules containing histamine and other vasoactive compounds, as well as other cellular responses. The phosphorylation of FcεRI by Lyn is a critical event in receptor activation, but the mechanism by which receptor aggregation stimulates this event is not well understood. We have proposed a novel model for this process in which specialized membrane domains enriched in Lyn mediate this phosphorylation that occurs after the aggregation-dependent association of FcεRI with these domains (5Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Razin E. Rivera J. Signal Transduction in Mast Cells and Basophils. Springer-Verlag, New York1999: 102-114Crossref Google Scholar). This model is consistent with our findings that the rapid association of FcεRI with these domains does not depend on receptor phosphorylation (6Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). It is strongly supported by preferential tyrosine phosphorylation of those receptors associated with membrane domains. Moreover, in vitro tyrosine kinase assays reproduce this activation step within these membrane domains that can be isolated because of their resistance to detergent solubilization (6Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Other models that require a direct interaction between Lyn and the β subunit of monomeric FcεRI (7Pribluda V.S. Pribluda C. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Caveolae, which are flask-shaped invaginations on the plasma membrane that contain the marker protein caveolin, can also be isolated using similar methods and appear to contain many of the same components (24Anderson R.G.W.

Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Preservation of this association after cell lysis depends on the stability of the receptor aggregate and on using a low concentration of TX-100 in the lysate (6Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 16Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). These interactions can be detected at the intact cell surface, as observed with fluorescence microscopy. For example, aggregation of FcεRI into patches causes co-redistribution of DiI-C16, a fluorescent lipid probe with saturated acyl chains, and this lipid analog has reduced lateral mobility in these patches (30Thomas J.L. Holowka D. Baird B. Webb W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Co-redistribution with aggregated FcεRI on intact cells is also observed for three other membrane components isolated with DRMs (16Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We also compared the association of wild-type and mutant FcεRI with DRMs isolated from hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell lines. Finally, we investigated the specificity of this interaction by measuring the aggregation-dependent association of other transmembrane receptors with DRMs. These results provide evidence that the structural features of FcεRI that mediate the detergent-sensitive interaction with membrane domains occur selectively but not uniquely with this receptor. RBL-2H3 cells, mouse monoclonal anti-dinitrophenyl IgE, and biotinylated 125I-IgE were previously described (6Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 16Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

P815 mouse mastocytoma cells and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with wild-type or mutant FcεRI were generously provided by Dr. H. Metzger (National Institutes of Health) and were maintained as described (32Mao S.Y. Alber G. Rivera J. Kochan J. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Prior to harvesting, cells were sensitized with biotinylated 125I-IgE for 4–24 h. All stable FcεRI transfectants expressed at least 50,000 IgE receptors per cell at the time of the experiments except the αγ2 P815 cell line, which expressed approximately 18,000 receptors per cell. CHO cells stably transfected with type I IL-1 receptors were from Dr. S. Dower (University of Sheffield, United Kingdom) and were maintained as described (33Guo C. Dower S.K. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27562-27568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The IL-2 receptor α (Tac) and Chimera-1 receptor were transiently expressed on CHO cells for 48 h prior to performing experiments. The IL-2 receptor α DNA was provided in a pCMV mammalian expression vector by Dr. B. Howard (National Institutes of Health). This plasmid was transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 1 μg of DNA per ml and 10 μl of liposomes per ml in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 5 h in the absence of serum. The Chimera-1 DNA was constructed by ligating the DNA encoding the extracellular portion of the FcεRI α subunit, the DNA encoding the transmembrane and intracellular portions of the type I IL-1 receptor, and the pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The rat FcεRIα cDNA used to make this construct was provided by Dr. H. Metzger (National Institutes of Health). The type I IL-1 receptor DNA was cloned using reverse transcription PCR from murine adult brain total RNA (provided by Dr. A. Trumpp, University of California, San Francisco). Sequencing confirmed that the junction of this chimeric receptor corresponds to base 669 of the FcεRI α sequence (GenBankTM accession number M17153) and base 1015 of the IL-1 receptor sequence (GenBankTM accession numberM20658). The Chimera-1 plasmid was transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies) at 2 μg of DNA per ml and 3 μl of liposomes per ml in Opti-MEM for 3 h. Primary and secondary antibodies used to form receptor complexes at the cell surface were as follows. For IgE, affinity-purified rabbit anti-mouse IgE (34Menon A.K. Holowka D. Baird B. J.

Immunol. 1991; 147: 109-116PubMed Google Scholar) provided by Dr. T. Issekutz (Toronto Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) and rabbit anti-mouse IgG Fc secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA); for IL-1 receptors, M5 rat monoclonal antibody (36Gallis B. Prickett K.S. Jackson J. Slack J. Schooley K. Sims J.E. Dower S.K. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 3235-3240PubMed Google Scholar), provided by Dr. S. Dower, and goat anti-rat IgG secondary antibody (Fisher); for IL-2 receptor α, 3G10 mouse monoclonal antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) and rabbit anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Cappel, West Chester, PA). All primary antibodies were iodinated with chloramine T as described previously (37Holowka D. Baird B. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3466-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). After cell harvest, the receptors were labeled with the appropriate primary antibody for at least 30 min at 20 °C, followed by two washes in buffered salt solution (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose). For α4 integrin experiments, RBL cells were presaturated with IgE, and IgE was present during TA-2 binding to prevent any interaction of FcεRI with the Fc portion of TA-2. Confluent cells were harvested using EDTA and suspended at 8 × 106/ml in buffered saline solution with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Cells labeled with the appropriate antibody were stimulated with streptavidin (Sigma) or secondary antibodies as indicated under “Results,” followed by the addition of an equal volume of ice cold 2× lysis buffer (final concentration, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 30 mm pyrophosphate, 10 mm glycerophosphate, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Calbiochem), 0.02 units/ml aprotinin, and 0.01% (w/v) NaN3) with the indicated concentration of Surfact-Amps TX-100 (Pierce). For aggregating FcεRI after cell lysis, we used rabbit anti-IgE because lysed RBL cells appear to contain sufficient free biotin to interfere with streptavidin aggregation. 3K. A. Field, D. Holowka, and B. Baird, unpublished observations. After incubation on ice for at least 10 min, the lysates were then diluted with an equal volume of 80% (w/v) sucrose in 25 mmHepes, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl. Step gradients of sucrose were formed by layering 0.25 ml of 80%, 0.5 ml of 60%, 1.5 ml of 40% (containing the cell lysate), 0.75 ml of 30%, 0.5 ml of 20%, and 0.5 ml of 10% (w/v) sucrose in Beckman Ultra-Clear centrifuge tubes (11 × 60 mm). Centrifugation and the analysis 0.2-ml aliquots of the gradients were performed as described (6Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 16Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Sucrose gradient fractions containing DRMs from either anti-IgE-stimulated or unstimulated cells lysed in 0.05% TX-100 were pooled according to the distribution of125I-IgE bound to FcεRI in a parallel stimulated sample. Subsequent steps were performed with the technical assistance of Shannon Caldwell at the Cornell Integrated Microscopy Center. Formvar carbon-coated grids (300 mesh) were suspended on the top of drops of the sucrose fractions for 30 min to allow the adherence of DRMs. The grids were then extensively washed, fixed with 1% gluteraldehyde for 3 min, washed, and stained for 30 s with 2% uranyl acetate. The negatively stained DRMs were visualized with a Philips EM-201 transmission electron microscope. We previously demonstrated that the PTK Lyn associates with DRMs isolated from RBL cells, and we found that this association is enhanced upon FcεRI stimulation (16Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Under these standard cell lysis conditions with high concentrations of TX-100, FcεRI did not co-isolate with DRMs. However, with lower detergent lysis conditions, similar to those identified by Pribluda et al. (7Pribluda V.S. Pribluda C. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11246-11250Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) for enhancing the association of kinase activity with immunoprecipitated FcεRI, we found that substantial amounts of the aggregated receptor co-purified with the low density DRMs following sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation (6Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). As part of our investigation of the structural basis for this receptor association with DRMs, we examined the detergent sensitivity. For low detergent conditions, we use 0.05% TX-100 to lyse RBL cells at 4 × 106/ml and then dilute this lysate 1:1 with 80% sucrose prior to sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Under these conditions, the micellar detergent to cell lipid ratio during the ultracentrifugation is approximately 3 (38Kinet J.P. Alcaraz G. Leonard A. Wank S. Metzger H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4117-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To exclude some artifactual possibilities, we added 0.025% TX-100 to all of the sucrose gradient steps, as shown in Fig.1 (○ and •). Under these conditions, as when no TX-100 is added to the gradient (6Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), less than 5% of the unaggregated FcεRI associates with the DRM fractions (○, fractions 3–7) and greater than 50% of streptavidin-aggregated biotin-IgE-FcεRI complexes associate with these (•). From this result, it appears unlikely that the plasma membrane is incompletely solubilized or that association of aggregated receptors with DRMs depends on the separation of DRM components from TX-100 during the ultracentrifugation process. To investigate the requirements for DRM association of aggregated FcεRI, we lysed cells with 0.05% TX-100 prior to adding anti-IgE to form FcεRI aggregates. When this lysate was fractionated (Fig. 1, ■), these aggregates migrated at a higher density in the sucrose gradient, similar to aggregates formed on cells that are subsequently lysed in 0.2% or higher TX-100 (16Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In contrast, addition of anti-IgEprior to cell lysis with 0.05% TX-100 causes greater than 50% of FcεRI to associate with low density membranes (e.g. see Fig. 6 A), similar to results using streptavidin cross-linking (Fig. 1 (•) and Ref. 6Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the interactions between DRM components and aggregated FcεRI that occur on intact cells must be preserved during cell lysis and sucrose gradient fractionation, as they cannot be caused by receptor aggregation subsequent to cell lysis. The association of FcεRI with DRMs could be mediated by protein-protein, protein-lipid, or some combination of these interactions. By varying the amount of TX-100 used to lyse RBL cells, we further investigated the detergent sensitivity of this interaction. Unaggregated FcεRI was recovered in the low density gradient fractions when insufficient TX-100 (<0.03%) was used for cell lysis (Fig. 2, ○). Under these conditions, it is possible that plasma membranes are not solubilized completely and therefore migrate at this low density because of their lipid content. With greater than 0.03% TX-100 for cell lysis, the membranes appeared effectively solubilized, and monomeric FcεRIs were found almost entirely in the 40% sucrose fraction. In addition, other membrane-bound proteins that do not associate with DRMs, including α4 integrins (e.g. see Fig. 6 B) and Src,3 were found in the 40% sucrose fractions at 0.05% TX-100. Under these same conditions, greater than 50% of streptavidin-aggregated biotin-IgE bound to FcεRI remained associated with DRMs in the sucrose gradient (Fig. 2, •). When concentrations of TX-100 used during cell lysis were greater than 0.05%, aggregated FcεRIs were not retained with DRMs, and complete disruption of this association occurred as low as 0.08% TX-100 (Fig. 2). As shown previously, lipid-anchored markers of these DRMs (i.e.Thy-1, GD1b gangliosides, and Lyn) remain associated even at 0.5% TX-100 (16Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This marked sensitivity for FcεRI/DRM association is consistent with a lipid-mediated interaction (see under “Discussion”). Electron microscopy of isolated, negatively stained DRMs from RBL cells lysed at 0.05% TX-100 reveals them to be vesicular structures (Fig.3). The majority range from 50 to 200 nm in diameter; larger vesicles with diameters up to 1.4 μm were less frequently observed.3 These vesicles are qualitatively similar in appearance and size to DRM preparations from MDCK cells (25Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z. Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Tu Y.H. Cook R.F. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), T- and B-cell lines (28Parolini I. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. Peschle C. Blood. 1996; 87: 3783-3794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), neuroblastoma cells (26Gorodinsky A. Harris D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and RBL cells, more typically lysed in 1% TX-100. 4D. Reczeck and K. Field, unpublished observations. Thus, DRMs isolated with lower TX-100 to cell lipid ratios are not ultrastructurally different from other DRMs that have been prepared with higher TX-100, and these preparations are not significantly contaminated with unsolubilized membrane sheets or organelles. To investigate further the structural basis of the FcεRI/DRM interaction, we used P815 mast cells and CHO cells that were stably transfected with various FcεRI constructs. As shown in Fig.4, P815 cells stably expressing wild-type αβγ2 FcεRI subunits (wt) show aggregation-dependent receptor association with low density DRMs that is similar to native FcεRI on RBL cells at 0.05% TX-100 (Fig. 2 and Ref. 6Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cells expressing mutated versions of the receptor lacking either the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the β subunit or the cytoplasmic tail of the γ subunit show similar aggregation-dependent association (Fig. 4). Interestingly, IgE receptors entirely lacking the β subunit (FcεRI αγ2) also show aggregation-dependent DRM interactions. Some differences in the magnitude of association were observed, but the ratio of aggregated to monomeric receptors associated with the DRMs remained fairly constant. These differences could represent small contributions to the DRM association from the deleted protein segments. Alternatively, this variability could be due to differences between the transfected cell lines themselves that have been separately subcloned. Significantly, FcεRI in the β and γ subunit cytoplasmic tail mutant cells do not activate tyrosine kinases or other downstream signals (9Alber G. Miller L. Jelsema C.L. Varin-Blank N. Metzger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22613-22620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although they do become insoluble in high concentrations of TX-100 after extensive aggregation (32Mao S.Y. Alber G. Rivera J. Kochan J. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Nonhematopoietic CHO cells expressing wild-type FcεRI showed qualitatively similar association of this receptor with DRMs that depends on aggregation (Fig. 5,wild-type). However, a chimeric receptor containing the extracellular segment of the FcεRI α subunit and the transmembrane and intracellular segments of the type-1 IL-1 receptor (Fig. 5,Chimera-1) did not show significant DRM association in the presence or absence of receptor aggregation. This chimeric receptor demonstrates that the extracellular segment of FcεRI α is not sufficient to mediate this interaction. In contrast, a similar chimeric receptor that contains the extracellular segment of the FcεRI α subunit and the transmembrane and intracellular segments of IL-2 receptor α (p55, Tac; 39) (Fig. 5, Chimera-2) did show aggregation-dependent association with the DRMs. The results in Figs. 4 and 5 are consistent with the transmembrane segments of these receptors being most important for determining DRM association. We also examined the association of FcεRI α subunits linked to the plasma membrane by a GPI anchor. These receptors, which lack a transmembrane segment, associated with the DRMs even in the absence of aggregation (Fig. 5, GPI) and also remained associated to a similar extent in 0.2% TX-100,3 conditions that would extract aggregated, wild-type FcεRI (Fig. 2). This is consistent with previous studies from our laboratory (16Field K.A. Holowka D. B"

In this study the relationship between nitric oxide and PG synthesis was investigated after cytokine stimulation of cultured rat osteoblasts. IL-1, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and exogenous sodium nitroprusside, a nitric oxide donor, all stimulated PGE2 production in a dose-dependent manner. PGE2 production was blocked byl-nitro-arginine methyl ester, an inhibitor of nitric oxide production, after IFN-γ stimulation and was partially blocked after TNF-α stimulation. However, IL-1-induced PGE2 was unaffected. Similarly, expression of the cyclooxygenase-2 protein was stimulated by cytokines, and IFN-γ-induced expression was again blocked by l-nitro-arginine methyl ester. In contrast, all cytokines induced the cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA expression independently of nitric oxide production, although exogenous sodium nitroprusside was able to induce the cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA in the absence of cytokines. The results show that nitric oxide can induce PG synthesis and cyclooxygenase-2 expression and may regulate cyclooxygenase-2 expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In addition, the data show the existence of both nitric oxide-dependent and -independent pathways of PG synthesis after cytokine stimulation of osteoblasts. The results suggest that nitric oxide may be an important mediator of PG production in inflammatory bone diseases.

The factors that may regulate bone metabolism during inflammation are of considerable importance in understanding the pathogenesis of a number of common inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis and the periodontal diseases, and may suggest novel therapeutic approaches to control of bone destruction seen in these conditions. The effects of cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2; NO, nitric oxide; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; l-NAME, l-nitro arginine methyl ester; SNP, sodium nitroprusside; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PG, prostaglandin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2; NO, nitric oxide; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; l-NAME, l-nitro arginine methyl ester; SNP, sodium nitroprusside; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PG, prostaglandin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) on bone cells have been studied extensively in the past and have complex effects on bone metabolism (for review, see Ref. 1Yoneda T. Noda M. Cellular and Molecular Biology of Bone. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 376-412Google Scholar). These cytokines may act directly on osteoblasts to regulate their activity and also regulate osteoclastic bone resorption indirectly via their interaction with osteoblasts. IL-1 is a potent inducer of bone resorption (2Gowen M. Wood D.D. Ihrie E.J. McGuire M.K. Russell R.G. Nature. 1983; 306: 378-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 3Thomson B.M. Saklatvala J. Chambers T.J. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and has a number of different effects on osteoblast metabolism in vitro, including inhibition of bone formation and stimulation or inhibition of proliferation, alkaline phosphatase activity, and collagen synthesis depending on the cell type and the culture conditions used (4Hanazawa S.

TNF-α also stimulates bone resorption and can inhibit markers of osteoblast activity such as alkaline phosphatase and collagen synthesis (10Taichman R.S. Hauschka P.V. Inflammation. 1992; 16: 587-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11Bertolini D.R. Nedwin G.E. Bringman T.S. Smith D.D. Mundy G.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 516-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). In contrast, IFN-γ specifically inhibits IL-1-induced bone resorption and can directly inhibit cell proliferation and alkaline phosphatase activity in osteoblast cultures (12Gowen M. Nedwin G.E. Mundy G.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1986; 1: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 13Smith D.D. Gowen M. Mundy G.R. Endocrinology. 1987; 120: 2494-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). There is strong evidence that some of the effects of these cytokines on bone cells may be mediated by the induction of prostaglandin synthesis. In particular, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis can partially reverse the effects of IL-1 on both osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity (4Hanazawa S. Ohmori Y. Amano S. Hirose K. Miyoshi T.

Res. 1991; 70: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Prostaglandins are potent stimulators of osteoclastic bone resorption and have wide-ranging effects on osteoblast metabolism directly by their interaction with cell surface receptors on the osteoblasts (17Raisz L.G. Martin T.J. Peck W.A. Bone and Mineral Research. 2. Exerpta Medica, Amsterdam1984: 286-310Google Scholar). Prostaglandins are produced by the action of cyclooxygenase enzymes on arachidonic acid after its release by the enzyme phospholipase A2. Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase have been described, namely cyclooxygenase-1 (prostaglandin H synthase-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2, prostaglandin H synthase-2). COX-1 is constitutively expressed by many cells, whereas COX-2 expression may be induced by a range of stimuli. For example, IL-1 is a potent inducer of COX-2 expression in a number of cell types, including osteoblasts (18Kawaguchi H. Yavari R. Stover M.L. Rowe D.W. Raisz L.G. Pilbeam C.C. Endocr.

Recent studies have demonstrated the production of nitric oxide (NO) by osteoblasts after stimulation with IL-1, TNF-α, and IFN-γ by the induction of expression of the inducible NO synthase enzyme (iNOS) (20Damoulis P.D.

Furthermore, these studies have suggested that the production of NO may also mediate some of the effects of these cytokines on bone metabolism. The evidence suggests that NO may both stimulate and inhibit bone resorption in a biphasic manner and inhibit osteoblastic activity (21Hukkanen M. Hughes F. Buttery L. Gross S. Evans T. Seddon S.

A. 1991; 88: 2936-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In addition, osteoblastic cells may also produce NO and prostaglandin (PG) after mechanical deformation (28Pitsillides A.A. Rawlinson S.C. Suswillo R.F. Bourrin S. Zaman G. Lanyon L.E. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1614-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). During acute and chronic inflammatory processes in vivo, both iNOS and COX-2 may be co-expressed in an apparently co-ordinated way (29Vane J.R. Mitchell J.A. Appleton I. Tomlinson A. Bishop-Bailey D. Croxtall J. Willoughby D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2046-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). Taken together these findings raise the question of the possible relationship between NO and prostaglandin synthesis in the regulation of bone metabolism. In the present study we have investigated the relationship between NO and PG synthesis in osteoblasts after cytokine stimulation. Specifically, the aim of the study was to investigate the hypothesis that NO mediates prostaglandin synthesis and induction of COX-2 expression in osteoblast cultures isolated from fetal rat calvariae after stimulation with the cytokines IL-1, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. Primary osteoblast-enriched cultures were isolated by sequential enzymatic digestion of neonatal rat calvariae as described previously (30Wong G.L. Cohn D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3167-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 31Bellows C.G. Aubin J.E. Heersche J.N.M. Antosz M.E. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1986; 38: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Briefly, the calvariae were dissected from neonatal Wistar rats and digested with collagenase for periods of 10, 10, 20, 20, and 20 min sequentially. The cells isolated from the final three digests were plated into 75-cm2 flasks for 24 h, released by trypsin treatment and pooled, replated at a cell density of 6 × 103 cells/cm2, and cultured until confluent for experiments. Cells were cultured in modified Eagle's medium α (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and fungizone (Life Technologies). For experiments cells were stimulated with recombinant human IL-1β (specific activity, 2.8 × 108 units/mg), recombinant murine IFN-γ (specific activity, 1 × 107 units/mg), and recombinant human TNF-α (specific activity, 1 × 107 units/mg; all obtained from Genzyme Ltd., West Malling, Kent, UK). To block NO production, cultures were treated with the arginine analoguel-nitro arginine methyl ester (l-NAME, 1 mm) or in some experiments with N -nitro-l-arginine 1 mm). In some experiments cultures were treated with the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP), with exogenous PGE2, or with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (all obtained from Sigma). Confluent cultures in 96-well plates were treated for 24 h with cytokines in the presence or absence of the inhibitor of NO productionl-NAME at 1 mm concentration. In some experiments cells were stimulated with exogenous PGE2(Sigma) or the NO donor SNP. Culture medium was then collected and either used immediately or stored for periods of up to 1 week at −20 °C for assay of production of PGE2 by enzyme immunoassay using a commercially available assay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). NO production was assayed by measurement of nitrite present in the culture medium using the Griess reaction consisting of 0.2% sulfanilamide and 2% N -(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine in 1% H2PO4 (32Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10794) Google Scholar). Nitrite measurement was determined by reading absorbance at 590 nm using a 96-well plate reader. All experiments were carried out in triplicate in a minimum of two independent experiments. Confluent cultures grown in 75-cm2 flasks were stimulated for 24 h with cytokines either singly or in combination and in the presence or absence of l-NAME (1 mm). Culture media were then decanted, and the cells were immediately fixed with a 1% solution of paraformadehyde in PBS for 20 min. After several washes in PBS, cell cultures were immunostained by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by immersing slides in 0.03% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 min, followed by washing in PBS (three washes, 10 min each). After blocking nonspecific binding by incubating in 3% normal goat serum for 20 min, sections were blotted and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit antibodies to murine macrophage iNOS (21Hukkanen M. Hughes F. Buttery L. Gross S. Evans T. Seddon S. Riveros-Moreno V. MacIntyre I. Polak J. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5445-5453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and COX-2 (33Habib A. Creminon C. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Pradelles P. Maclouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23448-23454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), both diluted 1:1000 in PBS containing 0.05% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% sodium azide. Sections were washed in PBS and then successively incubated with biotinylated goat antiserum to rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) diluted 1:100 in PBS/bovine serum albumin and freshly prepared avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vectastain, Vector Laboratories), for 30 and 60 min, respectively. Peroxidase activity was revealed using the diaminobenzidine-hydrogen peroxide method. Osteoblast total RNA was isolated by the Ultraspec (Biotecx Laboratories) isolation method. Total RNA (20 μg) was separated on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and immobilized by baking at 80 °C for 4 h. Membranes were prehybridized in ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH) for 30 min. The membranes were then hybridized for 1 h at 37 °C with continuous shaking with 50 ng/ml 32P-labeled (T4 polynucleotide kinase labeling kit, Promega) murine COX-2 oligonuclotide probe (R & D systems) in fresh ExpressHyb solution. After stringency washes in 3 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and 0.1% SSC, 0.1% SDS, the membranes were exposed to autoradiographic film (Reflection NEF-485, DuPont NEN) for 48 h at −70 °C. Loading of RNA was normalized between lanes by subsequent probing of blots with β-actin. To determine whether NO affected RNA stability, cultures were treated with actinomycin-D to block new RNA synthesis, and RNA was quantified by Northern analysis after 0, 1.5, and 3 h. Blots were quantified (Scion Image, Scion Corp.) to determine mean absorbancies of mRNA bands (corrected for background). Cells were grown to confluence in 75-cm2 flasks and stimulated for 24 h with cytokines either alone or in combination and in the presence or absence ofl-NAME (1 mm). Cells were also incubated with SNP (1 mm). Total cellular proteins were extracted by freeze-thawing the cells in 0.05 m Tris buffer, pH 7.2, containing 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 40 μg/ml bestatin, and 50 μg/ml N -α- p -tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (all purchased from Sigma). After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was collected and stored at −80 °C. After separation of the homogenates (20 μg of total protein) by electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, proteins were electroblotted on to nitrocellulose membranes. Specific proteins were detected using polyclonal rabbit antibodies to iNOS and COX-2, followed by anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein bands were revealed by enhanced chemiluminesence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and autoradiography. Blots were quantified (Scion Image) to determine mean absorbancies of protein bands (corrected for background). Data from assays were used to calculate mean ± S.D. and tested for significant differences by one-way analysis of variance and Tukey's multiple comparisons test. To investigate whether NO is involved in cytokine-stimulated PGE2 production, cells were stimulated with cytokines in the presence or absence of the inhibitor of NO productionl-NAME, and PGE2 was determined by enzyme immunoassay. 24-h stimulation of cells with IL-1β, TNF-α, or IFN-γ resulted in a marked, dose-dependent induction of PGE2 release into the culture medium. When normalized for equimolar concentrations of cytokines, IL-1β showed the greatest and IFN-γ the least activity. The addition of l-NAME had no significant effect on IL-1-induced PGE2 production. However, l-NAME consistently blocked IFN-γ-induced PGE2 production. The stimulatory effect of TNF-α on PGE2 production was partially blocked byl-NAME, although overall these data were not statistically significant (Fig. 1). Combinations of cytokines were also tested in further experiments (Fig.2). Addition of IFN-γ to both TNF-α and to low (10 units/ml) concentrations of IL-1 showed synergistic increases in PGE2 activity, which were largely blocked byl-NAME. However, there was no evidence of additional effects of either TNF-α or IFN-γ when added to higher concentrations of IL-1β (≥100 units/ml), and l-NAME alone did not affect PGE2 production. When the NO donor SNP was added to the cultures, again PGE2 production was induced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3).Figure 3Effects of SNP on PGE2production.

TNF-α and IFN-γ produced small but significant increases in nitrite production, and combinations of all cytokines showed strong synergistic increases in nitrite production, which were inhibited by addition ofl-NAME (Fig. 4). Addition of indomethacin did not inhibit cytokine-induced nitrite, and addition of exogenous PGE2 did not affect nitrite production (Fig.5).Figure 5Effects of PGE2 and cytokines with or without indomethacin (Indo) on nitrite accumulation.

Cells stimulated with IL-1, TNF-α, or IFN-γ showed strong immunoreactivity for both iNOS and COX-2 in ∼10% of all cells. A combination of all three cytokines together increased the number of cells stained to ∼60%. Staining for iNOS was not affected if the cytokine-stimulated cells were additionally incubated with l-NAME. Immunoreactivity for COX-2, however, was inhibited by the presence of l-NAME, such that staining seen in cells incubated with IFN-γ andl-NAME was comparatively much weaker than that seen with the cytokine alone. l-NAME had no effect on the immunoreactivity of cells stimulated with IL-1 (Fig.6). Total COX-2 and iNOS enzyme expression was quantified by Western blots. The rabbit antibodies to iNOS and COX-2 reacted with protein bands corresponding to ∼130 and 70 kDa, respectively, in homogenates of osteoblasts stimulated with IL-1β, TNF-α, or IFN-γ, either alone or in combination (Fig.7). These bands correspond to the known molecular masses of rodent iNOS and COX-2. The antibodies did not recognize any protein bands in control, unstimulated cells. The presence of l-NAME had no effect on cytokine-stimulated expression of iNOS, nor did it affect IL-1β-stimulated expression of COX-2. However, the signal produced for COX-2 protein in cells stimulated with IFN-γ in the presence of l-NAME was consistently much weaker than that seen with the cytokine alone. The expression of COX-2 by osteoblasts was also stimulated in a dose-dependent manner by the NO donor SNP. The reduced expression of COX-2 seen in cells stimulated by IFN-γ in the presence of l-NAME was partially abolished if the cells were additionally incubated with SNP for the last 12 h of incubation. Analysis of the absorbancies of the COX-2 protein bands revealed a 2–3-fold reduction in the amount of protein expressed by cells stimulated by IFN-γ in presence of l-NAME compared with the cytokine alone. Furthermore, densitometric analysis of COX-2 protein in cells stimulated with IFN-γ in the presence ofl-NAME and increasing concentrations of SNP revealed a gradual recovery of COX-2 protein expression (Fig. 7). The effects of NO on expression of COX-2 mRNA were determined by Northern blots. Osteoblast cultures exposed to IL-1β, TNF-α, or IFN-γ for 0, 6, and 15 h showed induction of a single band of ∼4.4 kb corresponding to the expected size of COX-2 mRNA (Fig. 8). The cytokine-stimulated induction of COX-2 mRNA was unaffected by the presence of l-NAME for all cytokines tested. However, exogenous SNP stimulated the expression of COX-2 in a concentration-dependent manner. In cultures treated with actinomycin D there was a small decline in RNA levels by 3 h after both IL-1 and IFN-γ treatment. However, addition of l-NNA did not affect the decline in RNA levels (Fig.9).Figure 9Northern blots for COX-2 after treatment with actinomycin D subsequent to IFN (a) or IL-1 (b) with or without N-nitro-l-arginine stimulation.c, quantification of COX-2 and β-actin mRNA (ratio).Solid bar, 0 h; striped bar, 1.5 h; gray bar, 3 h after additional actinomycin D.

Cytokines such as IL-1, TNF-α, and IFN-γ stimulate both PG and NO synthesis in osteoblasts by regulation of the inducible isoforms of the cyclooxygenase (COX-2) and nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) enzymes, respectively. Inhibition of PG synthesis by indomethacin may abrogate the effects of, for example, IL-1 in regulating osteoblast metabolism and osteoclastic bone resorption (8Ellies L.G. Aubin J.E.

These data suggest the importance of both PG and NO production as mediators of the actions of these cytokines in regulating bone metabolism during inflammatory disease processes. Previous studies have shown that NO may increase PG synthesis by activation of the COX-2 protein (34Franchi A.M. Chaud M. Rettori V. Suburo A. McCann S.M. Gimeno M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

NO is known to react with iron-containing enzymes, resulting in their activation, and in this respect the heme-containing COX-2 enzyme is a potential target for the direct action of NO. Conversely, production of PG has been reported to increase or decrease NO production in a biphasic manner in murine macrophages and mesangial cells (39Milano S. Arcoleo F. Dieli M.D. Agostino R.D. Agostino P. De Nucci G. Cillari E. Prostaglandins. 1995; 49: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 40Tetsuka T. Daphna-Iken D. Srivastava S.K. Baier L.D. DuMaine J. Morrison A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12168-12172Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The data from the present study suggest that NO may regulate PG synthesis at a number of different levels of control and furthermore suggest the existence of both NO-dependent and -independent pathways of PG synthesis in osteoblasts after cytokine stimulation. This conclusion is reached by the finding that 24-h stimulation of cells with IL-1β, TNF-α, or IFN-γ resulted in a dose-dependent increase in PGE2 production, the major PG type synthesized by osteoblasts. The suggestion of the existence of both NO-dependent and -independent pathways is supported by our findings that IL-1β-induced PGE2 synthesis was independent of NO synthesis, as judged by the lack of effect of addedl-NAME, whereas l-NAME almost totally inhibited IFN-γ-stimulated PGE2 synthesis. The effects ofl-NAME on TNF-α-stimulated PGE2 synthesis were less conclusive, consistently producing a partial inhibitory effect, but overall this was found not to be statistically significant. Combinations of TNF-α and IFN-γ showed a synergistic effect on PGE2 production, which was largely reversed byl-NAME. In addition, exogenous NO provided by treatment with the NO donor SNP also stimulated PGE2 production. IL-1β was the most potent inducer of PGE2 production of the cytokines tested. In support of its important role in stimulating PGE2 synthesis, l-NAME did not inhibit synthesis of PG in combinations of cytokines that included IL-1β, and in these experiments addition of both TNF-α and IFN-γ did not significantly increase PG production over IL-1β stimulation alone. Investigation of COX-2 protein expression by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis gave results consistent with the data for PGE2 production. First, all cytokines and exogenous SNP induced COX-2 protein expression after 24-h stimulation. Addition of l-NAME did not affect IL-1β-induced COX-2 expression but markedly inhibited IFN-γ-induced protein expression, and the effect of l-NAME was reversible by addition of SNP for the final 12 h of stimulation. In other experiments we found that COX-1 expression was not regulated by cytokines or NO donors (data not shown). In contrast to the findings of both PGE2and COX-2 protein expression, the data suggest that NO was not required for cytokine-induced COX-2 mRNA expression. Measurement of steady state levels of mRNA for COX-2 by Northern blot demonstrated the induction of COX-2 mRNA by each of the cytokines tested, but this was not affected by addition of l-NAME. Despite this, NO was also able to induce COX-2 mRNA expression, as shown by the observation that exogenous SNP also induced COX-2 mRNA. Taken together these data suggest that although NO can induce COX-2 expression, cytokine-induced COX-2 mRNA was independent of NO production. Although the effects of NO on the activation of COX-2 enzyme were not directly examined in these studies, it is possible that at least part of the effect of NO on PGE2 production by IFN-γ (and TNF-α) could be attributable to enzyme activation. However, COX-2 activity was not further activated by NO in osteoblast cultures already exposed to IL-1β. In addition to effects of NO on COX-2 enzyme activation, which have been previously described (35Salvemini D. Misko T.P. Masferrer J.L. Seibert K. Currie M.G. Needleman P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7240-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar, 36Salvemini D. Seibert K. Masferrer J.L. Misko T.P. Currie M.G. Needleman P. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1940-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), the present data demonstrate the regulation of PG synthesis by NO at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. First, exogenous SNP increased COX-2 mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. Second, although NO was not required for cytokine-induced COX-2 mRNA expression, l-NAME inhibited IFN-γ-induced COX-2 protein expression. These data suggest that NO acts at a post-transcriptional or translational level to increase COX-2 protein expression and PG synthesis in addition to any effects it may have on COX-2 enzyme activity. However, there was no evidence that NO was acting by altering RNA stability. In contrast to the data presented here, an earlier study did not detect any effects of the NO donorS-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine on PGE2 production by mouse calvaria organ cultures (41Ralston R.H. Grabowski P.S. Bone. 1996; 19: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This variation from our results is not clear but might reflect the different culture systems and conditions used for stimulation in the two studies. However, recent reports have suggested that PGE2 production by osteoblastic cells after mechanical deformation may be NO-dependent and mediated by production of low levels of NO by activation of the constitutively expressed endothelial NOS isoenzyme (28Pitsillides A.A. Rawlinson S.C. Suswillo R.F. Bourrin S. Zaman G. Lanyon L.E. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1614-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 42Klein-Nulend J. Semeins C.M. Ajubi N.E. Nijweide P.J. Burger E.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 640-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with the data here, first in showing PGE2 production by NO, and second, more specifically, by suggesting that relatively low levels of NO are able to regulate PG synthesis, as seen in the current studies with the use of combinations of single cytokines, particularly IFN-γ. In summary, the results of the study presented here demonstrate that NO can induce PG synthesis and can regulate COX-2 expression both at the levels of gene transcription and by post-transcriptional mechanisms in cultured osteoblastic cells. The data further demonstrate that although IL-1β-induced PGE2 production was independent of NO production, IFN-γ induced COX-2 protein expression, and PGE2 production was dependent on its ability to induce NO production. Although IL-1 shows a greater potency in inducing PGE2 production when compared with IFN-γ, these results suggest that NO may play a significant role in PG-mediated bone resorption in inflammatory bone disease processes. In addition, the ability of NO to produce PGE2 may be an important mechanism in regulating bone metabolism in other circumstances, such as in mediating responses to mechanical loading of bone.

https://openalex.org/W2013252377,"Chromosomal translocations t(4;11) are regularly associated with a specific type of acute leukemias and probably initiate the development of this disease. It has been proposed by others, that these translocations are mediated by recombinases of the immune system. The breakpoints on both derivative chromosomes for three t(4;11) leukemia-derived cell lines and primary blasts from two patients have been analysed here in detail. The results revealed that: (a) multiple double- or single-stranded DNA breaks must have occured near the translocation breakpoints on both participating chromosomes; and (b) DNA fragments flanked by these breaks must have either been deleted, inverted or duplicated during the translocation process. We found no evidence for the involvement of specific target sequences and recombinases of the immune system. Similar characteristic features were observed by re-interpretation of published t(6;11) and t(9;22) translocation data. Therefore we present a new model for the generation of these translocations which poses, that these translocations are reciprocal but not balanced at the fine structure level and that the DNA damage-repair machinery is likely involved in producing the final structure of the translocation breakpoint."
https://openalex.org/W2115700155,"Sequence-dependent formation and lack of repair of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-induced DNA adducts correlates well with the positions of p53 mutational hotspots in smoking-related lung cancers (Denissenko et al, 1996, 1998). The mycotoxin aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is considered to be a major causative agent in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in regions with presumed high food contamination by AFB1. A unique mutational hotspot, a G to T transversion at the third base of codon 249 of the p53 gene is observed in these tumors. To test whether a selectivity of AFB1 adduct formation is related to this peculiar mutational spectrum, we have mapped AFB1-DNA adducts at nucleotide resolution using ligation-mediated PCR and terminal transferase-dependent PCR. Human HepG2 cells were exposed to AFB1 metabolically activated in the presence of rat liver microsomes. Significant adduct formation was seen at the third base of codon 249. However, this was not the major site of AFB1 adducts and strong adduction was also observed at codons 226, 243, 244, 245 and 248 in exon 7 of the p53 gene and at several codons in exon 8. The damage at codon 249 does not consist of a unique abasic site or ring-opened aflatoxin B1 adduct but rather is consistent with the principal N7-guanine adduct of AFB1. Time course experiments indicate that, under the conditions used, AFB1 adducts are not removed in a strand-selective manner and adduct removal from the third base of codon 249 proceeds at a relatively fast rate (50% in 7 h). The incomplete correspondence between sites of persistent AFB1 damage and the specific codon 249 mutation suggests that AFB1 may not be involved in mutation of this site or that additional mechanisms such as parallel infection with hepatitis B virus may be required for selection of codon 249 mutants in HCC."

PG represents approximately 1% of total lipid phosphorous in mammalian tissues except for lung and is found in many intracellular locations, such as mitochondrial, nuclear, and microsomal membranes. In lung, PG represents approximately 5% of total phospholipid; it is found there predominantly in lamella body membranes (reviewed in Ref. 1Hostetler K.Y. Hawthorne J.N. Ansell G.B. Phospholipids.

Recent biochemical analysis suggests that PG is a potential activator of the protein kinase C family, including protein kinase C-θ (3Pietromonaco S.F. Simons P.C. Altman A. Elias L. J. Biol.

In yeast cells, most of the requirement for CL for mitochondrial functions appears to be substituted by an increase in PG content (12Chang S.-C. Heacock P.N. Mileykovskaya E. Voelker D.R. Dowhan W.

On the other hand, disruption of the yeast PGS1 gene (also known as PEL1), which encodes phosphatidylglycerophosphate (PGP) synthase resulted in no detectable CL or PG (15Chang S.-C. Heacock P.N.

Early enzymological studies revealed the biosynthetic pathway for PG and CL in animal cells as shown in Fig.1. PGP synthase catalyzes the committed step in CL biosynthesis with the displacement of the CMP moiety of CDP-diacylglycerol by sn-glycerol 3-phosphate to produce PGP (18Kiyasu J.Y. Pieringer R.A. Paulus H. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2293-2298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PGP is rapidly dephosphorlylated to generate PG that is utilized as a substrate along with CDP-diacylglycerol for CL synthesis. PGP synthase activity is predominantly localized in mitochondria, but measurable activity is also detected in endoplasmic reticulum (19Jelsema C.L. Morré D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7960-7971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Solubilization and partial purification of PGP synthase from pig liver mitochondria was reported (20Nicholson D.W.

Biochem. 1978; 56: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), but neither complete purification nor isolation of cDNA for PGP synthase from somatic cells has been reported. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutants are a good model for studying mammalian phospholipid biosynthesis and functions (22Nishijima M. Kuge O. Hanada K. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 324-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Previously, we isolated a temperature-sensitive CHO mutant (PGS-S) that is defective in PGP synthase activity. The PGP synthase activity in the mutant was 1% of that in wild type CHO-K1 cells, and biosynthetic rate and cellular content of PG and CL were also markedly reduced in the mutant (23Ohtsuka T. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22908-22913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, this mutant displays mitochondrial morphological and functional abnormality (24Ohtsuka T. Nishijima M. Suzuki K. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol.

In this study, we report the first isolation of a somatic cell cDNA from CHO cells that encodes a PGP synthase (cPGS1). Using this cDNA, we also demonstrate that the mitochondrial morphological defects and inability to carry out oxidative phosphorylation to support growth on glucose-depleted medium displayed by mutant PGS-S are directly due to the reduced ability to make normal levels of the anionic phospholipids PG and/or CL.

Oligonucleotides corresponding to parts of human expressed sequence tags (ESTs) (The Institute for Genome Research, gene identification numbers THC122139 and T12593) were used to amplify a CHO PGS1 cDNA fragment from a CHO cDNA library (25Kuge O. Saito K. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19133-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) by means of a two-stage polymerase chain reaction. The primers used for the first round of amplification were 5′-ATGGCATCCCTTTACCTGGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACGTAGCGGATCTGTCGGTT-3′ (antisense). Primers, 5′-TCTGAATTCGAGCAGGAACTGGTGGATTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCTCTCGAGATCTGTCGGTTGGTGAAGTA-3′ (antisense) containing anEcoRI site and XhoI site, respectively, were used for the second round of amplification. The amplification reactions were performed for 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 50 °C for 2 min, and elongation at 72 °C for 2 min, with Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) according to the manufacturer's instruction. For the second round of amplification, the first round reaction mixture was diluted 20-fold and used as template. The 0.35-kb product of the second round reaction was subcloned into theEcoRI/XhoI sites of pBluescriptII SK+(Stratagene) and sequenced. Based on the sequence of the cloned 0.35-kb DNA, an oligonucleotide (5′-CTCTGGAGAAGTCACTACAGTCG-3′ (sense)) was synthesized, biotinylated, and used for the enrichment of corresponding cDNA clones from a CHO cDNA library (25Kuge O. Saito K. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19133-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) by employing the GeneTrapperTM cDNA positive selection system (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The single stranded cDNA clones captured with the biotinylated oligonucleotide were electroporated into ElectroMAX DH10B (Life Technologies, Inc.), and ampicillin-resistant transformants were selected. Colonies of the resultant transformant were subjected to a polymerase chain reaction screening for colonies containing CHOPGS1 cDNA using the same unbiotinylated sense oligonucleotide and 5′-AGTCACTCAGGTTTGCACC-3′ (antisense, which corresponds to the sequence of human EST cDNA, The Institute for Genome Research number THC122139) as polymerase chain reaction primers. Methods for plasmid preparation, restriction enzyme digestion, DNA ligation, andEscherichia coli transformation were preformed as described previously (26Sambrook J. Fritsh E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA to be sequenced and to be transfected into CHO cells was prepared with Wizard DNA purification kits (Promega Corp.). DNA sequencing reactions were performed by the TaqDye-deoxy Terminator (Applied Biosystems) method with walking primers, and the reaction products were run on an Applied Biosystems sequencer. Both strands of two CHO PGS1 cDNA clones carrying a putative full-length open reading frame (ORF) were determined. Strain CHO-K1 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Mutant PGS-P (parent strain CHO-K1) and mutant PGS-S (parent strain PGS-P) were previously described (23Ohtsuka T. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22908-22913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated all strains were grown in Ham's F-12 medium (27Ham R.G. Prod. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 53: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% (v/v) newborn calf serum, penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml), under 5% CO2 atmosphere at 100% humidity at either 40, 37, or 33 °C. Ham's F-12 medium containing galactose (1.8 mg/ml) instead of glucose as the carbon source was prepared with reagent grade chemicals and supplemented with 10% (v/v) dialyzed newborn calf serum, penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml). A plasmid (pSPORT1-cPGS1), carrying a putative CHOPGS1 cDNA (see Fig. 2), was cleaved at theSalI and NotI sites flanking the cDNA insert. The resulting fragment was inserted into the same restriction enzyme sites of mammalian expression vector, pSV-SPORT1 (Life Technologies, Inc.), under control of the SV40 promoter. The resulting construct, pSV-cPGS1, and pSV-SPORT1 were introduced into CHO-K1 cells using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A plasmid (pSPORT-cPGS1′) potentially expressing a chimeric derivative of the CHO PGS1 cDNA ORF underlacOP control was introduced into E. coli strain XL1-Blue. The cDNA insert in pSPORT-PGS1′ is identical to that shown in Fig. 2 except for an additional GG at the 5′-end. Because the cDNA library used to make this plasmid employed a SalI linker (5′-TCGACCCACGCGTCCG-3′) at the 5′-end, this plasmid should express a chimeric protein with following sequence fused to the N-terminal MET of the putative ORF encoded by the PGS1 cDNA: MTMITPS-SNTTHYRESWYACRYRSGIPGS-THAS-GRVS (the hyphens divide the sequence derived from β-galactosidase, the vector, the linker, and the region 5′ of the ORF, respectively). E. coli strain XL1-Blue transformed with pSPORT-cPGS1′ was cultivated in LB-medium containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin at 30 °C. Protein production was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside to the medium at a final concentration of 1 mm. After cultivation for 4 h in the presence of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, cells were collected, suspended in a buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and sonically disrupted for enzyme assay. A mammalian expression vector (pSV-OKneo) containing the G418 resistant determinant (28Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima J. Kuge O. Dickson R.C. Nagiec M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32108-32114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) was cleaved at the SalI and NotI sites and ligated with the CHO PGS1 cDNA generated by the digestion of pSPORT1-cPGS1 with same restriction enzymes. The resulting construct (pSVneo-cPGS1) was introduced into mutant PGS-S cells (23Ohtsuka T. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22908-22913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE reagent, and then the G418-resistant transformants were selected in medium containing 400 μg/ml of G418 at 37 °C. Stable transformant colonies were isolated with cloning cups, and finally purified by limited dilution to yield only one colony per well. PGP synthase activity was measured as described previously (23Ohtsuka T. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22908-22913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modification. The assay was performed at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.25 mm CDP-diacylglycerol, 0.1 mm sn-[U-14C]glycerol 3-phosphate (20 mCi/mmol), 0.25% Triton X-100, and 0.4 mg/ml of CHO cell extract protein in a total volume of 100 μl or 0.5 mg/ml of E. coli cell extract protein in a total volume of 200 μl. After incubation, the lipids were extracted by the sequential addition of 600 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v), 200 μl of chloroform, and 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. The lipid-containing chloroform phase was washed twice with 400 μl of chloroform/methanol/0.1m KCl (3:47:48, v/v), and the radioactivity in the chloroform phase was quantified as described previously (15Chang S.-C. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9829-9836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Lipid extraction from 32Pi-labeled cells was performed according to Bligh and Dyer (29Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar). Analysis of lipid composition and separation of lipids were performed by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography (30Nishijima M. Kuge O. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5784-5789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, one-dimensional thin layer chromatography was performed for the separation of PG or CL from other lipids. For the separation of PG, chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:25:10, v/v) was used as solvent. For the separation of CL, chloroform/methanol/water/ammonium hydroxide (130:75:6:2, v/v) was used with boric acid-impregnated Silica gel 60 thin layer plates (31Fine B.J. Sprecher H. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 660-663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. mRNA was isolated using the FastTrackTM 2.0 Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions from CHO-K1 and mutant PGS-S cells grown at 40 °C for 4 days. mRNA (4 μg) was separated on 1% agarose gels containing formaldehyde and transferred to a positively charged HybondTM N+ Nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary action using 20× SSC (3 m NaCl, 0.3m sodium citrate, pH 7.0) at room temperature. RNA was cross-linked to the membrane by baking at 80 °C for 2 h. TheNotI/SalI CHO PGS1 cDNA fragment from pSV-cPGS1 and a 2.0-kb fragment of human β-actin cDNA were32P-labeled with the Rediprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization reaction was performed in Rapid-Hyb buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A mouse Multiple Tissue Northern (MTNTM) Blot (CLONTECH) was hybridized with 32P-labeled CHO PGS1 cDNA and human β-actin cDNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. The results were visualized by exposure to x-ray film, and quantitative analysis was preformed with a Packard Instant Imager (Packard Instruments Inc.). In order to identify a mammalian cDNA clone encoding PGP synthase activity, we searched within the The Institute for Genome Research human gene index data base (http://www.tigr.org/) (32Adams M.D. Kerlavage A.R. Fleischmann R.D. Fuldner R.A. Bult C.J. Lee N.H. Kirkness E.F. Weinstock K.G. Gocayne J.D. White O. et al.Nature. 1995; 377 (suppl.): 3-174Google Scholar) for human ESTs that encode a similar protein to the yeast PGS1gene product (yPGS1) (15Chang S.-C. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9829-9836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Two human ESTs (The Institute for Genome Research gene identification number, THC122139 and T12593) were found to encode peptides that exhibited 41.6% identity with yPGS1 in a stretch of 178 amino acids and 43.4% identity in a stretch of 79 amino acids, respectively. A cDNA fragment that has similarity to yPGS1 in sequence was amplified from a CHO cDNA library using polymerase chain reaction with primers corresponding to the sequence of human ESTs. In order to isolate a full-length cDNA clone, an oligonucleotide derived from the sequence of the amplified CHO cDNA fragment was used for screening against a CHO cDNA library as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Eight positive plasmid clones were identified that have cDNA inserts of approximately 2.2 kb. Two of the clones, named pSPORT1-cPGS1 and pSPORT1-cPGS1′, were used for further analysis, and the gene corresponding to the isolated CHO cDNA was named PGS1. The CHO PGS1cDNA contained a large ORF encoding a protein of 553 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 62,329 Da (Fig. 2). Fifteen bases upstream of the poly(A) tail, there is a sequence (TATAAA) similar to the consensus poly(A) attachment signal (AATAAA) that is also functional as a poly(A) attachment signal (33Simonsen C.C. Levinson A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 2250-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Because the size of PGS1 mRNA was estimated at about 2.4 kb by Northern blot analysis (see below) and poly(A) length is usually from 150 to 200 bases (34Darnell J.E. Sci. Am. 1983; 249: 72-82Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the 2.2-kb CHO PGS1 cDNA lacking the poly(A) tail appears to be the complete cDNA. The amino acid sequence of cPGS1 deduced from the cDNA sequence exhibited 30% amino acid sequence identity with yPGS1, and the identical amino acids were scattered throughout the sequence (Fig.3 A). In Fig. 3 A,the underlined sequence indicates a region of high homology (79%) between cPGS1 and yPGS1. Within this region is the HKD motif (HXKXXXXDXXXXXXG). This motif (Fig.3 B) is found in several hydrolases and phosphotransferases (35Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 242-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) involved in phospholipid metabolism such as E. coliphosphatidylserine synthase, bacterial CL synthases, eukaryotic phospholipase D, and yPGS1. The presence of the HKD motif is consistent with the CHO PGS1 gene product encoding a PGP synthase (see below). To examine whether the CHO PGS1 gene encodes PGP synthase activity, the CHO PGS1 cDNA was cloned into mammalian expression vector, pSV-SPORT1, and the resultant plasmid, designated as pSV-cPGS1, and pSV-SPORT1 were introduced into CHO-K1 cells. The cell extract derived from the transient transfectant with pSV-cPGS1 exhibited a 15-fold higher specific activity (3550 pmol/min/mg of protein) of PGP synthase than that from CHO-K1 cells transfected with pSV-SPORT1 (230 pmol/min/mg of protein); the average of duplicate assays varied by less than 10%. This result suggested that the CHOPGS1 gene encodes PGP synthase activity. To obtain further evidence that CHO PGS1 encodes PGP synthase, E. coli strain XL1-Blue was transformed with pSPORT1-cPGS1′. The resultant transformant was cultured, and production of recombinant cPGS1 was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. PGP synthase activity in cell extracts in which recombinant protein production was induced (781 pmol/min/mg of protein) was 90-fold higher than that of cell extracts in which recombinant protein production was not induced (8.68 pmol/min/mg of protein); the average of duplicate assays varied by less than 10%. This result provides definitive evidence that CHOPGS1 encodes cPGS1. PGS-S is a temperature-sensitive CHO mutant strain in which PGP synthase activity is 1% of that in wild type CHO-K1 at the restrictive temperature of 40 °C (Ref. 23Ohtsuka T. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22908-22913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Table I). The mutant was isolated by introducing a second mutation into mutant PGS-P, in which PGP synthase activity is 50% of that in the parental strain CHO-K1 (23Ohtsuka T. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22908-22913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biosynthetic rate and content of PG in mutant PGS-S are both reduced to approximately 10% or less of that in CHO-K1. The biosynthetic rate and content of CL in mutant PGS-S are also reduced (23Ohtsuka T. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22908-22913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether the CHO PGS1 cDNA complements the defect in PG and CL biosynthesis of mutant PGS-S, the CHO PGS1 cDNA was cloned into pSV-OKneo, a mammalian expression vector with a G418-resistant determinant, and introduced into PGS-S cells. We analyzed five independent stable G418-resistant transformant cells for PGP synthase activity and found that PGP synthase activity of all transformants analyzed was higher than that of CHO-K1 cells. This result demonstrated that the CHO PGS1 cDNA complements the defect in PGP synthase activity in mutant PGS-S. A stable G418-resistant transformant, designated PGS-S/cPGS1, was purified and used for further characterization. The cell extract of transformant PGS-S/cPGS1 cultivated at 40 °C exhibited a 620-fold and 7.3-fold higher PGP synthase specific activity than that of mutant PGS-S and wild type CHO-K1, respectively (Table I).Table IPGP synthase activity of stable transformant PGS-S/cPGS1 cellsStrainPGP synthase activity(pmol/min)/mg of proteinCHO-K1193 ± 0.3PGS-S2.3 ± 0.8PGS-S/cPGS11420 ± 121Mutant PGS-S/cPGS1 cells with a temperature sensitive defect in PGP synthase were transfected with pSVneo-cPGS1, and a stable neo-resistant transformant (PGS-S/cPGS1) was isolated.

Open table in a new tab Mutant PGS-S/cPGS1 cells with a temperature sensitive defect in PGP synthase were transfected with pSVneo-cPGS1, and a stable neo-resistant transformant (PGS-S/cPGS1) was isolated. Cells were grown at 40 °C for 4 days, and the cell extracts were assayed for PGP synthase activity. The data shown are the mean value ± S.D. of triplicate assays. To investigate the rate of PG biosynthesis in transformant PGS-S/cPGS1, cells were labeled with 32Pi for 2, 4, and 8 h at 40 °C, and the metabolically labeled lipids were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 4, PG biosynthetic rate in PGS-S/cPGS1 cells was approximately 13-fold and approximately 2-fold higher than that in PGS-S and CHO-K1 cells, respectively. The rate of CL biosynthesis in transformant PGS-S/cPGS1 was also higher than that in mutant PGS-S and similar to that in CHO-K1. Phospholipid composition of transformant PGS-S/cPGS1 was determined by long term labeling of intact cells with32Pi. When the cells were cultivated with32Pi for 4 days at 40 °C, the PG level in transformant PGS-S/cPGS1 was more than 30-fold higher than that in mutant PGS-S and about 2.5-fold higher than that in wild type CHO-K1. The CL level in transformant PGS-S/cPGS1 was 2.3-fold higher than that in mutant PGS-S cells and similar to that in CHO-K1 (TableII). Under our experimental conditions, the radioactivity incorporated into phospholipid per cell was virtually identical among the transformant, the mutant, and the wild type cells (data not shown). These results indicated that the expression of CHOPGS1 cDNA complements the defect of PG and CL biosynthesis in mutant PGS-S.Table IIPhospholipid composition of transformant PGS-S/cPGS1CHO-K1PGS-SPGS-S/cPGS1% of total phospholipidsPhosphatidylglycerol1.1 ± 0.1<0.12.8 ± 0.1Cardiolipin2.7 ± 0.61.2 ± 1.12.7 ± 0.6Phosphatidic acid1.5 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.13.0 ± 0.2Phosphatidylcholin"
https://openalex.org/W2082818188,"Ceramide and ceramide-activated enzymes have been implicated in responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) and interleukin-1β (IL-1). Although TNF and IL-1 cause elevation of cellular ceramide, which is thought to act as a second messenger, LPS has been proposed to signal by virtue of structural similarity to ceramide. We have investigated the relationship between ceramide and LPS by comparing the effects of a cell-permeable ceramide analog (C2-ceramide) and LPS on murine macrophage cell lines and by measuring ceramide levels in macrophages exposed to LPS. We found that while both C2-ceramide and LPS activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), only LPS also activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). C2-ceramide was also unable to activate NF-κB, a transcription factor important for LPS-induced gene expression. Upon measurement of cellular ceramide in macrophage lines, we observed a small but rapid rise in ceramide, similar to that seen upon IL-1 or TNF treatment, suggesting LPS induces an increase in ceramide rather than interacting directly with ceramide-responsive enzymes. We found that C2-ceramide activated JNK and induced growth arrest in macrophages cell lines from both normal mice (Lps n) and mice genetically unresponsive to LPS (Lps d), whereas onlyLps n macrophages made these responses to LPS. Surprisingly, LPS treatment of Lps d macrophages induced a rise in ceramide similar to that observed in LPS-responsive cells. These results indicate that the wild type Lps allele is not required for LPS-induced ceramide generation and suggest that ceramide elevation alone is insufficent stimulus for most responses to LPS.

Macrophages exposed to LPS undergo a differentiation program that involves the up-regulation of genes whose products enhance the ability of macrophages to invade tissue, destroy bacteria, attract other immune system cells, and coordinate their responses. A localized proinflammatory response to LPS promotes host defense against bacterial infection, but if this response becomes systemic, as can occur during bacterial sepsis, it can result in endotoxic shock, which is often fatal. The principal high affinity receptor for LPS on myeloid cells is CD14, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked protein, which recognizes LPS in a complex with LPS-binding protein. Binding of LPS activates a variety of well characterized signaling pathways, possibly through an as yet unidentified coreceptor (1Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev.

It has been suggested that the lipid A portion of LPS shares some structural similarity with the cellular lipid ceramide (5Joseph C.K. Wright S.D. Bornmann W.G. Randolph J.T. Kumar E.R. Bittman R.

Today. 1995; 16: 297-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Ceramide can be generated by cleavage of membrane sphingomyelin by either acid or neutral sphingomyelinases (7Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), which remain to be fully characterized, or by de novo ceramide synthesis. Increases in cellular ceramide have been reported in many cell types in response to a variety of stimuli. These include the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1), as well as environmental stresses, such as UV light, differentiating agents, like vitamin D3, and other immunomodulatory signals, including Fas and CD28 (9Kolesnick R.

Micro-organisms have also been shown to stimulate increased cellular ceramide production as follows: binding of P-fimbriated Escherichia coli (11Hedlund M. Svensson M. Nilsson A. Duan R.-D.

Ceramide analogs have likewise been shown to activate ERK and JNK, and more recently p38, although the subset of MAPKs reported to be activated varies and may be cell line-dependent (17Cifone M.G.

Activated MAPKs phosphorylate and regulate multiple transcription factors; among these AP-1/c-Jun and ATF2 have both been shown to be activated by either LPS or ceramide analog treatment (21Welsh N.

The NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors is also activated by LPS and is critical for induced expression of many proinflammatory genes (3Sweet M.J. Hume D.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 8-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). In some cells, ceramide analogs reportedly activate NF-κB (27Schutz S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 28Yang Z. Costanzo M. Golde D.W. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20520-20523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although this is not always observed even in the same cell line (20Westwick J.K. Bielawska A.E. Dbaibo G. Hannun Y.A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8455-8458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The coordinate activation of NF-κB and other transcription factors by LPS results in the expression of genes encoding adhesion molecules, enzymes involved in the production of oxygen and nitrogen radicals, and inflammatory cytokines, notably TNF, IL-1, and IL-6 (1Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). These changes in gene expression reflect differentiation to an activated phenotype and are accompanied by growth arrest in bone marrow-derived macrophages (30Vadiveloo P.K. Vairo G. Novak U. Royston A.K. Whitty G. Filonzi E.L. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Hamilton J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 599-608PubMed Google Scholar), as well as in the murine macrophage line RAW 264.7 (31Paul A. Bryant C. Lawson M.F. Chilvers E.R. Plevin R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 1439-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In some macrophage cell lines and in fibroblasts, ceramide analogs have also been shown to induce expression of cytokines and cell adhesion molecules (32Barber S.A. Perera P.-Y. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2303-2305PubMed Google Scholar, 33Barber S.A. Detore G. McNally R. Vogel S.N. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3397-3400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Laulederkind S.J.F. Bielawska A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13094-13102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and ceramide treatment causes growth arrest in many eukaryotic cell types, including yeast (36Jayadev S. Liu B. Bielawska A.E. Lee J.Y. Nazaire F. Pushkareva M.Yu. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2047-2052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 37Dbaibo G.S.

Dobrowsky R.T. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9255-9261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Direct evidence for a link between LPS and ceramide was initially provided by the observation that LPS up-regulated a 97-kDa serine/threonine protein kinase activity, thought to correspond to ceramide-activated protein kinase (CAPK) (5Joseph C.K. Wright S.D. Bornmann W.G. Randolph J.T. Kumar E.R. Bittman R. Liu J. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17606-17610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This led to the proposal that LPS may act as a structural mimic of ceramide (6Wright S.D. Kolesnick R.N. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 297-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A report that CD14 and LPS-binding protein can transfer LPS into phospholipid bilayers supported the idea that LPS might interact directly with ceramide-responsive enzymes at the plasma membrane (39Wurfel M.M. Wright S.D. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3925-3934PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mimickry hypothesis was further strengthened by observations that bacterial sphingomyelinase or synthetic ceramide analogs induced expression of an array of LPS-inducible mRNAs in macrophages from LPS-responsive (Lps n) mice but not in those from C3H/HeJ (Lps d) mice, which are genetically hyporesponsive to LPS (32Barber S.A. Perera P.-Y. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2303-2305PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the intracellular trafficking of both fluorescently labeled LPS and labeled ceramide analogs is reportedly altered in Lps d macrophages (40Thieblemont N. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 2095-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), although LPS binding and internalization occur with normal kinetics in the LPS-unresponsive macrophages (41Kitchens R.L. Munford R.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1920-1928PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, other recent studies suggest that ceramide analogs and LPS, while having some overlapping effects, induced different patterns of gene expression (33Barber S.A. Detore G. McNally R. Vogel S.N. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3397-3400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and differed in their ability to prime myeloid cells for superoxide production (42Nakabo Y. Pabst M.J. Immunology. 1997; 90: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In an attempt to clarify the role of ceramide in LPS-induced signaling we have assayed the effects of LPS and the ceramide analog C2 on many of the above signaling molecules in murine macrophage lines. We found that both C2-ceramide and LPS activated JNK, but only LPS activated the ERK MAPKs. Similarly, NF-κB was not activated by C2-ceramide over a range of concentrations, in contrast to rapid activation by LPS treatment, arguing against the molecular mimickry hypothesis of LPS action. Measurement of cellular ceramide in LPS-treated macrophages revealed a rapid increase in ceramide levels, comparable to that induced by IL-1 or TNF. Both C2-ceramide and LPS induced growth arrest in a concentration-dependent manner in the RAW 264.7 macrophage line, suggesting that LPS-induced cellular ceramide could contribute to this response. In an Lps d macrophage line, responses to LPS were deficient, but C2-ceramide responses, namely JNK activation and growth arrest, were intact. Elevation of cellular ceramide was also observed in Lps dmacrophages treated with LPS, indicating that normal Lpsfunction is not required for this effect and that cellular ceramide increases alone cannot elicit many downstream LPS responses. Murine macrophage cell lines were expanded and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with glutathione supplemented with 5–10% fetal bovine serum (containing <0.06 units/ml endotoxin) at 37° C in 5% CO2 for a maximum of 8 weeks of passage. The RAW 264.7 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The Lps n and Lps dVN-11 retrovirally transformed lines were the kind gift of Dr. Paula Ricciardi-Castagnoli (CNR, Milan, Italy). The latter macrophage lines originated from infection of primary thymic cultures derived from Balb/c and C3H/HeJ mice, respectively. Bone marrow macrophages (BMMO) from C57Bl/6 mice were isolated and cultured as described previously (43Crowley M.T. Costello P.S. Fitzer-Attas C.J. Turner M. Meng F. Lowell C. Tybulewicz V.L.J. DeFranco A.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1027-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated as noted in figure legends and text with wild type LPS from E. coli K-235 (purified by phenol extraction and gel filtration; <1% protein), diphosphoryl lipid A from E. coli F-583, or paclitaxel from Taxus yannanensisobtained from Sigma, ReLPS from Salmonella minnesota (List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA); C2-ceramide (N-acetyl-d-erythro-sphingosine) and dihydro-C2-ceramide (dihydro-N-acetyl-d-erythro-sphingosine) obtained from Calbiochem or Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA); and recombinant mouse IL-1β or recombinant human or mouse TNF-α obtained from Genzyme Diagnostics (Cambridge, MA). Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Cells were plated 18–24 h prior to stimulation in tissue culture dishes of desired size to give ∼80% confluency on the day of the experiment. Cells were stimulated in culture medium and then washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution. Whole-cell extracts were prepared by direct addition of 0.3–1.0 ml of cold lysis buffer to the dish. Lysis buffer consisted of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF and was supplemented immediately prior to use with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride or PefablocTM (Boehringer Mannheim), 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmaprotinin, and 1 mm leupeptin. Following high speed centrifugation to remove debris, the protein concentration of extracts was determined using the BCA (Pierce) or Bio-Rad (Bio-Rad) protein assay. Whole-cell extracts containing 30–50 μg of total protein were separated by electrophoresis in 10% SDS-PAGE gels for IκBα immunoblotting or in 12% SDS-PAGE gels (acrylamide/bis-acylamide ratio of 120:1) for ERK1/ERK2 and JNK immunoblots (44Hambleton J. McMahon M. DeFranco A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The gels were transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked with 4% dried non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.5% Tween 20 (TBST), and incubated with specific antibody overnight at 4° C. After extensive washing in TBST, a horseradish peroxidase-coupled sheep (Boehringer Mannheim) or donkey (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) anti-rabbit IgG antibody was added to the blots for 1 h. After further washes the peroxidase activity was revealed using Renaissance™ chemiluminescence reagents (NEN Life Science Products). The primary antibodies used for immunoblotting were raised against IκBα- (sc-203, -371, -847) or ERK1-derived (sc-94) immunogenic peptides (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or against JNK1 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Whole-cell extracts containing 200–500 μg of total protein were diluted to a 1-ml volume with lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with 10 μl of specific antibody to JNK1 (sc-474) or ERK2 (sc-154) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4° C and then for 1–2 h with 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). The resulting immunoprecipitate was washed extensively with lysis buffer and once with kinase assay buffer (25 mmHepes (pH 7.6), 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4). The kinase reaction was performed in kinase assay buffer with 20 μm unlabeled ATP and 10 μCi of [33P] or [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech or NEN Life Science Products) and 1 mg/ml substrate in a 30-μl volume. A glutathione S-transferase (GST) c-Jun (amino acids 1–79) fusion protein, prepared in our laboratory as described previously (15Hambleton J. Weinstein S. Lem L. DeFranco A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2774-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), provided the substrate for JNK kinase assays; GST-Elk1 (New England Biolabs) was used as substrate for ERK2 activity assays. Kinase reactions were performed at 30° C for 15 min and terminated by addition of Laemmli gel-loading buffer. The kinase reactions were loaded on SDS-PAGE gels and following electrophoresis were either dried down and exposed or in some cases were transferred for immunoblotting (see above) to verify equivalent kinase precipitation and loading across samples. A κB oligonucleotide probe (described in Ref. 44Hambleton J. McMahon M. DeFranco A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) was filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and labeled with [γ-33P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Whole-cell extracts were prepared as above, but the salt concentration was increased to 400 mm to ensure complete extraction of nuclear proteins. Specific binding of extract proteins to the κB probe was assessed by incubation for 15 min at room temperature in a solution containing 7.5 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 35 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 7.5% glycerol, and 0.5 μg of poly(dI·dC) (Boehinger Mannheim), followed by electrophoretic separation in a 5% polyacrylamide gel. Ceramide was labeled in vivo by incubation of cells in [3H]palmitate (10 μCi/well) in 6-well plates for 24–48 h prior to stimulation, using a method similar to that described by Liu and Anderson (45Liu P. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27179-27185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated with LPS or IL-1 in triplicate or quadruplicate wells in the same culture medium containing [3H]palmitate at 37° C. Unstimulated control wells were included on these plates and were labeled and processed simultaneously with stimulated samples. Following stimulation, cells were washed once with cold PBS, and flash-frozen in a dry-ice/ethanol bath. Water was added to each well, and cells were removed by scraping and transferred to glass tubes. Wells were rinsed with methanol/hydrochloric acid (40:1), and cellular lipids were extracted in chloroform and NaCl (1 n), and the chloroform phase was dried under nitrogen. The resulting labeled lipid mixture was resuspended in chloroform with 5% methanol and 30 μg of cold C18-ceramide from bovine brain as carrier. Samples were separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel plates (19-channel LK6D; Whatman) in a solvent of toluene/methanol (85:15) along with lipid standards for phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, sphingomyelin, and C16- and/or C18-ceramide. The ceramide band was visualized by iodine vapor staining and autoradiography, and the corresponding area of the plate was recovered, scintillation fluid (Cytoscint, ICN) was added, and samples were counted in a β-scintillation counter. Alternatively, ceramide content of RAW 264.7 cells was assessed by diacylglycerol kinase labeling in vitro according to the method of Preiss et al. (46Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. RAW 264.7 macrophages were seeded in 12- or 6-well tissue culture plates (Corning) 18–24 h prior to stimulation. Following stimulation, total cellular lipids were extracted and dried as described above. Extracted total cellular lipids and ceramide (Avanti Polar Lipids) and diolein standards (Sigma) were resuspended in a solution containing 5 mm cardiolipin and subjected to phosphorylation by diacylglycerol kinase (Calbiochem) in a reaction containing 50 mm imidazole, 50 mm NaCl, 12.5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm ATP, 10 μmdiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; (Sigma), and 50 μCi of [32P] or [γ-33P]ATP. Labeled phosphatidic acid and ceramide phosphate were extracted, dried under nitrogen, resuspended in chloroform with 5% methanol, and separated by TLC in a chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:15:5) mixture. Labeled ceramide phosphate signals were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Phosphorylation of ceramide was linear over the concentration range tested (100–1000 pmol of bovine brain ceramide). Cellular ceramide levels in unstimulated cells were on the order of 100 pmol/105 cells, as judged by signals obtained with ceramide standards. Flow cytometry was used to determine the cell surface expression of various markers on murine macrophage lines and bone marrow-derived macrophages. Cells (∼106/sample) were removed from tissue culture plastic by gentle pipetting following treatment with 6 mm EDTA/PBS, washed, and resuspended in 100 μl of staining buffer (PBS, 2% fetal bovine serum, 0.02% azide) with rat anti-mouse FcγR blocking antibody (0.25 μg), and 10 min later 5 μg of specific fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated antibody was added. FITC-conjugated antibodies (PharMingen) used for staining were rat anti-mouse antibodies to Mac-1, CD14, B7.2, I-Ab, I-Ad, B220, CD3, and anti-rat IgG (for FcγR staining) and a hamster anti-mouse antibody to B7.1. After 30 min staining with antibody on ice, the cells were washed twice and then resuspended in staining buffer with 1 μg/ml propidium iodide. FITC staining was determined on a logarithmic scale, after exclusion of propidium iodide positive (dead) cells. Flow cytometry was also used to quantify growth arrest in macrophages, much as described by Page and DeFranco (47Page D.M. DeFranco A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3003-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cells were divided into 6-well plates (∼2 × 105/well), and 16 h later were treated with C2-ceramide or LPS. Treatment continued for 24 h prior to cell harvesting, and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) (15 μm) was added during the final 8 h of culture. Cells were removed by EDTA treatment, washed in PBS, and fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 2.5m HCl containing 0.5% Triton X-100, washed in PBS plus 0.5% Tween, and labeled with FITC-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody (20 μl/106 cells) (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Following extensive washing, BrdUrd-positive and -negative fractions were assessed by flow cytometry in staining buffer with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide. In separate experiments, cell death following 1–6 h treatment with C2-ceramide or dihydro-C2-ceramide was assessed by flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide (1 μg/ml) uptake by nonpermeabilized cells. Sheep red blood cells (SRBC) (Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp., Westbury, NY) were washed in PBS and resuspended in a 5% solution (∼109/ml). This solution was incubated with Na251CrO4 (300 μCi/ml) for 2–3 h, and then washed with PBS to remove unabsorbed 51Cr label. SRBC were then opsonized with anti-SRBC IgG 30 min at room temperature, washed in PBS, and resuspended in RPMI at a dilution of 1:300. The 51Cr-labeled opsonized SRBC (0.5 ml/well) were added to confluent macrophages growing in 24-well plates that had been chilled on ice. Plated were centrifuged at 150 × g for 5 min to settle the 51Cr-labeled IgG-coated SRBC on the adherent macrophages. Phagocytosis was initiated by adding warm media to the wells. After a 30-min incubation at 37° C, phagocytosis was terminated by removing the plates to ice and washing with cold PBS. Uningested labeled SRBC were lysed by addition of water (750 μl/well) for 1 min. After a further wash in PBS, adherent macrophages with ingested 51Cr-labeled SRBC were lysed in 500 μl of 1% SDS and transferred to tubes for quantitation of radioactivity in a CliniGamma counter (LKB-Wallac, Finland). Percent phagocytosis was calculated as the mean cpm of 3–4 wells treated as above/mean total cpm of replicate wells treated as described above but without hypotonic lysis of uningested 51Cr-SRBC, i.e.ingested/bound SRBC × 100%. Macrophages growing in 24-well plates (∼106/well) in 1 ml of medium were stimulated with LPS or C2-ceramide, as indicated. Supernatants were ha"

https://openalex.org/W2047927755,"Published studies demonstrate that lipid transfer inhibitor protein (LTIP) is an important regulator of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity. Although LTIP inhibits CETP activity among different lipoprotein classes, it preferentially suppresses transfer events involving low density lipoprotein (LDL), whereas transfers involving high density lipoprotein as donor are less affected. In this study, we report the purification of LTIP and the expression of its cDNA in cultured cells. Purification of LTIP, in contrast to other published protocols, took advantage of the tight association of this protein with LDL. Ultracentrifugally isolated LDL was further purified on anti-apoE and apoA-I affinity columns. Affinity purified LDL was delipidated by tetramethylurea, and the tetramethylurea-soluble proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein migrating at a molecular mass of ∼33 kDa was excised from the gel and its N-terminal amino acid sequence determined. The 14-amino acid sequence obtained showed complete homology with the sequence deduced for apolipoprotein F (apoF) cDNA isolated from Hep G2 cells. On Western blots, peptide-specific antibodies raised against synthetic fragments of apoF reacted with the same 33-kDa protein in LTIP-containing fractions purified from LDL and from lipoprotein-deficient plasma. In contrast to that previously reported, apoF was shown to be associated almost exclusively with LDL, identical to the distribution of LTIP activity. The cDNA for apoF was cloned from a human liver cDNA library, ligated into a mammalian expression vector, and transiently transfected into COS-7 cells. Conditioned media containing secreted apoF demonstrated CETP inhibitor activity, whereas cells transfected with vector alone did not. This CETP inhibitor activity was efficiently removed from the media by nickel-Sepharose, consistent with the 6-His tag incorporated into recombinant apoF. By Western blot, the 6-His-tagged protein had a molecular weight slightly larger than native apoF. The CETP inhibitor activity of recombinant apoF possessed the same LDL specificity, oleate sensitivity, and dependence on lipoprotein concentration as previously noted for LTIP. We conclude that LTIP and apoF are identical.

Zilversmit, was the first to identify and partially characterize a novel protein in human plasma that inhibits cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) 1The abbreviations used are: CETP, cholesteryl ester transfer protein; LTIP, lipid transfer inhibitor protein; CE, cholesteryl ester; TG, triglyceride; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; LDL, low density lipoprotein; HDL, high density lipoprotein; apoF, apolipoprotein F; TMU, 1,1,3,3-tetramethylurea; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid. activityin vitro (1Morton R.E.

Acta. 1984; 795: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and by Nishide et al. (3Nishide T. Tollefson J.H. Albers J.J. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 149-158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have confirmed and extended the initial characterization of this factor as a unique ∼30,000-35,000 molecular weight acidic glycoprotein. This protein, LTIP, equally inhibits the CETP-mediated transfer of TG and CE (1Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11992-11995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Son Y.-SC. Zilversmit D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 795: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The mechanism of inhibition has not been studied in detail; however, limited studies by us and others (1Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11992-11995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Son Y.-SC. Zilversmit D.B. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1985; 260: 12593-12599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that LTIP disrupts the association of CETP with lipoproteins. In contrast to the effects of other apoproteins that have been shown to possess CETP inhibitory activity when assayed at high concentrationsin vitro (2Son Y.-SC. Zilversmit D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 795: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 5Lagrost L. Perségol L. Lallemant C. Gambert P. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1285-1297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), LTIP shows lipoprotein specificity in its inhibitory capacity. LTIP preferentially suppresses lipid transfers involving LDL (1.019 < d <1.063 g/ml)(9, 10) while having the least effect on transfers between VLDL (d <1.006 g/ml) and HDL (1.063 < d <1.21 g/ml). In mass lipid transfer assays with whole plasma, LTIP supplementation leads to decreased efflux of CE from LDL to VLDL and increased efflux of CE from HDL to VLDL, resulting in HDL that are better substrates for lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (10Morton R.E. Greene D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 836-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have proposed that this happens because plasma TG, not CETP, is rate-limiting for net lipid transfer in normal plasma (11Mann C.J. Yen F.T. Grant A.M. Bihain B.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 2059-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 12Murakami T. Michelagnoli S. Longhi R. Gianfranceschi G. Pazzucconi F. Calabresi L. Sirtori C.R. Franceschini G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1819-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Thus, in the presence of LTIP, less TG is expended by transfer to LDL, allowing transfer from VLDL to HDL to be increased. Among control subjects, LTIP activity levels in whole plasma correlate negatively with the rate of transfer between VLDL and LDL and with HDL size (9Morton R.E. Steinbrunner J.V. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1843-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recent studies have substantiated these observations in a patient population deficient in LTIP activity (13Serdyuk A.P. Morton R.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1716-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Additionally, we have shown that CETP itself has little preference for lipid transfer from either LDL or HDL but, rather, the preferential transfer of CE from HDL seen in normal plasma is a function of LTIP activity (14Morton R.E. Serdyuk A.P. Circulation. 1997; 96: I-108Google Scholar). High, yet physiological, concentrations of free fatty acids can inactivate LTIP (15Morton R.E. Greene D.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3041-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), suggesting that LTIP activity can be regulated by dietary status. Together, these data strongly suggest that LTIP alters the overall pattern of lipid transfer events between lipoproteins by functioning as a traffic policeman, impeding lipid fluxes between some lipoproteins while allowing others to continue. Therefore the effectiveness of lipid transfer activity in plasma is determined by both CETP and LTIP activities. Our efforts in the past to isolate proteins that inhibit CETP have consistently supported the conclusion that a single protein is responsible for most, if not all, of the inhibitory activity observed in whole human plasma. Purification of LTIP has been hampered by its tendency to associate with other plasma proteins, most particularly apoD (10Morton R.E. Greene D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 836-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), during purification. Interference with CETP/LTIP assays by low levels of many dissociating agents commonly used to disrupt protein-protein interactions has greatly limited the methods that can be used to dissociate LTIP-protein complexes for further purification. In this report we have developed an alternative approach to LTIP purification that takes advantage of our observations that LTIP activity is primarily associated with LDL in plasma (10Morton R.E. Greene D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 836-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that a portion of this LTIP activity is retained on LDL after its isolation by standard ultracentrifugal techniques. We report here the isolation of LTIP from human LDL and the cloning and expression of its cDNA. Cholesteryl [1a,2a(n)-3H]oleate (50 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. BSA (fraction V), diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and all reagents for salt and buffer solutions were obtained from Sigma. Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, CNBr-activated Sepharose, and dextran sulfate (M r = 500,000) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and CM52-cellulose was from Whatman. 1,1,3,3-Tetramethylurea, (Sigma) was repurified by distillation within 1 week of use and stored at 4 °C in the dark. Protein G- and protein A-agarose were purchased from Pierce. Fresh human plasma from the Blood Bank of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation was the source of VLDL, LDL, and HDL. Lipoproteins were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation (16Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar), extensively dialyzed against 0.9% NaCl, 0.01% EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, pH 8.5, and stored at 4 °C. Lipoproteins were quantitated based on their total cholesterol content. In some instances, lipoproteins were radiolabeled with [3H]CE by a lipid-dispersion method (1Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11992-11995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoA-I was isolated from fresh human plasma by a combination of ultracentrifugation, HDL delipidation, and chromatofocusing of human apoHDL (17Jauhiainen M.S. Laitinen M.V. Penttila I.M. Puhakainen E.V. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1982; 122: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Partially purified CETP was isolated from lipoprotein-deficient human plasma by hydrophobic and ion exchange chromatography as described previously (18Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 1058-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stored in 0.27 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. LTIP was partially purified from lipoprotein-deficient plasma as described previously (1Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11992-11995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Morton R.E. Greene D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 836-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assays for CETP and LTIP activity were performed according to our previously published methods (19Pattnaik N.M. Montes A. Hughes L.B. Zilversmit D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 530: 428-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 20Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 663: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Morton R.E. Greene D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2094-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CETP activity was routinely measured in assays of lipid transfer between radiolabeled LDL ([3H]CE LDL) and unlabeled HDL (10 μg of cholesterol each). At the end of the assay, LDL and HDL were separated by the phosphate-manganese procedure (19Pattnaik N.M. Montes A. Hughes L.B. Zilversmit D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 530: 428-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 20Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 663: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). CETP activity was determined from the fraction of label transferred to the acceptor and expressed as percent kt (19Pattnaik N.M. Montes A. Hughes L.B. Zilversmit D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 530: 428-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). CETP inhibitor activity was measured in the assays described above or in assays where lipid transfer was measured between radiolabeled LDL ([3H]CE LDL) and biotinylated LDL (21Morton R.E. Greene D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2094-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation, these lipoproteins were separated by incubation with avidin-Sepharose. Inhibitor activity is expressed as the percent inhibition of a standard amount of CETP added to the assay. Goat anti-human apoA-I and anti-apoE IgG (Calbiochem) were purified from antisera by affinity chromatography on protein G-agarose as detailed by the manufacturer (Pierce). Eluted IgG-containing fractions (25–28 mg) were pooled, dialyzed versus 0.1 m NaHCO3, 0.5m NaCl, pH 8.3, overnight, and then coupled to 10 ml of CNBr-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's protocol. Synthetic fragments of apoF were prepared by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase chemistry utilizing a multiple antigen peptide carrier core; antibodies to this antigen were elicited in rabbits (Bio-Synthesis, Inc., Lewisville, TX). Goat anti-apoF antiserum, prepared as described previously for apoF isolated from delipidated HDL by ion exchange chromatography (22Koren E. McConathy W.J. Alaupovic P. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5347-5351Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), was the gift of Dr. Petar Alaupovic. Citrated human plasma was obtained from the Blood Bank of the Cleveland Clinic, and LDL was isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation (50,000 rpm, 50.2 Ti rotor, 10 °C, 18 h) as the 1.019 < d < 1.063 g/ml fraction (16Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). LDL was extensively dialyzed versus 0.9% NaCl, 0.02% EDTA, pH 8.5. LDL was further purified by chromatography on two affinity columns. Tandem columns of anti-apoA-I-Sepharose (1 × 19 cm) and anti-apoE-Sepharose (1 × 10 cm) were packed and equilibrated at room temperature with 0.9% NaCl, 0.01% EDTA, pH 7.4. LDL (5 ml, 15–18.5 mg protein) was applied to the columns and eluted by 0.9% NaCl, 0.01% EDTA, pH 7.4, at a rate of 2 ml/h. Eluted fractions containing LDL, as determined by cholesterol assay, were pooled and subsequently extracted by TMU as described below. After elution, the columns were recycled for subsequent use by extensive washing with 0.9% NaCl, 0.01% EDTA (pH 11, adjusted with NH4OH), followed by the same buffer at pH 7.4. TMU extraction of LDL was performed by a modification of the method Kane et al. (23Kane J.P. Sata T. Hamilton R.L. Havel R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 56: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Briefly, in a disposable glass tube, affinity purified LDL (600 μg of protein) was adjusted to 1 ml with 0.9% NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 9, and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Pre-warmed TMU (0.75 ml) was added to each 1-ml sample, mixed gently, and incubated at 37 °C in a sealed tube until the apoB-lipid pellicle floated at the top of the tube (2–3 h). After filtration through a glass wool plug, the TMU-soluble proteins were dialyzed against 0.9% NaCl, 0.01% EDTA, pH 7.4, buffer overnight and concentrated about 10-fold (Centricon 10, Amicon, Beverly, MA). Pre-made 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels (Integrated Separation Systems, Natick, MA) were pre-run for 1 h (20 mA) as recommended by the manufacturer. Samples were combined with 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (0.3125 mTris-HCl, 25% β-mercaptoethanol, 50% glycerol, 0.5 mg/ml bromophenyl blue, pH 8.3) and heated for 5 min at 100 °C. Samples were applied and gels developed at 20 mA for 1.5 h. Proteins were visualized by silver staining (Dai-ichi silver stain kit, Integrated Separation Systems) or Coomassie Blue (Sigma). For Western blot analyses, proteins in SDS-PAGE gels were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose at 4 °C overnight as described by Towbin et al. (24Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline, reacted with the indicated antibody followed by reaction with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Reaction products were visualized by reaction with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposure to x-ray film. When detecting apoproteins on intact lipoproteins, either in serum or in isolated form, samples were fractionated by one-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis (25Hoff H.F. Whitaker T.E. O'Neil J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 602-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipoproteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, which was backed with wetted filter paper, by passive adsorption for 15 min. Blots were blocked with 5% powdered milk, 2% calf serum, and 1% BSA in 0.9% NaCl, 0.1% EDTA, pH 7.6. Buffers for the blocking step and all subsequent steps contained 1% BSA in 0.9% NaCl, 0.1% EDTA, pH 7.6, the latter being important to prevent lipid oxidation in the nitrocellulose-bound lipoproteins. Immune complexes were visualized by reaction with ECL as indicated above. Alternatively, gels were dried and lipoproteins visualized by staining with Fat Red 7B (25Hoff H.F. Whitaker T.E. O'Neil J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 602-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on a 14-amino acid N-terminal sequence obtained for the 33-kDa protein from LDL, a 26-nucleotide primer (5′-GAGGACTGTGAGAATGAGAAGGAGCA-3′) was synthesized (Genosys, The Woodlands, TX) and used to screen a human liver cDNA library by 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR with Marathon-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The single, 1.2-kilobase pair product was ligated into a pCR 3.1-Bi plasmid by TA cloning (Eukaryotic TA Cloning Kit, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and transformed into Escherichia coli (TOP10F′) according to the methods described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). DNA sequencing was performed with a BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit using the ABI PRISM 377XL DNA sequencer (26Lee L.G. Spurgeon S.L. Heiner C.R. Benson S.C. Rosenblum B.B. Menchen S.M. Graham R.J. Constentinescu A. Upadhya K.G. Cassel J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2816-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Based on homology of sequenced clones with apoF (27Day J.R. Albers J.J. Gilbert T.L. Whitmore T.E. McConathy W.J. Wolfbauer G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1146-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), additional gene-specific primers (see “Results”) were prepared to permit PCR cloning of the cDNA fragment of apoF encoding for amino acids 147–308, which corresponds to the complete sequence of the secreted protein. A 492-base pairHindIII/XbaI restriction fragment was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector, pSecTag (Invitrogen), to permit the synthesis and secretion of apoF with six C-terminal histidine residues. COS-7 cells were transfected by the LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, in six-well culture plates, 1 × 105 cells were seeded per well in 2 ml of the appropriate growth medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C in a CO2 environment until the cells were 50% confluent. Each well received DNA (1 μg) and 5 μl of LipofectAMINE in a final volume of 1 ml of serum-free medium. After incubating with DNA complexes for 24 h, cells were washed and incubated in serum-free media for 48 h. The media were collected, briefly centrifuged, concentrated on Centricon 10 membranes (Amicon), and CETP inhibitory activity in the conditioned media determined. Protein was quantitated by the method of Lowry et al. (28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as modified by Peterson (29Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7141) Google Scholar), with BSA as standard. Total cholesterol of lipoproteins was assayed by a colorimetric, enzymatic method using Cholesterol 100 reagent kit (Sigma). For amino acid analyses, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by electrophoresis in transfer buffer (10 mm CAPS, 10% methanol, pH 11.0) at 10 °C for 2 h (30LeGrendre N. Mansfield M. Weiss A. Matsudaira P. Matsudaira P.T. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1993: 71-101Crossref Google Scholar). Transferred proteins were visualized by brief staining with 0.1% Coomassie Blue (Sigma) in 50% methanol, and bands of interest were excised. N-terminal protein sequence analysis was carried out with an Applied Biosystems Procise, model 492 protein sequencer fitted with a 140c microgradient system, 785A programmable absorbance detector, and a 610A (version 2.1) data analysis system (31Edman P. Begg G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 80-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2426) Google Scholar, 32Hunkapillar M.W. Hewick R.M. Dreyer W.J. Hood L.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). To facilitate the purification of LTIP by an approach that minimizes the potential for apoD contamination (10Morton R.E. Greene D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 836-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we devised a protocol to purify this protein from LDL, which contains most all LTIP activity in native plasma (10Morton R.E. Greene D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 836-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the recovery of LTIP activity in the d >1.21 g/ml fraction after ultracentrifugation, compared with that in lipoprotein-deficient plasma prepared by dextran sulfate-manganese precipitation (which dissociates all LTIP from lipoproteins (9Morton R.E. Steinbrunner J.V. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1843-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar)), we have estimated that ∼30% of plasma LTIP activity is retained in this lipoprotein fraction after isolation. Although LDL only retains a small portion of its original LTIP, this approach provides a means of avoiding apoD contamination since apoD resides on apoA-I-containing lipoproteins (33Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3327-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Beginning with isolated LDL, the purification scheme involved affinity adsorption of minor contaminating proteins, apoE and A-I, with solid phase antibodies to these apoproteins, followed by TMU extraction (23Kane J.P. Sata T. Hamilton R.L. Havel R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 56: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) of the affinity purified LDL. The lipid-free, TMU-soluble proteins from LDL exhibited inhibitory activity. This purification scheme typically resulted in ∼530-fold purification of CETP inhibitor activity with ∼8% recovery (Table I). The CETP inhibitor activity in the TMU-soluble LDL fraction manifested the same preference for lipid transfers involving only LDL and suppression by sodium oleate as we have previously observed for LTIP in the CM-cellulose fraction of LTIP isolated from lipoprotein-deficient plasma (Table II). In contrast to the inhibitory activity in the CM-cellulose and LDL-TMU fraction, apolipoprotein A-I, which suppresses CETP activity under some conditions (2Son Y.-SC. Zilversmit D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 795: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15Morton R.E. Greene D.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3041-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), was unaffected by 10 μm oleate (data not shown). The TMU-soluble fraction from LDL was further resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.1, 3rd lane). A slightly diffuse staining band near 33 kDa was observed in the LDL-derived proteins, but neither VLDL nor HDL contained detectable protein of similar molecular weight, consistent with the near-exclusive association of LTIP with LDL. This molecular mass compares well with that determined for LTIP (30–35 kDa) based on the elution of LTIP activity on gel filtration under dissociating conditions (1Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11992-11995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although other small molecular weight proteins (<10,000 molecular weight, presumably apoCs) were present in the LDL-derived fraction, these proteins were not found in LTIP prepared from lipoprotein-deficient plasma (Fig. 1, 2nd lane), suggesting that these contaminants do not contribute to the LTIP activity measured in the LDL protein fraction. Assuming the inhibitor activity in the TMU-soluble LDL fraction is due to the 33-kDa component, 35 pmol of inhibitor protein was sufficient to suppress CETP activity by 50% in the standard LDL to LDL transfer assay, which contains 33 pmol of lipoprotein. This equates to an IC50 of ∼0.05 μm.Table IPurification of LTIP activity from LDLFractionProteinCholesterolLTIPspecific activityaLTIP-specific activity = % inhibition/mg of protein.PurificationRecoverymgfold%Plasma168345.961.71100LDL19.928.1211725.430Affinity purified LDL18.727.2NDbND, not determined.NDNDTMU-soluble fraction0.27032,7685317.6LTIP was purified from human plasma as described in the text.

https://openalex.org/W2140809061,"The metabolic pathways specified by the glc and ace operons in Escherichia coli yield glyoxylate as a common intermediate, which is acted on by two malate synthase isoenzymes: one encoded by glcB and the other by aceB. Null mutations in either gene exhibit no phenotype, because of cross-induction of the ace operon by glycolate and the glc operon by acetate. In this study, the regulation of the glc operon, comprising the structural genes glcDEFGB, was analyzed at the molecular level. This operon, activated by growth on glycolate, is transcribed as a single message and is under the positive control of GlcC encoded by a divergent gene. Expression of the glc operon is strongly dependent on the integration host factor (IHF) and is repressed by the global respiratory regulator ArcA-P. In vitro gel-shift experiments demonstrated direct binding of the promoter DNA to IHF and ArcA-P. Mutant analysis indicated that cross-induction of the glc operon by acetate is mediated by the GlcC protein that recognizes the compound as an alternative effector.

In this study we determined the antiproliferative effects of interferon gamma (IFNγ) on the glioblastoma cell lines T98G, SNB-19 and U-373, focusing on the ability of IFNγ to increase levels of p21WAF1/CIP1, an important negative regulator of cell cycle events. IFNγ was found to inhibit the growth of all cell lines, with inhibition ranging from 82.2% to 45.4%. Flow cytometry analysis showed that IFNγ treatment caused a cell cycle delay in the G1 or S phases. The strength of this delay varied, correlating with the degree by which IFNγ inhibited proliferation of each cell line. IFNγ treatment increased the production of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) p21WAF1/CIP1 in all cell lines, the level and kinetics of production of which correlated with the degree and stage of inhibition of cellular proliferation. Further, immunoprecipitation of p21WAF1/CIP1 in complexes of p21WAF1/CIP1/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2)/cyclin showed that the amount of p21WAF1/CIP1 in the complexes and the inhibition of cdk2-cyclin kinase activity correlated with the level of p21WAF1/CIP1 produced in the cells by IFNγ. These results show that IFNγ has significant antiproliferative effects on the glioblastoma cell lines and suggest that p21WAF1/CIP1 plays a role in mediating these effects."

Sen G.C. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 375-399Google Scholar, 2Hovanessian A.G. J. Interferon Res. 1991; 11: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Trimers and higher oligomers of 2-5(A) can activate a latent ribonuclease, RNase L, by causing its dimerization (3Dong B. Silverman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4133-4137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Cellular synthesis of the 2-5(A) synthetases is induced by interferons and viral infection of interferon-treated cells causes activation of the enzymes by viral dsRNA, production of 2-5(A), activation of RNase L, and degradation of RNA. This chain of events can prevent the replication of certain classes of viruses, such as picornaviruses, but other viruses are not affected by the 2-5(A) synthetase/RNase L pathway (4Gribaudo G. Lembo D. Cavallo G. Landolfo S. Lengyel P. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1748-1757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). According to their sizes, the 2-5(A) synthetases can be divided into three classes: large, medium, and small, and within each class there are many isozymes (2Hovanessian A.G. J. Interferon Res. 1991; 11: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Multiple genes, alternative splicing of the mRNAs, and differential post-translational modification of the proteins add to the diversity of these enzymes. For example, in mouse, there are at least three genes encoding small synthetases and 9-2 and 3-9 isozymes are encoded by two alternately spliced mRNAs of the same gene (5Rutherford M.N. Kumar A. Nissim A. Chebath J. Williams B.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 6Ghosh S.K. Kusari J. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Samanta H. Kumar R. Sen G.C. J. Biol.

Similarly, the human medium synthetase gene gives rise to two alternatively spliced mRNAs encoding the isozymes P69 and P71 (8Marie I. Hovanessian A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9933-9939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The three classes of the enzymes are structurally related and highly conserved across the species. The small synthetases are homotetramers, the medium synthetases are dimers, and the large isozyme is a monomer (9Marie I. Svab J. Robert N. Galabru J. Hovanessian A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18601-18607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These enzymes are interesting to study for many reasons: their interferon inducibility, their activation by dsRNA, their ability to synthesize 2′-5′-linked oligonucleotides, and their cellular actions. Structure-function and enzymological studies of 2-5(A) synthetases have not progressed well in the past because of the lack of an efficient expression system for recombinant proteins. Recently, we have used a bacterial system and a insect cell/baculovirus system effectively for producing a small isozyme of 2-5(A) synthetase and its mutants (10Bandyopadhyay S. Ghosh A. Sarkar S.N. Sen G.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3824-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 11Desai S.Y. Patel R.C. Sen G.C. Malhotra P. Ghadge G.D. Thimmapaya B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3454-3461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The same systems were used in the current study for producing the recombinant medium synthetase P69. The recombinant P69 protein was purified and used for enzymological studies. Bacterially produced P69 was enzymatically inactive but recombinant P69 produced in insect cells was highly active, completely dependent of dsRNA, non-processive, and stable. The recombinant protein was a dimer and had sugar modifications that were required for its activity. A 25-bp dsRNA, but not a 15-bp dsRNA, could activate P69 maximally and free 2′-OH groups on the dsRNA were required for its activity. Total RNA was prepared using RNAzol (Tel-Test Inc.) from human Daudi cells treated with 200 units/ml interferon α for 12 h. This RNA were reverse transcribed by priming with random hexamers using reverse transcriptase kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by PCR using primers (primer 1: GGCCGAATTCCATATGATGGGAAATGGGGAGTCC; primer 2: CCGGGTCGACTTAAAGCTTGATGACTTTTACCGGCAC) specific to 5′ and 3′ end sequences of P69, respectively. The PCR cycles were (i) 95 °C for 5 min; (ii) 95 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 2 min, 72 °C for 1 min (30 cycles); and (iii) 72 °C for 10 min. The full-length PCR product was purified by low melting-agarose gel electrophoresis and cloned into pCRII vector (TA cloning kit, Invitrogen). To examine the protein production from the construct, it was translated in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, Promega), and tested for 2-5(A) synthetase activity as mentioned earlier (12Ghosh A. Desai S.Y. Sarkar S.N. Ramaraj P. Ghosh S.K. Bandyopadhyay S. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15452-15458Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The PCR product was excised out from pCRII vector withNdeI and SalI, which were incorporated in the PCR primers for the convenience of subsequent cloning, and cloned into the same sites of pET28a vector (Novagen), which puts a hexahistidine tag at the NH2 terminus of P69. Bacterial expression and partial purification of NH2-terminal hexahistidine-tagged P69 was done in a similar way as described earlier for 9-2 (11Desai S.Y. Patel R.C. Sen G.C. Malhotra P. Ghadge G.D. Thimmapaya B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3454-3461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The yield of pure P69 protein from bacterial expression system was 5 μg/50 ml of culture. To be able to use convenient unique restriction enzyme sites on full-length P69 cDNA, it was subcloned in pGEM4 without any tag. For this purpose, the pET28a-P69 construct was used as a template for PCR. Two primers, the forward primer (GGAGATATACCATGGGAAATGGGGAG) containing a NcoI site overlapping with protein start codon and a reverse primer downstream ofBamHI site (nucleotides 873–892) were used to PCR a ∼900-bp fragment. The PCR product was Klenow filled and cloned into the SmaI site of pBluescript KS+. The insert was then excised out from pBluescript KS+ with NcoI andBamHI and swapped with the corresponding fragment of the pET28a-P69 construct. The full-length cDNA insert from the above construct was excised out with XbaI and SalI and subcloned into the EcoRI-SalI site of pGEM4. The resulting construct, called pGM13, contained full-length P69 cDNA without any NH2-terminal tag, and could be transcribed from the SP6 promoter of pGEM4. The G2A and G2D mutants were made using the pGM13 construct as template for PCR with similar forward primers as before having a NcoI site and the mutation (G to A or D) and the same reverse primer downstream of BamHI site (nucleotides 873–892). The 900-bp PCR products were Klenow filled and cloned into the SmaI site of pBluescript KS+. The mutated inserts were then excised out from pBluescript KS+ with NcoI and BamHI, swapped with the corresponding fragment on wild type cDNA in PGM13. The insect cell expression of P69 was done using the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies) in a similar way as described earlier (10Bandyopadhyay S. Ghosh A. Sarkar S.N. Sen G.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3824-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 13Ghosh A. Sarkar S.N. Guo W. Bandyopadhyay S. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33220-33226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal hexahistidine-tagged P69 insert from pET28a was cloned into the XbaI andXhoI site of pFastBac. The recombinant baculovirus was produced according to Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus expression system instruction mannual. High Five (H5) cells (Invitrogen) were infected with the recombinant virus containing hexahistidine-tagged P69 at a multiplicity of infection of 10 and were harvested 32 h post-infection. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in lysis buffer (1 ml of buffer for cells from one 150-mm plate) containing 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and lysed by sonication of six 15-s pulses. Clarified cell lysate was prepared by centrifuging at 30,000 × g for 15 min and applied to Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen). For 1 ml of cell extract, a 0.2-ml bead suspension was used. Prior to loading with the cell extract, beads were washed twice in the binding buffer (300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 10 mmimidazole 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.3% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Cell extract was diluted 1:1 (v/v) with the binding buffer, the final imidazole concentration was adjusted to 10 mm and applied to the beads for binding at 4 °C with shaking on a rotary shaker. After 2 h, beads were centrifuged and washed for 15 min each: once with binding buffer, three times with washing buffer A (binding buffer, with the NaCl and imidazole concentrations at 450 and 25 mm, respectively), and once with washing buffer B (washing buffer A, with 30 mm imidazole). Protein was eluted from the beads with elution buffer (450 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 100 mm imidazole, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.03% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin; volume, 0.5 ml for 1 ml of original cell extract). The eluted protein was then dialyzed against 125 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol for 12 h at 4 °C. Final yield of the purified protein was about 5 μg/150-mm plate. Purified protein was stored at −80 °C in aliquots. Protein quantifications were done using the Bio-Rad's Protein assay reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. A typical assay reaction contained 1 μg/ml P69 protein, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 20 mm magnesium acetate, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm ATP, 5 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (specific activity 800 Ci/mmol), and 50 μg/ml poly(I):poly(C) in a 10-μl volume, and incubated for 4 h at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by heating for 5 min at 95 °C. The reaction products were treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (0.3 units/μl, for 3 h at 37 °C) and analyzed by thin layer chromatography (13Ghosh A. Sarkar S.N. Guo W. Bandyopadhyay S. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33220-33226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the reaction products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis on 20% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of 7m urea (14Miele M.B. Liu D.K. Kan N.C. J. Interferon Res. 1991; 11: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). One microliter from a 10-μl heat-inactivated reaction mixture was diluted in 4 μl of gel loading buffer (25% formamide, 0.5% bromphenol blue, 0.5% xylene cyanol), from which 2 μl of each sample was loaded on alternate lanes and electrophoresed for 4–5 h at 1600 V until the bromphenol blue of the loading dye ran halfway through the gel, which ensured the retention of unused ATP. At the end of the electrophoresis, the gel was transferred on a x-ray film support, covered with a Saran Wrap and directly exposed for 12 h to a storage phosphor screen. The amount of radioactivity in each spot was quantified using Imagequant software in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The amount of ATP polymerized by the enzyme for each reaction was determined by the following method. In every experiment, a blank sample without the enzyme was included in the incubation, which was processed in the same way as the experimental samples. After analyzing the products by gel electrophoresis, the total radioactivity in each lane was quantified and normalized with respect to the blank sample lane to normalize for loading variations. The PhosphorImager counts obtained in the blank sample lane was equivalent to 50 nmol of ATP, present in a 10 μl of reaction mixture. The nanomoles of ATP polymerized in each reaction was then determined by comparing the total counts from 2-5(A) products with the blank lane. In Fig. 6 data were plotted and fitted with appropriate equations using Prism software (Graph Pad Inc.) Purified P69 (200 ng each) was used to test the binding with lectins-wheat germ agglutinin and concanavalin A (ConA) according to Roquemore et al. (15Roquemore E.P. Chou T.Y. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 443-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μl of wheat germ agglutinin or ConA-Sepharose (Sigma), was washed twice in the binding buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Nonidet P40). Purified protein was incubated with the beads in 500 μl of volume at 4 °C with shaking for 2 h. At the end of the incubation, beads were centrifuged, washed twice in binding buffer, and twice in binding buffer containing 1 m galactose. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling beads in 1 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and analyzed on an SDS-PAGE. P69 protein was detected by Western blotting using anti-His antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To express unglycosylated P69, insect cells were treated with 10 μg/ml tunicamycin (16O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K.A. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar), 1 h post-infection. Cells were harvested 30 h post-infection, and P69 protein was purified from the treated cells along with an untreated control (Fig. 5 A). The purified proteins were tested for glycosylation by their ability to bind ConA-Sepharose, and tested for 2-5(A) synthetase activity. Purified proteins were size fractionated at room temperature on a 1 × 100-cm Sephacryl S300 column, which was equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 450 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-meraptoethanol, and 0.05% Triton X-100. 8 μg of either wild type or mutant protein was diluted in 400 μl of the above buffer and applied to the column and chromatographed at a flow rate of 7 ml/h. 500-μl fractions were collected and protein from 400 μl of each alternate fractions were concentrated by Ni-affinity chromatography, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and P69 bands were quantified for plotting as a chromatogram. Synthetic dsRNA of various lengths were made by transcribing the multicloning site of pBluescript KS+ as described earlier (17Desai S.Y. Sen G.C. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These synthetic dsRNA were used in a standard reaction mixture to assay the activation of P69 activity. The 2′-O-methylated dsRNA (36 bp) was obtained as two complementary pure single stranded RNA using commercial nucleic acid synthesis service from Operon Technologies. The single stranded 2′-O-methylated RNAs were hybridized to form the dsRNA (11Desai S.Y. Patel R.C. Sen G.C. Malhotra P. Ghadge G.D. Thimmapaya B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3454-3461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For the purpose of producing recombinant P69 protein, we cloned its full-length coding sequence by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using primers derived from the published sequence (8Marie I. Hovanessian A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9933-9939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The newly cloned cDNA was expressed in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system and thein vitro synthesized protein was enzymatically active (Fig.1 A). Since we have previously expressed active 9-2 isozyme in Escherichia coli, (11Desai S.Y. Patel R.C. Sen G.C. Malhotra P. Ghadge G.D. Thimmapaya B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3454-3461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), bacterial expression of P69 was first attempted. A hexahistidine-tagged protein was expressed in bacteria and it was purified by Ni-agarose affinity chromatography (Fig. 1 B). Surprisingly, the bacterially expressed P69 protein was enzymatically inactive although similarly expressed and purified 9-2 isozyme was active (Fig.1 C). Unlike 9-2, native P69 from interferon-treated human cells is a myristoylated protein (9Marie I. Svab J. Robert N. Galabru J. Hovanessian A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18601-18607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since myristoylation occurs in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, but not in E. coli (18Deichaite I. Casson L.P. Ling H.P. Resh M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4295-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 19Johnson D.R. Bhatnagar R.S. Knoll L.J. Gordon J.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 869-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), the lack of activity of bacterially expressed P69 could be due to the lack of this modification of the protein. To examine whether myristoylation is indeed needed for enzymatic activity, appropriate mutants of P69 were generated. Myristoylation of a protein is directed by the sequence present at its NH2 terminus (20Cross F.R. Garber E.A. Pellman D. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1834-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and mutation of the Gly residue at position 2 is known to destroy the proteins ability to be myristoylated (18Deichaite I. Casson L.P. Ling H.P. Resh M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4295-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 21Borgese N. Aggujaro D. Carrera P. Pietrini G. Bassetti M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1501-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Using site-directed mutagenesis, such mutants of P69, G2A, and G2D were generated and the corresponding proteins were synthesized in vitro. The mutant proteins were as active as the wild type protein (Fig.2 A) thus demonstrating that myristoylation is not required for enzyme activity. Another possible reason for a bacterially expressed protein to be inactive could be the presence of the extraneous hexahistidine tag at its NH2terminus. This possibility was also ruled out by the demonstration that (His)6P69 made in vitro was enzymatically active (Fig. 2 B). Although the reason for the observed inactivity of the bacterially expressed P69 was not revealed, the above series of experiments established that the presence of the polyhistidine tag at the NH2 terminus or the absence of myristoylation does not affect the protein's enzyme activity. Since bacterial expression of active recombinant P69 was ineffective, we decided to express it in insect cells using the baculovirus system. A recombinant baculovirus, encoding (His)6P69, was constructed for this purpose. Recombinant P69 protein was produced in the infected cells in quantities large enough to be easily detected by Coomassie Blue staining of proteins in total cell extracts (data not shown). The P69 protein was purified from the soluble supernatant of the cell extract using Ni-agarose affinity chromatography. This single step purification process was very efficient yielding an apparently homogeneous P69 preparation, as shown in Fig.3 A. A 290-fold purification of the activity was obtained by this method with about 30% yield (TableI).Table IPurification of recombinant P69FractionProteinSpecific activityaExpressed as nanomoles of ATP polymerized/μg of protein/h.PurificationYield-fold%Clarified cell lysate50 mg0.661100Affinity purified protein50 μg19029028.7a Expressed as nanomoles of ATP polymerized/μg of protein/h. Open table in a new tab Unlike the bacterially expressed P69, the recombinant P69 produced in insect cells was highly active (Fig. 3 B). A series of 2-5(A) oligomers is synthesized by 2-5(A) synthetases. Using denaturing gel electrophoresis for analyzing the products by size, we have previously observed that small 9-2 isozyme is capable of synthesizing dimers to hexamers of 2-5(A) (10Bandyopadhyay S. Ghosh A. Sarkar S.N. Sen G.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3824-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In contrast, the recombinant P69 protein was very efficient in synthesizing higher oligomers (Fig. 3 B). With increasing lengths of incubation time, more of the higher oligomers were synthesized. Up to 30-mers of 2-5(A) could be detected after 9 h of incubation. Native P69 is a dimer (9Marie I. Svab J. Robert N. Galabru J. Hovanessian A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18601-18607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same was true for the recombinant P69 purified from insect cells. Gel filtration analysis revealed that the purified recombinant P69 had an apparent molecular mass of 160 kDa (Fig.4 A). Since the calculated molecular mass of the polyhistidine-tagged P69 is 80.8 kDa, it showed that the protein exists primarily as a dimer. The protein sequence of P69 indicates the presence of four potentialN-glycosylation sites in the protein. That information, coupled with our failure to produce active protein in bacteria that lack protein glycosylation activity, prompted us to examine the glycosylation status of P69 expressed in insect cells. Because glycoproteins are known to bind to lectins, purified P69 was challenged to bind to two different lectins (Fig. 4 B). P69 bound to both wheat germ agglutinin and ConA-coupled Sepharose but not to the Sepharose matrix itself. These data strongly suggest that P69 has sugar modifications. To determine if glycosylation of the protein is needed for its enzyme activity, unglycosylated P69 was synthesized in tunicamycin-treated insect cells because tunicamycin is known to inhibit all sugar modifications of glycoproteins. P69 was purified from tunicamycin-treated and untreated cells (Fig.5 A) and, as expected, the protein purified from the drug-treated cells did not bind to ConA-Sepharose (Fig. 5) thus demonstrating its lack of glycosylation. The unglycosylated protein was enzymatically inactive (Fig.5 C) indicating that sugar modification of the P69 protein is required for producing an active enzyme. The enzymatic characteristics of the recombinant protein were determined in the next series of experiments. In these experiments, thin layer chromatography of phosphatase-treated products was used for measuring the total amounts of 2-5(A) production. Under the experimental conditions used, enzyme activity increased linearly with increasing protein concentration and length of incubation (Fig.6, A and B). The protein was enzymatically active even after 30 h of incubation (data not shown). A substrate concentration curve revealed that theK m for ATP of this enzyme was 2.1 mm(Fig. 6 C). A similar experiment with increasing concentrations of the cofactor, dsRNA, demonstrated that the purified protein was totally inactive without dsRNA and for the maximum enzyme activation, 5–10 μg/ml of poly(I):poly(C) was required (Fig.6 D). The various characteristics of the recombinant P69 protein are listed in Table II.Table IIEnzymatic properties of purified P69PropertyValuesATPK M2.1 mmdsRNA optimum10 μg/mlSpecific activity190 nmol/h/μgk cat7 s−1Product profilepppA(2′p5′A)1–30 Open table in a new tab For other isozymes it has been suggested that 2-5(A) oligomerization is non-processive (22Justesen J. Ferbus D. Thang M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4618-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The kinetics of synthesis of different oligomers by P69 (Fig. 3 B) indicated that the same was also true for this isozyme. To directly examine the processivity of P69, the experiment shown in Fig. 6 was carried out. No 2-5(A) oligomers remained bound to the protein (lane 2, Fig.7) and the profiles of the products made by fresh enzyme (lane 1, Fig. 7) and preincubated enzyme (lane 4, Fig. 7) were identical. The nature of the dsRNA required for P69 activation was investigated in the next series of experiments. Perfect dsRNA of defined lengths were synthesized byin vitro transcription and their ability to activate P69 was tested. When tested at a high concentration (20 μg/ml), a 25-bp dsRNA was as active as longer dsRNAs (Fig.8 A), whereas a 15-bp dsRNA was less efficient in activating the enzyme. Moreover, higher oligomers of 2-5(A) were more efficiently synthesized in the presence of the 25-bp or longer dsRNA as compared with the 15-bp dsRNA (Fig. 8, A and B). Quantitation of total 2-5(A) synthesis in the presence of different concentrations of various dsRNAs revealed that 25-bp dsRNA was as good as the longer RNAs at every concentration tested (Fig. 8 C). Their product profiles at each concentrations were also very similar (data not shown). But for 15-bp dsRNA, the maximum level of synthesis was about 25% of that achieved by others (Fig. 8 C) and synthesis of the higher oligomers was very inefficient (Fig. 8 B). Curiously, for all RNAs, the product profile changed with the activator concentration,i.e. the formation of the higher oligomers was favored at higher concentrations of the dsRNA (Fig. 8 B). Moreover, a low concentration of the 25-bp RNA (0.1 μg/ml) produced the same product profile as a high concentration (10 μg/ml) of the 15-bp RNA (Fig. 8 B). A different property of the dsRNA was tested in Fig. 8 D. Another dsRNA-activated enzyme, PKR, cannot be activated by 2′-O-methylated dsRNA (23Bevilacqua P.C. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9983-9994Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To examine if this property is shared by P69, a 36-bp 2′-O-methylated dsRNA was synthesized. Even at 50 μg/ml, this RNA could not activate the P69 protein (Fig. 8 D). Thus, it appears that free 2′-OH groups on the ribose moieties of the dsRNA are required for proper interactions with the P69 isozyme of 2-5(A) synthetases. The 2-5(A) synthetases are interesting enzymes primarily because of their two unique properties: they are activated by dsRNA and they, unlike any other DNA or RNA polymerases, catalyze the formation of 2′-5′ phosphodiester bonds. Pursuit of mechanistic and structural investigation of these enzymes has been hampered by the lack of an ample source of pure proteins. Although synthesis of 2-5(A) synthetases can be induced in mammalian cells by interferon treatment, many isozymes are induced together and the cells do not tolerate their sustained expression at high levels. For these reasons, we sought to express recombinant enzymes in unnatural expression systems, such as bacteria or insect cells, that are not susceptible to the anticellular effects of 2-5(A) synthetases because they lack the complementary enzyme, RNase L. Expression of recombinant proteins also allows one to express various mutant proteins, an ability that is crucial for conducting structure-function studies. Thus, we attempted to develop a high level expression system of an epitope-tagged protein that can be purified easily. We chose the medium isozyme P69 over the small isozymes for several reasons. Like poly(A) polymerase, medium, but not the small 2-5(A) synthetase, polymerize long chains of 2-5(A). Moreover, the medium synthetases are dimers and thus easier to study structurally than small synthetases that are tetramers. An additional feature was the ease with which the recombinant P69 could be purified. We have previously expressed a small isozyme, 9-2, in both bacteria and insect cells (11Desai S.Y. Patel R.C. Sen G.C. Malhotra P. Ghadge G.D. Thimmapaya B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3454-3461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 13Ghosh A. Sarkar S.N. Guo W. Bandyopadhyay S. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33220-33226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Both systems produced enzymatically active 9-2 proteins although the bacterially expressed protein had a lower specific activity (10Bandyopadhyay S. Ghosh A. Sarkar S.N. Sen G.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3824-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As reported here, P69, a medium isozyme was also expressed efficiently in both of these expression systems. But surprisingly, the bacterially expressed P69 was enzymatically inactive. We suspected that this was because of the lack of some crucial post-translational modification of the protein expressed in E. coli. Because the natural protein is known to be myristoylated, a modification missing in bacteria, we investigated whether this modification was required for enzyme activity. An appropriate mutational study demonstrated that this was not the cause. Similarly, phosphorylation of P69 does not appear to be the difference either. Even in the insect cells, we failed to detect radiolabeled phosphate incorporation in the protein by in vivo phosphate labeling of cells and then purifying the P69 protein by immunoprecipitation. However, under the same conditions similarly expressed recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus P protein was highly radiolabeled (data not shown). The third possible protein modification that we tested was glycosylation because P69 contains several potentialN-glycosylation sites. Our data clearly demonstrated that P69 synthesized in insect cells was glycosylated and glycosylation was necessary for enzyme activity of the protein. Further studies will be needed to determine if the lack of sugar modification affects proper folding of the protein (24Ruddon R.W. Bedows E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) or its substrate and cofactor binding (25Xie R.-L. Long G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23212-23217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, these results provide a probable explanation for the inactivity of P69 expressed in bacteria which lack the ability to glycosylate proteins. The baculovirus-infected insect cell system produced a high yield of the recombinant P69 protein. It was also easy to purify using the hexahistidine tag at its NH2 terminus. The tagged P69 protein bound to the affinity matrix quite efficiently indicating that the amino-terminal region of P69 is not buried inside. This was unlike the polyhistidine-tagged 9-2 isozyme that did not bind to the same affinity resin efficiently (10Bandyopadhyay S. Ghosh A. Sarkar S.N. Sen G.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3824-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The purified recombinant P69 protein had a high specific activity and its K m for ATP and the dsRNA optimum were similar to those of the natural enzyme (26Hovanessian A.G. Svab J. Marie I. Robert N. Chamaret S. Laurent A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4945-4949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic properties of the recombinant P69 and 9-2 isozymes were very similar. Both had highK m for ATP, the specific activities were similar and the k cat values were similar. The dsRNA optimum for P69, 10 μg/ml, was however, lower than the optimum for 9-2, 25 μg/ml. Both proteins were also extremely stable: their enzymatic activity was maintained even after 20 h of incubation at 30 °C. There was, however, a major difference in one property of the two isozymes: the P69 isozyme synthesized much longer 2-5(A) chains than the 9-2 isozyme, which synthesized mostly dimers and trimers. Although, for 9-2, long incubations produced some higher oligomers, but nothing longer than hexamers could be detected as its product activity (10Bandyopadhyay S. Ghosh A. Sarkar S.N. Sen G.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3824-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In contrast, up to 30-mer of 2-5(A) was synthesized by the P69 isozyme. The mechanistic basis of this observed difference in the properties of the two isozymes is unclear at this time. The possible basis of the ability of P69 to synthesize higher 2-5(A) oligomers could be that the enzyme was highly processive. Our experimental results, however, point to the contrary. No oligomer remained bound to the protein after their synthesis, suggesting that chain lengthening proceeds through multiple initiation events. The presence of all intermediates, from dimers to the highest oligomer, in the products produced during a given length of incubation, and the observed uniform gradient in the amounts of longer to shorter oligomers, also indicate that the reaction is non-processive. Our observation is in contrast to the recent report of Marie et al. (27Marie I. Blanco J. Rebouillat D. Hovanessian A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 558-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) suggesting that the natural P69 may be a processive enzyme. Their conclusion was based on the negative observation that isolated dimers were poor acceptors for chain elongation. This observation is explainable by our finding that ATP is a much better acceptor than dimers or higher oligomers of 2-5(A). As a result, high concentrations of ATP favors dimer formation and inhibit the formation of higher oligomers (data not shown). In contrast, our conclusion that the enzyme reaction is non-processive is in tune with the earlier observation by Justesen et al. (22Justesen J. Ferbus D. Thang M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4618-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) that the enzyme purified from the reticulocyte lysate could efficiently use dimers and trimers of 2-5(A) as acceptors. We used the recombinant purified P69 protein for studying the nature of its activator. The protein was inactive as such and single-stranded RNA, DNA-RNA hybrid, or dsDNA could not activate it (data not shown). Double-stranded RNAs were the only activators and there were no specific sequence requirements for this activity. We have previously shown that the small isozyme can be activated by dsRNAs as short as 40 bp and by HIV-1 TAR RNA (28Maitra R.K. McMillan N.A. Desai S. McSwiggen J. Hovanessian A.G. Sen G. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Virology. 1994; 204: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and adenoviral VAI RNA (11Desai S.Y. Patel R.C. Sen G.C. Malhotra P. Ghadge G.D. Thimmapaya B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3454-3461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) which are not perfect dsRNAs. Results presented here show that the P69 isozyme can be activated maximally even by a 25-bp dsRNA. Moreover, unlike 9-2, P69 was activated equally well by shorter or longer dsRNAs even at subsaturating concentrations. However, the shortest dsRNA tested, 15-bp dsRNA, behaved differently. It was a poor activator even at high concentrations. It suggests that more than one complete helical turn of the dsRNA may be necessary for optimum P69 recognition and its activation. This observation is reminiscent of the length requirement of dsRNA for activation of PKR, another class of dsRNA-activated enzyme (29Manche L. Green S.R. Schmedt C. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Similarly, like PKR (23Bevilacqua P.C. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9983-9994Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), the lack of activation of P69 by 2′-O-methylated dsRNA indicates that free 2′-OH groups on the RNA are necessary for its interaction, a conclusion supported by its lack of activation by dsDNA or DNA-RNA hybrids. These observations revealed remarkable mechanistic similarities between the two classes of dsRNA-activated enzymes, 2-5(A) synthetase and PKR. Such similarities were somewhat unexpected in view of the known differences of their relevant properties: the dsRNA binding motifs of PKR are not present in P69; PKR, but not P69, is inhibited at high concentrations of dsRNA and dsRNA-binding of PKR is much stronger as revealed by the lack of dissociation of the PKR·dsRNA complex even at 0.5 m NaCl (30Patel R.C. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7671-7676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As discussed above, it is not apparent why P69, but not 9-2, can synthesize longer 2-5(A) oligomers. Since our data indicates that 2-5(A) chain elongation is a non-processive reaction, binding of shorter 2-5(A) molecules, as acceptors of the next AMP, may be more efficient for P69 than 9-2. In this respect, it is interesting to note that higher 2-5(A) oligomer formation by P69 was also impaired at low dsRNA concentrations or when the activator was the short 15-bp dsRNA (Fig. 7, A and B). Thus, it appears that optimal interaction of dsRNA with the P69 protein not only dictates its ability to catalyze the 2′-5′-phosphodiester bond formation but also influences its choice of acceptor molecules such as ATP or 2-5(A) oligomers."

In response to agonist stimulation, GPCRs are regulated by phosphorylation, sequestration, and down-regulation, which limit the strength or duration of physiological responses (1Kobilka B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1992; 15: 87-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 2Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Whereas down-regulation persistently attenuates signaling by targeting GPCRs for lysosomal degradation, sequestration apparently serves to reactivate desensitized receptors by allowing them to be dephosphorylated and recycled in active form to the cell surface (3Pippig S. Andexinger S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar,4Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Recent studies have begun to elucidate the mechanisms governing the sequestration and down-regulation of GPCRs (2Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). For example, β-arrestin acts as an adaptor that binds GPCRs and clathrin (5Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L.

In contrast, the molecular mechanisms governing the transport of GPCRs along subsequent steps of the endocytic pathways responsible for sequestration or down-regulation are less well understood. GPCRs activated by peptide mating pheromones in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae have provided insights into the molecular mechanisms of receptor down-regulation (7Riezman H. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Agonist binding triggers phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination of yeast α-factor receptors on their cytoplasmic C-terminal domains (8Reneke J.E. Blumer K.J. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J.

Ubiquitinated receptors are internalized by processes that involve clathrin, actin, myosin, and fimbrin (10Riezman H. Munn A. Geli M.I. Hicke L. Experientia (Basel). 1996; 52: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and subsequently transported through vesicular intermediates similar to early and late endosomes in mammalian cells (11Hicke L.

Cell. 1998; 9: 173-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In late endosomal/prevacuolar compartments, pheromone receptor trafficking is thought to converge with biosynthetic pathways that deliver precursors of resident vacuolar proteins (13Davis N.G.

For example, a small GTP-binding protein (Ypt5/Vps21) and an NSF homolog (Sec18), regulate fusion or maturation of early endosomes (11Hicke L. Zanolari B. Pypaert M. Rohrer J. Riezman H. Mol. Biol.

Here we have used yeast cells expressing green fluorescent protein fused to the α-factor receptor (Ste2-GFP) as a new tool to localize receptors in compartments of the endocytic pathway and to identify gene products involved in receptor down-regulation. We describe evidence that a syntaxin homolog encoded by the VAM3 gene is required for delivery of Ste2 to the vacuole, a late step in the down-regulation pathway. Enzymes used for recombinant DNA methods were purchased from commercial sources and used according to the suppliers' recommendations.

The unmarked ste2Δ allele of KBY58 was introduced by two-step gene deletion using JE115 and ClaI-cut YIp5ste2Δ (19Stefan C.J. Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 885-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and confirmed by loss of LEU2. The VAM3 coding region was deleted usingApaI/SacI-cut pvam3::LEU2 (20Darsow T. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), to create KBY65. To localize α-factor receptors in living cells, we constructed plasmid pRS314STE2-GFP, which expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to wild type receptors at their extreme C termini. Polymerase chain reaction was used to generate GFP(S65T) coding sequences flanked by BamHI restriction sites. This polymerase chain reaction product was digested with BamHI and cloned into pGEX2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been cut with BamHI to create pGEX2T-GFP. Plasmid pRS314STE2-GFP was created by inserting a BamHI fragment containing the GFP (S65T) coding region in the appropriate reading frame from pGEX2T-GFP into the BglII site of pRS314STE2Δter in which the wild type termination codon was inactivated (19Stefan C.J. Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 885-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To fuse GFP to α-factor receptors lacking their C-terminal cytoplasmic tails, we inserted the BamHI fragment containing the GFP(S65T) coding region in the appropriate reading frame from pGEX2T-GFP into the BglII site of pRS314ste2-300ter (19Stefan C.J. Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 885-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), to create plasmid pRS314ste2Δtail-GFP. To express VAM3, plasmid pRS313VAM3 was constructed by isolating a 1.8-kilobase pairXmnI-ApaI fragment encompassing theVAM3 locus from pVAM3.416 (20Darsow T. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and inserting it into pRS313 that had been cleaved with SmaI andApaI. The vam3–6 temperature-sensitive allele was expressed from pvam3–6.416 (20Darsow T. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Transposon insertion mutagenesis and a visual screen were performed to identify cells that displayed aberrant localization of Ste2-GFP. Two pools of a transposon-mutagenized yeast genomic DNA library (21Chun K.T. Goebl M.G. Genetics. 1996; 142: 39-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cleaved withNotI were transformed into JE115 cells carrying theSTE2-GFP fusion on a centromeric plasmid. Approximately 6,000 transformants were treated individually with pheromone (1 μm α-factor, 3 h) and screened using fluorescence microscopy for abnormal distribution of Ste2-GFP. To identify genes affected in the mutants isolated from the visual screen, chromosomal DNA was prepared, digested with EcoRI,HindIII, or BamHI, which cleaves once in the transposable element and cleaves in the adjacent chromosomal DNA (21Chun K.T. Goebl M.G. Genetics. 1996; 142: 39-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fragments containing the bla gene from the transposable element and flanking yeast genomic DNA were cloned into pCRScriptCAM SK(+) (Stratagene) cleaved with EcoRI, HindIII, or BamHI. These plasmids were introduced intoEscherichia coli by selecting for resistance to ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Plasmid DNA was prepared and sequenced using a primer that anneals to the Tn3 38 base pair repeat at the left end of the transposon; this identified the chromosomal locus disrupted by the transposable element. Quantitative bioassays (halo assays) were used to measure the apparent sensitivity of cells to pheromone-induced growth arrest (22Sprague G.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The relative responsiveness of cells was determined by comparing the amount of α-factor required to form a halo 20 mm in diameter, as indicated by interpolating dose-response curves. Quantitative mating assays were performed as described (22Sprague G.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Methods used to purify [35S]α-factor and perform ligand binding assays with inviable, intact cells have been described (19Stefan C.J. Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 885-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Assays of cells expressing wild type or GFP-tagged receptors employed [35S]α-factor (30 Ci/mmol) at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 nm. Ligand binding data were plotted according to the method of Scatchard and fitted by nonlinear least mean square regression. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 500-fold excess of unlabeled α-factor. Endocytosis of the α-factor receptor was determined by measuring the rates that cells internalize bound 35S-labeled α-factor, as described previously (23Dulic V. Egerton M. Elguindi I. Raths S. Singer B. Riezman H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Rates of degradation of internalized35S-labeled α-factor by wild type cells orvam3 mutants were determined as described previously (11Hicke L. Zanolari B. Pypaert M. Rohrer J. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar,23Dulic V. Egerton M. Elguindi I. Raths S. Singer B. Riezman H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Cells were grown at 26 °C or 30 °C to a density of 107 cells/ml, washed, and suspended in YPB (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.0, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone). 35S-Labeled α-factor (1 μCi, 100 nm final concentration) was bound to cells for 1 h under conditions that inhibit ligand-induced internalization of receptors (YPB at 0 °C). Unbound ligand was removed by pelleting cells, and cells were suspended in YPD medium, pH 6.0, at 26 °C, or 38 °C if vam3 temperature-sensitive mutants were analyzed. Receptor internalization was allowed to proceed. Aliquots (100 μl) were removed at various times and diluted into 10 ml 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 1.1, containing 10 mm KF on ice to remove surface-bound α-factor. Cells were filtered, washed with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 10 mm NaN3 and 10 mm KF, and suspended in extraction buffer (23Dulic V. Egerton M. Elguindi I. Raths S. Singer B. Riezman H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Internalized 35S-labeled α-factor extracted from cells was subjected to thin layer chromatography to resolve intact and degraded α-factor species, as described previously (23Dulic V. Egerton M. Elguindi I. Raths S. Singer B. Riezman H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Cultures were grown to a density of 2 × 107 cells/ml in synthetic medium (SD-uracil) to select for plasmids pVAM3.416 and pvam3–6.416. Immunoblotting methods used to detect carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) in yeast whole-cell extracts were similar to those previously described (24Srivastava A. Jones E.W. Genetics. 1998; 148: 85-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were lysed by mechanical disruption in Laemmli sample buffer, and the protein concentration of the cleared lysates was determined by the Bradford method and adjusted to 1 mg/ml with Laemmli sample buffer prior to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Yeast cell cultures were labeled with CMAC at a concentration of 100 μm for 15 min in synthetic medium at room temperature to examine vacuole morphology. To visualize α-factor receptors, cultures were grown to a density of 2 × 107 cells/ml in synthetic medium (SD-tryptophan) to select for plasmids that express GFP-tagged receptors. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in low fluorescence medium (25Waddle J.A. Karpova T.S. Waterston R.H. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and observed under an Olympus epifluorescence microscope equipped with UG-1, BP490, and BP545 dichroic filters and a cooled CCD camera (Dage). To detect changes in the distribution of receptors upon treating cells with pheromone, we mixed MAT a cells (JE115) expressing GFP-tagged receptors (from pRS314STE2-GFP) with a 4-fold excess of MATα cells (RK537–3B) to provide a source of α-factor. The cell suspension (2 μl) was placed on an agarose pad containing medium as described previously (25Waddle J.A. Karpova T.S. Waterston R.H. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Cells were imaged at room temperature on an Olympus epifluorescence microscope equipped with stage and shutter controllers. Time lapse fluorescence images were collected by acquisition of 10 focal planes (0.5 μm apart), and collapsed into a single two-dimensional image as described previously (25Waddle J.A. Karpova T.S. Waterston R.H. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To characterize the endocytic trafficking of yeast α-factor receptors and to identify mutants defective in this process, we needed a rapid and reliable means of examining receptor localization. Accordingly, we constructed a centromeric plasmid that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP, S65T) fused to the extreme C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the α-factor receptor, Ste2-GFP (Fig.1). We also constructed a similar plasmid that expresses GFP fused to a truncated α-factor receptor lacking its cytoplasmic C-terminal tail, Ste2Δtail-GFP, which should not be internalized from the cell surface (8Reneke J.E. Blumer K.J. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Cell. 1988; 55: 221-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 26Konopka J.B. Jenness D.D. Hartwell L.H. Cell. 1988; 54: 609-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These two forms of Ste2-GFP were expressed from the STE2 promoter in a ste2null mutant and characterized with regard to signaling activity, agonist binding affinity, cell surface expression, and internalization kinetics. Tagging full-length α-factor receptors with GFP did not appear to affect receptor signaling, agonist binding affinity, cell surface expression, or internalization. Tagged and untagged receptors displayed similar agonist binding affinities (K d = 4.9 and 5.3 nm for Ste2-GFP and Ste2, respectively; Fig. 1 A) and cell surface expression levels (B max = 15,000 and 19,000 sites/cell respectively, Fig. 1 A). Cells expressing Ste2-GFP responded to pheromone with nearly normal efficiency (Fig. 1 B) and mated as efficiently as cells expressing untagged receptors (data not shown). Furthermore, cells expressing Ste2-GFP internalized receptors at a rate indistinguishable from that of cells expressing full-length untagged receptors, as indicated by measuring rates of 35S-labeled α-factor uptake (Fig. 1 C). Cells expressing receptors lacking their cytoplasmic C-terminal domains (Ste2Δtail-GFP) were defective in this assay (Fig. 1 C) and conferred a pheromone supersensitive phenotype identical to untagged truncated receptors (data not shown), as expected (8Reneke J.E. Blumer K.J. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Cell. 1988; 55: 221-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 26Konopka J.B. Jenness D.D. Hartwell L.H. Cell. 1988; 54: 609-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We subsequently examined the localization of full-length Ste2-GFP in the absence or presence of mating pheromone. Consistent with our previous immunofluorescence studies using fixed cells expressing myc-tagged receptors (19Stefan C.J. Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 885-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), Ste2-GFP was present at the cell surface (Fig.2 A), particularly in daughter cells, probably due to polarization of the secretory pathway. Ste2-GFP was also detected at the tips of cell surface projections induced 2 h after exposing cell cultures to pheromone (data not shown), similar to what has been reported using untagged receptors (27Jackson C.L. Konopka J.B. Hartwell L.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 389-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Ste2-GFP also localized to two morphologically distinct types of intracellular vesicular structures. Smaller vesicles (usually >5/cell; Fig. 2 A, single arrowhead) were present throughout the cytoplasm. The second type of vesicular structures were larger (Fig.2 A, double arrow), less numerous (typically 2–5/cell), and nearly always located next to the vacuole, which was stained with the vital dye CMAC (28Stewart A. Deacon J.W. Biotech. Histochem. 1995; 70: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Two approaches were used to determine whether the intracellular vesicles observed in cells expressing Ste2-GFP were secretory or endocytic. First, we examined the localization of Ste2Δtail-GFP, which fails to undergo endocytosis. Ste2Δtail-GFP was present at the cell surface, but it did not localize to intracellular vesicular structures (Fig. 2 A). A small proportion of Ste2Δtail-GFP also localized to a perinuclear ring similar to the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that this fusion protein has a slight biosynthetic defect. This ring structure was not the vacuole membrane because it did not stain with CMAC. Second, because receptor internalization is stimulated by pheromone, we determined whether the number of intracellular vesicles increases when cells are exposed to the pheromone secreted by a neighboring cell of opposite mating type. For these experiments, MAT acells expressing Ste2-GFP and MATα cells that do not express a GFP-tagged protein were mixed and mounted on a medium-containing agarose pad. Time-lapse fluorescence video microscopy was used to follow the distribution of Ste2-GFP in single cells over time. Consistent with an endocytic origin, the number of vesicles containing Ste2-GFP increased 2–4-fold as cells responded over time to the pheromone produced by neighboring cells of opposite mating type (Fig. 2 B). Increases in vesicle number were detected 20 min after cells were first exposed to pheromone, before receptor expression is induced. Results of these two experiments, and previous immunofluorescence studies of pheromone receptors (11Hicke L. Zanolari B. Pypaert M. Rohrer J. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 14Piper R.C. Cooper A.A. Yang H. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 603-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 15Rieder S.E. Banta L.M. Kohrer K. McCaffery J.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 985-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), indicate that small vesicles containing Ste2-GFP are probably early endosomes, and the larger vesicles are late endosome/prevacuolar compartments. Although Ste2-GFP was expected to be associated with the plasma membrane, cell surface projections, and endocytic compartments, it was surprising that Ste2-GFP-derived fluorescence was also present in the lumen of the vacuole (Fig. 2 A, top row). GFP accumulated in the vacuole of most cells, although the level differed significantly from cell to cell (also see Fig. 3, top row), possibly reflecting different extents of basal internalization of Ste2-GFP, rates of GFP degradation, or plasmid copy number. Localization to the vacuole lumen was confirmed by co-staining with CMAC. Accumulation of Ste2-GFP or its degradation products in the vacuole lumen was unexpected because the GFP domain was fused to the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor, which should remain cytoplasmically disposed if endocytic trafficking to the vacuole exclusively involves fusion events between unilamellar donor and acceptor membranes. The potential significance of this observation with respect to the mechanisms of endocytic transport is presented under “Discussion.” To identify gene products that participate in endocytic trafficking of α-factor receptors, we used a visual screen to isolate mutants in which the intracellular distribution of Ste2-GFP was abnormal. Transposon insertion mutagenesis was used because insertion sites are easily determined with the aid of the completed yeast genome sequence. However, this method is likely to reveal only a subset of the genes involved in endocytic trafficking because transposon insertions occur at nonrandom sites, insertions into essential genes cannot be recovered, and subtle but significant differences in receptor localization could be overlooked in a visual screen. Mutants were identified in the following way. Pools of a transposon-mutagenized yeast DNA library were transformed into aste2 null mutant (JE115) expressing Ste2-GFP from a centromeric plasmid; this eliminates the possibility that localization of Ste2-GFP could be affected by the presence of untagged receptors expressed from the chromosome. Transformants were screened individually in the absence and presence of pheromone for alterations in receptor distribution. Two transformants displayed a similar aberrant pattern of Ste2-GFP localization, either in the absence or presence of pheromone (data not shown). In contrast to wild type cells, these mutants displayed intense fluorescence in numerous punctate intracellular patches or vesicles (Fig. 3, second and fourth rows). Furthermore, both mutants possessed fragmented vacuoles (as revealed by CMAC staining). In contrast, when these mutants expressed endocytosis-defective receptors, Ste2Δtail-GFP, they lacked fluorescence in intracellular vesicles (data not shown), suggesting that the localization of full-length Ste2-GFP within these vesicles requires receptor endocytosis. Thus, the mutants displayed defects in vacuolar morphology and/or targeting of endocytic vesicles containing Ste2-GFP to vacuoles. Analysis of transposon insertion sites revealed that both mutants carried disruptions of the VAM3/PTH1 gene, which encodes a protein of 283 amino acids with similarity to yeast and mammalian syntaxins or t-SNAREs (20Darsow T. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 24Srivastava A. Jones E.W. Genetics. 1998; 148: 85-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nichols B.J.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1299-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In one mutant (Fig. 3,second row) the insertion occurred at codon 112, near sequences encoding the second predicted coiled-coil domain of Vam3; this was termed the vam3–100 allele. In the second mutant (Fig. 3, fourth row) the insertion occurred at codon 268, within sequences encoding the transmembrane domain of Vam3; this was termed the vam3–101 allele. These mutations appeared to cause the mutant phenotypes because introduction of the wild type VAM3 gene on a centromeric plasmid corrected the defects in Ste2-GFP localization and vacuolar morphology (Fig. 3, third and fifth rows). Interestingly, however, the wild type VAM3 plasmid only partially corrected the phenotype of the vam3–101 mutant, because some cells in the population exhibited a wild type distribution of Ste2-GFP and intact vacuoles whereas others had a mutant phenotype (Fig. 3,fifth row). Thus, a mutation truncating Vam3 near its transmembrane domain may be partially dominant-negative. Similar truncations of other SNARE proteins are dominant-negative (31Burd C.G. Peterson M. Cowles C.R. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1089-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 32Rossi G. Salminen A. Rice L.M. Brunger A.T. Brennwald P. J. Biol.

Several observations suggested that thevam3–100 and vam3–101 mutations preserve receptor expression, signaling and internalization. First, wild type cells and vam3–100 mutants expressed receptors having similar agonist binding affinities (4.9 and 6.2 nm, respectively) and cell surface expression levels (B max = 14,000 and 15,000 sites/cell, respectively) (Fig. 1 A). Second, vam3–100 andvam3–101 mutants expressing Ste2-GFP responded to pheromone with efficiencies similar to wild type cells expressing Ste2-GFP (Fig.1 B) and mated with normal efficiency (data not"

The steady-state level of nucleophosmin/B23 mRNA and the total cellular nucleophosmin/B23 protein decreased during the BuONa/vanadate-induced apoptosis. Stabilization and promotor transcriptional activity assays indicate that the decrease in nucleophosmin/B23 mRNA in BuONa/vanadate-treated HL-60 cells was transcriptionally regulated. A decline in telomerase activity was observed in HL-60 cells treated with BuONa/vanadate for 24–96 h. There was virtually no decline of nucleophosmin/B23 mRNA nor the telomerase activities during the growth arrest by serum-starvation. The decrease in nucleophosmin/B23 mRNA expression and telomerase activity in HL-60 cells subsequent to BuONa/vanadate treatment can thus be attributed to cellular apoptosis rather than the growth arrest induced by BuONa/vanadate. Nucleophosmin/B23 antisense oligomer treatment significantly potentiated BuONa-induced apoptosis and inhibition of telomerase activity. Results of this study suggest that nucleophosmin/B23 is one of the key elements in the down-regulation of nucleolar function for cellular apoptosis and mortalization."
https://openalex.org/W2027202409,"Our recent linkage study of urethane-induced pulmonary adenomas in SMXA RI strains of mouse revealed two host resistance genes, Par1 (chromosome 11) and Par3 (chromosome 12). The map positions of Par1 and Par3 correspond to human 17q11-23 and 14q11-24, based on synteny between mouse and human. In this study, we examined the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in these two homologous human chromosomal regions in 30 primary lung adenocarcinoma samples with matched normal DNA. Using 15 highly polymorphic markers, two commonly deleted regions were identified on human chromosomes 14 and 17, respectively. At 17q21, nine (53%) of 17 informative tumors showed LOH between D17S588 and D17S518. On the other hand, at 14q11-12, seven (32%) of 22 informative tumors showed LOH at loci between D14S261 and D14S80. Subsequently, we examined 25 squamous cell carcinomas (SQ) and 24 small cell carcinomas (SCC). At 14q11-12, six (38%) of 16 informative SQ and five (42%) of 12 informative SCC showed LOH. In contrast, at 17q11-23, one (7%) of 15 informative SQ and two (14%) of 14 SCC showed LOH. Therefore, the gene on 17q seemed to affect selectively adenocarcinomas, whereas the other gene on 14q, all three types of lung carcinomas. These observations indicate that a comparative genetic analysis provides a promising approach to survey genes involved in multifactorial process of human lung carcinogenesis."

The nuclear response of cAMP is mediated by transcription factors like the cAMP-Responsive Element Modulator (CREM) gene. One of the products of the CREM gene, the transcriptional repressor Inducible cAMP Early Repressor-IIgamma (ICER-IIgamma), is induced by cAMP. ICER-IIgamma blocks cells at the G2/M boundary of the cell cycle. Here we show that ICER-IIgamma dramatically inhibits the growth and DNA synthesis of mouse pituitary tumor cells and human choriocarcinoma cells. This alteration in cell growth is coupled with reduced ability of these cells to grow in an anchorage-independent manner and to form tumors in mice. These data demonstrate that ICER-IIgamma is a tumor suppressor gene product mediating the antiproliferative activity of cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W2006242448,"In this study, we explored how sterol metabolism altered by the expression of cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (7α-hydroxylase) affects the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation of translocation-arrested apoB53 in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Stable expression of two different plasmids that encode either rat or human 7α-hydroxylase inhibited the ubiquitin conjugation of apoB and its subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Oxysterols (25-hydroxycholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol) reversed the inhibition of apoB degradation caused by 7α-hydroxylase. The combined results suggest that the normally rapid proteasome degradation of translocation-arrested apoB can be regulated by a sterol-sensitive polyubiquitin conjugation step in the endoplasmic reticulum. Blocked ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation caused translocation-arrested apoB to become sequestered in segregated membrane domains. Our results described for the first time a novel mechanism through which the “quality control” proteasome endoplasmic reticulum degradative pathway of translocation-arrested apoB is linked to sterol metabolism. Sterol-sensitive blocked ubiquitin conjugation appears to selectively inhibit the proteasome degradation of apoB, but not 7α-hydroxylase protein, with no impairment of cell vitality or function. Our findings may help to explain why the hepatic production of lipoproteins is increased when familial hypertriglyceridemic patients are treated with drugs that activate 7α-hydroxylase (e.g. bile acid-binding resins).

ApoB is the major structural protein responsible for the assembly of lipoproteins by the liver and intestine. Multiple forms of apoB, designated as the percentage of the N terminus of the largest secretory product apoB100 (4536 amino acids), are produced from a single gene transcript by mRNA editing and proteolytic cleavage (reviewed in Refs. 1Davis R.A.

Albers J.J. Brunzell J.D. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 10: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In these patients, the secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins varies in parallel with the rate of bile acid synthesis (6Angelin B. Einarsson K. Hellstrom K. Leijd B. J.

These findings suggest that the secretion of very low density lipoprotein triglyceride is linked to hepatic sterol metabolism via an as yet undefined mechanism that is dependent upon genes that contribute to hypertriglyceridemia. The rate of hepatic secretion of apoB is regulated post-transcriptionally. Only a portion of de novosynthesized apoB is secreted; the remaining portion is degraded intracellularly (9Borchardt R.A.

Nature. 1993; 365: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Similar to the CHO cells used in the studies reported here, the liver of abetalipoproteinemics lacks the ability to fully translocate apoB into the ER (24Du E.Z. Wang S.-L. Kayden H.J. Sokol R. Curtiss L.K. Davis R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1309-1315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to secrete apoB-containing lipoproteins (25Gregg R.E. Wetterau J.R. Curr. Opin.

Recent studies in mice having one MTP allele inactivated show significant reductions in MTP-lipid transfer activity and the ability to secrete apoB-containing lipoproteins by the liver (27Raabe M. Flynn L.M. Zlot C.H. Wong J.S. Veniant M.M. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8686-8691Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that MTP expression may contribute to the rate-limiting step in the lipoprotein assembly/secretion pathway. Cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (7α-hydroxylase) is a liver-specific gene product that controls bile acid synthesis, the major pathway responsible for eliminating cholesterol from the body (reviewed in Ref. 28Edwards P.A. Davis R.A. New Compr. Biochem. 1996; 31: 341-362Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The level of expression of 7α-hydroxylase, which is highly variable in response to diet, metabolic state, and diurnal cycle, has a marked influence on the assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins by cultured rat hepatoma cells (29Wang S.-L. Du E.Z. Martin T.D. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19351-19358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Oxysterols, which are hydroxylated sterol derivatives, antagonize 7α-hydroxylase-induced changes in the assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins (29Wang S.-L. Du E.Z. Martin T.D. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19351-19358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined how expression of 7α-hydroxylase affected the ER degradation of translocation-arrested apoB in CHO cells that lack MTP. Due to a lack of MTP, CHO cells can not fully translocate apoB across the ER, resulting in its rapid degradation (18Du E. Kurth J. Wang S.-L. Humiston P. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Thrift R.N. Drisko J. Dueland S. Trawick J.D. Davis R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9161-9165Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Our results show that the normally rapid proteasome degradation of translocation-arrested apoB can be reversibly blocked by 7α-hydroxylase via a sterol-sensitive ubiquitin conjugation step in the ER. An expression plasmid encoding rat 7α-hydroxylase driven by the CMV promoter was constructed and transfected into CHO cells, as described (29Wang S.-L. Du E.Z. Martin T.D. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19351-19358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).

Lactacystin was a generous gift from Ardythe McCracken. All cells were cultured in modified Eagle's medium (MEM; Life Technologies) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Gemni) and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 500 μg/ml fungizone) and other antibiotics for selection as indicated below. Within each cell type, there was no observed difference in cell viability or growth rate between individual clones used for the experiments. For most experiments, cells were grown to 80% confluence in the absence of antibiotics unless indicated. B53 cells (CHO cells expressing apoB53 (18Du E. Kurth J. Wang S.-L. Humiston P. Davis R.A. J.

Diggelmann H. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1984; 4: 2929-2931Crossref Scopus (187) Google Scholar) at an 18:1 molar ratio. Cells were selected in 500 μg/ml hygromycin (for 7α-hydroxylase) and 400 μg/ml G418 (for apoB). Resistant cells were characterized as described below. B53 cells were co-transfected with a pcDNA3 plasmid containing the coding region of human 7α-hydroxylase driven by the CMV promoter and a plasmid conferring resistance to hygromycin, as described above. Resistant cells were characterized as described below. The coding sequence for the dominant negative form of ubiquitin Ub (K48R) (with a Lys → Arg mutation at amino acid 48 (32Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar) was released from plasmid pCW8 using restriction enzymeBamHI and cloned into expression vector pIND at theBamHI site (Ecdysone-inducible expression kit, Invitrogen). The pIND-K48R plasmid is then co-transfected with the pVgRXR plasmid at a 1:19 molar ratio into B53 cells. Cells were selected in 500 μg/ml Zeocin for Ub (K48R) and then maintained in 250 μg/ml Zeocin. Single cell clones were obtained. Poly(A+) RNA was isolated from cells using a modification of the guanidinium isothiocyanate method, as described (33Trawick J.D. Lewis K.D. Dueland S. Moore G.L. Simon F.R. Davis R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The resulting mRNA (2–5 μg) was separated on a 0.8% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and probed with nick-translated 32P-cDNA probes for 7α-hydroxylase, and β-actin was prepared from gel-purified inserts as described (33Trawick J.D. Lewis K.D. Dueland S. Moore G.L. Simon F.R. Davis R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (100 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Western blotting was performed as described (18Du E. Kurth J. Wang S.-L. Humiston P. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following SDS-PAGE, the gels were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The nonspecific binding sites of the membranes were blocked using 10% defatted dry milk, followed by the addition of primary antibody. The relative amount of primary antibody bound to the proteins in the nitrocellulose membranes was detected with species-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG. Blots were developed using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). B53 and JF7 cells were grown to 80% confluence on 60-mm plates, after which the culture medium was changed to methionine-free MEM (Sigma). One hour later, cells were pulsed with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml; DuPont) for 10 min, after which cells were chased with culture medium containing a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled methionine. At indicated chase time points, cells were lysed in 1 ml of TETN buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (100 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described (18Du E. Kurth J. Wang S.-L. Humiston P. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Solubilized proteins were precleared with Sepharose CL-4B. 5 μl of a rabbit antiserum specific for human apoB was preincubated with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (dry volume) in 1 ml of TETN buffer at 4 °C overnight. The beads were then washed with TETN buffer three times. The antibody-bound protein A-Sepharose conjugates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the cellular protein samples in an amount determined empirically to completely bind the apoB present in each sample. Beads were recovered by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge and were washed three times with the TETN buffer. The immunoprecipitates were dissolved in sample buffer containing SDS and β-mercaptoethanol and separated on a 1–20% gradient SDS-PAGE. The protein content of the cell lysate was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). JF7 cells cultured to 85% confluence were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation, and microsomes were isolated by subsequent ultracentrifugation (9Borchardt R.A. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16394-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein content was analyzed by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Trypsin digestion was carried out as described (18Du E. Kurth J. Wang S.-L. Humiston P. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each microsomal sample (containing 50 μg of protein) was incubated with 15 μg/ml trypsin in ST buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4) for 30 min on ice. The digestion was stopped by adding protease inhibitors (300 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μg/ml leupeptin each). Microsomes were recovered by centrifugation at 45,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA 45 rotor for 2 h at 4 °C. The microsomal pellet was resuspended in ST buffer and solubilized in sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. The samples were separated on a linear 1–20% polyacrylamide gradient SDS-PAGE, Western blotted, and detected by using anti-human apoB monoclonal Ab 1D1 and a rabbit antiserum against protein-disulfide isomerase (a generous gift from Steve Fuller). Cells were grown on coverslips in 100-mm plates to 60% confluence. Media were removed from the plates, and the cells were washed three times with PBS before they were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Cells were then permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 for 7 min. Nonspecific binding sites in the cells were blocked by incubation with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. The cells were then incubated for 45 min with 20 μl of affinity-purified antibodies. At the end of the incubation, cells were washed four times with PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) and then incubated with the appropriate species-specific Texas Red-conjugated IgG. After washing with PBST, the coverslips were examined using a Nikon microscope with a camera attached. Cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS. Cellular proteins were then solubilized in 1 ml of TETN buffer containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (see “Pulse-Chase Analysis and Immunoprecipitation”). ApoB was immunoprecipitated using 5 μl of a rabbit antiserum specific for human apoB preincubated with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates were separated on a 1–20% gradient SDS-PAGE and then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The ubiquitin conjugated on apoB was detected by an affinity-purified rabbit antibody against ubiquitin, followed by chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Western blots were scanned by a densitometer and analyzed by the ImageQuant program. Previous results showed that when apoB53 is stably expressed in CHO cells (B53 cells), it is rapidly degraded, producing an N-terminal fragment that is secreted without a lipid core (18Du E. Kurth J. Wang S.-L. Humiston P. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteolytic inhibitor ALLN blocks the formation of the N-terminal apoB fragment and causes intact apoB53 to accumulate as a transmembrane protein in isolated microsomes. These cells, stably transfected with a plasmid expressing rat 7α-hydroxylase, are hereafter referred to as JF7 cells. The rate of growth of JF7 cells was indistinguishable from B53 and wild-type CHO-K1 cells. In JF7 cells, a single band for 7α-hydroxylase mRNA was detected by Northern blot, whereas none was detected in B53 cells (data not shown). Analysis of the content of 7α-hydroxylase protein by Western blot showed a single protein band, identical in size to the native protein (data shown below). The enzyme activity of 7α-hydroxylase in CHO cells transfected with the CMV-driven plasmid containing the rat cDNA was ∼10 pmol/mg protein/min. In the absence of proteolytic inhibitors, intact apoB53 was nearly absent in B53 cells (Fig. 1, lane 1). Treating B53 cells with ALLN caused intact apoB53 to accumulate (Fig. 1, lane 2). Remarkably, 7α-hydroxylase expression caused intact apoB53 to accumulate (JF7 cells; Fig. 1, lane 3). The amount of apoB53 in JF7 and B53 cells treated with ALLN was similar (Fig. 1, comparelane 3 with lane 2). Moreover, treating JF7 cells with ALLN did not cause further accumulation of apoB53 (Fig. 1, lane 4). This experiment was performed at least five times (using different cell preparations), and there were no significant differences in the content of apoB53 in JF7 cells treated with or without ALLN. Additional studies using [35S]methionine pulse labeling and immunoprecipitation also showed that ALLN did not cause the accumulation of intact apoB53 in JF7 cells (data not shown). Interestingly, treating JF7 cells with ALLN did increase the amount of smaller apoB fragments (Fig. 1, lane 4). These data suggest that, in contrast to apoB53, the degradation of small apoB peptides is blocked by ALLN in JF7 cells. Thus, JF7 cells are sensitive to proteolytic block by ALLN. These combined data suggest that the expression of 7α-hydroxylase caused intact apoB53 to accumulate by blocking a proteolytic process that is blocked by ALLN in cells that do not express 7α-hydroxylase (i.e. B53 cells; Fig. 1,lane 2). To exclude the possibility that the phenotype we observed was due to an artifact of the individual plasmid, the transfection procedure, or the site of genomic integration, we isolated three individual single cell clones of B53 cells expressing rat 7α-hydroxylase. Each clone showed a comparable level of intact apoB53 in the absence of ALLN. Moreover, to rule out the possibility that the JF7 phenotype was due to a phenomenon unique to the transfected plasmid, we used an entirely different plasmid encoding human 7α-hydroxylase (B53–7αh cells). Cells stably expressing human 7α-hydroxylase displayed an accumulation of apoB53 that was similar to that of JF7 cells (Fig. 1,lane 5). Additional experiments showed that B53 cells transfected with different vectors not expressing 7α-hydroxylase (e.g. luciferase and MTP) together with a hygromycin resistance plasmid did not cause the JF7 phenotype (i.e. the accumulation of intact apoB53; data not shown). These data indicate that the accumulation of apoB53 in JF7 cells is due to the expression of 7α-hydroxylase (rat or human) and cannot be ascribed to a phenomenon caused by the transfection procedure, metabolic selection, or a single type of expression plasmid. The finding that inhibition of proteolysis by ALLN caused equivalent amounts of intact apoB53 to accumulate in B53 cells and JF7 cells (Fig.1, compare lanes 2 and 4) suggests that both cells types synthesize similar amounts of apoB53. The turnover of newly synthesized apoB53 was determined in JF7 and B53 cells using pulse-chase analysis. In both groups of cells, maximal accumulation of [35S]methionine-labeled apoB53 was detected after 30 min of chase (Fig.2). Similar pulse-chase labeling of apoB has been observed using rat hepatocytes (9Borchardt R.A. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16394-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human hepatoma cells (16Bonnardel J.A. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28892-28896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The amount of maximally labeled apoB53 in JF7 cells at the 30-min chase time was 14-fold higher than that in B53 cells. These data are consistent with the proposal that apoB53 was degraded in a manner that appeared to be co-translational and that the expression of 7α-hydroxylase in JF7 cells blocked this process. We examined if oxysterols could reverse the block in apoB53 degradation exhibited by JF7 cells. Adding 25-hydroxycholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol to JF7 cells caused a marked increased in the rate of apoB53 degradation (Fig.3). The oxysterol effect was observed during the 30-min pulse period and the 30-min chase period. After the 30-min chase period, the rate of decay of apoB53 was similar to that of untreated cells (Fig. 3). Additional data show that total protein synthesis was indistinguishable between JF7, B53, and JF7 cells treated with oxysterols (i.e. the incorporation of [35S]methionine into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein was similar in all groups; data not shown). The pulse-chase experiments were performed three separate times (using different preparations of B53 and JF7 cells). In all experiments, oxysterols reversed the blocked degradation of intact apoB53. In two additional experiments, JF7 cells were incubated with and without oxysterols for 24 h. Western blot analysis of the cell extracts showed a 70–95% decrease in the cellular content of apoB53 in cells treated with oxysterols (data not shown). The combined data indicate that the rapid degradation of apoB that is blocked by expression of 7α-hydroxylase can be reversed by oxysterols. We examined the localization of apoB53 that accumulated in JF7 cells following subcellular membrane fractionation and isolation. Following cell disruption and ultracentrifugation, >90% of the apoB53 in JF7 cells was isolated in the 100,000 × g pellet (i.e. microsomes). Moreover, in microsomes prepared from JF7 cells essentially all apoB53 was susceptible to digestion with exogenous trypsin (Fig. 4). The major and smallest molecular weight proteolytic fragment of apoB produced by trypsin digestion had a molecular mass of 69 kDa, which is identical to the results obtained using B53 cells treated with ALLN (18Du E. Kurth J. Wang S.-L. Humiston P. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There were two additional immunoreactive bands (of about 128 and 116 kDa) that were detected in JF7 microsomes following trypsin treatment. These immunoreactive bands showed markedly less chemiluminescence compared with the 69-kDa band. The 69-kDa fragment contained a defined apoB N-terminal epitope (residues 474–539) as demonstrated by its recognition by monoclonal antibody 1D1 (34Marcel Y.L. Innerarity T.L. Spilman C. Mahley R.W. Protter A.A. Milne R.W. Arteriosclerosis. 1987; 7: 166-175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). In contrast to the complete degradation of apoB53, the ER luminal protein, protein-disulfide isomerase, was resistant to trypsin digestion (Fig.4), indicating that the microsomes remained intact. The combined data suggest that the majority of apoB53 that accumulates in JF7 cells assumes a transmembrane orientation in which 69 kDa of the N terminus resides within the ER lumen and the remaining C terminus is exposed to the cytoplasm. Indirect immunofluorescence was used to examine the accumulation of apoB in JF7 cells. We used two epitope-specific antibodies: monoclonal antibody 1D1, which recognizes the N-terminal residues 474–539 (34Marcel Y.L. Innerarity T.L. Spilman C. Mahley R.W. Protter A.A. Milne R.W. Arteriosclerosis. 1987; 7: 166-175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a rabbit antiserum, which recognizes a C-terminal epitope of apoB53 at residue 2140 (35Innerarity T.L. Young S.G. Poksay K.S. Mahley R.W. Smith R.S. Milne R.W. Marcel Y.L. Weisgraber K.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 1794-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The N-terminal epitope-specific antibody will recognize both intact apoB53 and N-terminal apoB peptides, whereas the C-terminal specific antiserum will recognize only intact apoB53. In B53 cells, the N-terminal specific antibody resulted in a diffuse reticular immunofluorescence pattern (Fig. 5). In JF7 cells, the N-terminal epitope-specific antibody showed a unique punctate immunofluorescence pattern that overlaid a more diffuse reticular pattern (Fig. 5). In contrast, the antiserum recognizing the C-terminal epitope showed no specific immunofluorescence in B53 cells, while there was a d"

ACT is a member of the serineprotease inhibitor family, known as serpins, which typically possesses a reactive site loop (RSL) domain that interacts with target proteases (9Travis J. Salvesen G.S.

Because these ACT isoforms are all recognized by anti-ACT sera, these observations raise the question of the molecular identity of ACT-like immunoreactivity in Alzheimer's disease brains. However, the primary structure of ACT encoded by human brain ACT cDNA has not been elucidated. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine the molecular identity of the ACT cDNA expressed in AD and normal hippocampus, a brain region abundant in amyloid plaques in AD, as well as to characterize the brain ACT. Direct reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and DNA sequence analyses have defined the primary sequence of ACT in Alzheimer's and normal brains. Moreover, the defined primary sequence of the human hippocampus ACT cDNA sequence resolves its identity compared with reported variations in human liver ACT cDNA sequences (5Chandra T. Stackhouse R.

Primary sequence comparisons indicate that the human hippocampus and liver ACTs resemble one another with greater than 90% homology. Further analyses of hippocampus and liver ACTs were performed with respect to transcription initiation sites and expression of the ACT gene as well as the glycoprotein nature of ACT. This study has, thus, defined the primary sequence and characteristics of ACT expressed in control and Alzheimer's disease brains. To obtain the segment of the hippocampus ACT cDNA corresponding to the predicted open reading frame (ORF) encoding the primary sequence of the hippocampus ACT, RT-PCR and DNA sequence analysis of overlapping 790- and 502-bp 5′ and 3′ cDNA fragments, respectively, of human hippocampus ACT cDNA from AD and normal brains was performed (see Fig. 1). In addition, RT-PCR also generated a 296-bp DNA fragment that represents the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) that overlaps with the 502-bp cDNA fragment. PCR primers were designed based on reported human liver ACT cDNA sequences (5Chandra T. Stackhouse R. Kidd V.J. Robson K.J.H. Woo S.L.C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5055-5060Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 6Rubin H. Wang Z. Nickbarg E.B. McLarney S. Naidoo N. Schoenberger O.L. Johnson J.L. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol.

Genet. 1992; 90: 467-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). RT-PCR of poly(A)+ RNA from normal and Alzheimer's hippocampus was conducted three times, each time with RNA isolated from a separate sample of tissue; two to four subclones from each PCR reaction were analyzed by DNA sequencing. Total RNA was isolated from frozen hippocampus tissue from AD and normal brains with the TRIZOLTM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) (tissues were from the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center at McLean Hospital, Belmont, MA and the First Department of Anatomy, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary). Frozen tissue (100 mg aliquots) was pulverized in liquid N2, solubilized in 1.0 ml of TRIZOL reagent, extracted with 0.2 ml chloroform, isoamylalcohol (49/1, v/v), and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The sample was then centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, and the resultant RNA in the aqueous phase was precipitated by isopropanol and resuspended in 50 μl of TE buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA). Isolation of poly(A)+ RNA from total RNA utilized the Poly(A)Tract mRNA Isolation System IV (according to the manufacturer's protocol; Promega). Poly(A)+ in the RNA sample (100 μg) was annealed to the biotinylated oligo(dT) probe at room temperature. The oligo(dT)-poly(A)+ hybrid was bound to streptavidin paramagnetic particles and washed with 0.1× SSC (1× SSC, 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), and bound poly(A)+ RNA was eluted with diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and concentrated by ethanol precipitation. In addition, poly(A)+ RNA from normal human hippocampus and liver were purchased (CLONTECH) for RT-PCR. RT-PCR of overlapping 790- and 502-bp cDNA fragments that span the ORF of the ACT utilized SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and PCR reagents from Perkin-Elmer (according to the manufacturer's protocols). RT-PCR of a 790-bp 5′-fragment of ACT utilized the primers 5′-GGTTCTGCCCTGCTGTCCTCTGC-3′ (sense, primer 1) and 5′-GGGAGGATGAAGAGTGCGCTGGC-3′ (antisense, primer 2). RT-PCR of a 502-bp 3′-fragment of ACT utilized the primers 5′-CGGGACGAGGAGCTGTCCTGCA-3′ (sense, primer 3) and 5′-TGCTGGGATTGGTGACTTTGCTCAT-3′ (antisense, primer 4) (primers were from Life Technologies, Inc.). First strand cDNA synthesis utilized 0.5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA and antisense primer (0.15 μm) with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (200 units) at 50 °C for 50 min. After the addition of MgCl2 to 1.5 mm and sense primer (0.15 μm), PCR withTaq polymerase (5 units) was conducted with 40 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 1 min at 70 °C, with a final step at 70 °C for 7 min. PCR products were analyzed by DNA agarose gel electrophoresis. Attempts to obtain the full-length coding region of the ACT cDNA by one RT-PCR reaction (primers 1 and 4) were not successful, most likely because of the lower efficiency of PCR in amplifying larger DNA fragments. Therefore, the segment of the hippocampus ACT cDNA corresponding to the predicted ORF was assessed by DNA sequence analyses of the overlapping 790- and 502-bp PCR fragments. To obtain a cDNA fragment representing the 3′-UTR of human hippocampus ACT, RT-PCR was utilized to generate a 296-bp fragment that overlaps with the 502-bp PCR-generated fragment. The first strand DNA synthesis utilized 2 μg of human hippocampus poly(A+) RNA (CLONTECH) primed with 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)20 and incubated with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (200 units, Life Technologies, Inc.) at 42 °C for 1 h. PCR was then conducted with sense and antisense primers at 0.4 μm (primers 5 and 6, respectively) consisting of 5′-CAGACACCCAGAACATCTTCTT-3′ and 5′-GGCCAACGAAATTATTTATTGCTG-3′, respectively, Taq polymerase (0.5 unit, Qiagen), and thermocycling consisting of 35 cycles of 50 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 42 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, with a final incubation at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR-generated DNA fragments were subcloned (by ligation with T4 DNA ligase) into the PCR 2.0 plasmid vector (Invitrogen) and amplified in XL-1 Blue supercompetent Escherichia coli cells (Stratagene). DNA inserts of appropriate size (assessed by digestion of the plasmid with EcoRI) were subjected to automated DNA sequencing with fluorescent-labeled dideoxynucleotides and the Applied Biosystems 373A automated DNA sequencer, as well as manual DNA sequencing (with the U. S. Biochemical Corp. Sequenase Version 2.0 sequencing kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as described previously (3Hwang S.R. Kohn A.B. Hook V.Y.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 4Hwang S.R. Kohn A.B. Hook V.Y.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Primers for DNA sequencing utilized reverse and forward primers corresponding to vector M13 sequences that flank the DNA insert. DNA sequencing of the 5′ fragment also required primers corresponding to the ACT cDNA to walk the sequencing along the length of the cDNA. These sequencing primers were designated ACT N1, ACT N2, and ACT N3, which corresponded to 5′-TGTCTCTGGGGGCCCATAAT-3′, 5′-ACGGAGGATGCCAAGAGGCT-3′, and 5′-CTTTGACCCCCAAGATACTC-3′, respectively. The MacVector DNA sequencing software was used to align DNA sequences from overlapping sequencing reactions. The determined nucleotide sequence of the human hippocampus ACT cDNA has been submitted to GenBank with accession number AF089747. For Northern blots, total RNA was isolated from hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease and normal aged (50–80 years old) brains (from the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center at McLean Hospital, Belmont, MA) by cesium trifluoroacetate density ultracentrifugation, as described previously (3Hwang S.R. Kohn A.B. Hook V.Y.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The precipitated RNA was resuspended in TE buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA), subjected to 1.2% agarose/denaturing formaldehyde gel electrophoresis (10 μg RNA/lane), and blotted to GeneScreen PlusR membrane (NEN Life Science Products) for Northern analysis. The DNA probe was aXmnI-BglII 652-bp fragment of the human liver ACT cDNA (6Rubin H. Wang Z. Nickbarg E.B. McLarney S. Naidoo N. Schoenberger O.L. Johnson J.L. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), labeled by nick-translation (kit from Stratagene) with [α-32P]dCTP (5,000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products). Hybridization with 32P probe was conducted in 10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS, and 1.0 m NaCl at 60 °C overnight. The membrane was then washed 2 times in 2× SSC at room temperature for 5 min, 2 times in 2× SSC, 1% SDS at 60 °C for 30 min, and in 0.1× SSC at room temperature for 30 min. Autoradiography with Kodak X-Omat AR-5 film was conducted. RNA slot blots were performed with poly(A)+ RNA from human hippocampus and liver (purchased from CLONTECH) diluted to 9, 1, 0.1, and 0.1 ng/μl. One hundred μl of each dilution was combined with 300 μl of 6.15 m formaldehyde in 10× SSC and incubated at 67 °C for 15 min. Samples were applied onto nitrocellulose membranes under vacuum, washed with 10× SSC, and cross-linked by exposure to UV irradiation. The DNA probe,EcoRI-SalI human ACT cDNA fragment of 943 bp, was labeled to a specific activity of 1 × 108cpm/μg with [α-32P]dCTP by Stratagene's random priming kit. The membrane was hybridized with the probe (1 × 106 cpm/ml) in 5× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 68 °C overnight. The membrane was washed three times in 1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at room temperature, twice in 0.1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 15 min, in 0.1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 5 min, and then in 0.1× SSPE at room temperature. Autoradiography was performed using Kodak X-Omat AR-5 film. Genomic DNA from the midbrain of normal adults (from the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center at McLean Hospital, Belmont, MA) was isolated by cesium chloride equilibrium density gradient centrifugation, as described previously (3Hwang S.R. Kohn A.B. Hook V.Y.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). An aliquot of genomic DNA (10 μg) was digested with 40 units of EcoRI,BamHI, KpnI, or HindIII and subjected to 0.8% DNA-agarose gel electrophoresis. The gel was dried at 60 °C for 1–2 h and subjected to in situ hybridization (3Hwang S.R. Kohn A.B. Hook V.Y.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with human liver ACT cDNA of 1.5 kilobase (EcoRI digests) (ACT cDNA from Dr. Harvey Rubin, University of Pennsylvania) (6Rubin H. Wang Z. Nickbarg E.B. McLarney S. Naidoo N. Schoenberger O.L. Johnson J.L. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The probe was labeled by nick translation (kit from Stratagene) with [α-32P]dCTP (5,000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) to a specific activity of 1 × 108 cpm/μg of DNA. Unincorporated [α-32P]dCTP was removed by G-50 gel filtration. Hybridization was conducted by incubating the genomic DNA gel with ACT cDNA probe (at 5 × 106 cpm/ml) in 5× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg of salmon sperm DNA at 60 °C overnight, followed by washing in 1× SPPE, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 2 h, and a final wash in 0.1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 1 h. The genomic blot was then subjected to autoradiography with Kodak X-Omat AR-5 film. Primer extension utilized poly(A)+ RNA from human hippocampus and liver (purchased from CLONTECH) with a primer corresponding to 5′-CTGCCTCAGGGAGCTGGA-3′ (primer A, see Fig. 1). The primer was labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase with 5 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (5,000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) to a specific activity of 1 × 109 cpm/μg. Unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was removed by G-25 gel filtration. The32P-labeled primer (1 × 107 cpm) was annealed to 5.0 μg of poly(A)+ RNA by heating at 65 °C for 1.5 h in 1× SuperScript II buffer (from Life Technologies, Inc.) and then cooled to room temperature. Primers were extended with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (200 units, Life Technologies, Inc.) at 48 °C for 90 min in 0.5 mm dNTP, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 2 mm MgCl2, 27 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 120 μm actinomycin D (Boehringer Mannheim). RNase A (10 μg from Boehringer Mannheim) was added, and incubation continued at 37 °C for 15 min. Sodium acetate was added to a final concentration of 0.27 m, and the sample was subjected to phenol/chloroform extraction, followed by chloroform extraction. The aqueous phase was precipitated with ethanol, and the resultant sedimented cDNA was resuspended in 10 μl of 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 33% formamide, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol FF. This sample was electrophoresed on an 8.0% acrylamide-bis-acrylamide 19:1 (w/w) 7 m urea sequencing gel in 1× TBE buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, 83 mmboric acid, 1 mm EDTA). After electrophoresis, the gel was soaked for 15 min in 5% acetic acid, 15% methanol to remove urea and was then dried for 1.5 h at 80 °C under vacuum. Autoradiography was performed with Kodak X-Omat AR-5 film. Proteins were extracted from frozen hippocampus (approximately 4 g of tissue) from Alzheimer's disease or normal brains (tissues were from the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center at McLean Hospital, Belmont, MA) by the TRIZOLTM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). For deglycosylation of protein extracts from hippocampus and of human liver ACT (from Athens Research and Technology Biochemicals), ACT samples were incubated with N-glycosidase F (0.2 units, Boehringer Mannheim) at 37 °C for 18 h in buffer (25 μl total volume) consisting of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 10 mm sodium azide, 50 mm EDTA, and 0.5% (w/v) octyloglucoside. Samples were then subjected to Western blots, as described previously (11Azaryan A.V. Krieger T.J. Hook V.Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8201-8208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12Schiller M.R. Mende-Mueller L. Moran K. Meng M. Miller K.W. Hook V.Y.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7988-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), with affinity-purified anti-ACT IgGs (1:100 final dilution), detected with anti-rabbit goat IgGs conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (from Promega, performed according to the manufacturer's procedure). For affinity purification of anti-ACT for Western blots, IgGs (immunoglobulins) were purified from anti-ACT serum (ART Biochemicals) by protein A-Sepharose chromatography (according to the manufacturer's protocol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Anti-ACT IgGs were then affinity-purified on an ACT-Sepharose affinity column. The ACT affinity column was obtained by covalently linking ACT (from human liver, ART Biochemicals) to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, according to the manufacturer's instructions). The anti-ACT IgGs were bound to the ACT affinity column in equilibration buffer consisting of 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20. After washing with equilibration buffer, anti-ACT IgGs were eluted with elution buffer 1 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 750 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), followed by elution buffer 2 (0.1 m citric acid-NaOH, pH 4.0, 750 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). Fractions containing anti-ACT IgGs were detected by binding to ACT in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, performed as described previously (13Hook V.Y.H. Mezey E. Fricker L.D. Pruss R.M. Siegel R. Brownstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4745-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified anti-ACT IgGs were concentrated by a Centricon-30 apparatus (Pierce). RT-PCR was used to determine the primary sequence of ACT expressed in hippocampus from AD and normal brains. Primers for RT-PCR were designed based on reported homologous sequences of neuroendocrine and liver ACTs (3Hwang S.R. Kohn A.B. Hook V.Y.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

RT-PCR and DNA sequence analyses for each overlapping DNA segment were performed from three separate tissue samples of control hippocampus and from three separate samples of AD hippocampus. Poly(A)+ RNA from each tissue sample was subjected to RT-PCR to amplify 3′ and 5′ regions of the ACT cDNA. From each RT-PCR reaction, DNA inserts from two to four subclones were subjected to DNA sequence analyses. The predicted 790-bp and 502-bp DNA fragments representing 5′ and 3′ domains of the ORF of the ACT cDNA were generated from AD and normal hippocampus as well as from liver poly(A)+ RNA (Fig.2). Southern blots confirmed that these 790- and 502-bp PCR-amplified DNA fragments hybridized with the human liver ACT cDNA as probe (data not shown). DNA sequence analyses of these RT-PCR-generated DNA fragments, with alignment of overlapping 5′ and 3′ DNA fragments, provided the nucleotide and deduced the primary sequence of the hippocampus ACT cDNA from AD and normal brains (Fig. 3). Importantly, the ACT cDNAs isolated from AD and normal hippocampus were identical in nucleotide and deduced primary sequences for the mature ACT protein translation product. It is predicted that the mature ACT in hippocampus may begin with His or Asn at its NH2 terminus, consistent with removal of the NH2-terminal signal peptide sequence (14Gierasch L.M.

Similarly, mature ACT from liver and plasma begins with His (residue +1) or Asn (+3) (6Rubin H. Wang Z. Nickbarg E.B. McLarney S. Naidoo N. Schoenberger O.L. Johnson J.L. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol.

The open reading frame domains of ACT cDNAs from normal and Alzheimer's disease brains were identical. The DNA sequence of the 3′-UTR domain of the hippocampus ACT cDNA (from normal brain) was also determined. Alignment of the DNA sequences determined for overlapping 5′ and 3′ PCR fragments indicates the human hippocampus ACT cDNA (shown in bold for nucleotides 111 to 1576), whose deduced primary sequence (shown in bold for residues −7 to 398) corresponds to the mature ACT protein. The positions of primers 1–6 used in RT-PCRs are shown by dotted lines with arrows.

In addition, the glycoprotein nature of hippocampus ACT is indicated by consensus glycosylation sites of Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr at residues 10, 70, 83, 104, 163, and 248 (Fig. 3).

https://openalex.org/W2333104690,"Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), or congenital aganglionic megacolon, is the most frequent cause of congenital bowel obstruction. Germline mutations in the RET receptor tyrosine kinase have been shown to cause HSCR. Mice that carry null alleles for RET or for its ligand, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), both exhibit complete intestinal aganglionosis and renal defects. Recently, the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein Grb10 has been shown to interact with RET in vitro and in vivo, early in development. We have confirmed the map location of GRB10 on human chromosome 7, isolated human BACs containing the gene, elucidated its genomic structure, isolated a highly polymorphic microsatellite marker adjacent to exon 14 and scanned the gene for mutations in a large panel of HSCR patients. No evidence of linkage was detected in HSCR kindreds and no mutations were found in patients. These data suggest that while GRB10 may be important for signal transduction in developing embryos, it does not play an obvious role in HSCR."
https://openalex.org/W1966587932,"The CD155 protein is the founding member of a new group of related molecules within the immunoglobulin superfamily sharing a V-C2-C2 domain structure and significant amino acid identity. We have recently isolated the promoter of the CD155 gene so that we may determine the transcription factors that regulate its expression and possibly gain insight into the cell biology of this gene. Here we report the mapping of three cis-elements within the CD155 core promoter, designated FPI, II, and III. The results of linker scanning mutagenesis suggest that all three of these cis-elements are required in varying degrees for the promoter activity of the core promoter fragment. The relative contribution of each region ranked in the following order: III > II > I. Interestingly, footprint and electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that FPIII binding activity is much reduced in a human cell line that does not express CD155. Additionally, protein binding to FPI and FPII was also investigated. DNase I footprinting using recombinant hAP-2α indicated that this transcription factor bound to both the FPI and FPII regions of the CD155 core promoter fragment. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and supershift analysis confirmed the binding of AP-2 from crude nuclear extracts to FPI and to FPII. Lastly, cotransfection of the CD155promoter with an AP-2α expression vector indicates that overexpression of AP-2α modulated the promoter activity of aCD155 promoter construct. The CD155 protein is the founding member of a new group of related molecules within the immunoglobulin superfamily sharing a V-C2-C2 domain structure and significant amino acid identity. We have recently isolated the promoter of the CD155 gene so that we may determine the transcription factors that regulate its expression and possibly gain insight into the cell biology of this gene. Here we report the mapping of three cis-elements within the CD155 core promoter, designated FPI, II, and III. The results of linker scanning mutagenesis suggest that all three of these cis-elements are required in varying degrees for the promoter activity of the core promoter fragment. The relative contribution of each region ranked in the following order: III > II > I. Interestingly, footprint and electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that FPIII binding activity is much reduced in a human cell line that does not express CD155. Additionally, protein binding to FPI and FPII was also investigated. DNase I footprinting using recombinant hAP-2α indicated that this transcription factor bound to both the FPI and FPII regions of the CD155 core promoter fragment. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and supershift analysis confirmed the binding of AP-2 from crude nuclear extracts to FPI and to FPII. Lastly, cotransfection of the CD155promoter with an AP-2α expression vector indicates that overexpression of AP-2α modulated the promoter activity of aCD155 promoter construct. The study of the mechanism by which poliovirus (PV) 1The abbreviations used are: PV, poliovirus; bp, base pair(s); EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; RT, reverse transcription; BL, Burkitt's lymphoma; NF, nuclear factor. binds to and enters a host cell has led to the discovery of a group of related genes belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. The founding member of this group of related genes, the human poliovirus receptor (hPVR)/CD155, was cloned based on its ability to mediate the attachment of PV to host cells (1Mendelsohn C.L. Wimmer E. Racaniello V.R. Cell. 1989; 56: 855-865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). The CD155 gene encodes glycoproteins with three extracellular immunoglobulin domains designated V-C2-C2 (1Mendelsohn C.L. Wimmer E. Racaniello V.R.

Alternate splicing of the CD155primary transcript gives rise to four isoforms: CD155α and CD155δ, which are integral membrane proteins; and CD155β and CD155γ, which are presumably secreted because they lack the exon encoding a transmembrane domain (2Koike S. Horie H. Ise I. Okitsu A. Yoshida M. Iizuka N. Takeuchi K. Takegami T. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3217-3224Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The involvement of the viral receptor activity of the CD155 protein in both poliovirus attachment and the pathogenesis of poliovirus infections has been the subject of intense investigation (for review, see Refs. 7Wimmer E.

The amino-terminal V type immunoglobulin domain of the integral membrane splice variants of CD155 serves as the PV binding moeity. Receptor binding then leads to virion destabilization and virus entry into host cells (7Wimmer E. Harber J.J. Bibb J.A. Gromeier M. Lu H.-H. Bernhardt G. Wimmer E.

In addition, transgenic mice expressing the CD155 protein develop a syndrome very similar to human poliomyelitis when infected by PV, an observation suggesting that the CD155 protein is a major determinant of the tissue tropism displayed by PV (19Ren R.B. Costantini F. Gorgacz E.J. Lee J.J. Racaniello V.R. Cell. 1990; 63: 353-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 20Koike S. Taya C. Kurata T. Abe S. Ise I. Yonekawa H. Nomoto A.

Pathog. 1995; 18: 253-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Since the discovery of the CD155 gene, many genes possessing the V-C2-C2 domain architecture have been cloned from mouse, monkey, and man. In keeping with the fact that poliomyelitis is a disease that strictly affects primates, two homologous genes of CD155 which function as viral receptors were cloned from the African green monkey,AGMα1 and AGMα2 (22Koike S. Ise I. Sato Y. Yonekawa H. Gotoh O. Nomoto A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7059-7066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A mouse relative, called MPH, has been isolated and characterized (23Morrison M.E. Racaniello V.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2807-2813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, two human genes, PRR1 (poliovirusreceptor-related) and PRR2 have been described which share approximately 52 and 51% homology to the CD155 extracellular domains (24Lopez M. Eberle F. Mattei M.-G. Gabert J. Birg F. Bardin F. Maroc C. Dubreuil P. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 155: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 25Eberle F. Dubreuil P. Mattei M.G. Devilard E. Lopez M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 159: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the MPH protein is more closely related to PRR2 than to CD155. Thus, MPH may not be the functional homolog of CD155, for which reason we will refer to it as mouse PRR2. In addition a CD155-related gene, the putative tumor antigen Tage4 was identified in rat and mouse (26Chadeneau C. LeMoullac B. Denis M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15601-15605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,27Chadeneau C. LeMoullac B. LeCabellec M. Mattei M. Meflah K. Denis M.G. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 636-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Until recently, the functions attributed to the molecules belonging to this subfamily have been obscure. Akoi et al. (28Aoki J. Koike S. Asou H. Ise I. Suwa H. Tanaka T. Miyasaka M. Nomoto A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 374-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) have reported that mouse PRR2 can serve as a homotypic cellular adhesion molecule that cannot bind any other members of theCD155-related gene family. Furthermore, CD155 has been reported to be physically associated with CD44 on monocytes (29Freistadt M.S. Eberle K.E. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 1247-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Interestingly, two publications by Chadeneau et al. (26Chadeneau C. LeMoullac B. Denis M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15601-15605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Chadeneau C. LeCabellec M. LeMoullac B. Meflah K. Denis M.G. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 68: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) report that the rat and mouse Tage4 antigens are highly expressed in neoplastic tissue, but little expression is observed in normal tissues, suggesting that Tage4 is a tumor antigen. Taken together, these studies suggest that the CD155 subfamily of genes may possess important biological activities such as representing a new group of homotypic cellular adhesion molecules or as diagnostic markers in the study of neoplasia. We have recently reported the cloning of the promoter region of theCD155 gene. A characterization of the CD155promoter region will allow us to determine the cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors that regulate the expression of the CD155 gene and possibly provide insight into the biology of the CD155 protein. Our previous work determined that the CD155 promoter activity resides within an approximately 280-bp genomic DNA fragment that lacks TATA and CAAT boxes and is rich in GC nucleotide content. Three major and several minor transcriptional start sites have been identified within an approximately 60-bp region of this segment of genomic DNA (31Solecki D. Schwarz S. Wimmer E. Lipp M. Bernhardt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5579-5586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Interestingly, promoter constructs containing the 280-bpCD155 core promoter were inactive in Raji cells, a cell line that did not express endogenous CD155 mRNA. In this report we have extended our analyses of the CD155promoter. By DNase I footprinting we have identified three functionalcis-acting elements (FPI–FPIII) within the CD155core promoter and addressed their importance for basal promoter activity by linker scanning mutagenesis. We have also identified acis-element in FPIII which is required for CD155promoter activity and may be involved in the tissue-specific expression of CD155. We demonstrate in footprinting experiments that recombinant hAP-2α can bind two adjacent AP-2 binding motifs within the core promoter. Mutation of these potential binding motifs, either singly or in tandem, resulted in a reduction of core promoter activity. These mutations also abrogated the binding of hAP-2α. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) confirmed AP-2 binding to FPI and FPII when the experiments were carried out using crude nuclear extracts. Lastly, overexpression of AP-2α in cotransfection experiments was found to stimulate the activity of the CD155 promoter approximately 3-fold. Cells from HeLa (cervical carcinoma), HEp-2 (epidermoid carcinoma), HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma), Saos-2 (osteocarcinoma), MDA-MB 435 (breast carcinoma), HEK293 (embryonic kidney), SK-N-SH (neuroblastoma), SK-N-MC (neuroblastoma), and HTB15 (glioblastoma) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. Raji (Burkitt's lymphoma), BL99 (Burkitt's lymphoma), IARC 549 (B-lymphoblast), U937 (histiocytic lymphoma), K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia), HL60 (promyelocytic leukemia), CEM (T-lymphoblastic leukemia), and Jurkat (T-lymphoblastic leukemia) cells were grown in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum. Nuclear extract preparation and DNase I footprinting were performed as described by Dynan et al. (32Dynan W.S. Setlow J.K. Genetic Engineering. Plenum Press, New York1987: 75-87Crossref Google Scholar) with the following modifications. End-labeled DNA probes were generated via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using oligonucleotides that were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by polynucleotide kinase. PCR was performed under standard conditions using 10 ng of pGL2-H template, 25 pmol labeled and unlabeled primers, and 1.2 units ofTaq polymerase. Radiolabeled PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% native polyacrylamide gel, the bands were visualized by autoradiography, and a selected band was excised from the gel and passively eluted. DNase I protection assays were performed using 105 cpm of labeled probe that was incubated in a 50-μl binding reaction containing 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) and nuclear protein or recombinant human AP-2α (Promega Corp.). After a 30-min incubation on ice, 50 ml of a solution (room temperature) of 5 mm CaCl2 and 10 mmMgCl2 was added to each reaction and incubated for 1 min at room temperature. 1 μl of DNase I (6–100 ng/μl) was added and incubated another min at room temperature. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 90 μl of stop solution (0.2m NaCl, 0.03 m EDTA, 1% SDS, and linear polyacrylamide as a carrier for ethanol precipitation). The mixture was then phenol/chloroform extracted twice, and the DNAs were ethanol precipitated. The samples were then electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide sequencing gels with a sequencing reaction as a marker. Site-directed mutagenesis of the BE CD155 promoter fragment was carried out using the megaprimer mutagenesis technique (33Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Aiqin L. Bock S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To generate a megaprimer for each mutant construct, 100 ng of pGL2-BE plasmid was amplified in a reaction containing 50 pmol of either 4529 or 4532 flanking primer, 50 pmol of mutagenic primer, 5 μl of 10 × buffer, 2 μl of 10 mm dNTP mix, and 0.5 μl of Taq polymerase (2.5 units, Stratagene) in a total reaction volume of 50 μl. Reactions to generate FPIII megaprimers utilized 4529 as the first flanking primer, whereas FPII and FPI utilized 4532. PCR amplification conditions were 94 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 45 s; 72 °C, 45 s for 35 cycles. All megaprimers were then gel purified. To extend a megaprimer to generate to a full-length 280 bp, 100 ng of pGL2-BE plasmid was amplified in a reaction containing 50 pmol of either 4529 or 4532 flanking primer (4529 for FPIII constructs and 4532 for FPII/FPI constructs), 1–2 μg of megaprimer, 5 μl of 10 × buffer, 2 μl of 10 mmdNTP mix, and 0.5 μl of Pfu polymerase (2.5 units, Stratagene). The HTB15 (human glioblastoma), HeLa (human cervical carcinoma), SK-N-MC (human neuroblastoma), and HepG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma) cell lines were transfected by the calcium phosphate procedure. Each transfection for the linker scan series of constructs was composed of 18 μg of wild type or mutant BE plasmid and 0.5 μg of pRL-TK (standard to the measure of transfectional efficiency). The composition of the cotransfection experiments was 9 μg of the BE, BE II(4), BE I(I), or BE ΔII/I plasmids mixed with up to 3 μg of pSP(RSV)-hAP-2α. Cotransfections with less than 3 μg of expression vector were supplemented with pSP(RSV) to keep the amount of backbone plasmid constant for each experiment. 50 μl of 2.5 mCaCl2 was added to the DNA mixtures, and then they were diluted to a total volume of 500 μl with TE buffer. These solutions were separately combined dropwise with 500 μl of ice-cold 2 × Hanks' balanced saline solution and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Half of the precipitates were added to a separate plate of tissue culture cells, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C. 4 h later the medium was removed, and a solution of 20% glycerol in Hanks' balanced saline solution was added. After a 3-min incubation at 37 °C, 3 ml of medium was added, and the supernatant was removed again and replaced by fresh medium with serum. All transfected cells were harvested 18 h post-transfection, and cell extracts (usually 200–400 μl) were made using the reporter lysis buffer from Promega. The oligodeoxynucleotides used for EMSAs were as follows.

Settings were: 5 min at 95 °C and 1 h each at 65, 60, 55, 50, 45, and 40 °C. The oligodeoxynucleotides were designed to possess a G as 5′-protruding nucleotide. 10 pmol of reassociated oligodeoxynucleotide was end labeled by a fill-in reaction using a thermostable polymerase (Thermoprime, Dianova). In a volume of 20 μl, the buffer, 0.5 μl of enzyme, 50 μCi of [α32-P]dCTP, 1 μl of 25 mm MgCl2, and the oligodeoxynucleotide were incubated at 40 °C for 10 min, 45 °C for 10 min, and 50 °C for 20 min. The labeled oligodeoxynucleotide was purified by Sephadex G-50 chromatography (Nick columns, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Usually more than 50% of label was found to be incorporated into the oligodeoxynucleotide. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the procedure by Schreiber et al. (34Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffer W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). In a total of 17 μl, 5 × incubation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 25% glycerol), 1.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), various concentrations of competitor or antibody (anti-AP-2α antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) when indicated, and 4 μl of cell extract were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature. After preincubation 3–4 μl of labeled oligodeoxynucleotide corresponding to 100 fmol was added and the incubation continued for another 20 min. Samples were loaded onto a 6% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel (5 × Tris-glycine: 250 mm Tris, 1.9 m glycine, 10 mm EDTA). After the electrophoresis (160 V) the gel was fixed in 10% acetic acid and 30% methanol for 30 min and dried. For Northern blotting and RT-PCR, total cellular RNA was isolated from 3 × 107 cells according to the TRIzol protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). mRNA was extracted from 107 cells using the Quick Prep mRNA purification kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. RT was done with Superscript Reverse Transcriptase from Life Technologies, Inc. using 10 μg of RNA as template and 1 pmol of gene-specific 3′-primer (AP-233) or 1 μg of oligo(dT12–18) in a reaction volume of 12 μl. The mixture was heated to 80 °C for 5 min and then allowed to cool to 42 °C. 4 μl of 5 × reaction buffer, 2 μl of 0.1m dithiothreitol, 1 μl of 10 mm dNTP mix, 1 μl of RNasin (25 units), and 1 μl of reverse transcriptase were added and the reaction incubated for 90 min at 42 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 20 μl of 0.4 m NaOH. After 10 min at 42 °C 20 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was added and the reverse transcriptase stocks frozen at −20 °C. Oligodeoxynucleotides used were as follows.

Cycling conditions were a denaturation step at 94 °C, 2 min, 35 cycles with 94 °C, 45 s; 55 °C, 45 s; 72 °C, 90 s (45 s for subtype-specific PCR), and a final extension step for 10 min at 72 °C. Products were separated on a 1.2% agarose gel. The HeLa full-length product was cut out and purified. After digestion withEcoRI the fragment was cloned into the expression vector pSP(RSV) (a kind gift from Helen Hurst). The AP-2α full-length insert was sequenced and found to be identical to the published open reading frame. Likewise, one clone each of the AP-2 subtype-specific PCR products was cloned and verified by sequencing. Cells were incubated on ice with monoclonal anti-CD155 antibody D171 (35Nobis P. Zibirre R. Meyer G. Kühne J. Warnecke G. Koch G. J. Gen. Virol. 1985; 66: 2563-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) in a 96-well plate for 20 min in a total volume of 100 μl, washed twice with 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (1% fetal bovine serum), and incubated with R-phycoerythrin-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody (Dianova) for another 20 min. Cells were washed twice and then analyzed using a flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). By transfecting several CD155-positive cell lines with reporter plasmids containing 5′ and 3′ serial deletions of CD155 upstream sequence, we have determined regions required for the expression of a reporter gene (31Solecki D. Schwarz S. Wimmer E. Lipp M. Bernhardt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5579-5586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These experiments identified a 280-bp genomic DNA fragment that possessed full promoter activity when transfected into all cell lines that we have previously determined to express CD155 (BE-fragment, see Fig. 1 A). In Raji cells as well as in all other Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell lines tested, the endogenous CD155 locus is transcriptionally inactive (31Solecki D. Schwarz S. Wimmer E. Lipp M. Bernhardt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5579-5586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). When BE reporter constructs were transfected into Raji cells, only background levels of luciferase reporter gene activity were detected, an observation indicating that this cell line was unable to support the expression of the reporter gene (31Solecki D. Schwarz S. Wimmer E. Lipp M. Bernhardt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5579-5586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seemed likely that the BE core promoter fragment may harborcis-element(s) required for basic promoter activity which may also confer cell type-specific expression to the CD155gene. To identify portions of the BE core promoter fragment which would interact with nuclear proteins, we performed DNase I footprint analyses using the nuclear extracts of CD155-negative Raji cells and CD155-positive HeLa S3 cells (Fig. 2). The nuclear extracts of HeLa S3 cells produced three protected regions, designated FPI, FPII, and FPIII (for relative location, see Fig.1 A; for sequences of protected regions, see Fig.1 B). Interestingly, the protection in the FPIII region is absent when the footprint reactions were carried using Raji nuclear extracts. When nuclear extracts of other cell lines that express CD155 were examined, footprint patterns identical to that of HeLa S3 were observed (data no shown). More specifically, the FPIII binding activity was always detected when extracts from CD155-expressing cell lines were used in the footprint assays. The results of these experiments identify three regions of the CD155 core promoter which are bound by nuclear proteins and are therefore candidates to harbor potentialcis-acting elements. In addition, they suggest that one of the binding activities for the CD155 promoter is either not present or may be present in much reduced abundance in the extracts of cells such as Raji cells which do not express CD155. Computer searches were performed to determine which potential transcription factor binding motifs are located in the footprinted regions (see Fig. 1 B). Most notably, putative AP-2 binding motifs are scattered over all three protected regions. In addition, potential binding sites for PuF are found in FPII and FPIII, whereas FPII contains a potential NFκB site. FPII also contains an overlapping GC box adjacent to the AP-2 site (not shown). To address the functional significance and map precisely thecis-acting elements located in the FPI–FPIII regions of the BE promoter fragment, a series of linker scan mutations was generated throughout the protected sequences. Each mutant promoter construct contains 6 bp of wild type CD155 promoter sequence replaced by a SpeI restriction enzyme site within the context of the BE fragment (for locations, see Fig. 1 B). The panel of mutant promoter constructs was transfected into the HeLa, SK-N-MC (human neuroblastoma), and HTB15 (human glioblastoma) cell lines (Fig.3). Particular mutations within all three protected regions showed reduced promoter activity. Moreover, the activity profile of the constructs was similar for all three cell lines tested (see Fig. 3). These results indicate that each of the footprinted regions harbors functional cis-acting elements, and the activity patterns of the constructs suggest that the threecis-acting elements exert similar functions in the three CD155-expressing cell lines tested. Profound reductions in promoter activity were observed when mutations were located within a 13-bp segment of FPIII (see Figs. 1 Band 3). The III(5) and III(6) promoter constructs possessed promoter activities 4-fold lower than that of the wild type BE fragment. It should be noted that the III(6) linker replacement disrupts one of the major transcriptional start sites mapped by rapid amplification of cDNA ends in our previous work (31Solecki D. Schwarz S. Wimmer E. Lipp M. Bernhardt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5579-5586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). All three of these major transcriptional start sites bear homology to an initiator-like element (36Kraus R.J. Murray E.E. Wiley S.R. Zink N.M. Loritz K. Gelembiuk G.W. Mertz J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1531-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To test if the loss of promoter activity seen in the III(6) construct could be attributed to the initiator-like sequence, the CA core of all three potential initiator motif was changed to GC, a mutation that was previously shown to disrupt initiator activity (37Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The activity of this promoter construct was equal to that of the BE promoter construct (data not shown). This result indicates that the III(5) and III(6) mutations do not elicit their loss in expression of the luciferase reporter gene by disruption of an initiator-like motif in the vicinity of the 5′ most transcriptional start site. Reductions of promoter activity were also observed with single linker replacements in FPII and FPI. The II(4) construct possessed an activity 55% that of wild type, whereas an activity of 60–80% of wild type was seen with the I(1) construct. The close proximity of FPI and FPII, and the II(4) and I(1) linker replacements, led us to speculate that these two cis-acting sequences may act together to contribute functionally toward CD155 promoter activity. To test whether there was an additive effect upon mutating both sites simultaneously a construct was cloned in which the region including both the II(4) and I(1) linker replacements were deleted. The ΔFPII/I construct possessed an activity approximately 40–45% that of the wild type BE promoter construct when transfected into the HeLa S3 and HTB15 cell lines (see Fig. 3). Taken together, these results indicate that FPI and FPII possess cis-acting sequences that contribute significantly toward CD155 promoter activity. These sequences may possibly contribute in an additive manner because deletion of both sites leads to a linear reduction in promoter activity. Footprinting an"

Various extracellular growth inhibitory signals elicit G1 arrest by targeting CDK4. Here we show that in a myeloid cell line, 32D cl 3, enforced expression of CDK4, but not cyclins D2 nor D3, overrides the γ-irradiation-induced G1 arrest. CDK4 does not confer resistance to the radiation-induced G2 block observed in parental cells. Ectopic expression of CDK4 overcomes the ionizing radiation-induced inhibition of CDK4 and CDK2 kinase activity. The levels of CDK4 protein do not change after exposure to ionizing radiation in either parental cells or those overexpressing CDK4. Ionizing radiation induces the expression of both p53 and p21, and in cells constitutively synthesizing exogenous CDK4, the return of p53 protein levels to baseline is prolonged. Increased levels of p21 are found associated with CDK4, and not CDK2, in the lines overexpressing CDK4, compared to the parental line, after exposure to ionizing radiation. Enforced expression of CDK4 may therefore overcome a γ-irradiation-induced G1 arrest through the titration of the CDK inhibitor p21 allowing both CDK4 and CDK2 to remain active."
https://openalex.org/W2036095605,"Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) is associated with various clinical disorders including adult T cell leukemia, myelopathy, arthropathy. Hypercalcemia resulting from osteoclast activation and a variety of hematopoietic abnormalities have been also observed in HTLV-I infected patients, however, precise mechanism about initial trigger(s) prior to presenting symptoms is still unknown. In this study, to assess effects of HTLV-I on hematopoiesis, we analysed characteristics of early hematopoietic precursors in HTLV-I env-pX transgenic rats. Progenitor cells for osteoclasts were significantly increased even in the marrow of asymptomatic env-pX rats. Progenitors for B cells were also highly enriched, while colony forming cells (CFC) elicited by GM-CSF(CFU-GM) and M-CSF(CFU-M) were comparable to normal littermates. Following arthritis in env-pX transgenic rats, osteoclastogenesis was further augmented and the CFCs were increased. Bone marrow cells carrying adjuvant-induced arthritis retained a constant number of progenitors for osteoclast and B lymphocytes, whereas the number of CFU-GM and CFU-M increased. These results indicate that the env-pX transgene affect early stages of osteoclast and B-cell lineages prior to developing diseases, in contrast, an increase of the CFCs was caused indirectly by arthritis. This study provides a novel standpoint for the mechanisms of pathogenesis by HTLV-I."

The site at −2.5 kb was independent from, whereas the other three sites could be related to, α1(VI) mRNA expression.

When nuclear extracts from EL4 lymphocytes were used, the AP1 site-containing sequence was bound by proteins not related to AP1. The existence of the hypersensitive site at −0.1 kb may be related to the binding of AP1 and of additional factors to the core promoter (Piccolo, S., Bonaldo, P., Vitale, P., Volpin, D., and Bressan, G.

The results indicate that regulation of transcription of the Col6a1gene by different cis-acting elements (core promoter, AP1 binding site and enhancers) is not completely modular, but the final output depends on the specific interactions among the three elements in a defined cell type. Collagens are the most abundant extracellular matrix proteins of vertebrates (1Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). 19 types have been characterized so far, differing in structural features and tissue distribution. In addition to maintaining the structural integrity of organs, collagens endow tissues with peculiar mechanical and biological properties depending on the pattern and the levels of expression. For this reason the regulation of expression is a key issue in collagen biology. For most collagen genes, transcription is the major regulatory step, and analyses ofcis- and trans-acting elements have been obtained mainly for α1(I), α2(I), and α1(II) genes (2–7 and references therein). Several types of regulatory regions necessary for high level transcription have been identified in collagen genes. As for other genes, these include the core promoter, which comprises sequence motifs usually within −40 and +40 nucleotides from the RNA start site and may or may not include a TATA box motif; the proximal upstream activating region, which extends from about −50 to −200 base pairs from the RNA start site and contains recognition sites for a subgroup of sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors; and enhancers,cis-acting DNA sequences that increase transcription in a manner that is independent of their orientation and distance relative to the RNA start site (8Blackwood E.M. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1998; 281: 60-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Other important transcription control regions, such as the locus control region, have not been identified yet in collagen genes. The locus control region was recognized initially in the β-globin gene cluster (9Martin D.I.K. Fiering S. Groudine M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and has now been characterized in several other genes (8Blackwood E.M. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1998; 281: 60-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 10Frazer P. Grosveld F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The locus control region is necessary to convert an inactive locus to a state competent for transcription, a condition detected by an increase in sensitivity of chromatin to digestion by DNase I. Subsequent transcription ensues by additional specific regulatory sequences, which, when active, usually introduce additional DNase I-hypersensitive sites. For example, five hypersensitive sites have been detected in the β-globin locus control region (10Frazer P. Grosveld F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and additional hypersensitive sites are located close to the core promoter of transcribed genes (9Martin D.I.K. Fiering S. Groudine M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although, as stated above, no locus control regions have been defined yet, a correspondence between hypersensitive sites and actual transcription has been found also for collagen genes, in particular α2(I) and α1(I) (5Bou-Gharios G. Garrett L.A. Rossert J. Niederreither K. Eberspaecher H. Smith C.N. Black C. De Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 11Salimi-Tari P. Cheung M. Safar C.A. Tracy J. Tran I. Harbers K. Breindl M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 198: 61-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As for the manner in which the different cis-acting regulatory elements contribute to the transcriptional regulation of a collagen gene, the available data suggest that they act in a modular way (4Rossert J. Chen S.S. Eberspaecher H. Smith C.N. De Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1027-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 5Bou-Gharios G. Garrett L.A. Rossert J.

Bressan G.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As proposed recently by Arnone and Davidson (14Arnone M.I. Davidson E.H. Development. 1997; 124: 1851-1864PubMed Google Scholar), this means that each region contributes “a particular regulatory function that is a subfraction of the overall combined regulatory function executed by the complete system” independently from the other regions. A corollary of this view is that tissue specificity of transcription is contributed by enhancers and is independent of the core promoter, whose function is the assembly of the basal transcription apparatus; hence, in experiments with transgenic animals, promoter-reporter gene constructs are expected to give rise to the same temporal and spatial pattern of expression whether using the homologous or a heterologous promoter. The few experiments addressing this issue for collagen genes confirm the above prediction (5Bou-Gharios G. Garrett L.A. Rossert J. Niederreither K. Eberspaecher H. Smith C.N. Black C. De Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).We have recently undertaken a study of the regulation of transcription of the α1 chain of type VI collagen, a gene that has been linked to Bethlem myopathy in humans (15Jöbsis G.J.

In this paper we have identified several DNase I-hypersensitive sites in the 5′-flanking region of the gene. One of these sites, located at about −0.1 kb from the transcription initiation site, is detectable only in cells expressing collagen VI mRNA and contains a recognition motif for the transcription factor AP1. Analysis of the function of the AP1 sitein vitro and in vivo in the context of the homologous and of a heterologous promoter indicates that both the AP1 site and the core promoter play an important role in the regulation of tissue-specific transcription of the Col6a1 gene.DISCUSSIONThe results described in this paper contribute substantial information on the function of the proximal promoter region of theCol6a1 gene. A DNase I-hypersensitive site (identified as HS1) was localized in the chromatin at about −0.1 kb from the transcription initiation site. HS1 was detectable only in cell lines that express α1(VI) collagen mRNA, suggesting that a rearrangement of the chromatin structure in the proximal 5′-region is a necessary condition for transcriptional activation of the gene. The analysis of DNase I-hypersensitive sites also suggested that distinct levels of expression in different cell types were achieved by additional rearrangements of the chromatin at other sites. Thus, high amounts of mRNA were detected in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, where three hypersensitive sites were easily detectable at −4.6, −4.4, and −0.1 kb, whereas 10-fold lower levels of α1(VI) mRNA were found in C2C12 myoblasts, where the site at −0.1 kb was strongly and the other two sites very weakly sensitive to DNase I. Regions containing a defined set of DNase I-hypersensitive sites in chromatin are usually required for position-independent transcription of transgenes in vivo (9Martin D.I.K. Fiering S. Groudine M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 10Frazer P. Grosveld F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). When tested alone, sequences corresponding to HS1 were completely inadequate to overcome the constraints of chromatin structure. On the other hand, they improved the function of other sites, as indicated by the relative increase of mouse transgenic lines expressing the lacZ reporter gene (from 54 to 87% for constructs of Fig. 4A and from 23 to 75% for those of Fig. 4B) when the AP1 binding site was present. As indicated by the high percentage of expressing lines in Fig. 4, hypersensitive sites HS2 and HS3 are very efficient in making chromatin transcriptionally competent at the site of insertion of transgenes. However, the data also point out that the hypersensitive sites detected were not sufficient for complete independence of transgene expression from the insertion site. Therefore, additional regulatory sequences and DNase I-hypersensitive sites should be identified to understand fully the transcriptional regulation of the Col6a1 gene.DNase I footprinting and band-shift assays have located a recognition site for transcription factor AP1 at −104 to −73 base pairs, close to where HS1 maps, suggesting that this site and probably the GA box-containing sequences identified previously between −75 and +8 (16Piccolo S. Bonaldo P. Vitale P. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19583-19590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) play an important role in determining DNase I hypersensitivity of chromatin. An AP1 binding site proximal to the basal promoter is a conserved feature of the Col6a1 gene since the site has been found also in chicken and in human (24Williman T.E. Trueb B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 332-338PubMed Google Scholar, 25Saitta B. Chu M.-L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In addition, a similar element was recognized in the chicken α2(VI) collagen gene (26Williman T.E. Maier R. Trueb B. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 653-663Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar), suggesting that an AP1 binding site may be a key element in the regulation of collagen VI genes. In NIH3T3 and C2C12 cells, which express the α1(VI) mRNA, the site was actually bound by an AP1 factor complex containing JunD. In contrast, in nuclear extracts from EL4 cells, which do not express the α1(VI) mRNA, the same sequence was recognized by factor(s) not related to AP1, although the cells contain various molecular forms of the AP1 transcription factor. An obvious speculation stimulated by these results is that the presence or absence of DNase I HS1 may be determined by the difference of nuclear factor binding at sequences including the AP1 site. One possibility is that the AP1 factors of EL4 lymphocytes bind with low affinity to the Col6a1 gene promoter, whereas the molecular form(s) present in NIH3T3 and C2C12 cells have high affinity for the site. Differences in the molecular composition of AP1 binding to distinct promoters have already been observed in various cell types (27Barrett T.J. Vedeckis W.V. Recept. Signal Transduct. 1996; 6: 179-193PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, EL4 cells might contain peculiar transcription factors that are absent in the other cells and compete with AP1 protein for binding to the site. Future studies will elucidate this issue.Analysis of transgenic mice carrying promoter-lacZconstructs has shown that the frequency of expressing lines and the average level of expression in the lines are variously affected by the AP1 binding site in different tissues. Both parameters are particularly dependent on the presence of the AP1 site in subepidermal mesenchyme, at the insertion of the superficial muscular and aponeurotic system, and in tendons. The frequency parameter can be attributed to the capacity of a cis-acting region to make chromatin accessible to the transcriptional machinery, indicating that AP1 has an important structural role in these tissues. This function of the AP1 site is clearly evident also in vibrissae, where the frequency, but not the intensity, was greatly stimulated. The level of expression of a transgene probably depends on the activating potential of thecis-acting elements, i.e. the ability of the factors binding to DNA modules to recruit the transcription preinitiation complex (8Blackwood E.M. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1998; 281: 60-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Our data lead us to conclude that AP1 is a strong activator of transcription in cells of subepidermal mesenchyme, at insertions of the superficial muscular and aponeurotic system, and tendons. On the contrary, the AP1 site does influence only marginally both the frequency and the intensity of expression of transgenes in cells of the peripheral nervous system. To explain the independence of frequency from the AP1 site it may be hypothesized that, in the peripheral nervous system, either the function of the site is replaced by another site not active, and hence not detected, in the cell cultures we have used, or opening up of chromatin is almost completely dependent on the upstream enhancer region. An intermediate situation is apparent in the remaining tissues, articular cartilage and intervertebral discs, where the AP1 site increases to some extent the frequency and intensity of expression. The in vivo data also suggest a role for the core promoter in tissue-specific transcriptional regulation of the Col6a1 gene, in a way similar to that of the AP1 binding site. In fact, expression of transgenes in tendons and at the insertions of superficial muscular and aponeurotic system was more evident with the Col6a1 promoter than with the β-globin promoter. Conversely, the frequency of expression in the peripheral nervous system was higher with the β-globin promoter. The core promoter of the Col6a1 gene was partially characterized in previous work and was shown to exhibit several unusual features among the TATA-less promoters (16Piccolo S. Bonaldo P. Vitale P. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19583-19590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Bonaldo P. Piccolo S. Marvulli D. Volpin D. Marigo V. Bressan G.M. Matrix. 1993; 13: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The RNA start sites are spread on a sequence of more than 70 base pairs, and the most upstream site has been denoted as +1. The major transcription initiation site is at base +21 and a second strong site at base +9. These sites resemble, but do not match exactly the consensus sequence proposed for the initiator element (+21 site: 8Py C A+1 G C 3Py; +9 site: 9Py G+1 G C T 8Py; consensus sequence for initiator: Py Py A+1 N T/A Py Py; where Py indicates a pyrimidine) (28Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Because it has been noted that a large number of pyrimidines surrounding the start site can impart low levels of initiator activity in the absence of either the A at +1 or the T at +3 (29Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), it is very likely that the sequences around +21 and +9 constitute weak initiators. These initiator elements, however, do not drive transcription unless they are linked to an upstream sequence, containing repeated GA boxes, which extends from −75 to +8 (16Piccolo S. Bonaldo P. Vitale P. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19583-19590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This region has intrinsic promoter activity, as suggested by the observation that the fragment −82 to +41 is equally active in both orientations, 3S. Piccolo, unpublished observations. a property not shared by initiators (28Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Considering both the putative initiator sites and the GA box-rich region, the core promoter of theCol6a1 gene extends from −75 to +25, a sequence that closely corresponds to that used to synthesize our Col6a1core promoter constructs (−82/+41).In a previous report we located the region inducing transcription in tendons and at the insertions of the superficial muscular and aponeurotic system within 0.6 kb upstream from the RNA start site (12Braghetta P. Fabbro C. Piccolo S. Marvulli D. Bonaldo P. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1163-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The new results point at the AP1 binding site as an important element contributing to activation of transcription in these tissues. In the same paper, the modules responsible for transcription in the subepidermal mesenchyme were assigned to the −5.4/−3.9 enhancer region. The present data show that expression in this tissue is strongly dependent on the homologous promoter and on the presence of the AP1 binding site. Thus, it may be speculated that transcription in the subepidermal mesenchyme requires a synergistic action of the three regulatory elements: the core promoter, the AP1 site, and the enhancer region. The overall message coming from the in vivoexperiments is, therefore, that transcription in different tissues depends on a peculiar interplay among the three regulatory elements.The complexity of the mechanisms of tissue-specific regulation of theCol6a1 gene observed in vivo was defined further in transfections in vitro. The quantitative analysis of the results leads to a conclusion similar to that of the in vivodata: the levels and the features of transcriptional activation in different cell types depend on the specific interactions among the core promoter, the proximal activating region, and the enhancer region. Four distinct types of interaction could be identified by the data reported in Table II, as outlined in Fig. 5. In C2C12 cells the AP1 site did not interact positively with the −3.9/−5.4 kb enhancer region (Fig. 5, A and B). When the β-globin promoter was used, the only interaction was between the promoter and the enhancer (Fig. 5 A). On the other hand, the homologous promoter was stimulated by both the AP1 site and the enhancer, and the final induction of transcription achieved with the three modules together was the sum of those obtained from the separate combinations of the promoter with the other modules (Fig.5 B). A completely different situation was apparent in NIH3T3 cells. The use of the β-globin promoter resulted in a synergistic activation of about 3.5-fold when all of the modules were present. The synergism can be explained by assuming that the protein complex assembled at each module interacted positively at the same time with those brought together by the other modules as indicated in Fig.5 C. By replacing the TATA-containing β-globin promoter with the TATA-less promoter of the Col6a1 gene, synergism did not take place, and a fourth type of interaction of modules was observed, tentatively identified as competitive (Fig. 5 D). Namely, although the AP1 site stimulated considerable transcription from the promoter, expression in the presence of the enhancer was similar with or without the AP1 site. This condition can be accounted for by hypothesizing that an activating interaction takes place between the homologous promoter and the AP1 site if the enhancer is inactive (or absent) and that this interaction is disrupted when the enhancer is turned on and binds to the core promoter.The model of Fig. 5 differs considerably from the view of DNA regulatory elements acting in a modular way to control transcription deduced from studies on expression of transgenes in vivo by several authors including ourselves (2Pavlin D.

The modularity of the function of cis-acting elements in these reports only applies to the fact that, for genes expressed in several tissues, such as most collagens, different enhancer regions activate transcription in specific subsets of tissues. A closer look at the function of the regions involved, however, shows the existence of more complex interactions among regulatory elements, which may explain peculiar features of a gene's regulation. One example is enhancer-promoter selectivity, in which the activation of only one of multiple promoters by a nearby enhancer depends on cognate interactions between the two elements (8Blackwood E.M. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1998; 281: 60-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 30Ohtsuki S. Levine M. Cai H.N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). As for our experiments, these results provide evidence that different core promoters possess distinct regulatory activities. The model of Fig. 5 is also consistent with the present knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of transcription activation, in which the final result is the consequence of specific interactions of protein complexes bound to different cis-acting regulatory elements. In a simplified view, the core promoter associates with the general transcription factors (31Orphranides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar), whereas activators are bound at proximal activating sequences or at enhancers. Enhancers are usually made of specific clusters of binding sites for nuclear factors, which impose a precise alignment of the proteins on the DNA, resulting in the formation of a stable, highly stereospecific three-dimensional nucleoprotein complex called enhanceosome (32Grosschedl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 362-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 33Carey M. Cell. 1998; 92: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The interaction between the general transcription factors and the enhanceosome (or single activators at isolated binding sites) then determines the recruitment of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme and the formation of a stable preinitiation complex (33Carey M. Cell. 1998; 92: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 34Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 119-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). It is clearly apparent from this model that any change in the composition of the three types of protein complexes (general transcription factors, enhanceosome, and activators bound at the proximal activating region) could influence RNA polymerase II recruitment. The molecular analysis of the interactions among thecis-acting regulatory regions of the Col6a1 gene in different cell types will require the delineation of binding of general transcription factors to the core promoter and the characterization of the protein complex assembled at enhancer regions. These studies are presently in progress. Collagens are the most abundant extracellular matrix proteins of vertebrates (1Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). 19 types have been characterized so far, differing in structural features and tissue distribution. In addition to maintaining the structural integrity of organs, collagens endow tissues with peculiar mechanical and biological properties depending on the pattern and the levels of expression. For this reason the regulation of expression is a key issue in collagen biology. For most collagen genes, transcription is the major regulatory step, and analyses ofcis- and trans-acting elements have been obtained mainly for α1(I), α2(I), and α1(II) genes (2–7 and references therein). Several types of regulatory regions necessary for high level transcription have been identified in collagen genes. As for other genes, these include the core promoter, which comprises sequence motifs usually within −40 and +40 nucleotides from the RNA start site and may or may not include a TATA box motif; the proximal upstream activating region, which extends from about −50 to −200 base pairs from the RNA start site and contains recognition sites for a subgroup of sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors; and enhancers,cis-acting DNA sequences that increase transcription in a manner that is independent of their orientation and distance relative to the RNA start site (8Blackwood E.M. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1998; 281: 60-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Other important transcription control regions, such as the locus control region, have not been identified yet in collagen genes. The locus control region was recognized initially in the β-globin gene cluster (9Martin D.I.K. Fiering S. Groudine M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and has now been characterized in several other gene"
https://openalex.org/W2067009338,"To characterize the human <i>elk-1</i>promoter, we mapped the transcriptional start site and isolated <i>elk-1</i>-specific genomic phage clones that contained extensive upstream and downstream sequences. A TATA-like motif was identified immediately upstream of the transcriptional start site. Functional analyses of DNA fragments containing the TATA element and the identification of a DNase I-hypersensitive chromatin site (HS 1) in close proximity to the TATA box suggest that the identified TATA motif is important for <i>elk-1</i> transcription <i>in vivo</i>. Sequences upstream and downstream from the TATA box were found to contribute to <i>elk-1</i> promoter activity. A second hypersensitive site (HS 2) was identified within the first intron in pre-monocytic cells, which express Elk-1 only when differentiating to monocytes. In a variety of other cell types, which display a constitutive Elk-1 expression, HS 2 did not exist, suggesting that inducibility of <i>elk-1</i> expression is associated with the presence of HS 2. Egr-1 and the serum response factor were found to interact specifically with the intronic sequence at +265 and +448, respectively. Because Egr-1 mRNA and protein levels were observed to increase significantly before induction of <i>elk-1</i>expression, we propose that Egr-1 is important for the regulation of<i>elk-1</i> transcription in differentiating monocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2327121002,"bcl-XS, a member of the bcl-2 family, has been shown to induce and/or sensitize some cells to undergo programmed cell death, and to negate the anti-apoptotic activity of bcl-XL and bcl-2 by mechanisms which are still uncertain. To help understand these mechanisms we have established stable derivatives of the K12 rat colon carcinoma cell line that express bcl-XS in a tetracycline-regulated manner, using an autoregulatory retroviral cassette. When bcl-XS expression is induced, we observe two phenotypic responses. A small fraction of cells appear to undergo spontaneous apoptosis while the majority of cells undergo a form of cytostasis. In the latter case, the cells stop dividing (or divide a limited number of times at a retarded rate) and swell to many times their original size. These cells can take on a ghost-like appearance and subsequently detach from the culture plates and die or they may remain intact in a hindered state of proliferation. Doubling times were calculated to be 31.4 h in the presence of tetracycline and 50.4 h without tetracycline, bcl-XS expression also causes dramatic alterations in the cell cycle distribution of K12 cells manifesting as a substantial decrease (≈amp;50%) in the fraction of S phase cells with a concomitant increase in the G1 population. Continuous expression of bcl-XS, at levels approximately equal to that of bcl-XL, decreased the viability of K12 cells as demonstrated by a log decline in clonogenic survival. This decrease occurred without considerable apoptosis or a compensatory increase in the level of bcl-XL. None of these phenotypes were present in control cells expressing β-galactosidase in a similar retroviral cassette. These observations demonstrate that bcl-XS can have substantial cytokinetic effects under circumstances that produce relatively little apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1968274427,"Abstract Highly purified preparations of the TyrR protein of Haemophilus influenzae Rd undergo specific and limited proteolytic cleavage during storage at 4 °C to generate two fragments of 28 and 8 kDa. Under nondenaturing conditions, the two fragments remain tightly associated. Nicked TyrR is identical to full-length TyrR in its operator binding characteristics. The 8-kDa fragment containing amino acid residues 258–318 was separated from the 28-kDa fragment (residues 1–257) by gel filtration chromatography in the presence of 4 m urea. Upon renaturation, this fragment bound to operator with an affinity similar to that of full-length TyrR but was unresponsive to ligands that normally modulate operator binding (γ-S-ATP and l-tyrosine). It was not possible to renature the urea-treated 28-kDa fragment. Highly purified soluble preparations of truncated TyrR containing residues 1–257 were obtained after the overexpression of a shortened form of the tyrR gene via a specific plasmid construct. By several criteria, this species had native secondary and tertiary structure. The 28-kDa fragment was unable to bind to operator but could reconstitute nicked TyrR when added to the renatured 8-kDa fragment, as shown by physical properties and responsiveness to cofactors in operator binding. When either the 28- or 8-kDa species was expressed in vivo, there was no detectable operator binding, as evaluated using a lacZreporter system driven by the repressible aroFpromoter. When the two fragments were co-expressed in a common cytoplasm, an operator-binding species was formed, as demonstrated through partial restoration of repression capability."
